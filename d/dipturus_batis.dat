The diets and food consumption by the thorny skate of different size groups were analyzed and assessed with special reference to the consumption of commercial species of fishes and crustaceans. Less comprehensive data on food composition are presented for other less abundant Barents Sea skates: arctic skate (A. hyperborea), round skate (Rajella fyllae), blue skate (<b>Dipturus</b> <b>batis),</b> spinytail skate (Bathyraja spinicauda) and sail ray (D. linteus) ...|$|E
40|$|International audienceFourteen {{specimens}} of the Norwegian skate, Dipturus nidarosiensis (Rajiformes, Rajidae), were caught off the Sardinian coasts (Central Western Mediterranean Sea) in 2005 - 2008 between 600 and 1420 m of depth. Their identification {{has been confirmed}} by the sequencing of three regions of the mtDNA (16 SrDNA, control region and cytochrome c oxidase subunit 1) and comparison of the obtained sequences with that of three species of <b>Dipturus</b> (D. <b>batis,</b> D. oxyrinchus and D. nidarosiensis) from the Mediterranean Sea and the adjacent North-eastern Atlantic Ocean. A simple PCR-RFLP assay has been developed for an easy, reliable and robust identification of these skate species. A morphological comparison of the Norwegian skate with congeneric species is given {{in order to help}} future identifications. This is the first record ofD. nidarosiensis in the Mediterranean Sea; the possibility of recent or ancient but unnoticed occurrence of the Norwegian skate in the region is discusse...|$|R

40|$|A brief {{encounter}} with this skate. The skate {{was on the}} seabed near some survey equipment as the ROV approached to recovery the gear. It began to swim away as it was illuminated by the ROV lights. Recently the Common Skate (<b>Dipturus</b> <b>batis)</b> was recognised as being two distinct species - with the Flapper Skate D. cf. intermedia being the more northerly (and larger) of the two, and the more southerly species being the Blue Skate {{which is likely to}} retain the name D. batis (scientific names are still being decided). This individual looks like D. intermedia and that fits with the distribution and where it was sighted. The "common skate" is, in fact very rare. It is classified as critically endangered by the IUCN red list of threatened species [URL]...|$|E
40|$|The {{occurrence}} of skates (Rajidae) in the by-catch of trawl and long-line fisheries in the Barents Sea are described. The dominant species captured were thorny skate or starry ray (Amblyraja radi-ate), arctic skate (A. hyperborea) and round skate (Rajella fyllae), whereas blue or big skate (<b>Dipturus</b> <b>batis)</b> and sail ray (D. linteus) were only caught occasionally. Information {{on the size}} distribution and sex ratio are provided. Larger skates were more often caught in long-line fisheries, with the mean and maximum length of fish greater in long-line catches, particularly for the larger-bodied species. Ratio of males to females was close to 1 : 1 in all species except for arctic skate where males dominated in the long-line fishery. Preliminary estimates of skate by-catch in these fisheries indicate that total annual by-catch of skate in the Barents Sea ranges from 723 – 1 891 tons. Thorny skate accounted for 90 – 95 % of the total skate catch...|$|E
40|$|Many {{sharks and}} skates are {{particularly}} vulnerable to overfishing because of their large size, slow growth, late maturity and low fecundity. In Europe dramatic population declines {{have taken place in}} common skate (<b>Dipturus</b> <b>batis</b> L.), one of the largest demersal fish in regional shelf seas, leading to extirpations from substantial parts of its former range. Here we report the discovery of cryptic species in common skate collected from the northeast Atlantic continental shelf. Data from nuclear microsatellite markers indicated two clearly distinct clades and phylogenetic analysis of mitochondrial DNA sequences demonstrated monophyly of each one of them. Capture locations showed evidence of strong spatial segregation, with one taxon occurring mainly in waters off the southern British Isles and around Rockall, while the other was restricted to more northerly shelf waters. These apparently cryptic species showed overlapping substrate and depth preferences, but distributional limits were closely related to temperature gradients, potentially indicating thermal limits to their distributions. This discovery of hidden diversity within a large, critically endangered marine vertebrate demonstrates how marine biodiversity can be underestimated, even in such a relatively well-studied and heavily exploited region...|$|E
40|$|The skate fauna in the {{northern}} Northeast (NE) Atlantic is poorly investigated, and misidentifications are common. Here, ‘DNA barcoding’ was used to analyse 105 specimens of 15 species previously reported from the area to investigate the occurrence of species. Of these 15 species, three were new to the region and confirmed with voucher specimens. Three previously reported taxa were not obtained from the study area, providing a total number of 12 skate species for {{the northern}} NE Atlantic. Only one specimen of the critically endangered <b>Dipturus</b> <b>batis</b> complex was found. It occurs frequently in the literature and commercial fisheries catch records, and we argue {{that the vast majority}} of these are misidentifications. Due to striking differences in Amblyraja radiata life history parameters across the North Atlantic, cryptic species diversity has previously been suspected. A total of 80 A. radiata cytochrome c oxidase subunit I sequences from across the North Atlantic were sampled, and the highest fixation index (FST) was found when maximising geographical distance (FST = 0. 133). A lower index was found when grouped according to life history (FST = 0. 067). These results are not strongly supportive for the occurrence of cryptic species...|$|E
40|$|This Fisheries Science Partnership {{project was}} {{developed}} to estimate the longer-term survivorship and movements of thornback ray Raja clavata in the southern North Sea, using traditional tagging methods. Thornback ray is the dominant skate species taken in targeted and mixed fisheries in this area, and is taken in various trawl, line and gillnet fisheries. Five inshore vessels {{were used in the}} study, with seven trips planned in order to examine the catches and survivorship following capture by small otter trawlers, gillnetters and longline vessels. A variety of skate and ray species is marketed as ‘skate’, and commercial landings data are for all species combined. The lack of species-specific landings data has hampered assessments of the status of individual stocks and species, although species-specific landings are required for the main skate species taken in the North Sea from 2008. Some of the larger-bodied skate species, such as common skate <b>Dipturus</b> <b>batis</b> are now of conservation concern. The main objectives of this study were to (1) examine the species, sex and size composition of skates (Rajidae) taken in inshore fisheries in the southern North Sea, (2) assess the survivorship of commercially caught fish and (3) undertake...|$|E
40|$|Skates {{are widely}} {{consumed}} across the globe, but many large species {{are subject to}} considerable concern regarding their conservation and management. Within Europe such issues have recently driven policy changes so that, for the first time, reports of skate landings now {{have to be made}} under species-specific names. Total allowable catches have also been established for many groups, which have been set to zero for a number of the most vulnerable species (e. g., <b>Dipturus</b> <b>batis,</b> Raja undulata and Rostoraja alba). Whilst accurate species identification has become an important issue for landings, the sale of skates is still usually made under a blanket term of “skate” or “ray”. The matter of identifying species of skate is further complicated by their morphologically conservative nature {{and the fact that they}} are commercially valued for their wings. Thus, before sale their bodies are usually discarded (i. e., “winged”) and often skinned, making morphological identification impossible. For the first time, DNA barcoding (of the mitochondrial COI gene) was applied to samples of skate wings from retail outlets across the British Isles, providing insight into which species are sold for consumption. A total of 98 wing samples were analysed, revealing that six species were sold; blonde ray (Raja brachyura), spotted ray (Raja montagui), thornback ray (Raja clavata), cuckoo ray (Leucoraja naevus) small-eyed ray (Raja microocellata) and shagreen ray (Leucoraja fullonica). Statistical testing demonstrated that there were significant differences in the species sold in the distinct retail groups which suggests complex drivers behind the patterns of sale in skates. The results also indicate that endangered species are not commonly being passed on to consumers. In addition, the practice of selling skate wings under ambiguous labels is highlighted as it makes it extremely difficult for consumers to exercise a right to avoid species of conservation concern. Interestingly, a single retailer chain labelled their wings as originating from three smaller-growing species (generally to be considered of lower conservation concern); of the six samples analysed from this company a third were mislabelled and originated from the thornback ray (a larger species that is currently undergoing population declines) ...|$|E
40|$|The basal {{prerequisite}} for managing species and understanding ecosystems is correct species and population identification. Without knowing the species, we cannot with accuracy detect changes in distribution or abundance due to climate change, fisheries, diseases {{or any other}} types of impact. This thesis gives the first complete overview of chondrichthyan fishes (sharks, skates, rays and chimaeras), recorded in the Arctic Ocean and adjacent seas. A total of 49 species were found to occur, and the most specious regions were the Bering Sea, the Norwegian Sea and the Barents Sea, {{also known as the}} Arctic Gateways. The Bering Strait is an effective zoogeographic barrier, separating the Pacific from the Atlantic species. In particular, skates are prone to misidentifications. Species complexes are known to occur, and the group is commonly lumped as “Skates & Rays” in fishery statistics or in scientific publications. By use of genetic methods (DNA barcoding), the skate species reported from the northern Northeast (nNE) Atlantic was investigated. A total of 12 species were found to occur in the area, and three of those were new for the region. Skates are commonly encountered in the nNE Atlantic, but ~ 95 % are the smaller-sized Amblyraja radiata. Larger skates may be landed and they are necessarily a mix of the remaining 11 species, some of which are considered threatened. There were strong indications of the disappearance of Leucoraja fullonica, as well as over-reporting of the critically endangered common skate complex formerly known as <b>Dipturus</b> <b>batis.</b> Amblyraja radiata was suspected to be cryptic due to large differences in size-at-maturity across its distributional range. However, the mitochondrial gene cytochrome c oxidase subunit 1 (COI) did not support this hypothesis. To further elucidate this question, a higher resolution method was applied, and 10 microsatellite markers were investigated from specimens across the North (N) Atlantic. Pairwise fixation indexes (FST) indicated that there may be three major clusters in the N Atlantic: Northwest Atlantic, Mid Atlantic (Greenland) and NE Atlantic. However, more rigorous tests revealed high physical mixing of individuals over a large geographical area. The microsatellite results did not support the hypothesis of A. radiata being cryptic. Although the population structure of A. radiata could not be fully explained, baselines for occurrence of chondrichthyan fishes are established, and a new identification guide for skates in the nNE Atlantic is provided. Hopefully, this will pave the way for a better management of the skates by improving data quality...|$|E
