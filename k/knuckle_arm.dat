In this paper, we analyzed the reasons of a light vehicle’s <b>knuckle</b> <b>arm</b> fracture theoretically by finite element method and took corrective measures such as enlarging the transition fillet and improving the surface quality.

25|$|Chalicotherium, {{like many}} members of Perissodactyla, was adapted to browsing, though uniquely adapted to do so among its {{ungulate}} relatives. Its arms were long and heavily clawed, allowing them to walk on their <b>knuckles</b> only. The <b>arms</b> were used {{to reach for the}} branches of large trees and bring them close to its long head to strip them clean of leaves. The horse-like head itself shows adaptation to a diet of soft vegetation, since, as the animal reached sexual maturity, the incisors and upper canines were shed, suggesting that its muscular lips and the resulting gum pads were enough to crop fodder which was then processed by squarish, low-crowned molars.|$|R
40|$|Aluminum-copper alloy B 206 has an {{excellent}} potential for use in automobiles as suspension <b>knuckles</b> and control <b>arms.</b> The main shortfall of this alloy however, is its high susceptibility to hot tearing. Grain refinement {{has been shown to}} reduce hot tearing severity in Al alloys. In the present study, Ti-B grain refiner was added at two levels (0. 02 and 0. 05 wt% Ti) to B 206 to investigate the effect on hot tearing. Residual lattice strain was measured for each condition using neutron diffraction. Equiaxed fine grains significantly reduced hot tears in the alloy, and this resulted in a lower magnitude of residual strain along the casting. Peer reviewed: YesNRC publication: Ye...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Steering axle and {{steering}} <b>knuckle</b> <b>arm</b> often appear craze problem within its service life. In this paper, {{the structure of}} a car steering knuckle was investigated using finite element program at uneven road surface conditions, emergency braking condition and sideslip conditions under the condition of full load. The results show that the joint shaft neck and adjacent shoulder of steering knuckle are the easiest to be damaged. At the same time, the steering knuckle meets the strength requirement under various conditions. Secondly, use the theory of fatigue to analysis and consider parts material fatigue properties, mean stress and other factors. Steering knuckle fatigue simulations use the ANSYS software to estimate the fatigue life. Under the condition of loop 900000 times, there was no damage in steering knuckle. According to the analysis results, reduce stress concentration and the surface roughness for steering knuckle improvement measures are propose...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Die {{casting process}} has been used widely for complex {{automotive}} products such as the <b>knuckle,</b> <b>arm</b> and etc. Generally, a part fabricated by casting has limited strength due to manufacturing defects by origin such as the dendrite structure and segregation. As an attempt to offer a solution to these problems, forging {{has been used as}} an alternative process. However, the forging process provides limited formability for complex shape products. Rheo-forging of metal offers not only superior mechanical strength but also requires significantly lower machine loads than solid forming processes. In order to produce semi-solid materials of the desired microstructure, a stirring process is applied during solidification of molten state. This paper presents the results of an A 356 aluminum alloy sample, which were obtained by experiment and by simulation using DEFORM 3 D. Samples of metal parts were subsequently fabricated by using hydraulic press machinery. In order to compare the influence of loading method, two types of samples were fabricated: (1) samples fabricated under direct loading die sets (2) those fabricated under indirect loading die sets. The formability and defects, which were predicted by FEM simulation, were similar to those of samples used in practice...|$|E

The establishment and optimized analysis of the structure parametric design model, which {{is used for the}} objective function of minimum variation of the caster angle, kingpin inclination angle, wheel camber, wheel toe-in angle and wheel tread, gets the reasonable and optimization design scheme of structure parameters for air suspension guide mechanism, and provides a theoretical basis for further improvement of this automobile suspension system. 1 Spatial motion analysis model Figure 1 is a diagram of automobile double wishbone suspension, figure 2 is a diagram for analyzing the space movement.

40|$|The use of {{aluminum}} alloy castings for safety critical structural components such as engine mount brackets, steering <b>knuckles,</b> and control <b>arms,</b> offers significant opportunities for achieving weight reduction in automobiles, {{since they are}} typically about half {{the weight of the}} steel, cast iron, or ductile iron component that they replace. Metal Compression Forming (MCF) is a variant of the squeeze casting process, in which molten metal is allowed to solidify under pressure in order to close porosity and form a sound part. However, the MCF process applies pressure on the entire mold face, thereby directing pressure on all regions of the casting and producing a uniformly sound part. The process is capable of producing parts with properties close to those of forgings, while retaining the near net shape, complexity in geometry, and relatively low cost of the casting process. The paper describes the casting process development involved in the production of an aluminum A 357 alloy motor mount bracket, including the use of a filling and solidification model to design the gating and determine process parameters. Tensile properties of the component are presented and correlated with those of forged components. Limited fatigue properties obtained by fully reversed strain controlled testing are also presented...|$|R
