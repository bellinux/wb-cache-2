40|$|After many abusive, over-torqued powershifts, {{the venerable}} T 5 is left a little worse for wear. Couple this with no {{built-in}} shift fork limits and sheer age, {{and the frequency}} of failure is quite high in any spirited driven vehicle. Or, in some cases, the high-mileage often seen on Mustangs results in worn out friction linings on the blocker rings. (My first (and only, so far!) failure was a delaminated fourth gear blocker. I could upshift, but had to pause a while to downshift, until it went out altogether, at 125, 000 miles!) Update: July 2, 1999 : Blew input shaft at lunch! Thing sounded like a grenade going off; left with fourth gear only! Now I feel like a real man, LOL! The solution: Why, a thorough rebuild, of course! While going through the rebuild, do you and your trans a favor by spending some of the money saved on upgrades: the two most notable are a steel <b>input</b> <b>shaft</b> <b>bearing</b> retainer and a decent aftermarket shifter (or at least do something about the factory rubber isolators, like remove them!). Besides learning how to do a rebuild to get yourself out of trouble, it’s a great bartering skill when your “friends” blow theirs up! The sources: I have purchased parts from D&D Performance, Hanlon Motorsports, and National Drivetrain. I have received outstanding service from all, and always receive my parts in a timely manner. However, I will not do business with NDT again over a petty issue (actually, not petty; based on principals that they claim but did not uphold; they do have good deals on inputs and clusters from time to time, but their kits, uh, suck, IMHO…). Personally, I prefer to deal with Hanlon; Linda, Bob’s wife, always makes me laugh when I speak with her, and they had the courtesy to call me several months after I placed an order to let me know the Tremec rebuild manuals were in, and overnight a part that they let slip through. You cannot go wrong with D&D or Hanlon...|$|E

Component improvements or new transmission concepts can thus be evaluated by comparison with the established data. Results of efficiency and vibration tests of the UH- 60 A have been reported previously. In this investigation the transmission was instrumented internally and tested over a range of operating conditions. The speed was varied from 50 to 100 percent of the full rated value, and the torque was varied from 10 to 100 percent of the full rated value. Temperatures of internal bearings and gears were measured. The computer program Planetsys was used to simulate the thermal performance of this transmission. The calculated temperatures were then compared with the corresponding measured values. The highest measured temperature was 405 K (270 F) on the outer race of the high-speed <b>input</b> <b>shaft</b> roller <b>bearing,</b> at the 100 -percent power condition.

40|$|A {{systematic}} {{methodology for}} gearbox health assessment and fault classification is developed and evaluated for 560 data sets of gearbox vibration {{data provided by}} the Prognostics and Health Management Society for the 2009 data challenge competition. A comprehensive set of signal processing and feature extraction methods are used to extract over 200 features, including features extracted from the raw time signal, time synchronous signal, wavelet decomposition signal, frequency domain spectrum, envelope spectrum, among others. A regime segmentation approach using the tachometer signal, a spectrum similarity metric, and gear mesh frequency peak information are used to segment the data by gear type, <b>input</b> <b>shaft</b> speed, and braking torque load. A health assessment method that finds the minimum feature vector sum in each regime is used to classify and find the 80 baseline healthy data sets. A fault diagnosis method based on a distance calculation from normal along with specific features correlated to different fault signatures is used to diagnosis specific faults. The fault diagnosis method is evaluated for the diagnosis of a gear tooth breakage, <b>input</b> <b>shaft</b> imbalance, bent <b>shaft,</b> <b>bearing</b> inner race defect, and bad key, and the method could be further extended for other faults {{as long as a}} set of features can be correlated with a known fault signature.
