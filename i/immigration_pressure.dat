Most importantly, it differentiates between two historical periods that have shaped Israeli coalition politics. Prior to the 1967 Arab-Israeli War and the election of the 7 th Israeli Knesset in 1969, Israeli political parties formed consensual and inclusive coalitions in response to economic, <b>immigration,</b> and external <b>pressures.</b> Low levels of party competition and the dominance of Mapai in the Israeli Knessets further contributed to the formation of large alliances. Post- 1969, following the gradual decline of Labor’s electoral dominance, Israeli parties became further polarized and more competitive.

This procedure provides an accurate evaluation of the quasi-stationary probability distribution of population sizes in the pre-colonization state, and of the mean time to colonization, {{for a wide range}} of immigration rates.

40|$|Abstract: This paper {{examines}} {{the impact of}} private, quasi-market versus public steering of educational systems on European youngsters ’ attitudes towards immigrants. There has recently been a drive for a quasi-market strategy {{in the provision of}} education, inspired by the hope that this will increase both quality and cost-effectiveness. However, research has shown that this policy leads to greater inequality between schools and individual pupils. In this paper we use the data from the International Civic and Citizenship Education Study (ICCS 2009) to see whether the extent of market steering lessens support for immigrants ’ rights. Such an effect is expected because market steering is thought to increase the inequality between schools and to lead to a concentration of immigrant children in schools where pupils with weak socio-economic backgrounds are concentrated. The focus of the analysis is on the country level variation in the attitudes towards immigrants. Controlling for overall <b>immigration</b> <b>pressure,</b> quasi-market systems are observed to lead to less support for immigrants ’ rights, and this is largely due to the higher concentration of immigrant children in low SES schools in such systems. These characteristics of the educational system explain about half of the cross-national variation in attitudes towards immigrants among the 21 countries observed...|$|E
40|$|We apply {{stochastic}} process theory {{to the analysis}} of immigrant integration. Using a unique and detailed data set from Spain, we study the relationship between local immigrant density and two social and two economic immigration quantifiers for the period 1999 - 2010. As opposed to the classic time-series approach, by letting immigrant density play the role of "time", and the quantifier the role of "space" it become possible to analyze the behavior of the quantifiers by means of continuous time random walks. Two classes of results are obtained. First we show that social integration quantifiers evolve following pure diffusion law, while the evolution of economic quantifiers exhibit ballistic dynamics. Second we make predictions of best and worst case scenarios taking into account large local fluctuations. Our {{stochastic process}} approach to integration lends itself to interesting forecasting scenarios which, in the hands of policy makers, have the potential to improve political responses to integration problems. For instance, estimating the standard first-passage time and maximum-span walk reveals local differences in integration performance for different immigration scenarios. Thus, by recognizing the importance of local fluctuations around national means, this research constitutes an important tool {{to assess the impact of}} immigration phenomena on municipal budgets and to set up solid multi-ethnic plans at the municipal level as <b>immigration</b> <b>pressure</b> build...|$|E
40|$|Mountain environments are {{currently}} among the ecosystems least invaded by non-native species; however, mountains are increasingly {{under threat of}} non-native plant invasion. The slow pace of exotic plant invasions in mountain ecosystems is likely due {{to a combination of}} low anthropogenic disturbances, low propagule supply, and extreme/steep environmental gradients. The importance of any one of these factors is debated and likely ecosystem dependent. We evaluated the importance of various correlates of plant invasions in the Wallowa Mountain Range of northeastern Oregon and explored whether non-native species distributions differed from native species along an elevation gradient. Vascular plant communities were sampled in summer 2012 along three mountain roads. Transects (n = 20) were evenly stratified by elevation (~ 70 m intervals) along each road. Vascular plant species abundances and environmental parameters were measured. We used indicator species analysis to identify habitat affinities for non-native species. Plots were ordinated in species space, joint plots and non-parametric multiplicative regression were used to relate species and community variation to environmental variables. Non-native species richness decreased continuously with increasing elevation. In contrast, native species richness displayed a unimodal distribution with maximum richness occurring at mid-elevations. Species composition was strongly related to elevation and canopy openness. Overlays of trait and environmental factors onto non-metric multidimensional ordinations identified the montane-subalpine community transition and over-story canopy closure exceeding 60 % as potential barriers to non-native species establishment. Unlike native species, non-native species showed little evidence for high-elevation or closed-canopy specialization. These data suggest that non-native plants currently found in the Wallowa Mountains are dependent on open canopies and disturbance for establishment in low and mid elevations. Current management objectives including restoration to more open canopies in dry Rocky Mountain forests, may increase <b>immigration</b> <b>pressure</b> of non-native plants from lower elevations into the montane and subalpine zones...|$|E
40|$|Migration {{has become}} a major global {{phenomenon}} in recent decades. As well as permanent migrants and their families there are seasonal and temporary workers, frontier workers, illegal immigrants and asylum-seekers. In Africa the traditional movement of traders and seasonal workers has been obscured by the large number of refugees from political conflict. In Asia there has been temporary migration from the Indian subcontinent to meet the labour shortages of the Middle East. In Europe the long established migration patterns from ex-colonies to the UK and France, and of Turks to Germany, has been supplemented by new flows into the traditional countries of emigration such as Italy, Spain and Portugal. At the same time the political changes in Central and Eastern Europe have created new and substantial <b>immigration</b> <b>pressures</b> upon the Community.

40|$|This paper {{analyses}} {{attitudes towards}} immigration and multiculturalism in two autonomist parties, the Scottish National Party and the Frisian National Party. Both parties {{are members of}} the European Free Alliance, ‘an alliance of regionalist and civic, democratic nationalist parties in Europe’ (EFA website). However, the parties highlight the broad diversity of ‘civic’ autonomist parties; the SNP being a large governing party which utilizes an economic narrative to further its autonomist agenda whereas the FNP is a provincial party in the Netherlands with a strong cultural focus. Both parties have had to formulate policies and create a narrative in relation to immigration. This paper compares attitudes to immigration and multiculturalism in both parties by examining different conceptions of national identity. A mixed methods approach is adopted, including quantitative analysis of surveys of both parties’ memberships and semi- structured interviews with party elites as well as documentary analysis. It is demonstrated that contextual factors such as <b>immigration</b> <b>pressures,</b> demographic challenges and peripherality help to explain the parties’ official positions. These are, in general, positive towards immigration and multiculturalism. However, at an individual level there is considerable divergence between members in terms of attitudes towards immigration and multiculturalism...|$|R

However, they are continuously challenged by socio-political and economic realities all around the world, with Europe no exception. How can democracy be preserved when it results in elected governments limiting democratic rights and liberties for the sake of security or financial stability? How can human rights be preserved when societies are faced with terrorist threats or when national economies are tested by <b>immigration</b> <b>pressures?</b> Is rule of law guaranteed when those elected to uphold democratic principles – members of parliament and city councils – are either prisoners of interest groups or, {{as in the case of}} certain countries, try to use their status to escape legal investigation on charges of corruption?

Starting from the assumption that higher education institutions should now involve a much wider range of learners than before through lifelong learning programmes, the differences between how different generations learn become very important to calibrate educational experiences and facilitate inter-generational dialogue. This contribution illustrates some of these differences and discusses some ways in which they could be taken into account in designing higher education for democratic societies...|$|R
40|$|When {{a product}} {{performs}} {{better or worse}} than expectations, there are many biological, ecological, and operational factors that must be examined. Genetic resistance to the pesticide itself is often a concern. The control interval depends on the ecological impact of biotic (e. g., presence and function of natural enemies) and abiotic (e. g., frequency and severity of storms) factors. Timing, rates, and application methods used are also key factors affecting product performance. A four-year study to evaluate pyriproxyfen (Knack®) field performance in Arizona was initiated in 2004, after levels of whitefly susceptibility in statewide surveys were observed to be decreasing. Grower sites in Maricopa, Buckeye, Wellton, and Marana were used. We controlled for major operational factors by using a common timing, rate, and aerial application for each Knack spray. Resistance bio-assays were conducted on progeny of field-collected adults, pre- and post-spray. New eggs were marked in-field prior to spraying and examined {{in the field and}} lab in order to isolate Knack-associated mortality caused by direct toxicity as well as by ecological factors (e. g., bioresidual). Nymphal bioassays were used to evaluate metamorphosis inhibition. Population trends were estimated using standard sampling methods. Appropriate check plots were compared to the Knack treatment. Study results suggest Knack field performance and pyriproxyfen resistance has not changed significantly among the years or locations examined to date. In 2005, many struggled to gain control over whitefly populations. This work indicated that Knack performance and resistance parameters were within the range expected for the last several years. However, operational and ecological barriers to the performance of Knack and other chemistry were in play. Late planted conditions, lush winter vegetation capable of hosting whiteflies, poor growing conditions, and an extended period of extreme <b>immigration</b> <b>pressure</b> were all factors that diminished the impact of Knack and other products in 2005. In contrast, the winter preceding 2006 was among the driest on record followed by a very active monsoon season in central Arizona. High winds and dust movement, and a very active natural enemy community helped to continually lower whitefly populations. The result was a whitefly season characterized as light, with overall foliar insecticide usage setting a 28 -yr record low for Arizona cotton. Barring all other operational and ecological factors at work, control intervals should have been similar each year. Yet, observed intervals have been different (e. g., 2005 vs. 2006) and point to the importance of these external factors in assessing product performance. Work will continue in 2007 to identify factors that contribute to whitefly outbreak conditions. These data will be key to understanding any performance changes, either due to operational or ecological factors mentioned above or due to innate changes in whitefly susceptibility. This will be important in advising growers about the risk factors associated with whitefly outbreaks and should lead to recommendations for minimizing these risks...|$|E
40|$|Consequentialism {{is a moral}} {{philosophy}} that maintains that the moral worth of an action {{is determined by the}} consequences it has for the welfare of a society. Consequences of model design {{are a part of the}} model lifecycle that is often neglected. This paper investigates the issue using system dynamics modeling as an example. Since a system dynamics model is a product of the modeler’s design decisions, the modeler should consider the life cycle consequences of using the model. Seen from a consequentialist perspective, the consequences of policies developed from system dynamics models determine the model’s moral value (ethical/unethical). This concept is explored by discussing model uncertainty from an engineering perspective. In this perspective, the ethical considerations shift from the behavior of the modeler (and away from validation) to the model itself and the model’s inherent uncertainty. When the ethical considerations are taken away from the modeler and directed to what the model does, the ethical boundaries extend beyond the proximity of the model. This discussion renews the ethics conversation in system dynamics by considering this shift in philosophical perspective, and investigates how consequentialist {{moral philosophy}} applies to the modeling process and in communicating with decision-makers. A model of social assistance in Norway in the context of <b>immigration</b> <b>pressures</b> illustrates some possibilities for addressing these ethical concerns.

30|$|In this paper, we are {{concerned}} with the relationship between the employment of immigrants and wages, a field of intense empirical and theoretical research in labor economics since the 1950 s (Becker 1957; Chiswick 1978; Arrow 1998; Altonji and Blank 1999; Arai and Thoursie 2009; Baert and Cockx 2013; Baert and De Pauw 2014; Baert et al. 2014, 2015). The empirical research in this area is marked by the observation that on average foreign workers with comparable productivity-related characteristics than natives receive lower wages (Bevelander and Veenman 2008; Chiswick et al. 2008; Meurs and Pailhe 2010; Barrett et al. 2012; McGuinness and Byrne 2014; Arai et al. 2015). The relevance of this relationship partly stems from its connection to a series of distributional issues and especially concerns about discrimination and retributive justice.

40|$|For decades, many European {{countries}} with strong economy have experienced substantial <b>immigration.</b> The <b>pressure</b> increased {{strongly in the}} last couple of years when civil and regional war in some of the middle Asian countries forced its residents towards European countries. This has led to increase in population of the host country, which has implications in terms of consumption of resources such as water and land; imposes financial burden on the Government to create more jobs and basic infrastructure like housing, schools, medical facilities etc. In view of the impacts of immigration on the host country, an integrated perspective is required, which links sustainable housing need with the labour market and education needs. This project investigates the policies and approaches that the Swedish Government has adopted in relation to the sustainable housing and immigrants, by way of a case study of the city/municipality of Uppsala. The project further explores the policies and approaches with respect to various indicators for sustainable housing such as adequate security; accessibility; building specifications related to fire, structure; basic infrastructure; and in context with labour market and education access. A scoring method is adopted to analyse the extent to which present approaches support sustainable housing development. In case the approach is not in coherence, measures are suggested which could transform these approaches into sustainable housing policy approaches. The results of the analysis are applied to the formulation of three scenarios. The preferable scenario highlights that the authorities and agencies are required to work together on the common platform towards the provision of sustainable housing to the immigrants. This would require reorganization, concrete decisions on amendment of certain policies and actions in order to make the housing solutions viable and sustainable for the immigrants. ...|$|R

40|$|In 1926 Newfoundland enacted {{legislation}} to restrict immigration {{in spite of}} the fact that the island had received very few immigrants in the previous seventy years. The antecedents of the 1926 Immigration Act can be found in the colony's own immigration experience, the shift in international immigration policies after the First World War, and its relations with Canada and the United States. [...] After the First World War, Canada and the United States effectively restricted immigration to Mainland North America. This shift in immigration policy left Newfoundland with the most liberal regulations in North America and caused increasing difficulties for the colony's migrating labour force. Unlike its neighbours, Newfoundland did not experience mass immigration in the early part of the twentieth century. As a result, immigration policy was not a high priority. The colony did not have in place the administrative or legislative framework to respond to the development of international or North American restrictions. [...] Canadian and American <b>immigration</b> officials <b>pressured</b> the Newfoundland Government to restrict immigration in the wake of two organized immigrant smuggling schemes in 1925 - 26. The arrival of two small groups of eastern Europeans in St. John's enroute to the United States, and the subsequent investigations launched by the American consulate and local investigations launched by the American consulate and local officials, warned legislators that the colony could be the recipient of redirected immigrants. With an uncertain economy and a dependence on the goodwill of its neighbours to relieve its excess labour, Newfoundland reacted to concerns over immigrant smuggling by passing a new immigration act in 1926. [...] This act emulated Canadian style restrictions and ended a tradition stemming from 1906 of judging prospective immigrants, with the exception of the Chinese, by individual merit. This was significant as individual merit was replaced by blanket restrictions as a way of screening potential immigrants. The 1926 Newfoundland Immigration Act was the last stage in a trend to create uniform immigration standards for North America after the war...|$|R

The protesters were asking for a comprehensive bill to reform the failing U. S. immigration system. But a year later, there was still no comprehensive reform, only a public opinion backlash and an unfunded bill to build a fence along the U. S. -Mexico border. Were protesters adopting the wrong strategy by hyping up their cause? ^ More than 2, 000 immigration bills introduced in the U. S. House and Senate from 1980 to 2005 were studied with an original scale to test three hypotheses [...] -that immigration bills were more symbolic during years of high hype, that they were more anti-immigrant in years of high hype and that legislators from districts along the U. S. -Mexico border were generally less likely to draft symbolic, anti-immigrant bills than their non-border counterparts, regardless of hype. Symbolic, anti-immigrant bills have realworld consequences because their very introduction reinforces negative stereotypes about {{immigrants and their}} possible passage into law can hurt immigrants. The focus of this study is the relationship between hype, or mediatized public interest, and symbolic, anti-immigrant legislation, such as the fence bill. ^ In results represented visually by graphics, highly symbolic bills such as resolutions followed the highs and lows of hype and anti-immigrant bills, such as those focusing on alien criminals and terrorists, followed even closer. This was especially true after the 1990 s backlash made anti-immigrant public opinion a political force to be reckoned with. Border legislators showed greater sensitivity to immigration issues by drafting proportionally more immigration bills than their non-border counterparts and less anti-immigrant bills.

In 2004, the Immigration Act Commission (IAC) published a proposal for possible reforms, initiating political discussions that culminated in new rules for family migration introduced in 2007 and 2010 – all under the long Social Democratic government led by Jens Stoltenberg (2005 – 13). The commission raised the problem of forced marriages between young people in Norway of immigrant descent and new foreign spouses, and proposed a requirement that both spouses be at least 21, to ensure they were mature enough to resist family and cultural <b>pressure</b> (<b>Immigration</b> Act Commission, 2004, p. 243). While the commission noted that liberal family reunification policies worked to attract asylum seekers to the country, it did not deem using family migration rules to deter asylum seekers appropriate because they “risk serious abuses in their home country, {{and there is no}} other way to ensure family unity than through family reunification in the country of refuge. Respect for family unity in cases where one of the family members are entitled to stay in Norway in accordance with our international obligations, must be an obvious precondition for Norwegian family immigration” (Immigration Act Commission, 2004, p. 214).|$|R
40|$|Background: International {{migration}} across Europe is increasing. High {{rates of}} net migration {{may be expected}} to increase pressure on healthcare services, including emergency services. However, the extent to which <b>immigration</b> creates additional <b>pressure</b> on emergency departments (EDs) is widely debated. This review synthesizes the evidence relating to international migrants’ use of EDs in European Economic Area (EEA) countries as compared with that of non-migrants. Methods: MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, The Cochrane Library and The Web of Science were searched for the years 2000 – 16. Studies reporting on ED service utilization by international immigrants, as compared with non-migrants, were eligible for inclusion. Included studies were restricted to those conducted in EEA countries and English language publications only. Results: Twenty-two articles (from six host countries) were included. Thirteen of 18 articles reported higher volume of ED service use by immigrants, or some immigrant sub-groups. Migrants were seen to be significantly more likely to present to the ED during unsocial hours and more likely than non-migrants to use the ED for low-acuity presentations. Differences in presenting conditions were seen in 4 / 7 articles; notably a higher rate of obstetric and gynaecology presentations among migrant women. Conclusions: The principal finding of this review is that migrants utilize the ED more, and differently, to the native populations in EEA countries. The higher use of the ED for low-acuity presentations {{and the use of the}} ED during unsocial hours suggest that barriers to primary healthcare may be driving the higher use of these emergency services although further research is needed. ...|$|R
