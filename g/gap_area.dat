25|$|President James Buchanan {{was born}} into an Ulster Scots family on April 23, 1791, {{near the village of}} Cove Gap. He was born in a log cabin on {{property}} owned by his father. The complex was known as Stony Batter, named for the family home near Ramelton in County Donegal in Ulster, Ireland. At the time of Buchanan's birth, the Cove <b>Gap</b> <b>area</b> was {{on the edge of the}} American frontier. Today it is a quite isolated area, but when President Buchanan was born it was a center of frontier commerce. Stony Batter was a complex of cabins, barns, stables, storehouses, a general store, and an orchard. Pioneers travelling from the East Coast through Cove Gap stopped at Stony Batter to rest and replenish their supplies. Buchanan lived at Stony Batter until he was six years old, when his father moved his business to Mercersburg.|$|E

40|$|The {{assessment}} of canopy <b>gap</b> <b>areas</b> {{on the basis}} of soil characteristics in forest ecosystems could be one of benefit points for management of forests. This research was conducted in 20 ha areas of Experimental Forest Station of Tarbiat Modares University that is located in a temperate forest of Mazandaran province in the north of Iran. Twenty one canopy <b>gaps</b> with different <b>areas</b> were found in studied areas and classified as small (85. 12 m 2), medium (325. 21 m 2), large (512. 11 m 2) and very large (723. 85 m 2) <b>gaps.</b> These <b>areas</b> classes of canopy gaps were assessed with respect to nine criteria (soil pH, carbon to nitrogen ratio, cation exchange capacity, phosphorus, potassium, calcium, nitrogen mineralization, microbial respiration and earthworm’s biomass). Soil samples (0 – 45 cm depth from the gap center and edge positions) were measured in the laboratory. The Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) was used for {{assessment of}} canopy <b>gap</b> <b>areas.</b> This method is widely used the Multiple Criteria Decision Support (MCDS) method and perhaps the most popular in many fields, including natural resource management, especially in forest sciences. Results of AHP indicate that the maximum of local priority belongs to small <b>areas</b> of canopy <b>gaps</b> when considering all soil characteristics. However, medium, large and very large canopy <b>gap</b> <b>areas</b> have priorities, respectively. The calculated overall priority showed that with respect to considered criterias, small and medium <b>gap</b> <b>areas</b> have higher, more ideal condition in comparison to large and very large areas. AHP results emphasise that considering soil characteristics canopy <b>gap</b> <b>areas</b> should be less than 400 m 2 in Hyrcanian forests of Iran. Also, AHP can be introduced as an effective instrument in decision-making processes for investment planning and prioritization in compliance with environmental regulations...|$|R

500|$|In {{the last}} days of December 1944, the SUK participated, along with other Chetnik formations, in an {{unsuccessful}} attempt to capture the Partisan-held city of Tuzla in northeastern Bosnia. This failure and mutual recriminations between Mihailović's Chetniks and the SUK resulted in the effective disintegration of the SUK. By mid-January 1945, 5,000 former SDS members had rejoined the Germans, with some returning to Serbia to take advantage of Josip Broz Tito's amnesty. Most were transported to Austria where they were used in labour battalions under the direction of Organisation Todt, but about 1,500 were allowed to move to the Ljubljana <b>Gap</b> <b>area,</b> where they could join other collaborationist forces, such as the SDK or the Chetnik formations of Momčilo Đujić or Dobroslav Jevđević.

2500|$|The {{origin of}} the name [...] "Kings Gap" [...] is not known, {{although}} it is believed to date back to early settlers in this region. The forests of Kings Gap reflect {{the influence of the}} charcoaling industry that began in the 1700s and persisted through the late 1800s. Before the discovery of coal, charcoal fueled the iron furnaces located nearby. Some furnaces were as close as Huntsdale, one mile to the southwest of the entrance to Kings Gap. Iron furnaces required tremendous amounts of charcoal as fuel. In 1786, an average furnace consumed in one day the charcoal produced from one acre of forest. The forests of South Mountain were clearcut on a 20 - 25-year cycle to satisfy the unquenchable thirst for charcoal by nine iron furnaces located in the Kings <b>Gap</b> <b>area.</b> A relatively young forest now exists {{as a result of these}} repeated cuttings.|$|E

We analyzed the status of bat species richness and occurrence in areas with high wind potential in Brazil. By crossing datasets on species records and wind potential we identified 21 hotspots and 226 data <b>gap</b> <b>areas.</b> Overall, 70 % of the areas with the highest wind potential are data gaps, lacking elementary information about species presence. Current Environment Impact Assessments system for wind farms in Brazil has relaxed regulations and questionable effectiveness. Environmental agencies should require de facto Environment Impact Assessments in data <b>gap</b> <b>areas,</b> with technical rigor proportional to the investment under course. At least for bats, the Brazilian wind power sector must raise the bar, adopting a more rigorous licensing. Alliances to minimize bat mortality at wind farms are necessary and this goal should be pursued in Brazil...|$|R

40|$|Visual Sample Plan (VSP) is sample {{planning}} {{software that}} is used, among other purposes, to plan transect sampling paths to detect {{areas that were}} potentially used for munition training. This module was developed for application on a large site where existing roads and trails were {{to be used as}} primary sampling paths. <b>Gap</b> <b>areas</b> between these primary paths needed to found and covered with parallel transect paths. These <b>gap</b> <b>areas</b> represent areas on the site that are more than a specified distance from a primary path. These added parallel paths needed to optionally be connected together into a single path—the shortest path possible. The paths also needed to optionally be attached to existing primary paths, again with the shortest possible path. Finally, the process must be repeatable and predictable so that the same inputs (primary paths, specified distance, and path options) will result in the same set of new paths every time. This methodology was developed to meet those specifications...|$|R
40|$|The {{structural}} complexity, especially canopy and gap structure, of old‐growth forests {{affects the}} spatial variation of soil respiration (Rs). Without considering this variation, the upscaling of Rs from field measurements {{to the forest}} site will be biased. The present study examined responses of Rs to soil temperature (Ts) and water content (W) in canopy and <b>gap</b> <b>areas,</b> developed the best fit modelof Rs and used the unique spatial patterns of Rs and crown closure to upscale chamber measurements to the site scale in an old‐growth beech‐oak forest. Rs increased {{with an increase in}} Ts in both <b>gap</b> and canopy <b>areas,</b> but the effect of W on Rs was different between the two areas. The generalized linear model (GLM) analysis identified that an empirical model of Rs with thecoupling of Ts and W was better than an exponential model of Rs with only Ts. Moreover, because of different responses of Rs to W between canopy and <b>gap</b> <b>areas,</b> it was necessary to estimate Rs in these areas separately. Consequently, combining the spatial patterns of Rs and the crown closure could allow upscaling of Rs from chamber‐based measurements to the whole site in the present study...|$|R

40|$|Continuous {{rainfall}} measurements from ground-based radars {{are crucial}} for monitoring and forecasting heavy rainfall-related {{events such as}} floods and landslides. However, complete coverage by ground-based radars is often hampered by terrain blockage and beam-related errors. In this study, we presented a method to fill the radar gap using surrounding radar-estimated precipitation and observations from a geostationary satellite. The method first estimated the precipitation over radar <b>gap</b> <b>areas</b> {{using data from the}} Communication, Ocean, and Meteorological Satellite (COMS); the first geostationary satellite of Korea. The initial precipitation estimation from COMS was based on the rain rate-brightness temperature relationships of a priori databases. The databases were built with temporally and spatially collocated brightness temperatures at four channels (3. 7, 6. 7, 10. 8, and 12 μm) and Jindo (126. 3 ° E, 34. 5 ° N) radar rain rate observations. The databases were updated with collocated data sets in a timespan of approximately one hour prior to the designated retrieval. Then, bias correction based on an ensemble bias factor field (Tesfagiorgis et al., 2011 b) from radar precipitation was applied to the estimated precipitation field. Over the radar <b>gap</b> <b>areas,</b> this method finally merged the bias-corrected satellite precipitation with the radar precipitation obtained by interpolating the adjacent radar observation data. The merging was based on optimal weights determined from the root-mean-square error (RMSE) with the reference sensor observation or equal weights in the absence of reference data. This method was tested for major precipitation events during the summer of 2011 with assumed radar <b>gap</b> <b>areas.</b> The results suggested that successful merging appears to be closely related {{to the quality of the}} satellite precipitation estimates...|$|R

40|$|In {{this work}} a new gap-fill {{technique}} entitled projection transformation {{has been developed}} and used for filling missed parts of remotely sensed imagery. In general techniques for filling missed area of an image are broken down into three main categories: multi-source techniques that take the advantages of other data sources (e. g. using cloud free images to reconstruct the cloudy areas of other images); the second ones fabricate the <b>gap</b> <b>areas</b> using non-gapped parts of an image itself, this group of techniques {{are referred to as}} single-source gap-fill procedures; and third group contains methods that make up a combination of both mentioned techniques, therefore they are called hybrid gap-fill procedures.
