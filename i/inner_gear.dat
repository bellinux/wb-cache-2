Based on the {{two-stage}} forming technology, {{the casting}} AZ 31 Magnesium alloy bar was forged into cylindrical straight <b>inner</b> <b>gear</b> between the temperature 250 ℃- 400 ℃. At 250 ℃, {{the teeth of}} the <b>inner</b> <b>gear</b> are almost formed. But there are some cyclic cracks {{on the surface of the}} sample. When improving the temperature above 300 ℃, the surface quality of the sample has greatly improved. According to the result of this experiment, the best temperature range for forging AZ 31 magnesium gear is 280 ℃ to 380 ℃. The forming load gradually reduced with the temperature improved. At 250 ℃, the forming load is 93 t. At the 400 ℃, the forming load reduces to 80 t. The initial grain size of AZ 31 magnesium alloy bar is 22 μm. The microstructure evolution during the warm deformation was observed by optical microscopy (OM). It is demonstrated that the grain refinement happened during the deformation process...|$|E

The flex-gears rotate and orbit around the annular space as planetary gears when the inner and outer gear members rotate with respect to one another.

40|$|In this paper, {{a method}} for {{evaluating}} the kinematic flow rate of a crescent oil pump is presented. The procedure also allows calculating the angular derivatives of the delivery, suction and trapped volumes of the pump, which are the prerequisites for the simulation of the unit using a lumped parameters approach. The method {{is based on the}} knowledge of the length of the vector rays between the centres of the gears and the contact points. From the volume derivatives, an analytic expression of the pump displacement and of the kinematic flow ripple index is obtained. Moreover, the same formula can also be applied to external gear machines. Finally, in this study the influence of the number of teeth of the driving and driven gears has been assessed. The increase of the number of teeth of the <b>inner</b> <b>gear</b> is beneficial; both for the reduction of the flow ripple and for the increase of the displacement at equal overall pump size...|$|E
50|$|Caroline, {{the widow}} of Edward Ehlers (and {{daughter}} of Henry Korthauer, {{one of the original}} mill builders), sold the farm and the windmill to the Mount Emblem Cemetery Association for $10,000 in 1925. The association planned to convert the land into a cemetery. Although the windmill and farm buildings were scheduled for demolition, the association instead hired Henry and Franklyn Ehlers, Edward’s sons, to preserve the mill as a museum. They rebuilt the sails, installed new shingles and trim on the exterior, painted the mill, and purposely dismantled some of the <b>inner</b> <b>gearing</b> to better show their use. The sails were turned to an ‘X’ formation, which traditionally means the mill is in “a long rest period”. They also turned the cap to the northeast toward the cemetery’s entrance. A barn, the only other structure that survived demolition, was home to the groundskeeper, but was recently destroyed.|$|R
50|$|As {{early as}} the Han dynasty, when the state needed to {{effectively}} measure distances traveled throughout the empire, the Chinese relied on the mechanical odometer device. The Chinese odometer {{came in the form}} of a wheeled-carriage, its <b>inner</b> <b>gears</b> functioning off the rotated motion of the wheels, and specific units of distance—the Chinese li—marked by the mechanical striking of a drum or bell for auditory alarm. The specifications for the 11th century odometer were written by Chief Chamberlain Lu Daolong, who is quoted extensively in the historical text of the Song Shi (compiled by 1345). In the Song period, the odometer vehicle was also combined with another old complex mechanical device known as the south-pointing chariot. This device, originally crafted by Ma Jun in the 3rd century, incorporated a differential gear that allowed a figure mounted on the vehicle to always point in the southern direction, no matter how the vehicle's wheels' turned about. The device concept of the differential gear for this navigational vehicle is now found in modern automobiles in order to apply the equal amount of torque to wheels rotating at different speeds.|$|R

40|$|It is {{possible}} to design cylindrical helical gearing profiles such that an externally lobed <b>inner</b> <b>gear</b> rotates inside an internally lobed outer gear while maintaining continuous lines of contact between the gears. The continuous contact between {{the inner and outer}} rotors (analogous to the main and gate rotors in a conventional screw machine) creates a series of separate working chambers. In this type of machine the rotors have parallel axes of rotation, and if both rotors are free to rotate about their own axes, these axes can be fixed in space. The use of ported end plates is proposed to control the period during which fluid is allowed to enter or leave the working chambers of the internally geared screw machine. As with conventional screw machines, these internally geared rotors can then be used to achieve compression or expansion of a trapped mass of fluid, and the machine geometry can be designed in order to optimise performance for particular applications. This paper describes the geometrical analysis of some simple rotor profiles and explores the effect on rotor torques for particular applications of this novel screw configuration...|$|E
40|$|A {{new type}} engine valve control {{system has been}} presented, in which both valve lift and phase are {{controlled}} directly by electric motors. A mechanism of the phase control system is made of planetary gears. The outer gear is the timing pulley which has timing belt driven by the crank of an engine. Two planetary gears are inside of the pulley. The gears engage in <b>inner</b> <b>gear</b> of the pulley. The center of the disc which has centers of the planetary gear {{is connected to the}} camshaft. Then, the crank rotation is transmitted to the cam shaft, and rotation of sun gear is added to the rotation of cam shaft. This means that when rotation angle of the sun gear is controlled, phase of the cam can be controlled. The lift control system is made of linear slider and ball screw. The cam shape of this system is three-dimensional. The height of the cam varies along the axis of the shaft. Hence, when the ball screw rotates, the cam shaft slides in the axial direction, so that the lift of the cam varies. Experimental tests have been carried out for the system. lt is ascertained that both cam lift and phase can be controlled continuously...|$|E
40|$|Electric {{machines}} are indispensable part in modern industry {{and they are}} widely used in many applications such as power generation, vehicles, elevator, robot, and so on. Owing to {{the diversity of the}} application occasions, different requirements have been proposed. In the applications, such as wind power generation, low-speed, high-torque and high-efficiency electric {{machines are}} required to match with the low-speed load. Currently, this problem is handled by either adopting a speed-boost mechanical gear, or using low-speed machine design. The former one causes mechanical wear and tear, audible noise and low efficiency, whereas the latter one increases the generator size and weight as well as raw material cost. In recent years, another option, namely integrating a coaxial magnetic gear into a permanent-magnet (PM) machine has been proposed. This option allows for directly mounting the outer, low-speed shaft with the load while enables the electric machine coupled with the high-speed <b>inner</b> <b>gear</b> to operate at high speeds. However, this magnetic-geared electric machine desires a complex structure, involving two rotating bodies and three air-gaps, which increases manufacture difficulty and cost. The research work of this thesis attempts to solve the speed-matching problem by developing a new electric machine. The incorporation of vernier concept with PM machine gives birth to the permanent-magnet verier (PMV) machine. Different from traditional synchronous machine, the rotor of the PMV machine rotates at a definite fraction of the synchronous speed, as if it were geared down from the high rotating field set up by the stator. The PMV machine, therefore, can be regarded as a combination of a gear with fixed gear ratio and an electric machine. This kind of machine is attractive in applications which require low speed and high torque, and mechanical gearing is undesirable. The main objective of this thesis is to present the design, analysis and control of the proposed PMV machine. After the introduction on mechanical gears, magnetic gears, and low-speed machines, the design details of the proposed outer-rotor PMV machine are provided. Moreover, the working principle, stable torque generation mechanism and structural features are presented. Due to the introduced vernier effect, it is important to perform the finite element analysis (FEA) for the proposed PMV machine. The electric circuit equation and the motion equation are coupled with the Maxwell’s equation to calculate the key parameters of the proposed machine. The analysis results of the magnetic field distributions, air-gap flux density distributions, flux linkages, winding inductances, back electromotive forces (EMFs), cogging torque and static torque are presented in detail. The performances of PMV machine are compared with other machines to show its advantages and disadvantages. The control strategy of the PMV machine as a brushless DC machine is also presented. The conventional 120 -degree conducting, dual-closed-loop control strategy is used for speed and torque control and the experimental setup are given. The results are obtained and compared with the simulation results, thus verify the validity of the design. Finally, the potential applications for the proposed PMV machine are suggested. published_or_final_versionElectrical and Electronic EngineeringDoctoralDoctor of Philosoph...|$|E

Based on {{the parameters of}} an actual project and the strong impact of external excitations, the modal properties and dynamic responses are analyzed, and the cutterhead joint surface loads are obtained and treated by rain flow count. Numerical {{results indicate that the}} low natural frequencies are 57 [*]Hz and 61 [*]Hz, and natural vibration modes are pinions-motors rotational mode and translational-overturning coupled mode of cutterhead with <b>inner</b> ring <b>gear</b> correspondingly. Besides, the axial and radial amplitude of dynamic responses are 0. 55 [*]mm and 0. 25 [*]mm, respectively. The frequencies of radial, torsional, and overturning vibrations are predominantly concentrated in 112 [*]Hz and 120 [*]Hz, which indicates that the vibration responses of cutterhead are mainly affected by the external excitations. Finally, as the rain-flow counting results have shown, the standard deviation of the cutterhead joint surface loads in each direction increases by 12 – 15 times, compared with that of the external excitations; therefore inertia effect should be considered in cutterhead design. The proposed research lays a foundation for dynamic performance optimization and fatigue crack growth life assessment of cutterhead structure...|$|R

In 1925, Charles and William Gunzelmann filed a patent for a simple rhombus-shaped apparatus where the cards were inserted in an upper chamber. Shaking the device would make the cards fall into a lower compartment; the shuffling was ensured by two small wings {{in the middle of the}} box that would distribute the cards. The operator would then turn the box upside down and repeat the operation. A glass windows permitted seeing that all cards had fallen into the compartment.|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} {{was to create a}} {{flexible}} and robust object localization system for foundry and forging industry. With the help of this object localization system it is possible to automatically grasp objects that are piled up chaotically with a robot. Particle Swarm Optimization, a relatively young field of research for a population based stochastic optimization technique inspired by social behavior of bird flocking or fish schooling, was used to achieve this aim. Starting with the state of the art, typical application scenarios in the foundry and forging industry for grasping objects out of a bin were analyzed and typical requirements and boundary conditions for an object localization system were derived. <b>Gear</b> shafts, <b>inner</b> <b>gears</b> and housing covers served as objects in these application scenarios. Particular attention was paid to the accuracy requirements of the object localization module and the demands on the object description for use with the particle swarm optimization. This analysis provided the requirements of a PSO-based system for object localization. Furthermore, subsystems were defined and the impact of the requirements on the subsystems was discussed. Based on these requirements different possible solutions for the subsystems were analyzed. By combining selected solutions for each subsystem the entire system for object localization was designed. In order to realize the designed system a fundamental study of a knowledge-based method for evaluating a swarm particle with histograms was performed. For this purpose an applicable model of the 3 -D sensor and appropriate histogram creation methods for depth- and normal vector histograms were developed. Furthermore, a tool was created to generate and store required histograms in a knowledge base. This is necessary to adjust the system for object localization to various objects by expanding the knowledge base. To confirm the practical feasibility of the developments and to complete the tests of the designed system, a robot cell was built up. The robot cell was used to show the reliability of the system for object localization. As test objects, gear shafts were used which were taken from a box and placed on the storage position...|$|R

40|$|Industrially-manufactured, {{spiral bevel}} gears with {{complementary}} tooth-end surfaces as a rule have reduced tooth thickness and subsequently reduced strength at the tooth ends. The weakened tooth ends of octoid gearing are generally produced by machining, inevitably resulting in a certain lengthwise dimensional discrepancy and slight profile difference. This in turn very often leads to systematic breakage of teeth. Serious, systematic damage occurs irrespective of the transmission tightness of the outer or <b>inner</b> tooth ends. <b>Gear</b> manufacturers currently use several solutions to avoid such breakages, including artificial inclination near to the teeth or deliberately reducing the back or outer cone angle and increasing the front or root cone angle. This paper outlines an improved design of gear blanks, with optimised tooth ends. Our research concluded {{that it is possible}} to optimise rectangular-generated, spiral bevel pinion/gear pairs with constant tooth height and a common pitch cone apex. We can successfully achieve this through recalculation of the gear blanks, without any changes in the flank geometry or tooth-cutting process. Thus the gear pair with optimised tooth ends can be cut without interference to the customary tooth-cutting process. To prove the concept, an example of the recalculation is provided. These improvements result in increased tooth strength, simplification of the gear blank geometry and more suitable geometry for modern machining, as well as a smaller outer diameter of the gear...|$|R
