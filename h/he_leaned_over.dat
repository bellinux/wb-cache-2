25|$|For years, Cordwainer Smith had {{a pocket}} {{notebook}} {{which he had}} filled with ideas about The Instrumentality and additional stories in the series. But while in a small boat in a lake or bay in the mid 60s, <b>he</b> <b>leaned</b> <b>over</b> the side, and his notebook fell out of his breast pocket into the water, where it was lost forever. Another story claims that he accidentally left the notebook in a restaurant in Rhodes in 1965. With the book gone, he felt empty of ideas, and decided {{to start a new}} series which was an allegory of Mid-Eastern politics.|$|E
2500|$|On 12 January 1921, Elwes {{was killed}} in a horrific {{accident}} at Back Bay railway station in Boston, Massachusetts, {{in the midst of a}} high-profile recital tour of the United States at the height of his powers. Elwes and his wife had alighted on the platform when the singer attempted to return to the conductor an overcoat that had fallen off the train. <b>He</b> <b>leaned</b> <b>over</b> too far and was hit by the train, falling between the moving carriages and the platform. He died of his injuries a few hours later. He was 54 years old. A week after the event, Edward Elgar wrote to Percy Hull, 'my personal loss is greater than I can bear to think upon, but this is nothing – or I must call it so – compared to the general artistic loss – a gap impossible to fill – in the musical world.' ...|$|E
2500|$|Prior to {{the live}} session, Miles Davis had already {{established}} {{a reputation as}} one of the jazz era's top live performers, following well-received performances at such venues as Birdland, also known as [...] "The Jazz Corner of the World", in New York and the Newport Jazz Festival in Rhode Island during the mid-1950s. The set at the Plaza Hotel further expanded Davis' repertoire in concert venues and increased his popularity among jazz fans and writers. Even though Milestones was Davis' first use of modes and Cannonball Adderley's presence helped make the band became a more powerful sextet, these sessions helped introduce Bill Evans to the music of Miles Davis. The May 26 session, in particular, exposed Evans to Davis' spontaneous ability in the studio to simplify complicated musical structures. In a 1979 interview for the jazz radio station WKCR, Evans remarked on his recording experience with Davis, stating [...] "Miles occasionally might say, 'Right here, I want this sound', and it turn out be a very key thing that changes the whole character of the [...] For instance, on 'On Green Dolphin Street', the original changes of the chorus aren't the way : the vamp changes being a major seventh up a minor third, down a half tone. That was [...] <b>he</b> <b>leaned</b> <b>over</b> and said, 'I want this here.'" [...] Evans' influence would be apparent on the Kind of Blue sessions as it was during the initial 1958 sessions. All recorded studio work by Davis from 1958 for Columbia was later reissued on the box set compilation The Complete Columbia Recordings of Miles Davis with John Coltrane. Following the implementation of his first modal compositions with the title track of Milestones and his first sessions with Bill Evans, the 1958 Sessions, Davis became satisfied with the results. This led to his preparation of an entire album based on modality, his 1959 masterwork, Kind of Blue.|$|E

60|$|He {{has nothing}} to say. With a long whispered whistle, he drops into the wicker chair and stares before him like a beggared gambler. But a cunning look soon comes into his face. <b>He</b> <b>leans</b> <b>over</b> towards her on his right elbow, and speaks in a low steady voice.|$|R

60|$|But his harrowed {{mind and}} {{exhausted}} body no longer allowed him even anxiety.

Arundel Dacre rises: <b>he</b> <b>leans</b> <b>over</b> the sufferer's couch.|$|R

6000|$|<b>He</b> <b>leans</b> <b>over</b> {{the table}} toward {{me with an}} evident desire to make himself {{perfectly}} understood.

60|$|But Gouie, being a {{thoughtful}} black man, went away without further talk, {{and did not}} return until the following morning. When <b>he</b> again <b>leaned</b> <b>over</b> the pit Keo was so weak from hunger that he could hardly laugh at all.|$|R
