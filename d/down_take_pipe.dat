60|$|It was in {{this very}} month {{something}} over twenty years ago that I, Ludwig Horace Holly, was sitting one night in my rooms at Cambridge, grinding away at some mathematical work, I forget what. I was to go up for my fellowship within a week, and was expected by my tutor and my college generally to distinguish myself. At last, wearied out, I flung my book down, and, going to the mantelpiece, <b>took</b> <b>down</b> a <b>pipe</b> and filled it. There was a candle burning on the mantelpiece, and a long, narrow glass {{at the back of}} it; and as I was in the act of lighting the pipe I caught sight of my own countenance in the glass, and paused to reflect. The lighted match burnt away till it scorched my fingers, forcing me to drop it; but still I stood and stared at myself in the glass, and reflected.|$|R
60|$|Weston {{took off}} his {{battered}} hat, and, stepping across the platform, {{opened the door of}} the adjoining car. When she had passed through it, he sat <b>down</b> and <b>took</b> out his <b>pipe,</b> with a curious little thrill running through him and his nerves tingling.|$|R
60|$|Jim sat <b>down</b> and <b>took</b> out his <b>pipe.</b> He {{had lost}} his labor and money he could not spare, but it was {{possible}} to run the line across the treacherous belt, although he was half afraid to count the cost. When he struck a match Jake came up and indistinct figures moved in the gloom behind.|$|R

500|$|In another memo, Steinbeck {{noted that}} the pathos of Suzy being a prostitute had given much of the {{dramatic}} tension to the scene in which Doc rejects Suzy, and later, her rejection of him. [...] "I think if you will finally bring {{the theme of this}} play into the open, but wide open, you will have solved its great weakness and have raised it to a high level...

40|$|Abstract. Expansion joints {{are used}} in {{installations}} where axial or angular significant changes occur due to operating conditions: differences temperature, arching, vibration etc. Expansion compensation will <b>take</b> over the <b>pipe</b> stresses, preventing so their destruction. Lenticular compensators <b>take</b> <b>pipe</b> thermal expansions; metal compensators are use for take axial, lateral or angular displacement. This paper presents information regarding the lenticular compensators and calculation procedure of their geometrical characteristics, mainly the number of elements that composed them. An automatic calculation program ”CCRT- Comp Lent ” (computing pipeline heating systems – lenticular compensation) was developed based on fundamental concepts in mechanical calculation of pipes and lenticular compensators. The algorithm of this program is based on determining the pipeline expansion, the total deformation {{and the number of}} the compensation required...|$|R
