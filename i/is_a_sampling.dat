2500|$|Another method uses unit quaternions. Multiplication of {{rotation}} matrices is homomorphic to multiplication of quaternions, and multiplication by a unit quaternion rotates the unit sphere. Since the homomorphism {{is a local}} isometry, we immediately conclude that to produce a uniform distribution on SO(3) we may use a uniform distribution on [...] In practice: create a four-element vector where each element <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>sampling</b> of a normal distribution. Normalize its length {{and you have a}} uniformly sampled random unit quaternion which represents a uniformly sampled random rotation.|$|E
