2500|$|In {{contrast}} to the chronic otitis externa, acute otitis externa (AOE) is predominantly a bacterial infection, occurs suddenly, rapidly worsens, and becomes painful. [...] The ear canal has an abundant nerve supply, so the pain is often severe enough to interfere with sleep. [...] Wax in the ear can combine with the swelling of the canal skin and the associated pus to block the canal and dampen hearing, creating a temporary conductive hearing loss. In more severe or untreated cases, the infection can spread to the soft tissues of the face that surround the adjacent parotid gland and the jaw <b>joint,</b> <b>making</b> chewing painful. In its mildest forms, otitis externa is so common that some {{ear nose and throat}} physicians have suggested that most people will have at least a brief episode at some point in life. While a small percentage of people seem to have an innate tendency toward chronic otitis externa, most people can avoid otitis externa altogether once they understand the intricate mechanisms of the disease.|$|E

50|$|The MPFL is {{the primary}} {{stabilizer}} to lateral displacement of the patella providing approximately 50-60% of restraining force. Injury to the MPFL is most common during a non-contact twisting action. The most likely time for the patella to shift laterally is during the first 20-30 degrees of flexion as the quadriceps tighten simultaneously and pull the patella laterally. Beyond 30 degrees, the quadriceps tendon and patellar ligament pull the patella posterior into the groove of the knee <b>joint</b> <b>making</b> lateral dislocation of the patella unlikely.|$|E

50|$|The Nimrod R1 fleet, {{owing to}} its {{significantly}} reduced level of usage {{compared to the}} MR2, was originally intended to remain in service {{for an extended period}} into the 2010s, with a major systems upgrade codenamed Project HELIX. This would have seen the aircraft's own systems, ground stations and training facilities improved, with work starting in 2007. However, in October 2008, the UK Government made a request into the possibility of procuring new aircraft for the SIGINT mission, specifically the RC-135 Rivet Joint, under a new project codenamed Airseeker. In 2009, with the plan for the Rivet <b>Joint</b> <b>making</b> progress, one of 51 Squadron's three Nimrods was withdrawn from service {{to be used as a}} spares source for the remaining two. The purchase of three RC-135 aircraft was confirmed in March 2010, with the Nimrod intended to be withdrawn immediately. This was postponed due to the requirement for SIGINT during Operation Ellamy.

50|$|A biceps slicer (also {{called a}} biceps lock or biceps crusher) is a {{compression}} lock that involves pressing the biceps into the humerus. An effective biceps slicer {{can be applied}} by putting an arm or leg as a fulcrum on the opponent's arm at {{the inside of the}} arm by the elbow, and flexing the opponent's arm over the fulcrum. This will result in the biceps and forearm being pressed into the fulcrum. The biceps slicer becomes most effective as a compression lock when the bony parts of the limb such as the shin or any of the bones in the forearm are forced into the biceps of the opponent. The biceps slicer can also become a potent armlock when it is applied in this manner, because the leverage causes an elongating and separating tension in the elbow <b>joint,</b> <b>making</b> this a legal technique in judo competition. In Brazilian jiu-jitsu competitions however, the biceps slicer is an illegal technique in lower level divisions of some major tournaments. In catch wrestling biceps slicer variation is called short-arm scissors.|$|E

50|$|The hip is {{essentially}} a ball and socket joint. It consists {{of the head of}} the femur (the ball) and the acetabulum (the socket). Both the ball and socket are congruous and covered with hyaline (or articular) cartilage, which allows smooth, almost frictionless gliding between the two surfaces. The edge of the acetabulum is surrounded by the acetabular labrum, a fibrous structure that envelops the femoral head. (See fig. 1) The labrum acts as a seal, or gasket, around the femoral head. However, this is not its only function, as it has been shown to contain nerve endings, which may cause pain if damaged. The blood supply of the labrum has also been demonstrated. The joint itself is encompassed by a thick, fibrous joint capsule, which is lined by synovium. The ligaments that keep the hip joint in place are in fact, thickened areas of joint capsule, rather than distinct structures. The synovium generates fluid that lubricates the joint; in that fluid are the nutrients needed to keep the cartilage cells alive. A total of 27 muscles cross the hip <b>joint,</b> <b>making</b> it a very deep part of the body for arthroscopic access. This is one reason why hip arthroscopy can be quite technically demanding.|$|E

30|$|As {{its name}} implies, the {{interphalangeal}} joint sesamoid is {{seen at the}} plantar aspect of the interphalangeal (IP) joint of the first digit of the foot. It is embedded within the joint capsule {{and the presence of}} an ossified sesamoid may alter biomechanics and limit motion in the joint [5]. The prevalence of this sesamoid has been reported variably at 2 – 13  % in its ossified form [4]. A review of post-mortem cases reports an anatomically identified IP joint nodule in up to 73  % of cases [6]. These bones are best imaged on an AP radiograph of the foot or toes. A potential serious pathology associated with this sesamoid is its interposition into a dislocated IP <b>joint,</b> <b>making</b> it irreducible [7, 8].|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Whole-arm {{tactile sensing}} enables a robot to sense {{properties}} of contact across its entire arm. By using this large sensing area, a robot {{has the potential}} to acquire useful infor-mation from incidental contact that occurs while performing a task. Within this paper, we demonstrate that data-driven methods can be used to infer mechanical properties of objects from incidental contact with a robot’s forearm. We collected data from a tactile-sensing forearm as it made contact with various objects during a simple reaching motion. We then used hidden Markov models (HMMs) to infer two object properties (rigid vs. soft and fixed vs. movable) based on low-dimensional features of time-varying tactile sensor data (maximum force, contact area, and contact motion). A key issue {{is the extent to which}} data-driven methods can generalize to robot actions that differ from those used during training. To investigate this issue, we developed an idealized mechanical model of a robot with a compliant <b>joint</b> <b>making</b> contact with an object. This model provides intuition for the classification problem. We also conducted tests in which we varied the robot arm’s velocity and joint stiffness. We found that, in contrast to our previous methods [1], multivariate HMMs achieved high cross-validation accuracy and successfully generalized what they had learned to new robot motions with distinct velocities and joint stiffnesses...|$|E

A key {{issue is the}} extent to which the performance of data-driven methods can generalize to robot actions that differ from those used during training. To investigate this, we developed an idealized physics-based lumped element model of a robot with a compliant <b>joint</b> <b>making</b> contact with an object. Using this physics-based model, we performed experiments with varied robot, object and environment parameters. We also collected data from a tactile-sensing forearm on a real robot as it made contact with various objects during a simple reaching motion with varied arm velocities and joint stiffnesses. The robot used one nearest neighbor classifiers (1 -NN), hidden Markov models (HMMs), and long short-term memory (LSTM) networks to infer two object properties (hard vs. soft and moved vs. unmoved) based on features of time-varying tactile sensor data (maximum force, contact area, and contact motion). We found that, in contrast to 1 -NN, the performance of LSTMs (with sufficient data availability) and multivariate HMMs successfully generalized to new robot motions with distinct velocities and joint stiffnesses. Compared to single features, using multiple features gave the best results for both experiments with physics-based models and a real-robot.
