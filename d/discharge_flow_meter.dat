40|$|Abstract:Measurement of flow is an {{important}} aspect {{in the field of}} hydraulic engineering, both in case of open channel as well as pipe or conduits. In case of pipe conduits various <b>flow</b> <b>meters</b> are used for flow estimation; out of which venturimeter and orifice meter are most commonly used and conventional means. Pipes or conduit carrying sediment laden flow or slurry-water mixture is very common in most of the industries, sewage carrying system etc. Suitability of <b>flow</b> <b>meters</b> i. e. venturimeter and <b>flow</b> <b>meter</b> need to be analyzed for sediment laden flow. Due to the presence of slurry or sediments, coefficient of <b>discharge</b> of <b>flow</b> <b>meter</b> will vary. In the present paper, various works that have been carried out till now in the analysis of characteristics of venturimeter and orifice meter with sediment laden flow are described...|$|R
40|$|Development {{process of}} {{reciprocating}} compressors can be simplified by using simulation tools. Modelling of a compressor requires a trade-off between computational effort {{and accuracy of}} desired results. This paper presents experimental validation of the simulation tool, {{which can be used}} to predict compressor behaviour under different working conditions. The mathematical model provides fast results with very good accuracy, however the model must be calibrated for a certain type of compressor. Small air compressor was used to validate an in-house simulation tool, which is based on mass and energy conservation in a control volume. The simulation tool calculates pressure and temperature history inside the cylinder, valve characteristics, mass flow and heat losses during the cycle of the compressor. A test bench for the compressor consisted of pressure sensors on both discharge and suction side, temperature sensor on <b>discharge</b> side and <b>flow</b> <b>meter</b> with calorimetric principle sensor...|$|R

The abrasiveness of slurry and interaction of solid particles with the carrier liquid make slurry flow measurement {{one of the most}} challenging applications in multi-phase <b>flow</b> <b>metering.</b> This paper presents a new method of solid-liquid <b>flow</b> <b>metering,</b> in which the Electrical Resistance Tomography (ERT) is used in combination with a commercial Electromagnetic <b>Flow</b> <b>Meter</b> (EMF) to measure the volumetric flow rate of each phase. A set of experiments were carried out using a mixture of sand particles and tap water as slurry. Two different sand types (coarse and medium), with a particle size range of 53 - 2330 μm, were pumped through a 50 mm inner-diameter pipeline. The range of throughput solids concentration used in the experiments was 5 %- 10 % and operated the transport velocity was 2 - 5 m/s. The effect of solids concentration and solids velocity on the measurement scheme is discussed. The measurement results are compared to that of Coriolis mass <b>flow</b> <b>meter</b> and <b>discharge</b> <b>flow</b> measurement system (flow diversion system). The accuracy of the measurement results is assessed and the performance of the applicability of the proposed method is highlighted...|$|R
40|$|Fluid venting {{from the}} toe of the accretionary prism off Oregon was {{measured}} in situ during a series of dives with DSRV Alvin in 1987 and 1988. A benthic chamber was placed over active vent sites to sequentially collect samples of venting fluids and to make direct measurements of <b>discharge</b> rates. Calibrated <b>flow</b> <b>meter</b> measurements and <b>flow</b> rates determined from dissolved methane transfer indicate that discharge from two vent sites, Alvin 1428 and Alvin 1900, ranges roughly between 100 and 500 L m− 2 d− 1. with the most reliable estimates falling {{in the range of}} 125 – 150 L m− 2 d− 1. These rates imply subsurface advective flow on the order of 100 m yr− 1. Comparison of observed discharge rates with rates calculated for steady state expulsion supported by accretion-related compaction indicates that the observed flow is greater than predicted flow by several orders of magnitude. The disparity dictates that fluids are not derived locally, but are transported laterally within the prism, or that flow is not steady state and that individual vents are short-lived features in the ongoing accretion process...|$|R
40|$|In {{pressure}} irrigation-water distribution networks, {{pressure regulating}} devices for controlling the <b>discharged</b> <b>flow</b> rate by irrigation units are needed {{due to the}} variability of flow rate. In addition, applied water volume is used controlled operating the valve during a calculated time interval, and assuming constant flow rate. In general, a pressure regulating valve PRV is the commonly used pressure regulating device in a hydrant, which, also, executes the open and close function. A hydrant feeds several irrigation units, requiring a wide range in flow rate. In addition, some <b>flow</b> <b>meters</b> are also available, one {{as a component of}} the hydrant and the rest are placed downstream. Every land owner has one <b>flow</b> <b>meter</b> for each group of field plots downstream the hydrant. Its lecture could be used for refining the water balance but its accuracy must be taken into account. Ideal PRV performance would maintain a constant downstream pressure. However, the true performance depends on both upstream pressure and the <b>discharged</b> <b>flow</b> rate. The objective of this work is to asses the influence of the performance on the applied volume during the whole irrigation events in a year. The results of the study have been obtained introducing the flow rate into a PRV model. Variations on flow rate are simulated by taking into account the consequences of variations on climate conditions and also decisions in irrigation operation, such us duration and frequency application. The model comprises continuity, dynamic and energy equations of the components of the PRV...|$|R

When changing oxygen <b>flow</b> <b>meters,</b> we have observed that sometimes, even with the same oxygen flow setting as before, a different S-pO 2 is obtained. OBJECTIVE: To analyze the precision and accuracy of <b>flow</b> <b>meters</b> used in hospital settings. METHODS: An experimental study was performed to test oxygen <b>flow</b> <b>meters</b> from a tertiary hospital, by using a calibrated flow analyzer. Used and new <b>flow</b> <b>meter</b> accuracy was tested by reading in the gas analyzer a single measurement at flow rates of 1, 3, 5, and 10 L/min in 91 <b>flow</b> <b>meters,</b> and they were compared using the Student t test or Mann-Whitney U test. <b>Flow</b> <b>meter</b> precision was tested by reading in the flow analyzer 3 repetitive measurements set at flow rates of 1, 3, 5, and 10 L/min in 11 <b>flow</b> <b>meters,</b> and the reproducibility of these measurements was conducted by using the intraclass correlation coefficient and the Friedman test. RESULTS: the mean measured flow rates were slightly lower than the stipulated flow rate at 1 L/min, very close for 3 L/min, and higher for the 5 and 10 L/min flow rates. There was a large variability among the measurements from different <b>flow</b> <b>meters,</b> mainly at low flow rates (1 and 3 L/min). There {{was no difference between}} new and used <b>flow</b> <b>meters</b> at the <b>flow</b> rates measured, except at 10 L/min. <b>Flow</b> <b>meters</b> precision analysis showed a good reproducibility in 3 repetitive measurements for each flow rate (minimum 0. 95, maximum 0. 99 intraclass correlations).

40|$|Balanced <b>flow</b> <b>meters</b> are recent {{additions}} to an established class of simple, rugged <b>flow</b> <b>meters</b> that contain no moving parts {{in contact with}} flow and are based on measurement of pressure drops across objects placed in flow paths. These <b>flow</b> <b>meters</b> are highly accurate, minimally intrusive, easily manufacturable, and reliable. A balanced <b>flow</b> <b>meter</b> can be easily mounted in a flow path by bolting it between conventional pipe flanges. A balanced <b>flow</b> <b>meter</b> {{can be used to}} measure the flow of any of a variety of liquids or gases, provided that it has been properly calibrated. Relative to the standard orifice-plate <b>flow</b> <b>meter,</b> the balanced <b>flow</b> <b>meter</b> introduces less turbulence and two times less permanent pressure loss and is therefore capable of offering 10 times greater accuracy and repeatability with less dissipation of energy. A secondary benefit of the reduction of turbulence is the reduction of vibration and up to 15 times less acoustic noise generation. Both the balanced <b>flow</b> <b>meter</b> and the standard orifice-plate <b>flow</b> <b>meter</b> are basically disks that contain holes and are instrumented with pressure transducers on their upstream and downstream faces. The most obvious difference between them is that the standard orifice plate contains a single, central hole while the balanced <b>flow</b> <b>meter</b> contains multiple holes. The term 'balanced' signifies that in designing the meter, the sizes and locations of the holes are determined in an optimization procedure that involves balancing of numerous factors, including volumetric flow, mass flow, dynamic pressure, kinetic energy, all in an effort to minimize such undesired effects as turbulence, pressure loss, dissipation of kinetic energy, and non-repeatability and nonlinearity of response over the anticipated range of flow conditions.

All tests were performed in a <b>flow</b> <b>meter</b> calibration facility and in a flow range including the minimum and maximum flow of each <b>flow</b> <b>meter.</b> In the tests three different water tempera-tures and three different installations were investigated. Water temperatures of 20 °C, 50 °C and 70 °C were used. These temperatures are representative for district heating applications.

All set-ups are in accordance with the <b>flow</b> <b>meter</b> specifications.

The change from 20 °C to 50 °C and 70 °C can cause a shift in meter performance larger than the specified maximum permissible error. Compared with the ideal installation the installations generating disturbed flow profiles cause errors up to more than 2 %. The errors due to temperature and installation effects have a bias to add when combined. This might lead to even larger errors.
