40|$|Given {{that alcohol}} remains a <b>heavily</b> <b>taxed</b> <b>good,</b> {{studies of the}} demand for alcohol are {{numerous}} in the literature. This paper uses annual data from 1964 - 92 to estimate key elasticities of the US demand for distilled spirits. Unlike previous studies, which typically assume elasticities are constant over time, we allow elasticities to vary over time by estimating a gradual switching regression model. The {{results indicate that the}} demand for distilled spirits today differs substantially from the 1960 s, suggesting that the efficacy of proposed policies is dependent on knowledge of this change in demand. ...|$|R
40|$|Two-sided {{platform}} 8 ̆ 5 rms serve distinct customer {{groups that}} are connected through interdependent demand, and include major busi-nesses such as the media industry, banking, and the software industry. A well known result of tax incidence is that consumers of a more heav-ily <b>taxed</b> <b>good</b> pay a higher price and thus consume less of the good. The present paper shows that this result need not hold in a two-sided market. On the contrary, consumers may actually buy more of a good sold by a two-sided platform 8 ̆ 5 rm if the tax rate increases. In particu-lar, a higher ad valorem tax may not only lower the end-user price of the more <b>heavily</b> <b>taxed</b> <b>good,</b> but also the price charged to the other customer group. Hence, a platform may not engage in tax shifting via price increases at all...|$|R

A well known result of tax incidence is that consumers of a more <b>heavily</b> <b>taxed</b> <b>good</b> pay a higher price and thus buy less of the good. The present paper shows that this result need not hold in a two-sided market. On the contrary, a higher ad valorem tax may lower end-user prices and spur sales. Thus, two-sided platform firms may not at all engage in tax shifting via price increases. We further show that a higher ad valorem tax may undermine a firm’s incentive to differentiate its product from that of its competitors.

50|$|Brazil is the 13th largest {{video game}} {{market in the}} world as of 2017, and the largest in Latin America, with a revenue of 1,3 billion US dollars. Video games were not {{permitted}} for import into Brazil until the 1990s, and were then <b>heavily</b> <b>taxed</b> as non-essential <b>goods.</b> As a result, a black market developed around pirating games, driven by the lack of official channels for purchasing games. Many game companies avoided expansion into the country for these reasons. Blaming high tariffs, Nintendo officially left the market in 2015, but returned in 2017. Sega once retained a strong foothold in the country. In a series of videos, Red Bull explored the country's relation with gaming.|$|R
