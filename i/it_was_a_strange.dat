25|$|Opened in July 1967 to {{coincide}} with BBC Two's switch to colour. It {{was the first to}} be equipped with colour cameras. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>strange</b> design: it was originally to be split in two by a large removable wall, but this idea was abandoned. The gallery was moved in 1993 and the old gallery became home to the BBC Red Button control room. Upgraded to HD in July 2010, the first 3D capable studio in the UK. Home to children's programmes Live & Kicking and Dick and Dom in da Bungalow, and Pointless. This studio was demolished during the redevelopment of Television Centre.|$|E
500|$|I saw a {{video on}} YouTube. [...] had a plain {{background}} {{and it was}} shot on the crane; it was 360 degrees, they could move around. And I said, 'This is genius.' We kept {{a lot of the}} Fosse choreography and added the down-south thing—it's called J-Setting, where one person does something and the next person follows. So <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>strange</b> mixture...It's like the most urban choreography, mixed with Fosse—very modern and very vintage.|$|E
500|$|... (<b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>strange</b> battle, {{that death}} and life waged), {{is the center}} of the {{symmetrical}} structure. It is sung by the four voices, accompanied only by the continuo. The alto sings the cantus firmus, transposed by a fifth to B-Dorian, while the other voices follow each other in a fugal stretto with entries just a beat apart until they fall away one by one. In the final Halleluja in all four voices, the bass descends nearly two octaves.|$|E
25|$|The logo {{presents}} {{a problem in}} topology. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>strange</b> loop or rendered as a puzzle.|$|R
6000|$|... 'A beggar {{would be}} no novelty,' said Steerforth; 'but <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>strange</b> thing that the beggar should take that shape tonight.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But {{he thinks}} <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>strange,</b> {{misplaced}} liking, exaggerated by pity for one sunk so low?" [...] said Rachel, in an excited manner.|$|R
500|$|... "First and {{foremost}} I {{thought it was}} a good record. It was poppy and catchy and perfect for the summer. I think my core audience is young teenage girls and gay guys. Both of those groups tend to like pure pop music and I think that's what 'Chico' was. It was very different from the slightly leftfield style of 'Look at Me'. [...] The other thing that 'Chico' had going for it was that the music was Latin-based, I had written the song back in 1998 but by the time the summer of 1999 came around Latin-influenced music was ruling the charts. Ricky Martin had recently had a number one and there were others on the way. So <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>strange</b> example of synchronicity that I should be ready to go with a Latin track which I had written almost a year before".|$|E
500|$|Lia Vollack, Sony Pictures's President of Music, called Chris Cornell {{inviting}} {{him to make}} a song for the new Bond movie, which would [...] "reflect the dramatic new direction of James Bond", with a [...] "strong male singer". Cornell thought <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>strange</b> offer, considering that he is American, and imagined that he would perform a secondary song in the film instead of the main theme. Cornell declared he liked the Bond movies, particularly the ones with Sean Connery, but that he [...] "wasn't really a big fan of the last several movies". But Daniel Craig's casting as James Bond intrigued the musician, and he decided to accept the job. Cornell then went to Prague to visit the film's shooting, and was much impressed with the film's emotional content after he was shown a rough cut of Casino Royale. In Prague he also met the score composer, David Arnold, who suggested writing a song [...] "that echoed the film score".|$|E
500|$|While the Tower {{may have}} been [...] "the only {{possible}} place", in some respects <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>strange</b> choice. It had not {{been used as a}} state prison for many years and the last execution there– that of Lord Lovat, the Jacobite rebel– had taken place in 1747. It was one of London's most popular tourist attractions, recording over 400,000 visitors a year {{by the end of the}} 19th century, and remained open to tourists even on the day of Lody's execution. During the Tower's heyday, executions had been carried out in the open air on Tower Hill or Tower Green, but Lody's execution was to take place at the Tower's rifle range located in the eastern part of the Outer Ward between Martin and Constable Towers, behind the Outer Curtain wall and out of public sight. The Tower's custodians, the Yeomen Warders ("Beefeaters"), had long since become tourist guides rather than active-duty soldiers, so eight men were selected from the 3rd Battalion, to carry out the sentence.|$|E
6000|$|Lord Martindale breathed more freely. 'Forgive me {{for putting}} the question, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>strange</b> one to ask now: were you really {{attached}} to Percy Fotheringham?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "He said <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>strange</b> {{case and}} that he will watch it closely. I heard him say to the nurse to watch Tom very closely." ...|$|R
5000|$|<b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>strange</b> thing, nevertheless, that confessors {{could neither}} {{understand}} me nor set my mind at peace concerning these matters, until I met father Andrasz and, later on, father Sopoćko. (111) ...|$|R
2500|$|... "The problem lay buried, unspoken, {{for many}} years in the minds of American women. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>strange</b> stirring, a sense of dissatisfaction, a yearning [...] that women {{suffered}} {{in the middle of the}} 20th century in the United States. Each suburban wife struggled with it alone. As she made the beds, shopped for groceries … she was afraid to ask even of herself the silent question — 'Is this all?" ...|$|E
2500|$|According to Gilliam, {{there was}} no firm budget in place when filming started. Cinematographer Gilliam {{felt that it was}} not a well-organized film and said, [...] "Certain people didn't... I'm not going to name names but <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>strange</b> film, like one leg was shorter than the other. There was all sorts of chaos." [...] While Depp was on {{location}} in Los Angeles, he got a phone call from comedian Bill Murray who had played Thompson in Where the Buffalo Roam. He warned Depp, [...] "Be careful or you'll find yourself ten years from now still doing him… Make sure your next role is some drastically different guy." ...|$|E
2500|$|One of Crosby's songwriting {{contributions}} to the album, [...] "What's Happening?!?!", began his penchant for writing abstract songs asking irresoluble questions, a trend that has continued throughout his career with Crosby, Stills & Nash and as a solo artist. During a 1966 interview, Crosby admitted that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>strange</b> song, noting [...] "It asks questions of what's going on here and who does it all belong to {{and why is it}} all going on. I just ask the questions because I really don't know the answers." [...] Like [...] "Eight Miles High", the song exhibits the strong influence of Indian classical music with its droning guitar and melody. [...] "What's Happening?!?!" [...] is also notable for being the first song written solely by Crosby to appear on a Byrds' record.|$|E
6000|$|... "O mighty Jeddak, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>strange</b> tale I read in {{the dead}} minds of your {{faithful}} guardsmen. They were felled not {{by a number of}} fighting men, but by a single opponent." ...|$|R
60|$|As {{one goes}} among the Bavarian uplands and foothills, soon one realizes here <b>is</b> another land, <b>a</b> <b>strange</b> religion. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>strange</b> country, remote, out of contact. Perhaps {{it belongs to}} the forgotten, {{imperial}} processions.|$|R
6000|$|... "There wouldn't be {{anything}} to be afraid of," [...] said the Story Girl reassuringly. [...] "It's not as if <b>it</b> <b>were</b> <b>a</b> <b>strange</b> ghost. <b>It's</b> our own family ghost, so of course it wouldn't hurt us." ...|$|R
2500|$|All of {{a sudden}} we had two Australian teams on one tour... I {{certainly}} felt excluded... At one stage in England I was waiting in a bar for my teammates to come downstairs, but because everyone was up the street with Packer, they never came... I was certainly disappointed to be left out. At that stage I think I had played nine Tests and was averaging 40 and you had other people who were barely Shield cricketers being called up by Packer. I didn't know the reasons why those guys were in it and I wasn't. That is always a question I will wonder about. I certainly kept being mates with Hookesy... <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>strange</b> feeling. There were times when we were there to play for Australia and some blokes were off at a meeting about something else. There were times when there were arguments in the bar that got a lot louder than what they should have been.|$|E
2500|$|Critics overall {{have mixed}} {{opinions}} on the game. McCormick felt that while the gameplay was subpar, Alpha Protocol is a captivating [...] "spy simulation" [...] which has a compelling and personal story. Tan thought that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>strange</b> hybrid with disappointing and average gameplay but provocative RPG systems. He concluded that the game is a divisive title. Many critics thought that the game needs a sequel to improve its shortcomings. Onyett thought that the game had the foundation to be entertaining, but numerous gameplay faults undermined its potential. VanOrd described the game as a [...] "5,000-piece jigsaw puzzle with 500 pieces missing", and felt that while the game was ambitious, it was incomplete and the gameplay faults were too significant to be ignored. Sterling noticed the game's ambition but felt that there were execution problems and severe fundamental faults that tarnish the experience. Donlan felt that the game can steadily win players over, {{despite the fact that}} the game will constantly frustrate players.|$|E
2500|$|The Sun Dance {{evolved into}} a War Dance to protest the white man invasion. “A big hullabaloo came {{with the arrival of}} Vice President of the United States Charles Curtis and a long line of motor cars loaded with {{newspaper}} reporters, camera men and politicians. [...] They interrupted the ceremonies, offending the performers so that they refused to continue for the gratification of the movie-men. They were many Indian votes short in the following election. [...] This white man invasion disturbed things {{for the rest of the}} session, resulting in the Omahas and Pottowattomies joining in an “exhibition” war dance. [...] Soon, the Utes, Cheyennes, Arapahos, Crows, Blackfeet, Pawnees and the rest all collected for a grand intertribal dance on the vacant section behind the show grounds. [...] Qualified observers said there were ten thousand taking part in this mammoth demonstration. [...] It was kept up until darkness shut it from view. [...] <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>strange,</b> an altogether unheard of thing to witness, thrilling to a degree to turn one’s head and leave him atremble between joy and sorrow. [...] It was marvelous to behold!” ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Perhaps," [...] {{she went}} on, [...] "I shall break my oath. Indeed, I have already broken it. Let {{me look at}} you, my husband. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>strange</b> thing to own after all these years--a husband." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Fond of society, rather," [...] {{observed}} Captain Guy, {{who came}} on deck at the moment, [...] "the poor creatures cannot bear to <b>be</b> left alone. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>strange</b> quality in dogs which I have often observed before." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I am to {{wait here}} for Serjeant Gaythorn," [...] {{observed}} the little damsel somewhat consequentially. [...] "Well! <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>strange</b> little makeshift of a place, but 'tis the fortune of war, and I {{have been in}} worse." ...|$|R
2500|$|... "It was Monsieur Haussmann who {{impressed}} me the most. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>strange</b> thing, {{but it was}} less his talents and his remarkable intelligence that appealed to me, but the defects in his character. I had {{in front of me}} one of the most extraordinary men of our time; big, strong, vigorous, energetic, {{and at the same time}} clever and devious, with a spirit full of resources. [...] This audacious man wasn't afraid to show who he was.... He told me all of his accomplishments during his administrative career, leaving out nothing; he could have talked for six hours without a break, since it was his favourite subject, himself. I wasn't at all displeased.... It seemed to me that he was exactly the man I needed to fight against the ideas and prejudices of a whole school of economics, against devious people and skeptics coming from the Stock Market, against those who were not very scrupulous about their methods; he was just the man. [...] Whereas a gentleman of the most elevated spirit, cleverness, with the most straight and noble character, would inevitably fail, this vigorous athlete... full of audacity and skill, capable of opposing expedients with better expedients, traps with more clever traps, would certainly succeed. I told him about the Paris works and offered to put him in charge." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{first time}} Albarn went to Mali, {{he was taken}} to a {{landfill}} where he saw people [...] "taking every little bit, a little bit of fabric to the fabric regenerators, or the metal and the cans to the ironsmiths and the aluminium recyclers, and it goes on and {{by the time you get}} to the road, they're selling stuff." [...] When Albarn went to a landfill outside London to record the sound of seagulls for the album, he noticed a [...] between the way the two countries dealt with rubbish. [...] "They've got more snakes... like adders, grass snakes, slow worms, toads, frogs, newts, all kinds of rodents, all kinds of squirrels, a massive number of squirrels, foxes, and obviously, seagulls. [...] This is part of the new ecology. And for the first time I saw the world in a new way. I've always felt, I'm trying to get across on this new record, the idea that plastic, we see it as being against nature but it's come out of nature. We didn't create plastic, nature created plastic. And just seeing the snakes like living in the warmth of decomposing plastic bags. They like it. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>strange</b> kind of optimism that I felt... but trying to get that into pop music is a challenge, anyway. But important." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>strange</b> {{clicking}} {{noise in the}} distance not unlike castanets.|$|E
60|$|<b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>strange</b> {{fact that}} {{three-fourths of the}} Company's {{servants}} are Scotch Highlanders and Orkneymen. There are very few Irishmen, and still fewer English. A great number, however, are half-breeds and French Canadians, especially among the labourers and voyageurs.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>strange</b> place," [...] {{said the}} guide, {{checking}} his mule; [...] "moreover, we must {{spend the night}} under its shadow, for <b>it</b> <b>is</b> impossible to reach a better place of shelter to-night; and, by good fortune, yonder is something fresh for supper." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>It</b> <b>is</b> very wearisome, {{sitting in}} a chair. The weeks pass, the months come and go, the seasons change, the {{servants}} replace each other, while I remain. I only remain. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>strange</b> life I lead, but at least I am at peace.|$|R
60|$|<b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>strange</b> recital, and a {{fascinating}} one {{to those who}} heard it.|$|E
60|$|When the two {{boats were}} beached upon the silvery sand <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>strange</b> {{assortment}} of humanity that clambered ashore.|$|E
60|$|<b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>strange</b> and {{beautiful}} sight {{to see the}} solemn George capering thus {{in the midst of}} that storm-swept desolation.|$|E
6000|$|... "Good luck to ye!" [...] cried Roy, {{grasping}} it {{and shaking}} {{it with a}} feeling of hearty hospitality. [...] "It's good to see yer face, though <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>strange</b> un; but--hallo!--I say--yer face ain't so strange, after all!-- what! Why, you're not Wap--Wap--Wapaw!" ...|$|R
5000|$|Point Franklin {{was named}} by British mariner Frederick William Beechey on August 15, 1826 after Lieutenant (afterwards Sir) John Franklin. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>strange</b> {{coincidence}} that he named this cape {{just two days}} after Sir John Franklin had named his [...] "farthest point" [...] after Captain Beechey.|$|R
5000|$|Igra: - A land [...] "beyond {{the great}} {{northern}} desert. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>strange</b> place, where all magic is taboo and punishable by death. Yet those who watch for and punish magicians are magicians themselves. They steal {{the children of}} those they execute {{in order to maintain}} their numbers." ...|$|R
