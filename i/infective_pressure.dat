40|$|Abstract Background Within {{the last}} 25 years, after the {{introduction}} of the swimbladder nematode Anguillicoloides crassus from East-Asia to Europe, a body of work has aggregated on the host parasite interactions in the acquired host Anguilla anguilla. Despite the emerging evolutionary interest there is still a lack of knowledge about host parasite relations of A. crassus in its natural host Anguilla japonica. We examined the Anguillicoloides infections of wild-caught Japanese eels as well as from aquacultured specimens in Taiwan with respect to the fate of migratory L 3 larvae and performed infection experiments with Japanese eels. Results Inside the intestinal wall of cultured eels, where the <b>infective</b> <b>pressure</b> was higher than among wild eels, we found large numbers of granuloma-like cysts. In a few eels these cysts contained nematodes still recognizable as L 3 larvae of A. crassus, while in most cases the content of these capsules was degraded to amorphous matter. Occurrence of these objects was correlated with the number of encapsulated larvae in the swimbladder wall. We were able to show, that the cysts contained disintegrated L 3 larvae by amplification and subsequent sequencing of large subunit ribosomal rRNA. Furthermore we identified repeated infections with high doses of larvae as prerequisites for the processes of encapsulation in infection experiments. Conclusion Under high <b>infective</b> <b>pressure</b> a large percentage of L 3 larvae of A. crassus coming from the gut lumen are eliminated by the natural host within its intestinal tissue. It is possible to reproduce this condition in infection experiments. We provide a fast, easy and reliable PCR-based method for identification of encapsulated swimbladder parasites. </p...|$|E
40|$|Clonally complex infections by Mycobacterium {{tuberculosis}} are {{progressively more}} accepted. Studies of their dimension in epidemiological scenarios where the <b>infective</b> <b>pressure</b> is not high are scarce. Our study systematically searched for clonally complex infections (mixed infections {{by more than}} one strain and simultaneous presence of clonal variants) by applying mycobacterial interspersed repetitive-unit (MIRU) –variable-number tandem-repeat (VNTR) analysis to M. tuberculosis isolates from two population-based samples of respiratory (703 cases) and respiratory-extrapulmonary (R+E) tuberculosis (TB) cases (71 cases) in a context of moderate TB incidence. Clonally complex infections were found in 11 (1. 6 %) of the respiratory TB cases and in 10 (14. 1 %) of those with R+E TB. Among the 21 cases with clonally complex TB, 9 were infected by 2 independent strains and the remaining 12 showed the simultaneous presence of 2 to 3 clonal variants. For the 10 R+E TB cases with clonally complex infections, compartmentalization (different compositions of strains/clonal variants in independent infected sites) was found in 9 of them. All the strains/clonal variants were also genotyped by IS 6110 -based restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis, which split two MIRU-defined clonal variants, although in general, it showed a lower discriminatory power to identify the clonal heterogeneity revealed by MIRU-VNTR analysis. The comparative analysis of IS 6110 insertion sites between coinfecting clonal variants showed differences in the genes coding for a cutinase, a PPE family protein, and two conserved hypothetical proteins. Diagnostic delay, existence of previous TB, risk for overexposure, and clustered/orphan status of the involved strains were analyzed to propose possible explanations for the cases with clonally complex infections. Our study characterizes in detail all the clonally complex infections by M. tuberculosis found in a systematic survey and contributes to the characterization that these phenomena can be found to an extent higher than expected, even in an unselected population-based sample lacking high <b>infective</b> <b>pressure...</b>|$|E
40|$|Since {{influenza}} {{in humans}} {{is a major}} public health threat, the understanding of its dynamics and evolution, and improved prediction of its epidemics are important aims. Underlying its multi-strain structure is the evolutionary process of antigenic drift whereby epitope mutations give mutant virions a selective advantage. While there is substantial understanding of the molecular mechanisms of antigenic drift, until now {{there has been no}} quantitative analysis of this process at the population level. The aim {{of this study is to}} develop a predictive model that is of a modest-enough structure to be fitted to time series data on weekly flu incidence. We observe that the rate of antigenic drift is highly non-uniform and identify several years where there have been antigenic surges where a new strain substantially increases <b>infective</b> <b>pressure.</b> The SIR-S approach adopted here can also be shown to improve forecasting in comparison to conventional methods.

It is indicated in hydrocephalus secondary to congenital aqueductal stenosis, posterior third ventricle tumor, cerebellar infarct, Dandy-Walker malformation, vein of Galen aneurism, syringomyelia with or without Chiari malformation type I, intraventricular hematoma, post <b>infective,</b> normal <b>pressure</b> hydrocephalus, myelomeningocele, multiloculated hydrocephalus, encephalocele, posterior fossa tumor and craniosynostosis. It is also indicated in block shunt or slit ventricle syndrome. Proper Pre-operative imaging for detailed assessment of the posterior communicating arteries distance from mid line, {{presence or absence of}} Liliequist membrane or other membranes, located in the prepontine cistern is useful. Measurement of lumbar elastance and resistance can predict patency of cranial subarachnoid space and complex hydrocephalus, which decides an ultimate outcome. Water jet dissection is an effective technique of ETV in thick floor. Ultrasonic contact probe can be useful in selected patients. Intra-operative ventriculo-stomography could help in confirming the adequacy of endoscopic procedure, thereby facilitating the need for shunt. Intraoperative observations of the patent aqueduct and prepontine cistern scarring are predictors of the risk of ETV failure. Such patients may be considered for shunt surgery. Magnetic resonance ventriculography and cine phase contrast magnetic resonance imaging are effective in assessing subarachnoid space and stoma patency after ETV. Proper case selection, post-operative care including monitoring of ICP and need for external ventricular drain, repeated lumbar puncture and CSF drainage, Ommaya reservoir in selected patients could help to increase success rate and reduce complications. Most of the complications develop in an early post-operative, but fatal complications can develop late which indicate an importance of long term follow up...|$|R

40|$|Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are pattern {{recognition}} receptors (PRRs) {{considered to be}} the primary sensors of pathogens in innate immunity. Genetic variants could be associated to differences in breed innate immune response to pathogens and thus to susceptibility to infections or autoimmune diseases. TLRs are encoded by a multigene family and are conserved through evolution, from Drosophila to mammals, because of its essential role in innate immunity. Ten TLRs have been identified in most mammals. TLRs can be classified into groups, depending on the PAMPs detected and their cellular location. There are significant distinctions between intracellular and extracellular TLRs. Intracellular TLRs theoretically can't accept much variability, because they have evolved under strong purifying selection. Viruses can only be detected through their nucleic acids; therefore, intracellular TLRs have an essential non-redundant role in host survival. Moreover, mutations in those TLRs could end up with an autoimmune disease against own nucleic acids or with high susceptibility to some viral infections. On the other hand, membrane or extracellular TLRs have evolved under less evolutionary pressure, due to they can recognize one pathogen through different PAMPs (immunological redundancy). So they show a higher rate of damaging non-synonymous and STOP mutations. Although <b>infective</b> <b>pressure</b> that has reached these molecules {{is one of the main}} mechanisms of evolution, it is not the only one. In some domestic species non-adaptative evolution has also an important role, through genetic drift, bottlenecks and migratory routes. Genetic variation in canine and porcine TLRs characterized in our laboratory using massive parallel sequencing will be presented and results discussed...|$|E
40|$|Background Domesticated grazing animals {{including}} {{horses and}} donkeys are frequently housed using deep litter bedding systems, {{where it is}} commonly presumed {{that there is no}} risk of infection from the nematodes that are associated with grazing at pasture. We use two different approaches to test whether equids could become infected with cyathostomines from the ingestion of deep litter straw bedding. Methods Two herbage plot studies were performed in horticultural incubators set up to simulate three straw bedding scenarios and one grass turf positive control. Faeces were placed on 16 plots, and larval recoveries performed on samples of straw/grass substrate over 2 - to 3 -week periods. Within each incubator, a thermostat was set to maintain an environmental temperature of approximately 10 °C to 20 °C. To provide further validation, 24 samples of straw bedding were collected over an 8 -week period from six barns in which a large number of donkeys were housed in a deep litter straw bedding system. These samples were collected from the superficial bedding at 16 sites along a “W” route through each barn. Results No infective larvae were recovered from any of the plots containing dry straw. However, infective cyathostomine larvae were first detected on day 8 from plots containing moist straw. In the straw bedding study, cyathostomine larvae were detected in 18 of the 24 samples. Additionally, in the two barns which were sampled serially, the level of larval infectivity generally increased from week to week, except when the straw bedding was removed and replaced. Conclusions We have demonstrated that equine cyathostomines can develop to infective larvae on moist straw bedding. It is therefore possible for a horse or donkey bedded in deep litter straw to become infected by ingesting the contaminated straw. This has implications for parasite control in stabled equids and potentially in housed ruminants, and further investigation is required in order to establish the relative <b>infective</b> <b>pressure</b> from pasture versus straw bedding...|$|E
