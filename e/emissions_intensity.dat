5|$|Direct {{geothermal}} heating systems contain pumps and compressors, which may consume energy from a polluting source. This parasitic load is normally {{a fraction of}} the heat output, so it is always less polluting than electric heating. However, if the electricity is produced by burning fossil fuels, then the net emissions of {{geothermal heating}} may be comparable to directly burning the fuel for heat. For example, a geothermal heat pump powered by electricity from a combined cycle natural gas plant would produce about as much pollution as a natural gas condensing furnace of the same size. Therefore, the environmental value of direct geothermal heating applications is highly dependent on the <b>emissions</b> <b>intensity</b> of the neighboring electric grid.|$|E

40|$|A {{method to}} {{estimate}} background continuum emission in inductively coupled plasma-atomic emission spectrometry (ICP-AES) is proposed. The method {{assumes that the}} ICP background continuum emission is mainly due to recombinative radiation in the plasma. The <b>emission</b> <b>intensity</b> at an arbitrary wavelength {{is related to the}} temperature and electron number density of the plasma. Furthermore, the ratio of background continuum <b>emission</b> <b>intensity</b> at two arbitrary plasma excitation conditions is a constant for all wavelengths. Therefore, if there is a change in plasma excitation conditions, the new background continuum <b>emission</b> <b>intensity</b> at an arbitrary wavelength can be calculated from the initial background <b>emission</b> <b>intensity</b> and the <b>emission</b> <b>intensity</b> ratio that can be measured accurately at another convenient wavelength. In this paper, rather than the <b>emission</b> <b>intensity</b> ratio, the ratio of the differences in intensities is used to remove the contribution of dark current in the measured intensity, if any. The ratio is termed 'f-factor'. Firstly, the background <b>emission</b> <b>intensities</b> at two reference plasma excitation conditions are measured. The f-factors of these two background <b>emission</b> <b>intensities</b> are assigned values 0 and 1, respectively. When the plasma excitation condition changes, the f-factor relative to the reference conditions at an arbitrary wavelength can be calculated from the new <b>emission</b> <b>intensity.</b> The background <b>emission</b> <b>intensity</b> at other wavelengths can then be determined from their corresponding <b>emission</b> <b>intensities</b> at the reference conditions and the new f-factor. Background <b>emission</b> <b>intensity</b> of the ICP (λ= 200 - 460 nm) is measured using an ICP spectrometer with a segmented-array imaging detector. The ICP forward power was varied from 800 to 1500 W. In agreement of the model, the f-factors at any wavelengths remain constant at all forward power used. The proposed method was compared to off-peak background correction method. Analyte concentrations were selected to give signal-to-background ratio of ∼ 1. The corrected analyte <b>emission</b> <b>intensities</b> using both background correction methods agree, except for Ca 396. 847 nm, which suffers from spectral overlap from a nearby hydrogen emission line. The ability of the proposed method for background correction of fast changing background emission was demonstrated using direct sample insertion and a direct reading multi-channel spectrometer. © 2002 Elsevier Science B.

The validity of the total CO 2 <b>emission</b> <b>intensities</b> has been questioned mainly because the amounts of commodities are measured in monetary units, and because various commodities are produced in a single sector of an existing I-O table. In this study, first, a sensitivity analysis of total CO 2 <b>emission</b> <b>intensities</b> estimated using the Japanese I-O table was performed to identify the elements that significantly influence the total CO 2 <b>emission</b> <b>intensity.</b> If an influential element identified by sensitivity analysis varies widely, the total CO 2 <b>emission</b> <b>intensity</b> is greatly influenced.

It was concluded that the evaluation of uncertainties using a stochastic approach {{as well as the}} improvement of accuracy by disaggregating the original I-O sectors, focusing on influential elements, are important. ...|$|R
