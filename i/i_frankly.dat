25|$|Mark Twain's sarcastic {{summation}} of Rhodes ("I admire him, <b>I</b> <b>frankly</b> confess it; {{and when his}} time comes I shall buy {{a piece of the}} rope for a keepsake"), from Chapter LXIX of Following the Equator, still often appears in collections of famous insults.|$|E
25|$|I {{want to say}} at {{once that}} <b>I</b> <b>frankly</b> believe that Irving Berlin is the {{greatest}} songwriter that has ever lived.... His songs are exquisite cameos of perfection, and {{each one of them}} is as beautiful as its neighbor. Irving Berlin remains, I think, America's Schubert. But apart from his genuine talent for song-writing, Irving Berlin has had a greater influence upon American music than any other one man. It was Irving Berlin who was the very first to have created a real, inherent American music.... Irving Berlin was the first to free the American song from the nauseating sentimentality which had previously characterized it, and by introducing and perfecting ragtime he had actually given us the first germ of an American musical idiom; he had sown the first seeds of an American music.|$|E
500|$|Cameron {{was against}} Orion's {{decision}} {{and was told}} that if he did not agree with the settlement, he would have to pay any damages if Orion lost a suit by Ellison. Cameron replied that he [...] "had no choice but to agree with the settlement. Of course there was a gag order as well, so I couldn't tell this story, but now <b>I</b> <b>frankly</b> don't care. It's the truth." ...|$|E

500|$|By the {{beginning}} of 2008, his final year in office, Bush's approval rating had dropped {{to a low of}} just 19percent, largely from the loss of support among Republicans. Commenting on his low poll numbers and accusations of being [...] "the worst president," [...] Bush would say, [...] "I make decisions on what I think is right for the United States based upon principles. <b>I</b> <b>frankly</b> don't give a damn about the polls." ...|$|E
500|$|However, the Georgia Tech {{incident}} left Ward {{angry and}} disillusioned. He recalled that it sapped his competitive spirit. Ward considered quitting football, even {{writing a letter}} to Coach Kipke about his intentions of leaving the team. He recalled later that the refusal to let him play against Georgia Tech destroyed his will. [...] "It {{was the fact that}} I couldn't play in the Georgia Tech game. That all of a sudden, the practice that you just did because it was the thing to do that was good—a tremendous amount of burnt up energy—all of a sudden becomes drudgery." [...] His one sports highlight in 1935 was beating Jesse Owens at Yost Fieldhouse in the 60-yard dash and 65 high hurdles. Ward's times were neck-and-neck with Owens' up until the NCAA track and field championship. [...] He took part in the Olympic trials in 1936, but having lost his competitive drive, Ward, in his own words, did not train to his peak and failed to make the U.S. team. [...] "They were urging me to go out in '36," [...] Ward recalled. [...] "But that Georgia Tech game killed me. <b>I</b> <b>frankly</b> felt they would not let black athletes compete. Having gone through the Tech experience, it seemed an easy thing for them to say 'Well, we just won't run 'em if Hitler insists.'" [...] Interviewed about the incident in 1976, Ward said: “It was like any bad experience—you can’t forget it, but you don’t talk about it. It hurts.” ...|$|E
2500|$|In the mid-1970s, {{some conservatives}} called the {{newspaper}} [...] "Pravda on the Potomac" [...] {{because of its}} perceived left-wing bias in both reporting and editorials. Since then, the appellation {{has been used by}} both liberal and conservative critics of the newspaper. In 1963, FBI director J. Edgar Hoover reportedly told President Lyndon B. Johnson, [...] "I don't have much influence with the Post because <b>I</b> <b>frankly</b> don't read it. I view it like the Daily Worker." ...|$|E

2500|$|In 2005, Sessions {{spoke at}} a rally in Washington, D.C. in favor of the War in Iraq {{organized}} in opposition to an anti-war protest held the day before. Sessions said of the anti-war protesters: [...] "The group who spoke here the other day did not represent the American ideals of freedom, liberty and spreading that around the world. <b>I</b> <b>frankly</b> don't know what they represent, other than to blame America first." [...] The same year, he opposed legislation by Senator John McCain prohibiting the U.S. military from engaging in torture; the amendment passed 90–9.|$|E
2500|$|A {{number of}} the rebels were hanged {{including}} Samuel Lount and Peter Matthews, others were shot. Their deaths were a strong motivation for the continuing Patriot War. Many more prisoners were transported, but most were pardoned, e.g. Enoch Moore (Loyalist turned rebel). A general pardon (for everyone but Mackenzie) was issued in 1845, and Mackenzie himself was pardoned in 1849 and {{allowed to return to}} Canada, where he resumed his political career. [...] Mackenzie was strongly disillusioned after his time in the United States, writing to his son that [...] "after what I have seen here, <b>I</b> <b>frankly</b> confess to you that, had I passed nine years in the United States before, instead of after, the outbreak, I am sure I would have been the last man in America to be engaged in it." [...] In later life however, Mackenzie advocated annexation of Canada by the United States.|$|E
2500|$|The British, however, were {{extremely}} reluctant to act. British public opinion had rapidly shifted (as it did after World War I) away from anti-German sentiment towards {{a desire for}} reconciliation. There was a strong feeling that putting elderly and sick men on trial {{three years after the}} war was unjust. There was also {{the fact that many of}} the events referred to by the Americans had taken place in the Soviet Union and Poland, which were now, with the onset of the Cold War, political adversaries and no longer co-operating with western war crimes investigations. The British Military Governor in Germany, Air Marshal Sir Sholto Douglas, was strongly opposed. He wrote: [...] "We are apparently prepared to send these men, including one who is 73, to trial by the Americans. <b>I</b> <b>frankly</b> do not like this. I feel that if the Americans wish to be critical in our inaction in trying war criminals, I should prefer that they should continue to criticise rather than that we should commit an injustice in order to avoid their criticism." ...|$|E

60|$|MRS. JUNO. I don't think we'll {{talk about}} it any more. Danger is all very well when you do escape; but {{sometimes}} one doesn't. <b>I</b> tell you <b>frankly</b> <b>I</b> don't feel as safe as you do--if you really do.|$|R

60|$|<b>I</b> {{answered}} him <b>frankly,</b> <b>I</b> had no great judgment, but that, {{such as it}} was, I ventured to trust to it; I thought I had honest men to deal with, and that I should bring nobody to taste them for me but myself.|$|R

6000|$|... "Well," [...] said Featherstone, with feeling, [...] "you {{are doing}} us a service we can't repay. <b>I</b> <b>frankly</b> don't like the plan, {{because it can}} only work at your expense, but it will give us time and I can think of nothing else." ...|$|E
