5|$|<b>I</b> <b>realize</b> <b>that</b> {{many good}} and able men have eloquently spoken and written, {{sometimes}} in rhapsodical strains, about {{the duty of}} this Court to keep the Constitution {{in tune with the}} times. The idea is that the Constitution must be changed from time to time, and that this Court is charged with a duty to make those changes. For myself, I must, with all deference, reject that philosophy. The Constitution makers knew the need for change, and provided for it. Amendments suggested by the people's elected representatives can be submitted to the people or their selected agents for ratification. That method of change was good for our Fathers, and, being somewhat old-fashioned, I must add it is good enough for me.|$|E

Just before Stieglitz’s death I took some paintings to him that I considered as having something new in the. He immediately walked right up to them and spoke of the new ideas. His intuition in that way was remarkable and I am so glad to have been allowed to live during his and your lifetimes. It has been a great privilege for which I am truly thankful.|$|E

But his love for music and my love for baseball bonded us in this project." [...] Sports blogger Voodoo Brown described West as [...] "in creepmode from the gate."

500|$|In 1576, in a {{move that}} {{endangered}} Henry's throne, Francis allied with the Protestant princes against the crown. On 6 May 1576, Catherine gave in to almost all Huguenot demands in the Edict of Beaulieu. The treaty became known as the Peace of Monsieur because it was thought that Francis had forced it on the crown. Francis died of consumption in June 1584, after a disastrous intervention in the Low Countries during which his army had been massacred. Catherine wrote, the next day: [...] "I am so wretched to live long enough to see so many people die before me, although <b>I</b> <b>realize</b> <b>that</b> God's will must be obeyed, that He owns everything, and that he lends us only for as long as He likes the children whom He gives us." [...] The death of her youngest son was a calamity for Catherine's dynastic dreams. Under Salic law, by which only males could ascend the throne, the Huguenot Henry of Navarre now became heir presumptive to the French crown.|$|E

[...] SyFy Portal's Dan Compora said that [...] "The more I hate Ben, the more <b>I</b> <b>realize</b> <b>that</b> Michael Emerson is just a very fine actor doing his job." [...] Oscar Dahl of BuddyTV called Emerson an acting [...] "god" [...] and said that [...] "The Other Woman" [...] was [...] "ostensibly a Juliet episode, [...] Ben's presence made a far bigger impression on me".

500|$|Brandon Soderberg of Pitchfork {{commented that}} Beyoncé mixes [...] "vulnerability and confidence" [...] while singing the chorus lines, where she {{repeatedly}} pleads her romantic interest, [...] "Make {{love to me}} when my days look low / Pull me in close and don't let me go / Make love to me when the world's at war / That our love will heal us all", while the music stays steady and soft {{with only a few}} piano chords and a baseline plucked guitar riff. As she continues to chant about making love in apocalyptic circumstances, [...] "So when the world's at war / Let our love heal us all", she projects a universal [...] "all you need is love" [...] feeling, as noted by Jillian Mapes. In the second verse, Beyoncé sings, [...] "Hey! I don't know much about guns but I ... I've been shot by you", as she pushes the final word [...] "you" [...] up at a full octave. She then continues: [...] "Hey! And I don't know when I'm gonna die, but I hope that I'm gonna die by you / Hey! And I don't know much about fighting, but I, I know I will fight for you / Hey! Just when I ball up my fist, <b>I</b> <b>realize</b> <b>that</b> I'm laying right next to you". According to Thomas Conner of the Chicago Sun-Times, these lines are intended to show that love conquers all. The song ends with an intense electric guitar solo.|$|E
500|$|Due to the Palm Beach media {{attention}} and the Thomas hearings, Kennedy's public image suffered. A Gallup Poll gave Kennedy {{a very low}} 22percent national approval rating. A Boston Herald/WCVB-TV poll found that 62 percent of Massachusetts citizens thought Kennedy should not run for re-election, by a 2-to-1 margin thought Kennedy had misled authorities in the Palm Beach investigation, and had Kennedy losing a hypothetical Senate race to Governor William Weld by 25points. Meanwhile, at a June 17, 1991, dinner party, Kennedy saw Victoria Anne Reggie, a Washington lawyer at Keck, Mahin & Cate, a divorced mother of two, and {{the daughter of an}} old Kennedy family ally, Louisiana judge Edmund Reggie. They began dating and by September were in a serious relationship. In a late October speech at the John F. Kennedy School of Government, Kennedy sought to begin a political recovery, saying: [...] "I am painfully aware that the criticism directed at me in recent months involves far more than disagreements with my positions ... involves the disappointment of friends and many others who rely on me to fight the good fight. To them I say, I recognize my own shortcomings– the faults in the conduct of my private life. <b>I</b> <b>realize</b> <b>that</b> I alone am responsible for them, and I am the one who must confront them." [...] In December 1991, the William Kennedy Smith rape trial was held; it was nationally televised and the most watched until the O. J. Simpson murder case three years later. Kennedy's testimony at the trial seemed relaxed, confident, and forthcoming, and helped convince the public that his involvement had been peripheral and unintended. Smith was acquitted.|$|E
500|$|Matt Fowler of IGN {{wrote in}} his review for the episode, [...] ""No One" [...] may have given us a bloodless siege, but {{there were plenty of}} bloody moments, namely from the {{brothers}} Clegane, who were both awesomely brutal this week. Though not against one another, as it looks like, for now, the Cleganebowl's been canceled. I loved the end of Arya's arc along with Jaime's scheme to take Riverrun - though I'm curious to see what comes of the Tully angle. Brienne failed to get an army for Sansa and Jaime's just going to head back home now? It seems like there should be more to this that him just winning one for the Lannister name. Though regardless of what the payoff might be, it was still good to see how so much of this story tied back to the first three seasons and Jaime's time as Catelyn's prisoner." [...] He gave the episode an 8.2 out of 10. Myles McNutt of The A.V. Club criticized the episode's momentum within the season, writing [...] "The lack of momentum driving these stories is surprising to me given that the season has largely been doing a fine job with internal momentum." [...] McNutt continued, [...] "The show may have run into an unfortunate convergence of so many anti-climactic storylines in a single episode, but their very existence is a necessary byproduct of a narrative that is preparing to shed its skin and move forward with a new lease on life." [...] Despite this, he gave the episode a grade of B-. Erik Kain of Forbes wrote about the episode, [...] "Not the greatest episode of the season, but I still didn't want it to end. Sometimes <b>I</b> <b>realize</b> <b>that</b> even an episode I have lots of complaints about manages to be some of the best television out there. Game of Thrones isn't always on the money, but even an off night can be surprisingly good." [...] James Hibberd of Entertainment Weekly summarized the episode in his review by saying [...] "Cheers, chills, and the sound of online fan theories imploding. [...] "No One" [...] delivered Jaime Lannister's finest scene in years, a thrilling chase, and set one Stark on an exciting new path." ...|$|E

500|$|The downtempo {{song was}} {{developed}} {{on the following}} day, with Madonna writing the lyrics and Leonard composing the melody. Named [...] "The Look of Love", the song contains the line [...] "No where to run, no place to hide. From the look of love, from the eyes of pride". Madonna {{was inspired by the}} look that actor James Stewart gave actress Grace Kelly in the 1954 film Rear Window. Madonna said: [...] "I can't describe it, but that is the way I want someone to look at me when he loves me. It's the most pure look of love and adoration. Like surrender. It's devastating." [...] After [...] "The Look of Love", Madonna went on to develop two further songs with Bray as the producer. The first was called [...] "Causing a Commotion", and was inspired by Penn and the couple's often tumultuous relationship. Madonna felt that her marriage to Penn {{was on the verge of}} breaking-up, due to Penn's abusive and violent nature. In a Rolling Stone article dated September 10, 1987, Madonna spoke about Penn's impact on her life and the song: [...] "I don't like violence. I never condone hitting anyone, and I never thought that any violence should have taken place. But on the other hand, I understood Sean's anger and believe me, I have wanted to hit him many times. I never would you know, because <b>I</b> <b>realize</b> <b>that</b> it would just make things worse. [...] I felt like he was 'Causing a Commotion' to purposefully distract me. I wrote this song and vented my frustration in it." [...] The last song developed was [...] "Can't Stop", a track inspired by Sixties Motown and the group Martha and the Vandellas. In addition to this, the album also included tracks by some acts on Warner Bros. Records, namely Club Nouveau, Scritti Politti and Michael Davidson. Commercially unsuccessful and unknown in the US, these groups needed a platform to project their songs, and including them in a Madonna album seemed like the right thing to do for Warner. Two tracks by Duncan Faure and Coati Mundi were included on the soundtrack at the request of Madonna since they were her friends. Despite her only performing four of the nine tracks on the album, Who's That Girl was marketed as a Madonna album, with only her face and name appearing on the cover art.|$|E
500|$|Aubry D'Arminio of Entertainment Weekly {{describes}} [...] "savvy Ben" [...] as a [...] "captivating minor character". [...] Jeff Jensen of Entertainment Weekly praised Emerson's {{acting in}} the beginning of season four, calling him [...] "a genius in [...] role". Alan Sepinwall from The Star-Ledger worried [...] "the actor is so good and the character so popular that he's kept alive even though it makes all the heroes look like idiots". Following [...] "Confirmed Dead", Entertainment Weeklys Jeff Jensen felt [...] "Isn't the whole business of Ben manipulating Locke with the promise of Island secrets getting just a little bit old?" [...] SyFy Portal's Dan Compora said that [...] "The more I hate Ben, the more <b>I</b> <b>realize</b> <b>that</b> Michael Emerson is just a very fine actor doing his job". Don Williams of BuddyTV said [...] "consider my mind blown again", referring to the flashforward in [...] "The Economist" [...] where it is revealed that Sayid is working for Ben. Oscar Dahl of BuddyTV called Emerson an acting [...] "god". Chris Carabott from IGN found one of the best moments of [...] "Eggtown", was the power struggle between Locke and Ben, because [...] "Their scenes together are amongst the best in the series and the one that opens [...] "Eggtown" [...] is a perfect display of how well Michael Emerson and Terry O'Quinn work together. O'Quinn captures Locke's uncertainty perfectly in the opening scene and it's always fun to watch Ben prey on any weakness of character." [...] Kevin Thompson of The Palm Beach Post wrote [...] "with those big ol' eyes of his, [...] could always say more with a lengthy stare than he could with twenty pages of dialogue.... once again, proved why he has become Losts star as well as its heart and soul.... an Emmy should belong to [...]" [...] Jennifer Godwin of E! wrote that [...] "no one has ever done better work humanizing a supervillain." [...] Matt Roush of TV Guide puts Ben in [...] "The Shape of Things to Come" [...] in the top 20 moments of the week, stating [...] "Michael Emerson on Lost. It doesn't get better than that". Ben Rawson-Jones of Digital Spy describes Emerson's performance as [...] "fantastic", with [...] "many layers of intrigue and humanity". John Kubicek of BuddyTV also found his performance [...] "fantastic", adding [...] "he nailed it". Critic Kelly Woo, from TV Squad, placed him on second on her list of [...] "Seven new characters that worked", ranking just below Desmond Hume, also from Lost.|$|E

Coburn stated that, in airing the movie without editing it for television, TV {{had been taken}} [...] "to an all-time low, with full-frontal nudity, {{violence}} and profanity." [...] He also said the TV broadcast should outrage parents and decent-minded individuals everywhere.

2500|$|Despite {{positive}} critical {{reviews and}} success in the music charts, the album became controversial due to the lyrics of [...] "Zezé" [...] and the audio samples used in the bonus track [...] "Twenty Three" [...] (not {{to be confused with}} the similarly-titled lead single). On November 4, the Korean publisher of the novel My Sweet Orange Tree, from which IU drew inspiration for the song [...] "Zezé", stirred debate in the entertainment industry on freedom of interpretation when it leveled criticisms at IU for her interpretation of the five-year-old protagonist as a [...] "sexual object". Two days later, IU issued a public statement: [...] "I did not mean to turn Zeze into a sexual object... but <b>I</b> <b>realize</b> <b>that</b> my lyrics have offended many, and for this I apologize." [...] On November 10, the publisher released an apology for its failure to acknowledge [...] "diversity of interpretation." [...] For the bonus track [...] "Twenty Three", voice samples from Britney Spears' [...] "Gimme More" [...] were allegedly used without permission.
