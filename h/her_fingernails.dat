There was no trace of lead dust. The rifle magazine would have been loaded at least twice during the killings; this would usually leave lubricant and material from the bullets on the hands.

25|$|In September 2014, {{almost two}} years after Hedgepeth's death, the autopsy report was released. It {{confirmed}} what was on her death certificate, that she had died of blunt force trauma to the head. She had numerous cuts and bruises as well as blood under <b>her</b> <b>fingernails,</b> suggesting she had struggled with her killer. The DNA taken from the semen was matched to DNA elsewhere at the scene.|$|E

The legend is that the Empress Wende inadvertently stuck one of <b>her</b> <b>fingernails</b> in a wax model of the coin {{when it was first}} presented to her, and the resulting mark was reverentially retained. Other imperial ladies have also been proposed as the source of these nail marks, especially the Imperial Consort Yang. Peng explores the possibility of a foreign source for them. More prosaically, they appear to be a control system operated by the mint workers.|$|E

50|$|When a Binukot {{is ready}} for marriage, often at age 13 or 14 or younger, her parents ask for a high pangayu (Hiligaynon: bride price or dowry) from {{the family of the}} suitor. A Binukot with high pangayu often brings {{prestige}} to a family.

25|$|According to news reports, {{the driver}} of the minibus {{attempted}} to rape Özgecan, but she resisted by using pepper spray. Following this, he stabbed her multiple times, and beat her to death with an iron rod. He returned to Tarsus following the murder and asked for help from his father and a friend. The three men burnt Özgecan's body together in a forest and cut off her hands, as Özgecan had scratched the perpetrator's face during the struggle, and they feared that his DNA would be identified on the fingernails. Later, the post-mortem examination revealed that she had not been raped and DNA of the prime suspect was indeed found on <b>her</b> <b>fingernails.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{following}} day (26 February), police began excavating {{the section of}} the garden at Cromwell Street where Fred indicated he had buried his daughter's body. Shortly after 4 p.m., police found a human thigh bone protruding from a section of the garden Fred had insisted police need not look in. Excavating {{the section of the}} garden where Fred had indicated he had buried his daughter's body, investigators discovered a mass of jumbled human remains encased in the remnants of a bin bag and intertwined with two lengths of rope. These dismembered remains were taken to the police headquarters for further examination, where they were determined to be those of a young woman, although one kneecap and several phalange bones were missing, and <b>her</b> <b>fingernails</b> were discovered in a pile, suggesting they may have been torn from her fingers as a means of torture. Several hours later, the body was identified via dental records as being that of Heather West.|$|E

50|$|After {{the birth}} of a great lord's {{daughter}} named Talia, wise men and astrologers cast the child's horoscope and told the lord that Talia would be later endangered by a splinter of flax. To protect his daughter, the father commands that no flax would ever be brought into his house. Years later, Talia sees an old woman spinning flax on a spindle. She asks the woman if she can stretch the flax herself, but as soon as she begins to spin, a splinter of flax goes under <b>her</b> <b>fingernail,</b> and she drops to the ground, apparently dead. Unable to stand the thought of burying his child, Talia's father, the lord, puts his daughter Talia in one of his country estates.|$|R
500|$|... {{also written}} kitsune-tsuki, {{literally}} means [...] "the {{state of being}} possessed by a fox". The victim is usually a young woman, whom the fox enters beneath <b>her</b> <b>fingernails</b> or through her breasts. In some cases, the victims' facial expressions are said to change {{in such a way}} that they resemble those of a fox. Japanese tradition holds that fox possession can cause illiterate victims to temporarily gain the ability to read. Though foxes in folklore can possess a person of their own will, kitsunetsuki is often attributed to the malign intents of hereditary fox employers, or tsukimono-suji.|$|E

If there's anything I can do to champion the cause and further it, I will, shy of getting arrested." [...] Swedish athletes Emma Green Tregaro and Moa Hjelmer painted <b>her</b> <b>fingernails</b> in rainbow colors as a symbolic protest. However, Tregaro was forced to re-paint them after they were deemed a political gesture that violated {{the rules of the}} IAAF. In response, she re-painted them red as a symbol of love. Russian pole vaulter Yelena Isinbaeva criticized Tregaro's gesture as being disrespectful to the host country, stating in a press conference that [...] "we have our law which everyone has to respect. When we go to different countries, we try to follow their rules. We are not trying to set our rules over there. We are just trying to be respectful."

They said there is tension between Carl and Nora, and compared her digging <b>her</b> <b>fingernails</b> into {{his hand to his}} burning of Ian's hand, asking [...] "has Carl learnt everything he knows from his evil mum?" [...] Jim Shelley thought that Nora's introduction [...] "seemed to be the start of a campaign trying to garner some sympathy for Carl—henceforth, a nasty, charmless bully".

2500|$|On January 28, 1981, {{a teenage}} victim's body between fifteen and twenty-one was found {{concealed}} by trees in Bellevue, Bossier Parish, Louisiana.

None of {{the names on the}} clothing amounted to meaningful leads, although they were speculated to have belonged to companions of the Jane Doe. The victim had also painted <b>her</b> <b>fingernails</b> prior to her murder. The shoes were later determined to have been size seven. A knife found in the soil near her remains is thought to have been the murder weapon, as the victim had been stabbed nine times.

She had died by severe blunt-force trauma and {{possibly}} a stab wound three to six weeks before and was an advanced state of decomposition. However, her fingerprints were possible to obtain, {{as well as her}} DNA and dental information.

Authorities hoped in late April 1985 that they would identify her body by comparing her fingerprints to other people's but were unsuccessful, as she remains unidentified today. Six missing women were ruled out as possible identities of the victim.|$|E

Traumatic lesions, whether chemical, physical, or thermal in nature, {{are among the}} most common in the mouth. A type of physical injury to the gingival tissues is self-inflicted. Sometimes the lesions are termed gingivitis artefacta. Self-inflicted gingival injuries in children and adolescents can occur as a result of accidental trauma, premeditated infliction, or chronic habits such as fingernail biting, digit sucking, or sucking on objects such as pens, pencils or pacifiers. The purpose of this case report was to illustrate the destructive nature of the habit and to describe the successful treatment of this case. A 14 -year-old girl with moderate pain, gingival bleeding and recession in the anterior mandibulary region was admitted to periodontology clinic. Upon questioning, the patient readily admitted traumatizing her gingiva with <b>her</b> <b>fingernail.</b> Treatment consisted of oral hygiene instruction, mechanical debridement, psychological support and surgical periodontal treatment. Postoperatively, complete root coverage, gains in clinical attachment levels, and highly significant increases in the width of keratinized gingiva were observed.
