5|$|At Panola, Oppong earned all-conference {{honors and}} led them to a fairly {{successful}} season in the NJCAA Region XIV. Entering the next season, he became a high-end Canadian recruit for programs in the NCAA. Oppong ultimately chose to play for <b>Eastern</b> <b>Kentucky</b> under head coach Jeff Neubauer. He was a starter {{from time to time}} as his junior season progressed. However, he suffered a shoulder injury {{in the middle of the}} season that sidelined him for several of his games. He returned to the starting lineup by the postseason. Oppong did not earn any major awards at the Division I level, but was considerably more effective as a senior, as he developed into a bigger scorer for <b>Eastern</b> <b>Kentucky.</b>|$|E

5|$|In March 1904, Beckham {{signed the}} Day Law mandating racial {{segregation}} of all schools in Kentucky. Berea College, a private college in <b>eastern</b> <b>Kentucky</b> {{that had been}} integrated since the 1850s, immediately filed suit to challenge the law.

5|$|Carroll had {{considered}} {{running for the}} U.S. Senate in 1968, but {{dropped out of the}} race after just two weeks when he discovered that it would take well over $100,000 to run a competitive primary campaign. In 1971, former governor Bert T. Combs sought a second term as governor and chose Carroll as his informal running mate. (The governor and lieutenant governor were elected separately at the time.) Combs, an <b>Eastern</b> <b>Kentucky</b> native, sought geographic balance for the ticket by selecting Carroll, from the far-west Jackson Purchase. Combs said he would provide the needed financing, and Carroll agreed to enter the race.|$|E
5|$|In {{recognition}} of his success, Garfield was promoted to brigadier general, {{at the age of}} 30. After Marshall's retreat, Garfield's command was the sole remaining Union force in <b>eastern</b> <b>Kentucky,</b> and he announced that any men who had fought for the Confederacy would be granted amnesty if they returned to their homes and lived peaceably and remained loyal to the Union. The proclamation was surprisingly lenient, as Garfield now believed the war was a crusade for eradication of slavery. Following a brief skirmish at Pound Gap, the last rebel units in the area were outflanked, and they retreated to Virginia.|$|E
5|$|Seven other Democratic {{candidates}} for lieutenant governor entered the race, {{the most formidable}} being sitting attorney general John B. Breckinridge. While Combs lost to Ford in the gubernatorial primary, Carroll won the separate primary for lieutenant governor, partly {{on the strength of}} the <b>Eastern</b> <b>Kentucky</b> votes he gained from his association with Combs. Carroll went on to defeat Republican Jim Host in the general election for lieutenant governor. As lieutenant governor, Carroll chaired the Legislative Research Commission and the National Conference of Lieutenant Governors.|$|E

5|$|The Republican minor officeholders {{returned}} to the state courts with their case. Franklin County circuit court justice James E. Cantrill ruled against them, and the Kentucky Court of Appeals, then the state's court of last resort, sustained Cantrill's ruling {{by a vote of}} 4â€“3. Republican Attorney General Clifton J. Pratt continued with legal challenges and finally was allowed to serve out his term. Though Cantrill's decision was based on the invalidation of Louisville's vote and the votes of four counties in <b>eastern</b> <b>Kentucky,</b> none of the legislators from those areas were unseated.|$|E
5|$|Adams {{went on to}} play {{four seasons}} of college {{football}} with the <b>Eastern</b> <b>Kentucky</b> Colonels, {{a member of the}} Division I Football Championship Subdivision (then known as Division I-AA). Starting in 33 games, Adams received several accolades while playing for the Colonels, including being named a Division I-AA third team All-American, a two-time first team All-Conference player, and a second team All-Conference player. In September 2002, he was selected as the Ohio Valley Conference Defensive Player of the Week for his effort in a game against the Florida Atlantic Owls, where he made 5 total tackles and repeatedly pressured the quarterback (including for one sack). Adams continued his successful senior year by recording 81 defensive tackles and five sacks.|$|E
5|$|An incensed Democratic {{majority}} in the Kentucky General Assembly created a committee to investigate the charges of voter fraud, even as armed citizens from heavily Republican <b>eastern</b> <b>Kentucky</b> poured into the state capital under auspices of keeping Democrats from stealing the election. Before the investigative committee could report, Goebel was shot by an unknown assassin while entering the state capitol on January 30, 1900. As Goebel lay in a nearby hotel being treated for his wounds, the committee issued its report recommending that the General Assembly invalidate enough votes to give the election to Goebel. The report was accepted, Taylor was deposed, and Goebel was sworn into office on January 31. He died three days later on February 2.|$|E

Later, he enrolled at Central University (now <b>Eastern</b> <b>Kentucky</b> University) in Richmond, Kentucky but was forced to quit school at the age of 17 to support his widowed mother. Two years later, he became principal of Bardstown public schools, serving from 1888 to 1893. Concurrently, he studied law at the University of Kentucky, where he earned his law degree in 1889.

5|$|Born on August 9, 1982 in Lexington, Kentucky, Tyson Gay is {{the only}} son of Daisy Gay and Greg Mitchell.

Gay's older sister, Tiffany, was a keen sprinter and had a successful high school career. Tiffany and Tyson Gay, encouraged by their mother, raced at every opportunity, training hard at school and on the hills in their neighborhood. There was strong competition between the two, and Gay later said that his sister's quick reaction time inspired him to improve.|$|E
