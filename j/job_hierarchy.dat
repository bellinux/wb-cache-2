50|$|Single, Irish {{immigrant}} women quickly assumed jobs {{in high demand}} but for very low pay. The majority of them worked in mills, factories, and private households and were considered the bottommost group in the female <b>job</b> <b>hierarchy,</b> alongside African American women. Workers considered mill work in cotton textiles and needle trades the least desirable because of the dangerous and unpleasant conditions. Factory work was primarily a worst-case scenario for widows or daughters of families already involved in the industry. Unlike many other immigrants, Irish women preferred domestic work because it was constantly in great demand among middle- and upper-class American households. Although wages differed across the country, they were consistently {{higher than those of}} the other occupations available to Irish women and could often be negotiated {{because of the lack of}} competition. Also, the working conditions in well-off households were significantly better than those of factories or mills, and free room and board allowed domestic servants to save money or send it back to their families in Ireland.|$|E
5000|$|Women and men {{experience}} {{different types}} of mobility within the workplace. Women tend to experience a glass ceiling, an invisible barrier that prevents them from moving up the corporate ladder. Men in jobs traditionally held by women, such as nursing, elementary school teaching, and social work, experience a [...] "glass escalator" [...] effect {{in which they are}} able to quickly ascend the <b>job</b> <b>hierarchy</b> to become managers and principals. There also tends to be a gender pay gap between men and women, with women earning 77% as much as men. One cause of the gender pay gap may be due to occupational segregation, which pushes men and women towards gender-specific forms of employment, rather than pay discrimination. Another cause is the double burden, a phenomenon in which women perform most of the unpaid childcare and household work despite being otherwise employed for pay. A third cause is occupational sexism, one part of which favors men for promotions due to their traditional breadwinner status. The 2001 class action lawsuit, Dukes v.

40|$|A {{standard}} {{finding in}} the literature on gender wage gaps is that the public sector exhibits much lower gaps than in the private sector. This finding is generally attributed to the existence of less gender discrimination in the public sector. In this paper we show that this conclusion is flawed because the standard finding for the public sector is biased by the dominating influence of large feminised occupational groups, such as those in nursing and teaching, both of which have relatively flat <b>job</b> <b>hierarchies</b> and hence low overall wage variance. However, when we examine other occupations within the public sector, there is evidence of sizeable wage gaps, much of which cannot be explained by observable or unobservable workplace or worker characteristics.

It argues that, in general, we should not expect large long-term real earnings differences between conscript and non-conscript cohorts since important elements of the former received military training and experience of direct value in the civilian jobs market. In the case of call-up during WWII there is even more reason to expect that there was no major disadvantages to those conscripted.

This effect suggests that gender provides significant disadvantages towards the top of <b>job</b> <b>hierarchies</b> which become worse as a person’s career goes on.

These barriers exist {{in spite of the}} achievements or qualifications of the women and still exist when other characteristics that are job-relevant such as experience, education, and abilities are controlled for. The inequality effects of the glass ceiling are more prevalent within higher-powered or higher income occupations, with fewer women holding these types of occupations. The glass ceiling effect also indicates the limited chances of women for income raises and promotion or advancement to more prestigious positions or jobs. As women are prevented by these artificial barriers, from either receiving job promotions or income raises, the effects of the inequality of the glass ceiling increase {{over the course of a}} woman’s career.|$|R

40|$|What’s the issue? In all countries, it is {{well-established}} that poorer {{people have}} substantially shorter life expectancies and more illnesses than the rich. This phenomenon {{has been observed}} {{since at least the}} nineteenth century when Chadwick (1965) investigated the health of the working classes in Victorian England. Two contemporary British studies have been very influential in their documentation of the relationship between socioeconomic factors and health status. The Whitehall civil service study compared the health status of individuals over time with their position in a well-defined <b>job</b> <b>hierarchy.</b> Those lower in the hierarchy experienced three times the risk of death from heart disease, stroke, cancer, gastrointestinal disease, accident and suicide compared with those {{at the top of the}} hierarchy. These differences could not be explained by differences in medical care. The Secretary of State for Health in Britain was concerned about why – 30 years after the establishment of the National Health Service (which made health serves available to all, regardless of income) – significant differences in mortality between social classes persisted. The Black Report, released in 1980 (Townsend et al., 1992) concluded that these differences in health status were not the result of individual differences, but rather of structural differences in the way members of these different classes led their lives.

40|$|There {{are many}} {{indicators}} that interpersonal interactions {{are important for}} understanding individual outcomes and are becoming more important. Yet, empirical work suggests that the returns to people skills have remained low and people people have not progressed {{to the top of}} the <b>job</b> <b>hierarchy.</b> This paper develops a unified model to understand the role of people skills in the labor market, including task assignment and wages. We model interactions between people, letting individuals feel social pressure to help others, and affect the amount of social pressure experienced by others. We assume that people are heterogeneous with respect to caring and that jobs are heterogeneous with respect to the importance of caring. Consistent with our model, we find that as people skills become more important, the women’s share of an occupation increases, but the employment shares of blacks, Hispanics, immigrants, and people with poor English decrease. We also show in an assignment context that within caring jobs, the importance of caring is positively rewarded but that overall labor demand and supply may lead to a negative effect of being caring on wages. We present evidence that computers, team production and innovative work practices, complement people skills. Lastly, we present evidence that people people volunteer more, marry at younger ages, have children at younger ages, and have more children...|$|E
40|$|Excerpt] We present {{new theory}} and the first {{empirical}} test of promotion discrimination models based on job assignment signaling. In our theory, promotions serve as signals of worker ability, and <b>job</b> <b>hierarchies</b> differ in {{the degree to which}} tasks vary across hierarchical levels. When tasks differ substantially across levels, the opportunity cost (in terms of foregone output) of not promoting qualified workers from a disadvantaged group (e. g. racial minorities or females) is large, so employers are less likely to (inefficiently) retain such workers in lower-level jobs. Thus, given performance in the pre-promotion job, the extent to which disadvantaged workers have lower promotion probabilities than advantaged workers should decrease when tasks vary more across hierarchical levels. Also, the difference between the favored and disfavored groups in the wage increase attached to promotion should diminish when tasks vary more across hierarchical levels. We test these implications empirically for the case of racial discrimination in promotions, using personnel data from a large U. S. firm and also data from the National Compensation Survey. We find strong empirical support for the theoretical model’s predictions concerning promotion probabilities, whereas empirical support i...|$|R

40|$|A crucial {{personnel}} decision employers face {{is whether}} to fill {{a limited number of}} managerial positions with internal hires or external recruits. We present a theoretical and empirical analysis of this decision and how it relates to wage setting and the provision of general training. The theoretical framework is a promotion tournament involving M competing firms with heterogeneous productivities, two-level <b>job</b> <b>hierarchies,</b> and a fixed number of managerial positions. Employers provide general training to their workers, some of whom are promoted internally or raided by competing firms. We also consider an alternative model based on variation in the quality of the worker-employer match. Both models predict the following results: As the number of workers at the lower level of the hierarchy increases, holding fixed the number of managers at the top, 1) internal promotion increases relative to external recruitment, 2) employers provide more general training, 3) the percentage of employees in the upper tail of the wage distribution decreases, 4) profitability increases.

40|$|Starting with a {{comparative}} assessment of different welfare regimes and political economies {{from the perspective}} of gender awareness and "pro-women" policies, this paper identifies the determinants of cross-national variation in women's chances of being in a high-status occupation in twelve West European countries. Special emphasis is given to size and structure of the service sector, including share of women in public employment and structural factors such as trade union density and employment protection. The first level of comparison between men and women concentrates on gender representation in the higher echelons of the <b>job</b> <b>hierarchy,</b> while in the second section we extend the scope of analysis, comparing women in high-status occupations and low-wage employment in order to allow for a more nuanced study of gender and class interaction. The first analysis is based on European Social Survey data for the years 2002, 2004, 2006, and 2008, capturing recent trends in occupational dynamics. Results indicate that in general a large service sector and a high trade union density enhance women's chances of being in a high-status occupations while more specifically a large public sector helps to reduce channeling women in low-wage employment. Thus, equality at the top can well be paired with inequality at the bottom, as postindustrial countries with a highly polarized occupational hierarchy such as the UK show. " (author's abstract...|$|E
40|$|The major {{purpose of}} this study is to {{construct}} a standard scheme for the measurement of the 'occupational status' in Korea. According to the preceding studies in the Westetn sociology, occupational status index is classified into two categories. First, 'occupational prestige' shows the position of the occupations in the <b>job</b> <b>hierarchy,</b> which represents people's subjective cognition and evalustion. Second, 'occupational socioeconomic status' represents the estimation by the objective features of those. For the purpose mentioned above, it is necessary to construck a valid index on the hierarchy of the occupational socioeconomic status in Korea. In order to do this, this study formulates the regression equation as follows: Y=a+b·X 1 +c·X 2 (Y: the score of the occupatioanl statusX 1 : median of monthly incomeX 2 : median of the years of education) The result shows that 'managers' and 'professionals' enjoy high scores. In other words, they are at the upper position in the occupational hierarchy. 'Service workers' and 'construction·machinary·manufacturing workers' locate in the middle, while the 'workers in agriculture, forestry and fishing' are at the low position. In addition, in case of the same occupational category, the jobs which need elaborated skills and knowledge tend to get higher scores. Our finding is compared with a previous finding by Hong(1983) to figure out the change in occupational status during the last 20 years. The comparison shows that the overall occupational status structure has remained stable...|$|E
40|$|Background The Airwave Health Monitoring Study was {{established}} to evaluate possible health risks associated with use of TETRA, a digital communication system used by police forces and other emergency services in Great Britain since 2001. The study has been broadened to investigate more generally {{the health of the}} work force. Methods From 2004, participants from each force who agreed to participate were enrolled either with an enrolment questionnaire or a comprehensive health screening performed locally. This includes questionnaire, 7 -day food diaries, anthropometry, measurements of cardiovascular and cognitive function, blood chemistry, coagulation and haematology. Blood and urine samples are stored in vapour phase liquid nitrogen allowing long-term access for biochemical or genetic analysis. Access to the resource is via an access committee and a steering committee, including external scientific advisers as well as representatives of the police officers and staff. Results By the end of 2012, the study had recruited 42, 112 participants, of whom 35, 199 (83. 6 %) had attended the health screening. Almost two thirds of participants were men and 71 % of them were a TETRA user. Being in lower ranks (constable/sergeant and staff) was associated with a worse cardio-metabolic risk profile compared to higher ranks (inspector or chief inspector, superintendent and above).

Traditionally, management has taken the problem of stress as the workers’ personal problem and the management also blamed the workers {{that they are not}} fitting themselves into the working environment. But, now-a-days, the management analyses the job requirements and the social relationships as the prime indicators of stress. With the advent of the technological inventions, the nature of job is deskilled and the worker is totally disconnected from the end product.

Crucial {{questions}} are {{raised by the}} development and application of a System of job evaluation within an organization. The type of participation {{of each of the}} parties involved must first be determined, as well as the methods used to keep the System up to date and to solve eventual conflicts. In order to respond to these questions, the interested parties must accept and respect the following four principles: 1) The determination of job content is a fundamental tool in the administration of a firm. It is a logical consequence of the manager's role, involving planning, organization and control. It is nevertheless difficult to exercice control if one has not defined what has to be controlled. Moreover, the purpose and objectives find concrete form in job descriptions. Job evaluation has, as its aim the determination of the relative importance of jobs. If a job becomes more significant than another through the development of the organization, through modification or precision concerning its purpose and objectives, the System must allow for readjustment concerning <b>job</b> <b>hierarchy.</b> Consequent-ly, it is necessary to provide a mechanism within the collective agreement which will make this possible. If, however, one opposes job readjustment because of possible upward salary modification, {{it would be best to}} abandon the idea of using a System of job evaluation. If a job is modified, the employee concerned should benefit from the resulting monetary advantages. On the one hand, the employee may either assume greater responsibilities or be required to have greater skills. On the other, the employer benefits from the accomplishment of a task which is more intricate or of superior quality. Refusal to allow the employee to benefit monetarily in such situations constitutes an injustice which might contribute to diminished motivation on the part of the employee and a deterioration of labour relations in the organization. The adoption of a System of job evaluation is not conceived to provide salary in-creases, but to distribute more equitably the total payroll. Additional considerations (psychological or orther) could induce an increase in the total payroll, but the basic principle remains unaltered. The negotiation of a salary structure, as well as individual salaries, involves a process different from that of the application of a job evaluation System...|$|E
40|$|The study {{examines}} {{the school to}} work transition at two Japanese vocationally oriented senior high schools. It focuses {{on the process of}} differentiation among non-university bound students making employment-related decisions and obtaining jobs. The ethnographic data collected over one year show that these students create their own trajectories by activating school-based and family-based resources. The thesis argues that the variation within the modal trajectory of this group is due to different perceptions and uses of different categories of these available resources. School resources are extensively made available to all students; they take the form of educational, social, symbolic and cultural resources provided under the job referral practice, which offers a wide-range of employment related activities and information based on the schools' accumulated data about companies and their ex-students. Differences in the use of school resources in the transition process can be observed at three levels. Firstly, available resources exist in an "objective" sense both in the family and at school. Secondly, habitus generates a selective perception of the available resources, and some students do not perceive that the resources will help them. Thirdly, habitus activates the resources in a particular way: based on their perceptions, students adjust their wishes to what they see as probable, and some consequently conduct "self-elimination" from seeking positions which they consider they cannot obtain. In this process influential people around students, both in the family and at school, can provide directed resources for immediate personal use; they can intervene in the students' perception and activation of resources and consequently can have an important impact on the final outcome. As a product of one's past experiences and material conditions, habitus acts as a carrier of social inequality and contributes to the reproduction of that inequality. Only school-based resources has any potential to counterbalance the trend towards reproduction in the transition process. The thesis argues that students who hold positive family resources, like the elites in Bourdieu's study, try to convert these resources into a job. which will in turn generate positive social and economic resources. Students without positive family resources, or those with negative family resources have to adopt a different strategy: namely, to convert a combination of the school-based resources into a job for their "life-after-school" by appropriating shared resources for their own individual, private use. For these students, the school-based resource substitutes for family resources. Hence, although the major differentiation takes place across institutions at the age of 16, the highly organised job referral practice at vocationally oriented high schools, rather than the school system as a whole, softens the determinism of reproduction within the non-elite school and <b>job</b> <b>hierarchy.</b> The practice provides an insight into the way the determining relationship between family background and job placement can be loosened. The extensive provision of school-based resources illuminates the process of, and extends the possibilities for, utilising school resources for obtaining jobs...|$|E

Prior research suggests that people often receive some combination of five benefits when seeking information from other people: 1) solutions; 2) meta-knowledge (pointers to databases or people); 3) problem reformulation; 4) validation of plans or solutions; and 5) legitimation from contact with a respected person. This research builds on that work by assessing the influence of organizational and social structures (such as similarity of <b>job</b> function, <b>hierarchy,</b> task interdependence, physical proximity, influence, trust, friendship, and gender) on receipt of these benefits from other people in a physically distributed organization. Task interdependence is the strongest and most consistent predictor of information seeking. However, social relations also affect the receipt of informational benefits, especially as they become more representational and affective. Implications are suggested for the study of social capital, computer-mediated communication, and organizational learning. Index Terms—Information, networks, relationships. I...|$|R
