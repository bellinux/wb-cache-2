40|$|Abstract. According to {{the vehicle}} braking {{efficiency}} road test rules in GB 7258, the braking efficiency on-line monitoring index, parameter, method and threshold are studied. Mean fully developed deceleration (MFDD) is selected as the evaluation index. Pitch angle {{which is used to}} monitor the road slope(less than 1 %) is collected by gyroscope. Vehicle maximum deceleration is collected at the period of ABS working, which {{is to make sure that}} the road adhesion coefficient is more than 0. 7. Vehicle maximum braking deceleration is analyzed, and it is used to exclude driving on pit, <b>decelerating</b> <b>band,</b> road step, even crash and so on. The rapid stop is identified with brake pedal travel senor. MFDD is calculated with braking deceleration and wheel speed, and wheel speed is collected from ABS with can bus. MFDD threshold is determined with passenger capacity monitoring with card reader. Finally, the method of vehicle braking efficiency on-line monitoring and evaluation with MFDD is given...|$|E
