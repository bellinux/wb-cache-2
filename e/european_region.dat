5|$|After Italy, Hungary was {{the first}} European country where the renaissance appeared. The Renaissance style came {{directly}} from Italy during the Quattrocento to Hungary first in the Central <b>European</b> <b>region,</b> thanks {{to the development of}} early Hungarian-Italian relationships – not only in dynastic connections, but also in cultural, humanistic and commercial relations – growing in strength from the 14th century. The relationship between Hungarian and Italian Gothic styles was a second reason – exaggerated breakthrough of walls is avoided, preferring clean and light structures. Large-scale building schemes provided ample and long term work for the artists, for example, the building of the Friss (New) Castle in Buda, the castles of Visegrád, Tata and Várpalota. In Sigismund's court there were patrons such as Pipo Spano, a descendant of the Scolari family of Florence, who invited Manetto Ammanatini and Masolino da Pannicale to Hungary.|$|E

During the transformation to a market-oriented economy, the government privatized several banks, recapitalized the rest, and introduced legal reforms that made the sector more competitive.

25|$|After {{the end of}} {{the late}} Middle Ages period, the Renaissance spread {{unevenly}} over continental Europe from the southern <b>European</b> <b>region.</b> The intellectual transformation of the Renaissance is viewed as a bridge between the Middle Ages and the Modern era. Europeans would later begin an era of world discovery. Combined with the influx of classical ideas was the invention of printing which facilitated dissemination of the printed word and democratized learning. These two things would lead to the Protestant Reformation. Europeans also discovered new trading routes, {{as was the case with}} Columbus’ travel to the Americas in 1492, and Vasco da Gama’s circumnavigation of Africa and India in 1498. Their discoveries strengthened the economy and power of European nations.|$|E
25|$|Lesbian, gay, {{bisexual}} and transgender (LGBT) {{rights in}} Malta {{are of the}} highest standards, even by comparison to other European countries, according to the United Nations.

Malta has been recognized for providing a high degree of liberty to its LGBT citizens. In October 2015, the <b>European</b> <b>region</b> of the International Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Trans and Intersex Association (ILGA-Europe) ranked Malta 1st in terms of LGBT rights out of 49 observed European countries. Malta is one of the only few countries in the world to have made LGBT rights equal at a constitutional level. In 2016, Malta became the first country in the European Union to ban conversion therapy.|$|E
25|$|Probably {{the biggest}} reason behind the spread of Islam in the region was the very weak {{presence}} of the Church in Bosnia at the time. The old competition between the Catholic and Bosnian churches (along with the Orthodox Church in certain areas) contributed to a very weak and disorganized religious structure in much of Bosnia. To many Bosnians religion {{was a combination of}} traditions and superstitions. Compared to the well-funded and organized religious institutions of their neighbors, it was relatively easy for Bosnians to switch from their folk-Christianity to Islam. It is significant that the only other <b>European</b> <b>region</b> under Ottoman control where {{a large segment of the}} population adopted Islam was Albania; also home to competing Christian sects. Some taxes on Muslims and orthodox Vlachs were also lighter than those on other rayah. The Hatt-ı Şerif attempted to eliminate this uneven taxation.|$|E
