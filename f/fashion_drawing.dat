5|$|The walled towns {{were planned}} {{out in a}} regular <b>fashion,</b> <b>drawing</b> both on the {{experience}} of equivalent bastides in France and on various English planned settlements. Their new residents were English migrants, with the local Welsh banned from living inside the walls. The towns had varying levels of success. Measured in terms of burgages, town properties rented from the Crown by citizens, Conwy had 99 around 1295, and Caernarfon had 57 in 1298. Harlech lagged badly behind in terms of growth, and the town had only 24 and a half burgages in 1305. The castles were entrusted by Edward to constables, charged to defend them and, in some cases, also empowered to defend the town walls as well. Permanent garrisons of soldiers were established, 40 at Caernarfon, 30 at Conwy and 36 at Harlech, equipped with crossbows and armour. The castles and towns were all ports and could be supplied by sea if necessary, an important strategic advantage as Edward's navy had near total dominance around the Welsh coastline. The castles were each equipped with a rear or postern gate {{that would allow them to}} resupplied directly by sea even if the town had fallen.|$|E
2500|$|Boho-chic is a {{style of}} <b>fashion</b> <b>drawing</b> on various bohemian and hippie influences, which, at its height in late 2005 was {{associated}} particularly with actress Sienna Miller and model Kate Moss in the United Kingdom and (as [...] "boho" [...] chic) actress and businesswoman Mary-Kate Olsen in the United States. It has been seen since the early 1990s and, although appearing to wane from time to time, has repeatedly re-surfaced in varying guises. Many elements of boho-chic became popular in the late 1960s and some date back much further, being associated, for example, with pre-Raphaelite women of the mid-to-late 19th century.|$|E

The essence of a brand or a product in these industries resides in its meaning for the consumer rather than in its function.|$|R

40|$|Contemporary American reviewers heralded Anna Cora Mowatt’s Fashion! or Life in New York (1845) as {{the first}} major “native comedy. ” A satire of American enthrallment to European style, <b>Fashion</b> <b>draws</b> {{inspiration}} from Mowatt’s own cosmopolitan background and eccentric position within the upper middle-class milieu. The play’s focus on the characters’ misinterpretations, and its staging of fashion as a system of signs that need correct translation, testify to the author’s concern with language and its communicative dilemmas. Through the characters’ linguistic lapses and affectations Mowatt develops a critique of American middle-class conspicuous consumption, which she envisions as a speech devoid of content and lacking significance...|$|R
5000|$|Heroin chic <b>fashion</b> <b>drew</b> much {{criticism}} and scorn, especially from anti-drug groups. Fashion designers, models such as Kate Moss and Jaime King, and movies such as Trainspotting were blamed for glamorizing heroin use. Then-U.S. president Bill Clinton condemned the look. Other commentators denied that fashion images made drug use itself more attractive. [...] "There {{is no reason}} to expect that people attracted to the look promoted by Calvin Klein and other advertisers... will also be attracted to heroin, any more than suburban teen-agers who wear baggy pants and backward caps will end up shooting people from moving cars", wrote Jacob Sullum in Reason magazine.|$|R

40|$|From 1945 to date, {{the state}} {{has been at the}} centre of debates in IR theorizing.

This paper in a discursive cum historical <b>fashion,</b> <b>drawn</b> mainly from secondary source, examined the nature of the debates in order to decipher its limit or limitlessness in comtemporary IR theorising. The paper, after a careful diagnosis of the concept of the state as well as undergoing the genealogical survey of state centrism in IR theorising, concludes that the state though is still the primary actor in IR but the empirical realities of the post WWII World have confirmed that it is no longer, what it used to be. Hence, it has limits in contemporary IR theorizing...|$|R
