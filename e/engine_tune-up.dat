2500|$|The cars in GT5 are {{separated}} into two categories, standard and premium. Standard cars are imported models from GT4 and GT PSP, they have lower polygon counts and texture resolution, standard headlights and basic damage modelling. In addition, after the Spec 2.0 update they feature simplified interior camera views. For open-topped cars, {{they have a}} functioning steering wheel and working gauges. Premium cars are cars modeled for GT5 and thus have higher polygon counts, high texture resolution, feature headlights capable {{of high and low}} beams, detailed interior camera views, and detailed damage models. Premium cars also have working windshield wipers which are operated on tracks with rain or snow. Around 20% of all cars in the game fall into the [...] "premium" [...] category. [...] "Premium" [...] cars also allow for vast customization, including (but not limited to): aerodynamic kits, <b>engine</b> <b>tune-ups,</b> weight reduction, etc. [...] "Standard" [...] cars are also able to have modifications such as weight reductions and tuneups. Since update 2.02, appropriate standard cars are also able to change their rims, a feature only previously seen on premium cars.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Modern {{automotive}} {{petrol engine}} performance is significantly affected by effective tune-up. Current practice of <b>engine</b> <b>tune-up</b> {{relies on the}} experience of the automotive engineer, and tune-up is usually done by trial-and-error method and then the vehicle engine is run on the dynamometer to show the actual engine performance. Obviously the current practice involves a large amount of time and money, and then may even fail to tune up the engine optimally because a formal performance model of the engine has not been determined yet. With an emerging technique, Support Vector Machines (SVM), the approximate per-formance model of a petrol vehicle engine can be determined by training the sample engine performance data acquired from the dynamometer. The number of dynamometer tests for an <b>engine</b> <b>tune-up</b> can therefore be reduced because the estimated engine performance model can replace the dynamometer tests to a certain extent. In this paper, the construction, validation and accuracy of the model are discussed. The study showed that the predicted results agree well with the actual test results. To illustrate the significance of the SVM methodology, the results were also compared with that regressed using multilayer feedforward neural networks...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 1971 Many {{changes have}} been taking place in Oregon's agriculture. Average size of farms has increased. The trend is toward fewer but larger, highly {{mechanized}} farms, leading to changed demand for farm machinery and consequently changes in farm machinery firms to meet the changing demands of farmers. In general, the research question of interest was: "What are {{the most effective and}} efficient ways farm machinery firms might adjust to the changing demands of farmers for used farm machinery and related products and services. The specific purposes of this study were to 1) evaluate farmers' and dealers' attitudes and preferences relative to guarantees on used equipment, farm service centers and information services, 2) to evaluate inconsistencies between farmers and dealer attitudes and preferences, and 3) to evaluate which of selected farm, farmer, dealer, and dealership characteristics {{may or may not be}} related to respective attitudes and preferences of farmers and dealers. Farm machinery dealers in Oregon, Washington and Western Idaho were sent questionnaires. Questionnaires were also sent to a sample of all Oregon farmers. The relationships of interest were tested for significance via a computerized contingency analysis. The farmers' attitudes and preferences suggest strongly that gross sales of used equipment could be increased if machinery dealers would provide guarantees more acceptable to farmers. Apparently, smaller farmers in particular might be induced to purchase more used equipment if guarantees were more acceptable to them. Farmers in general indicated a preference for used equipment guarantees that cover all breakdowns for a longer period, with larger farmers preferring guarantees covering only major breakdowns. Farmers were divided as to whether used equipment guarantees should cover all or half the labor costs of repairing breakdowns, but felt more strongly that guarantees should cover all parts costs. They were also divided as to whether the guarantee period should be 30, 60 or 90 days. Dealers, however, strongly preferred guarantees covering 30 days and 1 / 2 the labor and parts costs. Farmers preferred to have more acceptable guarantees rather than lower prices, which suggests a willingness to pay some price for the added services. Farmers indicated farm service centers would be more convenient for them. Smaller farmers were more inclined than larger farmers to prefer doing business with a farm service center. The study indicates about 2 / 5 of a service centers' customers would be within 25 miles and 4 / 5 within 50 miles. Farmers much preferred to have service centers house competing suppliers of products and services, and decidedly felt the service center should be located outside the city limits of towns. Farmers were divided as to whether the service center should be operated as a farmers' cooperative, as independent business or as a combination of both. Three fourths or more of the farmers preferred that farm service centers carry the following products, listed in order of priority, highest priority first: Farm machinery; fertilizer; chemicals; hardware and power tools; tires, batteries and accessories; and feed, followed closely by a preference for a blacksmith and machine shop, and irrigation supplies. Farmers indicated a substantial preference for machinery related information/educational services, with primary preference for material relating to machinery and equipment maintenance, minor engine repairs, equipment leasing and <b>engine</b> <b>tune-ups.</b> The information/ educational services appealed particularly to larger farmers, farmers planning larger machinery expenditures and younger farmers...|$|R
