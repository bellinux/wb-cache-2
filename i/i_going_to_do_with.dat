500|$|Constance {{returns home}} from the hairdresser to find that her {{grandson}} Michael, the Antichrist, has killed his nanny. She smiles and remarks, [...] "Now what am <b>I</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> you?" [...] as Michael gleefully smiles back, while swinging {{back and forth in}} his rocking chair.|$|E
2500|$|The album's themes include {{mortality}} and growing older, or, as Taylor described it, [...] "just realizing, 'I'm not {{as young as}} I used to be, what am <b>I</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> myself? I don't have eternity to stay here so I need {{to get up and}} do something and make it worthwhile'—whatever that means." [...] Pierre's lyricism includes a mix of fact and fiction, which is intended to leave the listener guessing. The album's tone is reflective, which was spurred from Pierre having time to sit at home to write and think. He looked at his relationship with lead guitarist Joshua Cain, noting that the two had written and played music together for 15 years at that point. Pierre felt [...] "overwhelmed with the eventual demise of everything," [...] and considered the fact that [...] "nothing lasts forever" [...] is one of the album's most important points. Occasionally, Pierre's lyricism was considered too personal or dark by other members. One lyric from [...] "Timelines", paraphrased by Pierre in an interview as [...] "rushing into every pore, the whiskey stench of open sores", was changed to [...] "scattered seeds of sycamore," [...] as Cain found the lyric gross, noting it [...] "literally made [...] stomach sick." ...|$|E
6000|$|My {{interview}} with the Registrar, my talk with my uncle, my abrupt discovery of the hopeless futility of my passion for Marion, had combined to bring me to sense of crisis. What was <b>I</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> life? ...|$|E

6000|$|When he {{had left}} her alone, she {{remained}} where she was standing, by her wardrobe, without sound or movement, thinking: What am <b>I</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>do?</b> How am <b>I</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> live? ...|$|R

5000|$|June, 1999: In an {{interview}} with L'Équipe, Roussel alleged that when he told Virenque of Voet being arrested, Virenque replied mes produits, comment Je vais faire maintenant? which could be translated as my products/stuff - what am <b>I</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> now? ...|$|R

6000|$|Jeff told, {{as nearly}} {{as he could}} remember, and he told what Cynthia and he had {{afterward}} jointly worked out as to {{the best thing for}} Jackson to do. Mrs. Durgin listened frowningly, but not disapprovingly, as it seemed; though at the end she asked: [...] "And what am <b>I</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>do,</b> <b>with</b> Jackson gone?" ...|$|E
6000|$|In the retrospect {{each of us}} {{seems to}} have been talking about our outlook almost continually. Each of us, you see, was full of the same question, very near and {{altogether}} predominant to us, the question: [...] "What am <b>I</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> my life?" [...] He saw it almost as importantly as I, but from a different angle, because his choice was largely made and mine still hung in the balance.|$|E
6000|$|... "Thought Miss Mayberry {{was making}} them creak," [...] said Lodloe. [...] "But she is not, {{and you may}} as well {{postpone}} the lesson I suppose you want to give her. She is at present taking lessons in botany from another professor"; and he hereupon stated in brief the facts of the desertion of the infant Douglas. [...] "Now what am <b>I</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> the little chap?" [...] he continued; [...] "I must search for Mrs. Petter." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "McCall {{told me the}} Rube {{had been}} down in the mouth ever since Henderson joined the team. Milly, I don't like Henderson a whole lot. He's not in the Rube's class as a pitcher.

6000|$|... "But oh, what's the use? I can't ever be {{anything}} but a dub! Cleaning my nails, to make a hit with a girl that's got hands like hers! It's a long trail to Seattle, but it's a darn sight longer one to being--being--well, sophisticated. Oh!

6000|$|Her joy in this present, her astonishment at my {{unexpected}} {{appearance on}} the railway platform, amused and delighted me. I could scarcely convince her that at six o'clock on Saturday night I was in a New Mexico town, waiting for the eastern express. It was all a piece of miraculous adventure on my part, but her evident pleasure in its successful working out made me rich--and very humble. [...] "What {{did you do it}} for?" [...] she asked; then, with a look of dismay, she added, [...] "What am <b>I</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> you in Hanover?" ...|$|E
6000|$|The thought {{uppermost}} in Lingard's mind was: [...] "What {{on earth}} am <b>I</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> them?" [...] And {{no one seemed}} to care what he would do. Jaffir with eight others quartered on the main hatch, looked to each other's wounds and conversed interminably in low tones, cheerful and quiet, like well-behaved children. Each of them had saved his kris, but Lingard had to make a distribution of cotton cloth out of his trade-goods. Whenever he passed by them, they all looked after him gravely. Hassim and Immada lived in the cuddy. The chief's sister took the air only in the evening and those two could be heard every night, invisible and murmuring {{in the shadows of the}} quarter-deck. Every Malay on board kept respectfully away from them.|$|E
60|$|Coming out of {{the bright}} light of the studio I didn’t make out Therese very distinctly. She, however, having groped in dark cupboards, must have had her pupils {{sufficiently}} dilated to have seen that I had my hat on my head. This has its importance because after what I had said to her upstairs it must have convinced her that I was going out on some midnight business. I passed her without a word and heard behind me {{the door of the}} studio close with an unexpected crash. It strikes me now that under the circumstances I might have without shame gone back to listen at the keyhole. But truth to say the association of events was not so clear in my mind as it may be to the reader of this story. Neither were the exact connections of persons present to my mind. And, besides, one doesn’t listen at a keyhole but in pursuance of some plan; unless one is afflicted by a vulgar and fatuous curiosity. But that vice is not in my character. As to plan, I had none. I moved along the passage between the dead wall and the black-and-white marble elevation of the staircase with hushed footsteps, as though there had been a mortally sick person somewhere in the house. And the only person that could have answered to that description was Señor Ortega. I moved on, stealthy, absorbed, undecided; asking myself earnestly: “What on earth am <b>I</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> him?” That exclusive preoccupation of my mind was as dangerous to Señor Ortega as typhoid fever would have been. It strikes me that this comparison is very exact. People recover from typhoid fever, but generally the chance is considered poor. This was precisely his case. His chance was poor; though I had no more animosity towards him than a virulent disease has against the victim it lays low. He really would have nothing to reproach me with; he had run up against me, unwittingly, as a man enters an infected place, and now he was very ill, very ill indeed. No, I had no plans against him. I had only the feeling that he was in mortal danger.|$|E

It was our finale, and we always got a great hand for it. Say, what am <b>I</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> about it anyway? Ditch it? Or get some young lions?" ...|$|R

5000|$|However, in April 2004, after {{preparing}} {{for more than}} three years, the family finally decided to sell the park. At that time Bobbejaanland employed 400 people and was taken over by Parques Reunidos, a Spanish-American amusement park group. It remained uncertain until the very last minute whether the founder would put his signature on the deal. Uncertainty over the future of amusement parks was ultimately decisive. The Schoepen family chose the more certain path, which also seemed evident to the founder. After the sale, when the news program Terzake on the Flemish Broadcast VRT asked him if he had chosen to take the big money, Schoepen answered, staring ahead blankly, [...] "What am <b>I</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> all that money; I can only eat twice a day." ...|$|E
50|$|So we have {{intention}} (’dun-pa, Skt. chanda). The {{intention is}} {{the wish to}} obtain an object, or to achieve a goal, or {{to do something with}} it. It can be to meet with what we’ve previously met with, not to be parted with what we’re presently being aware of, or it can be keen interest to engage with something in the future. So Buddha has the intention to benefit everybody. I mean, we have intention all the time. I’m looking at this cup of water, paying attention to it, etc., and there’s the intention: What am <b>I</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> it? I’m going to pick it up and drink it. So, obviously, because we have intention we would like to make it pure and have a pure intention to benefit everybody—no matter what we’re doing, may it be of benefit to everyone.|$|E
