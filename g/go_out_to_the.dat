5|$|In every {{review and}} study {{conducted}} to date, the courage, valor, and {{discipline of the}} soldiers who fought at Wanat have been universally praised. These soldiers were well-trained, well-led, and fought bravely to defeat a determined and intense enemy action to overrun their base in Wanat. They persevered in a fashion that deserves broad recognition of their bravery and tenacity. Our hearts <b>go</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> families of the fallen soldiers.|$|E
5|$|Graf saw {{his first}} {{aircraft}} {{when he was}} twelve years old. This sight created a conflict between his passion for football and a new obsession with flying. From 1930, {{he worked at the}} Engen town hall and saved all his money to buy a glider. Before his 20th birthday, he provided a homemade glider to the new Engen Sailplane Club. Every Sunday he would <b>go</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> nearby Ballenberg mountain until a heavy crash destroyed his glider in the fall of 1932. In 1935, after Adolf Hitler officially revoked the Treaty of Versailles, Graf applied for flight training in the newly created Luftwaffe.|$|E
5|$|Stepbrothers Phineas and Ferb, {{along with}} their father Lawrence and sister Candace, go to an Egyptian-themed movie theater where they see a movie about two archeologists who {{discover}} an undead mummy. Phineas and Ferb are inspired {{to find their own}} mummy and <b>go</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> basement of the theater, where there is rumored to be a mummy. Candace sees them going off to do this and follows them, hoping to get them in trouble with their father. However, as Phineas and Ferb go searching for the mummy through the basement hallways wearing archeologist hats, they run into what they believe are booby traps; they avoid the traps but Candace ends up getting hit by them all. Eventually, she becomes caught up in raggy toilet paper and cannot talk properly (due to eating stale bubble gum), which leads to the boys mistaking her for the mummy and capturing her.|$|E

25|$|The sergeants were of {{interest}} to SHAI since they belonged to the field security unit and worked with the Tulkarm police, which {{was in charge of}} the Sharon district. Their mission was to circulate within the local population and pick up information on the Irgun and Lehi and their supporters. They often operated in civilian clothes and were not subject to standing orders intended to prevent abduction attempts. Notably, they did not have to leave camp in groups of four, and sometimes went unarmed. Weinberg was very successful in his task, and occasionally got the sergeants to <b>go</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Netanya beach.|$|E
25|$|I wish {{to express}} my heartfelt horror at the {{indiscriminate}} terrorist attacks committed against innocent people of the United States yesterday. While {{it is still not}} clear who carried out the attack, it must be stated that no right-thinking follower of Islam could possibly condone such an action. The Qur'an equates the murder of one innocent person with the murder of the whole of humanity. We pray for the families of all those who lost their lives in this unthinkable act of violence as well as all those injured; I hope to reflect the feelings of all Muslims and people around the world whose sympathies <b>go</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> victims of this sorrowful moment.|$|E
25|$|On {{the night}} of February 10, 1981, an arson fire started at the Las Vegas Hilton, {{which at the time}} was being {{retrofitted}} with modern fire safety equipment. Firefighters, using the knowledge they had learned from the MGM Grand fire, used local television networks to notify people to stay in their rooms and not <b>go</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> halls and stairwells. Because of the lessons learned, only eight people died in this fire compared with the 85 people who died in the MGM Grand fire. Famed singer Natalie Cole was trapped inside the Hilton during the fire, possibly sustaining lung damage from smoke inhalation that was not detected by doctors in 1981. In 1982, Philip Bruce Cline was sentenced to eight life sentences for his role in starting the fire.|$|E

25|$|By {{the end of}} the day, Jalisco and its {{surroundings}} states were restored to normality, but Jalisco authorities recommended its citizens to remain indoors if they had no obligation to <b>go</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> streets. The red alert lasted until May 3, and the government issued a preventative security phase following the red alert's cancellation. The government clarified that the coordinated efforts of all three levels of government continued uninterrupted despite the cancellation. Governor Sandoval Díaz denied that the additional federal forces in Jalisco meant that the state was being militarized. The government confirmed that in addition to the passengers killed in Villa Purificación, 8 suspected CJNG members and a state police officer from Autlán were killed in other clashes derived from the May 1 attacks. Several state and federal police officers were reported wounded in confrontations in Jalisco and other states.|$|E
500|$|The first {{match that}} aired {{as part of}} the {{pay-per-view}} was Drew McIntyre defending his Intercontinental Championship against Kofi Kingston. Kingston took the early advantage, by performing a suicide dive to the outside of the ring on McIntyre. McIntyre threw Kingston in the ringpost, and went on the offense. Kingston was able to counter McIntyre's [...] "Future Shock" [...] DDT, and perform his finishing move, the S.O.S, to pin McIntyre for the victory and the championship. Following the match, McIntyre demanded that Teddy Long <b>go</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> ring and reverse the decision, but instead McIntyre was attacked by Matt Hardy, who McIntyre had attacked on several occasions in the prior weeks.|$|E

Only the best horses and the best jockeys are allowed to enter and all horses are inspected by the vet when they arrive at Aintree to ensure that they are fit to race. This year we had 20 horse-catchers, at least two attendants at each of the 16 fences, four stewards to inspect the course, two BHA course inspectors, ten vets, 50 ground staff and 35 ground repair staff... We work closely with animal welfare organisations, such as the RSPCA and World Horse Welfare, to make sure we are up to date with the latest thinking and research... {{and to make sure that}} the horses are looked after properly and that the race is run as safely as possible." ...|$|E

500|$|In chapter 40, Gangleri muses that Valhalla must {{be quite}} crowded, to which High {{responds}} {{by stating that}} Valhalla is massive and remains roomy despite {{the large amount of}} inhabitants, and then quotes Grímnismál stanza 23. In chapter 41, Gangleri says that Odin seems to be quite a powerful lord, as he controls quite a big army, but he yet wonders how the Einherjar keep themselves busy when they are not drinking. High replies that daily, after they've dressed and put on their war gear, they <b>go</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> courtyard and battle one another in one-on-one combat for sport. Then, when mealtime comes, they ride home to Valhalla and drink. High then quotes Vafþrúðnismál stanza 41. In chapter 42, High describes that, [...] "right at the beginning, when the gods were settling" [...] they had established Asgard and then built Valhalla. The death of the god Baldr is recounted in chapter 49, where the mistletoe that is used to kill Baldr is described as growing west of Valhalla.|$|E
500|$|Mendelson {{called the}} trailer [...] "a {{textbook}} case for unnecessary second pitches...Is there anyone {{out there who}} watched that first teaser back in December and said 'Hmm, it looks good and all, but I need more evidence'?" [...] He added that he was [...] "a little disappointed by the big Spider-Man reveal," [...] having previously wondered, after a Spider-Man character poster was not released with the others, if Marvel would have the [...] "courage" [...] to not include the character in any marketing materials before the film's release, letting the [...] "Peter Parker scenes the film has to offer be something that is a surprise for theatrical moviegoers and/or something that drives post-opening weekend buzz". Mendelson's colleague at Forbes Mark Hughes felt differently, noting that the trailer was targeting the general audience rather than just fans by giving [...] "us more explanation [...] of why a clearly major battle is raging between Captain America and Iron Man", and by including Spider-Man since [...] "there are plenty of surprises in these movies, and since we all already know Spider-Man is in Civil War, refusing to let us see him would frankly be a bit weird and pointless ... it's common for average filmgoers to hear some final bit of information or see some final image and feel compelled, inspired, or otherwise driven to <b>go</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> movies that day. There {{are any number of}} factors that can come into play...and the world needed to see [...] because it’s the sort of value-added element that can make [...] difference". Graeme McMillan of The Hollywood Reporter felt that the Spider-Man reveal [...] "alone makes the trailer", describing it as feeling [...] "like the comic book character come to life. That awkward, voice-cracking, 'hey everyone' was as humble, playing-it-cool and cocky as he should be." ...|$|E
500|$|The WWF {{received}} some support {{from people who}} felt that the company {{did the right thing}} by continuing the event. Vince Russo, a WWF script writer at the time, pointed to the fact that Brian Pillman, a family friend of the Harts and a member of The Hart Foundation, died shortly before the [...] pay-per-view on which he was scheduled to perform in 1997. After learning of Pillman's death, both Bret and Owen Hart went ahead with their matches on the show. Russo claimed that this showed that [...] "the night he passed away I'm sure Owen would have wanted the same thing." [...] Vince McMahon refused to comment on Hart's death until he felt sufficient time had passed. When asked if he felt responsible for the accident, he replied, [...] "I have a lot to say and I will say it. I promise you that. But {{this is not the time}} to do it.... Give me a few days. Give me to the end of the week. Then we'll talk." [...] The day after Over the Edge, the WWF published a message in the Calgary Sun, stating, [...] "We do not have much information as to how it happened and will not know until an investigation is completed. We are all shaken, and to say Owen will be missed is to fall short of a way to fully explain what he meant to us." [...] Although the WWF had no information, they reported that [...] "Our thoughts and prayers <b>go</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> entire Hart family. We have to be strong for Owen; he was an extraordinary human being and consummate performer and knows that the highest tribute that we can pay is to go on entertaining the fans he loved so much." ...|$|E
