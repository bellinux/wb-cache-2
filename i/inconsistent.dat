5|$|Cantor {{extended}} {{his work on}} the absolute infinite by using it in a proof. Around 1895, he began to regard his well-ordering principle as a theorem and attempted to prove it. In 1899, he sent Dedekind a proof of the equivalent aleph theorem: the cardinality of every infinite set is an aleph. First, he defined two types of multiplicities: consistent multiplicities (sets) and <b>inconsistent</b> multiplicities (absolutely infinite multiplicities). Next he assumed that the ordinals form a set, proved that this leads to a contradiction, and concluded that the ordinals form an <b>inconsistent</b> multiplicity. He used this <b>inconsistent</b> multiplicity to prove the aleph theorem. In 1932, Zermelo criticized the construction in Cantor's proof.|$|E
5|$|Definitions of mild {{traumatic}} brain injury (MTBI) were <b>inconsistent</b> until the World Health Organization's International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD-10) provided a consistent, authoritative definition across specialties in 1992.|$|E

The amplitude of the radial velocity signal is <b>inconsistent</b> with stellar variations on stars with 55 Cancri A's low level of chromospheric activity.|$|E
5|$|Keable's {{distinction}} between the historical and the traditional Jesus, Wilson argued, was ultimately muddled and internally <b>inconsistent,</b> his verdicts on the illiberality of the contemporary church at odds with his own abiding conviction.|$|E
5|$|The {{hospital}} {{treatment of the}} victims, as recorded by Chinese state media, is <b>inconsistent</b> with proper care of severe burn victims: for instance, patients were not kept in sterile rooms.|$|E
5|$|A related {{objection}} is {{that evolution}} {{is based on}} unreliable evidence, claiming that evolution is not even well-evidenced. Typically, this is either based on the argument that evolution's evidence is full of frauds and hoaxes, that current evidence for evolution {{is likely to be}} overturned as some past evidence has been, or that certain types of evidence are <b>inconsistent</b> and dubious.|$|E

5|$|Although it {{is thought}} to have a body-centered cubic crystal {{structure}} from absolute zero to its melting point, high-resolution measurements of the thermal expansion along the three crystallographic axes reveal anisotropies which are <b>inconsistent</b> with a cubic structure. Therefore, further research and discovery in this area is expected.|$|E
5|$|At present, {{there is}} no {{definitive}} evidence to support that any particular measure is effective in preventing AD. Global studies of measures to prevent or delay the onset of AD have often produced <b>inconsistent</b> results.|$|E
5|$|Because of the <b>inconsistent</b> {{nature of}} {{the record of the}} action, {{contemporary}} and historical coverage of it has been easily colored by preferences for one account over another. Francis Parkman, for example, accepted Washington's account, and was highly dismissive of the accounts by Monceau and the Indian.|$|E
5|$|Cantor avoided paradoxes by {{recognizing}} {{that there are}} two types of multiplicities. In his set theory, when it is assumed that the ordinals form a set, the resulting contradiction only implies that the ordinals form an <b>inconsistent</b> multiplicity. On the other hand, Bertrand Russell treated all collections as sets, which leads to paradoxes. In Russell's set theory, the ordinals form a set, so the resulting contradiction implies that the theory is <b>inconsistent.</b> From 1901 to 1903, Russell discovered three paradoxes implying that his set theory is inconsistent: the Burali-Forti paradox (which was just mentioned), Cantor's paradox, and Russell's paradox. Russell named paradoxes after Cesare Burali-Forti and Cantor even though neither of them believed that they had found paradoxes.|$|E
5|$|Cases in the United Kingdom were {{previously}} <b>inconsistent</b> upon {{the issue of}} permitting representative standing.

5|$|Christoph Benzmuller and Bruno Woltzenlogel Paleo used an {{automated}} theorem prover to validate Scott's version of Gödel's ontological argument. It {{has been shown}} by the same researchers that Gödel's ontological argument is <b>inconsistent.</b> However, Scott's version of Gödel's ontological argument is consistent and thus valid.|$|E
5|$|Critics in {{the media}} noted BA's build quality faults, such as <b>inconsistent</b> gaps between trim {{sections}} and joints, although other commentators praised the interior design and craftsmanship. In the used car market, BA Falcons tend to suffer from poor depreciation rates, due to influxes of ex-fleet models entering the second-hand market {{and because of the}} cost of fuel.|$|E
5|$|Curcumin as of 2010 has {{not shown}} benefit in people {{even though there}} is {{tentative}} evidence in animals. There is <b>inconsistent</b> and unconvincing evidence that ginkgo has any positive effect on cognitive impairment and dementia. As of 2008 there is no concrete evidence that cannabinoids are effective in improving the symptoms of AD or dementia; however, some research looks promising.|$|E

5|$|He {{ended the}} 2006–07 Ashes with {{a century and}} two fifties, totalling 229 runs at 45.80 at a strike rate of over 100 as Australia regained the Ashes with a 5–0 whitewash. It was an <b>inconsistent</b> series; aside from three scores mentioned, Gilchrist failed to pass one in his other three innings. Between Ashes series, Gilchrist had {{averaged}} only 25 with one Test century.|$|E

5|$|In 2014, Purcell {{wrote and}} {{directed}} the Pixar Christmas special Toy Story That Time Forgot which aired on ABC on December 2, 2014. Purcell is not considering the possibility of Pixar adapting Sam & Max into a film, as the characters' moral ambiguity is <b>inconsistent</b> with traditional Pixar stories.|$|E
5|$|In the {{shortened}} 2011–12 NBA season, the Blazers {{got off to}} a 7–2 start. But {{the team}} quickly began to collapse, as starting point guard Raymond Felton, among others, struggled with McMillan's new approach to a running-style offense. The team gained some notability as Aldridge was named to his first All-Star Game. Despite Aldridge's performance, {{the rest of the team}} became more <b>inconsistent.</b>|$|E
5|$|James Morris {{notes that}} Hick's eschatological {{verification}} {{theory has been}} criticised for being <b>inconsistent</b> with his belief in religious pluralism. Morris argues that such criticism can be overcome by modifying Hick's parable to include multiple travellers, all with different beliefs, on the road. He argues that even if some beliefs about life after death are unverifiable, Hick's belief in bodily resurrection can still be verified.|$|E
5|$|No {{subsidiary}} legislation made under an Act of Parliament may be <b>inconsistent</b> with {{the provisions of}} any Act. This means that any {{subsidiary legislation}} that was made ultra vires its parent Act (that is, the Act did not confer power on the agency to make the subsidiary legislation) or is not consistent with any other statute is void {{to the extent of}} the inconsistency.|$|E
5|$|Only twice did the Marshall Court hear {{criminal}} cases under § 25. In Cohens v. Virginia (1821), the Court upheld a state lottery law conviction {{because the federal}} lottery was authorized only in the District of Columbia. In Worcester v. Georgia (1832), the Court reversed Worcester's conviction for being present in Cherokee country as <b>inconsistent</b> with federal law.|$|E
5|$|Residential school {{deaths were}} common {{and have been}} linked to the {{persistence}} of poorly constructed and maintained facilities. The actual number of deaths remains unknown due to <b>inconsistent</b> reporting by school officials and the destruction of medical and administrative records in compliance with retention and disposition policies for government records. Research by the TRC revealed that at least 6,000 students had died, mostly from disease.|$|E
5|$|Reviewers {{criticized the}} AI, which some found <b>inconsistent.</b> Whitehead criticized his {{experience}} of enemies that can see Corvo {{from a great}} distance yet sometimes remain unaware of him while in his enemies' peripheral vision. Juba criticized the <b>inconsistent</b> detection by enemies that lead to unpredictable and unreliable stealth mechanics that could force stealth-focused players into a combat situation, for which their character is not built. According to G4's Jake Gaskill, the AI worked well in combat, with enemies employing different tactics and effectively countering attacks, but when not alerted, enemies would ignore actions directly in front of them. Watters also mentioned lulls in enemy intelligence, but he said that it remained tenacious enough to keep the enemies formidable.|$|E
5|$|Sales {{and profits}} grew {{year-on-year}} {{during the early}} 1950s. The prepayment from the government was repaid in 1952. For a short time, VAT imported and marketed clearing tractors produced by Italian firm Ansaldo-Fossati. Although there was demand {{for this type of}} vehicle, they sold poorly because their price was considered <b>inconsistent</b> with their technical quality; only a few units were delivered in 1953.|$|E
5|$|Such late {{admission}} is <b>inconsistent</b> {{with the process}} of hospice, which is to alleviate patient distress over a period of time, based on time for patients and family members to develop relationships with the hospice team.|$|E
5|$|The Aruban prosecutor's office {{attempted}} {{to obtain an}} arrest warrant for Van der Sloot based on the tapes; however, a judge denied the request. The prosecutor appealed the denial, but the appeal failed on February 14, 2008. The appeals {{court held that the}} statements on the tape were <b>inconsistent</b> with evidence in the case and were insufficient to hold Van der Sloot.|$|E
5|$|The Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights {{interpret}} the Covenant as also requiring states {{to respect the}} academic freedom of staff and students, as this is vital for the educational process. It also considers corporal punishment in schools to be <b>inconsistent</b> with the Covenant's underlying principle of {{the dignity of the}} individual.|$|E
5|$|The Yosemite Firefall, {{in which}} the embers from a bonfire were pushed off a cliff near Glacier Point to create a {{spectacular}} effect, was ended in 1968 because it was deemed to be <b>inconsistent</b> with park values. The firefall was occasionally performed in the 1870s and became a nightly tradition with the founding of Camp Curry.|$|E
5|$|The {{battery life}} of the new models also {{received}} mixed reception, with outlets reporting <b>inconsistent</b> battery life and inaccurate estimates of time remaining on battery by the operating system. Apple addressed the latter by hiding the display of estimated battery time remaining entirely in a macOS update. Consumer Reports did not initially recommend the 2016 MacBook Pro models, citing <b>inconsistent</b> and unpredictable battery life in its lab testing (which involves the consecutive loading of multiple websites). However, Apple and Consumer Reports found that the results had been affected by a bug caused by disabling caching in Safari's developer tools. Consumer Reports performed the tests again with a patched macOS, and retracted its original assessment.|$|E
