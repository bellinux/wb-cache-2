5|$|A key {{assessment}} {{that is made}} after diagnosis is whether surgical removal of the tumor is possible (see Staging), as {{this is the only}} cure for this cancer. Whether or not surgical resection can be offered depends on how much the cancer has spread. The exact location of the tumor is also a significant factor, and CT can show how <b>it</b> <b>relates</b> <b>to</b> the major blood vessels passing close to the pancreas. The general health of the person must also be assessed, though age in itself is not an obstacle to surgery.|$|E

5|$|To {{the south}} of Somerset there is an upland {{with a series of}} rolling valleys and scarps, from Penselwood in the east to the Blackdown Hills, another {{designated}} Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty, in the west. This is a geologically complex area of clays, limestone and marl. The honey-coloured limestone at Ham Hill (also known as Hamdon Hill) is particularly important to geologists because of the assemblages of fossils which it contains, the sedimentary features which it displays and the way <b>it</b> <b>relates</b> <b>to</b> other rocks of equivalent age in the close vicinity. It has been quarried since Roman times at least.|$|E

5|$|Not {{only does}} SCI present {{children}} and adolescents {{with many of the}} same difficulties adults face, it affects the development of their sexuality. Although substantial research exists on SCI and sexuality in adults, very little exists on the ways in which it affects development of sexuality in young people. Injured {{children and adolescents}} need ongoing, age-appropriate sex education that addresses questions of SCI as <b>it</b> <b>relates</b> <b>to</b> sexuality and sexual function. Very young children become aware of their disabilities before their sexuality, but as they age they become curious just as able-bodied children do, and it is appropriate to provide them with increasing amounts of information. Caregivers help the child and family prepare for transition into adulthood, including in sexuality and social interaction, beginning early and intensifying during adolescence. Parents need education about the effects of SCI on sexual function so that they can answer their children's questions.|$|E
5|$|His {{most popular}} work {{was that of}} Tableau de l'état {{physique}} et moral des ouvriers employés dans les manufactures de coton, de laine et de soie (Study of the Physical Condition of Cotton, Wool and Silk workers), the final product of extended research and observation, published in the year 1840. The book outlined the physical and moral conditions of different labor forces. Villermé discussed his observations made concerning workers in the cotton, wool, and silk industries. He brought attention to the treacherous working conditions, unfit for adults {{as well as the}} danger for young children working alongside the adults, and critiqued the low wages provided to workers. There was a comparison throughout the entirety of the first section between the three occupations and different locations throughout France. The second portion of the book included the topic of health as <b>it</b> <b>relates</b> <b>to</b> dangerous workplaces and the effects of low pay and overcrowding. and he is considered a founder of epidemiology. Villermé covered a wide array of subject matter including: children in the workplace, savings accounts, asylum rooms, and drunkenness among the working class. The work was unique in combining health topics with research and social reforms.|$|E
