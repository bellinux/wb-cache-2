5|$|At one time, {{the church}} on this site {{was used as a}} chapel of ease to Llantrisant church. In the 15th century, St Mary's Church, Rhodogeidio, was built to serve as a chapel of ease <b>for</b> <b>St</b> Ceidio's. In 2006, one author noted that St Ceidio's had not been {{regularly}} used for some years, but restoration work had been carried out by local people. St Mary's, which is about 0.75miles (1.25km) to the west, is no longer used for services either, but is in ruins.|$|E
5|$|Between Bow Bridge and Channelsea Bridge {{there were}} three others, said in 1303 to have been built to fill the gaps caused by the cutting of mill streams through Maud's causeway, {{although}} {{there is evidence that}} the mills pre-dated the causeway. However, the mill owners took responsibility for the bridges, which crossed the mill streams <b>for</b> <b>St</b> Thomas's, Spileman's and Saynes mills. The last two were owned by the City of London, and the bridges were called Pegshole and St Michael's Bridges. An administrative mistake around 1814 resulted in the City of London taking responsibility <b>for</b> <b>St</b> Thomas's Bridge, but the miller did not complain as Pegshole bridge was smaller and therefore less costly to maintain. The names were eventually swapped, and all three were replaced by Groves Bridge in 1933, which crossed the widened Three Mills Wall River, the two branches of the Waterworks River having been combined into Three Mills Wall River, while Three Mills Wall Back River was filled in.|$|E

5|$|By mid-August 1942, Stanley had {{recovered}} {{enough to be}} moved to the dysentery wing at Block 151 of Roberts Barracks. Padres Chambers and Payne had heard that Stanley had decorated the prisoners' chapel at Bukit Batok.
