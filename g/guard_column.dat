Aside from direct injection of sample, sample cleanup involves miscible and immiscible organic solvent extractions, solid-phase extraction, and size separations. Column consider-ations are bonded phases, column dimensions, particle size, <b>guard</b> <b>columns,</b> stability, pH range, and reproducibility. In a section on mobile phase, the reversed-phase mode is dis-cussed along with temperature and degassing. Absorbance and fluorescence detectors are used most commonly. The parameters “capacity factor, ” “efficiency, ” and “asymmetry value ” are helpful for interpreting chromatograms, as are the aspects of peak tailing, peak quantitation, “complex solutes,” and “crowded chromatograms. ” Finally, automation, compet-ing methodology, and prospects are discussed.

The speciation was carried out on a mixed anion and cation exchange column of Dionex type XS 5 A. High sensitivity was achieved using a preconcentration of a 6 ml sample with two CG 5 A <b>guard</b> <b>columns</b> and a post-column reaction based on the catalytic oxidation of luminol and chemiluminescence detection. The detection limit of chromium(VI) described with the ionchromatographic system in Milli Q water is 20 ng/l (100 pmol/l). For chromium(III) the detection limit was 6 and 90 ng/l (200 and 600 pmol/l), respectively. The resolution between chromium(III) and chromium(VI) is excellent with R> 10. Application of the method was tested for drinking water, rain water, groundwater and surface water. The analysis time of the chromium components is less than 30 min.

They crossed the bridge, charged and dispersed the Crillon battalion commencing the action at about 7 p.m.. They then rushed {{up the road}} and overran the artillery park briefly capturing the guns. However, as the guns were unlimbered in park, not for action, the Royals were unable to use them against the French. The Duc de Laval and his battalion of the Crillon brigade then came up behind the pontoons and wagons engaging the Royal Scots soon {{to be followed by}} two more battalions led by Le Marquis de Crillon [...] The nature of the terrain was unfavorable to cavalry and the allied cavalry was unable to aid the Royals. During the ensuing musketry duel, Moltke decided to take the Hussars and Rich's Dragoons and some Hanoverian cavalry and make a dash for Ghent. A small detachment of Du Berry's cavalry held them up as some of the Normandie brigade arrived forcing Moltke off the causeway onto other tracks. A French battalion cut the road behind them. Now Moltke broke off with the entire force and headed for Ghent running a gauntlet of fire from the various French posts along the roads and ways and abandoning the rest of the column, losing about one half of this force, including nearly 400 of the Royal Scots.|$|E
