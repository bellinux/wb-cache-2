2500|$|The {{home front}} {{was subject to}} dynamic social changes {{throughout}} the war, though domestic issues were no longer Roosevelt's most urgent policy concern. The military buildup spurred economic growth. Unemployment fell in half from 7.7 million in spring 1940 to 3.4 million in fall 1941 and fell in half again to 1.5 million in fall 1942, out of a labor force of 54 million. There was a growing labor shortage, accelerating the second wave of the Great Migration of African Americans, farmers and rural populations to manufacturing centers. African Americans from the South went to California and other West Coast states for new jobs in the defense industry. To pay for increased government spending, in 1941 Roosevelt proposed that Congress enact an income tax rate of 99.5% on all income over $100,000; when the proposal failed, he issued an executive order imposing an income tax of 100% on income over $25,000, which Congress rescinded. The Revenue Act of 1942 instituted top tax rates as high as 94% (after accounting for the excess profits tax), greatly increased the tax base, and instituted the first <b>federal</b> <b>withholding</b> <b>tax.</b> In 1944, Roosevelt requested that Congress enact legislation which would tax all [...] "unreasonable" [...] profits, both corporate and individual, and thereby support his declared need for over $10 billion in revenue for the war and other government measures. Congress overrode Roosevelt's veto to pass a smaller revenue bill raising $2 billion.|$|E

In general, amounts paid or received under an NPC are treated as ordinary income (and not capital gain) for U.S. federal income tax purposes, and are sourced by the residence of the recipient (e.g., if a non-U.S. resident receives a payment under an NPC, that payment is, in general, treated as non-U.S. source income for U.S. federal income tax purposes).

Coverage If the cash wages an employer pays farm workers are subject to Social Security and Medicare taxes, they are also subject to <b>federal</b> income <b>tax</b> <b>withholding.</b> Farm employers must withhold Social Security and Medicare Tax from any farm employee paid cash wages of $ 150 or more in a year or from all employees if the wages paid to all employees total $ 2, 500 or more during the year. Farm employers may <b>withhold</b> income <b>tax</b> from any employee not meeting these guidelines. In general, farm employees are farm workers if they do any of the following farm work: 1) Raise or harvest agricultural or horticultural products on a farm, 2) Work in connection with the farm and its tools and equipment 3) Handle, process or package any agricultural or horticultural commodity if the employer produced more than half of the commodity. 4) Do housework in the taxpayers private home if it is on a farm operated for profit. An employee who performs both farm and non-farm work for an employer must be treated as a nonfarm employee. For example, if a farm employer also operates a fertilizer business or retail store, employees who work in both the farm and non-farm business are taxable under general employment rules. Farm work does not include re-selling activities such as a retail store or a greenhouse used primarily for display or storage. There is a 20 -factor test to use as a guide in determining whether a worker is an employee or independent contractor (see IRS Form SS- 8) ...|$|R

If the contract of sale of the license to use the script stipulates that the production company will pay the author 10,000 euro, the production company will not, in fact, pay the author 10,000 euro. Rather, the production company will pay the author some lesser amount (in 2006, 9215.5 euro) and will pay the AGESSA the remainder (in 2007, 784.5).
