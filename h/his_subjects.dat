5|$|The {{delegated}} form {{of governance}} {{in the existing}} or acquired provinces is recommended by the text, with the qualification that the province should be ruled by someone born there. However, all ministers in immediate vicinity of the king must be born in the long established state. The king, states the text, must watch out and act against bureaucrats and officials who torment <b>his</b> <b>subjects.</b> The text cautions that the king should prevent abuse of <b>his</b> <b>subjects</b> from officials, robbers, enemies, king's favorites and his own greed.|$|E

5|$|A {{king who}} fights in {{defending}} his empire, however, does {{not violate the}} vow of ahimsa, for his motive is to protect <b>his</b> <b>subjects.</b> The same {{is the case with}} the judge who punishes to maintain law and order.|$|E

5|$|Charles was universally beloved, beloved {{not only}} by the crowd of {{individuals}} with whom he came in contact, not only adored by his dependents, but thoroughly popular with the mass of <b>his</b> <b>subjects</b> and particularly with the poorer populace of London who knew him best.|$|E
5|$|Despite these {{frightening}} character traits, however, Edward's contemporaries {{considered him}} an able, even an ideal, king. Though not loved by <b>his</b> <b>subjects,</b> he was feared and respected. He met contemporary expectations of kingship {{in his role}} as an able, determined soldier and in his embodiment of shared chivalric ideals. In religious observance he also fulfilled the expectations of his age: he attended chapel regularly and gave alms generously.|$|E
5|$|Edward {{lived a life}} {{of luxury}} that was often far removed {{from that of the}} {{majority}} of <b>his</b> <b>subjects.</b> However, his personal charm with people at all levels of society and his strong condemnation of prejudice went some way to assuage republican and racial tensions building during his lifetime.|$|E

5|$|In December 1582, Gebhard Truchsess von Waldburg, the Prince-elector of Cologne, {{converted}} to Protestantism. The principle of ecclesiastical reservation required his resignation. Instead, he declared religious parity for <b>his</b> <b>subjects</b> and, in 1583, married Agnes von Mansfeld-Eisleben, intending {{to convert the}} ecclesiastical principality into a secular, dynastic duchy. A faction in the Cathedral Chapter elected another archbishop, Ernst of Bavaria.|$|E
5|$|In any event, the Lithuanians {{were not}} {{prepared}} to accept Christianity, and Mindaugas's baptism had little impact on further developments. The {{majority of the population}} and the nobility remained pagan; <b>his</b> <b>subjects</b> were not required to convert. The cathedral he had built in Vilnius was superseded by a pagan temple, and all the diplomatic achievements made after his coronation were lost, although the practice of Christianity and intermarriage were well tolerated.|$|E
5|$|Przemysł II didn't {{participate}} in this expedition (at least directly, according to Jan Długosz), because at that moment he was in Ląd, according to a document dated 24 August 1278.

5|$|The Count of Artois ruled as Lieutenant-General of {{the kingdom}} until his brother's arrival in Paris on 3 May. Upon his return, the king {{displayed}} himself to <b>his</b> <b>subjects</b> by creating a procession through the city. He took up residence in the Tuileries Palace the same day. His niece, the Duchess of Angoulême, fainted {{at the sight of}} the Tuileries, where she had lived during the time of the French Revolution.|$|E
5|$|The {{legend of}} Abhartach - an evil tyrant who {{repeatedly}} escapes his grave to spread terror (and in some accounts {{to drink the}} blood of <b>his</b> <b>subjects,</b> {{to be one of}} the neamh-mairbh (un-dead), and to be killed only by with a sword of yew wood and to be buried upside-down).|$|E
5|$|The {{paramount}} chief maintained some loyalty for <b>his</b> <b>subjects.</b> He {{persuaded the}} Germans {{to carry out}} infrastructure improvements such as the building of roads, schools, health clinics, and churches; and he defended <b>his</b> <b>subjects</b> from colonial reprisals. In one instance, an Ewondo interpreter fired a gun during a dispute with a German, an offence punishable with a stiff prison sentence. Atangana interceded, and the man's punishment was reduced to porter duty. However, the paramount chief remained completely loyal to the governors. In 1914, for example, representatives of Duala leader Rudolf Duala Manga Bell tried to secure Atangana's backing for a pan-Kamerun revolt. Atangana kept the plot under wraps, but he instructed the envoy to urge Manga Bell to reconsider.|$|E

5000|$|The poem dramatizes one of Stevens's major themes, the {{relationship}} between imagination and reality. [...] "Colloquy with a Polish Aunt," [...] though, is one of Stevens' many poems that resists the intelligence almost successfully. The scholar Helen Vendler writes of this poem that [...] "Some readers have seen <b>his</b> <b>subject</b> as an epistemological one, and have written about his views on the imagination and its uneasy rapport with reality. Others have seen <b>his</b> <b>subject</b> as a moral one, a justification of an aesthetic hedonism. Still others have seen <b>his</b> <b>subject</b> as a native humanist one, the quest of the American Adam for a Paradise in the wilderness." ...|$|R
5|$|Tvrtko {{is widely}} {{considered}} one of Bosnia's greatest medieval rulers, having enlarged the country's borders to their greatest extent, left a strong economy, and improved the living standards of <b>his</b> <b>subjects.</b> He was survived {{by at least one}} son, Tvrtko II, but was succeeded by Dabiša, under whom Tvrtko's burgeoning realm began to decay.|$|E
5|$|A weary emperor who {{no longer}} cared for the throne, an heir who {{had no desire to}} assume the crown, discontent among ruling circles who were dismissive of the Imperial role in {{national}} affairs: all seemed to presage the monarchy's impending doom. Nevertheless, Pedro II was unconcerned that times and conditions were changing. After more than five decades on the throne, he had become complacent in a belief that the devotion and support of <b>his</b> <b>subjects</b> was immutable. Because of these factors, and the lack of an energetic response on the part of Pedro II, {{it has been argued that}} prime responsibility for the monarchy's overthrow rested with the Emperor himself.|$|E
5|$|After Baldwin sanctioned the marriage, Constance and Raynald {{married in}} early 1153. Raynald {{took charge of}} the {{administration}} of the principality. However, he was unpopular because <b>his</b> <b>subjects</b> regarded him as an upstart. His frequent attempts to raise funds brought him into conflict with Patriarch Aimery and Emperor ManuelI during the subsequent years. The emperor forced Raynald to pay homage to him in the spring of 1159. Raynald was captured and imprisoned by Majd al-Din, governor of Aleppo, during a plundering raid in November 1160 or 1161.|$|E

5|$|After {{finding an}} empty {{treasure}} in Antioch, Raymond-Roupen increased taxation, {{which made him}} unpopular among <b>his</b> <b>subjects.</b> He also refused to assist Leo against the Seljuqs. In 1217, Raymond-Roupen tried to capture Leo, but the Templars assisted Leo to flee to Cilicia. Bohemond visited John, King of Jerusalem, in Acre in autumn 1217. John recognized Bohemond as the lawful prince of Antioch early the next year, but did not provide him with military assistance.|$|E
5|$|Alboin's {{problems}} in maintaining {{control over his}} people worsened during the siege of Ticinum. The nature of the Lombard monarchy {{made it difficult for}} a ruler to exert the same degree of authority over <b>his</b> <b>subjects</b> as had been exercised by Theodoric over his Goths, and the structure of the army gave great authority to the military commanders or duces, who led each band (fara) of warriors. Additionally, the difficulties encountered by Alboin in building a solid political entity resulted from a lack of imperial legitimacy, as unlike the Ostrogoths, they had not entered Italy as foederati but as enemies of the Empire.|$|E
5|$|Alexios's son John II Komnenos succeeded him in 1118, and was to rule until 1143. On {{account of}} his mild and just reign, he {{has been called the}} Byzantine Marcus Aurelius. John was unusual for his lack of cruelty—despite his long reign, he never had anyone killed or blinded. He was loved by <b>his</b> <b>subjects,</b> who gave him the name 'John the Good'. He was also an {{energetic}} campaigner, spending much of his life in army camps and personally supervising sieges.|$|E
