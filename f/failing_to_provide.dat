5|$|Darwin's aims were twofold: to {{show that}} species had not been {{separately}} created, and {{to show that}} natural selection had been the chief agent of change. He knew that his readers were already familiar {{with the concept of}} transmutation of species from Vestiges, and his introduction ridicules that work as <b>failing</b> <b>to</b> <b>provide</b> a viable mechanism. Therefore, the first four chapters lay out his case that selection in nature, caused by the struggle for existence, is analogous to the selection of variations under domestication, and that the accumulation of adaptive variations provides a scientifically testable mechanism for evolutionary speciation.|$|E

5|$|Derek Fisher succeeded Ewing as NBPA {{president}} in 2006. In early 2011, negotiations {{on a new}} CBA began. The league claimed that it was losing $300 million a year (22 out of 30 teams were losing money last season) and proposed to reduce 40% of players' salary (about $800 million) and institute a hard salary cap (at $45 million per team) {{as opposed to a}} soft cap (at $58 million) currently in use. The union disputed those figures and steadfastly opposed those changes. Hunter said that he was advising players to prepare for a lockout. In May 2011, the NBPA {{filed a complaint with the}} National Labor Relations Board (NLRB), accusing the league of negotiating in bad faith by <b>failing</b> <b>to</b> <b>provide</b> critical financial data to the union and repeatedly threatening to lock out players. The NBA quickly rejected the complaint, saying that the league complies fully with federal labor laws. The union also considered the option of decertification, which allows players to file an antitrust lawsuit against the NBA.|$|E
5|$|Since the 1980s, several parties, {{including}} the Center for Science in the Public Interest (CSPI), the British Heart Foundation, the City of New York, and the Spanish government, {{have argued that}} Burger King has contributed to obesity and unhealthy eating behaviors in Western nations by producing products that contain large amounts of salt, fat, trans-fat and calories. After its purchase by TPG Capital from former parent company Diageo in 2002, the company introduced several large, over-sized products including its European BK XXL line, the British Angus burger six-pack, the Enormous Omelet Sandwich line and the BK Stacker line. These new offerings, and others like them, have resulted in further international scorn and negative attention due the large portion size and increased amounts of unhealthy fats and trans-fats in these items. Many consumer groups have accused Burger King and other fast food restaurant chains of <b>failing</b> <b>to</b> <b>provide</b> healthier alternatives.|$|E

40|$|Past {{research}} suggests that for middle class Americans facing economic decline, the cultural repertoire available to them offers few tools with which they can {{make sense of their}} experience. Thus, when executives who have made cautious decisions in their career choices and sound investments in their personal security are laid off in the wake of unforeseen structural economic changes far beyond their control, they look <b>to</b> personal <b>failings</b> <b>to</b> <b>provide</b> explanation and meaning to their struggles. Through interviews with sixteen {{men and women who have}} faced significant long-term unemployment since the onset of the Great Recession, this research looks at whether and how this pattern has changed today. In the midst of this very public, wide reaching, and much discussed economic decline, what does downward mobility mean for Americans? Ultimately, it finds that while people facing long-term unemployment today see their problems in more structural terms than did their predecessors, they still overwhelmingly think about solutions in a highly individualistic framework...|$|R

5|$|Ultimately, the {{voluntary}} system of recruitment proved unable {{to sustain the}} force structure of the AIF, <b>failing</b> <b>to</b> <b>provide</b> sufficient replacements for the heavy casualties it sustained and requiring a number of units to be disbanded {{towards the end of}} the war. In mid-1918 it was decided to allow the men who had enlisted in 1914 to return to Australia for home leave, further exacerbating the manpower shortage experienced by the Australian Corps. Regardless, by the last year of the war the AIF was a long-serving force—even if it was a citizen army and not a professional one like the pre-war British Army—containing 141,557 men with more than two-years service, including, despite the heavy casualties suffered at Gallipoli in 1915 and on the Western Front in 1916 and 1917, 14,653 men who had enlisted in 1914. Battle hardened and experienced as a result, this fact partially explains the important role the AIF subsequently played in the final defeat of the German Army in 1918.|$|E
5|$|After rejoining the Emperor at Champaubert, Nansouty {{took part}} to the Battle of Montmirail, where he was at first {{instructed}} to protect the artillery. He then joined in the attack of the Guard infantry on the farm of Ėpine-au-Bois, where he suddenly wheeled left with his men and fell upon unprepared enemy infantry, charging home, routing these troops and subsequently pursuing the fugitives. This combined attack of the Guard resulted in {{a great number of}} prisoners and captured enemy guns, with Nansouty receiving a light wound in the process. A part of his men then took {{part to the}} Battle of Château-Thierry, where the Emperor ordered the Guard cavalry to make a turning move against the enemy left, and where Nansouty's subordinates General Letort and Colonel Curély brilliantly broke several enemy squares. Then, on 14 February, Nansouty personally led a brilliant charge at the Battle of Vauchamps, where he supported Grouchy in a cavalry action that decided the battle. Charging Blücher's men from the front, Nansouty allowed Grouchy to magnificently fall behind the enemy columns, which they both then sabred and crushed, with the Guard cavalry subsequently participating in a highly successful pursuit. Enemy losses reached a staggering 9,000-10,000 casualties, with 25 cannons lost. The Emperor was radiant following this battle, but, by nightfall, his mood changed when he found out of the loss of some Guard horse artillerymen. These men had been captured during their march and it was reported that their capture resulted from General Guyot (one of Nansouty's subordinates) <b>failing</b> <b>to</b> <b>provide</b> an escort and a guide for them. In Nansouty's presence, a fuming Napoleon summoned Guyot and then chastised him for the repeated losses in cannon during the previous battles, as well as for various other shortcomings, such as failing to properly escort the Emperor. After an angry tirade, Napoleon promptly axed Guyot and announced to Nansouty that General Exelmans would replace Guyot at the helm of his Old Guard heavy cavalry. This episode apparently strained relations between Emperor Napoleon and General Nansouty.|$|E

40|$|This action {{research}} thesis sought to develop recommendations {{for how to}} better connect young people to efforts that grassroots community-based organizations are taking to foster economic democracy and transform {{the political economy of}} society in Boston. Using a mixed methods approach of participant observations, interviews, and an academic literature review, this thesis explores the overlaps and bridges the gaps between trends and activities in the transformative community economic development, community organizing, and youth development fields. I first describe {{the current state of the}} community economic development field - its <b>failings</b> <b>to</b> <b>provide</b> real material improvements in the lives for low-income people of color in the U. S., particularly in its current iteration. I also posit reasons for this failing - the field's inability to confront and challenge the underlying system of global capital market distribution. I use the framework of transformative organizing and transformative community economic development, and transformative use of existing systems and resources to describe the ways Boston based organizations are taking on strategies that challenge capitalism in order to meet people's needs and change our political economy. Highlighting the presence of youth in these existing social transformation activities, I then offer a framework for further youth engagement and <b>provide</b> recommendations <b>to</b> The City School, the Boston Center for Community Ownership, and the Center for Economic Democracy, for how they could further nurture youth participation in social transformation strategies in Boston. by Nene Igietseme.

40|$|This article {{rejects the}} notion that schools have become {{excessively}} feminised spaces that are <b>failing</b> <b>to</b> adequately <b>provide</b> for {{the educational needs of}} boys. This construction of schools as feminised has provided the impetus for the development of what have become known as ‘boy‐friendly’ pedagogies. Unfortunately such pedagogies work with essentialist assumptions about masculinity and as such have the potential to reinscribe and valorise those forms of masculinity that are oppressive to others and, in some instances, result in self‐harm. The authors thus contend that boy‐friendly approaches to schooling often work against the interests of more gender‐just practices in schools, and beyond. Drawing on one set of data from a broader study, they highlight the masculinised spaces operating in one all‐boys’ school. They suggest that a boy‐friendly pedagogy here would be highly inappropriate in terms of promoting gender justice. They therefore foreground the philosophies and practices of one group of teachers who are concerned with implementing a transformational pedagogy in their classrooms and suggest that whilst, in this instance, such pedagogies are not without their problems, they offer insights into how such masculinised spaces can be disrupted...|$|R
