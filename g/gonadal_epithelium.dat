40|$|BACKGROUND: Mucinous cystic {{neoplasms}} with ovarian stroma (OS) {{are rare}} cystic neoplasms {{in the liver}} and pancreas. The aim was to investigate whether OS in mucinous cystadenomas can originate from <b>gonadal</b> <b>epithelium</b> during early embryonic development. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Pathology specimens of patients with mucinous cystadenomas were reviewed for OS. In human embryos, morphology of the peritoneal epithelium and {{the position of the}} gonads in relation to the embryonic liver, pancreas and spleen were examined. RESULTS: From 1994 to 2004, 22 female patients presented with mucinous neoplasms of the liver or pancreas, including 19 cystadenomas and 3 cystadenocarcinomas. Mean age of the patients with cystadenoma in the liver was 44. 8 years and with cystademona in the pancreas 41. 2 years. OS was present in all mucinous cystadenomas, including the cystadenocarcinomas. In human embryos, preceding their 'descent', the gonads are situated directly under the diaphragm, dorsal to the liver, the tail of the pancreas and the spleen, but separated from these organs by the peritoneal cavity. In contrast to the peritoneal epithelium elsewhere, the cells covering the gonads show an activated morphology. CONCLUSION: OS in mucinous cystadenomas of the liver and pancreas suggest a common origin in epithelial cells that cover the embryonic gonads in early fetal lif...|$|E
40|$|Gonad {{development}} and sex differentiation from embryos to 594 -day-old individuals were investigated in farmed Acipenser naccarii using light and transmission electron microscopy. The migrating primordial germ cells first appear along the dorsal {{wall of the}} body cavity in embryos 1. 5 days before hatching. The gonadal ridge, containing a few primary primordial germ cells (PGC- 1) surrounded by enveloping cells, appears in 16 -day-old larvae. At 60 days, the undifferentiated gonad is lamellar and PGC- 1 multiply, producing PGC- 2. In 105 -day-old juveniles, a distinct germinal area with advanced PGC- 2 appears on the lateral side near the mesogonium and the first blood vessels are visible. At 180 days, putative ovaries with a notched <b>gonadal</b> <b>epithelium</b> and putative testes with a smooth one appear, together with adipose tissue on the distal side. In 210 - day-old juveniles, active proliferation of germ cells begins in the putative ovaries, whereas putative testes still contain only a few germ cells. The onset of meiosis and reorganization of stromal tissue occurs in ovaries of 292 -day-old individuals. Ovaries with developed lamellae enclosing early oocyte clusters and follicles with perinucleolar oocytes occur at 594 days. Meiotic stages are never found, even in anastomozing tubular testes of 594 - day-old individuals. Steroid producing cells are detected in the undifferentiated gonad and in the differentiated ones of both sexes. Anatomical differentiation of the gonad precedes cytological differentiation and female differentiation largely precedes that of the male. Gonad {{development and}} differentiation are also associated with structural changes of connective tissue, viz. collagen-rich areas are massive in developing testes and reduced in ovaries...|$|E
40|$|International audienceInformation on the {{mechanisms}} orchestrating sexual differentiation of the bipotential gonads into testes or ovaries in amphibians is limited. The {{aim of this}} study was to investigate the development of Xenopus laevis gonad, to identify the earliest signs of sexual differentiation, and to describe mechanisms driving these processes. We used light and electron microscopy, immunofluorescence and cell tracing. In order to identify the earliest signs of sexual differentiation the sex of each tadpole was determined using genotyping with the sex markers. Our analysis revealed a series of events participating in the gonadal development, including cell proliferation, migration, cell adhesion, stroma penetration, and basal lamina formation. We found that during the period of sexual differentiation the sites of intensive cell proliferation and migration differ between male and female gonads. In the differentiating ovaries the germ cells remain associated with the <b>gonadal</b> surface <b>epithelium</b> (cortex) and a sterile medulla forms in the ovarian center, whereas in the differentiating testes the germ cells detach from the surface epithelium, disperse, and the cortex and medulla fuse. Cell junctions that are more abundant in the ovarian cortex possibly can favor the persistence of germ cells in the cortex. Also the stroma penetrates the female and male gonads differently. These finding indicate that the crosstalk between the stroma and the coelomic epithelium-derived cells is crucial for development of male and female gonad...|$|R
