30|$|To {{improve the}} {{low-temperature}} charge-discharge performance of lithium-ion battery, low- temperature experiments of the charge-discharge characteristics of 35 Ah high-power lithium-ion batteries have been conducted, and the wide-line metal film method for <b>heating</b> <b>batteries</b> is presented.

The results indicate the charge-discharge performance is substantially worse in cold climates, and can be significantly improved by heating the battery pack with a wide-line metal film. Pulse charge-discharge experiments show that at − 40  °C ambient temperature, the heated battery pack can charge or discharge at high current and offer almost 80 % power.|$|E

30|$|The result {{experiments}} reported above {{demonstrate that}} the low-temperature charge-discharge performance of the <b>battery</b> pack <b>heated</b> in low temperature is improved significantly, and can be draw by the above experiments on the low-temperature heating. The full energy storage capacity can be achieved. However, the maximum charge-discharge power of the <b>heated</b> <b>battery</b> pack <b>heated</b> at − 40  °C cannot be achieved because the <b>heated</b> <b>battery</b> pack is always charged or discharged at 1 C constant current.

Therefore, some experiments were performed using pulse charge-discharge of the <b>heated</b> <b>battery</b> pack at low temperature. Firstly, the battery pack was charged at 1 C/ 3 at room temperature. Secondly, the battery pack was placed at − 40  °C for eight hours to reach thermal equilibrium. Thirdly, the <b>battery</b> pack was <b>heated</b> for 15 min with 90 W power, and finally the battery pack was subjected to charge and discharge pulse currents. The pulses had the minimum discharge current of 17.5 A and maximum discharge current of 280 A and minimum charge current of 17.5 A and maximum charge current of 210 A. This pulse profile was designed to discharge the battery pack as quickly as possible.|$|R

The experimental design was a 2 X 2 factorial with treatments of 0 and 2. 5 jug of aflatoxin/g of feed (ppm) and 0 and 16 Mg of DON/g of feed. The broilers were maintained on these dietary treatments from hatching to 3 weeks {{of age in}} electrically <b>heated</b> <b>batteries</b> with feed and water available ad libitum.

30|$|The {{experiments}} reported above (as {{shown in}} Fig.  3) {{prove that the}} internal resistance of the battery is greatly increased and the charge-discharge performance is significantly reduced at low temperatures. The performance of an electric vehicle {{is limited by the}} low-temperature performance of its batteries, and this is especially for special-purpose electric vehicles that are required to operate under a great variety of temperature conditions. To meet the high reliability requirement of the 8 × 8 wheeled electric vehicle, a wide-line metal film heating method is proposed, in which two pieces of wide-line metal film are placed on the two largest surfaces of the battery cell. The wide-line metal film is printed on a FR 4 board or aluminum PCB, and its thickness is 1 mm. One side of the wide-line metal film is a complete rectangular copper film, and the other side is a certain width of continuous copper wire. The thickness of copper film and copper wire is 0.035 mm. The copper wire is heated by passing anelectric current through it. The heat is distributed evenly to the battery by the copper film on the other side. The structure of the heating device is simple, and it can be installed conveniently in order to <b>heat</b> <b>batteries</b> without changing the structure of the original battery pack.|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} the effect of turbine starting capability on overall energy-production capacity. The investigation was performed through the development and validation of matlab /Simulink models of turbines. A novel aspect of this paper is that the effects of load types, namely resistive <b>heating,</b> <b>battery</b> charging, and grid connection were also investigated. It was shown that major contributors to improved starting performance are aerodynamic improvements, reduction of inertia, and simply changing the pitch angle of the blades. The first two contributors can be attained from an exploitation of a “mixed-airfoil” blade. The results indicate that starting ability has a direct effect on the duration that the turbine can operate and consequently its overall energy output. The overall behavior of the wind turbine system depends on the load type, these impose different torque characteristics for the turbine to overcome and lead to different power production characteristics. When a “mixed-airfoil” blade is used the annual energy production of the wind systems increases with the exception of resistive heating loads. Net changes in annual energy production were range of − 4 % to 40 % depending on the load types and sites considered. The significant improvement in energy production strongly suggests that both the starting performance and load types should be considered together in the design process...|$|R
