5|$|Emir Sanjar al-Jawli {{acquired}} the governorship of <b>Gaza</b> <b>and</b> central Palestine in 1311. He highly favored <b>Gaza</b> <b>and</b> transformed {{it into a}} flourishing city, having built in it a horse-race course, a madrasa (college), a mosque, a khan (caravansary), a maristan (hospital), and a castle. In late 1332, coinciding with the appointment of Emir Taynal al-Ashrafi as governor, some of the provincial privileges of Gaza, such as the governor's direct subordination to the sultan in Cairo, were removed by an-Nasir Muhammad's decree. From then, and until 1341 when Sanjar al-Jawli served a second term as governor, Gaza became subordinate to the na'ib as-saltana (viceroy) of Syria, Emir Tankiz al-Husami.|$|E

5|$|Just {{before the}} capture of Jerusalem, the British War Office had been very worried about Allenby's {{extended}} advance and warned of a possible retirement back to <b>Gaza</b> <b>and</b> Beersheba if the war on the Western Front dictated the transfer {{of large numbers of}} troops from the Levant.

5|$|After Ahmad Pasha was reassigned as beylerbey of Damascus in 1601, his son Hasan 'Arap Pasha {{inherited}} Gaza's governorship, {{occupying the}} office for 43 years. His rule impoverished <b>Gaza</b> <b>and</b> bankrupted the dynasty. Hasan Pasha's son and successor Husayn Pasha was appointed the office in 1644 and he served until 1672. Under Husayn Pasha's leadership, Gaza became a prosperous, secure and religiously diverse city. He was deposed and executed by the Ottoman authorities in 1663, after which his brother Musa Pasha {{was appointed to the}} post, serving the office until 1679. The last Ridwan governor of Gaza was Musa Pasha's son Ahmad Pasha whose governorship ended in 1690.|$|E

5|$|In 1293, Qalawun's son an-Nasir Muhammad instituted Gaza as {{the capital}} of the {{province}} that bore its name, Mamlakat Ghazzah (the Governorship of Gaza). This province covered the coastal plain from Rafah in the south to just north of Caesarea, extending in the east to the western slopes of Samaria and the Hebron Hills; its major towns were Qaqun, Ludd, and Ramla. In 1294, an earthquake devastated <b>Gaza,</b> <b>and</b> five years later the Mongols again destroyed all that was restored by the Mamluks. That same year, Gaza was the center of a conspiracy against Sultan al-Adil Kitbugha, but the plot was detected and crushed before being carried out.|$|E

From Egypt, and particularly from Cairo and Damietta, Nablus merchants imported mainly rice, sugar, and spices, {{as well as}} linen, cotton, and wool textiles.

Josiah C.
