25|$|In common {{integrated}} circuits, a wafer of monocrystalline silicon {{serves as}} a mechanical support for the circuits, which are created by doping and insulated from each other by thin layers of silicon oxide, an insulator that is easily produced by exposing the element to oxygen under the proper conditions. Silicon {{has become the most}} popular material for both high power semiconductors and integrated circuits because it can withstand the highest temperatures and greatest electrical activity without suffering avalanche breakdown (an <b>electron</b> <b>avalanche</b> is created when heat produces free electrons and holes, which in turn pass more current, which produces more heat). In addition, the insulating oxide of silicon is not soluble in water, which gives it an advantage over germanium (an element with similar properties which can also be used in semiconductor devices) in certain fabrication techniques.|$|E

40|$|Based on the {{observation}} of time-resolved avalanche current waveforms in electronegative gases, three different types of avalanches can be distinguished. The first distinction is that between <b>electron</b> <b>avalanches</b> and ion-dominated <b>avalanches.</b> <b>Electron</b> <b>avalanches</b> are further subdivided into <b>electron</b> <b>avalanches</b> with and without delayed electrons. Delayed electrons {{are the result of}} consecutive attachment and detachment processes. Experimental identification of the different avalanche types requires an experimental set-up with a time-resolution in the order of 1 ns. The conventional avalanche model, which involves effective ionization and drift, gives an adequate description only for <b>electron</b> <b>avalanches</b> without delayed <b>electrons.</b> An extended model, which also incorporates electron detachment and ion conversion processes, in principle describes all three kinds of avalanches. When the extended model is applied to the evaluation of measured waveforms, the often-quoted abnormal pressure dependencies in the electron drift velocity and the effective ionization coefficient disappear for the gases studied in this paper...|$|R
5000|$|<b>Electron</b> <b>avalanches</b> are {{essential}} to the dielectric breakdown process within gases. The process can culminate in corona discharges, [...] streamers, leaders, or in a spark or continuous arc that completely bridges the gap between the electrical conductors that are applying the voltage. The process extends to huge sparks — streamers in lightning discharges propagate by formation of <b>electron</b> <b>avalanches</b> created in the high potential gradient ahead of the streamers' advancing tips. Once begun, avalanches are often intensified by the creation of photoelectrons as a result of ultraviolet radiation emitted by the excited medium's atoms in the aft-tip region.|$|R
50|$|Negative coronas {{are more}} complex than {{positive}} coronas in construction. As with positive coronas, the establishing of a corona begins with an exogenous ionization event generating a primary electron, followed by an <b>electron</b> <b>avalanche.</b>|$|E
50|$|At higher pressures, {{discharges}} occur {{more rapidly}} than the calculated time for ions to traverse the gap between electrodes, and the streamer theory of spark discharge of Raether, Meek and Loeb is applicable. In highly non-uniform electric fields, the corona discharge process is applicable. See <b>Electron</b> <b>avalanche</b> for further description of these mechanisms.|$|E
50|$|As with a {{negative}} corona, a positive corona is initiated by an exogenous ionisation event in a region of high potential gradient. The electrons resulting from the ionisation are attracted toward the curved electrode, and the positive ions repelled from it. By undergoing inelastic collisions {{closer and closer to}} the curved electrode, further molecules are ionized in an <b>electron</b> <b>avalanche.</b>|$|E
50|$|<b>Electron</b> <b>avalanches</b> are {{essential}} to the dielectric breakdown process within gases. The process can culminate in corona discharges, streamers, leaders, or in a spark or continuous electric arc that completely bridges the gap. The process may extends to huge sparks — streamers in lightning discharges propagate by formation of <b>electron</b> <b>avalanches</b> created in the high potential gradient ahead of the streamers' advancing tips. Once begun, avalanches are often intensified by the creation of photoelectrons as a result of ultraviolet radiation emitted by the excited medium's atoms in the aft-tip region. The extremely high temperature of the resulting plasma cracks the surrounding gas molecules and the free ions recombine to create new chemical compounds.|$|R
5000|$|The glow of {{the corona}} is caused by {{electrons}} recombining with positive ions to form neutral atoms. When the electron falls back to its original energy level, it releases a photon of light. The photons serve to ionize other atoms, maintaining the creation of <b>electron</b> <b>avalanches.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The above radial {{distribution}} is valid {{also in the}} presence of formation of <b>electron</b> <b>avalanches</b> at high electric field, but it must be multiplied by an appropriate gain factor. In its simplest form for parallel electrodes, the gain factor is the exponential in the current equation: ...|$|R
50|$|As {{a further}} {{characteristic}} of the GDD, a gaseous scintillation avalanche also accompanies the <b>electron</b> <b>avalanche</b> and, by detection of the light produced with a photo-multiplier, corresponding SE images can be routinely made. The frequency response of this mode has allowed the use of true TV scanning rates. This mode of the detector has been employed by a latest generation of commercial instruments.|$|E
50|$|Electrons can be {{detected}} using an electron multiplier, usually a channeltron. This device essentially consists of a glass tub with a resistive coating on the inside. A high voltage is applied between the front and the end. An electron which enters the channeltron is accelerated to the wall, where it removes more electrons, {{in such a way}} that an <b>electron</b> <b>avalanche</b> is created, until a measurable current pulse is obtained.|$|E
5000|$|A {{relativistic}} runaway <b>electron</b> <b>avalanche</b> (RREA) is {{an avalanche}} {{growth of a}} population of relativistic electrons driven through a material (typically air) by an electric field. RREA has been hypothesized {{to be related to}} lightning initiation, terrestrial gamma-ray flashes, sprite lightning, and to spark development. [...] RREA is unique as it can occur at electric fields an order of magnitude lower than the dielectric strength of the material.|$|E
50|$|A {{streamer}} discharge, {{also known}} as filamentary discharge, {{is a type of}} transient electrical discharge. Streamer discharges can form when an insulating medium (for example air) is exposed to a large potential difference. When the electric field created by the applied voltage is sufficiently large, accelerated electrons strike air molecules with enough energy to knock other electrons off them, ionizing them, and the freed electrons go on to strike more molecules in a chain reaction. These <b>electron</b> <b>avalanches</b> (Townsend discharges) create ionized, electrically conductive regions in the air near the electrode creating the electric field. The space charge created by the <b>electron</b> <b>avalanches</b> gives rise to an additional electric field.This field can enhance the growth of new avalanches in a particular direction.Then the ionized region grows quickly in that direction, forming a finger-like discharge called a streamer.|$|R
50|$|The difference, then, between {{positive}} and negative coronas, {{in the matter of}} the generation of secondary <b>electron</b> <b>avalanches,</b> is that in a positive corona they are generated by the gas surrounding the plasma region, the new secondary electrons travelling inward, whereas in a negative corona they are generated by the curved electrode itself, the new secondary electrons travelling outward.|$|R
40|$|We {{have studied}} the severe {{systematic}} deviations of populations of <b>electron</b> <b>avalanches</b> from the Furry distribution, which has been held to be the statistical law corresponding to them, and a possible explanation has been sought. A  new theoretical concept based on fractal avalanche multiplication has been proposed and is {{shown to be a}} convenient candidate for explaining these deviations from Furry statistics. ...|$|R
50|$|When the {{electric}} field approaches the breakdown field, the electrons gain enough energy between collisions to ionize the gas atoms, knocking an electron off the atom. At the breakdown field, {{there is a}} balance between the production of new electrons (due to impact ionization) and the loss of electrons (due to attachment).Above the breakdown field, the number of electrons starts to grow exponentially, and an <b>electron</b> <b>avalanche</b> (Townsend avalanche) forms.|$|E
50|$|Avalanche {{breakdown}} is {{a phenomenon}} that can occur in both insulating and semiconducting materials. It {{is a form of}} electric current multiplication that can allow very large currents within materials which are otherwise good insulators. It is a type of <b>electron</b> <b>avalanche.</b> The avalanche process occurs when carriers in the transition region are accelerated by the electric field to energies sufficient to create mobile or free electron-hole pairs via collisions with bound electrons.|$|E
50|$|An <b>electron</b> <b>avalanche</b> is {{a process}} in which a number of free {{electrons}} in a transmission medium are subjected to strong acceleration by an electric field and subsequently collide with other atoms of the medium, thereby ionizing them (impact ionization). This releases additional electrons which accelerate and collide with further atoms, releasing more electrons - a chain reaction. In a gas, this causes the affected region to become an electrically conductive plasma.|$|E
40|$|Fluctuations of {{the charge}} {{amplification}} factor (gain) are a key element for assessing the performance of gas-based particle detectors In this report we present Monte Carlo calculations of <b>electron</b> <b>avalanches</b> based on the Magboltz program In terms of a simple model extracted from the simulation an intuitive explanation {{for the impact of}} the gas mixture and the electric field on the gain spectrum is proposed...|$|R
5000|$|The {{components}} of the gas fill mixture are an inert gas such as helium, argon or neon which is ionised by incident radiation, and a [...] "quench" [...] gas of 5-10% of an organic vapor or a halogen gas to prevent spurious pulsing by quenching the <b>electron</b> <b>avalanches.</b> This combination of gases {{is known as a}} Penning mixture and makes use of the Penning ionization effect.|$|R
40|$|Different {{types of}} non-thermal plasmas can be {{generated}} by the so-called streamer discharge. They all belong to a class of discharges presenting filamentary structures. The term “streamer ” refers to the very tiny ionization wave, based on <b>electron</b> <b>avalanches</b> sustained by a high, and confined, space-charge field. The wave propagates rapidly, at some 107 cm/s, and leaves, behind it, a filamentary plasma. At this stage, the produced filamentary plasma is in...|$|R
50|$|Early {{hypotheses}} of this {{pointed to}} lightning generating high electric fields and driving relativistic runaway <b>electron</b> <b>avalanche</b> at altitudes {{well above the}} cloud where the thin atmosphere allows gamma rays to easily escape into space, {{similar to the way}} sprites are generated. Subsequent evidence however, has suggested instead that TGFs may be produced by driving relativistic electron avalanches within or just above high thunderclouds. Though hindered by atmospheric absorption of the escaping gamma rays, these theories do not require the exceptionally intense lightning that high altitude theories of TGF generation rely on.|$|E
50|$|I: Townsend discharge, {{below the}} {{breakdown}} voltage. At low voltages, the only current is {{that due to}} the generation of charge carriers in the gas by cosmic rays or other sources of ionizing radiation. As the applied voltage is increased, the free electrons carrying the current gain enough energy to cause further ionization, causing an <b>electron</b> <b>avalanche.</b> In this regime, the current increases from femtoamperes to microamperes, i.e. by nine orders of magnitude, for very little further increase in voltage. The voltage-current characteristics begins tapering off near the breakdown voltage and the glow becomes visible.|$|E
50|$|When an {{electric}} field is generated between electrodes, atoms are ionized and release electrons. The electrons {{in the gas}} are accelerated by the RF field and can ionize the gas directly or indirectly by collisions, producing secondary electrons. When the electric field is strong enough, {{it can lead to}} what is known as <b>electron</b> <b>avalanche.</b> After avalanche breakdown, the gas becomes electrically conductive due to abundant free electrons. Often it accompanies light emission from excited atoms or molecules in the gas. When visible light is produced, plasma generation can be indirectly observed even with bare eyes.|$|E
40|$|In {{experiments}} positive streamers {{can have}} a feather-like structure, with small hairs connected to the main streamer channel. These feathers were observed in pure nitrogen (with impurities of 1 ppm oxygen or less) but not in air. We hypothesize that these hairs are individual <b>electron</b> <b>avalanches</b> moving towards the streamer channel. Based on results of numerical simulations, we provide a theoretical explanation why these hairs are visible in nitrogen, but not in air...|$|R

The properties of <b>electron</b> <b>avalanches</b> in hydrogen were studied using a same MCS technique at ratios of the electric field intensity to the gas number densit E/N of from about 3 to 3000 Td...|$|R
50|$|Thermodynamically, a corona {{is a very}} nonequilibrium process, {{creating}} a non-thermal plasma. The avalanche mechanism does not release enough energy to heat the gas in the corona region generally and ionize it, as occurs in an electric arc or spark. Only {{a small number of}} gas molecules take part in the <b>electron</b> <b>avalanches</b> and are ionized, having energies close to the ionization energy of 1 - 3 ev, the rest of the surrounding gas is close to ambient temperature.|$|R
5000|$|Note Self-focusing needs a laser {{peak power}} {{higher than the}} {{critical}} power [...] (order of gigawatts in air), however, for infrared (IR) nanosecond pulses with peak powers higher than the critical power self-focusing is not possible. Multiphoton ionization, inverse Bremsstrahlung and <b>electron</b> <b>avalanche</b> ionization are three major results of gas and laser interaction. The later two processes are collisional-type interactions and take time to accomplish (picosecond to nanosecond). A nanosecond pulse is long enough to develop the air breakdown before the power reaches the GW order required for self-focusing. Breakdown of gas produces plasma that has absorbing and reflecting effect so self-focusing is prohibited.|$|E
50|$|An <b>electron</b> <b>avalanche</b> happens {{between two}} {{unconnected}} electrodes in a gas when an electric field exceeds a certain threshold. Random thermal collisions of gas atoms {{may result in}} a few free electrons and positively charged gas ions, in a process called impact ionization. Acceleration of these free electrons in a strong electric field causes them to gain energy, and when they impact other atoms, the energy causes release of new free electrons and ions (ionization), which fuels the same process. If this process happens faster than it is naturally quenched by ions recombining, the new ions multiply in successive cycles until the gas breaks down into a plasma and current flows freely in a discharge.|$|E
5000|$|Electrons in air have a mean {{free path}} of ~1 cm. Fast {{electrons}} which move at a large fraction {{of the speed of}} light have a {{mean free path}} up to 100 times longer. Given the long free paths, an electric field can accelerate these electrons to energies far higher than that of initially static electrons. If they strike air molecules, more relativistic electrons will be released, creating an avalanche multiplication of [...] "runaway" [...] electrons. This process, relativistic runaway <b>electron</b> <b>avalanche,</b> has been hypothesized to lead to electrical breakdown in thunderstorms, but only when a source of high-energy electrons from a cosmic ray is present to start the [...] "runaway" [...] process.|$|E
