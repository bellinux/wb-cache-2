40|$|The dynamic {{properties}} of engine mount influence {{the performance of}} the engine mounting system. The frequency-dependent properties represented the more accurate properties of the engine mount as opposed to the frequency-independent properties model. Impact technique in the past has been used to measure the <b>dynamic</b> driving point <b>stiffness</b> in the axial position which omitted the shear properties. In this research, the impact technique is extended to measure the global {{dynamic properties}} including the <b>dynamic</b> shear <b>stiffness</b> of the engine mount [...] When the engine mount is oriented in certain angles, the combination effect of <b>dynamic</b> compression <b>stiffness</b> and <b>dynamic</b> shear <b>stiffness</b> altered the global dynamic properties of the engine mount. A transformation technique is developed to include both of the <b>dynamic</b> <b>stiffnesses</b> and used them to determine the global dynamic properties of engine mount. Three different types of engine mounts are used to validate the application of the developed technique. Finally, optimization was carried out to demonstrate the effect of the global dynamic properties based on the frequency-dependent properties of engine mount. The optimum locations and orientation angles of each individual mount are identified to minimize the mean force transmissibility of the engine mounting system. The reduction of the force transmissibility showed that optimization based on the frequency-independent properties underestimated the peak transmissibility...|$|R

A similar work performed on the same bearing at lower loads ranging from 0 - 1 MPa (0 - 150 psi) by Al-Ghasem was tested, whereas the current work investigates effects in the load range between 1 - 2. 2 MPa (150 - 320 psi). The bearing design parameters include: 4 pads with pad arc angle 72 ???? and 50 % pivot offset, pad axial length 0. 0762 m (3 in), pad radial clearance 0. 254 mm (0. 010 in), bearing radial clearance 190. 5 ????m (0. 0075 in), preload 0. 25, and shaft nominal diameter of 0. 11684 m (4. 600 in). An important {{distinction between the two}} sets of tests is the difference in experimental bearing radial clearance, which for this case measured 208 ????m (0. 00082 in), and for Al-Ghasem??????s was 165. 1 ????m (0. 0065 in). The rotordynamic coefficients are determined experimentally using a test rig equipped with motion and load sensors.

Only in the load range of 1 to 2. 2 MPa were the unloaded direct mass coefficients near or at 0, which would allow for a [K][C] model to be used. The remaining real components are better represented with the mass term.

40|$|International audienceIn many {{mechanical}} engineering applications, {{the interactions of}} a structure through its boundary is modelled by a <b>dynamic</b> boundary <b>stiffness</b> matrix. Nevertheless, {{it is well known}} that the solution of such computational model is very sensitive to the modelling uncertainties on the <b>dynamic</b> boundary <b>stiffness</b> matrix. In a recent work, the "hidden state variables method" is used to identify mass, stiffness and damping matrices associated with a given deterministic <b>dynamic</b> boundary <b>stiffness</b> matrix which can be constructed by using experimental measurements. Such an identification allows the construction of the probabilistic model of a random boundary stiffness matrix by substituting those identified mass, stiffness and damping matrices by random matrices. Nevertheless, the numerical cost of the "hidden state variables method" increases drastically with the dimension (number of degrees of freedom) of the interface. We then propose an enhanced approach which consists in a truncated spectral representation of the displacements on the boundary and with a partition of the frequency band of analysis. A collection of mass, stiffness and damping matrices is then identified for each sub-frequency band of analysis. A probabilis-tic model is constructed in substituting each of those matrices by random matrices. A numerical application is proposed...|$|R

METHODS: Twenty-four patients (mean age 61. 7 years) who underwent unilateral (n= 12) or bilateral total hip arthroplasty (n= 12) and healthy subjects (n= 12) were recruited. In addition to kinematic and kinetic variables, <b>dynamic</b> hip joint <b>stiffness</b> which was calculated as an angular coefficient of linear regression of the plot of the hip flexion moment vs. hip extension angle during the late stance of gait, was measured. Group differences were compared using one-way ANOVA and Tukey's post-hoc test, and relationships between primary hip impairments and secondary gait impairments were found using partial correlation coefficients adjusted for gait speed and stride length. FINDINGS: <b>Dynamic</b> hip joint <b>stiffness</b> was 47 % higher on the side with the more pronounced limp in patients with bilateral arthroplasty than in healthy controls. In the same patients, increased <b>dynamic</b> hip joint <b>stiffness</b> was significantly associated especially with increased ankle plantarflexion moment on the ipsilateral side. In patients with unilateral arthroplasty, decreased hip power was significantly related to increased ankle plantarflexor power, only on the non-operated side.

40|$|Problem statement: Resonance-type microscopies {{have been}} widely used to {{evaluate}} the nanoscaled or microscaled surface elastic properties of materials by the resonance-frequency shifts of an oscillator, which contacts the surface of materials by a spherical tip. Approach: The tip-specimen contact is modeled to be a spring support, whose stiffness is given by the traditional Hertzian contact theory. However, because of the influence of the oscillator vibration and the anisotropy in nanoscaled or microscaled region of materials, the predicted results from the traditional Hertzian contact theory can not coincide with the experimental observations. In order to explain this discrepancy, <b>dynamic</b> contact <b>stiffness</b> at the contact interface between a rigid sphere and a semi-infinite cubic solid is investigated. Results: An oscillating force being superposed on a biasing force excites the oscillation of the sphere contacting with the solid surface, which causes the contact radius to vary with the oscillation. The assumption of sufficiently small oscillating force compared with the biasing force yields an oscillating-contact-pressure distribution of the constant contact radius and then <b>dynamic</b> contact <b>stiffness.</b> Because the oscillating-contact-pressure distribution cannot promise the uniform contact deformation, the influence of contact-displacement conditions is discussed.

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} the dynamic and static forced {{performance of a}} flexure-pivot tilting-pad bearing load between pad (LBP) configuration for different rotor speeds and bearing unit loadings. The bearing has the following design parameters: 4 pads with pad arc angle 72 o and 50 % pivot offset, pad axial length 0. 0762 m (3 in), pad radial clearance 0. 254 mm (0. 010 in), bearing radial clearance 0. 1905 mm (0. 0075 in), preload 0. 25 and shaft nominal diameter of 0. 11684 m (4. 600 in). The dynamic coefficients and the static performance parameters of the FPB have been compared with the theoretical predictions using the isothermal analysis from the rotordynamic software suite XLTRC 2 -XLTFPBrg. The bearing shows a small attitude angle, about 10 o, which indicates small crosscoupling stiffnesses. The pad temperatures increase in the circumferential direction of rotation with speed and load. The pads maximum temperature was measured near the trailing edge. The dependency of the stiffness and damping coefficients on the excitation frequency has been studied. The frequency dependency in the dynamic coefficients was removed by introducing an added mass coefficient to the bearing model. The direct added mass coefficients were around 32 kg. The direct stiffness and damping coefficients increase with load, while increasing and decreasing with rotor speed, respectively. A small whirl frequency ratio (WFR) was found of about 0. 15, and it decreases with load and increases with speed. A comparison between the <b>dynamic</b> <b>stiffnesses</b> using a Reynolds equation and the bulk-flow Navier-Stokes models with the experimental <b>dynamic</b> <b>stiffnesses</b> shows that the Reynolds model (even for laminar flows) is not adequate, and that the bulk-flow model {{should be used for}} rotordynamic coefficients prediction.

40|$|Objective. To {{compare the}} joint torque pattern and <b>dynamic</b> joint <b>stiffness</b> {{at the knee}} and ankle in elderly and young men during {{stepping}} down. Background. Adequate joint stiffness is critical during the single support phase to control forward and downward body momentum. Design. Six active elderly men (mean 67. 7) and six young men (mean 23. 6) of similar body mass and height, were filmed stepping down from one force platform to another. Repeated trials were undertaken at three different step heights (200, 250, and 300 mm). Method. Joint torques were determined for the ankle and knee of the support limb throughout the single support phase. The gradient of the joint torque-angle graph was calculated to define <b>dynamic</b> joint <b>stiffness</b> of the ankle and knee in two phases; (I) from initiation of movement until heel-off of the supporting limb, and (II) from heel-off of the supporting limb to contra-limb touch down. Results. Maximum ankle torque values were lower in the elderly and occurred at a larger dorsiflexion angle (P< 0. 05). Knee torque patterns were similar in both groups. Phase I ankle stiffness was significantly less in the elderly (4. 0 - 5. 2 Nm/°) at all step heights compared to the young (7. 6 - 8. 7 Nm/°). In both groups ankle stiffness in Phase II increased with step height, while knee joint stiffness decreased. Conclusions. The different torque pattern and lower <b>dynamic</b> ankle <b>stiffness</b> in the elderly, particularly for Phase I, suggested an altered control strategy. These findings highlight the importance of <b>dynamic</b> ankle joint <b>stiffness</b> in stepping down. © 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R

The <b>dynamic</b> transfer <b>stiffness</b> is expressed {{as a function of}} frequency and provides insight in the generation of vehicle interior structure-borne tire/road noise. The road surface texture excites the tire at the contact patch, resulting in structural waves travelling around the circumference of the tire. The tire sidewalls transfer these vibrations to the rim. The vibrational energy is then transmitted through the spindle-wheel interface toward the suspension and vehicle body. The resulting body panel and window vibrations cause noise radiation in the passenger compartment. It is known that the tire dynamic properties are dependent on the vibration amplitude. Therefore, the excitation levels during tire dynamic characterization tests should be similar as the excitation levels during operation of the tire. This is not possible with the classic excitation devices such as hammer and electrodynamic shakers. This paper presents an experimental method to obtain the <b>dynamic</b> transfer <b>stiffness</b> of a non-rolling tire which is excited at operational excitation levels.
