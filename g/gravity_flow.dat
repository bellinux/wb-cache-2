40|$|Rugged {{bathymetry}} along slow-spreading mid-ocean ridges has {{the potential}} to impinge a strong control on <b>gravity</b> <b>flows</b> derived from oceanic fault scarps. Sedimentary lithofacies from the Macquarie Island ophiolite supports this hypothesis by displaying systematic variations that correspond with volcanic substrate differences and proximity to rift-related faults. Pillow-basalt terranes are associated with tightly confined bedrock corridors that funnel <b>gravity</b> <b>flows</b> into one direction. Vertical lithofacies variations formed from high-density to low-density turbidity currents record successive fill stages of the corridor axis. During initial stages tight confinement in the axis suppressed flow dilution and fluid turbulence. With continued corridor-axis filling, more dilute <b>gravity</b> <b>flows</b> predominated and formed lateral gradations from axial coarse-grained turbidites into thinly interbedded overbank lithofacies along corridor margins. These gravity-flow lithofacies converge into very thin muddy condensed intervals along inter-corridor highs where significant bottom-current reworking occurred. Conversely, partly confined tabular-basalt-floored basins promoted lateral expansion and dilution of <b>gravity</b> <b>flows</b> throughout the duration of basin filling. Variable paleocurrent-indicator directions record multiple reflections of single gravity-flow events off basin-bounding fault barriers. Coarsening-upward trends in these partly confined basins from thinly interbedded pelagic chert and ripple-bedded sandstones up into stacked turbidites preserves the ponding of sediment-starved submarine fans. In general, these ponded basins preserve the fine-grained distal ends of a gravity-flow continuum from coarse-grained fault-proximal en masse failures and cohesionless debris flows into medial high-density turbidity flows and distal dilute turbidity flows. 21 page(s...|$|R

Reduced water depth can lead to increased glacier stability through decreased rates of iceberg calving, glacier thinning and submarine melting. Here we investigate sedimentation processes at the termini of Kronebreen and Kongsvegen, Svalbard. We mapped the fjord floor bathymetry in August 2009 and calculate sedimentation rates based on our bathymetry and that from a similar study in 2005. A grounding-line fan is developing near the current position of the subglacial stream. An older, abandoned grounding-line fan that likely formed between 1987 and 2001 is degrading near {{the middle of the}} ice front. Our findings indicate that sediment <b>gravity</b> <b>flows</b> reduce the height of the sediment mound forming at the glacier terminus.

40|$|This study {{focuses on}} the interplay between {{large-scale}} relay ramps and sedimentladen flows, specifically low-density turbidity currents that form one end-member of subaqueous sediment <b>gravity</b> <b>flows.</b> The main objective is {{to better understand the}} impact of syn-rift faulting on subaqueous sediment routes and to develop predictive depositional models at rifting margins. Much of the knowledge on sediment dispersal across fault zones comes from the continental realm, but in subaqueous settings only {{little is known about the}} effect of tectonic activity on the pathways of <b>gravity</b> <b>flows.</b> Footwall drainage in active rift settings is generally directed away from the basin, but a minority of sedimentary flows enters the basin across the border fault system. Relay ramps between en-echelon faults may thereby act as local entry points and sediment pathways for subaerial flows, providing access to large catchment areas and influencing sediment distribution. Their impact on sedimentladen subaqueous <b>gravity</b> <b>flows,</b> however, is barely studied. Understanding the effects of syn-sedimentary faulting on sediment dispersal is of paramount importance to better locate potential reservoir sands in rift sequences – the precursors of slope- and basin-floor fans in fully developed passive continental margins that are a major exploration target in many areas. In order to achieve the aim of this thesis a novel approach is developed, combining laboratory analogue experiments with numerical flow simulations. The results of this conceptual experimental study are compared to subsurface Palaeocene syn-rift data in the Vøring Basin offshore Norway, a frontier area in the exploration of turbidite systems, as well as with various field examples.
