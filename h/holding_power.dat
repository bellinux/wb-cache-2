25|$|After {{analyzing}} {{hundreds of}} designs, and finally {{coming up with}} what {{was believed to be}} the best design, Bostich finally released the nail in 2005 and labeled it the Sheather Plus. Even though the new nail was stronger than most nails, the barbs, which added the much needed strength to the nail's <b>holding</b> <b>power,</b> weakened the strength of the joint by opening the hole too far. This caused the joint to be sloppy and wobbly, so the team went {{back to the drawing board}} where the final feature was added to the nail. To compensate for the extra width of the nail hole, due to the ring shanks, Sutt decided to add a thicker screw-shank to the portion of the nail directly under the head. This addition thickened the top portion of the nail giving it a tighter joint, as well as enhancing its overall <b>holding</b> <b>power.</b>|$|E

In November, a federal judge ordered Fiumara back to prison for eight months for concealing Coppola’s whereabouts.|$|E
