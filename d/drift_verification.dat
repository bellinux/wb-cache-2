40|$|ABSTRACT. Detailed {{bathymetry}} of Lake Ontario {{reveals a}} small circular feature and adjoining SW-trending ridge {{associated with a}} small topographic high identified as Charity Shoal on nautical charts. The feature consists of a circular basin 1, 000 m in diameter and 19 + m deep, completely surrounded by a low-relief rim that rises to within 5 m of the water surface over much of its extent. A N 53 E tapering ridge is contiguous with the feature and extends southwestward. Bedrock consists of middle Ordovician lime-stones 100 - 150 m thick overlying rocks of Precambrian age. The limited information available suggests that the feature may be an extraterrestrial impact crater, but other origins such as sinkhole, volcanic cone, or kettle, are not ruled out. Time of formation is not known, but likely times include the Pleistocene when the area was exposed by glacial erosion, the middle Ordovician near the time of deposition of lime-stones, or the Cambro-Ordovician or Precambrian when erosion surfaces of this age were exposed. A subtle negative magnetic anomaly coincides with the feature and is consistent with an impact origin, though not positively diagnostic. Relief of the feature is low compared to that typical of an impact crater of this size. Glaciation may have diminished relief by eroding the rim and filling the central basin with <b>drift.</b> <b>Verification</b> as an impact crater will require detailed geophysical surveys and collection and analy-ses of samples from {{in and around the}} structure...|$|E

The external attachment design of MOTR enables it to be easily integrated into existing blackbodies and other equipment. Internal temperature sensors and Peltier thermoelectric cooling devices (TECs) enables phase change materials (PCM) to be melted and monitored independent of the device they are attached to. Following the phase transition measurement, the TEC is disabled, and the recalibrated MOTR temperature sensor will reach thermal equilibrium with the blackbody it is attached to, permitting comparison of the blackbody temperature measurements and the MOTR sensor.

40|$|Detecting frauds {{in credit}} card {{transactions}} is {{perhaps one of}} the best testbeds for computational intelligence algorithms. In fact, this problem involves a number of relevant challenges, namely: concept drift (customers' habits evolve and fraudsters change their strategies over time), class imbalance (genuine transactions far outnumber frauds), and verification latency (only a small set of transactions are timely checked by investigators). However, the vast majority of learning algorithms that have been proposed for fraud detection rely on assumptions that hardly hold in a real-world fraud-detection system (FDS). This lack of realism concerns two main aspects: 1) the way and timing with which supervised information is provided and 2) the measures used to assess fraud-detection performance. This paper has three major contributions. First, we propose, with the help of our industrial partner, a formalization of the fraud-detection problem that realistically describes the operating conditions of FDSs that everyday analyze massive streams of credit card transactions. We also illustrate the most appropriate performance measures to be used for fraud-detection purposes. Second, we design and assess a novel learning strategy that effectively addresses class imbalance, concept <b>drift,</b> and <b>verification</b> latency. Third, in our experiments, we demonstrate the impact of class unbalance and concept drift in a real-world data stream containing more than 75 million transactions, authorized over a time window of three years. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|R
40|$|Many {{distributed}} applications require a clock synchro-nization service. We have previously proposed a clock synchronization {{service for the}} Controller Area Network (CAN), which we have claimed to provide highly synchro-nized clocks even in the occurrence of faults in the system. In this paper we substantiate this claim by providing a for-mal model and verification of our fault tolerant clock syn-chronization mechanism. We base our modeling and ver-ification on timed automata theory as implemented by the model checking tool UPPAAL. In the modeling we intro-duce a novel technique for modeling <b>drifting</b> clocks. The <b>verification</b> shows that a precision {{in the order of}} 2 µs is guaranteed despite node’s faults as well as consistent channel faults. It also shows that inconsistent channel faults may significantly worsen the achievable precision, but that this effect can be reduced by choosing a suitable resynchronization period. 1...|$|R
