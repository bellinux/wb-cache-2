25|$|Both Sheffield United and Small Heath fielded {{the same}} {{personnel}} {{as in the}} last game of the previous season, which Small Heath had won to secure their First Division status. The Sheffield Independents prediction that {{the result would be}} reversed proved justified. The players had not yet <b>got</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> new rule forbidding the thrower to step over the line while taking a throw-in, and after penalising the Sheffield captain for a foul throw, the referee took time out to demonstrate the correct procedure.|$|E
25|$|Alan Davidson led {{their attack}} {{in this and}} other Tests. He had a {{beautiful}} action, run-up and delivery and, besides being pretty fast, he made the ball swing into the batsmen very late. Often, our batsmen {{had to make a}} hurried stroke against him because they thought it would not swing. Then when they <b>got</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> fact that it did, he would send one down that didn't! But we found that the great thing about Alan was to keep him from getting a wicket in his first four or five overs. If this happened, he was inclined to lose enthusiasm and with it went his fire. Unfortunately for us, this seldom happened.|$|E
500|$|Badler had {{a four-month}} guest {{contract}} with the show and she began filming her first scenes in April which were due to air in June 2010. Badler admitted that filming her first scenes were hard and she [...] "could not get it together". She said [...] "I noticed {{a few of the}} other new people. They all went through the same thing, where you have a day where you just go, 'Wow, I can't seem to function!'". Badler also said that occasionally there were no rehearsals and that it was [...] "very daunting" [...] and challenging. She added that the cast were [...] "really nice" [...] and that she <b>got</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> quick pace of filming. Badler's debut episode aired on 22 June 2010. When Badler was asked if the door would be left open for Diana to return, she said [...] "Oh yes, absolutely. I was contracted for four months and the way that it ended is very {{up in the air and}} I'm sure that they will use me whenever they need to shake things up a bit, you know".|$|E

2500|$|After {{her third}} divorce, Katori decided to support herself. She first ran a {{gasoline}} station, and, as of 2006, {{was running a}} company canteen. Reflecting on {{her role as a}} pioneering pink film star, Katori says, [...] "I enjoyed my acting, but I never really <b>got</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> atmosphere of the pink movie business." [...] However, she adds, [...] "I've got no regrets about my time in the entertainment world. I'd still go back there now to perform if there was a part for this old girl." ...|$|E
2500|$|Francis Ford Coppola {{was drawn}} to S. E. Hinton's novel Rumble Fish because of the strong {{personal}} identification he had with the subject matter— a younger brother who hero-worships an older, intellectually superior brother, which mirrored the relationship between Coppola and his brother, August. A dedication to August appears as the film's final end credit. The director said that he [...] "started to use Rumble Fish as my carrot for what I promised myself when I finished The Outsiders". Halfway through the production of The Outsiders, Coppola decided {{that he wanted to}} retain the same production team, stay in Tulsa, and shoot Rumble Fish right after The Outsiders. He wrote the screenplay for Rumble Fish with Hinton on Sundays, their day off from shooting The Outsiders. During rehearsals, Dillon <b>got</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> adult-like acting behavior and situations after having been in The Outsiders. Dillon and Rourke developed a friendship when filming, getting used to their interesting, mischievous characters.|$|E
2500|$|Despite {{the initial}} negativity, the storyline had a {{powerful}} impact on public attitudes and the show's handling of Colin and Barry's relationship was deemed by many gay activists {{as something of a}} breakthrough. Not only did EastEnders brave the wrath of many viewers and journalists, but they also explored anti-gay bigotry through the characters in the show - most notably via Albert Square's local gossip Dot Cotton (June Brown), who erupted into horror and ignorant self-righteousness upon discovering Colin and Barry's secret, and even spread rumours that Colin had AIDS. The episode featuring the kiss was watched by over 17 million viewers, and Colin and Barry remained on-screen for several years, accessing millions of viewers each episode — the gay community were finally being represented on mass audience mainstream television. Gradually, negative assumptions began to lessen, public opinion began to shift in Colin and Barry's favour and even Dot <b>got</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> idea of having gay neighbours. Michael Cashman, the actor turned politician who played Colin, has commented: [...] "This was a flagship BBC show, the most popular series in the country, and Colin and Barry were there day in, day out. The relationship wasn't sensationalised, and the public devoured it." ...|$|E
6000|$|Jimmy {{looked at}} the speaker with admiration. After all, there was a breezy {{delirium}} about Spike's methods of thought that was rather stimulating when you <b>got</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> it. <b>The</b> worst {{of it was that}} it did not fit in with practical, everyday life. Under different conditions--say, during convivial evenings at Bloomingdale--he could imagine the Bowery boy being a charming companion. How pleasantly, for instance, such remarks as that last would while away the monotony of a padded cell! ...|$|R

While not intuitive <b>to</b> learn, once <b>the</b> rider <b>got</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> it, <b>the</b> semi-automatic transmission, [...] "took the terror out of motorcycling" [...] for novice riders.

[...] The importance of Colin was so great in the gay community at the time that Cashman was asked to lead a march against Section 28, which prohibited local authorities from promoting homosexuality or the acceptability of homosexuality.|$|E
