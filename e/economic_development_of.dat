5|$|Malaria is {{not just}} a disease {{commonly}} associated with poverty: some evidence suggests that it is also a cause of poverty and a major hindrance to economic development. Although tropical regions are most affected, malaria's furthest influence reaches into some temperate zones that have extreme seasonal changes. The disease has been associated with major negative economic effects on regions where it is widespread. During the late 19th and early 20th centuries, it was {{a major factor in the}} slow <b>economic</b> <b>development</b> <b>of</b> the American southern states.|$|E
5|$|The {{religion}} {{entered a}} new phase of activity when a message of the Universal House of Justice dated 20 October 1983 was released. Bahá'ís were urged to seek out ways, compatible with the Bahá'í teachings, {{in which they could}} become involved in the social and <b>economic</b> <b>development</b> <b>of</b> the communities in which they lived. Worldwide in 1979 there were 129 officially recognized Bahá'í socio-economic development projects. By 1987, the number of officially recognized development projects had increased to 1482.|$|E

5|$|Despite his wealth, he was {{not known}} for a lavish life. His court of about a hundred people was not known for being overly extravagant, he built no luxurious residences, and did not even have a single {{portrait}} of himself made during his life. It is uncertain how Wiśniowiecki looked, although a number of portraits and other works depicting him exist. Jan Widacki notes {{that much of the}} historiography concerning Wiśniowiecki focuses on the military and political aspects of his life, and few of his critics discuss his successes in the <b>economic</b> <b>development</b> <b>of</b> his estates.|$|E
5|$|In 1999, Ove Arup and Partners {{engineering}} {{undertook a}} feasibility study for a bridge downstream from the Monnow bridge, but the scheme was not progressed at that time. Both the County and Town Councils remained {{committed to the}} construction of a new crossing to support the <b>economic</b> <b>development</b> <b>of</b> the town, and in 2003 local authority funding of £1.3M was secured and construction commenced. The new bridge opened on 15 March 2004 for local traffic, allowing the old bridge to become pedestrianised. The closure to traffic also enabled a significant repair programme to be undertaken, in part funded by the Welsh Government and the European Union. After further conservation and repair, the gatehouse was formally re-opened in 2014, allowing public access on one day per week.|$|E
5|$|Strandzha Nature Park was {{established}} on 25 January 1995 to protect ecosystems and biodiversity, {{as well as}} the traditional cultural, historical and folklore heritage of the region. Before 1995 the protection of the region had been fragmented, consisting of isolated nature reserves and protected areas. The park is administered by a directorate based in Malko Tarnovo and subordinated to the Executive Forest Agency of the Ministry of Environment and Water of Bulgaria. The directorate implements the state policy for the management and control of the protected area, aiming at the long-term conservation of the unique nature and ensuring the sustainable social and <b>economic</b> <b>development</b> <b>of</b> the region. It monitors the management and conservation of the forests, game, and fish resources while encouraging tourism and environmental protection.|$|E

5|$|The {{state and}} federal governments also had {{conflicts}} on the economic front. UMNO leaders feared that the economic dominance of Singapore would inevitably shift political power away from Kuala Lumpur. Despite earlier agreement to establish a common market, Singapore continued to face restrictions when trading with the rest of Malaysia. In retaliation, Singapore refused to provide Sabah and Sarawak {{the full extent of the}} loans previously agreed to for the <b>economic</b> <b>development</b> <b>of</b> the two eastern states. The Bank of China branch of Singapore was closed by the Central Government in Kuala Lumpur as it was suspected of funding communists. The situation escalated to such an extent that talks between UMNO and the PAP broke down, and abusive speeches and writings became rife on both sides. UMNO extremists called for the arrest of Lee Kuan Yew.|$|E
5|$|After Napoleon's total {{defeat in}} 1815, the Congress of Vienna merged the French {{territory}} in Belgium with the Netherlands {{to form the}} United Kingdom of the Netherlands as a buffer state against the French. It was ruled by William I of Orange. The synergy of combining the manufacturing centers in Belgium with the important exporting ports in the Netherlands encouraged growth of the industrial cloth manufacturing and metallurgic centers in Wallonia. Keen to promote the <b>economic</b> <b>development</b> <b>of</b> the southern provinces as well, William I founded the Société Générale des Pays-Bas in 1822 to provide businesses with capital to invest in machinery. The Société Générale served as a driving force behind Belgian industrialization in the 19th century, and at its height controlled large swathes of the national economy. William I also encouraged the creation of educational facilities in the Southern Provinces, founding the State University of Leuven, the University of Liège and Ghent University in 1817.|$|E
5|$|Russian tsar Alexander I, also newly crowned King of Poland, gave Zajączek on 3 December 1815 the {{position}} of the first Namestnik of Kingdom of Poland (tsar's deputized ruler of the territory, a position similar to that of a viceroy). This nomination surprised many, including Zajączek himself, who is said to have at first refused this position, but in the end accepted it after Alexander phrased his request as a direct order. Zajączek's years as a namestnik have garnered mixed reviews, both among his contemporaries, as well as among later historians. He was actively interested in <b>economic</b> <b>development</b> <b>of</b> Polish lands, and contributed to the industrialization and urbanization of the Kingdom's lands; he {{was also one of the}} founders of the University of Warsaw. He has been criticized, however, for being inexperienced for such a major civil leader position, too servile to the wishes of his patron, Grand Duke Constantine Pavlovich and he often disregarded the Constitution of the Congress Poland, which contributed to a slow but steady erosion of the country's freedoms and autonomy. Deferential towards the Russian authorities, he readily let Duke Constantine and Alexander's commissar, Nikolay Nikolayevich Novosiltsev, neither of whose positions were envisioned in the Constitution, become the de facto rulers of the Kingdom. In recognition of Zajączek's services, Aleksander I bestowed upon him the title of 'Prince of Poland' on 27 April 1818.|$|E

5|$|The {{son of a}} {{military}} mandarin from central Vietnam, Định moved south {{when his father was}} posted to Gia Định as the provincial commander. Định grew up to lead {{a military}} colony, overseeing the settlement and <b>economic</b> <b>development</b> <b>of</b> his constituency. He gained a reputation for being an able leader and land developer who cared for his people. When France began its invasion of southern Vietnam in 1859, Định organised local militia to reinforce the imperial army. As the regular army units suffered defeats on the battlefield, its remnants joined Định's partisans, and by 1861, he had around 6,000 men under his command. Định built his own resistance base and organised guerrilla attacks against the French. His success led Tự Đức to grant Định command of the southern partisans and to order the regular commanders to coordinate their plans with him. Định's forces quickly gained the respect of the French. They focused on disrupting the French bureaucracy and military posts in addition to the transportation of rice. Their most notable attack was the sinking of L'Espérance in December 1861.|$|E
5|$|The use of steamboats {{along the}} river, {{beginning}} with the British Beaver in 1836 and followed by American vessels in 1850, contributed to the rapid settlement and <b>economic</b> <b>development</b> <b>of</b> the region. Steamboats operated in several distinct stretches of the river: on its lower reaches, from the Pacific Ocean to Cascades Rapids; from the Cascades to Celilo Falls; from Celilo to the confluence with the Snake River; on the Wenatchee Reach of eastern Washington; on British Columbia's Arrow Lakes; and on tributaries like the Willamette, the Snake and Kootenay Lake. The boats, initially powered by burning wood, carried passengers and freight throughout the region for many years. Early railroads served to connect steamboat lines interrupted by waterfalls on the river's lower reaches. In the 1880s, railroads maintained by companies such as the Oregon Railroad and Navigation Company began to supplement steamboat operations as the major transportation links along the river.|$|E
