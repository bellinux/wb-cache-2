5|$|Depending {{on where}} it is used, the phrase has had {{different}} emphasis through the years. It was formally intended as a prayer <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>soul</b> <b>of</b> the condemned.

5|$|Kratos {{falls into}} the River Styx, where he loses the Blade of Olympus; {{the souls of the}} Underworld weaken him and ruin the Blades of Athena. Climbing from the river, he is confronted by the spirit of Athena, who had {{previously}} sacrificed herself to save Zeus from Kratos. She tells Kratos that her sacrifice has brought her to a higher existence, and she now sees truths she did not see before. She states that as long as Zeus reigns, there is no hope for mankind. She gives him the Blades of Exile and says that to kill Zeus, he must quench the Flame of Olympus. After finding the three Judges of the Underworld and the Chain of Balance, Kratos encounters the spirit of Pandora, whom he mistakes for his dead daughter, Calliope. Refusing to help the child, he continues his quest. After encountering the Olympian blacksmith Hephaestus and recovering the Blade of Olympus, he kills Hades, which releases the souls of the Underworld. When he considers searching <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>soul</b> <b>of</b> Calliope, Athena reminds Kratos of his quest, and he leaves the Underworld, arriving at Olympia. There he finds the wounded Gaia, who calls for help. He severs her arm, causing her to fall from Mount Olympus to her apparent death.|$|E

5|$|Large cathedrals such as Elgin {{had many}} chapel altars with daily {{services}} {{that needed to}} be suitably staffed with canons assisted by a plentiful number of chaplains and vicars. Bishop Andreas allowed for the canons to be aided by seventeen vicars made up of seven priests, five deacons and five sub-deacons—later the number of vicars was increased to twenty-five. In 1350 the vicars at Elgin could not live on their stipends and Bishop John of Pilmuir provided them with the income from two churches and the patronage of another from Thomas Randolph, second Earl of Moray. By 1489 one vicar had a stipend of 12 marks; six others, 10 marks; one, eight marks; three, seven marks, and six received five marks; each vicar was employed directly by a canon who was required to provide four months' notice in the event of his employment being terminated. The vicars were of two kinds: the vicars-choral who worked chiefly in the choir taking the main services and the chantry chaplains who performed services at the individual foundation altars though there was some overlapping of duties. Although the chapter followed the constitution of Lincoln, the form of divine service copied that of Salisbury Cathedral. It is recorded that Elgin's vicars-choral were subject to disciplinary correction for shortcomings in the performance of the services, resulting in fines. More serious offences could end in corporal punishment, which was administered in the chapterhouse by the sub-dean and witnessed by the chapter. King Alexander II founded a chaplaincy <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>soul</b> <b>of</b> King Duncan I who died in battle with Macbeth near Elgin. The chapel most frequently referenced in records was St Thomas the Martyr, located in the north transept and supported by five chaplains. Other chaplaincies mentioned are those of the Holy Rood, St Catherine, St Duthac, St Lawrence, St Mary Magdalene, St Mary the Virgin and St Michael. By the time of Bishop Bur's episcopate (1362–1397), the cathedral had 15canons (excluding dignitaries), 22vicars-choral and about the same number of chaplains.|$|E

25|$|In {{the later}} Middle Ages {{the number of}} monks ranged from 12 to 18. Generally one was away, heading Morville Priory, a {{dependent}} monastic cell between Bridgnorth and Much Wenlock. In addition to the canonical hours there was regular celebration of Mass in {{the growing number of}} chantries and other chapels. The chapel of St Mary, behind the High Altar, contained the tomb of Earl Roger and was endowed well from the early 13th century. A monk was appointed as its warden and it was initially used to celebrate Mass for visiting dignitaries. In 1343-4 a chantry was established there <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>soul</b> <b>of</b> Ralph of Shrewsbury, the Bishop of Bath and Wells, funded from the revenues of Boreton. Another chantry was endowed for John Burley in 1414, and shortly afterwards Henry V decided to establish a chantry in honour of St Winifred but, this had to wait until much later.|$|E

25|$|Although largely {{absent from}} his diocese between 1436 and 1445, his {{presence}} is on record for January 1439, February 1441, and February 1445. From 1445 onwards he appears settled in his diocese, {{and the evidence}} once again indicates Crannach's concern with securing the rights and privileges of his office and see. One of his earliest acts in this period was the purchase of land at Keithock (Angus). He endowed a chaplaincy on 11 June 1451 {{for the benefit of}} his own soul, and <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>soul</b> <b>of</b> his former lord Walter Stewart, despite the damnatio memoriae of the latter for regicide. The dispute with the archdeacon Gilbert Forrester continued, Forrester's excommunication being renewed on 30 July 1448. Forrester tried to secure exemption from episcopal authority at the Roman court. Although Crannach resisted Forrester, the bishop-archdeacon dispute was to continue after Crannach's death. Crannach also attacked his dean, John de Lichton (Leighton) for inefficiency and immorality.|$|E
25|$|Healey was {{returned}} unopposed as deputy leader to Foot, {{but the next}} year was challenged by Tony Benn under the new election system, one in which individual members and trades unions voted alongside sitting member of parliament. The contest {{was seen as a}} battle <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>soul</b> <b>of</b> the Labour Party, and long debate over the summer of 1981 ended on 27 September with Healey winning by 50.4% to Benn's 49.6%. The narrowness of Healey's majority {{can be attributed to the}} Transport and General Workers' Union (TGWU) delegation to the Labour Party conference. Ignoring its members, who had shown two-to-one majority support for Healey, it cast the union's block vote (the largest in the union section) for Benn. A significant factor in Benn's narrow loss, however, was the abstention of 20 MPs from the left-wing Tribune Group, which split as a result. Healey attracted just enough support from other unions, constituency parties and Labour MPs to win.|$|E
25|$|When {{sufficiently}} complete (probably late in 1087), regular {{life began}} {{under the first}} abbot, Fulchred of Sées. The Abbey of Saint-Martin-de-Sées was closely associated with Shrewsbury {{in the early years}} because Earl Roger was its founder and he and the House of Bellême, into which he had married, were also major benefactors there, as were Roger's knights. A notification lodged at Sées in 1086 by Robert of Bellême, Roger's son, who was later to become 3rd Earl of Shrewsbury, shows that they used the monks as witnesses in their property deals and custodians of the documents. About the time he recruited Abbot Fulchred or Foucher, Earl Roger made a huge grant of estates in England to Sées, <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>soul</b> <b>of</b> recently deceased William the Conqueror, as well as of Queen Matilda and of Roger himself and his dead wife Mabel de Bellême. Some of these were estates he had originally intended for Mabel. It seems that Sées Abbey for a time harboured plans to claim jurisdiction over Shrewsbury and it also contested some properties granted by Earl Roger; however, Shrewsbury became independent.|$|E

25|$|William Larder married Constance Pyne, heiress of Upton Pyne. He was {{succeeded by}} his son Edmond Larder (died 1521), whose effigy survives in Upton Pyne Church, set within a Tudor-arched recess.

Below are four sculpted heraldic shields. Edmond married Isabel (or Elizabeth) Bonville, one of the daughters and co-heiresses of John Bonville (died 1491), lord of the manor of Combe Raleigh, Devon, and bastard son of the magnate William Bonville, 1st Baron Bonville (died 1461). He was {{followed}} {{by his son}} Tristram Larder (1515–1547), who married Mary Stucley, a daughter of Sir Hugh Stucley (1496–1559), lord of the manor of Affeton and Sheriff of Devon in 1545. He was followed by his son Humphrey Larder (died 1588), whose chest tomb survives in Upton Pyne Church. Humphrey died without male children and left as his sole heiress his only daughter, Margaret Larder, who married Anthony Coplestone (died 1648) of Weare Gifford, who made Upton Pyne his residence.|$|E
