40|$|Since {{the first}} laparoscopic {{cholecystectomy}} performed in 1987 by Philippe Mouret in Lyon (France), {{there has been}} a real revolution in the field of visceral surgery: more and more operations are performed by this mini-invasive surgical method: lithiasis of the common bile duct, Nissen and <b>Heller</b> <b>procedure,</b> truncal vagotomies, abdominal and thoracic, supra-selective vagotomies, hernia, appendectomy, band sections during intestinal occlusion, resection of the colon and rectum, oesophagectomies [...] . In Belgium, more than 3, 000 cholecystectomies have been listed in a national registry in which the modalities and complications of this laparoscopic approach have been scrutinized. During the years to come, there will be an important technological development which will make this procedure easier, safer and quicker. Consequences of this new approach cannot completely be foreseen but there are some drawbacks: possible simplification of well established surgical techniques in order to facilitate the laparoscopic approach, causing a deterioration of the long term results, teaching and training difficulties for young and older surgeons, very costly equipment...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND/AIMS: Intraoperative Esophageal Manometry is {{used during}} surgery for {{gastroesophageal}} reflux disease {{to obtain a}} better lower esophageal sphincter pressure, or during the <b>Heller</b> <b>procedure</b> for achalasia to verify the myotomy. The effectiveness of this manometry is not explicit. MATERIAL AND METHODS: From 1977 to 1987, 58 patients underwent surgery for achalasia at our Institution. A transabdominal Heller's myotomy and a modified Dor's anterior fundoplication were performed in all cases. During the operation, Lower Esophageal Sphincter Pressure was measured in 38 patients (A group) to verify the completeness of the càr-diomyotomy; the fundoplication-induced pressure increase was also recorded. Twenty patients (B group) underwent surgery without intraoperative manometry. Forty-six patients (30 of A group and 16 of B group) were followed up for 24 to 120 months (median 68 months) {{by means of a}} clinical questionnaire, barium meal, manometry and 24 -hour esophageal pH monitoring. RESULTS: In 21 cases, intraoperative manometry showed the completeness of the myotomy at the first record, while in the remaining 17 it revealed the persistence of a High Pressure Zone; in these, a more accurate incision of the muscle layers on the anterior surface of the esophagus was subsequently performed up to a complete abolition of the HPZ. Long-term results were excellent or good in 27 (90...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: The {{association}} of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) insensitivity with achalasia and alacrimia (Allgrove syndrome, 3 A) constitutes a rare multisystem disorder. Its evolution {{is not well}} known. The {{aim of this study}} was to describe clinical and esophageal manometric characteristics and outcomes in Allgrove syndrome. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This multicenter retrospective study compared clinical and manometric characteristics at diagnosis and on follow-up of 9 children presenting with 3 A (mean age at diagnosis 7. 1 years) with those of 9 children with idiopathic achalasia (IA) (mean age at diagnosis 8. 3 years). RESULTS: At the time of diagnosis, 3 children with 3 A presented with no digestive or respiratory signs because they were identified during a family screening; 1 remained asymptomatic 8 years later. ACTH levels were high in patients with 3 A. All of the patients with IA were symptomatic at diagnosis. No significant difference was observed when comparing any of the manometric parameters of the first esophageal manometry of 3 A with those of IA. Seven children with 3 A were operated on using the <b>Heller</b> <b>procedure,</b> completed by pneumatic esophageal dilation in 2 of these 7. One patient with 3 A was treated only by nifedipine. Failure of treatment was observed in 3 children with 3 A and 1 child with IA, partial success in 4 with 3 A and 1 with IA, and total success in 2 with 3 A and 7 with IA (P< 0. 03). Control manometry showed that in the 3 A group, partial success after surgery was always associated with abnormally low or normal lower esophageal sphincter (LES) pressure, whereas failure after surgery was associated with high LES pressure. CONCLUSIONS: Our data showed that 3 A presented a more severe course than IA despite presymptomatic diagnosis in cases of family screening. The high LES pressure noted in some patients with 3 A is suggestive of a peculiar pattern in 3 A affecting the LES and the lower part of the esophagus.

40|$|Thirty-three {{patients}} who have suffered with dysphagia to solids and liquids for a varying number of years are reviewed. They all had a history and radiologic findings suggestive of achalasia of the esophagus. Thirty-one of the cases who had uncomplicated achalasia benefited from a transthoracic modified <b>Heller's</b> <b>procedure.</b> Lower esophageal diaphragm and carcinoma arising in the proximal half of the distal third of the esophagus occurred in association with achalasia in two patients. Over 90 percent had symptomatic relief of their symptoms. The only mortality was recorded in a patient who had palliative esophagogastrectomy for associated carcinoma. A properly performed anterior extramucosal esophagomyotomy is the safest and most effective procedure available, even in places with minimal facilities...|$|R
40|$|Successful surgery {{starts in}} the anatomy laboratory. Unfortunately for surgeons, anatomy is not {{constant}} and operations are designed for the most common anatomical consideration. Even more, in some regions the laparoscopic anatomy seems to be „different” as in open approach. During the laparoscopic surgery the anatomical landmarks {{are more important than}} in open surgery (due to the lack of palpation). We describe the anatomical landmarks of the diaphragm, liver and eso-cardial junction important for different operations such Nissen, Toupet, dor or <b>Heller</b> surgical <b>procedures.</b> Some data from literature are also reviewed...|$|R
40|$|Background: This report {{describes}} three Italian centers’ {{experience in}} the treatment of children with esophageal achalasia. Patients and Methods: Between June 2000 and June 2012, 31 children (13 girls and 18 boys, with a median age of 8. 4 years) affected by esophageal achalasia were treated in three different institutions with an esophagomyotomy according to <b>Heller’s</b> <b>procedure</b> via laparoscopy associated with a Dor antireflux procedure. Between 2000 and 2005 (for 14 patients) we used mono- or bipolar coagulation to perform myotomy; after 2005 (for 17 patients) we used the new hemostatic devices to perform it. Results: Median length of surgery was 120 minutes. Median hospital stay was 4 days. We recorded eight complications in our series: 3 patients (9. 6 %) had a mucosal perforation, and 5 children (16. 1 %) presented dysphagia after surgery. When comparing the data before and after 2005, it seems that the new hemostatic devices statistically shortened the length of surgery (P <. 01, Student’s t test). Conclusions: On the basis of our experience, laparoscopic Heller’s myotomy associated with an antireflux procedure is a safe and effective method for the treatment of achalasia in the pediatric population. Intraoperative complications were < 10 %, and they occurred mostly at the beginning of our experience. Residual dysphagia occurred in about 16 % of cases. The use of the new hemostatic devices seems to reduce the length of surgery and intraoperative bleeding. Considering the rarity of this pathology, we believe that patients with achalasia have to be treated only at centers with a strong {{experience in the}} treatment of this pathology...|$|R
40|$|Esophageal {{achalasia}} is {{a primary}} esophageal motility disorder. Commonly used treatments are botulinum toxin injections, endoscopic balloon dilation and surgical myotomy with or withoutfundoplication. We are hereby presenting the first case of laproscopic myotomy with fundoplication performed in Croatia. A 32 -year old female {{was admitted to the}} hospital due to the symptoms of dysphagia, regurgitation, chest pain and weight loss. Upper gastrointestinal tract radiography with contrast and flexible endoscopy confirmed the clinical diagnosis of achalasia. She was treated by the <b>Heller</b> laparoscopic <b>procedure</b> and Dor anterior fundoplication. The patient had a successful recovery and was discharged on the fifth postoperative day. This case shows thatlaparoscopic treatment of achalasia is a feasibile and safe procedure which can be performed even in a small country hospital, but it requires great technical care and experience of the surgeon...|$|R
40|$|The {{standard}} of care for achalasia is laparoscopic <b>Heller's</b> cardiomyotomy. This <b>procedure</b> achieves satisfactory and long-standing results in over 85  % of patients. However, in 10 - 15  % of patients, esophageal function will progressively deteriorate, and up to 5  % will develop end-stage achalasia. Options in these difficult patients are limited, and include redo cardiomyotomy, repeat dilatation, and in severe cases, esophagectomy. In this report, we describe an alternate approach, a cardioplasty, which was originally described by Heyrovsky in 1913. The development of an angulated stapling device now makes this operation feasible by a laparoscopic approach. This report highlights our technique for laparoscopic cardioplasty in patients with end-stage achalasia. Ewen A. Griffiths, Peter G. Devitt, Glyn G. Jamieson, Jennifer C. Myers, Sarah K.

40|$|Abstract The {{principal}} {{causes of}} {{failure of the}} surgical treatment of achalasia are gastroesophageal reflux and obstructive dysphagia due either to an incomplete myotomy or to a narrow antireflux procedure. In 1978 Hill introduced intraoperative manometry to check the completness of the myotomy and to calibrate the antireflux procedure to avoid postoperative gastroesophageal reflux and/or dysphagia. The authors used intraoperative manometry in sixteen cases of achalasia operated on with a <b>Heller</b> plus Nissen <b>procedure.</b> After myotomy a pressure of zero cm H 2 O was reached. The intraoperative degree of stricture obtained with the Nissen procedure corresponded to a pressure of 20 cm H 2 O. The clinical results were good in 15 cases and fair in one case. Comparing these results with those obtained in 38 patients previously operated on with a Heller plus Nissen fundoplication without using intraoperative manometry (good in 32, fair in 4 and poor in 2 cases) the authors conclude that this procedure may improve the results of surgical therapy of esophageal achalasia...|$|R
40|$|Film {{modeling}} {{was found}} to reduce anxiety in children preparing for hospitalization and surgery. These effects held true {{even in the absence}} of a large scale preoperative preparation program in the hospital. Older children appeared to benefit from seeing the film one week in advance of actual hospitalization. Younger children needed more immediate preparation. The effectiveness of the film in reducing anxiety was enhanced when the child observer was similar in age, sex, and race to the child narrator of the film. Previous research has demonstrated the effectiveness of filmed peer models undergoing preoperative preparation on the presurgical anxiety reduction of children about to undergo their first hospital experience (Melamed & Siegel, 1975; Vernon & Bailey, 1974). Current interest focused on defining the critical variables determining appropriate timing and type of preparation. The age of the child has been isolated as a theoretically meaningful variable. Most authors believe that older children may benefit from a longer interval between preparation and the occurrence of the <b>procedure.</b> <b>Heller</b> (1967) also suggested that older children need a more lengthy and detailed preparation. Mellish (1969) felt that younger children need only a few days of preparation since longer intervals may only increase their anticipatory anxiety. However, the ideal time has never been subjected to systematic research efforts. Robertson (1958) feels that preparation should begin no sooner than one week prior to admission, whereas Dimock (1960...|$|R
