5000|$|One {{effect of}} <b>equinoctial</b> <b>periods</b> is the {{temporary}} disruption of communications satellites. For all geostationary satellites, {{there are a}} few days around the equinox when the sun goes directly behind the satellite relative to Earth (i.e. within the beam-width of the ground-station antenna) for a short period each day. The Sun's immense power and broad radiation spectrum overload the Earth station's reception circuits with noise and, depending on antenna size and other factors, temporarily disrupt or degrade the circuit. The duration of those effects varies but can range from a few minutes to an hour.

The results show profound seasonal and geomagnetic effects. Except for <b>equinoctial</b> <b>period,</b> there is an excellent consistency in the magnitudes (nearly 20 m/s) and patterns of upward daytime F-region drifts at low and high solar activity periods. Evening F-region exhibits strong motion with absolute mean value for quiet-time (15 m/s) greater than on disturbed-time (10 m/s). The average downward quiet midnight-early morning hours sector value is well below than 10 m/s. The evening reversal time is earliest and latest during solstitial periods. Prereversal peak is season dependent and varies strongly with magnetic activity. We show that prereversal peak, daytime, and nighttime maximum drifts saturate at particular values of F 10. 7 cm solar radio flux index, effects not noticed with corresponding sunspot number. Our observations confirm several previous results from other equatorial sites utilizing different experimental techniques...|$|R

40|$|International audienceWe {{present the}} first multi-instrumental {{results on the}} ionospheric {{response}} to the geomagnetic storm of 17 – 18 March 2015 (the St. Patrick's Day storm) that was up to now the strongest in the 24 th solar cycle (minimum SYM-H value of À 233 nT). The storm caused complex effects around the globe. The most dramatic positive ionospheric storm occurred at low latitudes in the morning (~ 100 – 150 % enhancement) and postsunset (~ 80 – 100 % enhancement) sectors. These significant vertical total electron content increases were observed in different local time sectors and at different universal time, but around the same area of the Eastern Pacific region, which indicates a regional impact of storm drivers. Our analysis revealed that this particular region was most concerned by {{the increase in the}} thermospheric O/N 2 ratio. At midlatitudes, we observe inverse hemispheric asymmetries that occurred, despite the <b>equinoctial</b> <b>period,</b> in different longitudinal regions. In the European-African sector, positive storm signatures were observed in the Northern Hemisphere (NH), whereas in the American sector, a large positive storm occurred in the Southern Hemisphere, while the NH experienced a negative storm. The observed asymmetries can be partly explained by the thermospheric composition changes and partly by the hemispherically different nondipolar portions of the geomagnetic field {{as well as by the}} IMF By component variations. At high latitudes, negative ionospheric storm effects were recorded in all longitudinal regions, especially the NH of the Asian sector was concerned. The negative storm phase developed globally on 18 March at the beginning of the recovery phase...|$|R
40|$|Inclusion of {{complete}} ion chemistry in {{the calculation of}} minor species production during energetic particle deposition events leads to significant enhancement in the calculated nitric acid concentration during precipitation. An ionization rate of 1. 2 x 10 (exp 3) /cu cm/s imposed for 1 day increases HNO 3 from 3 x 10 (exp 5) to 6 x 10 (exp 7) /cu cm at 50 km. With an ionization rate of 600 cu cm/s, the maximum HNO 3 is 3 x 10 (exp 7) /cu cm. Calculations which neglect negative ions predict the nitric acid will fall during precipitation events. The decay time for converting HNO 3 into odd nitrogen and hydrogen is more than 1 day for <b>equinoctial</b> <b>periods</b> at 70 deg latitude.

40|$|We {{report on}} the longitudinal, local time and {{seasonal}} occurrence of equatorial plasma bubbles (EPBs) and L band (GPS) scintillations over equatorial Africa. The measurements were made in 2010, {{as a first step}} toward establishing the climatology of ionospheric irregularities over Africa. The scintillation intensity is obtained by measuring the standard deviation of normalized GPS signal power. The EPBs are detected using an automated technique, where spectral analysis is used to extract and identify EPB events from the GPS TEC measurements. Overall, the observed seasonal climatology of the EPBs as well as GPS scintillations in equatorial Africa is adequately explained by geometric arguments, i. e., by the alignment of the solar terminator and local geomagnetic field, or STBA hypothesis (Tsunoda, 1985, 2010 a). While plasma bubbles and scintillations are primarily observed during <b>equinoctial</b> <b>periods,</b> there are longitudinal differences in their seasonal occurrence statistics. The Atlantic sector has the most intense, longest lasting, and highest scintillation occurrence rate in-season. There is also a pronounced increase in the EPB occurrence rate during the June solstice moving west to east. In Africa, the seasonal occurrence shifts towards boreal summer solstice, with fewer occurrences and shorter durations in equinox seasons. Our results also suggest that the occurrence of plasma bubbles and GPS scintillations over Africa are well correlated, with scintillation intensity depending on depletion depth. A question remains about the possible physical mechanisms responsible for the difference in the occurrence phenomenology of EPBs and GPS scintillations between different regions in equatorial Africa...|$|E

Lat. 8. 8 ° N), Thailand; Tanjungsari (TNJ; 6. 9 ° S, 107. 6 ° E, mag. Lat. 16. 9 ° S), Indonesia; Palmas (PAL; 10. 2 ° S, 311. 8 ° E, mag.

The investigation was based on simultaneous ionograms recorded by an FMCW (frequency-modulated continuous-wave) at CGM, an IPS- 71 (digital ionosonde from KEL aerospace) at TNJ, a CADI (Canadian Advanced Digital Ionosonde) at PAL and SJC, and an AIS-INGV (Advanced Ionospheric Sounder – Istituto Nazionale di Geofisica e Vulcanologia) at TUC, during the <b>equinoctial</b> <b>periods</b> March–April (R 12 = 2. 0 and R 12 = 2. 2) and September–October (R 12 = 6. 1 and R 12 = 7. 0) 2009, for very low solar activity. Spread-F signatures were categorized into two types: the range spread-F (RSF) and the frequency spread-F (FSF). The study confirms that the dynamics and the physical processes responsible for these phenomena are actually complicated. In fact, the features that arise from the investigation are different, depending on both the longitude sector and on the hemisphere. For instance, TUC, under the southern crest of the ionospheric equatorial ionization anomaly (EIA), shows a predominance of RSF signatures, while both SJC, under the southern crest of EIA but in a different longitude sector, and CGM, under the northern crest of EIA, show a predominance of FSF signatures. Moreover, the spread-F occurrence over the longitude sector that includes CGM and TNJ is significantly lower than the spread-F occurrence over the longitude sector of PAL, SJC, and TUC...|$|E

40|$|We find that, in general, {{existing}} {{models of}} electron precipitation underestimate the soft electron component {{which is a}} prime driver of O+ upwelling. Our conclusion {{is supported by a}} detailed study of the relative influence of electron precipitation on upwelling O+ during quiet times producing upwelling O+ in the nightside auroral zone. We use the Field Line Interhemispheric Plasma (FLIP) ionospheric model to study the upwelling O+ on 40 field lines distributed across the auroral zone and magnetic local times, turning precipitation on and off as field lines move {{in and out of the}} auroral zone. We investigate the efficacy of electron precipitation patterns derived from the OVATION Prime and Hardy et al., [2008] models to produce upwelling O+ as a function of MLT and latitude. Our results indicate that during quiet times soft e- precipitation in the evening hours plays a critical role in controlling upwelling O+ in the cold night-side ionosphere but plays a relatively modest role in facilitating energetic O+ escape on the dayside. Detailed comparisons between the model output and statistical DMSP observations at 850 km show that the combination of using the output of two standard precipitation models during a quiet <b>equinoctial</b> <b>period</b> (Kp = 2, Ap = 7) as a single Maxwellian precipitating electron distribution input to this model does not sufficiently reproduce average observed upwelling fluxes in the nightside auroral zone. It is likely that an influential quantity of electron energy flux at sub 100 eV characteristic energies is unaccounted for in the standard models of electron precipitation. We have then devised an auroral electron precipitation pattern consisting of single modal Maxwellian distributions, which produces upwelling O+ fluxes that are in reasonable agreement with the DMSP observations as reported by Redmon et al., [2010]...|$|R

The analysis period covers four months representative of solstitial and <b>equinoctial</b> seasonal <b>periods</b> during solar minimum year of 1987 for geomagnetically quiet-day. It is demonstrated that the month-by-month morphological patterns between vertical E × B drifts and F 2 -layer parameters range from worst to reasonably good and are largely seasonally dependent. A cross-correlation analysis conducted between equatorial drift and F 2 -layer characteristics yield statistically significant correlations for equatorial vertical drift and IRI-Bo, IRI-Te and IRI-TEC, whereas little or no acceptable correlation is obtained with observational evidence. Examination of the association between measured foF 2, hmF 2 and M(3000)F 2 illustrates consistent much more smaller correlation coefficients with no systematic linkage.|$|R
40|$|Temperature {{observations}} of the middle atmosphere {{have been carried out}} from September 1993 through July 1995 using a Rayleigh backscatter lidar located at Utah State University (42 °N, lii 0 W). Data have been analyzed to obtain absolute temperature profi les from 40 to 90 km. Various sources of error were reviewed in order to ensure the quality of the measurements. This included conducting a detailed examination of the data reduction procedure, integration methods, and averaging techniques. eliminating errors of 1 - 3 %. The temperature structure climatology has been compared with several other mid-latitude data sets. including those from the French lidars, the SME spacecraft, the sodium lidars at Ft. Collins and Urbana, the MSISe 90 model, and a high-latitude composite set from Andenes, Norway. In general, good agreement occurs at mid-latitudes, but areas of disagreement do exist. Among these, the Ctah temperatures are significantly warmer than the MSJSe 90 temperatures above approximately 80 km, they are lower below 80 km than any of the others in summer, they show major year-to-year variability in the winter profiles, and they differ from the sodium lidar data at the altitudes where the temperature profiles should overlap. Also, comparisons between observations and a physics based global circulation model, the TIME-GCM, were conducted for a mid-latitude site. A photo-chemical model was developed to predict airglow intensity of OH based on output from the TIME-GCM. Many discrepancies between the model and observations were found, including a modeled summer mesopause too high, a stronger summer inversion not normally observed by lidar, a fall-spring asymmetry in the OH winds and lidar temperatures but not reproduced in the TIME-GCM <b>equinoctial</b> <b>periods,</b> larger winter seasonal wind tide than observed by the FPl, and a fai lure of the model to reverse the summenime mesospheric jet. It is our conclusion these discrepancies are due to a gravity wave parameterization in the model that is too weak and an increase will effectively align the model calculations with our observation...|$|E
30|$|Ionospheric {{irregularities}} {{known as}} spread F often prevent accurate scaling of ionograms and obtaining reliable values of F 2 layer peak {{characteristics such as}} critical frequency foF 2 and peak height hmF 2 (McNamara et al. 2008), which limits {{our knowledge of the}} ionosphere and predictability of conditions for radio wave propagation. Moreover, equatorial and low-latitude spread F is often associated with plasma bubbles and scintillations of global positioning system (GPS) signals (Chen et al. 2006; Shi et al. 2011; Alfonsi et al. 2013), which may cause inaccuracies in position determination. It is generally accepted that equatorial spread F (ESF) and plasma bubbles result from Rayleigh–Taylor instability triggered during the uplift of the F layer owing to the prereversal enhancement of the eastward (zonal) electric field and development of the steep plasma density gradient as the bottomside ionosphere becomes depleted after sunset (Fejer et al. 1999; Stolle et al. 2006; Abdu et al. 2009 a; Kelley 2009). The day-to-day variability and the roles of all factors that contribute to plasma bubble formation and spread F observation such as gravity wave (GW) seeding, neutral winds, angle between magnetic meridian, and solar terminator, however, remain enigmatic and are subjects of intense investigation (Kudeki et al. 2007; Abdu et al. 2009 a, b; Cabrera et al. 2010; Hysell et al. 2014). The prereversal enhancement of the eastward electric field and hence the enhancement of the plasma vertical drift vary with longitude and season and are likely an important controlling factor for large-amplitude equatorial plasma bubble development (Huang and Hairston 2015). 30  MHz coherent backscatter radar observations at Saõ Luís have shown that evening mean upward vertical drifts are a necessary but not sufficient condition for the occurrence of topside ESF echoes (Smith et al. 2015). It is assumed that plasma bubbles are generated above the geomagnetic equator and stretch along the magnetic field lines to low latitudes (Sultan 1996; Keskinen et al. 1998; Bhattacharyya and Burke 2000). The eastward movement of the developed plasma structures at velocities usually exceeding 100  m s− 1 has been experimentally confirmed by several independent studies (Terra et al. 2004; Haase et al. 2011; Chum et al. 2014). The zonal velocities derived from observations of ionospheric irregularities at night are also eastward with magnitudes decreasing from the geomagnetic equator to the equatorial ionization anomaly (EIA) crests (Kil et al. 2002). The mean zonal velocities of ionospheric irregularities at the Brazilian Saõ Luís equatorial station were larger during the December solstice and decayed during the <b>equinoctial</b> <b>periods</b> (Muella et al. 2009). Low-latitude all-sky imager observations in northern Argentina and Peru revealed at stations closer to the magnetic equator weaker (stronger) eastward plasma drifts in the postsunset (postmidnight) period (Martinis et al. 2003). Incoherent scatter radar observations at Jicamarca (Fejer et al. 2005) indicate daytime westward drifts and stronger nighttime eastward drifts under quiet conditions; nighttime perturbation drifts increase strongly with solar activity. Pacheco et al. (2011) investigated local‐time variations of zonal drifts at different latitudes, longitudes, and seasons using data from the Republic of China Satellite‐ 1 (ROCSAT‐ 1). Super-rotation of the ionosphere was observed in zonal drift measurements, particularly at lower latitudes.|$|E
