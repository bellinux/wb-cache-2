5|$|Some {{signal lights}} use a {{luminous}} paint, containing a phosphor that absorbs the beta radiation emitted by promethium-147 and emits light. This isotope <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>cause</b> {{aging of the}} phosphor, as alpha emitters do, and therefore the light emission is stable for a few years. Originally, radium-226 {{was used for the}} purpose, but it was later replaced by promethium-147 and tritium (hydrogen-3). Promethium may be favored over tritium for nuclear safety reasons.|$|E

In comparison to many other antidepressants, it <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>cause</b> as much weight gain, sexual dysfunction, or sleepiness. Bupropion acts as an norepinephrine-dopamine reuptake inhibitor (NDRI). It is an atypical antidepressant, different from most commonly prescribed antidepressants such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs).|$|E
5|$|A. piscivorus venom is more toxic {{than that}} of A. contortrix, and is rich with {{powerful}} cytotoxic venom that destroys tissue. Although deaths are rare, the bite can leave scars, and on occasion, require amputation. Absent an anaphylactic reaction in a bitten individual, however, the venom <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>cause</b> systemic reactions in victims and does not contain neurotoxic components present in numerous rattlesnake species. Bites can be effectively treated with CroFab antivenom; this serum is derived using venom components from four species of American pit vipers (the eastern and western diamondback rattlesnakes, the Mojave rattlesnake, and the cottonmouth).|$|E
5|$|Bupropion {{is one of}} few {{antidepressants}} that <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>cause</b> sexual dysfunction.

These hosts have adapted to the presence of the virus, which is present at high levels in the host's blood but evokes only a mild immune response, <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>cause</b> the development of simian AIDS, and does not undergo the extensive mutation and recombination typical of HIV infection in humans.|$|E
5|$|Agrilus planipennis, {{commonly}} known as the emerald ash borer, is a green buprestid or jewel beetle native to northeastern Asia that feeds on ash species. Females lay eggs in bark crevices on ash trees, and larvae feed underneath the bark of ash trees to emerge as adults in one to two years. In its native range, it is typically found at low densities and <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>cause</b> significant damage to trees native to the area. Outside its native range, it is an invasive species and is highly destructive to ash trees native to northwest Europe and North America. Prior to being found in North America, very little was known about emerald ash borer in its native range; this has resulted in much of the research on its biology being focused in North America. Local governments in North America are attempting to control it by monitoring its spread, diversifying tree species, insecticides, and biological control.|$|E

5|$|Drug {{overdose}} and intoxication {{are significant}} causes of accidental death, {{and can also}} be used as a form of suicide. Death can occur from overdosing on a single or multiple drugs, or from combined drug intoxication (CDI) due to poly drug use. Poly drug use often carries more risk than use of a single drug, due to an increase in side effects, and drug synergy. For example, the chance of death from overdosing on opiates is greatly increased when they are consumed in conjunction with alcohol. While they are two distinct phenomena, deaths from CDI are often misreported as overdoses. Drug overdoses and intoxication can also cause indirect deaths. For example, while marijuana <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>cause</b> fatal overdoses, being intoxicated by it can increase the chance of fatal traffic collisions.|$|E
5|$|Imposex has {{recently}} been detected in Laevistrombus canarium. Imposex {{is the development of}} male sex organs in female animals exposed to man-made organic tin compounds, such as tributyltin (TBT). It has negative consequences for several species of sea snails, ranging from sterility in some individuals to the extinction of entire populations. Tin compounds are biocidal anti-fouling agents mixed into paints to prevent marine encrustations on boats and ships. High concentrations of these compounds are commonly present in seawater near shipyards and docking areas, exposing nearby marine life to harmful effects. In a 2011 paper, Cob and colleagues found that imposex rates are high in dog conch populations near Malaysian ports; however, the researchers could not detect any cases of sterility in affected females. The authors concluded that females of L.canarium often develop a penis when seawater contains organotin compounds, but the phenomenon <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>cause</b> sterility in this species. The ability of the dog conch to survive despite imposex makes this species a suitable local bioindicator for organotin pollution.|$|E
5|$|It is {{possible}} that Leggetts Creek sometimes exceeds its total maximum daily load, especially during low flow conditions and the summer months. There are some mine drainage issues on the creek between Rockwell Avenue and Charles Street. It experiences some flow loss to underground mine voids. In 1978, the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Resources (now known as the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection) estimated that the creek lost 20 to 30 percent of its flow to mines during dry weather. However, the creek is large enough that this <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>cause</b> aquatic habitat to be lost. The Chinchilla sewage treatment plant discharges into the creek {{in the vicinity of}} Leggetts Gap. In its lower reaches, the creek is impacted by past mining, urban development, and debris. Stormwater also flows into the Lackawanna River via the creek and it is affected by fine sediment. There is one stormwater detention facility in the watershed, at Leggett's Creek Estates.|$|E

5|$|Jupiter {{has been}} called the Solar System's vacuum cleaner, because of its immense gravity well and {{location}} near the inner Solar System. It receives the most frequent comet impacts of the Solar System's planets. It was thought that the planet served to partially shield the inner system from cometary bombardment. However, recent computer simulations suggest that Jupiter <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>cause</b> a net {{decrease in the number of}} comets that pass through the inner Solar System, as its gravity perturbs their orbits inward roughly as often as it accretes or ejects them. This topic remains controversial among scientists, as some think it draws comets towards Earth from the Kuiper belt while others think that Jupiter protects Earth from the alleged Oort cloud. Jupiter experiences about 200 times more asteroid and comet impacts than Earth.|$|E
5|$|The {{potential}} impact of thiomersal on autism has been investigated extensively. Multiple lines of scientific evidence have shown that thiomersal <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>cause</b> autism. For example, the clinical symptoms of mercury poisoning differ significantly from those of autism. In addition, multiple population studies have found no association between thiomersal and autism, and rates of autism have continued to increase despite removal of thiomersal from vaccines. Thus, major scientific and medical bodies such as the Institute of Medicine and World Health Organization (WHO) as well as governmental {{agencies such as the}} Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the CDC reject any role for thiomersal in autism or other neurodevelopmental disorders. In spite of the consensus of the scientific community, some parents and advocacy groups continue to contend that thiomersal is linked to autism.|$|E
5|$|A {{receptor}} for tomato systemin {{was identified}} as a 160KDa leucine-rich repeat receptor like kinase (LRR-RLK), SR160. After being isolated it was found that was very similar in structure to BRI1 from A. thaliana, the receptor that brassinolides bind to on the cell membrane. This was the first receptor which was found to be able to bind both a steroid and a peptide ligand and also to be involved in both defensive and developmental responses. Recent studies have found that the initial conclusion that BRI1 is the receptor for tomato systemin may be incorrect. In cu3 mutants of tomato, a null allele with a stop codon present in the extracellular LRR domain of BRI1 prevents the receptor from being localised correctly and it also lacks the kinase domain, required for signalling. These mutants are insensitive to brassinolide yet still respond to tomato systemin by producing protease inhibitors and causing an alkalisation response. This led Holton et al. to suggest that there is another mechanism by which systemin is perceived. Further investigation showed that binding of systemin to BRI1 <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>cause</b> the receptor to become phosphorylated, as when brassinolides bind, suggesting that it does not transduce a signal. When BRI1 is silenced in tomato, the plants have a similar phenotype to cu3 mutants yet are still able to respond normally to systemin, strengthening the view that BRI1 is not the systemin receptor.|$|E

In the oral test used a maximum dose 5000 mg/kg and dermal testing used a maximum dose of 2000 mg/kg. Dose treatment and control tested to 5 Spraque Dawley male rats.
