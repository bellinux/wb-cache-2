For matters before juries or <b>judicial</b> <b>panels,</b> either set-wise or sequential voting can be employed to mitigate this problem, as all votes need not be cast in one instance.

40|$|This study {{examines}} judicial behavior under the dormant Commerce Clause doctrine by drawing on an original database of 459 state and Federal appellate cases decided between 1970 and 2009. The authors use logit regression {{to show that}} state judges {{are more likely to}} uphold state and local laws against dormant Commerce Clause attack than their Federal judicial counterparts, a result that is consistent with the interstate rivalry issues animating the doctrine. The study also finds that Republican-dominated <b>judicial</b> <b>panels</b> at the state level are more likely to side with tax challengers invoking the dormant Commerce Clause doctrine than are Democratic <b>judicial</b> <b>panels.</b> The authors found similar results on tax issues at the Federal level between the years 1993 and 2009. These results suggest that among more conservative judges, traditional anti-regulation attitudes may hold more sway than federalism and judicial restraint. These findings provide insight into the connections between forum selection, politics, and judicial behavior under the doctrine and open avenues for further research...|$|E

40|$|Legal {{remedies}} {{applied in}} the proceedings before the Court of Justice of the European Union have some distinctive features {{as compared to the}} legal remedies used in the national judicial systems. At first, the communitarian justice system originally did not envisage the possibility of filing an appeal with this Court as a regular legal remedy but there were other remedies that could be pursued in respect of the judgments issued by the Court. After the establishment of the Court of First Instance, the Procedural Law of the European Union introduced the possibility of filing an appeal with the Court of Justice against the judgments of the Court of First Instance. Later, the Court of First Instance became competent to decide on appeals against the judgments rendered by the <b>judicial</b> <b>panels,</b> which were established in the meantime. The Court of First Instance and <b>judicial</b> <b>panels</b> reserved the possibility of using other legal remedies against the final decisions rendered by these judicial authorities. In this respect, the Lisbon Treaty did not bring any significant changes, except that the Court of First Instance was renamed into the General Court whereas the <b>judicial</b> <b>panels</b> were designated as specialized courts. Taking into account the system of legal remedies recognized by the Procedural Law of the European Union, {{the first part of the}} paper deals with appeals as a regular legal instrument for bringing the case before a higher instance court which is to review the judgment of a lower instance court, including appeals against the decisions of the General Court and specialized courts. In the second part of the paper, the authors focus on the legal remedies which are awarded by the same court that issued the judgment. This category includes the application of a third party and revision, which may be considered as extraordinary legal remedies, as well as the objection against the judgment by default, judgment interpretation, judgment rectification and supplementing the judgment, which are considered to be extraordinary procedural remedies...|$|E
40|$|In {{the last}} fifteen years, a number of {{empirical}} studies of multi-member <b>judicial</b> <b>panels</b> have documented a phenomenon popularly known as "panel effects. " Two principal findings of this literature are: (1) the inclusion of even a single (non-pivotal) member from outside the dominant ideological on the panel can induce induces the panel to reverse "like minded" administrative agencies more frequently than would a panel dominated wholly by the majority ideology; and (2) when mixed panels do not reverse, they frequently issue unanimous decisions. These apparently moderating effects of mixed panel composition pose a challenge to conventional median voter theory. In {{the face of this}} challenge, many scholars have offered their own explanation for panel effects (including collegiality; deliberation, whistle-blowing, and others). In this paper, we propose a general model that (among other things) predicts panel effects as a byproduct of strategic information acquisition. The kernel of our argument is that (non-pivotal) minority members of mixed panels have incentives to engage in costly searches for information in cases where the majority members would rationally choose not to do so. As a result, the inclusion of minority members may induce greater information production in a way that increases the likelihood that a mixed panel will overturn ideologically allied agency actors. Our informational account [...] if true [...] has normative implications for the composition of <b>judicial</b> <b>panels</b> in particular, and for deliberative groups more generally...|$|E

40|$|An attorney’s {{ability to}} {{successfully}} litigate {{on behalf of}} their clients is of paramount importance. While women are entering the legal profession in larger numbers every year, they are less successful than their male counterparts. Coupled with reports of gender bias in the courtroom, female attorneys are seemingly at an automatic disadvantage. This raises questions about how equal justice under law is. In this early iteration of my senior thesis, I explore how attorney gender influences judicial decision-making at the U. S. Courts of Appeals utilizing data from 373 sex discrimination cases. I find female attorneys are less likely to succeed, unless they are arguing in front of a panel with at least one female judge. These results suggest that an attorney’s gender is an important component of judicial decision-making and the gendered composition of <b>judicial</b> <b>panels</b> and attorneys should become a part of future research on judicial behavior...|$|E
40|$|Recent {{empirical}} {{scholarship that}} shows that judges decide cases {{in a manner that}} is consistent with their political biases has motivated a stream of proposals for reform, including judicial term limits, limitations on judicial review of statutes and agency actions, revision of the judicial appointments process, and mandatory mixed party representation on <b>judicial</b> <b>panels.</b> However, these proposals incorrectly assume that judicial bias is necessarily harmful, and do not fully consider the costs to other values even when reduction of judicial bias is justified. To evaluate proposals for reform, one needs a theory of judicial review, one that explains how bias and other characteristics of judicial behavior result in socially good or bad outcomes. This paper supplies such a theory, drawing on rational-choice accounts of the role of the judiciary in the legislative process. It argues that judicial bias is not harmful in a broad range of circumstances, and that the merits of the reform proposals depend on many factors, including, among others, the degree of supermajoritarianism of the legislative process, the magnitude of legislative bargaining costs, judicial competence, and the extent to which the judicial appointments process and party competition result in an ideologically diverse judiciary...|$|E
40|$|Early in this nation’s history, {{the civil}} jury {{was the most}} {{important}} institutional check on biased and corrupt judges. Recently, concerns about judicial bias, especially in elected state judiciaries, have intensified as new studies demonstrate the extent of that bias. But the jury of Hamilton, Madison, and Jefferson is nowhere to be found. In fact, the civil jury is virtually dead. It is used in less than 1 % of all civil cases, and even when it makes a rare appearance, the jury’s powers have been significantly curtailed. This Article argues that we must reimagine the civil jury to match the framework of modern civil litigation and modern civil procedure. Civil litigation in the 21 st century revolves around pre-trial practice, including the motion to dismiss and the motion for summary judgment. Today, judges alone decide those dispositive motions. And when the judges deciding these motions are biased, the jury is conspicuously absent. I propose that jurors serve alongside judges to decide fact-intensive dispositive motions on what I call Hybrid <b>Judicial</b> <b>Panels.</b> This proposal restores the jury’s historical power to control biased judges, and offers the people themselves a renewed role in modern civil litigation...|$|E
