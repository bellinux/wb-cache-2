2500|$|The ocean can {{be divided}} into three density zones: the <b>surface</b> <b>zone,</b> the pycnocline, and the deep <b>zone.</b> The <b>surface</b> <b>zone,</b> also called the mixed layer, refers to the {{uppermost}} density zone of the ocean. Temperature and salinity are relatively constant with depth in this zone due to currents and wave action. The <b>surface</b> <b>zone</b> contains ocean water that is in contact with the atmosphere and within the photic <b>zone.</b> The <b>surface</b> <b>zone</b> has the ocean's least dense water and represents approximately 2% of the total volume of ocean water. The <b>surface</b> <b>zone</b> usually ranges between depths of [...] to [...] below ocean surface, but this can vary a great deal. In some cases, the <b>surface</b> <b>zone</b> can be entirely non-existent. The <b>surface</b> <b>zone</b> is typically thicker in the tropics than in regions of higher latitude. The transition to colder, denser water is more abrupt in the tropics than in regions of higher latitudes. The pycnocline refers to a zone wherein density substantially increases with depth due primarily to decreases in temperature. The pycnocline effectively separates the lower-density <b>surface</b> <b>zone</b> above from the higher-density deep zone below. The pycnocline represents approximately 18% of the total volume of ocean water. The deep zone refers to the lowermost density zone of the ocean. The deep zone usually begins at depths below [...] in mid-latitudes. The deep zone undergoes negligible changes in water density with depth. The deep zone represents approximately 80% of the total volume of ocean water. The deep zone contains relatively colder and stable water.|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{concerns}} {{the formation of}} tough <b>surface</b> <b>zones,</b> depleted of cubic carbo-nitrides, in cemented carbides. Several materials with varied phase compositions, binder phase volume fraction, and carbon content have been investigated. The main experimental techniques {{that have been used}} are scanning electron microscopy (SEM), electron probe microanalysis (EPMA), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and atom probe field ion microscopy (APFIM). Some of the experimental results have been compared to computer simulations based on thermodynamics and diffusion. Good agreement between computer simulations and experimental results of the distribution of elements and phases was found. It was therefore concluded that the formation of <b>surface</b> <b>zones</b> is a process controlled by thermodynamics and diffusion. It was investigated how the gradient <b>surface</b> <b>zone</b> formation depends on cubic phase composition. Addition of Ta to the cubic phase was found to decrease the elemental variations in the gradient profile and to give a thinner <b>surface</b> <b>zone.</b> Addition of Nb gave the opposite effect, with larger elemental variations and a wider <b>surface</b> <b>zone.</b> The effect of the binder phase volume fraction on gradient zone formation was studied. It was found that the zone width is directly proportional to the binder content. It was also found that the diffusivity is reduced with a factor equal to the binder volume fraction due to the presence of dispersed phases, i. e. carbides and carbo-nitrides. Study of materials with varied carbon content showed that with a high C content the driving force for gradient formation becomes stronger, and wider <b>surface</b> <b>zones</b> are formed. The effect of high C content was found to be reduced if Ta or Nb was added to the cubic phase. Methods to prepare APFIM specimens of near surface regions were developed. The methods are based on dimple grinding, electropolishing, and focused ion beam milling (FIB). The methods allow for positioning of APFIM specimens with high accuracy in the material, and to re-sharpen analysed specimens. Analysis was performed of the cubic phase just inside the zone border and the results could be related to the sintering process...|$|R
40|$|Although {{fractures}} in rock are well-recognized as pathways for fast percolation of water, {{the possibility that}} fast flow could occur along unsaturated fracture pathways is commonly not considered in vadose zone hydrology. In this study, two mechanisms for fast flow along unsaturated fractures were investigated, film flow and <b>surface</b> <b>zone</b> flow. The importance of fracture surface roughness was demonstrated through experiments conducted on ceramic blocks having simple surface topographies. Those experiments showed that film flow on fracture surfaces {{is largely due to}} flow along continuous surface channels which become water-filled at near-zero matric (capillary) potentials. The second mechanism, <b>surface</b> <b>zone</b> flow, is important when the permeability of the rock along fractures (fracture skin) is significantly greater than that of the bulk rock matrix. <b>Surface</b> <b>zone</b> fast flow was demonstrated through water imbibition (sorptivity) experiments.

The chloride ingress {{and the depth of}} carbonation of the <b>surface</b> <b>zone</b> of concrete cast against CPF and IF were investigated. The main mechanisms controlling the ECR processes and the factors affecting such treatment were critically reviewed. Subsequently, as a means of restoring passivation of steel embedded in carbonated concrete, such HCP specimens were subjected to ECR. The influence of ECR on the chemistry of the pore solution and the microstructure of the surface and the steel/cement past interface zones were also studied. The main findings of this investigation were as follows: (a) The thickness of the microstructure gradient of cover concrete is significantly decreased with increasing period of water curing but is relatively unaffected by curing temperature, w/e ratio and the use of cement replacement materials. (b) The scratch hardness technique was shown to be potentially useful for characterising the microstructure and microhardness gradients of the <b>surface</b> <b>zone.</b> (c) A relationship between the microstructure gradient and mass transport properties of the <b>surface</b> <b>zone</b> was established. (d) The use of CPF resulted in a significant reduction in porosity of both the cement paste matrix and the aggregate/cement paste transition zone, and a marked improvement in the resistance of the <b>surface</b> <b>zone</b> to carbonation and the ingress of chloride ions. (e) The ECR treatment resulted in a marked densification of the pore structure and in changes to the pore solution chemistry and the cement phases of near-surface and steel/cement paste transition zones.

40|$|Graduation date: 2017 This {{study was}} to develop and {{evaluate}} a shirt pattern for a wheelchair tennis player to improve comfort using reducing garment strain using a CAD program. For that, seven body movements related to garment strain during play were analyzed. In order to develop a pattern, a morphological matrix was used to generate a pattern design concept. In the morphological matrix, the tennis shirt patterns were deconstructed and each was named as function and each function had potential pattern making solutions, including the <b>surface</b> <b>zone</b> methods, structural lines development, and wearing eases development. The <b>surface</b> <b>zones</b> {{in the present study}} were calculated to explain the bodice subdivided zones to develop 2 D patterns that apply to each surface of the 3 D avatars. The structural lines utilized to adjust a tennis shirt block pattern in this study. Also, the wearing eases development was managed at the grade points of the pattern to provide ease by using the change of length. Based on the possible solutions, patterns were adjusted to meet the garment comfort aspect for each function of pattern on the 3 D avatars. In this study, 3 D body scanner was used to create 3 D avatars with postures based on the determined body movements. The drafted pattern was used to drape the virtual garments on the each movement of 3 D avatars in the CAD program, and then the stain areas of the pattern design were identified using the tension map. In all of the movements, the majority of garment strain appeared on the shoulder surface and around the neck as the bodice shoulder angle function. The majority of other strain found was on the shoulder blade as the bodice bust function during movements in the forehand swing, backhand swing, serve toss, and serve follow through postures. The first pattern was developed to release garment strain on the shoulder <b>surface</b> <b>zones</b> as the shoulder structural line was spread in a parallel way and the shoulder point was expanded. Since the strain was decreased significantly in both forehand movements on the shoulder <b>surface</b> <b>zone,</b> the first pattern can be effectively applied to the bodice shoulder angle function. The second pattern was constructed to release the other maximized strain on the back <b>surface</b> <b>zone</b> of the shoulder blade. The result of the second pattern was shown that the strain relatively decreased with forehand swing, backhand swing, serve toss, and serve follow through postures. Based on the results of this study, it should be noted that the shoulder and the shoulder blade areas are important during development of patterns, in terms of decreasing strain for comfort during movements. Also, for the wheelchair users during play, the movements affecting the shoulder blade, such as back swing posture and serve toss posture, are more effective for reducing strain...|$|R

40|$|Articular {{cartilage}} is a resilient {{and load}} bearing material that provides diarthrodial joints with excellent friction, lubrication and wear characteristics required for continuous motion. However, articular cartilage has a poor regenerative capacity and its degeneration {{is a common}} cause of morbidity in terms of loss of joint function and osteoarthritis, frequently resulting in the need for total knee replacement. Articular cartilage has a distinct zonal architecture with biochemical and cellular variations existing from the <b>surface</b> <b>zone</b> to the deeper calcified layers. Thus, {{the development of the}} tissue must be stringently controlled, both spatially and temporally in order for the complex structure to be established. Importantly, the <b>surface</b> <b>zone</b> is believed to be responsible for the appositional growth of articular cartilage during development and this growth is believed to be driven by a population of slow cycling progenitor cells within the <b>surface</b> <b>zone</b> itself. The focus of this thesis is the isolation and characterisation of articular cartilage progenitor cells together with an exploration of the cells capabilities in potential cartilage repair therapies. The cells were identified on the basis of differential adhesion assays and colony forming ability.

In terms of the potential of the cells for use in tissue engineering, a promising feature of the cells is the discovery that enriched populations of the cells can undergo extensive expansion in simple monolayer cultures and yet retain their ability to undergo chondrogenic differentiation.

Articular cartilage from the <b>surface</b> <b>zone</b> of the femur was tested in an isometric tensile test and full-thickness cartilage on the tibial plateau was tested in a compressive indentation test. Water, proteoglycan and collagen contents were measured in site-matched samples. Site-specific increases in the tensile moduli (∼ 88 % above control values in distal femoral groove) were observed in cartilage after 8 weeks of joint disuse, and after 3 weeks of remobilization following either 4 (∼ 140 %, distal femoral groove) of joint disuse. In contrast, the compressive properties of cartilage determined in the indentation test exhibited no change from control values with joint disuse or disuse followed by remobilization. Water contents increased at some sites on the tibia after 8 weeks of joint disuse (∼ 6 % of tissue wet weight, posterior site), {{but not in the}} <b>surface</b> <b>zone</b> tissue of the femur. Proteoglycan/collagen and cartilage thickness were not found to change with disuse or disuse followed by remobilization. Reduced values for the ratio of proteoglycan:water were observed in the <b>surface</b> <b>zone</b> tissue of the femur (∼ 23 %, distal femoral groove) and in the full-thickness tissue of the tibia (∼ 21 %, anterior and posterior sites) after periods of joint disuse. In this study, the measured material properties suggest that the articular surface remains intact following periods of disuse or disuse with remobilization. This finding suggests one important difference between this model of joint disuse and other experimental models in which cartilage changes are both progressive and degenerative, such as surgically-induced joint instability...|$|R
30|$|The {{difference}} spectrum after PGA adsorption {{reveals a}} certain loss of CS chains either due to desorption of soluble PLL-CS complexes {{or through the}} substitution of CS chains by PGA. The fact that CS chains are not completely removed from the multilayer {{may be explained by}} the structural model that Abdelkebir et al. [13] recently proposed for (PLL-CS)n multilayers. This type of PEM film is proposed to consist of a loosely assembled <b>surface</b> <b>zone</b> and a densely packed (ionically cross-linked) zone in proximity to the substrate interface. The extent of hydration of the loose <b>surface</b> <b>zone</b> is sufficiently high, that the CS chains may be more prone to a replacement with PGA chains and/or film erosion via the formation of soluble polyelectrolyte complexes (PECs). The CS chains in the deeper zone, which is proposed to display a dense network of ionic cross-links, may be less susceptible to substitution via detachment processes. The CS chains that remain tightly bound to the PLL molecules in the dense zone are postulated to account for the sugar and sulfate vibrations in the IR spectrum of the (PLL-CS) 5 -(PLL-PGA) 5 mixed multilayers.|$|R
