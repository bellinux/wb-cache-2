50|$|Weeroona, {{previously}} car 501, {{was sold}} in 1989 and re-entered service in 1993 with an end <b>deck,</b> <b>kitchen</b> and dining facilities, and only three compartments retained. It was named Terra Australis and coded TA501. By 1994 the vehicle had been repainted into blue with gold stripes and a white roof, with the new identity Terror Australis.|$|E
50|$|The {{residence}} halls are a smoke-free {{environment and}} disability accessible. Activity areas include aerobic rooms, music practice rooms, multipurpose rooms, billiard and ping pong areas, several television lounges, outside <b>decks,</b> <b>kitchens,</b> and cafes. All of our residence halls are secured 24 hours with a security guard. There are common areas where students can either study or rest along with friends. If a student need anything, he/she {{can go to}} the reception desk and ask a Resident Assistant for help.|$|R
50|$|The {{noticeable}} difference over previous (0 {{series and}} 200 series) shinkansen designs was {{the inclusion of}} two bilevel trailer cars in {{the centre of the}} formation. The type 168 car had a restaurant area on the upper <b>deck</b> with <b>kitchen</b> facilities and a small buffet counter on the lower deck. The adjacent type 149 car provided private compartments for Green class passengers on the lower deck, with open-plan green car accommodation on the upper deck.|$|R
50|$|The rooftop Sky Decks include {{infinity}} edge swimming pools, hot tubs, sun <b>decks</b> {{and summer}} <b>kitchens.</b> Resident fitness and locker rooms, billiards rooms and lounges {{are on the}} 37th floor. A private residential driveway leads to separate vehicle entrances, secured elevators and valet service, all monitored by 24-hour security.|$|R
5000|$|The {{property}} {{is considered a}} [...] "classic" [...] Kentucky farmstead and is located 13 miles east of downtown Louisville. The house has five bedrooms, six bathrooms, a library of women's literature and reference works, a large living room/dining area, a sun room, and a <b>deck.</b> The large <b>kitchen</b> is fully furnished and well equipped so that residents can prepare their own meals. Separate studio space for artists is available upon request.|$|R
50|$|Over 150 safety {{criteria}} {{have been}} adopted in Germany and Australia for specific situations — swimming pool <b>decks,</b> commercial <b>kitchens,</b> restrooms, etc. These {{are based on a}} laboratory test device, the variable-angleramp, that is not readily portable. The pendulum tester is a portable ASTM method, has been used successfully since at least 1971 for assessing pedestrian traction potential, and is a national standard for pedestrian traction in 48 nations on four continents. Abrasion of a flooring sample, tested with the pendulum before and after, is being used to assess “Sustainable Slip Resistance.” Some architects and property owners are now combining this pendulum-based test with situation-specific safety criteria to specify and verify safe flooring. If flooring is in an area where it can get wet or otherwise lubricated (airborne deep-fryer fat, automobile grease, etc.), it needs to be slip-resistant under such conditions.|$|R
50|$|Over 150 safety {{criteria}} {{have been}} adopted in Germany and Australia for specific situations — swimming pool <b>decks,</b> commercial <b>kitchens,</b> restrooms, etc. based on the variable-angle ramp, but the ramp itself is not readily portable, so this instrument is only for lab testing and is therefore quite limited in its utility. In other words, you can't test your specific floor tiles using this method without ripping part of your floor up and putting it into the ramp tester. However, since it is measuring real human ambulation, it {{is considered by many}} to be the most realistic test method in existence, and the results of pendulum and drag-sled meter tests are sometimes compared with results from variable-angle ramp tests to see if the results have a strong correlation. A good correlation with ramp test results can help a slip resistance test device become more widely used and accepted.|$|R
50|$|The complex, {{which has}} a built area of 5,850 square metres and a total area of 244,460 square metres, {{includes}} four official size football pitches, a first-class hotel for first-squad players and youth academy with 20 suites, gaming room, restaurant, auditorium, panoramic <b>deck</b> and industrial <b>kitchen,</b> phisiology room, medical and dentistry departments, climatized lockrooms with hydrotherapy tubs, gym, spa pools, ice tank, 7-a-side football pitch and laundry room. The Press Room has a view to the main training pitch and includes multimedia resources and infrastructure for media professionals.|$|R
50|$|Green Deck is {{the fourth}} deck from the waterline. Forward are Cabins 3000-3090. These cabins are either Premier or Club cabins {{and most of them}} were added in the 2002 refit. Further aft are the children's {{playroom}} and the quiet room. Around this area is the main elevators and stairway, which has golden handrails, mirrors and marble flooring. At the stern of this <b>deck</b> is the <b>Kitchen</b> restaurant and the Brasserie restaurant that is decorated with many P&O Pictures of old ships such as Canberra and Arcadia. The aftermost part of this deck is a small promenade section for people eating in the kitchen.|$|R
5000|$|In the lighthouse, {{the first}} <b>deck</b> housed a <b>kitchen</b> with a cook stove and {{also was a}} living area. The next two decks were {{sleeping}} quarters. The second deck was for the assistants, the third deck for the keeper. The fourth deck {{was used as a}} workroom and fifth was the watch room at the balcony level. The lantern room is located at the top on the sixth deck. This housed the original Fresnel lens, made by Barbier & Fenstre in Paris in 1884, which is now on display at the Grice House and Museum in Harbor Beach. Next to the Harbor Beach lighthouse was a small wooden building, which contained equipment to operate the fog signal (see undated USCG photo above), but was removed when the light was automated. [...] There is a diaphone in place.|$|R
5000|$|In 2015, JBG renovated floors 3-8 of the Wardman Tower into 32 luxury condominiums. The {{first and}} second floors remain part of the hotel. The condos are {{separate}} from the hotel and do not share an entrance or connecting interior passageways. The shape of the structure—a circular core structure with four equidistant projecting wings—led the architects, ACG Architects and interior designer, Deborah Berke Partners, to create an entry hall, narrow long gallery (off {{of which is a}} toilet as well as a guest bedroom with full bath), and wide gallery (off of which is a guest bedroom and a master bedroom, each with full bath) which led to the kitchen, living room, and dining room {{at the end of each}} wing. Six two-bedroom, three-bath, 2600 sq ft condominiums are on the first four floors, while the two upper floors have four four-bedroom, four-bath, 4800 sq ft condominiums each. A four-bedroom, four-bath, 4800 sq ft penthouse condominium occupies the roof, and has access to a private terrace. The building also includes a rooftop <b>deck</b> with outdoor <b>kitchen</b> for use by all residents, a fitness center, a library/lounge, private garden, private storage units, two entertainment rooms, a catering kitchen, and 64 parking spaces.|$|R
50|$|The Dunes Club {{consists}} of a main clubhouse, which includes a gift shop, formal dining hall with a stage and dance floor, indoor/outdoor formal bar, tea room used for small formal events, casual restaurant with <b>deck</b> dining, restrooms, <b>kitchens</b> and staff offices and living quarters. From the north side entrance of the clubhouse or {{through the parking lot}} is access to a casual snack bar offering lunch foods as well as ice cream, an outdoor snack bar, a casual outdoor food service, deck, pool, children's pool and two bars. Further down are the member bathhouses, which are small units for storing chairs and umbrellas, and the headquarters of the bathhouse boys, the staff who carry chairs and umbrellas for members. Located in proximity to the beach is the first aid center, where medical supplies are stored, and the children's camp, a day camp for those ages 4 and older. Further down and closer to Narrow River are member cabanas. These are small rooms with ground-level porches that have chairs and tables for relaxation and dining as well as storage for chairs, umbrellas and surfboards. These are staffed by two cabana stations, and cabana owners have access to a special cabana menu that changes daily. Bordering the parking lot and Narrow River, respectively, are four clay tennis courts and four asphalt tennis courts. Adjoining the asphalt courts is the pro shop, which sells rackets, balls, and other tennis equipment to members. A tennis pro and multiple instructors are employed each summer to offer private lessons, group clinics, and day camps for children.|$|R
