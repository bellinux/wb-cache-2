These columns tilted outwards from a vertical position. <b>Floor</b> <b>to</b> <b>ceiling</b> glazing on the second storey opened out onto a balcony running {{the length of the}} building. It included technical innovations from America including acoustic ceiling tiles, underfloor electricity ducts and fluorescent lighting.|$|E
5|$|The {{original}} hotel tower had 680 rooms, {{and each}} featured {{a room with}} one wall which was fully mirrored from <b>floor</b> <b>to</b> <b>ceiling.</b> The hotel featured an 800-seat theatre restaurant and three public dining areas, two health clubs, an epicurean room, a convention hall of up to 2000 people and 20 separate halls and committee rooms, accommodating up to 5000 people in total. Marble was imported from Italy, rosewood from Brazil, with gold leafing throughout the place.|$|E
25|$|The new {{terminal}} and concourses {{completed in the}} 2010s terminal modernization feature open spaces and clean lines. There is abundant natural light from <b>floor</b> <b>to</b> <b>ceiling</b> windows and large skylights. Neutral colors accented with soft blue and chrome are found throughout the terminal.|$|E

50|$|In June 2010, O’Dowd {{successfully}} completed a three-year, $9 million comprehensive fundraising campaign and funds raised were split about evenly between capital development and program enhancement. Funds contributed to renovation of many {{elements of the}} classroom buildings — from <b>floors</b> <b>to</b> <b>ceilings,</b> interior and exterior, every classroom, lab and locker, from ventilation to technology infrastructure.|$|R
25|$|In 1931, Chola frescoes were {{discovered}} within the circumambulatory corridor of the Brihadisvara Temple, by S.K.Govindasamy, {{a professor at}} the Annamalai University. These are the first Chola paintings discovered. The passage of the corridor is dark and the walls on either side are covered with two layers of paintings from <b>floor</b> <b>to</b> <b>ceiling.</b>|$|E
25|$|The spatial diagram {{created by}} TtEias (1979) {{is very similar}} to the sense of space and {{movement}} created in her earlier Tecelares series woodprints. Like Tecelares, the lines of TtEias (1979)are made with simple materials, include geometric shapes, and create movement through the intersection of lines and the creation of space. So too, there is a human element in the use of materials and the production of the work, in which each thread is pulled taut from <b>floor</b> <b>to</b> <b>ceiling</b> by hand.|$|E
25|$|The three-storey {{building}} had <b>floor</b> <b>to</b> <b>ceiling</b> windows, an advanced innovation. Its cast-iron frontispieces where manufactured in Baltimore and shipped around Cape Horn. (The bank subsequently {{moved into a}} new bank building built by H.W. Corbett. The present First National Bank Building at 401–409 SW 5th Avenue, designed by Coolidge and Shattuck of Boston, resembling some of the Lincoln memorial classicism, was built in 1916 when the bank outgrew those later quarters and when it was subsequently under the ownership of H.W.Corbett’s grandsons).|$|E
50|$|The {{auditorium}} has 1,142 {{seats and}} {{a height of}} 18 m from the <b>floor</b> <b>to</b> the <b>ceiling.</b> It has seen performances being conducted by Hans Pfitzner, Wilhelm Furtwängler, Otto Klemperer and George Szell.|$|R

25|$|A Casa de Jantar da Rainha (Queen's Dining Room), {{a private}} {{dining room was}} never planned in the 1802 design of the Palace, but by 1880 {{there was a need}} for a {{communal}} space. The final room was decorated in red silk and rich wood grain trim from <b>floor</b> <b>to</b> <b>ceiling,</b> with a wood fireplace/stove on one wall (surmounted by a large mirror), while the opposite wall provides an entrance to adjacent Billiard Room. The floor is cover in inlaid parquet floor with a bronze lustre.|$|E
25|$|The City of San Mateo {{operates}} three libraries {{within the}} city. The Main Library, the Hillsdale Library, and the Marina Library {{are all part}} of the Peninsula Library System. The Main Library located near Central Park in downtown opened in 2006 after residents passed a $30 million bond measure. Upon opening, the three story 93,000 square foot building earned numerous design awards and was LEED certified NC Gold. Windows from <b>floor</b> <b>to</b> <b>ceiling</b> provide abundant natural light inside. It is modeled after a retail bookstore and is technologically advanced.|$|E
25|$|Circles and squares {{form the}} unifying theme of the {{interior}} design. The checkerboard floor pattern contrasts with the concentric circles of square coffers in the dome. Each zone of the interior, from <b>floor</b> <b>to</b> <b>ceiling,</b> is subdivided according to a different scheme. As a result, the interior decorative zones do not line up. The overall effect is immediate viewer orientation according to the major axis of the building, even though the cylindrical space topped by a hemispherical dome is inherently ambiguous. This discordance {{has not always been}} appreciated, and the attic level was redone according to Neoclassical taste in the 18th century.|$|E
30|$|The camera height relates <b>to</b> the <b>ceiling</b> height. This {{dimension}} is measured from the <b>floor</b> elevation <b>to</b> the <b>ceiling</b> elevation. The corresponding parameter of the Revit camera is “eye elevation”.|$|R
50|$|One day, Lila {{pretends to}} be a {{potential}} buyer {{of the house and}} lets Carl take her on a tour. In the bedroom, she tries to seduce Carl, but he hears David hiding in the bathroom. She quickly slashes his throat and orders David to clean up the body before the blood soaks through the <b>floor</b> <b>to</b> the <b>ceiling</b> in the living room.|$|R
60|$|On returning, Yellow Elk at once {{set to work}} to rig up {{an upright}} pole from the <b>floor</b> <b>to</b> the <b>ceiling</b> of the cave, using a heavy tree branch for the purpose. The upright was placed close to where {{the smoke from the}} fire found a vent through several large cracks in the ceiling, and the boomer watched these {{proceedings}} with much alarm.|$|R
25|$|Visual {{interventions}} {{within the}} buildings allow constant interaction between patrons {{and the outer}} environment. From <b>floor</b> <b>to</b> <b>ceiling</b> expansive windows in the pool area to the spiraling staircase with windows opening into the park, the building offers patrons different perspectives of environment outside. Regardless of the season, athletes can enjoy physical recreation and the outdoor environment. The building’s main façade is cloaked in a single concrete matrix of different aggregates used to form the mixture of surfaces within each section. Tucked between the concrete matrix are multicolored glass tiles reminiscent of the glimmering colors of water. These apertures, which are sprinkled along the building’s façade, cast varying shadows on the interior.|$|E
25|$|Of all of Pape's works, TtEias (1979) {{is perhaps}} most emblematic of her artistic process. The TtEias was first {{conceived}} in 1979, {{but it was not}} until the 1990s that it was produced in full scale. The artwork consists of nine semi-transparent prisms, which were created using gold thread. A square platform drilled with nails serves as the base of each prism. The gold thread is then wrapped around each protruding nail, from <b>floor</b> <b>to</b> <b>ceiling,</b> to create the prism. Light is shined onto the prisms at various angles, emphasizing the metallic sheen of the thread. The exhibition space is otherwise dark, giving the allusion that the prisms continue infinitely upwards.|$|E
25|$|The pier {{today is}} an open structure, with modern {{railings}} on an older base and a deck made of hardwood slats, affording a partial view of the sea below. Along the walkway are name plaques that local people funded to help towards raising the restoration funds. The modern pavilion structure at the pier head was designed by Liverpool architects Shed KM and cost £1.2 million; the building houses a cafeteria with airport style <b>floor</b> <b>to</b> <b>ceiling</b> windows overlooking the beach {{and a collection of}} vintage mechanical amusement machines and penny arcade. The exhibition of Edwardian and Victorian machines operates on pre-decimalisation pennies, available to purchase on-site at £1 for 10 old pennies.|$|E
60|$|The {{tiers of}} {{horseshoe}} benches {{rising from the}} <b>floor</b> <b>to</b> the <b>ceiling</b> were already packed, and the novice as he entered saw vague curving lines of faces in front of him, and heard the deep buzz of a hundred voices, and sounds of laughter from somewhere up above him. His companion spied an opening on the second bench, and they both squeezed into it.|$|R
50|$|Several statues {{surround}} the main temple building and a giant, colourful t'aenghwa (scroll painting) hangs behind the main image, depicting a Buddhist pantheon. The main image deified {{on a wooden}} altar is very tall, covering the entire height from <b>floor</b> <b>to</b> the <b>ceiling.</b> There is also {{a portrait of the}} guardian general of Buddhism, Wit'a on one of the side walls, which is akin to 16th century portraits found in China.|$|R
50|$|Firefighters usually remain {{above the}} ground floor of fire {{stations}} until they receive a call for help, after which they descend, don their firefighting gear, and board the fire engine as quickly as possible. Until 1878, spiral staircases or sliding chutes were common, but not particularly fast. Fire houses were also equipped with spiral staircases so the horses would not try to climb the stairs into the living quarters. The fireman's pole allows firefighters to move down much more quickly, although it is not suitable for climbing up. The pole connects the ground <b>floor</b> <b>to</b> the <b>ceiling</b> of the floor above {{through a hole in the}} ground <b>floor</b> <b>ceiling.</b> <b>To</b> use a pole, a firefighter puts their arms around it, steps into the hole, and uses their legs to control the speed of the descent, somewhat similarly to the technique used for fast-roping.|$|R
25|$|The {{ground floor}} {{consists}} of one open space with access {{provided by a}} series of recent aluminium-framed doors with fixed glass panels in between. Stairs lead up to the first floor {{at each end of the}} building. These stairs incorporate heavy timber treads and fine steel sections, which run vertically from <b>floor</b> <b>to</b> <b>ceiling</b> and act as a screen and a support for the balustrade. The end of one of the staircases is expressed to form a decorative zigzag pattern. The first floor ceiling lining follows the zigzag line of the roof, exposing the steel roof structure. This floor contains the original steel framed hopper windows and fixed glass panels along the south wall. The flooring is of mixed hardwood. An elevated link joins this building to the neighbouring Commerce Building and Meat Hall.|$|E
25|$|The 1974 {{terminal}} {{was built}} in the International style of architecture popular for American commercial and institutional buildings from the 1950s through the late 1970s. It consists of a single curved terminal with concourses radiating outward. Large <b>floor</b> <b>to</b> <b>ceiling</b> plate glass windows form curtain walls on the departure level of the terminal with horizontal bands of repetitive white architectural panels above and below. A slight departure from typical International style, the upper band of panels was decorated with raised circles of four sizes, two circles per size per panel. The roof is flat over the terminal and concourses; a series of steel columns painted white with stay cables for the terminal awning project from the roof. An enclosed white-clad Observation Deck jutted out from the airside terminal face at a sharp angle between the old concourses B and C. On the airside of the terminal, a large horizontal white sign with teal lettering identified the city as Birmingham.|$|E
25|$|Although Kent {{intended}} the First Lord {{to use this}} space as his study, it has rarely served that purpose; it has almost always been the Cabinet room. There {{have been a few}} exceptions. Stanley Baldwin used the Cabinet Room as his office. A few Prime Ministers, such as Tony Blair, occasionally worked at the Cabinet Room table. Painted off-white with large <b>floor</b> <b>to</b> <b>ceiling</b> windows along one of the long walls, the room is light and airy. Three brass chandeliers hang from the high ceiling. The Cabinet table, purchased during the Gladstone era, dominates the room. The modern boat-shaped top, introduced by Harold Macmillan in the late 1950s, is supported by huge original oak legs. The table is surrounded by carved, solid mahogany chairs that also date from the Gladstone era. The Prime Minister's chair, the only one with arms, is situated midway along one side in front of the marble fireplace, facing the windows; when not in use, it is positioned at an angle for easy access. The only picture in the room is a copy of a portrait of Sir Robert Walpole by Jean-Baptiste van Loo hanging over the fireplace. Each Cabinet member is allocated a chair based on order of seniority. Blotters inscribed with their titles mark their places.|$|E
25|$|The International jetty, also {{accessible}} via {{the security}} checkpoint A, {{is dedicated to}} flights with destinations outside Canada and United States. This jetty holds 18 gates: 50 through 53 and 55 through 68. Gates 53 and 62 are used exclusively for Passenger Transfer Vehicles. In this area, travellers can shop, eat and relax with a wide varieties of boutiques, restaurants, cafés {{and one of the}} biggest airport duty-free shops in Canada. There is also a Balnea SPA branch which offers travelers various spa facilities. At {{the far end of the}} jetty, there is a wide open space with a lot of natural lights through <b>floor</b> <b>to</b> <b>ceilings</b> windows and a big skylight in the rooftop. The masterpiece of the jetty is a work of art, called Veil of Glass, composed of different coloured glass triangles illuminated by spotlights, created by local artist ATOMIC3. Several murals and other works of art are also located in this jetty, including four from various Montréal museums.|$|R
50|$|Nymphaea were {{important}} in the architectural movement of mosaic from <b>floor</b> <b>to</b> walls and <b>ceiling</b> vaults in the 1st century. Initially they were often decorated with geometrical mosaics often incorporating shells, {{but by the end}} of the century could contain ambitious figure subjects.|$|R
50|$|Alexander tells an {{interesting}} tale of {{an incident that}} took place after the performance. He was playing billiards at the saloon with the attaché of the court when he noticed the Czar was also playing there. Herrmann shot the ball {{with all of his}} strength against a plate-glass mirror that extended from the <b>floor</b> <b>to</b> the <b>ceiling.</b> It shattered into fifty pieces. Every person in the room was horrified, none more than Herrmann.|$|R
500|$|The college {{opened a}} $2 million, [...] fitness center in February 2009. The {{addition}} to Carr is a three-story glass center, with <b>floor</b> <b>to</b> <b>ceiling</b> windows overlooking the baseball and football fields, constructed {{on the south}} side of the building. The additions brought 37 cardiovascular machines, 39 strength pieces and 7,000 pounds of weights. Connecting to the addition are three indoor basketball/tennis courts equipped with scoreboards and a sound system. The basement of Carr has the varsity gym, football locker room, general locker rooms and administrative offices for the athletic department. In 2012, the college spent 1.3 million dollars by installing a synthetic turf field at Grappone Stadium, and added lights for nighttime practice.|$|E
500|$|In March 1904 {{a three-day}} festival of Elgar's works was {{presented}} at Covent Garden, an honour never before given to any English composer. The Times commented, [...] "Four {{or five years ago}} if any one had predicted that the Opera-house would be full from <b>floor</b> <b>to</b> <b>ceiling</b> for the performance of an oratorio by an English composer he would probably have been supposed to be out of his mind." [...] The king and queen attended the first concert, at which Richter conducted The Dream of Gerontius, and returned the next evening for the second, the London premiere of The Apostles (first heard the previous year at the Birmingham Festival). The final concert of the festival, conducted by Elgar, was primarily orchestral, apart for an excerpt from Caractacus and the complete Sea Pictures (sung by Clara Butt). The orchestral items were Froissart, the Enigma Variations, Cockaigne, the first two (at that time the only two) Pomp and Circumstance marches, and the premiere of a new orchestral work, In the South, inspired by a holiday in Italy.|$|E
500|$|Inside the house, the Palladian form {{reaches a}} height and {{grandeur}} seldom seen {{in any other}} house in England. It has, in fact, been described as [...] "The finest Palladian interior in England." [...] The grandeur of the interior is obtained with an absence of excessive ornament, and reflects Kent's career-long taste for [...] "the eloquence of a plain surface". Work on the interiors ran from 1739 to 1773. The first habitable rooms were in the family wing and were in use from 1740, the Long Library being the first major interior completed in 1741. Among the last to be completed and entirely under Lady Leicester's supervision is the Chapel with its alabaster reredos. The house is entered through the Marble Hall (though the chief building fabric is in fact pink Derbyshire alabaster), modelled by Kent on a Roman basilica. The room is over 50feet (15m) from <b>floor</b> <b>to</b> <b>ceiling</b> and {{is dominated by the}} broad white marble flight of steps leading to the surrounding gallery, or peristyle: here alabaster Ionic columns support the coffered, gilded ceiling, copied from a design by Inigo Jones, inspired by the Pantheon in Rome. The fluted columns are thought to be replicas of those in the Temple of Fortuna Virilis, also in Rome. Around the hall are statues in niches; these are predominantly plaster copies of classical deities.|$|E
50|$|The {{principal}} {{rooms have}} windows rising {{almost from the}} <b>floor</b> <b>to</b> the <b>ceiling.</b> The rooms are large and well proportioned without suffering from the oppressive grandeur {{that was to be}} a feature of Vanbrugh and Hawksmoor's later collaborative work. The massive main staircase, with its wrought iron balustrade in the style of Jean Tijou, comprises two long, shallow flights ascending <b>to</b> the first <b>floor</b> gallery which is decorated with grisailles painted by Sir James Thornhill.|$|R
