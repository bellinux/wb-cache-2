25|$|The {{popularity}} of the Selectric mechanism caused computer manufacturers such as Digital Equipment to support the 134.5 baud data rate on their serial computer interfaces, enabling connection of IBM Type 2741 terminals. The 2741 was available with two different seven-bit codes (Correspondence and PTT/BCD). Code choice affected the font elements which could be used. The host computer had to translate the 2741 code into the host’s <b>internal</b> <b>code</b> (usually ASCII or EBCDIC). Dedicated hardware was also built to drive Selectric printers at 134.5 baud.|$|E

The Manhattan Project would deliver full-sized mockups {{of the weapons}} shapes to Wright Field by mid-December, where Army Air Forces Materiel Command would modify an aircraft and deliver it for use in bomb flight testing at Muroc Army Air Field in California. B-29-5-BW 42-6259 (referred to as the [...] "Pullman airplane" [...] from an <b>internal</b> <b>code</b> name assigned it by the Engineering Division of Army Air Forces Materiel Command) was delivered to the 468th Bombardment Group at Smoky Hill AAB, Kansas, on 30 November 1943, and flown to Wright Field on 2 December.|$|E
500|$|More {{than five}} {{years prior to the}} release of Super Mario 64, {{producer}} and director Shigeru Miyamoto conceived a 3D Mario design, while also working on the SNES game Star Fox, developed by Nintendo along with Argonaut Software. He considered using the Super FX chip to develop a SNES game which would have been called Super Mario FX, with gameplay based on [...] "an entire world in miniature, like miniature trains". Instead, he eventually reformulated the 3D Mario idea for the Nintendo 64—not due to the next generation console's substantially greater power, but because its controller has more buttons for gameplay. According to former Argonaut engineer Dylan Cuthbert, no game titled Super Mario FX had ever entered development, but rather [...] "Super Mario FX" [...] was the <b>internal</b> <b>code</b> name of the Super FX chip itself. According to Argonaut founder Jez San, Super Mario 64 was influenced by a prototype of a cancelled Argonaut game starring the Mario character Yoshi, which later became the 1997 platform game [...]|$|E

They had a capacity of approximately 871kB each, but proved unreliable and required special diskettes. The Macintosh, which was intended to implement a single Twiggy drive partway through development, was revised to use a Sony 400kB microfloppy drive. An optional external 5MB or, later, a 10MB Apple ProFile hard drive (originally designed for the Apple III) was available. With {{the introduction of the}} Lisa 2/10, an optional 10MB internal proprietary hard disk manufactured by Apple, known as the [...] "Widget", was also offered.|$|E
2500|$|An {{example of}} such an attack on disk {{encryption}} is the [...] "Evil Maid Attack", in which an attacker installs a bootkit on an unattended computer, replacing the legitimate boot loader with one under their control. Typically the malware loader persists through the transition to protected mode when the kernel has loaded, and is thus able to subvert the kernel. For example, the [...] "Stoned Bootkit" [...] subverts the system by using a compromised boot loader to intercept encryption keys and passwords. More recently, the Alureon rootkit has successfully subverted the requirement for 64-bit kernel-mode driver signing in Windows 7 by modifying the master boot record. Although not malware {{in the sense of}} doing something the user doesn't want, certain [...] "Vista Loader" [...] or [...] "Windows Loader" [...] software works in a similar way by injecting an ACPI SLIC (System Licensed <b>Internal</b> <b>Code)</b> table in the RAM-cached version of the BIOS during boot, in order to defeat the Windows Vista and Windows 7 activation process. This vector of attack was rendered useless in the (non-server) versions of Windows 8, which use a unique, machine-specific key for each system, that can only be used by that one machine. Many antivirus companies provide free utilities and programs to remove bootkits.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>Internal</b> Revenue <b>Code</b> of 1954 {{was enacted}} {{in the form}} of a {{separate}} code by act of August 16, 1954, ch. 736, [...] The Tax Reform Act of 1986 changed the name of the 1954 Code to the [...] "Internal Revenue Code of 1986". In addition to being published in various volumes of the United States Statutes at Large, the <b>Internal</b> Revenue <b>Code</b> is separately published as Title 26 of the United States Code. The text of the <b>Internal</b> Revenue <b>Code</b> as published in title 26 of the U.S. Code is virtually identical to the <b>Internal</b> Revenue <b>Code</b> as published in the various volumes of the United States Statutes at Large. Of the 50 enacted titles, the <b>Internal</b> Revenue <b>Code</b> is the only volume that has been published {{in the form of}} a separate code.|$|R

50|$|Section 1 of the <b>Internal</b> Revenue <b>Code</b> imposes {{the federal}} income tax on the taxable income of U.S. {{citizens}} and residents, and of estates and trusts. The corporate income tax is imposed by <b>Internal</b> Revenue <b>Code</b> section 11.|$|R
50|$|On any {{computer}} system, the <b>internal</b> <b>code</b> is {{the native}} encoding being used. For example, in a Big5-based system (e.g., Microsoft Windows 3.1 localized for traditional Chinese), the <b>internal</b> <b>code</b> is Big5; similarly, in a GB-based system (e.g., DOS running CCDOS), the <b>internal</b> <b>code</b> would be GB2312. On many modern operating systems (such as all modern Microsoft Windows systems), the <b>internal</b> <b>code</b> {{is a form}} of Unicode.|$|E
5000|$|Within a {{particular}} encoding, the <b>internal</b> <b>code</b> {{of a certain}} character simply means {{the value of the}} code point used to represent that character. For example, in the Big5 encoding, the character [...] "一" [...] (Chinese, lit. one) has the <b>internal</b> <b>code</b> of A440 (hexadecimal); in the GB encoding, the same character has the <b>internal</b> <b>code</b> of D2BB.|$|E

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{evaluate}} issues of different scripts in the same record (in MARC 21 and Chinese machine-readable cataloguing (CMARC)) and Chinese <b>internal</b> <b>codes</b> (i. e. double-byte character set) when implementing Koha. It also discusses successful efforts in promoting the adoption of Koha in Taiwan, particularly the contributions from Koha-Taiwan. Design/methodology/approach – A Koha CMARC/MARC 21 testbed was set up to discuss issues of multi-scripts and Chinese <b>internal</b> <b>codes</b> when implementing Koha, and to determine to what extent the various features of CMARC, which are not present in MARC 21, such as linking fields, can be supported in Koha and what is required to implement them if they are not available. Findings – In contrast to western characters, Chinese <b>internal</b> <b>codes</b> cause extra work, as special programming for character conversion is required when working with Koha. This situation is commonly seen in Asian countries such as China, Japan and Korea. This paper recommends implementing CMARC, MARC 21 or even any other type of MARC format in Koha with strong commercial-level support. Practical implications – Koha-Taiwan serves Koha Chinese users around the world. A successful Koha-Taiwan could be a model around the world. Originality/value – In recent years, the concept of implementing an open-source library management system has been coming to the fore. In Taiwan, the local-based commercial library system covers more than one quarter of the library system market in academic libraries because the company provides better tailor-made support, mainly in scripts and multiple <b>internal</b> <b>codes,</b> than do western-based commercial library systems. Evaluations and conclusions from this paper will be useful to countries where multi-scripts and double-byte character sets are issues...|$|R
