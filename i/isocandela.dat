40|$|This paper {{contributes}} to the science of measurement and control by outlining a unique methodology for objectively assessing the luminous intensity of all luminaires forming an airport landing lighting pattern, whilst in service, to check that the lighting pattern conforms to the strict standards set by airports ’ governing body within the UK the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA). Central to this methodology is a novel air-based measurement system consisting of charge-coupled device (CCD) cameras and dedicated image-processing software. This prototype measurement system is placed inside the cockpit of an aircraft and is used to take images of the airport landing lighting system whilst the aircraft approaches the airport. Developed image-processing techniques then allow unique luminaire identification and extraction from the hundreds of luminaires within the airport lighting pattern. The corresponding luminous intensity and alignment of each luminaire is derived using dynamic position and orientation information estimated from a visual environment model. By obtaining luminous intensity and alignment information for each luminaire within the pattern, it is then possible to derive its associated <b>isocandela</b> diagram. This then allows an assessment to be made regarding the luminaires ’ conformity to the CAA standards. The unique system has been teste...|$|E
30|$|Beam {{splitters}} {{are widely}} applied in various {{fields such as}} optical communications, optical calculation, optical storage, etc. [1]. Several polarization beam splitters [2, 3, 4, 5] and odd beam splitters for an incident beam with transverse electric (TE) polarizations have been presented, including 1  ×  3 beam splitter of double-groove fused-silica gratings [6], 1  ×  7 beam splitter based on double-groove blazed grating [7], three-port beam splitter of a binary fused-silica grating [8], etc. Compared with odd splitters, the <b>isocandela</b> even beam splitters for eliminating zero-order diffraction spectrum spot have attracted much interest due to their unique applications in circumstance with higher requirement in zero-order elimination, such as the fabrication of linearly chirped phase mask for fiber grating, beam splitting in the optical system of the lithography machine, and the denoising of the digital holographic optical system function. However, for the noise characteristic of the zero-order diffraction, the even beam splitters must achieve high efficiency and good uniformity in the condition of eliminating the noise introduced by the zero-order diffraction. The design and optimization are much more complicated and difficult {{than those of the}} odd splitters, which induces a higher requirement on the fabrication process. Many researchers have focused on binary phase grating structure which can avoid step lithography in manufacture process, e.g., Dammann gratings with complex periodic structure designed by traditional scalar theory [9, 10, 11, 12]. The reported diffraction efficiency achieved, respectively, up to 60 – 83  %, and an error of uniformity down to 5.7  ×  10 − 5 – 3.2  ×  10 − 4. Recently, even beam splitters with a subwavelength Dammann grating based on the vector theory were proved on enhancement of the efficiency. Though the efficiency is higher than 90  %, problems existed in manufacturing process due to numerous points of sudden phase in the structure are difficult to solve, and therefore, it is hard to achieve good performance of zero-order elimination and higher efficiency. According to the traditional scalar theory, it is impossible to achieve the even beam splitter with a binary simple periodical rectangular structure because it is difficult to eliminate the zero-order diffraction. As far as we know, there is no report to solve this problem in spite of its importance on the increase of efficiency and uniformity.|$|E
