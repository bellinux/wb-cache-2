Parametric investigations are carried out to understand the effect of step length, mixture equivalence ratio (phi), flow rate and wall thermal conductivity on <b>flame</b> <b>stability</b> limits, flame position, wall temperature profile and pollutant emissions. It was observed that the recirculation zone created due to sudden flow expansion at the backward step modifies the flow velocity profile, helps in stabilizing the flame within the combustor and enhances the <b>flame</b> <b>stability</b> limits significantly. The increase in {{the length of the}} first step helps in enhancing the <b>flame</b> <b>stability</b> limits at both lower and higher flow rates.

From these studies, it was inferred that fabrication with a high thermal conductivity material decreases the <b>flame</b> <b>stability</b> limits substantially and no stable flame was observed for a copper-based microcombustor. However, with a quartz-based microcombustor, stable flames were observed at minimum flow rates, which resulted in a minimum thermal input of similar to 5 W for a lean mixture (phi = 0. 7).

40|$|Flame structures, blowout {{limits and}} {{emissions}} of swirlstabilized premixed methane-air flames were studied experimentally {{in a small}} atmospheric combustor rig. Combustion sections with rectangular cross section (30 mm by 40 mm) and circular cross section (inner diameter = 39 mm) were used to investigate effects of combustor geometry on the flame's performance. Flame structures and instabilities were obtained from CH∗ chemiluminescence captured by a high speed intensified CMOS camera. Maps of flame blowout limits (ΦBO) versus total mass flow rates (m = 70 ∼ 130 standard liter per minute, SLPM) were obtained with the combustor inlet flow temperature (Tin) kept at Tin = 397 ± 5 K and a flow swirl number of S = 0. 6. Emission data of mole fraction of CO in the exhaust gas versus equivalence ratio was obtained under the conditions of Tin= 293 ± 5 K and S = 0. 66. It is found that the flame became longer and more unstable with decreasing equivalence ratio or increasing total mass flow rates.

Within the parameters investigated in this study, the equivalence ratio had the strongest impact on <b>flame</b> <b>stabilities</b> and CO emission. Both in the rectangular and circular combustors, when the flame length increased to a critical value (LIBO, which was approximately the same for these two combustors), flame could not be stabilized anymore and blowout occurred.

40|$|International audienceThe {{impact of}} {{preheating}} and dilution on methane/air non-premixed <b>flame</b> <b>stability</b> are studied experimentally. Six preheating levels are considered for initial reactant temperature between 295 K and 850 K {{in a round}} jet configuration. Four diluent gases are added on the air-side, either CO 2, N 2, Ar or a (CO 2 +Ar) mixture having the same molar heat capacity as N 2. For undiluted flames, jet transition velocities between attached and lifted states are investigated depending on initial reactant temperature. The hysteresis zone defined by these stability limits is shifted towards higher jet velocities with preheating. Whereas jet and coflow temperatures were identical in similar previous experiments, the present work allows examination of the thermal effects from either fuel or oxidizer streams. <b>Flame</b> <b>stability</b> is described based on the propagative aspects of the flame leading-edge, by analogy with the temperature dependency of the laminar burning velocity of a stoichiometric mixture. Results show that the jet temperature has {{a major influence on}} the lifting of an attached flame, whereas the coflow temperature remains important for the reattachment of a lifted flame. In addition, <b>flame</b> <b>stability</b> experiments have been performed at high levels of both preheating and dilution.

40|$|Introduction In the {{modelling}} of combustion and <b>flames,</b> the <b>stability</b> {{question is}} of major importance. Detonations are, by nature, unstable. Exchange of stability often arises in premixed flames, {{as shown by}} the classical thermo-diffusive model for Lewis number close to 1. In this framework, the famous Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation exhibits cellular instabilities. As far as diffusion flames are concerned, chambered flames present S-shaped response curves for arbitrary Lewis number. Away from laminar combustion, turbulence may stabilize the flame and lead to extinction/reignition phenomena. Solid combustion should not be forgotten: clearly instabilities in the combustion of solid propellants can endanger the rocket propulsion. Although there is a large literature on instabilities in combustion, most of the references are restricted to a rather formal approach, namely a linear stability analysis, based on the derivation of a so-called "dispersion relation".
