40|$|Abstract Background Serum {{follicle}} stimulating hormone (FSH) {{levels are}} used clinically to evaluate infertility, pituitary and gonadal disorders. With increased frequency of research collaborations across institutions, {{it is essential that}} <b>inter-laboratory</b> <b>validation</b> is addressed. Methods An <b>inter-laboratory</b> <b>validation</b> of three commercial FSH immunoassays was performed with human serum samples of varying frozen storage length (2 batches of 15 samples each) at - 25 degree C. Percentage differences and Bland-Altman limits of agreement were calculated. Results The inter- and intra-laboratory consistency of FSH values with the same assay manufacturer was much higher after shorter-term storage (frozen for less than 11 months, mean percentage degradation less than 4 %) than after long-term storage (2 - 3 years, mean percentage degradation = 23 %). Comparing assay results from different manufacturers, there was similar overall long term degradation as seen with the same manufacturer (- 25 %), however the degradation was greater when the original FSH was greater than 20 mIU/mL relative to less than 10 mIU/mL (p Conclusion The findings suggest that degradation of serum samples stored between 11 months and 2 - 3 years at - 25 degrees C can lead to unstable FSH measurements. Inter-laboratory variability due to frozen storage time and manufacturer differences in assay results should be accounted for when designing and implementing research or clinical quality control activities involving serum FSH at multiple study sites. </p...|$|E

40|$|In Europe {{one feature}} of National Food Composition Databanks (nFCDBs) {{is to provide}} data soundly {{supported}} in standardized quality assurance procedures. It is now widely recognized that {{the evaluation of the}} degree of dispersion associated with a result {{is an essential part of}} any quantitative analysis. According to recent requirements the concept of data quality incorporates the evaluation of the measurement uncertainty (MU) as an indicator of the reliability of the result. The aim of this work is to study the typification of approaches used to estimate measurement uncertainty in food composition analysis in compliance with the criteria established in the “Guide to the expression of uncertainty in measurement (GUM) ”.

40|$|Grapiprant, a novel {{pharmacologically}} active ingredient, acts as {{a selective}} EP 4 receptor antagonist whose physiological ligand is prostaglandin E 2 (PGE 2). It is currently under development for use in humans and dogs for the control of pain and inflammation associated with osteoarthritis. The aim {{of the present study}} was to develop an easy and sensitive method to quantify grapiprant in canine plasma and to apply the method in a canine patient. Several parameters, both in the extraction and detection method were evaluated. The final mobile phase consisted of ACN:AcONH 4 (20 mM) solution, pH 4 (70 : 30, v/v) at a flow rate of 1 mL/min. The elution of grapiprant and IS (metoclopramide) was carried out in isocratic mode through a Synergi Polar-RP 80 A analytical column (150 mm × 4. 6 mm). The best excitation and emission wavelengths were 320 and 365 nm, respectively. Grapiprant was extracted from the plasma using CHCl 3, which gave a recovery of 88. 1 ± 10. 22 % and a lower limit of quantification (LLOQ) of 10 ng/mL. The method was validated in terms of linearity, limit of detection (LOD), LLOQ, selectivity, accuracy and precision, extraction recovery, stability, and <b>inter-laboratory</b> cross <b>validation,</b> according to international guidelines. The chromatographic runs were specific with no interfering peaks at the retention times of the analyte and IS, as confirmed by HPLC-MS experiments.

40|$|Introduction Molecular {{characterisation}} of tumours {{is increasing}} personalisation of cancer therapy, tailored {{to an individual}} and their cancer. FOCUS 4 is a molecularly stratified clinical trial for patients with advanced colorectal cancer. During an initial 16 -week period of standard first-line chemotherapy, tumour tissue will undergo several molecular assays, with the results used for cohort allocation, then randomisation. Laboratories in Leeds and Cardiff will perform the molecular testing. The results of a rigorous pre-trial <b>inter-laboratory</b> analytical <b>validation</b> are presented and discussed. Methods Wales Cancer Bank supplied FFPE tumour blocks from 97 mCRC patients with consent for use in further research. Both laboratories processed each sample according to an agreed definitive FOCUS 4 laboratory protocol, reporting results directly to the MRC Trial Management Group for independent cross-referencing. Results Pyrosequencing analysis of mutation status at KRAS codons 12 / 13 / 61 / 146, NRAS codons 12 / 13 / 61, BRAF codon 600 and PIK 3 CA codons 542 / 545 / 546 / 1047, generated highly concordant results. Two samples gave discrepant results; in one a PIK 3 CA mutation was detected only in Leeds, and in the other, a PIK 3 CA mutation was only detected in Cardiff. pTEN and mismatch repair (MMR) protein expression was assessed by immunohistochemistry (IHC) resulting in 6 / 97 discordant results for pTEN and 5 / 388 for MMR, resolved upon joint review. Tumour heterogeneity was likely responsible for pyrosequencing discrepancies. The presence of signet-ring cells, necrosis, mucin, edge-effects and over-counterstaining influenced IHC discrepancies. Conclusions Pre-trial assay analytical validation is essential to ensure appropriate selection of patients for targeted therapies. This is feasible for both mutation testing and immunohistochemical assays and must be built into the workup of such trials. Trial registration number ISRCTN 90061564...|$|R
40|$|Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis (IUPUI) The aim of {{this study}} was to use multivariate {{statistical}} techniques to: (1) determine the reproducibility of fiber evidence analyzed by MSP, (2) determine whether XRF is an appropriate technique for forensic tape analysis, and (3) determine if DART/MS is an appropriate technique for forensic tape analysis. This was achieved by employing several multivariate statistical techniques including agglomerative hierarchical clustering, principal component analysis, discriminant analysis, and analysis of variance. First, twelve dyed textile fibers were analyzed by UV-Visible MSP. This analysis included an <b>inter-laboratory</b> study, external <b>validations,</b> differing preprocessing techniques, and color coordinates. The inter-laboratory study showed no statistically significant difference between the different instruments. The external validations had overall acceptable results. Using first derivatives as a preprocessing technique and color coordinates to define color did not result in any additional information. Next, the tape backings of thirty-three brands were analyzed by XRF. After chemometric analysis it was concluded that the 3 M tapes with black adhesive can be classified by brand except for Super 33 + (Cold Weather) and Super 88. The colorless adhesive tapes were separated into two large groups which were correlated with the presence of aluminosilicate filler. Overall, no additional discrimination was seen by using XRF compared to the traditional instrumentation for tape analysis previously published. Lastly, the backings of eighty-nine brands of tape were analyzed by DART/MS. The analysis of the black adhesive tapes showed that again discrimination between brands is possible except for Super 33 + and Super 88. However, now Tartan and Temflex have become indistinguishable. The colorless adhesive tapes again were more or less indistinguishable from one another with the exception of Tuff Hand Tool, Qualpack, and a roll of 3 M Tartan, which were found to be unique. It cannot be determined if additional discrimination was achieved with DART/MS because the multivariate statistical techniques have not been applied to the other instrumental techniques used during tape analysis...|$|R

Twenty-four samples including blank samples and samples with concentrations of the target analytes ranging between 1 and 5 mg kg(- 1) (expressed in microbiological activity) were analysed by seven laboratories participating in the study. The required detection limit was 1 mg kg(- 1) (expressed in microbiological activity). For spiramycin, acceptable values for the sensitivity (at least 95 %) indicating the rate of correct positive results were obtained for samples containing this substance at or above 2 mg kg(- 1), whereas at 1 mg kg(- 1), the sensitivity rate dropped to about 70 %. Therefore, it was concluded that the detection limit was 2 mg kg(- 1). For tylosin and virginiamycin, acceptable values of the sensitivity were obtained for all concentrations including 1 mg kg(- 1). Therefore, the method fulfils the criterion regarding the required sensitivity at the target detection limit for tylosin and virginiamycin...|$|E
40|$|The {{comet assay}} is an established, {{sensitive}} method extensively used in biomonitoring studies. The methods’ advantages include; a) {{only a small}} cell sample is required, b) possibility to measure damage in practically any cell type, c) ability to measure heterogeneity in response within a cell population, d) relatively fast and economical procedure, and e) various applications of the method, which allow measurement {{of a range of}} different DNA lesions as well as DNA repair. Several guidelines for the comet assay have been published, but no standardised protocol exists as yet. There are considerable differences between the protocols used by different research groups, which negatively affect inter-laboratory comparisons of results. Several experts in the field have highlighted the need for multi-laboratory, international validation studies, to assess intra- and inter-laboratory reproducibility and to investigate sources of variability in the results. The papers in this thesis can be divided into two parts; one part that deals with international <b>inter-laboratory</b> <b>validation</b> studies and methodological aspects of the comet assay (paper I-III), and the other part covers a human intervention study with antioxidant capsules consisting of many different antioxidants in low doses for which the comet assay has been applied (paper IV-V). The <b>inter-laboratory</b> <b>validation</b> trials in papers I-II indicate that the participants can detect dose-responses of both DNA breaks and oxidatively damaged DNA in coded cells, but that there is a large inter-laboratory variation in the reported values. This variation can in part be explained by differences in comet assay protocols and in image analysis. The inter-laboratory variation was decreased, but not completely removed, by calibration with ionising radiation. In paper III we verified that several protocol steps significantly affected the outcome of the comet assay, including a) density of the agarose gel, b) extent of enzymatic incubation, c) duration of alkaline treatment, and d) time of electrophoresis, as well as the strength of the electric field applied. In a parallel placebo-controlled, double-blind intervention study, overweight middleaged men were supplemented for six weeks with a multivitamin supplement consisting of a range of antioxidants in doses resembling those achieved by a healthy diet (paper IV-V). In spite of elevated levels of seven out of eight measured antioxidants in the blood, the intervention did not affect the level of oxidation of lipids or DNA. Many intervention studies with good design report similar null findings. It is preferred to consume antioxidants through a healthy diet, and dietary supplements are not recommended for cancer prevention...|$|E
40|$|Many PCR-based {{methods for}} {{microbial}} source tracking (MST) {{have been developed}} and validated within research laboratories, but require <b>inter-laboratory</b> <b>validation</b> before implementation. As part of the State of California Source Identification Protocol Project (SIPP), a blinded set of challenge filters were analyzed by three to five laboratories with a suite of PCR-based methods utilizing standardized methods. Repeatability (within lab agreement) and reproducibility (between lab agreement) of results were assessed by multiple metrics and compared to previously observed values for other environmental methods. Repeatability and reproducibility {{were found to be}} generally comparable to previously observed values for other methods (Median CV. 001 -. 033 and. 020 -. 106, respectively). Variance component analysis showed contribution of laboratory to total variability to be larger but of similar magnitude to inherent intra-laboratory variability among laboratories using standardized methods. Results among laboratories using non-standardized protocols for the same methods were also observed to have > 2 log differences at times. These findings verify the repeatability and reproducibility of these MST methods and highlight the need for standardization of protocols and consumables prior to implementation of larger scale microbial source tracking studies involving multiple laboratories...|$|E

The multi-sensor dipstick can be interpreted via visual observation or by an instrumental measurement of four test lines. Statistical analysis of the ILV data demonstrated that the multi-sensor can reliably detect the presence of sulfathiazole at 25 μg kg− 1 and tylosin at 10 μg kg− 1, which fully meet the ‘recommended concentrations’ of the EU. Ciprofloxacin and chloramphenicol can be detected at 25 and 5 μg kg− 1 in honey, respectively. Whilst the concentration for chloramphenicol is above the EU minimum required performance limit of 0. 3 μg kg− 1, this part of the multiplex test may still be of use to both the industry and enforcement authorities, to provide an early warning of contaminated honey.

The chemicals tested were sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), 1 -n-hexadecyl-pyridinium chloride monohydrate (CC), ethanol (EtOH), and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO). Eleven Japanese insititutions participated in this validation research to evaluate the usefulness of the Skin^ 2 Model ZK 1100 kit in accordance with an identical protocol. None of the participating laboratories had previously used the Skin^ 2 Model ZK 1100 kit. The MTT- 50 value obtained in the individual institutions was 42 to 91 μg/ml for SDS, 2. 7 to 8. 6 μg/ml for CC, 2. 0 to 9. 3 % for EtOH, and 11. 5 to 21. 9 % for DMSO.

The statistical analysis was performed in the department of statistics at the university of Bern. Similar to the EC 3 values defined for the radioactive method, threshold values were calculated for the endpoints measured in this modification of the LLNA. It was concluded that all parameters measured have to be taken into consideration for the categorisation of compounds due to their sensitising potencies. Therefore, an assessment scheme has been developed {{which turned out to be}} of great importance to consistently assess sensitisation versus irritancy based on the data of the different parameters. In contrast to the radioactive method, irritants have been picked up by all the laboratories applying this assessment scheme...|$|E
40|$|Proteins are {{susceptible}} to oxidation by reactive oxygen species, where the type of damage induced is characteristic of the denaturing species. The induction of protein carbonyls is a widely applied biomarker, arising from primary oxidative insult. However, when applied to complex biological and pathological conditions it can be subject to interference from lipid, carbohydrate and DNA oxidation products. More recently, interest {{has focused on the}} analysis of specific protein bound oxidised amino acids. Of the 22 amino acids, aromatic and sulphydryl containing residues have been regarded as being particularly susceptible to oxidative modification, with L-DOPA from tyrosine, ortho-tyrosine from phenylalanine; sulphoxides and disulphides from methionine and cysteine respectively; and kynurenines from tryptophan. Latterly, the identification of valine and leucine hydroxides, reduced from hydroperoxide intermediates, has been described and applied. In order to examine the nature of oxidative damage and protective efficacy of antioxidants the markers must be thoroughly evaluated for dosimetry in vitro following damage by specific radical species. Antioxidant protection against formation of the biomarker should be demonstrated in vitro. Quantification of biomarkers in proteins from normal subjects should be within the limits of detection of any analytical procedure. Further to this, the techniques for isolation and hydrolysis of specific proteins should demonstrate that in vitro oxidation is minimised. There is a need for the development of standards for quality assurance material to standardise procedures between laboratories. At present, antioxidant effects on protein oxidation in vivo are limited to animal studies, where dietary antioxidants have been reported to reduce dityrosine formation during rat exercise training. Two studies on humans have been reported last year. The further application of these methods to human studies is indicated, where the quality of the determinations will be enhanced through <b>inter-laboratory</b> <b>validation...</b>|$|E
40|$|Background: Neurofilament {{proteins}} (Nf) {{are highly}} specific biomarkers for neuronal death and axonal degeneration. As these markers become more widely used, an <b>inter-laboratory</b> <b>validation</b> study {{is required to}} identify assay criteria for high quality performance. Methods: The UmanDiagnostics NF-light (R) enzyme-linked immunoabsorbent assays (ELISA) for the neurofilament light chain (NfL, 68 kDa) {{was used to test}} the intra-assay and inter-laboratory coefficient of variation (CV) between 35 laboratories worldwide on 15 cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples. Critical factors, such as sample transport and storage, analytical delays, reaction temperature and time, the laboratories' accuracy and preparation of standards were documented and used for the statistical analyses. Results: The intra-laboratory CV averaged 3. 3 % and the inter-laboratory CV 59 %. The results from the test laboratories correlated with those from the reference laboratory (R = 0. 60, p < 0. 0001). Correcting for critical factors improved the strength of the correlation. Differences in the accuracy of standard preparation were identified as the most critical factor. Correcting for the error introduced by variation in the protein standards improved the correlation to R = 0. 98, p < 0. 0001 with an averaged inter-laboratory CV of 14 %. The corrected overall inter-rater agreement was subtantial (0. 6) according to Fleiss' multi-rater kappa and Gwet's AC 1 statistics. Conclusion: This multi-center validation study identified the lack of preparation of accurate and consistent protein standards as the main reason for a poor inter-laboratory CV. This issue is also relevant to other protein biomarkers based on this type of assay and will need to be solved in order to achieve an acceptable level of analytical accuracy.

40|$|Changes in {{the hormone}} {{regulation}} in animals due to environmental contaminants (endocrine disruptors) has recently become a widely investigated and politically charged issue. Invertebrates account for 95 % {{of the known}} species of animals on earth, yet surprisingly little effort {{has been made to}} understand their value in signaling potential environmental endocrine disruption. A few reports, however, do suggest that endocrine disruptive effects also affect invertebrates. Due to the high pollutant load of the Scheldt estuary and North Sea, effects on resident populations may occur. A recent database published by our laboratory summarizes the possible effects of potential endocrine disruptive compounds for the North Sea ecosystem. Mysids are used frequently in toxicity studies and there is growing interest in developing toxicity tests with mysids that are indigenous to local ecosystems. Furthermore, United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) has included mysid shrimp as part of a tiered approach in its Endocrine Disruptor Screening Program. In this context, we are examining the potential use of Neomysis integer as a test organism for determining the effects of endocrine disruptors on northern European estuarine communities. The hyperbenthic N. integer dominates the upper regions of European estuaries and are thought to provide a significant link in the exchange of organic matter between the benthic and pelagic systems of estuaries. Cellular and physiological biomarkers for endocrine disruption related to the energy and steroid metabolism of N. integer have been developed and are currently being evaluated in an <b>inter-laboratory</b> <b>validation</b> study. The results obtained with these biomarkers are linked to ecological field observations and measured concentrations of selected endocrine disruptors in the Scheldt estuary (Netherlands). Results of the biomarker studies and field samplings will be highlighted and suggestions on the use of this invertebrate model to test possible endocrine disruptive effects in estuarine environments will be discussed...|$|E
40|$|Tropane {{alkaloids}} (TAs) are toxic secondary metabolites {{produced by}} plants of, inter alia, the genera Datura (thorn apple) and Atropa (deadly nightshade). The most relevant TAs are (-) -L-hyoscyamine and (-) -L-scopolamine, which act as antagonists of acetylcholine muscarinic receptors and can induce {{a variety of}} distinct toxic syndromes in mammals (anti-cholinergic poisoning). The European Union has regulated the presence of seeds of Datura sp. in animal feeds, specifying that the content should not exceed 1000 mg kg(- 1) (Directive 2002 / 32 /EC). For materials {{that have not been}} ground, visual screening methods are often used to comply with these regulations, but these cannot be used for ground materials and compound feeds. Immunological assays, preferably in dipstick format, can be a simple and cost-effective approach to monitor feedstuffs in an HACCP setting in control laboratories. So far no reports have been published on immunoassays that are capable of detecting both hyoscyamine and scopolamine with equal sensitivity and that can be used, preferably in dipstick format, for application as a fast screening tool in feed analysis. This study presents the results obtained for the in-house and <b>inter-laboratory</b> <b>validation</b> of a dipstick immunoassay for the detection of hyoscyamine and scopolamine in animal feed. The target level was set at 800 µg kg(- 1) for the sum of both alkaloids. By using a representative set of compound feeds during validation and a robust study design, a reliable impression of the relevant characteristics of the assay could be obtained. The dipstick test displayed similar sensitivity towards the two alkaloids and it could be concluded that the test has a very low probability of producing a false-positive result at blank level or a false-negative result at target level. The assay can be used for monitoring of TAs in feedstuffs, but has also potential as a quick screening tool in food- or feed-related poisonings...|$|E
40|$|The new OECD {{guideline}} 429 (skin sensitization: local {{lymph node}} assay) {{is based upon}} a protocol, which utilises the incorporation of radioactivity into DNA as a measure for cell proliferation in vivo. The guideline also {{enables the use of}} alternative endpoints in order to assess draining lymph node (LN) cell proliferation. Here we describe the first round of an <b>inter-laboratory</b> <b>validation</b> of alternative endpoints in the LLNA conducted in seven laboratories. The validation study was managed and supervised by the Swiss Agency for Therapeutic Products, Swissmedic. Statistical analyses of all data were performed by an independent centre at the University of Bern, Department of Statistics. Ear-draining, LN weight and cell count were used to assess proliferation instead of radioactive labeling of lymph node cells. In addition, the acute inflammatory skin reaction was measured by ear swelling and weight of circular biopsies of the ears to identify skin irritating properties of the test items. Hexylcinnamaldehyde (HCA) and three blinded test items were applied to female, 8 – 10 weeks old NMRI and BALB/c mice. Results were sent via the independent study coordinator to the statistician. The results of this first round showed that the alternative endpoints of the LLNA are sensitive and robust parameters. The use of ear weights added an important parameter assessing the skin irritation potential, which supports the differentiation of pure irritative from contact allergenic potential. There were absolute no discrepancies between the categorisation of the three test substances A–C determined by each single participating laboratories. The results highlighted also that many parameters do {{have an impact on the}} strength of the responses. Therefore, such parameters have to be taken into consideration for the categorisation of compounds due to their relative sensitizing potencies...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe yolk protein {{precursor}} vitellogenin (Vtg) in plasma {{has proved}} to be a simple and sensitive biomarker for assessing exposure of fish to environmental estrogens. Within international bodies such as the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) work is ongoing to develop screening and testing programmes for endocrine disrupting effects of new chemicals, and in the focus of this development are the fish test species common carp (Cyprinus carpio), fathead minnow (Pimephales promelas), zebrafish (Danio rerio) and Japanese medaka (Oryzias latipes). In this study we have developed quantitative enzyme linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) for Vtg in common carp/fathead minnow, zebrafish and Japanese medaka. The assays were developed using a combination of monoclonal and polyclonal fish Vtg antibodies in a sandwich format, using stabilized Vtg from the test species as a standard. The carp Vtg ELISA has a working range of 1 - 63 ng/mL, a minimal detection limit of 0. 6 ng/mL, and may also be used for quantification of Vtg in fathead minnow. In fathead minnow whole-body homogenate samples, the practical detection limit is 400 ng/mL due to the matrix effect. The zebrafish Vtg ELISA has a working range of 0. 5 - 63 ng/mL, a minimal detection limit of 0. 4 ng/mL, and a practical detection limit of 200 ng/mL in whole-body homogenate samples. The medaka Vtg ELISA has a working range of 0. 25 - 16 ng/mL, a minimal detection limit of 0. 1 ng/mL, and a practical detection limit of 125 ng/mL in whole-body homogenate samples. The intra- and inter-assay variations were below 20 % for all assays. The assays were evaluated with sets of representative samples spanning the wide dynamic range of Vtg-levels found in fish exposed to environmental estrogens, and all three assays are currently undergoing international <b>inter-laboratory</b> <b>validation...</b>|$|E
40|$|Serological assays {{for human}} IgG 4 to the Onchocerca volvulus antigen Ov 16 {{have been used}} to confirm {{elimination}} of onchocerciasis in much of the Americas and parts of Africa. A standardized source of positive control antibody (human anti-Ov 16 IgG 4) will ensure the quality of surveillance data using these tests. A recombinant human IgG 4 antibody to Ov 16 was identified by screening against a synthetic human Fab phage display library and converted into human IgG 4. This antibody was developed into different positive control formulations for enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and rapid diagnostic test (RDT) platforms. Variation in ELISA results and utility as a positive control of the antibody were assessed from multiple laboratories. Temperature and humidity conditions were collected across seven surveillance activities from 2011 - 2014 to inform stability requirements for RDTs and positive controls. The feasibility of the dried positive control for RDT was evaluated during onchocerciasis surveillance activity in Togo, in 2014. When the anti-Ov 16 IgG 4 antibody was used as a standard dilution in horseradish peroxidase (HRP) and alkaline phosphatase (AP) ELISAs, the detection limits were approximately 1 ng/mL by HRP ELISA and 10 ng/mL by AP ELISA. Positive control dilutions and spiked dried blood spots (DBS) produced similar ELISA results. Used as a simple plate normalization control, the positive control antibody may improve ELISA data comparison in the context of inter-laboratory variation.

40|$|International audienceComparability and {{reliability}} of monitoring data are essential for any meaningful assessment and {{for the management of}} environmental risks. For emerging pollutants, there is concern regarding the comparability of data at the European level. Methods used for the monitoring of emerging pollutants have often not been properly validated either in-house or at the international level. Such methods are often not well established in the scientific community, and far from being harmonised or standardised. In addition, they may only be applicable to specific conditions (matrix, organism) which may further complicate data comparability. Within the EU-funded coordination action "NORMAN - Network of Reference Laboratories for Monitoring and Bio-monitoring of Emerging Pollutants", a common European approach to the validation of both chemical and biological methods for the respective monitoring and bio-monitoring of emerging pollutants (or their effects) in a broad range of matrices has been developed. This guidance document addresses three different validation approaches, in increasing order of complexity. These are : 1. Within-laboratory validation (research level); 2. Basic external validation (transferability at expert level); 3. <b>Inter-laboratory</b> <b>validation</b> (routine level). The concept of these three approaches is strictly hierarchical, i. e. a method must fulfil all criteria of the lower level before it can enter the validation protocol of a higher level. In the case of a specific monitoring task, this protocol will guide the user through the following steps : I. Evaluation and classification of existing methods with respect to their potential, both in terms of validation, and the selection of an appropriate validation approach; II. Development of a method, in terms of extending its application; III. The validation procedures to be undertaken in order to effectively demonstrate the validation status of a selected method according to the three approaches adopted. The scope of the harmonised protocol covers quantitative and qualitative biological and chemical test methods for the analysis of water, air, soil and biota. The protocols have been tested in three case studies, each one matching one of the three validation levels. Based on the feedback from the case studies, the protocols have been improved. Future validation studies (for methods to monitor emerging pollutants) by the NORMAN network will make use of the protocols, and it is intended to implement the protocols at the level of European Standardisation (e. g. as CEN guidance document) ...|$|E

A proficiency test (PT) was conducted for the simultaneous determination of up to 11 mycotoxins (aflatoxin B- 1 (AFB(1)), aflatoxin B- 2 (AFB(2)), aflatoxin G(1) (AFG(1)), aflatoxin G(2) (AFG(2)), ochratoxin A (OTA), deoxynivalenol (DON), T- 2 toxin (T- 2), HT- 2 toxin (HT- 2), zearalenone (ZEA), fumonisin B- 1 (FB 1) and fumonisin B- 2 (FB 2)) in maize using LC-MS/(MS) to benchmark laboratories currently using this technique and to obtain information on currently used methodologies and method-related performances. Each participant received the following: instructions; a comprehensive questionnaire; a mixed mycotoxins calibration solution; a spiking solution (AFB(1), AFB(2), AFG(1) and AFG(2), OTA, DON, T- 2, HT- 2, ZEA, FB 1 and FB 2); and two test materials, namely a contaminated maize sample and a blank maize sample to be spiked with a spiking solution containing 11 mycotoxins. Laboratory results were rated with z-scores. Of the 64 laboratories enrolled in the PT, 41 laboratories from 14 countries returned 43 sets of results for various combinations of analytes. The majority of laboratories (61 %) reported results for all 11 mycotoxins, whereas the remaining laboratories reported results for a restricted combination (from 2 to 10 analytes). For contaminated maize and spiked maize the percentage of satisfactory z-score values (vertical bar z vertical bar 3) was obtained for FB 1 (31 %), FB 2 (32 %), AFB(1) (32 %) and AFB(2) (32 %) in contaminated maize and for DON (35 %), FB 1 (63 %) and FB 2 (52 %) in spiked maize. Mean recovery results were acceptable for all mycotoxins (74 % to 109 %), except for fumonisins, where these were unacceptably high (159 % for FB 1 and 163 % for FB 2). A robust and reliable method for simultaneous determination of 11 mycotoxins in maize could not be identified from the results of this PT.
