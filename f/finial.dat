5|$|The double <b>finial</b> minaret {{was built}} in 1509 by Qansah al-Ghuri. Sitting on a square base, the first shaft is octagonal, and four sides have a {{decorative}} keel arch, separated from the adjacent sides with two columns. The second shaft, is a 12 - sided polygon separated from the first by a fretted balconies supported by muqarnas is decorated with blue faience. A balcony separates the third level from the second shaft. The third level {{is made up of}} two rectangular shafts with horseshoe arches on each side of both shafts. Atop each of these two shafts rests a <b>finial</b> atop two identical onion shaped bulbs, with a balcony separating the finials from the shafts.|$|E
5|$|When {{the weather}} improved, work {{commenced}} outside. The cap circle was mostly constructed {{before the first}} work-in commenced. The work-ins took place over two separate weeks in July and August, with 35 people participating. During the first work-in, the fantail posts and braces were fitted. The oak cap ribs, which had been prefabricated offsite were fitted and the <b>finial</b> was supported by scaffolding ready for final fitting. Intermdiate noggings of oak were fitted and the <b>finial</b> was pulled into position using a windlass. The cap frame was competed with the fitting of intermediate ribs and noggings. The rear of the cap circle was also completed during this time.|$|E
5|$|According to the 1995 presidential decree, the {{national}} flag {{is to be}} used on a staff that is colored gold (ochre). Other parts of the protocol specify the <b>finial</b> (the metal ornament on a flag pole) as diamond-shaped and colored in a yellow metal. In this diamond there is a five-pointed star (similar to that used in national emblem). The diamond-pattern represents another continuation of Soviet flag-traditions.|$|E
50|$|Bed posts {{often end}} in <b>finials.</b> Wooden posts {{tend to have}} turned wood <b>finials.</b> While the purpose of <b>finials</b> on bed posts is mostly decorative, they serve a purpose on curtain rods, {{providing}} {{a way to keep}} a curtain from slipping off the end of a straight rod.|$|R

Textualis sine pedibus, literally [...] "textualis without feet", has minims with no <b>finials</b> at all, while textualis rotunda has round <b>finials.</b>|$|R

5|$|An {{alternative}} mourning {{style is}} {{to wrap the}} spherical <b>finial</b> with black cloth and place a black ribbon, known as a , above the flag. This style {{dates back to the}} death of Emperor Meiji on July 30, 1912, and the Cabinet issued an ordinance stipulating that the national flag should be raised in mourning when the Emperor dies. The Cabinet has the authority to announce the half-staffing of the national flag.|$|E
5|$|A {{variety of}} Buddhist metal {{implements}} and objects have been designated as 19 National Treasures. These include five decorated bronze or copper gongs, struck with wooden sticks during Buddhist rituals, {{a set of}} flower baskets (keko) used in the Buddhist flower-scattering ritual, six pagoda shaped reliquaries, an incense burner, a sutra container, a bowl for offerings, a banner for ceremonial use, the <b>finial</b> of a pilgrim's staff and two sets of implements used in Esoteric Buddhism.|$|E
5|$|Altogether, {{thirteen}} {{pieces were}} stolen {{at an estimated}} loss of $500 million, making the robbery the largest private property theft in history. Empty frames remain hanging in the museum, both in homage to the missing works and as placeholders for when they are returned. One of the paintings, The Concert, was Gardner's first major acquisition and one of only 34 known Vermeer works in the world. It {{is thought to be}} the most valuable unrecovered stolen painting, with a value estimated at over $200 million. Another painting, The Storm on the Sea of Galilee, is Rembrandt's only known seascape. The bronze <b>finial</b> was taken from the top of a Napoleonic flag, possibly appearing like gold to the thieves. The museum is offering a $100,000 reward for this piece alone.|$|E

5|$|The 11-century temple-building boom {{continued}} in the 12th century {{with the addition of}} new features. The Mahadeva Temple at Itagi and the Siddhesvara Temple in Haveri are standard constructions incorporating these developments. Based on the general plan of the Amrtesvara Temple at Annigeri, the Mahadeva Temple was built in 1112 CE and has the same architectural components as its predecessor. There are however differences in their articulation; the sala roof (roof under the <b>finial</b> of the superstructure) and the miniature towers on pilasters are chiseled instead of moulded. The difference between the two temples, built fifty years apart, is the more rigid modelling and decoration found in many components of the Mahadeva Temple. The voluptuous carvings of the 11th century were replaced with a more severe chiselling.|$|E
5|$|The stables {{were built}} in 1820, during {{the early part of}} the Admiral's {{ownership}} of the estate, based on a design by John Smith; the buildings are sited to the rear of the mansion house. Built in a horseshoe-shape, neo-classical design, the two-storey building was constructed in pinned rubble with granite dressings; grey granite was used for the parapet and quoins. The main buildings were originally harled. A corrugated asbestos hipped roof was at some point substituted for the original slate roof. It features a columned rotunda above a timber clock tower, which has a <b>finial</b> and domed copper roof. The pedimented centrepiece of the symmetrical front elevation is a segmental arch and has three panels set back between columns. Each side is bordered by wings of three bays with single-bay pavilions.|$|E
5|$|The {{west side}} of the walls include nine towers, rising upwards towards the {{south-west}} corner. Two of the towers were significantly affected by 19th-century developments; one was converted into an entrance way for the Bangor Road in 1827, whilst another suffered a deep fissure caused by subsidence from the excavation of the Chester to Holyhead railway tunnel in 1845, and had to be underpinned in 1963. One of the remaining merlons on this stretch of the walls' battlements has a stone <b>finial</b> on top, a design originally used along all of the town walls. The western wall originally extended out to the river Conwy itself, ending in a round tower, but this has since been lost; a similar spur arrangement was seen at Chester and Lincoln.|$|E
50|$|Curtain rod <b>finials</b> {{can be seen}} to act {{much like}} a {{barometer}} of public taste. Many designs hark back to the gothic and Neogothic of architectural <b>finials,</b> while other contemporary <b>finials</b> reflect minimalist, art nouveau and other traditional styles of décor. The use of different materials is as wide as the range of designs with brass, stainless steel, various woods and aluminium being employed with a variety of finishes such as ‘satin steel’ and 'antique brass'. The durability, strength and machinability of modern alloys have lent themselves to increasingly intricate and dazzling designs.|$|R
40|$|After our {{previous}} {{investigation of a}} bronze eight-belled rattle (bronze disk with eight prongs and bells), we investigated bronze bell <b>finials</b> {{with the aim of}} analyzing the bronze casting techniques used in ancient Korea. The <b>finials</b> were allegedly excavated in Jukdongri, Gyeongju and are housed in the Gyeongju National Museum. Eight-belled rattles and bell <b>finials</b> were both made in pairs, but because our research of an eight-belled rattle examined only one of the pair, it could not fully analyze the casting techniques employed to make two identical bronze products in ancient Korea On reflection, we examined both of the pair of <b>finials.</b> The similarities and differences observed between the two <b>finials</b> drew following inferences concerning the casting techniques. 1. The incised patterns on the two <b>finials</b> match each other. This indicates that the pair was cast from two different molds formed from a same model (master form). 2. The two bell <b>finials</b> have a lengthwise seam and a crosswise seam, which indicates that the outer molds probably consisted of four segments. 3. The inner molds (core) were made with following procedures. 1. Sand was poured into the outer mold to be shape into cores. 2. The sand was divided into two sections: the top section with a little bronze ball inside and the bottom section. 3. The outer mold was removed from the sand molds. 4. The surfaces of the sand molds were shaved off to make the cavity to pour molten bronze. 5. The string holes were made with a kind of bow drills...|$|R

5|$|Built in 1483, it has {{a square}} base, a {{transitional}} segment leading into an octagonal shaft, then a 10 - sided polygon shaft, followed by a cylindrical shaft that consists of 8 brick pillars, each two adjoined by bricks in between. The Minaret of Qaytbay also has three balconies, supported by muqarnas, a form of stalactite vaulting which provide a smooth transition from a flat surface to a curved one (first recorded to {{have been used in}} Egypt in 1085), that adorn the minaret. The first shaft is octagonal is decorated with keel-arched panels on each side, with a cluster of three columns separating each panel. Above this shaft is the second octagonal shaft which is separated from the first by a balcony and decorated with plaiting. A second balcony separates this shaft with the final cylindrical shaft, decorated with four arches. Above this is the third balcony, crowned by the <b>finial</b> top of the minaret.|$|E
5|$|South India has two {{distinct}} styles of rock architecture, the Dravidian style of Tamil Nadu and the Vesara style of Karnataka. The temples considered of porches or mantapas preceding the door {{leading to the}} sanctum, gate-pyramids or gopurams, which are the principal features in the quadrangular enclosures that surround the more notable temples and pillared halls used for many purposes and are the invariable accompaniments of these temples. Besides these, a South Indian temple typically has a tank called the Kalyani or Pushkarni. The gopuram is a monumental tower, usually ornate {{at the entrance of}} any temple in Southern India. This forms a prominent feature of koils, Hindu temples of the Dravidian style. They are topped by the kalasam, a spherical stone <b>finial,</b> and function as gateways through the walls that surround the temple complex. The origins of the gopuram {{can be traced back to}} early structures of the Pallavas and by the twelfth century, under the Pandya rulers, these gateways became a dominant feature of a temple's outer appearance, eventually overshadowing the inner sanctuary which became obscured from view by the colossal size of the gopuram.|$|E

5|$|The cup {{stayed in}} the convent until 1882 when the nuns were short of funds and wanted to sell it. It was {{at some point during}} this period that the pearl border to the cover and the Tudor <b>finial</b> were removed. The nuns decided they would get a better price in Paris than in Spain, and the cup was {{entrusted}} to Simon Campo, a priest, who took it to Paris and approached several leading dealers and collectors. There had been a spate of forgeries of medieval objects, and the Parisians were suspicious, until one, Baron Jérôme Pichon, researched the second added cylinder and was sufficiently convinced that this was the cup documented in 1604 to make a rather low offer, which was accepted. In the course of his researches the baron had contacted the current Duke of Frías, who had supplied useful information, and then initially congratulated the buyer on his purchase. However, on looking further into the matter the duke realized that the sale was contrary to the 1610 deed of gift he had discovered in the family archives, and sued in the French courts to recover the cup.|$|E
5|$|The three-story {{brick house}} {{includes}} a full elevated basement and a mansard roof with steeply pitched gabled dormers. Projecting from the roofline are plain corbeled chimneys and iron gillwork, the original roofing material was slate. The 1879 {{version of the}} Ellwood House featured dormer ornamentation with <b>finial</b> work. The original windows were all double-hung and of modest size, occurring both singly and in pairs while showing a variety of lintel designs. The original front (east) facade appeared much different than it does at present. The front entryway has been completely altered, due to Perry Ellwood's 1911 remodeling. The original entryway featured a one-story stone porch supported with two pilasters and two granite columns. The square projecting porch bay {{was connected to the}} ground via 12 stone stairs. In the southeast corner of the house was a full three-story projecting tower set at a 45° angle {{to the rest of the}} front facade.|$|E

After Leigh falls through the floor of the attic, Kelli is attacked by both Agnes and Billy. While fighting, the Christmas tree catches fire while she and Agnes fall down into one of the holes in the wall. Managing to escape with Leigh's help, they set the house on fire and reach the hospital. At the hospital, Agnes, who had survived the fire, kills Leigh but Kelli manages to kill her using a defibrillator. When Billy chases her to the stairs, Kelli manages to knock him over, impaling him on the <b>finial</b> of a Christmas tree and finally killing him. She is last seen staring at Billy's corpse.|$|E

5|$|No single motive or {{pattern has}} emerged through the {{thousands}} of pages of evidence gathered. The selection of works puzzles the experts, specifically since more valuable artworks were available. The FBI's lead agent assigned to the case, Geoffrey J. Kelly, finds it difficult to understand why this assortment of items was stolen despite the thieves being in the museum for enough time to take whatever they wished. On their way to the <b>finial,</b> the thieves passed by two Raphaels and a Botticelli painting. Titian's The Rape of Europa, {{which is one of the}} museum's most well-known and valuable pieces, was not stolen. Due to the brutish ways the criminals handled the robbery, cutting the painting from their frames and smashing frames for two Degas sketches, investigators believe the thieves were amateur criminals, not experts commissioned to steal particular works. Some investigators believe the works were destroyed, explaining why they have not reappeared. Theories on the theft include that it was organized by the Irish Republican Army in order to raise money or bargain for the release of imprisoned comrades. Another theory states Whitey Bulger was the ringleader of the theft. At the time of the heist, he was Boston's top crime boss and an FBI informant.|$|E
