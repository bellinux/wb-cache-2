40|$|Abstract Background Cycling is {{considered}} to be a highly beneficial sport for significantly enhancing cardiovascular fitness in individuals, yet studies show little or no corresponding improvements in bone mass. Methods A scientific literature search on studies discussing bone mass and bone metabolism in cyclists was performed to collect all relevant published material up to April 2012. Descriptive, cross-sectional, longitudinal and interventional studies were all reviewed. Inclusion criteria were met by 31 studies. Results Heterogeneous studies in terms of gender, age, data source, group of comparison, cycling level or modality practiced among others factors showed minor but important differences in results. Despite some controversial results, it has been observed that adult road cyclists participating in regular training have low bone mineral density in key regions (for example, lumbar spine). Conversely, other types of cycling (such as mountain biking), or combination with other sports could reduce this unsafe effect. These results cannot yet be explained by differences in dietary patterns or endocrine factors. Conclusions From our comprehensive survey of the current available literature it can be concluded that road cycling does not appear to confer any significant osteogenic benefit. The cause of this may be related to spending long hours in a weight-supported position on the bike in combination with the necessary <b>enforced</b> <b>recovery</b> time that involves a large amount of time sitting or lying supine, especially at the competitive level. </p...|$|E

40|$|Private {{state aid}} {{enforcement}} {{with respect to}} below market value transactions carried out by Swedish municipalities – A study on the conformity of Swedish procedural and substantial rules with the principle of effectiveness of EC law Recently in Sweden, several local governmental entities (municipalities) have engaged in commercial transactions that, essentially, have been aimed at transferring the ownership of public services – for example schools and local medical care centers – to private undertakings. A few of these transactions have been declared by Swedish administrative courts to constitute illegal below market value transfers of public resources. The essay seeks {{to determine whether the}} Swedish national provisions that govern legal claims based on the directly effective Art. 88 (3) of the EC Treaty, are compatible with the principle of effectiveness, i. e. to what extent these provisions (do not) render virtually impossible or excessively difficult the exercise of rights conferred by Art. 88 (3) EC. The author investigates the conformity of national rules with the principle of effectiveness in a situation where a) a private party seeks to <b>enforce</b> <b>recovery</b> of unlawfully adopted state aid and b) the European Commission has yet to take any action with respect to the aid measure. By examining the ECJ case-law on the principle of effectiveness vis-à-vis the case-law on Art. 88 (3) EC, the author concludes, inter alia, that several Swedish procedural provisions are deemed to be found incompatible with the principle of effectiveness. Furthermore, the author ends up concluding that in respect of a competitor’s right to <b>enforce</b> aid <b>recovery,</b> the current case-law of the ECJ leaves certain key questions unanswered, most notably whether or not national law must provide a competitor the possibility to bring a recovery action directly against the aid recipient...|$|R

40|$|Family Law within Australia has {{undergone}} extensive legislative and operational changes since its inception. It {{is an area}} of law that impacts upon a number of stakeholders such as children, parents, law enforcement agencies, the Government and judicial officers. The research took a small facet of the operation of the Family Law Act 1975, namely the enforcement of parenting orders by police services. The focus of the research was to unfold the process and difficulties encountered by police services when executing a recovery order issued by the Courts under s. 67 of the Family Law Act 1975. It further explored police perspective, training and organisational service delivery, in carrying out their duties. Two qualitative methodological approaches were used in this research. The main approach used was Grounded Theory. Narrative Inquiry was also incorporated into the research. The objective of Narrative Inquiry is to create social context from story telling. Participants were asked to describe their experiences when executing recovery orders. Interviews were undertaken with members from the Victoria Police and the Australian Federal Police (AFP) who have had experience with the execution of recovery orders. These participants were also asked to construct the process when a recovery order is executed and to describe the atmosphere. In addition, journaling and observations were used. These observations took place in the Family Court and Federal Magistrates&# 039; Court in Victoria. The findings and relevant literature indicated that police disliked becoming involved in executing recovery orders. The Police perceived family law in general not to be a central area of policing. These findings parallel earlier findings from an Australian Parliamentary report in 1992. Furthermore, the findings indicated that little organisational commitment was placed on the function of <b>enforcing</b> <b>recovery</b> orders. This was indicated by the limited and inconsistent resources provided by the Australian Federal Police (AFP) to fulfil their obligations, and the lack of training offered to police members. The findings indicated that the Police would take initial steps prior to executing the order. They would contact the applicant parent to assist with inquiries to locate a child, assess variables such as the potential for violence and arrange with the applicant parent where the child would be delivered. In addition, even though the findings outlined that recovery orders were fairly non-complex to execute, at times there would be difficulties in locating a child and finalising arrangements for a child to be returned to a parent. The findings also indicated that there was no clear practice as to which section of the Victoria Police would execute a recovery order if requested by the AFP. Whilst the findings need to be considered carefully in light of the small sample group, it did indicate that there are some difficulties with the process and value placed by police services within Australia on the execution of recovery orders...|$|R
40|$|A major {{security}} {{concern with}} outsourcing data storage to thirdparty providers is authenticating {{the integrity and}} freshness of data. State-of-the-art software-based approaches require clients to maintain state and cannot immediately detect forking attacks, while approaches that introduce limited trusted hardware (e. g., a monotonic counter) at the storage server achieve low throughput. This paper proposes a new design for authenticating data storage using {{a small piece of}} high-performance trusted hardware attached to an untrusted server. The proposed design achieves significantly higher throughput than previous designs. The server-side trusted hardware allows clients to authenticate data integrity and freshness without keeping any mutable client-side state. Our design achieves high performance by parallelizing server-side authentication operations and permitting the untrusted server to maintain caches and schedule disk writes, while <b>enforcing</b> precise crash <b>recovery</b> and write access control...|$|R
40|$|The part {{played by}} non-prime {{household}} loans {{in improving the}} lives of many people who cannot afford collateral globally cannot be ignored. Many Microfinance Banks in many economies worldwide have tried to maintain the Grameen Bank Model of granting microloans, mainly non-prime household loans. However, the credit risks associated with this initiative hamper the pace at which the granting of this credit facility is expected to grow. This study intends to explore the relationship between the post loan disbursement allocation and the performance of non-prime household loans in the Microfinance Banks in Kenya. The theory associated to this study is the Credit Risk Theory. This theory, which is regarded as credit structural theory, was developed by Merton in 1972. The descriptive survey research design method was applied, and the sample size was 150 respondents. The data-collection tool used was a questionnaire. A logistic regression analysis was conducted for the purpose of predicting non-prime household performance in the Microfinance Banks using training budget, recoveries budget, percentage of training budget, and percentage of recoveries budget as predictors. The Wald test shows that training budget, recoveries budget, and percentage of training budget were good predictors, making a significant contribution to prediction. The percentage of budget on recoveries was not a significant predictor. The Microfinance Banks should enhance the performance of non-prime household loans through capacity building to the borrowers and educate the borrowers on dangers of <b>enforced</b> loan <b>recoveries.</b> The government, through the Central Bank of Kenya, should have a training policy for the Microfinance Banks so that they can enlighten the borrowers on proper financial management to avoid conflicts with borrowers during loan recoveries...|$|R

He distinguishes his debts into two sorts: those contracted {{before the year}} 1766, and those contracted from that year to {{the year in which}} he left Madras.--Being asked, What he thinks is the original amount of the old debts? he said, Between twenty-three and twenty-four lacs of pagodas, as well as he can recollect.--Being asked, What was the amount of that debt when he left Madras? he said, Between four and five lacs of pagodas, as he understood.--Being asked, What was the amount of the new debt when he left Madras? he said, In November, 1777, that debt amounted, according to the Nabob's own account, and published at Chepauk, his place of residence, to sixty lacs of pagodas, independent of the old debt, on which debt of sixty lacs of pagodas the Nabob did agree to pay an interest of twelve per cent per annum.--Being asked, Whether this debt was approved of by the Court of Directors? he said, He does not know it was.--Being asked, Whether the old debt was recognized by the Court of Directors? he said, Yes, it has been; and the Court of Directors have sent out repeated orders to the President and Council of Madras to <b>enforce</b> its <b>recovery</b> and payment.--Being asked, If the interest upon the new debt is punctually paid? he said, It was not during his residence at Madras, from 1777 to 1779, in which period he thinks no more than five per cent interest was paid, in different dividends of two and one per cent.--Being asked, What is the usual course taken by the Nabob concerning the arrears of interest? he said, Not having ever lent him moneys himself, he cannot fully answer as to the mode of settling the interest with him.|$|R
40|$|In its 1997 decision, Strahan v. Linnon, the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts summarily {{rejected}} {{the claims of}} Max Strahan, a whale enthusiast and citizen activist. Following two occasions upon which a United States Coast Guard vessel struck and killed an endangered Northern Right whale 2 ̆ 7 Strahan brought numerous claims, alleging various violations under the Endangered Species Act (ESA) and other relevant environmental statutes. The defendants, namely the United States Coast Guard and the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), were granted summary judgment on every count. Although the court 2 ̆ 7 s decision was reasonable in light of applicable case and statutory law, its inability to find any material issue of fact was perhaps unduly harsh. Strahan generally attacked {{the results of the}} ESA 2 ̆ 7 s section 7 consultation process, and the defendants 2 ̆ 7 dilatory, but on-going compliance efforts. The thrust of his grievance was that the defendants failed to adequately insure that the Northern Right whale will not be further jeopardized by the actions and inaction of the defendants. Due deference and findings of 2 ̆ 7 sufficiency 2 ̆ 7 and 2 ̆ 7 adequacy 2 ̆ 7 prevailed in the court 2 ̆ 7 s checklist of summary judgments. The court repeatedly offered less than effective arguments in support of its rulings. Departing somewhat from its stronger stance in the original suit, the court did not include any forceful language in its rulings and appeared content to leave matters to the discretion of the defendants. Rather than seizing an ample opportunity to flex the substantive might of the ESA conservation mandates, the court effectively relegated the statute to a series of procedural obstacles. The following discussion will focus on the court 2 ̆ 7 s handling of the ESA claims and will examine the potential of section 7 (a) (1) as a strong mechanism for promoting species conservation and <b>enforcing</b> species <b>recovery</b> planning...|$|R
