40|$|In {{order to}} prevent the {{containment}} and other safety relevant components from incurring serious damage caused by a detonation of the hydrogen/air-mixture generated during a severe accident in light water reactors (LWR) passive autocatalytic recombiners (PAR) are used for hydrogen removal in {{an increasing number of}} European plants. These devices make use of the fact that hydrogen and oxygen react exothermally on catalytic surfaces generating steam and heat. Experimental investigations at several research facilities indicate that existing PAR systems bear the risk of igniting the gaseous mixture due to an overheating of the catalyst elements caused by strong reaction heat generation. <b>Innovative</b> <b>devices</b> could overcome existing limitations making use of the knowledge deduced from experiments performed at the REKO facilities at Forschungszentrum Juelich (FZJ).

5000|$|The {{first product}} {{released}} by the new subsidiary was MG1212, a 12 channel, 12 track recorder in 1984. This <b>innovative</b> <b>device</b> used a special VHS-like cartridge (a MK-20), and was good for 10 minutes of continuous 12 track recording (19 cm per second) or 20 minutes at half speed (9.5 cm per second). One track (14) was permanently dedicated to recording absolute time, and another one for synchronization such as SMPTE or MTC. Each channel strip included dbx type-1 noise reduction and semi-parametric equalizers (with fixed bandwidths). The unit also had innovations like an electronic 2 bus system, a 12 stereo channel patch bay and auto punch in and out, among others. The unique transport design and noise reduction gave these units a recording quality rivaling that of more expensive 16 track machines using 1" [...] tape. The MG-1212 was later replaced by the MG-1214, which improved the transport mechanism and overall performance.|$|E
5000|$|David Danon {{arrived at}} Medical School of University of Geneva on December 31, 1946 {{late in the}} first {{semester}} pursuant to the agreement between his father and the British Mandate authorities, essentially exiling him from Palestine {{for the duration of the}} British Mandate. He arrived without any knowledge of the French language. Despite his late start in his first year of medical school and his having to learn the French language, he excelled. During his second year in medical school he began to do research. His research was published in the scientific literature between the years 1948 and 1950. One of his Important projects was the study of the structure of the human nervous system. The use of conventional microscopes for this work was an obstacle due to the limited resolution capability of the common optical microscope. In order to facilitate the use of the more sophisticated electron microscope it was necessary to cut thinner slices of tissue. Thus, David Danon developed the Microtome (a device for cutting extremely thin slices of tissue) for use on the electron microscope. The University of Geneva recognized David for his development of this <b>innovative</b> <b>device</b> by awarding him the [...] "best dissertation" [...] award.|$|E
5000|$|Varro: Unlike Cato, Marcus Terentius Varro {{was not a}} man {{of action}} but a scholar, a πολιγραφοτάτω, in the 1st century BC. Varro, whose studies were wider than Cato's, tried to combine the {{cosmopolitan}} Greek outlook with Rome's provincial traditions. In his book of agricultural advice Rerum Rusticarum de Agri Cultura Varro only twice reflects the reality of his times by mentioning threshing boards. He advises, [...] "None of the implements that can be produced in the plantation (farm) itself should be bought, as with almost all everything which is made from unfinished wood such as hampers, baskets, threshing boards, stakes, rakes…"; the inclination to self-sufficiency that he demonstrates here would later be harmful to Rome. Varro nonetheless shows himself more open to innovation that Cato: [...] "To achieve an abundant and high-quality harvest, the stalks should be taken to the threshing floor without piling them up, so the grain is in the best condition, and the grain (should be) separated from the stalks on the threshing floor, a process which is done, among other ways, with a pair of mules and a threshing board. This is made with a wooden board (with its underside) equipped with stone-chips or saws of iron, which, with a plow in front or a large counterweight, is pulled by a pair of mules yoked together and thus separates the grain from the stalks…". That is, he explains in a very didactic way how the threshing boards works and the advantages of this <b>innovative</b> <b>device.</b> Next, he talks about the variant called plostellum poenicum (=punicum=Punic=Carthaginian), a threshing implement with rollers and metallic saws whose origin is, as we have already seen, Carthaginian, and which was used in Hispania (which had, in the past, been controlled by Carthage): [...] "Another way to make it is by means of a cart with teethed rollers and bearings; this cart is named plostellum punicum, in which one can sit and move the device that is pulled by mules, as it is done in Hispania Citerior and other places." ...|$|E
