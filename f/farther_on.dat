5|$|The unmarked trailhead {{is on the}} green-marked trail {{leading up}} Velická Valley near the {{southern}} edge of the first plateau (Kvetnica) above the Sliezsky Dom. The equally unmarked, indistinct route to Gerlach veers off north-west towards the mountain's eastern slopes at the elevation of ca. , but occasional cairns begin to appear <b>farther</b> <b>on.</b> The fastest and easiest descent is down the Batizovská próba. Mountain guides always follow the route in the east-west direction, ascending from Velická Valley and descending into Batizovská Valley, in order to reduce logjams.|$|E
25|$|The main defences are {{entered a}} little <b>farther</b> <b>on</b> {{in the same}} line, through a {{projecting}} two-story building which has some fireplaces with very simple and late mouldings. The buildings are of the local basalt, and the masonry is rough rubble; there are, as is so frequently the case, no very clear indications for dating the different parts, which were in all probability erected at different times.|$|E
25|$|And {{a little}} beyond the {{sandstone}} conglomerate, a tufa has been formed, where it turned towards Castel Florentino; <b>farther</b> <b>on,</b> the mud was deposited {{in which the}} shells lived, and which rose in layers according to the levels at which the turbid Arno flowed into that sea. And {{from time to time}} {{the bottom of the sea}} was raised, depositing these shells in layers, as may be seen in the cutting at Colle Gonzoli, laid open by the Arno which is wearing away the base of it; in which cutting the said layers of shells are very plainly to be seen in clay of a bluish colour, and various marine objects are found there.|$|E

25|$|At Junction 8 a spur off the M40 with two-lane carriageways {{leaves the}} {{mainline}} of the motorway and continues {{for a few}} miles before ending (motorway restrictions ending) at a trumpet junction for Wheatley and the A418(A40) (the old junction 8), with the road continuing as a two lane dual carriageway as the A40 towards Oxford and <b>farther</b> <b>on</b> to Cheltenham and Wales. The spur can be accessed only via the M40 northbound, and traffic heading towards the M40 can join only the southbound carriageway. Traffic going {{in the other direction}} has to use the trumpet junction, and follow the A418 past Wheatley services. This short spur {{is the end of the}} original M40, prior to the building of the current Junction 8 and extension to Birmingham.|$|E
25|$|Ancient Tenedos is {{referred}} to in Greek and Roman mythology, and archaeologists have uncovered evidence of its settlement from the Bronze Age. It would stay prominent through the age of classical Greece, fading {{by the time of}} the dominance of ancient Rome. Although a small island, Tenedos's position in the straits and its two harbors made it important to the Mediterranean powers over the centuries. For nine months of the year, the currents and the prevailing wind, the Etesian, came, and still come, from the Black Sea hampering sailing vessels headed for Constantinople. They had to wait a week or more at Tenedos, waiting for the favorable southerly wind. Tenedos thus served as a shelter and way station for ships bound for the Hellespont, Propontis, Bosphorus, and places <b>farther</b> <b>on.</b> Several of the regional powers captured or attacked the island, including the Athenians, the Persians, the Macedonians under Alexander the Great, the Seleucids and the Attalids.|$|E
500|$|The next day, as {{the seas}} {{battered}} {{the ship and}} drove her <b>farther</b> <b>on</b> the rocks, two Coast Guard boats took 31 men from the ship. American-Hawaiian announced that a Los Angeles salvage firm had been hired to retrieve the [...] cargo, which included explosives and oil. Two heavy-duty electric pumps were lowered to the ship via the breeches buoy, and plans were drawn up for connecting them to the San Francisco municipal electric system in order to pump out the ship.|$|E

500|$|Like a 19th-century {{comment in}} a British guidebook, [...] "impressive and picturesque", modern hikers usually {{appreciate}} the {{panoramic view of}} the highest and many other peaks in the High Tatras, from Kriváň {{in the west to}} Široká in the north and Lomnický štít in the east. <b>Farther</b> <b>on,</b> but often visible, are the eastern Low Tatras in the south and part of the Belianske Tatras in the east. Better than usual visibility, a rare occurrence except in the fall and winter, is needed to see the Stolické vrchy, Volovské vrchy, the Slovak Paradise region, and Branisko. Quite exceptionally, visibility may extend to the Austrian Alps and the Polish–Czech Giant Mountains hundreds of miles away.|$|E
500|$|As {{the range}} closed the Allies became easy {{targets for the}} Franco-Bavarian musket- and grape-shot; the {{confusion}} exacerbated by fizzing hand-grenades thrown down the slope by the defenders. To aid their assault, each Allied soldier carried a bundle of fascines (earlier cut from the Boschberg wood), with which to bridge the ditches {{in front of the}} breastworks to speed their passage. However, the fascines were mistakenly thrown into a dry gully– formed by the recent summer rains– instead of the Bavarians' defensive trench about 45 m (50yards) <b>farther</b> <b>on.</b> Nevertheless, the Allies continued to push forward, joining battle with the Bavarians in savage hand-to-hand fighting. Behind the defences the Elector's Guards and la Colonie's men bore the brunt of the attack so that, [...] "The little parapet which separates the two forces became the scene of the bloodiest struggle that could be conceived." [...] But the assault failed to penetrate the defences, and the Allies were forced to fall back to their lines. General Johan Wijnand van Goor, a favourite of Marlborough who had led the attack, numbered among the Allied fatalities.|$|E
2500|$|By 12:00, {{the initial}} {{objectives}} {{had been reached}} and the attack was held up to allow reorganization and to reestablish contact between units. After a short time, the attack started forward again toward the final objective some [...] <b>farther</b> <b>on.</b> A further artillery barrage was called {{down in front of}} the advancing Marines and 81mm mortars covered the advance. As this movement began again, the Japanese called in their own mortars to seek out the American crews; the infantry attack continued, while overhead supporting and defensive fire was exchanged.|$|E

2500|$|After {{the short}} bend where it crosses the Wyoming County line, NY19 bends {{slightly}} to the west as it comes into the hamlet of Pike [...] to the north. The hamlet itself does not present any major intersections; however, NY19 meets NY39, the main eastwest road across southern Wyoming County, northeast of the hamlet. The two routes overlap for just over [...] before NY19 {{turns back to the}} north and heads across mostly open fields to the next village, Gainesville, a few miles (kilometers) <b>farther</b> <b>on.</b> Again the intersecting state highway is displaced {{to the north of the}} village, where NY78 heads off to the west despite being signed as a north–south route.|$|E
2500|$|J5 {{is for the}} A40 and Stokenchurch, a basic diamond {{interchange}} and the fourth junction of the M40 with the A40. [...] <b>farther</b> <b>on</b> the motorway passes through a large cutting (Stokenchurch Gap), known locally as [...] "The Canyon", enters Oxfordshire and reaches J6 with the B4009 for Lewknor, Watlington, and Chinnor. The junction is a variant on the {{diamond interchange}}, with the slip roads from the M40 south having sharp bends— upon leaving the M40 from the westbound carriageway there is an immediate turn of almost 90° {{to the left and}} shortly after a sharp 90° turn to the right before a junction with the B4009, and similarly when entering the London-bound M40.|$|E
2500|$|The {{junction}} {{is completed}} [...] <b>farther</b> <b>on</b> at Junction 14, another restricted access junction, {{with access to}} the A452 from the southbound M40, and the access on to the motorway is in a northbound direction. The slip roads join at a roundabout and carry on as the single carriageway A452 to meet with the A452 to Leamington Spa, A425 to Warwick, and the A452 to J13. A few hundred yards further up is junction 15, known as Longbridge island. This is a large, regular roundabout interchange, and is always busy during peak times due to the various destinations it serves, including The Cotswolds, Stratford-upon-Avon, Coventry, and Warwick. Farther north, Henley-in-Arden (J16) is again 'incomplete' to discourage local traffic.|$|E

Junction 7 is a restricted junction with the A329 serving Thame and the A40. Access is limited allowing exit for only northbound traffic and entry only for southbound traffic. The exiting slip road on the southbound M40 at J7 is for [...] "Works Traffic Only" [...] to a depot. A slip road exists to allow traffic from the A329 to join the M40 north but is closed to traffic by a gate: this traffic must therefore follow the A40 to Junction 8, [...] to the north.|$|E
2500|$|As Washington rode forward, he was {{surprised}} to see Lee's division retreating toward him, led by Grayson's and Patton's Additional Regiments. The men were suffering badly from the intense heat of the day. <b>Farther</b> <b>on,</b> Washington and Lee patched together a line consisting of Jeremiah Olney's brigade, detachments under Walter Stewart, Nathaniel Ramsey, and Henry Livingston Jr., and Oswald's four guns. It is likely that Wood's Virginians (though not Grayson's Regiment) were part of this force. After a fierce action, the British broke through, but the holding action allowed enough time for Washington's main body to form a line of battle. Except for two New Jersey regiments and Cilley's and Parker's detachments, Lee's division was sent to the rear to reorganize.|$|E
2500|$|Later, {{the more}} risqué humour of Pete and Dud went <b>farther</b> <b>on</b> long-playing records as [...] "Derek and Clive".

One of these audio recordings was also filmed and tensions between the duo are seen to rise. Chris Blackwell circulated bootleg copies to friends in the music business. The popularity of the recording convinced Cook to release it commercially, although Moore was initially reluctant, fearing that his rising fame as a Hollywood star would be undermined. Two further Derek and Clive albums were released, the last accompanied by a film.|$|E
