5000|$|TX {{unmanned}} glider is an unpowered unmanned paraglider {{intended for}} <b>emergency</b> communication <b>relay</b> in situations such as post disaster relief. Specification: ...|$|R
50|$|Communications specialists also {{coordinate}} <b>emergency</b> medical <b>relays</b> {{across the}} state using aircraft and ground units, and monitor alarms and warning systems, such as those issued by the National Weather Service and local emergency managers.|$|R
50|$|KWVE-FM is the Local Primary {{station of}} the Emergency Alert System (EAS) for Orange County, meaning that all radio {{stations}} and cable systems in the area must <b>relay</b> <b>emergency</b> information and Required Monthly Tests from KWVE-FM, when activated.|$|R
50|$|Chester now has Channel 10 through Cable TV. It {{broadcasts}} events, post announcements and upcoming community events, <b>relays</b> <b>emergency</b> notices {{and much}} more {{to the citizens of}} Chester. Students from the Chester Grade School contribute daily broadcasts from the school.|$|R
50|$|Stations are {{required}} by federal law to <b>relay</b> <b>Emergency</b> Action Notification (EAN) messages immediately (47 CFR Part 11.54). Stations traditionally {{have been allowed to}} opt out of relaying other alerts such as severe weather, and child abduction emergencies (AMBER Alerts) if they so choose.|$|R
50|$|GC-M4R is a quadcopter {{developed}} by Carvedge, and {{the landing gear}} consists {{of a pair of}} skids. GC-M4R is originally intended for aerial surveillance and maintenance of power lines and pipe lines. Navigation is provided by GPS and the UAV is electrically powered. GC-M4R {{is one of the first}} Chinese UAV intended for aerial patrol for power and pipe lines to have night capability, because the payload integrates infrared camera for night operations. Since its successful deployment by the local utility companies, the missions of GC-M4R has expanded to other arenas such as applications for law enforcement, one of which is to be used as an <b>emergency</b> aerial communication <b>relay</b> station after disaster struck. A unique feature to fulfill this mission is that the design incorporates an extension line directly from the ground station to the UAV to provide the power needed for prolonged howering when acting as an <b>emergency</b> communication <b>relay</b> station, because the batter power of the UAV itself does not last long enough for the prolonged mission.|$|R
50|$|The system officially {{launched}} on June 10, 2010 and is legally backed by the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC), who enacted a mandate in August 2014 for broadcasters and broadcast distribution undertakings in Canada to <b>relay</b> <b>emergency</b> messages that are distributed through Alert Ready as of March 31, 2015.|$|R
5000|$|Callers to 106 {{are asked}} to type PPP for police, FFF for fire or AAA for ambulance. The relay officer will then call the <b>emergency</b> service and <b>relay</b> the call. An able caller can also just say [...] "police", [...] "fire" [...] or [...] "ambulance" [...] to the relay officer.|$|R
25|$|Since the 1950s {{the units}} were {{equipped}} with radios in the 4m frequency band, handheld units {{work in the}} 2m band. This analog radio usage is protected by law for <b>emergency</b> use only. <b>Relay</b> stations cover whole Germany. With entering the appropriate channel, every radio can reach another dispatch center or agency.|$|R
30|$|The {{essence of}} the {{security}} emergency control in Chinese power system is the three lines of defense [12, 13]. In the process of <b>emergency</b> control, <b>relaying</b> protection and security control operate independently, perform their own functions and their function cannot replace each other. It is worth attention {{that there are two}} basic principles in the security emergency control: the necessity for failure clearing and the priority of failure clearing. This is the duty and responsibilities of relaying protection and WARP. The fault clearing is the premise of effective security control. So the function of backup protection cannot be replaced by security control [3].|$|R
50|$|The {{station is}} also the primary Emergency Alert System (EAS) station {{for the state of}} Michigan, <b>relaying</b> <b>emergency</b> {{messages}} from the Michigan State Police to all media outlets in Michigan; WKAR-FM hosts statewide tests twice a year. WKAR-FM {{is also the}} secondary EAS station for Lansing and the South Central Michigan region (WFMK is the primary station for the region).|$|R
50|$|Evacuation Immediate (SAME CODE: EVI) is {{a warning}} created by the National Weather Service meant to replace the {{issuance}} of Civil Emergency Messages, Fire Warnings, and other warnings {{for the purpose of}} evacuations. Evacuations are issued by a public official such as a City police office, State Office, or county <b>emergency</b> management, and <b>relayed</b> by the NWS with the Emergency Alert System (EAS) tone and SAME heading.|$|R
50|$|KEUL is a {{non-commercial}} {{radio station}} in Girdwood, Alaska, broadcasting on 88.9 FM. The station originally began as a non-licensed station, during a proliferation of such in the Anchorage area during the 1990s. Pressure from the Girdwood community {{in the wake of}} its impending shutdown, particularly from community leaders who recognized the need for a means to <b>relay</b> <b>emergency</b> information, led to its reinvention as a licensed station.|$|R
50|$|In {{development}} since 2010, {{the system}} {{officially launched on}} March 31, 2015; the system is legally backed by the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC), who enacted a mandate in August 2014 for all broadcasters and broadcast distribution undertakings in Canada to <b>relay</b> <b>emergency</b> messages that are distributed through NAAD as of that date. Beginning April 6, 2018, wireless providers will also be required to participate, utilizing a Canadian variant of the Wireless Emergency Alerts framework utilized in the United States.|$|R
50|$|Law Enforcement Warning (SAME CODE: LEW) is {{a warning}} created by the National Weather Service meant to replace the {{issuance}} of Civil Emergency Messages and Civil Danger Warnings {{for the purpose of}} bomb explosions, jailbreaks, riots, or other criminal events. Law Enforcement Warnings are issued by a public official such as a police office, or county <b>emergency</b> management, and <b>relayed</b> by the NWS with the Emergency Alert System (EAS) tone and SAME heading. During a Law Enforcement Warning, an authorized law enforcement agency may blockade roads, waterways, or facilities, evacuate or deny access to affected areas, and arrest violators or suspicious persons.|$|R
50|$|Originally, the E-6A {{was built}} to perform the TAke Charge And Move Out (TACAMO) mission of <b>relaying</b> <b>Emergency</b> Action Messages to Navy Ballistic Missile Submarines in the Atlantic and Pacific oceans. However, when {{it was decided to}} retire the {{remainder}} of the Air Force’s EC-135C fleet, the E-6A was extensively modified. A battlestaff compartment was added, additional communications equipment was installed, and ALCS equipment was installed. Due to these extensive modifications, this new variant of the Mercury was redesignated from the E-6A to the E-6B. Now, whenever a USSTRATCOM battlestaff and ALCS crew are onboard, the E-6B is known as the USSTRATCOM ABNCP.|$|R
50|$|The {{development}} of Gsafety UAVs rooted {{back in the}} realization of the need to provide aerial platform for disaster prevention and relief effort, because the ground-based communication system might be destroyed by natural disasters. In comparison to reconstructed ground communication stations, an aerial platform provides a temporary communication relay stations for mobile ground units in much rapid response time. Gsafety evaluated possible options and concluded that an unmanned blimp is best suited to meet the requirement. One of the most important requirement of an aerial platform of communication relay station is to be stationary while airborne, and in comparison to unmanned helicopters and multirotors, blimps can meet such requirement at much lower cost while having much longer endurance. Gsafety therefore developed a series of unmanned blimps for <b>emergency</b> communication <b>relaying,</b> aerial surveillance and other missions. As of end of 2013, two of Gsafety unmanned blimps have been deployed by Chinese law enforcement and governmental agencies, including a man portable version and a larger version. In addition, a stationary balloon has been developed for the same purpose.|$|R
50|$|The 92nd through 100th {{floors are}} officially {{designated}} as communication floors, although it's unknown {{if there are}} any radio or TV stations currently broadcasting from the top of Taipei 101. The 91st-floor observatory is the highest floor that is open to the public, but unlike the leased/private floors from 7~90F, {{there is no sign of}} even a visible access point to the topmost floors on Level 91. The top 10 floors are to have stated on their website to contain a radio and television <b>relay</b> station, <b>Emergency</b> system receiving/signaling <b>relay</b> station, telecommunications stations, and an outdoor antenna frame on 96F, which offers power, fire protection, telecom systems, and security related systems, according to their website.|$|R
5000|$|HST-120 Fortification is a {{gasoline}} powered fixed wing UAV in twin boom layout with low wing configuration and tricycle landing gear. HST-120 Fortification adopts winglets and its twin tail are connected at the top, instead of middle or bottom, {{as in most}} UAV in twin boom layout. Propulsion is provided by a two-blade propeller driven pusher engine mounted at the rear end of the fuselage. HST-120 Fortification is initially designed specially as an aerial communication relay station for UAV ground control stations to extend the control range of UAVs, and this is achieved by incorporating a large antenna array in the circular disk shaped radome installed below the fuselage. The UAV can be deployed for other communication relay missions such as <b>emergency</b> aerial communication <b>relay</b> station immediately after disaster in disaster relief efforts.

25|$|Telenor {{operates}} five manned coast radio stations: Tjøme Radio in Horten, Rogaland Radio in Sola, Florø Radio, Bodø Radio and Vardø Radio. Rogaland and Bodø {{are physically}} co-located with the respective joint rescue coordination center. The border between Tjøme and Rogaland Radios goes at Søgne, between Rogaland and Florø Radios at Fedje, between Florø and Bodø Radios at Vikna, and between Bodø and Vardø Radios at Tromsø. The coast radio stations {{are responsible for}} listening to the <b>emergency</b> channels and <b>relaying</b> relevant information to the JRCCs, issue safety and navigational warnings, alert other vessels of distress situations and manage medical advice and commercial communications. Coast stations can also be reached via mobile telephones where there is service. The stations handled 4,189 resistances in 2012, consisting of 2,402 commercial vessels, 1,321 recreational boats, 348 fishing vessels and 118 others.|$|R
50|$|As an {{integral}} part of the international search and rescue satellite program called COSPAS-SARSAT, NOAA operates the Search and Rescue Satellite Aided Tracking (SARSAT) System to detect and locate mariners, aviators and other recreational users in distress almost anywhere in the world at any time and under almost any conditions. This system uses a network of satellites to detect and locate distress signals from emergency beacons onboard aircraft, vessels and from handheld personal locator beacons (PLB). The SARSAT transponder on the GOES-16 satellite will provide the capability to immediately detect distress signals from <b>emergency</b> beacons and <b>relay</b> them to ground stations - called Local User Terminals. In turn, this signal is routed to a SARSAT Mission Control Center and then sent to a Rescue Coordination Center which dispatches a search and rescue team to the location of the distress.|$|R

30|$|In the future, VANETs will {{decrease}} road accidents by providing real-time information about traffic and road status to drivers [9]. The {{public key infrastructure}} (PKI) has been developed for VANETs’ security. The PKI concentrates on data integrity and authentication schemes. It provides traditional solutions for VANETs’ communication [11]. The certificate authorities (CAs) are responsible for maintaining credentials of vehicles in network [7, 12]. However, in V 2 V communication node, misbehaviour may propagate false messages, where a single malicious node may disturb the whole network [13]. False messages in VANETs can create many issues like higher time required to reach destination, more fuel consumption, higher pollution and traffic accidents [6, 14]. The <b>emergency</b> messages are <b>relayed</b> in multi-hop fashion in the network. Bandwidth may become limited due to broadcasting of false messages. There must be some mechanisms to detect and avoid these false messages [3]. A malicious vehicle can broadcast false position information in the network that has adverse consequences in safety applications [15 – 20]. VANETs’ routing, safety application, traffic management and data aggregation rely on correct vehicle position information [21, 22].|$|R
5000|$|Various {{attempts}} {{had been}} made in the 21st century to establish a public alert system in Canada, by both departments of government and by television broadcasters. In 2001, Pelmorex, owners of The Weather Network and its French language counterpart MétéoMédia, applied to the CRTC for an amendment to their licenses to encompass a mandatory [...] "All Channel Alert" [...] system, requiring all television providers to <b>relay</b> <b>emergency</b> messages on behalf of governments across all of their channels. The service would have used proprietary hardware developed by Pelmorex, and would have been funded primarily by a $0.13 increase in carriage fees for the two channels. However, its initial proposal was denied by the CRTC, citing the need for consultation with broadcasters, television providers, and other parties on how the system would be designed, along with its costs. Establishment of such a system in a voluntary form was also hampered by CRTC rules at the time, which required television providers to obtain consent from broadcasters before they could overlay emergency notifications onto their programming.|$|R
40|$|As UAV {{capabilities}} {{continue to}} improve the technology will spill {{out of the military}} sector and into commercial and civil applications. Already, UAVs have demonstrated commercial marketability in such diverse areas as scientific and environmental research, cross-seas shipping, communications <b>relays,</b> <b>emergency</b> management, border monitoring, agriculture, and aerial photography. Small-scale tactical UAVs in particular have an enormous potential to fulfill a number of roles within urban centers, transforming the way civil safety institutions carry out their jobs. A lack of established flight regulations is currently the greatest barrier to the standardized use of these vehicles. While the United States is currently the world's leader in UAV manufacturing, this position is tenuous given strong competitive threats from a variety of foreign countries who are already ahead in establishing a standardized regulatory environment for UAVs. As part of a larger research effort focused on the design, implementation, and demonstration of highly maneuverable rotorcraft UAVs, the primary objective of this work is to examine how UAVs might gain access to and function safely in civil and commercial markets. Despite the wide variety of existing UAVs in terms of size, targeted flight altitude, and capability, this work focuses primarily on small-scale tactical vehicles with the intended purpose of operating in and around urban centers. Operational requirements and risk mitigation strategies can be devised and effectively implemented to allow such UAVs to be operated at an acceptable level of risk. By combining GIS data manipulation with modem approaches to path-planning, UAVs can be operated such that the risk to the general public and urban infrastructure isminimized. Instead of focusing on vehicle reliability requirements which severely limit present-day experimentation and development of UAVs, efforts which focus on operational strategies allow for applications of the technology to be explored while the systems continue to grow more reliable. Public-private coalitions should expand their efforts beyond high altitude, long endurance UAVs to establish operating regulations for all of the vehicle classifications. The diversity of UAVs should be treated with an equally diverse set of regulations tuned to the particular requirements and risk management issues each classification represents. Finally, local and national government should recognize civil UAVs not only as a new commercial industry of great potential, but also as a latent threat to domestic security for which regulations should be established sooner rather than later. by Kara Lynn Sprague.
