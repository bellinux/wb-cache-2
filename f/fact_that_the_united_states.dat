The gold standard was seen as the only possible choice, and many people assumed that the United States was on that standard, which had been adopted by strong nations like the United Kingdom (1816) and the German Empire (1871).|$|E
5|$|After {{some notable}} successes and some early {{failures}} in the 1920s, the League ultimately proved incapable of preventing aggression by the Axis powers in the 1930s. The credibility of the organization was somewhat weakened by the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States</b> never officially joined the League and the Soviet Union joined late and only briefly. Germany withdrew from the League, as did Japan, Italy, Spain, and others. The onset of the Second World War showed that the League had failed its primary purpose, which was to prevent any future world war. The League lasted for 26 years; the United Nations (UN) replaced it {{after the end of}} the Second World War and inherited several agencies and organisations founded by the League.|$|E

25|$|Since {{the end of}} the Cold War, India-USA {{relations}} have improved dramatically. This has largely been fostered by the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States</b> and India are both democracies and have a large and growing trade relationship. During the Gulf War, the economy of India went through an extremely difficult phase. The Government of India adopted liberalised economic systems. After the break-up of the Soviet Union, India improved diplomatic relations with the members of the NATO particularly Canada, France and Germany. In 1992, India established formal diplomatic relations with Israel.|$|E
25|$|However, in Kern-Limerick, Inc. v. Scurlock, 347 U.S. 110 (1954), the Supreme Court {{held that}} when a {{contractor}} was merely the federal government's purchasing agent, the legal incidence of the tax fell on the United States and hence the tax was invalid. Further rulings by the Supreme Court, however, indicated that Kern-Limerick has extremely limited implications for Supremacy Clause jurisprudence and the ruling {{is limited to the}} facts in that case. States countered by imposing use taxes on corporations instead, and the Supreme Court upheld such taxes in United States v. Boyd, 378 U.S. 39 (1964.) The Court also held in United States v. California, 507 U.S. 746 (1993), that the mere <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States</b> reimburses a contractor for payment of state taxes does not violate the legal incidence test.|$|E
50|$|With the Conservatives {{wiped out}} of the {{legislature}} the Liberals formed the opposition from 1921 to 1926 confined to the cities of Calgary and Edmonton. The Liberals were helped by <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> Farmers did not typically run candidates in the cities. From 1926 to 1940 there was no official opposition leader due to a Speaker's ruling <b>that</b> divided <b>the</b> Official Opposition funding between all the party leaders.

50|$|Dried {{vine fruit}} {{is a term}} given to all the {{varieties}} of dried grape produced. The need for this term came from <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> Kingdom is <b>the</b> only country in the European Union which differentiates dried vine fruit into different types. On mainland Europe, they are all simply called raisins, whereas in the UK they are differentiated into raisins, sultanas and currants.

500|$|In 1984, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) {{deregulated}} commercial {{restrictions on}} children's television.

[...] Disagreements between the United States and its European allies over when and how to use air power [...] "made intra-alliance diplomacy more problematic" [...] during the period. [...] Many of these problems in the relationship were the result of concerns from European nations who had forces on the ground in UNPROFOR that might be taken hostage.

5000|$|The {{issue of}} the veto power of the {{permanent}} members of the Security Council proved to be an obstacle to reach agreement on <b>the</b> <b>United</b> Nations Charter.

Therefore, they wanted to reduce the scope of the veto.

2500|$|On June 12, 2008, Justice Kennedy {{delivered}} the opinion for the 5–4 majority, holding that the prisoners {{had a right}} to the writ of habeas corpus under the United States Constitution and that the Military Commissions Act of 2006 was an unconstitutional suspension of that right. The Court applied the Insular Cases, by the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States,</b> by virtue of its complete jurisdiction and control, maintains de facto sovereignty over this territory, while Cuba retained ultimate sovereignty over the territory, to hold that the aliens detained as enemy combatants on that territory were entitled to the writ of habeas corpus protected in Article I, Section 9 of the U.S. Constitution. The lower court had expressly indicated that no constitutional rights (not merely the right to habeas) extend to the Guantanamo detainees, rejecting petitioners' arguments, but the Supreme Court held that fundamental rights afforded by the Constitution extend to the Guantanamo detainees as well. Invoking Marbury v. Madison (1803), the Court concluded: [...] "The Nation’s basic charter cannot be contracted away like this. The Constitution grants Congress and the President the power to acquire, dispose of, and govern territory, not the power to decide when and where its terms apply.

2500|$|Early {{proposals}} pursuing an unrefined form {{of sovereign}} association {{emerged during the}} 1880s and 1920s, but failed to gain an immediate foothold. The current territorial Commonwealth status is the consequence of its architect's inability to implement his original vision. When first proposed by Resident Commissioner Antonio Fernós-Isern, the concept was akin {{to a form of}} sovereign free association such as the one found in the Commonwealth realms. In 1950, Fernós used his function as Resident Commissioner to influence a process held between March 30 and July 3, that ended with the approval of Public Law 600, which allowed Puerto Rico to draft its own Constitution and adopt a new political system. He expected that by adopting this law, the control that the United States retained would only be considered a form of trusteeship, with sovereignty being partially split between both sides due to voluntary relegation, in line with the United Nations Trusteeship Council. At the moment Fernós expected that the territorial clause would not apply after reclaiming sovereignty, due to the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States</b> never incorporated Puerto Rico. During the original negotiation process in Congress, Fernós was aware that several key elements of his project were being removed, but opted to focus on its initial approval, believing {{that he would not be}} able to accomplish everything at once. Under these arguments, the adoption of Law 600 was approved on June 5, 1951. The name of Estado Libre Asociado (lit. [...] "Associated Free State") was adopted as the official Spanish name, while the official English name avoided naming any form of association or freedom, simply being called [...] "Commonwealth".|$|E

50|$|It {{is widely}} held <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Wexford Rebellion was fuelled by sectarian {{tensions}} {{added to the}} British government's reign of terror which included pitchcapping, public executions, and the burning of homes. However, throughout the rebellion, prominent rebels advocated <b>that</b> <b>the</b> rebellion was purely political and not an issue of religion. Although some massacres <b>that</b> occurred throughout <b>the</b> duration of the rebellion do suggest sectarian tensions as motives, <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> Irishmen were both Protestant and Catholic {{in addition to the}} republic formed in county Wexford suggests that this rebellion was indeed political.
