THE LEGAL ACTION THE BANK CARRIES OUT WHEN THE INSURED VIOLATES THE <b>GUARANTEE</b> <b>BANK</b> AGREEMENT (A STUDY IN THE SURAKARTA MAIN BRANCH OF PT BANK NEGARA INDONESIA). Faculty of Law of Sebelas Maret University. This {{research}} aims to {{find out}} the procedure of giving <b>bank</b> the <b>guarantee</b> carried out by the Surakarta main branch of PT Bank Negara Indonesia as well as the legal action carried out by the Surakarta main branch of PT Bank Negara Indonesia when the insured violates the <b>guarantee</b> <b>bank</b> agreement. This writing belongs to an empirical law research that is descriptive in nature. The data type employed was primary and secondary data. The secondary data source included primary, secondary and tertiary data. Techniques of collecting data used were interview and library study. Technique of analyzing data used was an interactive model of analysis, in which the data collected would be then analyzed using 3 (three) stages: data reduction, data display and conclusion drawing. Considering the result of research and discussion, it can be concluded that firstly, the Procedure of giving <b>bank</b> <b>guarantee</b> in the Surakarta main branch of PT Bank Negara Indonesia can be divided into 2 (two) types: <b>bank</b> <b>guarantee</b> giving with full cover collateral and <b>bank</b> <b>guarantee</b> giving with non-full cover collateral. <b>Guarantee</b> <b>bank</b> with full cover collateral means that the collateral {{is in the form of}} account. Meanwhile the <b>guarantee</b> <b>bank</b> with non-full cover guarantee means it is guaranteed with the customer’s account and asset as included in the <b>Guarantee</b> <b>Bank</b> Publication Agreement (PPGB). The <b>guarantee</b> <b>bank</b> publication by the Surakarta main branch of PT Bank Negara Indonesia governed in the Guidelines and Policy of Retail Market Credit has been consistent with the conditions of <b>guarantee</b> <b>bank</b> publication included in the Decree of Indonesian Bank Director Board Number 11 / 110 /Kep. /Dir/UPBB about the Collateral Giving by Bank and Collateral Giving by the Non-Bank financial institution as well as Bank of Indonesia’s Circular Number: SE 11 / 11 concerning the Collateral Giving by Bank and Collateral Giving by Non-Bank Financial Institution.

However, the most vulnerable individuals and small enterprises in Germany tend to be excluded or credit constrained. The quality of financial inclusion is impaired by a low level of financial literacy, which is also concentrated among specific population subgroups. The high level of financial inclusion can be attributed to relationship lending by public savings banks, credit cooperatives, public promotional banks, and <b>guarantee</b> <b>banks</b> using the "housebank" model, and financial consumer protection and credit reporting regulations and institutions. Programs involving microfinance institutions have been stopped. Financial inclusion of consumers with the aim of responsible finance may be improved by implementing the right to a basic bank account with an overdraft facility and protection against attachment, establishing public credit bureaus, redirecting banking regulation toward the protection of borrowers in long-term credit relationships, and strengthening financial education in schools.

30|$|The {{financial}} crisis of 2008 reaffirmed {{the need to}} monitor risk in the banking sector as it has a ripple effect on the overall economy. The insolvency of most financial outfits {{at that time was}} as a result of increasing amounts of capital invested into long term and risky assets especially in the real estate market (Cannata and Quagliariello 2009; Brusov et al. 2015). Now more than ever, matters of subprime lending and the relevance of maintaining adequate capital to absorb adverse market conditions have become very important to bank managers and financial regulators (Erkens et al. 2012; Flannery 2014). Policy makers have recommended changes to already existing coordinated regulation to avert the probability of such occurrence in future. These changes include, significant increment in Capital to Risk (Weighted) Assets Ratio (CRAR) which is dependent on both the capital required and the capital resources to meet the requirements (Hasan et al. 2015). As a step in that direction, this paper’s primary aim is to use an asset-liability modeling approach via optimization techniques based on the CRAR to <b>guarantee</b> <b>banks</b> of meeting the stipulated regulation of Basel III with great likelihood irrespective of changes in forward market value of assets.|$|E

40|$|In Kenya, rarely {{are cases}} {{concerning}} data security breaches on commercial banks reported or documented. This does not however {{mean that there}} are no such cases or that the information systems used by the commercial banks are completely secure. In as much as due diljgeoce d gross assessment of usage, vulnerability, security and recovery of the systems adopted y these banks is done before their adoption, it is worth to note that the human brain has remained superior to computers, implying therefore that the information stored within these information systems is not fool proof and that there do exist risks of manipulation of their data by rogue and systematic users. Further, limited study has been carried out to determine factors that influence data security in the Information systems used by the banks. Occurrence of a breach in data security is unpredictable and as such, informed defence against their occurrence is critical. It is against this backdrop that this study seeks to establish the factors that influence data security in commercial banks. The objective {{of the study was to}} determine the factors that influence data security in the management information systems used by commercial banks in Nairobi, Kenya. The study will adopt a cross-sectional survey in which different banks will be studied. Primary data was collected using a questionnaire while an extensive literature review has been done using various secondary sources. The target population was the information security staff working in the headquarters of commercial banks located in Nairobi. A census for all the banks in Nairobi was carried out and the study targeted two respondents per bank, at two strata; one senior IT manager and a general IT technician. Questionnaires were distributed at all the bank's headquarters and collected after a period of seven days. Introduction correspondence were done through email to all the bank's human resource department which were requested to allocate two random respondents. The data collected was thereafter coded andentered into SPSS and analysed using descriptive statistics and Pearson correlation. Out of 86 questionnaires distributed 66 were successfully completed and refilmed by respondents from 34 commercial banks, giving questionnaire response rate of 76. 721 - : The results indicates thattype of data increases chances of breach attempts. The amount of data is strongly positively correlated with data integrity and network security. The study also established that customers have contributed to cases of fraud due to poor handling of their data. Majority of respondents indicated that their organization have experienced frauds through use of hostile technology e. g. ATM skimming. From the research findings, it can be concluded that type and size of data, user knowledge and hostile technology does influence data integrity and network security. The research therefore concludes that both sufficient financial and human resources should be deployed by the commercial banks to deal with data security. This study identifies key factors in banks data that might compromise data security with a view to educating the stewards of banks influencing their direction of designing systems to <b>guarantee</b> <b>banks</b> data integrity and network security. The research recommends that for the integrity of the data and network security the top management should support effective training,skill up-grading and awareness mechanisms to bank employees that would respond and continuously adapt to emerging technological challenges in the bank's MIS infrastructure.

40|$|ABSTRACT <b>Bank</b> <b>{{guarantee}}</b> or Independent guarantee is {{a contract}} or a document whereby the issuer (guarantor), upon {{the request of}} the applicant (principal), is committed against the beneficiary (guaranteed side) that on demand or at a certain maturity, without any stipulation to pay a certain amount of cash for a specific issue which is related to the beneficiary or to the order of him/her. According to this definition about the legal nature of <b>bank</b> <b>guarantees,</b> one can consider four perspectives: Some have considered this banking document as a justification for civil liability conclusion stipulated in Article 684 of the Civil Code. However, some other group believe that the nature of <b>banking</b> <b>guarantees</b> can be justified in accordance with articles 402 - 411 of Commerce Act. Another group consider <b>bank</b> <b>guarantees</b> as <b>bank’s</b> unilateral commitment against the beneficiary and another group believe that guarantee issuance is dependent on a contract between guarantee applicant and guarantor bank accord-ing to which a provision shall be specified in favor of the third party namely the beneficiary. Nevertheless, after criticism and analysis of reasons of supporters for any of the opinions, we conclude that <b>bank</b> <b>guarantees</b> are private contracts set forth in Article 10 of Civil Code. But in recent trade bill, the legislator had a tendency towards a condition to consider and interpret <b>bank</b> <b>guarantees</b> as subsets of certain contracts stipulated in Commercial Code.
