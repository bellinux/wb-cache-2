30|$|In {{order to}} clarify that our {{observations}} (Braga et al. 2017) of the transfer on discharge of a lithium anode to the cathode conforms {{to the laws of}} thermodynamics, the First Law of Thermodynamics for a closed and an open system is rehearsed (The first law of thermodynamics); the electrode/electrolyte interfaces introduce applied forces that perform work on the mobile charges of a cell. Therefore, although a battery cell is a closed system, it contains three open systems, the two electrodes and the electrolyte. Our thermodynamic analysis provides quantitative predictions of our observed voltages for a cell with a sulfur relay. Moreover, it is illustrated how the electric-double-layer capacitors (EDLCs) are formed at the electrode/electrolyte interfaces in order to <b>equalize</b> <b>the</b> <b>electrochemical</b> potentials of the two materials at an interface. In Section “Experimental”, additional experimental data corroborating plating on the positive electrode of an asymmetric cell in a discharge at a finite voltage is provided. In addition, it is shown how the electrochemical potentials of the phases and elements in each phase vary in a mixture depending of the surrounding contacting-phase. Examples from the literature of plating of an alkali-metal negative electrode on the positive electrode at a finite voltage are cited, observations that were neither utilized nor fully understood.|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} an {{alternative}} approach to the modelling of plates {{with a large number}} of holes is presented. By means of plate theory, it is shown that perforated plates can be modelled by conventional orthotropic plates with modified elastic properties. The modification of the elastic constants is derived by <b>equalizing</b> <b>the</b> strain-energy of the perforated and the orthotropic plate. The model obtained is then compared with previous methods and applied in <b>the</b> <b>electrochemical</b> simulation of a silicon micromachined microphone structure. The microphone structures are simulated numerically, using an algorithm based on finite differences...|$|R
