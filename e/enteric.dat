5|$|All {{emissions}} from all sources will have obligations. This includes {{emissions from}} biological {{sources such as}} methane from <b>enteric</b> fermentation and nitrous oxide from animal effluent.|$|E
5|$|Agricultural emissions, methane from <b>enteric</b> {{fermentation}} and {{manure management}} {{as well as}} nitrous oxide from animal effluent and fertiliser, were to enter the scheme on 1 January 2015. A 'Questions and Answers' fact sheet released by Nick Smith (Minister for Climate Change Issues) stated that the delayed entry {{was due to the}} difficulties in measuring and monitoring agricultural emissions and the limited technologies available for reducing emissions in the sector.|$|E
5|$|The human {{esophagus}} has a {{mucous membrane}} {{consisting of a}} tough stratified squamous epithelium without keratin, a smooth lamina propria, and a muscularis mucosae. The epithelium of the esophagus has a relatively rapid turnover, and serves a protective function against the abrasive effects of food. In many animals the epithelium contains a layer of keratin, representing a coarser diet. There {{are two types of}} glands, with mucus-secreting esophageal glands being found in the submucosa, and esophageal cardiac glands, similar to cardiac glands of the stomach, located in the lamina propria and most frequent in the terminal part of the organ. The mucus from the glands gives a good protection to the lining. The submucosa also contains the submucosal plexus, a network of nerve cells {{that is part of the}} <b>enteric</b> nervous system.|$|E
5|$|The Maharaja of Patiala again invited Kilner to {{play and}} coach in India {{in the winter of}} 1927–28. Kilner's sister Mollie later said he was very {{reluctant}} to take up the invitation and hesitated before accepting. The trip started badly when Kilner's uncle, Irving Washington, died the day after he departed, and several of Kilner's actions suggest this triggered some form of depression. Even so, Kilner recorded several large scores, including an unbeaten 283 in one (non first-class) match. Near the end of trip, he began to suffer from a fever. His Yorkshire team mates, Arthur Dolphin and Maurice Leyland, who were also in India, believed he became unwell after eating oysters, but it is not certain how or when Kilner became ill. He began to have shivering attacks and perspiration while travelling from Marseilles on the way home. It was obvious he was seriously ill when he arrived in Southampton; a cricketing engagement was cancelled and he was confined to bed. He refused treatment in Southampton, wishing to return to his family, and asking for his wife. Arriving in Wombwell on 27 March 1928, he was examined by his doctor and taken home. Subsequently, his condition deteriorated and he was taken to Kendray Fever Hospital, near Barnsley. Although it was thought he had passed the worst, his condition became critical in {{the first few days of}} April. On 5 April 1928, Kilner died from <b>enteric</b> fever in the presence of his wife.|$|E

25|$|The {{incidence}} of water-borne and <b>enteric</b> diseases—such as gastrointestinal disease, cholera, dysentery, hepatitis A and typhoid—among {{people who use}} the river's waters for bathing, washing dishes and brushing teeth is high, at an estimated 66% per year.|$|E
25|$|In World War I, {{he was one}} of the Australian troops sent to Gallipoli, {{where he}} caught <b>enteric</b> fever. He was {{evacuated}} to Malta, but died there. Alan Marshal was a great-uncle of actor Alan Marshal (1909–1961).|$|E
25|$|Neural crest {{cells are}} a {{temporary}} group of cells unique to vertebrates {{that arise from}} the embryonic ectoderm cell layer, and in turn {{give rise to a}} diverse cell lineage—including melanocytes, craniofacial cartilage and bone, smooth muscle, peripheral and <b>enteric</b> neurons and glia.|$|E
25|$|Most protein {{formulations}} are parenteral due to {{the fragile}} nature of the molecule which would be destroyed by <b>enteric</b> administration. Proteins have tertiary and quaternary structures which can be degraded or cause aggregation at room temperature. This can impact the safety and efficacy of the medicine.|$|E
25|$|The main medical {{concern with}} this species {{is that it}} causes {{accidental}} <b>enteric,</b> urinary, auricular, and urogenital myiasis. Myiasis is the infestation of animals or humans, where dipterous fly larvae feed on the host's necrotic or living tissue. This is prevalent in small children and bedridden adults living in unsanitary conditions.|$|E
25|$|Between the two muscle layers is the myenteric plexus. This {{controls}} peristalsis. Activity is {{initiated by}} the pacemaker cells, (myenteric interstitial cells of Cajal). The gut has intrinsic peristaltic activity (basal electrical rhythm) due to its self-contained <b>enteric</b> nervous system. The rate can be modulated {{by the rest of}} the autonomic nervous system.|$|E
25|$|Parkinson' disease causes {{constipation}} and gastric dysmotility that is {{severe enough}} to endanger comfort and even health. A factor in this is the appearance of Lewy bodies and Lewy neurites even before these affect {{the functioning of the}} substantia nigra in the neurons in the <b>enteric</b> nervous system that control gut functions.|$|E
25|$|Plasmid-mediated IMP-type carbapenemases, 17 {{varieties}} {{of which are}} currently known, became established in Japan in the 1990s both in <b>enteric</b> Gram-negative organisms and in Pseudomonas and Acinetobacter species. IMP enzymes spread slowly to {{other countries in the}} Far East, were reported from Europe in 1997, and have been found in Canada and Brazil.|$|E
25|$|Dietary fiber {{interacts with}} {{pancreatic}} and <b>enteric</b> enzymes and their substrates. Human pancreatic enzyme activity is reduced when incubated with most fiber sources. Fiber may affect amylase activity {{and hence the}} rate of hydrolysis of starch. The more viscous polysaccharides extend the mouth-to-cecum transit time; guar, tragacanth and pectin being slower than wheat bran.|$|E
25|$|Gut flora in cattle include methanogens {{that produce}} methane as a {{byproduct}} of <b>enteric</b> fermentation, which cattle belch out. The same volume of atmospheric methane has a higher global warming potential than atmospheric carbon dioxide. Methane belching from cattle can be reduced with genetic selection, immunization, rumen defaunation, diet modification and grazing management, among others.|$|E
25|$|Healthy outpatients {{without risk}} factors: This group (the largest) is {{composed}} of otherwise-healthy patients without risk factors for DRSP, <b>enteric</b> gram-negative bacteria, pseudomonas or other, less-common, causes of CAP. Primary microoganisms are viruses, atypical bacteria, penicillin-sensitive streptococcus pneumoniae and haemophilus influenzae. Recommended drugs are macrolide antibiotics, such as azithromycin or clarithromycin, for seven to ten days.|$|E
25|$|Ocular {{involvement}} (mild bilateral conjunctivitis) {{occurs in}} about 50% {{of men with}} urogenital reactive arthritis syndrome and about 75% of men with <b>enteric</b> reactive arthritis syndrome. Conjunctivitis and uveitis can include redness of the eyes, eye pain and irritation, or blurred vision. Eye involvement typically occurs early {{in the course of}} reactive arthritis, and symptoms may come and go.|$|E
25|$|Extensive {{data also}} shows that {{processes}} using sialic acid are {{directly involved in the}} interaction with the receptor's lectins. It has also been demonstrated that swine <b>enteric</b> coronavirus (group 1) fusion to the enterocyte is accomplished via binding to the APN {{in the presence of the}} sialic acid. Felin coronavirus infections are therefore sialic acid dependant.|$|E
25|$|Two {{forms of}} feline {{coronavirus}} {{are found in}} nature: <b>enteric</b> (FECV) and FIP (FIPV). There are also two different serotypes found with different antigens that produce unique antibodies. FCoV serotype I (also called type I) is the most frequent. Type I, that {{can be defined as}} 'FECV that could mutate to FIPV type I', is responsible for 80% of the infections. Typically, serotype I FCoV cultures are difficult to perform, with few resulting studies. FCoV serotype II (also called type II) is less frequent and is described as 'FECV type II that can mutate to FIPV type II.' FCoV type II is a recombinant virus type I with spike genes (S protein) replacement from FCoV by the canine <b>enteric</b> coronavirus (CCOV) spikes. The type II cultures are generally easier to perform, which has resulted in an imbalance of experiments performed with many studies about type II (even though it is a far less common form).|$|E
25|$|In 2010, <b>enteric</b> {{fermentation}} {{accounted for}} 43% {{of the total}} greenhouse gas emissions from all agricultural activity in the world. The meat from ruminants has a higher carbon equivalent footprint than other meats or vegetarian sources of protein based on a global meta-analysis of lifecycle assessment studies. Methane production by animals, principally ruminants, is estimated 15-20% global production of methane.|$|E
25|$|Because {{women may}} be underdiagnosed, the exact {{incidence}} of reactive arthritis is difficult to estimate. A {{few studies have been}} completed, though. In Norway between 1988 and 1990, the incidence was 563.3 cases per 100,000 for chlamydia-induced reactive arthritis and 5 cases per 100,000 for that induced by <b>enteric</b> bacteria. In 1978 in Finland, the annual incidence was found to be 5835.7 per 100,000.|$|E
25|$|Originally, fecal {{contamination}} {{was determined}} {{with the presence}} of coliform bacteria, a convenient marker for a class of harmful fecal pathogens. The presence of fecal coliforms (like E. Coli) serves as an indication of contamination by sewage. Additional contaminants include protozoan oocysts such as Cryptosporidium sp., Giardia lamblia, Legionella, and viruses (<b>enteric).</b> Microbial pathogenic parameters are typically of greatest concern because of their immediate health risk.|$|E
25|$|Many {{drugs as}} tablets, capsules, or drops are taken orally. Administration methods {{directly}} into the stomach include those by gastric feeding tube or gastrostomy. Substances may also be placed into the small intestines, as with a duodenal feeding tube and enteral nutrition. <b>Enteric</b> coated tablets are designed to dissolve in the intestine, not the stomach, because the drug present in the tablet causes irritation in the stomach.|$|E
25|$|A bout of food {{poisoning}} or a gastrointestinal infection may also precede the disease (the last four genera of bacteria mentioned above are <b>enteric</b> bacteria). Shigella {{is the most}} common organism causing reactive arthritis following diarrhea. Chlamydia trachomatis {{is the most common}} cause of reactive arthritis following urethritis. Ureaplasma and mycoplasma are rare causes. There is some circumstantial evidence for other organisms causing the disease, but the details are unclear.|$|E
25|$|ACTG2 {{codes for}} the largest actin isoform, which has nine exons, one of which, the one located at the 5' end, is not translated. It is an γ-actin that is {{expressed}} in the <b>enteric</b> smooth muscle. No mutations to this gene have been found that correspond to pathologies, although microarrays have shown that this protein is more often expressed in cases that are resistant to chemotherapy using cisplatin.|$|E
25|$|Absorption: Duloxetine is acid labile, and is {{formulated}} with <b>enteric</b> coating {{to prevent}} degradation in the stomach. Duloxetine has good oral bioavailability, averaging 50% after one 60mg dose. There is an average 2-hour lag until absorption begins with maximum plasma concentrations occurring about 6 hours post dose. Food {{does not affect}} the Cmax of duloxetine, but delays the time to reach peak concentration from 6 to 10 hours.|$|E
25|$|Outpatients with {{underlying}} {{illness or}} risk factors: Although this group {{does not require}} hospitalization, patients have underlying health problems (such as emphysema or heart failure) or {{are at risk for}} DRSP or <b>enteric</b> gram-negative bacteria. They are treated with a quinolone active against streptococcus pneumoniae (such as levofloxacin) or a β-lactam antibiotic (such as cefpodoxime, cefuroxime, amoxicillin or amoxicillin/clavulanic acid) and a macrolide antibiotic, such as azithromycin or clarithromycin, for seven to ten days.|$|E
25|$|Feline {{infectious}} peritonitis (FIP) is a fatal, incurable disease {{caused by}} Feline Infectious Peritonitis Virus (FIPV), {{which is a}} mutation of Feline <b>Enteric</b> Coronavirus (FECV/FeCoV). The mutated virus can invade and grow in certain white blood cells, namely macrophages. The immune system's response causes an intense inflammatory reaction in the containing tissues. This disease is generally fatal. However its incidence rate is roughly 1 in 5000 for households {{with one or two}} cats.|$|E
