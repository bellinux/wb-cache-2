50|$|Over the years, the Tech IV engine {{has proved}} to be a {{reliable}} workhorse for owners when not pushed to its limits. All 1978-1990 Iron Duke L-4's are outfitted with a micarta camshaft gear that meshes directly with a steel gear on the crankshaft (no timing chain), a design also used by the Chevrolet inline six. 1991-92 VIN R and U engines received a timing chain. The <b>timing</b> <b>gear</b> has a tendency to crumble a tooth anytime after 80,000 miles. The cam gear simply shears a tooth at startup and the engine won't start; because of the non-interference design of the engine, no further damage occurs. When the cam gear loses a tooth, the camshaft AND distributor stop rotating during engine cranking. Replacing the gear requires heating the new gear in hot oil and quickly installing it for a shrink(interference) fit on the cam stub. One upgrade is the use of the aluminum camshaft <b>timing</b> <b>gear</b> from a Chevrolet 250 inline six with the Iron Duke's crankshaft <b>timing</b> <b>gear.</b>|$|R

25|$|The Boarhound was {{evaluated}} alongside the Armstrong Whitworth Atlas, de Havilland Hyena and Vickers Vespa. The Jupiter's variable <b>timing</b> <b>gear</b> gave poorer power at low altitudes, a disadavantage for an army cooperation aircraft, and the Atlas was considered superior.|$|R
5000|$|A {{short block}} is an engine {{sub-assembly}} comprising {{the portion of}} the cylinder block below the head gasket but above the oil pan. An in-block cam engine includes the camshaft, <b>timing</b> <b>gear,</b> and any balance shafts. Overhead cam engines don't include those parts.|$|R

50|$|An {{important}} application devised in the 1920s {{was the use}} of phenolic laminate fabric for gears; cut {{on conventional}} hobbing machines, the gears were tough and quiet, which was important for automotive <b>timing</b> <b>gears.</b> By 1932, Formica Insulation Company was producing 6,000 gear blanks per day for Chevrolet and other car makers.|$|R
50|$|The {{original}} 9N {{engine was}} a four-cylinder engine and {{was designed to}} be powered by distillate fuels. The engine shares the same bore and stroke sizes as one bank of the Ford V8 automobile engines. A few standard Ford auto and truck parts, such as <b>timing</b> <b>gears</b> and valve tappets, were used in this engine.|$|R
5000|$|Another engine, {{supposedly}} {{based upon}} the Cosworth BDA and YB series engines, weighed 168 lb, half the weight of its metal counterpart.

5000|$|Buda's engines were water-cooled, in-line four, six, or eight-cylinder models. Buda {{advertisements}} {{in the early}} 1900s proclaimed Buda as [...] "Pioneer of the cast-in-block" [...] method. Their engines featured long stroke, enclosed valves, noiseless <b>timing</b> <b>gears,</b> and self-contained oiling system. Early four-cylinder gasoline-fueled models produced 30 to 60 bhp. Later six-cylinder diesel Buda-Lanova engines exceeded 200 bhp.|$|R

5000|$|After delaying {{introduction}} of new 16 litre engine for 2 years [...] in 2003 Volvo introduced {{one of the most}} powerful trucks ever built. The D16C engine was available in two power outputs configurations [...] and [...] and it was a completely new design similar in the lines of D9 engine introduced a couple of years earlier for FM series. The notable design changes included <b>timing</b> <b>gears</b> being on the flywheel side of the engine (rear mounted), design which allows for increased airflow around the engine, more precise injection and valve operation, noise reduction and manufacturing cost due to flywheel casing being used to house <b>timing</b> <b>gears</b> as well. In 2005 Volvo had increased the available power of D16C to [...] respectively making in it {{one of the most powerful}} production truck available. Currently D16E engines are available in Selective Catalytic Reduction at power output 580 hp 640 hp [...]|$|R
25|$|In the 1977 Indy 500, Janet Guthrie {{made history}} {{when she became}} the first female driver to qualify for the race. Guthrie started the race from 18th {{position}} but retired with <b>timing</b> <b>gear</b> failure after 27 laps. She was eventually classified 29th. Nineteen-seventy seven also saw A.J. Foyt make history when he became the first driver to win the race four times.|$|R
50|$|Providers {{can also}} offer sub-divisions of auto repair insurance. There is {{standard}} repair insurance which covers the {{wear and tear}} of vehicles, and naturally occurring breakdowns. Some companies will only offer mechanical breakdown insurance, which only covers repairs necessary when breakable parts need to be fixed or replaced. These parts include transmissions, oil pumps, pistons, <b>timing</b> <b>gears,</b> flywheels, valves, axles and joints.|$|R
50|$|Production of the Model 2 {{began in}} 1947. Initial {{problems}} like noisy <b>timing</b> <b>gears</b> were remedied with special quality control measures, which included having the production foreman test and personally approve each engine {{that left the}} plant. The 1948 Model 3 DeliverCycle, a three-wheeled commercial vehicle used for parking enforcement by city police departments, was developed from the Model 2. Production of the DeliverCycle began in 1948.|$|R
50|$|Lobe {{pumps are}} similar to {{external}} gear pumps in operation in that fluid flows around {{the interior of the}} casing. Unlike external gear pumps, however, the lobes do not make contact. Lobe contact is prevented by external <b>timing</b> <b>gears</b> located in the gearbox. Pump shaft support bearings are located in the gearbox, and since the bearings are out of the pumped liquid, pressure is limited by bearing location and shaft deflection.|$|R
5000|$|The {{original}} D12A {{engine was}} {{considered as a}} rather conservatively power rated and expectations of higher power output from such an engine design was always at the mind of not only designer but customers alike. The D12C differs from earlier version substantially with completely redesigned engine head, <b>timing</b> <b>gears</b> and addition of bottom end of reinforcement with a stiffening subframe to cope with increased power output to [...]|$|R
5000|$|The Perkins 6.354 {{medium duty}} engine was {{designed}} to be compact enough to replace petrol/gasoline V8 engines in trucks, despite its in-line six-cylinder design. Producing [...] in early years (later rising to 120 hp), it had a small jackshaft driven by the <b>timing</b> <b>gears</b> for the auxiliary drive, with the oil pump driven by a quill shaft so it could run auxiliary equipment at engine speed with simple couplings.|$|R
50|$|Camshafts must actuate {{the valves}} at the {{appropriate}} time in the combustion cycle. In order to accomplish this the camshaft is linked to and kept in synchronisation with the crankshaft (the main shaft upon which the pistons act) {{through the use of a}} metal chain, rubber belt, or geartrain. Because these mechanisms are essential to the proper timing of valve actuation they are named timing chains, timing belts, and <b>timing</b> <b>gears,</b> respectively.|$|R
50|$|Defending race winner George Souders came to {{the lead}} on lap 63, and led for 16 laps. Souders {{reported}} that his car was difficult to handle, but {{he was able to}} run a consistent pace and stay near the front of the field. Cliff Woodbury, who started {{in the middle of the}} front row and had been plagued with mechanical problems early on, dropped out with 55 laps completed due to broken <b>timing</b> <b>gears.</b>|$|R
50|$|Delco coil and {{distributor}} with a dynamo on the nearside {{driven from}} the <b>timing</b> <b>gears</b> {{was used for}} the 1921 Indianapolis 500 and that year’s French Grand Prix but two high-tension B.T.H four cylinder magnetos on the offside driven by shaft from the camshaft drive gears were used subsequently from 1922 on. Ignition advanced 45 degrees BTDC. Spark control by Bowden lever mounted on the steering column (on steering wheel for the Grand Prix).|$|R
