5|$|A. c. cervicapra (Linnaeus, 1758) : Known as {{the southeastern}} blackbuck. Occurs in southern, {{eastern and central}} India. The white <b>eye</b> <b>ring</b> of the male is narrow above the eye and the leg stripe is well defined and reaches all along the leg.|$|E
5|$|A. c. rajputanae Zukowsky, 1927 : Known as {{the northwestern}} blackbuck. Occurs in northwestern India. Males have a grey sheen {{to the dark}} parts during the {{breeding}} season. The white <b>eye</b> <b>ring</b> is broad all around the eye with the leg-stripe going only down to the shanks.|$|E
5|$|The common {{blackbird}} of the nominate subspecies T. m. merula is 23.5 to 29centimetres (9.25 to 11.4in) in length, {{has a long}} tail, {{and weighs}} 80–125grams (2.8 to 4.4oz). The adult male has glossy black plumage, blackish-brown legs, a yellow eye-ring and an orange-yellow bill. The bill darkens somewhat in winter. The adult female is sooty-brown with a dull yellowish-brownish bill, a brownish-white throat and some weak mottling on the breast. The juvenile {{is similar to the}} female, but has pale spots on the upperparts, and the very young juvenile also has a speckled breast. Young birds vary in the shade of brown, with darker birds presumably males. The first year male resembles the adult male, but has a dark bill and weaker <b>eye</b> <b>ring,</b> and its folded wing is brown, rather than black like the body plumage.|$|E

5000|$|The {{golden parakeet}} is 34 cm long [...] and mainly yellow with {{green in the}} outer wings and with an all-yellow tail. It has a large horn-colored (gray) beak, pale-pink bare <b>eye</b> <b>rings,</b> brown irises, and pink legs. Males and females have {{identical}} external appearance. Juveniles are duller and have less yellow and more green plumage than the adults. The juvenile's head and neck are mostly green, the back is green and yellow, the upper side of tail is mostly green, the breast is greenish, the <b>eye</b> <b>rings</b> are pale-gray, and the legs are brown.|$|R
50|$|Adults have olive gray upper bodies, darker {{coloration}} on {{the wings}} and tail, conspicuous white <b>eye</b> <b>rings,</b> white wing bars, small bills, and short tails. The breast of this species is distinctive, washed with a strong orange-buff color.|$|R
5|$|The {{breeding}} season {{varies according to}} latitude, taking place from April to July in Queensland, January to May in northern New South Wales, December to February in southern New South Wales, and October to February in Victoria, South Australia and Tasmania. The male yellow-tailed black cockatoo courts by puffing up crest and spreading his tail feathers to display his yellow plumage. Softly growling, he approaches the female and bows {{three or four times}} to her. His <b>eye</b> <b>ring</b> may also flush a deeper pink. Nesting takes place in large vertical tree hollows of tall trees, generally eucalypts, which are either living or dead. Isolated trees are generally chosen, so birds can fly to and from them relatively unhindered. The same tree may be used for many years. A 1994 study of nesting sites in Eucalyptus regnans forest in the Strzelecki Ranges in eastern Victoria found the average age of trees used for hollows by the yellow-tailed black cockatoo to be 228 years. The authors noted that the proposed 80–150 year rotation time for managed forests would impact on the numbers of suitable trees.|$|E
5|$|The male yellow-tailed black {{cockatoo}} has a black bill, a dull yellow patch {{behind each}} eye, and pinkish or reddish eye-rings. The female has grey eye-rings, a horn-coloured bill, and brighter and more clearly defined yellow cheek-patches. Immature birds have duller plumage overall, a horn-coloured bill, and grey eye-rings; The upper beak of the immature male darkens to black by {{two years of}} age, commencing {{at the base of}} the bill and spreading over ten weeks. The lower beak blackens later by four years of age. The elongated bill has a pointed maxilla (upper beak), suited to digging out grubs from tree branches and trunks. Records of the timing of the <b>eye</b> <b>ring</b> changing from grey to pink in male birds are sparse, but have been recorded anywhere from one to four years of age. Australian farmer and amateur ornithologist John Courtney proposed that the similarity between juvenile and female eye rings prevented adult males becoming aggressive to younger birds. He also observed the eye rings to flush brighter in aggressive males. Moulting appears to take place in stages over the course of a year, and is poorly understood.|$|E
5|$|The {{adult male}} of the {{nominate}} subspecies has a dark red head, neck, and rump; the red is glossy, reflecting bright light. The {{rest of the}} upper body is a blackish-brown, and the upper breast and under-body a light brownish-grey. The red of the head is sharply demarcated against the brown plumage, giving the bird the appearance of having a red hood. The bill is black or blackish-brown, and the gape is black or yellowish. There is a distinct black loral stripe that extends to become a narrow <b>eye</b> <b>ring.</b> The iris is dark brown. The adult female's head and neck are grey-brown with a pink-red tint to the forehead and chin. The rest of the female's upper body is grey-brown with darker shades on the wings and lighter shades on the breast and underparts. The gape is yellow. One study suggested {{a connection between the}} female's bill colour and breeding status, with birds that had a horn-coloured (grey) bill also having well-developed brood patches. Juveniles are similar to females though with an obvious pale yellow edge to the lower mandible. Initially lacking in red plumage, they begin to get red feathers on their faces after around a month of age. Males keep their juvenile plumage for up to three months, and take a similar period to come into full colour. M. e. infuscata is similar in appearance to the nominate race but has red extending from the rump onto the back, a darker grey belly, and is slightly larger overall.|$|E
50|$|Galahs {{are about}} 35 cm long and weigh 270-350 g. They have a pale silver to mid-grey back, a pale grey rump, a pink face and chest, {{and a light}} pink mobile crest. They have a bone-coloured beak, and the bare skin of the <b>eye</b> <b>rings</b> is carunculated. They have grey legs. The sexes appear similar, however {{generally}} adult birds differ in the colour of the irises; the male has very dark brown (almost black) irises and the female has mid-brown or red irises. The colours of the juveniles are duller than the adults. Juveniles have greyish chests, crowns, and crests, and they have brown irises and whitish bare <b>eye</b> <b>rings,</b> which are not carunculated.|$|R
50|$|The body, tail, {{and wings}} are dark blue {{and the head}} is a {{slightly}} paler shade. It has an area of pale-yellow skin adjacent {{to the base of}} its beak, and orange-yellow <b>eye</b> <b>rings.</b> It has a large, blackish beak and dark grey feet.|$|R
50|$|Its arms, thighs, {{back and}} chest are grayish or brownish. Its {{hands and feet}} are black. Its elbows, knees, lower arms and legs {{may or may not}} be black. It has a gold, yellow or buff abdomen and a black face with light <b>eye</b> <b>rings.</b>|$|R
25|$|Ornitholestes was a bipedal carnivore. Its {{head was}} {{proportionally}} {{smaller than that}} of most other predatory dinosaurs, but the skull was heavily built, with a short snout and robust lower jaw. The orbits (eye sockets) were quite large, measuring over 25 percent of the skull's length. There is no indication of a bony <b>eye</b> <b>ring.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{appearance}} of the blue nuthatch differs significantly from all other nuthatches. The three taxa of the species, nominate S. Azurra and two other subspecies, vary predominantly in the coloring of their mantles, chests and bellies. All are broadly black and white – especially when viewed in low light conditions in which their dark blue coloring is not apparent – but their upper plumage is shot through with dramatic notes of cobalt, azure and other lighter shades of blue, as well as grays and purples. The head is black, or blackish-blue with a broad, pale blue <b>eye</b> <b>ring.</b>|$|E
500|$|A small silvery fish {{averaging}} around [...] {{in total}} length, the Pacific blue-eye is recognisable by its blue <b>eye</b> <b>ring</b> and two dorsal fins. It forms loose schools of tens {{to thousands of}} individuals. It eats water-borne insects as well as flying insects that land on the water's surface, foraging for them by sight. The Pacific blue-eye adapts readily to captivity.|$|E
5|$|For example, in {{the common}} {{cuttlefish}} the display consists of flattening the body, making the skin pale, showing a pair of eyespots on the mantle, dark <b>eye</b> <b>rings,</b> and a dark line on the fins, and dilating the pupils of the eyes. The common octopus similarly displays pale skin and dark <b>eye</b> <b>rings</b> with dilated pupils, but also curls its arms and stretches out the web between the arms as far as possible, and squirts out jets of water. Other octopuses such as Atlantic white-spotted octopus turn bright brownish red with oval white spots all over in a high contrast display. The paper nautilus can rapidly change its appearance: it suddenly withdraws the shining iridescent web formed by its first pair of arms from its shell.|$|R
40|$|Sexual {{ornaments}} {{might indicate}} better condition, fewer parasites or a greater immune responsiveness. Carotenoid-based ornaments are common sexual signals {{of birds and}} often influence mate choice. Skin or beaks pigmented by carotenoids can change colour rapidly, and could be particularly useful as honest indicators of an individual’s current condition and/ or health. This is because carotenoids must be acquired through diet and/or allocation for ornamental coloration might be {{to the detriment of}} self-maintenance needs. Here, we investigated whether the carotenoid-based coloration of <b>eye</b> <b>rings</b> and beak of male red-legged partridges Alectoris rufa predicted condition (mass corrected for size), parasite load (more specifically infection by coccidia, a main avian intestinal parasite) or a greater immune responsiveness (swelling response to a plant lectin, phytohaemagluttinin, or PHA). Redness of beak and <b>eye</b> <b>rings</b> positively correlated with plasma carotenoid levels. Also, males in better condition had fewer coccidia, more circulating carotenoids and a greater swelling response to PHA. Carotenoid-based ornamentation predicted coccidia abundance and immune responsiveness (redder males had fewer coccidia and greater swelling response to PHA), but was only weakly positively related to condition. Thus, the carotenoid pigmentation of beak and <b>eye</b> <b>rings</b> reflected the current health status of individuals. Our results are consistent with the hypothesis that allocation trade-offs (carotenoid use for ornamentation versus parasite defence needs) might ensure reliable carotenoid-based signalling. Brightly coloured or exaggerated ornaments can dissuad...|$|R
50|$|Most {{of these}} birds {{are very similar}} in plumage: olive on the upper parts with light underparts, <b>eye</b> <b>rings</b> and wing bars. In the nesting season they may be {{distinguished}} by range, habitat and call; in other situations, particularly on migration and in winter, {{it may not be}} possible to be sure of specific identification.|$|R
2500|$|These [...] long warblers have a longish grey tail with {{graduated}} feathers {{that are}} tipped in white, they have strong pinkish legs {{and a short}} black bill. The <b>eye</b> <b>ring</b> is orange. The sexes look alike in most populations except in P [...]h. pectoralis of Sri Lanka where the female can be told apart by the incomplete breast band.|$|E
2500|$|The bill is horn-colored (gray), darker in immatures of the Belizean subspecies. [...] The <b>eye</b> <b>ring</b> is whitish in Mexican {{birds and}} grayish in others. [...] The most {{conspicuous}} geographical {{difference is the}} amount of yellow. [...] In adults, the head and upper chest are yellow in the subspecies of the Tres Marías Islands (tresmariae); just the head in the widespread subspecies of Mexico (oratrix); just the crown in Belize (belizensis); and the crown and nape in the Sula Valley of Honduras (hondurensis, which thus resembles the yellow-naped parrot). Immatures have less yellow than adults; they attain adult plumage in 2 to 4 years.|$|E
2500|$|The kob {{resembles the}} impala but is more robust. However, males are more robust than females and have horns. Males have {{shoulder}} heights of [...] {{and an average}} weight of [...] Females have shoulder heights of [...] and weigh on average [...] The pelage of the kob is typically golden to reddish-brown overall, but with the throat patch, <b>eye</b> <b>ring,</b> and inner ear being white, and the forelegs being black at the front. Males get darker as they get older. Those of the white-eared kob (K. k. leucotis), which {{is found in the}} Sudd region (the easternmost part of their range), are strikingly different and overall dark, rather similar to the male Nile lechwe, though with a white throat and no pale patch from the nape to the shoulder. Both sexes have well-developed inguinal glands that secrete a yellow, waxy substance, as well as preorbital glands.|$|E
5|$|Hatchlings were {{described}} as grey and downy, but their exact appearance is unknown, since no skins exist today. Juvenile birds had fewer prominent grooves in their beaks than adults and they had mottled white and black necks, while the eye spot found in adults was not present; instead, a grey line ran through the eyes (which still had white <b>eye</b> <b>rings)</b> to just below the ears.|$|R
50|$|Parker's {{day gecko}} is a slender lizard and a {{mid-size}} day gecko. It can reach a total length (including tail) of about 16 cm. The body colour is bright green.

5|$|M. l. dulcis, {{commonly}} known as lavender-flanked fairywren, is found in Arnhem Land. It was described in 1908 by amateur ornithologist Gregory Mathews, though this and subspecies rogersi were long considered forms of the lovely fairywren (M. amabilis) until integrades were noted over a wide area of northern Australia with subspecies assimilis. Like subspecies rogersi, females are predominantly blue-grey rather than grey-brown and have white lores and <b>eye</b> <b>rings</b> rather than the rufous coloration of the other subspecies.|$|R
