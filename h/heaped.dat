The Destroying Angel was painted shortly after Etty's visit to Paris in which he had witnessed the July Revolution at first hand, and the sight and smell of the dead in the streets had left a strong impression on him. The <b>heaped</b> bodies in The Destroying Angel were probably directly inspired by the events Etty had witnessed in France, and perhaps also by the cholera epidemic which killed thousands in London in 1832.|$|E

The final scene, which ended with Quinn (Dianna Agron) being in a potentially fatal car crash, was controversial.|$|E

It was reported however that babies were not shot, but simply thrown into a pit and buried alive. By July 28, 1941, old and sick people had also been taken out of the ghetto in a separate incident. They were also murdered. The earthen cover <b>heaped</b> on the graves was quite thin, and two boys only slightly wounded and {{on the top of the}} <b>heaped</b> bodies dug themselves out and escaped.
