50|$|Males produce pheromones in the cephalic {{part of the}} labial gland, {{and they}} mark objects in their flight paths with the {{volatile}} components of the gland secretion. This secretion is a complex mixture of sixty compounds of which 53% is ethyl (z)-tetradec-9-enoate, ethyl esters of fatty acids. Other components include <b>ethyl</b> <b>dodecanoate</b> (6%), ethyl tetradecanoate (2%), ethyl (Z)-hexadec-9-enoate (4%), ethyl (Z)-octadec-9-enoate (2%), hexadecan-1-ol (4%), (Z,Z,Z)-octadeca-9,12,15-trien-1-ol (1%), and (Z)-hexadec-7-enal (2%). The biosynthetic pathway of the pheromones is not well known, but {{it was suggested that}} they are produced from common lipids in the body. Young and old males of B. lucorum have similar quantities of labial gland secretions because the secretory activity continues throughout their lifetime with no dependence on age.|$|E
40|$|Background: The {{microbiological}} {{diagnosis of}} infectious diarrhoea may take several days using conventional techniques. In {{order to determine}} whether flatus {{can be used to}} make a rapid diagnosis, the volatile organic compounds associated with diarrhoea were analysed. Methods: Stool samples were collected from 35 patients with infectious diarrhoea and from six healthy controls. Gaseous compounds were extracted from a headspace using solid phase microextraction and analysed using gas chromatography and mass spectroscopy. Results: Characteristic patterns of volatile gases were found for the main causes of infectious diarrhoea in hospitals. Furan species without indoles indicated Clostridium difficile, <b>ethyl</b> <b>dodecanoate</b> indicated rotavirus, ammonia without <b>ethyl</b> <b>dodecanoate</b> suggested other enteric viruses, and the absence of hydrocarbons and terpenes indicated Campylobacter infection.

40|$|Abstract The {{objective}} {{of this paper was}} to determine the volatile profile of four cultivars - Barker, Collinson, Fortuna and Geada of avocado (Persea americana, Mill.) fruit and to perform a detailed study on the effect of volatiles extraction conditions. The best conditions for extraction for Collinson and Fortuna cultivars were by using a mixture of pentane and ethyl ether (2 : 1) as solvent for 80 min, while for Barker and Geada cultivars, the solvents were hexane and pentane-ether (2 : 1), respectively but for a shorter extraction period of 60 min. A total number of 158 compounds were separated in all 4 avocado cultivars, among them eighty-four volatile compounds were identified. The principal volatile compounds viz. hexanal, <b>ethyl</b> acetate, methyl <b>dodecanoate,</b> 2, 5 -dimethyl furan, 1, 3 -butanediol, 2 -ethylphenol, 2 -butanol, &# 945;&# 8722;bergamotene, &# 946;&# 8722;caryophyllene, (E) - 2 -decenal were common in all the 4 cultivars. (E) - 2 -pentenal which possesses fruity aroma was found only in the cultivar Fortuna while ethyl acetate possessing fresh fruity flavor was present in higher content in Collinson cultivar. Benzaldehyde which possesses characteristic fruity and nutty odor note was present at a higher concentration (4. 3 %) in only Geada cultivar and in traces in Barker cultivar but it was not detected in Collinson and Fortuna cultivars...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 1966 Numerous {{attempts}} have been made to identify the flavor compounds in Blue cheese, however, duplication of Blue cheese flavor has not yet been accomplished. Therefore, it was desirable to make a qualitative and quantitative investigation of Blue cheese flavor compounds and to study the effect of certain microorganisms on Blue cheese flavor. The aroma fraction of Blue cheese was isolated by centrifugation of the cheese and molecular distillation of the recovered fat. The volatiles were separated by gas chromatography on packed columns containing polar and nonpolar phases and by temperature programmed capillary column gas chromatography. Relative retention time data and fast scan mass spectral analysis of the capillary column effluent were used to identify compounds in the aroma fraction. Compounds positively identified were as follows: 2 -pentanone, 2 -hexanone, 2 -heptanone, 2 -octanone, 2 -nonanone, 2 -decanone, 2 -undecanone, 2 -tridecanone, 2 -propanol, 2 -pentanol, 2 -heptanol, 2 -octanol, 2 -nonanol, methyl butanoate, methyl hexanote, methyl octanoate, methyl decanoate, methyl <b>dodecanoate,</b> <b>ethyl</b> formate, ethyl acetate, ethyl butanoate, ethyl hexanoate, ethyl octanoate, ethyl decanoate, ethanal, 3 -methyl butanal, 2 -methyl butanol, 3 -methyl butanol, 1 -pentanol, benzene, and toluene. Tentatively identified compounds included acetone, delta-octalactone, delta-decalactone, methyl acetate, isopropyl hexanoate, 3 -methylbutyl butanoate, pentyl hexanoate, ethyl- 2 -methylnonanoate, isopropyl decanoate, furfural, 2 -methyl propanal, methanol, ethanol, 2 -phenylethanol, cresyl methyl ether, dimethylcyclohexane, diacetyl, methyl mercaptan, and hydrogen sulfide. A combination of liquid-liquid column chromatography and gas-liquid chromatography was utilized to quantitate the major free fatty acids in Blue and Roquefort cheese samples. The average concentration (mg acid/kg cheese) in three Blue cheese samples was as follows: 2 : 0, 826; 4 : 0, 1, 448; 6 : 0, 909; 8 : 0, 771; 10 : 0, 1, 318; 12 : 0, 1, 588; 14 : 0, 5, 856; 16 : 0, 12, 789; 18 : 0, 4, 243; 18 : 1, 12, 455; 18 : 2, 1, 072; 18 : 3, 987. Roquefort cheese was found to be proportionately more abundant in 8 : 0 and 10 : 0 acids and low in 4 : 0 acid compared to Blue cheese. No formic, propionic, or isovaleric acid was detected in any of the cheeses tested. A quantitative procedure involving adsorption chromatography, liquid-liquid chromatography and absorption spectrophotometry was used to isolate and measure the concentration of the C₃, C₅, C₇, C₉, and C₁₁ methyl ketones in the fat of Blue and Roquefort cheese. The average methyl ketone concentration (micromoles ketone/ 10 g cheese fat) of five Blue cheese samples was as follows: acetone, 1. 7; 2 -pentanone, 5. 9; 2 -heptanone, 11. 2; 2 -nonanone, 9. 3; 2 -undecanone, 2. 4. Considerable variation in ketone concentration was noted between samples, but no consistent differences were observed between Blue and Roquefort cheese. One Roquefort sample contained no acetone. The annount of ketone formed during cheese curing does not depend directly on the amount of available fatty acid precursor. There appears to be a selective conversion of the 8 : 0, and to a lesser extent the 6 : 0 and 10 : 0, fatty acids to methyl ketones by the Penicillium roqueforti spores. The concentration of the C₅, C₇, and C₉ secondary alcohols was determined in the same cheeses used for ketone analysis. The previously measured ketones acted as internal standards and facilitated a semi-quantitative calculation of alcohol concentrations from peak areas of gas chrorriatograms. The average alcohol concentration (micromoles alcohol/ 10 g cheese fat) in five Blue cheese samples was as follows: 2 -pentanol, 0. 3; 2 -heptanol, 2. 1; 2 -nonanol, 0. 8. The alcohols were present in approximately the same ratios as their methyl ketone analogs, but at much lower concentrations. A synthetic Blue cheese flavor was prepared using a blend of butterfat, dry curd cottage cheese, cream, and salt as a base. The most typical flavor was obtained using the following' compounds: the 2 : 0, 4 : 0, 6 : 0, and 8 : 0 fatty acids at two-thirds the average concentration found in cheese; twice the average concentration of the C₃, C₅, C₇, C₉, and C₁₁ methyl ketones and C₅, C₇, and C₉ secondary alcohols found in cheese: 2. 0 mg/kg of base of 2 -phenylethanol; 1. 5 mg/kg of base of ethyl butanoate; 6. 0 mg/kg of base of both methyl hexanoate and methyl octanoate. Incorporation of higher acids caused a soapy flavor. The presence of 2 -phenylethanol and the esters was judged as very important in duplicating Blue cheese flavor. The mycelia of Penicillium roqueforti appear to be more active in the reduction of methyl ketones to secondary alcohols than the spores. Yeasts associated with Blue cheese are capable of reducing methyl ketones to secondary alcohols. Yeasts also may play a role in Blue cheese flavor by producing ethanol and other alcohols and certain esters...|$|R

40|$|In {{this study}} {{the role of}} {{different}} yeast strains {{in the production of}} volatile flavour components of Tokaji Aszú wine was tested. The effect of a Saccharomyces cerevisiae starter and that of the typical endogenous Candida stellata strain as well as spontaneous fermentation were studied and compared. For the fast comparison of aroma profile, a solid phase microextraction (SPME) sampling and a GC-MS separation and identification were used. Thirty of the present compounds were selected to characterise the changes of flavour. Significant differences were found between wines fermented with different yeast strains. Application of a Saccharomyces cerevisiae starter alone accelerated the fermentation but this caused only little change in the aroma profile and content. Candida stellata contributed weakly to the production of aroma, especially to that of the longer carbon chain ethyl esters. Characteristic compounds of aged wine were detected in bottle aged Tokaji Aszú. The change of aroma profile as a function of bottle storage time was studied. The concentrations of vitispirane, trimethyl dihydronaphtalene, 2 -phenylethanol and diethyl succinate increased in the course of ageing time, while those of 3 -methyl-butyl acetate, ethyl hexanoate, ethyl octanoate, ethyl decanoate and <b>ethyl</b> <b>dodecanoate</b> decreased...|$|E

40|$|Males of Bombus terrestris (L.) adopt a patrolling {{behaviour}} {{during their}} nuptial parade using cephalic labial gland (CLG) secretions containing sexual pheromones to attract conspecific virgin queens. The changes in chemical composition of their CLG secretions with age are quite well known. In this study, we investigate {{the evolution of}} CLG secretions with age in greater detail and compare behavioural reactions of conspecific virgin queens to the secretions. We show that compounds of CLG secretions follow two profiles. Most of the compounds increase {{from the first day}} after emergence until the bees are 15 -days-old and then decrease. Others are less abundant in 1 to 15 -day-old males and then increase (e. g. tricosane, tricosene, henicosane, tetradecanoic acid, pentacosene, pentacosane, heptacosene, heptacosane, nonacosene and geranylcitronellyl tetradecanoate). Differences in secretion composition lead to preferences of virgin queens for males according to the male’s age. Virgin queens prefer the pheromonal gland secretions of bees of the following ages in decreasing order; 1 day = 3 days days = 30 days 5 days 0 days.

Despite the advantages of such controlled fermentations, the fermentation involved {{in the production of}} chocolate is still a spontaneous process that relies on the natural microbiota at cocoa farms. However, recent studies indicate that certain thermotolerant Saccharomyces cerevisiae cultures can be used as starter cultures for cocoa pulp fermentation. In this study, we investigate the potential of specifically developed starter cultures to modulate chocolate aroma. Specifically, we developed several new S. cerevisiae hybrids that combine thermotolerance and efficient cocoa pulp fermentation with a high production of volatile flavor-active esters. In addition, we investigated the potential of two strains of two non-Saccharomyces species that produce very large amounts of fruity esters (Pichia kluyveri and Cyberlindnera fabianii) to modulate chocolate aroma. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis of the cocoa liquor revealed an increased concentration of various flavor-active esters and a decrease in spoilage-related off-flavors in batches inoculated with S. cerevisiae starter cultures and, to a lesser extent, in batches inoculated with P. kluyveri and Cyb. fabianii.

40|$|Background and Aims:  Winemakers are {{constantly}} searching for new techniques to modulate wine style. Exploiting indigenous yeasts present in grape must is re-emerging {{as a commercial}} option in New World wine regions. Wines made with indigenous or ‘wild’ yeasts {{are perceived to be}} more complex by showing a greater diversity of flavours; however, the chemical basis for the flavour characteristics is not yet defined. In order to evaluate techniques for making wine with the ‘wild yeast fermentation’ character more reliably, it is necessary to define the salient chemical characteristics of such wines. Methods and Results:  Pairs of Chardonnay wines were prepared from the same must and subjected to similar fermentation conditions in the wineries of origin, except for the mode of inoculation. Reference wines were made by inoculation with a Saccharomyces cerevisiae starter culture, whereas companion wines were allowed to undergo fermentation with the indigenous microflora. Of all wine chemicals analysed, only yeast-derived volatile fermentation products showed significant differences between the yeast treatments. Conclusions:  Inoculated wines were associated with the esters ethyl hexanoate and 3 -methylbutyl acetate and formed a clear cluster by principal component analysis. By comparison with inoculated wines, ‘wild’ yeast fermented wines showed high variability in volatile compounds that contribute to wine aroma, with higher concentrations of 2 -methylpropanol, 2 -methylbutanoic acid, ethyl 2 -methylpropanoate, ethyl decanoate and <b>ethyl</b> <b>dodecanoate</b> potentially being sensorially important.

40|$|In {{the present}} study, {{a simple and}} {{sensitive}} methodology based on dynamic headspace solid-phase microextraction (HS-SPME) followed by thermal desorption gas chromatography with quadrupole mass detection (GC–qMSD), was developed and optimized for the determination of volatile (VOCs) and semi-volatile (SVOCs) compounds from different alcoholic beverages: wine, beer and whisky. Key experimental factors influencing the equilibrium of the VOCs and SVOCs between the sample and the SPME fibre, as the type of fibre coating, extraction time and temperature, sample stirring and ionic strength, were optimized. The performance of five commercially available SPME fibres was evaluated and compared, namely polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS, 100 μm); polyacrylate (PA, 85 μm); polydimethylsiloxane/divinylbenzene (PDMS/DVB, 65 μm); carboxen™/polydimethylsiloxane (CAR/PDMS, 75 μm) and the divinylbenzene/carboxen on polydimethylsiloxane (DVB/CAR/PDMS, 50 / 30 μm) (StableFlex). An objective comparison among different alcoholic beverages {{has been established in}} terms of qualitative and semi-quantitative differences on volatile and semi-volatile compounds. These compounds belong to several chemical families, including higher alcohols, ethyl esters, fatty acids, higher alcohol acetates, isoamyl esters, carbonyl compounds, furanic compounds, terpenoids, C 13 -norisoprenoids and volatile phenols. The optimized extraction conditions and GC–qMSD, lead to the successful identification of 44 compounds in white wines, 64 in beers and 104 in whiskys. Some of these compounds were found in all of the examined beverage samples. The main components of the HS-SPME found in white wines were ethyl octanoate (46. 9 %), ethyl decanoate (30. 3 %), ethyl 9 -decenoate (10. 7 %), ethyl hexanoate (3. 1 %), and isoamyl octanoate (2. 7 %). As for beers, the major compounds were isoamyl alcohol (11. 5 %), ethyl octanoate (9. 1 %), isoamyl acetate (8. 2 %), 2 -ethyl- 1 -hexanol (5. 9 %), and octanoic acid (5. 5 %). Ethyl decanoate (58. 0 %), ethyl octanoate (15. 1 %), <b>ethyl</b> <b>dodecanoate</b> (13. 9 %) followed by 3 -methyl- 1 -butanol (1. 8 %) and isoamyl acetate (1. 4 %) were found to be the major VOCs in whisky samples...|$|E
40|$|Wine aroma is an {{important}} characteristic and {{may be related to}} certain specific parameters, such as raw material and production process. The complexity of Merlot wine aroma was considered suitable for comprehensive two-dimensional gas chromatography (GCGC), as this technique offers superior performance when compared to one-dimensional gas chromatography (1 D-GC). The profile of volatile compounds of Merlot wine was, for the first time, qualitatively analyzed by HS-SPME-GCxGC with a time-of-flight mass spectrometric detector (TOFMS), resulting in 179 compounds tentatively identified by comparison of experimental GCxGC retention indices and mass spectra with literature 1 D-GC data and 155 compounds tentatively identified only by mass spectra comparison. A set of GCGC experimental retention indices was also, for the first time, presented for a specific inverse set of columns. Esters were present in higher number (94), followed by alcohols (80), ketones (29), acids (29), aldehydes (23), terpenes (23), lactones (16), furans (14), sulfur compounds (9), phenols (7), pyrroles (5), C 13 -norisoprenoids (3), and pyrans (2). GCxGC/TOFMS parameters were improved and optimal conditions were: a polar (polyethylene glycol) /medium polar (50 % phenyl 50 % dimethyl arylene siloxane) column set, oven temperature offset of 10 ºC, 7 s as modulation period and 1. 4 s of hot pulse duration. Co-elutions came up to 138 compounds in 1 D and some of them were resolved in 2 D. Among the coeluted compounds, thirty-three volatiles co-eluted in both 1 D and 2 D and their tentative identification was possible only due to spectral deconvolution. Some compounds that might have important contribution to aroma notes were included in these superimposed peaks. Structurally organized distribution of compounds in the 2 D space was observed for esters, aldehydes and ketones, alcohols, thiols, lactones, acids and also inside subgroups, as occurred with esters and alcohols. The Fischer Ratio was useful for establishing the analytes responsible for the main differences between Merlot and non-Merlot wines. Differentiation among Merlot wines and wines of other grape varieties were mainly perceived through the following components: <b>ethyl</b> <b>dodecanoate,</b> 1 -hexanol, ethyl nonanoate, ethyl hexanoate, ethyl decanoate, dehydro- 2 -methyl- 3 (2 H) thiophenone, 3 -methyl butanoic acid, ethyl tetradecanoate, methyl octanoate, 1, 4 butanediol, and 6 -methyloctan- 1 -ol. 201...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 1965 Numerous {{investigations}} {{have been made}} on the contribution of butter cultures to the flavor of cultured cream butter, but production of uniform cultured cream butter has not been possible in industry. Therefore, it was desirable to investigate in detail the qualitative and quantitative chemistry of the flavor of high quality butter cultures, and to examine more closely some of the aspects of flavor production by butter culture organisms. Volatile flavor components of high quality butter culture and control heated milk were isolated from intact samples {{by means of a}} specially designed low-temperature, reduced-pressure steam distillation apparatus. Most of the flavor compounds present in the resulting distillate fractions were tentatively identified by gas chromatographic relative retention time data. Flavor concentrates obtained by ethyl ether extractions of aqueous distillates were also separated by temperature-programmed, capillary column gas chromatography, and the effluent from the capillary column was analyzed by a fast- scan mass spectrometer. Many of the flavor compounds in the flavor concentrates were positively identified by correlation of mass spectral and gas chromatographic data. In addition, supporting evidence for the identification of some flavor components was obtained through the use of qualitative functional group reagents, derivatives and headspace gas chromatography. Compounds that were positively identified in butter culture include ethanol, acetone, ethyl formate, methyl acetate, acetaldehyde, diacetyl, ethyl acetate, dimethyl sulfide, butanone, 2 -butanol, methyl butyrate, ethyl butyrate, methane, methyl chloride, carbon dioxide and methanol; also included were 2 -pentanone, 2 -heptanone, acetoin, formic acid, acetic acid, lactic acid, 2 -furfural, 2 -furfurol, methyl hexanoate, ethyl hexanoate, 2 -nonanone, 2 -undecanone, methyl octanoate and ethyl octanoate. Compounds that were tentatively identified in butter culture include hydrogen sulfide, methyl mercaptan, n-butanal, n-butanol, 2 -hexanone, n-pentanal, n-pentanol, 2 -mercaptoethanol, n-butyl formate, n-butyl acetate, 2 -methylbutanal, 3 -methylbutanal, methylpropanal, methyl heptanoate, n-octanal, 2 -tridecanone, methyl benzoate, methyl nonanoate, ethyl nonanoate, ethyl decanoate, methyl dodecanoate, <b>ethyl</b> <b>dodecanoate,</b> delta-octalactone and delta-decalactone. Compounds that were positively identified in control heated milk include acetaldehyde, ethyl formate, ethyl acetate, 2 -heptanone, 2 -furfural, 2 -furfurol, 2 -nonanone, 2 -undecanone, ethyl octanoate and methyl decanoate. Compounds that were tentatively identified in control heated milk include dimethyl sulfide, hydrogen sulfide, ammonia, methyl mercaptan, methyl acetate, acetone, methanol, butanone, butanal, n-butanol, methyl butyrate, ethyl butyrate, 2 -pentanone, 2 -hexanone, 2 -mercaptoethanol, 2 -furfuryl acetate, ethyl hexanoate, methyl heptanoate, 2 -tridecanone, ethyl decanoate, <b>ethyl</b> <b>dodecanoate,</b> delta-octalactone and delta-decalactone. The data indicated that the qualitative flavor composition of control heated milk and butter culture were very similar. Diacetyl, ethanol, 2 -butanol and acetic acid were noted to be consistently absent in the data for the control heated milk. Other compounds were not observed in the heated milk fractions, but were also absent from some of the culture fractions. This was attributed to their presence in low concentrations, chemical instability or inefficient recovery. A modified 3 -methyl- 2 -benzothiazolone hydrazone spectrophotometric procedure was adapted for the determination of acetaldehyde produced in lactic starter cultures. The procedure was applied in conjunction with diacetyl measurements in studying single- and mixed-strain lactic cultures. The diacetyl to acetaldehyde ratio was found to be approximately 4 : 1 in desirably flavored mixed-strain butter cultures. When the ratio of the two compounds was lower than 3 : 1 a green flavor was observed. Acetaldehyde utilization at 21 °C by Leuconostoc citrovorum 91404 was very rapid in both acidified (pH 4. 5) and non-acidified (pH 6. 5) milk cultures. The addition of five p. p. m. of acetaldehyde to non-acidified milk media prior to inoculation greatly enhanced growth of L. citrovorum 91404 during incubation at 21 °C. Combinations of single-strain organisms demonstrated that the green flavor defect can result from excess numbers of Streptococcus lactis or Streptococcus diacetilactis in relation to the L. citrovorum population. Diacetyl, dimethyl sulfide, acetaldehyde, acetic acid and carbon dioxide were found to be "key" compounds in natural butter culture flavor. Optimum levels of these compounds in butter culture were ascertained by chemical or flavor panel evaluations. On the basis of these determinations, a synthetic butter culture prepared with heated whole milk and delta-gluconolactone (final pH 4. 65) was flavored with 2. 0 p. p. m. of diacetyl, 0. 5 p. p. m. of acetaldehyde, 1250 p. p. m. of acetic acid, 25. 0 p. p. b. of dimethyl sulfide and a small amount of sodium bicarbonate for production of carbon dioxide. The resulting synthetic butter culture exhibited the typical aroma, flavor and body characteristics found in natural high quality butter cultures, except that the delta-gluconolactone was found to contribute an astringent flavor...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 1966 The unique {{flavor of}} high quality Swiss cheese is {{difficult}} to reproduce in commercial market cheese. Swiss cheese flavor has never been duplicated or thoroughly understood. New techniques and advances in flavor research have enabled better definition and understanding of food flavors. Therefore, it was desirable to make a detailed investigation of Swiss cheese flavor. Neutral volatile flavor compounds were isolated from Swiss cheese fat by low-temperature low-pressure distillation. The compounds were separated by temperature programmed gas chromatography. Direct analysis of cheese fat and whole cheese from four domestic and two imported good flavored cheeses by gas entrainment and on-column trapping provided a further means of isolation of volatile flavor compounds in Swiss cheese. Gas chromatography in conjunction with rapid scan mass spectrometry and relative retention time data were used to identify compounds. Compounds positively identified by the distillation and on-column trapping techniques were as follows: methanol, ethanol, 1 -propanol, 1 -butanol, 2 -pentanol, trans- 2 -hexene- 1 -ol, 2 -phenylethanol, acetaldehyde, 2 -methyl propanal, 2 -methyl butyraldehyde, benzaldehyde, phenylacetaldehyde, acetone, butanone, 2 -pentanone, 2 -hexanone, 2 -heptanone, 2 -nonanone, 2 -undecanone, 2 -tridecanone, 2 -pentadecanone, hexane, octane, 1 -octene, nonane, 1 -nonene, dodecane, pentadecane, toluene, α-pinene, methyl acetate, methyl hexanoate, methyl octanoate, methyl decanoate, ethyl propionate, ethyl butanoate, ethyl hexanoate, ethyl octanoate, ethyl decanoate, <b>ethyl</b> <b>dodecanoate,</b> butyl acetate, 3 -methyl butyl acetate, γ-valerolactone, γ-dodecalactone, δ-octalactone, δ-decalactone, δ-dodecalactone, dimethyl sulfide, diacetyl, benzothiazole, o-dichlorobenzene, 1, 2, 4 -trichlorobenzene, di-isobutyl adipate, and chloroform. Compounds tentatively identified include an aromatic hydrocarbon, pinane, α-fenchene, ethyl benzene, a di-methyl benzene, methyl benzoate, 2 -phenyl- 2 -methyl butane, 5 -methyl- 5 -ethyl decane, 3 -methyl butyl octanoate, 2, 5 -dimethyl tetra decane, methyl vinyl ether and 2 -methyl propenal. The concentration of selected volatile compounds identified by the on-column trapping technique were determined by relating their peak heights to known quantities of compound. Average concentrations calculated from the mean values for all the six cheeses and expressed in parts per million were as follows: dimethyl sulfide. 0. 107; diacetyl, 0. 8; acetaldehyde, 1. 4; acetone, 1. 6; butanone, 0. 3; 2 -methyl butyraldehyde, 0. 42; 2 -pentanone, 0. 98; 2 -heptanone, 0. 45; ethanol, 16. 3; 2 -butanol, 0. 3; 1 -propanol, 2. 9; 1 -butanol, 0. 7; methyl hexanoate, 1. 5; and ethyl butanoate, 0. 6. Liquid-liquid partition chromatography and gas chromatography were utilized to determine quantitatively the major free, fatty acids in the six Swiss cheeses. 2 -Methyl butyric acid was detected in all cheeses and varied from 9. 0 to 100. 0 mg/kg cheese. The other isomeric acid, 3 -methyl butyric, was detected in only two cheeses. Formic acid was detected in only one cheese. No n-valeric or 2 -methyl propionic acids were detected. A synthetic Swiss cheese flavor was prepared utilizing the data obtained in this investigation and that available in the literature for free amino acids. A satisfactory reproduction of Swiss cheese flavor could be achieved only if the mixture contained free fatty acids, volatile constituents, and free amino acids and was adjusted to the pH of natural cheese...|$|E
40|$|Yeast {{are used}} as workhorses to convert hopped wort into beer. Conventionally, such yeasts belong to the genus Saccharomyces and most {{research}} on fermentation of wort {{for the production of}} beer has focussed on the species Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Saccharomyces pastorianus. Recently, there is an increasing interest in unravelling features of non-conventional yeast species for beer innovation. In this thesis, features of yeast isolates belonging to the species: Cyberlindnera fabianii, Pichia kudriavzevii and S. cerevisiae (all isolated from fermented masau (Ziziphus mauritiana) fruits in Zimbabwe), were studied with focus on aroma production. Additionally, a novel approach was used to apply these yeasts in co-cultivation with Brewers’ yeast (S. cerevisiae) for beer innovation. The characteristics and quality of the beer are mainly determined by aroma compounds in the final product such as esters, alcohols, aldehydes and acids. Yeast use various metabolic pathways such as glycolysis, the fermentative pathway, the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle and the Ehrlich pathway to produce aroma compounds or the precursors for the synthesis thereof (Chapter 1). Among the aroma compounds, esters are of major importance, especially since they are perceived by the human olfactory system at very low concentrations. In general, esters are desirable compounds in beers due to their fruity flavour. Examples are isoamyl acetate (banana), isobutyl acetate (fruity, sweet), phenylethyl acetate (rose, apple, honey), ethyl acetate (sweet pear), ethyl hexanoate (apple, aniseed) and ethyl octanoate (sour apple). Together with an extensive range of other volatile organic compounds (VOCs) these compounds were previously profiled using headspace solid-phase-micro-extraction gas-chromatography mass-spectrometry (GCMS). Interestingly, comparative profiling of aromas showed that C. fabianii produces significantly higher amounts of isoamyl acetate and ethyl acetate compared to S. cerevisiae.   It has been suggested in literature that products of the Ehrlich pathway, so called “fusel alcohols”, can function as signalling molecules for invasive growth upon nitrogen limitation. This suggested that nutrient limitation could affect growth performance and production of aroma compounds. Therefore, in Chapter 2, the metabolic and morphological response of S. cerevisiae, C. fabianii and P. kudriavzevii was analysed upon nitrogen and/or glucose limitation on semi-solid (agar) media. All three yeasts showed a change in growth mode upon nitrogen and/or glucose limitation. Scanning electron microscopy was used to unravel the cell organisation of C. fabianii and P. kudriavzevii grown under nitrogen limitation. This revealed the power of cell-cell adhesion for penetrative growth and the formation of meta-filaments or pseudo-hyphae to extend the cell surface area. Such changes in growth mode may be of relevance for solid-state fermentation processes, such as fruit fermentations,  by enhanced substrate penetration of yeast. Notably, a significant  increase in the production of esters (ethyl acetate, ethyl propanoate, isobutyl acetate and isopentyl acetate) by C. fabianii and P. kudriavzevii was found under conditions of nitrogen limitation. Understanding the relationship between nitrogen limitation and ester formation gives more insight into the ability to steer ester formation by nutrient availability in wort fermentations. The amount and type of esters are important determinants of the final flavour characteristics of the beer. Therefore, the diversity in ester production between the three yeast species was investigated by studying enzymatic reactions involved in the production (synthesis) of esters and their degradation (hydrolysis) and to link this to volatile organic compound profiles (Chapter 3). The amount and type of esters depends on substrate availability and a combination of enzyme activities supporting the synthesis and hydrolysis of the different esters formed. Esters are generally formed by a condensation reaction of an alcohol with ac(et) yl CoA by a so-called alcohol acetyltranferase (AATse). The products formed  can generally be subdivided into two groups; acetate esters and medium chain fatty acid (MCFA) esters. Alcohols are formed by reduction of aldehydes by alcohol dehydrogenases (ADH) using either the fermentative or Ehrlich pathway. Comparative analysis of the specific ADHs and acetate ester hydrolysing activity and subsequently linking these data with the distinct aroma profiles of the three yeasts revealed that the acetate ester hydrolysing activity is a key step in determining the final pool size of acetate esters found in the fermentation broths (Chapter 3). Under the experimental conditions, C. fabianii showed the lowest acetate ester hydrolysing activity correlating with higher extracellular levels of acetate esters indicating the suitability of this yeast for use in co-cultures with brewers’ yeast with the objective to enable the enrichment of acetate esters in the fermentation process (Chapters 4 and 5). Nowadays, there is large interest of consumers in specialty beers such as beers low in alcohol (health awareness) and/or richer is fruity flavours (specialty beers), and this has significantly stimulated the quest for new methods, practices and yeast strains to produce such beers. In chapter 4 an innovative approach is described using co-cultivations of brewers’ yeast and C. fabianii to steer wort fermentation performance. Various ratios of brewers’ yeast over C. fabianii were inoculated in wort. A dose response relationship was observed, where a higher initial dose of C. fabianii leads to lower alcohol production and a more complex aroma bouquet. Interestingly, specific esters, i. e. ethyl acetate (sweet pear), ethyl octanoate (sour apple), ethyl decanoate (waxy, sweet apple), ethyl 9 -decenoate (fruity, fatty) and <b>ethyl</b> <b>dodecanoate</b> (fruity, waxy), were found in higher levels in co-cultivation compared to both mono-cultivations indicating metabolic interactions. The reduced ethanol production in the co-culture could be explained by inhibition of Brewers’ yeast performance by C. fabianii in the co-cultivations. Further investigations revealed that this growth inhibition is caused by competition for oxygen between brewers’ yeast and C. fabianii. Depletion of oxygen caused inhibition of growth of brewers’ yeast since it needs oxygen to synthesize ergosterol that is required for cell membrane synthesis under anaerobic conditions (Chapter 4). The interaction between brewers’ yeast and C. fabianii in co-cultivation can be described using dynamic modelling (Chapter 5). A dynamic model was developed based on brewers’ yeast and C. fabianii in mono-cultivation and fitted to experimental data. The two models were combined and the same parameter settings were used to predict the fermentation outcome of brewers’ yeast and C. fabianii in co-cultivation. The model was experimentally validated using inoculation ratios of 1 : 10 and 1 : 100 brewers’ yeast over C. fabianii. Additionally, the use of dynamic modelling supported the hypothesis that competition for oxygen between brewers’ yeast and C. fabianii results in inhibition of brewers’ yeast fermentation performance. Interestingly, prediction of aroma formation in co-cultivation, especially that of specific esters, appeared to be more challenging due to metabolic interactions resulting in MCFA-esters contributing to fruity aromas, and this aspect requires further study. The results and findings obtained in the experimental chapters (Chapter 2 - 5) are further discussed in Chapter 6. Unravelling features of non-conventional yeast generates novel opportunities for beer innovation. Application of C. fabianii in co-cultivation with brewers’ yeast in wort fermentation offers a novel approach in product innovation resulting in low alcohol beers with enriched aroma bouquet. Finally, the developed dynamic model may be used to predict fermentation outcomes of brewers’ yeast with other non-conventional yeast species...|$|E
