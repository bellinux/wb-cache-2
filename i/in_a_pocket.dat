5|$|On 9 April, {{after a long}} resistance, Königsberg in East Prussia fell to the Red Army. This {{freed up}} Marshal Rokossovsky's 2nd Belorussian Front to move west to the east bank of the Oder river. Marshal Georgy Zhukov {{concentrated}} his 1st Belorussian Front, which had been deployed along the Oder river from Frankfurt {{in the south to}} the Baltic, into an area in front of the Seelow Heights. The 2nd Belorussian Front moved into the positions being vacated by the 1st Belorussian Front north of the Seelow Heights. While this redeployment was in progress, gaps were left in the lines; and the remnants of General Dietrich von Saucken's German II Army, which had been bottled up <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>pocket</b> near Danzig, managed to escape into the Vistula Delta. To the south, Marshal Konev shifted the main weight of the 1st Ukrainian Front out of Upper Silesia and north-west to the Neisse River.|$|E

25|$|Conventional {{handcuffs}} {{have traditionally}} been advantageous when the arresting officer has {{to try to keep}} the suspect under control, there has been increasing complaint from officers that standard cuffs are bulky and inconvenient to carry. Hiatt developed a handcuff known as 'Rigid Folding Handcuffs' which work on the basis that they 'click' into place, staying rigid. It can be folded up, so they can be put on a belt or <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>pocket.</b> In the UK, undercover police have been known to use these covertly. They are roughly one and a half time the price of normal handcuffs.|$|E
25|$|The Korsun-Shevchenkovsky Offensive {{led to the}} Battle of the Korsun–Cherkasy Pocket {{which took}} place from 24 January to 16 February 1944. The {{offensive}} {{was part of the}} Dnieper–Carpathian Offensive. In it, the 1st and 2nd Ukrainian Fronts, commanded, respectively, by Nikolai Vatutin and Ivan Konev, encircled German forces of Army Group South <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>pocket</b> near the Dnieper River. During weeks of fighting, the two Red Army Fronts tried to eradicate the pocket. The encircled German units attempted a breakout in coordination with a relief attempt by other German forces, resulting in heavy casualties, estimates of which vary.|$|E
25|$|The job of {{individual}} identification took many weeks, and was largely done by teams of pathologists, dentists, and police. The mortuary team {{was led by}} Inspector Jim Morgan, who collated and edited {{a report on the}} recovery operation. Record keeping had to be meticulous because of the number and fragmented state of the human remains that had to be identified to the satisfaction of the coroner. From a purely technical point of view the exercise was both innovative and highly successful, with 83% of the deceased eventually being identified, sometimes from evidence such as a finger capable of yielding a print, or keys <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>pocket.</b>|$|E

25|$|Manstein's {{aggressive}} {{plan was}} {{to break through the}} weak Allied centre with overwhelming force, trap the forces to the north <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>pocket,</b> and drive on to Paris. The plan would benefit from an Allied response close to how they would have responded in the original case; namely, that a large part of French and British strength would be drawn north to defend Belgium and Picardy. To help ensure this result, German Army Group B would still attack Belgium and the Netherlands in order to draw Allied forces eastward into the developing encirclement. The attack would also enable the Germans to secure bases for a later attack on Britain.|$|E
25|$|Thanos soon invades Earth {{again after}} being {{informed}} {{that most of}} the Avengers have temporarily left the planet. He launches an assault on Attilan, which he offers to spare in exchange for the deaths of all Inhumans between the ages of 16 and 22. Black Bolt later informs the Illuminati that the true purpose of the invasion is to find and kill Thane, an Eternal/Inhuman hybrid that Thanos had secretly fathered years earlier. Thanos is trapped <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>pocket</b> limbo of stasis by his son. Thanos is freed by Namor and was among the villains that joined his Cabal to destroy other worlds. Thanos later meets his end on Battleworld, where he is easily killed by God Emperor Doom during an attempted insurrection.|$|E
25|$|By 1941, Featherston {{is ready}} for war. With the excuse of redeeming lost territory, he initiates the Second Great War in North America with a {{surprise}} air raid on Philadelphia and Operation Blackbeard (analogous to Operation Barbarossa), which cuts the USA in half through central Ohio. His expectations of quick victory are dashed when President Smith rejects his peace offer, however. His empire begins to unravel, starting with his disastrous attempt to take Pittsburgh {{in the fall of}} 1942 and the subsequent loss of an entire army trapped <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>pocket</b> there, because Featherston refuses to withdraw even when his generals realize it is the sensible thing to do, much like the Battle of Stalingrad. Meanwhile, Featherston increases the program of systematic genocide of the Confederacy's entire black population.|$|E
