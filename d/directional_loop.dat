40|$|International audienceIn Drosophila, left/right (LR) {{asymmetry}} {{is apparent}} in the <b>directional</b> <b>looping</b> of the gut and male genitalia. The dextral orientation of the organs depends on the activity of a single gene, MyosinID (myoID), whose mutation leads to a fully inverted LR axis, thus revealing the activity of a recessive sinistral pathway. Here, we present {{the identification of the}} Hox gene Abdominal-B (Abd-B) as an upstream regulator of LR determination. This role appears distinct from its function in anteroposterior patterning. We show that the Abd-Bm isoform binds to regulatory sequences of myoID and controls MyoID expression in the organ LR organizer. Abd-Bm is also required for the sinistral pathway. Thus, when Abd-B activity is missing, no symmetry breaking occurs and flies develop symmetrically. These findings identify the Hox gene Abd-B as directing the earliest events of LR asymmetry establishment in Drosophila...|$|R
40|$|SummaryBreaking {{bilateral}} symmetry {{is critical for}} vertebrate morphogenesis. In the mouse, <b>directional</b> <b>looping</b> {{of the heart and}} rotation of the embryo, the first overt evidence of left/right asymmetry (L/R), are observed at early somite stages (∼E 8. 5) [1, 2]. Activation of a Nodal-Pitx 2 regulatory pathway specifically within the left lateral plate mesoderm (LPM) is critical for these events [3 – 10]. Asymmetric expression of Nodal is thought to be triggered by left-oriented, cilia-generated flow within the ventral, midline node [11, 12]. Genetic removal of Hedgehog (Hh) signaling in the mouse demonstrates a requirement for Hedgehog signals in the symmetry-breaking process [13], and analysis of node trafficking has suggested a mechanism of directional transport in the node that might relate to symmetry breaking in the LPM [14]. Here we provide evidence that Hedgehog signaling in the node is not essential for breaking {{bilateral symmetry}}. In contrast, direct Hh signaling in the LPM is critical. Evidence is presented that Sonic and Indian hedgehog signals act together, through a Foxf 1 /Bmp 4 pathway, to enable the initiation and propagation of Nodal signaling within the LPM, regulating the competence of that tissue to respond to the Nodal pathway...|$|R

5000|$|Meanwhile, some {{listeners}} in the Soviet Union and Eastern Bloc devised ingenious methods (such as homemade <b>directional</b> <b>loop</b> antennas) to {{hear the}} Western stations through the noise. Because radio signal radio propagation on shortwave {{can be difficult to}} predict reliably listeners sometimes found that there were days/times when the jamming was particularly ineffective because radio fading (due to atmospheric conditions) was affecting the jamming signals but favouring the broadcasts (a phenomenon sometimes dubbed [...] "twilight immunity"). On other days of course the reverse was the case. There were also times when jamming transmitters were (temporarily) off air due to breakdowns or maintenance. The Soviets (and most of their Eastern bloc allies) used two types of jamming transmitter. Skywave jamming covered a large area but for the reasons described was of limited effectiveness. Groundwave jamming was more effective but only over a small area and was thus used only in/near major cities throughout the Eastern Bloc. Both types of jamming were less effective on higher shortwave frequencies (above 15 MHz); however, many radios in the Soviet Union didn't cover the higher bands. Skywave jamming was usually accompanied by morse signals in order to enable (coded) identification of the jamming station in order that Soviet monitoring posts could assess the effectiveness of each station.|$|E
40|$|It is {{well known}} that in general, the {{traditional}} water-filling is far from optimal in networks. We recently found the long-sought network version of water-filling named polite water-filling that is optimal for a large class of MIMO networks called B-MAC networks, of which interference Tree (iTree) networks is a subset whose interference graphs have no <b>directional</b> <b>loop.</b> iTree networks is a natural extension of both broadcast channel (BC) and multiaccess channel (MAC) and possesses many desirable properties for further information theoretic study. Given the optimality of the polite water-filling, general purpose optimization algorithms for networks are no longer needed because they do not exploit the structure of the problems. Here, we demonstrate it through the weighted sum-rate maximization. The significance of the results is that the algorithm can be easily modified for general B-MAC networks with interference loops. It illustrates the properties of iTree networks and for the special cases of MAC and BC, replaces the current steepest ascent algorithms for finding the capacity regions. The fast convergence and high accuracy of the proposed algorithms are verified by simulation...|$|E
40|$|In {{vertebrate}} development, {{the establishment}} of left-right asymmetry is essential for sidedness and the <b>directional</b> <b>looping</b> of organs like the heart. Both the nodal pathway and retinoic acid play major and conserved regulatory roles in these processes. We carried out a novel screen in Drosophila to identify mutants that specifically affect the looping of left-right asymmetric organs. We report the isolation of spin, a novel mutant in which the looping of the genitalia and spermiduct are incomplete; under-rotation of the genitalia indicates that spin controls looping morphogenesis but not direction, thus uncoupling left-right asymmetry and looping morphogenesis. spin is a novel, rotation-specific allele of the fasciclin 2 (Fas 2) gene, which encodes a cell-adhesion protein involved in several aspects of neurogenesis. In spin mutants, the synapses connecting specific neurosecretory cells to the corpora allata are affected. The corpus allatum {{is part of the}} ring gland and is involved in the control of juvenile hormone titers during development. Our genetic and pharmacological results indicate that Fas 2 (spin) rotation defects are linked to an abnormal endocrine function and an elevated level of juvenile hormone. As juvenile hormone is an insect sesquiterpenoid related to retinoic acid, these results establish a new genetic model for studying organ looping and demonstrate an evolutionarily conserved role for terpenoids in this process...|$|R

[...] İstanbul Technical University, Instıtute of Science and Technology, 2016 Konum bilgisi, günlük hayatta ve endüstriyel sistemlerde sıkça gerek duyulan, kıymetli bir bilgidir. Dünya üzerindeki konumu belirleyebilmek için yıldız haritaları ve deniz fenerleri yüzyıllar boyu kullanılmış, daha sonra yerini uydulardan faydalanarak geliştirilen GPS sistemine bırakmıştır. Günümüzde GPS teknolojisi tüm taşıtlara hatta kişisel elektronik cihazlara kadar ulaşmıştır. Bu cihazlar açık alanlarda birkaç metre hassasiyetle konumunu belirleyebilse de kapalı alanlarda kişisel ya da endüstiyel cihazların konum bilgisine ihtiyaç duyulduğunda GPS teknolojisi yeterli hassasiyete ulaşamamaktadır. Kapalı alan konumlama özellikle kişisel cihazların kullanımının artması ve otonom hareket edebilen endüstriyel araçların çoğalmasıyla son yıllarda önemli araştırma konularından biri olmuştur. Geliştirilen farklı teknolojilerin birbirlerine üstünlükleri olduğu göz önünde bulundurulduğunda, farklı ihtiyaçlara yönelik en iyi çözümlere farklı teknolojilerle ulaşmak mümkündür. Bu nedenle farklı teknolojiler incelenmiş ve soruna yönelik en uygun çözüm önerilmiştir. GPS, RFID/NFC, WiFi ve BLE ile çeşitli çözümler sunulmaktadır. Farklı ihtiyaçlar için farklı çözümlere yönelmek gerekebilir, bu nedenle 4 teknoloji de kapsama alanı, maliyet, hassasiyet, erişilebilirlik ve güvenlik kriterlerine göre incelenmiştir. İncelemeler sonrasında Bluetooth Low Energy altyapısı ve RSSI ile konum tahmini tekniği kullanıma uygun bulunmuştur ve RSSI değerindeki {{standart}} sapma dikkate alınarak algoritma geliştirilmiştir. Bu tercihler ile 2 tip gezici donanım, 1 sabit donanım geliştirilmiştir. Bu donanımlar için ihtiyaca yönelik 1 yönlü, 1 yönsüz anten tasarımı yapılmıştır. Yönsüz anten için PIFA, yönlü anten için LOOP topolojileri tercih edilmiştir. Donanım yazılımları için yeni bir BLE profili oluşturulmuş, konum bilgisi haricinde cihazın çevresel koşulları ve yerel veri tabanındaki bilgiler kullanılarak gelişmiş bir sistem oluşturulmuştur. Ofis ortamında gerçeklenen sistem için sabit düğüm konumları belirlenmiş, yönlü ya da yönsüz anten tercihi yapılmıştır. Sabit düğümlerden toplanan veriler bilgisayar arayüzü ile işlenerek; hareketli düğüm konumları ve durumları periyodik kontrol edilip bölge değişimleri ve tahmini konumları incelenmiştir. Geliştirilen sistem güç tüketimi, hassasiyet, erişilebilirlik, güvenlik ve maliyet kriterlerine göre farklı sistemlerle karşılaştırılmıştır. Güç tüketimi, güvenlik, erişilebilirlik ve maliyet yönüyle güçlü; bölge tayini ve sınır algılama yapabilecek hassasiyette bir sistem geliştirilmiştir. Location data is {{a valuable}} information which is often required both in daily life and industrial systems. Celestial maps and lighthouses had been used for centuries to estimate a specific location, subsequently were replaced with GPS, which is a location estimator developed via utilizing satellites. Nowadays GPS Technologies are embedded in almost all devices, even to the personal devices. These devices are capable of estimating location with the accuracy of a few meters error margin in the open fields. However, indoor area accuracy is not reliable enough when you need location estimation of the personal or industrial devices. Indoor location estimation {{has been one of}} the significant subjects of the researches with the contribution of the rise in the use of personal devices and autonomous self-driving industrial vehicles. Taking into consideration the superiority of the developed systems from each other, it is possible to generate the best need-based results via various technologies. Thus several technologies have been observed and the most convenient case-oriented result is submitted. Several solutions are provided by GPS, RFID/NFC, WiFi and Bluetooth LE. It may offer different solutions for varied needs. Thus, these 4 technologies have been evaluated according to coverage, cost, sensitivity, accessibility and security criteria. After analyzing, Bluetooth Low Energy infrastructure and location estimation technique via RSSI were found suitable for use, and an algorithm have been developed considering standard deviation of the RSSI value. By these preferences, 2 types of mobile hardware and 1 type of fixed hardware have been developed. 1 directional and 1 omni-directional need-oriented antenna have been designed. PIFA topology for omni-directional antenna, and LOOP technology for directional antenna were preferred. In this study, Cambrigde Silicon Radio CSR 1010 is used for all BLE hardware blocks. It has a wide input voltage range from 1. 8 V up to 3. 6 V, and 900 nA sleep mode current 16 mA maximum communication current. With these features, it is suitable for use with a battery. It also has 12 digital inputs and outputs, 10 -bit ADC, 4 PWM module, UART, I 2 C and SPI, 64 KB of ROM and 64 KB RAM with a built-in processor. It has also has good RF features: 7 dbm output power and - 92. 5 dbm reception sensitivity, 50 Ω RF antenna connection with built-in balun.   Mobile node design has a 33 mm* 50 mm* 20. 3 mm container, a CR 2032 battery could fit into the container. Mobile E-ink node has low power BLE and E-ink technology together. With this combination, light-weight and very low power design could be performed for personal ID tag. Fixed node has an BLE and Ethernet interface, and also optional 3 G interface. It gathers data from mobile nodes via BLE and sends data to central software via Ethernet. Communication with mobile nodes and central software are managed by micro controller unit STM 32 F 101 RCT 6. This device is not suitable for battery powered usage because of the large signalling traffic. Therefore, fixed nodes also contains AC/DC converter. According to usage purpose and locations of the device, directional or omni-directional antenna could be used for BLE communication. Omni-directional antenna has a center frequency of 2. 45 GHz, providing the required 7 % band width and 10 dB return loss. <b>Directional</b> <b>loop</b> antenna has 2. 45 GHz center frequency with 7 % band width, 13 dB return loss, 5. 8 dB gain and 120 ˚ orientation angle. For this study, a unique BLE profile has been developed. Including location information, a system has been created by using environmental informations and local databases of the devices.   In similar studies in this area, ideal condition in an ideal environment have been chosen for distance measurement in meter units. For closer results to ideal environment,  maximum RSSI values of the gathered information is used. In this study, instead of maximum of RSSI values, the mean value and standard deviation is taken into account in the implemented system.   RSSI value is affected by environment and moving object. Thus, distance measurement via RSSI value is not a robust solution. In this study, RSSI values are filtered with an algorithm that uses mean value and standard deviation of gathered RSSI values. Instead of calculating distance between fixed node and mobile node, location information of mobile node is determined with zones in the region. In addition to the location information, an advance system have been developed via using environmental conditions and information in the local database of nodes. Fixed node locations have been determined for the system which was performed in the office environment and either directional or omni-directional antennas have been preferred. The data generated from fixed nodes had been processed with computer interface; by controlling mobile node locations and conditions periodically, zone variance and estimated locations had been analyzed. The developed system was compared to the other systems according to power consumption, coverage, cost, sensitivity, accessibility and security a. Consequently, a strong system in the aspects of power consumption, security, accessibility and cost which is capable of sensitively performing zone assignment and border detection has been developed. The system performed in an office environment, the positions of fixed nodes determined. Two directional antennas and three omni-directional antennas are used for five fixed nodes. Collected periodical data from mobile nodes are processed by fixed nodes and location changes, entries to restricted areas and environmetal changes are  reported to the central software by fixed nodes. The system is suitable for improvement and could be used for various purposes in various fields.   BLE technology was developed to meet the needs of low-power and do not require high data transfer applications. Has expanded rapidly since 2010. Low-power and low-data rate applications are increasing rapidly with personal devices, machine to machine communication (M 2 M), Internet of  Things (IoT) applications with new ideas to reach all electronic devices. Location-based services are also needed for in-door applications. Navigation for indoor locations with a large area, caring in the field of life of patients, following the daily activities of athletes, inventory safety for high cost devices in hospitals and lobatories, monitoring the status of autonomous devices in the production line, examining the product of the process steps, knowing last position cases and boxes in logistics network, estimating working hours of stuff,  preventing the entry of visitors to the forbidden zones,studing of consumer behavior in stores and shopping centers could be applications with BLE for location-base services.

40|$|Breaking {{left-right}} symmetry in bilateria is a {{major event}} during embryo development that is required for asymmetric organ position, <b>directional</b> organ <b>looping</b> and lateralized organ function in the adult. Asymmetric expression of Nodal-related genes is hypothesized to be {{the driving force behind}} regulation of organ laterality. Here we identify a Nodal-independent mechanism that drives asymmetric heart looping in zebrafish embryos. In a unique mutant defective for the Nodal-related southpaw gene, preferential dextral looping in the heart is maintained, whereas gut and brain asymmetries are randomized. As genetic and pharmacological inhibition of Nodal signalling does not abolish heart asymmetry, a yet undiscovered mechanism controls heart chirality. This mechanism is tissue intrinsic, as explanted hearts maintain ex vivo retain chiral looping behaviour and require actin polymerization and myosin II activity. We find that Nodal signalling regulates actin gene expression, supporting a model in which Nodal signalling amplifies this tissue-intrinsic mechanism of heart looping...|$|R

Numerous studies have shown that Shroom 3 likely regulates these developmental processes by directly binding to Rho-kinase and facilitating the assembly of apically positioned contractile actomyosin networks. We have characterized the molecular basis for the neural tube defects caused by an ENU-induced mutation that results in an arginine-to-cysteine amino acid substitution at position 1838 of mouse Shroom 3. We show that this substitution has no effect on Shroom 3 expression or localization but ablates Rock binding and renders Shroom 3 non-functional for the ability to regulate cell morphology. Our results indicate that Rock is the major downstream effector of Shroom 3 in the process of neural tube morphogenesis. Based on sequence conservation and biochemical analysis, we predict that the Shroom-Rock interaction is highly conserved across animal evolution and represents a signaling module that is utilized in a variety of biological processes...|$|R

40|$|AbstractAlthough {{bilateral}} animals {{appear to}} have left–right (LR) symmetry from the outside, their internal organs often show directional and stereotypical LR asymmetry. The mechanisms by which the LR axis is established in vertebrates have been extensively studied. However, how each organ develops its LR asymmetric morphology {{with respect to the}} LR axis is still unclear. Here, we showed that Drosophila Jun N-terminal kinase (D-JNK) signaling is involved in the LR asymmetric looping of the anterior-midgut (AMG) in Drosophila. Mutant embryos of puckered (puc), which encodes a D-JNK phosphatase, showed random laterality of the AMG. <b>Directional</b> LR <b>looping</b> of the AMG required D-JNK signaling to be down-regulated by puc in the trunk visceral mesoderm. Not only the down-regulation, but also the activation of D-JNK signaling was required for the LR asymmetric looping. We also found that the LR asymmetric cell rearrangement in the circular visceral muscle (CVM) was regulated by D-JNK signaling and required for the LR asymmetric looping of the AMG. Rac 1, a Rho family small GTPase, augmented D-JNK signaling in this process. Our results also suggest that a basic mechanism for eliciting LR asymmetric gut looping may be conserved between vertebrates and invertebrates...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—There {{has been}} recent {{interest}} {{in the development of}} untethered sensor nodes that communicate directionally via free space optical communications for mission critical settings in which high-speed link guarantees in hostile environments are needed. Directional wireless optical sensor networks have the potential to provide gigabits per second speeds for relatively low power consumption enabling bursty traffic and longer network lifetimes. In randomly deployed sensor settings, the crucial steps of ad hoc route setup and node localization are not only non-trivial, but also vulnerable to security attacks. In response to these challenges, this paper proposes a lightweight security-aware integrated routing and localization approach that exploits the benefits of link directionality inherent to wireless optical sensor networks. The circuit-based algorithm that makes use of <b>directional</b> routing <b>loops,</b> called SIRLoS, leverages the resources of the base station and a hierarchical network structure to identify topological information and detect security violations in neighborhood discovery and routing mechanisms. We study the performance of the SIRLoS algorithm demonstrating that reduced localization error, routing overhead, and likelihood of attack in various contexts are possible within lightweight computational constraints.

40|$|Breaking {{left-right}} symmetry in Bilateria embryos is a {{major event}} in body plan organization that leads to polarized adult morphology, <b>directional</b> organ <b>looping,</b> and heart and brain function. However, the molecular nature of the determinant(s) responsible for the invariant orientation of the left-right axis (situs choice) remains largely unknown. Mutations producing a complete reversal of left-right asymmetry (situs inversus) are instrumental for identifying mechanisms controlling handedness, yet only one such mutation {{has been found in}} mice (inversin) and snails. Here we identify the conserved type ID unconventional myosin 31 DF gene (Myo 31 DF) as a unique situs inversus locus in Drosophila. Myo 31 DF mutations reverse the dextral looping of genitalia, a prominent left-right marker in adult flies. Genetic mosaic analysis pinpoints the A 8 segment of the genital disc as a left-right organizer and reveals an anterior-posterior compartmentalization of Myo 31 DF function that directs dextral development and represses a sinistral default state. As expected of a determinant, Myo 31 DF has a trigger-like function and is expressed symmetrically in the organizer, and its symmetrical overexpression does not impair left-right asymmetry. Thus Myo 31 DF is a dextral gene with actin-based motor activity controlling situs choice. Like mouse inversin, Myo 31 DF interacts and colocalizes with beta-catenin, suggesting that situs inversus genes can direct left-right development through the adherens junction...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (MTech(Electrical Engineering)) [...] Cape Technikon, Cape Town, 1999 This thesis {{describes}} {{the design and}} implementation of a new feedback controller for a scanning tunneling microscope or STM. The previous controller had several shortcomings {{when it came to}} the data throughput rate of the data acquisition system, the scan rate, and the way the data was stored and displayed. The initial investigation was done to determine the most cost effective way to implement the data acquisition system. Various approaches such as DSP systems, analogue systems and microcontroller systems were looked at. The investigation also looked at the best way to get the data from the Z <b>directional</b> control <b>loop</b> to the PC for displaying the data. The final choice was to use an ultra fast microcontroller for the control loop implementation and to change the DOS based software for Windows based software. The embedded system was divided into two parts. The first was the controller for the X and Y scan directions, and the second was for the Z scan direction. A digital PI control loop was implemented on the Z controller to control the height of the scan tip above the specimen surface. The microcontroller that was chosen for this was the Microchip PIC 17 c 43. The data transfer to the PC was done with a PC- 14 programmable digital input/output card. Two options for the implementation of the PC- 14 software were considered. The first option was the software that was bundled with the card. This software proved to be very slow, so special device-driver-based software was developed to control the PC- 14 card and the data transfer to and from the Pc. The PC software was implemented using Visual C++. Both the XY and the Z controllers proved to be working satisfactorily in the existing STM arrangement. It was discovered that the XY controller was overloaded with the many tasks that it has to perform, and a suitable alternative system to replace the XY controller is proposed. The selection of the PC that will be used for the data acquisition system is also discussed. It was found that this choice had a very big influence on the design of the final system because of the difference in PC bus design. Several proposals to increase the functionality of the PC software are also made...|$|R
