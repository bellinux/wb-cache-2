40|$|International audienceMeasurements of {{atmospheric}} gases and <b>fine</b> particle <b>chemistry</b> {{were made in}} the Mexico City Metropolitan Area (MCMA) at a site ~ 30 km down wind of the city center. Ammonium nitrate (NH 4 NO 3) dominated the inorganic aerosol fraction and showed a distinct diurnal signature characterized by rapid morning production and a rapid mid-day concentration decrease. The concentration increase was due to both secondary formation and entrainment from the free troposphere. A majority (approximately two-thirds) of the midday concentration decrease was caused by dilution from boundary layer expansion, however a significant fraction (approximately one-third) of the nitrate loss was due to particle evaporation. The water-soluble organic carbon fraction of fine particles (WSOC) and nitrate were highly correlated (R 2 = 0. 80) for the entire three-day analysis period, however the WSOC-nitrate correlation was highest (R 2 = 0. 88) between the hours of 08 : 00 ? 12 : 45, indicating similar sources and processing during this period.

40|$|Summary Rising {{atmospheric}} {{carbon dioxide}} (CO 2) concentration ([CO 2]) could alter terrestrial carbon (C) cycling by affecting plant growth, litter chemistry and decomposition. How the concurrent increase in tropospheric ozone (O 3) concentration ([O 3]) will interact with rising atmospheric [CO 2]to affect C cycling is unknown. A {{major component of}} carbon cycling in forests is fine root production, mortality and decomposition. To better understand the effects of elevated [CO 2] and [O 3] on the dynamics of fine root C, we conducted a combined field and laboratory incubation experiment to monitor decomposition dynamics and changes in <b>fine</b> root litter <b>chemistry.</b> Free-air CO 2 enrichment (FACE) technology at the FACTS-II Aspen FACE project in Rhinelander, Wisconsin, elevated [CO 2] (535 µl 1 – 1) and [O 3] (53 nl 1 – 1) in intact stands of pure trembling aspen (Populus tremuloides Michx.) and in mixe...|$|R
40|$|This thesis characterizes {{properties}} of ambient secondary organic aerosol (SOA), {{an important and}} abundant component of particulate matter. The findings presented in this thesis are significant because they represent the results from ambient measurements, which are relatively scarce, and because they report on {{properties of}} SOA that, until now, were highly uncertain. The analyses utilized the fraction of particulate organic carbon that was soluble in water (WSOCp) to approximate SOA concentrations in two largely different urban environments, Mexico City and Atlanta. In Mexico City, measurements of atmospheric gases and <b>fine</b> particle <b>chemistry</b> were made at a site ~ 30 km down wind of the city center. Using box model analyses and a comparison to ammonium nitrate aerosol, a species whose thermodynamic properties are generally understood, the morning formation and mid-day evaporation of SOA are investigated. In Atlanta, simultaneous measurements of WSOCp and water-soluble organic carbon in the gas phase (WSOCg) were carried out for an entire summer to investigate the sources and partitioning of WSOC. The results suggest that both WSOCp and WSOCg were secondary and biogenic, except possibly in several strong biomass burning events. The gas/particle partitioning of WSOC in Atlanta was investigated through the parameter, Fp, which represented the fraction of WSOC in the particle phase. Factors that appear to influence WSOC partitioning in Atlanta include ambient relative humidity and the WSOCp mass concentration. There was also {{a relationship between the}} NOx concentration and Fp, though this was not likely related to the partitioning process. Temperature did not appear to impact Fp, though this may have been due to positive relationships WSOCp and WSOCg each exhibited with temperature. Neither the total Organic Carbon aerosol mass concentration nor the ozone concentration impacted WSOC partitioning. Ph. D.
