5|$|In March 2012, the Roman Catholic Church, while {{supportive}} of ACA's objectives, voiced concern through the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops that {{aspects of the}} mandate covering contraception and sterilization and HHS's narrow definition of a religious organization violated the First Amendment right to free <b>exercise</b> <b>of</b> <b>religion</b> and conscience. Various lawsuits addressed these concerns.|$|E
5|$|On July 14, 2016, Gingrich {{stated that}} he {{believes}} that Americans of Muslim backgrounds who believe in Sharia law should be deported, and that visiting websites that promote the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant or Al-Qaeda should be a felony. Some observers have questioned whether these views violate the free speech and free <b>exercise</b> <b>of</b> <b>religion</b> clauses of the First Amendment to the United States Constitution.|$|E

5|$|The First Amendment (Amendment I) to the United States Constitution {{prevents}} Congress {{from making}} any law respecting an establishment of religion, prohibiting the free <b>exercise</b> <b>of</b> <b>religion,</b> or abridging {{the freedom of}} speech, {{the freedom of the}} press, the right to peaceably assemble, or to petition for a governmental redress of grievances. It was adopted on December 15, 1791, as one of the ten amendments that constitute the Bill of Rights.|$|E
5|$|The First Amendment {{prohibits the}} making of any law {{respecting}} an establishment of religion, impeding the free <b>exercise</b> <b>of</b> <b>religion,</b> abridging the freedom of speech, infringing on {{the freedom of the}} press, interfering with the right to peaceably assemble or prohibiting the petitioning for a governmental redress of grievances. Initially, the First Amendment applied only to laws enacted by Congress, and many of its provisions were interpreted more narrowly than they are today.|$|E
5|$|The {{original}} §14 of Article IV forbade {{the incorporation}} of churches, though the Virginia Commission on Constitutional Revision, in its 1969 report, had recognized that the prohibition was probably invalid. The federal district court for the Western District of Virginia ruled in April 2002 that this provision of the Virginia Constitution was in fact unconstitutional, because it violates the federal constitutional right to the free <b>exercise</b> <b>of</b> <b>religion.</b> The court found that it is unconstitutional to deny a church the option to incorporate under state law when other groups can incorporate. An amendment striking the ban on church incorporation was approved by Virginia voters in November 2006.|$|E

25|$|In 1994, {{the court}} case Peloza v. Capistrano School District was decided against {{a teacher who}} claimed that his First Amendment right to free <b>exercise</b> <b>of</b> <b>religion</b> was {{violated}} by the school district's requirement to teach evolution.|$|E
25|$|The ruling {{went on to}} cite a U.S. Supreme Court {{decision}} {{which had}} held that if prohibiting the <b>exercise</b> <b>of</b> <b>religion</b> is merely the incidental effect of a generally applicable and otherwise valid provision, the First Amendment has not been offended.|$|E
25|$|Religious groups became {{concerned}} that this case would be cited as precedent for further regulation of common religious practices and lobbied Congress for legislative protection. RFRA provided a strict scrutiny standard, requiring narrowly tailored regulation serving a compelling government interest in any case substantially burdening the free <b>exercise</b> <b>of</b> <b>religion,</b> regardless of the intent and general applicability of the law.|$|E

25|$|The Court {{recognized}} {{that under the}} First Amendment, the Congress cannot pass a law that prohibits the free <b>exercise</b> <b>of</b> <b>religion.</b> However it held that the law prohibiting bigamy did not meet that standard. The principle that a person could only be married singly, not plurally, existed since the times of King James I of England in English law, upon which United States law was based.|$|E
25|$|After the First World War (19141918), the {{teaching}} of creation and evolution in public education grew as a public controversy. By this time, many texts taught {{the theory of evolution}} as scientific fact. Many Christians in the U.S.A. and later Jews and Muslims, expressed concern that in teaching evolution as fact, the State was unconstitutionally infringing on their right to the free <b>exercise</b> <b>of</b> <b>religion,</b> as in their opinion this taught their children that the Bible had been proven false.|$|E

Renfroe also sponsored a bill that was killed in committee {{that would have allowed}} citizens to sue the government over violations of the right to free <b>exercise</b> <b>of</b> <b>religion.</b>|$|E

50|$|A special {{problem is}} created by {{government}} prohibition of psychedelic drugs such as LSD, peyote, psilocybin mushrooms, cannabis, and ayahuasca. Some people use such substances with definite cognitive, spiritual or religious motives. Use of peyote and ayahuasca is currently legal in the US for members <b>of</b> certain recognized <b>religions</b> (e.g., Native American Church). However nothing in the Free <b>Exercise</b> clause <b>of</b> the First Amendment implies that sincere and responsible <b>exercise</b> <b>of</b> freedom <b>of</b> <b>religion</b> or conscience requires formal affiliation with an established religious denomination.|$|R
25|$|It is {{said that}} {{the action of the}} Supreme Court of Illinois is {{contrary}} to the principles of that portion of the First Amendment which guarantees the free <b>exercise</b> <b>of</b> <b>religion.</b> Of course, under our Constitutional system, men could not be excluded from the practice of law, or indeed from following any other calling, simply because they belong to any of our religious groups, whether Protestant, Catholic, Quaker, or Jewish, assuming it conceivable that any state of the Union would draw such a religious line. We cannot say that any such purpose to discriminate motivated the action of the Illinois Supreme Court.|$|E
25|$|The {{basis for}} dispute arose when the Catholic Archbishop of San Antonio, Patrick Flores, {{applied for a}} {{building}} permit to enlarge his 1923 mission-style St. Peter's Church in Boerne, Texas. The building was located in a historic district and considered a contributing property. Local zoning authorities denied the permit, citing an ordinance governing additions and new construction in a historic district. The Archbishop brought suit, challenging the ruling under the Religious Freedom Restoration Act (RFRA) of 1993. Flores argued that his congregation had outgrown the existing structure, rendering the ruling a substantial burden on the free <b>exercise</b> <b>of</b> <b>religion</b> without a compelling state interest.|$|E
25|$|Turón, {{one of the}} locales of anticlerical violence, a coal-mining town in the Asturias Province, was a hub of anti-government and anticlerical agitation. The De La Salle Brothers, who ran {{a school}} there, angered the leftists who ran Turón, because of their <b>exercise</b> <b>of</b> <b>religion</b> and their flouting of the {{constitutional}} prohibition on religious instruction. On October 5, 1934, the agents of the local rebel government invaded the order's residence on the pretext that they had concealed weapons. A Passionist priest, Father Inocencio, now Saint Innocencio of Mary Immaculate, who had arrived the evening of October 4 {{was about to say}} Mass for the brothers. He and the brothers were taken and held without trial and summarily shot {{in the middle of the}} night in the cemetery.|$|E

25|$|In 2009, {{legal and}} {{religious}} issues that related to animal sacrifice, animal rights, {{and freedom of}} religion {{were taken to the}} United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit in the case of Jose Merced, President Templo Yoruba Omo Orisha Texas, Inc., v. City of Euless. The court ruled that the Merced case of the freedom of <b>exercise</b> <b>of</b> <b>religion</b> was meritorious and prevailing and that Merced was entitled under the Texas Religious Freedom and Restoration Act (TRFRA) to an injunction preventing the city of Euless, Texas, from enforcing its ordinances restricting his religious practices relating to the use of animals, (see Tex. Civ. Prac. & Rem. Code § 110.005(a)(2)) without the court having to reach his claims under the First and Fourteenth Amendments. After the court case was settled, a news article was published in the Dallas Observer documenting the volume and brutality of the animal sacrifices.|$|E
500|$|The Supreme Court never {{accepted}} {{the argument that}} the Fourteenth Amendment incorporated the entirety of the Bill of Rights. However, it did agree that some [...] "fundamental" [...] guarantees were made applicable to the states. For the most part, during the 1930s, 1940s, and 1950s, only First Amendment rights (such as free <b>exercise</b> <b>of</b> <b>religion</b> and freedom of speech) were deemed sufficiently fundamental by the Supreme Court to be incorporated.|$|E
500|$|As {{described}} by Judge Louis H. Pollak in a 1999 article, Sawyer's [...] "theory {{of the case}} was that the prescribed Bible reading, whether or not followed by the Lord's Prayer, constituted both an establishment of religion and an infringement of the free <b>exercise</b> <b>of</b> <b>religion</b> in contravention of the First Amendment as made applicable to the states by the Fourteenth Amendment." [...] The trial began in 1958 before a three-judge panel. The panel agreed in an opinion written by Judge John Biggs, Jr. After the trial, the state legislature changed the law to allow students to be excused from the Bible readings if they wished. In further hearings in 1962 the court, again in an opinion by Biggs, held that the law still violated the Constitution by allowing the state [...] "to introduce a religious ceremony into the public schools of the Commonwealth." ...|$|E
