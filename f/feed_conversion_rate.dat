50|$|Artificial feeds come in {{the form}} of {{specially}} formulated, granulated pellets that disintegrate quickly. Up to 70% of such pellets are wasted, as they decay before the shrimp have eaten them.

The <b>feed</b> <b>conversion</b> <b>rate</b> (FCR), i.e. the amount of food needed to produce a unit (e.g. one kilogram) of shrimp, is claimed by the industry to be around 1.2-2.0 in modern farms, but this is an optimum value that is not always attained in practice. For a farm to be profitable, a <b>feed</b> <b>conversion</b> <b>rate</b> below 2.5 is necessary; in older farms or under suboptimal pond conditions, the ratio may easily rise to 4:1.

50|$|From 1978, China's {{economic}} policies moved from central planning towards a market economy, opening new markets for aquaculture products.

In the 1980s, many species other than carp, such as other species of fish, crustaceans, molluscs and seaweeds, have been brought into production. However, in the late 1990s, CAFS scientists developed a new variant of the common carp called the Jian carp.

50|$|In animal husbandry, feed {{conversion}} ratio (FCR) or <b>feed</b> <b>conversion</b> <b>rate</b> is a ratio or rate measuring of the efficiency with which the bodies of livestock convert animal feed into the desired output. For dairy cows, for example, the output is milk, whereas in animals raised for meat (such as beef cows, pigs, chickens, and fish) the output is the flesh, that is, the body mass gained by the animal, represented either in the final mass of the animal or {{the mass of the}} dressed output. FCR is the mass of the input divided by the output (thus mass of feed per mass of milk or meat). In some sectors, feed efficiency, which is the output divided by the input (i.e. the inverse of FCR), is used. These concepts are also closely related to efficiency of conversion of ingested foods (ECI).|$|E

Weight gain is also likely to increase as the lipid content in the diet increases. However, levels exceeding 15-18% produces little practical benefit because of higher fat accretion in the cobia. In addition, up to 40% of fish meal protein can be substituted with soybean meal protein before a reduction occurs in growth rates and protein utilization.

40|$|Abstract. —We {{investigated}} {{the effect of}} rearing density on the growth and survival of juvenile Atlantic sturgeon Acipenser oxyrinchus using initial rearing densities ranging from 10 to 30 fish per tank or 3. 6 – 10. 9 kg/m 2 of substrate. The mean weight of fish {{at the start of}} the trial was 368. 7 g. After 7 weeks of rearing, density ranged from 6. 5 to 16. 3 kg/m 2 (14. 7 – 36. 6 g/L). Fish reared at the lowest density had significantly higher mean weight and length at the end of the trial. Growth over the 7 -week experiment was modeled as a function of time, and growth rate was inversely proportional to density. The mean increase in total biomass was 63. 14 %, and the mean daily length gain was 0. 23 %. Overall survival was 99. 7 %, and calculated <b>feed</b> <b>conversion</b> <b>rates</b> ranged from 1. 93 to 2. 65. However, <b>feed</b> <b>conversion</b> <b>rates</b> were likely not at maximum levels due to the selection of a relatively high experimental feeding rate (2. 5 % of body weight per day). As a result of excessive commercial harvests, Atlantic sturgeon Acipenser oxyrinchus popula-tions experienced dramatic declines in abundance across much of their range throughout the late 1800 s. By the 1920 s, intense harvests had severely reduced the vulnerable spawning populations (Taub 1990). Recent evidence suggests that be-tween 1977 and 1995 the number of juvenile At-lantic sturgeon in the Hudson River, which sup-ports one of the largest remaining populations in the northeastern United States, declined by ap-proximately 80 % (Peterson et al. 2000).

A diet containing neither citrus pulp nor dehydrated pas-ture was used as control. The results on growth perfor-mances showed that daily weight gain was reduced by 26 % in birds of the 10 % citrus pulp treatment (P < 0. 05). Compared with the control treatment, increases in feed intake occurred in birds consuming diets with 5 or 10 % citrus pulp, which resulted in significantly higher <b>feed</b> <b>conversion</b> <b>rates</b> with the 10 % level.

A total of four hundred and eighty 1 -day old male broiler chicks were assigned to the basal diet (control), basal diet supplemented with 15 ppm of virginiamycin, basal diets with a 0. 1 % dose of either thyme (Thymus vulgaris), coneflower (Echinacea purpurea), garlic (Allium sativum) or a blend of the three extracts in the drinking water. The highest and the lowest body weight and weight gain were related to virginiamycin and coneflower, (P< 0. 05) respectively. The lowest and the highest <b>feed</b> <b>conversion</b> <b>rates</b> were respectively related to virginiamycin and coneflower (P< 0. 05). Relative weight of bursa Fabricius in the garlic group showed a significantly more increase as compared with other groups, while the relative weight of spleen was unaffected by treatments. Cutaneous basophils hypersensitivity response (to phytohemaglutinin injection) and antibody response to Sheep Red Blood Cells (SRBC) was higher in coneflower group (P< 0. 05).
