25|$|The {{squadron}} {{was also}} involved {{in the construction of}} the 1st Australian Logistics Support Group (1 ALSG) base amid the sand dunes at Vung Tau following its occupation in May 1966. Although a detachment of engineers from 1 RAR Group had commenced basic works to prepare the area prior to the lodgement, including a basic water supply and road construction, much work remained. Lacking basic facilities for logistic operations including unloading facilities, roads and <b>hardstanding,</b> 1 ALSG struggled to become operational and commence logistic support to 1 ATF forward at Nui Dat. Meanwhile, basic hygiene and stifling heat were also a significant problem. Urgent work was required and the development plan included cutting and spreading the sand dunes, reclaiming large areas of swamp land, road construction, establishing accommodation, <b>hardstanding,</b> storage areas, workshops and vehicles parks, as well as extensive drainage works. Other tasks included winning construction resources, water purification and supply, electricity generation, survey, bridging and rafting, and civil aid. Helipads were also constructed to enable 1 ALSG to be resupplied by helicopter and for 2 Field Ambulance to receive casualties. Later, in April 1968 a quarry was also constructed at Vung Tau to supply crushed rock, gravel and fine sand for the pavement of roads, airfields, helipads and development of <b>hardstanding.</b>|$|E
2500|$|The island, {{apart from}} {{landings}} (boats' <b>hardstanding)</b> and {{a patch of}} woodland with a path running through it along the north side, is residential, consisting of 46 houses and a communal green. Access is on foot or carried bicycle from Shepperton lock, across Lock Island and then across a weir. A second weir, without foot access, connects the island to the right bank: Hamm Point of the Hamm Court residential estate, Addlestone.|$|E
2500|$|Conceived as an [...] "Un-Manned Operational Base" [...] (later to {{be known}} as a [...] "bare base"), Tindal was to have no {{permanent}} staff and very few buildings. Essentially it would consist of a runway, taxiways and <b>hardstanding</b> along with the minimal infrastructure, such as electricity and water, to permit it to be activated when required. [...] No. 5 Airfield Construction Squadron commenced work in 1964 and the [...] runway was completed in March 1967, at a cost of $7million. The base was ready to support RAAF units by early 1968, though work expanding its facilities continued through 1968 and 1969.|$|E
50|$|Poulton {{became the}} site of a World War Two RAF base - RAF Poulton. Much of the runway and {{perimeter}} track, along with <b>hardstandings</b> still exist.|$|R
50|$|RAF Finmere {{consisted}} of three concrete runways, radiating from two adjacent points in the north-west corner of the site, with twenty-seven <b>hardstandings</b> and two hangars (types B1 and T2).|$|R
5000|$|Construction of the {{airfield}} began in late 1940, and {{the airfield}} was built with three concrete runways and <b>hardstandings</b> for 36 aircraft. The runway headings and lengths were as follows: ...|$|R
2500|$|With {{the rise}} of {{industrialisation}} and coalmining along the Neath valley, it no longer suited {{its role as a}} fashionable and picturesque residence. In the 20th century Rheola was the home of Col J. Edwards Vaughan at least until 1926. In 1939 the estate was bought by the British Aluminium Company, [...] who used the house as offices, and built an aluminium smelting plant on a large plot between the house and road. Aluminium smelting requires large amounts of electricity, and the original plan had been to use locally produced electricity, generated with local coal supplies. However World War II broke out before the generators were imported from Switzerland, so the smelting plant attempted to run using national grid electricity, and this was discontinued by 1943. The factory was then in use as a strip mill. The industrial activity had involved an area of <b>hardstanding</b> covering almost , which then was used for screening coal from the nearby coalmines. By 1981 it had ceased to be needed for coal screening, and the estate was sold to local construction and demolition company RM Rees. The industrial buildings were used for architectural salvage and a weekly market. The house was in serious decline, as were the grade II listed stables and coach house.|$|E
50|$|A Folsom site at Hanson, Wyoming, also {{revealed}} areas of <b>hardstanding,</b> which indicate possible dwellings.|$|E
5000|$|Using the {{windfarm}} example again, construction {{could be}} out of bird nesting seasons. Or removal of <b>hardstanding</b> on a potentially contaminated land site, out of the rainy season.|$|E
5000|$|The {{airfield}} {{was equipped}} with three tarmac and woodchip runways and 37 <b>hardstandings.</b> [...] It also had 9 hangars, five of which were built for storing Airspeed Horsaglider aircraft ready for D Day.|$|R
50|$|Bovingdon {{was built}} in 1941/42 as a {{standard}} Class A RAF bomber airfield. The main NE/SW runway was 1634 yd/4902 feet long and the two secondary runways were 1433 yd/4299 feet long each. Over 30 dispersal <b>hardstandings</b> were built.|$|R
50|$|The {{most vital}} need was for airfields with {{hard-surface}} runways, <b>hardstandings,</b> and taxiways. The United States asked the RAF in India to provide three fields in Upper Assam, including one already being built at Chabua by native labor with primitive tools and methods.|$|R
50|$|Today {{the remains}} of the {{airfield}} are located on private property being used as agricultural fields, with the main north-south runway acting as <b>hardstanding</b> for hundreds of scrapped vehicles.|$|E
50|$|In 1941 two Bellman hangars {{were built}} on the site, {{together}} with additional <b>hardstanding</b> and a Sommerfield perimeter trackway. In 1942 the grassed strip was replaced with an 853m (2,800 ft) concrete runway.|$|E
50|$|Molesey Boat Club is a rowing club between Molesey Lock and Sunbury Lock on the River Thames in England. The {{club was}} founded in 1866 where its {{boathouse}} stands with <b>hardstanding</b> next to the Thames Path.|$|E
25|$|Today the {{airfield}} {{is home to}} a small number of warehouses however the original basic layout can still be made out, including the runways and a large amount of the perimeter track which used to connect the runways with the dispersal <b>hardstandings</b> and the technical site.|$|R
50|$|Originally used in 1941 as a decoy {{site for}} RAF Docking, {{construction}} of this Class A airfield began in October 1942, with the station being provided with accommodation for 2,951 male and 411 female staff. The airfield had 36 loop type <b>hardstandings,</b> two T2 hangars and one B1 hangar.|$|R
5000|$|In August 1943 the {{airfield}} {{was closed to}} flying while it was upgraded to A standard. Three concrete runways were built, the main aligned on 06-24 (2,000 yards), 11-29 (1,600 yards) and 17-35 (1,500 yards). 36 <b>hardstandings</b> were built, 35 of the loop type and a single pan. The original asphalt pans were not retained.|$|R
50|$|The {{ground was}} {{substantially}} improved {{with the help}} of FA grants in the close season of 2002 to meet Hellenic Premier League standards. This included floodlighting, undercover seating for 50 people and <b>hardstanding</b> all round the perimeter of the playing area.|$|E
50|$|As {{well as the}} marina, {{there is}} a large <b>hardstanding</b> area for around 100 boats to be stored ashore. The marina also has its own on-site restaurant. There is an on-site chandlery, boat {{builders}} and repair workshop, with a 50-ton travel hoist.|$|E
50|$|Although the runway, taxiways {{and large}} areas of <b>hardstanding</b> survive, most of the buildings—including the unique control tower {{converted}} from an old timber-framed cottage—were demolished around 1980. The Ockham Beacon at the east end serves as a navigation aid for aircraft flying over the area.|$|E
50|$|The {{station was}} {{equipped}} with a grass surface airfield with three main runways, a perimeter track with 31 loop <b>hardstandings,</b> four T-type hangars, four blister hangars and one J-type hangar. The station was also equipped with a Watch Office with Met. Section, utility buildings and barracks for a total staff of 1,968 males and 390 females.|$|R
5000|$|The runways, {{apart from}} narrow strips used as farm roads, were removed in the 1970s {{and all but}} three of the <b>hardstandings</b> but the {{perimeter}} track was kept intact. Small sections of the 30 and 10 runway ends, however, still exist in their full width. At one time Fulbeck was proposed for a nuclear waste disposal site.|$|R
50|$|RAF Methwold opened as a {{dispersal}} airfield for RAF Feltwell in the Winter of 1938. Vickers Wellington bombers from Feltwell {{continued to}} use the site as a satellite base until the grass airfield was transferred to No. 2 Group in the exchange of bases with No. 3 Group, {{in the summer of}} 1942. Several asphalt <b>hardstandings</b> were put down for aircraft during 1940-1941.|$|R

50|$|The club {{plays at}} the Memorial Field, which is {{shared with the}} local cricket club. As a result, the ground only has three sides with hardstanding; one touchline {{features}} a seated main stand and two covered standing areas, with the area behind both goals consisting of <b>hardstanding.</b>|$|E
50|$|In October 2000, Poole {{started playing}} at Tatnam, the school field of Oakdale South Road Middle School (now Oakdale Junior School). They {{subsequently}} built a permanent barrier around the pitch, <b>hardstanding,</b> floodlights, dugouts, a small club shop, tea hut, licensed bar and a £80,000 stand which {{allowed them to}} be promoted into the Wessex League First Division.|$|E
50|$|With {{its main}} runway less than 6,000 ft {{in length and}} a chronic {{shortage}} of suitable <b>hardstandings,</b> Scampton was far from ideal {{as a base for}} the thirty USAF Boeing B-29 Superfortress and RAF Washington B Mk Is. In January 1949, as circumstances changed, the USAF Squadrons were withdrawn and RAF Scampton was handed back to the Royal Air Force.|$|R
50|$|The {{airfield}} {{was originally}} laid out with three grass runways {{when it opened}} as a satellite station for RAF Bircham Newton in 1940. The station became fully self-supporting in 1942, when it was upgraded with three concrete runways (tar-covered), 3 T2 type and 4 Blister hangars, encircling perimeter track and 36 spectacle-shape <b>hardstandings,</b> plus a Type 12779/41 control tower and normal Mk 2 approach lighting for night operations.|$|R
5000|$|RAF Ridgewell was {{the only}} {{long-term}} heavy bomber airfield of the Eighth Air Force in Essex. For United States Army Air Forces (USAAF) use, the number of <b>hardstandings</b> was increased to the fifty required by a US bomb group. The station {{was part of the}} 1st Combat Wing establishment of the 1st Division and was the furthest east of its thirteen heavy bomber stations. It was assigned USAAF designation Station 167, station code [...] "RD".|$|R
5000|$|Staines Boat Club is a rowing club between Penton Hook Lock and Bell Weir Lock on the River Thames in England. The {{club was}} founded in 1851 where its {{boathouse}} stands with <b>hardstanding</b> next to the Hythe spur of the Thames Path in Egham Hythe, historically also known as Staines , the last word meaning small harbour or river harbour.|$|E
50|$|As {{part of the}} Southwark Olympic Legacy Project {{work began}} on the upgrade of the Velodrome in February 2013. The first phase {{included}} {{the construction of a}} new Junior 250m track, a <b>hardstanding</b> area for warming up and to hold activities like bike-ability, bike polo and non conventional bikes (e.g. handbikes and other cycles used by Wheels for Wellbeing) and installation of floodlights for longer training sessions in the winter.|$|E
50|$|Dispersal at bases: Wider {{dispersal}} (distance between aircraft) at airfields {{would decrease}} {{the vulnerability of}} aircraft. This would also force an enemy {{to increase the number}} of attacking aircraft greatly, or spend more time over the target. Either way the effect of airfield defences would take a heavy toll on the aggressor. However like HAS, dispersal can be expensive, requiring massive construction of <b>hardstanding.</b> Defense against enemy special forces is also more difficult.|$|E
50|$|During {{the first}} two years of war, a bomb store had been {{constructed}} on the far side of the A614 as had a taxi spur with three pan <b>hardstandings.</b> A perimeter track and over 30 pan <b>hardstandings</b> had also been built during this period. By 1942 Lindholme was due for upgrading and the construction of concrete runways was put in hand. However, extension of the airfield was somewhat restricted by the Hatfield Moor Drain on the eastern boundary but more land was acquired to the north necessitating the closure of two roads, one to the hamlet of Lindholme. Because of these physical restrictions, only two runways were built, 14-32 and 05-23, both of which were extended to 1,400 and 2,000 yards respectively. A new bomb store was fashioned on land to the north of the station, which resulted in obstruction of seven pan dispersal points. Two others were lost due to the construction of a new perimeter track. Even so, the station ended up with 41 pans and one loop type. A few additional camp sites were added to the south of the main area giving the station maximum accommodation for 2,192 men and 365 females.|$|R
50|$|Improvement and {{maintenance}} of Eindhoven Airfield absorbed the attention of 5357 Wing all through the winter of 1944-45. Runways, taxi-tracks, <b>hardstandings</b> etc were repaired with bricks and concrete, and work was done on drainage. 83 Group Typhoons operated from the airfield during the winter in support of ground operations, such as Operation Blackcock. However, {{much of the work}} began to disintegrate during the thaw in February 1945, and a 'tremendous effort of improvisation' was required to keep the airfield operational.|$|R
5000|$|An {{extract from}} Norfolk Gliding Club Air Show and Open Day Programme, Sunday 14 September 1975 by James Stewart titled [...] "Wings over Tibenham": [...] "When you {{looked across the}} airfield, {{there would have been}} perhaps twenty or thirty of the big bombers in the olivedrab {{camouflage}} dispersed all around the maze of <b>hardstandings</b> leading off the perimeter track....from this base I flew 20 combat missions in B. 24.H. Liberators and was Commander of the 703rd Bombardment squadron of the 445th Group." ...|$|R
