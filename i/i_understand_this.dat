Timbaland's bhangra beats are featured at the start {{and the end of}} the song. Madonna and Timberlake's vocal range spans two octaves, from F3 to Bb5. The song has a sequence of D–G–C–F–B–D in the verses and E5–D5–C5–D5 in the chorus, as its chord progression. The lyrics of [...] "4 Minutes" [...] carry a message of social awareness, inspired by Madonna's visit to Africa and the human suffering she witnessed. Jon Pareles of The New York Times stated that [...] "owever, the song sounds as if four minutes is the time taken for a song to be a guaranteed pop hit or the time required for a quickie; in reality it is the only song from Hard Candy album which contains a message of social awareness in it." [...] The sound of a clock ticking away emphasizes this message further. Madonna explained in New York magazine that the line [...] "The road to hell is paved with good intentions" [...] did not relate to her charity work. Instead it was her question to herself: [...] "Do <b>I</b> <b>understand</b> <b>this</b> opinion that I've adopted or this Zeitgeist that I've allowed myself to be swept up in? Because you could have the best intentions but not have enough information and make huge mistakes." [...] Regarding the line [...] "Sometimes I feel what I need is a you intervention", Madonna explained, [...] "eah, meaning, sometimes I think you need to save me." ...|$|E
2500|$|In retrospect, the {{majority}} of Leskov's legacy, documentary in essence, {{could be seen as}} part of the 19th century raznochintsy literature which relied upon the 'real life sketch' as a founding genre. But, while Gleb Uspensky, Vasily Sleptsov and Fyodor Reshetnikov were preaching [...] "the urgent need to study the real life of the common people," [...] Leskov was caustic in his scorn: [...] "Never could <b>I</b> <b>understand</b> <b>this</b> popular idea among our publicists of 'studying' the life of the common people, for I felt it would be more natural for a writer to 'live' this kind of life, rather than 'study' it," [...] he remarked. With his thorough knowledge of the Russian provinces, competence in every nuance of the industrial, agricultural and religious spheres, including obscure regional, sectarian or ethnic nuances, Leskov regarded his colleagues on the radical left as cabinet theoreticians, totally rootless in their [...] "studies". Leskov was not indifferent to social injustice, according to Bukhstab. [...] "It was just that he viewed social problems as a strict practitioner for whom only personal experience was worthy of trust while none of the theories based on philosophical doctrines held water. Unlike the Social Democrats, Leskov neither believed in the possibility of an agrarian revolution in Russia, nor wanted it to happen, seeing education and enlightenment, often of religious nature, as the factors for social improvement," [...] wrote the biographer.|$|E

40|$|Throughout my {{two years}} in the University of Hawaii's Selected Studies Program and {{two years in}} its Honors Program, I have often {{questioned}} myself about the worth of the two programs. As an educ­ ation major, I have been especially interested in the "educational" aspects of the two, especially as concerns the Honors Program. In the past four years, I have been constantly reminded of the Program's intent to challenge the superior student and to provide him an education of an inter-disciplinary nature. <b>I</b> <b>understood</b> <b>this</b> to mean that I would have an experience unlike that of the ordinary student. <b>I</b> <b>understood</b> <b>this</b> to mean that my classes would be excit­ ing, interesting, relevant.
