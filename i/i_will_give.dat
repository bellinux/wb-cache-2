5|$|Another steep climb of 800 feet {{brought us}} to the Marei Parei spur, {{to the spot where}} the ground was covered with the {{magnificent}} pitcher-plants, of which we had come in search. This one has been called the Nepenthes Rajah, and is a plant about four feet in length, with broad leaves stretching on every side, having the great pitchers resting on the ground in a circle about it. Their shape and size are remarkable. <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>give</b> the measurement of one, to indicate the form: the length along the back nearly fourteen inches; from the base {{to the top of the}} column in front, five inches; and its lid a foot long by fourteen inches broad, and of an oval shape. Its mouth was surrounded by a plaited pile, which near the column was two inches broad, lessening in its narrowest part to three-quarters of an inch. The plaited pile of the mouth was also undulating in broad waves. Near the stem the pitcher is four inches deep, so that the mouth is situated upon it in a triangular manner. The colour of an old chalice is a deep purple, but that of the others is generally mauve outside, very dark indeed in the lower part, though lighter towards the rim; the inside is of the same colour, but has a kind of glazed and shiny appearance. The lid is mauve in the centre, shading to green at the edges. The stems of the female flowers we found always a foot shorter than those of the male, and the former were far less numerous than the latter. It is indeed one of the most astonishing productions of nature.|$|E

25|$|The {{text of the}} Torah {{argues that}} the name of Judah, meaning to thank or admit, refers to Leah's intent to thank Hashem, on account of having {{achieved}} four children, and derived from odeh, meaning <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>give</b> thanks. In classical rabbinical literature, the name is interpreted as a combination of Yahweh and a dalet (the letter d); in Gematria, the dalet has the numerical value 4, which these rabbinical sources argue refers to Judah being Jacob's fourth son. Since Leah was matriarch, Jewish scholars think the text's authors believed the tribe {{was part of the}} original Israelite confederation; however, it is worthy of note that the tribe of Judah was not purely Israelite, but contained a large admixture of non-Israelites, with a number of Kenizzite groups, the Jerahmeelites, and the Kenites, merging into the tribe at various points.|$|E

500|$|By {{the same}} 8-1 majority, the Court found a {{separate}} and independent {{ground for the}} reversal of Burton's convictions. Burton had requested certain jury instructions, which the trial judge had delivered. But, along with the requested instructions, the trial judge had stated that: [...] " [...] asked by counsel for the defendant to give certain declarations here, and while I think they have, in the main, been covered by the charge, yet <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>give</b> them to you[...] [...] [...] These are abstract propositions of law, which I give {{in connection with the}} charge, as perhaps more fully amplifying it.

[...] They do send him the money he requests, and– although it is not described directly in the novel– endure significant hardship for themselves as a result. His family, absent while he is in Paris, becomes even more distant despite this sacrifice. Although Goriot and Vautrin offer themselves as father figures to him, {{by the end of the}} novel they are gone and he is alone.|$|E

500|$|Haleb in {{particular}} became widely admired by American breeders, {{and in addition}} to siring Arabians, he was also crossed with Morgan and Standardbred mares. In 1907, Davenport entered the stallion into the Justin Morgan Cup, a horse show competition he won, defeating 19 Morgan horses. In 1909, Haleb died under mysterious circumstances. [...] Davenport believed the horse had been poisoned. [...] He had the stallion's skull and partial skeleton prepared and sent to the Smithsonian Institution, where it became part of the museum's research collection. [...] Davenport also purchased horses from the Crabbet Park Stud in England, notably the stallion *Abu Zeyd, considered the best son of his famous sire, Mesaoud. In 1911, Davenport described *Abu Zeyd as [...] "the grandest specimen of the Arabian horse I have ever seen and <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>give</b> a $100 cup to the owner of any horse than can beat him." ...|$|E
500|$|The next track [...] "Incredible" [...] {{starts off}} like a love song but reveals itself to be a plea to someone to start over, while {{changing}} its composition from the interlude. According to MTV, the shift in the structure reflected Madonna's own confusion about how she felt about her lover in the song. [...] "Can't get my head around it", she sang. [...] "I, I {{need to think about}} it." [...] "Beat Goes On" [...] featuring West, has a 70s R meeting 80s dance vibe and a rap interlude by West. Williams has commented that Madonna's work ethic was different from other artists that he had worked with before. That is reflected in songs like [...] "Spanish Lesson" [...] where she sings the line [...] "If you do your homework/ Baby <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>give</b> you more". It also has influences of Spanish music. Groove inspired music is present in [...] "Dance 2Night", which featured Timberlake.|$|E
500|$|Johnson was {{not happy}} at James Selby's, and after about five years, both {{he and his brother}} ran away. Selby responded by placing a reward for their return: [...] "Ten Dollars Reward. Ran away from the subscriber, two {{apprentice}} boys, legally bound, named William and Andrew Johnson... to any person who will deliver said apprentices to me in Raleigh, or <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>give</b> the above reward for Andrew Johnson alone." [...] The brothers went to Carthage, North Carolina, where Andrew Johnson worked as a tailor for several months. Fearing he would be arrested and returned to Raleigh, Johnson moved to Laurens, South Carolina. He found work quickly, met his first love, Mary Wood, and made her a quilt as a gift. However, she rejected his marriage proposal. [...] He returned to Raleigh, hoping to buy out his apprenticeship, but could not come to terms with Selby. Unable to stay in Raleigh, where he risked being apprehended for abandoning Selby, he decided to move west.|$|E

500|$|To {{ward off}} the threat of vampires and disease, twin {{brothers}} would yoke twin oxen to a plow and make a furrow with it around their village. An egg would be broken and a nail driven into the floor beneath the bier {{of the house of}} a recently deceased person. Two or three elderly women would attend the cemetery the evening after the funeral and stick five hawthorn pegs or old knives into the grave: one at the position of the deceased's chest, and the other four at the positions of his arms and legs. Other texts maintain that running backwards uphill with a lit candle and a turtle would ward off a stalking vampire. Alternately, they may surround the grave with a red woolen thread, ignite the thread, and wait until it was burnt up. If a noise was heard at night and suspected to be made by a vampire sneaking around someone's house, one would shout [...] "Come tomorrow, and <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>give</b> you some salt," [...] or [...] "Go, pal, get some fish, and come back." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{her final}} soliloquy, Brünnhilde thanks the Rhinemaidens for their [...] "good advice". They have {{apparently}} {{told her the}} full story of Siegfried's ensnarement and betrayal, and advised that only {{the return of the}} ring to the waters of the Rhine can lift its curse. Brünnhilde sings: [...] "What you desire <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>give</b> you: from my ashes take it to yourselves. The fire...will cleanse the curse from the ring". She exhorts the Rhinemaidens to [...] "carefully guard it" [...] in the future, then leaps into the flames of Siegfried's pyre. The fire blazes up to fill the stage, representing the destruction of the gods. As the Rhine overflows its banks the Rhinemaidens appear, making for the ring. Hagen, who covets the ring, shouts to them [...] "Get back from the ring!" [...] (Zurück vom Ring!), the last words of the drama. He is seized by Woglinde and Wellgunde and dragged into the Rhine's depths, as Flosshilde grabs the ring, holds it aloft, and joins her sisters [...] swimming in circles as the waters of the Rhine [...] gradually subside.|$|E
500|$|When {{work on the}} Marble Hall {{was being}} done, from 1944–1948, the {{assistant}} pastor of Mount St. Peter's was Father George Goralka, who executed an inscription around the central nave of {{the ceiling of the}} Marble Hall, Christ's proclamation of Peter's Primacy: [...] "Blessed art thou Simon Son of Jona and I say to thee, thou art Peter and upon this Rock I will build my Church and the gates of Hell shall not prevail against it, and <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>give</b> thee the keys of the Kingdom of Heaven and whatever thou shall bind on earth shall be bound in Heaven and whatever thou shall loose on earth shall be loosed in Heaven." [...] The basement was called the Marble Hall after completion and the name stuck. The Marble Hall is mostly used for special breakfasts and dinners, and for fish fry fundraisers during Lent. The hall also serves as the parish's Italian Restaurant during the Festa Italiana each August. On special holidays when more parishioners than usual attend Mass, which usually include Christmas, Palm Sunday, and Easter, the Mass is said in both the upstairs of the church and downstairs in the Marble Hall.|$|E
