40|$|Enterohaemorrhagic and enteropathogenic Escherichia coli (EHEC and EPEC) are enteric {{pathogens}} {{that cause}} disease through intimate attachment and subversion of intestinal epithelial cells. This strategy {{depends on a}} type III secretion system (T 3 SS) to translocate effector proteins into host cells. <b>EspJ</b> is a T 3 SS effector protein that inhibits opsono-phagocytosis through an unidentified mechanism. This study aimed to determine the mechanism of action of <b>EspJ</b> through analysis of the protein itself {{and its effects on}} eukaryotic cell signalling. Bioinformatic analysis of <b>EspJ</b> revealed a predicted ADP-ribosyltransferase (ART) domain which mediates transfer of ADP-ribose from NAD on to a target protein. Through structural comparison with known ARTs, mutations were designed targeting predicted key ART domain residues. NMR analysis revealed that <b>EspJ</b> binds NAD and also that this interaction was disrupted by ART domain mutations. Mutation of the ART domain also disrupted inhibition of opsono-phagocytosis by <b>EspJ.</b> Further analysis of phagocytosis revealed that <b>EspJ</b> inhibits actin polymerisation and tyrosine phosphorylation during FcγR-mediated phagocytosis. During infection, EPEC and EHEC use the translocated effector Tir to initiate actin polymerisation pathways leading to the formation of actin rich pedestals on cultured cells. TirEPEC signalling {{is similar to that of}} the FcγR and so the impact of <b>EspJ</b> on pedestal formation was analysed. <b>EspJ</b> inhibited the tyrosine phosphorylation-dependent TirEPEC-mediated actin pedestal assembly but not the phosphorylation-independent TirEHEC signalling. Inhibition of EPEC pedestals correlated with reduced tyrosine phosphorylation and recruitment of the SH 2 -adaptor Nck. Importantly, an absence of Src family kinases (SFK) was observed in the presence of <b>EspJ.</b> <b>EspJ</b> inhibited FcγRIIa tyrosine phosphorylation suggesting that this effector acts at the initial stages of tyrosine kinase dependent actin polymerisation pathways preventing receptor phosphorylation by SFKs. Importantly, an intact ART domain was required for <b>EspJ</b> mediated inhibition of tyrosine phosphorylation and downstream actin polymerisation. Open Acces...|$|E

40|$|AIM: To {{assess the}} patency of {{pancreatic}}oenterostomy and pancreatic exocrine function after three surgical methods. METHODS: A pig model of pancreatic ductal dilation {{was made by}} ligating the main pancreatic duct. After 4 wk ligation, a total of 36 piglets were divided randomly into four groups. The piglets {{in the control group}} underwent laparotomy only; the others were treated by three anastomoses: (1) end-to-end pancreaticojejunostomy invagination (EEPJ); (2) end-to-side duct-to-mucosa sutured anastomosis (ESPJ); or (3) binding pancreaticojejunostomy (BPJ). Anastomotic patency was assessed after 8 wk by body weight gain, intrapancreatic ductal pressure, pancreatic exocrine function secretin test, pancreatography, and macroscopic and histologic features of the anastomotic site. RESULTS: The EEPJ group had significantly slower weight gain than the <b>ESPJ</b> and BPJ groups on postoperative weeks 6 and 8 (P < 0. 05). The animals in both the <b>ESPJ</b> and BPJ groups had a similar body weight gain. Intrapancreatic ductal pressure was similar in <b>ESPJ</b> and BPJ. However, pressure in EEPJ was significantly higher than that in <b>ESPJ</b> and BPJ (P < 0. 05). All three functional parameters, the secretory volume, the flow rate of pancreatic juice, and bicarbonate concentration, were significantly higher in <b>ESPJ</b> and BPJ as compared to EEPJ (P < 0. 05).

40|$|A key {{strategy}} in microbial pathogenesis is the subversion {{of the first}} line of cellular immune defences presented by professional phagocytes. Enteropathogenic and enterohaemorrhagic Escherichia coli (EPEC and EHEC respectively) remain extracellular while colonizing the gut mucosa by attaching and effacing mechanism. EPEC use the type three secretion system effector protein EspF to prevent their own uptake into macrophages. EPEC can also block in trans the internalization of IgG-opsonized particles. In this study, we show that <b>EspJ</b> is the type three secretion system effector protein responsible for trans-inhibition of macrophage opsono-phagocytosis by both EPEC and EHEC. While EspF plays no role in trans-inhibition of opsono-phagocytosis, <b>espJ</b> mutants of EPEC or EHEC are unable to block uptake of opsonized sheep red blood cells (RBC), a phenotype that is rescued upon complementation with the <b>espJ</b> gene. Importantly, ectopic expression of EspJEHEC in phagocytes is sufficient to inhibit internalization of both IgG- and C 3 bi-opsonized RBC. These results suggest that <b>EspJ</b> targets a basic mechanism common to these two unrelated phagocytic receptors. Moreover, EspF and <b>EspJ</b> target independent aspects of the phagocytic function of mammalian macrophages in vitro...|$|E

40|$|The {{hallmark}} of enteropathogenic Escherichia coli (EPEC) infection is {{the formation of}} actin-rich pedestal-like structures, which are generated following phosphorylation of the bacterial effector Tir by cellular Src and Abl family tyrosine kinases. This leads to recruitment of the Nck–WIP–N-WASP complex that triggers Arp 2 / 3 -dependent actin polymerization in the host cell. The same phosphorylation-mediated signalling network is also assembled downstream of the Vaccinia virus protein A 36 and the phagocytic Fc-gamma receptor FcgRIIa. Here we report that the EPEC type-III secretion system effector <b>EspJ</b> inhibits autophosphorylation of Src and phosphorylation of the Src substrates Tir and FcgRIIa. Consistent with this, <b>EspJ</b> inhibits actin polymerization downstream of EPEC, Vaccinia virus and opsonized red blood cells.

40|$|Enterohemorrhagic E. coli (EHEC) {{manipulate}} {{their human}} host {{through at least}} 39 effector proteins which hijack host processes through direct protein-protein interactions (PPIs). To identify their protein targets in the host cells, we performed yeast two-hybrid screens, allowing us to find 48 high-confidence protein-protein interactions between 15 EHEC effectors and 47 human host proteins. In comparison to other bacteria and viruses we found that EHEC effectors bind more frequently to hub proteins {{as well as to}} proteins that participate in a higher number of protein complexes. The data set includes six new interactions that involve the translocated intimin receptor (TIR), namely HPCAL 1, HPCAL 4, NCALD, ARRB 1, PDE 6 D, and STK 16. We compared these TIR interactions in EHEC and enteropathogenic E. coli (EPEC) and found that five interactions were conserved. Notably, the conserved interactions included those of serine/threonine kinase 16 (STK 16), hippocalcin-like 1 (HPCAL 1) as well as neurocalcin-delta (NCALD). These proteins co-localize with the infection sites of EPEC. Furthermore, our results suggest putative functions of poorly characterized effectors (<b>EspJ,</b> EspY 1).

Interestingly, stx 2 a-positive O 26 :H 11 rarely isolated from cattle in other countries showed to be an important proportion of O 26 :H 11 strains circulating in cattle and food in our region.

Genetic differences in tEPEC strains could underlie some of the variability in clinical outcome. We produced draft genome sequences of all available tEPEC strains from GEMS lethal infections (LIs) and of closely matched EPEC strains from GEMS subjects with non-lethal symptomatic infections (NSIs) and asymptomatic infections (AIs) to identify gene clusters (potential protein encoding sequences sharing ≥ 90 % nucleotide sequence identity) associated with lethality.

40|$|Together with enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli and enteropathogenic Escherichia coli, Citrobacter rodentium is {{a member}} of the attaching-and-effacing (A/E) family of {{bacterial}} pathogens. A/E pathogens use a type III secretion system (T 3 SS) to translocate an assortment of effector proteins, encoded both within and outside the locus of enterocyte effacement (LEE), into the colonized host cell, leading to the formation of A/E lesions and disease. Here we report the identification and characterization of a new non-LEE encoded effector, NleH, in C. rodentium. NleH is conserved among A/E pathogens and shares identity with OspG, a type III secreted effector protein in Shigella flexneri. Downstream of nleH, genes encoding homologues of the non-LEE-encoded effectors <b>EspJ</b> and NleG/NleI are found. NleH secretion and translocation into Caco- 2 cells requires a functional T 3 SS and signals located at its amino-terminal domain. Transcription of nleH is not significantly reduced in mutants lacking the LEE-encoded regulators Ler and GrlA; however, NleH protein levels are highly reduced in these strains, as well as in escN and cesT mutants. Inactivation of Lon, but not of ClpP, protease restores NleH levels even in the absence of CesT. Our results indicate that the efficient engagement of NleH in active secretion is needed for its stability, thus establishing a posttranslational regulatory mechanism that coregulates NleH levels with the expression of LEE-encoded proteins.

One of these effectors is Cif, encoded outside the LEE by a lambdoid prophage. In this study, we demonstrated that the Cif-encoding prophage of EPEC strain E 22 is inducible and produces infectious phage particles. We investigated the distribution and functional expression of Cif in 5, 049 E. coli strains of human, animal, and environmental origins. A total of 115 E. coli isolates from diverse origins and geographic locations carried cif. The presence of cif was tightly associated with the LEE, since all the cif-positive isolates were positive for the LEE. These results suggested that the Cif-encoding prophages have been widely disseminated within the natural population of E. coli but positively selected within the population of LEE-positive strains. Nonetheless, 66 % of cif-positive E. coli strains did not induce a typical Cif-related phenotype in eukaryotic cells due to frameshift mutations or insertion of an IS element in the cif gene. The passenger region of the prophages carrying cif was highly variable and showed various combinations of IS elements and genes coding for other effectors such as nleB, nleC, nleH, nleG, <b>espJ,</b> and nleA/espI (some of which were also truncated).

Enteropathogenic E. coli (EPEC; eae positive) {{appeared to be the}} most frequent pathotype (n = 22 strains), 11 O 157 strains were typical enterohemorrhagic E. coli (EHEC; stx and eae positive), and 9 O 157 strains were atypical, with none of the key stx and eae virulence genes detected. EHEC and EPEC O 157 strains all carried eae-gamma, tir-gamma, tccP, and paa. Other virulence genes located on the pO 157 virulence plasmid and different O islands (O island 43 [OI- 43] and OI- 122), as well as <b>espJ</b> and espM, also characterized the EPEC and EHEC O 157 strains with similar frequencies. However, none of these virulence genes were detected by PCR in atypical O 157 strains. Interestingly, five of nine atypical O 157 strains produced cytolethal distending toxin V (CDT-V) and carried genes encoding long polar fimbriae. Macro-restriction fragment enzyme analysis (pulsed-field gel electrophoresis) revealed that these E. coli O 157 strains belong to four main clusters. Multilocus sequence typing analysis revealed that five housekeeping genes were identical in EHEC and EPEC O 157 strains but were different in the atypical O 157 strains. These results suggest that the Hungarian bovine E. coli O 157 strains represent at least two main clones: EHEC/EPEC O 157 :H 7 /NM (nonmotile) and atypical CDT-V-producing O 157 strains with H antigens different from H 7.

Transcriptomes of mid-exponential- and stationary-phase cells were evaluated after 10 min in model apple juice (pH 3. 5) using microarrays probing 4, 886 open reading frames. A total of 331 genes were significantly induced upon exposure of cells to model apple juice, including genes involved in the acid, osmotic, and oxidative stress responses as well as the envelope stress response. Acid and osmotic stress response genes, including asr, osmC, osmB, and osmY, were significantly induced in response to model apple juice. Multiple envelope stress responses were activated as evidenced by increased expression of CpxR and Rcs phosphorelay-controlled genes. Genes controlled by CpxR (cpxP, degP, and htpX) were significantly induced 2 - to 15 -fold upon exposure to apple juice. Inactivation of CpxRA resulted in a significant decrease in survival of O 157 :H 7 in model apple juice compared to the isogenic parent strain.

STEC O 26 is considered to have evolved from enteropathogenic (EPEC) O 26 strains through the acquisition of Shiga toxin (Stx) -encoding genes. Our PCR data identified several STEC-like strains expressing all features of STEC except Stx production and carrying remnants of Stx phages that were probably derivatives of EHEC O 26. EHEC and EPEC O 26 strains phenotypically resemble O 26 EHEC-like and apathogenic E. coli O 26 strains and are therefore undistinguishable by cultural methods. A clear discrimination between the different O 26 groups is required for diagnostics in patients and for control of food safety. To develop an assay for specific detection of EHEC and EHEC-like O 26 strains, we used a high-throughput PCR approach for selection of discriminative genetic markers among 33 tested genes mostly encoding type III secretion system effector proteins. The genes ECs 1822, nleH 1 - 2, nleA, nleC, nleH 1 - 1, nleG, nleG 2, nleG 6 - 1, nleG 6 - 2, <b>espJ,</b> espM 2, nleG 8 - 2, espG, ent (or espL 2), nleB, nleE, efa 1, and espB were detected at different frequencies in O 26 EHEC, EHEC-like, and EPEC strains, indicating the possible role of these genes in virulence of human pathogenic O 26 strains. The espK and espN genes were detected only in EHEC and EHEC-like O 26 strains. espK was present in 99. 14 % of EHEC and 91. 14 % of EHEC-like O 26 strains and was hence the best candidate as a genetic marker for characterizing these pathogroups. These data were corroborated by a genotyping real-time PCR test based on allelic discrimination of the arcA (aerobic respiratory control protein A) gene. The results indicate that a combination of molecular detection tools for O 26 wzx (wzxO 26), eae-beta, stx, espK, and arcA genotyping is highly discriminative for clear identification of EHEC and EHEC-like E. coli O 26 strains.

To examine the impact of growth phase on the dynamics of the transcriptome, O 157 :H 7 Sakai strain was cultured in MOPS minimal media (0. 1 % glucose), RNA harvested at 10 time points from early exponential to full stationary phase, and relative gene expression was measured by co-hybridization on high-density DNA microarrays. Expression levels of 14 genes, including those encoding Shiga toxins and other virulence factors associated with the locus of enterocyte effacement (LEE), were confirmed by Q-PCR. Results: Analysis of variance (R/MAANOVA, Fs test) identified 442 (36 %) of 1239 O 157 -specific ORFs and 2110 (59 %) of 3647 backbone ORFs that changed in expression significantly over time. QT cluster analysis placed 2468 of the 2552 significant ORFs into 12 groups; each group representing a distinct expression pattern. ORFs from the largest cluster (n = 1078) decreased in expression from late exponential to early stationary phase: most of these ORFs are involved in functions associated with steady state growth. Also represented in this cluster are ORFs of the TAI island, encoding tellurite resistance and urease activity, which decreased ~ 4 -fold. Most ORFs of the LEE pathogenicity island also decreased ~ 2 -fold by early stationary phase. The ORFs encoding proteins secreted via the LEE encoded type III secretion system, such as tccP and <b>espJ,</b> also decreased in expression from exponential to stationary phase. Three of the clusters (n = 154) comprised genes that are transiently upregulated at the transition into stationary phase and included genes involved in nutrient scavenging. Upregulated genes with an increase in mRNA levels from late exponential to early stationary phase belonged to one cluster (n = 923) which includes genes involved in stress responses (e. g. gadAB, osmBC, and dps). These transcript levels remained relatively high for > 3 h in stationary phase. The Shiga toxin genes (stx 1 AB and stx 2 B) were significantly induced after transition into stationary phase. Conclusion: Expression of more than 300 O 157 -specific ORFs, many implicated in virulence of the O 157 pathogen, was modulated in a growth dependent manner. These results provide a baseline transcriptional profile that can be compared to {{patterns of}} gene expression of this important foodborne pathogen under adverse environmental conditions. </p...|$|E
