5|$|Despite his bluster, Kutuzov {{knew from}} dispatches that his army {{had been too}} badly hurt to fight a {{continuing}} action the following day. <b>He</b> <b>knew</b> <b>exactly</b> what he was doing: by fighting the pitched battle, he could now retreat with the Russian army still intact, lead its recovery, and force the weakened French forces to move even further from their bases of supply. The dénouement became a textbook example of what a hold logistics placed upon an army far from its center of supply. On September8, the Russian army {{moved away from the}} battlefield in twin columns to Semolino, allowing Napoleon to occupy Moscow and await for 5 weeks a Russian surrender that would never come.|$|E
25|$|Ellis {{started out}} in {{department}} store retailing in the Richmond, Virginia, area to gain experience in the fashion industry as a buyer and merchandiser at the department store Miller & Rhoads. While there, he was co-founder of Richmond retail shop A Sunny Day. He later joined the sportswear company John Meyer of Norwich in New York City. Eventually, in the mid-1970s, he was approached by his then employer, The Vera Companies, famous for their polyester double-knit pantsuits, to design a fashion collection for them. Soon after that, Ellis presented his first women's sportswear line, called Portfolio, in November 1976. Although he could not sketch, <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> <b>exactly</b> how the industry worked and proved a master of innovative ideas who created 'new classics' that American women longed for at the time.|$|E
500|$|When {{they were}} going to record the song, Bailey said that he was excited, nervous, and [...] "almost over-prepared for it", <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> <b>exactly</b> what {{instruments}} were going on every track; it took three days to record. Before the release the song was remixed by Sadkin at RAK Studios, in London. About the process Bailey commented: [...] "You know what a great producer is? It's someone who takes great ideas and makes them into good records. In our field, great music is a hit record." [...] The song became the Thompson Twins' biggest hit in America, {{but at the same time}} it pressured the band to produce top-selling music, even if they were not completely comfortable with that, as Alannah Currie stated in an interview with David Oriard of The Spokesman-Review: ...|$|E

500|$|Phips sailed {{from the}} Downs on 12 September 1686, and on 28 November arrived in Hispaniola, Samana Bay, where they {{spent two weeks}} {{restocking}} their water and provender. The weather was bad, and the search consequently did not get under way {{for a few more}} weeks. January 12, Phips sent out Captain Rogers in the smaller Henry of London along with three Native American divers (Jonas Abimeleck and John Pasqua, name of other diver not listed) to search what was then called the Ambrosia Bank (now the Silver Bank). There was a bit more delay from weather but Peter Earle writes, [...] "There is no doubt that <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> <b>exactly</b> where he was going." [...] January 20, they spotted cannons from a shipwreck lying on the white sands of the reef. The ship they had found was the Almiranta of the Spanish silver fleet (later determined to be Nuestra Señora de la Concepción; the English did not know the name of the ship) wrecked in 1641. Over the next two days, the divers were able to bring up 3,000 coins and 3 silver bars. They decided to travel back to Phips' to let him know but {{this turned out to be}} a somewhat slow and treacherous trip among the reefs.|$|E
2500|$|Brown had a {{reputation}} in the Assembly {{for his ability to}} manage people. Brown attained the vote of Doris Allen by treating her with the respect she thought she deserved. Republican State Senator Ken Maddy of Fresno noted Brown’s ability to “size up the situation and create, sometimes on the spot, a winning strategy.” According to Hobson, [...] "He was a brilliant day care operator. ... <b>He</b> <b>knew</b> <b>exactly</b> how to hold the hand of his Assembly members.

2500|$|While {{out walking}} on New Years Day 1987, Drummond {{formulated}} {{a plan to}} make a hip-hop record. However, [...] "I wasn't brave enough to go and do it myself", he said. [...] "...although I can play the guitar, and I can knock out a few things on the piano, I knew nothing, personally, about the technology. And, I thought, I knew Jimmy , I {{knew he was a}} like spirit, we share similar tastes and backgrounds in music and things. So I phoned him up that day and said 'Let's form a band called The Justified Ancients of Mu-Mu'. And <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> <b>exactly,</b> to coin a phrase, 'where I was coming from'".|$|E

2500|$|As the Belmont Stakes {{was held}} only 12 {{days after the}} Met Mile, Croll elected to bypass it to focus on races later in the year. [...] "The last thing I {{want to do is}} {{jeopardize}} his future," [...] he said. Holy Bull returned in the Dwyer Stakes at Belmont Park on July 3, where he faced only three rivals. Once again, he went to the early lead then pulled away in the stretch to win by [...] lengths. [...] "He's an amazing horse," [...] said Croll, who had shipped Holy Bull in from Monmouth Park {{on the day of the}} race. [...] "This morning, getting on the van, <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> <b>exactly</b> where he was going. If I hadn't put him on the van, he'd have been disappointed." ...|$|E
2500|$|Java (November 27, 1966) – Two tube-like Muppets (which were {{designed}} by Frank Oz) dance to the Al Hirt song [...] "Java." [...] Jim Henson and Frank Oz performed the two puppets and the explosion that provides the punchline was achieved by Jerry Juhl shooting off a fire extinguisher. It {{should be noted that}} as the three of them prepared to go onstage that night right before Ed Sullivan introduced them, Jerry Juhl suddenly realized that he left the fire extinguisher in their dressing room which was up on the second floor. Jerry Juhl raced to the elevator hearing the [...] "Java" [...] music through the speakers in the elevator so <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> <b>exactly</b> how much time he had left until it was too late. Jerry Juhl managed to grab the fire extinguisher, run back to the elevator, and make the trip back down to the stage {{just in time for the}} climax. This sketch was reprised on May 26, 1968. The act even was done on Stuffed and Unstrung (an evolved counterpart of Puppet Up!).|$|E
2500|$|During the 1960s and 1970s, he was {{involved}} in shows for the BBC and Thames Television (as well as Frankie Howerd Reveals All for Yorkshire Television in 1980). Ray Galton and Alan Simpson wrote for him from 1964 to 1966 when he worked for the BBC and also for a one-off show for Thames, Frankie Howerd meets the Bee Gees, shown on 20 August 1968. He was famous for his seemingly off-the-cuff remarks to the audience, especially in the show Up Pompeii!, which was a direct follow-up from Forum. His television work was characterised by direct addresses to camera and by his littering monologues with verbal tics such as [...] "Oooh, no missus" [...] and [...] "Titter ye not". A later sale of his scripts, however, showed that the seemingly off-the-cuff remarks had all been meticulously planned. Barry Cryer said of his technique: [...] "What he could do with a script was amazing, like all the great performers. He transformed something you'd just written – what you hoped was in a Frankie Howerd idiom – but when you heard him do it, my God, it was something else; – it was gossiping over the garden wall, the apparent waffle – he was like a tightrope walker, you thought he's going to fall off in a minute, you thought , 'Come on, Frank' , we're waiting for a laugh, and then, suddenly, Bang. <b>He</b> <b>knew</b> <b>exactly</b> what he was doing." [...] Another feature of his humour was to feign innocence about his obvious and [...] double entendres, while mockingly censuring the audience for finding them funny.|$|E

5000|$|In the NFL, Belk {{proved to}} be a versatile, reliable, and very {{intelligent}} football player, starting at both defensive end and tackle.

5000|$|It’s {{really cool}} {{to work with}} a {{director}} who’s done so much, because <b>he</b> <b>knows</b> <b>exactly</b> what <b>he</b> wants.

60|$|Then {{the little}} scene faded away, {{and he remembered}} the tedious present.

He was on his way home to Peak Hall. <b>He</b> <b>knew</b> <b>exactly</b> the welcome which was awaiting him. <b>He</b> <b>knew</b> <b>exactly</b> the news he would receive.

5000|$|The track may be {{considered}} an autobiographical account of Edwards' attempts to hold down any meaningful relationships. [...] "Revol" [...] is [...] "lover" [...] spelt backwards.
