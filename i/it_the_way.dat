Drought and {{epidemics}} had fatally affected the Russian economy while oprichnina had thoroughly disrupted the government. Following the defeat of Crimean and Nogai forces in 1572, oprichnina was wound down and with <b>it</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> Russian armies were formed also changed. Ivan IV had introduced a new strategy whereby he relied on {{tens of thousands of}} native troops, Cossacks and Tatars instead of a few thousand skilled troops and mercenaries, as was the practice of his adversaries.|$|E

25|$|While pheromones {{explain the}} pharaoh ant's {{remarkable}} foraging ability, each forager’s uncanny capability {{to find its}} {{way back to the}} nest requires a different explanation. In fact, the pharaoh ant relies on geometry to show <b>it</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> home. Each fork in the trail system spreads at an angle between 50 and 60 degrees. When returning to the nest, a forager that encounters a fork will almost always take the path that deviates less from its current direction. In other words, it will never choose an acute angle that would drastically change its direction. Using this algorithm, each forager is able to find its way back to the nest. If the fork angle is experimentally increased to an angle between 60 and 120 degrees, M. pharaonis foragers were significantly less able to find their nest. This method of decision-making reduces the wasted energy that would result from traveling in the wrong direction and contributes to the pharaoh ant's efficiency in foraging.|$|E

25|$|If {{the people}} {{come to believe that}} the {{constitution}} is not a text like other texts; if it means, not what it says or what it was understood to mean, but what it should mean, in light of the evolving standards of decency that mark the progress of a maturing society, they will look for qualifications other than impartiality, judgment, and lawyerly acumen in those whom they elect to interpret it. More specifically, they will look for people who agree with them as to what those evolving standards have evolved to; who agree with them as to what the constitution ought to be. If the courts are free to write the constitution anew, they will write <b>it</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> the majority wants; the appointment and confirmation process will see to that.

[...] The short rap [...] "Working for the Master" [...] that is sung by N.E.P.T.R. was written by Sugar.

500|$|The {{first single}} from Nobody's Daughter was [...] "Skinny Little Bitch", {{released}} in {{promotion of the}} album in March 2010. The album received mixed reviews.

Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine also gave the album three out of five stars, saying, [...] "It's Marianne Faithfull's substance-ravaged voice {{that comes to mind}} most often while listening to songs like 'Honey' and 'For Once in Your Life'. The latter track is, in fact, one of Love's most raw and vulnerable vocal performances to date... the song offers a rare glimpse into the mind of a woman who, for the last 15 years, has been as famous for being a rock star as she's been for being a victim." [...] Love and the band toured internationally from 2010 into late 2012 promoting the record, after which she dropped the Hole name and returned to a solo career.|$|E
500|$|The novel {{presents}} Eli as an androgynous boy, castrated {{centuries before}} by a sadistic vampire nobleman.

When Oskar asks Eli to become his girlfriend, Eli tries to tell Oskar [...] "I'm not a girl". An actress plays Eli's character, but her voice was considered to be too high pitched, so it was dubbed by voice actress Elif Ceylan. According to an interview with the director, as the film was originally conceived, flashbacks explained this aspect in more detail, but these scenes were eventually cut. In the end, Ajvide Lindqvist was satisfied with the adaptation. When Alfredson showed him eight minutes of footage for the first time, he [...] "started to cry because it was so damn beautiful".
