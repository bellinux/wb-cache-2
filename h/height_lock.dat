The base {{appears to be}} a heavy composite plastic material with steel bars or plates added for additional weight. The platter is die-cast aluminum having a thickness of 0.110". At the center of the underside of the platter a 3.520" [...] diameter, 0.210" [...] thick, ceramic magnetic ring bonded to the platter is used to magnetically secure the platter to a 3.800" [...] diameter steel plate on the spindle assembly. Two large finger holes in the platter are provided for lifting the platter off of the spindle. The platter and ceramic magnet assembly weighs 1.84 lbs. The integrated aluminum tonearm assembly includes the tonearm counterweight with stylus pressure ring, rest/clamp, lift lever, lift adjustment, plus calibrated anti-skate control, height, <b>height</b> <b>lock,</b> and tracking force adjustments. The tonearm rest/clamp and adjustment dials are plastic. The die-cast metal headshell is of the standard removable type. A generously sized LCD display on the Pro models indicates speed setting, play/pause, pitch, quartz lock, and direction of platter rotation. The ground wire and audio output leads are permanently attached. A removable, hinged plastic dust cover was included.|$|E
40|$|Summary. The stabifity of an {{aircraft}} with automatic throttle and elevator controls {{has been investigated}} theoretically using an analogue computer. Throttle application proportional to change in airspeed,, incidence, or rate of pitch may provide damping of the long-period motion, but speed is shown {{to be the most}} suitable variable. The control of {{an aircraft}} having negative static margin is considered and shown to require either the addition of an integral control on the throttle or a combination of throttle and elevator controls. Where it is required to control height by means of the elevator, some aircraft flying under certain conditions can only be adequately stabilised by means of an automatic throttle control. 1. Introduction. The longitudinal stability of various aircraft with automatic throttle control has been investigated theoretically. Several types of throttle control have been studied.

40|$|We {{study the}} flow of particle-laden {{turbidity}} currents down a slope and over an obstacle. A high-resolution 2 D computer simulation model is used, based on the Navier-Stokes equations. It includes poly-disperse particle grain sizes in the current and substrate. Particular {{attention is paid to}} the erosion and deposition of the substrate particles, including application of an active layer model. Multiple flows are modeled from a lock release that can show the development of sediment waves (SW). These are stream-wise waves that are triggered by the increasing slope on the downstream side of the obstacle. The initial obstacle is completely erased by the resuspension after a few flows leading to self consistent and self generated SW that are weakly dependant on the initial obstacle. The growth of these waves {{is directly related to the}} turbidity current being self sustaining, that is, the net erosion is more than the net deposition. Four system parameters are found to influence the SW growth: (1) slope, (2) current <b>lock</b> <b>height,</b> (3) grain <b>lock</b> concentration, and (4) particle diameters. Three phases are discovered for the system: (1) "no SW", (2) "SW buildup", and (3) "SW growth". The second phase consists of a soliton-like SW structure with a preserved shape. The phase diagram of the system is defined by isolating regions divided by critical slope angles as functions of current <b>lock</b> <b>height,</b> grain <b>lock</b> concentration, and particle diameters.

5000|$|The {{floating}} arm trebuchet uses a counterweight held {{on top of}} a tall drop {{channel to}} transfer potential energy into kinetic energy. A projectile is loaded into a sling {{at the end of the}} throwing arm. Upon releasing the trigger, the counterweight is allowed to drop through the channel. This causes the wheel on the axle of the arm to impact the glide track, which is usually held steady with strong support beams. While this is happening, the wheel is moved backwards by the torque acting on the arm from the counterweight. [...] The arm then jerks forward and releases the projectile from the sling. To reset the device, the counterweight must be raised back to the original <b>height</b> and <b>locked</b> in with the trigger mechanism.|$|R
25|$|A drop lock can {{consist of}} two {{conventional}} lock chambers {{leading to a}} sump pound, or a single long chamber incorporating the sump - although the term properly applies only to the second case. As the pounds {{at either end of}} the structure are at the same <b>height,</b> the <b>lock</b> can only be emptied either by allowing water to run to waste from the sump to a lower stream or drain, or (less wastefully) by pumping water back up to the canal. Particularly in the two-chamber type, there would be a need for a bypass culvert, to allow water to move along the interrupted pound and so supply locks further down the canal. In the case of the single-chamber type, this can be achieved by keeping the lock full and leaving the gates open while not in use.|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: Turbidites were {{produced}} experimentally by releasing suspensions of spherical beads from a lock into a 6 m long horizontal channel. Flow properties were varied by changing initial flow geometry, and sediment size, sorting, and {{concentration in the}} initial suspension. Initial flow geometry was varied using two lengths of lock (0. 29 and 0. 59 m) and four depths (0. 15, 0. 2, 0. 3 and 0. 4 rn). To vary {{the properties of the}} initial suspension, three nearly uniform sizes (2. 0, 2. 7, and 3. 6 phi) of glass beads and one (2. 5 phi) of plastic beads (specific gravity 1. 52) were used, and all experiments were run at concentrations of 20 % and 40 % by volume. The effect of poor sorting was investigated by mixing the coarse and fine glass beads to produce a poorly sorted sediment with a median grain size equal to that of the intermediate-size glass beads. Bed thickness was almost uniform near the source except for beds deposited from poorly sorted sediment suspensions, which tended to be wedge-shaped. High concentration produced more uniform bed thickness, and (for equal volume of sediment) shorter, thicker beds. Increases in <b>lock</b> <b>height</b> and length increased bed thickness almost equally. If all other variables were held constant, bed thickness was directly proportional to grain size. The dimensionless ratio of the square of bed thickness divided by the volume of suspension (per unit width) was found to be directly proportional to the dimensionless ratio of settling velocity divided by the speed of the head of the current. The 'constant' in the regression equation appears to depend mainly on the sediment concentration. The experimentally determined equation gives plausible values for turbidity current velocities when extrapolated to scales over a million times larger than those of the experiments...|$|R
40|$|Reynolds number flowing along a {{tank with}} a V-shaped valley. We use {{experiments}} {{and a box}} model to determine the primary features of the flow. The particulate gravity currents were initiated by releasing a fixed volume of fluid consisting of pure water mixed with silicon carbide particles from a lock {{at one end of}} the tank. The resulting motion and deposit pattern differ significantly from those for the propagation of a particulate gravity current along a flat-bottomed tank. The front of the current, seen from above, is approximately parabolic (with axis parallel to the flow direction) in contrast to the current in a flat-bottomed tank where it is nearly a straight line perpendicular to the flow. This feature mimics the results for pure saline currents. When seen in profile the currents do not have a clearly defined raised head, which is a feature of the flat-bottomed currents. The mass deposited per unit area varies nearly monotonically with respect to distance down the tank, again in contrast to the case of the flat-bottomed tank. The exceptions to this are the two experiments which have the highest ratio of <b>lock</b> <b>height</b> to length. The mass deposited per unit area across the V-shaped valley is much larger in the central part of the valley than it is on the flanks for any position along the valley. We find that the results can be described with remarkable accuracy by a box model using a generalization of the equation for sedimentation from a turbulent medium due to Martin and Nokes. Our results further show that the factor used in the deposition rate equation which is commonly assumed to be 1 should be smaller, typically 0. 7. 1...|$|R
