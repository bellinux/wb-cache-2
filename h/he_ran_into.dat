Eventually <b>he</b> <b>ran</b> <b>into</b> a lake and drowned himself.|$|E
5|$|Discovered by Alex Gordon as an unproduced {{screenplay}} by Hollywood writer Frank Quattrocchi, The Projected Man {{was directed by}} Ian Curteis; {{it would be the}} first theatrical film that he would direct. However, due to his lack of experience, <b>he</b> <b>ran</b> <b>into</b> several problems during filming. As the film fell behind schedule and the budget kept increasing, he was fired during the film's final stages. Producer John Croydon replaced him; however, Croydon remained uncredited as the producers did not wish to publicise the problems which had occurred on set.|$|E

One night, years earlier, Miller's left him after <b>he</b> <b>ran</b> <b>into</b> the road amidst oncoming traffic, almost killing himself in a hallucinatory state. After Black leaves, Hans Ingram (Gregory Itzin), the doctor responsible for the trial, breaks into Miller's room.|$|E

5|$|Some of {{the other}} senior {{officers}} in the Armed Forces Council were not so lucky, and they were caught by Phát's troops inside headquarters, while other buildings of the military complex remained under junta control. Khánh managed to escape to Vũng Tàu. His plane was just emerging from the hangar and lifted off just as rebel tanks were rolling in, attempting to block the runway and shut down the airport. Phát's ground troops also missed capturing Kỳ, who fled through the streets in a sports car {{with his wife and}} mother-in-law. Kỳ ended up at Tân Sơn Nhất, where <b>he</b> <b>ran</b> <b>into</b> Khánh; the pair flew off together to regroup.|$|E
5|$|After {{starting}} {{out in the}} Delhi junior system, Kartik moved through the age group ranks at Railways, was selected for the Indian Under-19 team. He made his first-class debut in 1996–97 {{and after a few}} productive seasons at domestic level, made his Test debut in early-2000 as Kumble's bowling partner. However, <b>he</b> <b>ran</b> <b>into</b> disciplinary problems and was expelled from the National Cricket Academy in the same year, while new national captain Sourav Ganguly was reluctant to entrust him with responsibility. Ganguly called for off spinner Harbhajan to be recalled in 2001, and was rewarded with a series-winning performance against Australia. This entrenched the off spinner in the team and left Kartik on the outer.|$|E
5|$|Although {{there was}} never an {{official}} tour of the album, the band gigged in the UK to promote the album. They played dates in Ireland and Scandinavia, and in late October the band was to embark on their first tour of the United States. It was unsuccessful, {{mainly because of the}} mental breakdown of Barrett. In his capacity as tour manager, Andrew King travelled to New York to begin preparations, but <b>he</b> <b>ran</b> <b>into</b> serious problems. Visas had not arrived, prompting the cancellation of the first six dates. The band finally flew across the Atlantic on 1 November, but work permits were not yet obtained, so they settled into a hotel in Sausalito, California, just north of San Francisco. After a number of cancellations, the first US performance was given 4November at Winterland Ballroom, following Janis Joplin fronting Big Brother and the Holding Company.|$|E

5|$|Among {{the more}} {{original}} castings was Anette Sagen, the world's leading female ski jumper, {{in her first}} film role. Sagen, 22 at the time, played the part of 70-year-old Owe's ski jumping mother, although in a younger incarnation. Hamer had already considered Sagen for the role, when <b>he</b> <b>ran</b> <b>into</b> her by chance at the Holmenkollen Ski Museum. Without knowing to whom he was talking, Hamer mentioned that he was shooting a film in this location, and was planning to ask Anette Sagen to be in it. The reason the theme of ski jumping was chosen was that Hamer's own mother performed the sport, and the film {{has been described as}} a tribute to all female ski jumpers. Sagen herself had also earlier been involved in a controversy over women's access to professional venues and competitions. Incidentally, Sagen and Owe are also both from the Norwegian town of Mosjøen.|$|E
5|$|An {{academic}} career required a doctorate, so in 1921 Urey {{enrolled in a}} PhD program at the University of California, Berkeley, where he studied thermodynamics under Gilbert N. Lewis. His initial attempt at a thesis was on the ionization of cesium vapor. <b>He</b> <b>ran</b> <b>into</b> difficulties, and an Indian physicist published a better paper on the same subject. Urey then wrote his thesis on the ionization states of an ideal gas, which was subsequently published in the Astrophysical Journal. After he received his PhD in 1923, Urey was awarded a fellowship by the American-Scandinavian Foundation to study at the Niels Bohr Institute in Copenhagen, where he met Werner Heisenberg, Hans Kramers, Wolfgang Pauli, Georg von Hevesy, and John Slater. At the conclusion of his stay, he traveled to Germany, where he met Albert Einstein and James Franck.|$|E
5|$|Charlton {{received}} treatment midway {{throughout the}} second half after <b>he</b> <b>ran</b> <b>into</b> a photographer chasing an over-hit pass. Leeds had an attack soon after, but after Storrie received the ball from Bremner, his pass went behind the Liverpool goal. Liverpool had more chances, but St. John slipped at the back post when a Callaghan cross was diverted towards him. Then Thompson saw a shot saved by Sprake. Leeds reacted to the increased pressure, by moving Bremner to centre-forward and Giles reverting to midfield. Johanneson switched positions with Storrie, moving from the right to the left. Liverpool continued to press for a winner as the half drew to a close, but Thompson and Strong saw shots saved by Sprake. Neither team managed to score before full-time and the match went to extra time, {{the first time this}} happened since the 1947 final.|$|E

5|$|Commander George Eyre {{took over}} command of Speedy in February1794. Speedy {{supported}} the siege and capture of Bastia, after which Eyre {{was ordered to}} join Diadem off Nice. While making his way there on 9June, <b>he</b> <b>ran</b> <b>into</b> a French fleet under Rear-Admiral Pierre Martin, which had sailed from Toulon several days earlier. Eyre attempted to escape, but the wind and sea favoured the larger vessels, and Speedy was chased down and captured. Eyre was brought aboard Admiral Martin's flagship {{and was told that}} the National Convention had recently ordered that no quarter should be given to the English or Hanoverians, and that had Martin's ship been first alongside, he would have sunk Speedy. The sudden appearance of a British fleet curtailed the interview, and the French hurried back to Gourjean roadstead outside Toulon, taking Speedy and the captured British crew with them.|$|E
5|$|The Jets snapped their {{losing streak}} in a 27–13 {{victory over the}} St. Louis Rams in which Sanchez {{completed}} 15 of his 20 passes for 178 {{yards and a touchdown}}. However, his struggles continued in a rematch against New England on Thanksgiving night. Despite completing 26 of 36 of his pass attempts for 301 yards and a touchdown and interception, the Jets lost to the Patriots 49–19 and fell to 4–7 as Sanchez turned the ball over twice—each turnover led to Patriots touchdowns. The Jets surrendered 21 points within a 53-second span on 3 turnovers. The play that earned Sanchez the most criticism was a second-quarter fumble where <b>he</b> <b>ran</b> <b>into</b> the backside of lineman Brandon Moore and the Patriots scored on the resulting fumble; this play, becoming widely known as the butt fumble, was mocked in the media.|$|E
5|$|At dawn, the British {{began to}} land on the shore, Clinton's advance guard of 4,000 British light {{infantry}} and Hessian jägers landing first. Inland, opposing them, was a brigade of some 750 men under the command of John Glover. Glover was atop a hill with a telescope when he noticed the British ships. (hill {{on the west side of}} the Hutchinson River Parkway and the Hutchinson River on East Sanford Blvd. in Mount Vernon, NY on the opposite side of the Hutchinson River Parkway and Pelham Memorial High School) Glover sent an officer, Major William Lee, to report to Charles Lee, Washington's second in command, and ask for orders. However, Lee did not give any orders, and in the absence of orders Glover chose to attack. Glover turned out his brigade, which consisted of the 14th, 13th, 3rd and the 26th Continental Regiments. Glover left the 150 men of the 14th Continentals behind in reserve. Glover had not closed half the distance when <b>he</b> <b>ran</b> <b>into</b> approximately 30 skirmishers. Glover ordered a Captain and his 40-man company forward as an advance guard to hold the British in check, while Glover organized the rest of the force.|$|E

5|$|Noriega {{graduated}} from Chorrillos in 1962 with a specialization in engineering. He returned to Panama {{and joined the}} Panama National Guard. Posted to Colón, {{he was given a}} commission as a second lieutenant in September 1962. His commanding officer in Colón was Omar Torrijos, then a Major in the National Guard. Torrijos became a patron and mentor to Noriega, protecting him when <b>he</b> <b>ran</b> <b>into</b> trouble. In a 1962 incident, according to journalist John Dinges, Torrijos helped Noriega avoid legal problems after a prostitute accused Noriega of beating and raping her. Soon after, Noriega's drinking and violence obliged Torrijos to confine him to his quarters for a month. Despite Noriega's problems, Torrijos maintained their relationship, ensuring they were always in the same command; he also brought Díaz Herrera into the same unit. Díaz Herrera and Noriega became both friends and rivals for Torrijos's favor. In 1966, Noriega was again involved in a violent incident, allegedly raping a 13-year-old girl and beating her brother. After this Torrijos transferred Noriega to a remote posting.|$|E
5|$|The {{outbreak}} of the War of the Second Coalition saw Schérer with 43,000 troops facing Paul Kray with 50,700 Austrians near Verona and 24,551 Russians under Alexander Suvorov marching up in support. Hoping to maul Kray before his Russians allies arrived, Schérer opted to attack. On 26 March 1799 in the Battle of Verona, the French gained a success at Pastrengo in the north, fought to a draw in front of Verona and were drubbed in the south at Legnago. In the north Sérurier drove the Austrians from Rivoli Veronese. On the 27th Kray rapidly shifted his strength to the north to assist his outnumbered right wing. Schérer shuffled the positions of his divisions which exhausted the soldiers without accomplishing anything. Belatedly, Schérer tried push his advantage in the north by sending Sérurier with 6,000 troops to advance on Verona from the north. On 30 March <b>he</b> <b>ran</b> <b>into</b> 15,000 Austrians at Parona and was badly defeated, losing 600 killed and wounded and 1,177 prisoners. Austrian casualties numbered only 390.|$|E
5|$|Vermigli's Eucharistic {{views were}} {{accepted}} in Zürich, but <b>he</b> <b>ran</b> <b>into</b> controversy over his doctrine of double predestination. Similarly to John Calvin, Vermigli believed {{that in some}} way God wills the damnation of those not chosen for salvation. Vermigli attempted to avoid confrontation over the issue, but Bibliander began to openly attack him in 1557, at one point allegedly challenging him to a duel with a double-edged axe. Bibliander held the Erasmian view that God only predestines that those who believe in him will be saved, not the salvation of any individual. Reformed theologians during this time held a variety of beliefs about predestination, and Bullinger's position is ambiguous, but they agreed that God sovereignly and unconditionally chooses whom to save. They believed salvation is not based on any characteristic of a person, including their faith. Bullinger and the Zürich church did not necessarily agree with Vermigli's double predestinarian view, but Bibliander's view was deemed unallowable. He was dismissed in 1560, in part to assure other Reformed churches of the Zürich church's orthodoxy. Vermigli was involved in predestinarian controversy again when Zanchi, who had remained in Strasbourg when Vermigli left for Zürich, was accused of heretical teachings on the Eucharist and predestination by the Lutheran Johann Marbach. Vermigli was selected to write the official judgement of the Zürich church on the matter in a statement signed by Bullinger and other leaders December1561. His affirmation of a strong doctrine of predestination represented the opinion of the Zürich church as a whole.|$|E
