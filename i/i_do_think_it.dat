But <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> was a growing period in my life where I learned what it takes. And maybe not winning one kept me that much more hungry when we came over to Bolles." ...|$|E
2500|$|Series creator Ryan Murphy also commented about McDermott's therapy scene, [...] "As soon as {{we wrote}} this scene, I said, 'Couldn't Dylan play this part? Does he look enough like Zach and Sarah ?' And we all held up {{pictures}} in the writer's room. We wrote one scene and I offered it to him {{so that was a}} happy accident. And then Brooke Smith just auditioned [...] and that was a happy accident. <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> came together in a weird tribute to many things but that was all by accident." ...|$|E

60|$|BARBARA. Why, madam, <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> was a {{case with}} Mr. Austin.|$|R
60|$|RICARDOS. <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> {{my duty to}} my {{daughter}} to ask that he make compensation to her.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Because it {{does the}} lads good to see New Zealand,, and because the Bishop, who knows better than <b>I</b> <b>do,</b> <b>thinks</b> <b>it</b> right.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes;--from Mr. Monk. <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> will {{be bad for}} {{the country}} that this measure should come {{from the hands of}} Mr. Daubeny." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'He has {{suffered}} for it, and pretty severely, and <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> has done him good. You {{must remember that}} he had great disadvantages.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, Fanny, that's {{all he can}} do for us; and <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> 's {{the most}} {{outrageous}} thing in the world! It 's real mean!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Those boys,' said Lance. 'What, Sum and Frank? Well, <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> queer {{that the}} sailors {{on board the}} Kittiwake called every one My Lord.' ...|$|R
60|$|BOBBY. No. I {{wouldnt have}} said {{it in front of}} Dora; but <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>think</b> <b>it's</b> not quite the same thing my knowing her and you knowing her.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Well,' {{continued}} Robina, glad to {{pour out}} her troubles, even for such counsel as this, 'when I came home last week, <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> {{would be made}} up.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Then <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> is very selfish in him,' said Alda, 'when {{every one}} of us wants change! I'm as languid as possible; and look at Cherry.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't {{think it}} would make any {{difference}} to them, sir; {{but at the same time}} <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> would be as well not to tell them." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, my dear, it IS such a pity {{they don't}} {{get on with}} those Mallorings! <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> sad they weren't brought {{up to go to}} church." ...|$|E
6000|$|Fumbling at {{the handle}} of the door as he went out: 'It's hard on you, sir, <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>think</b> <b>it's</b> hard on you. Ain't you going to do anything, sir?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But Miss Pauline {{is neither}} a king nor a queen of Munster, an' <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>think</b> <b>it's</b> a bit over-heavy," [...] objected Mrs Welsh, as she lifted the {{structure}} with difficulty.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes. He {{must have}} known that nothing would change me,--at least, nothing that he could <b>do.</b> <b>I</b> thought of that. I shouldn't like him to feel that I couldn't {{appreciate}} <b>it,</b> even if <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> was silly. Should you write to him?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't {{think it}} was quite so bad as you say, Miss Prettyman; but, upon the whole, <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> is a shame. But what can we do?" ...|$|E
6000|$|HOW do {{you like}} to go up in a swing, [...] Up in the air so blue? [...] Oh, <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> the pleasantest thing [...] Ever a child can do! ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Oh, papa, <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> {{would be}} great fun; {{it would be so}} curious {{not to be able to}} walk about, and to see {{everything}} rolling and tumbling. Don't you think so, boys?' ...|$|E
6000|$|The grey girl smiled. [...] "Oh, I {{thought that}} at first." [...] Then, with an admiring look: [...] "But <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>think</b> <b>it's</b> rather a shame for you, you're so pretty. Perhaps they'd {{put you on}} to {{tabulation}} work, though that's awfully dull. We'll ask your cousin." ...|$|R
5000|$|Yes, <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> {{was going}} to be great, all the work was so good, every actor was inspired, and Altman's team was {{intensely}} competent, and he was that rare kind of genius who knows what works and what doesn't at the moment it is happening.|$|R
6000|$|... 'No,' said Wilmet, {{even now}} keeping herself {{blind to the}} offensiveness of Alda's suggestion; 'but as it is utterly {{impossible}} for me to <b>think</b> of--leaving home, <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> would have been wiser {{to put a stop to}} it while there wa--is time,' and the tears began to gather again.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, not in one way, my dear; for {{you know}} that, personally, I like him almost {{as well as}} you do. Still, <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> is a little unfortunate that we ever knew him before." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Both in {{excellent}} health, and both write charmingly. I must really {{let you see}} the letter of Henrietta, as <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> is quite creditable to her: I will step into my room and get it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I do {{not think}} of finding a husband for {{the girl in the}} 55th, or any other regiment, I can promise you, brother; though <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> getting to be time that the child were respectably married." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And do you remember, Jean," [...] {{continued}} Bourdin, [...] "when M. Henri dashed down again, how the traitor rebels hallooed out, 'Fire {{upon the}} red scarf!' Well, <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> was all {{up with him}} then. You were close to him, Jean; nearer than I am to Lolotte now." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, dear, I don't {{know that}} <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>think</b> <b>it,</b> but <b>I</b> am only putting a {{parallel}} case to your own. No, you must consent: {{it is in}} all ways best. We will be married on the morning I start, so as just to give time for our wedding breakfast before I mount." ...|$|R
6000|$|She stared hard at her finger-nails. [...] "It is hard {{to express}} one's self, but <b>I</b> <b>do</b> want {{to be honest with}} you.

I was grateful." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well;--I {{was going}} to explain. <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> a great pity that Tom and Ayala should not become man and wife. If ever any young man ever did love a girl I believe that he loves her." ...|$|E
60|$|GEORGE. <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> {{is because}} she is so loyal, and good and {{straight}} that I saw so clearly what a cad I was. I think I found courage to do the only possible thing in her frankness and honesty.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Ah! poor lad, I suppose {{your feet}} has got spread with wearing those old ones; {{but you should}} try to use {{yourself}} to decent ones, or you'll soon be barefoot; and <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> was a pity to drink them up.' ...|$|E

6000|$|... "I {{have read}} a {{paragraph}} {{in the paper}} about poor Mr. Summerhay's death. And, oh, I feel so sorry for her! She was so good to me; <b>I</b> <b>do</b> feel it most dreadfully.
