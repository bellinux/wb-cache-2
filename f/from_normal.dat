5|$|Angle-resolved low-coherence {{interferometry}} (a/LCI) uses {{scattered light}} {{to measure the}} sizes of subcellular objects, including cell nuclei. This allows interferometry depth measurements to be combined with density measurements. Various correlations have been found between the state of tissue health and the measurements of subcellular objects. For example, {{it has been found}} that as tissue changes <b>from</b> <b>normal</b> to cancerous, the average cell nuclei size increases.|$|E

40|$|We {{measured}} H 2 O 2 release {{by human}} alveolar macrophages (AM) <b>from</b> <b>normals</b> and sarcoid patients in suspension immediately after bronchoalveolar lavage {{in the presence}} and absence of the triggering agent, phorbol myristate acetate (PMA). AM from 11 sarcoid patients produced a mean (+/- SE) of 21. 7 +/- 2. 3 and 5. 9 +/- 3. 4 nmol H 2 O 2 / 10 (6) macrophages in the presence and absence of PMA, respectively. By contrast, AM <b>from</b> <b>normals</b> (n = 6) produced 9. 8 +/- 1. 7 and 1. 6 +/- 0. 7 nmol H 2 O 2 / 10 (6) macrophages with and without PMA, respectively. Macrophage activation, as monitored by H 2 O 2 production, did not correlate with the angiotensin-converting enzyme levels, the result of gallium- 67 scans, or the percent of lymphocytes in the bronchoalveolar lavage. To determine whether AM <b>from</b> <b>normals</b> could be stimulated to increase their H 2 O 2 production to the level seen in patients with sarcoid, we measured H 2 O 2 released by adherent AM after incubation in each of four potential activating agents: recombinant interferons alpha A, beta, gamma (rIFN alpha A, rIFN beta, and rIFN gamma, respectively), and 1, 25 -dihydroxyvitamin D 3. H 2 O 2 release in the range seen in sarcoid patients could be induced in PMA-triggered AM <b>from</b> <b>normals</b> by rIFN gamma in a time- (t 1 / 2 approximately 1 d) and dose-dependent fashion (threefold increase, EC 50 5 antiviral U/ml) and by rIFN alpha A and rIFN beta at higher concentrations, but not by 1, 25 -dihydroxyvitamin D 3...|$|R

5|$|Munitions and {{ammunition}} handling is accomplished using a Babcock designed highly mechanised weapons handling system (HMWHS). This {{is a first}} naval application of a common land-based warehouse system. The HMWHS moves palletised munitions from the magazines and weapon preparation areas, along track ways and via several lifts, forward and aft or port and starboard. The tracks can carry a pallet to magazines, the hangar, weapons preparation areas, and the flight deck. In a change <b>from</b> <b>normal</b> procedures the magazines are unmanned, the movement of pallets is controlled from a central location, and manpower is only required when munitions are being initially stored or prepared for use. This system speeds up delivery and reduces {{the size of the}} crew by automation.|$|E

5|$|The {{scales are}} highly curved, which creates inter-scale reflection. This {{mechanism}} is unusual among Lepidoptera. The proximal {{part of each}} scale is almost flat; the scale then gradually curves up and then steeply bends down at the distal end, covering the proximal part of the next row of scales. Because of this shape, adjacent rows of scales have valley-like grooves between them. This allows light to strike one scale, reflect at a roughly 90Â° angle, strike the next scale, and be reflected away from the wing. Because the angle of each reflection is far <b>from</b> <b>normal</b> incidence, the interference effect favours reflection of different colours of light than are seen when light strikes {{near the top of}} the curved part of the scale.|$|E

5|$|Dynamic editing {{contributed to}} the surrealistic nature of the episode. Abrupt cuts from {{close-up}} to extreme wide angles and sudden shifts <b>from</b> <b>normal</b> speed to super slow-motion are used in Buffy's dream: several sequences become slow-motion partway through them, then revert to normal speed as they continue. Xander's dream features mismatches between sound and image: characters are sometimes shown not speaking even as their voices are heard. Additionally, silence is used frequently, to both reflect the characters' disorientation and to unsettle the audience. Whedon cited films by Steven Soderbergh as his main inspirations for the odd editing, especially The Limey and The Underneath. He also listed Orson Welles' version of The Trial and Stanley Kubrick's Eyes Wide Shut as inspirations for many of his shooting and editing decisions.|$|E
5|$|Enamel is {{the hardest}} and most highly mineralized {{substance}} of the body. It {{is one of the}} four major tissues which make up the tooth, along with dentin, cementum, and dental pulp. It is normally visible and must be supported by underlying dentin. 96% of enamel consists of mineral, with water and organic material comprising the rest. The normal color of enamel varies from light yellow to grayish white. At the edges of teeth where there is no dentin underlying the enamel, the color sometimes has a slightly blue tone. Since enamel is semitranslucent, the color of dentin and any restorative dental material underneath the enamel strongly affects the appearance of a tooth. Enamel varies in thickness over the surface of the tooth and is often thickest at the cusp, up to 2.5mm, and thinnest at its border, which is seen clinically as the CEJ. The wear rate of enamel, called attrition, is 8 micrometers a year <b>from</b> <b>normal</b> factors.|$|E

The police officers wear full uniform, and are intended to be a highly visible presence. Their uniform is sometimes different <b>from</b> <b>normal</b> police officers in that the upper half of their yellow fluorescent jackets is blue. Civilian photographers are also employed by the police to work alongside FITs.

5|$|Operationally, RAF Bomber Command and the U.S. Strategic Air Command cooperated in the Single Integrated Operational Plan (SIOP) {{to ensure}} {{coverage}} of all major Soviet targets from 1958, 108 aircraft of the RAF's V-Bombers were assigned targets under SIOP {{by the end}} of 1959. From 1962 onwards, two jets in every major RAF base were armed with nuclear weapons and on standby permanently under the principle of Quick Reaction Alert (QRA). Vulcans on QRA standby were to be airborne within four minutes of receiving an alert, as this was identified as the amount of time between warning of a USSR nuclear strike being launched and it arriving in Britain. The closest the Vulcan came to taking part in potential nuclear conflict was during the Cuban Missile Crisis in October 1962, where Bomber Command was moved to Alert Condition 3, an increased state of preparedness <b>from</b> <b>normal</b> operations; however, it stood down in early November.|$|E
5|$|The JVX {{aircraft}} was designated V-22 Osprey on 15 January 1985; by that March, {{the first six}} prototypes were being produced, and Boeing Vertol was expanded {{to deal with the}} project workload. Work has been split evenly between Bell and Boeing. Bell Helicopter manufactures and integrates the wing, nacelles, rotors, drive system, tail surfaces, and aft ramp, as well as integrates the Rolls-Royce engines and performs final assembly. Boeing Helicopters manufactures and integrates the fuselage, cockpit, avionics, and flight controls. The USMC variant of the Osprey received the MV-22 designation and the U.S. Air Force variant received CV-22; this was reversed <b>from</b> <b>normal</b> procedure to prevent Marine Corps Ospreys from having a conflicting designation with aircraft carriers (CV). Full-scale development of the V-22 tilt-rotor aircraft began in 1986. On 3 May 1986, the Bell Boeing partnership was awarded a $1.714 billion contract for V-22 aircraft by the U.S. Navy. At this point, all four U.S. military services had acquisition plans for V-22 versions.|$|E
5|$|The Pichilemu {{earthquake}} {{was caused}} by the change in regional stress from the 27February earthquake. Preliminary analyses by the United States Geological Survey (USGS) of the 11March earthquake locations and seismic-wave radiation patterns suggested that the event resulted <b>from</b> <b>normal</b> faulting within the subducting Nazca plate or the overriding South America plate, unlike the 27 February earthquake, which occurred as thrust faulting on the interface between the two plates. Later in 2010, University of Chile Seismologist Sergio Barrientos stated that the earthquake was produced inside the South American plate. While news media reported the earthquake as an aftershock of the February earthquake in Chile, a preliminary geological summary issued by the USGS considered it to be an independent earthquake, a conclusion which seismologist Jaime Campos of the University of Chile also reached.|$|E
