50|$|An optician, or <b>dispensing</b> <b>optician,</b> is a {{technical}} practitioner who designs, fits and dispenses corrective lenses for the correction of a person's vision. Opticians determine the specifications of various ophthalmic appliances {{that will give}} the necessary correction to a person's eyesight. Some registered or licensed opticians also design and fit special appliances to correct cosmetic, traumatic or anatomical defects. These devices are called shells or artificial eyes. Other registered or licensed opticians manufacture lenses to their own specifications and design and manufacture spectacle frames and other devices.|$|E

50|$|The {{parameters}} specified on spectacle prescriptions vary {{but typically}} include {{the power to}} which each lens should be made in order to correct blurred vision due to refractive errors, including myopia, hyperopia, astigmatism, and presbyopia. It is typically determined using a phoropter and asking the patient which of two lenses is better, or by computer automated refractor, or through the technique of retinoscopy. A <b>dispensing</b> <b>optician</b> will take a prescription written by an optometrist or ophthalmologist and order and/or assemble the frames and lenses to then be dispensed and sold to the patient.|$|E

Congratulations to British <b>dispensing</b> <b>optician</b> Timothy Bowden for his dogged {{determination}} in researching, writing and essentially self-publishing this hefty tome. How does one tackle the monumental task of tracking the complex history {{of the development of}} the contact lens, from the production of the first human artificial glass eyes by Ludwig Müller-Uri in Germany in 1835 to the sophisticated, high-technology, multi-billion dollar contact lens industry of today? The superficial answer may seem simple: do it chronologically, but it is much more difficult than that. Multiple contemporaneous and seemingly unconnected events often converged to result in ideas that elevated contact lens technology to the next level and many developments revolved around the deliberate and sometimes accidental activities of a long list of enthusiasts, inventors, entrepreneurs, businessmen, technicians, scientists, engineers, polymer scientists, opticians, optometrists and ophthalmologists...|$|E

40|$|YesAim: To {{assess the}} ability of {{critical}} flicker frequency (CFF) and optimal reading speed (ORS) to predict the potential vision in patients with cataract with and without ocular comorbidity. Methods: The two novel tests were compared with two well established potential vision tests (PVTs), the potential acuity meter (PAM) and the laser interferometer (LI). Measurements were made preoperatively in 1 eye of 88 subjects using the battery of 4 PVTs. Postoperative measurements were made with the CFF and the ORS. The subjects studied were consecutive cases over a 12 -month period who fulfilled the inclusion and exclusion criteria, and {{agreed to participate in}} this study. Results: CFF was the PVT most resistant to the presence of cataract. Both CFF and ORS give a similar predictive precision in the presence of cataract and ocular comorbidity, although CFF seems more precise when the cataract is dense. Conclusions: The PAM and the LI showed a limited clinical capability in predicting postoperative visual acuity, particularly with dense opacities. The CFF shows the most promise as a PVT, particularly with dense cataract. Further evaluation is required for both CFF and ORS. Federation of Ophthalmic and <b>Dispensing</b> <b>Optician...</b>|$|E
40|$|YesPurpose. A {{recent study}} {{suggested}} that updated spectacles could increase falls rate in older people. We hypothesized {{that this may}} be due to changes in spectacle magnification and this study assessed the effects of spectacle magnification on adaptive gait. Methods. Adaptive gait and visual function was measured in 10 older adults (mean age 77. 1 ¿ 4. 3 years) with the participants¿ optimal refractive correction and when blurred with + 1. 00 DS, + 2. 00 DS, - 1. 00 DS and - 2. 00 DS lenses. Adaptive gait measurements for the lead and trail foot included foot position before the step, toe clearance of the step edge and foot position on the step. Vision measurements included visual acuity, contrast sensitivity and stereoacuity. Results. The blur lenses led to equal decrements in visual acuity and stereoacuity for the + 1. 00 DS and - 1. 00 DS and the + 2. 00 DS and - 2. 00 DS lenses. However, they had very different effects on adaptive gait compared to the optimal correction: Positive blur lenses led to an increased distance of the feet from the step, increased vertical toe clearance and reduced distance of the lead heel position on the step. Negative lenses led to the opposite of these changes. Conclusion. The adaptive gait changes did not mirror the effects of blur on vision, but were driven by the magnification changes of the lenses. Steps appear closer and larger with positive lenses and further away and smaller with negative ones. Magnification likely explains the mobility problems some older adults have with updated spectacles and after cataract surgery. Federation of Ophthalmic and <b>Dispensing</b> <b>Optician...</b>|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this survey}} was to review 187 {{transcripts}} from the United Kingdom’s General Optical Council (GOC) Disciplinary and Fitness To Practise (FTP) Committee hearings from 2001 to 2011 {{in order to identify}} common themes and thereby help practitioners to avoid the more frequently occurring pitfalls that were recorded during this period. The study covered changes in GOC FTP regulations in 2005, which involved a change from a disciplinary to a fitness to practise process. The number of cases was very small compared to the total number of optometrist and <b>dispensing</b> <b>optician</b> registrants, which was 13709 in 2001 - 02 rising to 18582 in 2010 - 11. The main findings indicated that between 2001 and 2011 there was a three times greater likelihood that male registrants versus female registrants would be brought in front of a GOC Disciplinary or FTP Committee. In terms of erasures from the GOC registers between 2001 and 2011, male registrants {{were also more likely to}} be erased than females. The male: female split for erasures between 2001 and 2011 was five: one, increasing to seven: one when considering the situation post the 2005 GOC FTP rule change. Of the cases brought before the Disciplinary and FTP Committees between 2001 and 2011, it was noted that cases implicating theft and fraud were most frequent representing 27 % of hearings examined (17 % involving NHS fraud and 10 % theft or fraud from an employer). The examination of transcripts revealed other hearings were more complex. These hearings often had a primary reason for the investigation that highlighted further secondary concerns that also required investigation...|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} was to {{investigate}} how visual information is organised in perceptual short term memory, with special interest in colour, spatial frequency and velocity. Previous studies of VSTM have indicated the existence of specific memory mechanisms for visual attributes such as orientation, spatial frequency, velocity, contrast and colour. The retention of information in visual short term memory for these basic visual attributes can be disrupted by the presentation of masking stimuli during inter-stimulus intervals (ISIs), which are outside the range of traditional sensory masking. We exploited this memory masking effect {{in order to examine}} the organisation of visual information in VSTM. Four groups of experiments were conducted in which participants carried out a delayed discrimination paradigm that employed a two-alternative forced choice (2 -AFC) procedure in conjunction with a method of constant stimuli. The fidelity of VSTM was measured by performance markers such as discrimination thresholds and point of subjective equalities. We have found selective memory masking effects, which serve as further evidence in favour of the modular organisation in VSTM, namely, that human visual perceptual memory is based upon multiple, tuned channels in case of colour, spatial frequency and speed, similar to those found in the earliest stages of visual processing for spatial frequency. Moreover, each of these storage mechanisms are tuned to a relatively narrow range of stimulus parameters that are closely linked to visual discrimination mechanisms. These findings add further support to the view that low-level sensory processing mechanisms form the basis for the retention of colour, spatial frequency and velocity information in perceptual memory. We also found evidence for the broad range of transfer of memory masking effects across spatial location, which indicates more long range, long duration interactions between channels that are likely to rely upon contributions from neural processes located in higher visual areas. In conclusion, the experiments presented in this thesis provide significant insight into the organization of visual information in perceptual short term memory.
