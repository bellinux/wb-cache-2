5000|$|Typically, {{children}} with LKS develop normally, but then lose their language skills. While many affected individuals have clinical seizures, some only have <b>electrographic</b> seizures, including <b>electrographic</b> status epilepticus of sleep (ESES). The first {{indication of the}} language problem is usually auditory verbal agnosia. This is demonstrated in patients in multiple ways including the inability to recognize familiar noises and the impairment {{of the ability to}} lateralize or localize sound. In addition, receptive language is often critically impaired, however in some patients, impairment in expressive language is the most profound. In a study of 77 cases of Landau-Kleffner syndrome, 6 were found to have this type of aphasia. Because this syndrome appears during such a critical period of language acquisition in a child's life, speech production may be affected just as severely as language comprehension. [...] The onset of LKS is typically between 18 months and 13 years, the most predominant time of emergence being between 3 and 7 years.|$|E

50|$|Alexanders law {{refers to}} {{spontaneous}} nystagmus that occurs after an acute unilateral vestibular loss. It was first described in 1912 and has three elements {{to explain how}} the vestibulo-ocular reflex responds to an acute vestibular insult. The first element says that spontaneous nystagmus after an acute vestibular impairment has the fast phase directed toward the healthy ear. The direction of the nystagmus, by convention, is named for the fast phase, so the spontaneous nystagmus is directed toward the healthy ear. The second element says nystagmus is greatest when gaze is directed toward the healthy ear, is attentuated at central gaze and may be absent when gaze is directed toward the impaired ear. The third element says that spontaneous nystagmus with central gaze is augmented when vision is denied. This became apparent with the implementation of <b>electrographic</b> testing.|$|E
50|$|A seizure is {{described}} as large amounts of synchronized action potentials which cause the body to perform uncontrollable muscle contractions resulting in involuntary movement and an incapacity to control ones actions. This synchronized action potential must surpass a certain threshold, which is different for each patient, which then reverberates throughout the body. For Epileptic patients, seizure occurs constantly and continue to grow in intensity. When a patient suffers from epilepsy, they are always at risk of experiencing a seizure. However, for each patient, different environmental stimuli can cause the patient to experience a seizure. For each patient, the treatment method {{and the success of}} that treatment method is different. Henry Molaison (HM) is known for his contribution to memory studies in neuroscience. Before he lost his ability to retain long term memories, he suffered from crippling seizures. HM, showed small signs of seizures while growing up. Before the age of fifteen HM's only sign of a seizure was a lull in the conversation. For a few seconds he would appear as if he was daydreaming. Some described him as absent minded for a few seconds. His first traumatic seizure happened while he was fifteen. While in the family car, HM experienced a seizure that caused his entire body to convulse. In 1969, A deep brain stimulation experiment was developed to test the fluctuations of thresholds for patients suffering from epilepsy. In this experiment, researchers used implanted electrodes to measure the <b>electrographic</b> activity during the introduction of a stimulus and the resulting seizure. While this experiment was successful in showing that seizure happened at lower thresholds after repeated treatments, the overall severity of each seizure was not well recorded.|$|E

Methods: Three-center observational cohort study of 90 term neonates treated with hypothermia, monitored with continuous video-EEG (cEEG) within {{the first day of}} life (median age at onset of recording 9. 5 hours, interquartile range 6. 3 - 14. 5), and continued for > 24 hours (total recording 93. 3 hours, interquartile range 80. 1 - 112. 8 among survivors). A pediatric electroencephalographer at each site reviewed cEEGs for <b>electrographic</b> seizures and initial EEG background category. Results: A total of 43 (48 %) had <b>electrographic</b> seizures, including 9 (10 %) with <b>electrographic</b> status epilepticus. Abnormal initial EEG background classification (excessively discontinuous, depressed and undifferentiated, burst suppression, or extremely low voltage), but not clinical variables (including pH < 6. 8, base excess ≤- 220, or 10 -minute Apgar ≤ 3), was strongly associated with seizures. Conclusions: <b>Electrographic</b> seizures are common among neonates with HIE undergoing hypothermia and are difficult to predict based on clinical features.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: Patients with {{suspected}} mesial {{temporal lobe}} (MTL) epilepsy typically undergo inpatient video-electroencephalography (EEG) monitoring with scalp and/or intracranial electrodes for 1 to 2 weeks to localize and lateralize the seizure focus or foci. Chronic ambulatory electrocorticography (ECoG) {{in patients with}} MTL epilepsy may provide additional information about seizure lateralization. This analysis describes data obtained from chronic ambulatory ECoG in patients with suspected bilateral MTL epilepsy {{in order to assess}} the time required to determine the seizure lateralization and whether this information could influence treatment decisions. METHODS: Ambulatory ECoG was reviewed in patients with suspected bilateral MTL epilepsy who were among a larger cohort with intractable epilepsy participating in a randomized controlled trial of responsive neurostimulation. Subjects were implanted with bilateral MTL leads and a cranially implanted neurostimulator programmed to detect abnormal interictal and ictal ECoG activity. ECoG data stored by the neurostimulator were reviewed to determine the lateralization of <b>electrographic</b> seizures and the interval of time until independent bilateral MTL <b>electrographic</b> seizures were recorded. RESULTS: Eighty-two subjects were implanted with bilateral MTL leads and followed for 4. 7 years on average (median 4. 9 years). Independent bilateral MTL <b>electrographic</b> seizures were recorded in 84 %. The average time to record bilateral <b>electrographic</b> seizures in the ambulatory setting was 41. 6 days (median 13 days, range 0 - 376 days). Sixteen percent had only unilateral <b>electrographic</b> seizures after an average of 4. 6 years of recording. SIGNIFICANCE: About one third of the subjects implanted with bilateral MTL electrodes required > 1 month of chronic ambulatory ECoG before the first contralateral MTL <b>electrographic</b> seizure was recorded. Some patients with suspected bilateral MTL seizures had only unilateral <b>electrographic</b> seizures. Chronic ambulatory ECoG in patients with suspected bilateral MTL seizures provides data in a naturalistic setting, may complement data from inpatient video-EEG monitoring, and can contribute to treatment decisions...|$|E
40|$|AbstractPurposeTo {{evaluate}} amplitude-integrated EEG (aEEG) {{in comparison}} with conventional (cEEG) for the identification of <b>electrographic</b> seizures in neonates with acute neonatal encephalopathies. MethodsThirty-one conventional cEEG/aEEG long-term recordings from twenty-eight newborns were reviewed {{in order to assess}} the <b>electrographic</b> seizure detection rate and recurrence in newborns. Two paediatric neurologists and one neonatologist, blinded to the raw full array cEEG, were asked to mark any events suspected to be an <b>electrographic</b> seizures on aEEG. They were asked to decide if the displayed aEEG trace showed the pattern of a single seizure (SS), repetitive seizures (RS) or status epilepticus (SE). Their ability to recognize <b>electrographic</b> seizures on aEEG was compared to seizures identified on full array cEEG. Results 25 of the 31 long-term cEEGs recordings showed <b>electrographic</b> seizures. The two paediatric neurologists and the neonatologist identified SE in 100 % of the reviewed traces using aEEG alone while they identified 49. 4 % and 37. 5 % of <b>electrographic</b> seizures using aEEG alone. Overall, the correct identification ranged from 23. 5 % to 30. 7 % for SS and 66 % for RS. The inter-observer agreement (k) for the identification of SE for the two paediatric neurologists and the neonatologist was 1. 0. Overall the inter-observer agreement (k) for the detection of SS, RS and SE of the two paediatric neurologists was 0. 91. ConclusionsIn our study the observers identified SE in 100 % of the reviewed traces using raw aEEG alone, thus aEEG might represent a useful tool to detect SE in the setting of NICU. SS may not be reliably identified using aEEG alone. Simultaneous recording of the raw cEEG/aEEG provides a good level of sensitivity for the detection of neonatal <b>electrographic</b> seizures...|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Epilepsy affects {{approximately}} 1 % of {{the world}} pop-ulation. Antiepileptic drugs are ineffective in approximately 30 % of patients and have side effects. We are developing a noninvasive, or minimally invasive, transcranial focal electrical stimulation system through our novel tripolar concentric ring electrodes to control seizures. In this study, we demonstrate feasibility of an automatic seizure control system in rats with pentylenetetra-zole-induced seizures through single and multiple stimulations. These stimulations are automatically triggered by a real-time <b>electrographic</b> seizure activity detector based on a disjunctive combination of detections from a cumulative sum algorithm and a generalized likelihood ratio test. An average seizure onset detection accuracy of 76. 14 % was obtained for the test set (n = 13). Detection of <b>electrographic</b> seizure activity was accomplished {{in advance of the}} early behavioral seizure activity in 76. 92 % of the cases. Automatically triggered stimulation significantly (p = 0. 001) reduced the <b>electrographic</b> seizure activity power in the once stimulated group compared to controls in 70 % of the cases.

40|$|For the {{diagnosis}} of <b>electrographic</b> seizures or status epilepticus, we {{reduced the number of}} EEG-electrodes to make urgent EEG monitoring more feasible. Unlike the current existing research, with mixed results, we studied a specific population with postanoxic brain damage, expecting a higher yield of detection of ictal EEG patterns. In a population treated with therapeutic hypothermia post-cardiac arrest, the initial EEGs were reformatted in a longitudinal, a hairline and an 8 -lead montage, and independently reviewed by two investigators. The EEGs were categorized into three categories: one without ictal EEG activity, one with interictal activity and one with probable <b>electrographic</b> seizure(s). Generalized ictal EEG activity was the most frequently observed EEG pattern. The average sensitivity for the detection of probable <b>electrographic</b> seizure(s) was 100  % for the 8 -lead montage and 92  % in the hairline montage. In comparison to the routine longitudinal montage, the 8 -lead montage proved to be reliable for the detection of <b>electrographic</b> seizure activity in a postanoxic population even with limited training in EEG interpretation. The hairline montage did not suffice with regard to the differential diagnosis of triphasic waves associated with metabolic encephalopathy and generalized nonconvulsive status epilepticus, but nonetheless detected the vast majority of probable <b>electrographic</b> seizure(s). Our results support the use of EEG monitoring with fewer electrodes for the detection of ictal EEG activity in the postanoxic population. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|To review recent {{clinical}} {{data and}} summarize actual {{recommendations for the}} management of <b>electrographic</b> seizures and status epilepticus in neuro-ICU patients. <b>Electrographic,</b> 'nonconvulsive', seizures are frequent in neuro-ICU patients including traumatic brain injury, subarachnoid hemorrhage, intracerebral hemorrhage and hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy. Continuous electroencephalography monitoring is thus of great potential utility. The impact of <b>electrographic</b> seizures on outcome however is not entirely established and it is also unclear what type of electroencephalography paroxysms require treatment and when and how exactly to treat them. Evidence from randomized studies is lacking and will not be available in the near future. Given robust animal and human evidence showing the potential negative impact of seizures on secondary cerebral damage and outcome, treatment of seizures appears reasonable, particularly if related to status epilepticus. On the contrary, over-aggressive antiepileptic therapy entails risks. The management of seizures should therefore be guided individually, based on the underlying cause, the severity of illness and patient comorbidities. We provide a pragmatic approach {{for the management of}} <b>electrographic</b> seizures in neuro-ICU patients. International consensus guidelines on continuous electroencephalography monitoring and seizure therapy are needed and would represent the rationale for a future multicenter randomized trial...|$|E
