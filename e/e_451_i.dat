40|$|Introduction. Meat and {{processed}} meats, {{depending on the}} animal species and anatomical element from which they were obtained, exhibit a varied fat content (most typically from 10 % to 80 % dry matter). Fats are relatively unstable food components. The {{aim of this study}} was to determine the effect of an addition of model brines on lipid oxidation rate in the selected beef element stored under aerobic conditions and in vacuum at a temperature of 5 &deg;C. Material and methods. Material for analyses comprised beef: rump cut (R) and the heel of round (L). Meat was cured (at 20 % in relation to raw material weight) with brine A, containing 1 % NaCl in total weight and brine B, containing 1 % NaCl and 0. 3 % sodium tripolyphosphate <b>E</b> <b>451</b> <b>i</b> (including 56 % P 2 O 5). Meat after being massaged was stored under aerobic conditions (T) and in vacuum (P) at a temperature of 5 &deg;C for 15 days. During storage of samples changes were determined in peroxide value (PV), contents of secondary fat decomposition products using the TBARS test as well as changes in pH value. Results. &nbsp; It was observed that with an extension of sample storage time peroxide value was growing gradually, but the dynamics of this growth varied. Samples coming from the rump cut muscle, stored in the atmosphere with unlimited access of oxygen, were characterised by slightly, but statistically significantly higher peroxide values in comparison to the other tested samples. The highest increase in the TBARS test value was observed in samples stored under aerobic conditions and coming from the heel of round muscle, irrespective of the type of applied brine. Conducted analyses showed that vacuum packaging of meat, in comparison to the storage of samples at unlimited access of oxygen, effectively slowed down the increase in the content of secondary oxidation products determined by the TBARS test. The greatest effect of vacuum packaging was observed for the heel of round in brine A. Conclusions. Vacuum packaging, in comparison to storage of experimental samples under aerobic conditions, delayed the increase in peroxide value and effectively slowed down the increase in contents of secondary lipid oxidation products. Statistically significant changes in pH values were observed in the heel of round, irrespective of the type of applied brine, stored under aerobic conditions...|$|E

40|$|The manner {{by which}} effects of {{simultaneous}} mutations combine to change enzymatic activity {{is not easily}} predictable because these effects are not always additive in a linear manner. Hence, the characterization {{of the effects of}} simultaneous mutations of amino acid residues that bind the substrate can make a significant contribution {{to the understanding of the}} substrate specificity of enzymes. In the &# 946;-glycosidase from Spodoptera frugiperda (Sf&# 946;gly), both residues Q 39 and <b>E</b> <b>451</b> interact with the substrate and this is essential for defining substrate specificity. Double mutants of Sf&# 946;gly (A <b>451</b> <b>E</b> 39, S <b>451</b> <b>E</b> 39 and S 451 N 39) were prepared by site-directed mutagenesis, expressed in bacteria and purified using affinity chromatography. These enzymes were characterized using p-nitrophenyl &# 946;-galactoside and p-nitrophenyl &# 946;-fucoside as substrates. The k cat/Km ratio for single and double mutants of Sf&# 946;gly containing site-directed mutations at positions Q 39 and <b>E</b> <b>451</b> was used to demonstrate that the effect on the free energy of ES&# 8225; (enzyme-transition state complex) of the double mutations (&# 8710;&# 8710;G&# 8225;xy) is not the sum of the effects resulting from the single mutations (&# 8710;&# 8710;G&# 8225;x and &# 8710;&# 8710;G&# 8225;y). This difference in &# 8710;&# 8710;G&# 8225; indicates that the effects of the single mutations partially overlap. Hence, this common effect counts only once in &# 8710;&# 8710;G&# 8225;xy. Crystallographic data on &# 946;-glycosidases reveal the presence of a bidentate hydrogen bond involving residues Q 39 and <b>E</b> <b>451</b> and the same hydroxyl group of the substrate. Therefore, both thermodynamic and crystallographic data suggest that residues Q 39 and <b>E</b> <b>451</b> exert a mutual influence on their respective interactions with the substrate.

40|$|The {{fluorescence}} of a fluorophore {{depends on}} its environment, and if attached to a protein it may report on conformational changes. We have combined two-electrode voltage clamp with simultaneous fluorescence measurements to detect conformational changes in a type IIb Na(+) /P(i) cotransporter expressed in Xenopus oocytes. Four novel Cys labelled with a fluorescent probe yielded voltage-and substrate-dependent changes in fluorescence (F). Neither Cys-substitution nor labelling significantly altered the mutants' electrogenic properties. Different F responses to voltage and substrate were recorded at the four sites. S 155 C, located in an intracellular re-entrant loop {{in the first half}} of the protein, and <b>E</b> <b>451</b> C, located in an extracellular re-entrant loop in the second half of the protein both showed Na(+), Li(+) - and P(i) -dependent F signals. S 226 C and Q 319 C, located at opposite ends of a large extracellular loop in the middle of the protein, mainly responded to changes in Na(+) and Li(+). Hyperpolarization increased F for S 155 C and S 226 C, but decreased F for Q 319 C and <b>E</b> <b>451</b> C. The labelling and F response of S 155 C, confirmed that the intracellular loop containing Ser- 155 is re-entrant as it is accessible from the extracellular milieu. The behavior of S 155 C and <b>E</b> <b>451</b> C indicates a strong involvement of the two re-entrant loops in conformational changes during the transport cycle. Moreover, the data for S 226 C and Q 319 C suggest that also the large extracellular loop is associated with transport function. Finally, the reciprocal voltage-dependencies of the S 155 C-E 451 C and S 226 C-Q 319 C pairs suggest reciprocal conformational changes during the transport cycle for their respective local environments...|$|R

5000|$|Bradbury wrote many short {{essays on}} the arts and culture, {{attracting}} the attention of critics in this field, but he used his fiction to explore and criticize his culture and society. Bradbury observed, for example, that Fahrenheit 451 touches on the alienation of people by media: In writing the short novel Fahrenheit <b>451</b> <b>I</b> thought I was describing a world that might evolve in four or five decades. But {{only a few weeks}} ago, in Beverly Hills one night, a husband and wife passed me, walking their dog. I stood staring after them, absolutely stunned. The woman held in one hand a small cigarette-package-sized radio, its antenna quivering. From this sprang tiny copper wires which ended in a dainty cone plugged into her right ear.

The former downregulate CD 46, the putative cellular receptor of MV, are positive for hemadsorption, and are fusogenic in HeLa cells, whereas the latter are negative for these phenotypic markers. CD 46 downregulation in particular, could have profound consequences for the immunopathology of MV infection, as this molecule protects the cell from complement lysis. Mutagenesis of two amino acids, valine and tyrosine at positions 451 and 481, respectively, in the H protein from the vaccine-like Hallé MV strain to their counterparts, glutamate and asparagine, in the H protein from the wild-type Ma 93 F MV strain (creating the V 451 E/Y 481 N double mutation) abrogated CD 46 downregulation, HeLa cell fusion, and hemadsorption. The converse double mutagenesis of the Ma 93 F H protein (<b>E</b> <b>451</b> V/N 481 Y) transferred the CD 46 -downregulating, fusogenic, and hemadsorption functions to this protein.

We investigated Ca 2 +-dependent movements as changes in FRET between exchanger proteins tagged with CFP or YFP at position 266 within the large cytoplasmic loop. Data indicate that the exchanger assembles as a dimer in the plasma membrane. Addition of Ca 2 + decreases {{the distance between the}} cytoplasmic loops of NCX pairs.

FRET studies of CBD 1, CBD 2, and CBD 1 –CBD 2 peptides displayed Ca 2 +-dependent movements with different apparent affinities.

Haemorrhagic cystitis was never observed nor did premature ovarian failure in the 25 female patients at risk. Four patients developed neoplasia and three died suddenly a few days after receiving a CPM pulse but the causal relationship between CPM therapy and these poor outcomes is speculative.

In yeast, Rho 1 p {{is involved in}} bud formation. A yeast strain in which RHO 1 is replaced with RhoA shows a recessive temperature-sensitive growth phenotype. A dominant suppressor mutant was isolated from this strain. Molecular cloning of the suppressor gene revealed that the mutation occurred at the pseuodosubstrate site of PKC 1, a yeast homolog of mammalian protein kinase C. Two-hybrid analysis demonstrated that GTP-Rho 1 p, but not GDP-Rho 1 p, interacted with the region of Pkc 1 p containing the pseudosubstrate site and the C 1 domain. MKK 1 and MPK 1 encode MAP kinase kinase and MAP kinase homologs, respectively, and function downstream of PKC 1. A dominant active MKK 1 - 6 mutation or overexpression of MPK 1 suppressed the temperature sensitivity of the RhoA mutant.

However, knowledge of nuclear forces and the mechanisms governing the structure of nuclei, in particular far from stability, is still incomplete. In nuclei with equal neutron and proton numbers (N=Z), enhanced correlations arise between neutrons and protons (two distinct types of fermions) that occupy orbitals with the same quantum numbers. Such correlations have been predicted to favour an unusual type of nuclear superfluidity, termed isoscalar neutron- proton pairing $^{ 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 }$, in addition to normal isovector pairing. Despite many experimental efforts, these predictions have not been confirmed. Here we report the experimental observation of excited states in the N =Z 46 nucleus $^{ 92 }$Pd. Gamma rays emitted following the $^{ 58 }Ni(^{ 36 }Ar, 2 n) ^{ 92 }$Pd fusion-evaporation reaction were identified {{using a combination of}} state-of-the-art high-resolution c-ray, charged-particle and neutron detector systems.

In the present report, we further examine the interaction of these two oxidase components by using random-sequence peptide phage display library analysis. Screening p 47 -phox with the peptide libraries identified five potential sites of interaction with flavocytochrome b, including three previously reported regions of interaction and two additional regions of interaction of p 47 -phox with gp 91 -phox and p 22 -phox. The additional sites were mapped to a domain on the first predicted cytosolic loop of gp 91 -phox encompassing residues S 86 TRVRRQL 93 and to a domain near the cytosolic C-terminal tail of gp 91 -phox encompassing residues F 450 EWFADLL 457. The mapping also confirmed a previously reported binding domain on gp 91 -phox (E 554 SGPRGVHFIF 564) and putative Src homology 3 domain binding sites on p 22 -phox (P 156 PRPP 160 and G 177 GPPGGP 183).

40|$|Previous phase-resolved spectropolarimetric {{observations}} of the AM Herculis systems V 834 Centauri (<b>E</b> 1405 - <b>451)</b> and EF Eridani have shown broad, Zeeman-shifted absorption features during the bright phases. These features {{are thought to be}} nonphotospheric in origin, and to arise from a cool 'halo' of unshocked gas surrounding the accretion shock {{on the surface of the}} white dwarf primary. Preliminary models for the accretion halo region are presented and these models are used to perform a more detailed analysis of the relevant data for these two systems than has previously been done. To explain the observed halo Zeeman features, geometries which are consistent with the presence of linearly extended cyclotron emission regions are required. Such regions have previously been deduced from different considerations by other investigators. The estimated masses for the accretion halo are comparable to the mass of the cyclotron emission region...|$|R
40|$|Original article can {{be found}} via: [URL] Copyright Royal Astronomical Society [Full text {{of this article is}} not {{available}} in the UHRA]The authors report photometry and polarimetry of the AM Her-type binary <b>E</b> 1405 - <b>451.</b> For the first time circular polarization has been detected in such an object at wavelengths longer than 1 ??m. The light curves and polarization curves at J and H show a minimum centred on the optical minimum but very much narrower. At H significant polarization is only observed for a short period {{on either side of the}} minimum. The observations are in good agreement with the predictions of cyclotron models. The form of the polarization curve indicates that the accretion column is always in the hemisphere of the white dwarf towards us, and that the field becomes almost parallel to the line-of-sight at the phase of the minimum...|$|R
40|$|AbstractWe {{compared}} the amino acid sequences of groups of receptor (CD 46) downregulating and nondownregulating measles virus (MV) hemagglutinins (Hs) and identified seven group-specific differences as {{candidates for the}} mediation of the observed differential effects. Using site-directed mutagenesis, we mutated the chosen amino acids of the H of MV-strain WTF (WTF-H), a nondownregulating H, and introduced the corresponding amino acids of Edmonston-H (Edm-H), a downregulating H. We identified four amino acids, 211 G, 243 R, 451 V, and 481 Y, which influenced the downregulative function when introduced into WTF-H. The double mutation 451 V and 481 Y in WTF-H led to a degree of CD 46 downregulation {{comparable to that of}} Edm-H. Conversely, introducing amino acids <b>451</b> <b>E</b> and 481 N into Edm-H resulted in a loss of the downregulative function. These results indicate that these amino acids play a decisive role in the H-CD 46 interaction...|$|R
40|$|The {{results of}} {{millisecond}} optical photometry of the DQ Herculis stars EX Hya, H 2252 - 035, V 1223 Sgr, and AE Aqr obtained at the Las Campanas Observatory and Cerro Tololo Inter-American Observatory {{during the years}} 1985, 1986, and 1987 are reported. The data for coherent and incoherent features are searched for. Coherent features (other than those previously known) were not detected for frequencies between 0. 1 and 250 Hz at 4 -sigma upper limits of 0. 05 - 0. 4 percent. Evidence is not found for 1 - 3 s, quasi-coherent features. Such features have been detected in the optical emission of the AM Her objects AN UMa, EF Eri, and <b>E</b> 1405 - <b>451.</b> Because of the similarities between AM Her and DQ Her objects, {{it was suggested that}} such quasi-coherent features might also be found in the DQ Her objects...|$|R
40|$|Something entirely fictions and true, that creeps {{across your}} path hallowing your evil ways. –Amiri Baraka My art is an {{investigation}} of my cultural identity through the exploration of power {{as it relates to}} social stratification. My desire is to create art pieces that serve as a backdrop for a mythology on which I question the ecology of low income communities of color and their relation with other social classes as well as the perception of the people within those communities. My work is heavily influenced by sci-fi literature such as Brave New World and Fahrenheit <b>451.</b> <b>I</b> believe themes in science fiction are analogous to the contemporary Black experience in America. Being the descendants of a people who were stolen from their home- taken to a new distant world and over generations evolved to survive their extreme circumstances. Therefore, I have created a world of mythical beings {{in a number of different}} mediums that personify the complexity within hierarchies of power in everyday life. These entities which are hybrids of appropriated 19 th century animal illustrations, objects within my and environment and my hand drawn figures from contemporary Black culture, are in the vein of the Dadaist, who appropriated and recontexualized images from society in order to make “anti-art”. Namely Hans Arp, who considered the destruction of “signs” as a subversive act.   The signs I’m interested in are the tropes associated with the Black body within the American psyche. These entities are inspired by personal experiences from a rural working class, upbringing, in Red Springs, North Carolina, such as seeing childhood friends mutate into drug dealers then disappear into the streets. I am creating a mythology for my hometown in these gods and goddesses that are the personification of a psychology that is a result of one’s particular placement within the social ladder.   Inspired by Amiri Baraka poem “Something in the Way of Things”, these beings live in the intangible spaces that exist between the nuances of class and race. They are both born of and perpetuate the actions and thought processes due to social reproduction.   Within my paintings and collages, we have these mythical beings interacting with each other to suggest a narrative. They exist in an abstracted purgatory. The deities themselves are collages of signifiers of contemporary Blackness and tradition western colonial motifs.   In my installations, the use of a found objects such as shovels, sheet-rock and tires can signify the industries of agriculture, construction and factory labor that are specific to my memories of Red Springs. These utilitarian objects are placed with the wheat-pasted figures along walls. Wheat-paste which has a history of being a lost cost method of political activism that communicates a particular ideology to a large number of people.   The deities enchant and interact with the 3 dimensional objects, activating them in way that speaks to socioeconomic conditions of a specific geographic region...|$|R
