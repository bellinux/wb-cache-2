Detailed catalytic mechanisms of RuO 2 during supercritical water gasification of common polyolefin plastics including low-density polyethylene (LDPE), high-density polyethylene (HDPE), polypropylene (PP) and polystyrene (PP), have been investigated in a batch reactor at 450 °C, 60 min.

The downhole reservoir hydrothermal reactions were assumed to be in equilibrium, and hence, the Gibbs reactor was used. It was found that high W/C ratios and low O/C ratios are required to maximise <b>gasification</b> <b>efficiency</b> at a constant hydrocarbon feed flowrate, while {{the opposite is true}} for the energy efficiency. This occurs due to the dependence of process energy efficiency on the gas pressure and temperature at surface, while the <b>gasification</b> <b>efficiency</b> depends on the gas composition which is determined by the reservoir reaction conditions which affects production distribution.

Counties {{all over the world}} are paying more and more attention to biomass because it can effectively reduce greenhouse effect due to its zero carbon dioxide emission. Among the biomass utilization technologies, biomass gasification for combined heat and power is an attractive solution for utilizing biomass effectively. The biomass gasification was studied based on the dual fluidized-bed gasifier developed by the Vienna University of Technology, which has been successfully demonstrated in Güssing, Austria. Aspen Plus V 8 was used for the modelling and simulation of the biomass gasification process. The gasifier was modeled using minimum Gibbs free energy method. The key operating parameters including the feed steam temperature, feed air temperature, steam to biomass ratio, and the gasification temperature were varied using the sensitivity analysis block of Aspen Plus. The effects of changing the parameters on the output syngas composition, LHV of the syngas, char split fraction and the <b>gasification</b> <b>efficiency</b> were studied. The sensitivity analysis results indicated that both preheating the feed steam and air have positive effect on increasing the LHV of the syngas and the <b>gasification</b> <b>efficiency.</b> Preheating air is more effectively than preheating the steam. Increasing the steam to biomass ratio results in the increase of the hydrogen yield and the proportion of hydrogen content in the syngas, while the increase of the S/B had negative effects on increasing the LHV of the syngas and the <b>gasification</b> <b>efficiency.</b> Increasing the gasification temperature resulted in the decrease of the <b>gasification</b> <b>efficiency</b> and the hydrogen yield, while it had positive effect on the increase of the LHV of the syngas. The gasification results behaved a little different when the steam to biomass ratio and the gasification temperature are low. Base on the results, it was found that the optimum gasification temperature should be kept around 750 - 850 ℃, the steam to biomass ratio should be kept around 0. 4 - 0. 6.

40|$|Under Cooperative Agreement No. DE-FC 36 - 00 GO 10529 for the Department of Energy, General Atomics (GA) is {{developing}} Supercritical Water Partial Oxidation (SWPO) {{as a means}} of producing hydrogen from low-grade biomass and other waste feeds. The Phase I Pilot-scale Testing/Feasibility Studies have been successfully completed and the results of that effort are described in this report. The Key potential advantages of the SWPO process is the use of partial oxidation in-situ to rapidly heat the gasification medium, resulting in less char formation and improved hydrogen yield. Another major advantage is that the high-pressure, high-density aqueous environment is ideal for reaching and gasifying organics of all types. The high water content of the medium encourages formation of hydrogen and hydrogen-rich products and is especially compatible with high water content feeds such as biomass materials. The high water content of the medium is also effective for gasification of hydrogen-poor materials such as coal. A versatile pilot plant for exploring gasification in supercritical water has been established at GA's facilities in San Diego. The Phase I testing of the SWPO process with wood and ethanol mixtures demonstrated <b>gasification</b> <b>efficiencies</b> of about 90 %, comparable to those found in prior laboratory-scale SCW gasification work carreid out at the University of Hawaii at Manoa (UHM) as well as other biomass gasification experience with conventional gasifiers. As in the prior work at UHM, a significant amount of the hydrogen found in the gas phase products is derived from the water/steam matrix. The studies at UHM utilized an indirectly heated gasifier with an acitvated carbon catalyst. In contrast, the GA studies utilized a directly heated gasifier without catalyst, plus a surrogate waste fuel. Attainment of comparable <b>gasification</b> <b>efficiencies</b> without catalysis is an important advancement for the GA process, and opens the way for efficient hydrogen production from low-value, dirty feed materials. The Phase I results indicate that a practical means to overcome limitations on biomass slurry feed concentration and preheat temperatuare is to coprocess an auxiliary high heating value material. SWPO coprocessing of tow hgih-water content wastes, partially dewatered sewage sludge and trap grease, yields a scenario for the production of hydrogen at highly competitive prices.

The dry gas composition of uncatalyzed gasification of algae in SCW mainly comprised of CO 2, CO, CH 4, H 2, and some C 2 −C 3 compounds. Higher temperatures, low algae concentrations, and longer residence times favored the algae <b>gasification</b> <b>efficiency</b> (GE). The addition of catalysts to the capillaries resulted in higher yields of hydrogen and lower CO yields via enhanced water−gas shift activity. The addition of catalysts accelerated the <b>gasification</b> <b>efficiency</b> up to a maximum of 84 % at 600 °C and 2 min reaction time with nickel-based catalysts. Complete gasification is achieved at higher temperatures (700 °C) and with excess amounts of (Ru/TiO 2) catalyst.

This method has many advantages compared with conventional gasification technologies. Energy-intensive drying step can be avoided and wet biomass can be directly used [20]. Furthermore, water in its supercritical condition has low density and dielectric constant. Consequently, it changes from polar solvent into non-polar solvent and organic compound can be easily solved in it [21]. Many researchers have investigated supercritical water gasification of real biomass and its organic compounds. Lu et al. investigated the gasification of many agricultural residues in 25  MPa and 650  °C.

The reactions were carried out at temperatures of 400 °C, 450 °C and 500 °C and reaction times of up to 60 min using 15 wt% of bio-oil feed. Increased ruthenium oxide loading led to increased carbon <b>gasification</b> <b>efficiencies</b> (CGE) and bio-methane production. Hence, using the 20 wt% RuO 2 /γ-Al 2 O 3 catalyst, CGE was 97. 4 wt% at 500 °C and methane yield reached nearly 30 wt% of the bio-oil feed, which gave a CH 4 /CO 2 molar ratio of 1. 28. There was evidence that the RuO 2 was involved in the initial conversion of the bio-oil to carbon oxides and hydrogen as well as the reduction of the CO 2 to methane via CO methanation. However, competition for CO consumption via the water-gas shift reaction was also possible due to the large presence of water as the reaction medium. This work therefore demonstrates that high concentrations of heavy fraction of bio-oil can be catalytically converted to a methane-rich gas product under hydrothermal conditions at moderate temperatures.

Samples of the sawdust were rapidly treated in subcritical water and with added Na 2 CO 3 (alkaline compound) and Nb 2 O 3 (solid acid) at 280 °C, 8 MPa. Each pre-processing route resulted in a solid recovered product (SRP), an aqueous residue and a small amount of gas composed mainly of CO 2.

Using the catalyst, carbon <b>gasification</b> <b>efficiencies</b> and methane selectivity increased with increasing reaction time.

It was found that the addition of CO 2 had less impact on syngas yield compared with gasification temperature. At lower CO 2 /Biomass ratios (below 0. 25), <b>gasification</b> system <b>efficiency</b> (GSE) for both conventional and CO 2 -enhanced gasification was below 22. 1 %, and CO 2 -enhanced gasification showed a lower GSE than conventional gasification. However at higher CO 2 /Biomass ratios, CO 2 -enhanced gasification demonstrated higher GSE than conventional gasification. For CO 2 -enhanced gasification, GSE continued to increase to 58. 8 % when CO 2 /Biomass was raised to 0. 87. In addition, it was found that syngas exergy increases with CO 2 addition, which was mainly due to the increase in physical exergy. Chemical exergy was 2. 05 to 4. 85 times higher than physical exergy. The maximum exergy efficiency occurred within the temperature range of 800 oC to 900 oC because syngas exergy peaked in this range. For CO 2 -enhanced <b>gasification,</b> exergy <b>efficiency</b> was found to be more sensitive to temperature than CO 2 /Biomass ratios. In addition, the preliminary environmental analysis showed that CO 2 -enhanced gasification resulted in significant environmental benefits compared with stream gasification.

Gasification of walnut shell as the main hard nutshell produced in Kurdistan Province of Iran was investigated using a stainless steel batch micro-reactor. Effects of reaction time {{in the range of}} 10 – 30  min, feed loading in the range of 0.06 – 0.18  g, and temperature in the range of 400 – 440  °C were investigated to determine the condition for maximum hydrogen yield. Furthermore, carbon <b>gasification</b> <b>efficiency</b> (CGE) and hydrogen <b>gasification</b> <b>efficiency</b> (HGE) were calculated according to the elemental analysis and the yields of gaseous products. Total gas yield and hydrogen yield were directly correlated with temperature. Steam reforming of walnut shell was favored at higher temperatures. Also, walnut shell loading was inversely correlated with total gas and hydrogen yields while production of methane was favored by higher loading of walnut shell. Furthermore, hydrogen yield increased first, when reaction time increased from 10 to 20  min, and then decreased. Maximum hydrogen yield of 4.63  mmol/g of walnut shell was obtained at 440  °C, walnut shell loading of 0.06  g and reaction time of 20  min.|$|E
40|$|AbstractSolar {{receiver}} reactor is the {{key component}} of supercritical water gasification of biomass using concentrating solar energy, and itsthermal performance directly affects the thermal efficiency and biomass gasification results. The temperature distributions of solar receiver reactor and reactant fluid are presented. The results showed that direct normal solar irradiation (DNI) have prominent effect on the temperature of cavity type solar receiver reactor, thus affecting the SCWG reaction behaviors and gasification results. A series of on-sun experiments were carried out,temperature is relatively stable withDNI small fluctuations, and the nominal fluid temperatures at the outlet of reactor varied in the range 500 – 650 oC, which could completely meet the need of the temperature for biomass gasification in supercritical water. Model compounds of biomass (ethylene glycol, ethanol,glycerin and glucose) were continuously gasified under SCW conditions to generate hydrogen-rich fuel gas in the apparatus. Gas yields, carbon <b>gasification</b> <b>efficiency</b> and the total <b>gasification</b> <b>efficiency</b> increase with increasing DNI.

"May 2013 "[ACCESS RESTRICTED TO THE UNIVERSITY OF MISSOURI AT AUTHOR'S REQUEST. ] A batch reactor was built in the University of Missouri Carbon Recycling Center to explore the thermo-chemical conversion of motor oil as a model compound, in supercritical water. Used motor oil was identified as a main waste compound leading to increased land fill concerns and supercritical water gasification is introduced as a method of decomposing such waste residues with high efficiencies. This study focused on supercritical water gasification of motor oil using a batch reactor operated between 750 °C - 800 °C. The specific goals were to determine the <b>gasification</b> <b>efficiencies,</b> to compare the effect of emulsification of motor oil on the efficiencies, and to model the gasification reaction. The gas product was analyzed by gas chromatography and a 22 full factorial was performed to identify the effects of the process variables on each component of the gaseous product. The three process variables explored in this investigation are emulsification of motor oil with water, residence time and, inlet MO concentration. Finally, the Arrhenius equation was used to model the reaction. The model parameters estimated were the pre-exponential factor (2 · 104 (g/ml) 0. 15 /s), activation energy (94 kJ/mol) and the reaction order (0. 85) ...|$|R
