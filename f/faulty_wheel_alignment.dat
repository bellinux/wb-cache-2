40|$|This {{thesis is}} a {{proposal}} of a mobile <b>wheel</b> <b>alignment</b> system for passenger cars. Firstly, basic {{requirements for the}} manageability of a vehicle, {{as well as the}} most important parameters needed for the proper understanding of <b>wheel</b> <b>alignment</b> are explained. Further on, the text is focused on the construction, functioning and main principles of <b>wheel</b> <b>alignment</b> systems used for checking of the <b>wheel</b> <b>alignment</b> of both passenger cars, as well as race cars. Main differences will be explained. The second part is an analysis of a proposal of a <b>wheel</b> <b>alignment</b> system. Four different solutions are presented, all of them having undergone an analysis of their traction, as well as deformation. Each solution is supplemented with a calculation of price and used materials. Finally, all parts of a system are described in detail...|$|R

50|$|The WIPD ™ device {{can capture}} and {{calculate}} the absolute {{position of the}} <b>faulty</b> <b>wheel</b> in real time at speeds up to 500 km/h and can calculate the relative position to the sensors within millimeters. This relative position {{can be used to}} visually indicate the <b>faulty</b> <b>wheel</b> in a high-speed strobe triggered image, video or audio track tagging for post analysis - this might includes thermal image markers for hot bearings. It is then possible to fully automate the process of identifying the rail car, wheel position and provide a wheel impulse signature, using optical or digital trace markers, for post analysis in a central or remote database repository. Automated image character recognition can be used to fully automate the identification process of faulty rail cars.|$|R

40|$|Abstract—A {{fault-tolerant}} (FT) control {{approach for}} four-wheel independently-driven (4 WID) electric vehicles is presented. An adaptive control based passive fault-tolerant controller {{is designed to}} ensure the system stability when an in-wheel motor/motor driver fault happens. As an over-actuated system, {{it is challenging to}} isolate the <b>faulty</b> <b>wheel</b> and accurately estimate the control gain of the faulty in-wheel motor for 4 WID electric vehicles. An active fault diagnosis approach is thus proposed to isolate and evaluate the fault. Based on the estimated control gain of the faulty in-wheel motor, the control efforts of all the four wheels are redistributed to relieve the torque demand on the <b>faulty</b> <b>wheel.</b> Simulations using a high-fidelity, CarSim, full-vehicle model show the effectiveness of the proposed in-wheel motor/motor driver fault diagnosis and fault-tolerant control approach.

40|$|Purpose. At present, {{the devastating}} impact of <b>faulty</b> <b>wheels</b> on rails {{on the move}} {{is a major problem}} of railway transport. This factor {{is one of the most}} important, which causes the shift from {{traditional}} manual methods of verification and external examination to the automated diagnostic system of rolling stock in operation. Methodology. To achieve this goal the main types of wheel damages and the way they appear are analyzed. The methods for defects and abnormalities of the wheel thread determining as well as their advantages and disadvantages were presented. Nowadays these methods are under usage in both the international practice and in the one of the CIS countries. Findings. The <b>faulty</b> <b>wheel</b> sound on the move was researched and analyzed. The necessity of using the automated system, enabling one to reduce significantly the human factor is substantiated. Originality. The method to determine the wheel thread damage on the basis of a sound diagnostic is proposed. Practical value. Automatic tracking system of the wheels condition allows performing their more qualitative diagnostics, detecting a fault at the early stage and forecasting the rate of its extension. Besides detecting the location of the <b>faulty</b> <b>wheel</b> in the rolling stock, it is also possible to trace the dynamics of the fault extension and to give the recommendations on how to eliminate it...|$|R
