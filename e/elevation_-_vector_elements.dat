40|$|Representations of {{concepts}} from multivariate statistics are studied using multilinear algebra. Applications {{are given to}} the analysis of seasonal multivariate time series. The first paper concerns a class of permutation matrices which are representations of permutation operators on tensor spaces. In the second paper, the derivation of moments and cumulants of Hilbert space valued random variables are studied. Relations between moments and cumulants <b>-</b> as <b>vector</b> space <b>elements</b> <b>-</b> are given which generalize well-known results for scalar random variables. Representations of differentials are discussed and results for differentials of matrix valued functions with matrix arguments are derived. Moments and cumulants of the non-central Wishart distribution are given. in the third paper, seasonal multivariate time series are investigated using the concepts described in the first two papers. Estimators of unknown parameters are given and their asymptotic distributions are derived. Test statistics for testing homogeneity in time and independence of subprocesses are given and also their asymptotic distributions...|$|R

40|$|The {{discrete}} multiwavelet transform (DMWT) {{enables a}} signal to be analyzed in a multiresolution and multidimensional way. While the generated multiwavelet coefficients are vectors in nature, it has been generally understood that correlation exists between the <b>vector</b> <b>elements.</b> This feature has been adopted particularly in image coding applications to allow efficient design of VQ codebook. For a multiresolution analysis, the multiwavelet coefficients are generated from the multiscaling coefficients of the upper level. In this paper, we show that many multiwavelet systems cannot give correlated multiscaling <b>vector</b> <b>elements,</b> as different from the multiwavelet <b>vector</b> <b>elements.</b> But for those that can give correlated multiscaling <b>vector</b> <b>elements,</b> they can provide much information to assist in identifying the "blank" regions in a noisy signal. A new denoising algorithm is then proposed based on this feature and is particularly useful for sparse source signals.

40|$|For the {{conducting}} body {{coated with}} thin-layer material, plenty of fine meshes are required in general. In this paper, shell <b>vector</b> <b>element</b> (SVE) {{is used for}} modeling of thin coating dielectric. Further, a domain decomposition (DD) method for hybrid shell <b>vector</b> <b>element</b> method boundary integral (SVE-BI) is proposed for analysis of electromagnetic problem of multiple three-dimensional thin-coating objects. By this method, the whole computational domains are divided into sub-SVE domains and boundary element domains. With shell element, not only the unknowns are {{far less than the}} one by traditional <b>vector</b> <b>element</b> method, but only surface integral is required. The DDM framework used for hybrid SVE-BI also enhances the computational efficiency of solving scattering from multiple coating objects greatly. Finally, several numerical examples are presented to prove the accuracy and efficiency of this DDM-SVE-BI method...|$|R
