This was made clear when, First Minister Alex Salmond said there was 'no chance' of any new nuclear power stations being built in Scotland. The Government's stance has been backed by the Scottish Parliament that voted 63–58 to support the Scottish Government's policy of opposing new nuclear power stations.|$|E
500|$|Heavily {{influenced}} by Rousseau's frank and revealing Confessions (1782), Wollstonecraft lays bare her soul in Letters Written in Sweden, Norway, and Denmark, detailing {{not only her}} physical but also her psychological journey. Her personal disclosures, like those of other female autobiographers, are presented as [...] "unpremeditated self-revelations" [...] and often appear to be [...] "circuitous". However, as Wollstonecraft scholar Mitzi Myers <b>has</b> <b>made</b> <b>clear,</b> Wollstonecraft manages to use this style of writing to articulate a stable and comprehensible self for the reader. Increasingly confident in her ability as a writer, she controls the narrative {{and its effect on}} readers to a degree not matched in her other works. She transforms the individual sorrows of her trip, such as the dissolution of her relationship with Imlay, into the stuff of gripping literature.|$|E

500|$|Ceremonies {{were once}} {{considered}} to be secret, and consequently, the OA has been viewed {{by some as a}} secret society. With the introduction of Youth Protection program guidelines in 1980s, the BSA <b>has</b> <b>made</b> <b>clear</b> that any concerned parent, guardian, or religious leader may view a video of the ceremonies, attend meetings, or read ceremonial texts upon request to a council, district, lodge, or chapter official to assure themselves that there is nothing objectionable. [...] Such persons are asked to safeguard the details relating to ceremonies {{for the sake of the}} participants. The intent of the provision for parents and religious leaders to be allowed access to ceremonies is to ensure that there is no religious conflict or violations of youth protection guidelines occurring. Parents have long been discouraged in many Lodges from seizing the opportunity to use the provision for photo opportunities with their sons, and some lodges have instituted bans on photography during the ceremonies. Hazing or demeaning initiation pranks are also prohibited by the OA and the BSA.|$|E

2500|$|On August 29, 2006 Sec. Donald Rumsfeld said “Over {{the next}} decades , a {{sentiment}} took root that contended that {{if only the}} growing threats that had begun to emerge in Europe and Asia could be accommodated, then the carnage {{and the destruction of}} then-recent memory of World War I could be avoided. It was a time when a certain amount of cynicism and moral confusion set in among Western democracies. When those who warned about a coming crisis, the rise of fascism and nazism, they were ridiculed or ignored. Indeed, in the decades before World War II, a great many argued that the fascist threat was exaggerated or that it was someone else's problem. Some nations tried to negotiate a separate peace, even as the enemy made its deadly ambitions crystal clear. It was, as Winston Churchill observed, a bit like feeding a crocodile, hoping it would eat you last. ...I recount that history because once again we face similar challenges in efforts to confront the rising threat of a new type of fascism. Today -- another enemy, a different kind of enemy -- <b>has</b> <b>made</b> <b>clear</b> its intentions with attacks in places like New York and Washington, D.C., Bali, London, Madrid, Moscow and so many other places.
