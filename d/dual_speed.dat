The taillights were horizontally placed in the vertical deck cove. A unique cast grille was used at the front. Bright wheelhouse and lower body moldings, with ribbed rear fender panels were used. Red-filled Electra 225 badges {{were found on the}} rear fenders, while four VentiPorts lent status to the front fenders. Interiors were cloth and vinyl combinations, while a Custom interior in vinyl and leather, with front bucket seats and a storage console, was available for the convertible and sport coupe. Standard equipment included directional signals, full-flow oil filter, <b>dual</b> <b>speed</b> electric windshield wiper/washers, Deluxe steering wheel, cigar lighter, Step-On parking brake, dual armrests, Turbine-Drive automatic transmission, padded dashboard, heater, defroster, glovebox light, back-up lights, power steering, Glare-proof rearview mirror, power brakes, parking brake signal light, safety buzzer, courtesy lights, two-way power seats, power windows, Super Deluxe wheelcovers, Safety option group, custom padded cushions, Accessory Group options and custom moldings. Buick dropped the Riviera name as a body style designation after the 1963 model year, shifting the Riviera name exclusively to Buick's new personal luxury coupe that had been introduced in 1963. Buick added a 7-way tilt steering wheel and a new cruise control as an option.|$|E

Electra 225 rear fenders had a group of vertical hashmarks, with Electra 225 spelled out in block letters just above. A full length bright strip crowned the upper [...] body ridge, while the tower rocker molding and wheelhouses were accented with bright trim. Wheelcovers had a gold accent ring.

40|$|The {{impact of}} dual tasks on gait in Parkinson's disease (PD) reveals lack of {{automaticity}} and increased cognitive demands. We explored which characteristics explained walking speed {{with and without}} dual task interference and if they reflected the cognitive demands of the task. In 130 people with PD, gait performance was quantified in the home using accelerometers allowing estimates of single and <b>dual</b> task walking <b>speed</b> and interference (difference between dual and single task). Multiple regression {{analysis was used to}} explore the effect of 12 characteristics representing four domains (personal, motor symptoms, cognitive, affective) on gait outcomes. Thirty-seven percent of variance in single task speed was explained by increased fear of falling, sex, age, disease severity, and depression; 34 % of variance in <b>dual</b> task <b>speed</b> was explained by increased fear of falling, disease severity, medication, and depression; 12 % of variance in interference scores was explained by greater disease severity and impaired executive function. Personal, motor, affective, and cognitive characteristics contribute to walking speed and interference, highlighting the multifactorial nature of gait. Different patterns of characteristics for each outcome indicates the impact of cognitive demand and task complexity, providing cautious support for <b>dual</b> task <b>speed</b> and interference as valid proxy measures of cognitive demand in PD gait. © 2008 Movement Disorder Society...|$|R

40|$|Objective It is {{commonly}} known that gait disturbance is related with Alzheimer's disease (AD) in its late stage. However, recent {{studies showed that}} gait disturbance may start in the early stage of AD or even mild cognitive impairment (MCI). This paper aims to explore the correlation of gait speed and Timed Up & Go (TUG) with AD and MCI.   Methods All subjects were examined by Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA). Besides, {{they were designed to}} walk in two assigned conditions: single task (free gait) and dual task (walking and counting). The gait parameters of Four-Meter Walk Test (4 mWT) and TUG were measured in the two conditions.   Results Forty-two patients with AD, 39 with MCI and 39 control subjects were enrolled in this study. Compared with control group, both single and <b>dual</b> gait <b>speed</b> of MCI and AD groups decreased (MCI single:  t = - 3. 223, P = 0. 002; MCI dual:  t = - 2. 476,  P = 0. 016; AD single: t = - 3. 793,  P = 0. 003; AD dual:  t = - 12. 708,  P = 0. 000). For TUG, compared with control group, both single and dual tasks of MCI and AD groups increased (MCI single:  t = 2. 831,  P = 0. 006; MCI dual:  t = 4. 060,  P = 0. 000; AD single:  t = 3. 420,  P = 0. 001; AD dual:  t = 4. 259,  P = 0. 000). As for the comparison between MCI and AD groups, <b>dual</b> gait <b>speed</b> of AD group decreased (t = - 8. 254, P = 0. 000), but there was no significant increase of both single and dual TUG in AD group (single:  t = 1. 569,  P = 0. 121; dual:  t = 1. 904, P = 0. 061). Compared with single task, no significant difference existed in <b>dual</b> gait <b>speed</b> of MCI group (t = - 1. 934,  P = 0. 057), while dual TUG of MCI group increased (t = 3. 693, P = 0. 000); <b>dual</b> gait <b>speed</b> of AD group decreased (t = - 12. 333, P = 0. 000), while dual TUG increased significantly (t = 2. 584, P = 0. 012).   Conclusions Gait disturbance can be found even in early stage of dementia, so gait speed and TUG are reliable parameters for identification of AD, even MCI. Dual TUG increasing is meaningful for both AD and MCI, while <b>dual</b> gait <b>speed</b> shows its great significance in AD.   DOI: 10. 3969 /j. issn. 1672 - 6731. 2015. 07. 011 </p...|$|R

50|$|A <b>dual</b> <b>speed</b> focuser {{can provide}} two {{focusing}} speeds {{by using a}} set of co-axial knobs, one for fast focusing and another for fine focusing when the film or CCD is near the perfect focal plane.
