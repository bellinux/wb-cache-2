2500|$|The LeSabre was facelifted for 1997, {{moving the}} turn signal {{indicators}} {{to the front}} bumper instead of the <b>headlamp</b> <b>assembly.</b> A new gauge cluster with a tachometer appeared. Interestingly, the front fenders switched from the composite material to a more conventional galvanized steel substrate. Other minor changes also took effect, including a different grille, different rear backup lights and different trim. [...] The overall effect of these changes was that the 1997-99 models looked a little slimmer than their predecessors. [...] Despite the redesign of the exterior, one automotive magazine article around 1996-97 said the interior was [...] "1970-something" [...] meaning it was rather old-fashioned for a car from the mid-late 1990s.|$|E
2500|$|The biggest {{difference}} between the so-called [...] "XR series" [...] performance versions and standard models were the engines; the XR6 and XR8 boasted a [...] six-cylinder and a [...] V8 respectively. The V8 was later upgraded to output 185kilowatts (248hp) in October 1997. The upgraded transmission and exhaust system were unique to the XR range, as was the exterior styling with an XR exclusive quad <b>headlamp</b> <b>assembly</b> giving the vehicle {{a higher degree of}} aggression when compared to the look possessed by the other variants. Both models came standard with limited slip differential and specially tuned suspension. Body kits were also installed to improve the aesthetics and the aerodynamics. The first series of 824 XR8 models had the [...] engine and 3.23:1 diff ratio with 15 inch alloy wheels. The second and last of the series numbered 784 examples and was equipped with a [...] engine, shorter 3.45:1 diff ratio, 16 inch alloy wheels, big bore exhaust headers and the late model Explorer inlet manifold as standard.|$|E
50|$|Then {{there is}} the racing-styled 125R, full faired with a split twin <b>headlamp</b> <b>assembly.</b> Seat height: 800 mm. Wheelbase: 1349.6 mm.|$|E
5000|$|After the {{bankruptcy}} of Venture Corporation, new investors approached Carroll Shelby with {{plans to build a}} Series II (a.k.a.: [...] "Series 2"). The design was much like the Series I, but with restyled bumpers, <b>headlamp</b> <b>assemblies,</b> improved powertrain, more horsepower and other refinements. Three prototype Series IIâ€™s were built for introduction at the 2006 Concorso Italiano in Monterey, CA. They were introduced at a price of $225,000 for the production models. Orders with deposits were placed for a limited production run. All but a few production slots sold out in a relatively short time.|$|R
50|$|ZAZ-1103 Slavuta was a 5-door B-class {{liftback}} {{released in}} 1995 and discontinued in 2011. It featured a fuel injection engine of 1,2-1,3 liters. Due {{to the use}} of a liftback type body with an elongated roof line and rounded contours of hood and trunk lid, the movement of turn indicators onto the <b>headlamp</b> <b>assemblies</b> (increased rounding radius from 20 to 50 mm) and the removal of rain gutters from above the doors, not only was a completely new shape of created, but also the aerodynamics were improved, the luggage compartment volume increased, the loading height lowered (by 60 cm), and the dirtying of the rear glass in rainy weather was decreased. When ZAZ started the production of Chevrolet Lanos, some design elements of Chevrolet Lanos (such as seat and door parts) were added to Slavuta.|$|R
25|$|Headlamp systems require {{periodic}} maintenance. Sealed beam headlamps are modular; {{when the}} filament burns out, the entire sealed beam is replaced. Most vehicles in North America made {{since the late}} 1980s use <b>headlamp</b> lens-reflector <b>assemblies</b> that are considered {{a part of the}} car, and just the bulb is replaced when it fails. Manufacturers vary the means by which the bulb is accessed and replaced. Headlamp aim must be properly checked and adjusted frequently, for misaimed lamps are dangerous and ineffective.|$|R
50|$|Exterior {{changes on}} the Hardtop version {{includes}} a slanted nose which requires a new grille, a thinner <b>headlamp</b> <b>assembly</b> that match the slanted nose, frameless door windows, thinner tail lamp, front fenders and bumper. Body panel is stamped different from the standard version.|$|E
5000|$|The second {{generation}} Pulsars featured Bajaj Auto's newly developed DTSi technology, which increased the power rating of both versions by [...] each and also increased fuel economy. This model also {{introduce a new}} <b>headlamp</b> <b>assembly,</b> 1,320 mm wheelbase, and standard twin-tone horn and trip meter.|$|E
50|$|The <b>headlamp</b> <b>assembly</b> for 1996-1998 Quests {{will fit}} into 1993-1995 Quests. The only {{modification}} required {{is to the}} switch the low-beam (center pin) and ground pins on the light bulb socket. The newer assembly also uses the brighter 9007 bulb with ~1000 lumens vs ~700 of the 9004 bulb.|$|E
50|$|Although {{mechanically}} the new TL and KL series {{remained the}} same as the preceding TJ, stylistically, it had been radically facelifted by French designer Olivier Boulay. Gone were the somewhat angular lines featured since the first TE series, which were instead replaced by what Mitsubishi's new global head of design envisioned as the new Mitsubishi corporate face (a style that would eventually be grafted onto other Mitsubishi vehicles, beginning with the Lancer Evolution and Colt/Mirage). The frontal appearance of the TL/KL series had a distinctive grille, which was again divided in the middle like on the TJ series, but this time by an extension of the bumper bar and not the bonnet. Larger chrome Mitsubishi triple diamonds logo adorned the front bumper, whereas the front guards now had a swoopy appearance with triangular <b>headlamp</b> <b>assemblies.</b> On its sides, new design, colour-coded plastic door handles, rocker panels and skirts were introduced. At the rear, a rounded boot lid and bumper bar were fitted to continue the swoopy front theme, but the rear tail lights remained effectively unchanged from those of the TJ series (except for VR-X and Verada Xi AWD which featured darkened lenses). The new car's styling was controversial and not well received by Australian buyers; sales slowed dramatically.|$|R
5000|$|Night View Assist Plus. Besides {{the twin}} {{infrared}} projectors in the headlamps, an additional (long-range) infrared sensor {{has now been}} integrated into the radiator grille. For the first time, the new Night View Assist Plus is capable of detecting not just pedestrians in potentially hazardous positions {{in front of the}} vehicle, but animals too. This third-generation night vision system automatically switches the instrument cluster display from the speedometer to a crystal-sharp night view image to alert the driver in unlit areas. Pedestrians or animals detected ahead are highlighted in colour in this image. The spotlight function is additionally used to repeatedly flash pedestrians in the warning zone by means of a special module in the front headlamps. This attracts the driver's attention to the source of the danger {{at the same time as}} warning the person on the side of the road. The pedestrian detection function is now also available in urban areas with the night view image has been activated by the driver. An additional (far) infrared sensor in the radiator grille supplements the proven Mercedes-Benz night vision technology. It is able to detect pedestrians at a distance of up to 160 metres, and animals such as deer, horses and cattle at up to 100 metres. Two separate light sources in the <b>headlamp</b> <b>assemblies</b> light up the area in front of the vehicle with invisible infrared light.|$|R
50|$|The first Viewt, {{introduced}} in January 1993, was produced {{on the basis}} of the K11 March. The March's hatchback was replaced by a fixed rear window and rounded boot, and the front grille and <b>headlamp</b> <b>assembly</b> was replaced by one closely resembling that of the Jaguar Mark II. In standard form the interior was much the same as the March's, but leather seats and wood trim could be added at extra cost.|$|E

5000|$|... 2005 (for the 2006 model year) {{marked the}} fourth generation's {{mid-cycle}} refresh. The changes included revised {{front and rear}} bumpers; a reworked grille; new projector-beam headlamps and LED tail lamps; additional chrome trim on the SR5 model; and a smoked-chrome grille with tubular roof-rack and step bars on the Sport Edition. The revised front bumper features circular fog lights and a relocation of the turn-signals to the <b>headlamp</b> <b>assembly.</b> The redesigned bumper eliminates the rear bumper reflectors. MP3 playback capability and an auxiliary input jack were added to all audio systems. In addition, the Limited model was further differentiated from the other trim levels {{with the addition of}} unique 18" [...] wheels and a seat memory system. Shadow Mica was added as a color option.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a comprehensive dimensional validation methodology, known as datum transformation analysis (DTA). The DTA approach utilizes 3 D non-contact (3 DNC) measurement {{to obtain a}} full part dimensional representation at all critical matching interfaces of a part assembly to the vehicle. Next, a part measurement re-alignment process is applied to identify new positions for the assembly datum locators that optimize the overall product quality at these matching interfaces. Next, datum locations are adjusted at the component level (at the same physical location as the corresponding assembly) to improve mean conformance of the assembly dimensions. The adjustments to the datum locators at the component level are not necessarily made to improve component quality, but rather to optimize final part assembly. This DTA methodology is demonstrated using an automotive <b>headlamp</b> <b>assembly.</b> In this case study, we identify tooling rework moves using DTA to increase the percent of critical assembly dimensions whose mean values are within Â± 0. 25 millimeters from 20 % to 90 %...|$|E
