50|$|The {{clinical}} sciences segment (years 3 and 4) builds upon concepts studied <b>earlier</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>program.</b> It prepares students to diagnose {{a range of}} primary care conditions and to effectively help patients treat and/or manage their conditions, while promoting disease prevention. Laboratory and clinical demonstrations are used to help develop practical skills. A range of primary care issues are covered in several specialized courses that include, fundamentals of primary care; integrated therapeutics; in-office procedures (e.g. blood draws, injections, minor surgery); maternal and newborn care (obstetrics); pediatrics; men's and women's health (urology, gynecology); emergency medicine; and diagnostic imaging (e.g. radiology).

5000|$|When Ross finished, {{she made}} a brief speech about 'the night that {{everyone}} came back' (although some of the surviving artists and musicians had not been invited). After the beginning chords of [...] "Someday We'll Be Together", Birdsong entered from stage left, and Wilson entered from stage right. Shortly after the first verse, Wilson took over the lead vocals. A few moments later, Motown labelmates such as Smokey Robinson, Stevie Wonder, and others quickly filled the stage for an impromptu finale. Although producer Suzanne de Passe had instructed Diana to introduce Berry Gordy after leading the finale (a fact unknown to Mary), Wilson decided to do the honors by calling Berry down herself. Additionally, <b>earlier</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>program,</b> Wilson made a brief tribute to Ballard, and former label mate Paul Williams of the Temptations. By the time the reunion aired on May 16, Ross/Wilson altercations were widely reported, including an article and pictures in Us Magazine, and the performance resulted in negative publicity for the group.|$|E
