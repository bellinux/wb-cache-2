5|$|Buckles did {{not meet}} the {{criteria}} for burial at Arlington National Cemetery as he had never been in combat, but friends and family secured special permission from the federal government in 2008. That was accomplished with the help of Ross Perot, who <b>had</b> <b>met</b> <b>him</b> at a history seminar in 2001, and who intervened in 2008 with the White House regarding a final resting place.|$|E
5|$|AjTut {{was one of}} {{the lords}} of the {{northern}} Chak'an Itza province of the conquered Itza kingdom; friar Avendaño <b>had</b> <b>met</b> <b>him</b> during his expedition to Nojpetén. After the conquest he relocated from the north shore of Lake Petén Itzá to Mompana, a region lying between Lake Yaxha and the Classic period ruins of Tikal. For some years after the conquest he established the Mompana region as a refuge from the Spanish and engaged in internecine war against the surviving Kowoj to the south.|$|E
5|$|There are {{numerous}} contemporary, or near-contemporary, {{sources of information}} about the reign of Richard III. These include the Croyland Chronicle, Commines' Mémoires, the report of Dominic Mancini, the Paston Letters, the Chronicles of Robert Fabyan and numerous court and official records, including a few letters by Richard himself. However, the debate about Richard's true character and motives continues, both because of the subjectivity of many of the written sources, reflecting the generally partisan nature of writers of this period, and {{because of the fact that}} none was written by men with an intimate knowledge of Richard, even if they <b>had</b> <b>met</b> <b>him</b> in person.|$|E

25|$|McGreevey {{was criticized}} for {{appointing}} as homeland security adviser Golan Cipel, because he lacked experience or other qualifications for the position. In addition, Cipel could not gain a security approval from the Federal government, as he was Israeli and not a U.S. citizen. McGreevey <b>had</b> <b>met</b> <b>him</b> in Israel during a trip there in 2000.|$|E

25|$|Gleeson {{was the top}} Australian wicket taker in the 1970–71 Ashes series, but his 14 wickets cost 43.21 as {{his quest}} for variety {{resulted}} in loose balls and he was punished by the English batsmen who <b>had</b> <b>met</b> <b>him</b> in 1968. Despite being able to use their legs without danger, batsmen were still unable to overcome him during the 1971–72 domestic season when he took 45 wickets at 16.31 in eight matches, including 19 wickets in two consecutive matches. Gleeson was recalled for the 1972 Ashes tour, but was dropped after the first three Tests, in which he managed only three wickets at 52.33. He had minor skills with the bat, with one first class half century and a Test top score of 45.|$|E
25|$|He {{travelled}} {{past the}} Port Arthur historic site toward a Palmer's Lookout Road property {{owned by the}} Martins, where he came across Roger Larner driving out of his driveway. Larner <b>had</b> <b>met</b> <b>him</b> on some occasions more than 15 years before, but did not initially recognise him. Bryant told Larner he had been surfing and had bought a property called Fogg Lodge and was now looking to buy some cattle from Larner. Bryant also made several comments about buying the Martins' place next door. He asked if Marian Larner was home, {{and asked if he}} could continue down the driveway of the farm to see her. Larner said OK, but told Bryant he would come also. Bryant changed his mind and left, claiming he was going to return in the afternoon.|$|E

500|$|In 1964, Valiente was {{introduced}} to the Pagan witch Robert Cochrane by a mutual friend, the ceremonial magician William G. Gray, who <b>had</b> <b>met</b> <b>him</b> at a gathering at Glastonbury Tor held by the Brotherhood of the Essenes. Although sceptical of Cochrane's claims to have come from a hereditary family of witches, she was impressed by his charisma, his desire to avoid publicity, and his emphasis on working outdoors. Valiente was invited to join Cochrane's coven, the Clan of Tubal Cain, becoming its sixth member.|$|E
500|$|At the 2014 MTV Video Music Awards, Jimmy Fallon {{announced}} that Cyrus {{was the winner}} of the Video of the Year award for her song [...] "Wrecking Ball".

She <b>had</b> <b>met</b> <b>him</b> at My Friend’s Place, an organization that helps homeless youth find shelter, work, health care and education. His acceptance speech encouraged musicians to learn more about homeless youth in Los Angeles and what they can do to help at Cyrus's Facebook page. Cyrus then launched a Prizeo campaign to raise funds for the charity. Those who made donations were automatically entered into a sweepstake for a chance to meet Cyrus on her Bangerz Tour in Rio de Janeiro that September.|$|E
500|$|Fodor (who {{is now a}} close friend) is {{a gentle}} man inside a burly body, and prone to an even burlier style of arguing. He is shy and voluble {{at the same time}} ... a {{formidable}} polemicist burdened with a sensitive soul.... Disagreeing with Jerry on a philosophical issue, especially one dear to his heart can be a chastening experience.... His quickness of mind, inventiveness, and sharp wit are not to be tangled with before your first cup of coffee in the morning. Adding Jerry Fodor to the faculty at Rutgers [...] instantly put it on the map, Fodor being by common consent the leading philosopher of mind in the world today. I <b>had</b> <b>met</b> <b>him</b> in England in the seventies and ... found him to be the genuine article, intellectually speaking (though we do not always see eye to eye).|$|E

2500|$|When the {{powerful}} Edmund of Woodstock, 1st Earl of Kent {{was arrested in}} March 1330 and charged with conspiring to restore Edward II, whom he had been deluded into believing was still alive, he alleged at his trial that Beaumont <b>had</b> <b>met</b> <b>him</b> in Paris {{and told him that}} his plot would be supported from Scotland by the armed intervention of Donald Earl of Mar, a personal friend of the ex-king. [...] Kent was executed and Beaumont would never be allowed to return to England while Mortimer and Isabella held on to power.|$|E
2500|$|Although {{the peace}} {{negotiations}} were an embarrassing reverse for Britain, they brought Wood further political and royal favour. The Queen thought highly of him (and Buller). Wood's third daughter, born in 1881, was named [...] "Victoria Eugenie" [...] at the Queen’s wish. Wood had already impressed Lord Beaconsfield (Prime Minister at the time), who <b>had</b> <b>met</b> <b>him</b> at the Queen’s suggestion after the Zulu War, and now impressed Gladstone, the current Prime Minister. He was promoted in permanent rank from lieutenant-colonel (unemployed) and brevet colonel to major-general (30 November 1881) and {{was awarded a}} Knight Grand Cross of the Order of St Michael and St George (GCMG) on 17 February 1882.

2500|$|John Taylor (b. , Leeds, West Yorkshire) was {{a parcel}} {{delivery}} worker for Parcelforce, and {{lived on the}} same housing estate as Tiernan, {{within a mile of}} where she was last seen alive. He was known locally as [...] "the pet man", as he kept a number of dogs and ferrets and sold pet food, and was also known to be a poacher. His only previous conviction was for theft of a suit when he was 15 years old and he was considered by his neighbours to be trustworthy and [...] "ordinary". Following their appeal for information, Taylor's name was given to the police separately by two former girlfriends of Taylor who <b>had</b> <b>met</b> <b>him</b> through lonely hearts columns, both saying that he had driven past the woods in their company and boasted of poaching there regularly.|$|E
2500|$|After {{remaining}} {{with the}} band for several rehearsals, Pomfret departed un-amicably. He {{was replaced by the}} bass player Dale Hibbert, who worked at Manchester's Decibel Studios, where Marr <b>had</b> <b>met</b> <b>him</b> while recording Freak Party's demo. It was through Hibbert that the Smiths were able to record their first demo at Decibel, doing so one night in August 1982. Aided by drummer Simon Wolstencroft, whom Marr had worked with in Freak Party, the band recorded both [...] "The Hand That Rocks the Cradle" [...] and [...] "Suffer Little Children". Wolstencroft was not interested in joining the band, and so auditions were held to find a permanent drummer which resulted in Mike Joyce joining them; he later revealed that he was under the influence of magic mushrooms during his audition performance. Meanwhile, Morrissey took the demo recording to Factory Records, but Factory's Tony Wilson wasn't interested.|$|E

More than 40 years later, the woman said that her [...] "legs gave way" [...] when she recognised a magazine picture of a young Tobin and came forward after an [...] appeal by the Crimewatch television programme in December 2009. Another woman also came forward in 2010 who claimed to have had a threatening experience at the Barrowland Ballroom. She said that Tobin introduced himself as Peter and pestered her to go with him to a party in the city's Castlemilk area. When she recently saw pictures of a young Tobin, she said: [...] "It was the man who came up to me so many years ago in Barrowlands. I am 100 per cent certain Tobin is Bible John." ...|$|E
