5|$|In England, Legal Deposit can {{be traced}} back to at least 1610. The Copyright Act 1911 {{established}} the principle of the legal deposit, ensuring that the British Library and five other libraries in Great Britain and Ireland are entitled to receive a free copy of <b>every</b> <b>item</b> published or distributed in Britain. The other five libraries are: the Bodleian Library at Oxford; the University Library at Cambridge; the Trinity College Library at Dublin; and the National Libraries of Scotland and Wales. The British Library is the only one that must automatically receive a copy of <b>every</b> <b>item</b> published in Britain; the others are entitled to these items, but must specifically request them from the publisher after learning that they have been or are about to be published, a task done centrally by the Agency for the Legal Deposit Libraries.|$|E
5|$|The depot {{stored and}} {{dispatched}} <b>every</b> <b>item</b> that the RAF used in wartime, from knives and forks to aircraft engines. The site was {{served by a}} large, internal railway system which left the Manchester to Crewe mainline prior to Handforth railway station. The site of the exchange sidings and junction is {{at the rear of}} the Pets At Home offices on Epsom Avenue. The depot had its own shunting locomotives, which were stored in an engine shed that stood at the Wilmslow bound exit slip road for the Handforth Dean shopping centre.|$|E

Lambert, from his {{birth to the}} moment of his dissolution, with an account of men noted for their corpulency, and other interesting matter, the first full biography of Lambert to be released after his death. Lambert's position as the heaviest person in recorded history was soon overtaken by the American Mills Darden (1799–1857), but Lambert had by now become a cult figure, and virtually <b>every</b> <b>item</b> connected with him was preserved for posterity. His clothes and possessions were sold at auction to collectors, {{and many of them}} are preserved in museums today.|$|E

Over 7,000 items were catalogued on a specially designed database, the first computerised archive of the entire contents of a world ranking artist's studio. <b>Every</b> <b>item</b> in the studio has a database entry. Each entry consists of an image and a factual account of an object. The database has entries on approximately 570 books and catalogues, 1,500 photographs, 100 slashed canvases, 1,300 leaves torn from books, 2,000 artist's materials and 70 drawings. Other categories include the artist's correspondence, magazines, newspapers and vinyl records.|$|E
25|$|British {{military}} helicopters {{flew over}} the crash site, pointing out large pieces of wreckage to the search parties. Private helicopters, equipped with thermographic cameras, were drafted in to survey the heavily wooded areas surrounding Lockerbie. Within hours of the crash, photographs of the area taken by a French satellite were delivered to the investigators. High-resolution photographs from spy satellites were also provided by the United States Department of Defense and National Aeronautics and Space Administration. <b>Every</b> <b>item</b> picked up was tagged, placed in a clear plastic bag, labelled and taken to the gymnasium of a local school, where everything was X-rayed and checked for explosive residue with a gas chromatograph, after which the information was entered into the Home Office Large Major Enquiry System.|$|E
25|$|Before {{a battle}} begins, the player usually has {{the choice to}} retreat, giving them time to prepare. For every battle, the player may choose only three combatants out of a {{possible}} five, and a positioning scheme for them. The player can either choose the Attack or Magic formation. The Attack formation allows Attack based moves a shorter recharge time, and there will be two characters in the front row, and a single character in the back row. In Magic formation, Magic users have a shorter recharge time and positioning is reversed. Following that decision the player must choose the items to bring. Only sixteen items can be held at any time, and there are no methods of storage. The player may only bring four of those sixteen items into battle for all three characters to use. However, for <b>every</b> <b>item,</b> each character has a different attack; where, with a staff, Cierra might do great damage with a magical attack, Fia would heal an ally.|$|E

25|$|On January 18, 2012, {{the first}} content patch (1.1) was released, {{adding a new}} Flashpoint and adding four bosses to an {{existing}} Operation. Patch (1.2) was released on April 12, 2012. The update included the new Legacy system, a new Flashpoint, Operation, a PVP Warzone, as well as improved character textures and advanced options such as user interface customization. Guild banks and player character pets are also introduced. A Weekend Pass Free Trial was made available for new players but has since closed. Patch 1.3 was released in June 2012. The game update featured a New Group Finder, the ability to augment <b>every</b> <b>item,</b> and adaptable social gear. In addition, players {{will be able to}} request that their characters are able to transfer to other servers. Subsequent patches have introduced a 'Cartel Market' where players can purchase virtual currency to spend on cosmetic items in-game. These items include armour sets, lightsaber colour crystals, mounts, pets and character-perk unlocks.|$|E
500|$|The {{simplest}} DKP {{variation is}} one where <b>every</b> <b>item</b> has a set price list and each player earns some specified number of DKP each time they participate in a guild raid. [...] Like zero-sum systems, the player with the most points recorded actually received the item, paying the specified price. [...] Unlike zero-sum, a simple DKP system does not compensate {{the rest of the}} raid based {{in the value of the}} items received.|$|E
500|$|Gold DKP (GDKP) is {{a system}} {{developed}} for pick up groups (PUG). [...] This system was introduced to support individuals without a guild to support raids for difficult bosses/zones. [...] In GDKP, when a boss is killed, each item dropped is put up for auction with a low value. [...] Each item is then auctioned. [...] The eventual winner pays the loot master, and after <b>every</b> <b>item</b> has been auctioned off, every participant in the group is rewarded an equal share of gold. [...] For example, if 20 members were in the group, and 500 gold was spent on items, each raid participant would receive 25 gold.|$|E
2500|$|For a Type I {{functional}} response curve, {{the rate}} of prey capture increases linearly with food density. At low prey densities, the search time is long. Since the predator spends most of its time searching, it eats <b>every</b> prey <b>item</b> it finds. [...] As prey density increases, the predator is able to capture the prey faster and faster. [...] At a certain point, {{the rate of}} prey capture is so high, that the predator doesn't have to eat <b>every</b> prey <b>item</b> it encounters. [...] After this point, the predator should only choose the prey items with the highest E/h.|$|R

500|$|Schwa has {{received}} positive reviews from the Chicago Sun-Times, Chicago Tribune, Frommer's, and GQ, among others. [...] In 2006, Phil Vettel of the Chicago Tribune described the food as four-star quality, while giving the restaurant an overall rating of three stars (out of four) because of below-average service. Vettel added that nearly <b>every</b> <b>item</b> {{on the menu}} is [...] "wonderful". Vettel returned to Schwa after the 2008 relaunch and concluded [...] "Schwa {{is at least as}} good as it was in its early days, and probably better". [...] He credited Carlson's increased focus on the dining room for the improvement, and maintained Schwa's three-star rating.|$|E
500|$|The {{first round}} of {{nominations}} took place on Day 6 and resulted in Halfwit and Sophia facing the public vote. On Day 8, the first shopping task saw Kris negotiate {{his way through a}} field of laser beams to retrieve the [...] "Emerald of Hope", with one of his fellow housemates being soaked by a bursting balloon full of gunge whenever he interrupted a beam. He completed the task successfully, earning a luxury budget. However, as punishment for Marcus, Sophia and Sree discussing nominations, Big Brother doubled the price of <b>every</b> <b>item</b> on the shopping list. Later that day, Saffia left the House voluntarily to be with her children and Sophia was evicted with 91.2% of the public vote the following night.|$|E

Southern's debt rose, and the company almost entered bankruptcy in 1932. Harrison ordered the payment of dividends to be halted in 1932, and many employees took pay cuts. Further efforts included a thorough check of expenses, with <b>every</b> <b>item</b> subjected to scrutiny to see what could be eliminated.

40|$|International audienceWe {{describe}} a computing method of the computable (or constructive) real numbers based on analysis of expressions. This method take precision estimate {{into account in}} order to get a better algorithm than M´enissier-Morain's method, which is also based on the representation of constructive reals. We solve two problems which appear in exact real arithmetic based on the representation of constructive reals. First, by balancing <b>every</b> <b>item's</b> precision in the expression, we can avoid unnecessary precision growth. Second, by distributing different weights to different operations, we can make sure that complex operations do not waste much time when to compute the whole expression. In these ways, we finally get a more efficient and proper method than prior implementations...|$|R
50|$|The {{game has}} two {{different}} endings, {{depending on whether}} the player obtained all of the special items found in the nameless game. If the player obtains <b>every</b> single <b>item,</b> they will unlock the good ending; otherwise, they will receive the bad ending.|$|R

500|$|Once {{the game}} is completed, a new game plus mode is {{available}} called [...] "EX game". It {{is different from the}} normal game in various aspects; the player has access to <b>every</b> <b>item</b> stored in the police station, the game begins with the final weapon and armor the player chose before ending the first game but returns to level one experience, and the bonus points (BP) given to the player {{at the end of the}} game are now available to use. The items, weapons, power-ups and enemies are more powerful, as are the enemies the player encounters. However, the biggest difference from the normal game is the addition of the Chrysler Building, a brand new location with 77 floors (containing mostly randomized content), leading to a final boss battle with Aya's older sister, Maya.|$|E
500|$|Springfield Elementary School {{is hosting}} a fundraiser auction and invites all the {{families}} with children in their classes, including the Simpson family. <b>Every</b> <b>item</b> in the auction is sold to an English widow named Edith Knickertwist, who is bidding over the phone.

Frustrated over Bart's latest prank and pressured by his supervisor Superintendent Chalmers, Principal Skinner challenges Chalmers to take over Bart's education. Chalmers accepts and immediately gives Bart his own lesson plan, which primarily consists of former U.S. president Theodore Roosevelt. He makes Bart interested in the subject by talking about Roosevelt's heroic and rebellious nature. [...] Classmates Milhouse, Nelson, Jimbo, Kearney and Dolph soon join Bart in his education.|$|E

As the fortress prospers, migrants come in larger numbers from the mountainhome (the colony's home civilization) and will need further accommodation. Trading caravans, {{which can be}} from the various neighboring civilizations including the home civilization, visit the fortress on a yearly basis and are useful for getting supplies not available in the player's fortress area. The role of bookkeeper, manager and broker can be assigned to any dwarf during early game. The bookkeeper maintains records of <b>every</b> <b>item</b> present in the fort, the manager auto-assigns jobs and the broker deals with trading caravans. The production of crafts from any material are useful for trading. The caravans come from civilizations of elves and humans but depending on the embark region and history, they may be absent or sometimes even hostile.|$|E
