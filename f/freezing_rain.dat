5|$|January 4/5, 1879: At Jacksonville at 7 pm, sleet began, {{which turned}} to rain 90minutes later. The <b>freezing</b> <b>rain</b> covered trees, shrubbery, and {{everything}} else outdoors by morning. The weight of the ice broke the limbs of many orange trees. At Fernandina, snow occurred.|$|E
5|$|Intensity of {{precipitation}} is primarily measured for meteorological concerns. However, {{it can be}} of concern to aviation as heavy precipitation can limit visibility. Also, intensity of <b>freezing</b> <b>rain</b> can determine how hazardous it is for pilots to fly nearby certain locations since {{it can be an}} in-flight hazard by depositing ice on the wings of aircraft, which can be detrimental to flight.|$|E
5|$|December 23/24, 1989: Light rain in Jacksonville {{turns to}} <b>freezing</b> <b>rain</b> as {{temperatures}} drop, and later changes to snow.

5000|$|Hill {{lived on}} two 6 by 6 ft {{platforms}} for 738 days. Luna's trunk was her sidewalk and exercise treadmill. Hill learned many survival skills {{while living in}} Luna, such as [...] "seldom washing the soles of her feet, because the sap helped her feet stick to the branches better." [...] Hill used solar-powered cell phones for radio interviews, became an [...] "in-tree" [...] correspondent for a cable television show, and hosted TV crews to protest old-growth clear cutting. With ropes, Hill hoisted up survival supplies brought by an eight-member support crew. To keep warm, Hill wrapped herself tight in a sleeping bag, leaving only a small hole for breathing. For meals, Hill used a single-burner propane stove. Throughout her ordeal, Hill weathered <b>freezing</b> <b>rains</b> and 40 mi/h km/h winds from El Niño, helicopter harassment, a ten-day siege by company security guards, and attempted intimidation by angry loggers.|$|R
5|$|European {{settlers}} on the North American Prairies {{found that}} the sod least likely to deteriorate due to <b>freezing</b> or <b>rain</b> came from dried sloughs. Turf was once extensively used for the walls of houses in Ireland, Scotland and Iceland, where some turf houses may still be found. A turf house may last fifty years or longer if well-maintained in a cold climate.|$|R
5|$|It {{is common}} {{through much of}} its range, but in the northernmost areas it is rare, since it is {{vulnerable}} to hard winters, especially if its feeding is disrupted by an ice glaze on the trees or <b>freezing</b> <b>rain.</b> It is also uncommon in Turkey and the Caucasus. In the west of its range it has spread to the Outer Hebrides in Scotland, pushed further north in Norway, and first bred in the Netherlands in 1993.|$|E
5|$|As the {{secondary}} storm began to intensify offshore, precipitation rapidly expanded and tracked northward towards southern Virginia, eastern Maryland and Delaware, {{largely in the}} form of <b>freezing</b> <b>rain,</b> ice, and snow. From 0200 UTC on December 30 to 1200 UTC, the cyclone intensified by 13 mbar, and continued to deepen for several more hours. Snowfall reached southern New Jersey between 0600 and 0800 UTC, and New York City at around 1000 UTC. Thundersnow developed within heavy bands in some areas. The significant snow was characterized by a sharp western cutoff; for example, in Chester County, accumulations ranged from around 6inches in the far eastern parts of the county to only an inch along its western border with Lancaster County.|$|E
5|$|In Monroe County, {{state police}} closed Interstates 80 and 380 during the {{afternoon}} of the 14th because of bad road conditions. Interstate 80 was closed between Interstates 81 and 380. The combination of a heavy snowfall then a mix of sleet, snow and <b>freezing</b> <b>rain</b> made for hazardous road conditions. The mixed precipitation made it more difficult for some road crews to keep up. At 4 PM EST on the 17th the interstates reopened after ice was removed and the road surfaces was safe for travel. In and around the Greater Philadelphia Metropolitan area, in Bucks County, slippery road conditions contributed to a tractor-trailer accident on the 14th on Route 309 in Richland Township. The highway was closed for more than an hour, which forced motorists to detour on slush-covered side streets.|$|E
30|$|There {{are also}} {{changes in the}} spatial and {{temporal}} distribution of inclement weather conditions (e.g., heavy wet snowfalls, <b>freezing</b> <b>rains,</b> rain on snow, untimely thaws and peak streamflow) that, while not being extremes per se, substantially affect societal well-being and health (e.g., freezing events, Bulygina et al. 2015; Groisman et al. 2016) or indirectly impact the regional water budget (e.g., the influence of winter thaws and/or early snowmelt on the water deficit of the following growing season, Bulygina et al. 2009, 2011; Groisman and Soja 2009). Societal consequences {{of changes in the}} frequency and intensity of these extreme and inclement events have become an urgent task to address for the entire Earth Science research community (Forbes et al. 2016). In this regard, {{it is not enough to}} report and/or to project changes in characteristics of these events but also to develop a suite of strategies for resilient responses to new climate conditions that are forthcoming and/or have an increased higher probability than was previously expected.|$|R

5|$|The {{police officer}} who {{discovered}} the wreck initially suspected that only the semi had gone off the road. After further investigation, he found the van and called for emergency services, whose arrival was delayed by <b>freezing</b> <b>rain.</b> The rear wall and {{a large portion of}} the right-hand side of the van, including three rows of seats, had been torn away, ejecting several occupants. Seven players and the wife of the team coach were pronounced dead at the scene. The coach, his daughter and the two other players survived the accident and were rushed to Chaleur Regional Hospital in Bathurst. Of the injured, one was listed in critical condition, and two in stable. The fourth was released shortly after the accident. The driver of the truck was not injured.|$|E
5|$|As some warmer air {{began to}} move in above the surface, the snow mixed with and changed to sleet and <b>freezing</b> <b>rain</b> between 6 PM and 7 PM EST on the 13th in Philadelphia and Delaware Counties, then between 7 PM and 11 PM across most other areas in eastern Pennsylvania. The {{southern}} Poconos saw less mixed precipitation, however {{there was a period}} of mixed precipitation between about 7:30 PM on the 13th and 11:30 AM on the 14th. For a brief time during the afternoon of the 14th, temperatures rose a couple of degrees above freezing with no precipitation falling. Temperatures then dropped below freezing again by the late afternoon of the 14th with a period of snow before the precipitation came to an end between 8:30 PM and 10 PM on the 14th. Wraparound snow showers lingered in Monroe and Carbon Counties until 2 AM EST on the 15th.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} morning of 10 April, leading {{elements}} of the Austrian army crossed the Inn River and invaded Bavaria. Bad roads and <b>freezing</b> <b>rain</b> slowed the Austrian advance in the first week, but the opposing Bavarian forces gradually retreated. The Austrian attack occurred about a week before Napoleon's anticipations, and in his absence Berthier's role became all the more critical. Berthier (whose fortè was staff work) {{proved to be an}} insufficient field commander, a characteristic made worse by the fact that several messages from Paris were being delayed and misinterpreted when they finally arrived at headquarters. Whereas Napoleon had written to Berthier that an Austrian attack before 15 April should be met by a general French concentration around Donauwörth and Augsburg, Berthier focused on a sentence that called for Davout to station his III Corps around Regensburg and ordered the Iron Marshal to move back to the city despite massive Austrian pressure.|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT. Historical and archaeological records {{suggest that}} muskoxen (Ovibos moschatus) were once {{abundant}} on Banks Island. They declined {{around the turn}} of the 20 th century and remained at very low population levels until the 1970 s. The causes of the scarcity of muskoxen are unknown, but severe <b>freezing</b> <b>rains</b> and subsequent forage unavailability likely played a role. Aerial surveys documented an increase in the estimated population size from 3800 in 1972 to 34 225 in 1989. The rapid increase in muskox numbers has been a source of concern to the local users, who view the muskoxen as detrimental to the caribou (Rangifer tarundus paryr], which have declined in number. Since the mid-l 980 s, productivity of 3 -year-old muskox cows and calf survival have decreased and the prevalence of parasites has increased. Our data do not allow us to distinguish between whether those changes are density-dependent population responses or the effects of the severity of winter weather. Current management focuses on monitoring the trend of population size, the condition and reproduction of the muskoxen...|$|R

5|$|On {{the other}} side of the low {{pressure}} area, a significant blizzard occurred over the northern Great Plains and Upper Midwest, including parts of Minnesota, Manitoba, Saskatchewan, Wisconsin, Iowa and Nebraska, where several snowfalls in excess of 8 to 18inches (20–45cm) were reported, as well as snow of between 6 and 11inches (15–28cm) across portions of Ontario and Quebec. <b>Freezing</b> <b>rain</b> was reported across New England, the lower Great Lakes in Ontario, Michigan, and in the Chicago area. 19 people were killed by the storm, including two in Manitoba, two in Ontario, one in Massachusetts, four in North Dakota, one in Minnesota, three in Michigan, five in Wisconsin and one in Nebraska. The University of Minnesota in the Twin Cities was closed for the first time since 1991 and the roof of a supermarket in Wisconsin collapsed. Minnesota Governor Tim Pawlenty called in the National Guard while governors Chet Culver (Iowa) and Michael Rounds (South Dakota) issued disaster declarations.|$|E
5|$|While {{temperatures}} are somewhat lower on Gerlachovský štít {{because of its}} elevation, the weather and its potential impact on visitors is little different from other summits in the High Tatras both with and without marked trails. The typical daily weather pattern in the summer is a clear morning, clouds gathering by mid-morning—noon, occasional showers and storms in the afternoon. The chance of rain is lowest between 9–10 am and peaks between 2–3 pm, with a drop-off after 6pm. The frequency of storms with lightning (as opposed to rainstorms) on Gerlach's summit {{and on the other}} highest ridges is little different from lower elevations, too, but people exposed to wind, (sometimes <b>freezing)</b> <b>rain,</b> and lightning have greater difficulty to cope. The nearest shelter for those who ascend Gerlach is the Sliezsky Dom Hotel, there are no natural shelters along the route.|$|E
5|$|Moncton has a {{warm summer}} {{continental}} climate (Köppen climate classification Dfb) with uniform precipitation distribution. Winter days are typically cold but generally sunny with solar radiation generating some warmth. Daytime high temperatures usually range {{a few degrees}} below the freezing point. Major snowfalls can result from nor'easter ocean storms moving up {{the east coast of}} North America. These major snowfalls typically average 20–30cm (8–12in) and are frequently mixed with rain or <b>freezing</b> <b>rain.</b> Spring is frequently delayed because the sea ice that forms in the nearby Gulf of St. Lawrence during the previous winter requires time to melt, and this will cool onshore winds, which can extend inland as far as Moncton. The ice burden in the gulf has diminished considerably {{over the course of the}} last decade (which may be a consequence of global warming), and the springtime cooling effect has weakened as a result. Daytime temperatures above freezing are typical by late February. Trees are usually in full leaf by late May. Summers are hot and humid due to the seasonal prevailing westerly winds strengthening the continental tendencies of the local climate. Daytime highs sometimes reach more than 30°C (86°F). Rainfall is generally modest, especially in late July and August, and periods of drought are not uncommon. Autumn daytime temperatures remain mild until late October. First snowfalls usually do not occur until late November and consistent snow cover on the ground does not happen until late December. The Fundy coast of New Brunswick occasionally experiences the effects of post-tropical storms. The stormiest weather of the year, with the greatest precipitation and the strongest winds, usually occurs during the fall/winter transition (November to mid-January).|$|E
50|$|Despite Lina's {{mockery of}} Naga's magical skills, {{she is an}} {{exceptionally}} talented sorceress, and may, in fact, be Lina's greatest rival. She is well versed in black magic and capable of casting healing spells and golem-forming and dragon-conjuring spells. She is especially proficient at white magic, though she only uses it when absolutely necessary, and also specializes in shamanistic magic, in particular spells of earth and water variety. She enjoys creating golems (even if they usually do not turn out very well and sometimes go berserk and turn against her), has developed several of her own spells (including Bogardic Elm, <b>Freeze</b> <b>Rain,</b> Gu Ru Dooga, Mega Vu Vraimer, Void Breath and Vu Raywa), and her most common spells to use are water/ice-based (such as Freeze Arrow) in contrast to Lina who uses fire-related ones. Naga knows and can use the ultimate shamanistic and white magic spells (Ra Tilt and Resurrection), is able to stop living-dead powered via necromancy with a powerful Flow Break spell, and has learnt Levitation by just observing its use by Lina. According to Kanzaka, Naga and Lina are the mightiest human magic users {{in the world of}} Slayers and Naga actually has a larger potential magical capacity, while Lina knows the ultimate black magic spells (notably the devastating Dragon Slave).|$|R
