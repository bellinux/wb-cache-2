In order to make a comparative study on the effectiveness of mist and hydraulic sprayings, the authors prepared a genral view of the above-mentioned data (Fig, 1), taking the combination of concentration and dose of insecticides into consideration.

40|$|ReportThe {{goals of}} this project were to {{identify}} equipment that maximizes spray coverage {{on the underside of}} leaves of cucurbits and to determine if powdery mildew can be controlled effectively with nonsystemic fungicides when coverage is maximized. Conventional nozzles and sprayers deliver little spray material to the underside of leaves. Therefore, growers presently rely on systemic fungicides to control powdery mildew in cucurbits. Fungicide resistance is a major concern because systemic fungicides are at risk for resistance development due to their single-site mode of action and because the powdery mildew fungus has demonstrated high potential for developing resistance. For this project, unfortunately, it was only possible to examine spray coverage because of technical problems with the sprayer. Greater coverage on both leaf surfaces was achieved with the air induction and twin jet nozzles, two novel types for a conventional <b>hydraulic</b> <b>spray</b> boom, than with the traditional flat fan, hollow cone, and cone jet nozzles.

40|$|AgrosupBAPGEAPSIMicro and macro spray {{characterisation}} {{based on}} high speed camera techniques Presenting Author David Nuyttens - ILVO, Technology and Food Science Unit, Belgium Description Macro (spray angle, liquid sheet length, spray distribution) and micro spray characteristics (droplet size and velocity) influence {{the efficiency of the}} spray application. Consequently, more information on these spray characteristics can lead to a more efficient pesticide usage. This study focuses on measuring spray droplet characteristics using a high speed imaging technique developed by Vulgarakis et al. (2015, Trans ASABE, 58 : 27 - 37). In the first part, the macro spray characteristics from different types of <b>hydraulic</b> <b>spray</b> nozzles were measured using a developed backlighted image acquisition system and image processing technique. Tests included five different nozzles (Albuz ATR orange and red, TeeJet XR 110 01, XR 110 04 and Al 110 04) (Vulgarakis et al., 2014, Asp. App. Biol. 122 : 353 - 361). In the second part, micro spray characteristics were determined for the same nozzle pressure combinations. An in-focus droplet criterion was established to decide whether a droplet is in focus and can be measured in an accurate way (Vulgarakis et al., 2016, Sensors, 2 : 218). A calibration system was devised using different sized droplets generated with a piezoelectric droplet generator (Vulgarakis et al., 2015, Crop Prot, 69 : 18 - 27) at different distances from the focal plane. This enabled measurement of the grey level gradient and the in-focus parameter for every droplet size at various positions. From here, a critical in-focus parameter was established for every droplet size and an in-focus droplet criterion was deduced to decide whether a droplet is in focus or not depending on its diameter and in-focus parameter. The in-focus droplet criterion was applied to spray images and droplet characteristics were calculated. The effects of the nozzle type, nozzle size and measuring position on spray droplet size characteristics were studied. All imaging results were compared and related well with existing measuring techniques like the PDPA laser.

40|$|During an {{agricultural}} application, sprays are formed by atomization through a <b>hydraulic</b> nozzle. Fine <b>spray</b> droplets can cause off-target contamination with agrochemicals {{when they move}} by air from the application site. Dilute oil-in-water emulsions create coarser sprays than water, when atomized through a flat fan nozzle, and are therefore interesting for drift control purposes. However, different emulsions influence the spray droplet size to a different extent and this effect is not yet well understood. With an aim to develop products with drift reduction properties {{it is necessary to}} comprehend the mechanism of interactions between emulsion droplets and the continuous aqueous phase. In this study, we analyze systematically the effects of different physical properties of oils on the spray formation process and investigate how the type of the emulsified oil, the concentration of emulsifier, emulsion droplet size, the spreading properties of the emulsified oil, and its viscosity influence the spray droplet size. Based on the experimental data, we propose a spray formation mechanism of dilute oil-in-water emulsions. We argue that when the liquid sheet leaves the nozzle, some emulsion droplets might merge with the air/water interface of the liquid sheet, spread there and induce a subphase flow, which, reinforced by perturbations in a turbulent flow, will initiate spray atomization. In mixtures of a dilute emulsion and a water soluble surfactant, dynamic surface tension at the interface of the liquid sheet controls the spray formation process. Surfactants located at the interface form a kinetic barrier for the spreading emulsion droplets and thus delay the atomization onset...|$|R
40|$|In recent years, {{advances}} in plant protection have contributed considerably to increasing crop yields in a sustainable way. Easy to apply and rather inexpensive, pesticides {{have proven to}} be very efficient. However, when pesticides are applied to crops some of the spray may not reach the target, but move outside the intended spray area. This can cause serious economic and environmental problems. Most of the pesticides are applied using agricultural sprayers. These sprayers use hydraulic nozzles which break the liquid into droplets {{with a wide range of}} droplet sizes and velocities and determine the spray pattern. Small droplets are prone to wind drift, while large droplets can runoff from the target surface and deposit on the soil. Therefore, efforts are being undertaken to come to a more sustainable use of pesticides which is more and more regulated by international environmental laws. One of the main challenges is to reduce spray losses and maximize spray deposition and efficacy by improving the spray characteristics and the spray application process. Because mechanisms of droplets leaving a <b>hydraulic</b> <b>spray</b> nozzle are very complex and difficult to quantify or model, there is a need for accurate quantification techniques. The recent improvements in digital image processing, sensitivity of imaging systems and cost reduction have increased the interest in high-speed (HS) imaging techniques for agricultural applications in general and for pesticide applications in specific. This thesis focused on the development and application of high speed imaging techniques to measure micro (droplet size and velocity) and macro (spray angle and shape, liquid sheet length) spray characteristics. The general aim was to show that the spray characteristics from agricultural spray nozzles can be measured correctly with the developed imaging techniques in a non-intrusive way. After a review of the spray application process and techniques for spray characterization (Chapter 2), two image acquisition systems were developed in Chapter 3 based on single droplet experiments using a high speed camera and a piezoelectric droplet generator. 58 combinations of lenses, light sources, diffusers, and exposure times were tested using shadowgraph (background) imaging and evaluated based on image quality parameters (signal to noise rate, entropy ratio and contrast ratio), light stability and overexposure ratio and the accuracy of the droplet size measurement. These resulted into development of two image acquisition systems for measuring the macro and micro spray characteristics. The HS camera with a macro video zoom lens at a working distance of 143 mm with a larger field of view (FOV) of 88 mm x 110 mm in combination with a halogen spotlight and a diffuser was selected for measuring the macro spray characteristics (spray angle, spray shape and liquid sheet length). The optimal set-up for measuring micro spray characteristics (droplet size and velocity) consisted of a high speed camera with a 6 µs exposure time, a microscope lens at a working distance of 430 mm resulting in a FOV of 10. 5 mm x 8. 4 mm, and a xenon light source used as a backlight without diffuser. In Chapter 4 image analysis and processing algorithms were developed for measuring single droplet characteristics (size and velocity) and different approaches for image segmentation were presented. With the set-up for micro spray characterization and using these dedicated image analysis algorithms (Chapter 4), measurements using a single droplet generator in droplet on demand (DOD) and continuous mode were performed in Chapter 5. The effects of the operating parameters, including voltage pulse width and pulse amplitude with 4 nozzle orifice sizes (261 µm, 123 µm, 87 µm and 67 µm) on droplet diameter and droplet velocity have been characterized. The experiments in DOD mode have shown that the initial droplet characteristics from the droplet generator are a function of the double pulse width (absorption time (ta) and pulsation time (tp)) and the orifice size. By changing pulse width, it was possible to control droplet velocity and size. In general, decrease of ta and increase of tp increased the droplet diameter. Similarly, increasing the nozzle orifice size increased the droplet diameter. With the DOD mode, droplet sizes ranged between 134. 1 μm and 461. 5 μm. Foremost, the smallest and the fastest droplets were measured with the smallest nozzle orifice. The measured droplet velocities ranged between 0. 08 m/s and 1. 78 m/s. Besides, an effect of the pulse amplitude on the droplet diameter and velocity was noticed. The ratio of the droplet diameter and nozzle orifice in DOD mode ranged from 1. 3 to 3. 5. The continuous mode for every nozzle was established for a high frequency (kHz) resulting in a continuous droplet generation. This frequency together with different pulse amplitudes were used to test the effect on the droplet diameter, inter-droplet spacing and velocity. As for the DOD mode, the droplet diameter was mainly controlled by the nozzle orifice. The droplet size here was between 167. 2 μm and 455. 8 μm. Furthermore, the nozzle orifice also influenced the droplet velocity i. e., the bigger the nozzle orifice was, the higher the droplet velocity. Obviously, there was a linear trend between the droplet diameter and velocity in continuous mode. The ratios between the droplet diameter and the nozzle orifice ranged from 1. 3 to 3. 9. In continuous mode, the lowest droplet velocity of 1. 84 m/s was measured with the smallest nozzle orifice size while the highest droplet velocity of 4. 66 m/s was measured with the biggest nozzle orifice size. Based on the results in both modes, similar droplet sizes were produced in both modes but in continuous mode it was possible to achieve faster droplets which correspond better with real spray application. In Chapter 6, the image acquisition technique for measuring micro spray characteristics was used for measuring the droplet size and velocity characteristics of agricultural <b>hydraulic</b> <b>spray</b> nozzles. This included the development of an in-focus droplet criterion based on the gray level gradient to decide whether a droplet is in focus or not. Differently sized droplets generated with a piezoelectric generator and glass nozzles in continuous mode at different distances from the focal plane and lens using a micro translation stage were measured. This enabled measurement of the gray level gradient and in-focus parameter for every droplet size at different positions. From here, a critical in-focus parameter (Infc) was established for every droplet size and an in-focus droplet criterion was deduced to decide whether a droplet is in focus or not depending on its diameter and in-focus parameter. In this study the focused droplet zone (FDZ) was defined as the zone in which a droplet with a certain diameter is in focus and a linear relation between droplet size and FDZ was found. The developed in-focus droplet criterion was applied to spray images of five nozzles taken at different positions: two standard flat fan nozzles (XR 110 01 & 04 at 400 kPa), an air inclusion nozzle (AI 110 04 at 400 kPa) and two hollow cone nozzles (ATR orange at 600 kPa and red at 800 kPa). The effects of nozzle type, nozzle size and measuring position on droplet size and velocity characteristics were studied. The droplet size and velocity results from the imaging technique have shown that it is possible to measure the spray characteristics in a nonintrusive way using an image acquisition set-up and image processing. Measured droplet sizes ranged from 24 µm to 543 µm depending on the nozzle type and size. Droplet velocities at 0. 5 m below the nozzle ranged from 0. 5 m/s up to 12 m/s. Spray droplet size characteristics such as DV 0. 1, DV 0. 5, DV 0. 9 and RSF as well as spray velocity characteristics such as VVol 10, VVol 50, VVol 90 and VSF, were extracted from the images. Similar effects of nozzle type and measuring position on droplet sizes as well as on droplet velocities were found with the imaging technique as with the Phase Doppler Particle Analyzer (PDPA) laser technique. The developed imaging technique can be seen as an alternative to the well-established PDPA laser technique. The droplet diameter and velocity characteristics showed a relatively good comparison with the results measured with the PDPA laser. When compared with the PDPA laser, the imaging technique generally measured less small droplets and in some cases also less big droplets. Differences between both techniques can be attributed to the fact that the smallest measured droplet size with the imaging system is 24 µm while smaller droplets are measured with the PDPA. In addition, the number of droplets measured with the imaging technique was much smaller compared with the PDPA which increases the chance to miss one of the biggest droplets. This can be improved by taking more images. Differences in droplet velocity characteristics between both techniques can be attributed to the fact that the PDPA laser is only measuring droplet velocity in one dimension and hence underestimates the actual droplet velocity. In addition, the imaging technique applied did not allow the measurement of droplets faster than about 12 m/s based on FOV and the acquisition rate while some droplets with higher speeds were observed with the PDPA mainly for the XR 110 04. In future, the imaging system can be further improved to be able to measure at a higher frame rate with the same accuracy. In Chapter 7, the image acquisition system for macro spray characterization was used to measure the spray angle, spray shape and liquid sheet length of the same nozzle-pressures combinations as mentioned above. Where possible, the results were compared with the existing non-imaging measuring techniques like a horizontal patternator. The measured spray angles were higher than the nominal spray angle except for the XR 110 01 nozzle. For the hollow cone (ATR orange and red) and air inclusion nozzle (AI 110 04), the imaging technique gave a good comparison of the spray angle while the spray angle was underestimated for both standard flat fan nozzles (XR 110 01 & 04). The shortest liquid sheet was found for the XR 110 01 nozzle (18. 5 mm), followed by the two hollow cone nozzles (27. 4 and 31. 3 mm). The longest liquid sheets were found for the XR 110 04 (38. 9 mm) and AI 110 04 (43. 1 mm). In addition, from the spray shape, the spray pattern width at four heights (5, 10, 15 and 20 cm) of all selected nozzles and the corresponding spray angles were calculated and compared with the results from the horizontal patternator. For the spray angle, a good correspondence between imaging technique and patternator was found with relative errors of 0. 5 % for the XR 110 01, 0. 6 % for the XR 110 01 and AI 110 04 and 2. 8 % and 5. 4 % for the ATR orange and ATR red, respectively...|$|R

The number of fires increased during the first four 2 -year time periods (1990 - 1991, 1992 - 1993, 1994 - 1995, and 1996 - 1997), then decreased {{during the last two}} periods (1998 - 1999 and 2000 - 2001). The number of injuries showed a decrease throughout the periods, accompanied by an increase in employees' working hours. Twenty-five firefighting interventions by mine rescue teams in underground mines and at least 30 interventions at surface operations were required to combat these fires. However, 45 fires destroyed or heavily damaged facilities and equipment (including 19 pieces of mobile equipment) because of failure of firefighting methods, late fire detection, undetected fires, or fire size. Ninety-seven fires were detected late, and 30 fires were undetected. The ignition sources that caused the greatest number of fires were flame cutting/welding spark/slag/flame (169 fires or 33 % with 137 injuries), <b>hydraulic</b> fluid/fuel <b>sprayed</b> onto equipment hot surfaces (89 fires or 17 % with 46 injuries and 3 fatalities), heat source/explosion and flammable liquids/ gas/refueling fuel on hot surfaces (98 fires or 19 % with 73 injuries), electrical short/arcing (51 fires or 10 % with 16 injuries), and spontaneous combustion/hot material (46 fires or 9 % with 17 injuries). The flame cutting/welding spark/slag/flame source caused fires usually involving welders' clothing or oxyfuel/grease and other materials (including chute and dust collector liners, flammable liquids, belt material, crusher, hopper and shaker deck materials, washer plants, equipment mechanical components, stampler breaker, hydraulic fluid, rubber tires and hoses, gear boxes, bin feeder, dump rope cables, screen liner and screen panel, kiln and shaft material, pipelines, liquor pumps, wood pallets, electrical junction boxes, handrails, grease, refuse, shop and wood). The spontaneous combustion/hot material and electrical fires were usually detected late due to lack of combustion gas/smoke detection systems. At least 55 of the 89 mobile equipment hydraulic fluid/fuel fires became large fires (requiring 12 mine rescue team interventions in undergroun...|$|R
40|$|International audiencePesticide {{spraying}} {{in agriculture}} involves atomizing a liquid stream through a <b>hydraulic</b> nozzle. The <b>spray</b> droplets {{results from the}} destabilization of a liquid sheet formed by the nozzle. Standard pesticide solution adjuvants as dilute solution of long polymer chains or dilute emulsions are known to influence the spray drop size distribution. Although being documented, these effects are not understood yet. In order to elucidate the physical mechanisms at {{the origin of the}} change on the drop size distribution, we investigate the influence of different complex fluids on the destabilization mechanisms of liquid sheets. We here form liquid sheets by the collision of a liquid drop on a small solid target. Upon impact, the drop flattens into a radial sheet expanding in the air bounded by a thicker rim. Different destabilization mechanisms of the sheet are observed depending on the fluid nature. A pure water sheet spreads out radially until it reaches a maximum diameter and then retracts due to the effect of surface tension. The destabilization mechanism is drastically modified when a dilute oil in water emulsion is used. The liquid sheet spreads out radially but holes perforate the sheet before the retraction, as already observed for some surfactant solutions [1]. The holes grow until they merge together and form a web of ligaments, which are then destabilized into droplets. To investigate the different sheet destabilization mechanisms, we use a fast camera imaging coupled to an original technique recently developed to access the time and space-resolved sheet thickness. Physico-chemical parameters of the dilute emulsion are modified to rationalize their influence on the perforation mechanism as for instance the influence of the emulsion concentration. We show in particular that the number of hole nucleation events per liquid sheet is directly governed by the emulsion concentration. In striking concordance, we find that the emulsion concentration directly controls the drop size distributions of a spray, as measured with a diffraction-based size analyzer, suggesting that experiments on liquid sheets are appropriate model experiments to gain an understanding on the physical mechanisms governing the spray drop size distribution.

40|$|AbstractThe {{reduction}} of environmental contaminants {{that contribute to}} smog and soot is a worldwide goal that has seen an increased focus in recent years. In the United States, for example, {{it is estimated that}} by 2014 new rules will lead to a 71 % {{reduction of}} sulfur dioxide emissions and 52 % of nitrogen oxide emissions as compared to 2005 level. Thus, medium-sized plants (100 - 500 MW) that currently do not have flue gas desulfurization (FGD) units or selective catalytic reduction systems (SCRs) will be required to adapt. Similar emission reduction efforts are expected to be adopted globally, albeit at different levels. Wet-scrubber FGD is characterized {{as one of the most}} effective SO 2 removal techniques with low operating costs. However capital cost for implementation is considered high. Hence an effective optimization procedure is required to reduce these capital costs of conversion. Power plants commonly use a lime slurry spray reaction to reduce SO 2 emissions. Control of the droplets throughout the tower geometry is essential to ensuring maximum reduction while minimizing scale. The liquid slurry is known to have density, surface tension and viscosity values that deviate from standard water spray characteristics, which complicates process optimization. In order to improve the scrubber, nozzle characteristics and placement must be optimized to reduce the cost of the system implementation and mitigate risks of inadequate pollution reduction. A series of large flow rate, <b>hydraulic,</b> hollow cone <b>sprays</b> were investigated for this study. A Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) model was used to examine potential scrubber designs for optimization of the system. Nozzle parameters were modeled to allow particle tracking through the system. An ANSYS Fluent Lagrangian particle tracking method was used with heat and mass transfer. The alkaline sorbent material and SO 2 reaction is modeled to determine uniformity and efficacy of the system. Volumetric chemistry mechanisms were used to simulate the reaction. These results demonstrate the expected liquid-gas interaction relative to the system efficiency. Drop size, liquid rheology, and spray array layout were examined to achieve SO 2 removal above 90 %. Wall impingement and flow pattern results were evaluated due to their impact in minimizing equipment plugging and corrosion required as for long-term scrubber utilization...|$|R
