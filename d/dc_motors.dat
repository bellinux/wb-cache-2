40|$|Abstract- Speed {{control of}} <b>DC</b> <b>Motor</b> is vital in many applications. In this paper, an {{effort has been}} made to control the speed of the <b>DC</b> <b>motor</b> using fuzzy logic control (FLC) based on LabVIEW (Laboratory Virtual Instrument Engineering Workbench) program. LabVIEW {{provides}} a graphical programming environment suited for high-level or system-level design. The fuzzy logic controller designed to apply the required control voltage that sent to <b>dc</b> <b>motor</b> based on fuzzy rule base of motor speed error (e) and change of speed error (Ce).

25|$|A {{servomotor}} is a motor, {{very often}} {{sold as a}} complete module, which is used within a position-control or speed-control feedback control system mainly control valves, such as motor-operated control valves. Servomotors are used in applications such as machine tools, pen plotters, and other process systems. Motors intended {{for use in a}} servomechanism must have well-documented characteristics for speed, torque, and power. The speed vs. torque curve is quite important and is high ratio for a servo motor. Dynamic response characteristics such as winding inductance and rotor inertia are also important; these factors limit the overall performance of the servomechanism loop. Large, powerful, but slow-responding servo loops may use conventional AC or <b>DC</b> <b>motors</b> and drive systems with position or speed feedback on the motor. As dynamic response requirements increase, more specialized motor designs such as coreless motors are used. AC motors' superior power density and acceleration characteristics compared to that of <b>DC</b> <b>motors</b> tends to favor PM synchronous, BLDC, induction, and SRM drive applications.|$|E
25|$|Drive – some robots connect {{electric}} motors {{to the joint}}s via gears; others connect the motor to the joint directly (direct drive). Using gears results in measurable 'backlash' which is free movement in an axis. Smaller robot arms frequently employ high speed, low torque <b>DC</b> <b>motors,</b> which generally require high gearing ratios; this has the disadvantage of backlash. In such cases the harmonic drive is often used.|$|E
25|$|The unique {{advantage}} of ironless <b>DC</b> <b>motors</b> {{is that there}} is no cogging (torque variations caused by changing attraction between the iron and the magnets). Parasitic eddy currents cannot form in the rotor as it is totally ironless, although iron rotors are laminated. This can greatly improve efficiency, but variable-speed controllers must use a higher switching rate (>40kHz) or DC because of the decreased electromagnetic induction.|$|E

25|$|Rectifier locomotives, {{which used}} AC power {{transmission}} and <b>DC</b> <b>motors,</b> were common, though DC commutators had problems both in starting and at low velocities. Today's advanced electric locomotives use brushless three-phase AC induction motors. These polyphase machines are powered from GTO-, IGCT- or IGBT-based inverters.

25|$|Most of the {{electric}} machines used in hybrid vehicles are brushless <b>DC</b> <b>motors</b> (BLDC). Specifically, they are of a type called an interior permanent magnet (IPM) machine (or motor). These machines are wound similarly to the induction motors found in a typical home, but (for high efficiency) use very strong rare-earth magnets in the rotor. These magnets contain neodymium, iron and boron, and are therefore called Neodymium magnets.|$|E

25|$|Recent {{alternatives}} to <b>DC</b> <b>motors</b> are piezo motors or ultrasonic motors. These {{work on a}} fundamentally different principle, whereby tiny piezoceramic elements, vibrating many thousands of times per second, cause linear or rotary motion. There are different mechanisms of operation; one type uses the vibration of the piezo elements to step the motor in a circle or a straight line. Another type uses the piezo elements to cause a nut to vibrate or to drive a screw. The advantages of these motors are nanometer resolution, speed, and available force for their size. These motors are already available commercially, and being used on some robots.|$|E
25|$|N scale {{locomotives}} are {{powered by}} <b>DC</b> <b>motors</b> which accept {{a maximum of}} 12 V DC. In traditional DC control, {{the speed of the}} train is determined by the amount of voltage supplied to the rails. The direction of the train is determined by the polarity of the power to the rails. Since the end of the 20th century, an increasing number of enthusiasts have started using digital train control systems to determine the speed and direction of their trains. This has in part been made possible by surface mount technology and new motors that draw very little current (typically 0.2 amps). The most popular digital control systems used in N scale model railways are NMRA-DCC and Selectrix.|$|E

While the nominal speed of the propulsion motors was 115 rpm, full power was available at all revolution speeds between 110 and 150 rpm. The four-blade propellers were of fixed pitch type with the centerline propeller, which had twice the propulsion power of the wing shafts, having greater diameter than the port and starboard propellers. The icebreaker had a single centerline rudder.|$|E

25|$|The first {{commutator}} DC {{electric motor}} capable of turning machinery {{was invented by}} the British scientist William Sturgeon in 1832. Following Sturgeon's work, a commutator-type direct-current electric motor made {{with the intention of}} commercial use was built by the American inventor Thomas Davenport, which he patented in 1837. The motors ran at up to 600 revolutions per minute, and powered machine tools and a printing press. Due to the high cost of primary battery power, the motors were commercially unsuccessful and Davenport went bankrupt. Several inventors followed Sturgeon in the development of <b>DC</b> <b>motors</b> but all encountered the same battery power cost issues. No electricity distribution had been developed at the time.

25|$|At {{the end of}} the NXEA franchise, Angel Trains {{opted to}} use off-lease Class 317/7 unit 317722 as a {{test-bed}} unit and engaged Bombardier Transportation to rebuild it as a pre-series unit with new traction equipment. The <b>DC</b> <b>motors,</b> traction electronics and thyristors were removed, though the original transformer remained in place. The original bogies were modified to accept new AC motors, and 3-phase converters fitted. Regenerative braking was also fitted. Because AC motors are more reliable than DC ones and require significantly less maintenance, this should potentially bring significant cost savings. The work has the potential to extend the life of the Class 317 by up to 20 years. Angel Trains and Bombardier will evaluate the performance of the unit compared to a conventional Class 317.|$|E
25|$|An {{advantage}} of the universal motor is that AC supplies may be used on motors that have some characteristics more common in <b>DC</b> <b>motors,</b> specifically high starting torque and very compact design if high running speeds are used. The negative aspect is the maintenance and short life problems caused by the commutator. Such motors are used in devices, such as food mixers and power tools, that are used only intermittently, and often have high starting-torque demands. Multiple taps on the field coil provide (imprecise) stepped speed control. Household blenders that advertise many speeds frequently combine a field coil with several taps and a diode that can be inserted in series with the motor (causing the motor to run on half-wave rectified AC). Universal motors also lend themselves to electronic speed control and, as such, are an ideal choice for devices like domestic washing machines. The motor {{can be used to}} agitate the drum (both forwards and in reverse) by switching the field winding with respect to the armature.|$|E

In this. The Insulated Gate Bipolar Transistor (IGBT) is used for speed control of <b>DC</b> <b>motor</b> which is very smooth in operation. The chopper circuit is designed by Insulated Gate Bipolar Transistor (IGBT) to control the speed of <b>DC</b> <b>motor</b> in both direction.
