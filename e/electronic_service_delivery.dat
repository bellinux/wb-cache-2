50|$|As part {{of their}} {{resilience}} strategies, city governments are increasingly relying on digital technology {{as part of a}} city’s infrastructure and service delivery systems. On the one hand, reliance on technologies and <b>electronic</b> <b>service</b> <b>delivery</b> has made cities more vulnerable to hacking and cyberattacks. At the same time, information technologies have often had a positive transformative impact by supporting innovation and promoting efficiencies in urban infrastructure, thus leading to lower-cost city services. The deployment of new technologies in the initial construction of infrastructure have in some cases even allowed urban economies to leapfrog stages of development. An unintended outcome of the growing digitalization of cities is the emergence of a digital divide, which can exacerbate inequality between well-connected affluent neighborhoods and business districts, on the one hand, and under-serviced and under-connected low-income neighborhoods, on the other. In response, a number of cities have introduced digital inclusion programs to ensure that all citizens have the necessary tools to thrive in an increasingly digitalized world.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: E-government {{still faces}} many {{challenges}} as {{it continues to}} develop. The current status of <b>electronic</b> <b>services</b> <b>delivery</b> opens {{up a lot of}} questions, both for practitioners and researchers. Therefore, further progress of e-government needs a profound knowledge base. E-government policy has focused several years on bringing online public services and on benchmarking their availability and sophistication. Simultaneously, e-government measurement activities are often based on the so-called supply-side benchmarking. This is important knowledge, however, it is under criticism because it lacks a user-centric viewpoint of e-government development. In this paper a bottom-up and data-driven approach is presented how research could help to manage (user-centric) e-government strategies. Based on statistical testing (techniques of Structural Equation Modeling, SEM) of large sample data from the Belgian government, we have investigated which relations do exist between contextual variables and the availability and/or satisfaction of <b>electronic</b> public <b>services.</b> This paper presents an illustration of this data-driven approach and explains how this can support and enrich the management and evaluation of e-government policy...|$|R
40|$|The Government is now {{committing}} substantial sums {{of money}} to achieving the introduction of <b>electronic</b> <b>services</b> <b>delivery</b> {{and the development of}} e-government. In addition to the normal investment and revenue spending by departments and agencies on the development of IT infrastructure and on Web sites and Intranets, an additional £ 1 billion is being invested {{over the next three years}} from April 2001 to boost central government organisations' presence on-line. As part of this effort the Department for Transport, Local Government and the Regions is providing £ 350 million to promote e-government innovations among 388 local authorities in England. These major investments reflect the target set by the Prime Minister in spring 2000 that all public services which can be transacted electronically should be available on line for citizens and firms in 2005.

The shape of <b>electronic</b> <b>service</b> <b>delivery</b> in social housing was found to be heavily influenced by the high complexity of transactions between social landlords and tenants, and by the ethos of some social landlords. The research also suggested there was a broad consensus between social landlords and tenants with regard to the practical limits of online services.

40|$|Proceedings of the 37 th Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences- 2004 Governments {{around the}} world are {{increasingly}} interested in the potential for delivering government services on the World Wide Web. Examples of substantial transition to <b>electronic</b> <b>service</b> <b>delivery</b> can be found in some sectors in some countries, however most government services have failed to evolve from enhanced information-based web pages.

40|$|This article {{describes}} the trend of personalization in <b>electronic</b> <b>service</b> <b>delivery,</b> with a special focus on municipal <b>electronic</b> <b>service</b> <b>delivery</b> in the Netherlands. Personalization of electronic services refers to the one-to-one citizen orientation using authentication, profiling and customization techniques. The percentage of Dutch municipalities offering services through personalized electronic counters has increased from 14 % (2006) to 28 % (2009). Using binary logistic regression analyses of 2008 survey data, it is concluded that personalization is positively associated with size of municipalities but not with e-government and policy innovation statements, nor with explicit political responsibility with respect to e-government development. Based on these findings, alternative explanations for the adoption and diffusion of personalized e-government services are suggested. Copyrigh...|$|E

40|$|Many governments {{promote the}} {{development}} of <b>electronic</b> <b>service</b> <b>delivery.</b> That is to say, policy plans outlining the electronic future of public administration are developed at the national level, while the actual implementation of these plans is often thought to {{take place at the}} local level (e. g. (BZK 1995; BZK 1998)). What does this mean in practice? If we look at e-government development at the local level, we can make some observations. First of all, many local authorities are turning their paper forms into online forms and their brochures into electronic brochures. And since many municipalities basically use the same forms, or at least use the same data (name, address, income data etc), this means that many are doing {{more or less the same}} work. Secondly, there is little intelligence in the <b>electronic</b> <b>service</b> <b>delivery.</b> The online forms are used as input for back-office procedures with little pre-processing of that input. <b>Electronic</b> <b>service</b> <b>delivery</b> is therefore, in many cases, no more than dumb data entry facilities for the public.

40|$|Two of {{the central}} {{challenges}} of e-government are the need for "joined-up" government through agency collaboration, {{and the need to}} provide "citizen-centred" government, where services and information are integrated at the point of delivery. <b>Electronic</b> <b>service</b> <b>delivery</b> provides the hoped for panacea to enable not only administrative efficiencies in the functions of government, but also services that are centred on the needs of the citizen.

However, the development of quality <b>electronic</b> <b>services</b> and <b>delivery</b> systems that are efficient and effective is only one way to improve the citizens' quality of life. The essence of e-government lies as well in engaging citizenry into the use of e-government services. As a result, this paper builds on the elementary concept of the time that citizens spend on their transactions with the Public Administration to provide a) an evaluation of e-government services in terms of the benefits that their use involves for citizens compared to the use of conventional ones b) an evaluation of the actual utilization of e-government services by the citizens. To overcome the impediment of subjectivity and uncertainty that is innate in the citizens' estimations regarding the time spent, fuzzy triangular numbers are adopted.
