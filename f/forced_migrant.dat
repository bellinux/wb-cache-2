Kalpana born and brought up in coastal Orissa, was leading a harmonious life with her fisherman husband. As they were dreaming to add more colours into their life, the infamous super cyclone of October 1999 strikes. It leaves all her family member dead. Kalpana miraculously survives. And, with the support of her childhood friend Akshaya, she limps back to a life now full of emptiness. The links with her past being snapped off, Kalpana feels alienated in her own native place. A sense of dispossession engulfs her. Kalpana tired with her own struggle and very much bitter at the meaningless publicity made out of her, firmly refuses Dipankar for an interview. Disappointed, he returns to his own country without the story he wanted to do on Kalpana. Kalpana lives an isolated life with an uncertain future. She does small job with the support of local NGO and fights to safeguard her dignity from the lusts of society. Kalpana’s life is limited to ceaseless follow up with the government officials for the death compensation package.|$|E

40|$|When {{considering}} {{the magnitude of}} forced migration on a global scale, the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) shows that as of 2013 there were 51. 2 million people forcibly displaced worldwide. This represents {{the highest level of}} people forcibly displaced since the aftermath of World War II. Bearing in mind the contemporary migratory context characterised by mounting worldwide incidents of migration and displacement due to wars, persecution, violence, human rights violations, environmental catastrophes, and economic upheavals, perhaps now more than ever there is a greater need to promote successful resettlement among <b>forced</b> <b>migrants.</b> An important way of supporting <b>forced</b> <b>migrants</b> in a new society lies in building knowledge about the everyday ways working and learning occurs in and though the process of resettlement. This paper focuses on the work and learning experiences of resettling <b>forced</b> <b>migrants</b> in Sydney, Australia. In their own words <b>forced</b> <b>migrants</b> describe their everyday resettlement activities taking up their time and effort as they work to rebuild their lives in Australia. It is argued that the everyday resettlement activities of <b>forced</b> <b>migrants</b> constitute unique and often unrecognised forms of work and learning. Furthermore, this paper will establish that the work and learning actualities of resettling <b>forced</b> <b>migrants,</b> must be acknowledged and supported in order to promote successful resettlement and social cohesion in increasingly multicultural settler societies such as Australia. Using an institutional ethnographic lens (Smith, 1999, 2003, 2005 a, 2006) this paper explores how forced migrants’ everyday resettlement actualities catch them up in deeply embodied forms of work and learning. These hitherto unrecognised forms of work and learning are referred to as ‘resettlement-work’ and ‘resettlement-learning’ to capture the ways in which <b>forced</b> <b>migrants</b> act as both ‘resettlement-workers’ and ‘resettlement-learners’. Viewing <b>forced</b> <b>migrants</b> as resettlement-workers and resettlement-learners requires an ontological shift to apprehend how they are actively involved in embodied, conceptual, labouring, historical and generational acts of migration and resettlement. As <b>forced</b> <b>migrants</b> describe their localised and situated everyday resettlement activities their stories offer insights into how they actively work and learn to resettle by strategically navigating through the ‘institutional regime of migration and resettlement’. The inquiry relies upon narrative accounts to reveal the resettlement actualities of <b>forced</b> <b>migrants</b> who are understood to be experts of their social reality because they possess insights that can only be obtained through direct and intimate experiences with migration and resettlement. Consequently, it is a methodological imperative to become familiar with the experienced actualities of <b>forced</b> <b>migrants</b> through a theorised exploration of their everyday resettlement actualities. By opening discursive spaces in research for <b>forced</b> <b>migrants</b> to speak about their embodied actualities with resettlement, this paper endeavours to draw upon their expertise and to centre their voices in the construction of knowledge about resettlement-work and resettlement-learning...|$|R

The national border is key to the discursive definition of the <b>forced</b> <b>migrant</b> as a threatening ‘global illegal’. The thesis argues, however, that the concept of the European border has expanded from its everyday construct into a normative global instrument that not only assigns identity, but is summoned into being by the supposed inherent qualities of the individual who attempts to cross it, wherever they may be. The creation of racial stereotypes {{has become one of the}} foremost tools of this form of identity management: the research reveals that the racialisation of the figure of the ‘absolute alien’ plays a fundamental role in the construction of an overarching sense of ‘European-ness’. The war on terror, by summoning up the racialised figure of the ‘global jihadi’, which is discursively linked to the image of the <b>forced</b> <b>migrant</b> as a threatening global ‘illegal alien’, has enabled the creation of a European asylumsecurity nexus. The way the figure of the <b>forced</b> <b>migrant</b> has been fashioned into the natural subject of a politics of (in) security has become an essential component in the construction of a hyper-national ‘European identity’. The thesis concludes that the <b>forced</b> <b>migrant,</b> fashioned out of national materials as the ultimate ‘global alien’, is the ideological pivot for the normalisation of a global system of exploitation as manifest in its national form, and gains an even more exaggerated importance when economic and political crisis presents an overwhelming need to promote the idea of ‘European-ness’...|$|E

40|$|In {{the context}} of the needs and rights of older migrants, {{migration}} history is particularly important where the elderly <b>forced</b> <b>migrants</b> are twice as vulnerable. Bearing in mind the intense process of population aging in Serbia which holds the attention of scientists and experts, and the large number of refugees who immigrated in the 90 -ies from the former Yugoslav republics, selected sociodemographic structures of the elderly <b>forced</b> <b>migrants</b> in Serbia were analyzed as well as the relevant legal and strategic framework. The aim was to contribute to increasing knowledge of the demographic challenges of this subpopulation of <b>forced</b> <b>migrants,</b> as well as the differences relative to the domicile aging population. The data used in this study included a contingent of <b>forced</b> <b>migrants</b> aged 65 and over, on the basis of additionally processed Census data from 2011, based on questions about the place of birth of the person, year of arrival, the country in which the person lived and the reasons for migration. Hence, the category which is the subject of research, is not defined on the basis of formal refugee status. A comparison of selected sociodemographic characteristics was made in relation to the domicile population, which in the paper means the population of Serbia without <b>forced</b> <b>migrants.</b> The research results indicate that older <b>forced</b> <b>migrants</b> in Serbia have characteristics of the general population of older people in Serbia. Their age gender and marital structures are relatively similar. Most older women are widows who are heads of households, while a significant number are persons with disabilities as well. However, the process of aging of the elderly, present within the local population has not affected <b>forced</b> <b>migrants</b> yet, so this population is to some extent more vital. Data on the economic activity of the elderly <b>forced</b> <b>migrants</b> in Serbia point out to the lack of income as the main problem they are faced with. Older <b>forced</b> <b>migrants</b> are economically active to a lesser extent compared to the domicile elderly population, while the major differences between the two subgroups of the population are observed among the economically inactive persons. There is a noticeable smaller share of pensioners and a significantly higher share of persons who perform only housework in their households of elderly <b>forced</b> <b>migrants</b> than for the domicile aging population, largely owing to the female population. This {{can be explained by the}} lower level of female employment of <b>forced</b> <b>migrants</b> in countries of origin but could also result from the circumstances of exile. Single person elderly households of <b>forced</b> <b>migrants</b> are twice as vulnerable in economic terms than the domicile one, which confirms the high dependence of these groups of older migrants on financial aid. The lack of income of one part of the elderly <b>forced</b> <b>migrants</b> is a consequence of the unresolved issue of pension payments from Croatia, as most of the older <b>forced</b> <b>migrants</b> in Serbia are people from that former republic of Yugoslavia. The older <b>forced</b> <b>migrants</b> in Serbia from the former Yugoslav republics are relatively few in number, but a sensitive population that has legally integrated into the community since 2001 and is facing the same challenges as the local elderly population. Due to the circumstances of refugeeism in Serbia, these persons, as opposed to older migrants in other countries, have no linguistic or cultural barriers that could potentially hinder their integration within society but also within the social welfare and health care. However, although they have all legal rights as the local population, refugeeism gives a specific earmark to the social aspects of aging of these persons, and hinders their integration into economic and social life...|$|R

40|$|Background. In the {{psychological}} sense coping is deﬁned as {{the spectrum of}} overcoming activity – from unconscious psychological defense to conscious and purposeful overcoming of difﬁcult or stressful life-situations (R. Lazarus & P. Folkman, P. Spilberg, D. Terry, P. Teylor, L. Burlachuk & O. Korzhova, K. Muzdibaev, S. Nartova-Bochaver, T. Tytarenko); the process of “positive” successful adaptation to new cultural environment or post-stress growth (K. Oberg, M. Seligman). Factor approach is basic for this study. The objective {{of this study was}} to investigate positive and negative factors which inﬂuence the speciﬁcs of coping behavior and coping-strategies as adaptative strategies of the Ukrainian <b>forced</b> <b>migrant</b> male youth male in comparison with young adult male non-migrants who do not have the stress of forced internal moving experience. Method. A quasi-experimental design for non-equivalent groups singled out on the basis of their coping strategies and coping resources, estimated by the scales COPE by C. S. Carver, CRIS by K. B. Matheny et al. was chosen. The data was clastered with K-averages.   The  groups  were  analyzed  according  to  t-Student’s,  r-Pearson’s  criteria against the characteristics measured by the battery of questionnairs LSC by J.

Conclusions. The major research ﬁnding is that a forces mirgant’s prospects of positive adaption or post-stress growth appear to be more favorable in case of high indices of productive cоping-strategies, and the more the cоping-strategies and cоping-resources to be used.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this research is}} to analyze the survival strategies of internal forced migrants in urban areas relative to the strategies adopted by voluntary migrants and natives. I focused on relative differentials on gender, socioeconomic conditions and occupation profiles. To achieve this goal, I develop a research design to collect comparable data on households with diverse migration experiences. I study the Colombian case where internal displacement is highly prevalent due to the ongoing armed conflict. The analysis of gender differentials and household composition reveals that <b>forced</b> <b>migrant</b> households {{are more likely to be}} composed by household head and spouse rather than headed by single females, as suggested in the literature. Moreover, <b>forced</b> <b>migrant</b> females are not more likely to find jobs than males. It is clear that the probability of employment in formal activities for forced migrants decreases over time preventing their ability to get out of poverty. The analysis of socioeconomic differentials explores four different dimensions: living conditions, consumption of durable goods, access to health care and education and self assessment of well-being. The results suggest that forced migrants had better living conditions in the place of longest residence than in Bogotá. In contrast, voluntary migrants enjoyed better living conditions in Bogotá than in their place of longest residence. Changes in the relative socioeconomic conditions of migrant groups are interpreted as an indication of negative selection of forced migrants into the domestic migration streams. Finally, I evaluate differentials in occupation profiles in the places of origin, the places of transition and in the final place of destination for economic, tied and forced migrants. There were no observed differences in the likelihood of employment in agriculture between forced migrants and economic migrants in the place of origin. In Bogotá, forced and economic migrants were more likely to be employed in informal and unstable activities related to coping strategies rather than cumulative strategies. The occupation profiles of forced migrants suggest that weak or absence of social networks in the areas of reception might help to explain the relative ineffective adaptation of forced migrants in the urban labor market. ...|$|E
40|$|More details/abstract: For {{displaced}} people, citizenship(or {{the lack}} of it) is a crucial issue. Displaced people are denied formal citizenship and rights but are now claiming them, subjectively seeing their de facto experience as live d citizenship. Protests, claim assertions and transnational alliances are ways in which their struggle for rights is manifested. Much of the existing literature tends {{to focus on a}} top- down understanding of displaced people as citizens/non- citizens and the formal processes available (or not available) to them, ignoring the importance of informal processes as well as local agency and practice, which this article explores through case study examples. The article also examines displacement in the light of differing theoretical meanings of citizenship, and asks to what extent the <b>forced</b> <b>migrant</b> is a global or transnational citizen.

40|$|ABSTRACT This paper {{analyses}} {{what has}} arguably become a salient feature of a ‘just city’ {{and social development}} on an international level, namely social justice. Specifically, it focuses {{on the role of}} the Johannesburg’s civil society organisations in promoting greater social justice for <b>forced</b> <b>migrants</b> (refugees and asylum seekers) living in the downtown Johannesburg. For this purpose, a case study was carried out, particularly with Africa’s <b>forced</b> <b>migrants</b> living in the inner city of Johannesburg (in Hillbrow and Yeoville). The research makes use of in-depth interview and participant observation methods to uncover the perspectives of a group of refugees and asylum seekers and members of seven civil society organisations, working with <b>forced</b> <b>migrants</b> in Johannesburg. The main research question that the study addresses is: What role can civil society organisations play in facilitating greater social justice for Africa’s asylum seekers and refugees living in the inner city of Johannesburg? I have concluded that Johannesburg’s civil society organisations have the potential, which may allow them to bring social transformation and create a just city by promoting a greater social justice for <b>forced</b> <b>migrants</b> living in the inner city. To achieve this goal, they should play a reformative and transformative role in the inner city, by challenging government exclusionary policies and decisions relating to the forced migrants; and, at the same time, they should mediate between the government and <b>forced</b> <b>migrants</b> at the local and national levels. To conclude this report, I recommended civil society organisations to develop strong collaboration with the city’s planners for a better improvement of the quality of life of <b>forced</b> <b>migrants</b> in the inner city. I also recommend the national government to decentralise its decision-making power on international migration issues by conferring to the provinces and local governments certain power which can allow them to develop internal structures (taking into account the context of each province), which can allow them to protect the basic rights of refugees and asylum seekers, such as the rights to work, to study, and to access free health care...|$|R
40|$|Aim: To {{describe}} and appraise {{the research literature}} reporting prevalence of torture and/or war-related potentially traumatic experiences (PTEs) in adult <b>forced</b> <b>migrants</b> living in high-income countries. Methods: A search for peer-reviewed articles in English was conducted in PubMed, Web of Science, PILOTS, key journals, and reference lists. Studies based on clinical samples and samples where {{less than half of}} participants were <b>forced</b> <b>migrants</b> were excluded. Data was extracted and a methodological quality appraisal was performed. Results: A total of 3, 470 titles and abstracts were retrieved and screened. Of these, 198 were retrieved in full-text. Forty-one articles fulfilled inclusion criteria and the total number of study participants was 12, 020 (median 170). A majority focused on specific ethnic groups or nationalities, Southeast Asian, Middle Eastern and Balkan being the most frequent. Reported prevalence rates of torture ranged between one and 76 % (median 27 %). Almost all participants across all studies had experienced some kind of war-related PTE. Conclusions: Reported prevalence rates of torture and war-related PTEs vary between groups of <b>forced</b> <b>migrants.</b> Trauma history was often studied as a background variable in relation to mental health. The heterogeneity of data, as well as the methodological challenges in reaching <b>forced</b> <b>migrants</b> and defining and measuring traumatic experiences, prevent generalisation concerning trauma history across groups...|$|R
