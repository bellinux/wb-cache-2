5|$|Despite the storm's {{powerful}} intensity, Hurricane Dean's {{damage was}} moderate. <b>It</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> severe or lasting effects on infrastructure, and the non-agricultural sectors of economies throughout the Greater Antilles recovered quickly.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{these changes}} the knife was true to Emerson's {{original}} design, {{and even though}} <b>it</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> the craftsmanship of a handmade piece of cutlery it satisfied customers with {{their own version of}} Emerson's work at a lower price point and without the five-year wait.|$|E
5|$|First, Universal {{knew that}} <b>it</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> {{trademark}} rights to King Kong, yet it proceeded to broadly assert such rights anyway. This {{amounted to a}} wanton and reckless disregard of Nintendo's rights.|$|E
50|$|The {{principal}} {{problem in}} the public (ejido) sector is that <b>it</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> adequate infrastructure. Also, <b>it</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> access to banking credit.|$|R

5|$|Hoover {{directed}} the FBI to track King in 1957, and the SCLC {{as it was}} established (<b>it</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> a full-time executive director until 1960). The investigations were largely superficial until 1962, when the FBI learned that one of King's most trusted advisers was New York City lawyer Stanley Levison.|$|E
5|$|Optical imaging {{inside the}} crater {{was done for}} the first time by the Japanese lunar orbiter {{spacecraft}} Kaguya in 2007. <b>It</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> any evidence of significant amount of water ice, down to the image resolution of 10 m per pixel.|$|E
5|$|The mosque at Ajdabiya in Libya had {{a similar}} plan, {{although}} <b>it</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> the same monumental entrance. Like the Mahdiya mosque, for the same ideological reasons, the Ajdabiya mosque {{did not have a}} minaret.|$|E

5|$|When the Whitehall–Fair Haven highway first opened, <b>it</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> a designation. However, {{the road}} {{was part of the}} {{proposed}} routing of US4, a route in the new U.S. Highway System. It officially became part of US4 when the system was officially approved in November of that year.|$|E
5|$|Despite Dean's {{significant}} damage, <b>it</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> severe {{effects on}} infrastructure, and the non-agricultural sectors of most affected nations recovered quickly. Most cruise lines diverted their ships {{away from the}} Western Caribbean in anticipation of Hurricane Dean's passage, though by August 27 all were back on schedule, except those with damaged ports in Belize and the Yucatán. The Lesser Antilles and the Greater Antilles were especially quick to resume servicing cruise lines, as their ports opened within days.|$|E
5|$|The {{episode was}} {{directed}} by Swinton O. Scott III. In the opening shot of the episode, the bus that the children travel in to the field trip had to vibrate up and down {{to give the impression}} that <b>it</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> bumpers and that it was falling apart. Scott said it was difficult to animate the scene because of the vibrating and the backgrounds panning. Milhouse's tutor in the episode is based on the American actor Tony Randall.|$|E

5|$|The synagogue {{occupied}} {{the greater part}} of the plot, facing west. It receded from the street regulation-line in accordance with the rule then still enforced in Austria–Hungary, prohibiting non-Catholic places of worship from having a public entrance from the street. The synagogue had a wider and slightly higher central nave and two narrower naves; unlike Förster's synagogue in Vienna, <b>it</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> a basilical plan.|$|E
5|$|A strong upper-level trough {{moving through}} the southeastern United States forced Danny northeastward, which also {{triggered}} the formation of another low pressure system near the coast of North Carolina early on August 29. Although this low formed within Danny's cyclonic envelope, satellite imagery indicated that <b>it</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> {{the characteristics of a}} tropical cyclone. Therefore, it is not considered to be a continuation of Danny. The new low caused the tropical storm to degenerate into a trough about 275mi (445km) southeast of Wilmington, North Carolina, and Danny's remnants were absorbed into a developing frontal zone shortly thereafter.|$|E
5|$|An {{experimental}} vaccine {{was found}} to clear the amyloid plaques in early human trials, but <b>it</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> any significant effect on dementia. Researchers have been led to suspect non-plaque Aβ oligomers (aggregates of many monomers) as the primary pathogenic form of Aβ. These toxic oligomers, {{also referred to as}} amyloid-derived diffusible ligands (ADDLs), bind to a surface receptor on neurons and change the structure of the synapse, thereby disrupting neuronal communication. One receptor for Aβ oligomers may be the prion protein, the same protein that has been linked to mad cow disease and the related human condition, Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease, thus potentially linking the underlying mechanism of these neurodegenerative disorders with that of Alzheimer's disease.|$|E

5|$|Apple {{approached}} Sony in late 1989 because <b>it</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> enough {{engineers to}} handle {{the number of new}} products that were planned for delivery in 1991. Using a basic blueprint from Apple, including a list of chips and other components, and the Portable's architecture, the 100 was miniaturized and manufactured by Sony in San Diego, California, and Japan. Sony engineers had little experience building personal computers but nonetheless completed Apple's smallest and lightest machine in under 13months, cancelling other projects and giving the PowerBook100 top priority. Sony president Norio Ohga gave project manager Kihey Yamamoto permission to recruit engineers from any Sony division.|$|E
5|$|Bamber {{told the}} court that, during his visit on 6 August, hours before the murders, he had loaded the rifle, {{thinking}} he had heard rabbits outside, but hadn't used it. He had then left it on the kitchen table, with a full magazine {{and a box of}} ammunition, before leaving the house. When he left it in the kitchen, <b>it</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> the silencer or telescopic sight attached, he said; they had been on the rifle in late July according to a nephew, but Bamber said his father must have removed them in the meantime. The prosecution disputed this, maintaining that the silencer was on the rifle when the family was murdered.|$|E
5|$|Christopher Reeve {{was cast}} as Superman, having {{initially}} failed {{to impress the}} Salkinds before bulking up. Brando meanwhile, despite spending {{less than two weeks}} on the shoot, and not even reading the script until then, earned $3.7million up front, plus 11.75% of the gross profits from the film. The film was a success both critically and commercially, being released during the Christmas season of 1978; <b>it</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> much competition, leading the producers to believe that this was one factor in the film's success.|$|E
50|$|The {{union has}} a relaxed {{jurisdiction}} over the position since <b>it</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> an official job description for a POC. It also governs another junior position in the category called Assistant Production Coordinator or APOC, but again since <b>it</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> an official job description in its bylaws, many studios are able to avoid hiring the APOC.|$|R

5|$|In {{terms of}} religion, Protestant ideas first {{appeared}} {{in the middle of the}} 16th century. During Gáspár Heltai's service as preacher, Lutheranism grew in importance, as did the Swiss doctrine of Calvinism. By 1571, the Turda (Torda) Diet had adopted a more radical religion, Ferenc Dávid's Unitarianism, characterised by the free interpretation of the Bible and denial of the dogma of the Trinity. Stephen Báthory founded a Catholic Jesuit academy in the city in order to promote an anti-Reform movement; however, <b>it</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> much success. For a year, in 1600–1601, Cluj became part of the personal union of Michael the Brave. Under the Treaty of Carlowitz in 1699, it became part of the Habsburg Monarchy.|$|E
5|$|Medstead Church of England Primary School lies {{immediately}} {{south of}} the village near the cemetery. Under the Education Act 1944, the previous site of Medstead's school was declared inadequate as <b>it</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> enough space to accommodate a playing field and assembly hall. The school was consequently relocated to a larger site {{south of the}} village, where it is today. A pre-school has been in operation since September 1989, located in {{the grounds of the}} primary school after a successful petition ensured its relocation from the village hall.|$|E
5|$|Spalding {{had been}} a port from before any of the river {{improvements}} were made. The townspeople had refused to repair the river {{during the reign of}} Henry III, as they claimed {{it was part of the}} sea here. Its importance as a port increased with the river improvements and the Stamford Canal, and although <b>it</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> a customs house, by 1695 it had various officials who acted as customs officers for goods arriving at the quays and warehouses. Exports included oats, coleseed, rape oil, hides and wool, with a much greater variety of imports, including stone, timber, coal, groceries, glass and beeswax. More exotic imports included French and Spanish wines, and some of the first imports of tea, coffee and chocolate.|$|E
