For example, a package might provide the ability to simulate the model by constructing differential equations and then perform numerical time integration on the equations to explore the model's dynamic behavior. Or, alternatively, a package might construct a discrete stochastic representation of the model and use a Monte Carlo simulation method such as the Gillespie algorithm.|$|E
25|$|After {{more than}} a decade of steady losses, the magazine's {{fortunes}} finally turned around in the 1960s when Andre Laguerre became its managing editor. A European correspondent for Time, Inc., who later became chief of the Time-Life news bureaus in Paris and London (for a time he ran both simultaneously), Laguerre attracted Henry Luce's attention in 1956 with his singular coverage of the Winter Olympic Games in Cortina d'Ampezzo, Italy, which became the core of SIs coverage of those games. In May 1956, Luce brought Laguerre to New York to become assistant managing editor of the magazine. He was named managing editor in 1960, and he more than doubled the circulation by instituting a system of departmental editors, redesigning the <b>internal</b> <b>format,</b> and inaugurating the unprecedented use in a news magazine of full-color photographic coverage of the week's sports events. He was also one of the first to sense the rise of national interest in professional football.|$|E
500|$|The original, only {{complete}} and {{most widely used}} PHP implementation is powered by the Zend Engine and known simply as PHP. To disambiguate it from other implementations, it is sometimes unofficially referred to as [...] "Zend PHP". The Zend Engine compiles PHP source code on-the-fly into an <b>internal</b> <b>format</b> that it can execute, thus it works as an interpreter. It is also the [...] "reference implementation" [...] of PHP, as PHP has no formal specification, and so the semantics of Zend PHP define the semantics of PHP itself. Due to the complex and nuanced semantics of PHP, defined by how Zend works, {{it is difficult for}} competing implementations to offer complete compatibility.|$|E

500|$|PHP's single-request-per-script-execution model, and {{the fact}} that the Zend Engine is an interpreter, leads to inefficiency; as a result, various {{products}} have been developed to help improve PHP performance. In order to speed up execution time and not have to compile the PHP source code every time the web page is accessed, PHP scripts can also be deployed in the PHP engine's <b>internal</b> <b>format</b> by using an opcode cache, which works by caching the compiled form of a PHP script (opcodes) in shared memory to avoid the overhead of parsing and compiling the code every time the script runs. [...] An opcode cache, Zend Opcache, is built into PHP since version 5.5. [...] Another example of a widely used opcode cache is the Alternative PHP Cache (APC), which is available as a PECL extension.|$|E
500|$|Meanwhile, in June 2004, Anna Vissi {{stated that}} she [...] "would go to Eurovision {{if she was}} asked to". The network kept the <b>internal</b> <b>format,</b> seeking {{high-profile}} acts. A few months later on November 27, 2004, {{it was reported that}} Despina Vandi was [...] "ready to sign the necessary contracts" [...] though nothing was officially announced by ERT. The rumored contract, brokered between Vandi's record label Heaven Music and ERT would have included a term that required all of Vandi's songs to be written by popular Greek songwriter Phoebus. The next day, November 28, 2004, ERT's Eurovision spokeswoman Daphne Bokota stated that Despina Vandi and ERT were close to a deal, but had concluded that she was too expensive to send to the contest. She also said that Vandi was worried about participating in the Eurovision Song Contest while her international career was going well. [...] "Here at ERT, we don't understand [...] Greek artists are so insecure to participate", she stated. Bokota ended by saying that they would announce the artist within the next five to ten days and that a possible backup was Helena Paparizou. Around the same time, another name, Annette Artani also became a popular rumour. The Greek-American songwriter was still participating in Fame Story at the time and rumours expected her {{to pull out of the}} competition. On December 5, 2004, Anna Vissi was reportedly also in negotiations with ERT and on December 8, 2004, Daphne Bokota once again spoke on the issue saying that there would be a delay in the decision because of some sort of [...] "obstacle" [...] within the broadcaster. On January 15, 2005, ERT held a meeting with Franz Ferdinand which was reported by Star Channel to be the front runner, but ERT soon excluded them as they had [...] "no idea how Eurovision works and thus they proposed to compose a remake of a past song of theirs", a violation of contest rules; they were also requesting more money.|$|E
2500|$|The floating-point unit (FPU) on all {{subsequent}} x86 processors have supported this format. [...] As a result software {{can be developed}} which {{takes advantage of the}} higher precision provided by this format. William Kahan, a primary designer of the x87 arithmetic and initial IEEE 754 standard proposal notes {{on the development of the}} x87 floating point: [...] "An Extended format as wide as we dared (80 bits) was included to serve the same support role as the 13-decimal <b>internal</b> <b>format</b> serves in Hewlett-Packard’s 10-decimal calculators." [...] Moreover, Kahan notes that 64 bits was the widest significand across which carry propagation could be done without increasing the cycle time on the 8087, and that the x87 extended precision was designed to be extensible to higher precision in future processors: [...] "For now the 10-byte Extended format is a tolerable compromise between the value of extra-precise arithmetic and the price of implementing it to run fast; very soon two more bytes of precision will become tolerable, and ultimately a 16-byte format... That kind of gradual evolution towards wider precision was already in view when IEEE Standard 754 for Floating-Point Arithmetic was framed." ...|$|E

2500|$|The offset is {{the index}} of the first term given. For some {{sequence}}s, the offset is obvious. For example, if we list the sequence of square numbers as 0, 1, 4, 9, 16, 25 ..., the offset is 0; while if we list it as 1, 4, 9, 16, 25 ..., the offset is 1. The default offset is 0, and most sequences in the OEIS have offset of either 0 or 1. Sequence , the magic constant for n×n magic square with prime entries (regarding 1 as a prime) with smallest row sums, {{is an example of}} a sequence with offset 3, and , [...] "Number of stars of visual magnitude n." [...] {{is an example of a}} sequence with offset -1. Sometimes there can be disagreement over what the initial terms of the sequence are, and correspondingly what the offset should be. In the case of the lazy caterer's sequence, the maximum number of pieces you can cut a pancake into with n cuts, the OEIS gives the sequence as 1, 2, 4, 7, 11, 16, 22, 29, 37, ... with offset 0, while Mathworld gives the sequence as 2, 4, 7, 11, 16, 22, 29, 37, ... (implied offset 1). It can be argued that making no cuts to the pancake is technically a number of cuts, namely n = 0. But it can also be argued that an uncut pancake is irrelevant to the problem. Although the offset is a required field, some contributors don't bother to check if the default offset of 0 is appropriate to the sequence they are sending in. The <b>internal</b> <b>format</b> actually shows two numbers for the offset. The first is the number described above, while the second represents {{the index of}} the first entry (counting from 1) that has an absolute value greater than 1. This second value is used to speed up the process of searching for a sequence. Thus , which starts 1, 1, 1, 2 with the first entry representing a(1) has 1, 4 as the internal value of the offset field.|$|E
