2500|$|Moving to Lagos, Muma Gee {{settled in}} Surulere, a {{residential}} and commercial area of that city. Shortly after, she met record producer Nelson Brown. Brown was instrumental in putting together most of the songs on Muma Gee's debut full-length. In 2006, the album, entitled Kade was released as a CD to music stores. Muma Gee had explained the meaning of its title in an interview, [...] "it is a courageous word that gives hope. <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> <b>so</b> much in empowerment. So Kade represents advocacy and empowerment towards nation building [...] For example, in my language, we say Kade, meaning go, but its typical meaning is keep moving on and you will get there someday." ...|$|E
2500|$|By {{the end of}} 2007, {{she began}} hinting that {{she was working on}} new {{material}} for her next album. The following year, on 18 May 2008, it was announced that [...] "Amebo" [...] would be the first single to be released from the album. According to Muma Gee, this song was what she had long desired to create: [...] "I have been doing my own thing. I've been experimenting even while at the University of Port Harcourt. Now, I want to see what I can achieve professionally." [...] Explaining what [...] "Amebo" [...] was specifically about, she says, [...] "I am a homegirl, I am an indigenous musician. <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> <b>so</b> much in Nigeria. So, [...] "Amebo" [...] simply talks about our people, our values, and our heritage." [...] On 25 May, Muma Gee premiered the song at an exclusive night party in Ikoyi. Other roles she played at the event included meeting fans, and signing autographs. [...] "Amebo" [...] was sent to radio afterwards; Muma Gee also spoke briefly about the new album's content and direction, saying, [...] "I figured out that there are lots of love songs in the album. Maybe I am learning the rules to falling in love. (Laughs) and it's finding interest in my songwriting, maybe, maybe not, well I am not sure." ...|$|E

5000|$|Based on {{my present}} {{knowledge}} I can see today clearly, severely and bitterly for me, {{that the entire}} ideology about {{the world in which}} <b>I</b> <b>believed</b> <b>so</b> firmly and unswervingly was based on completely wrong premises and had to absolutely collapse one day. And so my actions in the service of this ideology were completely wrong, even though <b>I</b> faithfully <b>believed</b> the idea was correct. Now it was very logical that strong doubts grew within me, and whether my turning away from my belief in God was based on completely wrong premises. It was a hard struggle. But I have again found my faith in my God.|$|R

40|$|Abstract: In this journal, Hamid Vahid argues against three {{families}} of explanation of Mooreparadoxicality. The {{first is the}} Wittgensteinian approach; I assert that p just in case I assert that <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> that p. <b>So</b> making a Moore-paradoxical assertion involves contradictory assertions. The second is the epistemic approach, one committed to: if I am justified in believing that p then I am justified in <b>believing</b> that <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> that p. <b>So</b> {{it is impossible to}} have a justified omissive Mooreparadoxical belief. The third is the conscious belief approach, being committed to: if <b>I</b> consciously <b>believe</b> that p then <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> that <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> that p. <b>So</b> if I have a conscious omissive Moore-paradoxical belief, then I have contradictory second-order beliefs. In their place, Vahid argues for the defectiveinterpretation approach, broadly that charity requires us to discount the utterer of a Mooreparadoxical sentence as a speaker. I agree that the Wittgensteinian approach is unsatisfactory. But so is the defective-interpretation approach. However, there is a satisfactory version of each of the epistemic and conscious-belief approaches...|$|R
