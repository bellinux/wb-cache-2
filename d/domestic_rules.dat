In Owusu, the English Court of Appeal asked the ECJ whether it could stay a matter brought to it under Article 2 Brussels Convention pursuant to the English FNC rules. The Court held that the Brussels Convention was a mandatory set of rules designed to harmonise and so produce a predictable system throughout the EU. If states were able to derogate from the Convention using their <b>domestic</b> <b>rules</b> of civil procedure, this would deny a uniform result to proceedings based on forum selection.

5000|$|Once {{the two are}} wed, Usha {{is shocked}} to find Keshav {{continuing}} to act as her “business manager”, (After effects) arranging starring roles for her opposite heartthrob Rajan (Anant Nag), who is himself in (unrequited) love with her. Since Keshav's other business ventures are unsuccessful, the family remains entirely dependent on Usha's earnings - a fact that Keshav clearly resents. He thus becomes both a jealous husband with a fragile ego and nasty temper, as well as (in effect) a greedy pimp who compels his wife to take risqué work despite her dislike of her co-star and her protests that she [...] "only {{wants to be a}} housewife" [...] now that their daughter has been born. Not surprisingly, the relationship becomes increasingly poisoned, particularly by Keshav's suspicion (fed by star-magazine gossip) that she is having an affair with Rajan. Verbally and physically abused by her husband and periodically obliged to live in a hotel, separated from her daughter and mother, the desperately unhappy actress eventually does instigate two unsatisfying liaisons: with the nihilistic and self-centered director Sunil Verma (Naseeruddin Shah), with whom she plots a double-suicide (which he foils), and then with the wealthy businessman Vinayak Kale (Amrish Puri), who keeps her as a pampered mistress on his palatial estate. Here Usha briefly finds a kind of [...] "respectability" [...] as a de facto second wife, earning a measure of love and admiration from Kale's mother, son, and bedridden first wife —but (as she learns one day when she tries to take the boy to a nearby fair) at the cost of even the most rudimentary freedom.

40|$|The aim of {{the thesis}} was to {{critically}} compare termination of contracts in South Africa, England and the CISG. It was found out that South Africa prefers {{to use the term}} cancellation because it is a remedy of last resort. The problem with cancellation is that is a drastic step of bringing the transaction to an abrupt and premature end, which is only used when a material breach occurs. English law uses the term discharge as it refers to the ending of the obligations under the contract when a breach occurred and represents the point at which one party is no longer bound by its’ contractual obligations and claims damages. Chapter 3 argued that though discharge goes beyond cancellation it does not cater for diverse <b>domestic</b> <b>rules</b> which need uniform international laws. Chapter 4 discussed and argued that avoidance is a term that was chosen by the CISG to end a contract when a fundamental breach occurs. There were problems on interpretation of terms and use of diverse <b>domestic</b> <b>rules.</b> The advantage of the term avoidance {{is that it is a}} technical term adopted and given a uniform meaning in the CISG where interpretation of terms and diverse <b>domestic</b> <b>rules</b> did not apply.
