40|$|Motivated by {{the need}} for less {{destructive}} imaging of nanostructures, we pursue point-source in-line holography (also known as point projection microscopy, or PPM) with very low energy electrons (- 100 eV). This technique exploits the recent creation of ultrasharp and robust nanotips, which can field emit electrons from a single atom at their apex, thus creating a path to an extremely coherent source of <b>electrons</b> for <b>holography.</b> Our method {{has the potential to}} achieve atom resolved images of nanostructures including biological molecules. We demonstrate a further advantage of PPM emerging {{from the fact that the}} very low energy electrons employed experience a large elastic scattering cross section relative to many-keV electrons. Moreover, the variation of scattering factors as a function of atom type allows for enhanced elemental contrast. Low energy electrons arguably offer the further advantage of causing minimum damage to most materials. Model results for small molecules and adatoms on graphene substrates, where very small damage is expected, indicate that a phase contrast is obtainable between elements with significantly different Z-numbers. For example, for typical setup parameters, atoms such as C and P are discernible, while C and N are not. Comment: 15 pages, 5 figure...|$|R
40|$|Progress in ultrafast {{electron}} microscopy {{relies on the}} development of efficient laser-driven electron sources delivering femtosecond electron pulses to the sample. In particular, recent advances employ photoemission from metal nanotips as coherent point-like femtosecond low-energy electron sources. We report the nonlinear emission of ultrashort electron wave packets from a gold nanotip generated by nonlocal excitation and nanofocusing of surface plasmon polaritons. We verify the nanoscale localization of plasmon-induced electron emission by its electrostatic collimation characteristics. With a plasmon polariton pulse duration below 8 fs at the apex, we identify multiphoton photoemission as the underlying emission process. The quantum efficiency of the plasmon-induced emission exceeds that of photoemission from direct apex illumination. We demonstrate the application for plasmon-triggered point-projection imaging of an individual semiconductor nanowire at 3 μm tip-sample distance. Based on numerical simulations we estimate an electron pulse duration at the sample below 10 fs for tip-sample distances up to few micrometers. Plasmon-driven nanolocalized electron emission thus enables femtosecond point-projection microscopy with unprecedented temporal and spatial resolution, femtosecond low-energy <b>electron</b> in-line <b>holography,</b> and opens a new route towards femtosecond scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy.

40|$|In <b>electron</b> {{emission}} <b>holography,</b> {{the sources}} are electron emitting atoms. The primary (unscattered) electron wave {{interferes with the}} waves scattered elastically by nearby atoms resulting in a holographic fringe pattern in the angular distribution of the emitted electrons. In cases that the neighboring atoms have non-zero spins the scattered electron wave depends on the spin of the scattering atom by virtue of exchange scattering and the holographic fringes are spin dependent. This {{is the basis of}} the holographic spin imaging technique that we propose and discuss in this thesis, and which, we believe, will become a very powerful method for determining the short range spin environment of the electron source atoms in surface magnetism studies. We show that the "vector hologram" obtained by measuring the spin of the emitted electrons, S(scR), can be inverted to give a three-dimensional image of the magnetic environment of the electron emitting source atom. Of greater practical and theoretical interest, we show that the same information can be obtained from photoelectron intensity patterns, I(scR), ("scalar" spin holography) produced with incident linearly polarized photons. This surprising result is very important since it brings spin holography well within the realms of present day experimental capabilities available at synchrotron sources. In addition, we develop the theory for the related spin dependent EXAFS experiments, and show that the SPEXAFS data can be analyzed to yield much more information than previously realized. In particular, the SPEXAFS technique can be used for the study of antiferromagnetic spin arrangements, as well as ferromagnetic ones...|$|R
40|$|It {{is now a}} {{well-known}} fact that the phase of electron waves is altered by external magnetic fields via the Aharonov 2 ̆ 013 Bohm effect.

In this study we examine the distortion effects of external (constant and variable) magnetic fields on <b>electron</b> interference and <b>holography.</b> For digital holography, the reconstruction of the object is done via numerical calculations and this leaves the door open for correcting phase distortions in the hologram reconstruction. We design and quantitatively assess such correction schemes, which decidedly depend on our knowledge of the magnetic field values in the holographic recording process. For constant fields of known value we are able to correct for magnetic distortions to a great extent. We find that variable fields are more destructive to the holographic process than constant fields. We define two criteria, related respectively to global and local contrast of the hologram to establish the maximum allowed external field which does not significantly hinder the accuracy of in-line holographic microscopy with electrons.

40|$|We {{address the}} problem of reconstructing a sparse signal from its DFT magnitude. We refer to this problem as the sparse phase {{retrieval}} (SPR) problem, which finds applications in tomography, digital <b>holography,</b> <b>electron</b> microscopy, etc. We develop a Fienup-type iterative algorithm, referred to as the Max-K algorithm, to enforce sparsity and successively refine the estimate of phase. We show that the Max-K algorithm possesses Cauchy convergence properties under certain conditions, that is, the MSE of reconstruction does not increase with iterations. We also formulate the problem of SPR as a feasibility problem, where the goal is to find a signal that is sparse in a known basis and whose Fourier transform magnitude is consistent with the measurement. Subsequently, we interpret the Max-K algorithm as alternating projections onto the object-domain and measurement-domain constraint sets and generalize it to a parameterized relaxation, known as the relaxed averaged alternating reflections (RAAR) algorithm. On the application front, we work with measurements acquired using a frequency-domain optical-coherence tomography (FDOCT) experimental setup. Experimental results on measured data show that the proposed algorithms exhibit good reconstruction performance compared with the direct inversion technique, homomorphic technique, and the classical Fienup algorithm without sparsity constraint; specifically, the autocorrelation artifacts and background noise are suppressed to a significant extent. We also demonstrate that the RAAR algorithm offers a broader framework for FDOCT reconstruction, of which the direct inversion technique and the proposed Max-K algorithm become special instances corresponding to specific values of the relaxation parameter...|$|R

When induced by an intense laser field, electron tunnelling from atoms and molecules initiates a broad range of phenomena such as the generation of attosecond pulses, laser-induced <b>electron</b> diffraction and <b>holography.</b> These processes evolve on the attosecond timescale (12 ̆ 009 attosecond 2 ̆ 0092 ̆ 2612 ̆ 00912 ̆ 009 as = 102 ̆ 212 ^ 182 ̆ 009 seconds) and are well suited to the investigation of a general issue much debated since the early days of quantum mechanics 5, 6, 72 ̆ 014 the link between the tunnelling of an electron through a barrier and its dynamics outside the barrier.

We show that this approach allows us to measure the time at which the electron exits from the tunnelling barrier. We demonstrate the high sensitivity of the measurement by detecting subtle delays in ionization times from two orbitals of a carbon dioxide molecule.

30|$|Much of {{this new}} {{research}} has been brought on by advances in segmented detectors, and more recently in high-speed pixelated detectors. For segmented detectors, instead of using a standard circular or annular geometry, the detector is broken up {{into a series of}} adjacent segments that have been divided into quadrants [15]. A limited number of segments allow for fast efficient acquisitions and real-time atomic-resolution DPC imaging [13, 16, 17]. Alternatively, in the case of pixelated detectors, the detector segments are arranged into a Cartesian grid. With a pixelated detector, fully four-dimensional (4 D) datasets can be acquired, where for each spatial position of the electron probe a two-dimensional (2 D) image of the diffraction plane (a Ronchigram) is recorded [18 – 20]. The 4 D datasets acquired with pixelated detectors can be used to measure the aberration-function of the probe [21], improve efficiency in DPC imaging [22], and more importantly, they can be used to retrieve and separate the phase of the electron probe and the sample via <b>electron</b> ptychography and <b>holography</b> [23 – 26]. Moreover, by acquiring the entire CBED pattern for each probe position, pixelated detectors inherently function as universal detectors because different types of STEM images [e.g., bright field (BF), annular bright field (ABF), and annular dark field (ADF)] can be reconstructed directly from a single 4 D dataset [27]. While previous studies demonstrate the potential of probing internal electric fields in materials together with structure and chemistry at atomic resolution, the limit of spatial resolution accessible by DPC electric field mapping has not been evaluated. Achieving DPC with high spatial resolution is especially important to the studies of quantum materials where coupling behavior often occurs at an extremely small length scale.|$|R
