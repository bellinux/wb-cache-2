40|$|This study {{sought to}} {{investigate}} the influence on the operational effectiveness of experienced <b>Large</b> <b>Goods</b> <b>Vehicle</b> drivers undertaking National Vocational Qualifications {{and the role of}} Further Education in the delivery of vocational qualifications to experienced practitioners. With the exception of studies conducted on behalf of Skills for Logistics (Grey, 2005; Winters, 2007, 2010) there was little research, which was openly available, that examined the deployment of National Vocational Qualifications to <b>Large</b> <b>Goods</b> <b>Vehicle</b> drivers. The specific focus of this research was concerning the effectiveness of work-based competency assessment NVQ programmes delivered to <b>Large</b> <b>Goods</b> <b>Vehicle</b> drivers working within the Road Freight sector of the logistics industry. Using an interpretive, qualitative based study and drawing on an Action Research approach, I analysed interview and observational data gathered during three Action Research cycles, undertaken over an eighteen month period. During the Action Research cycles, participant reflection was used as a key change mechanism. The research findings indicated a low level of satisfaction with regard to the objectives and outcomes of the National Vocational Qualifications programme for <b>Large</b> <b>Goods</b> <b>Vehicle</b> drivers and an unwillingness by the research participants to engage in overt reflective activity. There was very little credibility afforded to the National Vocational Qualifications by either the participating <b>Large</b> <b>Goods</b> <b>Vehicle</b> Drivers or their Managers. However, following the inclusion of an additional 'demand led' element into the programme, there was further evidence to demonstrate that as experienced practitioners the <b>Large</b> <b>Goods</b> <b>Vehicle</b> drivers did value professional development predicated upon the validity and credibility of the provision available. The key findings from the study provide evidence for concluding that professional development is valued by experienced <b>Large</b> <b>Goods</b> <b>Vehicle</b> drivers, who are both willing and able to engage with work-based learning if it is within the context of their experience, aspirations and praxis...|$|R
