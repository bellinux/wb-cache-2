5|$|After {{eight other}} {{publishers}} had rejected Philosopher's Stone, Bloomsbury offered Rowling a £2,500 advance for its publication. Despite Rowling's statement {{that she did}} not have any particular age group in mind when beginning to write the Harry Potter books, the publishers initially targeted children aged nine to eleven. On the eve of publishing, Rowling was asked by her publishers to adopt a more gender-neutral pen name in order to appeal to the male members of this age group, fearing {{that they would not be}} interested in reading a novel they <b>knew</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> written by a woman. She elected to use J. K. Rowling (Joanne Kathleen Rowling), using her grandmother's name as her second name because she has no middle name.|$|E
5|$|In his {{commentary}} on the ancient Confucian philosopher Mencius (372–289 BC), Shen wrote {{of the importance of}} choosing to follow what one <b>knew</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a true path, yet the heart and mind could not attain full knowledge of truth through mere sensory experience. In his own unique way but using terms influenced by the ideas of Mencius, Shen wrote of an autonomous inner authority that formed the basis for one's inclination towards moral choices, a concept linked to Shen's life experiences of surviving and obtaining success through self-reliance. Along with his {{commentary on}} the Chinese classic texts, Shen Kuo also wrote extensively on the topics of supernatural divination and Buddhist meditation.|$|E
5|$|Elsewhere, the Trafalgar {{campaign}} {{reached its}} climax on 21 October 1805, when Villeneuve's fleet was intercepted at sea off Cadiz by Nelson's fleet and destroyed at the Battle of Trafalgar, the French and Spanish losing 17 out of 30 ships of the line. The British fleet {{did not lose}} a single ship, {{but the cost of}} the victory was severe: Lord Nelson, victor of four major battles in the previous eight years, had been killed {{at the height of the}} combat by a musket ball. The survivors of the combined fleet scattered, most making their way back to Cadiz. However, the four ships of the French vanguard, which had rapidly outdistanced the battle and not returned, escaped towards the Bay of Biscay under Contre-Admiral Pierre Dumanoir le Pelley. Allemand's cruise was to have unforeseen consequences for Dumanoir's squadron: among the British forces mustered to hunt for the ships from Rochefort was a squadron under Rear-Admiral Sir Richard Strachan in , consisting of five ships of the line and two frigates. On 2 November, the frigate HMS Phoenix, which had also been ordered to search for signs of Allemand, discovered four French ships near Cape Finisterre. Unaware of the events of Trafalgar and assuming these ships to be a part of Allemand's force, Captain Dundas sought to lure them towards Strachan's squadron, which he <b>knew</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> in the area. Dundas was successful in provoking Dumanoir to chase his frigate, and two days later, on 4 February, Strachan was able to bring the French squadron to battle, capturing all four ships at the Battle of Cape Ortegal.|$|E

25|$|The Kyrö Distillery Company was {{registered}} as Rye Rye Oy by Miika Lipiäinen, Mikko Koskinen, Kalle Valkonen, Miko Heinilä and Jouni Ritola on 29 August 2012 in Isokyrö, Finland. The idea {{to establish the}} company came to the founders in a sauna while wondering the lack of whisky distilleries based on rye in Finland—an ingredient they considered vital to Finnish society. The distillery itself was built next to the River Kyrö in a 1908 built cheese factory used to produce Finnish Oltermanni cheese—that Heinilä <b>knew</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> vacant at the time.|$|E
25|$|Raja Petra later distanced {{himself from}} the {{statutory}} declaration {{in an interview with}} TV3, saying his accusations linking Najib and Rosmah to the murder was repeating information passed onto him by opposition figures, rather than information he <b>knew</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> true himself. He stated that he did not genuinely believe that Rosmah was at the murder scene. The Malaysian Civil Liberties Movement alleged the interview was heavily edited and spin doctored in favour of Prime Minister Najib Razak {{just in time for the}} upcoming Sarawak state elections. Raja Petra has backed up this assertion during an interview with Malaysiakini.|$|E
25|$|In 1812 he {{was sitting}} in his rooms in the Analytical Society looking at a table of logarithms, which he <b>knew</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> full of mistakes, when the idea {{occurred}} to him of computing all tabular functions by machinery. The French government had produced several tables by a new method. Three or four of their mathematicians decided how to compute the tables, half a dozen more broke down the operations into simple stages, and the work itself, which was restricted to addition and subtraction, was done by eighty computers who knew only these two arithmetical processes. Here, for the first time, mass production was applied to arithmetic, and Babbage was seized by the idea that the labours of the unskilled computers could be taken over completely by machinery which would be quicker and more reliable.|$|E

25|$|The vehicle {{identification}} number (VIN) plate, a unique serial number used to identify individual motor vehicles, {{had been removed from}} the car's dashboard and the door VIN sticker, but police retrieved the VIN from the bottom of its engine block. The investigators traced the SUV's last registered owner, and the female college student who sold the suspect the Pathfinder. Law enforcement officials recovered the suspect's pre-paid disposable cell phone's number from the cell phone of the seller, and ran it through a number of databases. They determined that the disposable phone had been used for calls to and from a Pakistani telephone number which they <b>knew</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> associated with Faisal Shahzad. The phone had also been used to call a fireworks store in rural Pennsylvania. They collected his e-mail address from an email which he sent to the seller’s computer.|$|E

But the year is over, and Seishirō declares himself the winner of the bet. He breaks Subaru's arm and tortures him, but does not succeed in killing him, as Subaru's grandmother breaks his spell - an action which leaves her crippled. Subaru's shock and heartbreak leave him catatonic. Hokuto, feeling guilty for her promotion of Seishirō, whom she <b>knew</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> dangerous, but also believed to be the only one who might touch Subaru's heart, leaves to find Seishirō and confronts him, asking to be killed by him and casting a spell with her death. Subaru, seeing her in a dream, is shocked out of his catatonia by her action. He vows to find Seishirō and take revenge for his sister's death.|$|E
25|$|In 2008, Maria Teresa Marabini Moevs {{argued in}} an article for Bollettino d'Arte that the Warren Cup is not in fact a Roman product of the early Imperial period, but rather was {{executed}} around 1900 by a gifted silversmith trained in the contemporary Liberty style, perhaps commissioned by the amateur archaeologist and dealer Fausto Benedetti (1874–1931), to meet what he <b>knew</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> the taste of his foreign client and friend Edward Perry Warren. Benedetti may have worked {{in collaboration with the}} Castellani brothers of Rome, who were leading goldsmiths in classical styles, and collectors and dealers in antiquities. Moevs, an authority on Roman pottery, claims that the images on the cup derive from fragments of several scenes on Greek and Roman ceramics, including some in the Castellani collection, which were combined and modified to create the scenes on the Warren cup. An appendix to that article by silversmith Claudio Franchi provides corroborating technical evidence.|$|E

25|$|Baker {{resumed his}} {{service in the}} Bay of Biscay, and on 2 November he was {{discovered}} off Cape Finisterre by four French ships of the line under Pierre Dumanoir le Pelley, that had escaped from {{the destruction of the}} Franco-Spanish fleet at Trafalgar two weeks previously. They chased the Phoenix southwards, with Baker trying to lure them towards a British squadron he <b>knew</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> in the area, under Captain Sir Richard Strachan. He made contact with Strachan's forces later that day, and was sent by Strachan to round {{up the rest of the}} scattered squadron while Strachan took the bulk of his force in pursuit. The British eventually closed on the fleeing French on 4 November, whereupon Phoenix joined the other frigates in harassing the French, until Strachan could bring his larger ships in action. The frigates then attacked one side of the French line, with the ships of the line engaging the other, until the French were forced to surrender. The Phoenix was one of the ships taking possession of Scipion.|$|E

Hastings said that [...] "if my client... was guilty of a criminal offence, there is not a single accountant in the City of London or in the world who is not in the same position." [...] Both Kylsant and Morland were acquitted of falsifying records on this account, but Kylsant was found guilty of [...] "making, circulating or publishing a written statement which he <b>knew</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> false", namely the 1928 prospectus, and was sentenced to 12 months in prison.|$|E
