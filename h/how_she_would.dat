25|$|While Hatshepsut was {{depicted}} in official art wearing regalia of a pharaoh, {{such as the}} false beard that male pharaohs also wore, it is most unlikely that she ever wore such ceremonial decorations, {{just as it is}} unlikely that the male pharaohs did. Statues such as those at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, depicting her seated wearing a tight-fitting dress and the nemes crown, are thought to be a more accurate representation of <b>how</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> have presented herself at court.|$|E

After thinking to herself {{he looks like a}} Prince, she tries to kiss him, thinking it will wake him up, just like a kiss wakes up Sleeping Beauty. He does wake but only to fall back asleep again. Kilala then carries him inside her house and watches over him sleeping as she wonders who he is and where he came from. As she's folding his coat, a small tiara falls out, which she tries on. To her surprise, she feels just like one of the Disney Princesses. Then, Rei wakes up and accuses her of stealing the tiara. She calls him the Thief instead, questioning <b>how</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> know if he didn't steal it first. Rei's servant, Valdou, runs in and unintentionally breaks up the fight.|$|E

Sojourner recounts how her mother told her to pray to God {{that she may have}} good masters and mistresses. She goes on to retell how her masters were not good to her, about how she was whipped for not understanding English, and <b>how</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> question God why he had not made her masters be good to her. Sojourner admits to the audience that she had once hated white people, but she says once she met her final master, Jesus, she was filled with love for everyone. Once enslaved folks were emancipated, she tells the crowd she knew her prayers had been answered.|$|E

Madonna had already enlisted the help of composers Tim Rice and Andrew Lloyd Webber, who had originally created Evita the musical.

500|$|The film's title {{came from}} the song [...] "Naan Paadum Mouna Ragam", from Ratnam's Idaya Kovil (1985). Although he began work on the script while making Pallavi Anu Pallavi, Mouna Ragam did not begin {{production}} until after Idaya Kovil release. Ratnam said that due to budgetary constraints {{it would have been}} easier to send the female lead to Bangalore instead of Delhi, but he did not want her to be able to easily return to her parents because she could not adjust to her husband. The line [...] "Neenga thottaa kambilipoochi oorraa madhri irukku", spoken by Divya to Chandrakumar, expressed <b>how</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> feel on her wedding night.|$|E

500|$|I had two {{ideas that}} did not fit the song. She said no even though I had a very clear idea of <b>how</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> look in the video.

[...] "Tears to Snow" [...] is an emotional song about him and his ex-girlfriend having relationship issues and breaking up. In the song he explains <b>how</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> assume he would cheat on her. The second verse is also partly about how Hopsin's former colleagues have changed and turned against him.

500|$|Throughout the novel, Little Bee {{considers}} <b>how</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> explain England to [...] "the girls back home" [...] in Nigeria. Cleave {{uses the}} girls as a Greek chorus, providing a foil {{to allow the}} cultural dissonance experienced by Little Bee to be made explicit. He feels the device is more natural than having Little Bee narrate her alarm first hand, allowing the reader to appreciate the cultural gulf, and Little Bee to seem knowing as opposed to tragic. Through Little Bee's narration, Cleave examines human culture from the opposite perspective as science fiction does, having an extraordinary protagonist explore an ordinary world. This contemporary realism gives a significance to mundane events experienced by Little Bee, while bringing into focus [...] "sad and ignoble" [...] aspects of English culture such as the detention system. Cleave commented: [...] "We have become accustomed to viewing our own actions in soft focus, but the alien narrator has not yet acquired this cultural immunity. She sees us as {{we can no longer}} see ourselves." ...|$|E
