40|$|The SRC gene is the {{prototype}} {{for a family}} of closely related genes whose products have protein-tyrosine kinase activity. We recently described another member of this family, designated FYN, whose cDNA was isolated from normal human fibroblasts. To examine the possible role of FYN as an oncogene, we investigated the effects of FYN overexpression on NIH 3 T 3 cells. Our findings demonstrate that normal FYN overexpression induces morphologic transformation and anchorage-independent growth. In addition, at relatively low frequency, FYN acquired properties of a <b>dominant-acting</b> <b>oncogene</b> capable of inducing the fully tumorigenic phenotype. Genetic changes associated with the conversion of normal FYN cDNA into a transforming gene with high focus-forming activity were localized to the carboxyl-terminal region of its translational product...|$|E
40|$|Numerous {{studies have}} implicated various roles in {{carcinogenesis}} for <b>dominant-acting</b> <b>oncogenes,</b> activated by mutation, chromosomal rearrangement, insertion {{of a nearby}} promoter element, or gene amplification [1 - 5]. Other studies have indi-cated that tumorigenicity behaves as a recessive trait, in that dominant elements (suppressor genes) must first be inactivated (e. g., by gene or chromosomal deletion, rearrangement or mutation) {{in order for a}} cell to become neoplastic (6 - 8). Presum-ably, normal progenitor cells would require a specific series ofgene activations and/or inactivations to complete the transformation process. Moreover, depending upon the tumor type and the differentiation program of the cell, it is likely that this series of changes would differ. The determination of a contributing role for oncogenes in the sequence of steps required for malignant transformation would require, there-fore, an ability to directly test the effects of oncogenes on normal differentiated diploid progenitor cells ofa particular tumor type (9). Human renal cells provide a suitable system for examining the temporal sequence of oncogene-related effects for several reasons. First, cells from both renal cancers and normal human kidney can be cul...|$|R
