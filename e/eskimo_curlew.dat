A colony of approximately 3000 lesser snow geese have been identified at KIBS, as well as nationally significant numbers of Hudsonian godwit and whimbrel. The short-eared owl, a Species at Risk Act-listed bird, has been records at KIBS, as well as grizzly bear, polar bear and wolverine, which are listed species by Canada's Committee on the Status of Endangered Wildlife, and the highly endangered <b>Eskimo</b> <b>curlew.</b> The Lapland longspur appears to be avoiding the KIBS because of seismic lines and drilling pads brought on by natural gas exploration.|$|E
50|$|Through the 1860s, Dresser {{travelled}} widely through Europe and {{was twice}} in New Brunswick at his father's sawmill. He sought out ornithologists {{with whom he}} could exchange birds and eggs. In 1863, during the American Civil War, he travelled to Texas via the Rio Grande on behalf of Liverpool and Manchester businessmen, taking a cargo of blankets, quinine and other goods in short supply to be sold and purchased raw cotton with the proceeds. During his time in Texas from June 1863- July 1864 Dresser made a collection of around 400 bird skins from southern Texas. His notes from his time in Texas, published in The Ibis (1865-66) are a leading source of information for the period and include mention of several interesting birds including the extinct (or almost extinct) ivory-billed woodpecker, the almost extinct <b>Eskimo</b> <b>curlew</b> and the endangered whooping crane.|$|E
5000|$|At one time, the <b>Eskimo</b> <b>curlew</b> {{may have}} been one of the most {{numerous}} shorebirds in North America, with a population in the millions. As many as 2 million birds per year were killed near the end of the nineteenth century.

There was a reliable report of 23 birds in Texas in 1981, and more recent additional unconfirmed reports from Texas, Canada (1987), Argentina (1990), and Nova Scotia (2006). No confirmed record of this species has been reported in South America since 1939. It has been suggested that the species not be treated as extinct until all possible remaining habitats have been surveyed and incidental sightings have ceased, and an assessment of critically endangered (possibly extinct) be adopted in the meantime.

40|$|As species {{become very}} rare and {{approach}} extinction, purported sightings can stir controversy, especially when scarce management resources are at stake. We used quantitative methods to identify reports {{that do not}} fit prior sighting patterns. We also {{examined the effects of}} including records that meet different evidentiary standards on quantitative extinction assessments for four charismatic bird species that might be extinct: <b>Eskimo</b> <b>Curlew</b> (Numenius borealis), Ivory-billed Woodpecker (Campephilus principalis), NukupÃ¹u (Hemignathus lucidus), and Ã�ahu Ì�Alauahio (Paroreomyza maculata). For all four species the probability of there being a valid sighting today, given the past pattern of verified sightings, was estimated to be very low. The estimates of extinction dates and the chance of new sightings, however, differed considerably depending on the criteria used for data inclusion. When a historical sighting record lacked long periods without sightings, the likelihood of new sightings declined quickly with time since the last confirmed sighting. For species with this type of historical record, therefore, new reports should meet an especially high burden of proof to be acceptable. Such quantitative models could be incorporated into the International Union for Conservation of Nature's Red List criteria to set evidentiary standards required for unconfirmed sightings of "possibly extinct" species and to standardize extinction assessments across species.

40|$|After {{a period}} of limited optimism, ornithologists are again {{in a state of}} {{uncertainty}} and doubt as to the existence of the elusive <b>Eskimo</b> <b>Curlew.</b> In spite of the ever increasing activities of bird watchers, no sightings have been reported from the Texas coast in the last decade, and the present status of this ill-fated bird is impossible to judge. Most of the persons who have summarized its sad story {{have come to the conclusion}} that uncontrolled hunting, particularly spring hunting in the Great Plains, was the single most important factor in its demise. Richard C. Banks of the U. S. National Museum has recently reviewed the history of the species’ decline, and although he agrees that hunter overkill was doubtless an important factor, he suggests it may not have been the only one. Several climatic factors, including an increase in fall storms along the North Atlantic coast and possibly lowered reproductive success on arctic nesting grounds in the late 1880 s during {{a period of}} unusually cool summers, could also have contributed to increased mortality and lowered reproductive rates. These speculations are interesting but inconclusive, and we are left in doubt about what, if anything, can be done to protect and preserve a species that at best seems nearly mythical and at worst may already be extinct...|$|E
40|$|Given {{the current}} {{increase}} in global extinction risk of species, methods that {{are able to}} estimate the probability and the time of extinction based on a sighting record of a rare or poorly studied species are becoming increasingly important. One of the major obstacles when using such methods is that many sighting records are burdened with uncertain or controversial observations. What is accepted as a valid sighting can have a substantial effect on resulting predictions. Here we present a simple modification to an existing method that allows for the inclusion of specific sighting reliabilities of individual observations into predictions of the likelihood and the time of extinction. The approach is applied to the sighting records of four presumably extinct bird species. Results indicated that the Ivory-billed Woodpecker (Campephilus principalis) and the <b>Eskimo</b> <b>Curlew</b> (Numenius borealis) may be considered as extinct, even when recent controversial sightings are included in the analysis. The Nukupu`u (Hemignathus lucidus) and O`ahu `Alauahio (Paroreomyza maculata) could potentially still be extant, although with a low probability of persistence. The major advantage of the presented method is that, instead of applying some arbitrary threshold for the sighting reliability that is considered acceptable, it recognizes and incorporates the reliability of each observation into the resulting predictions, by estimating the most likely number of observations and the most likely time of the last observation. Its simplicity facilitates its application for assessments of a larger number species or populations, and makes it accessible as a decision tool...|$|E
40|$|Shorebirds {{have always}} {{relied on the}} {{extensive}} network of natural wetlands from Texas to North Dakota. This network has now been fractured by wetland drainage and agriculture {{to the point where}} suitable wetlands are absent in much of the Midwest. Habitat loss and the resulting risk of population decline highlight the importance of management of shorebirds on refuges, hunting clubs, and preserves for both breeding and migrating species. Because shorebirds, like waterfowl, depend on wetlands throughout the year, the loss of natural wetlands in the Midwest poses a real threat. Unfortunately, shorebirds are slow to recover from population declines caused by human disturbance; for example, the <b>Eskimo</b> <b>curlew</b> has never recovered from being over-hunted {{at the turn of the}} century. Many species, particularly those that nest in the lower 48 states, have declined in this century because of habitat loss. Arctic nesting species are relatively safe in remote breeding grounds, but are vulnerable to degradation of habitats critical to migration through the Midwest. This chapter provides guidance for wetland managers in midwestern states for attracting migrating and breeding shorebirds. These suggestions will benefit most of the 40 species that migrate or breed in 12 states of the mid-continent region: Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, Nebraska, North Dakota, Ohio, South Dakota, and Wisconsin (Table). Emphasis is on migrating species because they can benefit the most from the kind of managed wetland habitat usually available on mid-continent refuges. The unique value of managed wetlands is their capacity to buffer the effects of both drought and flooding in surrounding wetland habitat...|$|E

R. Robin Baker, Reader in Zoology at the University of Manchester, is a noted authority on avian navigation. The word 2 ̆ 2 solution 2 ̆ 2 {{in the title}} of this book is somewhat misleading because this book does not solve the mystery of how birds navigate. However, this book is the most thorough, up-to-date review of the various theories on how birds navigate, and integrates these theories to give the reader an idea of how birds might really navigate. The author does an excellent job of presenting all the different ideas in an easily understood and easy to read style. Discussions of each theory include some of the history behind the research, how each theory fits with other theories, how each theory might work on short and long distance movements, and what research needs to be conducted in the future to help clarify how birds navigate. The book explains how birds might navigate under one set of conditions and switch to another navigation technique when conditions change. A fascinating topic presented in a very readable manner.
