40|$|In the Framework of an {{alarming}} rising of international illegality, several States argue that immigration or the <b>irregular</b> <b>stay</b> {{to carry out}} limitations or clear abolition {{in regard to the}} exercise of rights. The question is How we build the parameters to make a difference between which in certain cases constitutes, or not, discrimination. In other words, when the fact of being national or alien can be a valid —in terms of law, as not prohibited— reason, or «the» ground, of a public policy that exclude or restrict in some manner the protection and enjoyment of the rights, and if so, relating which rights in particular. After a short tour over the three principal elements that came into play (State, immigration, human rights), this work delimits an attempted catalogue of certain rights do arguable to determine, to their respect, in which extension the circumstance of being foreigner or illegal immigrant can be held up legal measures to protect public security, rights of citizens or public order, for exampl...|$|E
40|$|The {{pressure}} on EU countries to increase migrant returns has been incessant. The first milestone {{in this process}} was the 2010 enactment of the Return Directive, and the second occurred in May 2015 when a return policy {{was included in the}} European Agenda on Migration. In practice, such return policies are often driven by the belief that they will act as a deterrent for migrants contemplating <b>irregular</b> <b>stays.</b> But what they may actually translate into is deportation at all costs, including at the expense of migrants’ human rights. This article raises this issue by looking at the case study of deportations by the Swedish state...|$|R
40|$|In {{the last}} decades, {{immigration}} from {{developing countries and}} central-east Europe to Italy is continuously growing. This trend represents {{an important element of}} novelty not only in demography, but also in the national socio-economic contest. In particular, the increasing presence of immigrants in the Italian labour market shows {{to be related to the}} persistence of relevant structural deficit in the local production system. The foreign component seems to be characterized by three particular aspects. The first refers to a high level of “over-skilled employment”, that results to be higher among foreigners than among natives. The second aspect deals with occupational segregation of immigrants workers, that has stressed the existing segmentation of local labour markets in the country. The third aspect is constituted by underemployment. These aspects are mainly based on gender, education and area of residence. Particularly, legal status (regular or <b>irregular</b> <b>staying)</b> and nationality are additional elements of discrimination to the access of migrants to the labour market and the type of occupation covered. Accordingly, based on the analysis of Istat data on labour forces (2010), this contribution aims to investigate the characteristics of the working insertion of immigrants in the different local segments of Italian labour market, focusing the attention on possible factors that distinguish various nationality of immigrants present across the national territory. Parallel, the research compares the situation of immigrants to that of Italians, in order to identify possible situations of underemployment, over-skilled employment and segregation. The main variables used for analysis are age, gender, area of origin, geographical area of residence, occupational condition, sector of activity, professional level, educational level, year of residence in Italy. Situations of segregation, underemployment and over-skilled employment are measured by means of indexes and multivariate analysis at micro and macro level...|$|R
50|$|Early in {{the summer}} of 1925, Artin {{attended}} the Congress of the Wandervogel youth movement at Wilhelmshausen near Kassel with the intention of gathering a congenial group to undertake a trek through Iceland later that summer. Iceland (before the transforming presence of American and British forces stationed there during WWII) was still a primitive country in 1925, with a thinly scattered population and little transportation infrastructure. Artin succeeded in finding six young men to join him in this adventure. In the second half of August, 1925, the group set out by steamer from Hamburg, first to Norway, where they boarded a second steamer that took them to Iceland, stopping at several of the small east fjord ports before arriving at their destination, Húsavík in the north of the island. Here the Wandervogel group disembarked, their initial goal, trekking down the Laxá River to Lake Mývatn. They made a circuit of the large, <b>irregular</b> lake, <b>staying</b> in farm houses, barns, and occasionally a tent as they went. When they slept in barns, it was often on piles of wet straw or hay. On those lucky occasions when they slept in beds, it could be nearly as damp on account of the rain trickling through the sod roofs. The tent leaked as well.|$|R
30|$|So far, most {{migration}} {{scholars have}} focussed on tracking changes in migration policies. In their pioneering work, Mayda and Patel (2004) collected migration policies for 14 OECD countries between 1980 and 2000, covering {{policies in the}} areas of labour migration, asylum, family reunification, and border control. This dataset was expanded by Ortega and Peri (2012) to include migration policies up to 2006 and for an additional country, Luxembourg. Covering a longer time period but a much smaller number of countries, the Immigration Policy database (ImPol) by Mezger and Gonzalez-Ferrer (2013) measures immigration policy changes of France, Italy, and Spain across five different migrant entry channels (<b>irregular</b> entry, short <b>stay,</b> family reunification, study, and work) since the 1960 s. Other scholars have compiled databases focussing on a specific policy types. For instance, Hatton (2009) investigated asylum policy changes that occurred between 1981 and 1999 across the EU- 15 area (except Luxembourg).|$|R
40|$|In {{the heated}} debate around {{irregular}} migration, the so-called regularization measures represent {{one of the}} main bones of contention – presented by some as the only possible solution to irregular presences and contested by others as rewards for illicit behaviour. Despite their many differences, such measures have a common core – discretion. They are, in fact, gracious concessions of the State to those who, by entering and staying within its borders in breach of its laws, have challenged its sovereignty. The present paper will use an operational definition of discretion to analyse two European regularization mechanisms that, because of their manifest similarities as well as their different empirical outcomes, lend themselves particularly well to comparison: the Swiss “cas de rigueur” procedure and the Spanish “arraigo”. The juxtaposition between the two schemes will be used to investigate how the powers of the State decline, through discretion, different answers to the challenge posed to national immigration models by <b>irregular</b> entries and <b>stays...</b>|$|R

Here, at a small corner house, {{there was a small}} brass plate on a swing door, bearing the words 'Melmotte & Co.' Of whom the Co was composed no one knew. In one sense Mr Melmotte might be said to be in company with all the commercial world, for there was no business to which he would refuse his co-operation on certain terms. But he had never burdened himself with a partner in the usual sense of the term. Here Fisker found three or four clerks seated at desks, and was desired to walk upstairs. The steps were narrow and crooked, and the rooms were small and <b>irregular.</b> Here he <b>stayed</b> for a while in a small dark apartment in which 'The Daily Telegraph' was left for the amusement of its occupant till Miles Grendall announced to him that Mr Melmotte would see him.

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{the concept of}} solidarity {{and how it can}} contribute {{to the understanding of the}} criminalisation of those who provide humanitarian assistance to undocumented migrants in Europe. It also looks at acts of resistance against such criminalisation. Alternative explanations are explored on the basis of theories of solidarity, previous research and collection of material from international and European institutions on the legal situation within the European Union. Particular attention is given to illustrative cases focusing primarily on the more or less publicly acceptable provision of healthcare and the less publicly acceptable provision of housing. Criminalisation can be understood in the light of exclusive solidarity only for those with citizenship or residence permit and as a part of immigration enforcement by deterring those who want to help and therefore discouraging <b>irregular</b> migrants from <b>staying</b> in the EU. Resistance against such criminalisation is built locally, on the basis of solidarity with undocumented migrants that are relatable and familiar, which also explains why solidarity is harder to achieve on a national and European level. Resistance against criminalisation is also built on faith, dignity and other grounds such as cost-benefit estimates for cities tackling issues such as social inclusion and public health...|$|R
40|$|Illegal {{employment}} by third country nationals {{is a reality}} in Luxembourg. However, {{as well as in}} the case of grey and informal economy, it is rather hard to grasp or quantify to which extent. Nevertheless, the problem is not as significant as the one of the posted workers which is more relevant and worrisome and needs to be situated in the context of a labour market of the Greater Region. In the past, several labour related regularisation measures have been implemented in Luxembourg in order to provide both employers and employees the possibility to regularise situations of illegal employment. The last labour related regularisation measure was implemented in early 2013 in the context of the transposition of the Employers' Sanctions Directive 2009 / 52 by law of 21 December 2012. During this regularisation, the Directorate of Immigration received 664 applications. These regularisations give a partial indication of the extent of the phenomenon, even though these numbers do not provide a real picture of the problem because the conditions of this regularisation were very strict and in a very short time frame (less than two months) and a certain number of irregular migrants’ workers were not willing to expose themselves by applying and preferred to remain undetected. This regularisation also provided information on the main sectors were the phenomenon is found in order of importance: HORECA, cleaning, crafts, industry and construction. The Ministry of Labour, Employment and Social and Solidary Economy at the end of the regularisation has insisted in the need to increase the number of controls to employers. The law of 21 December 2012 established administrative as well as criminal sanctions for employers who illegally employ irregularly staying third country nationals, particularly in relation to offenses to the Labour Code in aggravating circumstances. This law amended also article 89 of the Immigration Law abrogating the possibility of making labour related regularisations. The Inspectorate of Labour (‘Inspection de Travail et des Mines’, hereafter called ITM), which is in charge of labour inspections and the control of illegal employment of TCNs in Luxembourg, is currently going through a restructuring phase following the latest audit of this administration from January 2015. Particularly the current insufficient number of staff of the ITM, which is in need of a significant short term increase of staff, represents a main challenge in the field of illegal employment in Luxembourg. It is also in the context of this restructuring phase of the responsible administration that the drafting of this study presented a number of challenges, especially in relation to the operational and statistical part of the template. The information regarding the conditions to be fulfilled by both the employers and the employees in the context of an employment relationship are available on the website of the concerned authorities. Furthermore, they are disseminated by the NGOs working in the field, even though there are no specific campaigns targeted to prevent illegal employment of TCNs. The matter was raised in the context of the ‘social identification badge’, which was introduced in 2013 in order to fight against social dumping in particular in the construction sector. One national stakeholder suggested that the ‘social identification badge’ could be revised and adapted to other economic sectors in order to better monitor and prevent illegal employment. In regards to access to justice and enforcement of rights of illegally employed TCNs, Luxembourg foresees the right for illegally employed TCNs to make a claim against their employer, including in cases in which they have, or have been, returned. This claim falls under the general provisions concerning the right to bring a case before civil courts. The Labour Code establishes that the employer who has employed an <b>irregular</b> <b>staying</b> third-country national must pay to the third-country national the following amounts: 1) salaries and any other emoluments, which a similar employee would have benefited for the same employment; 2) the total amount of outstanding remuneration as well as the cost of the transfer of these amounts to the third-country national to the country to which s/he is returned; 3) the total amount of unpaid social contributions and taxes, including administrative fines, as well as, court and legal fees. In addition, the Labour Code establishes that the third-country national who has been illegally employed before the execution of any return decision has to be systematically and objectively informed by the control agents of his/her rights to recover the outstanding remunerations and back payments, as well as the right to benefit from free of charge legal aid in order to attempt a recovery action against the employer, even if the third-country national has already been returned. Labour unions can support and assist TCNs in legal proceedings related to social and labour law, provided that they have been given a mandate to do so. Eventual costs of administrative and civil proceedings can be taken in charge by the labour unions if the TCN is a member of the respective labour union. The Law does not establish fines against TCN’s who were illegally employed. The TCN may be issued a return decision and lose his/her residence rights; however, the Directorate of immigration processes these situations on a case-by-case basis and inform the persons concerned to terminate the illegal employment situation...|$|R
