25|$|NEMA 1-15P (two-pole, no ground) and NEMA 5-15P (two-pole with <b>ground</b> <b>pin)</b> plugs {{are used}} on commonplace {{domestic}} electrical equipment, and NEMA 5-15R {{is the standard}} 15A electric receptacle (outlet) found in the United States, and under relevant national standards, in Canada (CSA C22.2 No. 42) and Mexico (NMX-J-163-ANCE). Other plug and receptacle types are for special purposes or for heavy-duty applications.|$|E
25|$|Some {{microphones}} such as condenser microphones require power. An {{alternative to}} battery power is phantom power, {{which consists of}} direct current applied equally through the two signal lines of a balanced audio connector, usually a three-pin XLR connector. The supply voltage is referenced to the <b>ground</b> <b>pin</b> of the connector (pin 1 of an XLR), which normally {{is connected to the}} cable shield or a ground wire in the cable or both. Phantom power is usually supplied at a nominal 48 volts DC, although lower voltages are permissible and modern microphones will often operate over a wide range.|$|E
2500|$|The Electrical Safety Foundation International has stated: [...] "Never {{remove the}} <b>ground</b> <b>pin</b> (the third prong) {{to make a}} three-prong plug fit a two-prong outlet." [...] In {{addition}} to the obvious dangers of breaking a ground connection, removing the <b>ground</b> <b>pin</b> to make it fit a 1-15R receptacle or extension cord, may result in the [...] line/neutral polarity being lost.|$|E

2500|$|All NEMA 5 {{devices are}} three-wire {{grounding}} devices (hot-neutral-ground) rated for 125V maximum, with the 5-15, 5-20 and 5-30 being grounded {{versions of the}} 1-15, 1-20 and 1-30, respectively. The addition is a [...] diameter round or U-shaped <b>ground</b> <b>pin,</b> [...] longer than the power blades (so the device is grounded before the power is connected) and located from them by [...] edge-to-edge or [...] center-to-center.|$|E
2500|$|The {{appearance}} of this plug is sometimes confused with a NEMA 10 connector, rated for 240V, but the NEMA TT-30 is a 120V device. The hot and neutral blades are angled at 45° from vertical and 90° to each other, similar to NEMA 10 devices, but the plug is slightly {{smaller than a}} NEMA 10 and larger than ordinary 5-15P plugs. The <b>ground</b> <b>pin</b> is round, like those on straight-blade NEMA grounding devices. Referring to the picture, the orientation {{is the same as}} the NEMA 5 plug and receptacle, with the neutral blade on the lower right.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{a study on}} the effectiveness of <b>grounding</b> <b>pins</b> and high-frequency absorbers to reduce the emissions of heatsinks up to 20 GHz. The study considers four different types of excitations, namely a direct excitation, an excitation by a patch antenna, an excitation by a microstrip below the center of the heatsink, and an excitation by a microstrip that was off-set with respect {{to the center of the}} heatsink. Grounding post are positioned equidistantly along the edges of the heatsink and the number of <b>grounding</b> <b>pins</b> per side is varied. Adding <b>grounding</b> <b>pins</b> significantly reduces the emission of the heatsink below 1 - 2 GHz. At higher frequencies, they lose their capability to reduce the heatsink emission and even introduce extra resonance frequencies where the emission is higher compared to the ungrounded heatsink. Three different possible arrangements for the application of absorbing material were considered, namely a thin flat absorber just below the heatsink, a ring absorber between the heatsink and the PCB, and a collar absorber around the heatsink. The absorber succeeds in reducing the heatsink’s emission above 1 - 2 GHz, but has little of no positive effect on the emissions below 1 - 2 GHz. Only by the combination of the <b>grounding</b> <b>pins</b> and the absorber material, a reduction of the heatsink’s emission is achieved over the full frequency range. status: publishe...|$|R
2500|$|Many {{hand-held}} and bench oscilloscopes {{have the}} ground reference voltage {{common to all}} input channels. If more than one measurement channel is used at the same time, all the input signals must have the same voltage reference, and the shared default reference is the [...] "earth". If there is no differential preamplifier or external signal isolator, this traditional desktop oscilloscope is not suitable for floating measurements. (Occasionally an oscilloscope user will break the <b>ground</b> <b>pin</b> in the power supply cord of a bench-top oscilloscope {{in an attempt to}} isolate the signal common from the earth ground. [...] This practice is unreliable since the entire stray capacitance of the instrument cabinet will be connected into the circuit. [...] Since it is also a hazard to break a safety ground connection, instruction manuals strongly advise against this practice.) ...|$|E

5000|$|Two <b>ground</b> <b>pins,</b> and one pin {{for each}} {{supplied}} voltage, support hot-plug precharging. <b>Ground</b> <b>pins</b> 4 and 12 in a hot-swap cable are the longest, so they make contact first when the connectors are mated. Drive power connector pins 3, 7, and 13 are {{longer than the}} others, so they make contact next. The drive uses them to charge its internal bypass capacitors through current-limiting resistances. Finally, the remaining power pins make contact, bypassing the resistances and providing a low-impedance source of each voltage. This two-step mating process avoids glitches to other loads and possible arcing or erosion of the SATA power connector contacts.|$|R
25|$|The NEMA 5-15 plug has two flat {{parallel}} blades like NEMA 1-15, {{but also}} adds a <b>ground</b> (earth) <b>pin.</b> It is rated 15A at 125 volts. The <b>ground</b> (earth) <b>pin</b> {{is longer than}} the line and neutral blades, so the device is grounded before the power is connected. Both current-carrying blades on grounding plugs are normally narrow, since the <b>ground</b> (earth) <b>pin</b> enforces polarity. NEMA 1-15 plugs are also compatible with NEMA 5-15 sockets.|$|R

50|$|Though {{the number}} of wires doubled, {{the number of}} {{connector}} pins and the pinout remain the same as 40-conductor cables, and the external appearance of the connectors is identical. Internally, the connectors are different; the connectors for the 80-wire cable connect {{a larger number of}} ground wires to the <b>ground</b> <b>pins,</b> while the connectors for the 40-wire cable connect ground wires to <b>ground</b> <b>pins</b> one-for-one. 80-wire cables usually come with three differently colored connectors (blue, black, and gray for controller, master drive, and slave drive respectively) as opposed to uniformly colored 40-wire cable's connectors (commonly all gray). The gray connector on 80-conductor cables has pin 28 CSEL not connected, making it the slave position for drives configured cable select.|$|R
5000|$|There {{are several}} {{alternatives}} for connecting newer appliances to two-prong receptacles without rewiring the building: removing the <b>grounding</b> <b>pin</b> of the plug (unsafe), replacing the receptacle with a three-prong outlet (unsafe without proper ground), or replacing the receptacle with a Ground Fault Circuit Interrupter (GFCI).|$|R

50|$|Because {{both ends}} of the RS-232 circuit depend on the <b>ground</b> <b>pin</b> being zero volts, {{problems}} will occur when connecting machinery and computers where the voltage between the <b>ground</b> <b>pin</b> on one end, and the <b>ground</b> <b>pin</b> on the other is not zero. This may also cause a hazardous ground loop. Use of a common ground limits RS-232 to applications with relatively short cables. If the two devices are far enough apart or on separate power systems, the local ground connections {{at either end of the}} cable will have differing voltages; this difference will reduce the noise margin of the signals. Balanced, differential serial connections such as RS-422, RS-485, and USB can tolerate larger ground voltage differences because of the differential signaling.|$|E

50|$|Modern {{stage pin}} {{connectors}} have incorporated a third pin for a safety ground connection and are {{commonly referred to}} as two pin and ground (2P&G) to distinguish them from their ungrounded two-pin predecessors. The <b>ground</b> <b>pin</b> is situated between the line and neutral pins and closer to the latter. This asymmetrical configuration effectively polarizes the connector ensuring that the line and neutral conductors are not exchanged in a properly wired installation. The <b>ground</b> <b>pin</b> is also longer than the other two, ensuring that the safety ground connection is made first when making a connection.|$|E
