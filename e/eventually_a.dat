5|$|<b>Eventually</b> <b>a</b> group not {{involving}} Gravel {{took the}} case to the U.S. Supreme Court, which declined to issue an injunction against it, and the Cannikin test took place as scheduled in November 1971.|$|E
5|$|<b>Eventually</b> <b>a</b> mysterious {{telephone}} call directed Harvard official Charles R. Apted to West Roxbury, {{where he was}} met by an automobile which he followed into some woods; there two young men, with collars up and hatbrims down, handed him the Cod (not wrapped in any flag) before speeding away.|$|E
5|$|Though Johnston {{did not see}} an okapi himself, he {{did manage}} to obtain pieces of striped skin and <b>eventually</b> <b>a</b> skull. From this skull, the okapi was {{correctly}} classified as a relative of the giraffe; in 1901, the species was formally recognized as Okapia johnstoni.|$|E

5|$|A fleet was {{necessary}} for the defeat of Japan, and <b>eventually</b> <b>a</b> sizeable one, the British Pacific Fleet, did go to the Far East, where it fought alongside the United States Pacific Fleet. The closer relations that developed between the two navies prior to the outbreak of war with Japan, and the alliance that developed from it afterwards, became the most positive and enduring strategic legacy of the Singapore strategy.|$|E
5|$|A {{prototype}} of the automatic strobe unit was produced in October, along with a new Mk. IVA-like radar unit with a manual strobe for testing. EMI was then asked to provide another breadboard {{prototype of}} the strobe unit for air testing, which was delivered on 12 October. A raft of problems were found and addressed. Among these, {{it was found that}} the strobe would often stick to the ground reflection, and when it did not, would not stick until it had a strong signal at shorter ranges, or might stick to the wrong target. <b>Eventually</b> <b>a</b> panacea button was added to unstick the strobe in these cases.|$|E
5|$|A snow {{called the}} Unity {{was added to}} the fleet, and used as a tender, but was {{abandoned}} during an encounter with a man of war named the Mermaid. As Low's success increased in the Caribbean, so did his notoriety. <b>Eventually,</b> <b>a</b> bounty was placed on his head, and Low set out for the Azores, again teaming up with Charles Harris. As they terrorised the Azores, the pressure increased from the authorities, who by then had taken special notice of Low, despite the hordes of pirates in operation at the time.|$|E
3000|$|In fact, if (3.1) {{has neither}} <b>an</b> <b>eventually</b> {{positive}} nor <b>an</b> <b>eventually</b> negative solution, then each nonzero solution of (3.1) is oscillatory.|$|R
50|$|In 1947 county {{supervisors}} contracted {{for another}} hangar, ramp, and <b>eventually</b> <b>an</b> administration building. The supervisors named Chris Hoover full-time airport manager in 1953.|$|R

5|$|A weak wave in the ITCZ {{organized}} into Tropical Depression Ten-E on August 30. It headed west-northwest and quickly intensified into {{a tropical storm}} and <b>eventually,</b> <b>a</b> hurricane. Hernan then began rapidly deepening, reaching Category5 intensity on September 1. It maintained that intensity for 12hours before tracking over cooler waters. The storm weakened steadily, with wind shear contributing to its deterioration. Hernan then degenerated into a remnant low on September 6. The low turned to the southwest and dissipated three days later.|$|E
5|$|After some time, {{they might}} be sent to work on road or other {{projects}} away from these main settlements. Continued good behaviour could see the convict granted a ticket-of-leave, allowing private employment in a specified district of the colony, and <b>eventually</b> <b>a</b> Conditional Pardon, allowing most freedoms, except for returning to England. A Certificate of Freedom would only be granted {{at the end of}} a sentence. Misbehaviour would result in demotion through these levels of work, including returning to convict status within the prison. Re-offenders and captured escapees, after corporal punishment and time in solitary confinement, would be placed on a chain gang undertaking hard labour, typically on roads near Fremantle.|$|E
5|$|Alex North's unused {{music had}} its first public {{appearance}} in Telarc's {{issue of the}} main theme on Hollywood's Greatest Hits, Vol. 2, a compilation album by Erich Kunzel and the Cincinnati Pops Orchestra. All the music North originally wrote was recorded commercially by North's friend and colleague Jerry Goldsmith with the National Philharmonic Orchestra and was released on Varèse Sarabande CDs shortly after Telarc's first theme release but before North's death. <b>Eventually,</b> <b>a</b> mono mix-down of North's original recordings, which had survived in the interim, would be released as a limited-edition CD by Intrada Records.|$|E

5|$|By 1591, {{the king}} of Jaffna Ethirimanna Cinkam was {{installed}} by the Portuguese. Although he was nominally a client, he resisted missionary activities and helped the interior Kandyan kingdom in its quest to get military help from South India. <b>Eventually,</b> <b>a</b> usurper named Cankili II, resisted Portuguese overlordship only to find himself ousted and hanged by Phillippe de Oliveira in 1619. The subsequent rule by the Portuguese saw the population convert to Roman Catholicism. The population also decreased due to excessive taxation, as most people fled the core areas of the former kingdom.|$|E
5|$|<b>Eventually</b> <b>a</b> liberal agitation, pro-Greek and {{inspired}} {{by what was}} then happening in that country, began to develop in France. The longer France waited, the more delicate her position vis-à-vis Metternich became. The ultra-royalist government thus decided to accelerate events. A land expedition was proposed to Great Britain, which refused to intervene directly. Meanwhile, Russia had declared war against the Ottoman Empire and its military victories were unsettling for London, which {{did not wish to}} see the Tsarist empire extend too far south. Thus Great Britain did not oppose an intervention by France alone.|$|E
5|$|<b>Eventually</b> <b>a</b> {{little after}} noon Wilton {{arrived at the}} inquest, and gave a full account of the incident. Lord Granville (half-brother of the Marquess of Stafford) told the jury that Huskisson had been {{suffering}} from numbness in his leg from a previous operation, and that this may have caused his apparent problems with movement. No witnesses recollected seeing any signal flags raised {{from any of the}} locomotives involved, including Rocket, although a system of warning flags {{was supposed to have been}} in place.|$|E
30|$|The linear {{regression}} {{to estimate the}} Market Model coefficients is performed dynamically and, <b>eventually,</b> <b>an</b> Event Study is also performed dynamically according to the selected variables.|$|R

50|$|William Gilbert van Tassel Sutphen (1861-1945) was an American playwright, librettist, novelist, and editor, an {{authority}} {{and author of}} publications on golf, and, <b>eventually,</b> <b>an</b> Episcopalian minister.|$|R
5|$|<b>Eventually</b> <b>a</b> rift {{developed}} between Amin and Obote, {{exacerbated by the}} support Amin had built within the army by recruiting from the West Nile region, his involvement in operations to support the rebellion in southern Sudan and an attempt on Obote's life in 1969. In October 1970, Obote {{took control of the}} armed forces, reducing Amin from his months-old post of commander of all the armed forces to that of commander of the army.|$|E
5|$|Finally, the King {{arranged}} for Stephen to marry Matilda in 1125, the daughter and only heiress of the Count of Boulogne, who owned both the important continental port of Boulogne and vast estates in the north-west and south-east of England. In 1127, William Clito, a potential claimant to the English throne, seemed {{likely to become}} the Count of Flanders; Stephen was sent by the King {{on a mission to}} prevent this, and in the aftermath of his successful election, William Clito attacked Stephen's lands in neighbouring Boulogne in retaliation. <b>Eventually</b> <b>a</b> truce was declared, and William Clito died the following year.|$|E
5|$|He scored {{nine times}} in 40 league games {{in his first}} season, {{including}} two in a 2–1 home win over relegated Southport on 28 April 2007 in order to seal a play-off place. Eleven days later, in the second leg of the play-off semi-final away to Oxford United, he scored a goal which took the match to extra time and <b>eventually</b> <b>a</b> penalty shootout which his side won. In the final on 20 May at Wembley Stadium, he came on as a 36th-minute substitute for goalscorer Lee Phillips in a 1–2 loss to Morecambe.|$|E
50|$|Stumpp {{was most}} {{certainly}} a convert to Protestantism. The war brought {{the invasion of}} armies of either side, the assaults by marauding soldiers and <b>eventually</b> <b>an</b> epidemic of the plague.|$|R
50|$|The first Member of Parliament for Brant South, {{elected in}} 1867 was Edmund Burke Wood. Wood was also {{elected to the}} Provincial Parliament. <b>Eventually</b> <b>an</b> act was passed to abolish dual representation.|$|R
50|$|A {{temporary}} organ {{was provided}} {{for the opening of}} the church in 1868. <b>Eventually</b> <b>an</b> organ by Halmshaw was purchased. A specification of the organ {{can be found on the}} National Pipe Organ Register.|$|R
5|$|His law {{practice}} had many influential clients, including Lord Braco and {{the sons of}} Lord Fraser of Lovat. Pitfour was one of 15 advocates acting in a case raised by Alexander Fraser against Lord Fraser claiming the liferents to the Lovat estates. <b>Eventually</b> <b>a</b> compromise was reached; Lovat retained the liferents and Fraser gained a monetary sum instead. As the negotiations had taken many hours of legal deliberation over a three-year period, the case proved very profitable for Pitfour.|$|E
5|$|Hoffman {{was born}} on July 23, 1967, in the Rochester suburb of Fairport, New York. His mother, Marilyn O'Connor (née Loucks), came from nearby Waterloo and worked as an {{elementary}} school teacher before becoming a lawyer and <b>eventually</b> <b>a</b> family court judge. His father, Gordon Stowell Hoffman, was a native of Geneva, New York, and worked for the Xerox Corporation. Along with one brother, Gordy, Hoffman had two sisters, Jill and Emily.|$|E
5|$|However, {{soon after}} the six episodes {{comprising}} the third series had been recorded by Above the Title Productions, a minor legal dispute over the online availability of episodes arose between the production company and The Walt Disney Company, which had started production on the Hitchhiker's movie, also in 2003. This led to a delay in transmitting the third series and an immediate cessation {{in the production of}} series four and five. <b>Eventually</b> <b>a</b> deal was worked out, and the Tertiary Phase was first broadcast on BBC Radio 4 on 21 September 2004.|$|E
50|$|<b>Eventually,</b> <b>an</b> {{attack was}} planned for 3 March that would target a police bus that took senior policemen to Gugulethu station every morning. Mbane told Bellingan and Liebenberg this, who {{prepared}} for the event.|$|R
50|$|Louise Wimmer barely scrapes {{a living}} and has to resort to living in her {{constantly}} malfunctioning car. <b>Eventually</b> <b>an</b> efficient social security officer jump starts her life {{with the prospect of}} a new home.|$|R
50|$|The current {{consensus}} {{seems to}} be that the limitanei were organized as units of professional soldiers, but they gradually became part-time soldiers and <b>eventually</b> <b>an</b> unpaid militia, relying on other professions including farming for income.|$|R
