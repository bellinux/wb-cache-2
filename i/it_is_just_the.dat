5|$|Marge's absence is {{felt at home}} as Homer and {{the rest}} of the family struggles to cope without her. Without Marge, the house shortly becomes a {{complete}} wreck. The annual bake sale also suffers– without Marge's marshmallow squares, the Springfield Park Commission fails to raise enough money to pay for a statue of Abraham Lincoln. Instead they purchase one of Jimmy Carter. The townspeople are enraged by this, and riot. When Marge is released from jail, the townspeople welcome her back and apologize for suspecting her. They even unveil a statue for Marge, though <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>just</b> <b>the</b> Carter statue with Marge's hair added to it. The last scene shows Bart and Lisa playing on the statue, which has been converted into a tether ball post.|$|E
5|$|The local nurses' {{union for}} the Princeton-Plainsboro Teaching Hospital is on strike. Jeff, {{the husband of}} Deb (Chad Morgan), one of the nurses, collapses while walking the picket line. At the {{emergency}} room, House suspects Jeff's extreme niceness and inability to get angry is a major symptom of an underlying condition. After various tests, the team suspects his niceness is a personality change resulting from syphilis. Kutner (Kal Penn) asks the couple if either of them had an affair, {{which could lead to}} syphilis. Deb denies it, stating that <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>just</b> <b>the</b> way her husband behaves and that it is impossible for her to not love him.|$|E

Mile after mile, to Zurich, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>the</b> same. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>the</b> same in the tram-car going into Zurich; <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>the</b> same in the town, in the shops, in the restaurant. All was the utmost level of ordinariness and well-being, but so ordinary that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> like a blight. All the picturesqueness of the town <b>is</b> nothing, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> like a most ordinary, average, usual person in an old costume. The place was soul-killing.|$|R

25|$|At {{the start}} of the 21st Century, Oulton Park is still as popular as ever and still as {{demanding}} as it ever has been on drivers and riders, but, in common with so many circuits, it no longer hosts major international events. Gone are the glory days when all the major Formula One teams (including Scuderia Ferrari) came to Cheshire, now the major events on the circuit’s calendar are the twice-yearly visit of the British Superbike Championship and the annual visit of the British Touring Car Championship. This is no fault of the circuit management – <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>just</b> <b>the</b> way the sport has gone. But Oulton Park is still the great challenge it always was.|$|E
25|$|The first {{description}} of symptoms associated with alcoholic polyneuropathy were recorded by John C. Lettsome in 1787 when he noted hyperesthesia and paralysis in legs more than arms of patients. Jackson {{has also been}} credited with describing polyneuropathy in chronic alcoholics in 1822. The clinical title of alcoholic polyneuropathy was widely recognized by the late nineteenth century. It was thought that the polyneuropathy was {{a direct result of}} the toxic effect alcohol had on peripheral nerves when used excessively. In 1928, George C. Shattuck argued that the polyneuropathy resulted from a vitamin B deficiency commonly found in alcoholics and he claimed that alcoholic polyneuropathy should be related to beriberi. This debate continues today over what exactly causes this disease, some argue <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>just</b> <b>the</b> alcohol toxicity, others claim the vitamin deficiencies are to blame and still others say it is some combination of the two.|$|E

500|$|Matsui {{had told}} friends {{before going to}} Sugamo Prison that at the IMTFE he planned to defend not only himself but also Japan's wartime conduct as a whole. Matsui insisted that Japan had acted defensively against {{aggression}} by foreign powers and that Japan's war aims were to liberate Asia from Western imperialism. Concerning {{the origins of the}} Second Sino-Japanese War, Matsui called it [...] "a fight between brothers within the 'Asian family'" [...] and stated that the war was fought against the Chinese, not [...] "because we hate them, but on the contrary because we love them too much. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>just</b> <b>the</b> same in a family when an elder brother has taken all that he can stand from his ill-behaved younger brother and has to chastise him in order to make him behave properly." ...|$|E
500|$|In 1973, Górecki {{approached}} the Polish folklorist Adolf Dygacz {{in search of}} traditional melodies to incorporate in a new work. Dygacz presented four songs which had been recorded in the [...] Silesia region in south-western Poland. Górecki {{was impressed by the}} melody [...] "Where has he gone, my dear young son?" [...] (Kajże się podzioł mój synocek miły?), which describes a mother's mourning for a son lost in war, and probably dates from the Silesian Uprisings of 1919–21. Górecki had heard a version of the song in the 1960s and had not been impressed by the arrangement, but the words and the melody of Dygacz's new version made a lasting impression on him. He said [...] "for me, it is a wonderfully poetic text. I do not know if a 'professional' poet would create such a powerful entity out of such terse, simple words. It is not sorrow, despair or resignation, or the wringing of hands: <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>just</b> <b>the</b> great grief and lamenting of a mother who has lost her son." ...|$|E
500|$|British {{graffiti}} {{artist and}} political activist Banksy {{is credited with}} creating the opening titles and couch gag for this episode, in what amounted to {{the first time that}} an artist has been invited to storyboard the show. Executive producer Al Jean first took note of Banksy after seeing his 2010 film Exit Through the Gift Shop. According to Jean, [...] "The concept in my mind was, 'What if this graffiti artist came in and tagged our main titles?'" [...] Simpsons casting director Bonnie Pietila was able to contact the artist through the film's producers, and asked if he would be interested in writing a main title for the show. Jean said Banksy [...] "sent back boards for pretty much what you saw." [...] Series creator Matt Groening gave the idea his blessing, and helped try to make the sequence as close to Banksy's original storyboards as possible. Fox's standards and practices department demanded some changes, and Jean agreed to them [...] "for taste"; Jean said that [...] "95 percent of <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>just</b> <b>the</b> way he [...] wanted," [...] but declined to say what was in the censored 5%, only saying that the original version was [...] "even a little sadder." [...] In January 2011, Banksy published the original storyboard on his website. It appears that a poster of Rupert Murdoch could be the 5% that was left out of the final cut.|$|E

500|$|Lisa visits Smithers, {{owner of}} the world's largest Malibu Stacy collection, and asks for help in finding Lovell, who was ousted from the Malibu Stacy company in 1974. Lisa bikes to Lovell's house and plays one of the doll's phrases over the intercom. The gate {{immediately}} opens. Lisa and Lovell decide {{to create a new}} talking doll, Lisa Lionheart, voiced by Lisa herself. The doll is quietly released, but the executives of Malibu Stacy have a meeting in which they agree that Lisa's doll is a real threat because it might hurt the sales of their doll. Meanwhile, Grampa struggles with his new job at Krusty Burger, suffering a war flashback at the drive-in and losing his false teeth making burgers. He soon becomes angry at the way seniors are treated, and quits. After a slow initial release, Lisa Lionheart suddenly gains popularity among the fans of Malibu Stacy after being featured in Kent Brockman's news show. At the mall, as kids, and Smithers, rush out to buy Lisa Lionheart, a cart of Malibu Stacy dolls with new hats is wheeled right into the path of the group running for the Lionheart display. Lisa appeals to them that <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>just</b> <b>the</b> same doll with a [...] "stupid, cheap" [...] hat, but they all prefer to stick with Malibu Stacy, largely due to the encouragement of Smithers, except for one little girl, who leaves with a Lisa Lionheart doll. Despite the fact that the doll is a failure, Lisa takes heart that her message was able to get through to at least one little girl.|$|E
500|$|Abi was {{introduced}} into the series in 2006, by executive producer Kate Harwood. The character and her casting was announced on 25 May 2006. She and her immediate family, father Max (Wood), mother Tanya (Joyner) and older sister Lauren (Duggan, recast to Jossa in 2010), are {{an extension of the}} Branning family, who have appeared in EastEnders since 1993. Fitzgerald, in her first major television role, began filming for the soap in May 2006 and made her first on-screen appearance in July. Fitzgerald's mother commented on her daughter's casting: [...] "Personally, I feel I want to show how proud we are of her and to thank everyone who has prayed for her and helped her in any way. At first, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>just</b> <b>the</b> look they go for. Then it is more intensive and she had to read from a script. By the second audition, she was still up against 60 or 70 people. You start thinking about it when she gets to the third audition, but when the agent rang up and said she had got the part it was an overwhelming feeling. You don't know what it means until that point". Fitzgerald was offered the part about three months after her final audition. As Fitzgerald was only 10 years old when she got the part, she was required to balance her filming requirements with schooling in Northampton, and learning lines. In 2012, she told Inside Soap that she thought she had messed up her audition, and did not realise how big the show was until she was older. In 2014, she told BBC Radio 1 that when she met Wood and Joyner, her on-screen parents, she realised it did not matter that she had messed up her lines in her last audition, because she looked like them both. Fitzgerald was required to cry on her first day of filming, and admitted in 2014 that this was embarrassing, and she was unable to produce tears, but was [...] "just making noises". Fitzgerald was chaperoned by her mother until she was 16.|$|E

2500|$|The Vale of York {{is often}} {{supposed}} to stretch from the River Tees {{in the north}} to the Humber estuary in the south.

2500|$|The {{exterior}} algebra {{over the}} complex numbers is the archetypal {{example of a}} superalgebra, which plays {{a fundamental role in}} physical theories pertaining to fermions and supersymmetry. A single element of the exterior algebra is called a supernumber or Grassmann number. The exterior algebra itself is then just a one-dimensional superspace: <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>just</b> <b>the</b> set of all of the points in the exterior algebra. The topology on this space is essentially the weak topology, the open sets being the cylinder sets. [...] An -dimensional superspace is just the -fold product of exterior algebras.|$|E

2500|$|There is {{considerable}} controversy surrounding the term salsa {{and the idea}} that it is its own distinct genre. Several New York musicians who had already been performing Cuban dance music for decades when salsa was popularized initially scoffed at the term. For example, Cuban-born Machito declared: [...] "There's nothing new about salsa, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>just</b> <b>the</b> same old music that was played in Cuba for over fifty years." [...] Similarly, New York native Tito Puente stated: [...] "The only salsa I know is sold in a bottle called ketchup. I play Cuban music." [...] Eventually though, both Machito and Puente embraced the term as a financial necessity.|$|E
