50|$|The {{first one}} was that the pilot flying, the Captain, had accidentally {{selected}} the reverse beta range for the propellers {{with the intention of}} losing energy to correct the airspeed, regain the descent path or shorten the landing as much as possible, as the reverse beta mode acted as powerful brakes. During that time, an asymmetry occurred, which could have caused an undesirable behavior or could have caused the plane to reach its desired speed. In either case, it is necessary at that moment to de-select reverse beta range. Then the pilot would have pushed the levers energetically back to their normal use range by increasing the thrust, which would explain the change in the engine noise. Asymmetry in the power levers movement, or in the operation of the propeller mechanism, or even in the position of the propeller levers, would then have led to asymmetry between the engines, to an extent that would have led to a violent yaw movement, inducing a sharp roll to the left, possibly associated with a stall of the left wing, then a dive. The pilot {{would not have been able}} to regain control of the aircraft, which would have been both too slow and too near the ground at that moment. This hypothesis was supported by testimonies from numerous eyewitnesses and routine <b>in-flight</b> <b>procedure</b> violations in the airport.|$|E
40|$|This paper proposes an {{efficient}} algorithm {{with a novel}} procedure for trajectory planning of unmanned aerial vehicles in three-dimensional space. This work has been motivated by a challenge to develop a fast trajectory planning algorithm for autonomous unmanned aerial vehicles through the midcourse waypoints. The waypoints that are defined as a preflight or <b>in-flight</b> <b>procedure</b> are described in a five-dimensional configuration: the position in three dimensions plus desired crossing heading and flight-path angles. For achieving the waypoints, the Dubins path is extended to three-dimensional applications by using the geometrical concepts. In addition, the trajectory planning algorithm is represented {{as a set of}} ordinary differential equations called optimal-constrained-trajectory kinematics by applying the differential geometry concepts. Optimal-constrained-trajectory kinematic is a closed-loop guidance law that generates the guidance commands based on the waypoint configuration and minimum turning radius and is solved in a real-time manner. The proposed algorithm includes an operational framework that leads to gradually generating the smooth three-dimensional trajectory, aimed at reaching the midcourse targets and final target so that they are smoothly connected to each other. Finally, the simulation results show the capability of the algorithm in dynamic trajectory planning in low computational burden. Nomenclature eH v = velocity unit vector in H coordinate syste...|$|E

40|$|In-flight {{aggression}} {{is the term}} used to describe aggressive behaviour during flights. The dangers such behaviour pose are evident when the lives of passengers and cabin crew are threatened. In the worst case scenario, passenger/s will barged into the cockpit and interfere with flight controls, causing the aircraft to crash while losing all lives onboard. This study investigates the magnitude of in-flight aggression {{and some of the}} triggers that lead passengers to it. It also examines the effectiveness of some measures and the environment which in-flight aggression manifest. The results showed that cabin crew were exposed to the serious dangers of in-flight aggression 6 times more than an average passenger. After September 11 th, passengers became more aware of the dangers of in-flight aggression and were more willing to assist cabin crew should the need arise. Alcohol was found to be the top trigger of in-flight aggression and cabin crew intervention of such behaviour is most effective compared to other measures such as flight crew, other passengers, legislation, etc. Some aspects of airline policies and procedures related to the management of in-flight aggression require attention. Pre-flight and <b>in-flight</b> <b>procedures</b> and policies were only moderately effective and experienced cabin crew found them disappointing. Airlines encourages their crew to report incidents and have high safety standards which they expect cabin crew to adhere to strictly, failing which cabin crew are likely to face disciplinary actions. However the cabin crew were seldom informed about outcome of incidents and lessons drawn from incidents seldom led to policy or procedural improvements. Cabin crew believed that both physical and psychological passenger management techniques should be incorporated in training and many would like to be trained in self-defence although many airlines do not provide such training. There is some evidence that profiles of passenger and cabin crew can be used to predict a potential perpetrator and the effectiveness of a cabin crew managing an incident. Based on the finding, several recommendations were made to better manage in-flight aggression...|$|R

40|$|The Alpha Magnetic Spectrograph (AMS) is a {{composite}} particle detector to be accommodated on the International Space Station (ISS) in 2008. AMS is mainly devoted to galactic, charged Cosmic Rays studies, Antimatter and Dark Matter searches. Besides the main, classical physics goals, capabilities {{in the field of}} GeV and multi-GeV gamma astrophysics have been established and are under investigation by a number of groups. Due to the unsteadiness of the ISS platform, a star-mapper device is required in order to fully exploit the intrinsic arc-min angular resolution provided by the Silicon Tracker.

40|$|Crew {{health is}} a {{dominant}} issue in manned space flight. Microbiological concerns, in particular, have repeatedly emerged as determinants of flight readiness. For example, {{in at least}} one case, suspected contamination of the potable water supply nearly forced a launch delay. In another instance, a crew member's urinary tract infection nearly led to early termination of the mission, in part due to the difficulty of accurately diagnosing the nature of the infection in-flight. Microbial problems are an increasing concern with the trend towards longer-duration missions. It is essential to the success of such missions that systems that deliver acceptable quality of air and water during the anticipated lifetime of the spacecraft be available. As mission duration and resupply intervals increase, {{it will be necessary to}} rely on advanced life support systems which incorporate both biological and physical-chemical recycling methods for air and water as well as provide food for the crew. It therefore is necessary to develop real-time, robust, <b>in-flight</b> monitoring <b>procedures</b> that are sensitive enough to detect less than 100 CFU (colony forming units) of bacteria per 100 milliliters of water.

40|$|The {{complexity}} of the single linear hyperspectral pushbroom imaging based on a high altitude airship (HAA) without a three-axis stabilized platform {{is much more than}} that based on the spaceborne and airborne. Due to the effects of air pressure, temperature and airflow, the large pitch and roll angles tend to appear frequently that create pushbroom images highly characterized with severe geometric distortions. Thus, the <b>in-flight</b> calibration <b>procedure</b> is not appropriate to apply to the single linear pushbroom sensors on HAA having no three-axis stabilized platform. In order to address this problem, a new ground-based boresight calibration method is proposed. Firstly, a coordinate’s transformation model is developed for direct georeferencing (DG) of the linear imaging sensor, and then the linear error equation is derived from it by using the Taylor expansion formula. Secondly, the boresight misalignments are worked out by using iterative least squares method with few ground control points (GCPs) and ground-based side-scanning experiments. The proposed method is demonstrated by three sets of experiments: (i) the stability and reliability of the method is verified through simulation-based experiments; (ii) the boresight calibration is performed using ground-based experiments; and (iii) the validation is done by applying on the orthorectification of the real hyperspectral pushbroom images from a HAA Earth observation payload system developed by our research team—“LanTianHao”. The test results show that the proposed boresight calibration approach significantly improves the quality of georeferencing by reducing the geometric distortions caused by boresight misalignments to the minimum level...|$|R
