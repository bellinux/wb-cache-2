40|$|Over {{the past}} few years, the {{expectations}} of stakeholders regarding Sustainable Development have strengthened the importance of CSR or Sustainable Development practices in companies. In France, NRE laws and more recently the <b>Grenelle</b> <b>Environment</b> <b>Forum</b> required from companies to disclose and publish information on environmental, social and societal issues. On the international level, the Global Reporting Initiative gives a framework for CSR reporting. Companies tend to improve their CSR policies by setting action plans, objectives, and publishing dedicated reports. Subsequently, to assess their performance, companies need to design specific indicators {{in order to measure}} environmental, social and societal information. It is all the more challenging that intangible information, such as biodiversity or human capital, are very difficult to evaluate. Still, when comparing the performance of companies, even in the same sector of activity, it appears that indicators are actually very hetero-geneous and do not allow to perform a proper comparison. This thesis will explore current practices of CSR or Sustainable Development reporting and more specifically the use of indicators in the private sector as well as their limitations and areas for improvement. A mutli-method approach, including a literature review, a case-study and an interview, has been used to perform the research...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe {{world is}} facing climate change, which {{impacts on the}} {{international}} community at large. Such a problem requires a global response followed by local actions {{to deal with this}} new challenge. This response is characterized by the crossing of mitigation measures, in order to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and adaptation measures for reducing the risk and damage from current (ex post aspect) and future (ex ante aspect) harmful impacts. Among the different effects compiled by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), we could note for instance rising sea level or more frequent flash floods and marine submersion. Statistical studies have shown that natural disasters will be increasingly important in the next few years. Therefore, it is urgently necessary to draw up adaptation and risk reduction measures and all the instruments of public policy, such as normative instrument / law, have to be mobilized. These last years, France has established a real adaptation to climate change policy through the development of the National Climate Change Adaptation Plan (PNACC) provided for in the Grenelle Act of 2009. Indeed, this plan is consistent with the European strategy of adaptation to climate change adopted in 2013 by the European Commission, which invites every Member State to adopt comprehensive adaptation strategies. When analysing on a legal point of view these different plans or strategies adopted at national or European level, one may see there weak normative force. Even if the Grenelle Act of 2009 makes provision in Article 42 for “the preparation of a National Adaptation Plan for a variety of areas of activity by 2011 ”, one may say that it has no legal value. Indeed, the plan has not been adopted by the French Parliament or the Government through a regulatory act. Only a consultation was carried out in 2010 bringing together panels from the <b>Grenelle</b> <b>Environment</b> <b>Forum</b> (elected representatives and local authorities, the state, employers, employee unions and non-profit associations). At the European level, the Strategy of adaptation to climate change has been drawn up through a communication of the European Commission. These two plans can be both described as soft law instruments used to improve stakeholders support (Dreyfus & Patt, 2011). Even if such an intention can be laudable, it must be remembered that States are responsible for human security. This responsibility belongs to the political and legal domains. From an intern and European legal point of view, there is no explicit obligation stating that a State has to protect its population against the consequences of climate change impacts. Yet, the French disaster law is composed of the protection principle, which enjoins the State and local authorities to protect effectively their population when a natural disaster happens (Cans at al., 2014). At the European level, the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (ECHR) protects the right to life and imposes positive obligations on Member States to guarantee this fundamental right (Gouritin, 2009). In order to avoid any action for damages against public authorities and to constrain actors to prepare effectively to climate change consequences, the implementation of a real arsenal of hard law provisions is necessary. But how can we incorporate this variable “climate change“, characterized by its uncertainty and its permanent evolution in progress, into normative instrument which are traditionally looking for a certain degree of legal certainty?The purpose of this communication is to analyse some French legislative instruments directly or indirectly used in the field of flood risk management (flood risk prevention plan (PPRI), flood risk management plan [PGRI], local urban planning scheme [PLU], local urban planning scheme [PLU, territorial consistency plan [SCoT]) from a climate change perspective. The main issue for this topic is to what extent these different instruments can be a vehicle for adaptation to climate change. On conclusion to this study, concrete propositions will be made in order to better integrate data linked to climate change into these legal instruments...|$|E
