Credit enhancement is an integral component of this process as it creates a security that has a higher rating than the issuing company, which allows the issuing company to monetize its assets while paying a lower rate of interest than would be possible via a secured bank loan or <b>debt</b> <b>issuance</b> by the issuing company.|$|E

A difference-in-differences empirical strategy reveals that substitution to bank debt and alternative sources of capital (e. g., equity, cash balances, and trade credit) was limited, leading to an almost one-for-one decline in net investment with the decline in net <b>debt</b> <b>issuances.</b> Despite this sharp change in behavior, corporate leverage ratios re-mained relatively stable, a result of the contemporaneous decline in <b>debt</b> <b>issuances</b> and in-vestment.

Consistent with the notion that newly issued equity is ultimately priced similar to pre-SEO levels, we find that growth stocks perform significantly better than value stocks in the 36 months following the SOE. We also examine the long run performance following senior <b>debt</b> <b>issuances</b> and document a substantial outperformance (underperformance) for growth (value) real estate securities in the 36 months following the offering. Overall, our findings are consistent with the hypothesis that growth REITs can benefit from “public vs. private market arbitrage”...|$|R

Besides noting that these international capital raisings grew almost four-fold from 1991 to 2005, accounting for 35 percent of all capital raised through security issuances, the paper has three main findings. First, a large and growing fraction of capital raisings, especially <b>debt</b> <b>issuances,</b> occurs in international markets, but {{a very small number}} of firms accounts for the bulk of international capital raisings, highlighting the distributional implications of financial globalization. Second, changes in firm performance following equity and <b>debt</b> <b>issuances</b> in international markets are qualitatively similar to those following domestic issuances, suggesting that capital raisings abroad are not intrinsically different from domestic ones. Third, after firms start accessing international markets, they significantly increase the amount raised in domestic markets, suggesting that international and domestic markets are complements.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this article is to {{evaluate}} and compare the incremental cost of purchased power from non-utility generators (NUG) versus utility built generation considering a variety of contracts for energy purchases. Four types of contracts are evaluated: (1) Flat Rate Produce and Pay, (2) On-Peak/Off-Peak, (3) Basic Dispatchable, and 4) Actual Cycle Energy Dispatch. An analysis conducted for a representative utility calculates the effects of NUG power purchases on a utility's energy production costs and the cost of new <b>debt</b> <b>issuances.</b> Dispatchable energy contracts are shown to provide significant economic and operating advantages over Flat Rate and On-Peak/Off-Peak energy contracts. The analysis also shows that NUG purchases based on the actual costs of dispatch cost less than utility built generation financed at the utility's weighted average cost of capital. NUG contracts for a utility which already has significant risk exposure are shown to parallel a capital lease. Under these conditions, additional payment obligations to NUGs increase the cost of new <b>debt</b> <b>issuances</b> making an equity issuance for utility built capacity a more attractive option. ...|$|R
