The professors attempted to hand out the exam to the other students in the class, but the protesters confiscated them. Retreating to Goethean Hall next door, the professors and staff met to evaluate the situation. The protesters followed them to the building, blocked all doors and exits and held them hostage, declaring that they would not release the faculty members until they received an apology and immunity from punishment. The standoff lasted until midnight, when the professors agreed to allow the students to grade themselves. The students relented and released the hostages. However the college's Professional Standards Committee later overturned the decision, declaring that the professors would, in fact, have to grade the students after all.|$|E

How to prove the understanding of that concept is difficult to assess. Written exams only give us a small indication of our students' competency.

Test scores from three separate semesters of physics classes were compared. In the first two semesters, the classes had a traditional review <b>day</b> <b>before</b> <b>the</b> <b>exam</b> and the lab practical was not used at all.

Describing his study habits as “messy” and comprised of “lots of big stages,” Larry first gathered his notes from classroom sessions and his review of the textbook and then made flashcards for key concepts from the course. He also completed the end-of-chapter quizzes in the text and reviewed (and retakes) any old quizzes or exams from the course. The <b>day</b> <b>before</b> <b>the</b> <b>exam,</b> he tells himself “Wow Larry, {{you really have to}} get to it now,” and he sequestered himself at the library to review his notes and difficult concepts in the textbook and to re-watch videotaped lectures from the course website. All along, he deliberately studied alone because he had to maximize the limited time available for studying, such that he “cannot afford to sit around and have people talk about other stuff.” After several hours in the library reviewing these materials, Larry generally felt ready for the exam. Altogether, in Larry’s case, studying is an act that is instigated by instructor’s cues (i.e., upcoming exam), informed by a folk theory of the mind, involves a variety of curricular resources, and is strongly influenced by his personal situation.|$|E
40|$|INTRODUCTION: Colonoscopy is the {{procedure}} {{of choice for}} the detection and ablation of small lesions o the colonic mucosa. A proper bowel cleansing is mandatory. So far several regimens have been proposed but rather none has shown a clear-cut advantage over the others. Aim {{of this study was}} to compare cleansing ability and patients' compliance of three oral regimens. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Two-hundred and seventy-three patients were block randomised into three groups. Group A (92 patients) received tablets containing senna 12 mg and Magnesium Sulphate 15 mg the day before colonoscopy. Group B (98 patients) received a Polyethylene Glycol-based solution of two litres plus 4 tablets of Bisacodyl the <b>day</b> <b>before</b> <b>the</b> <b>exam.</b> Group C (83 patients) received Sodium Phosphate 40 milliliters the day before and the day of colonoscopy. Results of 265 patients were available for the analysis. Eight patients were excluded because inability to follow prescription. The lower incidence of constipation in group C was not significant. The other parameters were homogeneously distributed in the three groups. RESULTS: The 79 patients of the group C achieved a better bowel cleansing as compared with the 90 of group A (p = 0. 0003) and the 96 of group B (p = 0. 034). Constipated patients had a significantly better cleansing with Sodium Phosphate preparation compared with senna plus Magnesium Sulphate (p = 0. 017), but not significantly better compared with Golytely solution. Compliance and rate of total colonoscopy performed were not statistically different in the three groups. CONCLUSIONS: Sodium Phosphate solution gave better bowel preparation, with the same compliance, than either senna or Polyethylene solution. In constipated patients Sodium Phosphate showed good efficacy resulting in good cleansing rates similar to that of non-constipated patients. The poor results obtained by Polyethylene were related to the little amount of solution taken even if associated to Bisacodyl...|$|E

40|$|Background: Web-based {{formative}} assessment tools have become widely recognized in medical education as valuable resources for self-directed learning. Objectives: To explore the educational value of {{formative assessment}} using online quizzes for kidney pathology learning in our renal pathophysiology course. Methods: Students were given unrestricted and optional access to quizzes. Performance on quizzed and non-quizzed materials {{of those who}} used (‘quizzers’) and {{did not use the}} tool (‘non-quizzers’) was compared. Frequency of tool usage was analyzed and satisfaction surveys were utilized {{at the end of the}} course. Results: In total, 82. 6 % of the students used quizzes. The greatest usage was observed on <b>the</b> <b>day</b> <b>before</b> <b>the</b> final <b>exam.</b> Students repeated interactive and more challenging quizzes more often. Average means between final exam scores for quizzed and unrelated materials were almost equal for ‘quizzers’ and ‘non-quizzers’, but ‘quizzers’ performed statistically better than ‘non-quizzers’ on both, quizzed (p= 0. 001) and non-quizzed (p= 0. 024) topics. In total, 89 % of surveyed students thought quizzes improved their learning experience in this course.

While the MOOCs were not mandatory, traditional remedial courses were required for those freshmen failing a diagnostic <b>exam.</b> <b>The</b> effects on 589 freshmen students were investigated. The data analysis shows that up to 16 % of the students were active in the MOOCs under study, mostly during <b>the</b> <b>days</b> <b>before</b> taking <b>the</b> diagnostic <b>exam</b> that preceded <b>the</b> traditional face-to-face remedial courses.

40|$|AIM: To {{examine the}} {{predictive}} factors of capsule endoscopy (CE) completion rate (CECR) including {{the effect of}} inpatient and outpatient status. METHODS: We identified 355 consecutive patients who completed CE at Rush University Medical Center between March 2003 and October 2005. Subjects for CE had either nothing by mouth or clear liquids for the afternoon and evening of <b>the</b> <b>day</b> <b>before</b> <b>the</b> procedure. CE <b>exams</b> were reviewed by two physicians who were unaware of the study hypotheses. After retrospective analysis, 21 cases were excluded due to capsule malfunction, prior gastric surgery, endoscopic capsule placement or insufficient data. Of <b>the</b> remaining 334 <b>exams</b> [264 out-patient (OP), 70 in-patient (IP) ], CE indications, findings, location of the patients [IP vs OP and intensive care unit (ICU) vs general medical floor (GMF) ] and gastrointestinal transit times were analyzed. Statistical analysis was completed using SPSS version 17 (Chicago, IL). Chi-square, t test or fisher exact-tests were used as appropriate. Multivariate logistic regression {{analysis was used to}} identify variables associated with incomplete CE <b>exams.</b> RESULTS: <b>The</b> mean age for the entire study population was 54. 7 years. Sixty-one percent of the study population was female, and gender was not different between IPs vs OPs (P = 0. 07). The overall incomplete CECR was 14 % in our study. Overt obscure gastrointestinal bleeding (OGB) was significantly more common for the IP CE (P = 0. 0001), while abdominal pain and assessment of IBD were more frequent indications for <b>the</b> OP CE <b>exams</b> (P = 0. 002 and P = 0. 01, respectively). Occult OGB was the most common indication and arteriovenous malformations were the most common finding both in the IPs and OPs. The capsule did not enter the small bowel (SB) in 6 / 70 IPs and 8 / 264 OPs (P = 0. 04). The capsule never reached the cecum in 31. 4 % (22 / 70) of IP vs 9. 5 % (25 / 264) of OP examinations (P 0. 05). Patient location (IP vs OP) and GTT were independent predictors of incomplete CE exams (P < 0. 001 and P = 0. 008, respectively). CONCLUSION: Incomplete CE is a multifactorial problem.
