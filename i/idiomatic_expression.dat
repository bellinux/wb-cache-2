The second and the third verses can be compared with an <b>idiomatic</b> <b>expression</b> whose literal sense is [...] "to dash into a frenzied countenance", meaning [...] "to fall into a frenzied or crazed exaltation". Vukota compared Bishop Danilo's exaltation with that of a witch or a vjedogonja when their spirit flew out of their body. It was thought that the witches held an assembly each year on 1 March, and the vjedogonje mostly flew during the long autumn nights, especially when strong winds blew. After Vukota's words, Bishop Danilo started as if from a dream.|$|E

English Education Department, Faculty of Tarbiyah and Teachers Training, Advisor : Hj. Noor Maulidiyah, MA. Keywords : Translation, <b>Idiomatic</b> <b>Expressions</b> This {{research}} {{analyzes the}} translation of <b>idiomatic</b> <b>expressions</b> in Lewis Carroll’s novel “Alice in wonderland” into “Alice di negeri ajaib” by Khairi Rumantati. The problems that should be answered in this research are: what are the <b>idiomatic</b> <b>expressions</b> found in Lewis Carroll’s novel “Alice in Wonderland “ translated into “Alice di Negeri Ajaib” by Khairi Rumantati ? and how are these <b>idiomatic</b> <b>expressions</b> translated into Indonesian ? Based on the statement of problem above, this research is supposed to know the <b>idiomatic</b> <b>expressions</b> are found in Lewis Carroll’s novel “Alice in Wonderland “ Into “Alice di Negeri Ajaib” by Khairi Rumantati and to know how these <b>idiomatic</b> <b>expressions</b> translated into Indonesian. This research includes subject and object. The subject {{of this research is}} Lewis Carroll’s Novel “Alice in Wonderland” and “Alice di Negeri Ajaib” by Khairi Rumantati, while the object of the research is <b>idiomatic</b> <b>expressions</b> found, and how are these <b>idiomatic</b> <b>expressions</b> translated into Indonesian. The this research has the following procedures in collecting data: the writer read the original book and compared to its translation, classifies <b>idiomatic</b> <b>expressions</b> are found in this novel. Data processing in this research is divided into five stages; they are reading, collecting, classifying all of those data, confirming and then analyzing all data. The result of the research denoted that there are 21 <b>idiomatic</b> <b>expressions</b> which are found in the novel. The <b>idiomatic</b> <b>expressions</b> in the novel are translated into Indonesian the following 4 strategies there are 1 (one) using an idiom of similar meaning and form, 4 (four) using an idiom of similar meaning but dissimilar form, 14 (fourteen) using paraphrase and 2 (two) using omission, which are existed in the novel...|$|R
40|$|The {{significance}} of idioms and <b>idiomatic</b> <b>expressions</b> in English {{can be understood}} from their appearance in all types of discourse ranging from every day conversations to scientific texts. So, the present study deals with the translation of idioms and <b>idiomatic</b> <b>expressions</b> from English into Persian focusing on the procedures involved. Baker's model (1992) which groups possible procedures into four strategies {{was chosen as the}} theoretical framework of this research. This study is an attempt to investigate strategies used in translating and also to find out which strategy is mostly used. To do so, a total number of 90 idioms and <b>idiomatic</b> <b>expressions</b> were extracted from three English novels. This study was carried out through a comparative study of idioms and <b>idiomatic</b> <b>expressions</b> from English into Persian. The findings of the research indicated that four strategies were used in translating idioms and <b>idiomatic</b> <b>expressions</b> and their frequency of being used is different and also it was revealed that most of the data were translated by paraphrase...|$|R
40|$|<b>Idiomatic</b> <b>expressions</b> are {{plentiful}} in everyday language, yet they remain mysterious, {{as it is}} not clear exactly how people learn and understand them. They are of special interest to linguists, psycholinguists, and lexicographers, mainly because of their syntactic and semantic idiosyncrasies as well as their unclear lexical status. Despite a great deal of research on the properties of idioms in the linguistics literature, there is not much agreement on which properties are characteristic of these expressions. Because of their peculiarities, <b>idiomatic</b> <b>expressions</b> have mostly been overlooked by researchers in computational linguistics. In this article, we look into the usefulness of some of the identified linguistic properties of idioms for their automatic recognition. Specifically, we develop statistical measures that each model a specific property of <b>idiomatic</b> <b>expressions</b> by looking at their actual usage patterns in text. We use these statistical measures in a type-based classification task where we automatically separate <b>idiomatic</b> <b>expressions</b> (expressions with a possible idiomatic interpretation) from similar-on-the-surface literal phrases (for which no idiomatic interpretation is possible). In addition, we use some of the measures in a token identification task where we distinguish idiomatic and literal usages of potentially <b>idiomatic</b> <b>expressions</b> in context. 1...|$|R

[...] Their lawyers stated that the circumstances of the case had revived the Soviet-era tradition of the show trial.

In the song, they invoked {{the name of the}} Virgin Mary, urging her to get rid of Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin and to [...] "become a feminist", claiming that she would support them in their protests. They alluded to close ties between the church and the KGB ("Black robes, golden epaulettes"), criticized the subservience of many Russians to the church ("Parishioners crawl bowing") and attacked the church's traditionalist views on women ("So as not to offend His Holiness, women must bear children and love"). They used the crude epithet [...] "Sran Gospodnya", which has been used to translate [...] "holy shit" [...] in Hollywood movies, but is rarely used in idiomatic Russian; it literally translates as [...] "shit of the Lord". They later explained [...] "It is an <b>idiomatic</b> <b>expression,</b> related to the previous verse – about the fusion of Moscow patriarchy and the government.

2500|$|Jihad (...) is an Islamic term {{referring}} to the religious duty of Muslims to maintain the religion. In Arabic, the word jihād is a noun meaning [...] "to strive, to apply oneself, to struggle, to persevere". A person engaged in jihad is called a mujahid, the plural of which is mujahideen (...) [...] The word jihad appears frequently in the Quran, often in the <b>idiomatic</b> <b>expression</b> [...] "striving {{in the way of}} God (al-jihad fi sabil Allah)", to refer to the act of striving to serve the purposes of God on this earth. According to the classical Sharia law manual of Shafi'i, Reliance of the Traveller, Jihad means to war against non-Muslims, and is etymologically derived from the word mujahada signifying warfare to establish the religion. Jihad is sometimes referred to as the sixth pillar of Islam, though it occupies no such official status. In Twelver Shi'a Islam, however, jihad is one of the ten Practices of the Religion.|$|E
2500|$|Jihad, an Islamic term, is a {{religious}} duty of Muslims. In Arabic, the word jihād translates as a noun meaning [...] "struggle". Jihad appears 41 times in the Quran and frequently in the <b>idiomatic</b> <b>expression</b> [...] "striving {{for the sake of}} God (al-jihad fi sabil Allah)". Jihad is an important religious duty for Muslims. A minority among the Sunni scholars sometimes refer to this duty as the sixth pillar of Islam, though it occupies no such official status. In Twelver Shi'a Islam, however, Jihad is one of the 10 Practices of the Religion. The Qur'an calls repeatedly for jihad, or holy war, against unbelievers, including, at times, Jews and Christians. Middle East historian Bernard Lewis argues that [...] "the overwhelming majority of classical theologians, jurists, and traditionalists (specialists in the hadith) understood the obligation of jihad in a military sense." [...] Furthermore, Lewis maintains that for most of the recorded history of Islam, from the lifetime of the Prophet Muhammad onward, the word jihad was used in a primarily military sense. According to Andrew Bostom, a number of jihads have targeted Christians, Hindus, and Jews.|$|E
40|$|The present thesis {{discusses}} {{a certain}} field of linguistics {{focusing on a}} cross-cultural comparative approach which is applied to investigating and analyzing <b>idiomatic</b> <b>expressions</b> in Russian and English. As a method of conducting the present research comparative linguistic analysis of <b>idiomatic</b> <b>expressions</b> involving nationality or ethnicity in English and Russian has been chosen. The chief aim of the thesis is to compare the etymology and semantics of idioms of Nationality and Ethnicity in Russian and English languages, and to make conclusions about the emotional colour of <b>idiomatic</b> <b>expressions</b> of different nationalities/ethnicities represented in these two languages. The hypothesis of the present BA thesis either to be proved or refuted is English and Russian languages demonstrate the negative attitude towards different nationalities/ethnicities represented in <b>idiomatic</b> <b>expressions.</b> The present paper consists of four parts: the introduction, two chapters and the conclusion...|$|R

In future Reginald might have every chance with his French. The mother decided to make luncheon, with the boy at table, a time set apart for French conversation. Philip, too, spoke the foreign tongue; and again Isabel planned for Reginald's liberal education. And she meant to study herself, {{by the side of}} a talented husband. How full life promised to become. But with every consistent hope her own ambition was subordinate to love. To love, to be loved by Philip, by Reginald, by friends, constituted the little world she longed to conquer. And to-night, she wished to shine at the ball, not as a woman evoking admiration from the crowd, but as Philip's wife. If she might help to bring him fresh power she was satisfied. Nor did Isabel deny her own evident advantage. She was too familiar with standards of beauty not to be glad of a rich inheritance; yet in all her life she had never been vain. For to be vain is to be selfish, pinned upon a revolving, personal pivot. Isabel had always thought first of others. To-day her mind was full of schemes for Philip, for Reginald, and for old madame. If Philip agreed she wished to live permanently in California. She had already put her closed house in the West on the market. The city which had once been home no longer claimed her interest. And Philip must never go back to the scene of his past humiliation. She reached for a traveling portfolio and began to write to Reginald. Here and there she pasted bright pictures to illustrate a little story which would be sure to delight her boy. When she had finished she dashed off a letter in French to madame; then, fearing that Philip might be late, she laid out his dinner clothes. She was not in need of companionship, and a couch close to the wide window facing the sea lured her. She would rest. Waves splashed a rhythm of contentment. Out beyond the breakers a buoy creaked in vain, for her nerves were as sound as her boy's. She did not mind the incessant grind. She was happy--satisfied.|$|E
