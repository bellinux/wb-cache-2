5|$|After Eleanor's marriage, {{many of her}} Savoyard {{relatives}} <b>joined</b> <b>her</b> in England. At least 170 Savoyards {{arrived in}} England after 1236, coming from Savoy, Burgundy and Flanders, including Eleanor's uncles: Boniface became the Archbishop of Canterbury, and William became Henry's chief adviser for a short period. Henry arranged marriages {{for many of them}} into the English nobility, a practice that initially caused friction with the English barons, who resisted landed estates passing into the hands of foreigners. The Savoyards were careful not to exacerbate the situation and became increasingly integrated into English baronial society, forming an important power base for Eleanor in England.|$|E

The marriage was never made official in Italy.|$|E

After Alfonsina's death in 1520, Catherine <b>joined</b> <b>her</b> cousins and was raised by her aunt, Clarice Strozzi. The death of Pope Leo in 1521 briefly interrupted Medici power until Cardinal Giulio de' Medici was elected Pope Clement VII in 1523. Clement housed Catherine in the Palazzo Medici Riccardi in Florence, where she lived in state. The Florentine people called her duchessina ("the little duchess"), in deference to her unrecognised claim to the Duchy of Urbino.|$|E

Left in Dublin with his father, Shaw compensated {{for the absence of}} music in the house by teaching himself to play the piano.|$|E

5|$|On {{his return}} to England Bellingham spent six months in London, seeking {{compensation}} for the imprisonment and financial losses he had suffered in Russia. He considered the British authorities were responsible, through their neglect of his repeated requests for help. Successively he petitioned the Foreign Office, the Treasury, the Privy Council, and Perceval himself; in each case his claims were politely rejected. Defeated and exhausted, in May 1811 Bellingham accepted his wife's ultimatum to abandon his campaign or otherwise lose her and his family. He <b>joined</b> <b>her</b> in Liverpool to begin life afresh.|$|E
