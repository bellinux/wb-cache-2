50|$|Over {{the last}} decade, SEGESA and the {{government}} have implemented a range of generation, transmission and distribution projects {{to ensure that the}} country no longer suffers power outages. The power grid in Equatorial Guinea is divided in two parts: the island grid (Malabo, Bioko Island) and the continental grid (Bata, Rio Muni). The high voltage power grid in the Rio Muni region has allowed the government to invest in <b>interconnection</b> <b>points</b> with Gabon and Cameroon.|$|R
30|$|Generally, the {{gas network}} {{consists}} of gas wells, gas pipelines, gas compressors, <b>interconnection</b> <b>points,</b> gas storage stations and gas loads [26]. Natural gas is injected from gas wells and flows through pipelines, and then {{delivered to the}} gas loads. The gas compressors are installed to compensate the pressure loss due to the friction of pipelines. The gas storage stations, which provide a buffer to coordinate the usage of gas during multiple periods, are not taken into consideration in this paper.|$|R
5000|$|The {{goal of the}} CIX was to be an {{independent}} <b>interconnection</b> <b>point</b> with no U.S. government-defined [...] "acceptable use policy" [...] on the traffic that could be exchanged; and just as critical, a [...] "no-settlement" [...] policy between the parties exchanging traffic. The no-settlement policy became a [...] "given" [...] during the modern era of the Internet, but was immensely controversial at the time.|$|E

5000|$|The {{incumbent}} operators {{had previously}} approached the country's PMO to reiterate their stance they [...] "are {{in no way}} obliged or in any position to entertain Jio's requests for <b>interconnection</b> <b>points</b> as {{they do not have}} either the network or the financial resources to terminate the latter's humongous volumes of potentially asymmetric voice traffic." [...] Responding to this, Mukesh Ambani, owner of Jio, said, [...] "All operators have publicly said last week that they will provide this (interconnect and MNP). So, we are waiting. These are all great companies. They have their own reputations to protect. I am confident they won't violate the law." [...] Commenting about number portability, he added, [...] "The number belongs to the consumer. No operator can cause trouble if they want to change operators." [...] However, on 12 September 2016, Idea Cellular agreed to allow Jio to use 196 of its <b>interconnection</b> access <b>points.</b>|$|R
30|$|Due to the {{inconsistent}} {{nature of}} the wave impedance for various power apparatuses and the reflection and refraction characteristics of their <b>interconnection</b> <b>points,</b> the fault transients contain abundant information about the fault location and type. By correct analysis and the full utilization of such information {{it is possible to}} construct ultra high speed and highly sensitive AC, DC and busbar main protection. In addition faulty line selection for neutral non-effective earth systems using transient characteristics offers high sensitivity and reliability that is not influenced by the ways of neutral compensation.|$|R
50|$|Networks {{that speak}} BGP {{to each other}} can engage in multi exit {{discriminator}} exchange with each other, although most do not. When networks interconnect in several locations, MEDs {{can be used to}} reference that network's interior gateway protocol cost. This results in both networks sharing the burden of transporting each other's traffic on their own network (or cold potato). Hot-potato or nearest-exit routing, which is typically the normal behavior on the Internet, is where traffic destined to another network is delivered to the closest <b>interconnection</b> <b>point.</b>|$|E
5000|$|The project’s planned <b>interconnection</b> <b>point</b> is the IPP {{switchyard}} {{which is}} a point of delivery for the Los Angeles, Anaheim, Riverside, Pasadena, Glendale and Burbank utilities.

50|$|In 1990, the ARPANET was {{formally}} terminated. In 1991 the NSF began to relax its restrictions on commercial use on NSFNET and commercial network providers began to interconnect. The final restrictions on carrying commercial traffic ended on 30 April 1995, when the NSF ended its {{sponsorship of the}} NSFNET Backbone Service and the service ended. Today almost all Internet infrastructure in the United States, and large portion in other countries, is provided and owned by the private sector. Traffic is exchanged between these networks, at major <b>interconnection</b> <b>points,</b> in accordance with established Internet standards and commercial agreements.|$|R
40|$|For {{many good}} reasons {{there is growing}} {{interest}} in ways to allow parallel processing of multibody dynamics problems. Some recent approaches include “Domain Decomposition” and “Divide and Conquer”. This paper explores a new approach, reported as work in progress, with initial, promising results.
