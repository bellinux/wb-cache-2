40|$|Abstract: Commonly, dynamic line rating (DLR) calculates {{conductor}} temperature {{with a basic}} energy balance equation, which assumes homogeneous {{conductor temperature}}. With this 0 D temperature assumption, however, {{there is a risk}} that inner layers of the conductor might exceed the limit temperature, if the rating current approaches its ampacity. Since conductor overheating should be avoided for operational safety, it is valuable to investigate radial temperature distributions of conductors. Throughout this study, therefore, homogeneous 1 D conductor model with a radial temperature distribution is simulated in steady and transient states. For steady state simulations, radial temperature distributions under various ambient conditions are studied. Higher wind velocity, lower solar radiation, and lower ambient temperature make the temperature gradients more pronounced. Also, transient temperature distribution is modeled with a various stepwise current changes. When the core temperature reaches 80 °C, momentous radial temperature distributions are analyzed. Compared to the steady state, transient phases show smaller temperature differences between core and surface. Both lower initial and higher <b>final</b> <b>currents</b> result in a flatter radial temperature distribution, whereas higher <b>final</b> <b>currents</b> cause faster transient heating. Compared to 0 D calculations, the 1 D model with a radial temperature distribution reduces the ampacity and prevents conductor core overheating...|$|R

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. In this work a new measurement technique for current mapping of photovoltaic (PV) devices is developed, utilising the compressed sensing (CS) sampling theory. Conventional current mapping measurements of PV devices are realised using the light beam induced current (LBIC) measurement method. For its realization, a light beam scans a PV device and the induced current is measured for every point, generating the <b>final</b> <b>current</b> map of the device. Disadvantages of the LBIC method are the low measurement speed, the complicated and usually expensive measurement layouts and the impractical application of the method on PV modules. With the development of CS current mapping in this work, the above issues can be mitigated. Instead of applying a raster scan, a series of illumination patterns are projected onto the PV sample, acquiring fewer measurements than the pixels of the <b>final</b> <b>current</b> map. The final reconstruction of the current map is achieved {{by means of an}} optimisation algorithm. Spatially resolved electrical simulations of CS current mapping demonstrate that theoretically the proposed method is feasible. In addition, it is shown that current maps can be acquired with even 40...|$|E
40|$|We have {{investigated}} the influence of electrode material and crystallographic structure on electron transfer and biofilm formation of Geobacter sulfurreducens. Single-crystal gold - Au(110), Au(111), Au(210) - and platinum - Pt(100), Pt(110), Pt(111), Pt(210) - electrodes were tested and compared to graphite rods. G. sulfurreducens electrochemically interacts with all these materials with different attachment kinetics and <b>final</b> <b>current</b> production, although redox species involved in the electron transfer to the anode are virtually the same in all cases. Initial bacterial colonization was fastest on graphite up to the monolayer level, whereas gold electrodes led to higher <b>final</b> <b>current</b> densities. Crystal geometry showed to have an important influence, with Au(210) sustaining a current density of up to 1442 (± 101) μA cm- 2 at the steady state, over Au(111) with 961 (± 94) μA cm- 2 and Au(110) with 944 (± 89) μA cm- 2. On the other hand, the platinum electrodes displayed the lowest performances, including Pt(210).
