Besides the change in topography, LbL is used to generate a polyelectrolyte multilayer (PEM) system consisting of heparin (HEP) and poly(ethylene imine) (PEI) on top of the gold dots. The localized formation of PEM on gold dots is achieved by prior passivation of the surrounding silicon or glass surface. Properties of PEM are changed by adjusting the pH value of HEP solution to either acidic or alkaline values. Studies with human dermal fibroblasts (HDF) reveal that cells spread to a higher extent on PEM formed at pH 5. 0 in dependence on the structure dimension.

In cell culture, CD 133 + HSC transformed into Î±-smooth muscle actin positive myofibroblast-like cells, whereas application of cytokines known to facilitate EPC differentiation into endothelial cells led to the formation of branched tube-like structures and induced expression of the endothelial cell markers endothelial nitric oxide synthase and vascular-endothelial cadherin.

In such concentrated CFU C suspensions, a cell, morphologically identical with the hemopoietic stem cell in the mouse (MSCLC, mouse stem cell like cell) was frequently observed, using a May Grunwald Giemsa (MGG) staining method and electron microscope techniques. In MGG stained preparations, the MSCLC superficially resembles the small lymphocyte; therefore, a staining method has been described, the polychrome procedure, by which both cell populations could be clearly distinguished. Since a fair correlation exists between the number of MSCLC and the number of CFU C in a variety of primate hemopoietic suspensions, it is concluded that the MSCLC might be a good candidate for being the HSC in monkeys and man.

40|$|Stem {{cell biology}} has {{experienced}} explosive {{growth over the}} past decade as researchers attempt to generate therapeutically relevant cell types in the laboratory. Recapitulation of endogenous developmental trajectories is a dominant paradigm in the design of directed differentiation protocols, and attempts to <b>guide</b> <b>stem</b> cell differentiation are often based explicitly on knowledge of in vivo development.

The complex and dynamic nature of the process has hindered studies aimed at delineatingmorphogeneticmechanisms in vivo, particularly in mammals. Recent demonstrations of stem cell-driven tissue assembly in culture offer a powerful new tool for modeling and dissecting organogenesis. However, despite the highly organotypic nature of stem cell-derived tissues, substantial differences set themapart from their in vivo counterparts, probablyowing to thealteredmicroenvironment inwhich they reside and the lack of mesenchymal influences.

40|$|The {{importance}} of epigenetic regulation for main-tenance of {{embryonic stem cell}} (ESC) pluripotency or for initiation of differentiation is widely accepted. However, the molecular mechanisms are poorly un-derstood. We recently reported that a hypoxic mi-croenvironment induces ESC differentiation. In the present study, we found that hypoxia-responsive hi-stone deacetylase 6 (HDAC 6) performs an essen-tial signaling function for myogenic differentiation of ESCs. HDAC 6 was downregulated in hypoxic ESCs or during differentiation. A knock-down of HDAC 6 in ESCs resulted in induction of myogenic markers, including Pax 7. Suppression of HDAC 6 increased acetylation of core histones H 3 and H 4, leading to enhanced binding of RNA polymerase II to the Pax 7 promoter. Transplantation of HDAC 6 knock-down cells facilitated muscle regeneration in vivo. Importantly, the downregulation of HDAC 6 by hy-poxia was not mediated by HIF 1 or HIF 2, mas-ter transcription regulators under hypoxia, but by in-duction of microRNA- 26 a that directly targeted the 3 â€²-untranslated region (3 â€²-UTR) of HDAC 6. A point mutation of the microRNA- 26 a-binding sequence in the HDAC 6 3 â€²-UTR diminished the luciferase reporter activity.

30|$|While the {{mechanism}} is still unclear, hydrophilicity, surface functionality, roughness, surface area, and nanotopographical {{features such as}} ripples were proposed to be the reasons for such enhanced adhesion. Loh et al. reported the chemical roles of graphene and graphene oxide (GO) in <b>guiding</b> <b>stem</b> cells towards specific cell lineages. They suggested that the strong noncovalent binding towards osteogenic inducers of graphene make it act as a preconcentration platform for enhanced osteogenesis [43]. They also found that differentiation into adipocytes was suppressed on graphene-based scaffolds as insulin, a key adipogenic growth factor, was denatured through the Ï€â€“Ï€ interaction on graphene scaffold. GO, on the other hand, did {{not interfere with the}} adipogenesis because they bind with insulin through electrostatic interaction. For chondrogenic differentiation, Lim et al. fabricated a cell-assembled graphene 3 D biocomposite and showed enhanced chondrogenic differentiation [19]. Kim et al. later discovered that GO plays a dual role, both as an excellent cell-adhesion substrate but also as a growth factor protein preconcentration platform during the chondrogenic differentiation process [41]. In contrast to the conventional chondrogenic pellet culturing and differentiation of MSCs, the incorporation of GO preloaded with transforming growth factor-Î² 3 (TGF-Î² 3) can overcome the diffusion limitation of TGF-Î² 3 that occurs inside the pellet. Chondrogenic marker, SOX- 9, and Aggrecan expression were enhanced more than twofold and threefold respectively compared to the control group. Among the different types of stem cell differentiation, preliminary investigation on the graphene-based scaffolds for osteogenesis and neurogenesis has been conducted in vivo, confirming their high biocompatibility and promising applications in tissue engineering.|$|R

Up to date, various micro-/nanofabrication technologies {{have been used to}} <b>guide</b> <b>stem</b> cells to develop into 3 D biodegradable scaffolds [82, 83]. Nanostructured scaffolds are designed to trigger stem cells to become specific cell types compromising the tissues and organs in the body. Inside these scaffolds, cells deposit their own matrix and as the scaffold degrades, they form a 3 D tissue structure that mimics the bodyâ€™s natural tissues. For example, Gelain et al. [84] reported that they had developed a 3 D cell culture system using a designer peptide nanofiber scaffold with mouse adult neural stem cells. They synthesized 18 different peptides which directly incorporate various functional motifs to promote cell adhesion, differentiation, and bone marrow homing activities. These functionalized peptides self-assemble into nanofiber scaffolds where cells can be fully embedded by the scaffold in 3 D. Without addition of soluble growth factors and neurotrophic factors, two of these scaffolds functionalized with bone marrow homing motifs not only significantly enhanced survival of the neural stem cells, but also promoted differentiation toward cells expressing neuronal and glial markers.|$|E

In this thesis, the author develops a series of versatile techniques, including polymer self-assembly and novel emulsification methods, to simultaneously control the physical and chemical structure of spheres.
