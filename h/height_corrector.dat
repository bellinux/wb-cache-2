50|$|Later models {{added the}} Micklethwait <b>Height</b> <b>Corrector,</b> which allowed the posts to measure {{altitude}} with some accuracy and thus {{improve the quality}} of the measurements. The ROC also developed a methodology that allowed the Post Instrument to be used to produce measurements purely by sound, but it is unclear how often this was used.|$|E
5000|$|The C5 had {{a further}} {{development}} of Citroën's hydropneumatic suspension, now called Hydractive 3. The major change with this system {{was the use of}} electronic sensors to replace the mechanical <b>height</b> <b>correctors</b> seen in all previous hydropneumatic cars. This allowed the suspension computer to automatically control ride height: at high speed the suspension is lowered to reduce drag and at low speeds on bumpy roads the ride height is raised.|$|R
5000|$|Hydraulically {{actuated}} suspensions {{are controlled}} {{with the use}} of hydraulics. The first example appeared in 1954, with the Hydropneumatic suspension developed by Paul Magès at Citroën. The hydraulic pressure is supplied by a high pressure radial piston hydraulic pump. Sensors continually monitor body movement and vehicle ride level, constantly supplying the hydraulic <b>height</b> <b>correctors</b> with new data. In {{a matter of a few}} seconds, the suspension generates counter forces to raise or lower the body. During driving maneuvers, the encased nitrogen compresses instantly, offering six times the compressibility of the steel springs used by vehicles up to this time.|$|R
50|$|Wartime {{models were}} {{modified}} in 1940 with the Micklethwait <b>Height</b> <b>Corrector,</b> {{named for its}} inventor, Eric Walter Eustace Micklethwait. Micklethwait was an observer at the Gower Street Post {{on the roof of}} a building at University of London, near Euston Square tube station. Formerly a patent clerk, he devised the Corrector and quickly patented it.|$|E
50|$|The whole high {{pressure}} {{part of the system}} is manufactured from steel tubing of small diameter, connected to valve control units by Lockheed type pipe unions with special seals made from desmopan rubber, a type of rubber compatible with the LHM fluid. The moving parts of the system (e.g., suspension strut or steering ram) are sealed by contact seals between the cylinder and piston for tightness under pressure. The other plastic/rubber parts are return tubes from valves such as the brake control or <b>height</b> <b>corrector</b> valves, also catching seeping fluid around the suspension push-rods. <b>Height</b> <b>corrector,</b> brake master valve and steering valve spools, and hydraulic pump pistons have extremely small clearances (1-3 micrometres) with their cylinders, permitting only a very low leakage rate. The metal and alloy parts of the system rarely fail even after excessively high mileages but the rubber components (especially those exposed to the air) can harden and leak, typical failure points for the system.|$|E
50|$|Pressure {{flows from}} the {{hydraulic}} circuit to the suspension cylinders, pressurizing the bottom part of the spheres and suspension cylinders. Suspension works {{by means of a}} piston forcing LHM into the sphere, compacting the nitrogen in {{the upper part of the}} sphere; damping is provided by a two-way 'leaf valve' in the opening of the sphere. LHM has to squeeze back and forth through this valve which causes resistance and controls the suspension movements. It is the simplest damper and one of the most efficient. Ride height correction (self levelling) is achieved by <b>height</b> <b>corrector</b> valves connected to the anti-roll bar, front and rear. When the car is too low, the <b>height</b> <b>corrector</b> valve opens to allow more fluid into the suspension cylinder (e.g., the car is loaded). When the car is too high (e.g. after unloading) fluid is returned to the system reservoir via low-pressure return lines. Height correctors act with some delay in order not to correct regular suspension movements. The rear brakes are powered from the rear suspension circuit. Because the pressure there is proportional to the load, so is the braking power.|$|E
5000|$|In a {{hydropneumatic}} suspension system, each wheel is connected, {{not to a}} spring, but to a hydraulic suspension unit consisting of a hydraulic accumulator sphere of about 12 cm in diameter containing pressurised nitrogen, a cylinder containing hydraulic fluid screwed to the suspension sphere, a piston inside the cylinder connected by levers to the suspension itself, and a damper valve between the piston and the sphere. A membrane in the sphere prevented the nitrogen from escaping. The motion of the wheels translated to a motion of the piston, which acted on the oil in the nitrogen cushion and provided the spring effect. The damper valve took place of the shock absorber in conventional suspensions. The hydraulic cylinder was fed with hydraulic fluid from the main pressure reservoir via a <b>height</b> <b>corrector,</b> a valve controlled by the mid-position of the anti-roll bar connected to the axle. If the suspension was too low, the <b>height</b> <b>corrector</b> introduced high-pressure fluid; if it was too high, it released fluid back to the fluid reservoir. In this manner, a constant ride height was maintained. A control in the cabin allowed the driver to select one of five heights: normal riding height, two slightly higher riding heights for poor terrain, and two extreme positions for changing wheels. (The correct term, oleopneumatic (oil-air), has never gained widespread use. Hydropneumatic (water-air) continues to be preferred overwhelmingly.) ...|$|E
5000|$|The Series 2 {{vehicles}} (1985-91) can {{be distinguished}} {{by the use of}} plastic bumpers. The cars lost some of their earlier distinctiveness, but maintained the [...] "stalk-free" [...] layout, where turn signals, wiper controls, horn and headlights could be operated by the driver's fingertips while his/her hands remained on the steering wheel. The suspension became stiffer in most models, with arguably a more aggressive look, as opposed to the more elegant Series 1 design. Although the dashboard retained the [...] "pod" [...] housing for the instrumentation, it lost the revolving-drum instruments and received a sloping centre dash area, and the radio moved to a position sideways and between the front seats, with the <b>height</b> <b>corrector</b> and heating controls moving to the centre console.|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} {{different}} gravimetric geoid {{models have been}} evaluated: on a regional bases utilising the Swedish GPS reference network SWEPOS; and locally, in a specific research area utilising the results from a GPS campaign conducted in the area. The research area is situated in central Sweden having a size of approximately 100 x 300 km. In the area GPS measurements (with average baseline length of 13 km) have been conducted at well established benchmarks with known orthometric heights. To find out if a geometric geoid model, based on the GPS measurements, {{would be a better}} <b>height</b> <b>corrector</b> surface for the research area than the gravimetric geoid models, such a model has been computed with geostatistical methods, i. e. universal kriging. The model has been experimentally evaluated utilising a Swedish GPS campaign called RIX 95. It was found, when the geometric geoid model is used, that the absolute accuracy of GPS levelling is ± 14 mm and the relative accuracy ± 10 mm (on a 10 km long baseline). It is concluded that the geometric geoid model is the best <b>height</b> <b>corrector</b> surface for the research area among the studied models. CONTAC...|$|E
