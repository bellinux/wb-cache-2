After binding ApoER2, ApoE is taken up into the cell and may remain in the <b>intracellular</b> <b>space,</b> be shipped to the cell surface, or be degraded. ApoE binding leads to the cleavage of ApoER2 into secreted proteins by the actions of the plasma membrane protein gamma secretase.

5|$|Multinucleated cells contain {{multiple}} nuclei. Most acantharean {{species of}} protozoa and some fungi in mycorrhizae have naturally multinucleated cells. Other {{examples include the}} intestinal parasites in the genus Giardia, which have two nuclei per cell. In humans, skeletal muscle cells, called myocytes and syncytium, become multinucleated during development; the resulting arrangement of nuclei near {{the periphery of the}} cells allows maximal <b>intracellular</b> <b>space</b> for myofibrils. Multinucleated and binucleated cells can also be abnormal in humans; for example, cells arising from the fusion of monocytes and macrophages, known as giant multinucleated cells, sometimes accompany inflammation and are also implicated in tumor formation.|$|E
25|$|Whole-cell {{recordings}} involve recording currents {{through multiple}} channels simultaneously, over the membrane {{of the entire}} cell. The electrode is left in place on the cell, as in cell-attached recordings, but more suction is applied to rupture the membrane patch, thus providing access from {{the interior of the}} pipette to the <b>intracellular</b> <b>space</b> of the cell. This provides a means to administer and study how treatments (ex. drugs) can affect cells in real time. Once the pipette is attached to the cell membrane, there are two methods of breaking the patch. The first is by applying more suction. The amount and duration of this suction depends on the type of cell and size of the pipette. The other method requires a large current pulse to be sent through the pipette. How much current is applied and the duration of the pulse also depend on the type of cell. For some types of cells, it is convenient to apply both methods simultaneously to break the patch.|$|E

In this study, a 1 -D monodomain computer model that incorporated local heterogeneity in both the interstitial and <b>intracellular</b> <b>spaces</b> was used to investigate whether increased interstitial resistivity could modulate the escape of premature beats given at different coupling intervals. Our simulations show that locally increasing the effective interstitial resistivity (oeff) reduces both the conduction delay and the dispersion of repolarization at {{the boundary between the}} poorly-coupled and well-coupled regions. Increasing oeff also decreases the dependence of the conduction delay on the coupling beat interval. The interaction between microheterogeneity in the interstitial and <b>intracellular</b> <b>spaces</b> may increase the likelihood that premature ectopic beats will escape and trigger an arrhyhmia. 1...|$|R
2500|$|Osmotherapy {{is the use}} of osmotically active {{substances}} to reduce the volume of intracranial contents. Osmotherapy serves as the primary medical [...] treatment for cerebral edema. The primary purpose of osmotherapy is to improve elasticity and decrease intracranial volume by removing free water, accumulated as a result of cerebral edema, from brain's extracellular and <b>intracellular</b> <b>space</b> into vascular compartment by creating an osmotic gradient between the blood and brain. Normal serum osmolality ranges from 280-290 mOsm/kg and serum osmolality to cause water removal from brain without much side effects ranges from 300-320 mOsm/kg. Usually, 90 mL of space is created in the intracranial vault by 1.6% reduction in brain water content. Osmotherapy has cerebral [...] dehydrating effects. The main goal of osmotherapy is to decrease intracranial pressure(ICP) by shifting excess fluid from brain. This is accomplished by intravenous administration of osmotic agents which increase serum osmolality in order to shift excess fluid from intracellular or extracellular space of the brain to intravascular compartment. The resulting brain shrinkage effectively [...] reduces intracranial volume and decreases ICP.|$|E

50|$|A major {{contribution}} to establishing the membrane potential {{is made by}} the sodium-potassium pump. This is a complex of proteins embedded in the membrane that derives energy from ATP in order to transport sodium and potassium ions across the membrane. On each cycle, the pump exchanges three Na+ ions from the <b>intracellular</b> <b>space</b> for two K+ ions from the extracellular space. If the numbers of each type of ion were equal, the pump would be electrically neutral, but, because of the three-for-two exchange, it gives a net movement of one positive charge from intracellular to extracellular for each cycle, thereby contributing to a positive voltage difference. The pump has three effects: (1) it makes the sodium concentration high in the extracellular space and low in the intracellular space; (2) it makes the potassium concentration high in the <b>intracellular</b> <b>space</b> and low in the extracellular space; (3) it gives the <b>intracellular</b> <b>space</b> a negative voltage {{with respect to the}} extracellular space.|$|E
