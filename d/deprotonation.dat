5|$|Imidazol-2-ylidenes and dihydroimidazol-2-ylidenes, e.g. IMes, {{have been}} {{prepared}} by the <b>deprotonation</b> of the respective imidazolium and dihydroimidazolium salts. The acyclic carbenes and the tetrahydropyrimidinyl based carbenes were prepared by <b>deprotonation</b> using strong homogeneous bases.|$|E
5|$|Lithium amides {{like the}} diisopropylamide (LDA) and the (tetramethylpiperidide (LiTMP)) {{generally}} {{work well for}} the <b>deprotonation</b> {{of all types of}} salts, providing that not too much LiOH is present in the n-butyllithium used to make the lithium amide. Titration of lithium amide can be used to determine the amount of hydroxide in solution. The <b>deprotonation</b> of precursor salts with metal hexamethyldisilazides works very cleanly for the <b>deprotonation</b> of all types of salts, except for unhindered formamidinium salts, where this base can act as a nucleophile to give a triaminomethane adduct.|$|E
5|$|Shown {{right is}} an X-ray {{structure}} showing a complex between a diaminocarbene and potassium HMDS. This complex was formed when excess KHMDS {{was used as}} a strong base to deprotonate the formamidinium salt. Removing lithium ions resulting from <b>deprotonation</b> with reagents such as LDA can be especially problematic. Potassium and sodium salt by-products tend to precipitate from solution and can be removed. Lithium ions may be chemically removed by binding to species such as cryptands or crown ethers.|$|E
5|$|The Horner–Wadsworth–Emmons {{reaction}} {{begins with}} the <b>deprotonation</b> of the phosphonate to give the phosphonate carbanion 1. Nucleophilic addition of the carbanion onto the aldehyde 2 (or ketone) producing 3a or 3b is the rate-limiting step. If R2 = H, then intermediates 3a and 4a and intermediates 3b and 4b can interconvert with each other. The final elimination of 4a and 4b yield (E)-alkene 5 and (Z)-alkene 6.|$|E
5|$|The base is most {{commonly}} histidine since its pKa allows for effective base catalysis, hydrogen bonding to the acid residue, and <b>deprotonation</b> of the nucleophile residue. β-lactamases such as TEM-1 use a lysine residue as the base. Because lysine's pKa {{is so high}} (pKa=11), a glutamate and several other residues act as the acid to stabilise its deprotonated state during the catalytic cycle. Threonine proteases use their N-terminal amide as the base, since steric crowding by the catalytic threonine's methyl prevents other residues from being close enough.|$|E
5|$|The {{mechanism}} of proteolysis by the β subunits of the 20S core particle {{is through a}} threonine-dependent nucleophilic attack. This mechanism may depend on an associated water molecule for <b>deprotonation</b> of the reactive threonine hydroxyl. Degradation occurs within the central chamber formed by the association of the two β rings and normally does not release partially degraded products, instead reducing the substrate to short polypeptides typically 7–9 residues long, though they can range from 4 to 25 residues, depending on the organism and substrate. The biochemical mechanism that determines product length is not fully characterized. Although the three catalytic β subunits have a common mechanism, they have slightly different substrate specificities, which are considered chymotrypsin-like, trypsin-like, and peptidyl-glutamyl peptide-hydrolyzing (PHGH)-like. These variations in specificity {{are the result of}} interatomic contacts with local residues near the active sites of each subunit. Each catalytic β subunit also possesses a conserved lysine residue required for proteolysis.|$|E
5|$|Use {{of oxygen}} or sulphur as the {{nucleophilic}} atom causes minor differences in catalysis. Compared to oxygen, sulphur’s extra d orbital makes it larger (by 0.4 Å) and softer, {{allows it to}} form longer bonds (dC-X and dX-H by 1.3-fold), and gives it a lower pKa (by 5 units). Serine is therefore more dependent than cysteine on optimal orientation of the acid-base triad members to reduce its pKa {{in order to achieve}} concerted <b>deprotonation</b> with catalysis. The low pKa of cysteine works to its disadvantage in the resolution of the first tetrahedral intermediate as unproductive reversal of the original nucleophilic attack is the more favourable breakdown product. The triad base is therefore preferentially oriented to protonate the leaving group amide to ensure that it is ejected to leave the enzyme sulphur covalently bound to the substrate N-terminus. Finally, resolution of the acyl-enzyme (to release the substrate C-terminus) requires serine to be re-protonated whereas cysteine can leave as S−. Sterically, the sulphur of cysteine also forms longer bonds and has a bulkier van der Waals radius and if mutated to serine can be trapped in unproductive orientations in the active site.|$|E
25|$|Alcohols {{behave as}} weak acids, {{undergoing}} <b>deprotonation,</b> but strong bases are required. The <b>deprotonation</b> reaction {{to produce an}} alkoxide salt is performed with a strong base such as sodium hydride or sodium metal.|$|E

25|$|It is a {{two-step process}} of elimination: {{ionization}} and <b>deprotonation.</b>|$|E
25|$|N-3 {{protonation}} of adenine by Arg180 allows <b>deprotonation</b> of {{a nearby}} water molecule.|$|E
25|$|In most cases, both {{mechanisms}} {{will lead}} to the same product, as the sites of kinetic and thermodynamic <b>deprotonation</b> will coincide.|$|E
25|$|There {{is another}} aspect of aldol {{reaction}} that {{is influenced by the}} allylic strain. On the second aldol reaction, the product which is a 1,3 dicarbonyl is formed in high diastereoselectivity. This is because the acidity of the proton is significantly reduced because for the <b>deprotonation</b> to occur, it will {{have to go through a}} developing allylic strain in the unfavored conformation. In the favored conformation, the proton is not aligned properly for <b>deprotonation</b> to occur.|$|E
25|$|For ketones, most enolization {{conditions}} give Z enolates. For esters, most enolization conditions give E enolates. The {{addition of}} HMPA {{is known to}} reverse the stereoselectivity of <b>deprotonation.</b>|$|E
25|$|An ammine ligand {{bound to}} a metal ion is {{markedly}} more acidic than a free ammonia molecule, although <b>deprotonation</b> {{in aqueous solution}} is still rare. One example is the Calomel reaction, where the resulting amidomercury(II) compound is highly insoluble.|$|E
25|$|The {{reaction}} mechanism occurs by initial {{formation of an}} iminium ion (2) followed by electrophilic addition at the 3-position, {{in accordance with the}} expected nucleophilicity of indoles, to give the spirocycle 3. After migration of the best migrating group, <b>deprotonation</b> gives the product (5).|$|E
25|$|On {{treatment}} with two equivalents of n-buLi, lithium halogen exchange and <b>deprotonation</b> yields a lithium acetylide species that undergoes hydrolysis to yield the terminal alkyne product (scheme 12). More recently, a one-pot synthesis using a modified procedure has been developed. This synthetic transformation {{has been proven}} successful in the total synthesis (+)-taylorione by W.J. Kerr and co-workers (scheme 13).|$|E
25|$|The {{resulting}} ubiquinol localized to {{the membrane}} domain interacts with negatively charged residues in the membrane arm, stabilizing conformational changes. An antiporter mechanism (Na+/H+ swap) {{has been proposed}} using evidence of conserved Asp residues in the membrane arm. The presence of Lys, Glu, and His residues enable for proton gating (a protonation followed by <b>deprotonation</b> event across the membrane) driven by the pKa of the residues.|$|E
25|$|The {{reaction}} mechanism sequence is <b>deprotonation</b> of the amine, coordination of the amine to the copper(II), transmetallation (transferring the alkyl boron group to copper and the copper acetate group to boron), oxidation of Cu(II) to Cu(III) by oxygen and finally reductive elimination of Cu(III) to Cu(I) with {{formation of the}} product. Direct reductive elimination of Cu(II) to Cu(0) also takes place but is very slow. In catalytic systems oxygen also regenerates the Cu(II) catalyst.|$|E
25|$|Stronger acids have {{a larger}} acid {{dissociation}} constant (Ka) and a smaller logarithmic constant (pKa=logKa) than weaker acids. The stronger an acid is, the more easily it loses a proton, H+. Two key {{factors that contribute to}} the ease of <b>deprotonation</b> are the polarity of the H—A bond and the size of atom A, which determines the strength of the H—A bond. Acid strengths also depend on the stability of the conjugate base.|$|E
25|$|Terminal alkynes {{have the}} formula RC2H. An example is methyl{{acetylene}} (propyne using IUPAC nomenclature). Terminal alkynes, like acetylene itself, are mildly acidic, with pKa values of around 25. They {{are far more}} acidic than alkenes and alkanes, which have pKa values of around 40 and 50, respectively. The acidic hydrogen on terminal alkynes can {{be replaced by a}} variety of groups resulting in halo-, silyl-, and alkoxoalkynes. The carbanions generated by <b>deprotonation</b> of terminal alkynes are called acetylides.|$|E
25|$|When an acid {{catalyst}} is used, {{the initial}} {{step in the}} reaction mechanism involves acid-catalyzed tautomerization of the carbonyl compound to the enol. The acid also serves to activate the carbonyl group of another molecule by protonation, rendering it highly electrophilic. The enol is nucleophilic at the α-carbon, allowing it to attack the protonated carbonyl compound, leading to the aldol after <b>deprotonation.</b> This usually dehydrates to give the unsaturated carbonyl compound. The scheme shows a typical acid-catalyzed self-condensation of an aldehyde.|$|E
25|$|In the Ireland model, the <b>deprotonation</b> {{is assumed}} to proceed by a {{six-membered}} or cyclic monomeric transition state. The larger of the two substituents on the electrophile (in the case above, methyl is larger than proton) adopts an equatorial disposition in the favored transition state, leading to a preference for E enolates. The model clearly fails in many cases; for example, if the solvent mixture is changed from THF to 23% HMPA-THF (as seen above), the enolate geometry is reversed, which is inconsistent with this model and its cyclic transition state.|$|E
25|$|In {{the first}} step of the {{reaction}} mechanism, the peroxyacid protonates the oxygen of the carbonyl group. This makes the carbonyl group more susceptible to attack by the peroxyacid. Next, the peroxyacid attacks the carbon of the carbonyl group forming {{what is known as the}} Criegee intermediate. Through a concerted mechanism, one of the substituents on the ketone migrates to the oxygen of the peroxide group while a carboxylic acid leaves. This migration step is thought to be the rate determining step. Finally, <b>deprotonation</b> of the oxocarbenium ion produces the ester.|$|E
25|$|As {{either the}} Lewis acidity {{of the base}} or the {{coordinating}} ability of the substituent decrease, a mechanism involving purely inductive effects becomes more important. For instance, the lithiation of 1 with lithium di(isopropyl)amide (LDA) affords only the product of benzylic metalation 2; none of the ortho-lithiated product 3 is observed. This result is explained by a mechanism in which the amide substituent affects the acidity of the para benzylic position solely through inductive effects and coordination of the base is not operative. <b>Deprotonation</b> occurs to afford the most thermodynamically stable product.|$|E
25|$|Lithium {{monoxide}} anion (LiO−) is a superbase {{existing in}} the solution state in an aprotic solvent. It was the world's strongest known base until 2008, when Orthodiethynylbenzene dianion, Meta-diethynylbenzene dianion and Para-diethynylbenzene dianion became the world's strongest known bases. Orthodiethynylbenzene dianion {{is the strongest}} base, followed by Meta-diethynylbenzene dianion and Para-diethynylbenzene dianion. Strong bases like lithium monoxide anion (LiO−) is made in an aprotic solvent such as tetrahydrofuran. The <b>deprotonation</b> agent used {{in the creation of}} Lithium monoxide anion is lithium diisopropylamide. The methyl anion CH3− was the strongest known base before lithium monoxide anion was discovered.|$|E
25|$|The N–H {{center has}} a pKa of 21 in DMSO, so that very strong bases such as sodium hydride or n-butyl lithium and water-free {{conditions}} {{are required for}} complete <b>deprotonation.</b> The resulting organometalic derivatives can react in two ways. The more ionic salts such as the sodium or potassium compounds tend to react with electrophiles at nitrogen-1, whereas the more covalent magnesium compounds (indole Grignard reagents) and (especially) zinc complexes tend to react at carbon 3 (see figure below). In analogous fashion, polar aprotic solvents such as DMF and DMSO tend to favour attack at the nitrogen, whereas nonpolar solvents such as toluene favour C3 attack.|$|E
25|$|Interestingly, {{the model}} does not predict {{any change in}} leaving group {{departure}} at the transition state. Instead the extent of <b>deprotonation</b> is expected to decrease. This {{can be explained by}} the fact that a better leaving group needs less assistance from a developing neighbouring negative charge in order to depart. The true change predicts more carbocation character at the transition state and a mechanism that is more E1-like. These observations can be correlated with Hammett ρ-values. Poor leaving groups correlate with large positive ρ-values. Gradually increasing the leaving group ability decreases the ρ-value until it becomes large and negative, indicating the development of positive charge in the transition state.|$|E
25|$|A third {{approach}} {{has been described by}} Kim and coworkers. Using a pyridine-functionalized derivative of tartaric acid and a Zn(II) source they were able to synthesize a 2D MOF termed POST-1. POST-1 possesses 1D channels whose cross sections are defined by six trinuclear zinc clusters and six struts. While three of the six pyridines are coordinated by zinc ions, the remaining three are protonated and directed toward the channel interior. When neutralized, the noncoordinated pyridyl groups are found to catalyze transesterification reactions, presumably by facilitating <b>deprotonation</b> of the reactant alcohol. The absence of significant catalysis when large alcohols are employed strongly suggests that the catalysis occurs within the channels of the MOF.|$|E
25|$|The {{addition}} and its counterpart, the elimination, are reactions which {{change the}} number of substitutents on the carbon atom, and form or cleave multiple bonds. Double and triple bonds can be produced by eliminating a suitable leaving group. Similar to the nucleophilic substitution, there are several possible reaction mechanisms which are named after the respective reaction order. In the E1 mechanism, the leaving group is ejected first, forming a carbocation. The next step, formation of the double bond, takes place with elimination of a proton (<b>deprotonation).</b> The leaving order is reversed in the E1cb mechanism, that is the proton is split off first. This mechanism requires participation of a base. Because of the similar conditions, both reactions in the E1 or E1cb elimination always compete with the SN1 substitution.|$|E
25|$|In general, kinetic enolates are {{favored by}} cold temperatures, {{conditions}} that give relatively ionic metal–oxygen bonding, and rapid <b>deprotonation</b> using a slight excess of a strong, sterically hindered base. The large base only deprotonates the more accessible hydrogen, {{and the low}} temperatures and excess base help avoid equilibration to the more stable alternate enolate after initial enolate formation. Thermodynamic enolates are favored by longer equilibration times at higher temperatures, conditions that give relatively covalent metal–oxygen bonding, and use of a slight sub-stoichiometric amount of strong base. By using insufficient base to deprotonate all of the carbonyl molecules, the enolates and carbonyls can exchange protons {{with each other and}} equilibrate to their more stable isomer. Using various metals and solvents can provide control over the amount of ionic character in the metal–oxygen bond.|$|E
25|$|The {{decarboxylation}} of oxalosuccinate (below center) {{is a key}} step in {{the formation}} of alpha-ketoglutarate. In this reaction, the lone pair on the adjacent Tyrosine hydroxyl abstracts the proton off the carboxyl group. This carboxyl group is also referred to as the beta subunit in the isocitrate molecule. The <b>deprotonation</b> of the carboxyl group causes the lone pair of electrons to move down making carbon dioxide and separating from oxalosuccinate. The electrons continue to move towards the alpha carbon pushing the double bond electrons (making the ketone) up to abstract a proton off an adjacent lysine residue. An alpha-beta unsaturated double bond results between carbon 2 and three. As you can see in the picture, the green ion represents either Mg2+ or Mn2+, which is a cofactor necessary for this reaction to occur. The metal-ion forms a little complex through ionic interactions with the oxygen atoms on the fourth and fifth carbons (also known as the gamma subunit of isocitrate).|$|E
25|$|After {{the carbon}} dioxide is split from the oxalosuccinate in the {{decarboxylation}} step (below right), the enol will tautomerize to the keto from. The formation of the ketone double bond is started by the <b>deprotonation</b> of that oxygen off the alpha carbon (C#2) by the same lysine that protonated the oxygen in the first place. The {{lone pair of electrons}} moves down kicking off the lone pairs that were making the double bond. This lone pair of electrons abstracts a proton off the Tyrosine that deprotonated the carboxyl group in the decarboxylation step. The reason that we can say that the Lys and Tyr residues will be the same from the previous step is because they are helping in holding the isocitrate molecule in the active site of the enzyme. These two residues will be able to form hydrogen bonds back and forth {{as long as they are}} close enough to the substrate.|$|E
25|$|Initially, More O’Ferrall {{introduced}} {{this type of}} analysis to discuss the continuity between concerted and step-wise β-elimination reaction mechanisms. The model also provided a framework within which to explain the effects of substituents and reaction conditions on the mechanism. The appropriate lower energy species were placed {{at the corners of}} the two dimensional plot (Figure 2). These were the reactants (top left), the products (bottom right) and the intermediates of the two possible stepwise reactions: the carbocation for E1 (bottom left) and the carbanion for E1cB (top-right). Thus, the horizontal axes represent the extent of <b>deprotonation</b> (C-H bond distance) and the vertical axes represent the extent of leaving group departure (C-LG distance). By applying the Hammond and anti-Hammond effects, he predicted the effects of various changes in the reactants or reaction conditions. For example, the effects of introducing a better leaving group on a substrate that initially eliminates via an E2 mechanism are illustrated in Figure 2. A better leaving group increases the energy of the reactants and of the carbanion intermediate. Thus, the transition state moves towards the reactants and away from the carbanion intermediate.|$|E
25|$|The protein or {{membrane}} environment {{could respond}} to an external field {{in a number of}} different ways. Field induced dipoles, reorientation of permanent dipoles, protonation and <b>deprotonation</b> of protein residues, larger scale reorganization of ionized side-chains and water molecules, both within the interior and on the surface of the protein, are all examples of how complicated the assignment of permittivity is. In MD simulations, where all the charges, dipoles, and field induced atomic dipoles are treated explicitly then it is suggested that a dielectric value of 1 is appropriate. However, in reduced-particle ion simulation programs, such as ours, where the protein, membrane, and water are continuum backgrounds and treated implicitly, and on top of that, the ion motion takes place on the same time-scale as the protein’s response to its presence, it is very difficult to assign the dielectric coefficients. In fact, changing the dielectric coefficients could easily alter the channel characteristics, such as ion permeation and selectivity The assignment of dielectric coefficient for water is another key issue. The water molecules inside ion channels could be very ordered due to tapered size of the pore, which is often lined with highly charged residues, or hydrogen bond formation between water molecules and protein. As a result, the dielectric constant of water inside an ion channel could be quite different from the value under bulk conditions. To make the matter even more complicated, the dielectric coefficients of water inside nanopores is not necessarily an isotropic scalar value, but an anisotropic tensor having different values in different directions.|$|E
