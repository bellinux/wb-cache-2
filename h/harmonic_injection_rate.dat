40|$|The {{mechanism}} of <b>harmonic</b> current <b>injection</b> from single-phase grid-connected converters is comprehensively investigated. The measurable impacts from grid voltage, converter commutation, power factor, PWM modulation and control strategy are demonstrated on the <b>harmonic</b> current <b>injection.</b> According to the mechanism, a tailor-made control solution which employs a low pass voltage-loop filter and internal model principle-based hybrid current controller, is proposed {{to eliminate the}} <b>harmonic</b> current <b>injection</b> from the single-phase grid-connected converters. Experiments are performed to verify {{the validity of the}} mechanism and the proposed control method. It not only presents an effective tailor-made solution to the elimination of <b>harmonic</b> current <b>injection</b> from grid-connected power converters, but also provides a mechanism-based benchmark tool to further develop rational grid requirements on the <b>harmonic</b> <b>injection</b> levels in the grid integration of distributed generation units...|$|R

40|$|Whilst third <b>harmonic</b> <b>injection</b> is {{extensively}} used in modular multilevel converter (MMC) control, its significant {{advantages over}} sinusoidal modulation {{have not been}} fully explored. This paper evaluates the influence of third <b>harmonic</b> <b>injection</b> on system power losses, submodule capacitance, circulating current, and fault current and mathematical models are derived. Station conduction losses are reduced by 11 %, yielding higher efficiency and lowering cooling system capacity. The submodule capacitance is reduced by 24 %, which significantly lowers the capital cost, weight, and volume of the station converter. Additionally, the phase energy variation is reduced by around 18 %, which benefits circulating current control. Due to the lower AC currents, the semiconductor current stresses are correspondingly reduced. In addition to the performance improvement in normal operation, the third <b>harmonic</b> <b>injection</b> reduces the DC fault currents by 13. 4 % and thus the fault current stresses on semiconductors and DC circuit breakers are lowered.

40|$|Abstract—The {{physics of}} signal {{injection}} {{to shape the}} output spectrum in a traveling wave tube (TWT) is studied using an analytic solution to the approximate nonlinear S-MUSE model and with the large signal code LATTE. The results verify the long-standing conjecture that a frequency canceled by signal injection is composed of a component due to the injected signal and a component due to the nonlinearity of the TWT. Furthermore, the structures of the solutions are exploited to explain and predict behavior for various signal injection schemes.

30|$|As can be {{seen from}} the {{experimental}} results, an appropriate <b>injection</b> <b>rate</b> can make the natural cleat system open, while an excessive <b>injection</b> <b>rate</b> will cause hydraulic fractures to extend only in one direction. The interactions between fractures and the cleat system will then be reduced, inhibiting the formation of complex fractures. Within an appropriate range, the higher the <b>injection</b> <b>rate</b> is, the more complicated the fractures are. The existence of butt cleats makes the fracture propagation more complex. With an increase in <b>injection</b> <b>rate,</b> the fractures are more complex when α is 90 ° compared with 0 °. Since the in situ stress state, the characteristics of the natural cleat system and the bedding plane cannot be changed artificially, the <b>injection</b> <b>rate</b> is the key to get better fracturing effects. A high <b>injection</b> <b>rate</b> can open the natural cleats and create new hydraulic fractures, forming fracture networks. Therefore, the selection of a higher <b>injection</b> <b>rate</b> based on the cleat orientation is of vital importance.|$|R

However, the effect of heat loss on temperature drop becomes weaker with increasing of <b>injection</b> <b>rate.</b> It is observed from Fig.  3 c that under the condition that the mass content of non-condensing gases is kept unchanged, superheat degree increases with increasing of <b>injection</b> <b>rate.</b> Besides, under the condition that the <b>injection</b> <b>rate</b> is kept unchanged, superheat degree decreases with increasing of mass content of non-condensing gases.
