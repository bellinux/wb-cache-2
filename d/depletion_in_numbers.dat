Changes <b>in</b> the relative <b>number</b> of PBMCs were analyzed by flow cytometry.

There was also a significant decrease <b>in</b> the <b>number</b> of IgM(+) cells (p < 0. 05) and a slight decrease <b>in</b> the <b>number</b> of CD 4 (+) lymphocytes after 5 days of infection.

To define which subpopulation of PBMCs was the target for CSFV infection, PBMC populations from CSFV infected pigs were separated and stained for virus antigen expression. Alveolar macrophages (AM) were also studied. The results showed that CSFV replicated in all PBMC subpopulations: CD 4 (+), CD 8 (+), and IgM(+) lymphocytes, and monocytes as well as AMs. However, virus antigen expression was more intense in monocytes and AMs. The infection of lymphocytes may, therefore, contribute to the <b>depletion</b> <b>in</b> their <b>numbers</b> after infection and lead to defective antibody production during virulent CSFV infection.

40|$|Due to the {{effectiveness}} of combined antiretroviral therapy, people living with HIV can control viral replication and live longer lifespans than ever. However, HIV-positive individuals still face challenges to their health and well-being, including dysregulation of the immune system resulting from years of chronic immune activation, as well as opportunistic infections from pathogenic fungi. This review focuses on one of the key players in HIV immunology, the plasmacytoid dendritic cell (pDC), which links the innate and adaptive immune response and is notable for being the body’s most potent producer of type-I interferons (IFNs). During chronic HIV infection, the pDC compartment is greatly dysregulated, experiencing a substantial <b>depletion</b> <b>in</b> <b>number</b> and compromise <b>in</b> function. This immune dysregulation may leave patients further susceptible to opportunistic infections. This is especially important when considering a new role for pDCs currently emerging in the literature: in addition to their role in antiviral immunity, recent studies suggest that pDCs also {{play an important role in}} antifungal immunity. Supporting this new role, pDCs express C-type lectin receptors including dectin- 1, dectin- 2, dectin- 3, and mannose receptor, and toll-like receptors- 4 and - 9 that are involved in recognition, signaling, and response to a wide variety of fungal pathogens, including Aspergillus fumigatus, Cryptococcus neoformans, Candida albicans, and Pneumocystis jirovecii. Accordingly, pDCs have been demonstrated to recognize and respond to certain pathogenic fungi, measured via activation, cytokine production, and fungistatic activity in vitro, while in vivo mouse models indicated a strikingly vital role for pDCs in survival against pulmonary Aspergillus challenge. Here, we discuss the role of the pDC compartment and the dysregulation it undergoes during chronic HIV infection, as well as what is known so far about the role and mechanisms of pDC antifungal activity...|$|R

40|$|Chemical synapses are {{specialist}} {{points of}} contact between two neurons, where information transfer takes place.

Depopulation of the leucopoietic areas of the marrow was evident from examination of histological sections. The severity of bone marrow atrophy in MCMV-infected mice of different strains correlated with previously described genetically determined sensitivity to MCMV disease. Although the phenomenon only occurred when mice were inoculated with infectious virus preparations, fewer than one in 10 (5) marrow cells were productively infected, suggesting that atrophy was not due to lytic infection of large numbers of bone marrow cells. Interestingly, increases in serum colony-stimulating activity were observed and these were proportional to the severity of bone marrow atrophy. After MCMV infection, we observed increases in the proportions of cells expressing some B-cell and myeloid cell markers and a decrease in the proportion of cells expressing an erythroid cell marker. There was no change in the frequency of marrow cells expressing mature T-cell markers. The numbers of myeloid lineage-committed progenitor cells (GM-CFU) in the marrow decreased 10 - to 20 -fold in BALB/c nu/+ mice, while there was a threefold decrease in their numbers in BALB/c nu/nu mice. In addition, increases in serum colony-stimulating activity were greater in BALB/c nu/+ mice than in BALB/c nu/nu mice.

The splenic γδ T-cell population continues to expand, reaching levels equal to 4 times the <b>number</b> of splenocytes <b>in</b> an uninfected mouse. Splenic γδ T cells from JH−/− mice with chronic malaria expressed Vγ 1 + or Vδ 4 + in the same ratio as uninfected controls with Vγ 1 cells dominating, but the Vγ 2 ratio declined about twofold. γδ T cells from G 8 mice specific for the TL antigen increased only 2 -fold <b>in</b> <b>number,</b> compared with 10 -fold in BALB/c controls, but G 8 γδ T cells failed to express the B 220 activation marker. Elimination of the parasite by drug treatment caused a slow <b>depletion</b> <b>in</b> the <b>number</b> of splenic γδ, CD 4 +, and CD 8 + T cells. Following challenge, drug-cured JH−/− mice exhibited nearly identical parasitemia time courses as naïve controls. Depletion of either CD 4 + T cells or γδ T cells from chronically infected JH−/− mice by monoclonal antibody treatment resulted in an immediate and significant (P < 0. 05) exacerbation of parasitemia coupled with a marked decrease in splenic γδ T-cell numbers. The number of CD 4 + T cells, in contrast, did not decrease in mice after anti-T-cell receptor γδ treatment. The results indicate that cell-mediated immunity against blood-stage malarial parasites during chronic malaria (i) requires the continued presence of blood-stage parasites to remain functional, (ii) is dependent upon both γδ T cells and CD 4 + T cells, and (iii) lacks immunological memory...|$|R
