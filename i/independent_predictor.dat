40|$|Abstract: We did a {{prospective}} study {{to investigate whether}} clinic heart rate (HR) and 24 -h ambulatory HR were <b>independent</b> <b>predictors</b> of subsequent increase in body weight (BW) in young subjects screened for stage 1 hypertension. The {{study was conducted in}} 1, 008 subjects from the Hypertension and Ambulatory Recording Venetia Study (HARVEST) followed for an average of 7 years. Ambulatory HR was obtained in 701 subjects. Data were adjusted for lifestyle factors and several confounders. During the follow-up BW increased by 2. 1 +/- 7. 2 kg in the whole cohort. Both baseline clinic HR (P = 0. 007) and 24 -h HR (P = 0. 013) were <b>independent</b> <b>predictors</b> of BMI at study end. In addition, changes in HR during the follow-up either measured in the clinic (P = 0. 036) or with 24 -h recording (P = 0. 009) were independent associates of final BMI. In a multivariable Cox regression, baseline BMI (P < 0. 001), male gender (P < 0. 001), systolic blood pressure (BP) (P = 0. 01), baseline clinic HR (P = 0. 02), and follow-up changes in clinic HR (P < 0. 001) were <b>independent</b> <b>predictors</b> of overweight (Ov) or obesity (Ob) {{at the end of the}} follow-up. Follow-up changes in ambulatory HR (P = 0. 01) were also <b>independent</b> <b>predictors</b> of Ov or Ob. However, when both clinic and ambulatory HRs were included in the same Cox model, only baseline clinic HR and its change during the follow-up were <b>independent</b> <b>predictors</b> of outcome. In conclusion, baseline clinic HR and HR changes during the follow-up are <b>independent</b> <b>predictors</b> of BW gain in young persons screened for stage 1 hypertension suggesting that sympathetic nervous system activity may play a role in the development of Ob in hypertensio...|$|R

40|$|Objectives: Automated {{variable}} selection methods are frequently {{used to determine}} the <b>independent</b> <b>predictors</b> of an outcome. The objective {{of this study was to}} determine the reproducibility of logistic regression models developed using automated {{variable selection}} methods. Study Design and Setting: An initial set of 29 candidate variables were considered for predicting mortality after acute myocardial infarction (AMI). We drew 1, 000 bootstrap samples from a dataset consisting of 4, 911 patients admitted to hospital with an AMI. Using each bootstrap sample, logistic regression models predicting 30 -day mortality were obtained using backward elimination, forward selection, and stepwise selection. The agreement between the different model selection methods and the agreement across the 1, 000 bootstrap samples were compared. Results: Using 1, 000 bootstrap samples, backward elimination identified 940 unique models for predicting mortality. Similar results were obtained for forward and stepwise selection. Three variables were identified as <b>independent</b> <b>predictors</b> of mortality among all bootstrap samples. Over half the candidate prognostic variables were identified as <b>independent</b> <b>predictors</b> in less than half of the bootstrap samples. Conclusion: Automated variable selection methods result in models that are unstable and not reproducible. The variables selected as <b>independent</b> <b>predictors</b> are sensitive to random fluctuations in the data. 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved...|$|R

Methods We collected data at baseline and 6 -month follow-up using self-administered questionnaires. Multivariate logistic regression models were created for each outcome variable. Predictors included personal risk factors, physical work exposures and psychosocial factors. Results <b>Independent</b> <b>predictors</b> for upper extremity symptoms at 6 -month follow-up were age, Caucasian race, female gender, baseline history of UE symptoms, and job tasks involving wrist bending or forceful gripping. <b>Independent</b> <b>predictors</b> for functional impairment were baseline history and severity of UE symptoms, wrist bending, and social support.

40|$|Aim: To {{determine}} parental, especially paternal {{factors associated}} {{with the weight of}} the placenta and offspring. Methods: This population-based birth-cohort study includes 2947 singleton children born from April 2006 to 2007 and living in Drenthe, The Netherlands. Placental weight and birth weight were measured and questionnaires were filled out for this cohort. Associations between parental factors, and the weight of the placenta and the offspring were evaluated using univariate and multivariate linear regression models.

However, they were not <b>independent</b> <b>predictors.</b> <b>Independent</b> <b>predictors</b> for placental weight were the maternal factors of pre-pregnancy BMI, birth weight, and diabetes.

Multivariate logistic regression {{was used to}} find <b>independent</b> <b>predictors</b> for 1) multiple sex partners (>sexual 1 partner in the past year), 2) unprotected sex with casual partners in The Netherlands, 3) sexual activity in country of origin, and 4) unprotected sex in country of origin. 1) Multiple sex partners were reported by 50 % of respondents. <b>Independent</b> <b>predictors</b> were a recent infection with a sexually transmitted disease (STD), youth, low educational level, Afro-Surinamese origin, lack of a long-term relationship and history of commercial sex contact. 2) Unprotected sex occurred in 24 % of casual partnerships. <b>Independent</b> <b>predictors</b> were a recent STD infection, low educational level, use of hard drugs, age between 20 and 29, few sexual partners, unprotected sex in country of origin, and a partner from the respondent's ethnic group. 3) During the past 5 years, 24 % were sexually active in country of origin. <b>Independent</b> <b>predictors</b> were Ghanaian origin, age over 20, a relatively high income, and multiple partners. 4) Unprotected sex occurred in 39 % of the partnerships in country of origin. <b>Independent</b> <b>predictors</b> were low educational level, history of STDs, lack of health insurance, Ghanaian origin, frequent visits to home country, few sexual partners, and unprotected sex with casual partners in The Netherlands.

Almost half of patients with type 1 diabetes have a prolonged QTc interval (> 440 ms).

50|$|Three {{relatively}} small studies on SAH {{have been carried}} out. Crowley et al., in the US in 2009, investigated patients with subarachnoid haemorrhage (SAH; 5667 patients). Unlike the group's other study, weekend admission was not a statistically significant <b>independent</b> <b>predictor</b> {{of death in the}} study population at 7 days (OR = 1.07, 95% CI 0.91-1.25), 14 days (OR = 1.01, 95% CI 0.87-1.17), or 30 days (OR = 1.03, 95% CI 0.89-1.19). In 2011, in China, Zhang et al., in a smaller study, analysed 183 patients with SAH. In logistic regression model, weekend admission was not an <b>independent</b> <b>predictor</b> of higher in-hospital mortality (OR = 1.77, 95% CI 0.83-3.77) after SAH. However a weekend effect was observed by Deshmukh et al., in 2016, when the group studied 385 UK patients with SAH. They found that the patients admitted on a weekend had a significantly higher scan to treatment time (83.1 ± 83.4 h vs 40.4 ± 53.4 h, p<0.0001) and admission to treatment (71.6 ± 79.8 h vs 27.5 ± 44.3 h, p < 0.0001) time. After adjustments for adjusted for relevant covariates, weekend admission was significantly associated with excess in-hospital mortality (OR =  2.1, 95% CI 1.13-4.0; p = 0.01).|$|E
