40|$|ABSTRACT Background: The {{long-term}} {{experience of}} living with peripheral arterial disease (PAD) and the durability of improvements after revascularization are sparsely described in the literature. The primary goal of medical treatment and nursing care for PAD is to provide relief of symptoms, improve {{quality of life and}} prevent the progression of arterial disease and cardiovascular complications. A majority are elderly with a significantly increased risk of myocardial infarction, stroke and cardiovascular death. Which can limit mobility and functional status {{even in the absence of}} <b>ischaemic</b> <b>claudication,</b> rest pain or ulceration after a successful revascularization. Objectives: To illuminate the long-term experience {{of living with}} peripheral arterial disease and the recovery following revascularizations. Methods: Fourteen patients were interviewed 6 months and 2 ½ years after revascularization. The transcribed texts were analysed using manifest and latent content analysis. Results: The long-term experience of living with PAD meant gradually becoming aware of having a chronic disease. This was interpreted in the following themes, representing the transition from being in an acute phase of PAD to the recovery after revascularization and entering a chronic phase of PAD: (I) “becoming better but not cured”; (II) “recapturing control over life”; (III) “reappraising meaning in life”. Conclusions: Becoming aware of having a chronic disease results in a need to adapt to and accept permanent restrictions in daily life. The findings showed that revascularizations offer several benefits, however when PAD symptoms were relieved other ailments became discernable, which reflects the complex course of PAD and atherosclerotic disease. Moreover, several critical points and events such as other concurrent diseases, unrealistic hope for recovery, the complex course of PAD and atherosclerotic disease complicated the transition process towards health and well-being...|$|E

Methods: Fourteen patients were interviewed 6 months and 21 / 2 years after revascularisation. The transcribed texts were analysed using manifest and latent content analysis. Results: The long-term experience of living with PAD meant gradually becoming aware of having a chronic disease.

40|$|Six hundred {{patients}} with chronic leg ulcers were interviewed and examined for evidence of arterial impairment. There were 827 ulcerated legs. Pedal pulses could not be felt in 94 (11 %). A Doppler resting pressure index of 0. 9 or less was found in 176 legs (21 %). Risk factors for arterial impairment included age, ulceration affecting the foot, {{and a history of}} <b>claudication,</b> <b>ischaemic</b> heart disease, or cerebrovascular disease. Roughly half the {{patients with}} arterial impairment also showed the clinical features of chronic venous insufficiency. Careful assessment for arterial disease is mandatory before {{patients with chronic}} leg ulcers are treated with elastic compression...|$|R
