5|$|Kenyatta's {{government}} {{was eager to}} control the country's trade unions, fearing their ability to disrupt the economy. To this end it emphasised various social welfare schemes over traditional industrial institutions, and in 1965 transformed the Kenya <b>Federation</b> <b>of</b> <b>Labour</b> into the Central Organization of Trade (COT), a body which came under strong government influence. No strikes could be legally carried out in Kenya without COT's permission. Under Kenyatta, Kenya's first university—the University of Nairobi—was established, with several others following after.|$|E
5|$|Unemployment {{had more}} than tripled by late November 2008, with over 7000 {{registered}} jobseekers (about 4% of the workforce) compared to just 2136 {{at the end of}} August 2008. As 80% of household debt is indexed and another 13% denominated in foreign currencies, debt payment {{is going to be more}} costly. Since October 2008, 14% of the workforce have experienced reductions in pay, and around 7% have had their working hours reduced. According to the president of the Icelandic <b>Federation</b> <b>of</b> <b>Labour</b> (ASÍ), Gylfi Arnbjörnsson, these figures are lower than expected. 85% of those registered as unemployed in Iceland stated that they lost their job in October, after the economic collapse.|$|E

5|$|Doris Louise Sands {{was born}} on 19 June 1921 in St. Agnes, New Providence, The Bahamas, to Sarah Elizabeth (née Fyne) and John Albert Sands. After {{completing}} her secondary education, Sands began teaching {{at the age of}} fifteen. On 3 January 1943 at Zion Baptist Church in Nassau, Sands married Ratal Allen Johnson. They subsequently had one son and Johnson worked for 17 years to earn the money to further her education. Around 1953, she was able to enroll at Virginia Union University in Richmond, Virginia, graduating with a bachelor's degree in education. She returned to the Bahamas in 1956 and joined the Progressive Liberal Party (PLP). Granted a four-year government scholarship to further her education in Canada, Johnson enrolled in a master's degree program in educational administration. Beginning her studies at MacDonald College of Education of McGill University, she earned her master's degree and began work on her doctorate at the Ontario College of Education at the University of Toronto. In the midst of her studies, the government terminated the scholarship during her third year of studying abroad, under the guise that her master's degree had been completed. Johnson believed that the scholarship was terminated because she had been active in organizing. She helped found the Women’s Suffrage Movement in the Bahamas, and in 1958 both the Bahamian <b>Federation</b> <b>of</b> <b>Labour</b> and the National Council of Women, traveling home intermittently during her studies to work towards enfranchisement. She returned home, but was advised that the only available positions for teaching administrators were in outlying islands.|$|E

25|$|In 1955, {{seventeen}} {{trade unions}} finally merged {{to create the}} Tanganyika <b>Federation</b> <b>of</b> <b>Labour</b> (TFL). Its original two main objectives were to gain more members and to absorb smaller unions.

25|$|Moderate unionists {{who support}} the {{principle}} of Equal Citizenship between Northern Ireland and Great Britain have campaigned for mainstream British political parties to organise and contest elections in Northern Ireland. Equal citizenship pressure groups have included the Campaign for Equal Citizenship (CEC), Labour Representation Campaign, Democracy Now and, currently, Labour - <b>Federation</b> <b>of</b> <b>Labour</b> Groups. Momentum for this concept picked up after the Conservative Party Conference voted in favour of working in Northern Ireland in 1989. No Conservative has been elected in Northern Ireland since the 1997 local government elections.|$|E
25|$|In 1998, the CAW {{was deeply}} {{involved}} in discussions with Volvo Canada Ltd. and the Government of Nova Scotia over {{the closure of the}} Volvo Halifax Assembly plant. In 2000, the CAW was expelled from the Canadian Labour Congress when several union locals left the SEIU and joined the CAW, prompting accusations of union raiding. A settlement was reached a year later that allowed the CAW to rejoin the national labour federation but relations with other unions such as the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, the United Steel Workers of America and SEIU remain strained and the CAW remains outside of the Ontario <b>Federation</b> <b>of</b> <b>Labour.</b>|$|E

Although the Waihi Goldmining Company claimed to have no involvement in the breakaway union, {{saying that it was}} a matter of union politics, many workers believed that the Company was attempting to split the union, and called a strike. The local police chief reacted cautiously to the action, but Police Commissioner John Cullen ordered a strong response, dispatching additional police.|$|R

25|$|With the Quiet Revolution, Royal Commission on Bilingualism and Biculturalism {{and later}} the October Crisis the party's {{position}} on the national question {{became the subject of}} broad debate across the country, and influenced the agreement of the Canadian Labour Congress to work with the Quebec <b>Federation</b> <b>of</b> <b>Labour</b> on an equal and voluntary basis. The communists called for workers sympathetic with independence movements to unite on a common, immediate class-based programme of common struggle with English-speaking Canadian workers. The PCQ helped re-launch Montreal's mass May Day demonstrations and advanced many unique policies including the idea of a federated party of labour, which proved its prescience with the formation of Québec solidaire. The federated party of labour proposal was endorsed by the late 1960s by most trade union centrals, but the project was eclipsed by the emergence of the Parti Quebecois.|$|E
25|$|In Canada, the Sino-Soviet split {{was less}} sharply {{divisive}} than demoralizing for the communists. In the ensuing fifteen years, the Communist Party of Canada (CPC) {{had lost all}} of its limited gains in parliament {{under the pressure of}} the Cold War, and Communist MP Fred Rose was jailed for sedition. Anti-communism in the labour movement resulted in the expulsion of all communist-led unions from the house of labour, and communists in general were treated as traitors. Following the 1956 revelations by Soviet premier Nikita Khrushchev ("On the Cult of Personality and Its Consequences") about the crimes of Joseph Stalin, the CPC suffered many resignations, and its youth organization, the National <b>Federation</b> <b>of</b> <b>Labour</b> Youth, fell apart briefly. By the time it was reorganized as the Socialist Youth League in the late 1950s, the CPC had lost much of its prior visibility on university campuses—including the University of British Columbia (UBC).|$|E
25|$|This {{became known}} as the 1983 Solidarity Crisis, from the name of the Solidarity Coalition, a huge {{grassroots}} opposition movement mobilized, consisting of organized labour and community groups, with the British Columbia <b>Federation</b> <b>of</b> <b>Labour</b> forming a separate organization of unions, Operation Solidarity, under the direction of Jack Munro, then-President of the International Woodworkers of America (IWA), the most powerful of the province's resource unions. Tens of thousands participated in protests and many felt a general strike would be the inevitable result unless the government backed down from its policies they had claimed were only about restraint and not about recrimination against the NDP and the left. Just as a strike at Pacific Press ended, which had crippled the political management of the public agenda by the publishers of the province's major papers, the movement collapsed after an apparent deal was struck by union leader and IWA president, Jack Munro and Premier Bennett.|$|E

Shortly before the writ was dropped, a group calling itself Albertans for Change began to buy print and television ads that attacked Stelmach for lacking a plan and portrayed him as unfit to lead the province. The group was funded by the Alberta Building Trades Council and the Alberta <b>Federation</b> <b>of</b> <b>Labour,</b> which led to a series of ads purchased by the National Citizens Coalition and Merit Contractors, in which it was accused of [...] "putting your [...] money where [...] mouths are." ...|$|E
