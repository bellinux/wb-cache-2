50|$|Some legislatures have a dual approach. In the Australian Parliament, the Speaker of the House of Representatives may {{not vote}} in <b>general</b> <b>debates</b> {{but has a}} casting vote to decide a tie. The President of the Senate may vote in <b>general</b> <b>debates</b> but, to {{preserve}} the appearance of impartiality, rarely if ever does so. The President {{does not have a}} casting vote, and a tied vote in the Senate is resolved in the negative. The same arrangements exist with respect to the Speakers of the Canadian House and Senate.|$|R

25|$|Numerous criticisms {{have been}} made {{regarding}} the use of impact factors. For one thing, the impact factor might not be consistently reproduced in an independent audit. There is also a more <b>general</b> <b>debate</b> on the validity of the impact factor as a measure of journal importance and the effect of policies that editors may adopt to boost their impact factor (perhaps to the detriment of readers and writers). Other criticism focuses on the effect of the impact factor on behavior of scholars, editors and other stakeholders. Others have criticized the impact factor more generally on the institutional background of the neoliberal academia, claiming that what is needed is not just its replacement with more sophisticated metrics but a democratic discussion on the social value of research assessment and the growing precariousness of scientific careers.|$|E
50|$|Both {{morphological}} {{and molecular}} analyses suggest that P. zwierleini {{belongs to the}} so called “blind clade” of scolopendromorph centipedes (including Plutoniumidae, Cryptopidae and Scolopocryptopidae) and is strictly related to Theatops. In the past, the evolutionary affinities of Plutonium have {{been a matter of}} speculations, within the more <b>general</b> <b>debates</b> on the evolution of the segmental anatomy of the Arthropoda.|$|R
25|$|As {{a matter}} of {{diplomatic}} courtesy, since 1964, the Holy See was also allowed to make formal policy statements in the General Assembly, both during the <b>General</b> <b>Debates</b> and during {{the discussion of the}} various separate issues contained in the agenda of the General Assembly. Notably, popes Paul VI, John Paul II, Benedict XVI, and Francis were invited to address the General Assembly.|$|R
5000|$|<b>General</b> <b>debates</b> on broader {{issues of}} {{government}} policy {{may also be}} held in parliament and may also {{be followed by a}} motion of [...] "no-confidence". The opposition rarely requests motions of no-confidence, as the government is usually certain of its majority; however, government policy is often discussed in the plenary assembly of Parliament. Since 1953, the year that marked the reform of the Danish constitution, parliament has been unicameral.|$|R
25|$|The {{order of}} {{speakers}} is given first to member states, then observer states and supranational bodies. Any other observers entities {{will have a}} chance to speak at the end of the debate, if they so choose. Speakers will be put on the list in the order of their request, with special consideration for ministers and other government officials of similar or higher rank. According to the rules in place for the <b>General</b> <b>Debate,</b> the statements should be in one of the United Nations official languages of Arabic, Chinese, English, French, Russian or Spanish, and will be translated by the United Nations translators. Each speaker is requested to provide 20 advance copies of their statements to the conference officers to facilitate translation and to be presented at the podium. Speeches are requested to be limited to five minutes, with seven minutes for supranational bodies.|$|E

50|$|The Young Men’s <b>General</b> <b>Debating</b> Society was {{initiated}} by eight scholars of the Central State Night School, {{with the intention}} of ‘refining manners, cultivating the mind and stimulating the intellect.’ They met on a weekly basis in a cottage belonging to the mother of their first president, William D. Hill, at 31 South Street, Ballarat. The Society quickly grew in popularity, and by the early 1880s, a number of similar groups had also been established.|$|R
50|$|In {{addition}} to the <b>general</b> <b>debates</b> supporting or opposing war, or particular wars, and the alleged connection of the military to homophobia, sexism, racism, militarism, and imperialism, there are debates about the recruitment process itself.

500|$|Guinean Foreign Minister Edouard Niankoye Lama {{called for}} [...] "restoration {{of peace and}} stability" [...] and of [...] "all {{democratic}} institutions," [...] when speaking at the <b>General</b> <b>debate</b> of the sixty-seventh session of the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA). Liberian President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf also criticised the [...] "unconstitutional unraveling, of democratic governments" [...] at the UNGA. Namibian President Hifikepunye Pohamba said at the UNGA <b>General</b> <b>debate</b> that he denounced the [...] "unconstitutional changes" [...] and praised ECOWAS for its work in trying to resolve the issue. Nigeria also condemned the coup and President Goodluck Jonathan also told the UNGA General debate: [...] "Guinea-Bissau is another flash point of instability in the sub-region in which Nigeria and ECOWAS are engaged. Indeed, the Contact Group, headed by Nigeria {{was set up by}} the Authority of Heads of State and Government of ECOWAS to help establish a transitional government with a view to returning that country to political and constitutional order. In furtherance of this objective, Nigeria provided the sum of 10 million US dollars to the Interim Government in Guinea-Bissau to assist in the stabilisation of the country." [...] Russia called for the restoration of the civilian government.|$|E

5000|$|According to {{the primary}} Korean record, the Korean <b>generals</b> <b>debated</b> amongst {{themselves}} {{over the course of}} action they should take. Several generals argued, [...] "We are numerous but much of our number is weak and inexperienced; we are relying heavily on the Northern Cavalries but they have just arrived after a long march and is tired, we should rest for a few more days to regather our strength before proceeding forward." [...] But they were overruled and the lead general decided to engage the enemy.|$|R
25|$|The move also follows an {{aggressive}} {{and at least}} partially successful campaign by the Palestinians to court recognition in the build-up to the vote, including numerous Latin American countries.

His Secretary of State Hillary Clinton was due to meet separately with both Abbas and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on the sidelines of the summit.|$|R
500|$|For Georgian England, {{the story}} of Elizabeth Canning was fascinating. [...] Little {{attention}} was paid in the trial to Squires's request for Canning to [...] "go their way"; according to Moore (1994), overtly the saga questioned Canning's chastity, while covertly it questioned whether someone of her social standing had any right to be taken notice of (in view of the immense interest taken in the case, this last seems unlikely). [...] The author Kristina Straub compares {{the case with the}} more <b>general</b> <b>debate</b> over the sexuality of female servants; Canning may have been either a [...] "childlike innocent, victimized by brutally criminal outlaws", or [...] "a wily manipulator of the justice system who uses innocent bystanders to escape the consequences of her own sexual misdeeds". [...] The Case of Elizabeth Canning Fairly Stated posited that Canning either suffered imprisonment to protect her virtue, or lied to conceal [...] "her own criminal Transactions in the Dark". [...] Straub opines that the debate was not merely about Canning's guilt or innocence, but rather [...] "the kinds of sexual identity that were attributable to women of her position in the social order." [...] In the end, however, such modern theorizing is only a distraction from the main question – innocent or guilty? ...|$|E
500|$|In the debate, Wilson {{concentrated}} {{almost exclusively}} {{on the extent to}} which the prime minister and his colleagues had been dilatory in not identifying a clear security risk arising from Profumo's association with Ward and his circle. Macmillan responded that he should not be held culpable for believing a colleague who had repeatedly asserted his innocence. He mentioned the false allegations against Galbraith, and the failure of the security services to share their detailed information with him. In the <b>general</b> <b>debate</b> the sexual aspects of the scandal were fully discussed; Nigel Birch, the Conservative MP for West Flintshire, referred to Keeler as a [...] "professional prostitute" [...] and asked rhetorically: [...] "What are whores about?" [...] Keeler was otherwise branded a [...] "tart" [...] and a [...] "poor little slut". [...] Ward [...] was vilified throughout as a likely Soviet agent; one Conservative referred to [...] "the treason of Dr Ward". Most Conservatives, whatever their reservations, were supportive of Macmillan, with only Birch suggesting that he should consider retirement. In the subsequent vote on the government's handling of the affair, 27 Conservatives abstained, reducing the government's majority to 69. Most newspapers considered the extent of the defection significant, and several forecast that Macmillan would soon resign.|$|E

Clarke and Edgar Mitchell, former NASA astronaut and sixth human being to walk on the moon. On 25 September 2007, the statement by H.E. Mr. José Sócrates, Prime Minister of Portugal, on behalf of the European Union, at the United Nations 62nd Session of the General Assembly, <b>General</b> <b>Debate,</b> stated, [...] "We remain committed to the reform of its main bodies in order to enhance the Organization's representativity, transparency and effectiveness."
