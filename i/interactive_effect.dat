When comparing the different kinds of gnocchi, the optimal physicochemical and textural properties were detected in the sample, which was made with fresh tubers. Not only was this caused by the use of fresh steam cooked in potatoes, but the pasteurized liquid eggs and the absence of any kind of emulsifier, additive, or preserving substance played a role as well.|$|E

50|$|Only {{the free}} {{fraction}} of a drug that is dissolved in the blood plasma can be removed through the kidney. Therefore, drugs that are tightly bound to proteins are not available for renal excretion, {{as long as they}} are not metabolized when they may be eliminated as metabolites.Creatinine clearance is used as a measure of kidney functioning but it is only useful in cases where the drug is excreted in an unaltered form in the urine. The excretion of drugs from the kidney's nephrons has the same properties as that of any other organic solute: passive filtration, reabsorption and active secretion. In the latter phase the secretion of drugs is an active process that is subject to conditions relating to the saturability of the transported molecule and competition between substrates. Therefore, these are key sites where interactions between drugs could occur.Filtration depends on a number of factors including the pH of the urine, it having been shown that the drugs that act as weak bases are increasingly excreted as the pH of the urine becomes more acidic, and the inverse is true for weak acids. This mechanism is of great use when treating intoxications (by making the urine more acidic or more alkali) and it is also used by some drugs and herbal products to produce their <b>interactive</b> <b>effect.</b>|$|E

40|$|Background: Grass pollen {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} aeroallergen vectors in Europe. Under some meteorological factors, pollen grains can release pollen cytoplasmic granules (PCGs). PCGs induce al-lergic responses. Several studies have shown that during a period of thunderstorms the number of patients with asthma increases because of higher airborne concentrations of PCGs. Objective: The aims of the study were to assess the allergenicity of <b>interactive</b> <b>effects</b> between pollen and PCGs and to compare it with allergenicity of Timothy grass pollen and PCGs in Brown Norway rats. Methods: Rats were sensitized (day 0) and challenged (day 21) with pollen grains and/or PCGs. Four groups were studied: pollen-pollen (PP), PCGs-PCGs (GG), pollen-PCGs (PG), and PCGs-pollen (GP). Blood samples, bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, and bronchial lymph node were collected at day 25. IgE and IgG 1 levels in sera were assessed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Alveolar cells, protein, and cytokine concentrations were quantified in bronchoal-veolar lavage fluid. T-cell proliferation, in response to pollen or granules, was performed by lymph node assay. Results: <b>Interactive</b> <b>effects</b> between pollen and PCGs increased IgE and IgG 1 levels when compared with those of the negative control.

A typical scenario in panel data is when wanting to estimate {{the effect of a}} regressor that is time invariant, such as sex or race, and accidentally including cross-section specific fixed effects.

40|$|Environmental {{scientists}} are increasingly tasked with understanding multiple stressor effects on interacting biological components. Estuaries {{are complex and}} frequently exposed to stressors simultaneously {{as a consequence of}} recreational and industrial anthropogenic activities. Stressors can have direct, indirect and <b>interactive</b> <b>effects.</b> <b>Interactive</b> <b>effects</b> can be additive, synergistic or antagonistic. This thesis investigates the independent and <b>interactive</b> <b>effects</b> of common contaminant sources on the development of biofilm and macrofouling communities. An additional aim was to determine the direct or indirect nature of these effects. Using a series of manipulative field experiments, current high throughput sequencing techniques, and biological network analyses, I investigated the independent and <b>interactive</b> <b>effects</b> of fertilisers and metals exposure on biofilm and macrofouling communities. Strong relationships were established between contaminants, specific taxa and whole communities. Contaminants fractured biofilm networks and directly and indirectly affected macrofouling communities. Biofilms responded to nutrients with changes in community composition, reduced richness and reduced diversity. Nutrients were consistently observed to increase the recruitment of ascidians (directly) and barnacles (indirectly); water-borne cues induced ascidians while substrate-bound cues induced barnacles. Serpulid, sponge and bryozoan recruitment were directly and indirectly suppressed by nutrient exposure, suggesting that settlement cues were either altered, not received or were inhibitory. Metals adversely affected recruitment of macrofouling communities: bryozoans were particularly sensitive. <b>Interactive</b> <b>effects</b> of nutrient and metals were observed for macroinvertebrates and were predominantly antagonistic. Nutrients mitigated adverse effects of metal exposure. These responses confirm the existence of direct, indirect and <b>interactive</b> contaminant <b>effects</b> on interacting fouling communities. This thesis demonstrates the importance of exploring independent and <b>interactive</b> contaminant <b>effects</b> across multiple biological components using experimental field manipulations. Ascidians and barnacles are identified as indicators of nutrient pollution in estuaries. Anthropogenic contaminants frequently alter environmental conditions, affecting biofilms and macrofouling communities. Contaminants affected both macro- and micro- fouling communities differently, highlighting the need to include both components within ecological monitoring programs.

We examined those responses in seven ecosystems, including forests, grasslands, and heathlands in different climate zones. The modeling analysis showed {{that none of the}} three-way interactions among T, C, and altered precipitation was substantial for either carbon or water processes, nor consistent among the seven ecosystems. However, two-way <b>interactive</b> <b>effects</b> on NPP, Rh, and NEP were generally positive (i. e. amplification of one factor's effect by the other factor) between T and C or between T and DP. A negative interaction (i. e. depression of one factor's effect by the other factor) occurred for simulated NPP between T and HP. The <b>interactive</b> <b>effects</b> on runoff were positive between T and HP. Four pairs of two-way <b>interactive</b> <b>effects</b> on plant transpiration were positive and two pairs negative. In addition, wet sites generally had smaller relative changes in NPP, Rh, runoff, and transpiration but larger absolute changes in NEP than dry sites in response to the treatments. The modeling results suggest new hypotheses to be tested in multifactor global change experiments. Likewise, more experimental evidence is needed for the further improvement of ecosystem models in order to adequately simulate complex interactive processes. ...|$|R
