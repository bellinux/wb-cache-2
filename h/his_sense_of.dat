5|$|All the {{elements}} in Booth's nature came together at once—his hatred of tyranny, his love of liberty, his passion for the stage, <b>his</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> drama, and his lifelong quest to become immortal.|$|E
5|$|Besides his on-court {{fights with}} other players, he has {{exhibited}} confrontational behavior off-court. He {{was arrested for}} breaking a man's nose during a fight after a game with the Milwaukee Bucks and also for throwing a man through a plate-glass window after being struck {{with a glass of}} ice. Barkley continues to be popular with the fans and media because of <b>his</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> humor and honesty.|$|E
5|$|Kurt is a SPARTAN-II {{who serves}} in John-117's squad. Kurt {{is known for}} <b>his</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> intuition, which saves his team on several occasions. Recruited to train {{a new series of}} Spartans, Kurt is devastated by the massive {{casualties}} his trainees suffer. In response, Kurt begins instituting illegal brain modifications to give his soldiers a better chance at survival. Due to the secretive lengths taken by his superiors to recruit him to the program, none of Kurt's former colleagues know he is alive.|$|E
5000|$|However, {{unlike other}} fictional detectives such as Raymond Chandler's jaded and world-weary Philip Marlowe, McGee clings {{to what is}} {{important}} to him: <b>his</b> <b>senses</b> <b>of</b> honor, obligation, and outrage.

5000|$|The Canadian film critic, Marc Saint Cyr, after {{viewing the}} film at the Rotterdam film festival, in <b>his</b> <b>Senses</b> <b>of</b> Cinema review said, [...] "unquestionably {{describes}} {{film as a}} true revelation". He also noted the dialogue to be, [...] "consistently gripping, strikingly intelligent, and occasionally laced with surprising humour".|$|R
5|$|The empty machine crashes {{through the}} wall into Toontown, where it is {{destroyed}} by a train. Numerous toons run in to regard Doom's remains, and Roger discovers that he inadvertently wrote his love letter for Jessica on Acme's will, which was written in invisible ink. Roger then shocks Valiant with a joy buzzer, and Valiant gives him a kiss, having regained <b>his</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> humor. Valiant happily enters Toontown with Dolores, and Roger with Jessica, followed by the other toons.|$|E
5|$|According to {{continuation}} Bond author Raymond Benson, {{there was}} {{further development of}} the Bond character in Thunderball, with glimpses of both <b>his</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> humour and his own sense of mortality being shown. Felix Leiter had his largest role to date in a Bond story and much of his humour came though, whilst his incapacity, suffered in Live and Let Die, had not led to bitterness or to his being unable to join in with the underwater fight scene {{towards the end of}} the novel.|$|E
5|$|After a {{visit from}} his sick mother, Arletta (Jo Van Fleet), Luke becomes more optimistic about his situation. He {{continually}} confronts the Captain and the guards, and <b>his</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> humor and independence prove to be both contagious and inspiring to the other prisoners. Luke's struggle for supremacy peaks when he leads a work crew in a seemingly impossible but successful effort to complete a road-paving job in less than one day. The other prisoners start to idolize him after he makes and wins a spur-of-the moment bet that he can eat fifty hard-boiled eggs in one hour.|$|E
5000|$|Mumbler. Mumbler is more {{reserved}} than Grumble, but has <b>his</b> own <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> mean-ness that he exhibits in <b>his</b> twisted <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> humor. Mumbler derives {{great pleasure}} from the discomfort of others, especially Grumble. Mumbler {{is hard to}} understand, however, as his giant front teeth muffle his voice terribly, thus making {{it very hard to}} figure out what he’s saying.|$|R

50|$|American Eagle's {{sensory organs}} {{have also been}} {{fortified}} by the radiation-induced mutation. Like his namesake, the Eagle, he has hyperkeen eyesight, able to see at 800 ft what the average human being sees at 20 ft. <b>His</b> <b>senses</b> <b>of</b> hearing, smell, taste, and touch are approximately three times that of an average human being.|$|R
5|$|Beebe {{described}} his religious beliefs {{as a combination}} of Presbyterianism and Buddhism. His religion was largely the result of seeking to combine <b>his</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> awe and wonder at the natural world with a scientific understanding of its workings. He was highly critical of efforts to use science to justify political ideologies, such as socialism or the belief that women were inferior to men. Beebe also disapproved of the eugenic ideas advocated by many biologists in the early 20th century, including some of his contemporaries at the zoo, although this was largely {{out of fear that}} these ideas would alienate friends of the zoo and cause divisions among its staff.|$|E
5|$|British Army Captain Walker goes missing {{during an}} {{expedition}} and is believed dead ("Overture"). His widow, Mrs. Walker, {{gives birth to}} their son, Tommy ("It's a Boy"). Years later, Captain Walker returns home and discovers that his wife has found a new lover. The Captain murders this man in an altercation as Tommy watches. Tommy's mother convinces him {{that he did not}} see or hear the incident and must never tell anyone about it; as a result, he becomes deaf, dumb, and blind to the outside world ("1921"). Tommy now relies on <b>his</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> touch and imagination, developing a fascinating inner psyche ("Amazing Journey/Sparks").|$|E
5|$|Burnet's first book, Biological Aspects of Infectious Disease, was {{published}} in 1940. It had wide influence and was translated into several languages. In 1942 he was made a Fellow of the Royal Society, and in 1944 he travelled to Harvard University to deliver the Dunham Lectures. There he was offered a chair, but he refused and returned to Australia. This was attributed to his nationalistic tendencies, as well as <b>his</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> loyalty to the Hall Institute. During his trip he also visited the US military facility at Fort Bragg, where he discussed his work on influenza with the scientists working there.|$|E

5|$|Burnham {{would not}} smoke and seldom drank alcohol, fearing these habits would injure the acuteness of <b>his</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> smell. He {{found ways to}} train himself in mental patience, took power naps instead of indulging in periods of long sleep, and drank very little liquid. He trained himself to accept these abstinences in order to endure the most appalling fatigues, hunger, thirst, and wounds, so that when {{scouting}} or traveling {{where there was no}} water, he might still be able to exist. On more than one occasion he survived in environments where others would have died, or were in fact dying, of exhaustion. He was quiet-mannered and courteous, according to contemporaries. Their reports describe a man who was neither shy nor self-conscious, who was extremely modest, and who seldom spoke of his many adventures.|$|E
5|$|Despite its title, {{the novel}} does {{not so much}} deal with the crime and its formal punishment, as with Raskolnikov's {{internal}} struggle (the book shows that his punishment results more from his conscience than from the law). Believing society {{would be better for}} it, Raskolnikov commits murder with the idea that he possessed enough intellectual and emotional fortitude to deal with the ramifications, , but <b>his</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> guilt soon overwhelms him to the point of psychological and somatic illness. It is only in the epilogue that he realizes his formal punishment, having decided to confess and end his alienation from society.|$|E
5|$|Eventually, {{tensions}} faded, but {{a bigger}} decision awaited Robert Breckinridge in 1828. He {{was chosen to}} sit on a committee that would draft Kentucky's response to the Nullification Crisis. Because much of South Carolina's reasoning for their actions was based on the logic of the Kentucky Resolutions, which had been supported by Senator John Breckinridge, Robert Breckinridge now had to determine whether he should support the words of his late father or refute them. In the end, his Unionist sympathies overrode <b>his</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> loyalty to his father; he sided with the committee's majority in condemning South Carolina's actions.|$|E
50|$|Joe Saluto, a {{well driller}} {{excavating}} geological samples for a university {{project in the}} small Florida town of Montverde, is contaminated by a strange liquid that transposes <b>his</b> <b>senses</b> <b>of</b> pain and pleasure. Unaware he has been infected with a dangerous virus, he tries to impress Maria, a pretty waitress at the local diner, who is romantically involved with Allen Greenfield.|$|R
50|$|Walsh {{was known}} for <b>his</b> unique <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> style (Example: Checkered Vans with a Pinstriped Suit), {{as well as his}} {{incomparable}} and well known <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> humor.|$|R
60|$|Mr. Van Wyk, leaning forward, {{his face}} gone pink all over, with the starched table-napkin over his knees, was {{inclined}} to mistrust <b>his</b> <b>senses,</b> <b>his</b> power <b>of</b> comprehension, the sanity of his guest.|$|R
5|$|In 2011, a {{new theory}} {{surfaced}} after the newspaper Crónica spoke to the police about {{the cause of the}} accident. The police source mentioned the possibility that Rodrigo's intensive routine might have increased the production of adrenaline in his body. The investigators explained that, if Rodrigo did not release the excess adrenaline through urination after his last concert, he could have lost <b>his</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> distance in relation to Pesquera's Blazer. This could have caused Rodrigo to apply the brake and turn the wheel violently.|$|E
5|$|The {{protagonist of}} Terra Nova is Nikola ap Io, the squad leader of Strike Force Centauri. His older brother, Brandt ap Io, {{is one of}} his subordinates, and the two share a mutual animosity. Other members of the squad include Sarah Walker, the {{daughter}} of a Centauri Council member; Ernest Schuyler, who is known for <b>his</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> humor; and the frank and abrasive Simon Ashford. Each member was given a personality so that the player would form connections with the squad. Commander Arlen MacPherson assumes overall charge of the squad, and he has regular dealings with Hegemony ambassador Creon Pentheus. Live-action full-motion video cutscenes depicting character interaction occasionally play between missions.|$|E
5|$|Waugh {{began at}} Heatherley's in late September 1924, but became {{bored with the}} routine and quickly {{abandoned}} his course. He spent weeks partying in London and Oxford before the overriding need for money led him to apply through an agency for a teaching job. Almost at once, he secured a post at Arnold House, a boys' preparatory school in North Wales, beginning in January 1925. He took with him the notes for his novel, The Temple at Thatch, intending {{to work on it}} in his spare time. Despite the gloomy ambience of the school, Waugh did his best to fulfil the requirements of his position, but a brief return to London and Oxford during the Easter holiday only exacerbated <b>his</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> isolation.|$|E

5|$|Born in 1914, Toshack overcame many {{obstacles}} to reach international level cricket. He was orphaned as an infant, and his early cricket career was hindered because of financial difficulties {{caused by the}} Great Depression. The Second World War prevented Toshack from competing at first-class level until he was into his thirties. In 1945–46, the first season of cricket {{after the end of}} the War, Toshack made his debut at first-class level and after only seven matches in the Sheffield Shield he was selected for Australia's tour of New Zealand. In Wellington, he opened the bowling in a match that was retrospectively classed as an official Test match. Toshack became a regular member of the Australian team, playing in all of its Tests until the 1947–48 series against India. He took his career-best match bowling figures of 11 wickets for 31 runs (11/31) in the First Test but began to suffer recurring knee injuries, and a medical board had to approve his selection for the 1948 England tour. Toshack played in the first four Tests before being injured. After a long convalescence, he attempted a comeback during Australia's 1949–50 season, but further injury forced him to retire. He was a parsimonious bowler, who was popular with crowds for <b>his</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> humour.|$|E
5|$|In the 15 {{years since}} he had left Red River, his {{megalomania}} had grown greater than ever. His ungovernable rages, delusions of grandeur, messianic claims, and dictatorial impulses had all become more extreme; but these violent excesses {{were not the only}} symptoms of his curious mental and moral decline. He had lost his shrewd appreciation of realities. <b>His</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> direction was confused in his purposes were equivocal. He showed, at intervals, a cynical selfishness and the ruthless cupidity.... although in public he professed that his sole aim was the redress of the Métis grievances, and private he was quite ready to promise that if the government made him a satisfactory personal payment of a few thousand dollars he would induce his credulous followers to accept almost any settlement the federal authorities desired, and would quietly leave Canada forever.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Sjahrir {{continued}} to work on negotiations with the Allied forces. On 7October 1946, Sjahrir and the former Dutch Prime Minister, Wim Schermerhorn, agreed to work towards a ceasefire. The discussions were to be moderated by the British diplomat Lord Killearn and involved Sudirman. He took a specially commissioned train to Jakarta, departing on 20October. However, he ordered it to return to Yogyakarta when Dutch troops refused to allow him and his men to enter the city with their weapons, feeling that such an order violated <b>his</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> honour; the Dutch apologised, construing the events as a misunderstanding. Sudirman took another train in late October, arriving at Gambir Station in Jakarta on 1November, where he was greeted by large crowds. The discussions in Jakarta resulted in the drafting of the Linggadjati Agreement on 15 November; the agreement was ratified on 25March 1947, despite heavy opposition from Indonesian nationalists. Sudirman was vocally against the agreement, which he found to be detrimental to Indonesian interests, but considered himself obliged to follow his orders.|$|E

5000|$|Saunderson {{possessed the}} {{friendship}} of leading mathematicians of the time: Isaac Newton, Edmond Halley, Abraham De Moivre and Roger Cotes. <b>His</b> <b>senses</b> <b>of</b> hearing and touch were acute, {{and he could}} carry out mentally long and intricate mathematical calculations. He devised a calculating machine or abacus, by which he could perform arithmetical and algebraic operations by the <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> touch; it was known as his [...] "palpable arithmetic", and was described in his Elements of Algebra.|$|R
60|$|The wind {{brought the}} sounds of the church clock to the window. They listened, and it struck three. Stephen looked at her, saw how pale she was, noted the {{disorder}} of her hair, and the red marks of fingers on her forehead, and felt assured that <b>his</b> <b>senses</b> <b>of</b> sight and hearing had been awake. She held the cup in her hand even now.|$|R
