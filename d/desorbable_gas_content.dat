40|$|Coalbed <b>gas</b> <b>content</b> {{measurements}} {{are commonly used}} in mine safety as well as coalbed methane resource assessment and recovery applications. Gas content determination techniques generally fall into two categories: (1) direct methods which actually measure the volume of gas released from a coal sample sealed into a desorption canister and (2) indirect methods based on empirical correlations, or laboratory derived sorption isotherm gas storage capacity data. Direct <b>gas</b> <b>content</b> determination techniques may be further. subdivided into quick-crushing and extended desorption methods. The quick-crushing methods are primarily used in mine safety applications outside the United States, but have also been used for resource recovery applications. Quick-crushing methods rely on crushing the coal sample soon after collection to release all the <b>desorbable</b> <b>gas,</b> thus significantly shortening {{the amount of time}} required for desorption measurements. However, some data useful for resource recovery applications are lost. Extended desorption techniques are most commonly used for resource assessment and recovery applications where information on desorption rates is useful for reservoir modeling, and for fundamental coalbed methane research. Extended desorption methods allow the gases in the coal sample to desorb under controlled laboratory conditions until a defined low desorption rate cutoff point is reached. The sample may then be crushed to measure the amount of gas remaining within the sample. Direct method techniques for <b>gas</b> <b>content</b> measurement are the focus of this paper...|$|R

In {{order to}} {{determine}} coal seam <b>gas</b> <b>content</b> accurately, the single factor method was adopted to study geological factors that affect coal seam <b>gas</b> <b>content</b> of a coal mine.

Factors such as effective trapping thickness, moisture content and ash content are regarded as secondary factors. Then the SVM theory was used {{to set up a}} nonlinear prediction model between coal seam <b>gas</b> <b>content</b> and main controlling factors, and the <b>gas</b> <b>content</b> was predicted.

40|$|Shale <b>gas</b> <b>content</b> {{is the key}} {{parameter}} for {{shale gas}} potential evaluation and favorable area prediction. Therefore, {{it is very important}} to determine shale <b>gas</b> <b>content</b> accurately. Generally, we use the US Bureau of Mines (USBM) method for coal reservoirs to calculate the <b>gas</b> <b>content</b> of shale reservoirs. However, shale reservoirs are different from coal reservoirs in depth, pressure, core collection, etc. This method would inevitably cause problems. In order to make the USBM method more suitable for shale reservoirs, an improved USBM method is put forward on the basis of systematic analysis of core pressure history and temperature history during shale gas degassing. The improved USBM method modifies the calculation method of the gas loss time, and determines the temperature balance time of water heating. In addition, we give the calculation method of adsorption <b>gas</b> <b>content</b> and free <b>gas</b> <b>content,</b> especially the new method of calculating the oil dissolved <b>gas</b> <b>content</b> and water dissolved <b>gas</b> <b>content</b> that are easily neglected. We used the direct method (USBM and the improved USBM) and the indirect method (including the calculation of adsorption gas, free gas and the dissolved gas method) to calculate the shale <b>gas</b> <b>content</b> of 16 shale samples of the Triassic Yanchang Formation in the Southeastern Ordos Basin, China. The results of the improved USBM method show that the total shale <b>gas</b> <b>content</b> is high, with an average of 3. 97 m 3 /t, and the lost shale <b>gas</b> <b>content</b> is the largest proportion with an average of 62 %. The total shale <b>gas</b> <b>content</b> calculated by the improved USBM method is greater than that of the USBM method. The results of the indirect method show that the total shale <b>gas</b> <b>content</b> is large, with an average of 4. 11 m 3 /t, and the adsorption shale <b>gas</b> <b>content</b> is the largest proportion with an average of 71 %. The oil dissolved shale <b>gas</b> <b>content</b> which should be paid attention to accounts for about 7. 8 %. The discrepancy between the direct method and indirect method is reduced by using the improved USBM method, and the improved USBM method could be more practical and accurate than the USBM method...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{measurement}} of <b>gas</b> <b>content</b> {{plays an important}} role in mine safety and mine planning for coal and gas recovery. A number of methods exist to determine gas content; direct and indirect methods. The direct method of fast desorption test is the preferred method of <b>gas</b> <b>content</b> measurement. The indirect methods are based on either empirical correlations or laboratory derived sorption isotherms. Recent research has identified two new, semi-direct methods of estimating total <b>gas</b> <b>content</b> using early stage gas desorption rate measurement. Both techniques, if adopted, can provide operators with an indication of <b>gas</b> <b>content</b> and particularly whether the content is above or below the outburst threshold limit. A total of 930 samples, were analysed from two local mines, with known gas drainage problems and high degree of variability in both the insitu <b>gas</b> <b>content</b> and composition. Two specific aspects of the analysis included; the relationship of the three <b>gas</b> <b>content</b> components, Q 1, Q 2 and Q 3, and the initial gas desorption rate relative to total <b>gas</b> <b>content.</b> Based on the relationship between desorption rate and total <b>gas</b> <b>content,</b> it was possible for minesite technical staff to provide operational personnel with an estimate of maximum expected total <b>gas</b> <b>content</b> from a particular core sample, based on the initial desorption rate value determined from Q 2 field measurement data collected by the drillers or site geologists...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: Gas content can be {{considered}} the most important parameter for assessing emissions from coal seams during and post mining. Traditionally, the purpose of <b>gas</b> <b>content</b> determination was to assess gas outburst potentials and to quantify the magnitude of gas emissions into underground headings and at the coal face. Therefore, it’s a traditional definition; measurement and determination are based on these objectives. However, the calculation of emissions from mining {{for the purpose of}} establishing a greenhouse gas inventory would require new definitions for <b>gas</b> <b>content</b> and new measurement methods. Moreover, errors inherent in measuring <b>gas</b> <b>content</b> need to be quantified so that the uncertainty of emissions inventory can be evaluated. Therefore, various definitions of <b>gas</b> <b>content</b> in relation to the purpose of its use are suggested. Anew method of measurement for low <b>gas</b> <b>content</b> coals is discussed. Moreover, various parameters influencing the value of measured <b>gas</b> <b>content</b> are discussed and errors of estimation using the direct method are evaluated...|$|R

40|$|This study {{performs}} a block scale investigation on <b>gas</b> <b>content</b> of a coal reservoir in Zhengzhuang Block {{of the southern}} Qinshui basin in China. The <b>gas</b> <b>content</b> of Coal Seam No. 3 in this coal reservoir was measured in field and laboratory in conjunction with tests on coal properties such as adsorption isotherm, maximum vitrinite reflectance, coal composition and maceral component etc. Total 36 coal cores collected from 3 adjacent coalmines in the southern Qinshui basin were investigated, including analysis of logging data from the drilling wells. The investigations provided experimental data for block scale modeling and visualization analyses on the correlation between <b>gas</b> <b>content</b> and the key factors such as coal properties and geological conditions of the coal reservoir. Data obtained by field and lab tests were analyzed by statistical models in order to correlate <b>gas</b> <b>content</b> and individual type of coal properties and geological variables. The statistical model was then used to map the <b>gas</b> <b>content</b> of the target coal seam in the studied area, resulting in a flood map of <b>gas</b> <b>content</b> at a 1 : 50000 scale.

These visualized maps provide useful geological interpretation for block scale investigation of the comprehensive relationships between the <b>gas</b> <b>content</b> and the coal properties and regional structure in the given coal reservoir. The results show that <b>gas</b> <b>content</b> has little correlation with coal rank, maceral composition, coal thickness, cap and bottom lithology, while it is highly related to the structural properties such as burial depth and effective cover thickness.

However, the spatial distribution of <b>gas</b> <b>content</b> can be generated via two different geological modeling processes: (1) The <b>gas</b> <b>content</b> distribution is generated by geological modeling based on the interpreted <b>gas</b> <b>content</b> at boreholes; (2) distributions of <b>gas</b> <b>content</b> related logs or coal properties are generated firstly, then the <b>gas</b> <b>content</b> distribution {{is calculated based on}} the spatial distributions of logs or coal properties by the relationship between the <b>gas</b> <b>content</b> and logs or coal properties. This paper presents a study to compare the impact of these two processes on CBM resource estimation for coal seam no. 3 (CS- 3) in southeast Qinshui Basin, China. Well logs from 22 wells, laboratory data from five wells and well tops from 131 wells for CS- 3 are used in log interpretation and geological modeling. The simple kriging (SK) is used to build the structural model and the coal distribution. Weighted and unweighted omni-directional variograms for structural residual and coal thickness are calculated using an in-house program. Logs of gamma-ray (GR) and density (DEN or RHOB) are distributed in 3 D by using sequential Gaussian simulation (SGS) with SK algorithm. Artificial neural network (ANN) is used to build the relationship of the measured raw <b>gas</b> <b>content</b> (RGC; <b>gas</b> <b>content</b> in raw coal basis) with the logs of GR, DEN and measured depth (MD). Then the RGC is distributed in 3 D by the two geological modeling processes. CBM resources are calculated in 3 D based on the cells 2 ̆ 7 volume, coal density and RGC. Results show that RGC increases with an increase in burial depth.

The milling atmosphere and the type of process control agent have been varied in order to optimize the <b>gas</b> <b>contents</b> and furthermore to take advantage of additional strengthening by oxide or carbide formation. Measurements of the microhardness, the bulk density, the homogeneity of the particle distribution and the <b>gas</b> <b>contents</b> have been done. The progress in reaction milling of graphite has been studied by XRD measurements...|$|R
