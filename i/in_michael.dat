Even in Euboea, Licario's major gain and personal fief, the Lombard barons managed to complete their reconquest of the entire island by 1296. Nevertheless, Licario proved {{one of the most}} successful military leaders <b>in</b> <b>Michael</b> VIII's employ, and his victories greatly enhanced the emperor's own standing and prestige amongst the Latins.
