5|$|Before the {{hurricane}} began affecting land, the U.S. Weather Bureau issued northeast storm warnings from Myrtle Beach, South Carolina to Cape Hatteras, North Carolina. The agency also advised small boats <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>region</b> <b>to</b> remain at port during the storm. Evacuations were ordered {{for a few}} islands in the Outer Banks, and several thousand tourists voluntarily left the coastline for safer areas.

5|$|At {{the start}} of August 1943, his tally stood at 42, but Hartmann's tally had more than doubled by the end. The Red Army began a counteroffensive <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>region</b> <b>to</b> contain the German {{operation}} and destroy its forces (Operation Kutuzov and Operation Polkovodets Rumyantsev). JG52 was engaged in defensive operations throughout the month. On 1 August 1943 Hartmann became an ace-in-a day by claiming five victories. Another four followed on 3 August and five on the 4 August. Another five were claimed destroyed on the 5 August, a single on the 6 August, and a further five on 7 August. On 8 and 9 August he claimed another four Soviet fighters. Hartmann's last claim of the month came on 20th day, when he accounted for an IL-2 for his 90th victory. The next month, he was appointed Staffelkapitän of 9./JG52.|$|E
5|$|Between World War I and World War II, the Auxois was {{the pride}} of {{regional}} farmers. Before the advent of motorization, it was the preferred pulling animal, even for slow work, winning out over the local Charolais cattle breed used as oxen. The Auxois was bred solely for agricultural work, and used exclusively for this purpose. The strongest horses were used for multi-horse hitches {{in the fields and}} for logging. The Auxois competed in popularity with the Nivernais horse, and it was not uncommon for farmers <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>region</b> <b>to</b> have both the black-coated Nivernais and the red-coated Ardennais and Auxois to satisfy the color preferences of all potential buyers.|$|E

The brigade also dispatched optometry teams to soldiers <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>region</b> <b>to</b> ensure they had all the eyesight testing they needed.

5|$|Fortunately for the Germans, Emirau {{was one of}} the few islands <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>region</b> <b>to</b> {{not have}} a Royal Australian Navy-supplied radio to contact the Australian authorities. The two European {{families}} on the island provided the released prisoners with supplies, and sent a canoe to Kavieng in New Ireland to notify the Australian colonial government. A schooner was dispatched to bring additional supplies to Emirau, and arrived there on 24December. The colonial administrator of New Britain and further supplies was also flown to Emirau on board a flying boat. The released prisoners were embarked onto the steamer Nellore on 29December to be transported to Townsville in Queensland, where they arrived on 1 January1941. They provided useful intelligence on the German raiders' operations, and the German Naval Staff issued a directive on 19February 1941 prohibiting raiders from releasing further prisoners.|$|E
5|$|George W. Jones, {{who would}} later become a U.S. Senator from Iowa, arrived in the Sinsinawa Mound area in 1827, and in 1828 {{established}} a mining settlement there. The first structure at the settlement was Jones's own log cabin, built {{during the spring of}} 1828 in two days. The cabin measured 49 feet (14.9 m) by 17feet (5.2m) and each room had one door and one window. When the Black Hawk War began four years later he also built a small fort at the site. The remains of the fort, one of many constructed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>region</b> <b>to</b> protect local residents, are said to still stand {{at the entrance to the}} Sinsinawa Dominican complex. One of the men who assisted Jones in building the fort's blockhouse was Enoch Robinson, a soldier who later helped bury the victims of the Sinsinawa Mound raid. At the time of the attack Jones was with Henry Dodge's militia volunteers, on the way to meet overall commander General Henry Atkinson at Lake Koshkonong, then a marsh region.|$|E

5|$|In 1796 British {{control of}} the region was {{challenged}} by a large and powerful French frigate squadron sent to the Indian Ocean under Contre-amiral Pierre César Charles de Sercey. Sercey's squadron operated against British trade for two years with little success; attempts to raid the China trade and coordinate with a Spanish Navy squadron at Manila in the Philippines all ending in failure. Growing resentment on Île de France {{at the cost of}} maintaining the squadron eventually required most of the ships to return to France. The survivors, forced to operate independently, were subsequently defeated and captured by the Royal Navy in a series of individual engagements in 1799. By 1800 British {{control of the}} Indian Ocean was again assured, Rainier deploying his ships in trade protection duties and in the Red Sea to support the invasion of Egypt in 1801. At {{the end of the war}} in 1802 the Peace of Amiens reverted the situation <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>region</b> <b>to</b> its pre-war state, Britain returning all seized colonies except for Ceylon.|$|E
5|$|In 1925, {{just two}} years after the advent of the Cine-Kodak motion picture camera, MacMurray began making amateur films of life and travels in China, such as his trips to the Great Wall of China and a journey down the Yangtze River. One film {{depicted}} the procession of Sun Yat-sen's body from its original burial place in Peking to a new mausoleum in Nanking. Another film recorded in April 1928 captured scenes of daily life in Kalgan, north of Peking. MacMurray, along with his wife and sister, had traveled to Kalgan and Changpeh with Roy Chapman Andrews, an American explorer and naturalist who made multiple expeditions to the Gobi desert. During the civil war in 1928, however, rogue brigands and soldiers had made travel difficult <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>region.</b> <b>To</b> secure passage between Kalgan and Changpeh, MacMurray enlisted the aid of local warlord Chang Tso-lin, who provided an escort of 50 cavalry, 8 cars, and 150 camels.|$|E
5|$|In 1953, Woodruff {{moved to}} Dunedin {{to take up}} a {{position}} as the Chair of Surgery at the University of Otago Dunedin School of Medicine, New Zealand's only medical school at that time. Woodruff had earlier failed in his applications for the corresponding position at St Mary's in London and St Andrews University in Edinburgh. While in Dunedin, Woodruff conducted research on the use of white blood cells to increase tolerance for allografts in rats. This line of research proved to be largely unsuccessful, but some of Woodruff's other projects did well. Among his more important accomplishments in the period, Woodruff established a frozen skin bank for burn treatment. As there was no plastic surgeon in the city, Woodruff ended up being responsible for treating burns. He also worked on the phenomenon known as runt disease (graft versus host disease). Although Woodruff had been productive in four years in New Zealand, Dunedin had a population of roughly 100,000, so there were not enough people <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>region</b> <b>to</b> supply a clinical medical school, so he began to look for an appointment elsewhere.|$|E

5|$|In August 1964, the United States Navy {{reported}} they {{were attacked by}} torpedo boats of the North Vietnamese Navy in {{what became known as}} the Tonkin Gulf Incident. In response to the perceived aggression of Communist forces in Southeast Asia, the United States Congress passed the Tonkin Gulf Resolution which enabled U.S. President Lyndon B. Johnson to deploy conventional military forces <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>region</b> <b>to</b> prevent further attacks by the North Vietnamese. Immediately after the Tonkin Gulf Resolution was passed, Johnson ordered the bombing of North Vietnamese Navy bases in retaliation for the reported attacks on U.S. Navy warships between 2 and 4 August 1964. However, the Viet Cong forces in South Vietnam were not deterred by the threat of U.S. retaliation.|$|E
5|$|Lewis Cass, the {{governor}} of Michigan Territory, and Thomas McKenney, the Superintendent of Indian Affairs, were hosting a treaty conference near Green Bay when they learned of the attacks. To discourage {{the spread of the}} uprising, Cass promptly invited Native Americans <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>region</b> <b>to</b> come to the treaty grounds to receive gifts and food; more than 2,000 people eventually arrived. McKenney warned the Ho-Chunk chiefs in attendance {{that the only way to}} avoid an American military invasion of their homeland was to surrender those responsible for the attacks. Other American officials met with other Native leaders, including Keokuk and Wabokieshiek, and urged them to stay out of the war.|$|E

As such, the headquarters element took command of military police units already operating in the country. The Brigade provided policing duties, based in Long Binh along with the 89th Military Police Group. During that time it was a subordinate unit of the 18th Military Police Brigade. It received its distinctive unit insignia on 12 November 1969. The group operated in Vietnam until the pullout of U.S. forces from the nation, receiving ten campaign streamers for its role in the conflict.|$|E
