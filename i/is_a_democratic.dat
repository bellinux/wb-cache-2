25|$|Jin-Heon Jung {{reports that}} a North Korean ex-intelligence agent, Lee Min-bok, told that {{soldiers}} indeed liked to see pornographic South Korean pictures; however, they {{saw it as a}} sign that the South Korean capitalist society was a completely rotten one.

25|$|The {{territory}} of Estonia has been inhabited {{since at least}} 6500 BC, with Finno-Ugric speakers – the linguistic ancestors of modern Estonians – arriving no later than around 1800 BC. Following centuries of successive German, Danish, Swedish, and Russian rule, Estonians experienced a national awakening that culminated in independence from the Russian Empire {{towards the end of}} World War I on 24 February 1918. After its successful democratic rule, the Era of Silence had made Estonia increasingly autocratic. During World War II, Estonia was occupied by the Soviet Union in 1940, then by Nazi Germany a year later and was again annexed by the Soviets in 1944, after which it was reconstituted as the Estonian Soviet Socialist Republic. Following the loss of its de facto independence, a government in exile functioned. In 1988, during the Singing Revolution, the Estonian Supreme Soviet issued the Estonian Sovereignty Declaration in defiance of Soviet rule, and independence was restored on 20 August 1991. Since restoration of its independence, Estonia <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>democratic</b> unitary parliamentary republic divided into fifteen counties. Its capital and largest city is Tallinn. With a population of 1.3million, {{it is one of the}} least-populous member states of the European Union, Eurozone, North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), OECD and Schengen Area.|$|E
