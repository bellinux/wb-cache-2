60|$|By degrees {{a certain}} number of people began to come down the stairs and to pass through the hall, and in this dim light their figures possessed a sort of grace and beauty, {{although}} they were all unknown people. Sometimes they went straight through and out into the garden by the swing door, sometimes they stopped {{for a few minutes and}} bent over the tables and began turning over the newspapers. Terence and Rachel sat watching them through their half-closed eyelids--the Johnsons, the Parkers, the Baileys, the Simmons', the Lees, the Morleys, the Campbells, the Gardiners. Some were dressed in white flannels and were carrying racquets under their arms, some were short, some tall, some were only children, and some perhaps were servants, but they all had their standing, their reason for following each other through the hall, their money, their position, whatever it might be. Terence soon gave up looking at them, for he was tired; and, closing his eyes, he fell half asleep in his chair. Rachel watched the people for some time longer; she was fascinated by the certainty and the grace of their movements, and by the inevitable way in which they seemed to follow each other, and loiter and pass on and disappear. But after a time her thoughts wandered, and she began to think of the dance, which had been held in this room, only then the room itself looked quite different. Glancing round, she could hardly believe that it was the same room. It had looked so bare and so bright and formal on that night when they came into it out of the darkness; it had been filled, too, with little red, excited faces, always moving, and people so brightly dressed and so animated that they did not seem in the least like real people, nor <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>feel</b> <b>that</b> you could talk to them. And now the room was dim and quiet, and beautiful silent people passed through it, to whom you could go and say anything you liked. She felt herself amazingly secure as she sat in her arm-chair, and able to review not only the night of the dance, but the entire past, tenderly and humorously, as if she had been turning in a fog for a long time, and could now see exactly where she had turned. For the methods by which she had reached her present position, seemed to her very strange, and the strangest thing about them was that she had not known where they were leading her. That was the strange thing, that one did not know where one was going, or what one wanted, and followed blindly, suffering so much in secret, always unprepared and amazed and knowing nothing; but one thing led to another and by degrees something had formed itself out of nothing, and so one reached at last this calm, this quiet, this certainty, and it was this process that people called living. Perhaps, then, every one really knew as she knew now where they were going; and things formed themselves into a pattern not only for her, but for them, and in that pattern lay satisfaction and meaning. When she looked back she could see that a meaning of some kind was apparent in the lives of her aunts, and in the brief visit of the Dalloways whom she would never see again, and in the life of her father.|$|E

After {{a discussion about the}} Newbery Award, as one unit of study, the class was assigned to read a Newbery Award book and a runner-up of a particular year and do a comparative study of included of these two books. The guide questions posed by the instructor included the following: 1) <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>feel</b> <b>that</b> these books were of literary merit? What are the individual strengths and weaknesses of these books? 2) <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>feel</b> <b>that</b> the Award should have been given to the book that won the award? Or, <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>feel</b> <b>that</b> the runner-up deserved the award? Why? The purposes of this assignment were to have the students engage in critical analyses of books for children and to employ criteria by which children's books could be reviewed, evaluated, and judged. I chose to do my comparative study of books that received Newbery honors during 1959. The two books selected were The Witch of Blackbird Pond by Elizabeth George Speare and The Family Under the Bridge by Natalie Savage Carlson...|$|R
