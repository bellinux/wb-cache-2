In this paper, we study the performance of SVMs, which have gained great success in many real applications, in the imbalanced data context. Through empirical analysis, we show that SVMs suffer from biased decision boundaries, and that their prediction performance drops dramatically when the data is highly skewed. We propose to combine an <b>integrated</b> <b>sampling</b> technique with an ensemble of SVMs to improve the prediction performance. The <b>integrated</b> <b>sampling</b> technique combines both over-sampling and under-sampling techniques. Through empirical study, we show that our method outperforms individual SVMs as well as several other state-of-the-art classifiers. ...|$|R

40|$|Conventionally, the {{dosimetry}} {{is carried}} out using radon and thoron gas concentration measurements and doses have been assigned using assumed equilibrium factors for the progeny species, which is inadequate pertaining to the variations in equilibrium factors and possibly due to significant thoron. In fact, since the true exposures depend upon the intricate mechanisms of progeny deposition in the lung, therefore an integrated approach {{for the assessment of}} progeny is essential. In this context, the recently developed deposition based progeny concentration measurement techniques (DTPS: Direct Thoron progeny sensors and DRPS: Direct Radon progeny sensors) appear to be best suited for radiological risk assessments both among occupational workers and general study populations. DTPS and DRPS consist of aluminized mylar mounted LR 115 type passive detectors, which essentially detects the alpha particles emitted from the deposited progeny atoms on the detector surface. It gives direct measure of progeny activity concentrations in air. DTPS has a lower limit of detection limit of 0. 1 Bq/m(3) whereas that for DRPS is 1 Bq/m(3), hence are perfectly suitable for indoor environments. These DTPS and DRPS can be capped with 200 -mesh type wire-screen to measure the coarse fraction of the progeny concentration and the corresponding coarse fraction deposition velocities as well as the time integrated fine fraction. DTPS and DRPS can also be lodged in an <b>integrated</b> <b>sampler</b> wherein the wire-mesh and filter-paper are arranged in an array in flow-mode, to measure the fine and coarse fraction concentration separately and simultaneously. The details are further discussed in the paper. (C) 2014 AIP Publishing LLC...|$|E
40|$|Size-resolved aerosol {{mass and}} {{chemical}} composition were measured during the Pittsburgh Air Quality Study. Daily {{samples were collected}} for 12 months from July 2001 to June 2002. Micro-orifice uniform deposit impactors (MOUDIs) were used to collect aerosol samples of fine particulate matter smaller than 10 mum. Measurements of PM 0. 056, PM 0. 10, PM 0. 18, PM 0. 32, PM 0. 56, PM 1. 0, PM 1. 8 and PM 2. 5 with the MOUDI are available for the full study period. Seasonal variations in the concentrations are observed for all size cuts. Higher concentrations are observed {{during the summer and}} lower during the winter. Comparison between the PM 2. 5 measurements by the MOUDI and other integrated PM samplers reveals good agreement. Good correlation is observed for PM 10 between the MOUDI and an <b>integrated</b> <b>sampler</b> but the MOUDI underestimates PM 10 by 20 %. Bouncing of particles from higher stages of the MOUDI (> PM 2. 5) is not a major problem because of the low concentrations of coarse particles in the area. The main cause of coarse particle losses appears to be losses to the wall of the MOUDI. Samples were collected on aluminum foils for analysis of carbonaccous material and on Teflon filters for analysis of particle mass and inorganic anions and cations. Daily samples were analyzed during the summer (July 2001) and the winter intensives (January 2002). During the summer around 50 % of the organic material is lost from the aluminum foils as compared to a filter-based sampler. These losses are due to volatilization and bounce-off from the MOUDI stages. High nitrate losses from the MOUDI are also observed during the summer (above 70 %). Good agreement between the gravimetrically determined mass and the sum of the masses of the individual compounds is obtained, if the lost mass from organics and the aerosol water content are included for the summer. For the winter no significant losses of material are detected and there exists reasonable agreement between the gravimetrical mass and the sum of the concentrations of the individual compounds.

Furthermore, the signal intensity of myoglobin digests was improved by over 10 times.

40|$|Advanced Technology Systems, Inc. (ATS), with Desert Research Institute (DRI) and Ohio University as subcontractors, was {{contracted}} by the NETL in September 1998 {{to manage}} the Upper Ohio River Valley Project (UORVP), which included the establishment and operation of four ambient air monitoring sites located in the Upper Ohio River Valley (UORV). Two urban and two rural monitoring sites {{were included in the}} UORVP. The four sites selected for the UOVRP were collocated at existing local and/or state air quality monitoring stations. The goal of the UORVP was to characterize the nature and composition of PM{sub 2. 5 } and its precursor gases. In the process, the objectives of the UORVP were to examine the ambient air concentrations of PM{sub 2. 5 } as compared with the promulgated PM{sub 2. 5 } standards, the geographical, seasonal and temporal variations of ambient air concentrations of PM{sub 2. 5 }, the primary chemical constituents of PM{sub 2. 5 }, and the correlations between ambient air concentrations of PM{sub 2. 5 } and its precursor gases, other gaseous pollutants and meteorological parameters. A variety of meteorological and pollutant measurement devices, including several different PM{sub 2. 5 } samplers that provided either real-time or integrated concentration data, were deployed at the monitoring sites. The frequency of <b>integrated</b> <b>sampling</b> varied throughout the UORVP study period and was as follows: (1) ''Intensive'' sampling periods were defined as periods in which samples were collected on a relatively frequent basis (ranged from 6 -hour <b>integrated</b> <b>samples</b> collected round-the-clock to one 24 -hour <b>integrated</b> <b>sample</b> collected every third day). (2) ''Background'' sampling periods were defined as periods in which 24 -hour <b>integrated</b> <b>samples</b> were collected every third or sixth day.

40|$|In this work, a novel <b>integrated</b> <b>sample</b> {{preparation}} {{device for}} SDS-assisted proteome analysis was developed, by which proteins dissolved in 4 % (w/v) SDS were first diluted by 50 % methanol, and then SDS was online removed by a hollow fiber membrane interface (HFMI) with 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate (pH 8. 0) as an exchange buffer, finally digested by an immobilized enzyme reactor (IMER). To evaluate {{the performance of}} such an integrated device, bovine serum albumin dissolved in 4 % (w/v) SDS as a model sample was analyzed; it could be found that similar to that obtained by direct analysis of BSA digests without SDS (the sequence coverage of 60. 3 +/- 1. 0 %, n= 3), with HFMI as an interface for SDS removal, BSA was identified with the sequence coverage of 61. 0 +/- 1. 0 % (n= 3). However, without SDS removal by HFMI, BSA could not be digested by the IMER and none peptides could be detected. In addition, such an <b>integrated</b> <b>sample</b> preparation device was also applied {{for the analysis of}} SDS extracted proteins from rat brain, compared to those obtained by filter-aided sample preparation (FASP), not only the identified protein group and unique peptide number were increased by 12 % and 39 % respectively, but also the sample pretreatment time was shortened from 24 h to 4 h.

40|$|Umbrella {{sampling}} is {{an efficient}} method for {{the calculation of}} free energy changes of a system along well-defined reaction coordinates. However, when there exist multiple parallel channels along the reaction coordinate or hidden barriers in directions perpendicular to the reaction coordinate, {{it is difficult for}} conventional umbrella sampling to reach convergent sampling within limited simulation time. Here, we propose an approach to combine umbrella <b>sampling</b> with the <b>integrated</b> tempering <b>sampling</b> method. The umbrella sampling method is applied to chemically more relevant degrees of freedom that possess significant barriers. The <b>integrated</b> tempering <b>sampling</b> method is used to facilitate the sampling of other degrees of freedom which may possess statistically non-negligible barriers. The combined method is applied to two model systems, butane and ACE-NME molecules, and shows significantly improved sampling efficiencies as compared to standalone conventional umbrella <b>sampling</b> or <b>integrated</b> tempering <b>sampling</b> approaches. Further analyses suggest that the enhanced performance of the new method come from the complemented advantages of umbrella sampling with a well-defined reaction coordinate and <b>integrated</b> tempering <b>sampling</b> in orthogonal space.

With such a system, the deglycosylated glycopeptide from the digests of avidin with the coexistence of 50 times (mass ratio) BSA could be selectively detected, and the detection limit as low as 5 fmol was achieved.
