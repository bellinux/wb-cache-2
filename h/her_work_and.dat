5|$|Murray did {{not respond}} {{directly}} to the criticisms of her work, but reacted to her critics in a hostile manner; in later life she asserted that she eventually ceased reading reviews of <b>her</b> <b>work,</b> <b>and</b> believed that her critics were simply acting {{out of their own}} Christian prejudices to non-Christian religion.|$|E
5|$|Cameron's {{recognition}} {{as an artist}} increased after her death, when her paintings made appearances in exhibitions across the U.S. As a result of increased attention on Parsons, Cameron's life also gained greater coverage in the early 2000s. In 2006, the Cameron–Parsons Foundation was created to preserve and promote <b>her</b> <b>work,</b> <b>and</b> in 2011 a biography of Cameron written by Spencer Kansa was published.|$|E
50|$|A {{permanent}} collection of <b>her</b> <b>works</b> <b>and</b> papers {{is held by}} the University of Puget Sound.|$|R

5|$|Carson and {{the others}} {{involved}} with publication of Silent Spring expected fierce criticism. They were particularly concerned {{about the possibility of}} being sued for libel. Carson was also undergoing radiation therapy to combat her spreading cancer, and expected to have little energy to devote to defending <b>her</b> <b>work</b> <b>and</b> responding to critics. In preparation for the anticipated attacks, Carson and her agent attempted to amass as many prominent supporters as possible before the book's release.|$|E
5|$|During her London winter, Potter {{developed}} <b>her</b> <b>work,</b> <b>and,</b> by {{the middle}} of June 1904, Benjamin Bunny was almost finished. Many of the sketches from her Fawe Park holiday were little altered in their migration to the book, and, upon completion of the work, Potter declared she was relieved to be finished with the rabbits.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{commercial}} success of her early novels such as Adventures of the Wishing-Chair (1937) and The Enchanted Wood (1939), Blyton {{went on to}} build a literary empire, sometimes producing fifty books a year {{in addition to her}} prolific magazine and newspaper contributions. Her writing was unplanned and sprang largely from her unconscious mind; she typed her stories as events unfolded before her. The sheer volume of <b>her</b> <b>work</b> <b>and</b> the speed with which it was produced led to rumours that Blyton employed an army of ghost writers, a charge she vigorously denied.|$|E
50|$|This list {{contains}} the names {{for some of}} <b>her</b> <b>works</b> <b>and</b> the movements and sections contained within each work.|$|R

5|$|In 2010, the Bavarian Administrative Court {{ruled that}} a woman working in a children's daycare centre, whose {{employment}} had been terminated when her ex-husband identified her as a Scientologist, should be reinstated. The woman had demonstrated to the court's satisfaction that her Scientological beliefs were irrelevant to her work. According to the agreement that concluded the case, she promised not to use Scientology methods in <b>her</b> <b>work,</b> <b>and</b> to inform the children's parents of her membership in Scientology.|$|E
5|$|Other critics, {{especially}} women who identify as feminists but sharply differ with Dworkin's style or positions, have offered nuanced views, suggesting that Dworkin {{called attention to}} real and important problems, but that her legacy as a whole had been destructive to the women's movement. <b>Her</b> <b>work</b> <b>and</b> activism on pornography—especially {{in the form of}} the Antipornography Civil Rights Ordinance—drew heavy criticism from groups such as the Feminist Anti-Censorship Task Force (FACT) and even some fellow anti-pornography feminists, who criticized the Dworkin–MacKinnon legal approach as undermining civil rights.|$|E
5|$|Towards the end {{of senior}} high school, Estianty and her father began arguing about <b>her</b> <b>work</b> <b>and</b> poor {{performance}} at school. Estianty threatened to move out; in response, Sigit said he would support her, on the condition she continue her studies at a state university. Estianty enrolled at the University of Indonesia, first in the Dutch literature programme then in the communications programme. During this time she became a backing vocalist for Dhani's band Dewa 19; the two married in the late 1990s.|$|E

5|$|She {{published}} articles and books on <b>her</b> <b>work</b> <b>and</b> her lobbying {{was instrumental in}} the passage of several educational acts in the mid-nineteenth century. She was the first woman to have a paper published by the Statistical Society of London. She addressed many conferences and meetings and became {{known as one of the}} foremost public speakers of her time.

In later years she visited Europe and America, carrying on her campaigns of penal and educational reform.|$|E
5|$|Susan {{plans to}} tell the police all that the group has done. Before she can inform the police, Mark, Jeff, and Betsy tie Susan up, and Jeff and Betsy leave to hide Mr. Griffin's car. Mark sets her {{curtains}} on fire but Susan is saved by Kathy Griffin, Mr. Griffin's wife, who came over to her house with a detective for an interview. The detective catches Mark as he attempts {{to leave the house}} through a window. Several days later, Susan's mother tells her that all of those involved will face varying criminal charges, with her lawyer attempting to get Susan off with no charges in exchange for testimony. Mark will face three trials, one each for the deaths of Mr. Griffin and David's grandmother, and one for the attempted murder of Susan. Mrs. Griffin leaves Susan a note that her husband had written before his death, praising Susan for <b>her</b> <b>work</b> <b>and</b> recognizing her potential.|$|E
5|$|The {{musical score}} for the action {{role-playing}} game Final Fantasy XV, originally a spin-off game called Final Fantasy Versus XIII, was composed primarily by Yoko Shimomura, whose previous work included Parasite Eve, Legend of Mana, and the Kingdom Hearts series. Final Fantasy XV was her first time composing for the Final Fantasy series, so she took a more tentative approach than her Kingdom Hearts projects. Shimomura was involved with the project when XV was still titled Versus XIII, being hired to composed the music in 2006 and staying on through its ten-year development cycle. In 2010, Shimomura was still forming a framework for the game's music, ensuring that the music fitted the game without it solidifying into an image that seemed wrong. Her work over the time prior to its rebranding as Final Fantasy XV was fairly sporadic. Shimomura worked on around 80% of the music: the rest were variations on <b>her</b> <b>work</b> <b>and</b> other themes created by others involved in the soundtrack. Other composers {{who worked on the}} game were Tetsuya Shibata, Yoshino Aoki, Yoshitaka Suzuki and Mitsuhiro Ohta; the latter two assisted with arrangements.|$|E
50|$|Researching Marie Elizabeth de LaFite is {{difficult}} {{due to a}} lack of primary sources. Additionally, the information we do have on her often provides conflicting information. The discrepancies in information include two documents that claims she was born in 1750, a whole 13 years after two other sources. There is a lack of English translations of <b>her</b> <b>works</b> <b>and</b> letters, contributing to them being unavailable in the United States. The majority of <b>her</b> <b>work</b> is kept in The Hague or Amsterdam in the Netherlands, making it unattainable from within the United States. Other libraries that have <b>her</b> <b>works</b> <b>and</b> translations include ones in Rotterdam and Stockholm.|$|R
