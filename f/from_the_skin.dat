5|$|Hypertrophic scars are uncommon, and are {{characterized}} by increased collagen content after the abnormal healing response. They are described as firm and raised <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>skin.</b> Hypertrophic scars remain within the original margins of the wound, whereas keloid scars can form scar tissue outside of these borders. Keloid scars from acne occur more often in men and people with darker skin, and usually occur on {{the trunk of the}} body.|$|E
5|$|Acne, {{also known}} as acne vulgaris, is a {{long-term}} skin disease that occurs when hair follicles are clogged with dead skin cells and oil <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>skin.</b> It is characterized by blackheads or whiteheads, pimples, oily skin, and possible scarring. It primarily affects areas of the skin with a relatively high number of oil glands, including the face, {{upper part of the}} chest, and back. The resulting appearance can lead to anxiety, reduced self-esteem and, in extreme cases, depression or thoughts of suicide.|$|E
5|$|All {{described}} {{specimens of}} Sinosauropteryx preserve integumentary structures (filaments arising <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>skin)</b> which most palaeontologists interpret as very primitive type of feathers. These short, down-like filaments are preserved {{along the back}} half of the skull, the arms, neck, back, and {{top and bottom of}} the tail. Additional patches of feathers have been identified {{on the sides of the}} body, and palaeontologists Chen, Dong and Zheng proposed that the density of the feathers on the back and the randomness of the patches elsewhere on the body indicated the animals would have been fully feathered in life, with the ventral feathers having been removed by decomposition.|$|E

5000|$|A {{small fire}} {{was built in}} the colder months, and easily kept the dwellers warm. These o-chums were able to provide housing to a family of six. To make the bedding, the natives would often use <b>the</b> <b>skins</b> of <b>the</b> animals that they shared the land with. The {{mattress}} was made <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>skins</b> of bigger animals such as bears and deer.

5|$|Despite having dark plumage in a {{tropical}} climate, frigatebirds have found ways not to overheat—particularly {{as they are}} exposed to full sunlight when on the nest. They ruffle feathers to lift them away <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>skin</b> and improve air circulation, and can extend and upturn their wings to expose the hot undersurface to the air and lose heat by evaporation and convection. Frigatebirds also place their heads in the shade of their wings, and males frequently flutter their gular pouches.|$|E
5|$|The emperor penguin's dark plumage fades {{to brown}} from November until February (the Antarctic summer), before the yearly moult in January and February. Moulting is rapid in this species {{compared}} with other birds, taking only around 34days. Emperor penguin feathers emerge <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>skin</b> after they have grown {{to a third of}} their total length, and before old feathers are lost, to help reduce heat loss. New feathers then push out the old ones before finishing their growth.|$|E
5|$|Although {{adapted to}} {{terrestrial}} life, frogs resemble freshwater fish in {{their inability to}} conserve body water effectively. When they are on land, much water is lost by evaporation <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>skin.</b> The excretory system {{is similar to that}} of mammals and there are two kidneys that remove nitrogenous products from the blood. Frogs produce large quantities of dilute urine in order to flush out toxic products from the kidney tubules. The nitrogen is excreted as ammonia by tadpoles and aquatic frogs but mainly as urea, a less toxic product, by most terrestrial adults. A few species of tree frog with little access to water excrete the even less toxic uric acid. The urine passes along paired ureters to the urinary bladder from which it is vented periodically into the cloaca. All bodily wastes exit the body through the cloaca which terminates in a cloacal vent.|$|E

5|$|Phimosis is the {{inability}} to retract the foreskin over the glans penis. At birth, the foreskin cannot be retracted due to adhesions between the foreskin and glans, and this is considered normal (physiological phimosis). Over time the foreskin naturally separates from the glans, {{and a majority of}} boys are able to retract the foreskin by age three. Less than one percent are still having problems at age 18. If {{the inability}} to do so becomes problematic (pathological phimosis) circumcision is a treatment option. This pathological phimosis may be due to scarring <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>skin</b> disease balanitis xerotica obliterans (BXO), repeated episodes of balanoposthitis or forced retraction of the foreskin. Steroid creams are also a reasonable option and may prevent the need for surgery including in those with mild BXO. The procedure may also be used to prevent the development of phimosis. Phimosis is also a complication that can result from circumcision.|$|E
5|$|The mainstays of {{treatment}} are removal {{from the source}} of lead and, {{for people who have}} significantly high blood lead levels or who have symptoms of poisoning, chelation therapy. Treatment of iron, calcium, and zinc deficiencies, which are associated with increased lead absorption, is another part {{of treatment}} for lead poisoning. When lead-containing materials are present in the gastrointestinal tract (as evidenced by abdominal X-rays), whole bowel irrigation, cathartics, endoscopy, or even surgical removal may be used to eliminate it from the gut and prevent further exposure. Lead-containing bullets and shrapnel may also present a threat of further exposure and may need to be surgically removed if they are in or near fluid-filled or synovial spaces. If lead encephalopathy is present, anticonvulsants may be given to control seizures, and treatments to control swelling of the brain include corticosteroids and mannitol. Treatment of organic lead poisoning involves removing the lead compound <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>skin,</b> preventing further exposure, treating seizures, and possibly chelation therapy for people with high blood lead concentrations.|$|E
5|$|The willie wagtail perches on low branches, fences, posts, and the like, {{watching}} for insects {{and other small}} invertebrates in the air or on the ground. It usually hunts by hawking flying insects such as gnats, flies, and small moths, but will occasionally glean from the ground. It will often hop along the ground and flit behind people and animals, such as cattle, sheep or horses, as they walk over grassed areas, to catch any creatures disturbed by their passing. It wags its tail in a horizontal fashion while foraging in this manner; the exact purpose of this behaviour is unknown but is thought to help flush out insects hidden in vegetation and hence make them easier to catch. The willie wagtail takes ticks <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>skin</b> of grazing animals such as cattle or pigs, even from lions asleep in a zoo. It kills its prey by bashing it against a hard surface, or holding it and pulling off the wings before extracting the edible insides.|$|E

5|$|Unlike {{most other}} marine mammals, the sea otter has no blubber and relies on its {{exceptionally}} thick fur to keep warm. With up to 150,000 {{strands of hair}} per square centimeter (nearly one million per sqin), its fur is the densest of any animal. The fur consists of long, waterproof guard hairs and short underfur; the guard hairs keep the dense underfur layer dry. Cold water is kept completely away <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>skin</b> and heat loss is limited. The fur is thick year-round, as it is shed and replaced gradually {{rather than in a}} distinct molting season. As the ability of the guard hairs to repel water depends on utmost cleanliness, the sea otter has the ability to reach and groom the fur on any part of its body, taking advantage of its loose skin and an unusually supple skeleton. The coloration of the pelage is usually deep brown with silver-gray speckles, but it can range from yellowish or grayish brown to almost black. In adults, the head, throat, and chest are lighter in color {{than the rest of the}} body.|$|E
5|$|The patagium is {{the wing}} membrane. The patagium is {{stretched}} between {{the arm and}} hand bones, down the lateral {{side of the body}} and down to the hind limbs. This skin membrane consists of connective tissue, elastic fibers, nerves, muscles, and blood vessels. The muscles keep the membrane taut during flight. The skin on the body of the bat, which has one layer of epidermis and dermis, as well as the presence of hair follicles, sweat glands and a fatty subcutaneous layer, is very different <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>skin</b> of the wing membrane. The patagium is an extremely thin double layer of epidermis; these layers are separated by a connective tissue center, rich with collagen and elastic fibers. The membrane has no hair follicles or sweat glands, except between the fingers. Unlike birds whose stiff wings deliver bending and torsional stress to the shoulders, bats have a flexible wing membrane which can only resist tension. To achieve flight, a bat exerts force inwards at the points where the membrane meets the skeleton, so that an opposing force balances it on the wing edges perpendicular to the wing surface. However, this adaptation does not permit bats to reduce their wingspan as birds do, which means they cannot travel over long distances like birds can.|$|E

2500|$|To make pommes de terre gratinées, or [...] "potatoes with cheese", {{according}} to the recipe of Marcel Boulestin, large floury potatoes are baked in the oven, then halved and <b>the</b> flesh scooped <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>skins.</b> <b>The</b> flesh is then mashed together with butter, cream, grated cheese and seasoning(s). The mix is then scooped back into <b>the</b> <b>skins,</b> arranged in a baking dish, sprinkled with grated cheese and browned in the oven or under the grill. This preparation is also called twice-baked potatoes.|$|R
25|$|The {{more modern}} {{idea of a}} piece of a {{winemaking}} equipment used to extract <b>the</b> juice <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>skins</b> probably emerged during the Greco-Roman periods where written accounts by Cato the Elder, Marcus Terentius Varro, Pliny the Elder and others described wooden wine presses that utilized large beams, capstans and windlasses to exert pressure on the pomace. The wines produced by these presses were usually darker, with more color extracted <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>skins</b> but could also be more harsh with bitter tannins also extracted. That style of wine press would eventually evolve into the basket press used in the Middle Ages by wine estates of the nobility and Catholic Church leading to the modern tank batch and continuous presses used in wineries today.|$|R

25|$|The {{earliest}} {{evidence of}} deliberate winemaking is from excavation at sites like Areni-1 winery {{in what is}} now the Vayots Dzor Province of Armenia. This site, dating back to around 4000 BC included a trough that measured about 3 by 3 1/2 feet and included a drain that went into a 2 feet long vat that could contain about 14-15 gallons (52-57 liters) of wine. The carbon dating of these sites (and earlier sites at Çatalhöyük and Neolithic B sites in Jordan) are based on left over grape pips (seeds) and while they provide solid evidence of wine making, they don't necessarily provide evidence of how the wine was made and if the modern concept of pressing (i.e. extracting juice <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>skins</b> and separating it <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>skins</b> and seeds) was used.|$|R
40|$|The ESR {{spectra of}} <b>the</b> stalks and <b>skins</b> of a {{selection}} of unirradiated and γ-irradiated citrus fruits have been obtained. <b>The</b> spectra <b>from</b> <b>the</b> stalks and <b>skins</b> of unirradiated fruits exhibit only a single line, the intensity of which varies markedly from fruit to fruit. <b>The</b> spectra <b>from</b> irradiated stalks exhibit extra features {{which can be used}} to detect irradiation, particularly at higher doses. <b>The</b> spectra obtained <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>skins</b> of <b>the</b> irradiated fruits also exhibit radiation-induced features which can easily be used to detect irradiation even at the lowest dose examined (2 kGy). <b>The</b> spectra <b>from</b> <b>the</b> irradiated <b>skins</b> show a high degree of reproducibility from fruit to fruit.
