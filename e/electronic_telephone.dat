25|$|Liberalisation of Indian {{telecommunication}} {{in industry}} started in 1981 when Prime Minister Indira Gandhi signed contracts with Alcatel CIT of France {{to merge with}} the state owned Telecom Company (ITI), {{in an effort to}} set up 5,000,000 lines per year. But soon the policy was let down because of political opposition. Attempts to liberalise the telecommunication industry were continued by the following government under the prime-minister-ship of Rajiv Gandhi. He invited Sam Pitroda, a US-based Non-resident Indian NRI and a former Rockwell International executive to set up a Centre for Development of Telematics(C-DOT) which manufactured <b>electronic</b> <b>telephone</b> exchanges in India for the first time. Sam Pitroda had a significant role as a consultant and adviser in the development of telecommunication in India.|$|E

2500|$|Some of Raymond Scott's {{projects}} were less complex, but still ambitious. During the 1950s and 1960s, he developed and patented {{a large number}} of consumer products that brought electronically produced sounds into the homes and lives of Americans. Among these were <b>electronic</b> <b>telephone</b> ringers, alarms, chimes, and sirens, vending machines and ashtrays with accompanying electronic music scores, an electronic musical baby rattle and an adult toy that produced varying sounds dependent on how two people touched one another. It was Scott's belief that these devices would [...] "electronically update the many sounds around us - the functional sounds." ...|$|E

50|$|Early {{telephone}} exchanges signaled the switchboard operator when a subscriber {{picked up the}} telephone handset to make a call. The operator answered requesting the destination of the call. When manual exchanges were replaced with automated switching systems, the exchange generated a tone played to the caller when the telephone set was placed off-hook, indicating that the system was live and a telephone number could be dialed. Each digit was transmitted as it was dialed which caused the switching system to select the desired destination circuit. Modern <b>electronic</b> <b>telephones</b> may store the digits as they are entered, and only switch off-hook to complete the dialing when the subscriber presses a call or talk button.|$|R

A ceramic resonator is often used in place of quartz crystals as a reference clock or signal generator in electronic circuitry due to its low cost and smaller size.|$|R
5000|$|The {{principal}} {{advantage of}} carbon microphones over other microphone designs {{is that they}} can produce high-level audio signals from very low DC voltages, without needing any form of additional amplification or batteries. This is particularly useful in remote locations served by very long telephone lines, where the electrical resistance of the wires can lead to severe DC voltage drop. Most all-electronic telephones need at least three volts DC to work, and so will often become useless in such situations, whereas carbon transmitter telephones will continue to work down to a fraction of a volt. Even where they do work, <b>electronic</b> <b>telephones</b> also suffer from the so-called [...] "cliff effect", whereby they abruptly stop working when the line voltage falls below the critical level. In particular, this means that one telephone on a [...] "party line" [...] may tend to [...] "hog" [...] all the line current, cutting the others off. With carbon microphones, all receivers on the same line will still operate, albeit with reduced output.|$|R

5000|$|Before modern <b>electronic</b> <b>telephone</b> {{switching}} systems came into use, dial tones were usually generated by electromechanical means.

In the UK, the standard Post Office dialling tone was 33 Hz; it was {{generated by a}} motor-driven ringing machine in most exchanges, and by a vibrating-reed generator in the smaller ones.
