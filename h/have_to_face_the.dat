5|$|A {{few days}} later, {{in the wake}} of the scandal, Waugh was widely jeered by an Australian crowd when he walked out to bat on the first day of the Test. In what he {{described}} as the toughest day of his career, Waugh gave an unconvincing and hesitant performance. Waugh managed only seven runs in 36 minutes before being removed by Peter Such, caught and bowled. The cricket writer Peter Roebuck opined that it was the worst home crowd reception for an Australian player that he could remember. Warne was injured at the time and did not play, so he did not <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>face</b> <b>the</b> hostile crowd.|$|E

She was so shy as a junior she used to deliberately three-putt {{at the end of}} a tournament to avoid giving the victory speech. The coaches noticed and at the next tournament both the winner and the runner-up had to give a speech. Sörenstam decided that if she were going to <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>face</b> <b>the</b> crowd anyway she might as well win and the deliberate misses stopped.|$|E
5|$|On July 9, 1968, {{the team}} {{acquired}} Wilt Chamberlain from the Philadelphia 76ers for Darrell Imhoff, Archie Clark, and Jerry Chambers. In {{his first season}} as a Laker, Chamberlain set a team record by averaging a league-leading 21.1rpg. West, Baylor, and Chamberlain each averaged over 20 points, and Los Angeles won their division. The Lakers and Celtics again met in the finals, and Los Angeles had home court advantage against Boston {{for the first time}} in their rivalry. They won the first game behind Jerry West's 53 points, and had a 3–2 lead after five. Boston won the series in seven games however, and earned their 11th NBA Championship in 13 seasons. West was named the first-ever Finals MVP; this remains the only time that a member of the losing team has won the award. In 1970, West won his first scoring title at 31.2ppg, the team returned to the finals, and {{for the first time in}} 16 years, they did not <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>face</b> <b>the</b> Celtics; instead playing the New York Knicks, who defeated them 4–3. The next season the Lakers were defeated by the Milwaukee Bucks, led by future Laker Lew Alcindor (now known as Kareem Abdul-Jabbar) in the Western Conference Finals.|$|E

Also, researchers usually <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>face</b> <b>the</b> problem of deciding {{whether or not a}} real-world probability distribution follows a power law. As a solution to this problem, Diaz proposed a graphical methodology based on random samples that allow visually discerning between different types of tail behavior. This methodology uses bundles of residual quantile functions, also called percentile residual life functions, which characterize many different types of distribution tails, including both heavy and non-heavy tails.|$|E
25|$|The {{decision}} was made to confront the Indian naval ratings on board the destroyer Hindustan, armed with 4-in. guns. During the morning three guns (caliber unknown) from the Royal Artillery C. Troop arrived on the island. The Royal Artillery positioned the battery within point blank range of the Hindustan on the dockside. An ultimatum was delivered to the mutineers aboard Hindustan, stating that if they did not the leave the ship and put down their weapons by 10:30 they would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>face</b> <b>the</b> consequences.

25|$|While trolls {{believe that}} they do not face {{consequences}} and can troll others on the Internet without repercussions, in the 2000s, due to high-profile cases where cyberbullies have allegedly been factors in suicides attributed to bullying, more laws have been put in place by governments. Trolls can face going to prison for certain actions that they take on the Internet, such as spreading hate speech such as racist messages. One of the highest profile cases is racist trolling. Racist trolling has seen individuals been sent to prison for Tweets they have sent that to them may have seemed harmless and not racist. One case of this in recent years is Liam Stacey who was jailed for fifty-six days for tweeting offensive messages such as 'Muamba is dead, hahahaha', referring to when footballer Fabrice Muamba collapsed during a professional football game for Bolton Wanders (Williams, 2012). This highlights how offensive tweets and messages sent on any social networking platform does have repercussions for individuals {{and they have to be}} aware that they <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>face</b> <b>the</b> consequences of their actions.|$|E

He was elected to a full five-year term. Some two dozen of Taft's opinions as a state judge survive, the most significant being Moores & Co. v. Bricklayers' Union No. 1 (1889) if only because it was used against him when he ran for president in 1908. [...] The case involved bricklayers who refused to work for any firm that dealt with a company called Parker Brothers, with which they were in dispute. Taft ruled that the union's action amounted to a secondary boycott, which was illegal.|$|E

500|$|As {{the years}} went by and the king became {{increasingly}} prone to outbursts of anger, breaking with all his old relationships, it was said that only in Caroline and their sons' company did Leopold [...] "recapture some of his vitality and Germanic humour". Caroline was described as having been above average in height, [...] "plump but graceful, with a beautiful complexion and skin", with masses of chestnut hair; in character, she was [...] "haughty, sharp, irritable" [...] and ill-educated, and insisted on being treated with respect or else one would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>face</b> <b>the</b> king's displeasure. She was also said to be in possession of [...] "vivid conversational powers" [...] and [...] "dazzling youthfulness". Caroline was well-used to Leopold's [...] "quirks", such as his extreme hypochondria; for instance, when she needed free time for herself, she coughed and pretended to have a cold; she used this [...] "weapon" [...] to keep scheming female rivals from gaining favor with the king as well, telling Leopold that they had colds. Rather than ignore their age difference, Caroline and Leopold seemed to enjoy it, she calling him Tres Vieux and he calling her Tres Belle.|$|E
500|$|Hassett’s {{winning run}} looked {{at an end}} when Australia was exposed to a sticky wicket in the Third Test. The hosts had reached 2/240 {{at the end of}} the first day before rain hit and made the pitch {{extremely}} difficult for batting. The next day, Hassett had to waste time to keep South Africa batting on the poor surface so that Australia’s batsmen would not be exposed to the worst conditions. He then told his bowlers to perform badly so that the hosts would not realise how difficult the pitch was and declare so that Australia would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>face</b> <b>the</b> sticky wicket. Despite Hassett’s subterfuge, the pitch was so poor that South Africa fell to be 311 all out, but Australia had gained extra time. The tourists made only 75, but then dismissed the hosts for 99, Hassett using defensive tactics to slow the scoring and keep South Africa batting as the pitch slowly improved. Australia chased down the target of 336 with five wickets in hand to secure a highly unlikely win. The local newspaper, The Natal Mercury said that [...] "Renowned for their fighting qualities as a cricketers, the occasion brought the best out of the Australians ... That indomitable spirit to win through, no matter what the circumstances may be, was in most marked evidence." ...|$|E
500|$|By the 1957 season, Shirley Povich of The Washington Post {{expressed}} a clear preference for Pierce over Ford, writing that anyone doubting Pierce's {{place as the}} league's top left-hander was [...] "risking committal as an incurable psycho who can neither read the figures nor respond to reason." [...] Pierce's 4–3 win over the Yankees on July 28, 1959 put the White Sox in first place, where they stayed {{for the remainder of}} the season to take their first pennant in 40 years; it was his 160th victory with Chicago, breaking Doc White's team record for wins by a left-hander (he broke White's club records for career games and innings by a left-hander the same year). In late 1958, sportswriter Edgar Munzel wrote, [...] "The primary difference between Pierce and Ford, in their long-standing duel for southpaw supremacy in the American League, is that Pierce is pitching for a woefully weak hitting team, while Ford is backed by the league's most powerful offensive machine... An even greater boon to Whitey is the fact that he doesn't <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>face</b> <b>the</b> Yankees." [...] Of Pierce, who he described as the top White Sox pitcher for the past decade, he added, [...] "Normally, he's lucky if he's supported with as many as two runs when he faces the Yankees." ...|$|E

500|$|Because Mackintosh had {{intended}} to use Aurora as the party's main living quarters, most of the shore party's personal gear, food, equipment and fuel was still aboard when the ship departed. Although the sledging rations intended for Shackleton's depots had been landed, the ten stranded men were left with [...] "only the clothes on their backs". [...] Mackintosh [...] summarised their situation: [...] "We <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>face</b> <b>the</b> possibility {{that we may have}} to stay here, unsupported, for two years. [...] We cannot expect rescue before then, and so we must conserve and economize on what we have, and we must seek and apply what substitutes we can gather". Their first recourse was to the food and materials from supplies left behind by Scott's and Shackleton's earlier expeditions. [...] These supplies provided a harvest of material, which enabled clothing, footwear and equipment to be improvised, while the party used seal meat and blubber as extra sources of food and fuel. [...] "Joyce's Famous Tailoring Shop" [...] fashioned clothes from a large canvas tent abandoned by Scott's expedition. Even a brand of tobacco—"Hut Point Mixture"—was concocted by Ernest Wild from sawdust, tea, coffee and a few dried herbs. [...] By these means the party equipped itself for the sledging journeys that lay ahead in the second season. On the last day of August Mackintosh recorded in his diary the work that had been completed during the winter, and ended: [...] "Tomorrow we start for Hut Point".|$|E
500|$|During the mid-afternoon of Saturday 14 January 1933, {{the second}} day of the Third Test, Woodfull and Fingleton opened the batting for Australia in the face of an England total of 341 before a record {{attendance}} of 50,962 people. Fingleton was caught by the wicketkeeper without scoring. The third over of the innings was bowled by Larwood with fielders still in orthodox positions. The fifth ball narrowly missed Woodfull's head and the final ball, delivered short on the line of middle stump, struck Woodfull over the heart. The batsman dropped his bat and staggered away holding his chest, bent over in pain. The England players surrounded Woodfull to offer sympathy but the crowd began to protest noisily. Jardine called to Larwood: [...] "Well bowled, Harold!" [...] Although the comment was aimed at unnerving Bradman, who was also batting at the time, Woodfull was appalled. Play resumed after a brief delay, once it was certain the Australian captain was fit to carry on, and since Larwood's over had ended, Woodfull did not <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>face</b> <b>the</b> bowling of Allen in the next over. However, when Larwood was ready to bowl at Woodfull again, play was halted once more when the fielders were moved into Bodyline positions, causing the crowd to protest and call abuse at the England team. Subsequently, Jardine claimed that Larwood requested a field change, Larwood said that Jardine had done so. Many commentators condemned the alteration of the field as unsporting, and the angry spectators became extremely volatile. Jardine, although writing that Woodfull could have retired hurt if he was unfit, later expressed his regret at making the field change at that moment. It is likely Jardine wished to press home his team's advantage in the match, and the Bodyline field was usually employed at this stage of an innings.|$|E

The fifth ball narrowly missed Woodfull's head and the final ball, delivered short on the line of middle stump, struck Woodfull over the heart.
