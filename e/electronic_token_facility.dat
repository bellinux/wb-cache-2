M-commerce deals with such <b>electronic</b> <b>tokens</b> by using similar functionalities applicable by three principle stakeholders: the individual operating with a mobile device, the service provider that issues an <b>electronic</b> <b>token</b> to the individual, and the venue accepting an <b>electronic</b> <b>token</b> and subsequently delivering the goods or services to the individual. Through an analysis of business processes the purpose of each function can be described together with an assessment of potential failures combined with appropriate mitigation strategies. The paper demonstrates within three typical m-commerce scenarios how <b>electronic</b> <b>tokens</b> are shifted and used within the business processes, which failures may occur and how they could be handled.

50|$|Signal {{boxes were}} located at (west to east); Gilling, Helmsley, Kirbymoorside and Goslip Bridge (Pickering). Signalling {{on the line}} {{was a mixture of}} <b>electronic</b> <b>token,</b> staff and ticket and the one engine in steam principle. Gradually, all of the line was {{converted}} to <b>electronic</b> <b>token</b> particularly after one incident at Kirbymoorside when a train arrived from Helmsley going east with a staff for the Helmsley to Gilling section. Electric token working was introduced across the line in stages between 1924 and 1933.|$|R

50|$|Radio <b>Electronic</b> <b>Token</b> Block is {{a system}} of railway {{signalling}} used in the United Kingdom. It is a development of the physical token system for controlling traffic on single lines.|$|R
50|$|On 6 December 1987 the Radio <b>Electronic</b> <b>Token</b> Block (RETB) {{system was}} {{commissioned}} between Mallaig Junction (now called 'Fort William Junction') and Mallaig. The RETB is controlled from a Signalling Centre at Banavie railway station.|$|R
50|$|In August 1985, {{the method}} of working between Crianlarich and Rannoch reverted to the {{electric}} token block system. The semaphore signals were removed on 22 December 1985 {{in preparation for the}} introduction of Radio <b>Electronic</b> <b>Token</b> Block (RETB).|$|R
50|$|The {{signalling}} centre for {{the line}} {{is located in the}} signal cabin on the Lowestoft-bound platform at Saxmundham. This formerly served as the control centre while the line was signalled using the Radio <b>Electronic</b> <b>Token</b> Block (RETB) system.|$|R
50|$|For {{systems that}} rely on <b>electronic</b> <b>tokens,</b> algorithm-based OTP {{generators}} must cope with the situation where a token drifts out-of-sync with its server if the system requires the OTP to be entered by a deadline. This leads to an additional development cost. Time-synchronized systems, on the other hand, avoid this {{at the expense of}} having to maintain a clock in the <b>electronic</b> <b>tokens</b> (and an offset value to account for clock drift). Whether or not OTPs are time-synchronized is basically irrelevant for the degree of vulnerability, but it avoids a need to re-enter passwords if the server is expecting the last or next code that the token should be having because the server and token have drifted out-of-sync.|$|R
50|$|With the {{exception}} of the route between Glasgow Queen Street and Helensburgh Upper, and the short section between Fort William Junction and Fort William station, the railway is signalled using the Radio <b>Electronic</b> <b>Token</b> Block, controlled from the signal box at Banavie station.|$|R
25|$|Elements of the {{operation}} were used by British Rail to cut costs on remote lines. What became known as Radio <b>Electronic</b> <b>Token</b> Block signalling shared features with the Ratty, such as centralised control, automatic points at loops, and on-train equipment rather than fixed equipment at remote locations.|$|R
5000|$|The {{semaphore}} signals were removed on 19 January 1986 {{in preparation for}} the introduction of Radio <b>Electronic</b> <b>Token</b> Block (RETB) by British Rail.

5000|$|The {{first of}} the Kyle line's three passing loops is located here and trains are {{occasionally}} timetabled to cross, though the loop points work automatically and all movements are controlled using the Radio <b>Electronic</b> <b>Token</b> Block system which was installed by British Rail and is supervised from the signalling centre at [...]|$|R
50|$|Glenfinnan {{lost its}} {{semaphore}} signals on 13 April 1986, {{in preparation for}} Radio <b>Electronic</b> <b>Token</b> Block (RETB) signalling. RETB was commissioned between Mallaig Junction (now 'Fort William Junction') and Mallaig on 6 December 1987. This resulted in the closure of Glenfinnan signal box (amongst others). The RETB is controlled from a Signalling Centre at Banavie railway station.|$|R
50|$|After {{having been}} {{previously}} lifted, the loop at Gorton was reinstated in 1988 as an Engineer's siding, not a crossing loop. The platform {{has been removed}} however controlling ground frames and containers as basic facilities for Network Rail or contractor use are located on site as required. It is a Radio <b>Electronic</b> <b>Token</b> Block exchange point.|$|R
50|$|The station {{closed in}} 1960 though {{the line is}} still in use as a single track {{controlled}} by Radio <b>Electronic</b> <b>Token</b> Block {{as part of the}} Far North Line. However, for one weekend in March 1982, Lentran had to reopen and serve as the line terminus while repair work was carried out on the canal bridge at Clachnaharry.|$|R
50|$|The {{line was}} resignalled in 1984 using the Radio <b>Electronic</b> <b>Token</b> Block {{resulting}} in the closure of all signal boxes except the RETB controlling signalbox at Saxmumdham. Also, to ensure the line's survival, parts of the remaining line were reduced to single track to minimise maintenance costs. The station at Melton was reopened on 3 September 1984.|$|R
5000|$|In 1967, {{the method}} of working between [...] and Rannoch was changed to the Scottish Region Tokenless Block system.In August 1985, {{the method of}} working between Crianlarich and Rannoch reverted to the {{electric}} token block system.

5000|$|On 27 March 1988, Helensburgh Upper {{became the}} {{southern}} extremity of the Radio <b>Electronic</b> <b>Token</b> Block (RETB) signalling on the West Highland Line. A two-aspect colour light signal {{installed at the}} east end of the platform controls entry into the [...] signal box (since superseded by Yoker IECC) Track Circuit Block signalling area. The RETB system was installed by British Rail.|$|R
5000|$|On Britain's {{national}} network {{the use of}} Tyer's system is now almost extinct, with most lengthy single track lines having been converted to more modern systems such as Tokenless Block or Radio <b>Electronic</b> <b>Token</b> Block. However, as of 2015 the Tyer Electric Token Block (using No 7 instruments and coloured perspex tablets) remains in use on the Stranraer Line, between [...] and Dunragit.|$|R
50|$|Dalmally {{lost all}} its {{semaphore}} signals on 9 February 1986, {{in preparation for}} Radio <b>Electronic</b> <b>Token</b> Block (RETB) signalling. RETB was commissioned on 27 March 1988, resulting in the closure of Dalmally signal box, amongst others. Dalmally is an RETB token exchange point, but with 'long section tokens' being available between Tyndrum Lower and Taynuilt, {{it is not necessary}} for every train to exchange tokens there.|$|R
50|$|In the U.S., semaphores were {{employed}} as train order signals, {{with the purpose}} of indicating to engineers whether they should stop to receive a telegraphed order, and also as simply one form of block signalling. Mechanical signals worldwide are being phased out in favour of colour-light signals or, in some cases, signalling systems that do not require lineside signals (e.g. Radio <b>Electronic</b> <b>Token</b> Block or RETB).|$|R
50|$|Anonymous Internet banking is the {{proposed}} use of strong financial cryptography to make electronic bank secrecy (or more precisely pseudonymous banking) possible. The bank issues currency {{in the form}} of <b>electronic</b> <b>tokens</b> that can be converted on presentation to the bank to some other currency. This concept has a long history in which free banking institutions have issued their own paper currency often backed by a physical commodity.|$|R
50|$|As of Spring 2016, {{the only}} areas of UK Network Rail still {{currently}} employing VHF train radio communications are on {{sections of the}} Highland and Far North Lines in Scotland, where the RETB (Radio <b>Electronic</b> <b>Token</b> Block) system is utilised, using modified Ofcom frequencies around 180 MHz, having been de-scoped from the National GSM-R plan, due to practical difficulties involved in deploying the GSM-R system in this region.|$|R
50|$|Taynuilt {{lost all}} its {{semaphore}} signals on 16 February 1986, {{in preparation for}} Radio <b>Electronic</b> <b>Token</b> Block (RETB) signalling. RETB was commissioned between Crianlarich and Taynuilt on 27 March 1988. Taynuilt signal box did not close until 24 April of that year, when the RETB spread west to Oban. The redundant signal box was later relocated to {{the opposite end of}} the station, where it is currently in a semi-derelict state.|$|R
50|$|In 1987 radio <b>electronic</b> <b>token</b> block (RETB) was {{installed}} {{on part of}} the West Highland Railway system, later extended throughout except for the Fort William station area. RETB enabled safe operation of the long single line sections without signalling staff at stations; the control centre was at Banavie. The points at passing loops at stations were spring operated, and were negotiated at slow speed in the facing direction.|$|R
5000|$|Spean Bridge {{lost all}} its {{semaphore}} signals on 2 March 1986, {{in preparation for}} Radio <b>Electronic</b> <b>Token</b> Block (RETB) signalling. The RETB system was commissioned by British Rail between [...] and Fort William Junction on 29 May 1988. This resulted in the closure of Spean Bridge signal box and others on {{that part of the}} line. The RETB is controlled from a Signalling Centre at Banavie railway station.|$|R
40|$|In recent years, both wired and {{wireless}} communications have been developed. Various types of wireless communication devices {{have been introduced}} in the market such as Zigbee, Bluetooth, infrared and EnOcean. From short distance wireless communication devices to long distance communication devices are being widely used in electronic field today. In wired communication devices, the usage of Universal Serial Bus (USB) has overcome the usage of serial ports. This project {{is concerned with the}} implementation of frequency modulation (FM) wireless communication in <b>electronic</b> <b>token.</b> Radio frequency (RF) technology particularly is being used for its minimum circuit complexity and low cost. It takes designing and building the <b>electronic</b> <b>token</b> and interface with the personal computer (PC) through USB. USB is used because there is lesser usage of serial ports nowadays especially in lap tops. Most of the electronic devices use USB because its application is universal. A graphical user interface (GUI) is developed for control and display purposes. This project has proved a success in building an effective token system using low cost wireless communication device...|$|R
