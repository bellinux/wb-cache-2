In 2010 the Commission was sued for blocking access to documents on EU biofuel policy. This happened after media accused the Commission of blocking scientific evidence against biofuel subsidies. Lack of transparency, unclear lobbyist relations, conflicts of interests and excessive spending of the Commission was highlighted {{in a number of}} reports by internal and independent auditing organisations. It has also been criticised on IT-related issues, particularly with regard to Microsoft.|$|E
5|$|The <b>European</b> <b>Ombudsman</b> {{is elected}} by the Parliament, who deals with public {{complaints}} against all institutions. Petitions can also be brought forward by any EU citizen on a matter within the EU's sphere of activities.

While the Parliament attempts {{to resolve the issue}} as a mediator they do resort to legal proceedings if it is necessary to resolve the citizens dispute.|$|E

40|$|This article {{argues that}} Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) {{negotiations}} {{have a positive}} legal story worth recounting as {{to the effects of}} the negotiations upon the European Union (EU) legal order. The article explores the negotiation of EU international agreements as a specific field of law and considers how the TTIP negotiations overall contribute to the politicization of the EU through shifts in legal practice on the part of all major institutional actors to EU international relations in changes to approach, procedure and actions. It uses the metric of responsiveness to measure or chart the former, considering the responses as actually practiced by institutional actors in law to normative concerns arising. It considers these practices across a range of actors, specifically the European Commission, the <b>European</b> Parliament, the <b>Ombudsman,</b> the Committee of the Regions and the TTIP Advisory Group...|$|R
40|$|The {{first part}} [of the present paper] seeks {{to put the}} {{openness}} debate in context, by examining the different facets of openness and transparency, the important roles of <b>European</b> Parliament, the <b>Ombudsman,</b> the <b>European</b> Court of Justice and citizens groups in helping to promote greater openness, {{as well as the}} differing approaches to openness and transparency within Member States. The second part of the paper outlines the progressive extension of openness and transparency within EU in recent years, including the development of a formal Treaty base and the evolving situation within the various EU institutions and bodies, notably the establishment of new codes of conduct on public access to their documents. The final section of the paper reviews the present state of openness and transparency within EU, and the areas where insufficient progress has been made. In particular, it reviews the recent debate on the implementing rules on public access to the documents of the Parliament, Commission and Council, and the various issues that have arisen {{in the course of this}} debate...|$|R

40|$|This {{contribution}} {{discusses the}} TTIP negotiations and their {{consequences for the}} EU. The degree of attention - academic, political and from the public - has been extraordinary for an agreement which is still in process of negotiation, and that in itself tells us something. The TTIP, and the TTIP negotiations, are indeed significant. In fact, the negotiations themselves have had important consequences, irrespective of whether TTIP is ever finally concluded. If it is concluded, TTIP will be a highly significant agreement for the EU {{and the future of}} its trade policy and perhaps also for the future of multilateral trade (the WTO). If the TTIP fails, that failure and the reasons for it – whether a failure to reach a sufficiently substantive agreement, or a failure to ratify by the European Parliament, or by one or more Member States, or by the US Congress, will also have important consequences for the future of bilateral trade agreements. The TTIP negotiations both demonstrate and are themselves contributing to the changing landscape of EU trade policy. I should like to mention four aspects of this: first putting TTIP into the context of the EU’s trade policy more broadly; second assessing the projected scope of TTIP in terms of its degree of innovation and its sensitivities; third assessing the TTIP in terms of the balance of competence between the EU and its Member States; and fourth looking at innovations in the negotiation process and the roles played by the <b>European</b> Parliament, the <b>Ombudsman</b> and civil society...|$|R
40|$|Defence date: 5 December 2016 Examining Board: Professor Marise Cremona (supervisor), EUI; Professor Miguel Maduro, EUI; Professor Francesco Maiani, University of Lausanne; Doctor Günter Wilms, Legal service, European Commission and Legal Advisor, EUIThe Commission’s {{policy of}} {{selective}} enforcement rests on four pillars: confidentiality, bilateralism, flexibility, and autonomy. For years, the <b>European</b> Parliament, the <b>Ombudsman</b> and stakeholders have {{put pressure on}} the Commission to reform its enforcement policy in order to increase its legitimacy in the eyes of EU citizens by, inter alia, allowing complainants access to documentation from its investigations and securing their rights by means of legally-binding measures. They have sought to replace the Commission’s existing discretionary model of enforcement with a new approach characterized by such standards as transparency, trilateralism, objectivity, and accountability. The Commission, however, supported by the Court of Justice, has in most part resisted these challenges, changing its policy of selective enforcement only {{to such a degree that}} does not substantially interfere with its four pillars. This thesis seeks to explain the reasons for the Commission’s commitment to the existing discretionary model of enforcement. By means of the Comparative Institutional Analysis, it is argued that the proposed reforms would distort the balance between the Commission’s demand and supply sides. The Commission’s capacity to enforce EU law is limited, and burdening it with new responsibilities in order to introduce transparency or objectivity to its operation would lead to the formalization of enforcement measures, increasing its administrative burden and decreasing its efficiency. It would skew its attention towards complainant-relevant violations and transform its enforcement into a vehicle for individual grievances running counter to the Commission’s understanding of its enforcement function as guardian of the Treaties. The Commission’s opposition to the accountability approach does not, however, mean a rejection of its demands. The EU Pilot is an example of the Commission’s effort to address some of these expectations while maintaining the balance between the forces of supply and demand. Selective enforcement thus may not be as much about prioritizing cases as it is about assigning appropriate enforcement measures...|$|R
