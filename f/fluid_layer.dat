25|$|In fluid dynamics, Airy wave theory (often {{referred}} to as linear wave theory) gives a linearised description of the propagation of gravity waves {{on the surface of}} a homogeneous <b>fluid</b> <b>layer.</b> The theory assumes that the <b>fluid</b> <b>layer</b> has a uniform mean depth, and that the fluid flow is inviscid, incompressible and irrotational.

40|$|The work {{performed}} for the feasibility {{study of a}} microgravity surface tension driven convection experiment was reviewed. An experimental investigation of the onset of convection in shallow <b>fluid</b> <b>layers</b> heated uniformly from below and cooled from above by an air layer was made. Results are discussed {{in relation to the}} formation of Benard cells. The onset of Rayleigh-Benard convection in thin <b>fluid</b> <b>layers</b> heated uniformly from below were studied experimentally. It was found that in thin <b>fluid</b> <b>layers</b> the onset of Rayleigh-Benard convection is preceded by subcritical convective motions. Secondly, {{it was found that the}} onset of Rayleigh-Benard convection in non-Boussinesq <b>fluid</b> <b>layers</b> takes place in the form of hexagonal cells at Rayleigh numbers larger than the critical Rayleigh number R sub C = 1708 which determines the onset of convection in Boussinesq <b>fluid</b> <b>layers...</b>|$|R

25|$|The {{last four}} {{equations}} describe {{the evolution of}} slowly varying wave trains over bathymetry in interaction with the mean flow, and {{can be derived from}} a variational principle: Whitham's averaged Lagrangian method. In the mean horizontal-momentum equation, d(x) is the still water depth, i.e. the bed underneath the <b>fluid</b> <b>layer</b> is located at z=–d. Note that the mean-flow velocity in the mass and momentum equations is the mass transport velocity , including the splash-zone effects of the waves on horizontal mass transport, and not the mean Eulerian velocity (e.g. as measured with a fixed flow meter).|$|E
25|$|Underneath the surface, {{there is}} a fluid motion {{associated}} with the free surface motion. While the surface elevation shows a propagating wave, the fluid particles are in an orbital motion. Within the framework of Airy wave theory, the orbits are closed curves: circles in deep water, and ellipses in finite depth—with the ellipses becoming flatter {{near the bottom of}} the <b>fluid</b> <b>layer.</b> So while the wave propagates, the fluid particles just orbit (oscillate) around their average position. With the propagating wave motion, the fluid particles transfer energy in the wave propagation direction, without having a mean velocity. The diameter of the orbits reduces with depth below the free surface. In deep water, the orbit's diameter is reduced to 4% of its free-surface value at a depth of half a wavelength.|$|E
25|$|The lipid {{nature of}} the cell {{membrane}} was first correctly intuited by Quincke, who noted that a cell generally forms a spherical shape in water and, when broken in half, forms two smaller spheres. The only other known material to exhibit this behavior was oil. He also noted that a thin film of oil behaves as a semipermeable membrane, precisely as predicted. Based on these observations, Quincke asserted that the cell membrane comprised a <b>fluid</b> <b>layer</b> of fat less than 100nm thick. This theory was further extended by evidence {{from the study of}} anesthetics. Hans Meyer and Ernest Overton independently noticed that the chemicals which act as general anesthetics are also those soluble in both water and oil. They interpreted this as meaning that to pass the cell membrane a molecule must be at least sparingly soluble in oil, their “lipoid theory of narcosis.” Based on this evidence and further experiments, they concluded that the cell membrane might be made of lecithin (phosphatidylcholine) and cholesterol. Interestingly, one of the early criticisms of this theory was that it included no mechanism for energy-dependent selective transport. This “flaw” would remain unanswered for nearly half a century until the discovery that specialized molecules called integral membrane proteins can act as ion transportation pumps.|$|E

40|$|Influence of shaking on peritoneal {{transfer}} in rats. To determine {{the role played}} by stagnant peritoneal <b>fluid</b> <b>layers</b> in the diffusion of solutes between peritoneal cavity and blood, we measured peritoneal transfer of urea, creatinine, [14 C]-L-glucose and protein in anesthetized rats shaken at varying rates on an orbital platform shaker. The diffusion transfer rates of the low molecular weight solutes increased dramatically with shaking, with near maximal values obtained at a shaking rate of 250 RPM. The permeability · area product (PA) for each of the low molecular weight solutes increased about fourfold with rapid shaking while the PA of protein increased by only about 50 %. It seems likely that shaking increased PA primarily via reduction of the thickness of stagnant peritoneal <b>fluid</b> <b>layers,</b> although increases in surface area or changes in tissue permeability cannot be excluded with certainty. We conclude that stagnant <b>fluid</b> <b>layers</b> probably are the rate limiting step in diffusive peritoneal transfer of low molecular weight solutes in stationary rats...|$|R
