2500|$|Melchior Wańkowicz, {{a popular}} Polish journalist, met Beck {{in the autumn}} of 1939 during his {{internment}} in Romania. This is how he described the meeting: [...] "Beck was locked in a golden cage of a luxurious hotel in Brașov, where he and his entourage occupied one floor. He was closely guarded: whenever he went out, hordes of Allied, German and Romanian agents followed him (...) I met him at 5 in the afternoon, and our conversation continued until almost two in the morning, with a dinner break. Beck emphasized achievements of the last month of his post: a military treaty with England, Hungarian refusal to let German troops pass through their territory, droit de residence and droit de passage, granted by Romanian government. Beck believes in a solid coalition, and that we would sit at a negotiating table as partners, while Czechs would remain outside. He does not care about the fact that Lloyd George stated that Poland did not deserve help as a reactionary country. He is not bothered by the fact that Lord Halifax wants to recreate the Curzon Line. Instead, he points out that when British king gave a speech on the radio, only English, French and Polish anthems were played (...) Since I cannot tolerate this kind of wishful thinking, <b>I</b> <b>ask</b> <b>him</b> whether he had ever seriously considered German attack. He keeps saying that he had met Hitler several times, that Hitler backs out of discussions, that he can easily be talked into different things, that he was influenced by von Ribbentrop." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "But <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> <b>him,</b> mamma. Did you {{not hear}} me? I {{could not say}} the word plainer,--but <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> <b>him</b> whether he meant that sin.

60|$|During {{the long}} time that Friday had now been with me, and {{that he began to}} speak to me, and {{understand}} me, I was not wanting to lay a foundation of religious knowledge in his mind: particularly <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> <b>him</b> one time, Who made him?

He told me, it was one old Benamuckee, that lived beyond all; he could describe nothing of this great person, but that he was very old, much older, he said, than the sea or the land, than the moon or the stars. <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> <b>him</b> then, if this old person had made all things, why did not all things worship him? He looked very grave, and with a perfect look of innocence said, All things say O to <b>him.</b> <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> <b>him</b> if the people who die in his country went away any where?
