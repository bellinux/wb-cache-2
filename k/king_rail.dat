5000|$|The {{forests are}} a part of the {{temperate}} deciduous forest that extends from Florida north to eastern Canada. [...] The mixed plains ecozone has the highest plant diversity in Canada, with the Lake Erie lowland having trees species that occur nowhere else in Canada. Within Canada, these forest types are often referred to as the 'Carolinian zone' owing to the many southern plants and animals that reach their northern limits here. Clearing for agriculture and urbanization have reduced natural forest cover to less than ten percent. An overview of the flora and fauna of this distinctive region is available in The Natural Treasures of Carolinian Canada. A few of the many examples of southern species found here include the hooded warbler, <b>king</b> <b>rail,</b> prothonotary warbler, blue-gray gnatcatcher, American badger, opossum, and eastern spiny softshell turtle. Past work has identified 38 critical natural areas, and an initiative known as The Big Picture aims to restore natural corridors as part of a natural heritage system.

40|$|TThe <b>King</b> <b>Rail</b> (Rallus elegans) {{continues}} to experience population declines throughout its range. Due to its secretive nature and occupancy of densely vegetated marshes, {{little is known}} about the behavior and ecology of the <b>King</b> <b>Rail.</b> Moreover, conservation efforts lack essential information about <b>King</b> <b>Rail</b> habitat use to make informed decisions, especially along the Atlantic coast and during the non-breeding period. To address this, radio-telemetry was used to elucidate the spatiotemporal patterns of movement and habitat preferences of King Rails throughout the year. The microhabitat characteristics were quantified at nest locations and where adults were located during the breeding and non-breeding periods, including the poorly understood brood-rearing period. Nest densities were greatest in areas with high interspersion of emergent vegetation and open water, and most rails selected nest sites in Juncus roemerianus patches, the predominant species of emergent vegetation. Adults traveled with their broods substantial distances from nest locations, as much as 1 kilometer within the first week post-hatching, to areas with less Juncus roemerianus and with shallower water than where they nested. During the non-breeding and brood-rearing periods, adults were found closer to edges of open water and emergent vegetation than during the nesting period, areas thought to provide increased foraging opportunities. Empirically, it was determined for the first time that adults use wooded and shrubby marsh during the brood-rearing and non-breeding periods. This habitat type has not been considered under current <b>King</b> <b>Rail</b> management plans. Observations spanning the entire year documented the movements of King Rails and revealed that at least part of the population is resident. Mean home range size was 19. 8 ± 2. 5 ha (95 % kernel density). Individual home range sizes did not differ significantly between seasons. There was evidence of sexual segregation in habitat use during the non-breeding period. Females had significantly larger home ranges than males and tended to travel greater distances. During the non-breeding season, all birds captured in emergent marsh were male, and radio-tagged females were found using adjacent wooded marsh. Adults used both managed impoundments and emergent natural marsh at all times of the year, but increased their use of impoundments immediately following drawdown, and while brood-rearing, especially when water levels rose abruptly in natural marsh. In coastal habitats prone to variation in water level, provision of impoundments with sluice control adjacent to natural marsh appears to be of benefit to brood-rearing King Rails. Where populations are present year-round, habitat management should emphasize interspersion of patches of emergent vegetation with pockets of open water providing a mosaic of cover and appropriate nest sites in proximity to foraging areas. Scrub-shrub and wooded wetland habitat at the perimeter of emergent marsh may favor residency of overwintering King Rails of both sexes. These findings highlight the need for conservation efforts to consider the habitat preferences and spatial distribution of King Rails throughout the year and at all life stages. M. S...|$|E

40|$|This study {{examines}} {{the status and}} distribution of rail populations in northern Indiana. Because rails are secretive and difficult to study, {{there have been few}} attempts in Indiana to determine the impact of wetland loss on the populations of rails and other marsh-nesting birds. There can be little doubt, however, that the loss of Indiana wetlands during historic times has caused a dramatic decline in rail populations. Using tape-recorded calls to elicit vocalizations, the status and distribution of five species of rails were studied in a 25, 900 km 2 area in northern Indiana in 1993 and 1994. A total of 107 surveys were conducted at 46 natural wetlands and 42 restored wetlands. The species surveyed were Sora (Porzana carolina), Virginia Rail (Rallus limicola), <b>King</b> <b>Rail</b> (Rallus elegans), Yellow Rail (Coturnicops noveboracensis), and Black Rail (Laterallus jamaicensis). Playbacks were also used to detect American Bittern (Botaurus lentiginosus), Least Bittern (Ixobrychus exilis), Marsh Wren (Cistothorus palustris) and Sedge Wren (Cistothorus platensis). Data were also collected on all other species of marsh-nesting birds detected during this study. Rails exhibited a patchy distribution. A total of 25 Soras, 33 Virginia Rails, and 1 <b>King</b> <b>Rail</b> was detected in natural wetlands in 1993. In 1994, 75 Soras, 46 Virginia Rails, and 1 <b>King</b> <b>Rail</b> was detected in the natural wetlands. A total of 30 Soras and 9 Virginia Rails was found in the restored wetlands studied in 1993 and 1994. No Yellow or Black Rails were found. Ten Least Bitterns, 31 Marsh Wrens, and 6 Sedge Wrens were detected in natural wetlands, but these species were not observed in restored wetlands. The occurrence of rails in natural wetlands was positively correlated with wetland size, presence of shrub vegetation in the watershed, amount of emergent vegetation, proximity of other wetlands, and extent of cattail cover. Negative correlations were found for human disturbance, amount of open water, and watershed characteristics. The strongest negative correlationswere found for human disturbances in or around the wetland. In restored wetlands, a significant difference was found between the occurrence of Sora and Virginia Rails with Soras occurring more frequently than Virginia Rails. A near significant difference in rail occurrence between natural and restored wetlands was also found, with rails occurring more frequently in natural wetlands, suggesting that natural wetlands surveyed may be a more suitable habitat for rails than the restored wetlands surveyed. Restored wetlands surveyed in this study failed to attract American Bitterns, Least Bitterns, Marsh Wrens or Sedge Wrens. American Bitterns were reported in natural wetlands during this study, but they were not observed. Department of BiologyThesis (Ed. S. ...|$|E

40|$|<b>King</b> <b>rail</b> (Rallus elegans) {{populations are}} {{experiencing}} long-term declines attributable to habitat loss. Sparse breeding populations in coastal areas {{may represent the}} last strongholds for this species, but climate change models predict these are at risk from extreme weather events, including rising temperatures and higher frequencies and intensities of storms, with associated risks of storm surge and flooding. A breeding population at Mackay Island National Wildlife Refuge (NWR) in coastal North Carolina likely represents an important source population for the region. I investigated the effects of elevated temperatures and rising water on the nesting success of king rails at Mackay Island NWR, and whether they have evolved behavioral plasticity in nesting behavior to mitigate these threats. I further tested the alternative hypothesis that variation among parents in nesting effort {{may be related to}} individual differences in body condition. Clutch temperatures that exceed acceptable limits for embryo development may result in embryo mortality. I monitored clutch and ambient temperatures simultaneously using Thermochron iButtons, and I documented parental incubation behavior at <b>king</b> <b>rail</b> nests. Video recordings reveal parents adjust their incubation behavior in response to ambient temperatures, and shading their nest may allow king rails to maintain their clutches below lethal temperatures in hot conditions. However, king rails tend to take more frequent recesses of nest attendance at higher temperatures, exposing their eggs to adverse conditions for embryo development. Clutches that reached higher temperatures {{for longer periods of time}} tended to hatch fewer chicks. Additionally, seasonal variation in temperature exposed late season nests to hotter conditions. Parents begin incubating earlier and hatching became more asynchronous later in the breeding season. Although parents show plasticity in incubation behavior, hatching failure related to high clutch temperatures suggests king rails may be constrained in their ability to cope with high temperatures experienced on the nest. Coastal marsh breeders must also contend with water level variation, and other rails (Family: Rallidae) add material to their nests throughout incubation to prevent nest flooding. Water levels at Mackay Island NWR are influenced by wind-driven tides and, consequently, are exceptionally variable. King rails build taller nests in areas with greater ranges in water levels. Parents spent proportionately more time building when the water level approached the top of the nest. However, individual nest height remained relatively constant and did not increase considerably during the laying period, suggesting that the majority of nest building occurred before laying began. Nest building during the laying and incubation periods may therefore function mainly to counteract settling and improve the structural integrity of the nest. Although they continue to build throughout the nesting cycle, parents may not be able to prevent nest flooding when faced with rapidly rising water...|$|E
