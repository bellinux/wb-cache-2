50|$|Any Ethernet device can be {{connected}} within the <b>EtherCAT</b> segment via switch ports. The Ethernet frames are tunneled via the <b>EtherCAT</b> protocol, as is normal for internet protocols (e.g., TCP/IP, VPN, PPPoE (DSL), etc.). The <b>EtherCAT</b> network is fully transparent for the Ethernet devices, and the real-time features of <b>EtherCAT</b> are not disturbed.|$|E
50|$|The <b>EtherCAT</b> Technology Group is an {{official}} liaison {{partner of the}} IEC (International Electrotechnical Commission) working groups for digital communication. The <b>EtherCAT</b> specification was published as IEC/PAS 62407 in 2005, which was removed end of 2007 since <b>EtherCAT</b> had been integrated into the international fieldbus standards IEC 61158 and IEC 61784-2 as well as into the drive profile standard IEC 61800-7. These IEC standards have been approved unanimously in September and October 2007 and were published as IS (International Standards) later that year. In IEC 61800-7, <b>EtherCAT</b> is a standardized communication technology for the SERCOS and CANopen drive profiles. <b>EtherCAT</b> {{is also part of}} ISO 15745-4, the standard for XML device description. Furthermore, SEMI has added <b>EtherCAT</b> to its standards portfolio (E54.20) and approved the technology for usage in semiconductor and flat panel display manufacturing equipment. In April 2010, Edition 2 of IEC 61784-3 was accepted, which contains the Safety over <b>EtherCAT</b> Protocol. In September 2008, the <b>EtherCAT</b> Installation Profile was submitted to IEC 61784-5.|$|E
5000|$|<b>EtherCAT</b> master {{can access}} all data {{including}} name and data types of an <b>EtherCAT</b> slave without complex tools.|$|E
50|$|<b>EtherCAT</b> Technology Group (ETG) {{encourages}} {{and expects}} companies that develop <b>EtherCAT</b> products to join ETG, {{so that they}} can get an <b>EtherCAT</b> Vendor-ID, get access to the full documentation, to the developers forum and to the slave stack code, that Beckhoff provides free of charge to ETG members.|$|E
5000|$|In {{parallel}} {{to the development of}} <b>EtherCAT,</b> a fieldbus-independent safety protocol has been developed. For <b>EtherCAT,</b> it is available as [...] "Safety over EtherCAT" [...] (FSoE = Fail Safe over <b>EtherCAT).</b> With FSoE, functional safety with <b>EtherCAT</b> can be realized. The protocol as well as the implementation are certified by TÜV and meet the requirements of the Safety Integrity Level 3 according to IEC 61508. Since 2010, Safety over <b>EtherCAT</b> is internationally standardized to IEC 61784-3-12.EtherCAT provides a single-channel communication system for transferring safe and non-safe information. The transport medium is regarded as a black channel, and thus is not included in safety considerations.|$|E
50|$|Contrary to the {{operation}} of standard Ethernet, the slaves process the <b>EtherCAT</b> frames on the fly. This {{requires the use of}} hardware-integrated <b>EtherCAT</b> Slave Controllers (ESC) in the slaves. ESCs are also available as ASICs or based on FPGAs. Since the beginning of 2012, standard microprocessors with <b>EtherCAT</b> slave interfaces are also available.|$|E
50|$|Since <b>EtherCAT</b> uses {{standard}} Ethernet frames {{according to}} IEEE 802.3, any standard Ethernet tool {{can be used}} to monitor the <b>EtherCAT</b> communication. Additionally, there is free-of-charge parser software for Wireshark (formerly Ethereal, an open source monitoring tool) and the Microsoft network monitor, with which recorded <b>EtherCAT</b> data traffic can be comfortably prepared and displayed.|$|E
50|$|There is {{a choice}} of {{development}} boards, both from the <b>EtherCAT</b> Slave Controller suppliers and from third party vendors. There are also open-source projects for <b>EtherCAT</b> slave device development boards, such as SOES and ArduCAT.|$|E
50|$|By using gateways, {{existing}} networks such as CANopen, DeviceNet, or Profibus, can {{be integrated}} into the <b>EtherCAT</b> environment seamlessly. Furthermore, gateways provide a trip-free migration path from a traditional fieldbus to <b>EtherCAT,</b> reducing further investment costs.|$|E
50|$|The <b>EtherCAT</b> {{technology}} {{principle is}} scalable and not bound to 100 Mbit/s. A future extension to Gigabit Ethernet is possible, {{but is not}} in preparation at the moment since the <b>EtherCAT</b> performance is sufficient at 100 Mbit/s.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>EtherCAT</b> Technology Group (ETG) was {{established}} in 2003, and is the industrial Ethernet user organization with the most members in the world today. A wide range of industrial controls vendors, OEMs, machine builders, and technology organizations {{from around the world}} comprise the ETG member roster.The ETG offers its members implementation support and training, organizes interoperability tests (often called [...] "Plug Fests"), and promotes the development and distribution of the technology, supported by its members and the teams working in offices in Germany, China, Japan, Korea, and North America.ETG end users span numerous industries, with machine builders and suppliers of powerful control technology joining forces to support and promote <b>EtherCAT</b> technology. The variety of industries guarantees optimal preparation of <b>EtherCAT</b> for the widest range of applications. System partners give qualified feedback for the simple integration of hardware and software modules in all required equipment classes.The <b>EtherCAT</b> Conformance Test Tool (CTT), developed with the assistance of ETG member companies, ensures the interoperability and protocol conformity of <b>EtherCAT</b> devices.|$|E

5000|$|<b>EtherCAT</b> uses Standard Ethernet (IEEE 802.3 - Ethernet MAC and PHY) without modifications.|$|E
50|$|The fast, precise {{detection}} of disturbances {{is one of}} many diagnostic features of <b>EtherCAT.</b>|$|E
50|$|The <b>EtherCAT</b> {{protocol}} is {{optimized for}} process data and is transported directly within the standard IEEE 802.3 Ethernet frame using Ethertype 0x88a4. It may consist of several sub-telegrams, each serving a particular memory {{area of the}} logical process images that can be up to 4 gigabytes in size. The data sequence is independent of the physical order of the nodes in the network; addressing can be in any order. Broadcast, multicast and communication between slaves is possible, but must be initiated by the master device. If IP routing is required, the <b>EtherCAT</b> protocol can be inserted into UDP/IP datagrams. This also enables any control with Ethernet protocol stack to address <b>EtherCAT</b> systems.|$|E
50|$|Using {{full-duplex}} Ethernet physical layers, the <b>EtherCAT</b> slave controllers close an open port automatically {{and return}} the Ethernet frame if no downstream device is detected. Slave devices may have one, two, or more ports. Due to these features <b>EtherCAT</b> enables a multitude of network topologies, including line, tree, ring, star, or any combination thereof. The protocol also enables a multitude of communication features such as cable redundancy, Hot Connect of segments, change of devices during operation, or even master redundancy with Hot Standby.|$|E
50|$|Typical {{application}} fields for <b>EtherCAT</b> are machine controls (e.g. semiconductor tools, metal forming, packaging, injection molding, assembly systems, printing machines, robotics). Remote controlled hump yard facilities {{used in the}} railroad industry.|$|E
50|$|Actin {{software}} {{supports the}} following communication protocols for connecting the human operator (or autonomous agent software control system) to physical robotic hardware: Modbus, <b>EtherCAT,</b> CANopen, Serial, Data Distribution Service, UDP, and TCP.|$|E
5000|$|With <b>EtherCAT,</b> the {{standard}} Ethernet packet or frame (according to IEEE 802.3) {{is no longer}} received, interpreted, and copied as process data at every node. The <b>EtherCAT</b> slave devices read the data addressed to them while the telegram passes through the device, processing data [...] "on the fly". Similarly, input data are inserted while the telegram passes through. A frame is not completely received before being processed; instead processing starts as soon as possible. Sending is also conducted with a minimum delay of small bit times. Typically the entire network can be addressed with just one frame.|$|E
50|$|For {{the control}} and {{regulation}} of physical processes, high data integrity, data security, and synchronicity is required. <b>EtherCAT</b> has been designed especially {{for these kinds of}} applications and meets all demands for fast controls.|$|E
50|$|<b>EtherCAT</b> (Ethernet for Control Automation Technology) is an Ethernet-based {{fieldbus}} system, {{invented by}} Beckhoff Automation. The protocol is standardized in IEC 61158 and {{is suitable for}} both hard and soft real-time computing requirements in automation technology.|$|E
50|$|Modern {{measurement}} {{systems are}} characterized by multi-channeling, synchronicity, and accuracy. Due to the advanced protocol features of <b>EtherCAT,</b> efficient synchronous data throughput is assured. The network features based on Ethernet enable a measurement network with distributed measurement modules.|$|E
50|$|The goal during {{development}} of <b>EtherCAT</b> was to apply Ethernet for automation applications requiring short data update times (also called cycle times; ≤ 100 µs) with low communication jitter (for precise synchronization purposes; ≤ 1 µs) and reduced hardware costs.|$|E
50|$|The device {{profiles}} {{describe the}} application parameters and functional {{behavior of the}} devices, including device-specific state machines. The following software interfaces are provided for existing device profiles. Thus the migration to <b>EtherCAT</b> by adjusting the firmware and the hardware is simplified significantly.|$|E
50|$|For simple devices, no {{additional}} microcontroller is required. In more complex devices, however, the communication performance of <b>EtherCAT</b> is nearly {{independent of the}} performance of the used controller. Thus the requirements for the microcontroller are determined by the local application, e.g. the drive control.|$|E
50|$|SERCOS interface™ is a {{powerful}} real-time communication interface, ideal for demanding motion control applications. The SERCOS profile for servo drives and communication technology are standardized in IEC 61800-7. This standard also contains the mapping of the SERCOS servo drive profile to <b>EtherCAT</b> (IEC 61800-7-304).|$|E
50|$|Short {{cycle times}} can be {{achieved}} since the host microprocessors in the slave devices {{are not involved in}} the processing of the Ethernet packets to transfer the process images. All process data communication is handled in the slave controller hardware. Combined with the functional principle this makes <b>EtherCAT</b> a high performance distributed I/O system: Process data exchange with 1000 distributed digital I/O takes about 30 µs, which is typical for a transfer of 125 byte over 100Mbit/s Ethernet. Data for and from 100 servo axis can be updated with up to 10 kHz. Typical network update rates are 1-30 kHz, but <b>EtherCAT</b> can be used with slower cycle times, too, if the DMA load is too high on your PC.|$|E
50|$|CANopen™ {{devices and}} {{application}} profiles {{are available for}} an extensive selection of device categories and applications: I/O modules, drives (e.g., drive profile CiA 402 standardized as IEC 61800-7-201/301), encoders (CiA 406), proportional valves, hydraulic controllers (CiA 408), or application profiles. In this case, <b>EtherCAT</b> replaces CAN.|$|E
50|$|In {{commercial}} absolute encoders {{there are}} several techniques for transmission of absolute encoder data, including parallel binary, analog current, analog voltage, PWM, SSI, BiSS interface, ISI, Profibus, Profinet, Ethernet Powerlink, EtherNet TCP/IP, Modbus, DeviceNet, CANopen, <b>EtherCAT,</b> Endat and Hiperface, depending on the manufacturer of the device.|$|E
50|$|Thanks to the {{performance}} of <b>EtherCAT,</b> communication with external fieldbus masters is as fast as with traditional cards connected via PCI or other backbone buses. Since decentralized fieldbus interfaces lead to shorter extensions, they can be operated with even higher baud rates than would have been possible with the traditional architecture.|$|E
50|$|Industrial Ethernet (IE) {{is the use}} of Ethernet in an {{industrial}} environment with protocols that provide determinism and real-time control. Protocols for Industrial Ethernet include <b>EtherCAT,</b> EtherNet/IP, PROFINET, POWERLINK, SERCOS III, CC-Link IE, and Modbus/TCP. Many Industrial Ethernet protocols use a modified MAC (Media Access Control) layer to provide low latency and determinism. Some microcontrollers such as Sitara provide Industrial Ethernet support.|$|E
50|$|For {{synchronization}} a distributed clock {{mechanism is}} applied, {{which leads to}} very low jitter, significantly less than 1 µs, even if the communication cycle jitters, which {{is equivalent to the}} IEEE 1588 Precision Time Protocol standard (PTP). Therefore, <b>EtherCAT</b> does not require special hardware in the master device and can be implemented in software on any standard Ethernet MAC, even without dedicated communication coprocessor.|$|E
50|$|Bit errors during {{transmission}} are detected reliably by {{the analysis}} of the CRC check sum: the 32 bit CRC polynomial has a minimum Hamming distance of 4. Besides the error detection and localization protocol, the transmission physics and topology of the <b>EtherCAT</b> system allow individual quality monitoring of every single transmission path. The automated analysis of the according error counters enables the exact localization of critical network segments.|$|E
5000|$|The {{interface}} between the motion controller and drives it controls is very critical when coordinated motion is required, {{as it must}} provide tight synchronization. Historically the only open interface was an analog signal, until open interfaces were developed that satisfied the requirements of coordinated motion control, the first being SERCOS in 1991 which is now enhanced to SERCOS III. Later interfaces capable of motion control include Ethernet/IP, [...] Profinet IRT, Ethernet Powerlink, and <b>EtherCAT.</b>|$|E
