5|$|The {{plaintiff}} in Lines International {{argued that the}} guidelines adopted by the multi-agency committee {{set up by the}} PSA, STPB and GSB were invalid as the committee had no existence at law. The High Court held that there was nothing unlawful or even intrinsically wrong with these government agencies setting up such a committee to discuss matters of relevance to their respective jurisdictions as long as each agency made its own decisions within the ambit of its own statutory powers. The notion that such a committee fettered PSA's discretion was dismissed by a further <b>finding</b> <b>of</b> <b>fact</b> that the ad-hoc committee had not acted as an entity in itself. Enforcement and appropriate action were left to the agencies. A meeting attended by the plaintiff's representatives at which the guidelines relating to cruises-to-nowhere were announced was facilitated by a moderator rather than a chairperson, and each of the agencies read out guidelines which they themselves would be adopting and implementing.|$|E

500|$|Not {{satisfied}} with the verdict, the Bulletin again organized a campaign to fund an appeal, which was submitted to the Supreme Court of Canada; on March1, 1937, Ives' decision was overturned. [...] Chief Justice Lyman Duff, writing for the majority, accepted the jury's <b>finding</b> <b>of</b> <b>fact</b> and, echoing Justice Clarke, concluded that {{the framers of the}} Alberta Seduction Act had not intended that damage to a seductee be required to be the same as those to her father or employer (i.e. financial) in order to be actionable. [...] The court ordered Brownlee to pay $10,000 in damages to MacMillan, plus trial costs. [...] Henry Hague Davis in dissent focussed less on the questions of law and more on the evidence in the case, and argued that the jury's <b>finding</b> <b>of</b> <b>fact</b> was perverse and that the appeal should be dismissed.|$|E
500|$|The {{respondents}} {{argued that}} the provisions required that unlawful non-citizens be detained until their removal, and {{that the purpose of}} removal, on which the detention was founded, did not cease to exist just because it was not practicable in the foreseeable future to carry out that purpose. They made what was referred to as [...] "the 'never say never' proposition", that although securing a person's removal or deportation from Australia may be difficult, and [...] "often it takes years of diplomatic negotiation before a country is prepared to accept someone... {{it is very hard to}} imagine a case where the purpose of removal or deportation is one that can never occur." [...] Although the respondents did not challenge the <b>finding</b> <b>of</b> <b>fact</b> in the Federal Court that there was no real possibility of Al-Kateb's removal in the foreseeable future, they {{argued that the}} test applied to reach that decision [...] "fails to take into account... the difficulties and the fact that things can change." ...|$|E
500|$|The plaintiffs appealed and {{the case}} went before the Alberta Supreme Court appeals {{division}} in January 1935. [...] On February2, by a 3–2 decision, the court upheld Ives' ruling. [...] The majority ruling by Chief Justice Horace Harvey cast serious doubts on MacMillan's credibility, calling her story [...] "quite unsupported by other evidence" [...] and noting that she [...] "showed a readiness {{to admit that she}} may have been mistaken as regards very positive statements previously made when by the questions it appeared there may be independent evidence she was wrong". [...] In addition to agreeing with Ives on the points of law, he felt that the jury had not based its <b>finding</b> <b>of</b> <b>fact</b> on the evidence in the case. [...] Justices Mitchell and Ford concurred. [...] Justice Clarke, in dissent, agreed that MacMillan's story was unlikely, but expressed a willingness to defer to the jury on questions of fact. [...] On the legal questions, he cited a precedent written by Justice Harvey himself in which the chief justice had argued that the inclusion of seduced women as potential plaintiffs under the Seduction Act proved that its framers intended a broader definition of damage than financial damage. [...] Justice Lunney concurred. [...] The court was unanimous in upholding Ives' dismissal of Allan MacMillan's action, and he did not appeal further.|$|E

2500|$|A jury is a sworn body {{of people}} convened to render an {{impartial}} verdict (a <b>finding</b> <b>of</b> <b>fact</b> on a question) officially submitted {{to them by}} a court, or to set a penalty or judgment.

[...] In Anglophone jurisdictions, the verdict may be guilty or not guilty (not proven; a verdict of acquittal, based on the state's failure to prove guilt rather than any proof of innocence, is also available in Scotland). The old institution of grand juries still exists in some places, particularly the United States, to investigate whether enough evidence of a crime exists to bring someone to trial.|$|E

2500|$|There {{were four}} {{separate}} opinions. Sandra Day O'Connor wrote for a four-justice plurality {{that the government}} has a lower obligation to respect constitutional rights when it acts as employer rather than as the sovereign. Accordingly, in that situation it should not be required to meet a due process standard greater than the reasonableness of its own <b>finding</b> <b>of</b> <b>fact.</b> David Souter added a short concurring opinion qualifying the plurality, which he said was in fact a majority, with his insistence that in such cases the government must demonstrate that its understanding of what the employee said was not only a reasonable belief but a truthful one. Antonin Scalia concurred as well, but harshly criticized O'Connor's opinion. He read it as requiring a procedural handling of every possible adverse personnel action where First Amendment rights might be implicated, providing [...] "more questions than answers". John Paul Stevens' dissent argued that the First Amendment required that the lower court determine exactly what Churchill had said before ruling on whether it was protected.|$|E
2500|$|Walton's first {{contention}} {{before the}} Court was that [...] "every <b>finding</b> <b>of</b> <b>fact</b> underlying the sentencing decision {{must be made}} by a jury, not by a judge, and that the Arizona scheme would be constitutional only if a jury decides what aggravating and mitigating circumstances are present in a given case and the trial judge then imposes the sentence based on those findings." [...] But the Court had consistently rejected {{the suggestion that the}} Constitution required jury sentencing. [...] Aggravating factors were not [...] "elements" [...] of the crime; as the Court had previously held, they were merely standards to guide the choice between a death sentence or a sentence of life imprisonment. [...] Moreover, the Constitution does allow a judge to make the findings required by Enmund v. Florida and Tison v. Arizona. [...] The Enmund/Tison finding is not a substantive limit on the definition of a crime, and neither were aggravating factors. [...] Accordingly, the Sixth Amendment did not require a jury to pass on aggravating factors.|$|E

40|$|In State v. Connor, the Maine Supreme Judicial Court, sitting as the Law Court, {{upheld a}} trial judge’s denial of {{a motion to}} {{suppress}} evidence. Although the evidence presented in the suppression hearing seemed adequate to support the denial of the motion, the trial judge failed to clearly state his conclusions of law when denying the motion. However, the Law Court mistook the ambiguous conclusions of law as ambiguous <b>findings</b> <b>of</b> <b>fact.</b> Because the <b>findings</b> <b>of</b> <b>fact</b> were ambiguous in the court’s view, the majority and dissenting opinions spent {{the bulk of their}} energies discussing how the court should review a case when the <b>findings</b> <b>of</b> <b>fact</b> are ambiguous.

In essence, the <b>findings</b> <b>of</b> <b>fact</b> issue should not have been addressed at all. The Law Court simply mistreated an ambiguity in the trial judge’s legal conclusion as an ambiguity in its factual conclusion. Since the court reviews legal conclusions de novo, an ambiguous legal conclusion by a trial judge should not matter since the court will revisit the issue in full on appeal. Accordingly, the court should have simply undertaken a de novo review of the law applied to the facts in the case. However, because it mistook a legal conclusion for a factual one, the court spent considerable time discussing how to review a case when a historical fact is not clear from the <b>findings</b> <b>of</b> fact—a situation this Note will call the “Hypo. ” Along with examining the <b>facts</b> and opinions <b>of</b> the Connor case, and explaining how the court should have dealt with the case, this Note will also address the Hypo, and how the court should address an ambiguity in the <b>findings</b> <b>of</b> <b>fact...</b>|$|R
