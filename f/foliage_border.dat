5|$|To {{the left}} and right of Christ are shown John the Baptist and the Virgin Mary in supplicant poses, a {{traditional}} grouping; John {{was also one of the}} Duke's patron saints. Around the central scene small figures of the twelve Apostles carrying their identifying attributes emerge from the <b>foliage</b> <b>border</b> of oak leaves and tendrils; the uppermost heads on each side are replacements, probably by Weininger in the 1860s.|$|E

50|$|The {{engravings}} on {{the crystal}} are executed in the energetic and distinctive early mediæval Rheims style which originated in manuscript drawings {{such as those}} in the Utrecht Psalter. The crystal is surrounded by a 15th-century gilt-copper mount with a <b>foliage</b> <b>border,</b> which was once attributed to Saint Eligius (c. 588 - 660), the patron saint of goldsmiths.|$|E
60|$|Presently {{the party}} he trailed {{came to a}} halt. Its members {{concealed}} themselves in the <b>foliage</b> <b>bordering</b> the game trail along which they had come. Gust, that he might the better observe, clambered into {{the branches of a}} tree to the rear of them, being careful that the leafy fronds hid him from the view of his erstwhile mates.|$|R
50|$|The {{building}} was restored {{under the direction}} of the architect E.G. Bruton in 1866. During the restoration a number of late 13th century wall paintings were discovered inside the church. At the time these were whitewashed over again, but in 1932 they were uncovered again and restored. On the south wall is St Richard of Chichester with, below, the Adoration of the Magi, the Massacre of the Innocents, and the Angel appearing to St Joseph, all with <b>foliage</b> <b>borders.</b> On the north side of the nave over the arcade are paintings of the Tree of Jesse, St Christopher, the martyrdom of St Thomas Becket, the Coronation of the Virgin, the Baptism of Jesus, Saints Peter and Paul and the stoning of Saint Stephen. The church is now a Grade I listed building.|$|R
50|$|Several {{species are}} popular flowers for the garden, with {{cultivation}} {{going back to}} antiquity. The name Inula was already used by the Romans and derived from Helen of Troy fame. The smaller species are used in rock gardens and the more common larger ones, which tend to have very coarse <b>foliage,</b> in <b>borders.</b>|$|R

25|$|From {{studying}} Medieval windows, {{particularly those}} at Canterbury Cathedral, many stained glass artists became adept at designing <b>foliage</b> and decorative <b>borders</b> that reproduce archaeological originals. There are windows {{of this type}} in which the foliate design is overlaid with banners bearing scriptural texts.|$|R
60|$|Shefford {{slid down}} upon a grassy bank, {{and finding the}} tracks of the horses, he {{followed}} them. They led along the wall. As soon as he had assured himself that Nas Ta Bega had gone down the cañon he abandoned the tracks and pushed ahead swiftly. He heard the soft rush of running water. In {{the center of the}} cañon wound heavy lines of bright-green <b>foliage,</b> <b>bordering</b> a rocky brook. The air was close, warm, and sweet with perfume of flowers. The walls were low and shelving, and soon lost that rounded appearance peculiar to the wind-worn slopes above. Shefford came to where the horses had plowed down a gravelly bank into the clear, swift water of the brook. The little pools of water were still muddy. Shefford drank, finding the water cold and sweet, without the bitter bite of alkali. He crossed and pushed on, running on the grassy levels. Flowers were everywhere, but he did not notice them particularly. The cañon made many leisurely turns, and its size, if it enlarged at all, was not perceptible to him yet. The rims above him were perhaps fifty feet high. Cottonwood-trees began to appear along the brook, and blossoming buck-brush in the corners of wall.|$|R
40|$|Covered jar, {{sometimes}} called a potiche, {{is decorated with}} polychrome horsemen and dogs. White body background decorated with fanciful animals, patterned <b>borders,</b> <b>foliage</b> and flowers with basket weave decoration around the shoulder. Much of the patterns is red with polychrome occuring mostly on the costumed soldiers holding spears and animals...|$|R
50|$|On the {{external}} front {{wall of the}} hall is a marble plaque, the Warwick Amateur Rugby League War Memorial to Footballers. It lists nineteen footballers {{who lost their lives}} during the First World War. It is an honour board of classical influence with leaded lettering, and decorated with bas-relief carving. The base is supported by two brackets ornamented with acanthus leaves. Pilasters with Corinthian capitals and <b>foliage</b> motifs <b>border</b> the role, joined at the top by a dentil cornice. Above the cornice is a triangular pediment, within which are crossed rifles over a football and a crown at its apex.|$|R
60|$|So I {{awoke to}} the {{realization}} of that illusive thing, the mirage, a beautiful lie, false as stairs of sand. Far northward a clear rippling lake sparkled in the sunshine. Tall, stately trees, with waving green <b>foliage,</b> <b>bordered</b> the water. For a long moment it lay there, smiling in the sun, a thing almost tangible; and then it faded. I {{felt a sense of}} actual loss. So real had been the illusion that I could not believe I was not soon to drink and wade and dabble in the cool waters. Disappointment was keen. This is what maddens the prospector or sheep-herder lost in the desert. Was it not a terrible thing to be dying of thirst, to see sparkling water, almost to smell it and then realize suddenly that all was only a lying track of the desert, a lure, a delusion? I ceased to wonder at the Mormons, and their search for water, their talk of water. But I had not realized its true significance. I had not known what water was. I had never appreciated it. So it was my destiny to learn that water is the greatest thing on earth. I hung over a three-foot hole in a dry stream-bed, and watched it ooze and seep through the sand, and fill up--oh, so slowly; and I felt it loosen my parched tongue, and steal through all my dry body with strength and life. Water is said to constitute three fourths of the universe. However that may be, on the desert it is the whole world, and all of life.|$|R
