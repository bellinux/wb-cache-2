40|$|This {{white paper}} {{presents}} {{the findings from}} {{an analysis of the}} fiscal implications for vehicle owners of changing from the current statewide fuel tax to a “road user charge” (RUC) based on vehicle-miles traveled (VMT). Since 1923, California’s motor vehicle fuel tax has provided revenue used to plan, construct, and maintain the state’s publicly funded transportation systems. Over time, improvements in vehicle fuel efficiency and the effects of inflation have reduced both the revenue from the fuel tax and its purchasing power. Thus, there is growing interest among policy makers for replacing the state’s per-gallon fuel tax with an RUC based on VMT. This study analyzes the 2010 - 2011 California Household Travel Survey (CHTS) to identify the potential effects this policy change would be likely to have on households across the state. The analysis found that while <b>daily</b> household <b>fuel</b> <b>consumption</b> and VMT both appear to increase with household income, urban and rural households show roughly the same amount of <b>fuel</b> <b>consumption</b> and VMT. No statistically significant difference in cost was found between the two programs in any income group. This suggests that an RUC designed to collect the same amount of revenues statewide as the current fuel tax would not place a significant financial burden on California households...|$|R

In addition, one NGO utilized a controlled cooking test, which combined elements of lab- and field-based tests. In all cases, improved cookstoves (ICSs) were compared to local traditional cookstoves (TCSs). The results of the WBTs were mixed. Although the improved stoves generally showed some improvement in efficiency for the low-power simmering phases, the stoves were less efficient than traditional stoves in high-power water-boiling phases.

40|$|The current ship speed {{prediction}} {{at a given}} {{fuel consumption}} shows large differences with the actual operational values for the Happy Star. This can result in schedule fines, unexpected fuel expenditures and difficulties in bunker schedules. The first goal {{of this research is}} to improve these predictions for the expected range of weather conditions and expand it for cargo or no-cargo condition in good or bad weather. A second goal of this research is to gain insight in the uncertainty of predicting fuel consumption. A prediction model is built which takes into account the calm water, added resistance due to wind- and swell waves and added resistance due to wind. The total resistance follows from the sum of these separate components. The total resistance is translated to a value for <b>daily</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>consumption.</b> Using hind-casting a validation is performed with <b>daily</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>consumption</b> from noon reports. The uncertainties accompanied with these calculations are reported as well as the uncertainty propagation in the translation of resistance to consumed fuel. From the results of the simulations it seems justified to conclude that; 1. The separation of cargo/no-cargo conditions and good/bad weather gives an improved estimation the relation between vessel speed and <b>daily</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>consumption,</b> as expressed by the prediction error; a. For no-cargo condition from 79 % to 60 %/ 55 % in good/bad weather respectively b. For cargo condition from 79 % to 56 %/ 60 % in good/bad weather respectively 2. The goodness of the fit for no-cargo conditions is 63 % while this is 32 % for cargo conditions. This difference results from overhanging and high deck cargoes. 3. Wind resistance is the dominant resistance component after calm water resistance in all sailing conditions. In cargo condition during bad weather this contribution gets up to 32 % of the total resistance comparing to 9 % for wave resistance. 4. Following from the previous statement, the most important calculation parameters including highest uncertainty are the true wind angle, the wind load coefficient and true wind speed. Recommendations 1. In case of a long voyage with a large deck-cargo, BigLift should consider to perform a more extensive research on the wind resistance. 2.

In a questionnaire survey, <b>daily</b> data con-cerning <b>fuel</b> <b>consumption,</b> productivity and average ex-traction distance was provided on 18 forwarders, divided between final felling and thinning. Finally, accounting data on <b>fuel</b> <b>consumption</b> for 11 forwarders were obtained. In the field study, the <b>fuel</b> <b>consumption</b> varied between 8. 3 to 15. 7 l/PMH (productive machine hour) for different work elements. The total <b>fuel</b> <b>consumption</b> was 0. 28 - 0. 36 l/m 3 sub (solid under bark) at average extraction distances on 360 - 412 m for loads of sawlogs and 0. 43 - 0. 66 l/m 3 sub (458 - 514 m) for loads of pulpwood. 61 - 62 % of that fuel was consumed during loading and driving during load-ing. The forwarders consumed 0. 23 - 0. 38 l/ 100 m driving and the difference was only 10 % with and without load. In the questionnaire survey, the <b>fuel</b> <b>consumption</b> averaged 0. 62 l/m 3 sub (sawlogs and pulpwood, 318 m average ex-traction distance) for final felling (16 - 20 tonne forwarders) and 0. 92 l/m 3 sub (644 m) for thinning (11 - 14 tonnes). An exception was 2. 5 tonne forwarders that consumed only 0. 35 - 0. 37 l/m 3 sub (120 - 180 m). 89 % of the extracted volume in the accounting data was from thinnings and the <b>fuel</b> <b>consumption</b> was in average 0. 67 l/m 3 sub (100 - 200 m) for 9 to 11 tonne forwarders.

40|$|When a ship’s {{hull and}} {{propeller}} become fouled, {{the performance of}} the ship degrades. In these cases, the ship requires more engine power and fuel to reach the same operating speeds. Performance monitoring can be used to analyze the performance of a ship over time and help determine when hull and propeller cleanings should take place. Building on a previous thesis, two performance analysis models were developed in MATLAB. The techniques used in the models developed in this thesis are based upon techniques from the International Towing Tank Conference (ITTC) 1978 performance prediction method and the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) guidelines for assessment of speed and power trials. Both models rely on publicly available Automatic Information System (AIS) data to determine speed and location information. Both models use independent hindcast data for wave conditions, wind conditions, and water properties during the voyages. Both models also filter the data to remove situations which are undesirable to use for performance analysis, such as acceleration and maneuvering. The first model relies on <b>daily</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>consumption</b> readings and analyzes the performance on a per-noon-report basis.

40|$|The Cacheu Mangroves Natural Park (PNTC) was {{established}} in the year 2000 with the objective of protecting the coastal forests of Northern Guinea-Bissau, which have been subject to deforestation and are at risk. Concomitantly, the need to find sustainable financial revenues to support forest conservation motivated the development of projects that explore avoidance of deforestation and forest degradation (REDD+) as a potential income possibility. The 886, 150 ha of forest in the PNTC include a mosaic of different villages where communities with different cultural and socio-economic habits reside. In addition to the uncontrolled expansion of subsistence agriculture with the associated shortening of fallow periods, forests may have also been subject to degradation from selective logging, fuel wood collection, and charcoal production. To contribute to a forest degradation baseline forest uses for household fuel consumption (wood and charcoal) were surveyed using questionnaires, interviews and focus groups. The data were collected from a representative sample of circa 200 households within a 2 km buffer of the PNTC. These data are analyzed and the results are discussed according to a scenario of ethnic diversity, i. e., a diversity of approaches relating to forest conservation. Even though the results indicate that fuel wood is the main (and almost sole) source of energy for cooking, they also show that the average <b>daily</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>consumption</b> per capita (1. 21 kg) is well below the sub-Saharan average and that fuel is obtained from downed dead wood or dead trees.

This investigation explored the predictive capability of linear and generalized additive models (GAMs) in providing <b>daily</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>consumption</b> estimates for fishing vessels given knowledge of their length, engine power, fleet segment (annual dominant gear type), and fuel prices. Models were fitted to half of the Irish fishing vessel economic data collected between 2003 and 2011. The predictive capabilities of the seven best models were validated against the remaining, previously un-modelled, data. The type of gear used by a fleet segment had an important influence on fuel consumption as did the price of fuel. The passive pot gear and Scottish seine gear segments indicated consistently lower consumptions, whereas dredge and pelagic gears showed consistently higher fuel consumptions. Furthermore, increasing fuel price negatively affected fuel consumption, especially for more powerful, larger vessels. Of the formulated models, the best fit to training data were a GAM with a gear main effect and two smooth functions; standardized vessel length and engine power interacting with fuel price. For prediction, overall, this model showed the closest predictions with the least bias, followed by three linear models. However, all seven models compared for predictive capability performed well for the most sampled segments (demersal and pelagic trawlers). This is an author produced pre-print pdf.

40|$|Reducing fuel {{consumption}} of ships against volatile fuel prices and {{greenhouse gas emissions}} resulted from international shipping are the challenges that the industry faces today. The potential for fuel savings is possible for new builds, {{as well as for}} existing ships through increased energy efficiency measures; technical and operational respectively. The limitations of implementing technical measures increase the potential of operational measures for energy efficient ship operations. Ship owners and operators need to rationalise their energy use and produce energy efficient solutions. Reducing the speed of the ship is the most efficient method in terms of fuel economy and environmental impact. The aim of this paper is twofold: (i) predict ship {{fuel consumption}} for various operational conditions through an inexact method, Artiﬁcial Neural Network ANN; (ii) develop a decision support system (DSS) employing ANN based fuel prediction model to be used on-board ships on a real time basis for energy efficient ship operations. The fuel prediction model uses operating data -‘Noon Data’ - which provides information on a ship’s <b>daily</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>consumption.</b> The parameters considered for fuel prediction are ship speed, revolutions per minute (RPM), mean draft, trim, cargo quantity on board, wind and sea effects, in which output data of ANN is fuel consumption. The performance of the ANN is compared with multiple regression analysis (MR), a widely used surface ﬁtting method, and its superiority is conﬁrmed. The developed DSS is exemplified with two scenarios, and it can be concluded that it has a promising potential to provide strategic approach when ship operators have to make their decisions at an operational level considering both the economic and environmental aspects...|$|E
40|$|Containers are {{transported by}} global liner {{companies}} on regularly scheduled ship routes. A large variety of general cargos are containerized, such as manufactured products, food, and garment. Liner shipping services have fixed sequences of {{ports of call}} and fixed schedules, i. e., arrival and departure times at each port of call. Liner services are announced in advance to attract potential customers. Customers can arrange the delivery of their cargo based on the available date of the cargo at the origin port and the expected arrival date at the destination port. Therefore, container liner shipping is of significant importance to the global supply chain network. Different schedules mean different sailing times between ports, which dictate different sailing speeds. It is known in the shipping industry that the <b>daily</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>consumption</b> of ships increases approximately proportional to the sailing speed cubed. Therefore, schedule design affects the bunker fuel consumption and thereby air pollutant emission. Reducing the fuel consumption will also improve the sustainability of the global container transportation network. Container shipping lines provide weekly services for transporting containers, {{which means that the}} rotation time in terms of weeks for visiting all ports of call on a ship route is equal to the number of ships deployed. As a consequence, each port of call has a ship departure on the same day every week. When the speed of ships is higher, the rotation time is shorter, and hence fewer ships are required to maintain the weekly frequency. The objective of this thesis is to develop mathematical models and solution algorithms for designing the schedules of container liner shipping services. The aim is to minimize the sum of ship cost, fuel cost and inventory cost, while ensuring that ports are available to serve the ships on the planned days...|$|E

A closed, dynamic, mathematical model is used to study scheduling in a two-port system. The model will predict on a daily basis: the amount of cargo waiting at each port for shipment; the status of each dock [...] empty or occupied and if occupied, by which ship; the destination, estimated-time-of-arrival, amount of cargo on board, number of days in port and at sea, and the daily speed for each individual ship. Upon completion of a test case, the model will predict, by ship: the total time at sea and the cost thereof; the total time spent in port including time lost waiting for a vacant dock; the overall voyage cost and the average-daily-cost of each ship. Additionally, the model will predict the total amount of cargo generated for shipment at each port and the maximum quantity it builds up to at any time. The model will predict the cost of warehouse space needed to store freight awaiting shipment by the system. The model will accept any combination of ship size and speeds desired. If required, the model will alter automatically a shjp's established ETA to insure that upon arrival at its destination a vacant dock with cargo waiting to be put on board will be available. The model has the following restrictions: It is limited to two ports. It assumes sufficient stevedore gangs and equipment to permit simultaneous loading and unloading of different vessels in the same port on a 24 -hour basis. There is no distinction between different cargo classes. The model does not provide for cargo delays. The model considers its ships always in service with no time lost for maintenance.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to analyse how biomass based haulage in Ireland {{performed}} as a measure of efficiency under 4 main criteria; distance travelled, fuel consumption, fuel consumption per unit of biomass hauled and diesel CO 2 emissions. The applicability of truck engine diagnostic equipment was tested to analyse the schedule of engine data that could be recorded in real-time from a 5 axle articulated biomass truck. This identified how new on board truck technology in Ireland could be used to monitor data in real-time, specifically fuel consumption, litre/km, litre/ton and distance to allow for informed analysis of how efficient new biomass trucking operations currently are in Ireland. Fleet Management System (FMS) monitoring systems are a relatively new technology in biomass and log transport in Ireland. They are more common place in the food supply chain with refrigerated units travelling across continental Europe where food temperature and truck movements are controlled data from a central dispatch. A GPS asset tracking monitoring system was also installed on the truck over the test period to record trip log data. The BT (biomass truck) was a 5 axle, 2004 DAF XF Euro III 430 hp 4 * 2. Initial results showed that for the BT, the average <b>daily</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>consumption</b> varied from 0. 23 L/km to 0. 47 L/km. The thresholds of travelled distance were between 20. 92 km and 434. 91 km respectively with average fuel consumption per tonnage of woodchips of 0. 16 L/ton and 5. 68 L/ton. When the total daily distance is limited to 1 load within 200 km roundtrip versus 1 load at approximately 400 km trip, the % difference in logistic cost (€/T) is 56 %. Delivering 2 loads per 400 km trip shows a 5. 4 % decrease in logistic costs versus the Trip 1 scenario confirming the increased efficiency of a more localised transport approach. A maximum percentage difference in costs of 45 % that exists between a 2 load and 1 load trip occurs for Trip 22 and Trip 5 but this increases to 72 % when analysing for 2 load versus 1 load for distances over 400 km. Trip 7 and 12 are both below 50 km and seem to be the exception and to compare could possibly show an element of distortion. The closest logistic cost to Trip 12 is Trip 5 with 113 % higher costs confirming how a 50 km roundtrip can impact significantly on lowering biomass transport costs...|$|E
40|$|Introduction: Nowadays {{the number}} of motor {{vehicles}} in large and small cities is growing. Increasing {{the number of}} motor vehicles leads to serious increase {{of the amount of}} environmental pollution and <b>daily</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>consumption.</b> Motor vehicle emissions that are known as the most air polluting emissions cause 50 - 90 percent of air pollution. With large increasd in the number of motor vehicles and their emissions todays, many researchers have investigated engine optimization in order to reduce emissions of motor vehicles. But {{due to the lack of}} affordable changes in the physical structure of the engine, it is not possible to create major changes in the amount of engine exhaust. Hence, in order to improve engine performance and reduce emissions, a lot of research has been carried out on changes in the fuel and engine inlet air. So, in this study a new method has been proposed and tested in order to detect changes in the charactristics of emissions. So, the effects of enriched nitrous oxide gas on the exhaust emissions of a spark-injection engine were investigated. In this way, a certain amount of Nitrous Oxide (N 2 O) gas was mixed with the engine inlet air (with concentration of 0, 4, 8, 12 and 16 percent) and it was injected to the engine. Then its effect was studied on emission parameters at various engine rotational speeds. Then, by using genetic algorithm, the optimal values of N 2 O concentration and engine rotational speed were determined to reach the minimum emission parameters. Materials and Methods: To measure the engine emission parameters including CO, CO 2, HC and NOx, the expriments were conducted after preparing a system to inject inlet air with different percentages of N 2 O into an Otto engine (model: M 13 NI). In this study, the randomized complete block design was used to investigate the effect of N 2 O concentration (five levels) and engine rotational speed (three levels) on exhauste emission parameters. Each expriment was replicated 9 times. For statistical analysis, Duncan’s multiple range test and multivariate analysis of variance were performed by using SPSS Software. Also, each factor was modeled by polynomial equations and the obtained models were optimized in three dimensions by genetic algorithm method in MATLAB Software. After optimization ofeach emission parameter in the same time by multi-objective optimization regression, separately, and determination of the best value of N 2 O concentration in the inlet air andthe engine rotational speed, the optimizations were compared in order to obtain the minimum value of emission parameters. Results and discussion: The experimental results indicated that by increasing N 2 O concentration in the inlet air of motor vehicle engine, the amounts of CO and HC were significantly decreased and the amounts of CO 2 and NOx were significantly increased. Also, the results of this study showed that increasing the engine rotational speed at the same time with increasing the N 2 O concentration caused a significant decrease in the amounts of CO, CO 2, HC and NOx. The optimal amount of N 2 O concentration and engine rotational speed by genetic algorithm method were obtained to be 14. 545...|$|E

It is necessary to minimize aircraft delays in air and on ground and thereby minimize aviation <b>fuel</b> <b>consumption.</b> This paper presents a method for the <b>fuel</b> <b>consumption</b> estimation, which has fuel efficient trajectory as one of the interesting by-products. The method presented in this paper, uses <b>fuel</b> <b>consumption</b> information directly from the flight manual provided by the aircraft manufacturer to predict <b>fuel</b> <b>consumption</b> accurately using neural network approach. <b>Fuel</b> <b>consumption</b> information is collected from the pilotx 2019;s flight manual and segregated with respect to the different phases of flight like climb, cruise and descent. This segregated <b>fuel</b> <b>consumption</b> data is then presented to the neural network for the estimation of <b>fuel</b> <b>consumption</b> for different phases of flight. <b>Fuel</b> <b>consumption</b> is estimated using the neural networks and compared to the actual performance data given in the flight manual for validation. This neural network based information is then used for the estimation of <b>fuel</b> <b>consumption</b> for a chosen mission profile. The concept of fuel efficient trajectory will be used for the studies on optimized aviation <b>fuel</b> <b>consumption</b> which will lead to an improvement of air transport economics...|$|R
40|$|The {{possibilities}} {{to simulate}} <b>fuel</b> <b>consumption</b> and optimize a vehicle's powertrain {{to fit to}} the customer's needs are great strengths in the competitive bus industry where <b>fuel</b> <b>consumption</b> {{is one of the}} main sales arguments. In this master's thesis, bus specific powertrain component models, used to simulate and predict <b>fuel</b> <b>consumption,</b> are validated using measured data collected from buses. Additionally, a sensitivity analysis is made where it is investigated how errors in the powertrain parameters affect <b>fuel</b> <b>consumption.</b> After model improvements it is concluded that the library components can be used to predict <b>fuel</b> <b>consumption</b> well. During the work, possible model uncertainties which affect <b>fuel</b> <b>consumption</b> are identified. Hence, this study may serve as foundation for further investigation of these uncertainties...|$|R
40|$|Landscape fires {{occur on}} a large scale in (sub) {{tropical}} savannas and grasslands, affecting ecosystem dynamics, regional air quality and concentrations of atmospheric trace gasses. <b>Fuel</b> <b>consumption</b> per unit of area burned is an important but poorly constrained parameter in fire emission modelling. We combined satellite-derived burned area with fire radiative power (FRP) data to derive <b>fuel</b> <b>consumption</b> estimates for land cover types with low tree cover in South America, Sub-Saharan Africa, and Australia. We developed a new approach to estimate <b>fuel</b> <b>consumption,</b> based on FRP data from the polar-orbiting Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and the geostationary Spinning Enhanced Visible and Infrared Imager (SEVIRI) in combination with MODIS burned-area estimates. The <b>fuel</b> <b>consumption</b> estimates based on the geostationary and polar-orbiting instruments showed good agreement in terms of spatial patterns. We used field measurements of <b>fuel</b> <b>consumption</b> to constrain our results, but the large variation in <b>fuel</b> <b>consumption</b> in both space and time complicated this comparison and absolute <b>fuel</b> <b>consumption</b> estimates remained more uncertain. Spatial patterns in <b>fuel</b> <b>consumption</b> could be partly explained by vegetation productivity and fire return periods. In South America, most fires occurred in savannas with relatively long fire return periods, resulting in comparatively high <b>fuel</b> <b>consumption</b> as opposed to the more frequently burning savannas in Sub-Saharan Africa. Strikingly, we found the infrequently burning interior of Australia to have higher <b>fuel</b> <b>consumption</b> than the more productive but frequently burning savannas in northern Australia. Vegetation type also {{played an important role in}} explaining the distribution of <b>fuel</b> <b>consumption,</b> by affecting both fuel build-up rates and fire return periods. Hummock grasslands, which were responsible for a large share of Australian biomass burning, showed larger fuel build-up rates than equally productive grasslands in Africa, although this effect might have been partially driven by the presence of grazers in Africa or differences in landscape management. Finally, land management in the form of deforestation and agriculture also considerably affected <b>fuel</b> <b>consumption</b> regionally. We conclude that combining FRP and burned-area estimates, calibrated against field measurements, is a promising approach in deriving quantitative estimates of <b>fuel</b> <b>consumption.</b> Satellite-derived <b>fuel</b> <b>consumption</b> estimates may both challenge our current understanding of spatiotemporal <b>fuel</b> <b>consumption</b> dynamics and serve as reference datasets to improve biogeochemical modelling approaches. Future field studies especially designed to validate satellite-based products, or airborne remote sensing, may further improve confidence in the absolute <b>fuel</b> <b>consumption</b> estimates which are quickly becoming the weakest link in fire emission estimates...|$|R

40|$|This study {{proposes a}} <b>fuel</b> <b>consumption</b> {{estimation}} system and method with lower cost. On-board units can report vehicle speed, and user devices can send fuel {{information to a}} data analysis server. Then the data analysis server can use the proposed <b>fuel</b> <b>consumption</b> estimation method to estimate the <b>fuel</b> <b>consumption</b> based on driver behaviours without fuel sensors for cost savings. The proposed <b>fuel</b> <b>consumption</b> estimation method is designed based on a genetic algorithm which can generate gene sequences and use crossover and mutation for retrieving an adaptable gene sequence.

40|$|With an {{unstable}} oil market and increasing prices, {{the focus has}} never been higher on reducing the <b>fuel</b> <b>consumption</b> costs. Using a navigation system that presents the fastest route, can today help a driver to reduce the <b>fuel</b> <b>consumption</b> by {{reducing the risk of}} not finding the target. A further development of such system is eco-routing: route optimization with regard to <b>fuel</b> <b>consumption.</b> Eco-routing is today being introduced to the market by several passenger car manufacturers. An essential part of an eco-routing system is estimation of <b>fuel</b> <b>consumption.</b> The requirements of a <b>fuel</b> <b>consumption</b> model for trucks is studied in this thesis. Two estimation methods were evaluated and compared, one of the methods was estimating <b>fuel</b> <b>consumption</b> using look up tables consisting <b>fuel</b> <b>consumption</b> data. The other method was estimation doing real time calculations with a <b>fuel</b> <b>consumption</b> model. With a simplified real time model the modelling error was approximately lower than 5 % for rural and highway driving, however for city driving the accuracy was significantly reduced. Ecorouting simulations for a truck showed a mean saving of 8. 5 % for a set of long haulage routes...|$|R
