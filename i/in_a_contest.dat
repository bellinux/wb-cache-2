5|$|By July Dyer {{was back}} in Britain and was fit enough to {{re-enter}} the ring, stopping Nicol Brady via technical knockout <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>contest</b> in Wallsend. He followed this with a points decision over Jack Zimmer and then won through Will Brooks' disqualification <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>contest</b> held in Cardiff. In November 1920 Dyer was invited to the National Sporting Club in London to face 'Bermondsey' Billy Wells. During the bout the referee twice instructed both men to make a proper contest of the fight. The referee let the match go the full fifteen rounds and then, instead of declaring a winner, he called the fight a 'no contest', with the fighters' purse being given to charity. After the National Sporting Club debacle, Dyer turned {{more and more to}} his singing and very few fights are recorded after 1920. A fight against Jim Slater in January 1922 is believed to be his last bout.|$|E

Watched by a crowd of 100,000 and a television audience of five million, Manchester City took an early lead through Joe Hayes, but Noel Kinsey equalised midway through the first half. Second half goals from Jack Dyson and Bobby Johnstone gave Manchester City a 3–1 victory. The match is best remembered for the heroics of Manchester City goalkeeper, Bert Trautmann, who continued playing despite breaking a bone in his neck in a collision with Birmingham City's Peter Murphy.|$|E
5|$|Following his NHL rookie season, Eberle {{joined the}} Canadian men's {{team for the}} second {{consecutive}} year for the 2011 IIHF World Championship in Slovakia.

Pelé accusations led to an eight-year feud between the pair. As {{a consequence of the}} affair, the President of FIFA, João Havelange banned Pelé from the draw for the 1994 FIFA World Cup in Las Vegas. Criticisms over the ban were perceived to have negatively affected Havelange's chances of re-election as FIFA's president in 1994.|$|E
5|$|<b>In</b> <b>a</b> <b>contest,</b> a row {{of small}} cages, each housing a single male finch, is lined up {{approximately}} six feet apart along a street. The close proximity of the cages increases the number of calls, as the birds sing for mates and to establish territory. A timekeeper begins and ends the contest with a red flag. Every time a bird sings a correct terminating flourish to their callmost often transcribed as susk-e-wieta tally mark in chalk is made on a long wooden stick. The bird singing its song the most times during one hour wins the contest. Champion finches regularly sing hundreds of calls in contests.|$|E

Near {{the end of the}} bout, Khan distracted the referee, at which time Steiner came down to the ring and interfered in the match, allowing Williams to perform his signature Canadian Destroyer maneuver. SoCal Val then interfered as the referee was counting the pinfall, removing him from the ring. Khan began to chase Val, before Sonjay Dutt came to her rescue. When Williams went for another pin attempt, Lethal countered it into a small package pin, winning the match and retaining the TNA X Division Championship.|$|E
5|$|Middleton-led Texas A went 24-9 {{and lost}} in the NCAA Tournament Round of 64 to Florida State 57-50, <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>contest</b> in which Middleton contributed 16 points. He was {{selected}} to the All-Big 12 Second Team {{at the conclusion of}} the regular season. The U.S. Basketball Writers Association named Middleton to the 10-man All-District VII team covering college basketball players in the states of Texas, Arkansas, and Louisiana. He was recognized as an All-Eighth District second-team selection by the National Association of Basketball Coaches making him eligible for the State Farm Division I All‐America teams. Since the Big 12 Conference was its own district, this is equivalent to being named second team All-Big 12 by the NABC.|$|E

5|$|Pleydell {{returned}} as a Member for Wootton Bassett in 1563. His appointment {{was made possible}} by the patronage of former Member for Marlborough Sir John Thynne, an eminent figure in Wiltshire politics who was the county's custos rotulorum for at least 20 years. Pleydell had supported Thynne <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>contest</b> over the Knighthood of the Shire in 1559, which doubtless assisted his bid for parliamentary selection. Wootton Bassett's other seat was occupied by Matthew Poyntz, with whom Pleydell served until 1567. Replacing Christopher Dysmars and Humphrey Moseley from the 1559 session, they were succeeded in 1571 by Henry Knyvet and John Winchcombe.|$|E
5|$|Reared in Utah in a respected, if impoverished, Mormon family, Brodie {{drifted away}} from {{religion}} during her graduate studies in literature at the University of Chicago.

5|$|The team's {{previous}} experience was with turn-based combat games, and it struggled {{to develop a}} real-time combat system affected by customizable attributes and abilities that provided feedback to the player on how those statistics were affecting the battle. It initially found that by adhering too closely to the White Wolf source material rules for guns, where {{the effectiveness of a}} shot is determined <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>contest</b> between the player's skill and the opponent's defense, the firearms seemed broken; the player would not hit where they aimed. Troika found it difficult to mesh the available factors in a real-time setting. Melee combat had to deal with a variety of melee weapons and animations and adjust for melee-on-melee and melee-on-ranged combat.|$|E
