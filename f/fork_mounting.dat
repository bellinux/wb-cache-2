5000|$|SILEX (Semiconductor-laser Intersatellite Link Experiment) is a laser link, {{which has}} been used both to {{communicate}} with the SPOT-4 remote-sensing satellite and with a plane in flight. [...] It uses a 60 mW AlGaAs laser diode as the transmitter and a photodiode detector, with a 25 cm telescope aperture, and a data rate of 50Mbit/s; it weighs about 160 kg and uses 150 watts of power. [...] The telescope is in a <b>fork</b> <b>mounting.</b> The system is designed and built by Astrium.|$|E
5000|$|Low riders are {{specifically}} designed to be mounted on a specific kind of fork.Touring bicycles usually have a front fork {{with one or two}} threaded eyelets for M5 bolts on the front dropout on each side. These are for mounting fenders and/or luggage carrier. Another mid-fork eyelet [...] "braze-on" [...] is positioned 160 to 175 mm above it for mounting a low rider front luggage carrier. [...] There is no established standard for the position of the mid-fork eyelet. Most low riders are adjustable to compensate for this.Some forks have mid-fork eyelets on the inside as well as outside to provide mounting of some specialized carriers such as the Tubus Duo.For bicycles that do not have these eyelets or [...] "braze-ons", various alternatives exist. Some of these {{come in the form of}} [...] "U-Bolts", clamps, or some sort of clamp-on eyelet (see Tubus Aluminum Alloy <b>Fork</b> <b>Mounting</b> Kit) When installing carriers, a drop of thread locking compound is advised to ensure that the screws do not loosened from vibrations under load.|$|E

50|$|Garradd {{was born}} in Australia and lived his early life in Sydney, Canberra, Oberon, and Tamworth. Astronomy has been an {{interest}} since his childhood, and he has built many telescopes himself, starting with a 20 cm (8") f/7 Newtonian while still in high school, graduating to making mirrors up to 46 cm (18″) diameter and mounts up to the <b>fork</b> <b>mount</b> for the 46 cm f/5.4 Newtonian, and German equatorial mounted 25 cm (10") f/4.1 that he used for observing near-Earth asteroids and comets.|$|R
5000|$|The Open <b>Fork</b> <b>mount</b> has a <b>Fork</b> {{attached}} to a right ascension axis at its base.

The mount resembles an Altazimuth mount, but with the azimuth axis tilted and lined up to match earth rotation axis with a piece of hardware usually called a [...] "wedge".|$|R
