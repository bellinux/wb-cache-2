40|$|Carpetlayers {{have a high}} {{prevalence}} of occupational knee morbidity, partly attributable to {{their use of the}} <b>knee</b> <b>kicker</b> to stretch carpet for wall-to-wall installation. While a mechanical alternative "power stretcher" is available, knee kickers are still widely used. A questionnaire survey indicated that unavailability of the mechanical stretcher at installation sites was a major factor for continued use of the <b>knee</b> <b>kicker.</b> Strategies to reduce use of the <b>knee</b> <b>kicker</b> are discussed...|$|E
40|$|Carpet layers {{comprise}} {{less than}} 0. 06 % of the United States workforce yet they submit 6. 2 % of compensation claims for traumatic knee inflammation. Their work involves multiple sources of acute and chronic knee trauma including kneeling, pressure from sharp objects, {{and use of}} a device called a "knee kicker" to stretch wall to wall carpet. To characterise the knee morbidity in carpet layers and to identify occupational risk factors, a questionnaire was completed by 112 carpet and floor layers, 42 tile and terrazo setters, and 243 millwrights and bricklayers (MWBL). The MWBL comparison workers seldom kneel and do not use a <b>knee</b> <b>kicker.</b> Physical and xray examinations were conducted on a subset of 108 respondents to validate the questionnaire responses. Compared with the MWBL, carpet layers reported more frequent bursitis (20 % v 6 %), needle aspiration of knee fluid (32 % v 6 %), and skin infections of the knee (7 % v 2 %). A score indicating frequency of using the <b>knee</b> <b>kicker</b> was the only statistically significant predictor of bursitis, whereas the score for kneeling {{was one of several}} predictors of knee aspiration and skin infections of the knee. These data suggest that carpet and floor layers experience substantially more knee morbidity than other occupational groups, and that kneeling and use of the <b>knee</b> <b>kicker</b> are risk factors providing opportunities for prevention...|$|E
50|$|The Broncos {{traveled}} to Cleveland Browns Stadium {{to face the}} Cleveland Browns in what would again be a primarily defensive struggle. The Broncos again had a 100-yard rusher in Tatum Bell, with 115 yards (and also 1 touchdown), and also had a 100-yard receiver in Javon Walker, with 107 yards. Former Bronco Reuben Droughns was held to just 33 yards rushing and 27 yards receiving (60 yards total). Jake Plummer again struggled, throwing 1 touchdown (to rookie Brandon Marshall, {{the first of his}} career), but also 2 interceptions. Although Denver committed 2 turnovers, they also forced three; one interception (by Champ Bailey, making it three consecutive games with an interception) and two fumbles. After Jake Plummer threw his second interception of the day in their own red zone, the Browns scored their only points when Charlie Frye threw a touchdown pass to Joe Jurevicius in the fourth quarter, only the second touchdown allowed by the Broncos all year. It also ended their second 11-quarter streak without a touchdown allowed of the season. Denver at the time had only allowed 44 points all season, the lowest in the league. However, {{in one of the few}} items of bad news for the Broncos, left tackle Matt Lepsis suffered a season-ending <b>knee</b> injury. Also, <b>kicker</b> Jason Elam missed just his second field goal of the season in the third quarter.|$|R
