Also, the study demonstrates that currency substitution in Nigeria was low during the period under review and as such classified Nigeria as moderately dollarized economy. Subsequently, alternative policy options for curtailing currency substitution in Nigeria were explored. The study concludes that currency substitution is an element of Nigerians’ behaviour concerning wealth allocation and as such macroeconomic policies that ensure long periods of low inflation and exchange rate stability become the most powerful policy option that could help stabilize or reduce currency substitution. Also very paramount are the development of domestic financial markets with relevant infrastructural facilities and the development of new financial instruments, which will serve as alternatives to holding money in the domestic economy. ...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{examines}} the empirical performance of {{alternatives to the}} monetary aggregates currently published by the Bank of Canada. The results show that real M 1 and real M 1 alpha perform about equally well in providing leading information about real output at short horizons. However, on theoretical grounds, M 1 alpha is a more attractive aggregate, since it excludes federal government deposits held at trust companies (M 1 excludes only such deposits held at banks). Also, the broad aggregates - M 2 +, M 2 delta (the sum of M 2 +, treasury bills, provincial savings bonds, and Canada Savings Bonds), M 3 beta (the sum of M 2 delta, mutual funds, 1 - to 3 -year government bonds, mortgage-backed securities, foreign holders of Canadian dollar <b>deposits,</b> and <b>foreign</b> <b>currency</b> <b>deposits</b> of residents booked in Canada), and LLbeta (the sum of M 3 beta, bankers' acceptances, and commercial paper issued by non-financial corporations) - generally are the best in providing leading information about inflation at long horizons (one to two years) across the various models that were considered.

40|$|The {{previous}} currency law of Nov. 22, 1983 imposed many {{restrictions on}} currency transactions, {{making it impossible}} to implement market mechanisms into that sphere of economic activity. Basic assumptions of a new <b>Foreign</b> <b>Currency</b> Act of Feb. 15, 1989 is the principle according to which the duty to obtain a permit to enter into a <b>foreign</b> <b>currency</b> transaction is required only in matters expressly stated in the Act.
