25|$|The Cormorant-class gunvessels (sometimes {{known as}} Eclipse-class gunvessels) were {{a class of}} 4-gun {{first-class}} gunvessels built for the Royal Navy in the 1860s. They were somewhat unsuccessful; intended for shore bombardment in shallow water, they exceeded their <b>design</b> <b>draft</b> by 50%. Seven of the 13 ships ordered were suspended, with 3 finished or converted as survey ships and the other 4 cancelled. Racehorse was wrecked after only 4 years, and those ships that were completed as planned had short operational lives, in some cases less than 10 years. The survey vessels (Myrmidon, Sylvia and Nassau) lasted longest, with the last ship of the class, Sylvia, being broken up in 1890.|$|E

[...] He has also drawn a yonkoma parody of a Japanese dictionary. His work has been described as breaking new ground for themes in comedic manga, and as showing [...] "meticulous detail".

5000|$|The Marine {{is never}} {{referred}} to by name. The original game's co-designer John Romero said this was to increase player immersion.

The sole non-playable character, Buddy Dacote, bore the most similarities to the original game's eventual protagonist. [...] "Dacote" [...] is an acronym for [...] "Dies at conclusion of this episode", and Buddy was supposed to be killed by a boss {{at the end of the}} planned third episode. In the finished product, this nearly happens to the Marine in the final level of the first episode, but he continues his adventure.|$|E
50|$|Antigua was {{the first}} of the ships from Bethlehem Shipbuilding Corporation with keel laying 30 April 1931, launch on 12 December 1931 and {{delivery}} on 1 April 1932.

5000|$|The DOT-111 tank {{cars are}} {{constructed}} with a draft sill <b>design.</b> <b>Draft</b> sills incorporate the draft gear behind each coupler {{that is designed}} to transfer longitudinal draft (tension) and buff (compression) forces throughout the length of a train. The draft sills are attached to steel pads that are attached to the tank. If the cars do not incorporate a continuous center sill extending {{the entire length of the}} car, the two draft sills at each end are referred to as stub sills, and the tank carries draft forces between couplers. In this case, reinforcing bars may be extended underneath the tank between the draft sills. Body bolsters and their associated body bolster pads centered above the railcar trucks support the tank and protect it against lateral forces. The draft sill center plate serves as the attachment point between the tank car body and the truck assembly. (See schematic cutaway at right.) ...|$|E

Near the Lions Fountain a mosaic floor marks a former place for tea parties under the former King’s Lime Tree {{which was one}} of the most impressive solitary trees on the estate. In front of the Curiosity pavilion is the “La Laitière“ Fountain. It is an erratic crowned with a milkmaid bronze sculpture. The sculpture was a gift to Charles by his sister Charlotte in 1827. It was a copy of the original sculpture by Russian sculptor Pavel Sokolov (1764-1835) on the pleasure ground at the palace of Tsarskoye Selo. The sculpture refers to the fable about the milkmaid and her pail by Jean de La Fontaine. Today’s copy was created in the Soviet Union in 1987. The Boy’s Fountain is located in the middle of the pleasure ground. At its place was at first a sentimental memorial fountain called the “Monument“. Only after 1851 it was rebuilt into today’s Boy’s Fountain. It was inspired by a fountain <b>design</b> <b>draft</b> by Friedrich August Stüler published in 1850 on which the (destroyed) Frog’s Fountain in Sanssouci was modelled. For the Frog’s Fountain Friedrich Wilhelm Dankberg (de) created a statue of a boy carrying a bowl from which Prince Charles commissioned a zinc copy. On Lenné hill half hidden at bushes a „remnants of columns arrangement” is placed. The arrangement includes two column sections of the ancient Greek temple of Poseidon at Cape Sounion, a capital from the Pantheon in Rome and another one from the St. Paul's outside the Walls basilica in Rome.|$|E
