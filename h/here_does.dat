5|$|Experimentation {{with real}} bikes {{has so far}} {{confirmed}} the weave mode predicted by the eigenvalues. It was found that tire slip and frame flex are not important for the lateral dynamics of the bicycle in the speed range up to 6 m/s. The idealized bike model {{used to calculate the}} eigenvalues shown <b>here</b> <b>does</b> not incorporate any of the torques that real tires can generate, and so tire interaction with the pavement cannot prevent the capsize mode from becoming unstable at high speeds, as Wilson and Cossalter suggest happens in the real world.|$|E
5|$|At 10:00a.m., Coast Guard {{stations}} and United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) Weather Bureau offices at Lake Superior ports raised white pennants above square red flags with black centers, indicating a storm warning with northwesterly winds. By late afternoon, the storm signal flags were {{replaced with a}} vertical sequence of red, white, and red lanterns, indicating that a hurricane with winds over 74mph (119km/h) was coming. (The word hurricane <b>here</b> <b>does</b> not refer to a tropical cyclone, but to Force 12 winds on the Beaufort scale.) The winds on Lake Superior had already reached 50mph (80km/h), and an accompanying blizzard was moving toward Lake Huron.|$|E

Carnival in turn ends with the grand brilé Vaval, the burning of Vaval, the king of the Kannaval, amidst the cries and wails of the crowd.|$|E
500|$|As {{these works}} became more widely available, reviews and essays about African literature– {{especially}} from Europe– began to flourish. Bristling against the commentary flooding his home country, Achebe published an essay entitled [...] "Where Angels Fear to Tread" [...] in the December 1962 issue of Nigeria Magazine. In it, he distinguished between the hostile critic (entirely negative), the amazed critic (entirely positive), and the conscious critic (who seeks a balance). He {{lashed out at}} those who critiqued African writers from the outside, saying: [...] "no man can understand another whose language he does not speak (and 'language' <b>here</b> <b>does</b> not mean simply words, but a man's entire world view)." [...] In September 1964 he attended the Commonwealth Literature conference at the University of Leeds, presenting his essay [...] "The Novelist as Teacher".|$|E
500|$|Part of {{what this}} {{argument}} shows {{is that there is}} a least upper bound of the sequence 0.9, 0.99, 0.999, etc.: a smallest number that is greater than all of the terms of the sequence. [...] One of the axioms of the real number system is the completeness axiom, which states that every bounded sequence has a least upper bound. [...] This least upper bound is one way to define infinite decimal expansions: the real number represented by an infinite decimal is the least upper bound of its finite truncations. [...] The argument <b>here</b> <b>does</b> not need to assume completeness to be valid, because it shows that this particular sequence of rational numbers in fact has a least upper bound, and that this least upper bound is equal to one.|$|E

500|$|The mindstate {{described}} in the above interview rules the content on the album, as the lyrics are loaded with violent narratives and braggadocio and little else, as Buckshot and 5ft try to solidify their status in rap. Allmusic's Chris Witt stated that [...] "Emcees Buckshot and 5ft Accelerator attack their verses with an aggressive nihilism not heard since Kool G Rap's peak." [...] 5ft, originally known as 5FT Accelerator, [...] appears on three tracks here, and his lyrical content does not differ from that of Buckshot's. Unlike later work by New York City peers like Nas, the lyrical content found <b>here</b> <b>does</b> not peer deeply into social issues or provide much substance. Allmusic's album review stated that [...] "Theirs is a grim reality, filled with guns, weed and violence. Buckshot displays none of the usual gangster remorse, he is a willful public menace." ...|$|E

2500|$|Some dispute has waged {{over the}} {{etymology}} of Naglfar. In the late 19th century, Adolf Noreen proposed that nagl- <b>here</b> <b>does</b> not have its usual meaning of [...] "nail", but, instead, is {{a variant of}} Old Norse nár (meaning [...] "corpse") and ultimately derives from Proto-Indo-European *nok-w-i. Noreen claimed {{that the notion of}} Naglfar as a 'nail-ship' is due to a folk etymology; that elaboration on the folk etymology produced the concept of a [...] "nail-ship".|$|E
2500|$|The [...] "invisible", <b>here,</b> <b>does</b> not {{correspond}} to that which {{is too small to}} be seen with the naked eye, or to radiation to which the eye is not sensitive, but rather to life, which is forever invisible because it is radically immanent and never appears in the exteriority of the world. [...] No-one has ever seen a force, a thought or a feeling appear in the world in their inner reality; no-one has ever found them by digging into the ground.|$|E
2500|$|It is {{here also}} that Bakhtin {{introduces}} an [...] "architectonic" [...] or schematic {{model of the}} human psyche which consists of three components: [...] "I-for-myself", [...] "I-for-the-other", and [...] "other-for-me". The I-for-myself is an unreliable source of identity, and Bakhtin argues {{that it is the}} I-for-the-other through which human beings develop a sense of identity because it serves as an amalgamation {{of the way in which}} others view me. Conversely, other-for-me describes the way in which others incorporate my perceptions of them into their own identities. Identity, as Bakhtin describes it <b>here,</b> <b>does</b> not belong merely to the individual, rather it is shared by all.|$|E

Continuing northeast, Route104A terminates at its parent route, NY104, which previously carried the Seaway Trail in Niagara Falls and <b>here</b> <b>does</b> so again.

2500|$|The colors vary {{depending}} on the source consulted. The 1930 color calendar displayed here has days of purple, blue, yellow, red, and green, in that order beginning [...] Blue was supported by an anonymous writer in 1936 as {{the second day of the}} week, but he stated that red was the first day of the week. However, most sources replace blue with either [...] or peach, all of which specify the different order yellow, pink/orange/peach, red, purple, and green. The partial 1930 black and white calendar from Kingsbury and Fairchild (1935) displayed <b>here</b> <b>does</b> not conform to any of these because its red day is the fifth day of the week, which even disagrees with their own statement that red was the third day of the week.|$|E
2500|$|Leroy Huizenga, a Catholic {{theology}} professor, {{acknowledges the}} question's origin {{in a dispute}} between rabbis as to whether divorce was permissible for adultery, for [...] "many" [...] reasons, or for [...] "any reason, including 'even if he find one fairer than she'", and claims Jesus' reply as meaning that Genesis trumps Moses allowing divorce in Deuteronomy. Huizenga argues that Jesus' reference to Genesis is [...] "likely" [...] to include the command in Genesis 1:28 to [...] "Be fruitful and multiply." [...] Thus for him, Jesus is affirming that marriage is a union meant to be fruitful, ideally to result in children. Huizenga says Jesus' teaching about marriage <b>here</b> <b>does</b> modify the position held by his Jewish contemporaries, but in drawing on the creation accounts it is [...] "more radical and less permissive".|$|E

In this sense the ready-to-hand is primordial compared to that of the present-at-hand. The term primordial <b>here</b> <b>does</b> not imply something Primitive, but rather refers to Heidegger's idea that Being can only be understood through what is everyday and [...] "close" [...] to us. Our everyday understanding of the world is necessarily essentially a part of any kind of scientific or theoretical studies of entities — the present-at-hand — might be. Only by studying our [...] "average-everyday" [...] understanding of the world, as it is expressed in the totality of our relationships to the ready-to-hand entities of the world, can we lay appropriate bases for specific scientific investigations into specific entities within the world.|$|E
