40|$|Abstract: According to {{the linear}} {{viscoelastic}} model, the population discrete elements under the vibration working {{condition of the}} seed tray of the seeder were assumed as rigid conditions to analyze the collision process. The dynamic characteristics among the population collision process for the vibration process of the seeder were analyzed by tracing the microcosmic motion of each seed. The following conclusions were concluded, including the relationship between population velocity, phase angle as well as coefficient of restitution and the vibration intensity, {{the relationship between the}} center-of-gravity position as well as volume expansion coefficient of the population after collision and the vibration period, the relationship between the center-of-gravity position as well as volume expansion coefficient of the population after collision and the vibration frequency. This provides basis for determining the vibration work parameters of the precise vibration seeder. Based on agricultural machinery design experience and air-suction vibration principles, a new test bench for precise vibration air-suction tray seed metering device was researched by electromechanical integration technology. Performance test was carried out with oilseed rape seeds as the research object. The test results show that when the vibration frequency is 10. 5 Hz, the vibration amplitude is 4 mm, the vacuum negative pressure value is 3 kPa, the rotating velocity of the <b>discharge</b> <b>plate</b> is near 15 r/min, the pass index of the seeder will exceed 96 %, which provides basis for the structural adjustment and work parameter optimization of the seeder...|$|E

40|$|AbstractIn this research, a {{high-frequency}} high-voltage {{power supply}} designed for plasma generator is presented. The power supply mainly consists of a series resonant converter with a high-frequency high-voltage boost transformer. Due to the indispensable high-voltage inheritance {{in the operation of}} plasma generator, the analysis of transformer need considering not only winding resistance, leakage inductance, magnetizing inductance, and core-loss resistance, but also parasitic capacitance resulted from the insulation wrappings on the high-voltage side. This research exhibits a simple approach to measuring equivalent circuit parameters of the high-frequency, high-voltage transformer with stray capacitance being introduced into the conventional modeling. The proposed modeling scheme provides not only a precise measurement procedure but also effective design information for series-load resonant converter. The plasma <b>discharging</b> <b>plate</b> is designed as part of the electric circuit in the series load-resonant converter and the circuit model of the plasma <b>discharging</b> <b>plate</b> is also conducted as well. Thus, the overall model of the high-voltage plasma generator is built and the designing procedures for appropriate selections of the corresponding resonant-circuit parameters can be established.

The objective {{of this paper was}} to obtain the structural variables of a TLFC unit by theoretical modeling and experimentation on a tangential flow threshing cylinder unit (TFC unit) and longitudinal axial flow threshing cylinder unit (LFC unit). Threshing and separation equations for five types of threshing teeth (knife bar, trapezoidal tooth, spike tooth, rasp bar, and rectangular bar), were obtained using probability theory. Results demonstrate that the threshing and separation capacity of the knife bar TFC unit was stronger than the other threshing teeth. The length of the LFC unit was divided into four sections, with helical blades on the first section (0 - 0. 17 m), the spike tooth on the second section (0. 17 - 1. 48 m), the trapezoidal tooth on the third section (1. 48 - 2. 91 m), and the <b>discharge</b> <b>plate</b> on the fourth section (2. 91 - 3. 35 m). Test results showed an un-threshed grain rate of 0. 243 %, un-separated grain rate of 0. 346 %, and broken grain rate of 0. 184 %.

The casing contains a single, resealable vent (202). During charging, oxygen generated at the positive plate (110) diffuses through the mat (122) and decomposes at the negative plate (112).

40|$|The {{state of}} stress in a TiN-coated {{stainless}} steel wire upon tensile loading was analyzed theoretically using a classical model of continuum elasticity, from which the interfacial mechanical {{properties of the coating}} system were deduced. Specimens for the tensile test were prepared by deposition of TiN films on stainless steel wires using a hollow cathode <b>discharge</b> ion <b>plating</b> (HCD-IP) coater. Cross-section SEM shows that the TiN produced by the ion plating technique has good coverage on the steel wires and that the thickness ratio between the thickest and the thinnest coatings is 3. 57. The failure mechanism of the TiN films upon tensile loading is found to depend on the coating thickness. Opening mode prevails in the thick coatings where periodic cracks perpendicular to the tensile axis developed; on the other hand, shearing mode takes place in the thin coatings where cracks inclined to the tensile axis by 45 degrees occurred. On the basis of the experimental observations and the theoretical calculation, the shear strength of the TiN, the ultimate shear strength and the bonding strength of the TiN/steel interfaces were estimated to be 15. 36, 9. 87 and 1. 06 GPa, respectively.

40|$|The {{microstructure}} {{and chemistry}} of TiN coatings on type {{304 stainless steel}} were characterized by using a Zeiss EM 902 A energy filtering transmission electron microscope equipped with an electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS) detector. Thin TiN films were produced by a hollow cathode <b>discharge</b> ion <b>plating</b> coater. It was found by plan-view transmission electron microscopy that the microstructure of the TiN coatings is thickness-dependent. The grain size of TiN ranges from 88 nm at the coating surface down to 9 nm near the TiN-steel interface. In addition, the TiN surface layer shows some degree of texture, but the sub-surface and internal TiN layers are mainly equiaxial and randomly oriented. Chemical analysis by EELS shows that the relative oxygen content increases approximately from the TiN surface to the TiN-steel interface, whereas the relative nitrogen content first decreases slowly and then drops rapidly near the interface. The presence of a Ti 2 N phase and the deficiency of nitrogen near the TiN-steel interface suggest that the early-deposited TiN is non-stoichiometric. By the periodic cracking method, the ultimate shear stress at the TiN/steel interface and the residual stress in the TiN thin film were estimated to be 2. 2 and 12. 8 GPa, respectively.

40|$|Ion plating {{involves}} the transportation of vapour through a low pressure glow discharge to form solid coatings on negatively biased substrates. Although the method has gained commercial acceptance, particularly for engineering applications, {{much of the}} underlying science of the process is poorly understood. This work is concerned with investigating certain mechanisms occurring within the ion plating environment, and their role in process optimisation. The work has concentrated primarily on electron beam evaporation in thermionically enhanced discharges. Investigations have centred on various aspects of discharges used in ion plating {{and the influence of}} gas scattering mechanisms on the vapour species during deposition. This has been achieved by analysing the published literature and performing experiments involving cathode sheath thickness measurements, sputter weight loss determinations, optical emission spectroscopy and coating thickness evaluation. The main findings are:(i) Thermionically enhanced discharges can considerably reduce cathode sheath thickness, providing benefits in terms of bombardment uniformity and energy transportation. However, the influence of plasma bombardment is anisotropic and also falls off exponentially with distance from the thermionic emitter. This can be offset by a comparable reduction in coating flux arrival rates if the thermionic emitter is positioned close to the vapour source. (ii) The incorporation of nitrogen in (reactive) ion <b>plating</b> <b>discharges</b> may reduce the rate of ion generation, particularly in the presence of thermionic emitters. Nitrogen dissociative charge transfer collisions within the cathode sheath may be signif icant but their practical importance is questionable. (iii) There is evidence to suggest that the metal vapour in an argon ion <b>plating</b> <b>discharge</b> transports most of the ion current to the substrate and {{at least some of the}} material arrives as atomic clusters. (iv) A model which unifies coating thickness uniformity with source to substrate distance has been developed. This predicts the existence of a virtual source phenomenon...|$|R
