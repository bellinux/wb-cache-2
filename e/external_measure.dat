40|$|Structural econometric {{methods that}} assume agents have {{rational}} expectations are often criticized. Yet, {{little is known}} about the relative costs and benefits of adopting alternative empirical strategies. This paper compares three procedures for inference about a single structural parameter using data from a laboratory price search experiment. Our novel experimental design induces preferences up to the subjective rate of time preference, leaving unrestricted only this parameter and the decision rule that subjects use in solving the search task. We analyze the experimental data under the assumptions of both rational expectations and heuristic behavior, and we also draw inferences using a simple revealed preference analysis that does not require strong behavioral assumptions. We find that the revealed-preference analysis does not provide much information about the discount rate, while stronger behavioral assumptions provide sharper and statistically identical inferences about the population's discount rate distribution. However, substantial differences in inference appear at the individual level. We compare the individual discount-rate estimates to an <b>external</b> <b>measure</b> of forward looking behavior obtained for each subject using an instrument validated in the psychology literature. The estimates obtained under heuristic behavior are statistically significantly positively correlated with our <b>external</b> <b>measure</b> of time preference, while the estimates obtained under rational expectations and the revealed-preference estimates are not...|$|E

40|$|Mechanical loading is {{believed}} to be a critical factor in the development and treatment of knee osteoarthritis. However, the contact forces to which the knee articular surfaces are subjected during daily activities cannot be measured clinically. Thus, the ability to predict internal knee contact forces accurately using <b>external</b> <b>measures</b> (i. e., <b>external</b> knee loads and muscle electromyographic [EMG] signals) would be clinically valuable. We quantified how well external knee load and EMG measures predict internal knee contact forces during gait. A single subject with a force-measuring tibial prosthesis and post-operative valgus alignment performed four gait patterns (normal, medial thrust, walking pole, and trunk sway) to induce a wide range of external and internal knee joint loads. Linear regression analyses were performed to assess how much of the variability in internal contact forces was accounted for by variability in the <b>external</b> <b>measures.</b> Though the different gait patterns successfully induced significant changes in the external and internal quantities, changes in <b>external</b> <b>measures</b> were generally weak indicators of changes in total, medial, and lateral contact force. Our results suggest that when total contact force may be changing, caution should be exercised when inferring changes in knee contact forces based on observed changes in external knee load and EMG measures. Advances in musculoskeletal modeling methods may be needed for accurate estimation of in vivo knee contact forces. 頲 012 Orthopaedic Research Society. No Full Tex...|$|R

The common good is by definition the purpose of society. In economics, the only purpose of society is surplus.

The first and third elements of the common good might be incorporated into economics with little fuss. The second justification is the most subversive of the economic conception of the common good, because it refuses to take human preferences as given, and therefore rejects preferences as normative.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Control of Allergic Rhinitis and Asthma Test for Children (CARATKids) is {{the first}} {{questionnaire}} that assesses simultaneously allergic rhinitis and asthma control in children. It was recently developed, but redundancy of questions and its psychometric properties were not assessed. This study aimed to (i) establish {{the final version of}} the CARATKids questionnaire and (ii) evaluate its reliability, responsiveness, cross-sectional validity, and longitudinal validity. METHODS: A prospective observational study was conducted in 11 Portuguese centers. During two visits separated by 6 wk, CARATKids, visual analog scale scales and childhood asthma control test were completed, and participant's asthma and rhinitis were evaluated by his/her physician without knowing the questionnaires' results. Data-driven item reduction was conducted, and internal consistency, responsiveness analysis, and associations with <b>external</b> <b>measures</b> of disease status were assessed. RESULTS: Of the 113 children included, 101 completed both visits. After item reduction, {{the final version of the}} questionnaire has 13 items, eight to be answered by the child and five by the caregiver. Its Cronbach's alpha was 0. 80, the Guyatt's responsiveness index was - 1. 51, and a significant (p < 0. 001) within-patient change of CARATKids score in clinical unstable patients was observed. Regarding cross-sectional validity, correlation coefficients of CARATKids with the <b>external</b> <b>measures</b> of control were between 0. 45 and - 0. 69 and met the a priori predictions. In the longitudinal validity assessment, the correlation coefficients between the score changes of CARATKids and those of <b>external</b> <b>measures</b> of control ranged from 0. 34 to 0. 46.
