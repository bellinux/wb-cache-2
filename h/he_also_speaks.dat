25|$|Poirot is {{diverted}} {{to stay in}} an English village inn when his chauffeur-driven car breaks down. Although he doesn't appreciate the badly cooked meal he is served, he does enjoy relaxing {{in front of the}} fire in his room after his walk through the snow to reach the establishment. He is interrupted by the mechanic who is trying to repair the car. The young man – Ted Williamson – is impossibly handsome and well-built, like a Greek god, and Poirot is reminded of a shepherd in Arcady. Williamson knows of Poirot's reputation and asks him to trace a young girl who has disappeared. The previous June, Williamson was called out to a large house nearby called 'Grasslawn' to repair a broken radio. The house owners and their guests were out boating and he was shown in by the maid to a Russian ballet dancer who was staying there. The golden-haired maid was called Nita and Williamson fell for her. He went out for a walk with her and she said she would be back with her mistress in two weeks time and would see him again but when the time had come for their second meeting, the maid was different. The new maid, Marie Hellin, gave him an address in North London to write to contact Nita – but his letter came back unanswered. Poirot visits this address and was told the girl, an Italian, had returned to her home country. She is described by the landlady as dark-haired and bad-tempered, whereas the girl Williamson described was golden-haired. Poirot tries to trace Nita through her former employer, Katrina Samoushenka, but is told that the dancer has gone to Switzerland. <b>He</b> <b>also</b> <b>speaks</b> with the owner of 'Grasslawn', Sir George Sanderfield, who remembers Marie – with some unease – but doesn't recall a maid on the first occasion of Madame Samoushenka's visit to his house, and thinks Poirot is mistaken. Marie is the subject of Poirot's next visit. She was employed in the last week of June when the previous maid had left, possibly due to illness. She hints that she knows something of Sir George that Poirot would like to know, but the detective doesn't take up the offer, much to her annoyance.|$|E

6000|$|First. There {{flows from}} this godly fear a godly reverence of God. [...] "He is great," [...] said David, [...] "and greatly {{to be feared}} in the {{assembly}} of his saints." [...] God, as I have already showed you, is the proper object of godly fear; it is his person and majesty that this fear always causeth {{the eye of the}} soul to be upon. [...] "Behold," [...] saith David, [...] "as the eyes of servants look unto the hand of their masters, and as the eyes of a maiden unto the hand of her mistress; so our eyes wait upon the Lord our God, until that he have mercy upon us" [...] (Psa 123:2). Nothing aweth the soul that feareth God so much as doth the glorious majesty of God. His person is above all things feared by them; [...] "I fear God," [...] said Joseph (Gen 42:18). That is, more than any other; I stand in awe of him, he is my dread, he is my fear, I do all mine actions as in his presence, as in his sight; I reverence his holy and glorious majesty, doing all things as with fear and trembling before him. This fear makes them have also a very great reverence of his Word; for that also, I told you, was the rule of their fear. [...] "Princes," [...] said David, [...] "persecuted me without a cause, but my heart standeth in awe," [...] in fear, [...] "of thy word." [...] This grace of fear, therefore, from it flows reverence of the words of God; of all laws, that man feareth the word; and no law that is not agreeing therewith (Psa 119:116). There flows from this godly fear tenderness of God's glory. This fear, I say, will cause a man to afflict his soul, when he seeth that by professors dishonour is brought to the name of God and to his Word. Who would not fear thee, said Jeremiah, O king of nations, for to thee doth it appertain? He speaks it as being affected with that dishonour, that by the body of the Jews was continually brought to his name, his Word, and ways; <b>he</b> <b>also</b> <b>speaks</b> it of a hearty wish that they once would be otherwise minded. The same saying in effect hath also John in the Revelation--"Who shall not fear thee, O Lord," [...] said he, [...] "and glorify thy name?" [...] (Rev 15:4); clearly concluding that godly fear produceth a godly tenderness of God's glory in the world, for that appertaineth unto him; that is, it is due unto him, it is a debt which we owe unto him. [...] "Give unto the Lord," [...] said David, [...] "the glory due unto his name." [...] Now if there be begotten {{in the heart of the}} godly, by this grace of fear, a godly tenderness of the glory of God, then it follows of consequence, that where they that have this fear of God do see his glory diminished by the wickedness of the children of men, there they are grieved and deeply distressed. [...] "Rivers of waters," [...] said David, [...] "run down mine eyes, because they keep not thy law" [...] (Psa 119:136). Let met give you for this these following instances-- ...|$|E
