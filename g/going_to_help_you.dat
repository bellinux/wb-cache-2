500|$|In 1990 William Bennett, who at {{the time}} was drug czar of the United States, visited a drug {{treatment}} centre in Pittsburgh and upon noticing a poster of Bart remarked, [...] "You guys aren't watching The Simpsons, are you? That's not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>help</b> <b>you</b> any." [...] When a backlash over the comment ensued, Bennett apologized, claiming he [...] "was just kidding" [...] and saying [...] "I'll sit down with the little spike head. We'll straighten this thing out." [...] In a 1991 interview, Bill Cosby described Bart as a bad role model for children, calling him [...] "angry, confused, frustrated." [...] In response, Matt Groening said, [...] "That sums up Bart, all right. Most people are in a struggle to be normal. He thinks normal is very boring, and does things that others just wished they dare do." [...] On January 27, 1992, then-President George H. W. Bush said, [...] "We are going to keep on trying to strengthen the American family, to make American families a lot more like the Waltons and a lot less like the Simpsons." [...] The writers rushed out a tongue-in-cheek reply {{in the form of a}} short segment which aired three days later before a rerun of [...] "Stark Raving Dad" [...] in which Bart replied, [...] "Hey, we're just like the Waltons. We're praying for an end to the Depression, too." ...|$|E
2500|$|After the {{disastrous}} First Test in Brisbane the tour selectors {{sent back to}} London for the 41-year-old Cowdrey as a replacement batsmen. Cowdrey was highly regarded by the MCC team and in particular by Mike Denness, who had succeeded him as captain of Kent. In his 20-year Test career he had faced the Australian fast bowlers Keith Miller, Ray Lindwall, Alan Davidson, Ian Meckiff, Gordon Rorke and even the young Dennis Lillee. Although the Australian press was aghast at such a recall – Cowdrey had not played a Test in four years – the tourists were keen to have a man with the technique and strength of purpose to play the fastest of bowlers. He arrived in Perth with the wives of the MCC team after a 19-hour delay in Bombay, too late to play a practice match, and was called up for the Second Test two days after he arrived and with three hours in the nets. This was his sixth tour of Australia matching {{the record of the}} Lancashire spinner Johnny Briggs. Cowdrey walked to the crease to an ovation from the 16,000 crowd at the WACA, but not from Jeff Thomson. His greeting of [...] "How good to meet you" [...] was rebuffed with [...] "That's not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>help</b> <b>you</b> fatso, piss off." ...|$|E
2500|$|On a trip in Jerusalem, Rodriguez-Lopez {{purchased}} an archaic ouija-type talking {{board at}} a curio shop {{as a gift}} for Bixler-Zavala. They would return to their tour bus after shows to play with it during their 2006 tour with the Red Hot Chili Peppers, as it quickly became the band's post-show ritual. Dubbed [...] "The Soothsayer", the board revealed stories, gave names and made demands, as the band was contacted by three different people who appeared in the form of one, who was then referred to as [...] "Goliath". The more the band interacted with [...] "The Soothsayer", otherworldly coincidences began plaguing the band's experience writing and recording The Bedlam in Goliath: Blake Fleming, their drummer at the time, quit mid-tour and left the band with financial troubles; Bixler-Zavala wound up needing surgery performed on his foot due to the shoes he had been wearing, forcing him to relearn how to walk post-surgery; audio tracks sporadically disappeared from the studio's harddrives; Rodriguez-Lopez's home studio flooded and was subject to multiple power outages; and the album's original engineer went through a nervous breakdown, leaving behind all previous work with no notes as to where anything was. The engineer who quit stated to Rodriguez-Lopez: [...] "I'm not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>help</b> <b>you</b> make this record. You're trying to do something very bad with this record, you're trying to make me crazy and you're trying to make people crazy." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "No, sir; I'm <b>going</b> <b>to</b> enjoy {{every moment}} of it; and you're <b>going</b> <b>to</b> let me <b>help,</b> <b>you</b> know--look over papers and all that. I'm the heiress, you must remember," [...] she said wickedly.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, our {{war with}} you folks is over," [...] said Larry, slowly, hardly {{knowing how to}} proceed. [...] "If <b>you</b> are not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>help</b> the rebels, <b>you</b> ought <b>to</b> <b>help</b> us. We are doing all we can for your prisoners out here," [...] he added, meaning the Spaniards that were being held by the forces under General Aguinaldo--soldiers who were {{captured}} during the struggle between Spain and her Philippine colonies.|$|R

6000|$|... "One speaks convincingly," [...] he said, [...] "when {{one really}} feels. Some day, remember," [...] he continued, [...] "we are <b>going</b> <b>to</b> have a long, long talk.

6000|$|... "Lord love you, son," [...] soothed Howard Griffin, [...] "we aren't {{trying to}} change your opinion of Frazer. We're, your friends, you know. We're proud of you for {{standing}} up for him. Only thing is, now that he's practically fired, just tell me how it's <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>help</b> him or <b>you</b> or anybody else, now, to make everybody sore by roasting them because they can't agree with you.

They are lying under the ashes of that hut of yours, close to the tree where you buried your treasure; and it's I who am <b>going</b> <b>to</b> have <b>help,</b> not <b>you.</b> My man will be up in a few minutes," [...] and he glanced round at the constable, whom the bush ranger now perceived, for the first time, less than half a mile away.|$|R
6000|$|... "Don't {{stand there}} hesitating!" [...] she ordered. [...] "Do as I say! You don't expect I am <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>help</b> <b>you</b> {{to buy your}} wretched {{property}} if you refuse me the simplest of favors? Hurry, I say! Hurry!" ...|$|E
