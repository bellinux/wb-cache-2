5|$|Pick had {{a strong}} {{interest}} in design and its use in public life. He steered the development of the London Underground's corporate identity by commissioning <b>eye-catching</b> commercial art, graphic design and modern architecture, establishing a highly recognisable brand, including the first versions of the roundel and typeface still used today. Under his direction, the UERL's Underground network and associated bus services expanded considerably reaching out into new areas and stimulating the growth of London's suburbs. His impact on the growth of London between the world wars led to him being likened to Baron Haussmann and Robert Moses.|$|E
5|$|In his 13-year, 924-game NBA playing career, Cousy {{finished}} with 16,960 points, 4,786 rebounds and 6,955 assists, translating to averages of 18.4 points, 5.2 rebounds and 7.5 assists per game. He {{was regarded as}} the first great point guard of the NBA, winning eight of the first 11 assist titles in the league, all of them en bloc, and had a highly successful career, winning six NBA titles, one MVP award, 13 All-Star and 12 All-NBA First and Second Team call-ups and two All-Star MVP awards. With his <b>eye-catching</b> dribbling and unorthodox passing, Cousy popularized modern guard play and raised {{the profile of the}} Boston Celtics and the entire NBA. His fast-paced playing style was later emulated by the likes of Pete Maravich and Magic Johnson.|$|E

25|$|In March 2016, Ili married Morgan Roberts. Roberts {{currently}} attends Oregon Tech University on {{a basketball}} scholarship. In 2015, {{she earned a}} Tall Ferns trial after <b>eye-catching</b> performances for the North Harbour Under 23 and Harbour Breeze WBC teams.|$|E
25|$|Although Stimpson's {{career in}} senior cricket had ended, {{in the mid-1970s}} he {{appeared}} on several occasions for Zambia in East African tournaments, and in August 1976 produced an <b>eye-catching</b> performance, hitting 89 and 128* as an opener as Zambia beat Tanzania.|$|E
25|$|Bearers of banners, fans, icons, treasure, {{or other}} <b>eye-catching</b> items, or leading exotic animals. This {{was a very}} {{important}} part of Roman triumphs, as booty gave the Roman populace visual proof of the warrior's success. The most elaborate evolution of this is the spectacular floats of Carnival parades. A simpler example is the ring bearer at a wedding.|$|E
25|$|Thaksin Shinawatra was {{the first}} prime {{minister}} of Thailand to complete a full term in office, and his rule is generally agreed to {{have been one of}} the most distinctive in the country's modern history. He initiated many <b>eye-catching</b> policies that distinguished him from his predecessors. They affected the economy, public health, education, energy, social order, drug suppression and international relations. He gained one re-election victory.|$|E
25|$|The {{final result}} was a chapel, {{complete}} with its unornamented yellow stock brick walls, a tall, <b>eye-catching</b> yet gracefully simple steeple, and simple botanically accurate rose windows, created a dramatic but tasteful and purposeful piece; one that epitomised its low gothic nondenominational function well, whilst establishing Abney Park as a local landmark visible from the thoroughfares of Church Street and the High Street, and from Woodberry Downs in the middle distance.|$|E
25|$|The exposition, also {{featuring}} {{an innovative}} and <b>eye-catching</b> exhibition design, devised {{by some of}} the most prominent Italian artists of the time, (among them, the architect Giuseppe Pagano) was a great success. At its closing, Benito Mussolini ordered that the official Regia Aeronautica museum (Museo storico dell'Accademia Aeronautica), which at the time was located in the Palace of Caserta in southern Italy, was to be moved to Milan and merge with the Caproni Museum, becoming the National Aeronautical Museum (Museo Nazionale Aeronautico).|$|E
25|$|Dolichovespula norwegica has <b>eye-catching</b> {{black and}} yellow color {{patterns}} throughout its body. Starting from the face, {{it has a}} long malar space and is separated by a black bar that runs vertically. The sides of the thorax contain small black hairs that project outwards and the rear has distinct yellow spots. One can often see red coloring {{on the front of}} the abdomen. Dolichovespula is derived from the Greek word, dolichos, which means long. Its genus name matches with physical characteristics.|$|E
25|$|The most {{exciting}} and <b>eye-catching</b> part is its golden frontage, which is decorated by large bas-reliefs and statues with the symbols (Angel, Ox, Lion, Eagle) of the Evangelists created by Maitani and collaborators (between 1325 and 1330) {{standing on the}} cornice above the sculptured panels on the piers. In 1352 Matteo di Ugolino da Bologna added the bronze Lamb of God above the central gable and the bronze statue of Saint Michael {{on top of the}} gable of the left entrance.|$|E
25|$|This {{set him up}} for the 1988 English season, and he put in some <b>eye-catching</b> performances. These {{included}} ten wickets in {{the match}} against Somerset, which helped Worcestershire to an innings victory; a further nine against Lancashire in early June; {{and in the next}} match, his career-best bowling figures of 8–52 in a rain-affected match against Middlesex. He also took nine wickets against a powerful Essex team containing Graham Gooch and Allan Border, picking up Border's wicket in both innings.|$|E
25|$|The newly {{formatted}} series, {{stemming from}} Trinny & Susannah Undress..., began to air on ITV on 7 November 2007, and explores {{some of the}} major fashion problems in Britain. Numerous <b>eye-catching</b> stunts were filmed for the first series of the show in order to emphasise the points raised by Trinny and Susannah. One stunt included Susannah Constantine being transformed into a 70-year-old to look at how people dress for their age. Breasts, bras and uniforms were also some of the themes investigated during the first series.|$|E
25|$|At first I {{was only}} {{thinking}} about the response from my clique of art school and skateboard friends. The fact that a larger segment of the public would not only notice, but investigate, the unexplained appearance of the stickers was something I had not contemplated. When I started to see reactions and consider the sociological forces at work surrounding {{the use of public}} space and the insertion of a very <b>eye-catching</b> but ambiguous image, I began to think there was the potential to create a phenomenon.|$|E
25|$|Haredi {{women wear}} blouses {{covering}} the elbow and collarbone, and skirts {{that cover the}} knees while standing and sitting. The ideal sleeve and skirt length varies by community. Some women try not to follow fashion, while others wear fashionable, but modest, clothing. Haredi women avoid skirts with slits, preferring instead kick-pleats. They also avoid overly <b>eye-catching</b> colors, especially bright red, as well as clothing that is tight. Many will only wear closed-toe shoes, and always wear stockings, the thickness of which varies by community.|$|E
25|$|One of the Frances most {{distinguishable}} {{features were}} her funnels, designed {{not only to}} be <b>eye-catching</b> but functional as well. They were constructed with two wings on the sides, each to lead the exhaust fumes outwards into the ship's slipstream, {{where they would be}} caught by the wind and carried away from the passenger decks below. In addition, each stack had a device that filtered solids from the outlet, returned it into the depths of the ship and then disposed of it into the ocean.|$|E
25|$|After {{some more}} <b>eye-catching</b> {{figures in the}} second team (7–29 against Nottinghamshire II; 8–79 against Kent II) in 1964, Brain finally played {{first-class}} cricket again, facing Cambridge University at Halesowen. He took only one wicket, but was retained for the Championship game which followed (coincidentally this was also against Somerset), and in this match he excelled, taking 6–93 and 4–73 as Worcestershire won by 122 runs. Although {{he dropped out of}} the side thereafter, he returned as a regular from mid-August {{to the end of the}} season, finishing with 31 wickets at 24.19.|$|E
25|$|The most <b>eye-catching</b> {{jewel in}} the third room is the Spoonmaker's Diamond, set in silver and {{surrounded}} in two ranks with 49 cut diamonds. Legend has it that this diamond was bought by a vizier in a bazaar, the owner thinking it was a worthless piece of crystal. Another, perhaps more likely history for the gem places it among the possessions of Tepedeleni Ali Pasha, confiscated by the Sultan after his execution. Still more fanciful and romantic versions link the diamond's origins with Napoleon Bonaparte's mother Letizia Ramolino.|$|E
25|$|The most <b>eye-catching</b> {{decoration}} of the otherwise drab Fachhallenhaus is {{found on the}} point of the gables and consists of carved wooden boards in the shape of (stylised) horses' heads. The boards do serve a constructional purpose in that they protect the edges of the roof from the wind. The horses' heads are attributed to the symbol of the Saxons, the Saxon Steed. Its distribution as decoration on roof ridges is also reflected in the coats of arms of several north Germany towns and villages. In some regions, e. g. in the Hanoverian Wendland, the gable points often have an artistically turned post instead, the so-called Wendenknüppel.|$|E
25|$|Matuschka's first {{poster for}} the group was an {{illustration}} of the Statue of Liberty with the 'no' symbol painted over Lady Liberty's right breast. In 1992, W.H.A.M.! sponsored Matuschka's image Vote for Yourself as a glossy, <b>eye-catching</b> mass media poster. WHAMMERS, as they were known, wheat-pasted this political poster at dozens of breast cancer rallies and demonstrations throughout the greater New York region.Fox Five News was the first mainstream media platform to air W.H.A.M.!'s breast cancer actions—using artwork created by Matuschka {{over a three-year period}} before pink ribbons became the symbol for the disease. A year later Vote for Yourself caught the attention of The New York Times photo editors.|$|E
25|$|The front {{facade of}} the {{residence}} consists of <b>eye-catching</b> peach and white brick masonry and stucco front porch with a main arched balcony crowned by a female face. A second, smaller, arched entrance is the main entryway into the porch and house. Early 1900s ironworks gracefully separate the front porch from the front street sidewalk. The front doors of the house are wooden louvered characteristic of the middle-to-late 19th century. A circular front wall wind hole with decorative molding accentuates the porch; another smaller circular opening decorates high above the archway into the porch. The interior consists of nine rooms, a long, sunny, lateral hallway with multiple wooden veneer shutters, and an external cobble-stone foyer leading to the back courtyard.|$|E
25|$|By {{the end of}} the 1970s, the British coach {{scene was}} {{dominated}} by two similar vehicles - the Plaxton Supreme and the Duple Dominant. In the early 1980s coach services over 30 miles were deregulated by the Transport Act 1980 and there was an increasing attempt by some operators to compete with the railways and airlines for express and intercity travel. As a result, there was a move away from light-weight chassis by Bedford and Ford to heavier-duty chassis from Leyland and Volvo, and an emphasis on improved comfort and amenities. There was also a growing interest from operators in imports from Europe due to their stylish <b>eye-catching</b> designs that attracted passengers. In particular, designs from Neoplan and Van Hool received much attention.|$|E
25|$|In the 2006 season Broad {{took his}} first 5 wicket haul against {{championship}} favourites Surrey and scored his first championship 50 against Derbyshire. His most <b>eye-catching</b> performances {{have been in the}} Twenty20 Cup, where his economy of 4.50 was the second-best of the season of bowlers with more than 15 overs bowled. In the County Championship Broad played twelve of Leicestershire's 13 matches until called up for England, and his 44 wickets at an average of 31.38 meant he led his county both in terms of wickets and bowling average. On 23 August 2007 it was announced that Broad would be leaving Leicestershire {{at the end of the}} season to join Nottinghamshire, after choosing not to renew his contract and to return to his home county.|$|E
25|$|Kothi Khas Bagh is {{a palace}} located at Rampur, about 30km east of Moradabad in Uttar Pradesh. It was the {{erstwhile}} {{residence of the}} Nawabs of Rampur. Set in a 300-acre compound, this huge 200-room European style palace is a unique blend of Islamic architecture and British architecture. It also features personal apartments and offices, music rooms and personal cinema hall of Nawabs. The huge halls, adorned with Burma teak and Belgium glass chandeliers, present a fine specimen of the architecture of a bygone era. There is an Italian marble staircase towards the main bedrooms. The statue of Kalb Ali Khan, the second Nawab of Rampur, is an <b>eye-catching</b> one. Kothi Khas Bagh {{is now in a}} dilapidated state due to the age and neglect.|$|E
25|$|The {{church is}} a {{miniature}} building, which belongs {{to the type of}} the four-apse centric round monuments of the 10th to 13th centuries such as the church of St. Gregory in Sanahin. But as distinct from them the church of Astvatsatsin is round only in its lower part and octahedral in its upper part, with four triangular niches crowned with various conchs. The dome is proportionate to the lower round bulk. The decoration of the church is in stylistic harmony with that of the main temple and the narthex. The profiled girth skirting the building passes across the ends of the niches and the window openings. On the northern side there are <b>eye-catching</b> reliefs of a stork and a snake, and over the southern window a scene showing two beasts locked in a fight.|$|E
25|$|The lead-up to the 2011 Brownlow Medal {{focussed}} {{heavily on}} Carlton. Chris Judd entered {{the night as}} a strong favourite to win; a series of <b>eye-catching</b> performances meant he became the outright favourite early in the season; after Round 20, major betting agency Sportsbet was offering odds shorter than $2 for Judd to win, and decided to pay out early to all punters who had already backed Judd for the win. Murphy also figured prominently in Brownlow markets during the season, fuelled by his career-best season, and very strong polling in other MVP awards, most notably the AFL Coaches Association Player of the Year Award. Bookmakers were offering odds as short as $5.50 in Round 18, when Murphy was second-favourite behind Judd. By {{the end of the}} season, Murphy was fifth-favourite behind Judd, 's Adam Goodes and 's Scott Pendlebury and Dane Swan.|$|E
25|$|In the 14th century entremets {{began to}} involve not just <b>eye-catching</b> {{displays}} of amusing haute cuisine, {{but also more}} prominent and often highly symbolic forms of inedible entertainment. In 1306, the knighting of the son of Edward I included performances of chansons de geste {{in what has been}} assumed {{to be part of the}} entremets. During the course of the 14th century they would often take on the character of theatrical displays, complete with props, actors, singers, mummers and dancers. At a banquet held in 1378 by Charles V of France in honor of Emperor Charles IV, a huge wooden model of the city of Jerusalem was rolled in before the high table. Actors portraying the crusader Godfrey of Bouillon and his knights then sailed into the hall on a miniature ship and reenacted the capture of Jerusalem in 1099.|$|E
25|$|A reverse-contrast type is a {{typeface}} {{in which}} the stress is reversed from the norm: instead of the vertical lines being the same width or thicker than horizontals, which is normal in Latin-alphabet printing, the horizontal lines are the thickest. Reverse-contrast types are rarely used for body text, and are particularly common in display applications such as headings and posters, {{in which the}}ir unusual structure may be particularly <b>eye-catching.</b> First seen in London in 1821, they were particularly common in the mid- to late nineteenth century in American and British printing and have been revived occasionally since then. They effectively become slab serif designs because of the serifs becoming thick, and are often characterised {{as part of that}} genre. In recent times, the reverse-contrast effect has been extended to other kinds of typeface, such as sans-serif designs.|$|E
25|$|Even though Sandridge had {{no formal}} {{training}} or art education, his intuitively unique style and hand painted talent of billboards {{caught the attention}} of The Coca-Cola Company in the early 1970s. Working for an outdoor sign company, Sandridge painted a realistically, <b>eye-catching</b> image of Niagara Falls featuring the iconic Coca-Cola bottle and logo design on a 14ft x 48ft billboard. So popular was the sight that the billboard won an award, prompting representatives from The Coca-Cola Company to drive from Atlanta, Georgia, to Gadsden, Alabama, to preview Sandridge's artwork. Feeling proud of the attention his craftsmanship had attracted, Sandridge recognized that the weight of the adverse racial overtones of the time would not allow him the recognition he deserved. He was not even given a formal introduction to the men who were captivated by his work. But not one to sit idly by and accept racism or tolerate blatant disrespect towards his work ethic and creative abilities, he soon left that company.|$|E
25|$|In August 2009 {{the club}} {{announced}} plans for wholesale development of the stadium and regeneration throughout the area. The club declared that the city of Plymouth would be submitting an application to the Football Association (the FA) to be a host venue for England's 2018 FIFA World Cup Bid. The <b>eye-catching</b> plans were {{released to the public}} on 14 December 2009, two days before the FA would announce which candidates they had selected for the bid. The plans, designed by Populous, include developing the stadium into a 46,000 capacity all-seater area, with a 5,000-seat indoor facility and hotel built into the complex, at a cost of at least £50m. The build would be done in three stages. The First Phase, a new Mayflower Stand, will become a reality regardless of the bid, increasing the capacity to 27,000. The Second Phase, an additional 8,000 seats, and the Third Phase, an additional 11,000 seats, would be completed by the 2014–15 season should Plymouth's application and England's bid be successful, giving the stadium a capacity of 46,000 all-seated by this stage.|$|E
25|$|The Miu Fat Buddhist Monastery {{was first}} {{constructed}} in 1950. Over {{the following two}} decades came {{the construction of the}} 3-storey Ten Thousand Buddhas Hall at a cost of $60 million. It took six years to complete, with its consecration ceremony held in May 1980. The Mahavira Hall, located on the top storey, has a floor height of about 20 metres. In the middle of the Hall, there are three gold-plated statues of the Buddha Sakyamuni, each of them is about 5-metre tall. Its interior walls are adorned with over 10 thousands of Buddha reliefs and a number of murals featuring a blend of Sino-Thai cultures, which are so magnificent and <b>eye-catching.</b> Higher up in the Hall are the Library of Buddhist Scriptures and the Attic of the Jade Buddha. On each side of the main entrance of the Hall is a 20-metre column carved with a dazzling lifelike giant gold-scaled dragon, making the building prominently imposing. The Monastery also has a kitchen serving mouthwatering vegetarian food for visitors.|$|E
25|$|All {{ambulances}} are to {{be equipped}} with highly reflective green and yellow 'checkerboard' markings (the English term is 'Battenburg' pattern), of specified proportions, running {{the entire length of}} the vehicle. The intent of this measure was to provide specific 'visual identities' for emergency vehicles, by reserving this pattern for ambulances, blue and yellow Battenburg for police cars, and red and yellow Battenburg for fire service vehicles. In addition, all lettering on the vehicle is required to be highly reflective, in order to boost vehicle visibility in all conditions. The colour combination selected was chosen for specific reasons. Under night time conditions, green is among the most visible (exceeded only by blue) of colours, creating high visibility (and safety) for ambulance vehicles. Unfortunately, for many of those who suffer from colour-blindness, neither green nor red is visible, washing out to shades of grey or dark yellow. In fact, almost 99 percent of all colour vision deficiency involves some form of red-green colour blindness, and includes an estimated 7-10 percent of all males, depending on location. However, even for these individuals, the colour yellow is always visible (see diagram). The resulting pattern is both high visibility and <b>eye-catching</b> for the average person, provides improved night time visibility for most, and provides a combination which is identifiable, at least in part, by the majority of the population.|$|E
