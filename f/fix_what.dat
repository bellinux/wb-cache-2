Terasawa himself participated on weekly meetings {{to discuss the}} screenplays, giving his suggestions to the writers to <b>fix</b> <b>what</b> he told was wrong or rewriting himself the screenplay. The episodes were released in eight DVDs and a DVD box set on October 25, 2000 by Digital Site in Japan. The series was released in Northern America by Nozomi Entertainment in two parts; the first was released on March 4, 2014, and the second one is available since May 6, 2014. In November 2015, the series {{was added to the}} Crunchyroll streaming service to be broadcast in the United States and Canada with English substitles.|$|E

Gilbert also decided to <b>fix</b> <b>what</b> he felt the previous Roger Moore films were doing wrong, which was writing the Bond character too much the way Sean Connery played him, and instead portray Bond closer to the books— [...] "very English, very smooth, good sense of humour". Broccoli asked Wood to create a villain with metal teeth, Jaws, inspired by a brace-wearing henchman named Horror in Fleming's novel.|$|E
500|$|The new {{script was}} then pitched to the BBC. The pitch tape they made {{was based on}} the same pitch used by The Muppet Show. This was done as a tribute to it, with Miller arguing that when The Muppet Show did it, [...] "it just must have just knocked the socks off the people who saw it, because it's like nothing you've ever seen before, and we thought: 'Why <b>fix</b> <b>what</b> ain't broke, so we did our own very British version of that." [...] The {{producers}} liked it but did not fully understand what the show was about. Miller, Brown and a third writer, Daniel Peak began to write scripts over a period of four years. A pilot was eventually filmed and the BBC commissioned a full series, targeted at adults. Despite the adult nature, Miller did not want to make the show too crude. Eight episodes were filmed so as to spread the cost of making the series over each episode.|$|E

Disney Animation Building, {{in order}} to <b>fix</b> <b>what</b> Catmull had called its [...] "dungeon-like" [...] interior. For example, the interior was so cramped {{that it could not}} easily accommodate [...] "town hall" [...] meetings with all employees in attendance. [...] Disney did not disclose the renovation's cost, but Lasseter revealed that [...] "he whole center of the second floor will have an atrium that will go up two stories we want to make this building so beautiful that it's worthy of the artistic talent that's there." [...] In addition, it was revealed that the large sorcerer's hat would become the building's main entrance. Lasseter stated, [...] "There will be a gorgeous stairway that goes up into the hat, it's a really great symbol like you're entering the building through the magic of Mickey Mouse's hat." [...] Due to the renovation, the studio's employees were temporarily moved from Burbank into the closest available Disney-controlled studio space– the DisneyToon Studios building in the industrial park in Glendale and the old Imagineering warehouse in North Hollywood under the western approach to Bob Hope Airport (the Tujunga Building). Director Don Hall analogized the studio's relocation to the end of The Empire Strikes Back, where [...] "you know they're going to get back together." [...] The renovation was completed in October 2016.|$|E
500|$|Originally modeled in Max Payne {{after the}} game's writer Sam Lake, Max's {{appearance}} was remodeled after professional actor Timothy Gibbs for Max Payne 2; James McCaffrey returned {{as the voice}} of Max. The game's plot was written by Lake, who decided to write it as a film noir love story, as he felt that it suited Max's persona the best. Lake hoped that the story would break new ground, noting, [...] "At least it's a step into the right direction. I'd like nothing better than to see new and unexpected subject matters to find their way to games and stories told in games." [...] Lake remarked that basic, archetypal film noir elements found in many classics of the genre [...] "can go a long way" [...] when telling a story, and gave examples that included a hostile, crime-ridden city; a story that takes place late at night with heavy rain; and a cynical, hard-boiled detective down on his luck. Lake considered writing a sequel to Max Payne an [...] "art of [...] own". Since the setting and characters were already established, Lake decided that the primary goal of the sequel was [...] "to keep what's good and <b>fix</b> <b>what</b> was not so good", and to take the story in surprising directions. The screenplay for the sequel ended up being three times longer than the one for Max Payne. Lake predicted that the more complex story would add to the game's replay value.|$|E

[...] Dom Wyatt of Dead Press! suggested that the band stick to the mould of a metalcore band with the adage [...] "don’t <b>fix</b> <b>what</b> isn’t broken."

Explaining that being from the North of England; the people that the band know [...] "won't take crap" [...] while also stating that the title means that it doesn't matter where you're from (geographically) you can still [...] "get involved" [...] with the band's music. Guitarist Welsh added that the title reflects the UK underground scene and how people will go to see a local band who are their friends and leave before seeing other bands– saying that [...] "that's not the way it should be." [...] In an interview in 2011, Welsh explained that the lyrics on [...] "My Conscience, Your Freedom" [...] are about the government– specifically noting on the line [...] "our coins can pay for the crime." [...] When questioned about the single [...] "Be(lie)ve", Welsh said that it was about the government and religion. Taylor explained further; [...] "we wrote about how people follow shit and don't really think about what they're following".|$|E

Unfortunately {{on the day}} the renewal was announced, two of the show's executive producers, Marco Pennette and James Hayman, were let go. The departure of Pennette and Hayman added to the constant off-camera turnovers on the series, including the exiting or firing of five writers. In a Q from TV Guide, Michael Ausiello criticized the decision, saying [...] "that someone saw fit to <b>fix</b> <b>what</b> wasn't broken" [...] and praised the two men for writing several of the show's best episodes. These turn of events may have also contributed to Rebecca Romijn's decision to no longer be a full-time regular on the series in the third season, citing the move by new writers to make changes in the direction of several characters, especially Romijn's role as Alexis.|$|E

60|$|The {{contemporary}} anti-Socialist moralist and {{the social}} satirist would appeal to the Owner's sense of duty; he would declare in a platitudinous tone that property had its duties {{as well as its}} rights, and so forth. The Socialist, however, looks a little deeper, and puts the thing differently. He brings both rights and duties to a keener scrutiny. What underlies all these social disorders, he alleges, is one simple thing, a misconception of property; an unreasonable exaggeration, an accumulated, inherited exaggeration, of the idea of property. He says the idea of private property, which is just and reasonable in relation to intimate personal things, to clothes, appliances, books, one's home or apartments, the garden one loves or the horse one rides, has become unreasonably exaggerated until it obsesses the world; that the freedom we have given men to claim and own and hold the land upon which we must live, the fuel we burn, the supplies of food and metal we require, the railways and ships upon which our business goes, and to <b>fix</b> <b>what</b> prices they like to exact for all these services, leads to the impoverishment and practical enslavement of the mass of mankind.|$|E
