5|$|In phylogenetic taxonomy, {{the genus}} Triceratops {{has been used}} as a {{reference}} point <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>definition</b> <b>of</b> Dinosauria; dinosaurs have been designated as all descendants of the most recent common ancestor of Triceratops and Neornithes (i.e. modern birds). Furthermore, the bird-hipped dinosaurs, Ornithischia, have all been designated dinosaurs with a more recent common ancestor to Triceratops than modern birds.|$|E
5|$|Making an {{exception}} for zero <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>definition</b> <b>of</b> evenness forces one to make such exceptions in the rules for even numbers. From another perspective, taking the rules obeyed by positive even numbers and requiring that they continue to hold for integers forces the usual definition and the evenness of zero.|$|E
5|$|Some large {{satellites}} are {{of similar}} size or {{larger than the}} planet Mercury, e.g. Jupiter's Galilean moons and Titan. Alan Stern has argued that location should not matter and that only geophysical attributes {{should be taken into}} account <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>definition</b> <b>of</b> a planet, and proposes the term satellite planet for a planet-sized satellite. Likewise, dwarf planets in the asteroid belt and Kuiper belt should be considered planets according to Stern.|$|E

5|$|With {{the advent}} of phylogenetic {{taxonomy}} in vertebrate paleontology, Tyrannosauridae has been given several explicit definitions. The original was produced by Paul Sereno in 1998, and included all tyrannosauroids closer to Tyrannosaurus than to either Alectrosaurus, Aublysodon or Nanotyrannus. However, Nanotyrannus is often {{considered to be a}} juvenile Tyrannosaurus rex, while Aublysodon is usually regarded as a nomen dubium unsuitable for use <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>definition</b> <b>of</b> a clade. Definitions since then have been based on more well-established genera.|$|E
5|$|Much of the {{variation}} lies <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>definition</b> <b>of</b> species, and whether closely related taxa are considered separate species or subspecies. Thus, a very wide view of each species, such as Webb's results in few species, while a very narrow view {{such as that of}} Fernandes results in a larger number. Another factor is the status of hybrids, given natural hybridisation, with a distinction between 'ancient hybrids' and 'recent hybrids'. The term 'ancient hybrid' refers to hybrids found growing over a large area, and therefore now considered as separate species, while 'recent hybrid' refers to solitary plants found amongst their parents, with a more restricted range.|$|E

40|$|Stress-energies for Fermi {{fields are}} derived from the {{principle}} of general covariance. This is done by developing a notion of Lie derivatives of spinors along arbitrary vector fields. A substantial theory of such derivatives was first introduced by Kosmann; here I show how an apparent conflict <b>in</b> <b>the</b> literature on {{this is due to}} a difference <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>definitions</b> <b>of</b> spinors, and that tracking the Lie derivative of the Infeld-van der Waerden symbol, as well as the spinor fields under consideration, gives a fuller picture of the geometry and leads to the Fermion stress-energy. <b>The</b> differences <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>definitions</b> <b>of</b> spinors do not affect the results here, but could matter in certain quantum-gravity programs and for spinor transformations under discrete symmetries.
