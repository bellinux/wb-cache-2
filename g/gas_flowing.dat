Less volatile aerosols of Ba, Ce, La, Sr, and other fission products are formed during this phase and introduced into the containment building {{at a time when}} most of the early aerosols are already deposited.

25|$|Natural gas {{processing}} changes the commodity in two critical ways. First, it extracts valuable by-products; second, it renders natural gas {{fit to be}} transported to a point for commercial sale and consumption. Through the use of evolving technology, the {{gas processing}} industry of each era extracts higher percentages of {{a wider range of}} hydrocarbons and other commercial by-products than its predecessors. It also removes ever-higher percentages of dangerous and other unwanted impurities. Steady growth has made natural gas a major industry, with 180 cubic kilometres of <b>gas</b> <b>flowing</b> from Canadian fields to market, every year.|$|E
40|$|Self-aligning {{soldering}} {{technology is}} being developed for low cost, passive, precision optical alignments. To avoid contamination problems, the solder reflow process must use reacting or inert gas instead of chemical flux materials. Since the accuracy of these optical alignments should reach the range of a few micrometers (μm), the <b>gas</b> <b>flow</b> may affect the aligning process. Therefore, {{the effects of the}} <b>gas</b> <b>flow</b> on the self-aligning process must be understood. The experiments described show that <b>gas</b> <b>flow</b> effects do exist. The top plate, 8. 4 mm × 8. 4 mm, can be moved by the <b>gas</b> <b>flow</b> by as much as 4. 5 μm and 7. 8 μm at <b>gas</b> <b>flow</b> rates of 2. 5 L/min and 5. 0 L/min, respectively. The numerical analysis in this study models the <b>gas</b> <b>flow</b> effects {{for a wide range of}} chip sizes, solder geometry, and <b>gas</b> <b>flow</b> direction. In the numerical analysis, fluid computation and solder force calculation are conducted to study the <b>gas</b> <b>flow</b> effects on chip displacement that is the distance away from the well aligned position along the <b>gas</b> <b>flow</b> direction. The results show that the <b>gas</b> <b>flow</b> effects are related to many factors including chip size, <b>gas</b> <b>flow</b> rate, solder height, and flow direction. For a one-dimensional laser array, these effects are negligible because the chip size is very small. However, for a chip larger than 5 mm × 5 mm, the effects should be controlled for micron-level precision alignment...|$|R
30|$|It {{is worth}} {{mentioning}} that the steady-state natural <b>gas</b> <b>flow</b> model (21)–(22) would neglect built-in storage capabilities of pipelines (i.e., line pack) and slow travelling speeds of natural <b>gas</b> <b>flows,</b> {{as compared to}} the transient <b>gas</b> <b>flow</b> model [6].

25|$|Natural <b>gas</b> <b>flowing</b> in the {{distribution}} lines and at the natural gas well head are often used to power natural gas powered engines. These engines rotate compressors to facilitate the natural gas transmission. These compressors are required in the mid-stream line to pressurize and to re-pressurize the natural gas in the transmission line as the gas travels. The natural gas transmission lines extend to the natural gas processing plant or unit which removes the higher molecular weighted natural gas hydrocarbons to produce a British thermal unit (BTU) value between 950 and 1050BTUs. The processed natural gas may then be used for residential, commercial and industrial uses.|$|E
25|$|The Syrian Government {{has bought}} oil {{directly}} from ISIL, and the Syrian government and ISIL jointly run a HESCO gas plant in Tabqah. The facility supplies electricity to government-held areas, and government-run power plants supply ISIL-held areas. The Syrian government has tactically avoided ISIL forces {{in order to}} weaken opposition such as the Free Syrian Army (FSA), and according to United States Secretary of State John Kerry the Syrian government has purposely ceded territory to ISIL. An IHS Jane's Terrorism and Insurgency Center database analysis confirmed that only 6% of Syrian government forces attacks were targeted at ISIL from January to November 2014, while {{in the same period}} only 13% of all ISIL attacks targeted government forces. The National Coalition for Syrian Revolutionary and Opposition Forces has stated that the Syrian government has operatives inside ISIL, as has the leadership of Ahrar ash-Sham. A report on 25 June 2015 said that ISIL kept <b>gas</b> <b>flowing</b> to Assad regime-controlled power stations. Furthermore, ISIL allowed grain to pass from the Kurdish-held north-east to regime controlled areas at the cost of a 25% levy.|$|E
2500|$|Actual {{cubic foot}} per minute (ACFM) is {{the volume of}} <b>gas</b> <b>flowing</b> {{anywhere}} in a system, independent of its temperature and pressure. If the system were moving a gas at exactly the [...] "standard" [...] condition, then ACFM would equal SCFM. Unfortunately, this usually is not the case as the most important change between these two definitions is the pressure. To move a gas, a positive pressure or a vacuum must be created. When positive pressure is applied to a standard cubic foot of gas, it is compressed. When a vacuum is applied to a standard cubic foot of gas, it expands. The volume of gas after it is pressurized or rarefied is referred to as its [...] "actual" [...] volume.|$|E

40|$|The {{permeability}} of coal is {{a critical}} parameter in estimating the performance of coal reservoirs. Darcy’s law describes the flow pattern that the permeability has a linear relationship with the flow velocity. However, the stress induced deformation and damage can significantly influence the <b>gas</b> <b>flow</b> pattern and permeability of coal. Coals from Songzao coalfield in Chongqing, southwest China were collected for the study. The <b>gas</b> <b>flow</b> velocities under different injection gas pressures and effective stresses in the intact coal and damaged coal were tested using helium, incorporating the role of <b>gas</b> <b>flow</b> pattern on the permeability of coal. The relationships between the flow velocity and square of gas pressure gradient were discussed, which can help us to investigate the transformation conditions of <b>gas</b> linear <b>flow</b> and <b>gas</b> nonlinear <b>flow</b> in the coal. The {{results showed that the}} <b>gas</b> <b>flow</b> in the intact coal existed pseudo-initial flow rate under low effective stress.
