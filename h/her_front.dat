5|$|In New Zealand, Mouton {{continued}} her good performances and traded the lead with Mikkola, Röhrl and Björn Waldegård. Soon after regaining {{the lead on}} stage twelve, she retired with a broken oil pump. After seven rounds, Mouton was second in the championship, 32 points behind Röhrl and 12 ahead of Eklund. The Rally of Brazil was marred by the fatal accident of Brazilian driver Thomas Fuchs, and featured chaotic conditions as parts of the course were not successfully closed for competition. Although only five teams {{made it to the}} finish, Mouton improved her title hopes by winning her duel with Röhrl after the German lost a wheel on the last day. At the 1000 Lakes, she clocked in the eighth fastest time for the famous Ouninpohja stage and placed seventh after the first day. On the following leg, Mouton drove too fast into a jump and damaged her Quattro while landing. After the next jump, <b>her</b> <b>front</b> wheels locked up and she rolled the car. Mouton was next locked in a tight battle for the win in Sanremo. Although she recorded nine stage wins and Audi took a one-two, she had to settle for fourth behind Röhrl.|$|E
5|$|The female {{may begin}} feeding by biting off the male's head (as {{they do with}} regular prey), and if mating has begun, the male's {{movements}} may become even more vigorous in its delivery of sperm. Early researchers thought that because copulatory movement is controlled by a ganglion in the abdomen, not the head, removal of the male's head was a reproductive strategy by females to enhance fertilization while obtaining sustenance. Later, this behavior {{appeared to be an}} artifact of intrusive laboratory observation. Whether the behavior is natural in the field or also the result of distractions caused by the human observer remains controversial. Mantises are highly visual organisms and notice any disturbance in the laboratory or field, such as bright lights or moving scientists. Chinese mantises that had been fed ad libitum (so that they were not hungry) actually displayed elaborate courtship behavior when left undisturbed. The male engages the female in a courtship dance, to change her interest from feeding to mating. Under such circumstances, the female has been known to respond with a defensive deimatic display by flashing the colored eyespots on the inside of <b>her</b> <b>front</b> legs.|$|E
5|$|Two {{practice}} sessions were {{held on the}} Friday before the race: each lasted for an hour. A third session, also an hour long, {{took place on the}} Saturday morning prior to qualifying. Franchitti was fastest in the first practice session with a time of one minute and 3.0885 seconds; Dixon was second and Power third. Hélio Castroneves was fourth-fastest, ahead of Justin Wilson and Paul Tracy. Ryan Briscoe, Ryan Hunter-Reay, E. J. Viso and Takuma Sato rounded out the session's top-ten drivers. The session was stopped twice: firstly for Milka Duno who lost control of her car and went into the turn ten tire barrier damaging <b>her</b> <b>front</b> wing, and then Bertrand Baguette spun after hitting a chicane kerb which caused to him to drive through an advertising billboard. In the second practice session, Power set the fastest time of the day with a lap of one minute and 1.6689 seconds, with his teammates Briscoe in second and Castroneves third. Franchitti recorded the fourth-quickest time; Sato was fifth and Dixon sixth. Wilson, Viso, Tracy and Tony Kanaan followed in the top ten. Three caution flags came out; Baugette crashed, Duno stalled after she spun and Tomas Scheckter slid into a tire barrier.|$|E

5|$|Becky tells Steve {{that she}} is {{pregnant}} and he later discovers that Becky has already told Claire and Steve tells his mother, Liz. Unfortunately Becky miscarries twice, although she was unaware of her 2nd pregnancy, and medical tests reveal an abnormality of the womb, meaning she is unable to carry a child full-term, making Becky decide {{that she wants to}} adopt. During the process, Steve needs a reference from Amy's mother, Tracy Barlow (Kate Ford), who promptly uses it to cause trouble, making Becky threaten, in return, that Tracy will never see Amy again. Unfortunately Becky and Steve are refused the right to adopt because her estranged half-sister Kylie gave a bad reference and the fact that Social Services feel that it is too soon after her miscarriages. She confronts Kylie, but the sisters eventually reconcile and Becky helps Kylie reclaim custody of her son, Max. Becky becomes very attached to Max, whilst Kylie becomes more irresponsible. Kylie announces plans to move to Cyprus with her new boyfriend and Becky begs her to reconsider, so Kylie offers to sell Max to her and Steve for £20,000, which they agree to. On the night of the tram crash, Kylie returns and demands more money, so Becky steals £5,000 from the ruins of Dev Alahan's (Jimmi Harkishin) corner shop, to pay Kylie off. Tracy is released from prison and the two start feuding again, particularly after Tracy discovers Max's sale and agrees to keep quiet in exchange for Amy. When Tracy is brutally attacked, Becky is arrested for the incident until Claire admits she was responsible but Becky admits looting Dev's shop, Sunita Alahan (Shobna Gulati) is furious but does not report her. When Liz finds out she makes life hard for Becky. Becky gets drunk and attacks Kylie and forces Liz out of the pub. Jim McDonald (Charles Lawson) offers to buy the Rovers— with the money Becky and Steve decide {{to start a new life}} abroad and steal Amy. Jim's attempts to rob a bank fail and they are forced to cancel their plans. Steve calls Social Services to check on Max and they take him into care. Becky believes Tracy made the call and smashes <b>her</b> <b>front</b> room up with a sledge-hammer. Before she can hit Tracy, Steve confesses. Becky walks out on Steve and goes off the rails once more.|$|E
5|$|Sophie {{was seen}} {{much more in}} The Next Generation. She was the prime {{babysitter}} and target for roving males, particularly Wilson from the Commandos. In an early episode, Sophie climbed a tree in search of caterpillars, but slipped and fell, injuring one of <b>her</b> <b>front</b> paws. The Whiskers moved on, potentially abandoning Sophie, but the injured female managed to limp after them and quickly recovered. Shortly afterwards, Sophie was evicted, for mating with Wilson, by Rocket Dog, who was also pregnant by Wilson. Rocket Dog gave birth to two pups and allowed Sophie to rejoin the group once she aborted her litter. Sophie babysat the two pups, Nugget and Beaker, along with Simon. The babysitters {{decided to take the}} pups foraging, but they ran into the Aztecs and headed for bolt hole. Inside, Simon found a puff adder, but the Whiskers' babysitters couldn't escape due to the Aztecs, they were viciously blocking the entrance. Eventually, the rain forced the Aztecs to retreat, but with it being so late, the babysitters couldn't return to the main burrow. The next day, Sophie reunited the pups with the Whiskers, but Simon had died from a snake bite. Later on in the series, Sophie was evicted by pregnant subordinate female, Wiley Kat. But before long, Wiley Kat was also kicked out by Rocket Dog. In spite of what Wiley Kat had done to her, Sophie stayed with her, and the pair were quickly joined by Wilson and Philippe. During their time together the small family encountered a Genet and Sophie mated with Wilson. But the rovers eventually left. After that, Wiley Kat and her unborn litter simply disappeared, but pregnant Sophie managed to rejoin the Whiskers. She gave birth to three pups named Flashman, Pickle and Chips, and spent her time babysitting Juno. When Rocket Dog was bitten by a Cape cobra, Sophie led the Whiskers to a new burrow, where Rocket Dog eventually met up with them and slowly recovered from her bite. In this season, Sophie was played by Flower's daughter Ella because her other counterparts, Tina Sparkle and Finn were evicted. After Rocket Dog's Death, she became the dominant female of the Whiskers and still retains that position today.|$|E

25|$|Egg-laying {{is done by}} {{bringing}} the abdomen close to the mouthparts where the pap is being held. The female holds <b>her</b> <b>front</b> legs up and open and appears {{to use them to}} touch her abdomen. Her antennae are completely still and her wings are closed during the operation. Then her abdomen begins to vibrate, and her sting is turned inside and out and folded backwards. During this process, the egg is expelled and placed directly on the pap that the female is holding in her mouth. She does not touch it with her legs at all. Then her abdomen relaxes and the female places the egg inside the cell. The average length of the eggs laid by L. vechti is 1.36mm, and ovarian eggs are considered ready to be laid once they reach 1.16mm.|$|E
25|$|During {{the main}} season of its activity, May through September, the {{entrance}} to the nesting sites of P. gibbosus can be characterized by the scattered heaps of sand or soil around their supporting structure, usually bricks or tree roots. The sand heaps are very low and spread out. In building these sand heaps, females can be observed backing out of the burrow with moist sand or soil that is spread around into the heaps using jerks of <b>her</b> <b>front</b> legs. While burrowing, P. gibbosus stands on its hind legs. In order to dig the actual burrow, P. gibbosus uses its tarsi and mandibles to dig a shaft that is at least two feet in length. The shaft culminates in an oval shaped cell in which eggs are provisioned. Other oval shaped cells line the shaft which are smaller in size and contain the skeletons of other bees that were killed and fed to the larvae as nutrients.|$|E
