5|$|To make {{brominated}} polymers and plastics, bromine-containing compounds can {{be incorporated}} into the polymer during polymerisation. One method is to include a relatively small amount of brominated monomer during the polymerisation process. For example, vinyl bromide can be used in the production of polyethylene, polyvinylchloride or polypropylene. Specific highly brominated molecules can also be added that participate in the polymerisation process For example, tetrabromobisphenol A can be added to polyesters or <b>epoxy</b> <b>resins,</b> where it becomes part of the polymer. Epoxys used in printed circuit boards are normally made from such flame retardant resins, indicated by the FR in the abbreviation of the products (FR-4 and FR-2). In some cases the bromine containing compound may be added after polymerisation. For example, decabromodiphenyl ether can be added to the final polymers.|$|E
25|$|BPA is {{employed}} {{to make certain}} plastics and <b>epoxy</b> <b>resins.</b> BPA-based plastic is clear and tough, and is made {{into a variety of}} common consumer goods, such as water bottles, sports equipment, CDs, and DVDs. <b>Epoxy</b> <b>resins</b> containing BPA are used to line water pipes, as coatings on the inside of many food and beverage cans and in making thermal paper such as that used in sales receipts.

25|$|Rubber cements are {{solutions}} {{of synthetic}} or natural rubber products in solvents, {{with or without}} resins and gums. Vulcanizers, accelerators, and stabilizers are considered problematic {{due to the nature}} of their compounds. One example is the additive of sulfur which is harmful to some types of material, including silver, because it can cause discoloration. Rubber adhesives can be confused with <b>epoxy</b> <b>resins</b> due to their similar appearance. However, unlike <b>epoxy</b> <b>resins,</b> rubber adhesives will stretch when pulled. Nitromors or Polystrippa solvent brands are used as a solvent but warm water can also loosen the bond.|$|E

25|$|Red {{phosphorus}} {{can be used}} as a {{very effective}} flame retardant, especially in thermoplastics (e.g. polyamide) and thermosets (e.g. <b>epoxy</b> <b>resins</b> or polyurethanes). The flame retarding effect is based on the formation of polyphosphoric acid. Together with the organic polymer material, this acid creates a char which prevents the propagation of the flames. The safety risks associated with phosphine generation and friction sensitivity of red phosphorus can be effectively reduced by stabilization and micro-encapsulation. For easier handling, red phosphorus is often used in form of dispersions or masterbatches in various carrier systems.|$|E

40|$|Our {{previous}} report proposed a gradual adhesion {{model for the}} interface of <b>epoxy</b> <b>resin</b> used as an electric insulator. The model {{can deal with the}} flow and gelling of <b>epoxy</b> <b>resin</b> but it cannot deal with the fracture of the interface. In order to solve the fracture problem, two new fracture models are proposed for the <b>epoxy</b> <b>resin</b> interface. 1) One model proposes that partial adhesion remains after the fracture of the interface of <b>epoxy</b> <b>resin</b> occurs. The calculated strain change using this model does not give good agreement with experimental values. 2) Another model proposes that partial adhesion remains after the shrinkage strain from the curing reaction is released by the fracture of the interface. The calculated strain change from this model gives good agreement with experimental values. These results indicate that the weak adhesion region breaks away when the fracture of the <b>epoxy</b> <b>resin</b> interface occurs. The temperature distribution of the <b>epoxy</b> <b>resin</b> during the curing reaction does not change with the fracture of the interface.
