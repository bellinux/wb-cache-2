5|$|Unfortunately, as I tell {{my white}} friends, we as black people, we're never <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>{{successful}},</b> {{not because of}} you white people, but because of other black people. When you're black, {{you have to deal}} with so much crap in your life from other black people. It's a dirty, dark secret; I'm glad it's coming out. One of the reasons we're never <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>successful</b> as a whole, because of other black people. And for some reason we are brainwashed to think, if you're not a thug or an idiot, you're not black enough. If you go to school, make good grades, speak intelligent, and don't break the law, you're not a good black person. And it's a dirty, dark secret. There are a lot of black people who are unintelligent, who don't have success. It's best to knock a successful black person down because they're intelligent, they speak well, they do well in school, and they're successful... We're the only ethnic group who say, 'Hey, if you go to jail, it gives you street cred.' It's just typical BS that goes on when you're black, man.|$|E
