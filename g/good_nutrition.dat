25|$|At {{the same}} time, Seacliff was {{groundbreaking}} {{in some parts}} of its treatment programme, with noted medical reformer Truby King appointed Medical Superintendent in 1889, a position he held for 30 years. Patients were 'prescribed' fresh air, exercise, <b>good</b> <b>nutrition</b> and productive work (for example, in on-site laundries, gardens, and a forge) as part of their therapeutic regime. King is credited as having turned what was essentially conceived as a prison into an efficient working farm. Another of King's innovations, was his implementation of small dormitories housed in buildings adjacent to the larger asylum. This style of accommodation has been considered the forerunner to the villa system later adopted by all mental health institutions in New Zealand.|$|E

25|$|Similar to {{the ratio}} of female to male workers {{in the labor force}} is the {{percentage}} of the actual labor force composed of women. This differs from the labor force participation rate of women because it shows female workers {{as a percentage of the}} total number of workers in the economy as opposed to the percentage of the population of women that are involved in the formal economy. A large female labor force participation rate does not necessarily correlate to a substantial percentage of females in the labor force. However, a high female labor force participation rate demonstrates high economic participation by women in a country regardless of the size of the labor market itself that these women compose. Demographics, particularly birth rates, and human capital formation through education, <b>good</b> <b>nutrition,</b> and access to infrastructure and institutions may play a role in the discrepancies between these indicators.|$|E
40|$|Introduction: Rabies, {{causing an}} acute viral encephalitis, is still endemic in {{developing}} countries within Africa and Asia. Canine rabies in dogs and humans can be controlled through the mass vaccination of dogs against the virus based {{on the concept of}} herd immunity. Herd immunity is influenced by demographic factors. The aim of this research was to investigate causes of mortality in puppies from birth up to 120 days old in an owned, free-roaming dog population in South Africa; and to estimate the degree of achievable mortality rate reduction in this population by subdividing the mortality causes into avoidable and unavoidable. Results: A total number of 105 puppies were born alive. From this number 36 puppies got lost, 36 puppies died and 33 puppies were still alive. Mortality causes resulting from the verbal autopsy questionnaires were subdivided into accidental, starvation, infection or euthanasia. Conclusion: By assuming that avoidable mortality causes are starvation, infection and euthanasia, 81 % (95 % CI: 67. 8 %, 94. 8 %) of the total puppy mortality could have been prevented by providing <b>good</b> animal <b>nutrition</b> and veterinary care. The remaining 19 % consisted of accidents. We concluded that puppy mortality could be reduced by 81 % by providing <b>good</b> animal <b>nutrition</b> and veterinary care...|$|R

500|$|Many breeders take {{a variety}} of {{preventive}} measures to ward off problems. The first is to ensure all sheep are healthy when purchased. Many buyers avoid outlets known to be clearing houses for animals culled from healthy flocks as either sick or simply inferior. This can also mean maintaining a closed flock, and quarantining new sheep for a month. Two fundamental preventive programs are maintaining <b>good</b> <b>nutrition</b> and reducing stress in the sheep. Restraint, isolation, loud noises, novel situations, pain, heat, extreme cold, fatigue and other stressors can lead to secretion of cortisol, a stress hormone, in amounts that may indicate welfare problems. [...] Excessive stress can compromise the immune system. [...] "Shipping fever" [...] (pneumonic mannheimiosis, formerly called pasteurellosis) is a disease of particular concern, that can occur {{as a result of}} stress, notably during transport and (or) handling. [...] Pain, fear and several other stressors can cause secretion of epinephrine (adrenaline). [...] Considerable epinephrine secretion in the final days before slaughter can adversely affect meat quality (by causing glycogenolysis, removing the substrate for normal post-slaughter acidification of meat) and result in meat becoming more susceptible to colonization by spoilage bacteria. [...] Because of such issues, low-stress handling is essential in sheep management. [...] Avoiding poisoning is also important; common poisons are pesticide sprays, inorganic fertilizer, motor oil, as well as radiator coolant containing ethylene glycol.|$|E

5000|$|... ==Host {{susceptibility}}== Host susceptibility {{contributes to}} virulence. Once transmission occurs, the pathogen must establish an infection to continue. The more competent the host immune system, the less chance {{there is for}} the parasite to survive. It may require multiple transmission events to find a suitably vulnerable host. During this time, the invader is dependent upon the survival of its current host. For this reason virulence thrives in a community with prevalent immune dysfunction and poor nutrition. Virulence weakens in a healthy population and as hosts acquire resistance. <b>Good</b> hygiene, <b>nutrition</b> and sanitation are all effective strategies against virulence.|$|R
