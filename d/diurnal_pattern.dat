5|$|Mycena polygramma, {{commonly}} known as the grooved bonnet, is a species of mushroom in the Mycenaceae family. The inedible fruit bodies are small, pale gray-brown mushrooms with broadly conical caps, pinkish gills. They are found in small troops on stumps and branches of deciduous and occasionally coniferous trees. The mushroom is found in Asia, Europe, and North America, where it is typically found on twigs or buried wood, carrying out its role in the forest ecosystem by decomposing organic matter, recycling nutrients, and forming humus in the soil. M.polygramma contains two uncommon hydroxy fatty acids and is also a bioluminescent fungus whose intensity of light emission follows a <b>diurnal</b> <b>pattern.</b>|$|E

500|$|Emus forage in a <b>diurnal</b> <b>pattern</b> and eat {{a variety}} of native and {{introduced}} plant species. The diet depends on seasonal availability with such plants as Acacia, Casuarina and grasses being favoured. They also eat insects and other arthropods, including grasshoppers and crickets, beetles, cockroaches, ladybirds, bogong and cotton-boll moth larvae, ants, spiders and millipedes. This provides {{a large part of}} their protein requirements. In Western Australia, food preferences have been observed in travelling emus; they eat seeds from Acacia aneura until the rains arrive, after which they move on to fresh grass shoots and caterpillars; in winter they feed on the leaves and pods of Cassia and in spring, they consume grasshoppers and the fruit of Santalum acuminatum, a sort of quandong. They are also known to feed on wheat, and any fruit or other crops that they can access, easily climbing over high fences if necessary. Emus serve as an important agent for the dispersal of large viable seeds, which contributes to floral biodiversity. One undesirable effect of this occurred in Queensland {{in the early twentieth century}} when emus fed on the fruit of prickly pears in the outback. They defecated the seeds in various places as they moved around, and this led to a series of campaigns to hunt emus and prevent the seeds of the invasive cactus being spread. The cacti were eventually controlled by an introduced moth (Cactoblastis cactorum [...] ) whose larvae fed on the plant, one of the earliest examples of biological control.|$|E

40|$|Objective: This {{study was}} an {{examination}} of 126 major depressive disorder (MDD) outpatients' morning to evening <b>diurnal</b> cortisol <b>patterns</b> to determine their association with family histories of mental illness, self-perceived depressive and anxiety distress, self-perceived health-related conditions, and healthy behaviors. Methods: 126 MDD outpatients and 106 healthy subjects were recruited. Self-reports of symptom distress, health-related conditions, and healthy behaviors and objective measures of salivary cortisol upon awakening, 45. min after awakening, and at 1200, 1700, and 2100. h were collected at subjects' homes. The individual growth curve model was used to manage data and to analyze repeated observations of self-report data associated with <b>diurnal</b> cortisol <b>patterns.</b> Results: For MDD outpatients, flatter <b>diurnal</b> cortisol <b>patterns</b> were more likely found in subjects with family histories of mental illness than in those without. Patient-reported shorter total sleep hours, more severe levels of depression and higher suffering levels were positively associated with flatter <b>diurnal</b> cortisol <b>patterns.</b> Less than 5 sleep hours was more likely associated with flatter <b>diurnal</b> cortisol <b>patterns</b> than above 7 sleep hours. Severe levels of depression were more likely related to flatter <b>diurnal</b> cortisol <b>patterns</b> than moderate and mild levels of depression. Higher anxiety levels, better sleep quality {{and higher levels of}} physical activity reported by patients were positively associated with steeper <b>diurnal</b> cortisol <b>patterns.</b> Unlike the MDD outpatients, the only trait associated with <b>diurnal</b> cortisol <b>patterns</b> in healthy subjects was total sleep hours. Conclusions: These results suggested that self-perceived good sleep quality, total hours slept of 7 or greater, and self-perceived higher levels of physical activity in the home environment could be positively related to positive stress endocrine outcomes seen as steep <b>diurnal</b> cortisol <b>patterns</b> in outpatients with major depressive disorder. © 2009. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
40|$|Arctic tundra plant {{communities}} {{are subject to}} a short growing season that is the primary period in which carbon is sequestered for growth and survival. This period is often characterized by 24 -h photoperiods for several months a year. To compensate for the short growing season tundra plants may extend their carbon uptake capacity on a diurnal basis, but whether this is true remains unknown. Here, we examined in situ <b>diurnal</b> <b>patterns</b> of physiological activity and foliar metabolites during the early, mid, and late growing season in seven arctic species under light-saturated conditions. We found clear <b>diurnal</b> <b>patterns</b> in photosynthesis and respiration, with midday peaks and midnight lulls indicative of circadian regulation. <b>Diurnal</b> <b>patterns</b> in foliar metabolite concentrations were less distinct between the species and across seasons, suggesting that metabolic pools are likely governed by proximate external factors. This understanding of diurnal physiology will also enhance the parameterization of process-based models, which will aid in better predicting future carbon dynamics for the tundra. This becomes even more critical considering the rapid changes that are occurring circumpolarly that are altering plant community structure, function, and ultimately regional and global carbon budgets...|$|R
40|$|The {{effect of}} serial bathing (10 -minute bathing in city water or Misasa hot spring, 40 ℃, once daily {{for one or}} four weeks) on the {{circadian}} variations of plasma metabolites was studied in three groups of rats : hot spring bathing rats, city water bathing rats and non-treated rats. Plasma obtained by decapitation at 8 : 00, 12 : 00, 16 : 00, 20 : 00 and 24 : 00 hours was analysed for catecholamines (CA), free fatty acids (FFA), cholesterol (C) and glucose. 1) Noradrenaline (NA) and adrenaline (A) were significantly lower at 24 : 00 hours with significantly lower 24 -hour average concentrations and also with significantly different <b>diurnal</b> <b>patterns</b> in the 1 -week hot spring bathing rats; in the 4 -week hot spring bathing rats, lower 24 -hour average concentrarion of A was the only significant finding. The results suggest the suppressive effect of hot spring bathing on the sympathetic system or pituitary gland-adrenal medulla; they also suggest the adaptation to hot spring bathing. 2) Free fatty acids were significantly higher in the 1 -week hot spring bathing rats at 12 : 00 hours as compared with non-treated rats and city water bathing rats. The 4 -week hot spring bathing rats showed concentration of FFA not different from the remaining two groups of rats. No significant difference was noted in <b>diurnal</b> <b>patterns</b> among the three groups of rats. The {{results suggest that the}} high FFA concentrations in the 1 -week hot spring bathing rats are related to the physico-chemical constituents of the hot spring to some extent and that the rats adapt themselves to bathing during the 4 -week preriod. 3) Cholesterol was significantly lower in the 4 -week hot spring bathing rats as compared with non-treated rats and city water bathing rats; no different <b>diurnal</b> <b>patterns</b> were noted among the three groups of rats. The results suggest the suppressive effect of 4 -week hot spring bathing on plasma cholesterol concentrations as reported previously by us. 4) No Significant difference was noted in concentrations as well as in <b>diurnal</b> <b>patterns</b> of plasma glucose among the three groups of rats.

The peach trees (Prunus persica (L.) Batsch) used in this field experiment consisted of an early-maturing freestone cultivar, ‘Flavorcrest,’ grafted onto three different rootstocks: Nemaguard (a vigorous seed-propagated control, P. persica × P. davidiana hybrid), Hiawatha (an intermediate vigor rootstock, derived from an open pollinated seedling of a P. besseyi × P. salicina hybrid) and K- 146 - 43 (a semi-dwarfing rootstock, P. salicina × P. persica hybrid). <b>Diurnal</b> <b>patterns</b> of ΨSTEM and stem extension growth were measured on six dates (March 29, April 12, April 26, May 10, May 24 and June 18) during the primary period of peach shoot extension growth.

50|$|In acute {{states of}} severe stress, {{cortisol}} secretion by {{the adrenal gland}} increases up to sixfold, parallel to {{the severity of the}} condition.

50|$|Currently the {{behavior}} of Gaoligong pikas is unknown, however it {{has been compared to}} the Ochotona forresti, Forrest's pika. The absences of information known about Gaoligong Pikas {{may be due to the}} range of access their habitat has to offer. The behavior of the Gaoligong Pika shares similar general behavioral traits of the pika family, including characteristics from the Asian meadow-dwelling Pika species. The meadow-dwelling species of pikas displays more social behavior amongst members of the same species group and their families. Unlike the Asian meadow-dwelling species, some pikas, such as the northern American pika, are typically very defensive in regards to their habitat and communicate through vocal projections in a whistle-like manner. They are often found in a solitary state, except during mating periods. Because of the importance of keeping their habitat defended against other Pikas and predators, when one species of Pika encounters another or the same, it often leads to aggressive interactions. There is great diversity between {{the behavior}}s of some groups of Pikas than others. Each group of pikas ultimately behaves depending on the location and environmental factors that play into role in the geographical habitat they are located at. Generally Pikas are most active during the morning and late afternoon. They follow a <b>diurnal</b> <b>pattern</b> within their system, which makes them more energy efficient during some periods of the day. Additionally, Pikas do not hibernate during the winter, making them highly dependent on environmental and habitat factors. During the winter time, Pikas must use underground tunnels as means of targeting food during those periods of the seasons. Pikas store sun-dried summer harvest plants within the tunnels. This brings the mortality rate of the pika species higher than other animal species that do not hibernate during the winter season, due to the dependence of habitat and environmental factors for the supply of food.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{opportunity}} of fuzzy set approach for study of joint diurnal distribution of principal coupled atmosphere-land variables (temperature {{of air and}} soil, humidity of air and soil, atmospheric precipitation, pressure, short-wave radiation, cloudiness) is investigated. Ten years data sets of one hour temporal resolution for several meteorological sites of Russian north-west region are used. Known and novel interrelationships between various atmospheric and linked soil variables are reviewed. The revealed relationships between solar downward radiation fluxes and soil temperature <b>diurnal</b> <b>patterns</b> allow to simulate all principal elements of surface energy exchange: long-wave outgoing radiation fluxes in the atmosphere, soil heat fluxes, sensible, turbulent and latent heat fluxes. It was {{found out that the}} most complicated links take place for fuzzy sets, corresponding to fractional cloudiness <b>diurnal</b> <b>patterns.</b> There is an asymmetrical relationship between solar daily sums of radiance for half cloudy day and mean soil temperature values. That is a main cause for simulation of meteorological and heat balance component diurnal cycles in most ecological models. Introduced stationary and transition modes for main meteorological variable <b>diurnal</b> <b>patterns</b> represent the background for simulation of all known weather phenomena. This modes are used also as a neural network’s nodes for hidden layers. Implementation of neural networks (back propagation algorithm) allows to perform several modeling experiments.
