2500|$|In April 2007, Kay was {{watching}} the sixth [...] hour of The Today Show (an apparent jab at NBC's decision to extend it {{at the expense of}} the Passions timeslot) when it was interrupted with a news report that Luis had been arrested. In one August 2007 episode, Tabitha said that a certain soap opera was starting on DirecTV and she would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>her</b> friends not to call her between the hours of 2:00 and 3:00 pm, blatantly referring to Passions itself. At the beginning of the show's final week on NBC, as Whitney was preparing to move to New Orleans, Theresa asked if she was sure she wanted to go, and Whitney commented that she had already arranged to have her DirecTV hooked up in Louisiana so she could [...] "keep up on everything happening in Harmony." [...] And also in 2007, Endora flat-out made a reference to the [...] "audience" [...] in one of her thought balloons, prompting Norma to look in the camera and respond, [...] "Audience? What audience?" [...] Endora also pointed out in one of her thought balloons that when Miguel returned to Passions, he looked nothing like Jesse Metcalfe ("Nope, not even close!"). In May 2008 while Juanita was looking for clues in a bookstore as to where Pilar was, the bargain shelf was full of copies of Hidden Passions. In [...] June 2008, Tabitha mentions the fourth hour of Today being a ratings-grabber, poking fun as to how they canceled the soap making way for this fourth hour trying to bring the ratings on NBC up.|$|E
60|$|CARMODY (uncertainly). Yes--I disremembered she didn't know. I'll <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>her,</b> surely.|$|E
6000|$|... 'I'll always {{remember}} that, and I'll tell your mother. Ah, but she won't believe me, Dick; you will <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>her</b> yourself.' ...|$|E
60|$|Johnnie Hewlett indeed {{was sorry}} {{when he went}} home to his aunt, and <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>her</b> why he <b>had</b> not been {{confirmed}} after all.|$|R
60|$|When Mrs. Easterfield {{heard all}} that Olive <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>her</b> about Maria Port, her heart {{went out to}} that brave man who kept the toll-gate.|$|R
6000|$|... "We <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>her</b> she {{was going}} a journey, or we never could have got her into the carriage," [...] she explained, feeling like a thief.|$|R
60|$|March 2.--My guest {{has just}} left me. I am afraid Mrs. Eyrecourt will be sadly {{disappointed}} {{when she hears}} what I <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>her.</b>|$|E
60|$|In {{ten minutes}} they were {{steaming}} {{out of the}} harbour for their voyage {{of four or five}} hours, at whose ending she would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>her</b> strange story.|$|E
6000|$|... "It's NOT an excuse," [...] she said. [...] "If {{mother will}} {{let me go}} to church like this I'll go. But I'll <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>HER</b> why, Mr. Campbell, because I'm certain she'd never let me if I didn't." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, I <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>her</b> something. It {{looks so}} funny me being {{here and not}} married to you. I didn't know what she'd think of me." ...|$|R
60|$|ALICK [wagging {{his head}} sadly]. I <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>her.</b> And then I--I-- {{bought her a}} {{sealskin}} muff, and I just slipped it into her hands and came away.|$|R
6000|$|Then he <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>her.</b> [...] "We can't find Pony, {{and some}} of the boys thought Jim might know where he is. I'm sorry to disturb you, Mrs. Leonard. Good-night," [...] and he went back home.|$|R
6000|$|... "No," [...] she said, [...] "that wouldn't do. She {{has kept}} {{account of the}} time, you may be sure, and she would ask me at once if I was inquiring in your behalf, and I should <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>her</b> the truth." ...|$|E
6000|$|He leant {{his head}} against the bed-post and groaned. [...] "Milly may be here at any moment," [...] says he, [...] "and I'll <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>her</b> the baby's been sent by mistake to a Dog Show! I daresn't do it," [...] he says, [...] "I daresn't do it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] she answered, most {{unexpectedly}} to me, [...] "I {{will try}} to see her. But if I do see her, and she refuses to tell me anything about your daughter, what will you do? Of course, I shall <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>her</b> I come from you, and for you." ...|$|E
60|$|While {{we were at}} table, I {{thought it}} a {{favourable}} occasion <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> Peggotty about Mr. Barkis, who, before I had finished what I <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>her,</b> began <b>to</b> laugh, and throw her apron over her face.|$|R
6000|$|Now I hesitated, as what I <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>her</b> {{seemed so}} foolish, indeed so insane, {{while she waited}} patiently as though to give me time to shape my thoughts. Speaking at last because I must, I said, ...|$|R
6000|$|Bostil stared after her. [...] "D--n me!" [...] he swore, as {{he threw}} a boot against the wall. [...] "I reckon I'll never let her marry Slone, but I just <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>her</b> what I think of him!" ...|$|R
60|$|Charlotte assented. 'I <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>her</b> something,' she said, 'which {{will make}} no difference, but which I should {{like her to}} know this morning--at once. I have {{discovered}} {{that we have been}} entirely mistaken about Mr. Somerset.' She nerved herself to relate succinctly what had come to her knowledge the day before.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, {{your aunt}} isn't coming {{home for a}} month yet. When she comes you will <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>her</b> that the cat--is lost--but you needn't say WHEN it happened. As for the rest, Fatima is your {{property}} now, so Aunt Cynthia can't grumble. But she will have a poorer opinion than ever of your fitness to run a house alone." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, I have {{supposed}} that ladies occasionally shed tears of pity. If she accepted him conditionally she would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>her</b> father about it." [...] Mrs. March {{gave him a}} glance of silent contempt, and he hastened to atone for his stupidity. [...] "Perhaps she's told him on the instalment plan. She may have begun by confessing that Burnamy had been in Carlsbad. Poor old fellow, I wish {{we were going to}} find him in Ansbach! He could make things very smooth for us." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] said Thirlwell, [...] "she has borne enough. You {{can imagine}} the shock she'd get if we found out, and <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>her.</b> The thing's done with. It's some relief to feel that my {{responsibility}} has gone." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Then I <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>her</b> {{the whole}} story, too; {{and every time}} I tell it it seems sillier and sillier to imagine that Ken meant {{anything}} serious. I felt idiotic and ashamed by the time I got through.|$|R
2500|$|Wayland, then flies <b>to</b> <b>her</b> father <b>telling</b> {{him of his}} revenge. The sorrow {{stricken}} king {{asks his}} thrall to go and fetch his daughter and Böðvildr <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>her</b> father the gruesome truth mirroring the tragedy told of in Deor: ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Sometimes," [...] she said, {{a little}} wearily, [...] "Clementina tries me. I'm afraid she doesn't {{practise}} enough, and I <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>her</b> {{the same things}} so often. And then she always dresses entirely in white, and that does get monotonous. But Gen. Pinkney is the dearest old man! I wish you could know him, Joe. He comes in sometimes when I am with Clementina at the piano--he is a widower, you know--and stands there pulling his white goatee. 'And how are the semiquavers and the demisemiquavers progressing?' he always asks.|$|E
6000|$|For {{the next}} three weeks Black Sheep was {{strictly}} allowed to do nothing. He spent his time in the old nursery looking at the broken toys, for all of which account must be rendered to Mamma. Aunty Rosa hit him over the hands if even a wooden boat were broken. But that sin was of small importance compared to the other revelations, so darkly hinted at by Aunty Rosa. [...] "When your mother comes, and hears what I <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>her,</b> she may appreciate you properly," [...] she said grimly, and mounted guard over Judy lest that small maiden should attempt to comfort her brother, to the peril of her own soul.|$|E
6000|$|... "No, no, my Lord; {{here is our}} gear, which I bade Sybald and Henry see {{bestowed}} in our chamber. Well, these Franks are come to a pass, indeed! My grandmother {{will never}} believe what we shall <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>her.</b> Glass windows and hangings to sleeping chambers! I do not like it I am sure we shall {{never be able to}} sleep, closed up from the free air of heaven in this way: I shall be always waking, and fancying I am in the chapel at home, hearing Father Lucas chanting his matins. Besides, my father would blame me for letting you be made as tender as a Frank. I'll have out this precious window, if I can." ...|$|E
5000|$|They don’t get on {{very well}} initially, but later, they {{fall in love}} with each other. Luis feels that he <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>her</b> that he is her son's father, but he can’t do this, because if he did, Hipólita would hate him.|$|R
50|$|Jimmy has Pop set up {{fights with}} lesser foes. He changes his style, boxing rather than punching, to avoid risking {{damage to his}} new face. The fans boo him. Meanwhile, Pop sends for Peggy. Jimmy <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>her</b> that he is seeing someone else.|$|R
6000|$|... "And you in brown!" [...] she said, indignantly {{turning to}} Mr. Lorry; [...] "couldn't you <b>tell</b> <b>her</b> what you <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>her,</b> without {{frightening}} her to death? Look at her, with her pretty pale face and her cold hands. Do {{you call that}} being a Banker?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Why {{does she}} know I'm at home? That's your fault. She oughtn't to know {{anything}} about it. Oh dear! oh dear! oh dear!" [...] These last ejaculations arose from his having just then remembered the nature of his postscript to Harry Annesley, and the engagement of Joe Thoroughbung to his niece. He made up his mind at the moment,--or thought that he had made up his mind,--that Harry Annesley should not have a shilling as long as he lived. [...] "I am quite out of breath. I cannot see her yet. Go and offer the lady cake and wine, and tell her that you had found me very much indisposed. I think you will <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>her</b> that I am not well enough to receive her to-day." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Why, sir, {{you would}} only <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>her</b> about Martha, and I am {{sure it would}} do for his business. Miss Greendale can know nothing about it. So far as I can remember, she was not more than sixteen at the time. I don't suppose Lady Greendale ever heard of it. She knew, of course, of Martha's being missing, because it made quite a stir, but I don't suppose that she heard of her coming back. She was only at home three weeks before she died. There were not many that ever saw her, and father {{told me that he}} and the others made it so hot for Carthew one day at Chippenham market that he never came down again, and sold the place soon after. I don't suppose the gentry ever heard {{anything}} about it. If they had, Lady Greendale would surely never let her daughter marry him." ...|$|E
60|$|The morning's post {{brought her}} the first letter from her husband, {{and in the midst}} of all her anxiety as to the contents, she could not but linger a moment on the aspect of the Honourable Mrs. Colin Keith in his handwriting; there was a carefulness in the {{penmanship}} that assured her that, let him <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>her</b> what he would, the very inditing of that address had been enjoyment to him. That the border was black told nothing, but the intelligence was such as she had been fully prepared for. Colin had arrived to find the surgeon's work over, but the patient fast sinking. Even his recognition of his brother had been uncertain, and within twenty-four hours of the morning that had given Colin a home of his own, the last remnant of the home circle of his childhood had passed from him.|$|E
5000|$|Cindy’s Magic Wand: Cindy Thrower slaves for a cruel {{uncle and}} aunt and spiteful cousins. She starts {{secretly}} {{training as a}} javelin thrower, but the lies she <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>her</b> nasty relatives in order to slip away to train start {{to catch up with}} her.|$|R
60|$|Mr. Fenwick {{did come}} again--the very next evening, but one. And he came so often after that that even Nancy got {{resigned}} to him. One day I <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>her</b> something. I shrank from doing it, for I feared {{it would make}} her feel badly.|$|R
60|$|As {{they lay}} {{side by side}} a mermaid caught Wendy by the feet, and began pulling her softly into the water. Peter, feeling her slip from him, woke with a start, and was {{just in time to}} draw her back. But he <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>her</b> the truth.|$|R
