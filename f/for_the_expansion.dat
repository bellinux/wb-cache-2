5|$|In 1880, Selfe became vice {{president}} of the School of Arts. He supported the school's Working Men's College, but felt a more thorough focus on practical skills was needed.

He also pushed <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>expansion</b> of technical education facilities into the suburban and regional districts.|$|E

30|$|We {{proposed}} {{two methods}} {{to improve the}} performance of the QA system; the first method is <b>for</b> <b>the</b> query <b>expansion</b> of <b>the</b> relevant document retrieval module and the second method is <b>for</b> <b>the</b> candidate answer evaluation module. <b>For</b> <b>the</b> query <b>expansion,</b> Saggion and Gaizauskas (2004) proposed to obtain words <b>for</b> <b>the</b> query <b>expansion</b> using relevance feedback from the Web. They regarded words that appeared frequently in documents retrieved for each question query as <b>the</b> new words <b>for</b> <b>the</b> query <b>expansion.</b> Mori et al. (2007) and Derczynski et al. (2008) used tf-idf and Lin et al. (2010) used Okapi-BM 25 <b>for</b> <b>the</b> criteria instead of the term frequency of Saggion and Gaizauskas (2004). Lao et al. (2008) proposed to obtain the synonyms of words in each question using bootstrap method and to use them <b>for</b> <b>the</b> query <b>expansion.</b> Saggion and Gaizauskas (2004) also used synonyms but obtained them from a dictionary. Liu et al. (2010) obtained them from Wikipedia. Finally, Berger et al. (2000) proposed to learn what kind of words tend to appear in answers when some words appeared in questions using a Q&A site corpus and to use words that frequently appear <b>for</b> <b>the</b> query <b>expansion.</b> We improved one of the approaches suggested by Berger et al.

5|$|As President, Taylor {{kept his}} {{distance}} from Congress and his cabinet, even as partisan tensions threatened {{to divide the}} Union. Debate over the status of slavery in the Mexican Cession dominated the political agenda and led to threats of secession from Southerners. Despite being a Southerner and a slaveholder himself, Taylor did not push <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>expansion</b> of slavery, and he sought sectional harmony above all other concerns. To avoid the issue of slavery, he urged settlers in New Mexico and California to bypass the territorial stage and draft constitutions for statehood, {{setting the stage for}} the Compromise of 1850.|$|E
5|$|Avonmouth {{railway station}} was the {{terminus}} of the Bristol Port Railway and Pier, a self-contained railway which {{ran along the}} River Avon in Bristol, England. The station, which opened in 1865, was adjacent to a pier on the River Severn at Avonmouth. It had two platforms and an adjacent hotel, {{as well as an}} engine shed and water tank. The station was closed in 1902 as the land was required <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>expansion</b> of Avonmouth Docks, although it remained in use for workers' trains until 1903. The hotel continued in operation until 1926, when it too was demolished {{to make way for the}} docks. The station site is now in the middle of Avonmouth Docks.|$|E

5|$|During the 19th century, Lees Ferry {{served as}} a gateway <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>expansion</b> of white {{settlement}} from Utah south into Arizona. Most of the settlers were Mormons, who had been long established in the Utah Valley near present-day Salt Lake City, and were looking for additional land. Although the river at Lee's Ferry is too deep to ford {{for most of the}} year, its relatively calm current presented an attractive site for crossing by boat. Jacob Hamblin successfully crossed the river here in 1864, and during the next few years the Mormon presence swelled to the scale of a small military outpost (Fort Meeks) in order to defend against Navajo raids. However, these works eventually fell into disrepair as a result {{of not being able to}} sustain themselves in the valley.|$|E
5|$|From 7 January 2001, NSB {{made several}} major {{changes to the}} {{commuter}} rail. A fixed, hourly headway was introduced on the trains from Steinkjer to Trondheim; including extra rush-hour trains from Lerkendal to Stjørdal, giving 23 departures per day in each direction. South of Trondheim, the service was rerouted to terminate at Lerkendal. Six stations were closed: Muruvik, Solbakken, Mære, Østborg, Rinnan and Elberg. At the same time, the station at Marienborg and Røstad opened. NSB also introduced a fare zone system, which gave up to NOK20 discount for single-fare travelers and about the same fares for month-pass holders. Part of the reason <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>expansion</b> was that the delivery of the new Class 93 trains for regional services freed up more Class 92 units. This also allowed NSB to operate some of services with double unit (four-car) trains in rush-hour.|$|E
5|$|In 1937, Shoghi Effendi {{launched}} a seven-year {{plan for the}} Bahá'ís of North America, followed by another in 1946. In 1953, he launched the first international plan, the Ten Year World Crusade. This plan included extremely ambitious goals <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>expansion</b> of Bahá'í communities and institutions, the translation of Bahá'í texts into several new languages, and the sending of Bahá'í pioneers into previously unreached nations. He announced in letters during the Ten Year Crusade {{that it would be}} followed by other plans {{under the direction of the}} Universal House of Justice, which was elected in 1963 at the culmination of the Crusade. The House of Justice then {{launched a}} nine-year plan in 1964, and a series of subsequent multi-year plans of varying length and goals followed, guiding the direction of the international Bahá'í community.|$|E

5|$|In 1998, the Ministry of Defence (Mindef) {{acquired}} the land containing the spring <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>expansion</b> {{of the nearby}} Sembawang Air Base, leaving F with less than 4 hectares (10 acres) of land. Its water-bottling plant survived until the early 1990s however. In January 2002, locals' interest to the hot spring, which had {{caught the attention of}} Singaporeans after the surrounding land had been cleared to begin the RSAF air base extension. Sembawang community leaders gathered signatures to petition Mindef, which was going to fence off the area, to preserve and develop the hot spring for the general public. Mindef gave the green light to the appeals and opened a small side gate pavement for the public to access the spring.|$|E
5|$|In July 1967, Taylor {{left the}} Packers <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>expansion</b> New Orleans Saints to play under head coach Tom Fears, a Hall of Fame {{receiver}} {{and a former}} assistant coach for five seasons in Green Bay under Lombardi. He was signed to four one-year contracts with the Saints, worth $68,000 for 1968 and $72,000 for each subsequent season. The Saints also signed Hornung, though he retired prior to the 1967 season. Taylor recorded his lowest rushing statistics since his rookie season, but was still relatively productive as a receiver, catching 38 passes. Prior to the 1968 season, he was relegated to special teams duties, {{and as a result}} he refused to play in that week's exhibition game. Taylor retired from pro football in September, at the end of training camp.|$|E
