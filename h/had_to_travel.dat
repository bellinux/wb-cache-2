Jane became Hogg's common-law wife and they had two children together.

5|$|After the {{evacuation}} of Gallipoli, Downes was appointed Assistant Director of Medical Services (ADMS) of the newly formed ANZAC Mounted Division on 15 March 1916. He was given the temporary rank of colonel, before substantive promotion on 20 February 1917. Downes combined this post with that of ADMS AIF Egypt from 6 September 1916. Downes therefore <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>travel</b> {{back and forth to}} Cairo. In November 1916, a Deputy ADMS was appointed to assist him.|$|E

5|$|Alice again laid {{claim to}} the regency. However, most Antiochene lords {{remained}} hostile {{to the idea of}} a female ruler and sent envoys to BaldwinII's successor, Fulk of Anjou, who was Alice's brother-in-law. Alice made an alliance with Joscelin II, Count of Edessa, and Pons, Count of Tripoli, in early 1132. Fulk <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>travel</b> to Antioch by sea, because Pons did not allow him to march through the County of Tripoli. Fulk landed at St. Symeon where the Antiochene barons acknowledged him as regent. He appointed Reynald I Mazoir, Constable of Antioch, to administer the principality.|$|E
5|$|Aspinall {{worked closely}} with Epstein, who {{provided}} weekly notes for Aspinall {{to give to the}} group's stage act, their concert appearances, and the fees they would receive. The Beatles <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>travel</b> in Aspinall's van along with their equipment, but British roads in the early 1960s were notoriously pot-holed and slow to navigate. Ringo Starr remembered that the travelling never seemed to stop during the early tours of Britain in Aspinall's van, as they would be driven up and down Great Britain with one of the group in the passenger seat, but with the other three on a hard bench seat in the back.|$|E
5|$|Filming of Not My Life {{took place}} over four years in Africa, Asia, Europe, and North and South America documenting human {{trafficking}} in thirteen countries: Albania, Brazil, Cambodia, Egypt, Ghana, Guatemala, India, Italy, Nepal, Romania, Senegal, Uganda, and the United States. Shooting in Ghana {{took place over}} four 18-hour days, during which the film crew <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>travel</b> over washboard roads in Land Rovers and did not sleep. Filming in Svay Pak took place in March 2010, and shooting in Abusir, Egypt took place the following month.|$|E

5|$|From {{the end of}} the {{eleventh}} century, universities had been founded across Europe, developing as semi-autonomous centres of learning, often teaching theology, mathematics, law and medicine. Until the fifteenth century, those Scots who wished to attend university <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>travel</b> to England, to Oxford or Cambridge, or to the Continent. Just over 1,000 students have been identified as doing so between the twelfth century and 1410. Among the destinations Paris was the most important, but also Cologne, Orl√©ans, Wittenberg, Louvain and Vienna.|$|E
5|$|In {{the end of}} 1277 Constantine Tikh {{finally took}} {{measures}} to confront the rebels. He gathered a small army and advanced slowly as he <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>travel</b> in a chariot because of his injury. Ivaylo attacked and defeated this force, killing many of the emperor's close associates, {{while the rest of}} the army joined the rebels. Ivaylo personally slew Constantine Tikh, claiming that the emperor did nothing to keep his honour in the battle. After his triumph, Ivaylo began to seize the country's fortified cities, which surrendered and recognized him as emperor one by one. By the spring of 1278 only the capital Tarnovo remained under the control of Empress Maria.|$|E
5|$|Royton had no medieval {{church of}} its own, and for ecclesiastical purposes, lay within the parish of Prestwich-cum-Oldham in the Diocese of Lichfield, until 1541, when this diocese was divided and Royton {{became part of}} the Diocese of Chester. This in turn was divided in 1847, when the present Diocese of Manchester was created. For ritual baptisms, marriages and burials, the people of Royton, a Christian community, <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>travel</b> to churches that lay outside of the township's boundaries, {{including}} Oldham, St Mary's, Middleton, St Leonard's or Prestwich, St Mary's.|$|E

5|$|The 2016 season saw {{a return}} to the playoffs for the Crusaders, who posted a record of 11 wins and 4 losses, Despite the Crusaders having a good record they still {{finished}} 6th in the last spot of the Australasian Group. This occurred because the Hurricanes, Highlanders and Chiefs all posted a record of 11 wins and 4 losses. However, the other teams earned more points than the Crusaders (50) so finished higher Hurricanes (53), Highlanders (52) and Chiefs (51). The Crusaders <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>travel</b> to Johannesburg to face the Lions. The Crusaders were well beaten by the (Runners-up) Lions 42-25 in the qualifier round.|$|E
5|$|There {{are several}} {{differences}} between the arcade game and its console adaptation. In the original arcade version, the Sankara Stones were not all found in one location {{at the end of}} a wave. Instead, Jones <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>travel</b> through a temple every two rounds. In addition, the entire style of play is different and bestows upon the player more weapons and items for Jones to collect from the slave children he frees. Jones was also unable to jump in previous incarnations of the game.|$|E
5|$|Until the 15th century {{those who}} wished to attend {{university}} <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>travel</b> to England or the continent, but this situation was transformed by {{the founding of the}} University of St Andrews in 1413, the University of Glasgow in 1451 and the University of Aberdeen in 1495. Initially these institutions were designed for the training of clerics, but they would increasingly be used by laymen who would begin to challenge the clerical monopoly of administrative post in the government and law. Scottish scholars continued to visit the continent for their second degrees and this international contact helped bring the new ideas of humanism back into Scottish intellectual life.|$|E

5|$|Each civilization can {{purchase}} upgrades {{that increase the}} rate of gathering these resources. Players can construct a marketplace for trade; players can trade wood, stone, and food for gold, and use gold to buy other resources. Market prices fluctuate with every transaction. Furthermore, markets and docks can also generate gold by using trading carts or cogs which are used to visit foreign markets and ports; once they return to the player's market/dock, gold {{is added to the}} stockpile. The amount of gold a trade unit earns on each trip is related to the distance it <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>travel</b> to a foreign market; more gold is earned on longer trips. It is possible to trade with enemies' markets or docks, but the player's trading units may be attacked or destroyed by enemy units in the process. Players do not need to keep trading manually, as once they select the port or market the trading units infinitely continue to trade.|$|E
5|$|Filming {{began on}} February 2, 2014 in Thailand. Skin Trade was shot over 50 days: 43 filming in Thailand, and four filming in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. In Thailand, filming {{locations}} included: Suvarnabhumi Airport, the Min Buri District, the Siam Kempinski Hotel, a rice mill, a leather-bleaching factory, and a century-old mansion. Filming was briefly disrupted by public protests {{relating to the}} Thai political crisis. To avoid any further interference, {{the cast and crew}} <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>travel</b> early to get through the traffic and to the set on time. Most of the film was shot on location, but some scenes were filmed at Baanrig Studios. Skin Trade was the first film to be shot in English by an organization based in Asia (outside of Hong Kong) for an international theatrical release.|$|E
5|$|In 1989, Maggie Roswell {{was hired}} {{for the first}} season of The Simpsons. She played a few minor {{characters}} until she became a regular cast member {{with the introduction of}} Maude Flanders in the second season. In 1994, Roswell and her husband Hal Rayle moved from Los Angeles to Denver to raise their daughter. Together they established the Roswell 'n' Rayle Company, creating and voicing advertisements for companies. Because of her move to Denver, Roswell <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>travel</b> to Los Angeles twice a week to tape The Simpsons. This ultimately led to her requesting a pay raise in 1999; however, Fox refused to offer her the amount she wanted so she quit the show. Roswell returned to The Simpsons in 2002 after reaching a deal to record her lines from her Denver home.|$|E

5|$|Italy's {{position}} in {{the centre of the}} Mediterranean made it unacceptably hazardous to send ships from Britain to Egypt via that route, so British reinforcements and supplies for the area <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>travel</b> around the Cape of Good Hope. For this reason, it was more convenient to reinforce General Sir Archibald Wavell's Middle East Command with troops from Australia, New Zealand and India. Nonetheless, even when Britain was threatened with invasion after the Battle of France and equipment was urgently required to re-equip the British Expeditionary Force after its losses in the Dunkirk evacuation, troops and supplies were still despatched to the Middle East Command. A convoy that departed the United Kingdom in August 1940 brought guns, stores, ammunition, and three armoured regiments, including the 7th Royal Tank Regiment, equipped with Matilda II tanks.|$|E
5|$|Production {{began in}} 1979, when Deodato was {{contacted}} by German film producers {{to make a}} film similar to Last Cannibal World, which was also directed by Deodato. He accepted the project and immediately went in search of a producer, choosing his friend Francesco Palaggi. The two first flew to Colombia to scout for filming locations. Leticia was chosen as the principal filming location after Deodato met a Colombian documentary filmmaker at the airport in Bogot√°, who suggested the town as a location ideal for filming. Other locations had been considered, specifically the locations where the film Burn!, directed by Gillo Pontecorvo, had been shot, but Deodato rejected these locations due to lack of suitable rainforest. Leticia was only accessible by aircraft, and from there, the cast and crew <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>travel</b> by boat to reach the set. The locale presented many problems for the production, in particular the heat and sudden rain storms, which sporadically delayed filming.|$|E
5|$|The Alford {{area was}} one of the largest medical {{practices}} in the United Kingdom, and in the winter months Forbes often <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>travel</b> through ten-foot snowdrifts in a converted Universal Carrier. These conditions were not entirely unfamiliar; a trip to see an uncle in St. Moritz at the age of thirteen had led to him taking up skiing and figure-skating, and winning a number of bob sled races. He did not live in Alford, but remained at Brux, appointing a medical assistant to live in the town. The farm, left {{in the hands of a}} small resident staff, quickly ran into financial troubles. To raise a large amount of money quickly, Forbes sold the practice in Alford, and returned to the farm in 1952, running it directly as a going concern from then on.|$|E
