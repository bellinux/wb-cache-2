50|$|A Ludwieg tube is a {{wind tunnel}} that {{produces}} supersonic flow {{for short periods}} of time. A large evacuated dump tank is separated from the downstream end of a convergent-divergent nozzle by a diaphragm or <b>fast</b> <b>acting</b> <b>valve.</b> The upstream end of the nozzle connects to a long cylindrical tube, whose cross-sectional area is significantly larger than the throat area of the nozzle. Initially, the pressure in the nozzle and tube is high. To start the tunnel, the diaphragm is ruptured, e.g., by piercing it with a suitable cutting device, or opening the valve respectively. As always when a diaphragm ruptures, a shock wave propagates into the low-pressure region (here the dump tank) and an expansion wave propagates into the high-pressure region (here the nozzle and the long tube). As this unsteady expansion propagates through the long tube, it sets up a steady subsonic flow toward the nozzle, which is accelerated by the convergent-divergent nozzle to a supersonic condition. The flow is steady until the expansion, having been reflected from {{the far end of}} the tube, arrives at the nozzle again. For practical reasons, flow times are about 100 milliseconds for most Ludwieg tubes. For many purposes, this flow duration is sufficient. However, by taking advantage of multiple quasi-static flows between expansion wave reflections, experimentation times of up to 6 seconds can be achieved.|$|E

To control these pressure surges, Fraunhofer UMSICHT and Forschungszentrum Rossendorf have conducted experiments whose results {{are used to}} develop new methods {{for the prevention of}} water hammer and cavitational hammer. The <b>fast</b> <b>acting</b> <b>valve</b> is equipped with an innovative hydraulic braking system ("ABS-Armatur®") and is combined with a check valve to suppress the water hammer. Since the described system does not need any additional energy source and adapts automatically to changes of the pipe system parameters, it is also regarded as particularly suitable for already existing plants...|$|E

40|$|<b>Fast</b> <b>acting</b> <b>valves</b> {{are often}} applied for quick safety {{shut-down}} of pipelines for liquids and {{gases in the}} chemical and petrochemical industry {{as well as in}} power plants and state water supplies. The fast deceleration of the liquid leads to water hammer upstream the valve and to cavitational hammer downstream the fast closing valve. The valve characteristics given by manufacturers are usually measured at steady state flow conditions of the liquid. In comparison, the dynamic characteristics depend on the initial liquid velocity, valve closing velocity, the absolute pipe pressure and the pipe geometry. Fraunhofer UMSICHT conducts various test series examining valve dynamic characteristics in order of the dynamic analysis of pressure surges in fast closing processes. Therefore a test rig is used which consists of two pipelines of DN 50 and DN 100 with an approximate length of 230 m each. In this paper the results of performed pressure surge experiments with fast closing and opening valves will be compared to calculations of commercial software programs such as MONA, FLOWMASTER 2. Thus the calculation software for water supply, power plants, oil and gas and chemical industry can be permanently improved...|$|R
40|$|The use of biogas {{for energy}} {{production}} has been progressively increasing over last years, {{due to an}} increasing interest both in agricultural and energy policies of many industrialized countries. Biogas compression by means of natural gas infrastructure seems the most immediate solution, but could also lead to problems due to the different physical properties of the two gases. In this paper, a non-linear one-dimensional modular dynamic model is developed and used for the simulation of compression system transient behavior. The arrangement consists of a main line, where the compressor operates, and an anti-surge control, which consists of a recycle loop activated by a <b>fast</b> <b>acting</b> <b>valve.</b> Different maneuvers (start-up, normal operation, emergency shutdown and operating point variation) are simulated by using two different working fluids (methane and biogas). Simulations prove that the design of surge protection system should consider the fluid to be elaborated. Moreover, system predisposition to surge increases as the ratio between system volumes and the inertia of the rotating masses increases...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{control of}} {{particulate}} emissions from various {{applications such as}} power generation, cement plants, minerals processing etc. is essential to meet government regulatory standards. Filter bags and cartridge elements are typical common mediums used to separate particulates. A common method used to clean filters in the extraction of particulate matter from a fluid stream, is Reverse Pulse-Jet (RPJ) cleaning systems. The operation of the RPJ cleaning system relies on stored {{energy in the form}} of compressed gas, which is usually air. In this paper, the design and application of an efficient cleaning system to minimise the use of compressed gas to achieve the required filter cleaning is described. In an RPJ cleaning system, a high-energy pulse of compressed gas is delivered into the filter medium to rapidly increase the internal pressure and, in the case of filter bags, accelerate the filter material to force the break-up of dust cakes that form on the filter surface. One key component of the cleaning system is an extremely <b>fast</b> <b>acting</b> <b>valve</b> that controls the flow of the high pressure gas, the other is the blowtube. The blowtube is a commercial steel pipe with a number of outlet orifices distributed along the longitudinal axis and centrally located above each filter. The cleaning system improvements have been achieved by advances in valve and blowtube design that have enabled increases in the peak pressures developed in the filters whilst minimising the response rate of the system to decrease the air consumption. The store of potential energy must be effectively and efficiently converted into kinetic energy to utilise the available energy to build pressure in the filter. Thus, by improving the RPJ cleaning system the operating costs associated with the compressors are reduced thereby decreasing the environmental impact of operating filter cleaning systems, to more efficiently remove particulate matter from fluid streams...|$|E
40|$|Three {{models have}} been applied to very rapid {{compression}} of oxygen in a dead-ended tube. Pressures as high as 41 MPa (6000 psi) leading to peak temperatures of 1400 K are predicted. These temperatures are well {{in excess of the}} autoignition temperature (750 K) of teflon, a frequently used material for lining hoses employed in oxygen service. These findings are in accord with experiments that have resulted in ignition and combustion of the teflon, leading to the combustion of the stainless steel braiding and catastrophic failure. The system analyzed was representative of a capped off-high-pressure oxygen line, which could be part of a larger system. Pressurization of the larger system would lead to compression in the dead-end line, and possible ignition of the teflon liner. The model consists of a large plenum containing oxygen at the desired pressure (500 to 6000 psi). The plenum is connected via a <b>fast</b> <b>acting</b> <b>valve</b> to a stainless steel tube 2 cm inside diameter. Opening times are on the order of 15 ms. Downstream of the valve is an orifice sized to increase filling times to around 100 ms. The total length from the valve to the dead-end is 150 cm. The distance from the valve to the orifice is 95 cm. The models describe the fluid mechanics and thermodynamics of the flow, and do not include any combustion phenomena. A purely thermodynamic model assumes filling to be complete upstream of the orifice before any gas passes through the orifice. This simplification is reasonable based on experiment and computer modeling. Results show that peak temperatures as high as 4800 K can result from recompression of the gas after expanding through the orifice. An approximate transient model without an orifice was developed assuming an isentropic compression process. An analytical solution was obtained. Results indicated that fill times can be considerably shorter than valve opening times. The third model was a finite difference, 1 -D transient compressible flow model. Results from the code show the recompression effect but predict much lower peak temperatures than the thermodynamic model...|$|E

50|$|The normal {{application}} of ER fluids is in <b>fast</b> <b>acting</b> hydraulic <b>valves</b> and clutches, with {{the separation between}} plates being {{in the order of}} 1 mm and the applied potential being in the order of 1 kV. In simple terms, when the electric field is applied, an ER hydraulic valve is shut or the plates of an ER clutch are locked together, when the electric field is removed the ER hydraulic valve is open or the clutch plates are disengaged. Other common applications are in ER brakes (think of a brake as a clutch with one side fixed) and shock absorbers (which {{can be thought of as}} closed hydraulic systems where the shock is used to try to pump fluid through a valve).|$|R
40|$|An {{experimental}} {{study was conducted}} to investigate the effects of Wheeler Doublets (WDs), Vortex Generator Jets (VGJs), and their combination on supersonic inlet unstart. The final objective of the investigation was to achieve active control of unstart through the use of an unstart detection technique and the most effective of these actuators. Actuators were placed in the inner side wall of a floor-mounted inlet-isolator model in a Mach 5 flow. Unstart is initiated by increasing the back pressure by deflecting a flap at the downstream end of the isolator. Exclusive use of either WDs or VGJs was seen to have some effect on the back pressure but did not {{have a significant impact on}} delaying unstart. The combination of WDs and VGJs allowed the isolator’s back pressure to be raised steadily about 32 % higher than the maximum mean pressure achieved by the baseline case as well as resulted in a reduction of isolator pressure unsteadiness of about 34 %. The WDs+VGJs combination was successful because the presence of the WDs mitigated the unstart-inducing effect the VGJs had on the flow. Once the WDs+VGJs combination had proven to be the most effective actuator, an unstart detection technique and control logic were developed to form a closed loop control scheme aimed at preventing unstart. An important part of the control scheme was the identification of a wall-pressure-signal precursor to unstart that reliably predicted unstart onset. Experimental tests of this control system resulted in the achievement of active control of supersonic inlet unstart at a 50 % success rate. In addition, areas that could significantly increase the success rate for the current unstart control technique were found, such as better unstart detection techniques and <b>faster</b> <b>acting</b> <b>valves.</b> The investigation showed that once the inlet-isolator system had unstarted, re-start was not achieved by activating the WDs+VGJs.

40|$|This {{research}} advances {{the knowledge}} of the working principles of the Shock-wave Induced Spraying Process (SISP), a thermal spray material deposition technique. Pulses created by a <b>fast</b> <b>acting</b> <b>valve</b> pass through a heated line increasing energy content and interacting with metered batches of heated or non-heated powder introduced into the line. The powder is accelerated to high velocities before bonding to the substrate upon impact. Advantages over other cold spray processes include cost savings and a more effective transfer of thermal energy to the powder. The shock-wave occurring near the substrate in other cold spray processes is avoided. The SISP flow field is resolved by using a computational model. The two-dimensional model accounts for the valve, gas heater, a tapered nozzle {{at the tip of the}} device, and preheating of the powder. It is implemented with a commercial computational fluid dynamics code. Comparisons are made with one-dimensional predictions, and measurements of pressure and temperature. Particle flow predictions are validated using particle velocity and adhesion measurements. A flow region of both high temperature and velocity gas, favorable to material deposition, forms which is not present in comparable steady-state cold spray processes. Increasing gas pressure increases the gas speed, while increasing temperature increases speed and temperature of this region. Using helium results in greater energy levels but for shorter periods of time. This indicates the need for a powder feeder which places particles in the flow at correct instants and durations of time. The effects of particle flow parameters on system performance are examined. It is found that the device must be operated at very high main heater and powder heater temperatures: 900 °C and 700 °C respectively to achieve a coating with stainless steel using nitrogen as the driving gas. It is also shown that a heater length range of 0. 9 m to 1. 4 m results in the greatest likelihood of achieving a coating. A higher spray frequency yields more uniform coating at the expense of performance. Powder heating becomes effective at temperatures above 300 °C, especially with aluminum compared to copper and stainless steel...|$|E
40|$|The {{classical}} {{approach to}} scramjet intake design, analysis, experimental testing, and performance assessment treats the intake as {{separate from the}} rest of the vehicle. This thesis argues that a more integrated approach is necessary. The design space of Mach 7 two-dimensional, axi-symmetric spike and Busemann-type intakes with focused forebody waves and throats expanded to the Kantrowitz limit is parameterised geometrically and stream thrust average performance parameters calculated across the range of possible intake designs. An engine cycle is applied to arbitrate between conflicting capability and efficiency design points. The two-dimensional analysis is extended to include angle of attack, off-design Mach number and defocused conditions. Intakes with sharp leading edges and moderate turning angles are found to perform optimally, and the relatively large combustor hydraulic diameter and higher capability of inward turning designs are found to improve engine performance significantly. An upper bound is established for the performance of stream-traced Busemann intakes and it is shown how the performance of truncated Busemann derivatives may be improved by extending the leading edge at constant angle. The thesis also describes complementary experiments investigating intake operability carried out in the University of Oxford's gun tunnel. This facility was converted to operate as a Ludwieg tube with Light piston Isentropic Compression Heating (LICH) to improve flow steadiness when matching Reynolds numbers and temperature ratios to 2 : 5 scale Mach 7, 30 km altitude flight. Tunnel stagnation temperatures are measured and correlations to the fill pressures and stagnation pressure history are determined. The design and build of a two-dimensional wedge intake with isolator to determine intake starting limits by varying cowl position and shoulder angle is described. The isolator is shown to degrade starting characteristics by increasing the likelihood of internal choking. The implementation of a self-starting test, employing gas injection via <b>fast</b> <b>acting</b> <b>valves,</b> is implemented to demonstrate the self-starting characteristics of an axi-symmetric spike intake with internal contraction exceeding the Kantrowitz limit. Fuel injection and combustor back pressure are also simulated at angle of attack. Boundary layer trips are shown to significantly improve the operability of both models tested.

40|$|The {{prime focus}} {{of this study is}} to design a 50 mm {{internal}} diameter diaphragmless shock tube that can be used in an industrial facility for repeated loading of shock waves. The instantaneous rise in pressure and temperature of a medium can be used in a variety of industrial applications. We designed, fabricated and tested three different shock wave generators of which one system employs a highly elastic rubber membrane and the other systems use a <b>fast</b> <b>acting</b> pneumatic <b>valve</b> instead of conventional metal diaphragms. The valve opening speed is obtained with the help of a high speed camera. For shock generation systems with a pneumatic cylinder, it ranges from 0. 325 to 1. 15 m/s while it is around 8. 3 m/s for the rubber membrane. Experiments are conducted using the three diaphragmless systems and the results obtained are analyzed carefully to obtain a relation between the opening speed of the valve and the amount of gas that is actually utilized in the generation of the shock wave for each system. The rubber membrane is not suitable for industrial applications because it needs to be replaced regularly and cannot withstand high driver pressures. The maximum shock Mach number obtained using the new diaphragmless system that uses the pneumatic valve is 2. 125 +/- 0. 2 %. This system shows much promise for automation in an industrial environment...|$|R
