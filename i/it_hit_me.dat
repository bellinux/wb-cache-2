2500|$|An {{important}} {{moment in}} the progression of Coltrane's musical development occurred on June 5, 1945, when he saw Charlie Parker perform for the first time. In a DownBeat article in 1960 he recalled: [...] "the first time I heard Bird play, <b>it</b> <b>hit</b> <b>me</b> right between the eyes." [...] Parker became an early idol, and they played together on occasion in the late 1940s.|$|E

Boom, <b>it</b> <b>hit</b> <b>me!</b> That's the first time I realised the value of being an actor and how much this profession meant to me." [...] In 2011 she further stated, [...] "I felt even more charged to give my best and knew right then, that this was my calling, what I was born to do, {{to make a difference}} in people's lives, through my performances." ...|$|E

2500|$|His {{increased}} profile led {{to contact}} with other individuals, including musicians such as Elton John. John {{at that time was}} trying to assist British performers whom he personally liked to achieve success in the US (he had released records in the US by veteran British pop singer Cliff Richard on his own Rocket label). John tried to give Connolly a boost in America by using him as the opening act on his 1976 US tour. But the well-intentioned gesture was a failure. John's American fans had no interest in being warmed-up by an unknown comedic performer– especially a Scotsman whose accent they found incomprehensible. [...] "In Washington, some guy threw a pipe and <b>it</b> <b>hit</b> <b>me</b> right between my eyes", he told Michael Parkinson two years later. [...] "It wasn't my audience. They made me feel about as welcome as a fart in a spacesuit." ...|$|E
2500|$|Contractor led India to {{a series}} win against England in 1961–62 and captained the side to West Indies the same season. There, in the match against Barbados, his {{attention}} was momentarily distracted as he faced Charlie Griffith: [...] "It was as Griffith was to deliver the fourth ball of his second over that somebody opened a window in the pavilion. There were no sight screen {{at that time and}} my 100 per cent concentration wasn’t on that delivery. I saw it just inches away before <b>it</b> <b>hit</b> <b>me.</b> But it isn’t true that I ducked." [...] Contractor took a blow {{at the back of his}} skull and was unconscious for six days, requiring a blood transfusion, for which West Indies captain Frank Worrell was the first to donate his blood. Contractor's life was saved but his international career was abruptly ended as a result. In a recent interview, he mentioned as his only regret that he wanted play just one Test after the injury, but people did not want him to.|$|E
2500|$|... "Black Cat" [...] has {{influenced}} {{the production of}} numerous songs and inspired various artists to foray into the rock genre. Record producer RedOne was inspired by [...] "Black Cat" [...] for several songs on Nicole Scherzinger's debut album, Killer Love. Jessica Simpson considers the song an influence, saying [...] "Janet's music rocks," [...] citing [...] "Black Cat" [...] and [...] "Rhythm Nation" [...] specifically, adding [...] "Janet affects my music." [...] Fefe Dobson said the song was a primary influence for her third album Joy, saying [...] "I heard Janet’s ‘Black Cat,’ with its rock guitar riff. That’s what this album reflects." [...] Dobson explained, “Black Cat” incorporated a bunch {{of different types of}} music into one song. It was pop. It was punk. It was rock and roll. And I am all of those things. I think <b>it</b> <b>hit</b> <b>me</b> as a kid really hard, because I love to experience a fusion of musical genres." [...] Mexican singer Selena cited Jackson among her main influences; with Chris Pérez stating, [...] "Selena especially loved Jackson's song [...] "Black Cat" ... I can't even count how many times Selena and I listened to that single." [...] Solange Knowles also called the song an influence, saying, [...] "I remember I had a solo dance for a song of hers called 'Black Cat', and that was the start of my Janet love affair," [...] wearing a black unitard and cat ears. [...] Rihanna's single [...] "Rockstar 101" [...] was considered reminiscent of Jackson's pursuit, and she also worked with Nuno Bettencourt, the guitarist on the single edit of [...] "Black Cat," [...] during the song's live performances. Alanis Morissette's transition from dance-pop into alternative rock with Jagged Little Pill was partially inspired by the song, with author Paul Cantin writing, [...] "She may have been a fan of dance music, but when the band covered Janet Jackson's rock-flavoured song [...] "Black Cat," [...] her bandmates could see how eager she was to let go." [...] Singer-songwriter BJ the Chicago Kid cited Jackson's performance on the Rhythm Nation World Tour as an inspiration to enter the music industry, saying [...] "I remember seeing the Black Cat tour with Janet Jackson as a kid. They were wheeling a cage out on stage and there’s a black panther in there! I’m like a kid in the photographers pit like, ‘Woah.' She’s beautiful and I’m seeing a real live fucking cat.. [...] would later be signed to Motown Records and do the same thing. So they were instilling and pouring into my soul the whole time." ...|$|E

60|$|I did so, not {{at first}} aware what was his intention; but when I saw him lift and poise the book and stand in act to hurl it, I instinctively started aside with a cry of alarm: not soon enough, however; the volume was flung, <b>it</b> <b>hit</b> <b>me,</b> and I fell, {{striking}} {{my head against the}} door and cutting it. The cut bled, the pain was sharp: my terror had passed its climax; other feelings succeeded.|$|E

5000|$|When Jackson died, Feldman {{dedicated}} a Los Angeles hospital {{concert with}} his rock band Truth Movement to the singer. Feldman {{told the crowd}} Jackson was watching over the show.

I'm all shaken up right now. I had {{to do a lot of}} acting, basically, to get through the last 48 hours". Of the events of the week Jackson died, said Feldman, [...] "It was shocking, and I think I'm still in shock, to an extent. I don't think I have fully, completely come to terms with it yet. I have waves and flashes. One moment, I feel fine and I'm myself. Then all of a sudden, <b>it</b> <b>hits</b> <b>me,</b> and I go, 'Wow, he's really gone.' It's very troubling." ...|$|R

Ah! it came to me suddenly; <b>it</b> <b>hit</b> <b>me</b> like a stick whilst I was searching for you, having found that you had lost the waggon. It said to me, 'Ride to the top of Leopard's Kloof.

5000|$|Meyer's {{original}} {{vision for}} The Son {{was quite different}} from the final novel; it originally featured [...] "six or seven characters”, was [...] "set in the present day", and [...] "was conceived ... as a book about the rise of a family dynasty and America’s relationship with war and violence." [...] After {{two and a half years}} working on this version, Meyer realized that [...] "these characters were talking about this legendary guy, and they were commenting on the American myth, in a way.

60|$|DEAR MR.

It knocked every rag of sense out of my head, and I went flying {{here and there and}} yonder, not knowing what I was doing, and only one clearly defined thought standing up visible and substantial out of the crazy storm-drift that my dream of ten years was in desperate peril, and out of the 60,000 or 90,000 projects for its rescue that came floating through my skull, not one would hold still long enough for me to examine it and size it up.

6000|$|... "O! come, come," [...] said St. Clare, {{getting up}} quickly; [...] "what {{do you know}} about us?" [...] And he sat down to the piano, and rattled a lively piece of music. St. Clare had a decided genius for music. His touch was {{brilliant}} and firm, and his fingers flew over the keys with a rapid and bird-like motion, airy, and yet decided. He played piece after piece, like a man who is trying to play himself into a good humor. After pushing the music aside, he rose up, and said, gayly, [...] "Well, now, cousin, you've given us a good talk and done your duty; on the whole, I think the better of you for it.

60|$|It {{was not a}} very impassioned affair, and {{the exact}} {{particulars}} never of course reached me. It is quite by chance I know anything of it at all. One evening I was surprised to come upon my uncle in a mixture of Bohemia and smart people at an At Home in the flat of Robbert, the R.A. who painted my aunt, and he was standing a little apart in a recess, talking or rather being talked to in undertones by a plump, blond little woman in pale blue, a Helen Scrymgeour who wrote novels and was organising a weekly magazine. I elbowed a large lady who was saying something about them, but I didn't need to hear the thing she said to perceive the relationship of the two. <b>It</b> <b>hit</b> <b>me</b> like a placard on a hoarding. I was amazed the whole gathering did not see it. Perhaps they did. She was wearing a remarkably fine diamond necklace, much too fine for journalism, and regarding him with that quality of questionable proprietorship, of leashed but straining intimacy, that seems inseparable from this sort of affair. It is so much more palpable than matrimony. If anything was wanted to complete my conviction it was my uncles's eyes when presently he became aware of mine, a certain embarrassment and a certain pride and defiance. And the next day he made an opportunity to praise the lady's intelligence to me concisely, lest I should miss the point of it all.|$|E

Because, death has not been the end of my {{relationship}} and connection with my mother. With this presentation I remember the passing of my mother and I grapple with notions of time. In an effort to explore and conceptualise what I have learned about death and about life, and about time, I engage with my responses to death and dying, living, aging and im/mortality using poetry, image, and story. I ponder the close and dynamic relationship between writing and death, and how death, and life after death, has become a driving force of creativity, consciousness and meaning for me. This deepening of understanding cultivated by creative processes, methods and outputs offers new contexts for living and invites a questioning: Does death really have the last word...|$|R
