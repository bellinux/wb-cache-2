Low traces of lead were found on her hands and {{forehead}} at postmortem, but the levels were consistent with the everyday handling of things around the house. A scientist, Mr Elliott, testified that if she had loaded 18 cartridges into a magazine he would expect to see more lead on her hands. The {{blood on her}} nightdress was consistent with her own, and no trace of firearm-discharge residue was on it. Given that she was wearing just a nightdress, {{it was hard to see}} <b>how</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> have carried the cartridges.|$|E

The angel tells Mary that Jesus will speak in infancy, and when mature, will be a companion to the most righteous. Mary, responding <b>how</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> conceive and have a child when no man had touched her, {{was told by the}} angel that God can decree what He wills, and it shall come to pass.|$|E

Sometime after this, she met the witch-priestess, Ainet, who took her in and became her surrogate mother. Once, when their village {{was going through a}} terrible drought, Storm commanded rain for days just to help them. By doing this, she threw off the natural order of nature, and droughts were formed over numerous villages, and hundreds of animals were killed. Sensing the damage she had done, Ainet told Storm of her kind but ill-thought-out gesture, and of the damage she caused. Ainet took this opportunity to explain to Ororo how her powers worked with nature, and <b>how</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> fix the problem by properly distributing rain.|$|E
25|$|Back home, Selena learns {{from her}} father that Yolanda has been {{stealing}} money from the fan club. On March 9, 1995, Selena and her father, along with Suzette, confront Yolanda about the missing funds at a meeting. Yolanda denies this and says she would never take anything from Selena. Selena, angry and hurt by the betrayal, asks Yolanda <b>how</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> do this to her, and to her fans. Yolanda pleads for time to return the boutique's financial records and claims she can prove that she has done nothing wrong. Selena and Chris discuss the prospect of starting their family when the crossover tour is finished. The future seems bright with promise.|$|E
25|$|During the Riksdag of 1765, {{the queen}} {{attempted}} {{to balance the}} Caps and the Hats by creating a third party of her followers from both parties under her follower Malmstein, which she managed to have elected vice speaker. The election to the Riksdag of 1765 was won by the Caps party. By demonstrating <b>how</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> affect the votes in the parliament through her third party, {{she was able to}} secure her alliance with the Caps. She also summoned the Ambassador of Russia to Kina slott to secure support from Russia and its ally Denmark. When the question of the constitution was finally raised in the Riksdag in August, however, the Caps refused to accept an increased royal power and instead limited to power of the crown even more. With this, her efforts failed once again.|$|E

25|$|After feeling jilted by Bianca {{a second}} time in what she {{believes}} to be Bianca having chosen Babe as a lover, she enters into a romantic relationship with bad boy Jonathan Lavery. Maggie, unaware when finding Bianca in bed with Babe earlier {{that it was a}} ploy to trap JR into confessing that he framed Jamie, wraps herself deeply into Jonathan's life. It is not long before Jamie goes on the run with Babe, leaving Maggie without a roommate. She has Jonathan move in with her. Everything goes well with Jonathan at first, their relationship seeming to be more about sex in the beginning. Jonathan is even aware of Maggie's sexual confusion and asks her <b>how</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> have ever thought she was gay. Maggie says she was wrong. Although Bianca and Maggie share a second kiss together, Maggie stresses to Bianca that she is not a lesbian. Things begin to fall apart for Jonathan and Maggie's romance when she finds him destroying the shirt Bianca wore the night Miranda was born. Jonathan convinces Maggie that the shirt would have provided the evidence needed to prove that the Cambias heir, Ethan, is really a Cambias, and would have resulted in Jonathan's brother, the current heir to the Cambias fortune, Ryan, to lose everything. Maggie covers for him with Bianca.|$|E

500|$|Clinton {{received}} sustained {{national attention}} {{for the first}} time when her husband became a candidate for the 1992 Democratic presidential nomination. Before the New Hampshire primary, tabloid publications printed assertions that Bill Clinton had engaged in an extramarital affair with Gennifer Flowers. In response, the Clintons appeared together on 60 Minutes, where Bill denied the affair, but acknowledged [...] "causing pain in my marriage". This joint appearance was credited with rescuing his campaign. During the campaign, Hillary made culturally disparaging remarks about Tammy Wynette's outlook on marriage as described in her classic song [...] "Stand by Your Man", and later in the campaign about <b>how</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> have chosen to be like women staying home and baking cookies and having teas, but wanted to pursue her career instead. The remarks were widely criticized, particularly by those who were, or defended, stay-at-home mothers and in retrospect, were ill-considered by her own admission. Bill said that in electing him, the nation would [...] "get two for the price of one", referring to the prominent role his wife would assume. Beginning with Daniel Wattenberg's August 1992 The American Spectator article [...] "The Lady Macbeth of Little Rock", Hillary's own past ideological and ethical record came under attack from conservatives. At least twenty other articles in major publications also drew comparisons between her and Lady Macbeth.|$|E

500|$|Maria and Anastasia {{were dressed}} {{similarly}} for special occasions, when they wore {{variations of the}} same dress. She tended {{to be dominated by}} her enthusiastic and energetic younger sister. When Anastasia tripped people who walked by, teased others or caused a scene with her dramatics, Maria always tried to apologize, though she could never stop her younger sister. Maria had simple tastes and was so kind-hearted that she was sometimes taken advantage of by her sisters, who nicknamed her [...] "fat little bow-wow." [...] In 1910, her fourteen-year-old sister Olga persuaded ten-year-old Maria to write their mother a letter asking that Olga be given her own room and be allowed to let down her dresses. Maria tried to persuade her mother that it was her own idea to write the letter. Her mother's friend, Lili Dehn, said that while Maria was not as lively as her three sisters, she knew her own mind. Maria had a talent for drawing and sketched well, always using her left hand, but was generally uninterested in her schoolwork. She was surprisingly strong and sometimes amused herself by demonstrating <b>how</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> lift her tutors off the ground. Though usually sweet-natured, Maria could also be stubborn and occasionally lazy. Her mother complained in one letter that Maria was grumpy and [...] "bellowed" [...] at the people who irritated her. Maria's moodiness coincided with her menstrual period, which the Tsarina and her daughters referred to as a visit from [...] "Madame Becker." ...|$|E
500|$|When Madonna {{started writing}} {{the songs on}} the album, she was {{inspired}} by different situations, like having guitar lessons and getting an idea, or sometimes AhmadzaÃ¯ would send over a rough demo to her without the basic chord progression. The songs on American Life and their lyrics were developed like that. Explaining her writing process, Madonna told Q magazine that the [...] "music has to jar my brain in terms of lyrics. Sometimes I write free verse. I have a journal and I note down ideas I get from newspapers and books". Madonna also remembered AhmadzaÃ¯'s downbeat existentialism regarding the condition of society around them, and the long discussions they had into the night, which ultimately reflected into the songwriting as anxiety they felt in their heart. American Life was deemed {{by some as a}} concept album featuring political themes based around the United States, with Madonna explaining that she felt [...] "like America has changed over the years and that a lot of our values seem to be materially oriented and so superficial. And we all seem to be obsessed with fame {{just for the sake of}} fame, no matter whatâ sell your soul to the devil if that's what it takes. And we're also completely obsessed with the way we look." [...] Madonna recalled that even she had been through such trials and those musings came out in the writing of the first three songs, the title track, [...] "Hollywood" [...] and [...] "I'm So Stupid". John Norris from MTV described them as a trilogy, and an indicator of Madonna's reassessment of her life while discussing things she wishes to put behind her. Madonna partly agreed, saying that the tracks are extensions of one another, and portray her desire of giving importance to less noteworthy things, and <b>how</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> come out of that [...] "illusion". Madonna discussed the materialistic themes of the record and her personal encounters which have led to the composition with MTV saying: ...|$|E

[...] Interviewed by biographer Myra Friedman after his client's death, Giarritano said she had been baffled by <b>how</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> pursue a professional career as a singer without relapsing into drugs, and her drug-related memories from immediately prior to returning to Port Arthur continued to frighten her. Joplin sometimes brought an acoustic guitar with her to her sessions with Giarritano, and people in other offices within the building applauded after she finished singing a song.|$|E

Neff deduces she is contemplating murder, and makes it clear he wants no part of it. [...] However, he cannot {{get her out of}} his mind, and when Phyllis shows up at his apartment, he cannot resist her any longer. Neff knows all the tricks of his trade and devises a plan to make the murder of her husband appear to be an accidental fall from a train that will trigger the [...] "double indemnity" [...] clause and pay out twice the policy's face value.|$|E
2500|$|During her Janet World Tour, Jackson {{experienced}} an emotional breakdown, stemming from self-hatred, childhood humiliation, self-harm, and distorted body image. She stated, [...] "I was very, very sad. Very down. I couldn't get up sometimes. There {{were times when}} I felt very hopeless and helpless, and I felt like walls were kind of closing in on me...like you can't escape". She questioned her career path, feeling pressured by {{the demands of the}} entertainment industry, saying, [...] "People look at you differently, as if you're not human." [...] Abbie Kearse of MTV responded, [...] "You're creating a person who might not really be you, but you've created this fantasy woman, so when it's time to get back to business, it's like 'I've {{got to go back to}} that world'".

5000|$|Lee's act {{centered}} on <b>how</b> fast <b>she</b> <b>could</b> get her pastie propellers to spin and <b>how</b> dizzy <b>she</b> <b>could</b> make the audience. Due to her figure (42D" [...] - 26" [...] - 37), she {{became known as}} [...] "The Bazoom Girl," [...] "The Burlesque Version of Jayne Mansfield," [...] and eventually, [...] "Miss 44 and Plenty More". By the early fifties she broke into acting with minor roles in Peek-A-Boo (1953), Abandon (1958), Cold Wind in August (1961), and 3 Nuts in Search of a Bolt (1964) with Mamie Van Doren. Despite her ambitions of mainstream stardom, she found herself typecast in side roles, and never got her acting career off the ground.|$|R

You should send it to her, you know, she's making a record in London right now." [...] However, he claimed, [...] "If I was going to pitch something to her, I could probably dig something up, but it certainly wouldn't be this." [...] Later, his wife sent Madonna a copy of the demo, but it was so musically different from the record she was making that she didn't know <b>how</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> make any use out of it. After some time, he was talking to Madonna on the phone and she asked to rearrange the track to fit in better with the album, recording the song months later.

Taylforth reiterated her desire to return to EastEnders in 2013 and that she heard a writer in 2011 saying that producers wanted her to return and asked her if she could think of a way to bring Kathy back. She revealed that producer John Yorke told her that killing off Kathy was [...] "one of the biggest mistakes they've ever made", and the writer who had decided to kill off Kathy regretted it afterwards, though said it was a [...] "good idea at the time". EastEnders spokespeople stated there were currently no plans for Taylforth to return and that some of the producers who had said they wanted Kathy to return had since left. [...] In 2014, Taylforth revealed that she doubts whether Kathy is really dead and said that many EastEnders viewers have written with proposed storylines on <b>how</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> make a return to the show.|$|E
2500|$|In 1998, she {{appeared}} in her first film, a six-part direct to video documentary called The Legend of Atlantis: Return of the Lightmasters. The Australian television programme 60 Minutes challenged Jasmuheen to demonstrate <b>how</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> live without food and water. The supervising medical professional Dr Beres Wenck found that, after 48 hours, Jasmuheen displayed symptoms of acute dehydration, stress, and high blood pressure. Jasmuheen claimed {{that this was a}} result of [...] "polluted air". On the third day, she was moved to a mountainside retreat about 15 miles from the city, where she was filmed enjoying the fresh air, claiming she could now successfully practice Inedia. But as filming progressed, Jasmuheen's speech slowed, her pupils dilated, and she lost over a stone (6kg or 14lb) in weight. After four days, she acknowledged that she had lost weight, but stated that she felt fine. Dr. Wenck stated: [...] "You are now quite dehydrated, probably over 10%, getting up to 11%." [...] The doctor continued: [...] "Her pulse is about double what it was when she started. The risk if she goes any further is kidney failure." [...] Jasmuheen's condition continued to deteriorate rapidly due to acute dehydration, despite her contrary insistence. Dr Wenck concluded that continuing the experiment would ultimately prove fatal.
