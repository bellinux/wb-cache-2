25|$|As {{a private}} organization, the Committee {{followed}} normal business practice in allowing only duly authorized individual(s) {{to accept and}} endorse checks {{on behalf of the}} Committee. No financial institution could accept or process a check on behalf of the Committee unless a duly authorized individual endorsed it. The checks deposited into Barker's bank account were endorsed by Committee treasurer Hugh Sloan, who was authorized by the Finance Committee. However, once Sloan had endorsed a check made payable to the Committee, he had a legal and fiduciary responsibility to see that the check was deposited only into the accounts named on the check. Sloan failed to <b>do</b> <b>that.</b> <b>When</b> confronted with the potential charge of federal bank fraud, he revealed that Committee deputy director Jeb Magruder and finance director Maurice Stans had directed him to give the money to G. Gordon Liddy.|$|E
500|$|The Beatles met Kirchherr {{again in}} Hamburg in 1966 {{when they were}} touring Germany, and Kirchherr gave Lennon the letters he had written to Sutcliffe in 1961 and 1962. Lennon said it was [...] "the best present I've had in years". All of the Beatles wrote many letters to Kirchherr: [...] "I only have a couple from George , which I'll never show anyone, but he wrote so many. So did the others. I {{probably}} threw them away. You <b>do</b> <b>that</b> <b>when</b> you're young – you don't think of the future." [...] Harrison later asked Kirchherr to arrange the cover of his Wonderwall Music album in 1968.|$|E
500|$|As with {{previous}} ceremonies he produced, Cates centered the show around a theme. This year, he christened {{the show with}} the theme [...] "Togetherness of Moviegoing" [...] commenting, [...] "The thing that's kind of wonderful about movies is that you watch them with other people. The only other areas where you <b>do</b> <b>that,</b> <b>when</b> you think about it, are religion and sports." [...] He concluded by noting that the movie theater is [...] "a wonderful place where you come together to laugh, to cry." [...] In tandem with the theme, actress Winona Ryder presented a montage featuring film clips from Matinee, Casablanca, and A Streetcar Named Desire depicting audiences inside a movie theater.|$|E

500|$|U2's {{decision}} to allow free downloads of Songs of Innocence was questioned by musicians, including the Black Keys' Patrick Carney and Pink Floyd's Nick Mason. Buckcherry guitarist Keith Nelson believed it devalued music, saying U2 had [...] "sent a message to everyone that music is free, and that's disturbing. It's easy to <b>do</b> <b>that</b> <b>when</b> you're a multi-millionaire-billionaire and money isn't really something that you worry about, but when you're a working rock 'n' roll band and you count on every dollar, it's disappointing to see someone do that." [...] The Entertainment Retailers Association reported that UK sales of the band's back catalogue were minimal in the week following the album's release. The organisation's chairman Paul Quirk said: [...] "This vindicates our view that giving away {{hundreds of millions of}} albums simply devalues music and runs the risk of alienating the 60% of the population who are not customers of iTunes ... Giving away music like this is as damaging to the value of music as piracy." ...|$|E
2500|$|Navratilova and Evert {{met for the}} 1981 Australian Open finals. [...] The match's decisive set was up-and-down {{for both}} ladies, but Evert had an {{opportunity}} to win the match at four games to three, after having trailed Navratilova two games to three, and breaking her opponent's serve and holding serve herself. [...] But the unstoppable unrelenting fight in Navratilova made Evert play [...] "...tentative instead of hitting out, and I <b>do</b> <b>that</b> <b>when</b> I am nervous." [...] So, Evert lost the match in three sets 76, 46, 57.|$|E
2500|$|However, {{not all of}} Lopez's {{collaborators}} were new. She {{reunited with}} longtime collaborator, Rodney Jerkins (Darkchild) {{who has worked with}} Lopez numerous times in the past. Darkchild produced [...] "This Cannot Be Love", although the song did not make the final track listing for Love? It has similar introductory chords to [...] "The Boy Is Mine" [...] (1998) by Brandy Norwood and Monica. [...] "This Cannot Be Love" [...] has a progressive uptempo melody which continues to gather pace {{over the course of the}} song, while in the lyrics Lopez [...] "asks if true love exists." [...] When asked what inspired some of the album's records, Lopez told The Advocate, that whenever she records a new album she always thinks of dance music as it is popular in the gay community and club cultures. She said songs like [...] "This Cannot Be Love"have musicality similar to her worldwide hit, [...] "Waiting for Tonight" [...] (1999), which was well received by the LGBT community. [...] " [...] talks about the idea of getting lazy in love. You know how we <b>do</b> <b>that?</b> <b>When</b> you're with somebody and you're like: Wait a minute— remember when we were so in love and obsessed with each other? What happened?" ...|$|E

2500|$|Prior to the 1978 season, Oakland owner Finley again {{sought to}} discard Coleman, {{asking him to}} report to the Athletics' minor league club in Vancouver. [...] Coleman refused and {{compiled}} a 3–0 record and a 0.00 ERA in his first eight appearances of the 1978 season. [...] Coleman had a 1.37 ERA when he was sold by Oakland to the Toronto Blue Jays for the waiver price of $10,000. [...] Finley reportedly [...] "blew his top" [...] after Coleman gave up a home run to Chicago's Lamar Johnson. Bobby Winkles resigned as Oakland's manager after Finley's impulsive decision to sell the club's most effective relief pitcher. [...] Days later, Finley offered to buy Coleman back from Toronto for double the price Toronto had paid. Blue Jays' president, Peter Bavasi, declined Finley's proposal, suspecting that Finley had found another team prepared to pay more for Coleman. [...] Coleman noted {{at the time that he}} was happy to escape Finley. [...] After his bid to reacquire Coleman was rejected, Finley claimed he had only wanted to reacquire Coleman to trade him to Pittsburgh and lashed out at Coleman: [...] "He's a very fine old man, but all he does is throw that slop up there. Maybe he can do all right. He doesn't throw hard enough now to break a pane of glass. He was spending his spare time trying to teach our young guys to pitch. [...] How can he <b>do</b> <b>that</b> <b>when</b> he can't pitch himself?" ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{top three}} {{finishers}} of each category {{appeared on the}} podium to collect their trophies and in a later press conference. All three of the No. 1 Audi drivers felt their turbocharger problem cost them the victory, with Lotterer saying, [...] "When we had the turbo problem we were very disappointed because it's impossible {{to come back from}} that. We were a bit unlucky, but at Le Mans you never know {{what is going to happen}} and the team motivated me again - they did a great job." [...] Fässler added the team attempted to pressure Toyota but they were unable to catch the Japanese manufacturer: [...] "But this time everyone had problems. We had to be flat out and have no penalties - it isn't easy to <b>do</b> <b>that</b> <b>when</b> you are pushing." [...] Tréluyer stated that winning Le Mans was [...] "emotional" [...] and praised the engineers strategy. The driver felt their approach was like their 2011 victory: [...] "We concentrated on our own race and took the car through until morning. It was the car which had the least bad luck that won.” Kristensen stated he was not unhappy to finish in second and that while his team would have liked to have had their [...] "little fairy tale" [...] it was still a good result. Di Grassi said it had been [...] "a difficult race" [...] for his team but hoped to return to Le Mans in the future while Gené revealed that did not expect a strong result but that second was [...] "like a fairytale for me." ...|$|E

5000|$|In 1961, it was Young {{who first}} {{suggested}} {{the idea of}} putting an asterisk on Roger Maris' home run total, should the Yankee right fielder fail to catch or surpass Babe Ruth in the first 154 games of the season, saying [...] "Everyone <b>does</b> <b>that</b> <b>when</b> there's a difference of opinion." ...|$|R
