5|$|A new {{main drain}} to Wiggenhall St Germans was {{completed}} in 1848, which provided better drainage because the outfall was lower than that at Salters Lode. Whittlesey Mere, the last remaining lake, was drained soon afterwards, {{using one of the}} first applications of John Appold's centrifugal pump, following its appearance at the Great Exhibition in 1851. Traffic on the network began to diminish after the opening of the railway through March in 1846, and fell <b>dramatically</b> <b>in</b> the early twentieth century. The last regular commercial traffic was the tanker barge Shellfen, which delivered fuel oil to pumping stations until 1971.|$|E
5|$|Although most methamphetamine users {{lived in}} Asia {{in the early}} 2000s, {{the use of the}} drug {{increased}} <b>dramatically</b> <b>in</b> {{other parts of the world}} in that decade. In areas where use of the drug has become common, meth mouth is often widespread. The condition is expensive to treat and has strained public health resources, prompting concerns among dental authorities in several countries about the burden of treatment.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{widespread}} use of poliovirus vaccine in the mid-1950s, the incidence of poliomyelitis declined <b>dramatically</b> <b>in</b> many industrialized countries. A global effort to eradicate polio began in 1988, led by the World Health Organization, UNICEF, and The Rotary Foundation. These efforts have reduced the number of annual diagnosed cases by 99.9 percent; from an estimated 350,000 cases in 1988 to a low of 483 cases in 2001, after which it remained at a level of about 1,000 - 2000 cases per year for a number of years. In 2015, cases decreased to 98 and further decreased in 2016 to 37 wild cases and 5 circulating vaccine-derived cases.|$|E

5|$|In {{order to}} {{advocate}} for the many thousands of returned servicemen and women many ex-services organisations sprang up. The most prominent of these was probably the Returned Sailors and Soldiers Imperial League of Australia which had been established in 1916 by representatives from many state-based organisations already in existence. Following the war this organisation grew in its political influence as its numbers grew and was very active in the repatriation process, advocating for financial entitlements for veterans and securing concessions for soldiers returning to civilian employment. By 1919 it was estimated to have 150,000 members although this fell <b>dramatically</b> <b>in</b> the mid-1920s.|$|E
5|$|Once fusion begins, the {{temperature}} of the white dwarf increases. A main sequence star supported by thermal pressure can expand and cool which automatically regulates the increase in thermal energy. However, degeneracy pressure is independent of temperature; white dwarfs are unable to regulate temperature in the manner of normal stars, so they are vulnerable to runaway fusion reactions. The flare accelerates <b>dramatically,</b> <b>in</b> part due to the Rayleigh–Taylor instability and interactions with turbulence. It is still a matter of considerable debate whether this flare transforms into a supersonic detonation from a subsonic deflagration.|$|E
5|$|Outside of London and the South East, {{the use of}} {{regional}} airports has increased <b>dramatically</b> <b>in</b> recent years, {{with the amount of}} air traffic using these facilities doubling in the period 1995 to 2005. To illustrate this growth, in the five years from 2001 passenger numbers at the regional airports of Exeter International Airport, Bristol International Airport, and Newcastle Airport increased by 191 per cent, 113 per cent, and 60 per cent respectively. In the same period the largest airports experienced some of the slowest growth, with Heathrow passenger numbers increasing by 11 per cent, and those of Gatwick increasing by less than 10 per cent.|$|E

Their eleven round-robin games also included a record 96–19 win over the Waratahs in the final match of the round-robin stage, which was especially noteworthy given that both teams finished {{at the top of the}} table.|$|E
5|$|The {{eccentricity}} {{of their}} orbits causes regular flexing {{of the three}} moons' shapes, with Jupiter's gravity stretching them out as they approach it and allowing them to spring back to more spherical shapes as they swing away. This tidal flexing heats the moons' interiors by friction. This is seen most <b>dramatically</b> <b>in</b> the extraordinary volcanic activity of innermost Io (which {{is subject to the}} strongest tidal forces), and to a lesser degree in the geological youth of Europa's surface (indicating recent resurfacing of the moon's exterior).|$|E
5|$|The killer whale's intelligence, trainability, {{striking}} appearance, playfulness {{in captivity}} and sheer size {{have made it}} a popular exhibit at aquaria and aquatic theme parks. From 1976 to 1997, 55 whales {{were taken from the}} wild in Iceland, 19 from Japan, and three from Argentina. These figures exclude animals that died during capture. Live captures fell <b>dramatically</b> <b>in</b> the 1990s, and by 1999, about 40% of the 48 animals on display in the world were captive-born.|$|E

In addition to improving access to antiretroviral therapy, in 2008, Malawi introduced the World Health Organization's treatment guidelines for antiretroviral therapy, which improved the quality of treatment available to Malawians. However, Malawi's proposal for a new antiretroviral treatment plan in 2011, which would have cost $105 million per year, {{was rejected by the}} Global Fund, threatening Malawi's ability to continue expanding access to antiretroviral treatment.|$|E
5|$|This changed <b>dramatically</b> <b>in</b> the 2000s (decade), {{when the}} University started a {{campaign}} to {{increase the size of}} the endowment. At the close of fiscal year 2004–2005, the endowment had risen to $1.325 billion, raising the University to sixth of the 11 Big Ten schools in terms of endowment; within $2 million of the fifth-rated school. The rapid increase {{in the size of the}} endowment will help to improve outdated facilities, such as the Music Building, which the College of Music hopes to soon replace with money from its alumni fundraising program.|$|E
5|$|Two {{artists that}} changed the comics {{industry}} <b>dramatically</b> <b>in</b> the late 1960s were Neal Adams, considered one of his country's greatest draftsmen, and Jim Steranko. Both artists expressed a cinematic approach at times that occasionally altered the more conventional panel-based format that had been commonplace for decades. Adams' breakthrough was based on layout and rendering. Best known for returning Batman to his somber roots after the campy success of the Batman television show, his naturalistic depictions of anatomy, faces, and gestures changed comics' style {{in a way that}} Strausbaugh sees reflected in modern graphic novels.|$|E

5|$|Unlike {{southern}} cities at the time, Chicago did not segregate {{most public}} accommodations. According to Walter Francis White of the NAACP, pre-1915 Chicago {{had a good}} reputation for equitable treatment of African Americans. However, unofficially, early 20th-century Chicago beaches were racially segregated. African Americans {{had a long history}} in Chicago, the city sending its first African-American representative to the state legislature in 1876. However, the black population in 1900 was only about 1 percent, while it expanded <b>dramatically</b> <b>in</b> {{the early years of the}} century. Most Irish Americans and African Americans competed for low-end jobs, causing tension between the groups.|$|E
5|$|Western {{attitudes towards}} killer whales have changed <b>dramatically</b> <b>in</b> recent decades. In the mid-1960s and early 1970s, killer whales came to much greater public and {{scientific}} awareness, {{starting with the}} first live-capture and display of a killer whale known as Moby Doll, a resident harpooned off Saturna Island in 1964. So little was known at the time, it was nearly {{two months before the}} whale's keepers discovered what food (fish) it was willing to eat. To the surprise of those who saw him, Moby Doll was a docile, nonaggressive whale that made no attempts to attack humans.|$|E
5|$|With {{improvements}} in communications by rail and via the port, {{the population of}} Odense grew <b>dramatically</b> <b>in</b> the early 20th century. The 1901 census recorded 40,138 people, growing to 47,224 in 1911, 61,969 in 1921 and 87,090 in 1935. During the Second World War, the population passed the 100,000 mark, reaching 103,107 in 1945. It continued {{to grow in the}} post war years, with 120,570 recorded in 1955 and 133,384 in 1965; the city reached a population of 139,490 people in 1970, {{a time when it was}} developing as a university city after Odense University was established in 1966.|$|E
