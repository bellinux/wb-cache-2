40|$|An {{investigation}} was initiated {{to determine the}} cause of coating spallation occurring on the Shuttle Orbiter's wing leading edge panels in the slip-side <b>joggle</b> region. The coating spallation events were observed, post flight, on differing panels on different missions. As part of the investigation, the high re-entry heating occurring on the <b>joggles</b> was considered here as a possible cause. Thus, a thermostructural evaluation was conducted to determine the detailed state-of-stress in the <b>joggle</b> region during re-entry and the feasibility of a laboratory test on a local <b>joggle</b> specimen to replicate this state-of-stress. A detailed three-dimensional finite element model of a panel slip-side <b>joggle</b> region was developed. Parametric and sensitivity studies revealed significant stresses occur in the <b>joggle</b> during peak heating. A critical interlaminar normal stress concentration was predicted in the substrate at the coating interface and was confined to the curved <b>joggle</b> region. Specifically, the high interlaminar normal stress is identified to be the cause for the occurrence of failure in the form of local subsurface material separation occurring in the slip-side <b>joggle.</b> The predicted critical stresses are coincident with material separations that had been observed with microscopy in <b>joggle</b> specimens obtained from flight panels...|$|R

6000|$|A month {{afterward}} I enjoyed {{my first}} earthquake. It was one which was long called the [...] "great" [...] earthquake, and is doubtless so distinguished till this day. It {{was just after}} noon, on a bright October day. I was coming down Third street. The only objects in motion anywhere in sight in that thickly built and populous quarter, were {{a man in a}} buggy behind me, and a street car wending slowly up the cross street. Otherwise, all was solitude and a Sabbath stillness. As I turned the corner, around a frame house, there was a great rattle and jar, and {{it occurred to me that}} here was an item!--no doubt a fight in that house. Before I could turn and seek the door, there came a really terrific shock; the ground seemed to roll under me in waves, interrupted by a violent <b>joggling</b> up and down, and there was a heavy grinding noise as of brick houses rubbing together. I fell up against the frame house and hurt my elbow. I knew what it was, now, and from mere reportorial instinct, nothing else, took out my watch and noted the time of day; at that moment a third and still severer shock came, and as I reeled about on the pavement trying to keep my footing, I saw a sight! The entire front of a tall four-story brick building in Third street sprung outward like a door and fell sprawling across the street, raising a dust like a great volume of smoke! And here came the buggy--overboard went the man, and in less time than I can tell it the vehicle was distributed in small fragments along three hundred yards of street.|$|E
40|$|Linear elastic, thermo-mechanical stress {{analyses}} of the Space Shuttle Orbiter wing-leading-edge panels is presented for entry heating conditions. The wing-leading-edge panels are made from reinforced carbon-carbon {{and serve as a}} part of the overall thermal protection system. Three-dimensional finite element models are described for three configurations: integrated configuration, an independent single-panel configuration, and a local lower-apex <b>joggle</b> segment. Entry temperature conditions are imposed and the through-the-thickness response is examined. From the integrated model, it was concluded that individual panels can be analyzed independently since minimal interaction between adjacent components occurred. From the independent single-panel model, it was concluded that increased through-the-thickness stress levels developed all along the chord of a panel s slip-side <b>joggle</b> region, and hence isolated local <b>joggle</b> sections will exhibit the same trend. From the local <b>joggle</b> models, it was concluded that two-dimensional plane-strain models can be used to study the influence of subsurface defects along the slip-side <b>joggle</b> region of these panels...|$|R

After experimenting with balls and beanbags in his first <b>joggling</b> marathons, beginning with his record-setting run he joggled using handmade beanbags filled with millet.

40|$|Abstract: Both {{normal and}} <b>joggle</b> double lap joints were {{numerical}} analyzed {{to get the}} stress distribution in mid-bondline and in adherends near the interface using the finite element method (FEM). The results from the numerical simulation show that nearly all the peak values of the stress components {{as well as the}} von Mises equivalent stress distributed in both mid-bondline and adherend near the interface of the adhesively bonded <b>joggle</b> double lap joint are significantly decreased to the normal one. It was pointed out that the load bearing capacity of the <b>joggle</b> double lap joint may be higher than that of the double lap joint for its decrease of peak stress, much evenly stress distribution in the middle part of the overlap zone so that more load can be subjected by the <b>joggle</b> double lap joint...|$|R

50|$|<b>Joggling</b> was {{conceived}} by Bill Giduz in 1975. The first official <b>joggling</b> event {{took place at}} the 1981 International Jugglers' Association festival in North Dakota. The sport has two primary rules: a runner must juggle at least three objects every step of the way, and if the object drops, the runner must pick it up and continue running from the point where the drop occurred. Kapral first learned of <b>joggling</b> at the age of 11, when he saw the world record listed in The Guinness Book of World Records, and started running after graduating from college. He completed his first marathon in 1999, and in 2002 won the Toronto Marathon with a time of 2:30:40, his best overall marathon time. Earlier that year, he was the top Canadian finisher at the Boston Marathon.|$|E
