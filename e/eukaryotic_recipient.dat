40|$|Historically, {{the members}} of the Agrobacterium genus have been {{considered}} the only bacterial species naturally able to transfer and integrate DNA into the genomes of their eukaryotic hosts. Yet, increasing evidence suggests that this ability to genetically transform eukaryotic host cells might be more widespread in the bacterial world. Indeed, analyses of accumulating genomic data reveal cases of horizontal gene transfer from bacteria to eukaryotes and suggest that it represents a significant force in adaptive evolution of eukaryotic species. Specifically, recent reports indicate that bacteria other than Agrobacterium, such as Bartonella henselae (a zoonotic pathogen), Rhizobium etli (a plant-symbiotic bacterium related to Agrobacterium), or even Escherichia coli, have the ability to genetically transform their host cells under laboratory conditions. This DNA transfer relies on type IV secretion systems (T 4 SSs), the molecular machines that transport macromolecules during conjugative plasmid transfer and also during transport of proteins and/or DNA to the <b>eukaryotic</b> <b>recipient</b> cells. In this review article, we explore the extent of possible transfer of genetic information from bacteria to eukaryotic cells as well as the evolutionary implications and potential applications of this transfer...|$|E
40|$|With {{the rapid}} {{accumulation}} of genomic information from various eukaryotes {{in the last}} decade, genes proposed to have been derived from recent horizontal gene transfer (HGT) events have been reported even in non-phagotrophic unicellular and multicellular organisms, but the molecular pathways underlying HGT remain to be explained. The development of in vitro HGT detection systems, which permit the molecular and genetic analyses of donor and recipient organisms and quantify HGT, are helpful {{in order to gain}} insight into mechanisms that may contribute to contemporary HGT events or may have contributed to past HGT events. We applied a horizontal DNA transfer system model based on conjugal gene transfer called trans-kingdom conjugation (TKC) from the prokaryote Escherichia coli to the eukaryote Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and assessed whether and to what extent genetic variations in the <b>eukaryotic</b> <b>recipient</b> affect its receptivity to TKC. Strains from a collection of 4, 823 knock-out mutants of S. cerevisiae MAT-a haploids were tested for their individual TKC receptivity. Two types of mutants, an ssd 1 mutant and respiratory mutants, which are also found in experimental strains and in nature widely, were identified as highly receptive mutants. The TKC efficiency for spontaneously accrued petite (rho 2 / 0) mutants of the functional allele (SSD 1 -V) strain showed increased receptivity. The TKC efficiency of the ssd 1 D mutant was 36 % for bacterial conjugation, while that of the petite/ssd 1 D double mutants was even higher (220 % in average) compared to bacterial conjugation. This increased TKC receptivity was also observed when other conjugal transfer systems were applie...|$|E
40|$|Cell {{transformation}} {{is an essential}} process for molecular, cellular and genetic research mainly in creating transgenic animals. One {{of the most important}} categories of cell trans-formation experiments is transfection – the intro-duction of foreign DNA into a <b>recipient</b> <b>eukaryotic</b> cell with subsequent integration into chromosomal DNA of the <b>recipient</b> <b>eukaryotic</b> cell (Etches et al., 1997). Liposome-mediated transfection (lipofection) is a simple and powerful technique for DNA transfer into cultured cells (Chiang, 1991; Dickinson, 2002). Lipofection is suitable for the transfection of primary cells with either circular or linear DNA for stable and transient transfection. Disadvantages consist in possible toxicity (Lamb, 1993). e underlying mechanism is not completely understood, but it is known that the positively charged liposomes form aggregates with negatively charged DNA. e aggregates carrying a positive net charge are then attracted to the negatively polarized cell membrane and enter the cells via endocytosis (Buchberger, 1996). Transfection experiments can be performed in two ways: transient transfection is usually followed by the gene expression driven from unintegrated foreign DNA. On the other hand, stable trans-fection requires foreign DNA to integrate stably into the host cell chromosomes and to replicate together with the host genome. Other methods have been developed to transport molecules (that are normally prohibited from crossing the cell membrane into the cytoplasm or nucleus of pluripotent cells) : via microparticle bombardment (Muramatsu, 1997), electroporation (Aritomi, 2000), via retrovirus (Nagano, 2000), and virofec-tion-mediated transfection (Flamant et al., 1994). Instead of the virus-mediated transfer of foreign DNA, the nonviral vectors such as direct injection of foreign DNA or lipid-mediated systems are used but the transfection efficiency is relatively low (oraval et al., 2000). Electroporation – the application of an electric field to cells creates temporary pores in the cell membrane. e pores allow exogenous molecules Transfection of cock spermatogonial cells via electroporation and lipofectio...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe Type VI {{secretion}} system (T 6 SS) is {{a widespread}} macromolecular structure that delivers protein effectors to both <b>eukaryotic</b> and prokaryotic <b>recipient</b> cells. The current model describes the T 6 SS as an inverted phage tail composed of a sheath-like structure wrapped around a tube assembled by stacked Hcp hexamers. Although recent {{progress has been made}} to understand T 6 SS sheath assembly and dynamics, {{there is no evidence that}} Hcp forms tubes in vivo. Here we show that Hcp interacts with TssB, a component of the T 6 SS sheath. Using a cysteine substitution approach, we demonstrate that Hcp hexamers assemble tubes in an ordered manner with a head-to-tail stacking that are used as a scaffold for polymerization of the TssB/C sheath-like structure. Finally, we show that VgrG but not TssB/C controls the proper assembly of the Hcp tubular structure. These results highlight the conservation in the assembly mechanisms between the T 6 SS and the bacteriophage tail tube/sheath...|$|R
40|$|A {{procedure}} {{has been}} developed to allow the recovery of an integrated plasmid genome from a transformed cell, together with {{large areas of the}} flanking DNA sequences. DNA from Saccharomyces cerevisiae BAS 2, in which the pBR 322 [...] ura 3 plasmid (Y 1 p 5) is integrated at the yeast histone H 2 A and H 2 B locus, was used to generate a cosmid library, using a new cosmid vector (pTL 5) that is ampicillin sensitive and tetracycline resistant. Colonies were selected for ampicillin resistance, which was conferred by the incorporation of the integrated pBR 322 beta-lactamase gene into the recombinant cosmid. Restriction enzyme and blot hybridization analyses show that the rescued clones contain the yeast histone genes in addition to the Y 1 p 5 sequences; a total of approximately 50 kilobase pairs of DNA sequences flanking the plasmid was recovered as a series of overlapping cosmids. This approach should allow the recovery of most genes that can be linked to a marker pBR 322 sequence and for which a specific phenotype can be selected in a <b>recipient</b> <b>eukaryotic</b> cell...|$|R
40|$|Trans-kingdom {{conjugation}} is {{a phenomenon}} by which DNA is transferred into a eukaryotic cell by a bacterial conjugal transfer system. Improvement in this method to facilitate the rapid co-cultivation of donor bacterial and <b>recipient</b> <b>eukaryotic</b> cell cultures could make it the simplest transformation method, requiring neither isolation of vector DNA nor preparation of competent recipient cells. To evaluate this potential advantage of trans-kingdom conjugation, we examined this simple transformation method using vector combinations, helper plasmids, and recipient Saccharomyces cerevisiae strains. Mixing donor Escherichia coli and recipient S. cerevisiae overnight cultures (50 μL each) consistently yielded {{on the order of}} 10 (1) transformants using the popular experimental strain BY 4742 derived from S 288 c and a shuttle vector for trans-kingdom conjugation. Transformation efficiency increased to the order of 10 (2) using a high receptivity trans-kingdom conjugation strain. In addition, either increasing the amount of donor cells or pretreating the recipient cells with thiols such as dithiothreitol improved the transformation efficiency by one order of magnitude. This simple trans-kingdom conjugation-mediated transformation method {{could be used as a}} practical yeast transformation method upon enrichment of available vectors and donor E. coli strains...|$|R
40|$|Type IV {{secretion}} systems {{direct transport}} of protein or nucleoprotein complexes across the cell envelopes of prokaryotic donor and <b>eukaryotic</b> or prokaryotic <b>recipient</b> cells. The process is mediated by a membrane-spanning multiprotein assembly. Potential NTPases {{belonging to the}} VirB 11 family are {{an essential part of}} the membrane-spanning complex. Three representatives of these NTPases originating from the conjugative trans-fer regions of plasmids RP 4 (TrbB) and R 388 (TrwD) and from the cag pathogenicity island of Helicobacter pylori (HP 0525) were overproduced and purified in native form. The proteins display NTPase activity with distinct substrate specificities in vitro. TrbB shows its highest specific hydrolase activity with dATP, and the preferred substrate for HP 0525 is ATP. Analysis of defined TrbB mutations altered in motifs conserved within the VirB 11 protein family shows that there is a correlation between the loss or reduction of NTPase activity and transfer frequency. Tryptophan fluorescence spectroscopy of TrbB and HP 0525 suggests that both interact with phospholipid membranes, changing their conformation. NTPase activity of both proteins was stimulated by the addition of certain phospholipids. According to our results, Virb 11 -like proteins seem to most likely be involved in the assembly of the membrane-spanning multiprotein complex. Translocation of macromolecules across the cell envelope of gram-negative bacteria is facilitated by multiprotein complexe...|$|R
