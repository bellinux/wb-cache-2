40|$|<b>Heat</b> <b>pipes</b> {{have been}} investigated, {{developed}} and applied in many industrial fields since 1964. However, <b>heat</b> <b>pipe</b> technology {{is still a}} relatively new topic in high heat flux environments such as are encountered in the metallurgical and energy industries. This study focused {{on the development of}} a novel <b>heat</b> <b>pipe</b> that can be used under high heat flux conditions. The state of the technology prior to this study was that <b>heat</b> <b>pipes</b> were not suitable for high heat flux applications. Even though numerous patents have been granted for <b>heat</b> <b>pipes</b> and related applications, most are based on the basic concepts of the conventional <b>heat</b> <b>pipe</b> as detailed in the literature. Researchers have found {{that there are a number}} of problems with these <b>heat</b> <b>pipes</b> when they are applied in high heat flux environments. Thus, it was a prime objective of this study to develop a novel <b>heat</b> <b>pipe</b> that is suitable for such high heat flux operations. In addition, some basic fundamental issues regarding the overall makeup of <b>heat</b> <b>pipes</b> were also investigated and explained. The fundamental study showed that the film boiling phenomenon can be a serious problem when a conventional <b>heat</b> <b>pipe</b> is used under high heat flux conditions. Film boiling can make a conventional <b>heat</b> <b>pipe</b> lose its ability for sustained heat transfer with a small temperature gradient. The flow modified <b>heat</b> <b>pipe</b> that was invented and studied eliminates film boiling in the evaporator of the <b>heat</b> <b>pipe.</b> In this kind of <b>heat</b> <b>pipe,</b> a flow-modifier element was introduced into the <b>heat</b> <b>pipe</b> chamber to improve the heat transfer of the two-phase flow. The experimental data indicated that the flow modified <b>heat</b> <b>pipe</b> was dramatically better than a conventional <b>heat</b> <b>pipe</b> under a comparable high heat flux load. This novel <b>heat</b> <b>pipe</b> successfully combined the flow modified <b>heat</b> <b>pipe</b> and the loop <b>heat</b> <b>pipe</b> and, thus, effectively overcame film boiling by collapsing the formed films. It was shown that the novel <b>heat</b> <b>pipes</b> are suitable for high heat flux and high temperature operation where conventional <b>heat</b> <b>pipes</b> will only function at a fraction of the heat load...|$|R

40|$|Graduation date: 1993 Conventional {{stainless}} steel - water and ceramic fabric composite water <b>heat</b> <b>pipes</b> {{have been built}} and tested. The tests have been conducted to compare the performance characteristics between conventional and fabric composite <b>heat</b> <b>pipe</b> radiators for space nuclear power heat rejection systems. The fabric composite concept combines a strong ceramic fabric with a thin metal liner to form a very lightweight <b>heat</b> <b>pipe.</b> The <b>heat</b> <b>pipes</b> tested have used identical, homogeneous fabric wicks and water as the working fluid. One fabric composite <b>heat</b> <b>pipe</b> has been constructed by fitting a braided aluminoborosilicate fabric tube over {{the outside of the}} conventional {{stainless steel}} <b>heat</b> <b>pipe.</b> A more advanced fabric composite design combines the woven fabric with a 0. 25 mm (10 mil) stainless steel tube as the liner, and reduces the mass of the <b>heat</b> <b>pipe</b> by a factor of three. A <b>heat</b> <b>pipe</b> testing facility was designed and built for the purpose of testing various conventional and fabric composite <b>heat</b> <b>pipes.</b> This facility allows the testing of <b>heat</b> <b>pipes</b> in a vacuum, at low temperatures, and can accommodate a variety of <b>heat</b> <b>pipe</b> designs.

40|$|A {{nitrogen}} <b>heat</b> <b>pipe</b> was designed, {{built and}} {{tested for the}} purpose of providing a thermal shunt between the two stages of a Gifford-McMahan (GM) cryocooler during cooldown. The nitrogen <b>heat</b> <b>pipe</b> has an operating temperature range between 63 and 123 K. While the <b>heat</b> <b>pipe</b> is in the temperature range during the system cooldown, it acts as a thermal shunt {{between the first and second}} stage of the cryocooler. The <b>heat</b> <b>pipe</b> increases the <b>heat</b> transfer to the first stage of the cryocooler, thereby reducing the cooldown time of the system. When the <b>heat</b> <b>pipe</b> temperature drops below the triple point, the nitrogen working fluid freezes, effectively stopping the <b>heat</b> <b>pipe</b> operation. A small heat leak between cryocooler stages remains because of axial conduction along the <b>heat</b> <b>pipe</b> wall.

50|$|Grooved wicks {{are used}} in {{spacecraft}} <b>heat</b> <b>pipes,</b> {{as shown in the}} first photograph in this section. The <b>heat</b> <b>pipes</b> are formed by extruding aluminum, and typically have an integral flange to increase the heat transfer area, which lowers the temperature drop. Grooved wicks {{are used in}} spacecraft, instead of the screen or sintered wicks used for terrestrial <b>heat</b> <b>pipes,</b> since the <b>heat</b> <b>pipes</b> don’t have to operate against gravity in space. This allows spacecraft <b>heat</b> <b>pipes</b> to be several meters long, in contrast to the roughly 25 cm maximum length for a water <b>heat</b> <b>pipe</b> operating on Earth.

50|$|On the Rügen narrow-gauge network, Görlitz {{counterweight}} brakes {{were used}} to start with. In 1965 they began {{to be replaced by}} compressed air brakes. In contrast to many other narrow-gauge routes, the pipe couplings were arranged symmetrically on the vehicles. Because the original engines did not have any <b>heating</b> <b>pipe</b> couplings, the passenger coaches had to be equipped with stoves. Even the coaches that replaced them in the 1960s from Saxon railways were retrofitted with stoves. From the outset until today, buffer and chain couplers (:de:Balancierhebelkupplung) have been used.

50|$|The Market Church has not {{undergone}} any permanent {{changes to}} its {{external and internal}} appearance during its history. During the air raid on the centre of Halle shortly {{before the end of}} the war on 31 March 1945 it was, however, badly damaged. One bomb penetrated between the northern Watchmen's Tower and the nave (Langschiff) and tore one of the two pillars of the northern colonnade away, whereby part of the vaulted ceiling collapsed. That damaged the bronze font by Meister Ludolf. As a result of the artillery bombardment on 16 April 1945 the tracery window on the west front behind the organ was shattered, and the church roof and spires of the Watchmen's Towers damaged. The restoration work lasted from January 1946 to the beginning of 1948. Major repairs had to begin in 1967, when the entire interior and furnishings were badly damaged by a burst district <b>heating</b> <b>pipe,</b> which was part of the church heating system. The subsequent repair in the years from 1968 to 1983 was one of the biggest monument maintenance and restoration projects of the East German period. The work was conducted under the direction of the Institute for the Preservation of Historic Monuments. (Institut für Denkmalpflege). It was decided to restore, as far as possible, its appearance in the 16th century. For example, even the original polyptych was returned to its old spot and Hübner's altarpiece was brought out of the sacristy and displayed behind it.|$|E
