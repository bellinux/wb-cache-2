5|$|The U.K. {{government}} attempted several {{measures to}} revive the London foreign exchange market, the most notable of which were implemented on September 5 to extend the previous moratorium through October and allow the Bank of England to temporarily loan funds to be paid back upon {{the end of the}} war in an effort to settle outstanding or unpaid acceptances for currency transactions. By mid-October, the London market began functioning properly as a result of the September measures. The war continued to present unfavorable circumstances for the foreign exchange market, such as the London Stock Exchange's prolonged closure, the redirection of economic resources to support a transition from producing exports to producing military armaments, and myriad disruptions of freight and mail. The pound sterling enjoyed general stability throughout World War I, in large part due to various steps taken by the U.K. government to influence the pound's value in ways that yet provided individuals with the freedom to continue trading currencies. Such measures included open market interventions on foreign exchange, borrowing in foreign currencies rather than in pounds sterling to finance war activities, outbound capital controls, and limited <b>import</b> <b>restrictions.</b>|$|E
5|$|On October 18, 2013, Charlene Johnson, the {{minister}} responsible for trade, along with Fisheries minister Keith Hutchings {{announced that the}} government supported the agreement in principle for CETA, that had been announced early that day. The ministers said the trade agreement would a game changer for the fishing industry. The agreement would eliminate MPRs for the European Union {{three years after the}} ratification of the deal, which is expected to occur in 2015. In return for eliminating minimum processing requirement, high tariffs and <b>import</b> <b>restrictions</b> on almost all fish would be eliminated on the first day that CETA comes into effect. Currently only 13.1 per cent of seafood is duty-free. But by 2022, all seafood would be 100 per cent duty-free. Following the conclusion of the CETA negotiations Dunderdale said that other provinces and the federal government had been pressuring her to accept a deal that would eliminate minimum processing requirements on fish right away, in exchange for concessions on tariffs later. Dunderdale said they refused that deal and were eventually able to negotiate the current arrangement. Her government also felt that eliminating MPRs was a safe trade away because they did not feel European countries could compete with Newfoundland and Labrador fish plants, due to higher operating costs in those countries.|$|E

40|$|THE DOCTRINE OF THE PROHIBITION ON PARALLEL IMPORTS RESTRICTIONS WITHIN COMPETITION LAW OF THE EUROPEAN UNION The aim of {{this thesis}} is to analyse the current {{approach}} of EU competition law to parallel <b>imports</b> <b>restrictions</b> in light of nearly a half-century of EU Courts' case-law's evolution and {{in comparison with the}} approach adopted by US antitrust law. The traditional attitude of the EU Courts and of the Commission towards competition restraints of this type is described in literature in clear terms. However, {{this is not the case}} when it comes to the recent and current ambiguous developments within EU competition law. Therefore, this thesis aims to verify these two hypotheses. The first hypothesis says that evolution of the EU institutions approach to parallel <b>imports</b> <b>restrictions</b> has a circular nature: it starts from the traditional, intransigent position adopted in the early decades of European integration and it continues through a more lenient, economic approach in the period of the so called modernization of EU competition law to return to a rather traditional attitude typical of the current times.

40|$|AbstractAs per January - August 2013, the Government of Indonesia (GOA) has {{regulated}} a quota-based <b>import</b> <b>restriction</b> {{policy for}} <b>importing</b> shallot. This policy has produced an effect to the shallot price that rose significantly in spite inflation occurred. In order {{to control the}} inflation rate, on 2 September 2013 the government changed the <b>import</b> <b>restriction</b> policy, from quota based into price reference based as stated in a decree of the Director General of Domestic Trade No. 118 /PDN/KEP/ 10 / 2013. The price reference of shallot was counted at IDR 25, 700 /kg, and discounted at IDR 11, 935 /kg at the farmer level. The aim {{of this research is}} to determine the price reference of shallot <b>import</b> <b>restriction</b> that suit for protection of farmer profit of shallot farming. The method of analysis used in this research is Policy Analysis Matrix (PAM). The results shows that the implementation of price reference policy with the price at IDR 11, 935 /kg at farmer level has decreased the farmer protection and profitability for 46 % and 233 %, respectively. This decreasing was caused by the price reference of shallot at the retailer level. It is discussed that the price reference of shallot should be increased at least to IDR 15, 260 /kg at the farmers level to achieve a higher rate of protection and profit that would be most beneficial to farmers...|$|R

When facing unemployment, a country tends to impose an <b>import</b> <b>restriction</b> so that domestic firms will increase production and raise employment.

The industrial sector underwent significant changes due to the 1991 economic reforms, which removed <b>import</b> <b>restrictions,</b> brought in foreign competition, led to the privatisation of certain government-owned public-sector industries, liberalised the foreign direct investment (FDI) regime, improved infrastructure and led to an expansion in the production of fast-moving consumer goods. Post-liberalisation, the Indian private sector was faced with increasing domestic and foreign competition, including the threat of cheaper Chinese imports. It has since handled the change by squeezing costs, revamping management, and relying on cheap labour and new technology. However, this has also reduced employment generation, even among smaller manufacturers who previously relied on labour-intensive processes.|$|E
