40|$|In {{the past}} two decades, dental {{implants}} have been {{an essential component of}} the public health. However, lack of a reliable and safe dental surgery imaging modality remains a major problem. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) is an interferometic optical imaging modality that is somewhat similar to B-mode ultrasound but utilizes infrared light instead of sound waves. It can provide optical biopsy at a very high resolution and in real time. The compact fiber-optic components of OCT make it easy to integrate into <b>dental</b> <b>drill</b> <b>bit</b> to provide the dentists with real-time image feedback about the anatomical structure {{in the vicinity of the}} drill bit. This research focuses on the image processing for such a concept designing OCT integrated dental drilling system. Various image processing methods are applied to the OCT images with the intention of finding out the suitable solutions for speckle noise reduction, image reconstruction and dental tissues segmentation. OCT imaging system obtains the cross sectional structure of samples by measuring the back reflected light. The coherent detection makes the OCT images are always subject to speckle noise. The existence of speckle noise limits the interpretation of OCT images. In this study, various speckle reduction digital filters are applied to the images obtained from OCT during high speed rotation. Our results indicate that the adaptive Wiener filter is particularly suitable for our specific application. It is a time–saving method that not only significantly suppresses speckle noise but also preserves image edges. The study also concerns the image restoration due to the non-uniform rotational scanning. One modified method based on the cross correlation between successive A-scans is posted and studied. The assembled images indicate our algorithm is capable of reconstructing the manually-scanned images with an acceptable assemble accuracy. In tissue segmentation, the porous structure of the trabecular bones enables us to discriminate different them from cortical bones. However, due to the intensity decay along the depth direction, the way for image automatic segmentation is still a major problem need to be solved in future research. To test and verify our algorithms, the experiments are conducted to both real animal jawbones and silicone elastomer-based optical tissue phantoms. This proof-of-concept study shows that OCT is able to probe dental tissues in rotational scanning. The results from both samples are highly in accord with each other. This conclusion suggests that our optical phantom is a good jawbone substitute. The durable, easy-to-make phantoms can significantly reduce the cost of future researches.

5000|$|Just found this. I didn't {{know there}} was a Wikipedia page for this toy line. I was a {{producer}} on the first commercial (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXM0UBvTh10). It was actually filmed by the ®Academy Award winning Director of Special Effects for the original 1979 [...] "Superman" [...] movie (w/Christopher Reeves), Mr. Colin Chilvers. Seen 0:04 seconds in (then explodes), the Coleco Sectaur [...] "Origin" [...] commercial, featured a unique, super-miniature acrylic sculpture, stand-in for the 'planet long ago, where a genetic experiment fails and civilization dies', called Ramart Intersculpt. The 1983 Academy of Science Fiction [...] "Saturn Award" [...] winning sculptures were pioneering a new level of special effects photography, capitalizing on the 'super-miniature' nature of the sculptures themselves. In fact, large blocks of optically clear 'acrylic' were actually drilled out from underneath using the finest and smallest <b>dental</b> <b>drill</b> <b>bits.</b> When <b>drilled</b> out 'in reverse' (upside down), always designed in a science fiction/space-alien style architecture, the sculptures were then lighted from above, which gave them the appearance of being 'completely solid'. They were extremely versatile with image changes immediately afforded by simply altering the light position(s), or adding color 'gels' (filters) on the lights. As well, the structures could even pass as though made of ice. They offered huge savings on SPFX budgets by being super-miniature. As even regularly used 'film miniatures', could be from a few to tens of feet in size, and costing $1000s-$100,000+, and months to build. Besides being owned by some of the wealthiest art collectors in the country, like Vidal Sassoon, the artwork has been featured at the Smithsonian Institute (Washington, D.C.), Johnson Space Center, The International Space Hall of Fame, the home of President Ronald Reagan, Internationally renown jeweler, Cartier in New York City, and the original U.S.S.R. Space Guild in Russia. A special honor was when a custom sculpture was awarded to Deforest Kelly, Dr. [...] "Bones" [...] McCoy of the original Star Trek series. I'm also amazed, as I never realized the fan base that exists here for these very cool toys. I'm kind of blown away, knowing they weren't as successful as many other toys. I now have a greater appreciation for devoted commenters relaying their fond memories from experiences with the fantastic, Sectaurs. WE who work so hard on the original commercial always thought they were something special.|$|R
50|$|Turbodrills use the {{mechanical}} {{energy of the}} drill itself, and the hydraulic energy provided by the oil rig’s mud pumps to deliver power to the <b>drill</b> <b>bit.</b> The <b>drill</b> <b>bit</b> on a turbodrill spins much faster than on a conventional motor drill. The result is that, though there is less torque, this is compensated for by the increased speed, which makes straighter holes, and can drill faster and easier through tougher ground materials. The process {{is very similar to}} a <b>dental</b> <b>drill</b> used by a dentist. These tools are able to dig faster, operate in a much higher temperature environment, deliver longer downhole life, and produce a better and straighter hole quality than a conventional mud motor. In many applications turbodrills can offer their customers significant cost savings over standard drilling systems by saving them time spent drilling the hole since they typically pay drillers by the hour.|$|R

25|$|While {{the above}} {{is a common}} use of center <b>drill</b> <b>bits,</b> it is a {{technically}} incorrect practice {{and should not be}} considered for production use. The correct tool to start a traditionally drilled hole (a hole drilled by a high-speed steel (HSS) twist <b>drill</b> <b>bit)</b> is a spotting <b>drill</b> <b>bit</b> (or a spot <b>drill</b> <b>bit,</b> as they are referenced in the U.S.). The included angle of the spotting <b>drill</b> <b>bit</b> should be the same as, or greater than, the conventional <b>drill</b> <b>bit</b> so that the <b>drill</b> <b>bit</b> will then start without undue stress on the bit's corners, which would cause premature failure of the bit and a loss of hole quality.|$|R
25|$|Conventional twist <b>drill</b> <b>bits</b> tend {{to wander}} when {{presented}} to a flat workpiece.

40|$|The sound {{produced}} by a dental air turbine handpiece (<b>dental</b> <b>drill)</b> can markedly influence the sound environment in a dental clinic. Indeed, many patients report that {{the sound of a}} <b>dental</b> <b>drill</b> elicits an unpleasant feeling. Although several manufacturers have attempted to reduce the sound pressure levels {{produced by}} <b>dental</b> <b>drills</b> during idling based on ISO 14457, the sound emitted by such drills under active drilling conditions may negatively influence the dental clinic sound environment. The physical metrics related to the unpleasant impressions associated with <b>dental</b> <b>drill</b> sounds have not been determined. In the present study, psychological measurements of <b>dental</b> <b>drill</b> sounds were conducted with the aim of facilitating improvement of the sound environment at dental clinics. Specifically, we examined the impressions elicited by the sounds of 12 types of <b>dental</b> <b>drills</b> in idling and drilling conditions using a semantic differential. The analysis revealed that the impressions of <b>dental</b> <b>drill</b> sounds varied considerably between idling and drilling conditions and among the examined drills. This finding suggests that measuring the sound of a <b>dental</b> <b>drill</b> in idling conditions alone may be insufficient for evaluating the effects of the sound. We related the results of the psychological evaluations to those of measurements of the physical metrics of equivalent continuous A-weighted sound pressure levels (LAeq) and sharpness. Factor analysis indicated that impressions of the <b>dental</b> <b>drill</b> sounds consisted of two factors: "metallic and unpleasant" and "powerful". LAeq had a strong relationship with "powerful impression", calculated sharpness was positively related to "metallic impression", and "unpleasant impression" was predicted by the combination of both LAeq and calculated sharpness. The present analyses indicate that, in addition to a reduction in sound pressure level, refining the frequency components of <b>dental</b> <b>drill</b> sounds is important for creating a comfortable sound environment in dental clinics...|$|R
