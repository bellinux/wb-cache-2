[...] Nasmyth, {{who felt}} his pole dip into empty water, flung it in and grabbed his paddle, for the craft shot forward {{suddenly}} with the swing of the eddy towards the fall. He {{did not know whether}} the stream would sweep them under it, but he was not desirous of affording it the opportunity. For perhaps a minute they exerted themselves furiously, gasping as they strained aching arms and backs, and meanwhile, in spite of them, beneath the towering <b>fall</b> <b>of</b> <b>rock,</b> the canoe slid on toward the fall. It also drew a little nearer {{to the middle of the}} pool, where there was a curious bevelled hollow, round which the white foam spun. It seemed to Nasmyth that the stream went bodily down.|$|E
60|$|Now {{between the}} mining town and Cedar the river loses {{itself in a}} gloomy cañon, one of those awful gorges which are common among the {{mountains}} of British Columbia. Two great rocks partly close the entrance, and beyond this the chasm is veiled in spray, while its roar when the floods race through it can be heard several miles away. Scarcely a ray of sunlight enters its shadowy depths, and looking up from beside the entrance {{one can see the}} great pines that crown the sheer <b>fall</b> <b>of</b> <b>rock</b> looming against the skyline in a slender lace-like filigree. Sometimes, when frost bound fast the feeding snows, the Siwash Indians ran their light canoes through, but I never heard of a white man attempting the passage, and one glance was sufficient to show the reason. I understood it better when as by a miracle I came alive out of the cañon.|$|E
60|$|Although a large man, Gabriel was lithe and active, {{and dropped}} the {{intervening}} distance where the rope was scant, lightly, and without injury. Happily the falling of the statue was looked upon {{as the result of}} another earthquake shock, and its disastrous effect upon the storming party for awhile checked the attack. Gabriel lifted his half-fainting ally in his arms, and gaining the friendly shelter of the ditch, in ten minutes was beyond the confines of One Horse Gulch, and {{in the shadow of the}} pines of Conroy's Hill. There were several tunnel openings only known to him. Luckily the first was partly screened by a <b>fall</b> <b>of</b> <b>rock</b> loosened by the earthquake from the hill above, and satisfied that it would be unrecognised by any eye less keen than his own, Gabriel turned into it with his fainting burden. And it was high time. For the hæmorrhage from Jack Hamlin's wound was so great that that gentleman, after a faint attempt to wave his battered hat above his dishevelled curls, suddenly succumbed, and lay as cold and senseless and beautiful as a carven Apollo.|$|E

6000|$|... 'What was it?' {{as she and}} Gillian each {{sank into}} a chair, the one breathless, the other with the faintness renewed by the fresh shock, but able to listen as Mr. White told first briefly, then with more detail, how---as the {{surveying}} party proceeded along the path {{at the top of}} the cliffs, he and Lord Rotherwood comparing recollections of the former outline, now much changed by quarrying---the Marquis had stepped out to a slightly projecting point; Mr. Stebbing had uttered a note of warning, knowing how liable these promontories were to break away in the end of winter, and happily Lord Rotherwood had turned and made a step or two back, when the rock began to give way under his feet, so that, being a slight and active man, a spring and bound forward had actually carried him safely to the firm ground, and the others, who had started back in self-preservation, then in horror, fully believing him borne down to destruction, saw him the next instant lying on his face on the path before them. When on his feet, he had declared himself unhurt, and solely anxious as to what the <b>fall</b> <b>of</b> <b>rock</b> might have done beneath; but he was reassured by those cries of 'All right' which were uttered before the poor little Fields were discovered; and then, when the party were going to make their way down to inspect the effects of the catastrophe, he had found that he had not escaped entirely unhurt. Of course he had been forced to leap with utter want of heed, only as far and wide as he could, and thus, though he had lighted on his feet, he had fallen against a stone, and pain and stiffness of shoulder made themselves apparent; though he would accept no help in walking back to the hotel, and was only anxious not to frighten his wife and daughter, and desired Mr. White, who had volunteered to go, to tell the ladies next door that he was convinced it was nothing, or, if anything, only a trifle of a collar-bone. Mr. White had, since the arrival of the surgeon, made an expedition of inquiry, and heard this verdict confirmed, with the further assurance that there was no cause for anxiety. The account of the damage and disaster below was new to him, as his partner had declared the stables to be certain to be empty, and moreover in need of being rebuilt; and he departed to find Mr. Stebbing and make inquiries.|$|E

5000|$|Birdsend Bluff (...) is a rocky bluff at {{the south}} side of the mouth of Wheatstone Glacier, on the west coast of Graham Land.

2500|$|The {{connection}} to Scafell Pike is via Lingmell Col, a grassy depression at 2,410ft. Flowing west from the col is Lingmell Gill, descending through Hollow Stones to Brackenclose {{at the head}} of Wast Water. To the east of Lingmell Col runs Piers Gill, a stream descending from high on the Scafells. This flows right around the northern perimeter of Lingmell, finally entering Wast Water as Lingmell Beck, only a short distance from the entry point of Lingmell Gill. These two streams which girdle the fell both run through wide boulder strewn courses, evidence of flash flooding and the endless <b>fall</b> <b>of</b> <b>rocks</b> from the upper slopes.|$|R

Although other solar observatories constructed by the Pueblo people predict solar events by the movement of the light over a period of time, this one does not. It has also been suggested that it was not built but that those who made the inscriptions were using a convenient existing <b>fall</b> <b>of</b> <b>rock</b> (Kantner 2004, p.99).|$|E

It filled up the gully through which the creek flowed {{high up on the}} range, and, while a little water still creeps through, most of the melted snow goes down another creek. As I took the trouble to ascertain, it splits right through the lower slopes and comes out most a league away." ...|$|R
