5000|$|Alex Denney of NME said, [...] "Written {{around the}} time Tillman got hitched to this girlfriend, it's a hugely ambitious, caustically funny album about the redemptive {{possibilities}} of love, and being heartily sick of your own bullshit." [...] Marc Hirsh of The Boston Globe, on the other hand, criticized the album's lyrics, writing [...] "with a default mode of arch snarkery, Misty doesn't have much to say; he gets off a sharp line here and there, but can't string them together into anything greater." [...] In an otherwise positive review, PopMatters Sean McCarthy wrote [...] "After an amazingly solid first half, {{the second half of}} <b>Honeybear</b> suffers some lag, either because of some tracks have a lack of a memorable hook or chorus ("Strange Encounter"), or experiments that just don't pan out (see the laugh track on [...] "Bored in the U.S.A.")." [...] Will Hermes of Rolling Stone said, [...] "Upping the spectacle from Fear Fun his 2012 debut, I Love You, <b>Honeybear</b> is an autobiographical set about love, marriage and derangement that's both ironic and empathic." [...] Q stated, [...] "For its black lyrical humour alone, I Love You, <b>Honeybear</b> would be a winner. The fact that it's matched to towering songwriting makes it masterful stuff." ...|$|E

Club said, [...] "With a welcoming tenor and a likeably schmaltzy delivery that finds him displaying loads of range and emotions, he's {{able to give}} his subject matter the unforgiving and ultimately warm treatment it deserves." [...] Greg Kot of Chicago Tribune said, [...] "Misty's music cushions {{some of his most}} outrageous observations in plush wordless harmonies, strings and orchestral-pop melodies, sometimes to a point where he melts into background music." [...] Mojo stated, [...] "There are grand arrangements and barbed bon mots in the style of Randy Newman and Harry Nilsson, but what's most striking are the more restrained moments." [...] Exclaim!s Matthew Ritchie gave the album a perfect score, writing that [...] "Tillman's intentions and feelings as a songwriter have never seemed so clear." [...] Laura Studarus of DIY said, [...] "Still, for all his determination to thumb his nose at convention, I Love You, <b>Honeybear</b> finds Tillman falling face first into perhaps the most expected of musical tropes: the [...] "mature" [...] sophomore release." ...|$|E
