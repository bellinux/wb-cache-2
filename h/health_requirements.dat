25|$|With time, the {{shortage}} economy led to scarcity of meat, coffee, tea and other ingredients of daily use. Many products like chocolate, sugar and meat were rationed, {{with a specific}} limit depending on social class and <b>health</b> <b>requirements.</b> Physical workers and pregnant women were generally entitled to more food products. Imports were restricted, {{so much of the}} food supply was domestic. Cuisine became homogeneous, to be a chef was no longer a prestigious profession and for decades the country became basically disconnected from any foreign cuisine. Tropical fruits (citrus, banana, pineapple, etc.) were available during holidays and local fruits and vegetables were mostly seasonal but were available at private stands. For most of the year the Poles had to get by with only domestic winter fruit and vegetables: apples, plums, currants, onions, potatoes, cabbage, root vegetables and frozen products. Other food products (of foreign origins) were available at markets at high prices.|$|E
25|$|In Tamil Nadu, a plain rice porridge, or {{the thick}} {{supernatant}} water from overcooked rice, {{is known as}} kanji. Kanji or Congee is also prepared with different grains available {{in different parts of}} Tamil Nadu, for example minor millet or pearl millet, finger millet, broken wheat, maize.The people of Kerala also call this preparation of rice in a watery state kanji, and it is eaten as a porridge with green lentils or chutney. Kanji is prepared with rice or ragi. Nuts and spices are added to the kanji depending on the economic status or <b>health</b> <b>requirements.</b> Rice kanji is prepared by boiling rice in large amounts of water. To this preparation, either milk and sugar (usually jaggery) or curd (yoghurt) and salt are added. Ragi kanji is prepared by drying ragi sprouts in shade, and then grinding them into a smooth powder. This powder is added to water and cooked. Milk and brown sugar are added to this cooked preparation for taste. Ragi kanji can be given to infants after six months. Another kanji preparation uses jevvarisi (sago in English, sabudana in Hindi) in kanji. Sago is dry roasted and powdered with/ without sugar. Powdered sago is boiled in water until cooked. This is eaten by all ages from adults to infants as young as three months.|$|E

These recommendations support changes so that: • The theoretical cost of migration known as ‘significant cost threshold’ is modernised to reflect likely actual costs associated with disabilities or conditions. The committee also recommends that information on the costing methodology be made public. • Where a person does not meet the new updated <b>Health</b> <b>Requirement,</b> some visas provide for a waiver to allow for the assessment of the social and economic contributions made by a prospective immigrant or their families.   • Families including skilled immigrants should not be unfairly disadvantaged under the <b>Health</b> <b>Requirement</b> {{as a result of a}} family member having a disability – the ‘one fails, all fail’ rule. • For offshore refugee applicants who have a disability or other health condition, compelling and compassionate visa waivers are relevant considerations, including those applying on a family reunion basis.   • Australia’s migration legislation distinguishes between conditions which may impose a public health risk versus those linked to disability...|$|R

In fact, the picture was taken on a cruise to Europe from America, and for that reason some critics have interpreted it as recording people who were turned away by U.S. Immigration officials and were forced to go back home. Although some of the passengers might have been turned back because of failure to meet financial or <b>health</b> <b>requirements</b> for entrance, {{it is more likely that}} most of them were various artisans who worked in the booming construction trade of the time.

2500|$|The South African wine {{industry}} has been led by many powerful organisations in both {{the private sector and}} through governmental agencies. Unlike other New World wine regions, the South African {{wine industry}} is largely influenced by several large co-operatives. The Koöperatieve Wijnbouwers Vereniging van Zuid-Afrika Bpkt (KWV) was a co-operative first created through the funding and encouragement of the South African government as a force to stabilise and grow the South African wine industry. As the KWV is now a privately owned winemaking co-operative, some of its regulatory responsibilities have fallen to other organisations such as the South African Wine & Spirit Board. The Wine & Spirit Board runs the voluntary certification programme that allows South African wines to be [...] "certified" [...] for quality and accuracy in labelling. In addition to being subject to various labelling guidelines, wines are blind tasted by a panel of experts for quality, and are put through an analytic test for faults. Like the vintage and varietal labelling guidelines, these tests are voluntary, but wines that are not submitted for testing are liable for random testing for <b>health</b> <b>requirements.</b>|$|E

50|$|Network Access Protection (NAP) is a Microsoft {{technology}} for controlling network access of a computer, {{based on its}} health. With NAP, system administrators of an organization can define policies for system <b>health</b> <b>requirements.</b> Examples of system <b>health</b> <b>requirements</b> are whether the computer has the most recent operating system updates installed, whether the computer has {{the latest version of}} the anti-virus software signature, or whether the computer has a host-based firewall installed and enabled. Computers with a NAP client will have their health status evaluated upon establishing a network connection. NAP can restrict or deny network access to the computers that are not in compliance with the defined <b>health</b> <b>requirements.</b>|$|E
50|$|Network Access Protection Client Agent {{makes it}} {{possible}} for clients that support NAP to evaluate software updates for their statement of health. NAP clients are computers that report their system health to a NAP enforcement point. A NAP enforcement point is a computer or device that can evaluate a NAP client’s health and optionally restrict network communications. NAP enforcement points can be IEEE 802.1X-capable switches or VPN servers, DHCP servers, or Health Registration Authorities (HRAs) that run Windows Server 2008 or later. The NAP health policy server is a computer running the Network Policy Server (NPS) service in Windows Server 2008 or later that stores <b>health</b> <b>requirement</b> policies and provides health evaluation for NAP clients. <b>Health</b> <b>requirement</b> policies are configured by administrators. They define criteria that clients must meet before they are allowed undeterred connection; these criteria may include the version of the operating system, a personal firewall, or an up-to-date antivirus program.|$|R
