5|$|After the abdication of Tsar Nicholas II in 1917, the new Russian Provisional Government in Petrograd {{had little}} {{influence}} over Ukraine. Khrushchev {{was elected to}} the worker's council (or soviet) in Rutchenkovo, and in May he became its chairman. He did not join the Bolsheviks until 1918, a year in which the Russian Civil War, between the Bolsheviks and a coalition of opponents known as the White Army, began in earnest. His biographer, William Taubman, suggests that Khrushchev's delay in affiliating himself with the Bolsheviks was because he felt closer to the Mensheviks who prioritized <b>economic</b> <b>progress,</b> whereas the Bolsheviks sought political power. In his memoirs, Khrushchev indicated that he waited because there were many groups, and it was difficult to keep them all straight.|$|E

5|$|From 1964–2010, {{and again}} since 2012, the Flag of Malawi {{is made up}} of three equal {{horizontal}} stripes of black, red and green with a red rising sun superimposed {{in the center of the}} black stripe. The black stripe represented the African people, the red represented the blood of martyrs for African freedom, green represented Malawi's ever-green nature and the rising sun represented the dawn of freedom and hope for Africa. In 2010, the flag was changed, removing the red rising sun and adding a full white sun in the center as a symbol of Malawi's <b>economic</b> <b>progress.</b> The change was reverted in 2012.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the floods, strong winds blew away many roofs and some entire houses made of mud, leaving thousands of people homeless. The combined effects of the preceding floods and Eline left about 463,000people displaced or homeless, including 46,000children five years old or younger. Overall, the preceding floods and Eline caused about 700deaths, half of whom in Chokwe. with damage estimated at $500million (2000USD). At least 17people died directly due to Eline, although many bodies were washed away and unable to be counted. The cyclone and the floods disrupted much of the <b>economic</b> <b>progress</b> Mozambique had made in the 1990s {{since the end of}} its civil war.|$|E
5|$|The Song is {{considered}} a high point of classical Chinese innovation in science and technology, an era that featured prominent intellectual figures such as Shen Kuo and Su Song and the revolutionary use of gunpowder weapons. However, {{it was also a}} period of political and military turmoil, with opposing and often aggressive political factions formed at court that impeded political, social, and <b>economic</b> <b>progress.</b> The frontier management policies of the Chancellor Wang Anshi exacerbated hostile conditions along the Chinese-Vietnamese border. This sparked a border war with Vietnam's Lý dynasty, which was fought to a mutual draw and concluded with a peace treaty in 1082. To the northwest the Song Empire frequently quarreled with the rival Western Xia, led by the Tanguts, as well as the Liao Dynasty to the northeast, led by ethnic Khitans.|$|E

5|$|As decolonisation {{proceeded}} {{throughout the}} British Empire in the 1950s and 1960s, former colonies often did not reject English but rather {{continued to use}} it as independent countries setting their own language policies. For example, the view of the English language among many Indians has gone from associating it with colonialism to associating it with <b>economic</b> <b>progress,</b> and English continues to be an official language of India. English is also widely used in media and literature, and the number of English language books published annually in India is the third largest in the world after the US and UK. However English is rarely spoken as a first language, numbering only around a couple hundred-thousand people, and less than 5% of the population speak fluent English in India. David Crystal claimed in 2004 that, combining native and non-native speakers, India now has more people who speak or understand English than {{any other country in the}} world, but the number of English speakers in India is very uncertain, with most scholars concluding that the United States still has more speakers of English than India.|$|E
5|$|The {{educational}} and <b>economic</b> <b>progress</b> {{of the city}} began with the Company's military successes in the Deccan. The Wellington Pier (Apollo Bunder) {{in the north of}} Colaba was opened for passenger traffic in 1819 and the Elphinstone High School was established in 1822. Bombay was hit by a drought in 1824. The construction of the new mint commenced in 1825. With the construction of a good carriage road up the Bhor Ghat during the regimes of Mountstuart Elphinstone and Sir John Malcolm gave better access from Bombay to the Deccan. This road, which was opened on 10 November 1830, facilitated trade in a large measure. By 1830, regular communication with England started by steamers navigating the Red and Mediterranean Sea. In July 1832, the Parsi riots took place in consequence of a Government order for the destruction of pariah dogs which infested the city. The Asiatic Society of Bombay (Town Hall) was completed in 1833, and the Elphinstone College was built in 1835. In 1836, the Chamber of Commerce was established.|$|E
