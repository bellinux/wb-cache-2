5|$|Beer is {{measured}} and assessed by bitterness, by strength and by colour. The perceived bitterness {{is measured}} by the International <b>Bitterness</b> <b>Units</b> scale (IBU), defined in co-operation between the American Society of Brewing Chemists and the European Brewery Convention. The international scale was a development of the <b>European</b> <b>Bitterness</b> <b>Units</b> scale, often abbreviated as EBU, and the bitterness values should be identical.|$|R
5000|$|<b>European</b> <b>Bitterness</b> <b>Units</b> scale, often {{abbreviated}} as EBU, is a {{scale for}} measuring the perceived bitterness of beer, with lower values being generally [...] "less bitter" [...] and higher values [...] "more bitter". The scale and method are defined by the European Brewery Convention, and the numerical value {{should be the same}} as of the International <b>Bitterness</b> <b>Units</b> scale (IBU), defined in co-operation with the American Society of Brewing Chemists. However, the exact process of determining EBU and IBU values differs slightly, which may in theory result with slightly smaller values for EBU than IBU.|$|R
40|$|An {{electronic}} tongue (ET) comprising 18 potentiometric {{chemical sensors}} {{was applied to}} the quantitative analysis of beer. Fifty Belgian and Dutch beers of different types were measured using the ET. The same samples were analyzed using conventional analytical techniques with respect to the main physicochemical parameters. Only non-correlated physicochemical parameters were retained for further analysis, which were real extract, real fermentation degree, alcohol content, pH, bitterness, color, polyphenol and CO 2 content. Relationship between the ET and physicochemical datasets was studied using Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA). Four significant canonical variates were extracted using CCA. Correlation was observed between 6 physicochemical variables (real extract and fermentation degree, bitterness, pH, alcohol and polyphenols’ content) and 14 sensors of the ET. The feasibility of the ET for the quantification of bitterness in beer was evaluated in the aqueous solutions of isomerised hop extract and in the set of 11 beers with bitterness varying between 14 and 38 EBU (<b>European</b> <b>Bitterness</b> <b>Units).</b> Sensors displayed good sensitivity to isomerised hop extract and good prediction of the bitterness in beer was obtained. Calibration models with respect to the physicochemical parameters using ET measurements in 50 Belgian and Dutch beer samples were calculated by Partial Least Square regression. The ET was capable of predicting such parameters as real extract, alcohol and polyphenol content and bitterness, the latter with Root Mean Square Error of Prediction (RMSEP) of 2. 5. status: publishe...|$|R
50|$|Phuket Beer has no {{additives}} or preservatives and {{is produced}} in small batches {{every two to three}} months to ensure freshness.

50|$|The taste {{characteristics}} of a beer may come from the type and amount of malt used, flavours imparted by the yeast, and strength of bitterness. Bitterness can be measured on an International <b>Bitterness</b> <b>Units</b> scale, and in North America a number of brewers record the bitterness on this scale as IBUs.|$|R
50|$|The {{degree of}} {{bitterness}} imparted by hops {{depends on the}} degree to which alpha acids are isomerized during the boil, and the impact of a given amount of hops is specified in International <b>Bitterness</b> <b>Units.</b> Unboiled hops are only mildly bitter. On the other hand, the nonbitter flavor and aroma of hops come from the essential oils, which evaporate during the boil.|$|R
5000|$|Vermonster is an American {{barley wine}} style beer brewed by the Rock Art Brewery in Morrisville, Vermont. This beer {{was created by}} Matt Nadeau, the owner of Rock Art Brewery, in celebration of the brewery's 10th anniversary. The beer was created with the theme of [...] "Tens" [...] in that it {{contains}} 10% ABV, 100 International <b>Bitterness</b> <b>Units,</b> and 110 pounds of malt per barrel.|$|R
50|$|Weißbiers feature {{fermentation}} by-products such as esters (which lend fruity {{flavors and}} aromas), especially isoamyl acetate, reminiscent of bananas, and the phenolic compound guaiacol, a metabolite of ferulic acid, which smells and tastes like cloves. Other phenolics sometimes found in Weißbiers evoke medicinal or smoky sensations. The bittering level of most Weißbiers {{is close to}} 15 International <b>Bitterness</b> <b>Units,</b> a very low level. Hop flavor and aroma are typically low.|$|R
50|$|The Irish {{version of}} FES is brewed with pale malt, 25 per cent flaked barley (for head {{retention}} and body) and 10 per cent roasted barley, {{the latter being}} what gives the beer its dark hue. It uses the bitter Galena, Nugget and Target hop varieties. There are about a third more hops than in Guinness Draught and the beer has 47 <b>Bitterness</b> <b>Units.</b> The beer is force carbonated.|$|R

500|$|Hops contain several {{characteristics}} that brewers desire in beer. Hops contribute a bitterness that balances {{the sweetness of}} the malt; the bitterness of beers is measured on the International <b>Bitterness</b> <b>Units</b> scale. Hops contribute floral, citrus, and herbal aromas and flavours to beer. Hops have an antibiotic effect that favours the activity of brewer's yeast over less desirable microorganisms and aids in [...] "head retention", the length of time that a foamy head created by carbonation will last. The acidity of hops is a preservative.|$|R
5000|$|The {{bitterness}} of beer is measured {{according to the}} International <b>Bitterness</b> <b>Units</b> scale, with one IBU corresponding to one part-per-million of isohumulone. When beer is exposed to light, these compounds can decompose in a reaction catalyzed by riboflavin to generate free-radical species by the homolytic cleavage of the exocyclic carbon-carbon bond. The cleaved acyl side-chain radical then decomposes further, expelling carbon monoxide and generating 1,1-dimethylallyl radical. This radical can finally react with sulfur-containing amino acids, such as cysteine, to create 3-methylbut-2-ene-1-thiol, a thiol which causes beer to develop a [...] "skunky" [...] flavor.|$|R
40|$|Small breweries {{have become}} a growing trend in the Pacific Northwest, as well as nationwide. Many microbreweries lack the {{advantages}} large breweries have (time, space, and money) {{when it comes to}} testing their beer in regards to quality analysis and control. The objectives of this study were to modify and develop QA/QC protocols from the American Society of Brewing Chemists Methods for Craft Breweries (ASBC) for use in classrooms or small breweries. This work focused on revising methods for international <b>bitterness</b> <b>units</b> (IBU), alcohol by volume (ABV), and standard reference method (SRM) for beer.

50|$|San Diego County brewers {{produce the}} full range of craft beers, but they are best known for strongly-hopped, high-alcohol beers such as India Pale Ale (IPA), and {{particularly}} for an even stronger, hoppier style known as Double IPA. Double IPA beers are made with intensely aromatic, bitter hops, which result in a very bitter beer. A standard mass-produced American beer scores less than 20 on the International <b>Bitterness</b> <b>Units</b> (IBU) scale; an average IPA scores about 60 IBU; and a double IPA commonly scores 100 IBU or higher. The style was pioneered by brewer Vinnie Cilurzo at the now-defunct Blind Pig Brewery in Temecula in 1994; nowadays almost every brewery in San Diego County produces a double IPA. Double IPA has been called San Diego's signature beer, and some people refer to Double IPA beers as San Diego Pale Ale.|$|R
40|$|Also with {{conventional}} hopping {{in compliance with}} the purity law it is possible to produce beers with a mild bitterness and distinct hop aroma. Here the examinations were made with three types of hopping each with 2 hop varieties in bottom-fermenting beers: - addition 20 minutes before end of boil and a late addition split between end of boil and in the whirlpool - hop addition split only between end of boil and in the whirlpool - dry hopping exclusively There was no first addition at begin of boil. The 6 beers were examined for bitter substances, polyphenols and selected aromatic substances. The spread of the analysis values was enormous: - EBC <b>bitterness</b> <b>units</b> 12 - 28 IBU - iso-alpha-acids 1 - 17 mg/L - hop polyphenols 71 - 126 mg/L - monoterpenes and sesquiterpenes 32 - 300 µg/L - linalool + geraniol 198 - 838 µg/L - esters 72 - 793 µg/L By adjusting the time of hopping between middle of boil, end of boil and dry hopping you can achieve almost any beer bitterness. In addition, you have a practically infinite range for aroma impressions through the dose and choice of hop variety or varieties. Consequently, bitterness and hop aroma can also be separated from each other by using conventional pelletsstatus: publishe...|$|R
40|$|Whole-transcriptome {{analysis}} was performed on beer-spoilage organisms Lactobacillus brevis BSO 464 (Lb 464) and Pediococcus claussenii ATCC BAA- 344 T (Pc 344) when grown in growth-limiting concentrations of hop extract. This was done to delineate the hops-specific component of the total transcriptional response for these bacteria when growing in beer. The transcriptome of highly hop-tolerant isolate Lb 464 had fewer genes with differential expression {{in response to a}} stronger challenge (i. e., higher <b>bitterness</b> <b>units)</b> of hop extract than did Pc 344, highlighting the variable nature of hop-tolerance in beer-spoilage-related lactic acid bacteria. As Lb 464 can grow in pressurized/gassed beer and Pc 344 cannot, this indicates that the genetic and physiological response to hops alone does not dictate the overall beer-spoilage virulence of an isolate. The general response to hops in both isolates involves pathways of acid tolerance and intracellular pH homeostasis, with glutamate and citrate metabolism, and biogenic amine metabolism as additional major responses to the presence of hop extract by Lb 464 and Pc 344, respectively. A Pc 344 chromosomal ABC transporter (PECL_ 1630) was more strongly expressed than the plasmid-located, hop-tolerance ABC transporter horA. PECL_ 1630 is suggested to be involved in import of ATP into the cell, potentially assisting the total bacterial community when facing hop stress. This transporter is found in other beer-related P. claussenii suggesting a putative species-specific beer-spoilage-related genetic marker. Lb 464 and Pc 344 each contain eight plasmids and transcription from almost all occurs in response to both hops and beer. However, as evident by both transcriptional analysis and plasmid variant analysis, each bacterium harbors one plasmid that is critical for responding to hops and beer stress. For both bacteria, complex transcriptional regulation and cooperation between chromosomal and plasmid-based genes occurs in response to the growth challenges imposed by hops or beer...|$|R
40|$|Os principais compostos responsáveis pelo amargor de cervejas são os iso- &# 945;-ácidos provenientes do lúpulo, que participam de maneira importante no sabor da bebida. Procurou-se, neste trabalho, diferenciar algumas cervejas brasileiras líderes do mercado nacional em relação a algumas marcas disponíveis no mercado do oeste dos Estados Unidos, compreendendo cervejas tipo lager, ale e de microcervejarias. Discute-se a relação entre unidades de amargor (BU) e os teores de iso- &# 945;-ácidos totais e suas frações isohumulona, isocohumulona e isoadhumulona presentes nestes tipos de cerveja. Os resultados mostraram que a cerveja do tipo Indian Pale Ale apresentou maior nível de BU, apesar da concentração de iso- &# 945;-ácidos totais aproximar-se dos valores de cervejas lager e de microcervejaria. Cervejas tipo lager norte-americanas apresentaram as menores intensidades de amargor, seguidas das marcas brasileiras (de 11 a 15 BU). Com relação às frações dos iso- &# 945;-ácidos, destaca-se que a isoadhumulona foi a fração de concentração mais baixa em todas as amostras e que na maioria das amostras prevalecem concentrações superiores de isohumulona. A faixa de concentração de isohumulonas permaneceu entre 3, 0 e 17, 0 mg. L- 1 Iso-&# 945;-acids is a {{group of}} {{compounds}} which have an important participation in beer flavor.

40|$|The {{bitterness}} of beer {{remains one of}} its most important flavour attribute. However, complexity surrounding bitterness perception alone represents a significant challenge in its understanding, in addition to other factors relating to production processes and raw materials used in making beer. The aim of this research was to better understand beer bitterness in terms of its intensity and quality, and how hopping technology (e. g. quantity and time of hop addition during the brewing process), hop aroma and variety may effect perceived bitterness intensity and quality. This project combined both analytical and sensorial analysis, and used statistical techniques to identify the key compounds driving bitterness perception. Analytical techniques were employed to quantify bitterness-contributing compounds and analytical <b>bitterness</b> <b>units</b> in beers alongside descriptive analysis of perceived sensory bitterness. Perceived sensory bitterness (both qualitative and quantitative) was assessed using a purpose developed list of well-defined bitterness attributes, to aid the characterisation of bitterness quality in beers. The impact of cross-modal flavour interactions on the perception of beer bitterness intensity and qualities was also investigated at varying analytical bitterness levels. Lastly, the effect of hop variety, and how this significant raw material affects perceived bitterness quality was also investigated using three distinctively different hop varieties (Hersbrucker, East Kent Goldings and Zeus). Results revealed a significant impact of the analytical profiles of beers, derived from the type of hop products and hopping technology adopted in beer production, on the perceived bitterness quality of beer. In general, beers high in hop acid compounds and polyphenols were, as expected, perceived to be higher in bitterness intensity. The results further showed that bitterness intensity also {{played a role in the}} perception of bitterness quality i. e. whether the beer was ‘harsh’, ‘lingering’ or ‘round’. However, beers high in these compounds were not always of ‘negative’ bitterness quality, and correspondingly lower amounts of these compounds did not always result in ‘positive’ bitterness qualities in beer. Results on the impact of cross-modal flavour interactions showed that hop aroma plays a crucial role in beer bitterness perception, and can modify the perception of bitterness intensity and quality as well as temporal profiles of bitterness in beer depending on analytical bitterness levels. The investigation into the impact of hop variety on perceived bitterness quality revealed hop-derived bitterness profiles relating to individual hop varieties, and further suggests that careful selection of the hop variety used for brewing is important for controlling perceived bitterness quality. This research provides a comprehensive interdisciplinary approach to understanding perceived beer bitterness and its associated qualities, with findings suggesting that besides bitterness intensity, the quality and overall impression of bitterness as perceived by consumers are significantly influenced by raw materials, production processes and other factors such as aroma which might be overlooked by brewers - but are likely to be significant for consumer preference and the success of a brand...|$|R
