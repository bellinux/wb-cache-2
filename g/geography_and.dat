40|$|Recent anti-systemic social {{movements}} have illustrated {{the central role}} of cities in social movement mobilization. We not only highlight the characteristics of urban social relations that make cities fertile ground for mobilization, but also point to the disjunctures between the <b>geographies</b> <b>and</b> spatialities of social relations in the city, <b>and</b> the <b>geographies</b> <b>and</b> spatialities of many systemic processes. Struggles for a more just society must consider the broad <b>geographies</b> <b>and</b> spatialities of oppression, which we illustrate with a brief analysis of the Occupy movement.

5|$|Up {{through the}} 19th century, {{the scope of}} biology was largely divided between medicine, which {{investigated}} questions of form and function (i.e., physiology), and natural history, which was concerned with the diversity of life and interactions among different forms of life and between life and non-life. By 1900, much of these domains overlapped, while natural history (and its counterpart natural philosophy) had largely given way to more specialized scientific disciplines—cytology, bacteriology, morphology, embryology, <b>geography,</b> <b>and</b> geology.|$|E

5|$|A {{suitable}} environment {{had developed}} to question scientific doctrine. The discovery in 1492 of the New World by Christopher Columbus challenged the classical worldview. The works of Ptolemy (in <b>geography)</b> <b>and</b> Galen (in medicine) {{were found to}} not always match everyday observations. As the Protestant Reformation and Counter-Reformation clashed, the Northern Renaissance showed a decisive shift in focus from Aristotelean natural philosophy to chemistry and the biological sciences (botany, anatomy, and medicine).

5|$|India's <b>geography</b> <b>and</b> geology are climatically pivotal: the Thar Desert in the {{northwest}} and the Himalayas in the north work in tandem to effect a culturally and economically important monsoonal regime.

Most of North India is thus kept warm or is only mildly chilly or cold during winter; the same thermal dam keeps most regions in India hot in summer.|$|E
