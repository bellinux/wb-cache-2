40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to compare several fins, <b>duct</b> <b>height,</b> and {{velocity}} magnitudes to acquire a PhotoVoltaic/Thermal system designed through Computational Fluid Dynamics. Simulation of different fins (rectangular, trapezoidal, curved, and pin) with different distances among fins is performed in Fluent software. The parameters such as <b>duct</b> <b>height</b> (4, 6, 8, and 10 centimeters) and velocity magnitudes (0. 5, 1, 2, and 3 m/s) are also simulated. According to the results the highest cell temperature was 51 °C at 0. 5 m/s, while the best result was 33 °C achieved with 4 cm <b>duct</b> <b>height,</b> rectangular fin and 3 m/s velocity magnitude. The findings suggest that the maximum cell temperature at the rate of 0. 5 m/s is 51 °C, whereas temperature conducive to the best outputs is 33 °C. Differences among the cell temperatures through the various duct and the different fin types were significant at 1 % level, also velocity magnitude would be cardinal at 1 % level.

OBJECTIVES Our first objective is to develop a metric, involving one or more parameters, to replace evaporation <b>duct</b> <b>height</b> as a fundamental basis for comparison and evaluation of evaporation duct models. Because electromagnetic propagation is determined by vertical gradients of modified refractivity (M) and because these gradients are more uniquely determinant of propagation conditions that <b>duct</b> <b>height</b> alone (Dockery 1988, Reilly and Dockery 1990, Gehman 2000), it is felt that evaporation <b>duct</b> <b>height</b> is often inadequate for accurately describing propagation conditions. Our second objective is to use experimental data to evaluate various LKB-based (where LKB refers to Liu et al 1979) evaporation duct models (e. g., the BYC model described in Babin et al 1997, the NRL-Monterey Model,. etc.) to determine the best model(s) using the objective criterion from the first objective. Our third objective is to evaluate the possible effects of issues raised during the Naval Postgraduate School Evaporation Duct Workshops on the LKB approach to evaporation duct models. APPROAC...|$|E
40|$|Radio wave {{propagation}} {{over the ocean}} at frequencies above about 1 GHz differs from that over land due {{to the effect of}} a stratified layer just above the sea's surface known as the evaporation duct. The height and strength of this duct are the main factors affecting propagation. Bulk parameters have been developed to define <b>duct</b> <b>height</b> mainly in temperate zones; their applicability to the tropical region is as yet ambiguous as is the effect of wind speed on duct effective height in these regions. Significant previous work has been carried out on identifying <b>duct</b> <b>height</b> from atmospheric parameters, and thus behaviour by Babin et al [28]. The author contacted Dr Babin who made available his entire Thesis [39] which was most useful in our early research on <b>duct</b> <b>height.</b> In this work, measurements from sensor buoys are presented along with wind speed measurements and an equation for <b>duct</b> <b>height</b> postulated by Kulessa and Hermann is examined. The developmental algorithm appears to reasonably fit a series of wind speeds taken in the Gulf St. Vincent, South Australia, in a temperate climate and Southern Ocean. Data is presented and the equation discussed for the tropical zone, from this some <b>duct</b> <b>height</b> predictions are made. These duct heights are compared with those calculated using bulk parameters and conclusions are drawn for the tropical littoral zone. Radio {{wave propagation}} inside the duct is therefore considered to be anomalous with over the horizon paths producing near line of sight loss values. In this research the phenomenon is demonstrated in the results from one long distance experiment conducted over a one week period. Results from a 24 hour period are fully analysed along with analysis of another period in the campaign when the results were different from those expected. Other experiments over shorter paths using a ten-element receiver array are presented and the results used to make conclusions on the accuracy of the Parabolic Equation Models (PEM) in the tropical littoral zone. A design for a sixteen element array capable of resolving angle of arrival in a duct and the theory of its operation is also discussed along with information on the construction, installation and testing of this array concept.

The SEAWASP {{accuracy and reliability}} were evaluated {{in the context of}} the MORIAH operational Requirements Document (ORD) and AEGIS operating requirements. Measures of accuracy were RMS differences between simultaneous ship measurements when their separation was less than 10 and 5 kilometers. Measures of reliability were based on the number of mast average records possible in a period, recorded in a period, and validated in a period. For ORD accuracy, only air temperature and relative humidity met ORD Threshold requirements. For ORD reliability, Anzio's system did not meet requirements because a power surge caused failure of several ship systems including SEAWASP.

This slow-moving platform makes long-term deployments and environmental data collection feasible, especially in data sparse regions or hazardous environments. The standard SHARC hosts a meteorological station (Airmar PB 200) that samples air pressure, temperature, wind speed and wind direction at 1. 12 m. The SHARC automatically transmits a 10 -minute averaged data suite through an Iridium satellite link. In an effort to evaluate the SHARC default Airmar sensors and seek optimal sensors for air-sea interaction studies,NPS has developed an independent package of meteorological sensors, theNPS Met, for use on the SHARC.

Reynolds number and <b>duct’s</b> <b>height</b> downstream from the step are kept constant at Re 0 = 28, 000 and H = 0. 19 m, respectively. Uniform and constant heat flux of qw = 270 W/m 2 is specified at the stepped wall downstream from the step, while other walls are treated as adiabatic. The selection of the values for these parameters is motivated {{by the fact that}} measurements are available for this geometry and they can be used to validate the flow and heat transfer simulation code. Two-equation low-Reynolds-number model is employed to achieve the turbulent Prandtl number. The primary and secondary recirculation regions increase in size as the step height increases. The bulk temperature increases more rapidly as the step height increases. Increasing the step height causes the magnitude of the maximum turbulent kinetic energy to increase. Near the step and below the step height, the turbulent kinetic energy becomes smaller as the step height increases. Inside the recirculation region, magnitude of the peak friction coefficient does not significantly change with the increase of step height.

The presence of an evaporation duct can affect naval operations involving communications, surveillance, electronic warfare, and detection of low-flying missiles, surface ships, or submarine periscopes. We conducted a climate scale analysis of evaporation <b>duct</b> <b>heights</b> (EDH) in the northern South China Sea (SCS), including how EDH varies throughout the year, how environmental variables affect EDH differently in each season, and how regional and global-scale climate variations are related to EDH. We identified climate variations that may enable skillful long-range forecasts of EDH at lead times of up to three months using anomalies in sea surface temperature, geopotential height, and outgoing longwave radiation (OLR) as potential predictors. SCS EDH showed significant correlations with several climate variation indices, including the Multivariable El Nino Southern Oscillation Index, Nino 4, and the Summer Asian Monsoon OLR Indices. Improved understanding and skillful predictions of seasonal and climate scale variations in EDH will aid in operational planning in locations for which real-time observations are sparse, and for interseasonal to seasonal lead times for which existing predictions are presently very limited. Knowledge of EDH in the SCS may become critically important given the increasing significance of the eastern and southeastern Asian area, and particularly for operations involving protection of high-value units and anti-submarine warfare.

40|$|A {{spectral}} method of Chebyshev collocation with domain decomposition is introduced for linear interaction between sound and structure in a duct lined with flexible walls backed by cavities {{with or without}} a porous material. The spectral convergence is validated by a one-dimensional problem with a closed-form analytical solution, and is then extended to the two-dimensional configuration and compared favorably against a previous method based on the Fourier-Galerkin procedure and a finite element modeling. The nonlocal, exact Dirichlet-to-Neumann boundary condition is embedded in the domain decomposition scheme without imposing extra computational burden. The scheme is applied to the problem of high-frequency sound absorption by duct lining, which is normally ineffective when the wavelength is comparable with or shorter than the <b>duct</b> <b>height.</b> When a tensioned membrane covers the lining, however, it scatters the incident plane wave into higher-order modes, which then penetrate the duct lining more easily and get dissipated.

40|$|The {{scattering}} of sound at a sudden area expansion in a duct with subsonic mean flow has been modelled with a multimodal method. Technological applications are for instance {{internal combustion engine}} exhaust silencers and silencers in industrial duct systems. Both 2 D rectangular and 2 D cylindrical geometries are considered. The influence of the mean flow profile, and the-in this method-associated application of an acoustic Kutta condition {{at the edge of}} the area discontinuity, is investigated. The scattering coefficients for the plane waves are found to change smoothly as the flow profile is changed gradually from one, where the acoustic Kutta condition is applied to one where it is not applied. Furthermore, for high Strouhal numbers no difference is observed in the results for the scattering coefficients obtained for different flow profiles. Also, at low Strouhal numbers the magnitudes of the scattering coefficients are the same for different profiles. The influence of the ratio of the heights (in 2 D rectangular geometry), respectively, radii (in 2 D cylindrical geometry), of the ducts upstream and downstream of the area expansion on the scattering coefficients is examined. Around a certain Strouhal number, a specific feature in the scattering coefficients is observed when the ratio of the <b>duct</b> <b>heights</b> or radii is less than 0. 5. This is found to be connected to a strong interaction between the first evanescent acoustic mode and the hydrodynamic instability mode. For non-uniform flow even an apparent jump between the first evanescent acoustic mode and the hydrodynamic unstable mode and a corresponding jump in scattering coefficients is observed, when employing causality analysis according to the Briggs-Bers or Crighton-Leppington procedure. This implies that in fact an absolute instability occurs. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R

The tolerances in the <b>duct</b> <b>height</b> and absorber plate emissivity should be small while positive tolerance of 3 ° in the collector slope for winter operation and ± 3 ° for year round operation, and a positive tolerance for the gap between the absorber plate and glass cover at nominal value of 40 [*]mm are recommended...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this project is to {{investigate}} the feasibility of and methodology {{for the development of}} a set of environmental analogs of operational Undersea Warfare (USW) areas within fleet training areas. It is primarily a discussion of the identification of parameters that characterize the tactical USW environment, prioritization of these parameters, identification of existing databases that contain these parameters and an outline of the processes required to extract the desired data from the databases. An example of two operational areas with probable analogous training areas is discussed in terms of the methodology proposed. Among the environmental parameters considered are: bathymetry, sediment type, sound velocity profiles, acoustic response of the environment across a broad frequency spectrum (for both active and passive sonar), ambient noise, shipping density, bioluminescent properties, evaporation <b>duct</b> <b>height,</b> atmospheric surface <b>duct</b> <b>height</b> and gravitational anomalies. The project focus is primarily on acoustic oceanographic features but non-acoustic and atmospheric features are considered. There is an expectation that this project is the starting point for further research, software product development, data extraction, analog identification and promulgation of a tailored product to the fleet. The ultimate goal is to train for USW across the fleet in areas as much like the areas the Navy fights in as possible...|$|E
40|$|Building air {{distribution}} terminal system designers and system installers require accurate quantitative {{information on the}} performance of the installed system to achieve optimum efficiency and levels of human comfort. This requires field installation adjustment values from published ideal pressure loss, {{air distribution}} and sound generation installation performance. This study documents the air output performance of different installation configurations of six types of ceiling diffusers and compares the results to performance when installed according to ANSI/ASHRAE Standard 70 - 2006. A diffuser inlet supply plenum was designed for optimum flow and used to acquire a baseline set of data covering the six types of diffusers at different inlet neck sizes and inlet airflow rates. Full scale laboratory testing of typical field installation variations was completed for the same conditions with variations in damper installation, duct approach angle, duct type, <b>duct</b> vertical <b>height</b> above the diffuser and duct branch to main supply duct installation. A set of simple algorithms were developed {{that can be used to}} easily predict how an inlet configuration would affect the performance of a wide variety of installation conditions...|$|R
40|$|Building air {{distribution}} terminal system designers and system installers require accurate quantitative {{information on the}} diffuser throw and pressure loss performance of the installed system to achieve optimum efficiency and levels of human comfort. This research project, covered in three papers, establishes the diffuser baseline performance and then determines the field installation adjustment values. The first paper covers baseline performance. This paper documents the field conditions difference in throw and pressure loss from ideal conditions of six types of ceiling diffusers, each with three different inlet sizes at three different inlet velocities. The third paper covers differences in sound generation from ideal conditions. Full scale laboratory testing of typical field installation variations was completed with variations in damper installation, duct approach angle, duct type, <b>duct</b> vertical <b>height</b> above the diffuser, and close coupling duct installation. A predictive model was developed and {{used to create a}} set of look-up tables {{that can be used to}} easily predict how the installation configuration would affect diffuser performance compared to published data. The results in this report can be used to determine the corrections for throw and pressure loss for field conditions from baseline results...|$|R
40|$|The present work, a {{continuation}} {{of a series of}} investigations on the aerodynamics of aggressive inter-turbine ducts (ITD), is aimed at providing detailed understanding of the flow physics and loss mechanisms in four different ITD geometries. A systematic experimental and computational study was carried out for varying duct mean rise angles and outlet-toinlet area ratio while keeping the <b>duct</b> length-to-inlet <b>height</b> ratio, Reynolds number and inlet swirl constant in all four geometries. The flow structures within the ITDs were found to be dominated by the counter-rotating vortices and boundary layer separation in both the casing and hub regions. The duct mean rise angle determined the severity of adverse pressure gradient in the casing's first bend whereas the duct area ratio mainly governed the second bend's static pressure rise. The combination of upstream wake flow and the first bend's adverse pressure gradient caused the boundary layer to separate and intensify the strength of counter-rotating vortices. At high mean rise angle, the separation became stronger at the casing's first bend and moved farther upstream. At high area ratios, a 2 -D separation appeared on the casing. Pressure loss penalties increased significantly with increasing duct mean rise angle and area ratio. Peer reviewed: YesNRC publication: Ye...|$|R
