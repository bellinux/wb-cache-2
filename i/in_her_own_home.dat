5|$|The estate at Wierzchownia was isolated.

She spent her time reading the books her husband imported from faraway lands.|$|E
5|$|As Alice's memory {{begins to}} fade, she daydreams {{of her mother}} and sister, who died in a car crash when she was a teenager. She memorizes words and sets a series of {{personal}} questions on her phone, which she answers every morning. She hides sleeping pills in her room, and records a video message instructing her future self to swallow the pills when she can no longer answer the questions. As her disease advances, she becomes unable to give focused lectures and loses her job. She becomes lost searching for the bathroom <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>own</b> <b>home</b> and does not recognize Lydia after seeing her perform in a play.|$|E
5|$|Gordimer herself became {{involved}} in South African struggle politics after the arrest of a friend, Bettie du Toit, in 1960 for trade unionist activities and {{being a member of}} the SACP. Just as Rosa Burger in the novel visits family in prison, so Gordimer visited her friend. Later in 1986, Gordimer gave evidence at the Delmas Treason Trial in support of 22 ANC members accused of treason. She was a member of the ANC while it was still an illegal organization in South Africa, and hid several ANC leaders <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>own</b> <b>home</b> to help them evade arrest by the security forces.|$|E

5|$|Her next {{role was}} as Natasha Rostova in the 1956 film {{adaptation}} of Leo Tolstoy's War and Peace. In 1957 Hepburn starred with Gary Cooper and Maurice Chevalier in Billy Wilder's Love in the Afternoon, and with Fred Astaire {{in the musical}} film Funny Face. Two years later she appeared in the romantic adventure film Green Mansions, and played a nun in The Nun's Story. In 1961, Hepburn played café society girl Holly Golightly in the romantic comedy Breakfast at Tiffany's, and as a teacher accused of lesbianism in Wyler's drama The Children's Hour opposite Shirley MacLaine. Two years later she appeared opposite Cary Grant in the romantic mystery film Charade. Hepburn followed this by starring in the romantic comedy Paris When It Sizzles opposite William Holden, and as Cockney flower girl Eliza Doolittle in the musical film My Fair Lady (both in 1964). In 1967, she played a blind woman menaced by drug dealers <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>own</b> <b>home</b> in the suspense thriller Wait Until Dark which earned her a Best Actress Oscar nomination. Nine years later, Hepburn played Maid Marian opposite Sean Connery as Robin Hood in Robin and Marian.|$|E
5|$|One day, {{however, the}} mirror tells her {{that there is}} a new fairest woman in the land, her 14-year-old stepdaughter, Princess Snow White. She became obsessively jealous of the princess' {{emerging}} beauty, therefore turning her into a scullery maid <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>own</b> <b>home.</b> After observing the handsome Prince from another kingdom singing a love song to Snow White, the proud Queen, in a jealous rage, commands her faithful Huntsman, Humbert, to take the princess deep into the forest and kill her. He is ordered to bring back her heart in a box to prove that he had done so. But Humbert cannot bear to kill the young princess upon realizing that she is impervious to harm, so he tells Snow White of the Queen's plot and tells her to run away and never to come back. To escape the penalty, he comes back with a pig's heart and gives it to the Queen. When she questions her mirror, it again replies that Snow White is the fairest in the land, and that she is living at the cottage of the Seven Dwarfs, revealing that the box contains the heart of a pig. The Dwarfs are fearful of the Queen's black magic but decide to take in Snow White anyway.|$|E

40|$|Today, anthropologists, ethnomusicologists, cultural, {{and gender}} {{scholars}} {{are interested in}} culture not only as it is performed, but as it is continuously done, constructed, maintained through acting, musicking, talking, dancing together. Culture lives, and its elements—or aspects, if you wish—are constantly converging, and articulating into new, moving and shifting formations. In this paper Järviluoma discusses the different ways of understanding the concept of culture, interweaving the ideas with {{the early twentieth century}} forms of music making <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>own</b> grandmother’s <b>home</b> village <b>in</b> northern Finland. She discusses how the new ‘culture’, within the ‘civilising’ social movements converged with the old ways of life and musicking...|$|R
25|$|In {{places such}} as the West Village, the factors that she argued would {{maintain}} economic and cultural diversity have led instead to gentrification {{and some of the}} most expensive real estate <b>in</b> the world. <b>Her</b> <b>own</b> <b>home</b> sold <b>in</b> the 2000s for more than $3 million. Arguably, <b>her</b> <b>own</b> white-collar family’s conversion of an old candy shop into a home was indicative of the gentrifying trend that would continue under the influence of Jacobs’s ideas.|$|R

She witnessed the Tsar's abdication and the family's imprisonment by the new provisional government. Dehn left the palace and persuaded the government to place her under house arrest <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>own</b> <b>home</b> because her son Titi was dangerously ill.|$|E
60|$|She {{had been}} obliged {{to let her}} sisters go to Sutton without her, as the little parsonage had not room for three guests besides Lieschen, who was more {{indispensable}} to Maria than even herself, and both the others were earnestly set upon accepting the invitation. Cecily silenced her scruples by begging, as a proof of acceptance as a sister, {{that she might be}} intrusted with them, and promising that <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>own</b> quiet <b>home,</b> whence most of the family had been launched into life, they should meet with none of the excitements of merry Moorcroft; and Phoebe was obliged to resign her charge for these few weeks, and trust from Bertha's lively letters that all was well.|$|R
50|$|Cullis-Hill {{began working}} as a {{professional}} architect after the Second World War. In a contract position with the New South Wales Housing Commission, she designed houses as part of Sydney's postwar reconstruction boom. She set up a solo practice <b>in</b> 1946 at <b>her</b> <b>own</b> <b>home</b> <b>in</b> Warrawee, since she felt that women architects were unwelcome in large firms. Initially, she accepted commissions from friends, and through word-of-mouth recommendations she received enough projects to keep <b>her</b> <b>in</b> full-time work.|$|R
6000|$|Perhaps her {{feelings}} were unnecessarily strong, {{and in some}} degree unjust to Mrs. Pugh; but she had the misfortune to be naturally proud and sensitive, {{as well as by}} breeding too refined in tone for most of those who surrounded her. She had taken a personal dislike to Mrs. Pugh from the first; she regarded pretension as insincerity, and officiousness as deliberate insult, and she took the recoil of her taste for the judgment of principle. To see such a woman ruling <b>in</b> <b>her</b> mother's, <b>her</b> <b>own,</b> <b>home</b> would be bad enough; but to be ruled by her, and resign to her the management of the children, would be intolerable beyond measure. Too unhappy to speak of her anticipations even to Leonard or to Mary May, she merely endeavoured to throw them off from day to day, till one evening, when the days had grown so long that she could linger in the twilight in the garden before her singing practice, she was joined by Henry, with the long apprehended 'I want to speak to you, Ave.' ...|$|R

25|$|Michael Shepherd {{was born}} on 30 July 1923 in Cardiff of a Jewish family with its roots in Odessa and Poland. He {{attended}} Cardiff High School and pursued his medical studies at the Medical School of Oxford University and the Radcliffe Infirmary. He was there influenced by the teaching of John Ryle, Professor of Social Medicine. Whilst under his tutorage, Shepherd was asked to visit a patient <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>own</b> <b>home</b> in Cowley {{in order to learn}} about the socio-medical significance of cardiac invalidism. Through such examples, Shepherd discerned the potential value to psychiatry of systematic research into the social causes of mental disorder. After qualifying he went on to complete his house appointments, and also his National Service in the Royal Air Force.|$|E
50|$|Making {{her debut}} as a lead actress in the 1936 {{released}} Samsara Nauka Rajamma enjoyed an elaborate career in feature films across South India.

25|$|In South Africa, {{she joined}} the African National Congress {{when it was still}} listed as an illegal {{organization}} by the South African government. While never blindly loyal to any organization, Gordimer saw the ANC as the best hope for reversing South Africa's treatment of black citizens. Rather than simply criticizing the organization for its perceived flaws, she advocated joining it to address them. She hid ANC leaders <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>own</b> <b>home</b> to aid their escape from arrest by the government, and she said that the proudest day of her life was when she testified at the 1986 Delmas Treason Trial on behalf of 22 South African anti-apartheid activists. (See Simon Nkoli, Mosiuoa Lekota, etc.) Throughout these years she also regularly took part in anti-apartheid demonstrations in South Africa, and traveled internationally speaking out against South African apartheid and discrimination and political repression.|$|E
500|$|Kutzer {{thinks the}} tale has a [...] "nightmarish quality". Poor Mrs. Tittlemouse cannot keep {{one step ahead}} of the various intruders. Although the house is her own, she has no control over who inhabits it: she finds bees nesting in an empty {{storeroom}} and woodlice hiding in the plate rack. She is trapped <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>own</b> <b>home,</b> her hours occupied with fighting off invaders from without to the point where she is sure she will [...] "go distracted". Although Mr. Jackson drives the unwanted intruders away, he leaves behind a mess of honey smears, moss, thistledown, and dirty footprints that Mrs. Tittlemouse invests two weeks of her life into cleaning up.|$|E
500|$|In Iruvar Mattum (2006), Azhagu (Abhay) {{keeps the}} {{skeletal}} {{remains of his}} mother and frequently talks to her; Sify compared this plot detail to that of Moodu Pani and Psycho.

Actor Veera Bahu stated that he watched Moodu Pani in preparation for his role as a psychopath in the thriller Nadunisi Naaygal.

5000|$|During McKenna's studies, he {{developed}} a technique for cultivating psilocybin mushrooms with Dennis and in 1976, the brothers published what they had learned in a book entitled Psilocybin: Magic Mushroom Grower's Guide, under the pseudonyms [...] "O.T. Oss" [...] and [...] "O.N. Oeric". McKenna and his brother {{were the first to}} come up with a reliable method for cultivating psilocybin mushrooms at home. As ethnobiologist Jonathan Ott explains, [...] "the authors adapted San Antonio's technique (for producing edible mushrooms by casing mycelial cultures on a rye grain substrate; San Antonio 1971) to the production of Psilocybe Stropharia cubensis. The new technique involved the use of ordinary kitchen implements, and for the first time the layperson was able to produce a potent entheogen <b>in</b> his <b>her</b> <b>own</b> <b>home,</b> without access to sophisticated technology, equipment, or chemical supplies." [...] When the 1986 revised edition was published, the Magic Mushroom Grower's Guide had sold over 100,000 copies.|$|R

Additionally, to determine what improvements need to be made either immediately or in the short to medium term to make their homes fully habitable.

At first she thought that all her adventures, the terrible lions, and her promise to the Yellow Dwarf that he should marry Bellissima, must have been a dream, but there was the new cap with its beautiful ribbon and lace to remind her that it was all true, which made her so unhappy that she could neither eat, drink, nor sleep for thinking of it.|$|R
500|$|Another strong {{influence}} on Hutchinson {{was closer to}} {{her home in the}} nearby town of Bilsby. Her brother-in-law, the young minister John Wheelwright, preached a message like that of Cotton. As reformers, both Cotton and Wheelwright encouraged a sense of religious rebirth among their parishioners, but their weekly sermons did not satisfy the yearnings of some Puritan worshippers. [...] This led to the rise of conventicles, which were gatherings of [...] "those who had found grace" [...] to listen to sermon repetitions, discuss and debate scripture, and pray. [...] These gatherings were particularly important to women because they allowed women to take on roles of religious leadership that were otherwise denied them in a male-dominated church hierarchy, according to some modern scholars. Hutchinson was inspired by Cotton and by other women who ran conventicles, and she began holding meetings <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>own</b> <b>home,</b> where she reviewed recent sermons with her listeners, and provided her own explanations of the message.|$|E
500|$|In 1964, de Havilland {{appeared}} {{in her last}} two leading roles in feature filmsboth psychological thrillers. In Walter Grauman's Lady in a Cage, she played a wealthy poet who gets trapped in her mansion's elevator and faces the threat of three terrorizing hooligans <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>own</b> <b>home.</b> Critics responded negatively to the graphic violence and cruelty shown on screen. A.H. Weiler of The New York Times called it a [...] "sordid, if suspenseful, exercise in aimless brutality". That same year, deHavilland {{appeared in}} Robert Aldrich's Hush… Hush, Sweet Charlotte with her close friend Bette Davis. After Joan Crawford left the picture due to illness, Davis had Aldrich fly to Switzerland to persuade a reluctant deHavilland to accept the role of Miriam Deering, a cruel, conniving character hidden behind the charming façade of a polite and cultured lady. Her quiet, restrained performance provided a counterbalance to Davis. Film historian Tony Thomas described her performance as [...] "a subtle piece of acting" [...] that was [...] "a vital contribution {{to the effectiveness of}} the film". The film was well received and earned seven Academy Award nominations.|$|E
500|$|In any case, {{during her}} time in Montreal, Cadron-Jetté made the {{acquaintance}} of Ignace Bourget, Bishop of the Diocese of Montreal. She met Bourget through her attendance at Saint Jacques Cathedral, where he became her spiritual director. Cadron-Jetté joined his Archiconfrérie du Très Saint et Immaculé Coeur de Marie, a group formed by Bourget to pray for the conversion of sinners. Beginning in 1840, Bourget began to call upon Cadron-Jetté to find crisis accommodation for unwed mothers who had approached him for confession and help. This accommodation was to be secret, as unwed mothers carried a significant social stigma {{at the time and}} were often the targets of hostility, and it was to be [...] "with a kind and prayerful woman". Cadron-Jetté undertook this work, and between 1840 and 1845 helped around 25 women during their pregnancy, childbirth, and recovery. She would often place the women with her (now-independent) children, and sometimes offered the women accommodation <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>own</b> <b>home.</b> [...] After the birth of each child, Cadron-Jetté would take the newborn to be baptised at Montreal's Notre Dame church, and stand as godmother for the child.|$|E
25|$|In print media, {{the area}} is a {{frequent}} setting of the Nero Wolfe detective stories by Rex Stout, which ran from 1934 to 1975. An early documented mention of Westchester County is in the Trixie Belden series (which ran from 1948 to 1986). The series was set in Sleepyside-on-Hudson, a fictional village in the Hudson Valley. The original author, Julie Campbell Tatham, modeled the fictional Crabapple Farm <b>in</b> Sleepyside after <b>her</b> <b>own</b> <b>home</b> at Wolf Hollow on Glendale Road in Ossining. She also mentioned it <b>in</b> <b>her</b> last work <b>in</b> the series: Cherry Ames, Country Doctor's Nurse. Westchester is the primary setting and residence of the main characters in The Clique young adult novel series by Lisi Harrison. In Edward Lewis Wallant's novel The Pawnbroker, the main character Sol Nazerman lives in Mount Vernon.|$|R

40|$|Background: Senior {{citizens}} tend to {{live longer}} and longer independently. Judging whether a senior person is still capable of living on his own is often based on the occurrence of incidents, with all consequences thereof. In the specific case of early dementia, the symptoms are not immediately apparent and the occurrence and severity of incidents progress gradually over time. In this case, the children or grandchildren are burdened by the question {{whether or not the}} elderly adult can still live safely and independently <b>in</b> his or <b>her</b> <b>own</b> <b>home.</b> This decision is only based on input obtained through incidental visits. We believe that the capability of independent living can only be objectively judged, by a health professional, if long term objective information on the elderly person's daily activities of living (ADL) is available...|$|R
