5|$|Antonio Ezequiel Cárdenas Guillén (5 March 1962 – 5 November 2010), {{commonly}} referred to by his alias Tony Tormenta ("Tony Storm"), was a Mexican suspected drug lord and co-leader of the Gulf Cartel, a drug trafficking organization based in Tamaulipas. He headed the criminal group along with Jorge Eduardo Costilla Sánchez. Antonio was considered by Mexican security <b>forces</b> <b>as</b> one of Mexico's most-wanted men.|$|E

30|$|As {{mentioned}} in our overview of KiP, shifting to correctly prioritizing the <b>Force</b> <b>as</b> Deflector p-prim {{is key to}} understanding formal Newtonian relationships underlying Newton's first law. diSessa explained the schematization of the <b>Force</b> <b>as</b> Deflector p-prim <b>as</b> follows: ‘A <b>force</b> (e.g., shove) may act in concert with prior motion (momentum) to produce a compromise result, directionally between the two’ (diSessa 1993, pp 218). From the perspective of canonical physics, while <b>Force</b> <b>as</b> Mover neglects {{the role of the}} momentum of an object, <b>Force</b> <b>as</b> Deflector takes that into consideration. Therefore, the latter enables us to correctly predict and explain situations in which application of two impulses on an object along two different directions may result in motion of the object along a ‘compromise’ direction.|$|R
5|$|Even though Thiệu {{used the}} defeat of the South Vietnamese <b>forces</b> <b>as</b> a {{justification}} for the arrest of those generals, his real intention behind the arrests was to avert an imaginary military coup against him. For that reason, he chose to pull the Airborne Division back to III Corps, which was commanded by loyalist officers, instead of the Marine Corps Division.|$|E
5|$|For certain {{physical}} scenarios, it {{is impossible}} to model <b>forces</b> <b>as</b> being due to gradient of potentials. This is often due to macrophysical considerations that yield <b>forces</b> <b>as</b> arising from a macroscopic statistical average of microstates. For example, friction is caused by the gradients of numerous electrostatic potentials between the atoms, but manifests as a force model that is independent of any macroscale position vector. Nonconservative forces other than friction include other contact forces, tension, compression, and drag. However, for any sufficiently detailed description, all these forces are the results of conservative ones since each of these macroscopic forces are the net results of the gradients of microscopic potentials.|$|E

5|$|In 1942, the Comité Interprofessionnel du Vin de Champagne (CIVC) {{was formed}} {{with the purpose}} of {{protecting}} Champagne's reputation and marketing <b>forces</b> <b>as</b> well as setting up and monitoring regulations for vineyard production and vinification methods.

5|$|In June 1996, Solidarity Electoral Action (Akcja Wyborcza Solidarność) {{was founded}} as a {{coalition}} of over 30 parties, uniting liberal, conservative and Christian-democratic <b>forces.</b> <b>As</b> the public became disillusioned with the SLD and its allies, AWS was victorious in the 1997 parliamentary elections. Jerzy Buzek became the new prime minister.|$|E

5|$|Since {{forces are}} {{perceived}} as pushes or pulls, this can provide an intuitive understanding for describing <b>forces.</b> <b>As</b> with other physical concepts (e.g. temperature), the intuitive understanding of forces is quantified using precise operational definitions {{that are consistent with}} direct observations and compared to a standard measurement scale. Through experimentation, it is determined that laboratory measurements of forces are fully consistent with the conceptual definition of force offered by Newtonian mechanics.|$|E

5|$|The {{contact angle}} (θ), {{as seen in}} Figure 1, is the angle at which the liquid–vapor {{interface}} meets the solid-liquid interface. The contact angle {{is determined by the}} result between adhesive and cohesive <b>forces.</b> <b>As</b> the tendency of a drop to spread out over a flat, solid surface increases, the contact angle decreases. Thus, the contact angle provides an inverse measure of wettability.|$|E
