He felt the unaccustomed colour in his cheeks, and an acquaintance who paused to shake hands was astonished at his affability. The gay music sounded strangely to his ears after the great organ notes, but, in its way, it too was beautiful. Life was meant to be beautiful. He had never before felt so sure of it.|$|E

This paper outlines the evolution of the Egyptian banking system since 1856 in an attempt to understand the impact of development and financial policies during the different phases on the bank market structure and competition. The structure-conduct-performance model (SCP) was used to test the relevance of the structure-conduct-performance paradigm (SCP) in the Egyptian banking context using pooled cross-section time series data specifically collected from 47 commercial banks, {{out of a total of}} 59 commercial banks. The paper shows that the Egyptian banking system during the 1980 s and 1990 s faced a mixture of both the domination of public banks and a high degree of concentration which discourages competition on one hand, and the <b>heavy</b> <b>barriers</b> to entry which makes incumbent banks incontestable on the other. However, recent financial liberalization measures eliminated interest rate controls, eased the entry of new financial intermediaries, and allowed new types of instruments. Regulatory impediments were relaxed and the Egyptian banking system become more integrated with the world market. Further reform measures are required at two levels: first, at the banking units level by improving their management, granting them adequate autonomy in decision making, and encouraging training schemes and the acquisition of essential resources for efficient banking. And second, at the banking system level, by encouraging competition and contestability, within an adequate regulatory environment, removing excessive barriers to entry and replacing them with an objective entry criteria and establishing a reliable exit mechanism accompanied with an efficient deposit protection scheme...|$|R

40|$|During {{the course}} of atomic {{transport}} in a host material, impurity atoms need to surmount an energy barrier driven by thermodynamic bias or at ultra-low temperatures by quantum tunneling. In the present article we demonstrate using atomistic simulations that at ultra-low temperature transient inter-layer atomic transport is also possible without tunneling when the Pt/Al(111) impurity/host system self-organizes itself spontaneously into an intermixed configuration. No such extremely fast athermal concerted process has been reported before at ultra low temperatures. The outlined novel transient atomic exchange mechanism could be of general validity. We find {{that the source of}} ultra-low temperature <b>heavy</b> particle <b>barrier</b> crossing is intrinsic and no external bias is necessary for atomic intermixing and surface alloying in Pt/Al although the dynamic barrier height is few eV. The mechanism is driven by the local thermalization of the Al(111) surface in a self-organized manner arranged spontaneously by the system without any external stimulus. The core of the short lived thermalized region reaches the local temperature of ∼ 1000 K (including few tens of Al atoms) while the average temperature of the simulation cell is ∼ 3 K. The transient facilitated intermixing process also takes place with repulsive impurity-host interaction potential leading to negative atomic mobility hence the atomic injection is largely independent of the strength of the impurity-surface interaction. We predict that similar exotic behaviour is possible in other materials as well. Comment: 12 pages, 8 figures, full paper at: [URL]. J. Chem. Phys. (2008), in pres...|$|R

Comparisons between rather symmetric heavy-ion reactions like 238 U on 248 Cm (or heavier targets up to 254 Es) with very asymmetric ones like 18 O on 254 Es reveal that the ones with 238 U as a projectile have the highest potential in the superheavy element region while the latter ones can be advantageous for the synthesis of heavy actinide isotopes.

For this purpose, compacted clay liners, CCL’s, made up of different geomaterials are popularly used as a barrier to contain the waste and to isolate it from the surrounding environment. The efficiency of the engineered landfills in minimizing the contamination of ground water aquifers highly depends on the hydraulic conductivity, sorption capacity and chemical compatibility of the liner materials. In general, the hydraulic conductivity of the liner material is considered while selecting material and designing the engineered landfill liner system, however, sorption characteristics of the geomaterials play a predominant role in mitigating the transport of the contaminants through the liner system and determine its long term performance. In view of the above facts, three different locally available geomaterials have been selected to evaluate their suitability as liner material based on the physical, chemical and hydraulic characteristics. The sorption characteristics of these geomaterials were established by conducting batch sorption experiments, for different heavy metal contaminants and suitable isotherm has been identified to represent the geomaterial-contaminant interaction. Further, the study illustrated its potential application for obtaining the design thickness of landfill liner based on the sorption characteristics of the geomaterial by using the simple numerical tool, POLLUTE.
