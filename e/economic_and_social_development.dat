Coinciding with this agreement, the government announced that official studies would be conducted by Ubon Ratchathani University and a private team contracted by the National <b>Economic</b> <b>and</b> <b>Social</b> <b>Development</b> Board. The university received a budget of 10 million baht (roughly US$280,000), and the government contractors, alleged {{to be the same}} group that recommended damming another river, received 94 million baht (roughly US$2,700,000), raising suspicions. Villagers thought that outside academics {{would not be able to}} make an objective or accurate study of the river because they were unfamiliar with local fish migration and habitats.|$|E

5|$|The UN Charter {{was drafted}} {{at a conference}} between April–June 1945 in San Francisco, and was signed on 26 June 1945 at the {{conclusion}} of the conference; this charter took effect 24 October 1945, and the UN began operation. The UN's mission to preserve world peace was complicated in its early decades by the Cold War between the US and Soviet Union and their respective allies. The organization participated in major actions in Korea and the Congo, as well as approving the creation of the state of Israel in 1947. The organization's membership grew significantly following widespread decolonization in the 1960s, and by the 1970s its budget for <b>economic</b> <b>and</b> <b>social</b> <b>development</b> programmes far outstripped its spending on peacekeeping. After the end of the Cold War, the UN took on major military and peacekeeping missions across the world with varying degrees of success.|$|E
5|$|A First Deputy Premier {{was usually}} given {{responsibility}} over one specific area. For example, Kirill Mazurov {{was responsible for}} industry, and Dmitry Polyansky was agriculture. However, after Polyansky's departure in 1973 Mazurov was left the sole First Deputy Premier until Tikhonov was appointed in 1976. An officeholder could also be responsible for coordinating the activities of ministries and state committees and other subordinate bodies of the Council of Ministers. To do this the First Deputy Premier had to give these bodies guidance in an expeditious manner to ensure the implementation of plans for <b>economic</b> <b>and</b> <b>social</b> <b>development</b> and to check if the orders and decisions of the Council of Ministers were being followed. If the Premier could not perform his duties one of the First Deputy Premiers would take {{on the role of}} acting Premier until the Premier's return. During the late 1970s, when the health of Premier Alexei Kosygin deteriorated, Nikolai Tikhonov, the First Deputy Premier, acted on his behalf during his absence. When Tikhonov took command of the Soviet economy, Kosygin served in a standby role. At a Central Committee plenum in June 1980, the Soviet economic development plan was outlined by Tikhonov, and not Kosygin.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: South Africa is characterised by {{widespread}} {{inequality and}} divided societies, which impede <b>economic</b> growth <b>and</b> <b>social</b> <b>development.</b> Basic <b>and</b> <b>social</b> infrastructure investment {{can assist in}} addressing these challenges by promoting <b>economic</b> growth <b>and</b> <b>social</b> <b>development.</b> The {{aim of this study}} is to determine if basic <b>and</b> <b>social</b> infrastructure investment differently effect <b>economic</b> growth <b>and</b> <b>social</b> <b>development</b> indicators of urban and rural municipalities respectively. We use a balanced panel data set containing infrastructure, <b>economic,</b> demographic <b>and</b> <b>social</b> indicators for rural and urban municipalities for the period from 1996 to 2012. To address the research question we construct synthetic indices of basic <b>and</b> <b>social</b> infrastructure, using principal component analysis, to be used in panel regression estimations. To estimate our <b>economic</b> growth <b>and</b> <b>social</b> <b>development</b> functions we make use of restricted within LSDV estimation techniques. We use the results on the respective elasticities to evaluate whether the differences between urban and rural municipalities are statistically significant. Our results show that the elasticities of basic <b>and</b> <b>social</b> infrastructure investment generally are more pronounced for <b>economic</b> growth <b>and</b> <b>social</b> <b>development</b> indicators in rural municipalities than in urban municipalities. These findings could potentially influence policy decisions in terms of infrastructure investment in favour of rural municipalities to increase <b>economic</b> growth <b>and</b> <b>social</b> <b>development</b> in these regions, which could contribute to the reduction of spatial inequalities in South Africa...|$|R
