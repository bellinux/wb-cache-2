25|$|Research is {{currently}} ongoing {{in determining the}} physiological role of satellite glial cells. Current theories suggest that SGCs have {{a significant role in}} controlling the microenvironment of the sympathetic ganglia. This is based on the observation that SGCs almost completely envelop the neuron and can regulate the diffusion of molecules across the cell membrane. It has been previously shown that when fluorescent protein tracers are injected into the cervical ganglion in order to bypass the circulatory system, they are not found on the neuron surface. This suggests that the SGCs can regulate the extracellular space of individual neurons. Some speculate that SGCs in the autonomic ganglia have a similar role to the blood–brain barrier as a <b>functional</b> <b>barrier</b> to large molecules.|$|E
50|$|Dissociation, {{a theory}} {{originally}} applied by Pierre Janet, implies {{the view of}} the conscious self as being totally suspended. Dissociation, when referring to post-hypnotic amnesia, can be applied when the whole period in which an individual is hypnotized is looked at as an episode that is separated from the rest of that individual's experiences by boundaries of amnesia and suggestion. The failure to recall memory when in a normal, conscious state provides evidence to suggest that some kind of <b>functional</b> <b>barrier</b> is holding the information retained during hypnosis back from conscious recall. However, how sufficient the dissociative barrier in a hypnotic patient's mind is seems to be not all that effective, thus diminishing the credibility of the dissociation theory. This is easily seen in several studies where engaging in a secondary hypnotic session or the suggestion of the hypnotist or therapist to retrieve and recall information and events from the hypnotic session, readily and accurately initiate the retrieval that, according to dissociation, should be blocked from retrieval.|$|E

40|$|The {{starting}} point of this work {{was the fact that}} functional barriers are in most cases already in-situ-contaminated due to the thermally extreme coextrusion conditions of the manufacturing process. As a consequence, middle layer contaminants may already have penetrated the <b>functional</b> <b>barrier</b> of a food package and may provide direct contact with the foodstuff at the time when the package is filled. Nevertheless, depending on the individual food package parameters, the remaining <b>functional</b> <b>barrier</b> efficiency can still prevent inadmissible migration. To meet this real-life situation and to describe the underlying migration process a theoretical migration model was developed and experimentally verified in this work using artificially contaminated multilayer HIPS sheets with different <b>functional</b> <b>barrier</b> thickness.

40|$|The {{aim of this}} Ph. D. was to {{investigate}} the possibility to use recycled plastics in food packaging applications. In order to protect the consumer, this can be achieved through their incorporation in <b>functional</b> <b>barrier</b> structures. Thus, a lag time is introduced in the migration of random contaminants. For this purpose, the efficiency of two polymers, High Density Polyethylene and Isotactic Polypropylene, was studied through the conduction of challenge tests, migration tests and sorption tests. The results showed that the former represents a bad solution as a <b>functional</b> <b>barrier,</b> while the latter is a possible candidate after proper treatment. The migration tests were, on a second level, simulated through a mathematical model of finite differences. The simulation showed {{that it is possible to}} predict the lag time of migration with the use of the intrinsic diffusion coefficient and the value K= 1 for the partition coefficient. ...|$|E

40|$|<b>Functional</b> <b>barriers</b> form {{parts of}} {{multi-layer}} packaging materials, which are deemed {{to protect the}} food from migration of {{a broad range of}} contaminants, e. g. those associated with reused packaging. Often, neither the presence nor the identity of the contaminants is known, so that safety assessment of the materials has to rely on predictive tools. Several complementary freeware described here allow one to model diffusion in multi-layer films. These tools require the input of parameters that are not easy to determine or predict. Previous work has focused on the prediction of diffusion coefficients at storage temperatures of packaging in contact with food. However, many other kinetic and thermodynamic parameters are needed to describe transport properties during the processing of a material at high temperature and during its shelf-life. All parameters needed for the calculations are discussed. In order to propose default values, the approach consists of (1) reviewing the available literature data, (2) running experiments on polypropylene, polyethylene and poly(ethylene vinyl alcohol) in typical conditions (separately diffusion during processing and migration) and (3) simulating numerical sets for typical situations. Several freeware are proposed to simulate migration from multi-layers and <b>functional</b> <b>barriers</b> using the default parameters...|$|R

40|$|A <b>functional</b> <b>barrier</b> (FB) can be {{generally}} {{defined as a}} package construction that limits the amount of migration compounds from the package to an acceptable degree. Most commonly the package is a multilayer structure and the migrating compounds originate from the package interior encapsulated by plastics barrier layers. The degree of "acceptability" which {{is controlled by the}} toxocological evaluation or the organoleptical impact of the respective compound is either defined by law through individual specific migration limits or a general threshold of regulation or by the quality assurance requirements to a certain product. The FB efficienca - understood as a migration related term - depends on the numerous parameters which are connected with the type of polymer and foodstuff as well as the food packaging application. Since one of the more important parameters is the plastic's diffusivity, materials such as PET have an advantage over low diffusivity plastics such as polyolefines which le ads to the current market developments with respect to PET recycling.

40|$|Purpose: This study {{seeks to}} {{investigate}} barriers in the consumer adoption process of technological innovations under different contingencies. The paper aims to focus on barriers impeding adoption of technologies characterized by high incompatibility and high uncertainty - i. e. a "lack of content" (LoC) situation - versus technologies characterized by low incompatibility and low uncertainty - i. e. a "presence of content" (PoC) situation. Design/methodology/approach: Based on a literature study, the paper develops hypotheses that distinguish the diverging effects of both psychological and <b>functional</b> <b>barriers</b> on consumer adoption in different situations (LoC versus PoC). Data were collected {{by means of a}} survey, resulting in an effective sample of 229 respondents. Findings: In the case of LoC, the value, risk (financial and performance) and image barrier are negatively related to adoption intention, where the latter barrier is significantly stronger for the LoC situation than for the PoC situation. For PoC, it is found that the value, image, and financial risk barriers are negatively related to adoption intention, where the value barrier outweighs all other barriers. Interestingly, the traditional barrier reveals a positive effect on adoption intention. Practical implications: The results suggest that managers and retailers should develop a more sophisticated understanding of consumers' adoption intention of new technologies. Distinguishing between LoC and PoC situations offers managers the opportunity to differentiate their communication strategies and design more compelling ways for consumers to overcome the specific barriers they perceive in each situation. Originality/value: The paper attempts to offer a more fine-grained understanding of consumer adoption by investigating {{the extent to which the}} lack versus the presence of content gives rise to differences regarding the effects of psychological and <b>functional</b> <b>barriers</b> to technology adoption. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited...|$|R
