40|$|This study {{attempted}} {{to evaluate the}} effect of <b>dihexyverine</b> HCl (Metaspas), an anticholinergic and direct smooth muscle relaxant (spasmolytic), in shortening {{the first stage of}} labour. One hundred and five patients constituted the series: 31 were primiparae, 27 secundiparae and 47 multiparae. The majority of these (95) received one intramuscular injection (10 mg.) of <b>dihexyverine.</b> Alphaprodine (Nisentil), 40 mg., was administered in all but 10 cases, since <b>dihexyverine</b> has no analgesic action. Seventy-five control patients were used: 25 were primiparae, 25 secundiparae and 25 multiparae. Alphaprodine alone was administered to these control patients. The length of time for dilatation from 4 cm. to 10 cm. was the selected criterion. In the control group, the average time for complete cervical dilatation was 4 hours, 10 minutes. In the group treated by <b>dihexyverine,</b> complete dilatation was achieved in 1 hour, 16 minutes. On the average, the first stage of labour was 2 hours and 54 minutes shorter with dihexyverine; the clinical effect begins 10 - 30 minutes after administration. The only side effect encountered was a skin rash in one patient...|$|E
