40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the effect of}} periglacial processes on {{that part of the}} Lincoln Scarp which is to be crossed by the Lincoln Relief Road. The scarp crest has been extensively modified with the development of small cambered blocks and major gulls parallel to the principal joint direction in the Lincolnshire Limestone. Geophysical investigation has re-vealed a marked increase in seismic velocity of the basal units of limestone as the degree of alteration decreases <b>down</b> <b>dip</b> (1855 m sec- 1 near the crest and 5000 msec-t 300 metres <b>down</b> <b>dip).</b> Electrical conductivity techniques have proved successful in the location of gulls. Upper Lias clays, which form the scarp, are covered by solifluction deposits and both materials have been affected by processes interpreted as periglacial mass wasting. Relic pla-nar slides associated with the mass wasting have been reacti-vated during periods of high seepage rates from the Lime-stone and underlying Northampton Sandstone units. Accu-rate topographi c profiles have been used to determine the nature of complex, shallow rotational slide failures on the upper slopes of the scarp...|$|R

40|$|A {{potential}} problem with CO 2 Injection in oil reservoirs with gas caps is that gas cap may be contaminated by CO 2. This {{could be an}} issue on the Heidrun Field where <b>down</b> <b>dip</b> using CO 2 -WAG is considered. Compositional reservoir simulations should be performed to investigate if the injected CO 2 will form a stable CO 2 layer below the hydrocarbon gas cap or if the CO 2 will be mixed with the hydrocarbon gas before or during {{the production of the}} gas cap. The project thesis will be started with an existing black oil sector model (from Upper Tilje Formation in Segment H and I form Heidrun field). The sector model (or a part of it) should first be converted to a compositional model (Eclipse 300) using an existing equation of state. A number of predictions should be performed, starting with <b>down</b> <b>dip</b> WAG at constant reservoir pressure followed by depletion of the gas cap. The project thesis will discuss also how to optimize the amount of gas that can be produced before CO 2 breakthrough by considering different alternatives for gas production wells.

50|$|The rupture of {{the plate}} {{interface}} that caused the earthquake, occurred in two distinct stages, from study of surface and body wave data {{and the distribution of}} aftershocks.

40|$|Two {{contemporaneous}} weakly confined deepwater systems form Unit B of the Permian Laingsburg Formation {{are sufficiently}} well-exposed to allow {{investigation of the}} <b>down</b> <b>dip</b> passage from channelized base of slope to distributive deposits over a 25 kmdip section, with strike control over some 20 km. A high resolution stratigraphy was established over a 1200 m strike section in the proximal Skeiding locality and extended regionally at a coarser scale. Analysis indicates that Unit B comprises 3 depositional sequences which, at a regional scale, thin towards the N and E. The lowstand systems tract of sequence 1 comprises weakly confined high-aspect ratio, vertically stacked channels cut into a basal frontal lobe system, and are overlain by a regionally correlated condensed hemipelagic mudstone interval (combined TST/HST) that shows evidence of remobilisation in up-dip areas The LST of sequence 2 includes two superimposed channel complexes of different styles that become deeply entrenched 5 km <b>down</b> <b>dip</b> and pass basinward into tabular, distributive lobe sandstones. Sequence 3 {{is marked by a}} regional 100 m thick levee complex related to a lower slope channel system and marks a basinward shift in facies. Channel fills in the lowstand systems tracts of all 3 sequences commonly include a thin drape of mudstone-clast conglomerate over the basal erosion surface, onlapped by thin-bedded sandstones with tractional structures that exhibit a characteristic axis to off-axis transition in facies. These deposits accumulated during periods of sediment bypass and are overlain by amalgamated structureless sandstones which thin from the axis into characteristic wings that extend laterally up to 200 m. Levees are absent in the lower two sequences and flows appear to have been only weakly confined by basal erosional keels. The resultant succession is extremely sandstone rich (90...|$|R

30|$|Regarding the {{secondary}} fault structures, {{one of the}} main features is the foreshock fault plane (hereafter, Fault F) <b>dipping</b> <b>down</b> to NNW, where we assumed the location of the mainshock hypocenter after assessing the possibility of the nucleation. Interestingly, we can observe a geologically identified fault trace above Fault F, where the strike of this geologic fault coincides with that of Fault F (Kato et al. 1989) although we do not assume the continuity each other. Other remarkable features are shallow low-angle branch fault (hereafter Fault B 1) and a conjugate fault (hereafter Fault H 2) assumed for the northern part, inferred from the aftershock distribution (Panayotopoulos et al. 2016) and the field surveys (Okada et al. 2015). Fault B 1 is merged to Fault B 2 at depth, converged to the primary fault <b>down</b> <b>dip.</b> This geometrical complexity in the north may correlate with the decreased fault activity in the north mentioned above. In addition, we assumed a prominent high-angle branch (hereafter, Fault H 1) at the deeper part of the north section, where a delayed activation of strike-slip-type aftershocks was observed. The activation of Fault H 1 cannot be explained in the current stress field, and therefore, the physical reason behind its current activity is of a great interest.|$|R
