25|$|Akita's {{early work}} {{consisted}} of <b>industrial</b> <b>noise</b> music made from tape loops and conventional instruments. Similar to his present albums, he produced lengthy, disorienting pieces. He also became {{famous for the}} sheer volume of his releases.|$|E
25|$|In 1981, the percussionist F.M. Einheit (from the Hamburg band Abwärts) joined Einstürzende Neubauten {{and they}} {{released}} their first LP Kollaps, {{a mixture of}} rough punk tunes and <b>industrial</b> <b>noises.</b> The <b>industrial</b> <b>noises</b> were obtained from self-made music machines, electronics, and found objects such as metal plates. The live performances with Einheit in the 1980s included lots of metal banging and destruction on stage.|$|R
50|$|Kollaps was {{the first}} {{official}} LP by Einstürzende Neubauten, released in 1981 on German label ZickZack as #ZZ 65. The songs are a mixture of rough punk tunes and <b>industrial</b> <b>noises.</b> The <b>industrial</b> <b>noises</b> were obtained from self-made music machines, electronics, and found objects such as metal plates. The album was reissued in 2002 with Stahldubversions, originally released in 1982.Blixa Bargeld, N.U. Unruh, and F.M. Einheit appear on the album.|$|R

25|$|Pioneering {{research}} on the perception of sounds at different frequencies was conducted by Fletcher and Munson in the 1930s. Their work led to a standard way of weighting measured sound levels within investigations of <b>industrial</b> <b>noise</b> and hearing loss. Frequency weightings have since been used within filter and controller designs to manage performance within bands of interest.|$|E
25|$|The curves were {{originally}} defined for use at different average sound levels, but A-weighting, though originally intended {{only for the}} measurement of low-level sounds (around 40 phon), is now commonly used for the measurement of environmental noise and <b>industrial</b> <b>noise,</b> as well as when assessing potential hearing damage and other noise health effects at all sound levels; indeed, the use of A-frequency-weighting is now mandated for all these measurements, although it is badly suited for these purposes, being only applicable to low levels so that it tends to devalue the effects of low frequency noise in particular.|$|E
500|$|The {{opening track}} [...] "No Church in the Wild" [...] {{features}} a cinematic production style. Singers Frank Ocean and The-Dream lend their voices to the album's grim opener, which sets the mood with a gnarled guitar sample. Over the rock-centric, rolling production, both rappers muse over familiar themes of loyalty, sexuality and maternal solidarity. The pop-oriented [...] "Lift Off" [...] features baroque strings and a chorus sung by Beyoncé Knowles, accompanied with synthesizers. The song contains horns and martial drums as Knowles sings, [...] "We gon' {{take it to}} the moon/ Take it to the stars." [...] "Niggas in Paris" [...] incorporates staccato orchestration and fizzing <b>industrial</b> <b>noise,</b> topping it all off with a menacing beat and icy synthesizer notes. The track features an unusual sampling of dialogue from the 2007 film Blades of Glory, notably the [...] "we're gonna skate to one song and one song only" [...] line. West and Jay-Z's lyrics frame their rags to riches story on the song.|$|E

2500|$|In the 1970s, {{the concept}} of art itself {{expanded}} and groups like Survival Research Laboratories, Borbetomagus and Elliott Sharp embraced and extended the most dissonant and least approachable aspects of these musical/spatial concepts. Around the same time, the first postmodern wave of <b>industrial</b> <b>noise</b> music appeared with Throbbing Gristle, Cabaret Voltaire, and NON (aka Boyd Rice). These cassette culture releases often featured zany tape editing, stark percussion and repetitive loops distorted {{to the point where}} they may degrade into harsh noise. In the 1970s and 1980s, <b>industrial</b> <b>noise</b> groups like Current 93, Hafler Trio, Throbbing Gristle, Coil, Laibach, Steven Stapleton, Thee Temple ov Psychick Youth, Smegma, Nurse with Wound, Einstürzende Neubauten, The Haters, and The New Blockaders performed <b>industrial</b> <b>noise</b> music mixing loud metal percussion, guitars, and unconventional [...] "instruments" [...] (such as jackhammers and bones) in elaborate stage performances. These industrial artists experimented with varying degrees of noise production techniques. Interest in the use of shortwave radio also developed at this time, particularly evident in the recordings and live performances of John Duncan. Other postmodern art movements influential to post-industrial noise art are Conceptual Art and the Neo-Dada use of techniques such as assemblage, montage, bricolage, and appropriation. Bands like Test Dept, Clock DVA, Factrix, Autopsia, Nocturnal Emissions, Whitehouse, Severed Heads, Sutcliffe Jügend, and SPK soon followed.|$|E
2500|$|Following {{the wake}} of <b>industrial</b> <b>noise,</b> noise rock, no wave, and harsh noise, {{there has been a}} flood of noise musicians whose ambient, microsound, or glitch-based work is often subtler to the ear. Kim Cascone refers to this {{development}} as a postdigital movement and describes it as an [...] "aesthetic of failure." [...] Some of this music has seen wide distribution thanks to peer-to-peer file sharing services and netlabels offering free releases. Goodman characterizes this widespread outpouring of free noise based media as a [...] "noise virus." ...|$|E
5000|$|Jutro u fabrici is an EP by the Serbian noise-rock band Klopka Za Pionira, {{released}} in 2005 (see 2005 in music) on the Ne-ton independent label. The album {{has only one}} instrumental song of harsh <b>noise</b> consisting of <b>industrial</b> <b>noises</b> and loops treated electronically with many effects.|$|R
50|$|The major stylistic {{turning point}} came in 2003 with the {{creation}} of their track “We”. The signature sound from this point onwards combined epic vocal/choral textures with hard <b>industrial</b> <b>noises.</b> These features of the music bear comparison to the Justice (French band) sound which arose at the same time.|$|R
50|$|Martial {{industrial}} a subgenre of syncretic post-industrial music {{characterized by}} <b>industrial</b> <b>noises,</b> dark ambient atmospheres, neofolk melodies, dark wave tunes and neoclassical orchestrations {{as well as}} the incorporation of audio from military marches, historical speeches and political, apolitical or metapolitical lyrics. Unlike other post-industrial genres, martial industrial is typically interested more in a particular worldview or philosophy than pure experimentalism.|$|R
2500|$|Offshore {{gas and oil}} {{development}} in the Okhotsk Sea within [...] of the primary feeding ground off northeast Sakhalin Island is of particular concern. Activities related to oil and gas exploration, including geophysical seismic surveying, pipelaying and drilling operations, increased vessel traffic, and oil spills, all pose potential threats to western gray whales. Disturbance from underwater <b>industrial</b> <b>noise</b> may displace whales from critical feeding habitat. Physical habitat damage from drilling and dredging operations, combined with possible impacts of oil and chemical spills on benthic prey communities also warrants concern.|$|E
2500|$|Cluster's first release, an eponymous {{debut in}} 1971 on Philips, {{was the first}} major label release for the musicians. Previous Kluster works had been small or private label {{releases}} with no more than 300 copies pressed and sold. This album and the 1972 follow-up were a musical bridge between the avant-garde, discordant, proto-industrial sound of Kluster and the softer and more controlled ambient and rock sounds of their mid to late '70s albums. Cluster (later reissued as Cluster '71) has little or no discernible melody or beat. Allmusic review describes it, in part as [...] "...a dislocating, disorienting meld of random space music, <b>industrial</b> <b>noise,</b> proto-ambient atmospherics, feedback, and soundwash..." [...] The first album is also the only Cluster release on which Conny Plank is listed as a full third member of the band. He is credited as a composer and producer on Cluster II. Cluster signed with the influential Krautrock label Brain Records for their second release, a relationship which would continue through 1975.|$|E
