5|$|Even {{though the}} Chinese and North Koreans were {{exhausted}} by the war and were prepared to end it by late 1952, Stalin insisted that they continue fighting, and the Armistice was approved only in July 1953, after Stalin's death. North Korean leader Kim <b>Il</b> <b>Sung</b> created a highly centralized, totalitarian dictatorship – which continues to date – according himself unlimited power and generating a formidable cult of personality. In the South, the American-backed strongman Syngman Rhee ran a significantly less brutal but deeply corrupt and authoritarian regime. After Rhee was overthrown in 1960, South Korea fell within a year under a period of military rule that lasted until the re-establishment of a multi-party system in the late 1980s.|$|E
5|$|On August 22 the North Korean premier, Kim <b>Il</b> <b>Sung,</b> {{had ordered}} his forces to {{conclude}} {{the war by}} September 1, yet {{the scale of the}} offensive did not allow this. Groups 1 and 2 were to begin their attack at 23:30 on August 31, and Groups 3, 4 and 5 would begin their attacks at 18:00 on September 2. The attacks were to closely connect in order to overwhelm UN troops at each point simultaneously, forcing breakthroughs in multiple places that the UN would be unable to reinforce. The North Koreans relied primarily on night attacks to counter UN air superiority and naval firepower, with the North Korean generals believing that such attacks would prevent UN forces from firing effectively and result in heavy casualties from friendly fire.|$|E
5|$|The political, {{social, and}} {{economic}} crises also touched {{the issue of}} who would succeed Houphouët-Boigny as head of state. After severing ties with his former political heir Philippe Yacé in 1980, who, {{as president of the}} National Assembly, was entitled to exercise the full functions of President of the Republic if the Head of State was incapacitated or absent, Houphouët-Boigny delayed {{as much as he could}} in officially designating a successor. The president's health became increasingly fragile, with Prime Minister Alassane Ouattara administering the country from 1990 onwards, while the president was hospitalised in France. There was a struggle for power, which ended when Houphouët-Boigny rejected Ouattara in favour of Henri Konan Bédié, the President of the National Assembly. In December 1993, Houphouët-Boigny, terminally ill with prostate cancer, was urgently flown back to Côte d'Ivoire so he could die there. He was kept on life support to ensure that the last dispositions concerning his succession were defined. After his family consented, Houphouët-Boigny was disconnected from life support at 6:35am GMT on 7 December. At the time of his death, Houphouët-Boigny was the longest-serving leader in Africa and the third in the world, after Fidel Castro of Cuba and Kim <b>Il</b> <b>Sung</b> of North Korea.|$|E

25|$|Kim Jong-il did {{not make}} a speech at the first session of the 10th SPA in 1998. Instead, members listened to a tape-recorded speech of the late Kim <b>Il</b> <b>Sung,</b> which was made at the first session of the 9th SPA, in 1991. The {{enhanced}} status of the Korean People's Army was anticipated by the SPA election July 1998, when 101 military officials were elected out of 687 delegates. This was a large increase from the 57 military officials elected during the 9th SPA in 1990.|$|E
25|$|Today, the CPC (ML) {{tends to}} be {{supportive}} of North Korea's right to self-determination, although it does not promote Kim <b>Il</b> <b>Sung</b> and Kim Jong-il or Juche in the manner that it promoted Enver Hoxha and Mao Zedong in previous years. However, it issued a statement mourning the death of Kim Jong-il. Since the overturn of socialism in the Soviet bloc, the CPC (ML) has largely abandoned its previously strident anti-revisionist position. The CPC (ML) has become strongly supportive of Cuba and the Cuban Revolution and now has close relations with the Cuban Embassy in Ottawa. It prints the English language edition of the Cuban Communist Party's newspaper, Granma, for Canadian distribution.|$|E
25|$|By the 1940s badges showing Mao {{by himself}} or {{together}} with other important people were being produced in small numbers as commemorative medals or as awards for service to the communist party or to the army. Unlike the later Cultural Revolution period badges, which normally portrayed Mao by himself, these badges frequently portrayed Mao {{side by side with}} other Chinese revolutionary figures such as Zhu De, Chen Yi, He Long, Lin Biao and Lu Xun, or showed Mao with communist leaders from other countries, such as Stalin and Kim <b>Il</b> <b>Sung.</b> During this period badges were smaller but more robust than the Cultural Revolution period badges, and some badges produced during the 1950s were even made of gold (initially 22 carat, but later reduced to 13 or 14 carat).|$|E

25|$|All {{candidates}} are {{selected by the}} Democratic Front for the Reunification of the Fatherland in mass meetings held to decide which candidates will be nominated and their names can only go on the ballot paper {{with the approval of}} the meeting. The Democratic Front for the Reunification of the Fatherland is a popular front dominated by the Korean Worker's Party, in which almost all power rests. The other participants in the coalition include the two other de facto legal political parties, the Korean Social Democratic Party and the Chondoist Chongu Party, as well as various other member organizations including social groups and youth groups, such as the Korean section of the Pioneer movement, the Kim <b>Il</b> <b>Sung</b> Socialist Youth League, the Korean Democratic Women's League, and the Red Cross Society of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.|$|E
25|$|While {{awaiting}} the long-ballyhooed communist spring offensive, the U.S. improved its forward air control procedures. Lacking the institutional memory to recall prior experience during World War II, the Americans reinvented all-weather bombing and night FAC operations. Newer radio jeeps with 12 channels replaced {{the older ones}} that had only four. Ordnance specialists began loading proximity fused bombs matched to specific targets. Forward airfields were opened to stage aircraft closer to the enemy. When the communist offensive began on 22 April 1951, the 337,000 attacking troops disregarded UN air power and paid a heavy price for it. Tactical aviation from three aircraft carriers became available for close air support on 18 May. In mid-May, radar guided night air strikes killed communist troops within 400 yards of the U.S. 2nd Division, to General Almond's delight. However, even with copious air support, the UN forces gave ground until the communist attack petered out. Then they counter-attacked. Although they drove the communists back, {{for the first time}} the latter did not withdraw out of artillery range as usual to regroup, but clung in place. On 1 July 1951, North Korean Premier Kim <b>Il</b> <b>Sung</b> and General Peng Te-huai agreed to a cease fire as both sides settled into fixed positions. As the communists dug in, there were fewer and less worthy targets vulnerable to tactical air strikes.|$|E
500|$|Films in North Korea {{were made}} by {{government}} film studios and had clear political messages. The first was My Home Village (1949), on the liberation of Korea from the Japanese, presented {{as the work of}} Kim <b>Il</b> <b>Sung</b> without help from the Americans. Similarly, the country's films about the Korean War show victory without help from the Chinese. The film scholar Johannes Schönherr concludes that the purpose of these films is [...] "to portray North Korea as a country under siege", and that since the U.S. and its [...] "puppet" [...] South Korea invaded the North once, they would do so again.|$|E

500|$|At {{the end of}} World War II, the Korean Peninsula, which up to {{that point}} had been {{occupied}} by the Empire of Japan, was divided along the 38th Parallel. [...] To the north, the Soviet Union (USSR) occupied the country, which established itself as a communist state, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea under Kim <b>Il</b> <b>Sung.</b> [...] To the south, the United States (US) occupied the country, establishing the Republic of Korea under an autocratic anti-communist leader, Syngman Rhee. As tensions rose between the US and the USSR, each government in Korea claimed it had sovereignty over the whole country.|$|E

On July 27, 1953, Peng personally signed the Armistice agreement in Panmunjom, ending the Korean War. At a mass rally in Pyongyang on July 31, Kim <b>Il</b> <b>Sung</b> awarded Peng his second North Korean [...] "National Flag" [...] Order of Merit, First Class (the first had been awarded to Peng in 1951), and awarded Peng the title of [...] "Hero of the Korean Democratic People's Republic". Peng also received a hero's welcome in Tiananmen Square on August 11. Chinese troops remained in North Korea until 1958.|$|E

2500|$|Triumphal arches have {{continued}} to be built into the modern era, often as statements of power and self-aggrandizement by dictators. Adolf Hitler planned to build the world's largest triumphal arch in Berlin.

It {{was intended to be}} carved with the names of Germany's 1.8 million dead in the First World War. However, construction was never begun. North Korea's dictator Kim <b>Il</b> <b>Sung</b> built the world's largest triumphal arch in Pyongyang in 1982. It was designed to be substantially bigger than the Arc de Triomphe in Paris and was erected on the site where, on October 14, 1945, Kim <b>Il</b> <b>Sung</b> gave his first public speech to the North Korean people. It is decorated with sculptures and reliefs depicting [...] "the triumphal returning of the victorious Great Leader to the country".|$|E

2500|$|In North Korea, the hanja {{system was}} once {{completely}} banned since June 1949 due to fears of collapsed containment of the country; during the 1950s, Kim <b>Il</b> <b>Sung</b> had condemned {{all sorts of}} foreign languages (even the newly proposed New Korean Orthography).
