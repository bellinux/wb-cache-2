5|$|Drosera anglica, {{commonly}} known as the <b>English</b> <b>sundew</b> or great sundew, is a carnivorous plant species belonging to the sundew family Droseraceae. It is a temperate species with a generally circumboreal range, although it does occur as far south as Japan, southern Europe, and the island of Kauai in Hawaii, where it grows as a subtropical sundew. It is thought to originate from an amphidiploid hybrid of D. rotundifolia and D. linearis, meaning that a sterile hybrid between these two species doubled its chromosomes to produce fertile progeny which stabilized into the current D. anglica.|$|E
5|$|Drosera anglica {{grows in}} open, non-forested habitat with wet, often calcium-rich soils. These include bogs, marl fens, quaking bogs, cobble shores, and other {{calcareous}} habitats. This tolerance of calcium is relatively {{rare in the}} rest of the genus. D. anglica is often associated with various sphagnum mosses, and many times grows in a soil substrate that is entirely composed of living, dead, or decomposed sphagnum. The sphagnum wicks moisture to the surface while simultaneously acidifying it. What soil nutrients are not seeped away by the constant moisture are often used up by the sphagnum or made unavailable by the low soil pH. Since nutrient availability is low, competition from other plants is diminished, allowing the carnivorous <b>English</b> <b>sundew</b> to flourish.|$|E

In Rospuda Valley there are also other rare and {{protected}} plants including: dwarf birch (Betula humilis), Greek valerian (Polemonium caeruleum), <b>English</b> <b>sundew</b> (Drosera anglica), round-leaved sundew (Drosera rotundifolia), Turk's cap lily (Lilium martagon) etc.|$|E

5000|$|Most of the forested {{areas in}} Pinckney are on land too steep or deemed {{otherwise}} unsuitable for agriculture. The stands that remain {{are smaller than}} 100 acre and consist of deciduous trees, like white oak, red oak, black oak and hickory. The flatter terrain that was originally used as farmland was allowed to become overgrown with native plants like goldenrod and black-eyed susan, but invasive plants like knapweed, quack grass, timothy-grass, and white sweet clover have also taken hold. Other plants found in Pinckney, like the white lady's-slipper and rosepink, are classified as [...] "threatened" [...] and are protected under Michigan law. Other species found in the park, like <b>English</b> <b>sundew,</b> are classified as [...] "special concern." ...|$|E
