40|$|Abstract-one of the {{important}} and challenging matters in sensor network is energy of life span of nodes in the network. <b>Directed</b> <b>routing</b> algorithm is one of propounded methods in sensor networks which are a data-oriented algorithm. This algorithm focuses on saving energy within life span of network nodes. One of problems of directed diffusion method is existence of multiple routes. Now, consider that some sinks from the same origin request the same data who's Data Volume is very much. <b>Directed</b> <b>routing</b> algorithm establishes one route toward targeted route for each query. The problem of this algorithm is multiplicity of routes for the same data. Therefore, if we can establish a route which has the most common feature with regards to nodes which forms the route, we have prevented wasting energy. In this paper, it is tried to remove problem of multiplicity of routes for the same data by learning automata. We named this algorithm RDDLA. RDDLA decrease overhead and energy in the network Considerable against with some others methods. Keywords-component...|$|R

5|$|M-62 {{was formed}} before 1924 along {{a portion of}} its current routing. The {{trunkline}} started at the Indiana state line and ran north through Edwardsburg and Cassopolis. The northern terminus was at M-40 (now M-51) in Dowagiac. The southern section was moved {{by the end of}} 1925 to follow a more <b>direct</b> <b>routing</b> between Edwardsburg and the state line. An extension in 1930 moved the northern terminus west into Berrien County, ending in Eau Claire. The final few miles of highway were transferred back in local control around 1957. Before the transfer, M-62 ran concurrently with M-140 west and continued into Eau Claire. After the transfer, M-62 ended at the eastern M-140 junction and the concurrency was removed.|$|E
5|$|Two {{sections}} {{of what is}} now NY167 were included as part of legislative routes when the New York State Legislature created a statewide legislative route system in 1908. From Richfield Springs to Paines Hollow, it was designated as part of Route5, which continued southeast to Kingston via Oneonta and northwest to Mohawk. The section {{of what is now}} NY167 north of Little Falls became part of Route26, which ran from Little Falls to Remsen via Dolgeville. In 1910, Route26 was realigned to follow a more <b>direct</b> <b>routing</b> between Little Falls and Remsen via Middleville and Poland.

25|$|In the mid-1920s, NY52 was {{assigned}} {{to a series of}} highways connecting Dansville to Geneva by way of Wayland and Naples. The alignment of NY52 east of Naples was largely identical to that of modern NY245; however, between Middlesex and Rushville, NY52 utilized modern NY364 and NY247 instead. Initially, NY52 passed through Cohocton on its way from Wayland to Naples; it was realigned to follow a more <b>direct</b> <b>routing</b> between Wayland and Naples by 1930. In the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York, most of NY52 was incorporated into NY39, a new route extending from Dunkirk to Geneva. Unlike NY52, NY39 went directly from Middlesex to Rushville. Also assigned as part of the renumbering was NY245, which began in Pike and ended at Perry Center. It followed what is now NY39 from Pike to Perry and NY246 from Perry to Perry Center. NY245 was rerouted north of Perry in September1933 to follow a new highway (modern NY39) northeast to a new terminus at Pine Tavern.|$|E
25|$|Construction for the {{proposed}} extension of US 93 was approved on August 21, 1942. On October 11, 1946, the highway between US 89 near Wickenburg and US 66 in Kingman was officially added to the state highway system as State Route 93. The hope was that SR 93 would eventually become the long-awaited extension of US 93 south of Kingman. The early route of SR 93 took a southeast jog to SR 71 and US 89 in Congress. Between 1956 ad 1961, SR 93 was redirected onto a more <b>direct</b> <b>routing</b> to SR 71 southwest of Congress. In 1954, the SR 93 designation was extended south along US 89, US 60, US 70, US 80, SR 87, SR 387 and SR 84 to the United StatesMexico International Border in Nogales. SR 93 now served the cities of Phoenix, Casa Grande and Tucson. In 1958, the Arizona Highway Department proposed for the original section of SR 93 to become an extension of US 93. During the AASHO meeting on June 26, 1958, the request was denied. At the time {{the proposed}} alignment of SR 93 between SR 71 and US 89 did not exist and was still in survey planning.

40|$|Abstract — The paper {{describes}} a relational abstraction of neighborhood cooperation for Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) where node can identify its neighbors around it. Since radio links have limited range only some nodes {{have a direct}} contact with the Base Station (BS) and data transmission is executed using multi-hop communication to ensure that information is send from one node to another towards the BS. The novel abstract uses a subordination relation, to manage the neighbor cooperation between WSN nodes, that exploits topological properties of the WSN. Based on the hop-distance from the BS, any node k is able to establish a set N<(k) consisting of nodes to which k has to send communication messages {{in order to maintain the}} data-flow direction towards the BS.

500|$|M-46 was {{designated}} by July 1, 1919 on a discontinuous route that ran between Howard City and Saginaw and between rural Tuscola County and Port Sanilac. The highway followed a different routing in place {{than it does}} today. The western terminus was in downtown Howard City, rather than north of town. The road ran farther south in Gratiot [...] County so that it went into downtown Alma. By the end of 1927, the Michigan State Highway Department (MSHD) filled in the gap between Saginaw and Tuscola County, and the department extended the western end to Muskegon. M-46 followed the contemporary US131 between Cedar Springs and Howard City and the modern routing west to Muskegon ending at US31 downtown. In {{the middle of the}} 1930s, the section north of Howard City was straightened, removing the angled route between Amble and Howard City in favor of a more direct connection to US 131. The US131 and M-37 concurrencies were removed, however, when the section between Kent City and Cedar Springs was removed from the highway system. That gap was eliminated in late 1936 when M-46 was routed down US131 to Howard City and along M-82 to Newaygo. From there, it followed M-37 south to Casnovia. A new road was opened in early 1937 between Vestaburg and Alma, which {{was designated}} as part of M-46 {{by the end of the}} year. The western terminus was extended farther west through Muskegon to the outlet of Muskegon Lake on Lake Michigan as well.

40|$|AbstractIn {{this paper}} we study topological {{properties}} of multistage interconnection networks. We define the interconnection scheme between two stages {{as a pair}} of functions (f, g) which associate with a cell or node x, labelled as a binary string, his two sons f(x) and g(x). We consider a class of connections called independent connections. Using our graph characterization of networks topologically equivalent to the Baseline network, we show that all the Banyan networks built with independent connections are isomorphic. Finally, we show that if the interconnection scheme is defined by using permutations on the links induced by a permutation of the index digit (PIPID permutation) then the connection is independent. As these PIPID are associated with a very simple bit <b>directed</b> <b>routing,</b> they are used to define most of the networks introduced in the literature.

In addition, our scheme guarantees that at most two packets arrive at the same node in the same time step. Furthermore, if the length of the route of a given packet is d and the maximum number of other routes intersecting the route in a single node is k then the packet arrives to its destination within d + k steps...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — Interference among {{concurrent}} transmissions complicates QoS provisioning for multimedia {{applications in}} wireless mesh networks. In this {{paper we propose}} MARIA (Mesh Admission control and qos Routing with Interference Awareness), a scheme towards enhancing QoS support for multimedia in wireless mesh networks. We characterize interference in wireless networks using a conflict graph based model. Nodes exchange their flow information periodically and compute their available residual bandwidth based on the local maximal clique constraints. Admission decision is made based on the residual bandwidth at each node. We implement an on-demand routing scheme that explicitly incorporates the interference model in the route discovery process. It <b>directs</b> <b>routing</b> message propagations and avoids “hot-spots ” with severe interference. Simulation results demonstrate that by taking interference into account MARIA outperforms the conventional approach. It finds routes with less interference and enhances the performance significantly.

40|$|We propose new {{building}} blocks for connectionless intra-domain and inter-domain traffic engineering (TE) in the Internet.

This paper overviews the building blocks and focuses on the inter-domain case, where we consider the problems of a) explicit border router choice and b) an explicit AS path choice. The latter problem in general requires a tradeoff in terms of increased inter-AS control traffic, whereas the for-mer problem can be solved within an AS with par-tial upgrades. Such explicit routing {{has the potential to}} allow a more direct, finer-grained policy control of how traffic is mapped to routes.
