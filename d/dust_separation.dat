40|$|The off-gas {{from the}} {{incineration}} of waste and fossil fuels contains numerous gaseous and solid pollutants which must be removed {{as far as possible}} from this off-gas by off-gas cleaning. This investigation involved experiments in which very fine dust particles (aerosols) in the particle size range from 0. 05 to 6 μm were separated from the gas in a spray washer. The objective was to examine the extent to which <b>dust</b> <b>separation</b> can be improved or simplified by combining it iwith the condensation of the water vapour present in the exhaust gas. A laboratory facility was constructed for these investigations providing the possibility of comparing various process technologies during condensation in front of and in a wet scrubber while varying the gas parameters of dust content, particle size distribution and water vapour content. The results of the measurements show that not the water content or the condensed water quantity alone is of significance for improving the <b>dust</b> <b>separation</b> by condensation of water vapour. On the contrary, the essential prerequisite is a proper procedure for initiating condensation and the creation of thermodynamic conditions under which a condensation on the aerosols is possible.

40|$|Aerodynamic {{flow control}} in a cyclone is {{critical}} to its performance. Dust accumulation in a multi-cyclone is undesirable. This research investigated, the effects of laser-patterned Ethylene-Propylene-Diene Monomer (EPDM) roof in a commercial multi-cyclone system on its aerodynamic and dust accumulation characteristics. Our experimental data show that strategically designed concentric micro-dimples on the cyclone roof can improve both the aerodynamic performance and <b>dust</b> <b>separation</b> capability in the multi-cyclone system.

40|$|Part of {{the task}} of {{interpreting}} IR spectral features observed by MGS/TES due to surface minerals requires distinguishing those IR signatures from atmospheric signatures of gas and <b>dust.</b> Surface-atmosphere <b>separation</b> for MGS/TES depends on knowledge of the retrieved temperature profile. In turn, the temperature retrieval Erom the observed data depends on molecular parameters including 15 micron CO 2 line shape or line intensities which contribute to defining the Mars synthetic radiative transfer model. Using a simple isothermal, homogeneous single layer model of Pinnock and Shine, we find the ratio of (the error in degrees Kelvin of the retrieved temperature profile) to (the percentage error in the absorption coefficient) (deg K/percent) to be 0. 4 at 200 K.

In this program we took advantage of both types of coronagraphs in two spectral bands, H-band for the Lyot mask and Ks-band for the phase mask. In addition, we simulated an extended object to understand the limitations in deconvolution of coronagraphic images. The reduced coronagraphic images allow us to carefully measure the structures of the debris disk and reveal a number of asymmetries of which some were not reported before (position, elevation and thickness of the warp).

The difference in efficiency between individual and battery liquid separators is slight. Concentration of disperse liquid phase in refined gases is 0. 1 – 0. 3 kg/kg.

40|$|The {{increase}} {{of renewable energy}} by combustion of biofuel will likely {{lead to an increase}} in the use of biofuels with high ash content. These fuels are more demanding from a combustion perspective. To facilitate combustion of these fuels in small combustion devices (50 kW – a few MW), there is a need of inexpensive dust cleaning devices. This is urgent to facilitate increased biofuel combustion without counteraction with the Swedish environmental goal Clean Air (which contain goals for particles in the air). Electrostatic filters for dust cleaning at heat and power plants are well established. However, the cost of these filters is often expensive to bear for a small plant. A few electrostatic filters for residential applications are available, but the experience is limited. In the capacity-area in between, i. e. small district heating plants, it is of special importance to find new cheap alternatives for an improved dust cleaning. The Norwegian company Applied Plasma Physics (APP) have products for dust- and odour-cleaning. APP also has the electrostatic filter called R_ESP (Residential Electrostatic Precipitator) for combustion of wood close to commercially available. The purpose of this report is to evaluate the electrostatic filter R_ESP at combustion of biofuels rich in ash, and by this contribute to increased knowledge about electrostatic precipitation at small-scale applications. A sub-goal is to separate 85 % of the particles in the flue gas. Experimental tests were performed at SP’s Energy laboratory. R_ESP was mounted downstream of a chimney, which was mounted on a multi-stoker/boiler. The multi-stoker has a nominal heat output of 65 kW at combustion of wood pellets. In this project pellets of bark or reed canary grass were fired. <b>Dust</b> <b>separation</b> efficiency over the R_ESP with respect to number concentration and size distribution was tested for several powers of the filter, during combustion of the two fuels. Combustion of bark was selected for a longer time test with respect to separation efficiency by particle mass. Number concentration and size distribution were measured in real time using an electrical low pressure impactor (ELPI) and mass concentration was measured by filter sampling. The combustion conditions were favourable, with low concentrations of hydrocarbons and carbon monoxide. The number concentration of particles was 2. 5 · 107 #/cmN 3 and 1. 9 · #/cmN 3 (normalised to 10 % O 2) at combustion of reed canary grass and bark respectively. The results show that the technique of R_ESP works well for cleaning of particles from efficient combustion of the ash-rich fuels reed canary grass and bark. The combustion device was run at 20 kW, which is a thermal output that may be present at a farm or a school. For such an application the existing R_ESP may be tested in field, but for larger plants a certain product development is needed. The objective to separate 85 % of the particles was reached at normal operation of the filter (60 W).

The results show that superimposing wind tunnel deposition and erosion maps usually leads to correct predictions of medium-term dust accumulation.

The Lyot mask blocks a large central region around the star (radius < 0. 35 ´´) but allows deep integrations and hence good signal-to-noise ratio at large distances, while the phase mask allows imaging at very close separation (down to ~ 0. 15 ´´ in theory) but conversely is more sensitive to residual aberrations.

The DB- 1 × 007 - 210 column set did not offer any extra separation compared to one-dimensional GC. For the DB- 1 × HT- 8 column combination, the useful principle of congener separation {{on the basis of}} number of halogen substituents in a molecule was confirmed (PCBs, toxaphene) and extended (PCTs, PBDEs). No practically useful group-type separation was observed for this column combination. The DB- 1 × LC- 50 set provides group separation based on planarity: planar compounds such as PCDDs, PCDFs, PCDTs and PCNs are much more retained than, and therefore separated from, non-planar analytes. Within the classes of PCBs, PBBs and PCTs highly useful separation of planar from non-planar compounds was also observed. The DB- 1 × 007 - 65 HT column set effectively separates PCAs and PBDEs from all other compound classes, and provides a good separation of brominated and chlorinated analogue classes from each other. This column set was the most efficient one for within-class separation of OCPs and PCNs.

Their dimensions and configurations have a great influence on their performance {{and they have been}} widely studied in literature. In this research, the impacts of using a ceramic wear liner inside the wall of a special dust collector cyclone, installed in the Golgohar mining and industrial company in Iran, is investigated. In this research some numerical calculations and software analysis, based on the CFD, have been carried out and the results have been compared with the results of the practical tests and recorded data. This comparison shows the conformity {{of the results of the}} practical tests and the calculated results. In this research, the flow is a two-phase, gas-solid, type and the collision of the solid materials, which are mainly iron material with 200 ∼ 700 micron dimensions, with the cyclone wall will increase the erosion. Therefore, to reduce the erosion a special ceramic wear liner is used as a protective layer for cyclone wall. Adding this protective layer has changed the geometry of the cyclone wall from different aspects; so the impacts of this type of liner on the performance and the separation efficiency of the dust collector cyclone should be investigated. The dilute two phase flow inside a cyclone is simulated using an Euler-Lagrange hybrid method. The gas phase is governed by the Navier-Stokes equations. This investigation can be a starting point for more research that can be result in producing more appropriate and efficient cyclones.

40|$|A {{mechanistic}} {{air quality}} {{model has been}} constructed which is capable of predicting the contribution of individual emissions source types to the size- and chemical-composition distribution of airborne particles. This model incorporates {{all of the major}} aerosol processes relevant to regional air pollution studies including emissions, transport, deposition, gas-to-particle conversion and fog chemistry. In addition, the aerosol is represented as a source-oriented external mixture which is allowed to age in a more realistic fashion than can be accomplished when fresh particle-phase emissions are averaged into the pre-existing atmospheric aerosol size and composition distribution. A source-oriented external mixture is created by differentiating the primary particles emitted from the following source types: catalyst-equipped gasoline engines, non-catalyst-equipped gasoline engines, diesel engines, meat cooking, paved road dust, crustal material from sources other than paved road dust, and sulfur-bearing particles from fuel burning and industrial processes. Discrete primary seed particles from each of these source types are emitted into a simulation of atmospheric transport and chemical reaction. The individual particles evolve over time in the presence of gas-to-particle conversion processes while retaining information on the initial source from which they were emitted. The source- and age-resolved particle mechanics model is applied to the 1987 August SCAQS episode and comparisons are made between model predictions and observations at Claremont, CA. The model explains the origin of the bimodal character of the sub-micron aerosol size distribution. The mode located between 0. 2 and 0. 3 μm particle diameter is shaped by transformed emissions from diesel engines and meat cooking operations with lesser contributions from gasoline-powered vehicles and other fuel burning. The larger mode located at 0. 7 – 0. 8 μm particle diameter is due to fine particle background aerosol that has been further transformed by fog and by other gas-to-particle conversion processes. Smaller contributions to the mode located at 0. 7 – 0. 8 μm particle diameter are made by food cooking and by the fine particle fraction of paved and unpaved road <b>dust.</b> <b>Separation</b> of the contributions of particles from different sources helps to visualize the effect that different emissions control programs would have in advance of their adoption...|$|E

A comparison of our images from 1995, 1996, 1997, and 1998 shows that the separation of the two brightest components A and B increased from 193 mas in 1995 to 246 mas in 1998. The cometary shapes of component A in the H and J images and the 0. 79 micron and 1. 06 micron HST images suggest that the core of A is not the central star, but the southern (nearer) lobe of the bipolar structure. The position of the central star is probably at or near the position of component B, where the H-K color has its largest value of H-K = 4. 2. If the star is located at or near B, then the components A, C, and D are located close to the inner boundary of the <b>dust</b> shell at <b>separations</b> of 200 mas = 30 AU (projected distance) = 6 stellar radii for a distance of 150 pc, in agreement with our 2 -dimensional radiative transfer modelling. In addition to IRC+ 10216 we studied the stellar disks and the dust shells of several related objects. Angular resolutions of 24 mas at 700 nm or 57 mas at 1. 6 micron were achieved.

40|$|Waste {{incineration}} is {{an important}} part of many processes. Waste water incineration is however, not a common practice. This thesis has evaluated the performance of waste water incineration through a case study at AkzoNobel in Stenungsund. The primary aim of the process is the destruction of ammonia present in the waste water and ventilation gas feed streams. Secondary focus is to reduce the formation of NOx in the process. The waste water incineration process consists of two evaporators, one furnace, one <b>dust</b> cyclone, a <b>separation</b> step containing one quench and one separation unit, and lastly one electrostatic filter before the flue gases are emitted to the atmosphere via a flue gas fan and a stack. The evaluation was performed in three parts. The first part included mapping mass balances of the incinerator and the important units. The balances were based on real time data from the process. In the second part a chemical reaction modelling software was used to make a sensitivity analysis for the operating parameters with respect to the NOx formation. The third part consisted of experimental tests varying a set of parameters that were run over a period of around six days. The result of the mapping shows that the mass balance may be completed. The modeling results indicates that the most important parameters are temperature, amount of excess air and amount of water fed to the furnace. The Experimental test results are consistent with both literature and modeling outcome. The conclusion from this thesis work is that high temperature and high oxygen levels yields a low ammonia slip but increase the amount of NO formed. On the other hand, low temperatures and low oxygen levels gives low levels of NO but increase the amount of un-reacted ammonia in the stack. The flow of direct water also has a large effect on the performance of the furnace. The most important uncertainties are the ventilation gas composition and the amount of ammonia washed away in the quench step...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe plastic {{production}} has increased rapidly from 1. 7 to 288 million tons annually {{within the last}} 60 years (PlasticsEurope 2013). In the early 70 ’s, the presence of millimetric plastic debris in marine environment has been highlighted and more recently the term microplastics was used to describe millimetric and inframillimetric particles. Since 2008, plastic particles smaller than 5 mm have been defined as microplastics (Barnes et al. 2009). These microplastics cover a large and continuous spectrum of sizes and shapes including 1 D-fibers (with one larger dimension), 2 D-fragments (flat particles), and 3 D-spherules. While numerous studies were published on microplastic in marine environment, only few are dealing with these pollutants in continental environments. Moreover most of these studies are dealing with lakes and rivers, but none focused on the contamination of atmospheric compartment by microplastics. In addition to experimentations on total atmospheric fallout (Dris et al. 2015 a), this study aims at investigating the contamination of indoor and outdoor air by microplastics. Indoor air concentrations of microplastics (number of particles/m 3) were measured in 2 private apartments and 1 office at the Paris-Est University. Volumes about 5 m 3 over a 24 h-period were pumped using a Deltanova pump (8 L/min) on glass fiber GF/A Whatman® filters (1. 6 µm). In addition, household dust was also sampled using conventional vacuum cleaner and collected in the vacuum cleaner bag. Outdoor air samples were collected on the University roof located in an urbanized area (about 10 km from Paris center) and about 10 m 3 were pumped over a same period. In both cases, the total dust sampling modes were considered. Filters were then observed with a stereomicroscope Leica MZ 12 coupled with a software for image analyzing to account microplastics. For methodological reasons, the minimal microplastic particle size considered {{in this study is}} about 50 µm. For <b>dust,</b> a densimetric <b>separation</b> coupled with an enzymatic digestion was performed. Microplastics observed in indoor and outdoor air are exclusively fibrous with a size distribution. Fibers are mainly sub-millimetric (50 - 80 % between 100 and 500 µm) {{and to a lesser extent}} millimetric (10 - 30 % between 500 and 1 000 µm or between 1 000 and 5 000 µm). First campaigns indicate that indoor concentrations are in the 3 - 15 particles/m 3 range. A gradient of indoor concentrations according to the sampling height (30, 125 and 250 cm) was also observed suggesting that the microplastics are mainly re suspended from the floor probably due to human activity and movement. Finally, a significant amount of fibers is observed in dust. Outdoor concentrations are lower than those observed for indoor and are in the 0. 2 - 0. 8 particles/m 3 range. Due to their size, a high deposition velocity of microplastics may be expected and could explain the low concentrations observed. Parallel to that, a significant amount of particles is also observed in total atmospheric fallout (29 - 280 particles/m 2 /d), confirming the contamination of atmospheric compartment by microplastics. The time-variation of this flux seems to be strongly influenced by rain events suggesting that the microplastic wash out could be a major route of deposition. The chemical identification of the microplastics is in progress using Raman micro spectroscopy...|$|R
40|$|Paper {{presented}} to the 10 th International Conference on Heat Transfer, Fluid Mechanics and Thermodynamics, Florida, 14 - 16 July 2014. Laminar electrically conducting fluid flow in various conduits under different magnetic fields has received great attention in recent years due to its various applications for biomedical (i. e. : blood filtration in artificial kidney), thermal (i. e. : cooling of turbine blades), chemical (i. e. : food processing), environmental (i. e. : <b>dust</b> <b>separation)</b> and nuclear (i. e. : ionization control) purposes. Present paper studies flow characteristics of electrically conducting fluid under uniform magnetic field in the small gap between uniformly moving lower plate and a fixed parallel semi porous plate that governed by dimensionless Hartman number (Ha), and Reynolds number (Re). The weighted residual Least Squares Method (L. S. M.) is used to solve the two dimensional governing simulation equations. In the range Re < 1. 0 and Ha < 1. 0, neither Ha nor Re has noticeable effect on vertical flow velocity V. The rate of V is linear within the gap and vanishes {{in the vicinity of}} both plates. Fluid flow rate q leaving out through the semi porous upper plate shows significant dependency on both Ha and Re, where it decreases with increasing either Ha or Re due to the dependency of the horizontal velocity U on both Ha, and Re. In the ranges 1. 0 < Re, Ha < 10 both Ha and Re also still have minor effects on V. At higher Re the results show higher shear stress and lower U values in vicinity of lower plate, signifying a reluctant fluid flow that does not follow the speeding up of the moving lower plate. At Ha = 10, the effect of Re on U diminishes to its lowest limit, and the flow suffers an almost oscillating nature in the upper 75 % of the gap between the plates, and a very high shear stress is in the lower 25 % of the gap. Present results agree well with other published results that had used Galerkin method, numerical methods and Homotopy analysis method. cf 201...|$|E
40|$|Operation of biofilters for piggery {{and poultry}} shed odour control in Korea, {{and in other}} parts of the world, has often been {{problematic}} for two reasons. Firstly, excessive dust in the incoming air can cause clogging of the organic biofilter material. Secondly, drying out of the organic biofilter can occur if the relative humidity of the incoming air is not close to 100 %. Dust is generated in sheds from the feed and bedding materials, and also dried out manure residue which is disturbed by animal movements. This is worse in hot dry summer conditions but may also be exacerbated in cold winter conditions where shed heating is used. Dust loadings from sheds are typically 1 mg/m 3 but may exceed 10 mg/m 3. Dust particles may vary in size from less than 1 µm to more than 100 µm, with typically half the volume of the dust is less than 10 µm in size. For bacteria on the biofilm to be healthy and actively reduced odour, the humidity of air spaces inside an organic biofilter material should be as close to 100 % as possible. This is achieved if the overall water content of the organic biofilter material is maintained at approximately 25 % w/w. If the air entering an organic biofilter has lower than 100 % humidity, the effect will be to dry out the organic biofilter material and the biofilm. The drier this air is, the more water is required to be sprayed onto the material and this may lead to poor organic biofilter performance. The combined effects of dust and water together often leads to clogging causing inhomogeneous flow, preferential flow channelling, poor utilisation of all of the organic biofilter medium and reductions in odour removal efficiency. This can result in a significant decrease in the effective life of the organic biofilter medium. Replacement is expensive and inconvenient to do on a regular basis. Recommended methods for air preconditioning are therefore :- 1) 	Cyclone <b>Dust</b> <b>Separation</b> (CDS) for coarse (> 10 µm) dust removal 2) 	Trickling Biofiltration (TBF) for fine (< 10 µm) dust removal, odour pre-treatment and humidification It may be necessary to use multiple cyclones with a small diameter to remove fine particles (less than 10 µm). Multiclones can be manufactured at relatively low cost and there are no moving parts so maintenance costs are minimal. Typical dust loadings are unlikely due cause clogging of the multiclone. Multiclones are therefore appropriate technology for intensive livestock industries. Trickling biofilters are also easy and cheap to construct, the only component of significant cost being the flow controller units. As the trickling biofilter material is inorganic, water flushing can be relatively heavy and continuous to flushout and remove dust build-up. This should lead to an essentially maintenance free dust elimination process. Relative humidity of the organic biofilter incoming air should also be close to 100 %...|$|E
