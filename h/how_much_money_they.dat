The village mayor is unwilling to give her money for a bus ticket to the city, so she resolves to earn the money herself, and recruits the remaining students to help. One girl suggests that they can make money by moving bricks in a nearby brickyard, and Wei begins giving the students mathematical exercises centered on finding out <b>how</b> <b>much</b> <b>money</b> <b>they</b> need to earn for the bus tickets, how many bricks they need to move, and how much time it will take. Through these exercises and working to earn money, her rapport with the class improves. After earning the money, she reaches the bus station but learns that the price is higher than she thought, and she cannot afford a ticket. Wei ends up walking most of the way to Zhangjiakou.|$|E

25|$|The main mode for Rock Band 4 is a Band Tour career mode which IGN {{described}} as a role-playing game. Within the narrative of the Band Tour, the players' band starts off as a small town group {{with a handful of}} fans. En route to becoming more popular and successful, the players are tasked with the option of what types of gigs they want their band to play, with various risks and rewards that influence: how many fans the group attains per geographic region; what future gigs they will have available; and <b>how</b> <b>much</b> in-game <b>money</b> <b>they</b> earn (which can be spent customizing their band's clothes and instruments). While {{there are a number of}} possible sets that the band can select from with more unlocked as the players progresses in the game, the primary means of advancing the band's narrative is through multi-part Tours which consist of 3 to 6 different shows to be played in order. At the start of each of these Tours, the players will have two options that will affect what type of song sets they will see on the tour and the benefits of completing each set and the overall Tour. For example, players are able to have their band take a corporate-sponsored gig, which will earn the band a large amount of in-game money, but may impact their band's reputation and limit future venues, while taking on smaller shows will not produce as <b>much</b> <b>money,</b> but increase the band's renown and open more possible gigs. Subsequent Tours may require the players to earn more stars from other, single Sets that are available, before that tour is available.|$|R

Since 2017 - 04 - 25 the original version EN 50128 : 2001 has been replaced by the updated new version EN 50128 : 2011.

The work for this study includes literature study, document research and interview with the relevant supplies and experts. Qualitative and quantitative methods have been used in the study to reach the possible best results. The effects due to the EN 50128 update have been extensively investigated. The following issues have been addressed: - How can the update of the standard EN 50128 be done smoothly by the companies? - <b>How</b> <b>much</b> <b>money</b> have <b>they</b> spent to update their process to follow the 2011 version? - What parts of the process have been the most extensive and expensive to change due to the standard update? The results of the work are useful for an organized and professional assessor to help and support the companies dealing with this complex software, in order for them to be prepared for the upcoming standard update as well as possible. If the affected companies have been proactive in their own development of their methods/techniques, the 2011 version of the standard will not be a major work to follow for their process.

40|$|Opposing {{candidates}} {{for a political}} office often differ in their professional backgrounds and pre-vious political experience, leading to both real and perceived differences in political capabilities. We analyze a formal model in which candidates with different productivities in two policy areas compete for voters by choosing <b>how</b> <b>much</b> <b>money</b> or effort <b>they</b> would allocate to each area if elected. The model has a unique equilibrium that differs substantially from the standard median voter model. Although candidates compete {{for the support of}} a moderate voter type, this cutoff voter differs from the expected median voter. Moreover, no voter type except the cutoff voter is indifferent between the candidates in equilibrium. The model also predicts that candidates respond to changes in the preferences of voters in a very rigid way. From a welfare perspective, candidates are “excessively moderate”: almost certainly, a majority of voters would prefer that the winning candidate focus more on his or her strength. In his seminal work “An Economic Theory ofDemocracy, ” Anthony Downs (1957) develops amodel of two-party electoral competition. In this framework, candidates propose identical, or at least similar, policies because they have to attract the sup-port of the median voter to win, and voters do not perceive significant differences among candidates as the electoral campaign gravitates toward the median voter...|$|R

My case for this thesis is the brand Intersport and I am investigating the phenomena sponsorship and their different sponsorship relations {{and in this case}} in relation to sport events. A qualitative study has been conducted by doing interviews with representatives from three different events that Intersport are sponsoring, two interviews with Intersport and also observations during two of the events. Furthermore, a theoretical framework within sponsorship has developed through this process. The result of this study showed that there are different kinds of sponsorship relations between Intersport and their sponsored events. Moreover, there are differences in terms of how they are ranking sports and <b>how</b> <b>much</b> <b>money</b> and time <b>they</b> are investing in the specific events. This study showed that Intersport has different levels of professionalism and business relationships. Partille Cup has the highest position on that scale, Stockholm Marathon Group has the second place and Gothenburg Youth Games is in the bottom. The interviews resulted in a clear picture of how these sponsorship relations look like, the underlying reasons for cooperating with Intersport and this means that they are seeing the sports retailer as a large player, a good channel in terms of being connected to them and increase their awareness but also as a partner who can offer relevant products for their events. Lastly, meaningful relations is a key factor here and my result showed that it goes both ways...|$|R

Gamblers in Australia spend (lose) over 18 billion per year including nearly 12 billion on poker machines. The Commission estimates that problem gamblers account for around 15 per cent of regular gaming machine players, with a further 15 per cent facing moderate risks. The Commission also found problem gamblers 2 ̆ 7 share of total spending on pokies ranged around 40 per cent. The Commission has drawn from experiences in Australia and overseas to craft proposals that help reduce the social costs of gambling without unduly impacting on its recreational value. Key proposals are directed at: •    reducing the amounts that people can lose (currently up to 1200 per hour) through lower limits on bets per button push and on <b>how</b> <b>much</b> <b>money</b> can be fed into machines •    giving people the choice to set limits on <b>how</b> <b>much</b> time and <b>money</b> <b>they</b> spend on gambling, through a universal 2 ̆ 7 pre commitment 2 ̆ 7 system harnessed to improved technologies. Other harm minimisation proposals include limiting access to cash in venues, longer and earlier shutdowns of gaming rooms (drawing from the Queensland approach), and better warnings (based on Victoria 2 ̆ 7 s model). The Commission has also proposed an overhaul of wagering regulations that will promote competition and lower prices for punters, while sustaining the racing industry. The report finds that Australia 2 ̆ 7 s ban on online gaming is not working, with Australians increasingly gambling abroad on sites with minimal consumer protection. The Commission proposes 2 ̆ 7 managed liberalisation 2 ̆ 7, with supply being made legal in Australia, but only if stringent harm minimisation {{measures are}} introduced.

McLain's descent into his gambling obsession was further precipitated by an offhand remark made during an interview: that he drank about a case of Pepsi a day.
