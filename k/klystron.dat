5|$|Oliphant's {{group at}} Birmingham worked on {{developing}} two promising devices, the <b>klystron</b> and the magnetron. Working with James Sayers, Oliphant managed {{to produce an}} improved version of the <b>klystron</b> capable of generating 400W. Meanwhile, two more members of his Birmingham team, John Randall and Harry Boot, worked on a radical new design, a cavity magnetron. By February 1940, they had an output of 400W with a wavelength of , {{just the kind of}} short wavelengths needed for good airborne radars. The magnetron's power was soon increased a hundred-fold, and Birmingham concentrated on magnetron development. The first operational magnetrons were delivered in August 1941. This invention was one of the key scientific breakthroughs during the war and played a major part in defeating the German U-boats, intercepting enemy bombers, and in directing Allied bombers.|$|E
5|$|Other {{researchers}} also investigated electromagnetic isotope separation. At Princeton University, a {{group led by}} Henry D. Smyth and Robert R. Wilson developed a device known as an isotron. Using a <b>klystron,</b> {{they were able to}} separate isotopes using high-voltage electricity rather than magnetism. Work continued until February 1943, when, in view of the greater success of the calutron, work was discontinued and the team was transferred to other duties. At Cornell University a group under Lloyd P. Smith that included William E. Parkins, and A. Theodore Forrester devised a radial magnetic separator. They were surprised that their beams were more precise than expected, and, like Lawrence, deduced that it was a result of stabilization of the beam by air in the vacuum chamber. In February 1942, their team was consolidated with Lawrence's in Berkeley.|$|E
25|$|There {{are often}} several regions of {{reflector}} voltage where the reflex <b>klystron</b> will oscillate; these {{are referred to}} as modes. The electronic tuning range of the reflex <b>klystron</b> is usually referred to as the variation in frequency between half power pointsthe points in the oscillating mode where the power output is half the maximum output in the mode.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Klystrons</b> {{can produce}} far higher {{microwave}} power outputs than solid state microwave {{devices such as}} Gunn diodes. [...] In modern systems, they are used from UHF (hundreds of megahertz) up to hundreds of gigahertz (as in the Extended Interaction <b>Klystrons</b> in the CloudSat satellite). <b>Klystrons</b> {{can be found at}} work in radar, satellite and wideband high-power communication (very common in television broadcasting and EHF satellite terminals), medicine (radiation oncology), and high-energy physics (particle accelerators and experimental reactors). At SLAC, for example, <b>klystrons</b> are routinely employed which have outputs in the range of 50MW (pulse) and 50kW (time-averaged) at 2856MHz. The Arecibo Planetary Radar uses two <b>klystrons</b> that provide a total power output of 1MW (continuous) at 2380MHz.|$|R
25|$|<b>Klystrons</b> and {{magnetrons}} often operate their anodes (called collectors in <b>klystrons)</b> {{at ground}} potential to facilitate cooling, particularly with water, without high-voltage insulation. These tubes instead operate with high negative voltages on the filament and cathode.|$|R
40|$|The SLAC {{design for}} a 1 -TeV {{collider}} (NLC) requires <b>klystrons</b> with a performance which is well beyond the state-of-the-art for microwave tubes in the United States or abroad. The electrical specifications for the NLC <b>klystrons</b> are not fully established, but they are approximately as follows: Frequency, 11. 4 GHz; Peak Power, 75 MW; Pulse Length, 1. 5 {mu}s; Repetition Rate, 180 Hz; Gain, 50 dB; Efficiency, (including beam focusing) 50 %. SLAC is in the seventh year of a program to develop these <b>klystrons.</b> The choice of X-band as the operating frequency, along with {{the sheer size of}} the NLC, have resulted in some new, most demanding standards for the <b>klystrons</b> which may power this future machine. These are related to the overall efficiency required, to the high rf gradients that must be supported at the output circuit without vacuum breakdown, and to the manufacturing cost of the 5, 000 - 10, 000 <b>klystrons</b> needed for the collider...|$|R
25|$|Modern {{semiconductor}} technology has effectively replaced the reflex <b>klystron</b> in most applications.|$|E
25|$|The {{floating}} {{drift tube}} <b>klystron</b> {{has a single}} cylindrical chamber containing an electrically isolated central tube. Electrically, {{this is similar to}} the two cavity oscillator <b>klystron</b> with a lot of feedback between the two cavities. Electrons exiting the source cavity are velocity modulated by the electric field as they travel through the drift tube and emerge at the destination chamber in bunches, delivering power to the oscillation in the cavity. This type of oscillator <b>klystron</b> has an advantage over the two-cavity <b>klystron</b> on which it is based, in that it needs only one tuning element to effect changes in frequency. The drift tube is electrically insulated from the cavity walls, and DC bias is applied separately. The DC bias on the drift tube may be adjusted to alter the transit time through it, thus allowing some electronic tuning of the oscillating frequency. The amount of tuning in this manner is not large and is normally used for frequency modulation when transmitting.|$|E
25|$|During the Second World War, the Axis powers relied {{mostly on}} (then low-powered and long wavelength) <b>klystron</b> {{technology}} for their radar system microwave generation, while the Allies used {{the far more}} powerful but frequency-drifting technology of the cavity magnetron for much shorter-wavelength one centimeter microwave generation. <b>Klystron</b> tube technologies for very high-power applications, such as synchrotrons and radar systems, have since been developed.|$|E
40|$|Summary. A digital {{computer}} system is being in-$ stalled in the SLAC accelerator control buildina. Initially, the computer will recognize losses of <b>klystrons</b> due to malfunction, and will switch on suitable replacements. Later, it will prepare and analyze-records, assist {{in setting up}} new e. xperiments, and perform certain other control operations where rapid response is desirable. seconds, it is planned to use the computer to select properly programmed standby <b>klystrons</b> and to switch them to the “accelerate ” state. The hasdware {{to do this is}} already working; it remains to settle the program details. These are complicated by such problems as multiple beams, what to do about repeatedly misbehaving <b>klystrons,</b> and coupler asymetry, which causes certain <b>klystrons</b> to deflect the beam...|$|R
25|$|<b>Klystrons</b> are {{specialized}} linear-beam vacuum-devices, {{designed to}} provide high power, widely tunable amplification of millimetre and sub-millimetre waves. <b>Klystrons</b> are designed for large scale operations and despite having a narrower bandwidth than TWTAs, they {{have the advantage of}} coherently amplifying a reference signal so its output may be precisely controlled in amplitude, frequency and phase.|$|R
40|$|The Spallation Neutron Source (SNS) {{being built}} at Oak Ridge National Lab (ORNL) in Tennessee {{requires}} a linac with an output energy of 1 GeV {{and an average}} current during the pulse of approximately 18 mA (including the effects of chopping). The average beam power for the initial baseline is 1 MW (1 mA average at 1 GeV). The linac is followed by an accumulator ring and target/instrument facility [1]. The RF system for the 1 MW linac requires 52 each 805 MHz <b>klystrons</b> and 3 each 402. 5 MHz <b>klystrons.</b> The 805 MHz <b>klystrons</b> are configured in pairs to drive one resonant structure. This uses the installed RF very efficiently and in addition is convenient for the upgrade to 4 MW which {{must be considered in}} the design. The RF must have the correct amplitude and phase in order to ensure complete acceleration along the linac and to minimize beam loss. Due to the configuration proposed for SNS, the LLRF controls must equalize each pair of <b>klystrons</b> to ensure proper operation. The high voltage system for the <b>klystrons</b> will be based on Insulated Gate Bipolar Transistor (IGBT) technology to provide the best possible operation at the least cost...|$|R

25|$|The Birmingham {{group was}} led by Mark Oliphant, {{formerly}} of the Cavendish Laboratory at Cambridge University but recently moved to Birmingham {{to set up the}} Nuffield Laboratory. The team decided to base their development efforts on the <b>klystron</b> concept. The <b>klystron</b> had been introduced by the Varian brothers at Stanford University in 1936, but produced a relatively low power output.

25|$|A reflex <b>klystron</b> is an {{obsolete}} type {{in which}} the electron beam was reflected back along its path by a high potential electrode, used as an oscillator.|$|E
25|$|Since then, many {{millions}} of cavity magnetrons have been manufactured; while some have been for radar the vast majority have been for microwave ovens. The use in radar itself has dwindled to some extent, as more accurate signals have generally been needed and developers have moved to <b>klystron</b> and traveling-wave tube systems for these needs.|$|E
25|$|Some tubes, such as magnetrons, traveling-wave tubes, carcinotrons, and klystrons, combine {{magnetic}} and electrostatic effects. These are efficient (usually narrow-band) RF {{generators and}} still find use in radar, microwave ovens and industrial heating. Traveling-wave tubes (TWTs) {{are very good}} amplifiers and are even used in some communications satellites.

25|$|The {{solution}} {{was provided by}} well-known tube expert Robert W. Sutton at the Admiralty Signals Establishment. He designed a new tube for this purpose, today known as the Sutton tube but then more widely known as a reflex <b>klystron.</b> This was essentially a conventional two-cavity <b>klystron</b> with one cavity removed. The remaining cavity was fed a tiny amount of the output from the magnetron, causing the electrons passing by it {{to take up the}} pattern of the radio signal (this is the basis of all klystrons). Normally this would then pass the second resonator where the output would be tapped, but in the Sutton tube, the electrons instead approached a high-voltage plate that reflected them back towards their source. By carefully controlling the voltage of the reflector, the electrons would arrive having gained or lost a controlled amount of velocity, thus inducing a different frequency signal in the cavity as they passed it the second time. The combination of the original and new frequency produced a new signal that was sent to the conventional receiver. Sutton delivered an example producing 300mW in October 1940.|$|E
25|$|The {{sizes of}} the {{cavities}} determine the resonant frequency, {{and thereby the}} frequency of the emitted microwaves. However, the frequency is not precisely controllable. The operating frequency varies with changes in load impedance, with changes in the supply current, and with the temperature of the tube. This is not a problem in uses such as heating, or in some forms of radar where the receiver can be synchronized with an imprecise magnetron frequency. Where precise frequencies are needed, other devices, such as the <b>klystron</b> are used.|$|E
