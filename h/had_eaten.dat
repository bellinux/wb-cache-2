5|$|At the Dutch Grand Prix, Rindt {{eventually}} {{used the}} new Lotus 72, better sorted after alterations had been made. He set pole {{position in the}} final practice session, {{almost a quarter of}} a second ahead of his closest challenger, Stewart. Rindt went on to take his maiden victory in the Lotus 72, {{but it was not a}} joyful occasion for him; on lap 23, his close friend Piers Courage, with whom he <b>had</b> <b>eaten</b> dinner just the night before, died in a fiery crash. Rindt was heavily shaken by the loss of yet another fellow driver and contemplated retirement.|$|E
5|$|At {{the start}} of 1894, Robey {{travelled}} to Manchester {{to participate in the}} pantomime Jack and Jill, where he was paid £25 a week for a three-month contract. He did not appear in Jack and Jill until the third act but pleased the holiday crowds nonetheless. During one performance the scenery mechanism failed, which forced him to improvise for the first time. Robey fabricated a story that he had just dined with the Lord Mayor before detailing exactly what he <b>had</b> <b>eaten.</b> The routine was such a hit that it was incorporated into the show as part of the script.|$|E
5|$|Foster and Eddy {{finally arrived}} at Truckee Lake on March 14, {{where they found}} their {{children}} dead. Keseberg told Eddy that he <b>had</b> <b>eaten</b> the remains of Eddy's son, and Eddy swore to murder Keseberg if they ever met in California. George Donner and one of Jacob Donner's children were still alive at Alder Creek. Tamsen Donner had just arrived at the Murphy cabin, and she could have walked out alone but chose {{to return to her}} husband, even though she was informed that no other relief party was likely to be coming soon. Foster and Eddy {{and the rest of the}} third relief left with four children, Trudeau, and Clark.|$|E

5|$|It was {{observed}} that immediately after going to bed, generally at about 8:00pm, Domery {{would begin to}} sweat profusely. After one to two hours lying awake and perspiring, he would fall asleep before waking at around 1:00am extremely hungry, regardless of what he <b>had</b> <b>eaten</b> before going to bed. At this time, he would eat any available food, or if no food was available would smoke tobacco. At around 2:00am he {{would go back to}} sleep, and wake again at between 5:00 and 6:00am, sweating heavily; {{as soon as he got}} out of bed, the sweating would cease, starting again whenever he ate.|$|E
5|$|The Battle of Wisconsin Heights {{had been}} {{a victory for the}} militia; no regular {{soldiers}} of the U.S. Army had been present. Atkinson and the regulars joined up with the volunteers several days after the battle. With a force of about 400 regulars and 900 militiamen, the Americans crossed the Wisconsin River on July 27 and resumed the pursuit of the British Band. The British Band was moving slow, encumbered with wounded warriors and people dying of starvation. The Americans followed the trail of dead bodies, cast off equipment, and the remains of horses the hungry Natives <b>had</b> <b>eaten.</b>|$|E
5|$|Around 729/28 BC, {{soon after}} his accession, Osorkon IV faced the crusade led by the Kushite pharaoh Piye of the Nubian 25th Dynasty. Along with other rulers of Lower and Middle Egypt – mainly Nimlot of Hermopolis, Iuput II of Leontopolis and Peftjauawybast of Herakleopolis – Osorkon IV joined the {{coalition}} led by the Chief of the West Tefnakht in order to oppose the Nubian. However, Piye's advance was unstoppable and the opposing rulers surrendered one after another: Osorkon IV found it wise to reach the Temple of Ra at Heliopolis and pay homage to his new overlord Piye personally— an action which was soon imitated by the other rulers. As reported on his Victory Stela, Piye accepted their submission, but Osorkon {{and most of the}} rulers were not allowed to enter the royal enclosure because they were not circumcised and <b>had</b> <b>eaten</b> fish, both abominations {{in the eyes of the}} Nubian. Nevertheless, Osorkon IV and the others were allowed to keep their former domains and authority.|$|E

5|$|By 1980 the bridge's {{structure}} {{had come}} under attack from marine woodworm, which threatened its closure. British Rail discovered that woodworm <b>had</b> <b>eaten</b> into 69 of the supporting pillars and estimated it would cost £2.5 million to repair. Locomotive-hauled trains were banned, which immediately resulted {{in the loss of}} traffic from Tywyn, including explosives traffic to and from the factory at Penrhyndeudraeth. That traffic was re-routed via Maentwrog Road railway station and the Conwy Valley Line. However, Gwynedd County Council were opposed to closing the bridge completely as 40% of all railway traffic in the area was tourist related. The government applied for a £2.5 million grant from the EEC to repair the bridge, with a further £4.6m being spent on improving the signalling. The bridge was closed entirely to traffic for six months during the temporary repair works eventually undertaken, and 30 of the piles were replaced.|$|E
5|$|Vainio's {{childhood}} {{heart problems}} surfaced again in 1990 {{with his sister}} Marja recalling that he often placed {{his hand over his}} heart. He had even finished writing his will. At one time Vainio was travelling to Florida with his friend, composer Veikko Samuli. Vainio {{had to go to the}} bathroom during the flight, and soon there was a call for a doctor from the flight crew. Vainio had kept his heart medicines in his pocket, where the box had opened and mixed with his pastilles. Vainio <b>had</b> <b>eaten</b> too much of the medicine by accident, and his heartbeat started to slow down. Once a stewardess found out what had happened, she saved Vainio's life by quickly forcing him to vomit.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Reed {{caught up}} with the Donners and went on ahead with one of his teamsters, Walter Herron. The two shared a horse, {{and they were able to}} cover 25–40 miles (40–64km) per day. The rest of the party rejoined the Donners, but their bad luck continued. Native Americans chased away all of Graves' horses, and another wagon was left behind. With grass in short supply, the cattle spread out more, which allowed the Paiutes to steal 18 more during one evening; and several mornings later, the Paiutes shot another 21. So far, the company had lost nearly 100 oxen and cattle, and their rations were almost {{completely}} depleted. One more stretch of desert lay ahead. The Eddys' oxen had been killed by Native Americans and they were forced to abandon their wagon. The family <b>had</b> <b>eaten</b> all their stores, but the other families refused to assist their children. The Eddys were forced to walk, carrying their children and miserable with thirst. Margret Reed and her children were also now without a wagon. But the desert soon came to an end, and the party found the Truckee River in beautiful lush country.|$|E

5|$|Between 1692 and 1806, {{only four}} {{descriptions}} of frozen mammoths {{were published in}} Europe. None of the remains of those five were preserved, and no complete skeleton was recovered during that time. While frozen woolly mammoth carcasses had been excavated by Europeans as early as 1728, the first fully documented specimen was discovered near the delta of the Lena River in 1799 by Ossip Schumachov, a Siberian hunter. Schumachov let it thaw until he could retrieve the tusks for sale to the ivory trade. While in Yakutsk in 1806, Michael Friedrich Adams heard about the frozen mammoth. Upon arrival at the location, Adams discovered that wild animals <b>had</b> <b>eaten</b> most of the organs and flesh of the mammoth, including the trunk. He examined the carcass and realised what was left would still be the most complete mammoth recovered by that time. Adams recovered the entire skeleton, apart from the tusks, which Shumachov had already sold, and one foreleg, most of the skin, and nearly 18kg (40lb) of hair. During his return voyage he purchased a pair of tusks that he believed {{were the ones that}} Shumachov had sold. Adams brought it to the Zoological Museum of the Zoological Institute of the Russian Academy of Sciences, and the task of mounting the skeleton was given to Wilhelm Gottlieb Tilesius. The Kunstkamera, the museum established by Peter the Great, contained the skeleton of an Indian elephant that could be used as reference. This {{was one of the first}} attempts at reconstructing the skeleton of an extinct animal. Most of the reconstruction is correct, but Tilesius placed each tusk in the opposite socket, so that they curved outward instead of inward. The error was not corrected until 1899, and the correct placement of mammoth tusks was still a matter of debate into the twentieth century.|$|E
