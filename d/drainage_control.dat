The application {{focuses on the}} estimation {{of the effect of}} <b>controlled</b> <b>drainage</b> water management equipment on corn yields. Using field-level precision agriculture data and spatial panel techniques, the yield response equation is estimated using the spatial autoregressive error random effects model with temporal heterogeneity, incorporating spatial dependence in the error term, while controlling for the topography, weather and the <b>controlled</b> <b>drainage</b> treatment. <b>Controlling</b> for random effects allows for the disentanglement of the effects of spatial dependence from spatial heterogeneity and omitted variables, and thus, to properly investigate the yield response.

40|$|Rainfall is {{the most}} {{important}} cause of slope failure. The variation in stress state of soils due to rise of groundwater level and seepage of groundwater is critical to the deformation and failure of slopes during and after heavy rainfall. The stability of fill slope depends not only on the strength of fill material but also the drainage condition of the slope. Proper <b>drainage</b> <b>control</b> can not only limit the height of groundwater level, but also dissipate the build-up of excess pore pressure caused by shearing-induced contraction of soil. The possibility of liquefaction and flow failure of fill slope can be reduced consequently. The performance of compacted fill slope during rise of groundwater level is investigated by using a fully coupled procedure and the state-dependent dilatancy sand model. The interaction between pore water and soil skeleton including both buoyancy and seepage effects can be precisely taken into account in a fully coupled effective stress approach. The influence of the drainage condition of compacted fill on the stability of slope is examined.

40|$|The hydrologic {{and water}} quality impacts of {{subsurface}} drainage design and management practices are being investigated through field and simulation studies throughout the northern Corn-belt. Six years of data from an ongoing field study in south central Minnesota (Sands et al., 2008) were used to support a modeling effort with DRAINMOD-NII to investigate: (1) {{the performance of the}} model in a region where soils are subject to seasonal freeze-thaw and (2) the long-term hydrologic {{and water quality}} characteristics of conventional and alternative subsurface drainage practices. Post-calibration model prediction and efficiency were deemed satisfactory using standard model performance criteria. Prediction errors were primarily associated with early spring snowmelt hydrology and were attributed to the methods used for simulating snow accumulation and melting processes, in addition to potential sublimation effects on ET estimates. Long-term simulations with DRAINMOD-NII indicated that drainage design and/or management practices proposed as alternatives to conventional design may offer opportunities to reduce nitrate (NO 3) -nitrogen losses without significantly decreasing (and in some cases, increasing) crop yields for a Webster silty clay loam soil at Waseca, Minnesota.
