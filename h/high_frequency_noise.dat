25|$|Due to {{recording}} mastering {{and manufacturing}} limitations, both {{high and low}} frequencies {{were removed from the}} first recorded signals by various formulae. With low frequencies, the stylus must swing a long way from side to side, requiring the groove to be wide, taking up more space and limiting the playing time of the record. At high frequencies, hiss, pops, and ticks are significant. These problems can be reduced by using equalization to an agreed standard. During recording the amplitude of low frequencies is reduced, thus reducing the groove width required, and the amplitude at high frequencies is increased. The playback equipment boosts bass and cuts treble so as to restore the tonal balance in the original signal; this also reduces the <b>high</b> <b>frequency</b> <b>noise.</b> Thus more music will fit on the record, and noise is reduced.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. With the {{availability}} of various digital image edit tools, see-ing is no longer believing. In this paper, we focus on tampered region localization for image forensics. We propose an algorithm which can lo-cate tampered region(s) in a lossless compressed tampered image when its unchanged region is output of JPEG decompressor. We find the tam-pered region and the unchanged region have different responses for JPEG compression. The tampered region has stronger <b>high</b> <b>frequency</b> quanti-zation <b>noise</b> than the unchanged region. We employ PCA to separate different spatial <b>frequencies</b> quantization <b>noises,</b> i. e. low, medium and <b>high</b> <b>frequency</b> quantization <b>noise,</b> and extract <b>high</b> <b>frequency</b> quantiza-tion <b>noise</b> for tampered region localization.

40|$|We {{monitored}} the displacement and seismic activity of an unstable vertical rock slice {{in a natural}} limestone cliff of the southeast Vercors massif, southeast France, during the months preceding its collapse. Displacement measurements showed an average acceleration of the movement of its top, with clear increases in the displacement velocity and in the discrete seismic event production rate during periods where temperature falls, with more activity when rainfall or frost occurs. Crises of discrete seismic events produce high amplitudes in periodograms, but do not change the <b>high</b> <b>frequency</b> base <b>noise</b> level rate. We infer that these crises express the critical crack growth induced by water weakening (from water vapor condensation or rain) of the rock strength rather than to a rapid change in applied stresses. Seismic noise analysis showed a steady increase in the <b>high</b> <b>frequency</b> base <b>noise</b> level {{and the emergence of}} spectral modes in the signal recorded by the sensor installed on the unstable rock slice during the weeks preceding the collapse. <b>High</b> <b>frequency</b> seismic <b>noise</b> base level seems to represent subcritical crack growth.
