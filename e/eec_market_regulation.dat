40|$|The article {{presents}} {{the nature of}} protectionist and interventionist practices in the agriculture of the EEC countries. So far, those practices consist in {{the protection of the}} <b>EEC</b> <b>market</b> through market instruments (prices, subsidies, customs) and are aimed at the increase of productivity of agriculture and agricultural self-sufficiency within the EEC. However, new proposals set forth by the EEC depart from the above conception of interventionism. The remarks referring to the above issues provide the background for the analysis of the "agricultural part" of the Association Treaty made between Poland and the EEC. The author points to the discrepancy between the expected and actual access of Polish agricultural produce to the <b>EEC</b> <b>markets.</b> The article is concluded with comments focusing on Polish agricultural policy and stressing the need of systemic adaptation to the EEC standards on one hand, and the need of state interventionism with respect to the stimulation of the growth of agricultural income and the protection of agricultural produce markets on the other.

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{relationship}} linking investment (capital stock) and structural policies. Using {{a panel of}} 32 OECD countries from 1985 to 2013, we show that more stringent product and labour <b>market</b> <b>regulations</b> are associated with less investment (lower capital stock). The paper also sheds light {{on the existence of}} non-linear effects of product and labour <b>market</b> <b>regulation</b> on the capital stock. Several alternative testing methods show that the negative influence of product and labour <b>market</b> <b>regulation</b> is considerably stronger at higher levels. The paper uncovers important policy interactions between product and labour market policies. Higher levels of product <b>market</b> <b>regulations</b> (covering state control, barriers to entrepreneurship and barriers to trade and investment) tend to amplify the negative relationships between product and labour <b>market</b> <b>regulations</b> and the capital stock. Equally important is the finding that {{the rule of law and}} the quality of (legal) institutions alters the overall impact of regulations on capital deepening: better institutions reduce the negative effect of more stringent product and labour <b>market</b> <b>regulations</b> on the capital stock, possibly through the reduction of uncertainty as regards the protection of property rights...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} the {{contribution}} of the so-called “new ” economic sociology to the study of market phenomena in general and <b>market</b> <b>regulation</b> in particular. Several approaches within market sociology teach not only that, but also how economic actions in the market place are embedded in political spheres of influence, institutional arrangements, networks of social relations and cultural patterns. The specific way particular economic actions are embedded in these political, social and cultural structures dictates to a certain degree the nature, forms and results of economic actions that take place in the market place and the possibilities for and results of <b>market</b> <b>regulation.</b> Increasingly, however, <b>market</b> <b>regulation</b> takes place not within a particular state or society but on a transnational basis.

Labor market policies and labor standards do not only affects workers, but also influence firms' investment and employment decisions. The empirical analysis uses information from enterprise surveys. Empirical results describe systematic differences in the perceived level of labor <b>market</b> <b>regulation.</b> Controlling for a wide set of firm characteristics, the perceived level of labor <b>market</b> <b>regulation</b> is found to vary between firms that participate in global trade as against those supplying the domestic market.

40|$|At {{a time of}} intensifying uncertainty, {{managerial}} {{flexibility to}} adapt {{to changes in the}} economic environment is increasingly important. Different business loca-tions, it is frequently argued, offer this flexibility to differing degrees, and labour <b>market</b> <b>regulations</b> are held to be one essential factor in determining the resulting attractiveness of a country as a business location. This paper takes an options perspective in order to grasp the potential effect of labour <b>market</b> <b>regulations</b> on location decisions. The option value of an investment, it is argued, is influenced, among other factors, by labour <b>market</b> <b>regulations.</b> Depending on their prefer-ence for certain options, different investors will prefer different labour market settings. The ability of the options perspective to assess the role of labour <b>market</b> <b>regulations</b> for the attractiveness of international business locations is exempli-fied by a British-German comparison and then confronted with secondary data as well as with a unique data set derived from a survey of US multinationals in the UK and Germany. labour <b>market</b> <b>regulation,</b> location decision, option value of flexibility...|$|R

In Nigeria, however, tax (0.968) was the principal factor. This is not surprising because the poor tax administration process in Nigeria (Makinde, 2005; Otusanya, 2010; Adebisi & Gbegi, 2013) has created loopholes for SMEs to evade tax payments. As a result, entrepreneurs worry less about tax payment, {{and as a result}} plough back the income into their business.
