5|$|Damage was {{greatest}} {{in the southwest}} portion of the island, especially in the capital city, Roseau, which resembled an air raid target after the storm's passage. Strong winds from Hurricane David destroyed or damaged 80 percent of the homes (mostly wood)on the island, leaving 75 {{percent of the population}} homeless, with many others temporarily homeless in the immediate aftermath. In addition, the rainfall turned rivers into torrents, sweeping away everything <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>path</b> to the sea. Power lines were completely ripped out, causing the water system to stop as well.|$|E

5|$|Several twentieth-century writers {{explored}} {{possibilities of}} wheeled creatures. L. Frank Baum's 1907 children's novel Ozma of Oz features humanoid creatures with wheels instead of hands and feet, called Wheelers. Their wheels {{are composed of}} keratin, which has been suggested by biologists {{as a means of}} avoiding nutrient and waste transfer problems with living wheels. Despite moving quickly on open terrain, the Wheelers are stymied by obstacles <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>path</b> that do not hinder creatures with limbs, and they cannot cross sand.|$|E
5|$|The Paramhamsa monks, who are loners, are to {{be found}} in deserted houses, in temples, straw huts, on ant hills, sitting under a tree, on sand beds near rivers, in {{mountain}} caves, near waterfalls, in hollows inside trees, or in wide open fields.

5|$|At 02:00 on 13 November, two squadrons of ship's boats made amphibious landings: a small force under Lieutenant Samuel Leslie landed to {{the north}} of the emplaced positions, acting as a {{diversion}} while the main body of the expeditionary force landed to the south under Lieutenant Colonel Smith. Leslie's diversion distracted the Arab defenders, but enough remained in the southern defences to make a significant counterattack on Smith's beachhead. Cannon fire from the ship's boats covering the landing drove the Arabs back, and Smith ordered his men to advance with their bayonets fixed, pushing into the town and driving out the Arabs house by house. To cover their advance, Smith's men set fire to the buildings <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>path,</b> which created a pall of smoke under cover of which Smith was able to storm and capture the Sheik's palace.|$|E
5|$|Bolton's fifth round home tie against South Shields {{produced}} a straightforward 3–0 victory. The goals were scored by Joe Smith, Jack Smith and David Jack, the latter maintaining his record of scoring in every round. The quarter-final against Nottingham Forest required two replays {{to produce a}} winner. Following a 2–2 draw in Nottingham and a goalless game in Bolton, the Wanderers prevailed 1–0 in another close game held at Old Trafford. Bolton drew Swansea Town, the last remaining Second Division club, in the semi-final. This meant Bolton did not meet a single First Division club <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>path</b> to the final. Three early goals gave Bolton a comfortable 3–0 win at White Hart Lane.|$|E
5|$|In 1894, King Leopold II and Great Britain {{signed the}} 1894 Anglo-Congolese treaty, which {{resulted}} in the exchange of a long strip of land on {{the eastern side of the}} Congo for the Lado Enclave, leased to King Leopold II for the duration of his reign. This aided the British in pursuing the Cape to Cairo railway, as well as preventing the French from achieving an east-west line by putting the Belgians <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>path.</b> With the Lado Enclave, King Leopold gained direct access to Rejaf, the last outpost on the navigable Nile. Although the outbreak of the Mahdist War (1881–1899) had disrupted trade up and down the Nile river, Leopold hoped to gain Rejaf in preparation for its reopening once the Mahdist threat had been addressed.|$|E

40|$|We study {{bottleneck}} routing games {{where the}} social cost {{is determined by}} the worst congestion on any edge in the network. Bottleneck games have been studied in the literature by having the player's utility costs to be determined by the worst congested edge <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>paths.</b> However, the Nash equilibria of such games are inefficient since the price of anarchy can be very high with respect to the parameters of the game. In order to obtain smaller price of anarchy we explore exponential bottleneck games where the utility costs of the players are exponential functions on the congestion of the edges <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>paths.</b> We find that exponential bottleneck games are very efficient giving a poly-log bound on the price of anarchy: O(log L log |E|), where L is the largest path length in the players strategy sets and E is the set of edges in the graph.

5|$|Off {{the coast}} of Fort Lauderdale is the Osborne Reef, an {{artificial}} reef made of discarded tires that {{has proven to be}} an ecological disaster. The dumping began in the 1960s, with the intent to provide habitat for fish while disposing of trash from the land. However, in the rugged and corrosive environment of the ocean, nylon straps used to secure the tires wore out, cables rusted, and tires broke free. The tires posed a particular threat after breaking free from their restraints. The tires then migrated shoreward and ran into a living reef tract, washed up on its slope and killed many things <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>path.</b> In recent years, thousands of tires have also washed up on nearby beaches, especially during hurricanes. Local authorities are now working to remove the 700,000 tires, in cooperation with the U.S. Army, Navy and Coast Guard.|$|E
5|$|On 19 July, {{reconnaissance}} aircraft located a Turkish {{force in the}} desert moving west. The regiment and the 2nd Light Horse Brigade were ordered to establish a line of observation posts <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>path.</b> They were to send out patrols to locate them, but withdraw if attacked. If possible, they were to retire towards Romani, enticing the Turks to follow them. At dawn on 20 July the regiment located the Turks digging trenches near Ogratina. Rifle fire was exchanged and some prisoners were captured. The prisoners revealed that the force comprised twelve battalions with artillery support, planning to attack Romani.|$|E

5|$|Some teleosts are migratory; certain {{freshwater}} species move within river {{systems on}} an annual basis; other species are anadromous, spending their lives at sea and moving inland to spawn, salmon and striped bass being examples. Others, exemplified by the eel, are catadromous, doing the reverse. The fresh water European eel migrates across the Atlantic Ocean as an adult to breed in floating seaweed in the Sargasso Sea. The adults spawn here and then die, but the developing young are swept by the Gulf Stream towards Europe. By the time they arrive, they are small fish and enter estuaries and ascend rivers, overcoming obstacles <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>path</b> to reach the streams and ponds where they spend their adult lives.|$|E
5|$|Streaks {{are common}} across Mars and new ones appear {{frequently}} on steep slopes of craters, troughs, and valleys. The streaks are dark {{at first and}} get lighter with age. The streaks can start in a tiny area, then spread out for hundreds of metres. They have been seen to follow the edges of boulders and other obstacles <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>path.</b> The commonly accepted theories include that they are dark underlying layers of soil revealed after avalanches of bright dust or dust devils. Several other explanations have been put forward, including those that involve water or even the growth of organisms.|$|E

5|$|As Longstreet's left division, under Maj. Gen. Lafayette McLaws, advanced, they {{unexpectedly}} found Maj. Gen. Daniel Sickles's III Corps directly <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>path.</b> Sickles {{had been}} {{dissatisfied with the}} position assigned him on {{the southern end of}} Cemetery Ridge. Seeing ground better suited for artillery positions a half mile (800m) to the west— centered at the Sherfy farm's Peach Orchard—he violated orders and advanced his corp to the slightly higher ground along the Emmitsburg Road, moving away from Cemetery Ridge. The new line ran from Devil's Den, northwest to the Peach Orchard, then northeast along the Emmitsburg Road to south of the Codori farm. This created an untenable salient at the Peach Orchard; Brig. Gen. Andrew A. Humphreys's division (in position along the Emmitsburg Road) and Maj. Gen. David B. Birney's division (to the south) were subject to attacks from two sides and were spread out over a longer front than their small corps could defend effectively. The Confederate artillery was ordered to open fire at 3:00p.m. After failing to attend a meeting at this time of Meade's corps commanders, Meade rode to Sickles' position and demanded an explanation of the situation. Knowing a Confederate attack was imminent and a retreat would be endangered, Meade refused Sickles' offer to withdraw.|$|E
5|$|Deserts {{are formed}} by {{weathering}} processes as large {{variations in temperature}} between day and night put strains on the rocks which consequently break in pieces. Although rain seldom occurs in deserts, there are occasional downpours that can result in flash floods. Rain falling on hot rocks can cause them to shatter and the resulting fragments and rubble strewn over the desert floor is further eroded by the wind. This picks up particles of sand and dust and wafts them aloft in sand or dust storms. Wind-blown sand grains striking any solid object <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>path</b> can abrade the surface. Rocks are smoothed down, and the wind sorts sand into uniform deposits. The grains end up as level sheets of sand or are piled high in billowing sand dunes. Other deserts are flat, stony plains where all the fine material has been blown away and the surface consists of a mosaic of smooth stones. These areas are known as desert pavements and little further erosion takes place. Other desert features include rock outcrops, exposed bedrock and clays once deposited by flowing water. Temporary lakes may form and salt pans may be left when waters evaporate. There may be underground sources {{of water in the}} form of springs and seepages from aquifers. Where these are found, oases can occur.|$|E
5|$|Preceded by a {{controversial}} bombing raid that destroyed {{much of the}} historic Old City of Caen, Operation Charnwood began at dawn on 8 July, with battalions of three infantry divisions attacking German positions north of Caen, behind a creeping barrage. Supported by three armoured brigades, the British I Corps made gradual progress against the 12th SS Panzer Division Hitlerjugend and the 16th Luftwaffe Field Division. By {{the end of the}} day the 3rd Canadian Division and the British 3rd Infantry Division and 59th (Staffordshire) Infantry Division had cleared the villages <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>path</b> and reached the outskirts of the city. Moving into Caen at dawn the following morning, the Allies encountered resistance from remnants of German units who were beginning a withdrawal across the Orne. Carpiquet airfield fell to the Canadians during the early morning and by 18:00, the British and Canadians had linked up along the north bank of the Orne. The remaining bridges were defended or impassable and with German reserves positioned to oppose their crossing, I Corps ended the operation.|$|E
