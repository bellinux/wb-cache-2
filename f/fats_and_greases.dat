Presently the republics of South America, and particularly the Argentine Republic, began to feel in their cattle trade and coffee growing the increased nearness of the European market. Hitherto the chief commodities that had attracted the European powers into unsettled and barbaric regions had been gold or other metals, spices, ivory, or slaves. But in the latter quarter of the nineteenth century the increase of the European populations was obliging their governments to look abroad for staple foods; and the growth of scientific industrialism was creating a demand for new raw materials, <b>fats</b> <b>and</b> <b>greases</b> of every kind, rubber, and other hitherto disregarded substances. It was plain that Great Britain and Holland and Portugal were reaping a great and growing commercial advantage from their very considerable control of tropical and sub-tropical products.

Tais compostos precisam atender Ãs especificaÃÃes contidas na ResoluÃÃo nÂ 07 / 2008 da ANP. Os efluentes humanos foram coletados na EstaÃÃo de Tratamento de Efluentes III, localizada na cidade de Foz do IguaÃu/PR e os efluentes suÃnos na Granja SÃo Jorge (Colombari), localizada no municÃpio de SÃo Miguel do IguaÃu/PR. Ambos foram enviados aos laboratÃrios do IAP e NUCLEOTEC para anÃlises que constatassem a presenÃa de componentes nitrogenados e fosfatados e de Ãleos e graxas totais, respectivamente. Os efluentes foram previamente autoclavados e diluÃdos para que pudessem servir de meios de cultura para os microrganismos. Foram, entÃo, inoculadas amostras de cada microalga em um tipo de efluente e avaliado o seu crescimento. Em quatro frascos foi acrescentado o composto mineral AgrosteminÂ para avaliar sua influÃncia nos resultados. Elaboradas as curvas de crescimento, apÃs 60 dias de cultivo as amostras foram filtradas a vÃcuo para posterior extraÃÃo dos Ãleos utilizando ultrassom. As amostras foram enviadas para anÃlise do teor de lipÃdios e sua composiÃÃo em termos de Ãcidos graxos por cromatografia gasosa, onde se constatou a presenÃa de Ãcidos graxos que compÃem o biodiesel. A caracterizaÃÃo fÃsico-quÃmica dos efluentes constatou a presenÃa de pequena quantidade de gorduras e graxas totais em ambos os efluentes. A anÃlise quantitativa dos lipÃdios apontou a maior concentraÃÃo no cultivo de C. vulgaris em efluentes humanos, com 50, 12 %. Com a adiÃÃo do AgrosteminÂ, o melhor rendimento foi no cultivo de S. subspicatus em efluentes suÃnos, com aumento de 80 % na produÃÃo de lipÃdios, seguido do cultivo de C. vulgaris em efluentes humanos, com 41 %.

These elements come from domestic and commercial kitchens. The absent or inefficient of a plumbing device known as grease trap has caused the trapped of <b>fat,</b> oil <b>and</b> <b>grease</b> in the sewage systems. There {{are two types of}} grease trap, namely Passive <b>Grease</b> Trap <b>and</b> Active <b>Grease</b> Trap. These grease types are collected and they can be recycled and used to produce an energy source, for example biodiesel. In Malaysia, the usages of passive grease traps are exercised. There are two parameters that govern the construction of the grease trap, namely retention time and flow rate. The ratio of sizing including the empirical formulations regarding the flow rate and the retention time will be discussed thoroughly in this paper. Furthermore, the {{understanding of the nature of}} the <b>fat,</b> oil <b>and</b> <b>grease</b> <b>and</b> the construction guideline for grease trap will be covered in this paper...|$|R

One of the key management issues for South East Water was the control of blockages and spills due to build-up of <b>fats</b> <b>and</b> <b>grease</b> in the sewer system. In 1995 it was estimated that approximately 30 % of sewer blockages were caused by <b>fats</b> <b>and</b> <b>grease,</b> <b>and</b> that 80 % of these fats came from commercial businesses (that is, restaurants, fast food outlets, etc.). In order to reduce sewer blockages, South East Water implemented a three phase Greasy Waste Program in late 1995. The first phase involved putting all commercial premises on Trade Waste Consents. Over 4, 100 such consents were issued. The second phase was to ensure all commercial customers had an appropriately sized grease interceptor. Over 1, 650 new grease interceptors were installed. The third and final phase was to ensure that all grease interceptors were pumped out regularly. South East Water developed and implemented its Wastelog system in consultation with the Victorian Waste Management Association to monitor and enforce pump-outs. By 2001, the Greasy Waste Program had contributed to a 50 % reduction in sewer blockages caused by fats...|$|R

25|$|Sewage {{treatment}} {{may also be}} referred to as wastewater treatment, although the latter is a broader term which can also be applied to purely industrial wastewater. For most cities, the sewer system will also carry a proportion of industrial effluent to the sewage treatment plant which has usually received pretreatment at the factories themselves to reduce the pollutant load. If the sewer system is a combined sewer then it will also carry urban runoff (stormwater) to the sewage treatment plant. Sewage water can travel towards treatment plants via piping and in a flow aided by gravity and pumps. The first part of filtration of sewage typically includes a bar screen to filter solids and large objects which are then collected in dumpsters and disposed of in landfills. <b>Fat</b> <b>and</b> <b>grease</b> is also removed before the primary treatment of sewage.|$|R

Wastewater from dairy industries and low cost lipase preparation at two concentrations (0. 05 and 0. 5 % w. v- 1) were used. All the samples pretreated with enzyme showed a positive effect on organic matter removal (Chemical Oxygen Demand-COD) and formation of methane. The best results were obtained when hydrolysis and biodegradation were performed simultaneously, attaining high COD and color removal independent of the lipase concentration. The enzymatic treatment considerably improved the anaerobic operational conditions and the effluent quality (lower content of suspended solids and less turbidity).

One of such is that major urban areas in the southwest of the country are beginning to have population increase and hence air quality problems that will require actions to reduce sources of pollution.
