Killer whales are unique among cetaceans, as their heads become relatively shorter as they age, i.e., the orca's caudal section enlongates more-so relative to its head.|$|E
5|$|Over 400 souterrains {{have been}} {{discovered}} in Scotland, {{many of them in}} the south-east, and although <b>few</b> <b>have</b> been dated those that have suggest a construction date in the 2nd or 3rd centuries. Unfortunately the purpose of these small underground structures is also obscure. They are usually found close to settlements (whose timber frames are much less well-preserved) and may have been for storing perishable agricultural products.|$|E
5|$|The {{culture of}} the islands has been {{affected}} by the successive influences of Celtic, Norse and English speaking peoples and this is reflected in names given to the islands. Most of the Hebrides have names with Scots Gaelic derivations, whilst those of the Northern Isles tend to be derived from the Viking names.

5|$|There {{are many}} {{volcanic}} {{areas in the}} world that have hot springs, mud pots and fumaroles, but very <b>few</b> <b>have</b> erupting geysers. The main reason for their rarity is because multiple intense transient forces must occur simultaneously for a geyser to exist. For example, even when other necessary conditions exist, if the rock structure is loose, eruptions will erode the channels and rapidly destroy any nascent geysers.|$|E
5|$|Van Dormael's films, while <b>few,</b> <b>have</b> strong {{common themes}} between them. They make {{distinctive}} use of naive voiceover {{and examine the}} world from an innocent perspective (the young Thomas in Toto le héros, the mentally handicapped protagonist of Le huitième jour, and the unborn child of Mr. Nobody). These characters views are often colorful, imaginative, and somewhat removed from reality, with slight elements of surreal imagery used to illustrate their active imaginations.|$|E
5|$|Beyond {{the area}} of Roman occupation, {{in the west and}} north, there are over 60 sites {{identified}} of wheelhouses. Perhaps a development of earlier Atlantic roundhouses, these have a characteristic outer wall surrounding a circle of stone piers (bearing a resemblance to the spokes of a wheel). Over 400 souterrains, small underground constructions, have been discovered in Scotland, many of them in the south-east, and although <b>few</b> <b>have</b> been dated, those that have suggest a construction date in the second or third centuries CE.

5|$|Einstein's {{equations}} are nonlinear partial {{differential equations}} and, as such, difficult to solve exactly. Nevertheless, {{a number of}} exact solutions are known, although only a <b>few</b> <b>have</b> direct physical applications. The best-known exact solutions, and also those most interesting from a physics point of view, are the Schwarzschild solution, the Reissner–Nordström solution and the Kerr metric, each corresponding to {{a certain type of}} black hole in an otherwise empty universe, and the Friedmann–Lemaître–Robertson–Walker and de Sitter universes, each describing an expanding cosmos. Exact solutions of great theoretical interest include the Gödel universe (which opens up the intriguing possibility of time travel in curved spacetimes), the Taub-NUT solution (a model universe that is homogeneous, but anisotropic), and anti-de Sitter space (which has recently come to prominence in the context of what is called the Maldacena conjecture).|$|E

5|$|The SNRA is {{the primary}} {{destination}} for mountain climbers and rock climbers within the forest. Thompson Peak and Hyndman Peak are two popular peaks to hike to, and Mount Heyburn is a popular rock climbing destination. Opportunities for rafting and kayaking on the upper Salmon River with conditions range from flatwater to class IV whitewater. Water levels are highest during snowmelt in spring and early summer. The large lakes in the Sawtooth Valley, including Redfish, Alturas, Pettit, and Stanley lakes, have developed boat accesses. Redfish Lake has a lodge with a marina, restaurant, and various activities. There are numerous hot springs distributed across the forest and open to public use. A <b>few</b> <b>have</b> developed tubs, including those in the Baumgartner Campground.|$|E
5|$|The head, having {{mouthparts}} projecting {{forward or}} sometimes downturned, is usually heavily sclerotized and is sometimes very large. The eyes are compound and may display remarkable adaptability, {{as in the}} case of the aquatic whirligig beetles (Gyrinidae), where they are split to allow a view both above and below the waterline. Longhorn beetles (Cerambycidae) and weevils have divided eyes, while many have eyes that are notched, and a <b>few</b> <b>have</b> ocelli, small, simple eyes usually farther back on the head (on the vertex); these are more common in larvae than in adults. Ocelli are found in the adult carpet beetle (Dermestidae), some rove beetles (Omaliinae), and the Derodontidae.|$|E
5|$|The {{single most}} major aspect of shell {{variation}} within the genus {{is the color}} patterning. In general, many arboreal snails are brightly colored, obvious examples being the bulimulid genera Drymaeus and Liguus, the cepolid Polymita, and the camaenid Papuina. However, Polymita, Liguus and Amphidromus are particularly noted for their color variations. The basic ground color of Amphidromus appears to be yellow, and this color is usually (except for Amphidromus entobaptus) confined to the surface layers of the shell, since worn specimens appear to be nearly devoid of color. In some species the background color is whitish, and a <b>few</b> <b>have</b> dark background colors. The apical whorls are pale, purple, brown, or black, and this sometimes varies within a population (as in A. quadrasi). A few species, for example A. schomburgki, have a deciduous green periostracum.|$|E

5|$|The site of Pickett's Charge {{is one of}} the best-maintained {{portions}} of the Gettysburg Battlefield. Despite millions of annual visitors to Gettysburg National Military Park, very <b>few</b> <b>have</b> walked in the footsteps of Pickett's division. The National Park Service maintains a neat, mowed path alongside a fence that leads from the Virginia Monument on West Confederate Avenue (Seminary Ridge) due east to the Emmitsburg Road {{in the direction of the}} Copse of Trees. Pickett's division, however, started considerably south of that point, near the Spangler farm, and wheeled to the north after crossing the road. In fact, the Park Service pathway stands between the two main thrusts of Longstreet's assault—Trimble's division advanced north of the current path, while Pickett's division moved from farther south.|$|E
5|$|The work {{ends with}} the {{following}} words: Fichte and the powerful men who have inherited his ideals, when they see children, think: 'Here is material that I can manipulate'... All this, to any person with natural affection for the young, is horrible; just as we teach children to avoid being destroyed by motor cars if they can, so we should teach them to avoid being destroyed by cruel fanatics... This is the task of a liberal education: to {{give a sense of}} the value of things other than domination, to help create wise citizens of a free community, and through the combination of citizenship with liberty in individual creativeness to enable men to give to human life that splendour which some <b>few</b> <b>have</b> shown that it can achieve (Russell 1938:251).|$|E
5|$|There {{has been}} {{occasional}} controversy surrounding triple-doubles made when a player achieves the feat with a late rebound.

5|$|W5 {{is found}} in Thoroughbreds {{descending}} from Puchilingui, a 1984 stallion with sabino-like white spotting and roaning. Horses with the W5 allele exhibit a huge range in white phenotype: a <b>few</b> <b>have</b> been pure white or near-white, while others have sabino-like spotting limited to high, irregular stockings and blazes that covered the face. Twenty-two members of this family were studied, and the 12 {{with some degree of}} dominant white spotting were found to have a deletion in exon 15 (p.T732QfsX9), {{in the form of a}} frameshift mutation. A later study found that the members of this family with the greatest depigmentation were compound heterozygotes who also carried the W20 allele.|$|E
5|$|From the {{beginning}} of the Bronze Age, about 2000 BCE, extensive analyses of Black Loch in Fife indicate that arable land spread at the expense of forest. From the Iron Age, beginning in the seventh century BCE, as elsewhere in Europe, hill forts were first introduced. Some of these forts in southern Scotland are associated with cultivation ridges and terraces. Over 400 souterrains, small underground constructions, have been discovered in Scotland, many of them in the south-east, and although <b>few</b> <b>have</b> been dated, those that have suggest a construction date in the second or third centuries CE. They are usually found close to settlements (whose timber frames are much less well-preserved) and may have been for storing perishable agricultural products. Aerial photography reveals extensive prehistoric field systems that underlie existing boundaries in some Lowland areas, suggesting that the fertile plains were already densely exploited for agriculture. During the period of Roman occupation of what is now northern England, and occasional advances into Southern Scotland, there was re-growth of birch, oak and hazel for five centuries, suggesting that the Roman invasions had a negative impact on the native population and the extent of agriculture.|$|E
5|$|Endoparasites {{known to}} infect wolves include {{protozoan}}s and helminths (flukes, tapeworms, roundworms and thorny-headed worms). Of 30,000 protozoan species, only a <b>few</b> <b>have</b> been recorded to infect wolves: Isospora, Toxoplasma, Sarcocystis, Babesia, and Giardia. Wolves may carry Neospora caninum, {{which is of}} particular concern to farmers, as the disease can be spread to livestock, with infected animals being 3–13 {{times more likely to}} miscarry than those not infected. Among flukes, the most common in North American wolves is Alaria, which infects small rodents and amphibians that are eaten by wolves. Upon reaching maturity, Alaria migrates to the wolf's intestine, but harms it little. Metorchis conjunctus, which enters wolves through eating fish, infects the wolf's liver or gall bladder, causing liver disease, inflammation of the pancreas, and emaciation. Most other fluke species reside in the wolf's intestine, though Paragonimus westermani lives in the lungs. Tapeworms are commonly found in wolves, as their primary hosts are ungulates, small mammals, and fish, which wolves feed upon. Tapeworms generally cause little harm in wolves, though this depends on the number and size of the parasites, and the sensitivity of the host. Symptoms often include constipation, toxic and allergic reactions, irritation of the intestinal mucosa, and malnutrition. Infections by the tapeworm Echinococcus granulosus in ungulate populations tend to increase in areas with high wolf densities, as wolves can shed Echinoccocus eggs in their feces onto grazing areas. Wolves can carry over 30 roundworm species, though most roundworm infections appear benign, depending on the number of worms and the age of the host. Ancylostoma caninum attaches itself on the intestinal wall to feed on the host's blood, and can cause hyperchromic anemia, emaciation, diarrhea, and possibly death. Toxocara canis, a hookworm known to infect wolf pups in utero, can cause intestinal irritation, bloating, vomiting, and diarrhea. Wolves may catch Dioctophyma renale from minks, which infects the kidneys, and can grow to lengths of 100cm. D. renale causes the complete destruction of the kidney's functional tissue, and can be fatal if both kidneys are infected. Wolves can tolerate low levels of Dirofilaria immitis for many years without showing any ill effects, though high levels can kill wolves through cardiac enlargement and congestive hepatopathy. Wolves probably become infected with Trichinella spiralis by eating infected ungulates. Although T. spiralis isn't known to produce clinical signs in wolves, it can cause emaciation, salivation, and crippling muscle pains in dogs. Thorny-headed worms rarely infect wolves, though three species have been identified in Russian wolves: Nicolla skrjabini, Macrocantorhynchus catulinus, and Moniliformis moniliformis.|$|E
