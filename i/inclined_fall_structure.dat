50|$|The Upper Ore Valley to {{date has}} steep sixty-degree valleys or {{inclines}} to the north, east and west. The stream cuts right through the lower valley exposing the Ashdown bed in sections along the valley floor. To the west the <b>incline</b> <b>falls</b> off to a plateau which then rises to land level. The North End of the Upper Valley has been topographically mapped to reveal its slopes. This was created {{by a group of}} volunteers that made a model from MDF based on height readings from the Valley floor. The ghyll forms a link within the Hastings green corridor both spatially and as a means to prevent further fragmentation of flora and fauna.|$|R
5000|$|The <b>Falls</b> <b>Incline</b> Railway, {{originally}} {{known as}} the Horseshoe <b>Falls</b> <b>Incline</b> is a funicular railway {{in the city of}} Niagara Falls, Ontario, Canada. It is located beside Niagara Falls at the Horseshoe Falls. The line was built in 1966 for the Niagara Parks Commission by the Swiss company Von Roll. It adopted its current name in the 1980s. [...] Originally built with open-air cars, it was rebuilt in 2013 with enclosed cars to permit year-round operation.|$|R

40|$|The {{impact of}} {{droplets}} on an <b>inclined</b> <b>falling</b> liquid film is studied experimentally using high-speed imaging. The falling film is created {{on a flat}} substrate with controllable thicknesses and flow rates. Droplets with different sizes and speeds are used to study the impact process under various Ohnesorge and Weber numbers, and film Reynolds numbers. A number of phenomena associated with droplet impact are identified and analysed, such as bouncing, partial coalescence, total coalescence, and splashing. The effects of droplet size, speed, as well the film flow rate are studied culminating in the generation of an impact regime map. The analysis of the lubrication force acted on the droplet via the gas layer shows that a higher flow rate in the liquid film produces a larger lubrication force, slows down the drainage process, and increases the probability of droplet bouncing. Our results demonstrate that the flowing film has {{a profound effect on}} the droplet impact process and associated phenomena, which are markedly more complex than those accompanying impact on initially quiescent films...|$|R

50|$|Although Meridian 59 arguably {{holds the}} title {{as the first}} realtime three {{dimensional}} online role-playing game, it lacks some features of its modern successors. For instance, the ability to jump was not implemented {{as a function of}} character input. Any jumping required in puzzle solving is done by climbing an <b>incline</b> and <b>falling</b> from one platform to another. This is the same limitation that Doom suffers; the game uses a similar engine written in part by the original developers.|$|R
50|$|The {{so-called}} Wake Maintenance Zone generally lasts 2 to 3 hours, {{during which}} one is less <b>inclined</b> to <b>fall</b> asleep. While potentially useful for completing urgent tasks, it may have a potentially unwanted side-effect of keeping one awake for several hours after the task has been completed. The hypervigilance and stimulation brought on by a second wind can cause fatigue, which, {{in the case of}} infants, can be literally painful.

40|$|The {{onset of}} {{circulating}} waves, i. e. waves with a circulating eddy {{in the main}} wave hump, and the onset of flow reversal, i. e. a vortex in the first capillary minimum, in <b>inclined</b> <b>falling</b> films is investigated {{as a function of}} the Reynolds number and inclination number using the weighted integral boundary layer (WIBL) model and direct numerical simulations (DNS). Analytical criteria for the onset of circulating waves and flow reversal based on the wave celerity, the average film thickness and the maximum and minimum film thickness have been approximated using self-similar parabolic velocity profiles. This approximation has been validated by second-order WIBL and DNS simulations. It is shown that the onset of circulating waves in the phase diagram for homoclinic solutions (waves of infinite wavelength) is strongly dependent on the inclination, but independent of the streamwise viscous dissipation effect. On the contrary, the onset of flow reversal shows a clear dependence on the viscous dissipation. Furthermore, simulation results for limit cycles (finite wavelength) reveal a strong increase of the corresponding critical Reynolds number with the excitation frequency. Additionally, a critical ratio between the maximum and substrate film thickness (value of approximately 2. 5) was found for the onset of circulating waves, which is independent of wavelength, inclination, viscous dissipation and Reynolds number.
