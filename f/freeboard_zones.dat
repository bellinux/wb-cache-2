Special {{emphasis was placed on}} the process of heat exchange in a <b>freeboard</b> <b>zone</b> of bubbling fluidized bed boiler. Operating mode of bubbling fluidized bed boiler depends on many parameters. To assess the influence of some parameters on a temperature regime inside the furnace a simplified method of zonal modeling was used in the work.

In the present work {{the possibility of using}} sawdust in the fluidized bed combustor, related combustion efficiencies and problems encountered in the combustion process are discussed.

40|$|Research and {{development}} on fluidized-bed gasification of biomass has been initiated by Yayasan Dian Desa collaboration with NEDO (New Energy and Industrial Technology Development Organization of Japan) starting from small scale (2000 – 2003), bench–scale tests (2004 – 2005) and pilot–plant (2006 – 2009).

The experiments were carried out with the following kinds of biomass: rice husk, sawdust, sugarcane bagasse and spent coffee grounds. The relationship between the gasifier cold efficiency and air factor shows that the curves for rice husk and sawdust have a maximum; for bagasse the relationship is decreasing because of intensive elutriation; for spent coffee grounds due to feeder limitations, {{it was not possible to}} feed the biomass flow corresponding to air factor values greater than 0. 2.

40|$|Biomass, a {{promising}} alternative to fossil fuels, {{has been applied}} widely for energy generation by co-firing technology in recent year particularly in the EU countries. In this thesis, a key issue of biomass co-firing technology - ash deposition in combustion, co-combustion and gasification, was comprehensively investigated in a pilot-scale bubbling fluidized bed reactor. A custom-designed, air-cooled probe was installed in the <b>freeboard</b> <b>zone</b> of the reactor to simulate the heat-transfer surface and collect ash deposits from the process. A local lignite coal, a woody biomass (white pine), and a Canadian peat {{were involved in the}} tests. The main varying operating parameters investigated in this study included: blending ratio, air/fuel ratio, moisture content and sulphur addition for the combustion/combustion tests; equivalence ratio, bed materials and fuel types for the gasification tests. A new parameter, 2 ̆ 2 relative deposition rate 2 ̆ 2 (RDA) was proposed in this study to evaluate the relative deposition tendencies of biomass fuels and biomass-coal mixed fuels against the coal as the base fuel for co-firing. As expected, co-firing of the lignite and the wood pellets (with a much lower ash-content than the lignite) resulted in a decreased superficial rate of ash deposition. However, co-firing of woody biomass and lignite coal did not significantly increase the ash deposition tendency in terms of the values of RDA, and more interestingly, co-firing of the fuel blend of 50...|$|R
40|$|For the {{reported}} series of tests, the largest reductions in NOx emissions were achieved (together with maximum combustion efficiencies) {{by using a}} primary-to-secondary-air ratio of for the fluidised bed (FB). Under such an operating condition, high freeboard-temperatures could be attained, e. g. up to 200 Â° C above that of the bed, so promoting the combustion of unburnt carbon-fines in the <b>freeboard</b> <b>zone,</b> i. e. secondary combustion ensued. This tended to counteract {{the effect of the}} reduced rate of carbon combustion in the bed, i. e. {{as a result of the}} increased rate of oxidation occurring in the freeboard. Reductions in both the NOx and SO 2 emissions could be achieved by using such a two-stage combustion process, without affecting adversely the overall combustion efficiency. If a primary-to-secondary-air ratio of (rather than) was employed, the rate of SO 2 emissions fell, but the temperature uplift in the <b>freeboard</b> <b>zone</b> was less pronounced and a reduction in combustion efficiency of 2 % was observed. The rates of emissions of NOx and SO 2 could also be reduced by the adoption of wise choices for the design and operation procedure of the fluidised-bed combustor (FBC). For example, a 45 % decrease in the rate of NOx emissions was achieved in one test merely by halving the bed's depth. The lower the available oxygen-concentration (including that provided by recycled flue-gases) within the bed, the smaller was this decrease. On the other hand, a doubling of the bed's depth led to a reduction in the SO 2 emission of approximately 4 %, provided that the in-bed oxygen concentration was maintained sufficiently high, so as to promote sulphation of the ash and any limestone present in the bed. The location of the secondary-air nozzle (i. e. in the <b>freeboard</b> <b>zone)</b> also had significant influences on the emission rates of the NOx and SO 2. A 13 % reduction in the rate of NOx emissions was achieved by increasing the height (above the sparge pipes) of the secondary-air's nozzle from 1 Â· 5 to 2 Â· 6 m. The larger this height, the greater the opportunity for char-NOx-reducing reactions (for which high-temperature conditions are preferred within the freeboard) to ensue, prior to the secondary-air injection. However, the rates of SO 2 emission fell by ~ 10 % when the height of the secondary-air's nozzle was reduced from 2 Â· 6 to 1 Â· 5 m above the sparge pipes. This was due presumably to the increased residence times of the ash and limestone sorbents (for facilitating sulphation) in the freeboard, under the oxidising condition (following secondary-air injection), which favours the complete sulphation of the sulphidated ash/lime to CaSO 4. In the presently reported series of tests, the rate of NOx emissions could be reduced by up to 83 % merely by adjusting the bed's depth and the secondary-air's nozzle-height, although these alterations led simultaneously to a 14 % increase in the rate of SO 2 emissions, and vice versa. Thus, the emissions of NOx and SOx could be controlled by the use of an appropriate design of FBC. The choice made, in practice, usually depends on which of these emission rates is critical with respect to complying with the environmental-pollution directives. Great care must be taken when comparing emission rates from the FBs, either of different sizes or incorporating alternative methods of air distribution, in order to take account of scaling effects. It is unwise, for instance, to use observations from a laboratory-size FBC to predict the quantitative behaviour of an industrial-size (i. e. large) FBC unit. This arises because of the variations in the oxygen concentration, resulting from the usually non-homogeneous, relatively less effective fluidisation achieved in the large bed; the rates of NOx emissions from the large FBC tend to be smaller (as a result of the existence of pockets of relatively low concentration oxygen in the bed) and simultaneously the rates of SO 2 emission are invariably higher. In the presently reported tests, under otherwise nominally similar conditions, an approximate halving of the rate of NOx emissions resulted when using the larger FBC (rather than the small one) together with a doubling of the SO 2 -emission rates, even though the average percentages of oxygen present in the flue gases remained identical for both the small and large FBC units. The recommended bed-depth depends upon what emission one seeks to reduce. However, where feasible, for an industrial-size combustor, it is wise to employ a shallow bed (~ 340 mm depth, when static) in order to incur relatively low operating costs. ...|$|R

This formation is directly related to the mixing of fuel and air at sufficient temperature. To reduce the CO formation, an optimal air to fuel ratio and a greater residence time are suggested. In Chapter 3 the design of the model is presented. This chapter starts with the outcome of the literature study, where the principles of the FBC are described. After that, a list of assumptions is presented. The overview of the assumptions is specified and worked out for the different reactor zones in the FBC: the Fluidized Bed, the Splashing <b>Zone</b> and the <b>Freeboard</b> <b>Zone.</b> Chapter 4 elaborates on the air speed in the FBC. The air speed affects important running characteristics such as the behavior of the sand particles in the bed, the burning efficiency and the formation of greenhouse gasses. It is also an important parameter for the determination of the dimensions of the FB and FBZ.

40|$|Entrainment is an {{important}} consideration {{in the design of}} gas-solid fluidized beds. Particle fluxes are typically measured by a movable cone in the <b>freeboard</b> <b>zone</b> which samples the total gas-solid flow or pseudo-isokinetic sampling probes which measure local fluxes. A comparison of measurements obtained with these two methods is needed to reconcile data obtained in various scale equipment. The ability to predict entrainment flux and particle size distribution is crucial for modelling freeboard reactions and specifying equipment to control particle losses.;Coning and pseudo-isokinetic sampling were used to measure solids upflux for fine sand (ddollarlcub prcubdollar = 80 dollarμdollarm), fluidized in an 0. 61 m diameter fluidized bed at several superficial gas velocities. A novel probe was used to sample the local solids downflux. Sufficient air entered the probe to match the velocity at the probe exit with the superficial velocity and convey the sampled particles to the recovery system.;The total upflux measured with these two techniques was similar although the Sauter mean diameter above the TDH was lower for the coning technique. Fractional flux profiles revealed that the rapidly changing contour of the cone had de-entrained coarser particles.;Entrainment flux data is determined with constant percentage error indicating that weighted least squares fitting is appropriate. The precision of the parameter estimates improved when this approach was adopted.;An inverse height power law model provided the best fit of experimental upflux data. Independent confirmation of the superiority of this model was offered by the close agreement between measured downflux and downflux computed from a freeboard mass balance and the fitted upflux equation.;The experimentally observed entrainment profiles can be described as the sum of a height dependent cluster flux with the same size distribution as the bed material and a non-cluster flux which is constant throughout the freeboard.;Further development of this analysis revealed that an exponential distribution of bubble sizes at the bed surface leads to the exponential decay law that is in common use.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} project is to investigate the applicability of gamma radiation densitometry in fluidized bed behaviour research, and to obtain information about the turbulent fluidization of beds with coarse particles. Gamma radiation densitometry determines the chordally averaged void fraction in the bed by measuring the transmission of gamma radiation through the bed accurately. A dual beam setup was used with two 137 ^Cs gamma radiation sources (662 keV) and detectors, placed 0. 12 m apart and vertically above each other. The technique {{has been applied to}} a fluidized bed with an inner diameter of 0. 384 m filled with Geldart B or Geldart D particles. The Geldart D bed is operated at high gas velocities resulting in operation in the turbulent regime and in a high average void fraction. A linear least squares algorithm for the reconstruction of time averaged void fraction profiles has been developed. It approximates the profile with a linear combination of basis functions. The influence of asymmetry, drift and stochastic errors on the reconstruction accuracy has been investigated. Dominant error sources are gas flow fluctuations, and inaccuracies in the gamma beam-bed and gamma beam-bed wall intersection lengths. Profiles in the Geldart D bed can be measured with up to six reconstruction points, while those in the Geldart B bed have limited reliability. Structure velocity measurements in the turbulent bed have carried out using generalized crosscorrelation techniques on the void fraction signals from the dual beam setup. The techniques give estimates for both the upflow and downflow (Geldart D only) velocities. The dependence of these velocities on gas velocity and measurement height has been studied. Downflow detection is difficult in the <b>freeboard</b> <b>zone,</b> and at low gas velocities where the slugging regime is approached. Structures in the bed have been identified by analysis of time signals, spectra, correlation functions and visual observations. Kramers Laboratorium voor Fysische TechnologieApplied Science...|$|R

The cocombustion effect in reducing the occurrence of deposits and agglomerates of blends of 5, 15, and 25 % (wt.) biomass with coal was also assessed. Chemical fractionation was applied to evaluate the reactive and nonreactive fraction of elements in the fuels, which was used to estimate their partition between the <b>freeboard</b> and bottom <b>zone</b> of the boiler.
