50|$|The City Wit fits {{securely}} {{into the}} subgenre of city comedy, and draws upon the rich tradition of earlier city comedies {{for many of}} its elements. One obvious debt is to Thomas Dekker and John Webster's Westward <b>Ho</b> (<b>c.</b> 1604). In that play, the London merchant Justiniano faces business difficulties and a rocky marriage; he pretends to leave London but in fact remains {{in the city to}} assume various disguises to manipulate the other characters. Brome adopts this plot wholesale for City Wit.|$|E
5000|$|Northward Ho (or Ho!, or Hoe) is {{an early}} Jacobean era stage play, a satire and city comedy written by Thomas Dekker and John Webster, and first {{published}} in 1607.

50|$|The Blind Beggar of Alexandria {{was hardly}} the first {{disguise}} play {{to appear on the}} Elizabethan stage; the anonymous The Knack to Know an Honest Man (1594), another Admiral's play, is one prior instance, and others can be noted. Yet the popularity of Chapman's play gave an impetus to the comic device; disguise plays were produced frequently in its aftermath. The anonymous Look About You (printed 1600), The Blind Beggar of Bethnal Green (1600) by Henry Chettle and John Day, Westward Ho and Northward <b>Ho</b> (<b>c.</b> 1604-5) by Thomas Dekker and John Webster, and Ben Jonson's Every Man in His Humour (1598), Volpone (1606) and The Alchemist (1610) are among the various examples that can be cited.|$|E

40|$|In Real-Time Strategy (RTS) games, players {{develop an}} army in real time, then {{attempt to take}} out one or more opp onents. Despite the {{existence}} of basic similarities among the many dierent RTS games, engines of these games are often built ad <b>ho</b> <b>c,</b> and co de re-use among dierent titles is minimal. We created a design pattern called Resource Entity Action (REA) that abstracts the basic interactions that entities have {{with each other in}} most RTS games. This pap er discusses REA and language abstraction and implementation using the Casanova game programming language. Our analysis shows that not only the pattern forms a solid basis for a playable RTS game, but also that it achieves considerable gains in terms of lines of co de and runtime eciency. We conclude that the REA pattern is suitable approach to the implementa- tion of many RTS game...|$|E
40|$|Nanofiltration (NF) {{has been}} shown to be an {{effective}} way of removing organic micropollutants from drinking water due to its size exclusion properties. A rapid bench scale membrane test unit was utilised to trial six NF membranes to remove the algal metabolites, microcystin, cylindrospermopsin, 2 -methylisoborneol (MIB) and geosmin (GSM). Membrane fouling due to the algal metabolites was observed for both charged and neutral metabolites. MIB and GSM were removed effectively by low molecular weight cut-off (MWCO) membranes but less effectively by a higher MWCO membrane. Removal of MIB and GSM by the higher MWCO membrane was improved as the membrane fouled. Microcystin was initially removed to above 90 % by tight NF membranes but fouling of several membranes caused decreased percent removals over time. Tight NF membranes afforded removals of 90 – 100 % for cylindrospermopsin, while removal by the higher MWCO membrane was lower but improved with time due to fouling. M. B. Dixon, C.
