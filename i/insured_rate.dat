40|$|INTRODUCTION: Clinical {{preventive}} services can detect diseases early, {{when they are}} most treatable, but these services may not be provided as recommended. Assessing the provision of services to patients at risk for cardiovascular disease (CVD) could help identify disparities and areas for improvement. METHODS: We used data on patient visits (n = 21, 261) from the National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey, 2005 - 2006, and classified patients with hypertension, hyperlipidemia, obesity, or diabetes as being at risk for CVD. We assessed differences {{in the provision of}} {{preventive services}} offered to patients who were and who were not at risk for CVD. Further, for those at risk, we compared the demographic characteristics of those who had and who had not been offered services. RESULTS: Patients at risk for CVD received significantly more preventive services compared with those not at risk. For patients at risk for CVD, aspirin therapy was more likely to be recommended to those aged 65 years or older than those aged 45 to 64 years and to men than women. Cholesterol screening was more likely for men and was less likely for patients with Medicare/Medicaid or no insurance than for patients who were <b>insured.</b> <b>Rates</b> of counseling for diet and nutrition, weight reduction, and exercise were low overall, but younger patients received these services more than older patients did. CONCLUSION: Patients at risk for CVD are not all receiving the same level of preventive care, suggesting the need to clarify clinical practice guidelines and provide clinicians with education and support for more effective lifestyle counseling...|$|R

Using a competing risk duration model, this paper measures {{the size of the}} entitlement effect across two labor markets facing dramatically different demand conditions.

30|$|The Federal-State Extended Benefits (EB) program, {{permanently}} authorized {{beginning in}} 1970, originally provided up to 13 weeks of additional UI benefits {{in states with}} high unemployment rates.

In recent years the triggers generally have been based on a TUR of 6.5 percent for a 13 -week extension or 8.0 percent for 20 weeks, combined with a 10 -percent increase in the TUR over the previous two years. Due to concerns that this lookback provision would cause some states to trigger off EB despite very high, sustained unemployment rates in recent years, it was modified in 2010 to allow states to rely on a three-year lookback period.|$|R

40|$|In recent years, {{managers}} {{have become increasingly}} aware of how their organizations can be affected by risks beyond their control.

Our results are as follows: although the risky revenues accrue only in the last period of the bank's planning horizon, the optimal hedging strategy involves futures commitments at all dates. By adapting -a sequential hedging strategy, the bank is able to hedge both the interest rate risk on the spot market at the time of fulfillment of the contracts and the risk of fluctuating forward rates at intermediate trading dates.

As it relates to the FY 2012 budget, the OMB reports that the <b>insured</b> unemployment <b>rate</b> (IUR) is projected to average 3.6% in both FY 2011 and in FY 2012. State unemployment regular benefit outlays are estimated at $61 billion in FY 2011 and $64.3 billion in FY 2012, down somewhat from Midsession estimates. Outlays from state trust fund accounts are projected to exceed revenues and interest income by $16.0 billion in FY 2011 and $15.1 billion in FY 2012. State trust fund account balances, net of loans, are projected to continue to fall, from -$27.4 billion at the end of FY 2010 to -$62.7 billion at the end of FY 2013, before starting to grow again. Net balances are not projected to become positive again until well beyond FY 2016. Up to 40 states are projected to continue borrowing heavily from the Federal Unemployment Account (FUA) over the next few years. The aggregate loan balance is projected to increase from $40.2 billion at the end of FY 2010 to a peak end-of-year balance of $68.3 billion in FY 2013. Due to the high volume of state loans and increased EB payments, FUA and EUCA are projected to borrow $26.7 billion from the general fund in FY 2011 and an additional $19.4 billion in FY 2012, with neither account projected to return to a net positive balance before 2016.

Using analysis similar to the price discrimination model of Lott and Roberts (1991) we find that a competitive environment among banks would link the spread between insured and uninsured deposit rates {{to the size of}} the insurance premium. We also find that banks that choose to operate at the regulatory minimum capital level, would increase asset risk with increased capital requirements if (1) the implicit interest paid to insured and uninsured depositors is equally sensitive to changes in risk and capital adequacy and (2) the insurance premium is independent of the level of risk and capital adequacy. Under the present risk-based premium structure, asset risk has the potential to decline when the regulatory agency raises capital requirements. Finally, we examine the time series behavior of insured and uninsured interest rates to see if it is consistent with our theoretical model.
