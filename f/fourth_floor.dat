5|$|Meanwhile, Chris (Rob Lowe) has enacted {{numerous}} {{changes to}} the parks department; he promotes Jerry (Jim O'Heir) to public relations director, appoints April (Aubrey Plaza) as everyone's assistant, places Tom (Aziz Ansari) on the nightmarish <b>fourth</b> <b>floor</b> with Andy (Chris Pratt) as his temporary assistant, and makes Ron (Nick Offerman) sit {{in the middle of}} a circular desk after the removal of his office, to force him to interact with people.

However, Donna (Retta) is concerned the overly-determined Chris will not do so and demands that Ron talk to him.

Expansion of the offices has continued since 1933, until today (June 1938), ten rooms on the third floor, and four rooms on the <b>fourth</b> <b>floor,</b> are leased by the Forest Service.

5|$|By 1950, 45% of the {{necessary}} repairs {{had been made to}} Altes Stadthaus by a few simple expedients such as emergency roofing. In the immediate post-war years, neither manpower, supplies, nor financing was available to undertake repairs on a larger scale. The reconstruction took place between 1950 and 1955 in five phases; the first focused on building up the courtyard wing on the Stralauer StraÃe side while the second phase, completed in early 1952, focused on the Stralauer StraÃe/JudenstraÃe wing and included construction of additional offices on the <b>fourth</b> <b>floor</b> and a 300-person dining hall with kitchen. However, {{for a number of reasons}} most significant of which was that the building was not the seat of government, the remaining three phases were not carried out. In addition, the reconstruction of Wilhelmine architecture was not a high priority, where as housing was and so funding for the restoration work was not included in the economic plan.|$|E
5|$|Kaja Bordevich Ballo (1988â March 28, 2008) was a {{university}} {{student in the}} French town of Nice; her father was Olav Gunnar Ballo, {{a member of the}} Norwegian Parliament.

She committed suicide hours after getting the results of the test back; Ballo jumped from the <b>fourth</b> <b>floor</b> of her dorm room. In addition to a note, her family found the Scientology personality test among her belongings. French police investigated connections between Scientology and Ballo's death, and interviewed two leaders of the organization in France. Prosecutors stated in December 2008 that they were unable to establish a causative link between the Scientology test and Ballo's death.|$|E
5|$|Ron (Nick Offerman) sends Leslie (Amy Poehler) to run {{an errand}} at the DMV in Pawnee Hall's <b>fourth</b> <b>floor,</b> a dark and unsettling place that {{includes}} probation offices and divorce filings. A reluctant and frightened Leslie navigates past reprobates and blood stains {{on the floor and}} spots Tom (Aziz Ansari) leaving the divorce office with his wife Wendy (Jama Williamson). Unaware that their relationship was a green card marriage to prevent Wendy from being deported back to Canada, Leslie later tries to comfort Tom, who insists he is fine. Nevertheless, Leslie persists in her efforts to cheer him up, in part by ordering a singing horse telegram to cheer him up. Ron, who knows about Tom's fake marriage, suggests Tom act sad so Leslie can feel like she cheered him up. When Leslie sets up a social event to cheer him up, Tom suggests a strip club, but Leslie follows Jerry's (Jim O'Heir) suggestion they go to the dinosaur-themed restaurant, Jurassic Fork.|$|E
