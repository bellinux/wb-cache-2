50|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{condition}} is to distinguish wallpaper groups from frieze <b>groups,</b> <b>which</b> possess a translation but not two linearly independent ones, and from two-dimensional discrete point <b>groups,</b> <b>which</b> have no translations at all. In other words, wallpaper groups represent patterns that repeat themselves in two distinct directions, in contrast to frieze <b>groups,</b> <b>which</b> only repeat along a single axis.|$|R

5000|$|Simple Lie {{groups are}} {{a class of}} Lie <b>groups</b> <b>which</b> {{play a role in}} Lie group theory similar to that of simple groups in the theory of {{discrete}} groups.

The three would reunite again in 2000 to form Dope HEADz, which released two albums before ceasing activity.

5|$|As {{intriguing}} as geometric Newtonian gravity may be, its basis, classical mechanics, {{is merely}} a limiting case of (special) relativistic mechanics. In the language of symmetry: where gravity can be neglected, physics is Lorentz invariant as in special relativity rather than Galilei invariant as in classical mechanics. (The defining symmetry of special relativity is the Poincaré <b>group,</b> <b>which</b> includes translations, rotations and boosts.) The {{differences between the two}} become significant when dealing with speeds approaching the speed of light, and with high-energy phenomena.|$|E

This is just another example of their repeated efforts of appearing as Robin Hood in the face of controversy about their worldwide <b>group,</b> <b>which</b> would suggest they are perceived as more akin to the Sheriff of Nottingham. Loss leaders were invented by supermarkets and {{have nothing to do with}} Bloomsbury Publishing or Harry Potter and we deeply regret having been dragged into their price-wars.|$|E
5|$|Bob Muglia was {{influential}} in a corporate restructuring at Microsoft in 1999, which assigned business divisions to customer types, rather than technologies.

According to Computer Reseller News, Muglia pushed developers to visit customers, created customer advisory boards and led other efforts to incorporate customer input into product development at Microsoft.|$|E

50|$|Discrete {{symmetry}} groups come {{in three}} types: (1) finite point <b>groups,</b> <b>which</b> include only rotations, reflections, inversion and rotoinversion - {{they are just}} the finite subgroups of O(n), (2) infinite lattice <b>groups,</b> <b>which</b> include only translations, and (3) infinite space <b>groups</b> <b>which</b> combines elements of both previous types, and may also include extra transformations like screw displacements and glide reflections. There are also continuous symmetry <b>groups,</b> <b>which</b> contain rotations of arbitrarily small angles or translations of arbitrarily small distances. The group of all symmetries of a sphere O(3) {{is an example of}} this, and in general such continuous symmetry groups are studied as Lie groups. With a categorization of subgroups of the Euclidean group corresponds a categorization of symmetry groups.|$|R

In 1936, he encouraged the reformation of the National Defence League of New Zealand (NDL), a defence lobby <b>group</b> <b>which</b> aimed to encourage and revitalise New Zealand's defence preparations for war. The country's defence arrangements were in a poor state of affairs at the time but the NDL gained little traction with the Labour Government.|$|E

40|$|Since the 1990 s, in the Dutch {{public debate}} on the {{societal}} meaning of religion a discourse has emerged which does not only relate extremist forms of Islam to terrorism, but more broadly, religious orthodoxy in general to coercion and violence. In this contribution this emergency is described and analyzed. It is related - among other things - to two switches in the perception on orthodox religious groups of prominent opinion leaders, namely: firstly from <b>groups</b> <b>which</b> become less powerful towards <b>groups</b> <b>which</b> become more powerful, and secondly from <b>groups</b> <b>which</b> adapt to their secular and liberal environment towards <b>groups</b> <b>which</b> are characterized by revitalization and radicalization.
