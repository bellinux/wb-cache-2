NXT was then picked up by The Score Television Network starting with the second season which began in June 2010.|$|E
500|$|The Guitar Trio {{continued}} touring in 1980. De Lucía reportedly {{suffered from}} headaches and backaches while performing because {{he found it}} difficult to improvise and follow McLaughlin and Coryell's advanced knowledge of jazz improvisation. Paco professed, [...] "Some people assume that they were learning from me, but I can tell you it was me learning from them. I have never studied music, I am incapable of studying harmony—I don't have the discipline, playing with McLaughlin and Di Meola was about learning these things." [...] In 1981, Coryell was replaced with Di Meola, and The Guitar Trio released one of their most successful records, <b>Friday</b> <b>Night</b> <b>in</b> San Francisco, which sold over 1 million copies and generated a significant interest in flamenco music in America and Europe. It featured an extended combination of Mediterranean Sundance and Río Ancho; this became arguably the piece most associated with the musicians. De Lucía also formed the Paco de Lucía Sextet in 1981 (which included his brothers Ramón and Pepe), and released the first of its three albums that same year. On 30 August 1981, de Lucía performed a solo set at St. Goarshausen in Germany, where he performed Monasterio de Sal and Montino among others and later performed with The Guitar Trio. The event was broadcast on national WDR television.|$|E

Snyder wished to create an action/adventure block of shows on <b>Friday</b> <b>night</b> <b>in</b> an attempt to rejuvenate Cartoon Network.

[...] In this testimony, McQueary got the month and year wrong. On May 7, 2012, the AG's office corrected the date of the incident to February 2001, estimating it occurred on or about February 9. McQueary testified he heard slapping sounds and saw Sandusky directly behind a boy whose hands were up on the wall in the men's shower room. McQueary was distraught, left the building, and subsequently called his father John McQueary, who told Mike to come over to his house right away and talk to him.|$|E

2500|$|As {{part of the}} 2006 restoration, the Tower Bar was reconfigured {{to have a more}} turn of {{the century}} ambience. [...] After the Tower Bar opened in 2006, the Los Angeles Times {{reported}} that it had become one of the trendiest in Los Angeles: [...] "On a recent night at the intimate Tower Bar, Jennifer Aniston dines 10 feet away from Joaquin Phoenix and white-coated waiters weave between tables like players in a Broadway musical. A $155 bottle of Pinot Noir is uncorked here, chilled oysters delivered there and a bow given every now and then." [...] The New York Times also reported on the transformation of the hotel: [...] "The striped silk-and-walnut Tower Bar restaurant is already a retro clubhouse for the mature Hollywood set (think Brian Grazer and Barbara Walters), complete with $13 martinis and the octogenarian former Sinatra pianist Page Cavanaugh tickling the ivories. On a <b>Friday</b> <b>night</b> <b>in</b> mid-December, Anjelica Huston and Courtney Love swanned by to dine with a 30-something crowd far more sophisticated than the teenyboppers roaming Sunset Boulevard outside." [...] Other celebrities visiting the Tower Bar include Sean Penn, Victoria Beckham, Tom Cruise and Jennifer Lopez. [...] Dmitri Dmitrov, a 60-year-old Macedonian immigrant with Rudolph Valentino hair, is the Tower Bar's maître d’hôtel. [...] Dmitrov is a sphinxlike figure who knows everything and says nothing. [...] In the six years since Klein, following a suggestion from the designer Tom Ford, rescued Dmitrov from a fading career at drearily elegant places like a local Russian restaurant that featured a harpist, ice swans and a caviar menu, he has become a Hollywood institution. [...] In February 2007, the New York Post reported that the hotel's front desk manager was nearly fired when Lindsay Lohan tried to book three rooms. [...] Owner Jeff Klein was reportedly overheard yelling at the manager, [...] "If that piece of trailer trash so much as enters my driveway, you are fired. She can't come here with all my chic guests, she'll ruin the place." [...] Also in 2007, Sean [...] "Diddy" [...] Combs showed up with an entourage to attend a Golden Globes party, and was told his name was not on the list. When Combs was reported to have become [...] "verbally abusive," [...] owner Jeff Klein personally asked Combs to leave. [...] When Klein said he would call the police if Combs did not leave, the New York Post reported that Combs was heard shouting, [...] "Just try it - I'll {{spend the rest of my}} life hunting you down!" [...] In February 2009, Vanity Fair hosted its Oscar party at the Sunset Tower.|$|E

60|$|So {{you have}} the state of things on <b>Friday</b> <b>night.</b> <b>In</b> the centre, {{sticking}} into the skin of our old planet Earth like a poisoned dart, was this cylinder. But the poison was scarcely working yet. Around it was a patch of silent common, smouldering in places, and with a few dark, dimly seen objects lying in contorted attitudes here and there. Here {{and there was a}} burning bush or tree. Beyond was a fringe of excitement, and farther than that fringe the inflammation had not crept as yet. In {{the rest of the world}} the stream of life still flowed as it had flowed for immemorial years. The fever of war that would presently clog vein and artery, deaden nerve and destroy brain, had still to develop.|$|E

6000|$|It {{was in this}} dull {{season of}} the year, then, of a shining <b>Friday</b> <b>night</b> <b>in</b> autumn, that Mr. Pendennis, having {{completed}} at his newspaper office a brilliant leading article--such as Captain Shandon himself might have written, had the Captain been in good-humour, and inclined to work, which he never would do except under compulsion--that Mr. Arthur Pendennis having written his article, and reviewed it approvingly as it lay before him in its wet proof-sheet {{at the office of}} the paper, bethought him that he would cross the water, and regale himself with the fireworks and other amusements of Vauxhall. So he affably put in his pocket the order which admitted [...] "Editor of Pall Mall Gazette and friend" [...] to that place of recreation, and paid with the coin of the realm a sufficient sum to enable him to cross Waterloo Bridge. The walk thence to the Gardens was pleasant, the stars were shining in the skies above, looking down upon the royal property, whence the rockets and Roman candles had not yet ascended to outshine the stars.|$|E
60|$|A {{singular}} circumstance then {{arose in}} the case. The object in hand being {{to show that the}} prisoner went down, with some fellow-plotter untracked, in the Dover mail on that <b>Friday</b> <b>night</b> <b>in</b> November five years ago, {{and got out of the}} mail in the night, as a blind, at a place where he did not remain, but from which he travelled back some dozen miles or more, to a garrison and dockyard, and there collected information; a witness was called to identify him as having been at the precise time required, in the coffee-room of an hotel in that garrison-and-dockyard town, waiting for another person. The prisoner's counsel was cross-examining this witness with no result, except that he had never seen the prisoner on any other occasion, when the wigged gentleman who had all this time been looking at the ceiling of the court, wrote a word or two on a little piece of paper, screwed it up, and tossed it to him. Opening this piece of paper in the next pause, the counsel looked with great attention and curiosity at the prisoner.|$|E
60|$|So he {{broached}} {{to me what}} speedily {{became the}} leading occupation of his culminating years, Crest Hill. But all the world has heard of that extravagant place which grew and changed its plans as it grew, and bubbled like a salted snail, and burgeoned and bulged and evermore grew. I know not what delirium of pinnacles and terraces and arcades and corridors glittered at last upon the uplands of his mind; the place, for all that its expansion was terminated abruptly by our collapse, is wonderful enough as it stands,--that empty instinctive building of a childless man. His chief architect {{was a young man}} named Westminster, whose work he had picked out in the architecture room of the Royal Academy on account of a certain grandiose courage in it, but with him he associated from time to time a number of fellow professionals, stonemasons, sanitary engineers, painters, sculptors, scribes, metal workers, wood carvers, furniture designers, ceramic specialists, landscape gardeners, and the man who designs the arrangement and ventilation of the various new houses in the London Zoological Gardens. In addition he had his own ideas. The thing occupied his mind at all times, but it held it completely from Friday night to Monday morning. He would come down to Lady Grove on <b>Friday</b> <b>night</b> <b>in</b> a crowded motor-car that almost dripped architects. He didn't, however, confine himself to architects; every one was liable to an invitation to week-end and view Crest Hill, and many an eager promoter, unaware of how Napoleonically and completely my uncle had departmentalised his mind, tried to creep up to him by way of tiles and ventilators and new electric fittings. Always on Sunday mornings, unless the weather was vile, he would, so soon as breakfast and his secretaries were disposed of, visit the site with a considerable retinue, and alter and develop plans, making modifications, Zzzz-ing, giving immense new orders verbally--an unsatisfactory way, as Westminster and the contractors ultimately found.|$|E
