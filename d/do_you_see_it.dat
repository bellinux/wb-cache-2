Some see it as a human rights issue. How <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>see</b> <b>it?</b> And {{what we need to do}} about it? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Certainly. There will be beds {{to spare}} soon--there {{is to be}} a change at last in our wretched lives here. <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>see</b> <b>it</b> now?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Aquiline!' cried Quilp, {{thrusting}} in his head, {{and striking}} the feature with his fist. 'Aquiline, you hag. <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>see</b> <b>it?</b> Do {{you call this}} flat? Do you? Eh?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{have been}} {{unconscious}} {{for a very}} long time," [...] he said. [...] "Often I used to listen to you talking to yourself. <b>You</b> don't mind, <b>do</b> <b>you?</b> <b>You</b> <b>see</b> <b>it</b> was part of the experiment." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You are {{a little}} ashamed, as it is," [...] Ralph laughed. [...] "We had not {{intended}} {{to come out in}} our new character, so soon; but when my hair was once <b>done,</b> <b>you</b> <b>see,</b> <b>it</b> was impossible to go about in uniform." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Why not, aunt? It is {{not easy}} to answer such a {{question}} as that. A woman, I suppose, can't say why she doesn't love a man, nor yet why she <b>does.</b> <b>You</b> <b>see,</b> <b>it's</b> so sudden. I hadn't thought of him in that way." ...|$|R
6000|$|The ex-vaquero was {{trembling}} like a child. [...] "Look," [...] he said hoarsely, [...] "look, <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>see?</b> <b>It</b> is {{the hand of}} God," [...] and fainted on the floor! ...|$|E
6000|$|... "What," [...] {{said the}} doctor after a pause, leaning back and sending wreaths of smoke up towards the star-dusted zenith, [...] "what is your idea of your work? I mean, how <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>see</b> <b>it</b> in {{relation}} to yourself--and things generally?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "So much? It {{does not}} look like it. What a very pretty bit of coral I see over there, close to the white rock; <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>see</b> <b>it?</b> It is bright pink. Oh, I would like so much to have it." ...|$|E
6000|$|Her face clouded. [...] "We've {{tried to}} cut out that saloon, but <b>it</b> can't be <b>done.</b> <b>You</b> <b>see,</b> <b>it's</b> on a {{patented}} claim--the claim was bogus, of course, and we've made complaint, but the matter is hung up, and that gives 'em {{a chance to go}} on." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "The Ghost?" [...] {{repeated}} Mrs. Lecount, clasping {{her hands}} in graceful astonishment. [...] "Dear madam, pardon me! Is {{there such a thing}} in the world? Where <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>see</b> <b>it?</b> In Vauxhall Walk? Tell me--you are the first lady I ever met with who has seen a ghost--pray tell me!" ...|$|R

"' <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> know, Ned, I don't {{believe that}} feller owns {{the whole of}} the boat, 'cause he acts so queer about her, an' I'm almost sorry we spent that money for what we <b>did.</b> <b>You</b> <b>see,</b> <b>it</b> belongs to the office, and when I get back an' tell the manager that I had to spend it to get {{something}} to eat, he'll take it out of my wages." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "There's some {{heart in}} it, too," [...] he growled judiciously. It was a remark of a {{perfectly}} sane seaman. But he added immediately: [...] "It was about time I should come on deck. I've been nursing my strength for this--just for this. <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>see</b> <b>it,</b> sir?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{is for me}} not {{to allow}} you to study," [...] replied Forester, [...] "all this forenoon, but to require you to sit still at your desk, with nothing to <b>do.</b> <b>You</b> <b>see</b> <b>it</b> will be a sort of solitary imprisonment, only your prison will in itself be a {{pleasant}} place." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Perhaps!" [...] {{she replied}} indifferently. [...] "I will grant you that greed is the keynote of this place; yet even {{that has its}} {{interesting}} side. Where else <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>see</b> <b>it</b> so developed? Where else could you see the same emotion actuating {{a number of very}} different people in an altogether different manner?" ...|$|E
5000|$|..[...] [...] it's {{not another}} way of <b>doing</b> design, <b>you</b> <b>see,</b> <b>it's</b> {{a way of doing}} what {{designers}} don't do at all." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Thanks, uh, thank you, sir, but I wouldn't like to <b>do</b> <b>it.</b> <b>You</b> <b>see,</b> <b>it's</b> kind of my vacation. If I've done {{anything}} I'm tickled----" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Now we'll move. Watch me. Right Face! <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>see</b> how <b>it's</b> <b>done?</b> Balance on the heel, this way, {{and swing}} around. Now then, Right Face!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That's {{enough for}} our purpose," [...] the {{housekeeper}} resumed. [...] "On {{the other side}} of the curtain, if you had looked in, you would have found the library. Suppose my master is as polite as usual, and begs to be excused for not receiving you, because it is an inconvenient time. And suppose you are polite on your side and take yourself off by the drawing-room door. You will find me waiting downstairs, on the first landing. <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>see</b> <b>it</b> now?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Here it is," [...] she said, {{recovering}} {{the lost}} remembrance. [...] "Not the gardener, but the gardener's wife. A memorandum {{to speak to}} her about Mrs. Inchbare. Observe, Hopkins, the association of ideas. Mrs. Inchbare is associated with the poultry; the poultry are associated with the gardener's wife; the gardener's wife is associated with the gardener--and so the gardener gets into my head. <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>see</b> <b>it?</b> I am always trying to improve your mind. You do see it? Very well. Now about Mrs. Inchbare? Has she been here again?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The scoundrels are so {{numerous}} that {{we could}} only hope to succeed with considerable loss, and we are so weak already that we can't afford it. So the chief sets his face against sorties, but I expect that we shall be driven to it one of these days. That new battery is terribly troublesome also. There, <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>see,</b> <b>it</b> lies just over that brow, so that the shot from our battery cannot touch it, while it can pound away at our house, and indeed at all the houses along this line." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, I know I did," [...] he admitted, [...] "and now I don't want to any more, <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>see?</b> <b>It's</b> this cursed {{place and}} this cursed life! One's feet seem {{always on the}} sands. I wouldn't have {{believed}} it when I first came here. Don't tease me, Sophy," [...] he added, turning toward her suddenly. [...] "I am rather inclined to despise myself these last few weeks. Don't make me worse--don't make me loathe myself!" ...|$|R
6000|$|LADY BROCKLEHURST (at once suspicious). Why impossible? (LADY MARY cannot answer, {{or perhaps}} {{she is too}} proud.) <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>see</b> why <b>it</b> should be impossible, my man? ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Except {{that it is}} a fire,' said Tom, 'it {{looks to}} me as stupid and blank as {{everything}} else looks. What <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>see</b> in <b>it?</b> Not a circus?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... “You {{seem to me}} {{to speak}} with a German accent,” {{continued}} the lady. “You’re probably from Basel. A franc and a half are sufficient. I see you’ve left behind the little red bag I asked you to hold between your knees; you’ll please {{to go back to the}} other house and get it. Very well, si vous me manquez I’ll make a complaint of you to-morrow at the administration.

6000|$|... "Exactly. Now observe. We {{are already}} in the month of June. Towards {{the end of the month}} (I can't be {{particular}} to a day) a year will have elapsed from the time when we believe the jewel to have been pledged. There is a chance--to say the least--that the person who pawned it, may be prepared to redeem it when the year's time has expired. If he redeems it, Mr. Luker must himself--according to the terms of his own arrangement--take the Diamond out of his banker's hands. Under these circumstances, I propose setting a watch at the bank, as the present month draws to an end, and discovering who the person is to whom Mr. Luker restores the Moonstone. <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>see</b> <b>it</b> now?" ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Not {{even the}} sign of God's anger could make me forget her. How could I forsake my child, feeling my vigor all the time--the blood warm within me? Warm as yours.

She's a struggling woman--my own child {{that we used to}} pray over together, my poor wife and I.

6000|$|Written in Oscar's {{character}} (and representing Nugent {{as having}} done all that he had promised me to do) it designedly omits the customary courtesy of Oscar's style. The object {{of this is to}} offend Mr. Finch--with what end in view you will presently see. The rector was the last man in existence to dispense with the necessary apologies and expressions of regret from a man engaged to his daughter, who had left her as Oscar had left her--no matter how the circumstances might appear to excuse him. The curt, off-hand postscript signed [...] "Oscar" [...] was the very thing to exasperate the wound already inflicted on Mr. Finch's self-esteem, and to render it at least probable that he would reconsider his intention of himself performing the marriage ceremony. In the event of his refusal, what would happen? A stranger, entirely ignorant of which was Nugent and which was Oscar, would officiate in his place. <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>see</b> <b>it</b> now? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Bon! I am glad of it. I knew it, somehow; {{before you}} told me. I was {{conscious}} of rapport between you and myself. You are patient, and I am choleric; you are quiet and pale, and I am tanned and fiery; you are a strict Protestant, and I am a sort of lay Jesuit: but we are alike--there is affinity between us. <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>see</b> <b>it,</b> Mademoiselle, when {{you look in the}} glass? Do you observe that your forehead is shaped like mine--that your eyes are cut like mine? Do you hear that you have some of my tones of voice? Do you know that you have many of my looks? I perceive all this, and believe that you were born under my star. Yes, you were born under my star! Tremble! for where that is the case with mortals, the threads of their destinies are difficult to disentangle; knottings and catchings occur--sudden breaks leave damage in the web. But these 'impressions,' as you say, with English caution. I, too, have had my 'impressions.'" ...|$|E
