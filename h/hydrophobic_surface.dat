The results {{show that there is}} a linear relationship between the intrinsic contact angle and the interaction strength of fluid-wall particles. For <b>hydrophobic</b> <b>surfaces</b> with the same intrinsic contact angle, the micromorphology can increase the surface hydrophobicity, especially the hierarchical micromorphology. The dynamic behaviors of droplets impacting on solid surfaces are affected by the wettability. The surface hydrophobicity is stronger, and the rebound phenomenon occurs easier. If the droplet’s kinetic energy is greater than the sum of the surface energy and the minimum conversion gravitational potential energy when the spreading and shrinking finish, the rebound phenomenon will occur. As the <b>hydrophobic</b> <b>surface’s</b> viscous dissipation is much smaller than the hydrophilic surface’s, the droplet still has high kinetic energy after the spreading and shrinking, which is advantageous to rebound for droplets...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: The contact of two <b>hydrophobic</b> <b>surfaces</b> {{in water}} is of {{importance}} in biology, catalysis, material science, and geology. A tenet of hydrophobic attraction is {{the release of}} an ordered water layer, leading to a dry contact between two <b>hydrophobic</b> <b>surfaces.</b> Although the water-free contact has been inferred from numerous experimental and theoretical studies, {{this has not been}} directly measured. Here, we use surface sensitive sum frequency generation spectroscopy to directly probe the contact interface between hydrophobic poly-(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS) and two <b>hydrophobic</b> <b>surfaces</b> (a self-assembled monolayer, OTS, and a polymer coating, PVNODC). We show that the interfacial structures for OTS and PVNODC are identical in dry contact but that they differ dramatically in wet contact. In water, the PVNODC surface partially rearranges at grain boundaries, trapping water at the contact interface leading to a 50 % reduction in adhesion energy compared to OTS−PDMS contact. The Young−Dupre ́ equation, used extensively to calculate the thermodynamic work of adhesion, predicts no differences between the adhesion energy for these two <b>hydrophobic</b> <b>surfaces...</b>|$|R
40|$|Here, direct noninvasive neutron {{reflectivity}} measurements {{reveal the}} presence of a reduced (deuterated) water density region, with a sigmoidal density profile at the hydrophobic silane–water interface that depends on the type and concentration of dissolved gases in the water. Removal of dissolved gases decreases the width of the reduced water density region, and their reintroduction leads to its increase. When compared with recent computer simulations, a locally fluctuating density profile is proposed, whereas preexisting nanobubbles are excluded. The presence of a fluctuating reduced water density region between two <b>hydrophobic</b> <b>surfaces</b> and the attractive “depletion force” to which it leads may help explain the hydrophobic force and its reported diminution in deaerated water. Our results are also quantitatively consistent with recent dynamic surface force apparatus results that drastically revise previous estimates of the slip length of water flowing past <b>hydrophobic</b> <b>surfaces</b> from microns to ≈ 20 nm. Our observations, therefore, {{go a long way toward}} reconciling three quite different types of experiments and phenomena: water depletion at <b>hydrophobic</b> <b>surfaces,</b> water slip at <b>hydrophobic</b> <b>surfaces,</b> and the <b>hydrophobic</b> interaction...|$|R
2500|$|Structural {{properties}} of the analyte molecule {{play an important role}} in its retention characteristics. In general, an analyte with a larger <b>hydrophobic</b> <b>surface</b> area (C–H, C–C, and generally non-polar atomic bonds, such as S-S and others) is retained longer because it is non-interacting with the water structure. On the other hand, analytes with higher polar surface area (conferred by the presence of polar groups, such as -OH, -NH2, COO− or -NH3+ in their structure) are less retained as they are better integrated into water. Such interactions are subject to steric effects in that very large molecules may have only restricted access to the pores of the stationary phase, where the interactions with surface ligands (alkyl chains) take place. [...] Such surface hindrance typically results in less retention.|$|E

2500|$|RP-HPLC {{operates}} {{on the principle}} of hydrophobic interactions, which originates from the high symmetry in the dipolar water structure and plays the most important role in all processes in life science. RP-HPLC allows the measurement of these interactive forces. The binding of the analyte to the stationary phase is proportional to the contact surface area around the non-polar segment of the analyte molecule upon association with the ligand on the stationary phase. This solvophobic effect is dominated by the force of water for [...] "cavity-reduction" [...] around the analyte and the C18-chain versus the complex of both. The energy released in this process is proportional to the surface tension of the eluent (water: 7.3J/cm², methanol: 2.2J/cm²) and to the <b>hydrophobic</b> <b>surface</b> of the analyte and the ligand respectively. The retention can be decreased by adding a less polar solvent (methanol, acetonitrile) into the mobile phase to reduce the surface tension of water.

It is {{generally}} made of a porous, plastic (polyethylene) material, that is saturated with a wax to create a very quick and smooth, <b>hydrophobic</b> <b>surface.</b> P-Tex is a brand name that has become synonymous with base material. It is important that the base be [...] "slippery", with respect to the snow surface and board interaction. Bases are made to have amorphous areas that are porous to wax. Wax is an important finishing product for all base materials. Not only does it allow the snowboard to have a smoother glide, but it also allows the rider to change the characteristics of the base and adjust the board to the snow conditions. Different base waxes are available for different temperatures. The base, when maintained, will have a designed base structure that not only channels snow, air and water, but leaves it open enough for wax to penetrate deep inside it. This pattern is created with a stonegrind machine at the factory or a local ski shop.

2500|$|During the {{oligomerization}} of PA63, {{molecules of}} EF and/or LF rapidly and simultaneously bind to the PA prechannel. This binding occurs because after removing the PA20 domain, a large <b>hydrophobic</b> <b>surface</b> is uncovered on domain 1 of PA63. Domain 1 provides a large surface that the {{interacts with the}} N-terminus of EF and LF, which is almost completely homologous for the first ~36 residues and similar in tertiary structure for the first ~250 residues. Studies on the binding region of LF and EF demonstrated that a large surface area contacts with domain 1 of two adjacent PA63 molecules when in the heptamer conformation. This large binding area explains why previous studies could only bind up to three molecules on a PA63 heptamer. The co-crystal structure of the PA octamer in complex with N-terminal LF revealed that the binding interaction is, in fact, two discontinuous sites. One site, termed the C-terminal subsite, resembles a classic [...] "hot-spot" [...] with predicted salt-bridges and electrostatic interactions. The other site, termed the alpha-clamp subsite, is a deep cleft that nonspecifically binds the N-terminal alpha helix and short beta strand of LF, guiding the N-terminus of the substrate towards the PA prechannel lumen. In this manner, the alpha clamp aids in protein translocation, nonspecifically binding and subsequently unfolding secondary structure as it unfurls from the substrate. The LF/EF binding site is now being utilized for delivery of therapeutics via fusion proteins.|$|E

40|$|International audienceWe have {{developed}} a multiwell-based protein aggregation assay to study the kinetics of insulin adsorption and aggregation on <b>hydrophobic</b> <b>surfaces</b> and to investigate the molecular mechanisms involved. Protein-surface interaction progresses in two phases: (1) a lag phase during which proteins adsorb and prefibrillar aggregates form on the material surface and (2) a growth phase during which amyloid fibers form and then are progressively released into solution. We studied the effect of three bacterial chaperones, DnaK, DnaJ, and ClpB, on insulin aggregation kinetics. In the presence of ATP, the simultaneous presence of DnaK, DnaJ, and ClpB allows good protection of insulin against aggregation. In the absence of ATP, DnaK alone is able to prevent insulin aggregation. Furthermore, DnaK binds to insulin adsorbed on <b>hydrophobic</b> <b>surfaces.</b> This process is slowed {{in the presence of}} ATP and can be enhanced by the cochaperone DnaJ.
