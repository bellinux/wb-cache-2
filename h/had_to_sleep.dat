5|$|Myra Hindley {{was born}} in Crumpsall on 23 July 1942 and raised in Gorton, then a working-class area of Manchester. Her parents, Nellie and Bob Hindley (the latter an alcoholic), beat her {{regularly}} as a young child. The small house the family lived in was in such poor condition that Hindley and her parents <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>sleep</b> in the only available bedroom, she in a single bed next to her parents' double. The family's living conditions deteriorated further when Hindley's sister, Maureen, {{was born in}} August 1946. About {{a year after the}} birth, Hindley, then 5, was sent by her parents to live with her grandmother, whose home was nearby.|$|E
5|$|Approximately {{two weeks}} after {{violence}} broke out in Benghazi, Owumi {{received a call from}} his teammate Moustapha Niang, who said that Elturki would attempt to help the two players escape the country. Elturki had arranged for a car to take them to an Egyptian refugee camp in Sallum, following Al-Nasr coach Sherif Azmy. Owumi passed through several rebel checkpoints and arrived at the Egyptian border in 12 hours. Both Owumi and Niang, due to their appearance, were suspected of being foreign mercenaries fighting for Gaddafi and were subject to harsher treatment. Without proper immigration papers, Owumi was held in Sallum for three days. He was arrested and then imprisoned in solitary confinement for two hours. When he was removed, he <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>sleep</b> outside for three days. Owumi and Niang finally escaped the camp {{in the middle of the}} night. They bribed the driver of a bus, which only allowed Egyptian citizens, to help them leave. At around this time, Owumi received a call from Azmy, who wanted to meet him in his home in Alexandria. As a result, he convinced the driver, who was headed to Cairo, to lead them to another bus to Alexandria.|$|E
5|$|Descriptions {{from early}} explorers and {{settlers}} give {{some idea of}} what the Pine Creek Gorge was like before it was clearcut. The forest was up to 85percent hemlock and white pine, with the rest hardwoods. Many animal species that are now vanished inhabited the area. A herd of 12,000American bison migrated along the West Branch Susquehanna River in 1773. Pine Creek was home to large predators such as wolves, lynx, wolverines, panthers, fishers, foxes and bobcats, all save the last three now locally extinct. The area had herds of elk and deer, and large numbers of black bears, river otters, and beavers. In 1794, two of the earliest white explorers to travel up Pine Creek found so many rattlesnakes on its banks that they <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>sleep</b> in their canoe. Further upstream, insects forced them to do the same.|$|E

5|$|In 2009, the {{university}} {{responded to a}} series of New York Times interviews that showed a pattern of labor abuses in its fledgling Abu Dhabi location, creating a statement of labor values for Abu Dhabi campus workers. A 2014 follow-up article found that while some conditions had improved, contractors for the multibillion-endowment university were still frequently subjecting their workers to third-world labor conditions. The article documented that these conditions included confiscation of worker passports, forced overtime, recruitment fees and cockroach-filled dorms where workers <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>sleep</b> under beds. According to the article, workers who attempted to protest the NYU contractors' conditions were promptly arrested. Reports also claimed that those arrested by police were later abused at the police station. Many workers who were not local were then deported to their home countries. The university quickly responded to the reports with an apology to the workers. In 2015, NYU compensated thousands of migrant workers on its Abu Dhabi complex.|$|E
25|$|Most WDs {{lived in}} barracks, each wing of which {{typically}} accommodated approximately 68 women. WDs {{who worked at}} Air Force Headquarters in Ottawa lived in a barrack block that housed up to 800 airwomen. The barracks weren't well insulated. During winter some <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>sleep</b> with their uniforms to keep warm while some found unusual ways to insulate their mattresses such as using newspapers. In locations such as cities where government housing was not available, personnel would live in private accommodations and receive an allowance to pay for room, board, and transportation.|$|E
50|$|On {{their way}} home, Thomas and Percy are {{surprised}} to see the Sodor Suspension Bridge is not painted and the new airport is only half-built. Worse still, Tidmouth Sheds have been demolished. Diesel reveals that the rebuilding the sheds was their important job, but because Thomas delayed it giving Diesel bananas, they haven't been able to finish it on time. As a result, all the engines are forced <b>to</b> <b>sleep</b> on different parts on the Island. Thomas <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>sleep</b> with Emily at Knapford Sheds; James <b>has</b> <b>to</b> go to the coaling plant; Gordon <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>sleep</b> under a tent; Toby is lucky enough to stay in his own shed; Edward <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>sleep</b> at the quarry with Diesel; and Henry and Percy <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>sleep</b> at the Smelters shed. But there is worse to come. That night, a huge storm sweeps across the island and causes havoc. Trees are blown onto the line and the Sodor Suspension Bridge collapses. The next morning, the Fat Controller tells the engines that the storm damage must be cleared up before the work on the new sheds and the airport can continue.|$|R

25|$|To explain {{himself to}} the people, John ordered that posters be put up along the streets stating that his {{departure}} was unavoidable despite all efforts made to assure the integrity and peace of the kingdom. The posters recommended that everyone remain calm, orderly and not resist the invaders, so that blood not be shed in vain. Because of the rush to depart, the Prince Regent John, Queen Maria, Prince Pedro, Prince of Beira (later Pedro I of Brazil and Pedro IV of Portugal), and the Infante Miguel (later Miguel I of Portugal) were all in a single ship. This was an imprudent decision given the dangers of a transatlantic voyage in that era, since it placed at risk the succession of the crown in case of shipwreck. Carlota Joaquina and the infantas were on two other ships. The {{number of people who}} embarked with John remains a matter of controversy; in the 19th century there was talk of up to 30 thousand emigrants; more recent estimates vary between five hundred and fifteen thousand, the latter being close to the maximum capacity of the squadron of fifteen ships, including their crews. Still, the ships were overcrowded. According to Pedreira e Costa, taking into account all of the variables, the most likely numbers fall between four and seven thousand passengers plus the crews. Many families were separated, and even high officials failed to secure a place on the ships and were left behind. The voyage was not a tranquil one. Several ships were in precarious condition, and overcrowding created humiliating conditions for the nobility, the majority of whom <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>sleep</b> huddled in the open in the poops. Hygienic conditions were bad, including an epidemic of head lice. Many had failed to bring changes of clothing. Several people fell ill. Supplies were scarce, causing rationing. Furthermore, the flotilla spent ten days nearly becalmed in the equatorial zone under a scorching heat that caused moods to turn quite sour. The flotilla also faced two storms and was eventually dispersed near Madeira. In the middle of the voyage, Prince John changed his plans and decided to head for Salvador, Bahia, probably for political reasons. He wanted to please the inhabitants of the colony's first capital, which had given many signs of discontent with the loss of its old status. The ships carrying his wife and the infantas held to the original destination of Rio de Janeiro.|$|E
500|$|Smith {{played a}} variety of sports in his youth, but {{considered}} baseball to be his favorite. He developed quick reflexes through various athletic and leisure activity, such as bouncing a ball off the concrete steps {{in front of his}} house, moving in closer to reduce reaction time with each throw. When not at the local YMCA or playing sports, Smith sometimes went with friends to the neighborhood lumberyard, springboarding off inner tubes and doing flips into sawdust piles (a precursor to his famous backflips). In 1965, at age ten, he endured the Watts Riots with his family, recalling that, [...] "We <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>sleep</b> on the floor because of all the sniping and looting going on." ...|$|E
500|$|Merrick died on 11 April 1890, aged 27. Although the {{official}} {{cause of his}} death was asphyxia, Treves, who performed the autopsy on the body, said that Merrick {{had died of a}} dislocated neck. He believed that Merrick, who <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>sleep</b> sitting up because of the weight of his head, had been attempting to sleep lying down to [...] "be like other people". In absence of the possibility of genetic tests, the exact cause of Merrick's deformities has long been unclear, so that throughout much of the 20th century it was speculated that Merrick was affected by other neurological syndromes. Only in 1986 was it conjectured that he had Proteus syndrome, a very rare congenital disorder also known as Wiedemann syndrome (named after the German pediatrician Hans-Rudolf Wiedemann). DNA tests on his hair and bones in 2003 in a study by Charis Eng were inconclusive.|$|E

500|$|After {{signing with}} Fat Wreck Chords, Tintari and White left the band; Tintari was {{replaced}} by Brandon Barnes shortly thereafter. [...] With their new drummer, Rise Against began to work on The Unraveling at Sonic Iguana Studios in Lafayette, Indiana, where Principe and Wleklinski had previously recorded material for 88 Fingers Louie. Recording took place {{over the course of}} five weeks, with Mass Giorgini serving as the producer, and Wleklinski serving as the assistant engineer. Wleklinski later remarked on the grueling workdays: [...] "12-hour days for 4 of those weeks, and then 22-24 hours per day during that last week of tracking. These were the times of 'If you don't play it right, you have to play it again,' not 'That was good enough, I'll edit it so it's on time.'" [...] Wleklinski also commented that it was difficult to split his time between recording guitar parts and engineering the songs, and that during the last week he <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>sleep</b> on the studio floor.|$|E
500|$|Campbell <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>sleep</b> {{wearing his}} make-up. Because of several scenes that {{required}} to be shot in both {{the day and the}} night, it was considered easiest to have Campbell sleep all night wearing his make-up, since removing it was too complicated. When Campbell eventually had the effect removed, he was alarmed to notice that his face had actually [...] "changed shape" [...] because of how long the make-up had been applied, though it returned to normal after an extended amount of time. This serves as one of several moments where the film-makers had to be creative to make the film considering the low budget. Other examples include blacking out the windows to make scenes darker and shooting all night long to make the filming schedule. Raimi had to get increasingly inventive during production, often coming up with [...] "bizarre" [...] ideas while shooting scenes. This led to him experimenting with camera moves and camera speeds, [...] "taking it a little further than we had gone before, recording synch-sound at a third slower for a more monstrous effect.|$|E
