5|$|The idea {{of using}} aspirin to prevent {{clotting}} diseases (such as heart attacks and strokes) was revived in the 1960s, when medical researcher Harvey Weiss found that aspirin had an anti-adhesive effect on blood platelets (and unlike other potential antiplatelet drugs, aspirin had low toxicity). Medical Research Council <b>haematologist</b> John O'Brien picked up on Weiss's finding and, in 1963, began working with epidemiologist Peter Elwood on aspirin's anti-thrombosis drug potential. Elwood began a large-scale trial of aspirin as a preventive drug for heart attacks. Nicholas Laboratories agreed to provide aspirin tablets, and Elwood enlisted heart attack survivors in a double-blind controlled studyâ€”heart attack survivors were statistically {{more likely to suffer}} a second attack, greatly reducing the number of patients necessary to reliably detect whether aspirin had an effect on heart attacks. The study began in February 1971, though the researchers soon had to break the double-blinding when a study by American epidemiologist Hershel Jick suggested that aspirin prevented heart attacks but suggested that the heart attacks were more deadly. Jick had found that fewer aspirin-takers were admitted to his hospital for heart attacks than non-aspirin-takers, and one possible explanation was that aspirin caused heart attack sufferers to die before reaching the hospital; Elwood's initial results ruled out that explanation. When the Elwood trial ended in 1973, it showed a modest but not statistically significant reduction in heart attacks among the group taking aspirin.|$|E

40|$|In the UK Hodgkin's {{disease is}} usually treated by either {{clinical}} oncologists or <b>haematologists.</b> A national {{study of the}} performance of bone marrow examination in newly diagnosed Hodgkin's disease was undertaken to establish current practice. A total of 620 questionnaires were despatched, and replies were received from 60 % of consultants (45 % of clinical oncologists and 70 % of <b>haematologists).</b> Bone marrow examination was performed in all new cases significantly more often by <b>haematologists</b> than by clinical oncologists (74 % vs 40 %, P < 0. 001). Among <b>haematologists,</b> there was no correlation between the number of new patients seen annually and practice, however clinical oncologists were even less likely to perform routine bone marrow biopsies if they saw more than ten patients per year (P < 0. 02). Where bone marrow examination was performed selectively, the most common criteria used were peripheral blood cytopenia and advanced-stage disease. These criteria were applied in the same way by both clinical oncologists and <b>haematologists.</b> Bone marrow biopsy, an invasive and often painful procedure, is currently performed more frequently in Hodgkin's disease than can be recommended on the basis of recent studies in the literature and associated guidelines. There is a significant difference in practice between clinical oncologists and <b>haematologists,</b> and this raises the wider issue of the influence of hospital specialisation on patient management...|$|R

Authoritative guidance states that men whose fertility may be affected by impending therapies should be offered sperm banking.

40|$|Since the {{introduction}} of novel therapeutic agents including thalidomide, lenalidomide and bortezomib, the prognosis of multiple myeloma (MM) has significantly improved. These agents have been incorporated into numerous treatment schedules for newly diagnosed {{as well as more}} advanced MM patients.

The multiple myeloma study group (MMSG) of the Belgian Hematological Society has established recommendations for the treatment of MM as based on an extensive review of the literature which is also summarized in this paper. The recommendations are the result of a consensus opinion between <b>haematologists</b> with experience in the field and representing most haematology centres in Belgium.

When alternative options are not available, treatment with ponatinib is indicated but requires that <b>haematologists</b> and cardiologists collaborate and identify modalities of surveillance and risk mitigation {{in the best interest of}} the patient.
