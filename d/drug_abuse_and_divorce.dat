40|$|This {{dissertation}} explores controversial {{themes in}} the youth literature of Barrie Hough. The novels under discussion are My kat word herfs (1986), Droomwa (1990), Vlerkdans (1992) and Skilpoppe (1998). My kat word herfs was translated as My cat turns Autumn, Droomwa as Dream Chariot and Vlerkdans as In full Flight. Afrikaans youth novels historically centered around naive themes such as the idyllic life on the farm or at boarding school. However, young people found {{it increasingly difficult to}} identify with these naive storylines and during the nineteen eighties and nineties the Afrikaans youth novel experienced a renewal. Barrie Hough was one of the pioneers, writing about controversial issues like aids, homosexuality, teenage sex, suicide, <b>drug</b> <b>abuse,</b> <b>divorce</b> <b>and</b> single parenthood. The aim of this dissertation is to explore the liberation of Afrikaans youth literature and the role that controversial themes play in this regard. These themes enable the reader to identify with the story and serve as an allurement to draw the reader into the world of the text. Furthermore, the writer is given the opportunity to experience a sense of liberation while he narratively confronts events of his past. This liberation process allows the writer to deal and come to terms with his own past. At the end of each novel both the reader and writer go through a process of purification and liberation, facilitated by the therapeutic process of writing or reading a story. Dr. M. P. Beuke...|$|R

40|$|Tanzania {{like many}} {{countries}} in the world is faced with upward trends in <b>drug</b> <b>abuse</b> <b>and</b> trafficking which have detrimental socio-economic, political and health consequences on our society. The incidence of <b>drug</b> <b>abuse</b> is on the increase amongst young people and school children and it becomes more apparent every year. Experience from working with drug users suggests that for many, unemployed, frustration, emotional problems, family problems and the general unfavorable living environment are but few key factors that encourage drug use and trafficking among young people. <b>Drug</b> <b>abuse</b> impairs judgment <b>and</b> may be associated with other risk taking behaviors of young people and as such preventable measures of both physical and mental incapacity are matters of the individuals and national concerns. Research findings show that primary school pupils were mainly involved in <b>drug</b> <b>abuse</b> <b>and</b> trafficking deals {{due to the fact that}} they are considered to be trustful naive and innocent. The victims in schools possess diverse characteristics such as truants, disobedient, cruel, poor performer in class, sleepy destructive dropouts, and provocative as well as argumentative. Also it was found out that drugs nowadays form an everyday part of lives of many young people in Tanzania. It is against this reality that the focus of the study is deliberately limited to the evaluation of the magnitude of <b>drug</b> <b>abuse</b> <b>and</b> trafficking among school children in Tanzania. The findings of the study will be used to develop prevention programmes in schools focusing on children's social and academic skills, including peer relationships, self control, coping and drug refusal skills. It is recommend in this research report that anti <b>drug</b> <b>abuse</b> <b>and</b> trafficking to be launched all over the country; the National Policy on <b>drug</b> <b>abuse</b> <b>and</b> trafficking should address the primary school children; teachers and finally it is recommended to introduce <b>drug</b> <b>abuse</b> <b>and</b> trafficking educational programmes in schools that should focus on children's social and academic skills. The programmes should also include enhancing peer relationships, self-control, coping and doing refusal skills. The challenge ahead of seeing to it that we build a health nation that is free of <b>drug</b> <b>abuse</b> <b>and</b> trafficking is truly staggering. Yet, as human beings, we cannot afford to fail.

40|$|Substance <b>abuse</b> <b>and</b> {{psychiatric}} disorders commonly occur together.

The spread of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) among drug users has added a third potential clinical problem, that of the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, to the difficulties already presented by <b>drug</b> <b>abuse</b> <b>and</b> psychiatric disorders. Patients with this triple diagnosis pose challenges to primary care physicians as well as addiction medicine specialists or psychiatrists. Assessment should include a <b>drug</b> <b>abuse</b> history, preferably corroborated by others, evaluation of the mental state, and examination focusing on signs of <b>drug</b> <b>abuse</b> <b>and</b> HIV infection.
