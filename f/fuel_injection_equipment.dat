25|$|Throughout the 1950s {{there was}} an {{increasing}} demand for a diesel-engined Land Rover. Diesel technology had improved, making small-capacity high-speed engines practical. Diesel power had also become prominent in industrial and agricultural uses throughout the world, and fleet users of Land Rovers were often in the situation where their Land Rovers were the only petrol-engined vehicles in their fleet, making spares, servicing and fuel supply more complex. The Rover Motor Company was in talks with Standard-Triumph in 1954, {{with the possibility of}} a merger. Standard were Britain's pioneers of road-going small diesel engines with the 20C engine fitted to Ferguson tractors and the Standard Vanguard car (Britain's first diesel car). Rover engineers were able to study Standard's diesel designs as part of these. The merger was called off, but Rover had gained vital experience and knowledge in developing small diesel engines. The result was a wet-liner 4-cylinder engine. <b>Fuel</b> <b>injection</b> <b>equipment</b> was from CAV, and the engine used Ricardo's Comet swirl chambers, but with Rover-developed dimples to produce quieter and smoother running. Heater plugs were fitted to each combustion chamber to improve starting. The engine was launched in the Land Rover in 1957. The vehicle had to have an extra 2inches let into the chassis in the engine bay to enable the new engine to fit. The engine's power output and speed range was close enough to the existing petrol engine to allow the same transmission unit to be used on all vehicles.|$|E

40|$|Effective fuel {{injector}} operation and efficient combustion {{are two of}} the most critical aspects when Diesel engine performance, efficiency and reliability are considered. Indeed, it is widely acknowledged that <b>fuel</b> <b>injection</b> <b>equipment</b> faults lead to increased fuel consumption, reduced power, greater levels of exhaust emissions and even unexpected engine failure. Previous investigations have identified {{fuel injector}} related acoustic emission activity as being caused by mechanisms such as fuel line pressure build-up; fuel flow through injector nozzles, injector needle opening and closing impacts and premixed combustion related pulses. Few of these investigations however, have attempted to categorise the close association and interrelation that exists between <b>fuel</b> <b>injection</b> <b>equipment</b> function and the acoustic emission generating mechanisms. Consequently, a significant amount of ambiguity remains in the interpretation and categorisation of injector related AE activity with respect to the functional characteristics of specific <b>fuel</b> <b>injection</b> <b>equipment.</b> The investigation presented addresses this ambiguity by detailing a study in which AE signals were recorded and analysed from two different Diesel engines employing the two commonly encountered yet fundamentally different types of <b>fuel</b> <b>injection</b> <b>equipment.</b> Results from tests in which faults were induced into fuel injector nozzles from both indirect-injection and direct-injection engines show that functional differences between the main types of <b>fuel</b> <b>injection</b> <b>equipment</b> results in acoustic emission activity which can be specifically related to the type of <b>fuel</b> <b>injection</b> <b>equipment</b> used...|$|E
40|$|The ever {{increasing}} demands on Diesel engines for increased efficiency and reduced smoke emissions and noise have {{given rise to}} more stringent requirements for the associated <b>fuel</b> <b>injection</b> <b>equipment</b> and greater emphasis on the understanding of the factors affecting its performance and the optimisation of its design. This work describes how the simulation of the complex phenomena arising in transient high pressure wave flows in diesel <b>fuel</b> <b>injection</b> <b>equipment</b> has been carried out, using a digital computer. Previous published research in producing <b>fuel</b> <b>injection</b> <b>equipment</b> models relied on producing simplified subsets of generalised differential equations, but in this work an alternative approach, which makes use of the increased powers of modern computers has been adopted. The model is built up of a series of small elements, and the equations derived by considering the significant forces acting on each element. The emphasis in the work was to write a usable and useful suite of programs which can be, and have been, used in design and development work on a variety of systems, large and small, inline and rotary. The model has been verified by comparison with about a hundred experiments using different systems and conditions, and agrees within the limits of experimental error. Examples of the use of the program show how design criteria may be established, how transient phenomena during the pumping cycle may be examined in detail, and how factors such as fuel spray drop size and velocity may be evaluated. They also show how, {{as a result of a}} deeper understanding of fuel injection phenomena, a recurrent problem, the occurrence of secondary injections, was attacked and a novel and effective solution found...|$|E
