There {{was no mention of}} this house, which was the {{original}} house of the family, the first Lord having built the Great House; and both my father and Sir Jovian were sure the Lord Delavie believed it would come to him; but no proofs were extant, and my Lady would only consent to his occupying it, as before, as her agent." ...|$|R
50|$|On April 15, 1998, longtime-owner of Bridgeport Broadcasting Company, the {{licensee}} {{for this}} station, {{then known as}} WBTS, Roy C. McCloud died. In June 1998, {{control of the company}} passed involuntarily to Remal J. McCloud and Darren W. McCloud, the <b>joint</b> <b>executors</b> of his estate. The Federal Communications Commission approved the transfer on July 9, 1998, and the transaction was formally consummated on August 10, 1998. Later that year in Atlanta, Georgia, they used the WBTS callsign until August 2010.|$|R
5000|$|John Lane (1808-1873) {{owned and}} ran the Wenlock Brewery from 1840 until his death, {{initially}} as [...] "Lane & Bowden" [...] (the 1842 Post Office Directory mentions “LANE & BOWDEN, Ale Brewers, 9 Wenlock Road”). John's brother-in-law, John Mitchell (1813-1868), was brewery foreman in 1851 (mentioned in the census). Various {{other members of the}} Mitchell family worked at the brewery from time to time. These included John Mitchell's older brother Thomas (mentioned in the census as being foreman at the brewery in 1871), another John Mitchell (a cousin; c. 1820-1849), as well as at least three of John Lane's brothers. Yet another John Mitchell, John Hoffe Mitchell, was <b>joint</b> <b>executor</b> of John Lane's will.|$|R
60|$|Immediately {{after the}} funeral the will was opened, and Dr Thorne {{discovered}} that the clauses of it were exactly identical with those which his friend had described to him some months back. Nothing had been altered; nor had the document been unfolded since that strange codicil was added, {{in which it was}} declared that Dr Thorne knew--and only Dr Thorne--who was the eldest child of the testator's only sister. At the same time, however, a <b>joint</b> <b>executor</b> with Dr Thorne had been named--one Mr Stock, a man of railway fame--and Dr Thorne himself was made a legatee to the humble extent of a thousand pounds. A life income of a thousand pounds a year was left to Lady Scatcherd.|$|R
60|$|Mr Apjohn {{had told}} her that she could not now leave the place on the Wednesday as she had intended. On the Wednesday he again came to Llanfeare, and then she saw him before he {{proceeded}} to his business. It was his intention now to read the last will which had been found, and to explain to those who heard it that he proposed, as <b>joint</b> <b>executor</b> with Dr Powell, to act upon that as the last will;--but still with a proviso that another will might possibly be forthcoming. Though he had in a measure quarrelled with the Squire over the making of that will, nevertheless, he had been appointed in it as the executor, such having been the case in the wills previously made. All this he explained to her up in her room, assenting to her objection to be again present when the will should be read.|$|R
50|$|In 1723 {{the warm}} {{friendship}} between Jonathan Swift and Esther Vanhomrigh, {{for whom he}} created the name Vanessa, ended in a violent quarrel about another woman whom he had loved for many years, Esther Johnson (Stella); Swift may secretly have married Stella in 1716. The quarrel arose when Vanessa asked Swift not to see Stella again, and he refused. Vanessa, who was seriously ill with tuberculosis and died a few months later, revoked the will she had made in Swift's favour and made a new will, dividing her estate between Marshall and George Berkeley, later to be celebrated as a philosopher and Bishop of Cloyne, and appointing them as her <b>joint</b> <b>executors.</b> Her choice of legatee is surprising since {{it does not seem}} that she knew either man well. In the event much of the estate was dissipated in a lawsuit. There is a tradition that Marshall and Berkeley disobeyed a provision in the will that they publish all of Swift's correspondence with Vanessa, but in fact no such provision seems to have existed; Marshall did preserve copies of the correspondence.|$|R
5000|$|Self-appointed monarchs of Redonda include Marvin Kitman and William Scott Home. Scott Home's {{claim to}} the title was, he says, based on ESP and reincarnation. [...] M.P. Shiel’s granddaughter, Lancashire {{housewife}} Mrs Margaret Parry, {{came to the fore}} in 1993 and was hailed as “Queen Maggie” of Redonda by various newspapers, including the Daily Mail. Publisher, author and environmentalist Jon Wynne-Tyson, however, claims that Gawsworth, prior to dying in 1970, bestowed the kingship on him with the literary executorships, although the writer Iain Fletcher was the <b>joint</b> literary <b>executor</b> for Gawsworth.|$|R
50|$|John Sterling was a {{colleague}} {{and friend of}} Carlyle, but achieved far less success as a writer. They met when Carlyle was forty, and Sterling thirty. Their friendship, which lasted for the remaining years of Sterling's short life, was carried on {{for the most part}} through letters. When Sterling died in 1844, Carlyle and Archdeacon Hare were appointed as <b>joint</b> literary <b>executors</b> of Sterling’s work - two volumes of poetry. Hare produced obituary of Sterling but, some years later, Carlyle wrote his biography, in part at least, to counter what he considered a poor biographical memoir by Hare.|$|R
5000|$|Her {{demands for}} a public {{investigation}} into her husband's death did not endear Zenzl Mühsam to the Nazi authorities, {{and when she was}} warned by the American journalist, Dorothy Thompson, that she was about to be arrested by the Gestapo, on 15 July 1934 she crossed the border into Czechoslovakia. [...] She was accompanied by her nephew, Joseph Elfinger, whose father had recently been sent to the Dachau concentration camp. [...] In September 1934, {{with the help of a}} book dealer called Fritz Picard and Camill Hofmann, the Czechoslovak press attaché, she managed to smuggle her dead husband's papers into Prague as [...] "diplomatic baggage". By this time she had already been able to report on the German Concentration Camps in front of international journalists, though it is not clear whether this attracted much notice. Erich Mühsam's will had also been published, appointing Rudolf Rocker as <b>joint</b> literary <b>executor</b> in collaboration with Zenzl. [...] In January 1935 she published [...] "The Ordeal of Erich Mühsam". Back in Germany the government responded by removing her German citizenship.|$|R
60|$|The little girl, {{whose face}} had peered {{for a moment}} under the blinds as the chaise came up, opened the door from the stairs into the hall, and taking Arthur's hand silently as he stooped down to kiss her, led him upstairs to his mother. Old John opened the dining-room door for the Major. The room was darkened with the blinds down, and {{surrounded}} by all the gloomy pictures of the Pendennises. He drank a glass of wine. The bottle had been opened for the Squire four days before. His hat was brushed, and laid on the hall table: his newspapers, and his letter-bag, with John Pendennis, Esquire, Fairoaks, engraved upon the brass plate, were there in waiting. The doctor and the lawyer from Clavering, who had seen the chaise pass through, came up in a gig half {{an hour after the}} Major's arrival, and entered by the back door. The former gave a detailed account of the seizure and demise of Mr. Pendennis, enlarged on his virtues and the estimation in which the neighbourhood held him; on what a loss he would be to the magistrates' bench, the County Hospital, etc. Mrs. Pendennis bore up wonderfully, he said, especially since Master Arthur's arrival. The lawyer stayed and dined with Major Pendennis, and they talked business all the evening. The Major was his brother's <b>executor,</b> and <b>joint</b> guardian to the boy with Mrs. Pendennis. Everything was left unreservedly to her, except in case of a second marriage,--an occasion which might offer itself in the case of so young and handsome a woman, Mr. Tatham gallantly said, when different provisions were enacted by the deceased. The Major would of course take entire superintendence of everything under this most impressive and melancholy occasion. Aware of this authority, old John the footman, when he brought Major Pendennis the candle to go to bed, followed afterwards with the plate-basket; and the next morning brought him the key of the hall clock--the Squire always used to wind it up of a Thursday, John said. Mrs. Pendennis's maid brought him messages from her mistress. She confirmed the doctor's report, of the comfort which Master Arthur's arrival had caused to his mother.|$|R
