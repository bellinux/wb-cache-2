The pulse therefore becomes positively chirped, or up-chirped, increasing in frequency with time.

High order homogenization is carried out to derive a <b>dispersive</b> effective <b>medium</b> approximation. One-dimensional materials with constant impedance exhibit no effective dispersion.

This dispersion is a macroscopic effect of microscopic diffraction caused by spatial variation in the sound speed. We analyze this dispersive effect by using highorder homogenization to derive an anisotropic, <b>dispersive</b> effective <b>medium.</b> We generalize to two dimensions a homogenization approach that has been used previously for one-dimensional problems.

40|$|Abstract—A {{dispersive}} conformal FDTD {{method has}} been proposed to accurately model the interface between two adjacent <b>dispersive</b> <b>mediums</b> and implemented to study the scattering of THz electromag-netic (EM) waves by inhomogeneous collisional plasma cylinder array.

Numerical results show that the proposed method enhances the accuracy level compared to the staircasing FDTD scheme involved in the inhomoge-neous plasma. It is interesting to find that the THz EM waves can propagate through the plasma array more easily with higher frequen-cies or larger separations, hence the scattering width in the backward direction becomes smaller, and the forward scattering exhibits a little different. This study will be useful for further designing intelligent plasma antenna arrays in the THz band and terahertz reentry teleme-try through plasma. 1...|$|R
50|$|An optical {{front-end}} {{is commonly}} used to accomplish this process of time-stretch. An ultrashort optical pulse (typically 100 to 200 femtoseconds long), also called a supercontinuum pulse, which has a broad optical bandwidth, is time-stretched by dispersing it in a highly <b>dispersive</b> <b>medium</b> (such as a dispersion compensating fiber). This process results in (an almost) linear time-to-wavelength mapping in the stretched pulse, because different wavelengths travel at different speeds in the <b>dispersive</b> <b>medium.</b> The obtained pulse is called a chirped pulse as its frequency is changing with time, and it is typically a few nanoseconds long. The analog signal is modulated onto this chirped pulse using an electro-optic intensity modulator. Subsequently, the modulated pulse is stretched further in the second <b>dispersive</b> <b>medium</b> which has much higher dispersion value. Finally, this obtained optical pulse is converted to electrical domain by a photodetector, giving the stretched replica of the original analog signal.|$|E

EM wave marching is realized through the relationships of magnetic field versus electric flux and electric field versus magnetic flux. For the reason that medium properties are expressed separately, this method can avoid major modifications of core updating equations if the studied medium properties change.

40|$|A {{measure of}} the {{absorption}} of elastic waves is the specific absorption coefficient 1 /Q. In <b>dispersive</b> <b>mediums,</b> whether the dispersion is due to geometry, inhomogeneity, or both, measurements are often made outside {{the body and the}} measurements must be interpreted as to the distribution of values of 1 /Q within the body. Two definitive experiments of this type are those performed using standing waves set up in a confined sample of the body and with waves that propagate through or {{on the surface of the}} body. Typical examples of these experiments involve the measurement of the damping coefficient of the free modes of vibration of the earth and the measurement of the attenuation factor of propagating surface waves on the earth. These two types of experiments can themselves be interpreted in terms of dimensionless attenuation factors. We call the dimensionless attenuation factors in the standing wave and propagating wave experiments 1 /Q_T and 1 /Q_x, defined as the logarithmic decrements π/QT and π/Q_x in each experiment. Then in a damped standing wave the amplitude will diminish with time t at a fixed point as exp (−πt/TQ_T), where T is the period. In a propagating monochromatic wave the amplitude will diminish with distance x as exp (−πx/cTQ_x), where c is the phase velocity...|$|R
