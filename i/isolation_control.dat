According to the {{situation}} that the transistor output interface type of PLC output current {{is too small to}} meet requirements of high-speed, frequently on or off electromagnetic valve and other great current load drives, a current driver amplifier was developed which connected PLC output interface and load.

50|$|Isolation {{cells are}} used to prevent short circuit current. As the name suggests, these cells isolate the power gated block from the normally-On block. Isolation cells are {{specially}} designed for low short circuit current when input is at threshold voltage level. <b>Isolation</b> <b>control</b> signals are provided by the power gating controller. Isolation of the signals of a switchable module is essential to preserve design integrity. Usually a simple OR or AND logic can function as an output isolation device. Multiple state retention schemes are available in practice to preserve the state before a module shuts down. The simplest technique is to scan out the register values into a memory before shutting down a module. When the module wakes up, the values are scanned back from the memory.|$|E
