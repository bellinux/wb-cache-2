5|$|In humans, other mammals, and birds, the <b>heart</b> <b>is</b> {{divided into}} four chambers: upper left and right atria; and lower left and right {{ventricle}}s. Commonly the right atrium and ventricle are referred together as the right heart and their left counterparts as the left heart. Fish, in contrast, have two chambers, an atrium and a ventricle, while reptiles have three chambers. In a healthy heart blood flows one way through the heart due to heart valves, which prevent backflow. The <b>heart</b> <b>is</b> enclosed in a protective sac, the pericardium, which also contains {{a small amount of}} fluid. The wall of the <b>heart</b> <b>is</b> made up of three layers: epicardium, myocardium, and endocardium.|$|E

5000|$|A {{subset of}} the primary tumors of the <b>heart</b> <b>are</b> tumors that are found on the valves of the heart. Tumors that affect the valves of the <b>heart</b> <b>are</b> found in an equal {{distribution}} among the four heart valves. [...] The vast majority of these are papillary fibroelastomas. Primary tumors of the valves of the <b>heart</b> <b>are</b> {{more likely to occur}} in males. While most primary tumors of the valves of the <b>heart</b> <b>are</b> not malignant, {{they are more likely to}} have symptoms related to the valve, including neurologic symptoms and (in a few cases) sudden cardiac death.|$|R

5|$|The <b>heart</b> <b>is</b> {{a muscular}} organ in most animals, which pumps blood through {{the blood vessels}} of the circulatory system. Blood {{provides}} the body with oxygen and nutrients, as well as assists in the removal of metabolic wastes. In humans, the <b>heart</b> <b>is</b> located between the lungs, in the middle compartment of the chest.|$|E
5|$|The <b>heart</b> <b>is</b> cone-shaped, {{with its}} base {{positioned}} upwards and tapering {{down to the}} apex. An adult heart has a mass of 250–350 grams (9–12oz). The <b>heart</b> <b>is</b> typically {{the size of a}} fist: 12cm (5in) in length, 8cm (3.5in) wide, and 6cm (2.5in) in thickness. Well-trained athletes can have much larger hearts due to the effects of exercise on the heart muscle, similar to the response of skeletal muscle.|$|E

5|$|Like other insects, beetles have open circulatory systems, {{based on}} {{hemolymph}} rather than blood. As in other insects, a segmented tube-like <b>heart</b> <b>is</b> {{attached to the}} dorsal wall of the hemocoel.

5|$|Octopuses have {{a closed}} circulatory system, where the blood remains inside blood vessels. Octopuses have three hearts; a {{systemic}} heart that circulates blood round {{the body and}} two branchial hearts that pump it through {{each of the two}} gills.

40|$|BACKGROUND Coronary arteries supply oxygen rich {{blood to}} entire heart muscle. They divide and their {{branches}} encircle {{the heart to}} cover its surface with a lacy network resembling a crown. The artery supplying the Posterior Descending artery (PDA) determines the coronary dominance. A right dominant coronary circulation {{is one in which}} the PDA is a terminal branch of Right Coronary Artery (RCA) and in left dominance, PDA arises from left coronary artery. Left dominant <b>hearts</b> <b>are</b> at an increased risk of coronary heart diseases. Therefore, the present study aims at studying the coronary dominance in hearts obtained from adult and perinatal cadavers. MATERIALS AND METHODS 50 human cadaveric <b>hearts</b> <b>were</b> collected and meticulously dissected. All the results were noted and photographs taken. This study was carried out in the Department of Anatomy of Tezpur Medical College, Sonitpur, Assam, on 50 heart specimens. Out of 50 <b>hearts,</b> 20 <b>hearts</b> <b>were</b> from perinatal cadavers that is between 28 th weeks of gestation to 7 days after birth and the remaining 30 <b>hearts</b> <b>were</b> from adult cadavers. Out of the total <b>hearts,</b> 31 <b>hearts</b> <b>were</b> male and 19 <b>hearts</b> <b>were</b> female. The perinatal <b>heart</b> specimens <b>were</b> collected from the Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology. The adult <b>hearts</b> <b>were</b> collected from the cadavers received in the Department of Anatomy and also from the unclaimed bodies received in the Department of Forensic Medicine, Tezpur Medical College and Hospital.
