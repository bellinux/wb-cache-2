However, the tendency in the past to not pay essential attention to the need to validate or corroborate the age estimation in some stocks has led to misunderstanding of their dynamics. Thus, the Atlantic black anglerfish stocks have not been annually assessed using age-structured models during the last years in ICES working groups due to problems with the data quality, including those coming from a biased illicia age <b>estimation</b> <b>criterion.</b> The same age <b>estimation</b> <b>criterion</b> is used for the Mediterranean black anglerfish.

Its application fields range from mapping of complex disease genes to inferring population histories, passing through designing drugs, functional genomics and pharmacogenetics.

40|$|The <b>estimation</b> <b>criteria</b> {{for solving}} {{parameters}} in zero-differenced GPS positioning is that observations obey Gaussian white noise distribution. But {{a number of}} pioneering studies {{point out that the}} white noise would be damaged by satellites errors, propagation errors, station environment errors and so on. Meanwhile, un-modeling errors also have adverse effects. These errors not only undermine the assumption <b>estimation</b> <b>criteria,</b> and some non-white noises are likely to be absorbed by state parameters. In result, the accuracy of estimates is influenced. This paper regards white noise, colored noise and un-modeling errors as ZD stochastic model of GPS. Then the Allan variance method is proposed to analyze the posteriori residuals which can represent the Stochastic characteristics of GPS data. Noise component and parameters are mainly investigated. The result shows GPS noise behaves as WN plus GM. The phase and pseudorange WN is 2. 392 mm and 0. 936 m respectively, GM process noise is 4. 450 mm/√s and 0. 833 m/√s respectively, correlation time is 52. 074 s and 14. 737 s respectively.
