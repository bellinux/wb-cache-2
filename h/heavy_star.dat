40|$|Mass {{segregation}} plays a {{key role}} in the evolution of self-gravitating systems. Due to a process of dynamical friction, i. e. a loss of the kinetic energy of <b>heavier</b> <b>stars</b> due to the interaction with many lighter <b>stars,</b> <b>heavier</b> <b>stars</b> concentrate in cores of star clusters. In this work we derive analytical estimate of the rate of this process. Because of its complexity we try to nd our estimate by studying stars on radial and circular orbits. We compare our results with outputs of numerical models.

50|$|There are {{two main}} {{neutrino}} driven kick scenarios, relying on the parity violation of neutrino interactions to explain an asymmetry in neutrino distribution. The first uses {{the fact that in}} the presence of a magnetic field, the direction that a neutrino is scattered off a nucleus is biased in some direction. So if neutrino emission happened in the presence of a strong magnetic field, we might expect the average neutrino drift to align in some way with that field, and thus the resulting explosion would be asymmetric. A main problem with this theory is that to have sufficient asymmetry the theory requires fields of order 1015 G, much stronger than is expected in a <b>heavy</b> <b>star.</b> Another neutrino based theory uses the fact that the cross section for neutrino scattering depends weakly on the strength of the ambient magnetic field. Thus, if the magnetic field is itself anisotropic, then there could be dark spots which are essentially opaque to neutrinos. This however requires anisotropies of order 1016 G, which is even more unlikely.|$|E
5000|$|The {{film was}} in {{production}} starting in late 2004 and {{during most of}} 2005, before its official release at the Roving Eye Documentary Film Festival in 2006. The Distance won the Roving Eye festival, thanks to in part of the movie's star power and the attention it received while in production. This does not {{take away from the}} fact that it was the raw, gripping emotion of Adams' storytelling that earned The Distance its merit; his raised profile as a filmmaker caused the film to be picked up by the Ohio Independent Film Festival not long after. In Ohio, The Distance continued to be the darling of audiences and critics alike, and received a second nomination for Best Documentary. During this stage of its run, Julie Washington of The Plain Dealer called The Distance [...] "heartbreaking and unforgettable". The momentum built up from its nominations and win, combined with the <b>heavy</b> <b>star</b> power and critical buzz within the industry it was receiving, allowed The Distance to then travel abroad and compete internationally. Later in 2006, it was screened at the Montreal World Film Festival, the John Huston Puerto Vallarta Film Festival and at the Rhode Island International Film Festival. The Distance became Adams' first widespread success, and such a distinction was topped off when Image Entertainment acquired the film for mass distribution. It was released on DVD in late 2006.|$|E

In this work the total β-decay half-lives and the unique first-forbidden(U 1 F) β-decay rates for a number of neutron-rich nickel isotopes, ^ 72 - 78 Ni, are calculated using the proton-neutron quasi-particle random phase approximation (pn-QRPA) theory in stellar environment for the first time. For the calculation of the β-decay half-lives both allowed and unique first-forbidden transitions were considered. Comparison of the total half-lives is made with measurements and other theoretical calculations where {{it was found that the}} pn-QRPA results are in better agreement with experiments and at the same time are suggestive of inclusion of rank 0 and rank 1 operators in first-forbidden rates for still better results.

40|$|We {{investigated}} {{the evolution of}} a massive galactic nucleus hosting a super-massive black hole (SMBH) with mass M_SMBH= 10 ^ 8 M_ surrounded by a population of 42 <b>heavy</b> <b>star</b> clusters (GCs). Using direct N-body modelling, we show here that the assembly of an NSC through GCs orbital decay and merger is efficiently inhibited by the tidal forces exerted from the SMBH. The GCs mass loss induced by tidal forces causes a significant modification of their mass function, leading to a population of low-mass (< 10 ^ 4) clusters. Nonetheless, the GCs debris accumulated around the SMBH give rise to well-defined kinematical and morphological properties, leading to the formation of a disk-like structure. Interestingly, the disk is similar to the one observed in the M 31 galaxy nucleus, which has properties similar to our numerical model. The simulation produced a huge amount of data, which we used to investigate whether the GC debris deposited around the SMBH can enhance the rate of tidal disruption events (TDEs) in our galaxy inner density distribution. Our results suggest that the GCs disruption shapes the SMBH neighbourhoods leading to a TDE rate of ∼ 2 × 10 ^- 4 yr^- 1, a value slightly larger than what expected in previous theoretical modelling of galaxies with similar density profiles and central SMBHs. The simulation presented here is the first of its kind, representing a massive galactic nucleus and its star cluster population on scales ∼ 100 pc. Comment: 15 pages, 10 figures, 4 tables.

40|$|We {{show that}} the mass-segregation {{solution}} for the steady state distribution of stars around a massive black hole (MBH) has two branches: the known weak segregation solution (Bahcall & Wolf 1977), and a newly discovered strong segregation solution, presented here. The nature of the solution depends on the heavy-to-light stellar mass ratio M_H/M_L and on the unbound population number ratio N_H/N_L, through the relaxational coupling parameter Δ= 4 N_H M_H^ 2 /[N_L M_L^ 2 (3 +M_H/M_L) ]. When the <b>heavy</b> <b>stars</b> are relatively common (Δ>> 1), they scatter frequently on each other. This efficient self-coupling leads to weak mass segregation, where the stars form n ∝ r^-α_M mass-dependent cusps near the MBH, with indices α_H= 7 / 4 for the <b>heavy</b> <b>stars</b> and 3 / 2 <α_L< 7 / 4 for the light stars (i. e. (α_H-α_L) = 1 / 4). However, when the <b>heavy</b> <b>stars</b> are relatively rare (Δ<< 1), they scatter mostly on light stars, sink to the center by dynamical friction and settle into a much steeper cusp with 2 <α_H< 11 / 4, while the light stars form a 3 / 2 <α_L< 7 / 4 cusp, resulting in strong segregation (i. e. (α_H-α_L) = 1). We {{show that the}} present-day mass function of evolved stellar populations (coeval or continuously star forming) with a universal initial mass function, separate into two distinct mass scales, 1 Mo of main sequence and compact dwarfs, and 10 Mo of stellar black holes (SBHs), and have Δ< 0. 1. We conclude that {{it is likely that}} many relaxed galactic nuclei are strongly segregated. We review indications of strong segregation in observations of the Galactic Center and in results of numeric simulations, and briefly list some possible implications of a very high central concentration of SBHs around a MBH.

At the end of week 7 five M and five F birds selected from each group were slaughtered and their carcasses dissected.

The lowest feed consumption up to the end of week 7 of life was found in CaA 15 while the most desirable feed conversion ratio in males and females Star 63 broilers. The highest slaughter body weight and highest dressing percentage were both found in Star 63 (both sexes), while the lowest body weight was found in both sexes of Dworka broilers.
