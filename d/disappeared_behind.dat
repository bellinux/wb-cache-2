5|$|This {{particular}} disclosure {{has given}} rise to speculation as to whether, in addition to his efforts to rescue the Hungarian Jews, Wallenberg may have also been pursuing a parallel clandestine mission aimed at politically destabilizing Hungary’s pro-Nazi government on behalf of the OSS. This would also seem to add some credence to the potential explanation that it was his association with US intelligence that led to Wallenberg being targeted by Soviet authorities in January 1945. Several other humanitarians who had helped refugees during World War II <b>disappeared</b> <b>behind</b> the Iron Curtain in the period 1949/50, several years after Wallenberg’s disappearance. OSS ties may have been of interest to the Soviets, but are not a complete explanation because some of those detained, i.e. Hermann Field and Herta Field, had not worked for the OSS. All of these humanitarians, however, like Wallenberg, had interacted with a large number of anti-fascist and socialist refugees during the War, and this experience was used in the Stalin regime’s factional politics and show trials.|$|E

When she was half a mile away, Baralong ran up a signal flag indicating {{that she was going}} to rescue Nicosians crew. Wegener acknowledged the signal, then ordered his men to cease firing, and took U-27 along the port side of Nicosian to intercept Baralong. As the submarine <b>disappeared</b> <b>behind</b> the steamship, Herbert steered Baralong on a parallel course along Nicosians starboard side.|$|E
25|$|In 1986, Messner {{returned}} and succeeded in reaching the summit using the normal route with Kammerlander and Mutschlechner. Although they had turned back twice during this expedition, {{they made the}} summit on the third attempt on 26 September. During this expedition, Messner witnessed the death of Marcel Rüedi, for whom the Makalu was his 9th eight-thousander. Rüedi {{was on the way}} back from the summit and was seen by Messner and the other climbers on the descent. Although he was making slow progress, he appeared to be safe. The tea for his reception had already been boiled when Rüedi <b>disappeared</b> <b>behind</b> a snow ridge and did not reappear. He was found dead a short time later.|$|E

500|$|In {{the fourth}} century BCE, Aristotle noted that Mars <b>disappeared</b> <b>behind</b> the Moon during an occultation, {{indicating}} that the planet was farther away. Ptolemy, a Greek living in Alexandria, attempted {{to address the problem}} of the orbital motion of Mars. Ptolemy's model and his collective work on astronomy was presented in the multi-volume collection Almagest, which became the authoritative treatise on Western astronomy for the next fourteen centuries. Literature from ancient China confirms that Mars was known by Chinese astronomers by no later than {{the fourth century}} BCE. In the fifth century CE, the Indian astronomical text Surya Siddhanta estimated the diameter of Mars. In the East Asian cultures, Mars is traditionally referred to as the [...] "fire star" [...] (...) , based on the Five elements.|$|E
500|$|The {{song was}} {{performed}} {{as part of}} Madonna's 1985 Virgin Tour; it was the fifth song of the setlist. Madonna wore a blue see-through crop-top, revealing her characteristic black bra. She also had lacy leggings and crucifixes around an ear and her neck. As she finished the vigorous performance of [...] "Everybody", the lights were dimmed and the introduction music of the song started. Rotating lights fell on the stage. Madonna appeared {{sitting on top of}} the stairs and gradually descended. During the intermediate bridge, she and her dancers moved energetically around the whole stage, as white balloons fell on them from above. Madonna continued singing as the lights were dimmed again. She finished the performance and <b>disappeared</b> <b>behind</b> the wings for a costume change. [...] "Angel" [...] did not appear in the final home video release [...]|$|E

500|$|A {{few moments}} after {{beginning}} the display, and while still ascending, the balloon {{was seen to}} be in flames. Some reports say that the balloon momentarily <b>disappeared</b> <b>behind</b> a cloud and that when it reappeared it was on fire—whatever the circumstances, the gas in the balloon was burning. Blanchard began to descend rapidly, but the balloon, caught in the wind, continued to move off from the pleasure gardens even as it went down. Some spectators thought these events {{were part of the}} show and applauded and shouted their approval. The balloon had not risen very high and, although the escaping gas was burning, the gas within the balloon maintained sufficient lift for a while to prevent the craft plummeting directly to the ground. By rapidly shedding ballast Blanchard was able to slow the descent. Most reports say she appeared to be calm during the descent, but she was said to be wringing her hands in despair as the craft approached the ground. Rumours later circulated that she had gripped the chair of her craft so tightly that [...] "several arteries had snapt through the effort." ...|$|E
500|$|In the Sticky & Sweet Tour, [...] "Give It 2 Me" [...] was {{performed}} as the closing {{song of the}} [...] "Futuristic rave with Japanese influence" [...] section. During the last segment of the show, Madonna wore a futuristic robotic dress with plates on her shoulder and a wig with long curled hair. She opened the breastplate from the previous performance, and started singing [...] "Give It 2 Me". Parts of the lyrics of the song flashed on the screens {{in the style of}} a shooter video game, featuring 1980s games like Space Invaders and Asteroids. Gradually, more and more dancers joined Madonna, and together they started jumping on stage. Williams appeared on the screens to sing his lines. He made a special guest appearance, for the performances of [...] "Give It 2 Me", at the Madison Square Garden stop of the tour. Near the end of the performance, Madonna asked the crowd to sing along with her while she shouted, [...] "No one is ever going to stop me". The performance ended with video backdrops showing Madonna's sweaty, unsmiling, exhausted face, as she <b>disappeared</b> <b>behind</b> the reformed cubicle-shaped screens, which showed the words, 'Game Over', and [...] "Holiday" [...] started playing in the background.|$|E
500|$|The {{first study}} showed infants a toy car that moved down an {{inclined}} track, <b>disappeared</b> <b>behind</b> a screen, and then reemerged {{at the other}} end, still on the track. The researchers created a [...] "possible event" [...] where a toy mouse was placed behind the tracks but was hidden by the screen as the car rolled by. Then, researchers created an [...] "impossible event." [...] In this situation, the toy mouse {{was placed on the}} tracks but was secretly removed after the screen was lowered so that the car seemed to go through the mouse. [...] Also in the 1991 study the researchers used an experiment involving two differently sized carrots (one tall and one short) in order to test the infants response when the carrots would be moved behind a short wall. [...] The wall was specifically designed to make the short carrot disappear, as well as tested the infants for habituation patterns on the disappearance of the tall carrot behind the wall (impossible event). Infants as young as 3½ months displayed greater stimulation toward the impossible event and much more habituation at the possible event. This indicated that they may have been surprised by the impossible event, which suggested they remembered not only that the toy mouse still existed (object permanence) but also its location. The same was true of the tall carrot in the second experiment. [...] This research suggests that infants understand more about objects earlier than Piaget proposed.|$|E

500|$|Usher held {{multiple}} private listening {{sessions for}} Looking 4 Myself. On April 27, 2012 he debuted the album in the off-broadway show Fuerza Bruta: Look Up, in Daryl Roth Theater in New York City. When speaking to MTV, he explained his reasoning for performing {{in the show}} [...] "It's not often that you're able to give somewhat of a visual or an emotional kind of basis of what your songs mean [...] I felt like, yeah, {{it would be a}} physical challenge, yeah {{it would be a lot}} for me, but [...] at least try it, there are many times I'd seen the show and I'd only hoped that I would make it happen". Steven Horowitz of Rolling Stone commented that Usher [...] "theatrically sequenced the entirety of the project to strobing lights and choreographed moves". Horowitz also praised the singer's performance, concluding that [...] "the veteran entertainer reasserts himself as a master of rapturous dance fodder, capable of turning a room into a thumping rave with ease". Usher appeared on Saturday Night Live—hosted by Will Ferrell—where he performed the singles [...] "Scream" [...] and [...] "Climax". He performed both singles again, in the 2012 Today summer concert, being the opening act of the series. Usher performed [...] "Scream" [...] in the 2012 Billboard Music Awards; during the performance he wore a black suit, bowler hat and bow tie while dancing with a masked female, who later <b>disappeared</b> <b>behind</b> a cape and was replaced by a male dancer who mirrored Usher's dance routines.|$|E
500|$|The show {{opened with}} Beastie Boys {{performing}} six of their songs for 30 minutes. They {{were accompanied by}} their DJ, Rick Rubin, who scratched the music, with The Beastie Boys prancing around the stage, making lewd gestures towards the audience. As they finished their performance, the backdrops started displaying Madonna's images from her music videos. The band—consisting of guitarists, bassists, a drummer and three synthesizer players—came into focus, and the music started. Madonna's voice was heard, saying: [...] "Don't be afraid... it's gonna be alright." [...] Then, Madonna's silhouette appeared behind a white screen {{on top of the}} stairs as the first beats kicked in. The white screen lifted and she is finally seen, wearing a psychedelic housecoat, a blue see-through crop-top and her characteristic black bra. She also had lacy leggings and crucifixes around her ear and her neck. She posed on the stairs before reaching the microphone to sing [...] "Dress You Up". After dancing to the last note of the music, Madonna and the two male back-up dancers went {{to the back of the}} stage, as the music of [...] "Holiday" [...] began. Taking a moment to ask the audience how they are feeling, Madonna declared, [...] "I was never elected homecoming queen, but I sure feel like one now", and started the performance of [...] "Into the Groove", playing a tambourine. A boombox was present on the stage during the performance, Madonna sitting and playing with it, and addressing it as her [...] "box". She continued with [...] "Everybody", while asking the audience to clap along with her. As she finished the vigorous performance of [...] "Everybody", the lights were dimmed and the introduction music of [...] "Angel" [...] started. Rotating lights fell on the stage. Madonna appeared sitting on top of the stairs and gradually descended. During the intermediate bridge, she and her dancers moved energetically around the whole stage, as white balloons fell on them from above. Madonna continued singing as the lights were dimmed again.

2500|$|As well as {{a service}} inquiry an inquest was held at Uxbridge, Middlesex into {{the deaths of the}} two sisters and their four children.

50|$|Witnesses {{reported}} that the aircraft had an unusually long takeoff run and climbed slowly before <b>disappearing</b> <b>behind</b> {{the trees and the}} sky was lit by a fire. The air traffic controller told the investigation that the aircraft struggled to gain lift and its anti-collision beacon was seen to light up at low altitude before <b>disappearing</b> <b>behind</b> trees. It was {{reported that}} the left wing of the aircraft struck trees in complete darkness, diving on its port wing for over 130 metres, and then crashing into a creek running through the jungle. The aircraft then impacted with the ground and exploded in flames.|$|R
2500|$|Shortly {{after this}} point the steady, middle portion of the film begins, {{containing}} the famous look-back frame 352. Patterson said, [...] "it turned a total of I think three times," [...] the other times therefore being before the filming began and/or while he was running with his finger off the trigger. Shortly after glancing over its shoulder on film, the creature <b>disappeared</b> <b>behind</b> a grove of trees for 14 seconds, then reappeared in the film's final 15 seconds after Patterson moved ten feet to a better vantage point, fading into the trees again and being lost to view [...] {{at a distance of}} 265 feet as the reel of film ran out.|$|E

Her eyes mournfully contemplated the cross during the hymn. As the people sang the [...] "Ave Maris Stella," [...] the cross vanished and her smile returned, though {{with a touch of}} melancholy. Two small white crosses then appeared on her shoulders before Our Lady <b>disappeared</b> <b>behind</b> a cloud. As the night prayers came to a close, the apparition ended. It was about nine o'clock. The Apparition had lasted about three hours.|$|E
2500|$|On August 1, 1943, Litvyak did {{not come}} back to her base at Krasnyy Luch. It was her fourth sortie of the day, escorting a flight of Ilyushin Il-2 Shturmoviks.

About 02:00 on 12 September, their artillery opened up to begin the offensive. The squadron received orders to fly no lower than [...] in overflying enemy territory, but the 1st flew much lower than that, flying anywhere between [...] in altitude {{in order to avoid}} enemy machine-gun fire. Shortly after daylight, squadron aircraft #6 took off. The sun was clear before it arrived over the lines, but then <b>disappeared</b> <b>behind</b> the clouds. American infantry had just crossed the German lines and it was noted that panels had been [...] placed on the ground indicating that their artillery barrage was falling about 100 meters short.

[...] It was observed that the Germans were making a hasty retreat, deserting their guns, with their officers on horseback. Squadron aircraft attacked the retreating enemy with machine guns on low-level attacks. Wagons and trucks in the enemy rear were also attacked until fuel was nearly exhausted, landing back at Toul with nearly empty tanks. During the offensive, the ground infantry were continually supported by observation aircraft, assisting them in every manner possible.|$|E
