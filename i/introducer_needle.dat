The two objectives {{of this study were}} to develop a technique for simple and safe implantation of a commercially available microdialysis probe (CMA- 70) into the myocardium and to obtain reference data for further use and metabolic control. Eighteen pigs were used in an experimental ischaemic heart model where the left anterior descending coronary artery was occluded for 20 min. Microdialysis was performed proximally as well as distally to the arterial occlusion site corresponding to a control and an ischaemic area in the heart. Two techniques were tried for probe implantation, using either a pacemaker wire attached to the probe tip or a <b>needle</b> <b>introducer.</b> Metabolic substrates (glucose, lactate, glycerol and pyruvate) were collected before, during and after ischaemia, for up to 6 h. Both techniques were highly effective in registering metabolic changes due to ischaemia with sharp time resolution, but the <b>needle</b> <b>introducer</b> was superior regarding probe durability. It is concluded that the CMA- 70 microdialysis probe implanted with the <b>needle</b> <b>introducer</b> allows for an accurate monitoring of myocardial metabolism during a prolonged period of time.

40|$|Introduction: <b>Introducer</b> <b>needle</b> tip is {{not clearly}} visible during the {{real-time}} ultrasound (US) -guided central vein cannulation (CVC). Blind tip leads to mechanical complications. This {{study was designed}} to evaluate whether real-time US-guided CVC with a marked <b>introducer</b> <b>needle</b> is superior to the existing unmarked needle. Methodology: Sixty-two critically ill patients aged 18 – 60 years of either sex were included in the study. The patients were randomized into two groups based on whether a marked or unmarked <b>introducer</b> <b>needle</b> was used. Both groups underwent real-time US-guided CVC by a single experienced operator. Aseptically, <b>introducer</b> <b>needle</b> was indented with markings spaced 0. 5 cm (single marking) and every 1 cm (double marking). This needle was used in the marked group. Approximate depths (centimeter) of the anterior and posterior wall of the internal jugular vein, anterior wall of the internal carotid artery, and lung pleura were appreciated from the midpoint of the probe in short-axis view {{at the level of the}} cricoid cartilage. Access time (seconds) was recorded using a stopwatch. A number of attempts and complications such as arterial puncture, hematoma, and pneumothorax of either procedure were compared. Results: Both marked needle and unmarked needle groups were comparable with regard to age, gender, severity scores, platelet counts, prothrombin time, and distance from the midpoint of the probe to the vein, artery, and pleura and skin-to-guide wire insertion access time. However, an average number of attempts (P = 0. 03) and complications such as hematoma were significantly lower (P = 0. 02) with the marked <b>introducer</b> <b>needle</b> group. Pneumothorax was not reported in any of the groups.

40|$|Introduction Post-mortem {{computed}} tomography guided placement of co-axial <b>introducer</b> <b>needles</b> {{allows for the}} extraction of tissue and liquid samples for histological and toxicological analyses. Automation of this process can increase the accuracy and speed of the needle placement, thereby making it more feasible for routine examinations. To speed up the planning process and increase safety, we developed an algorithm that calculates an optimal entry point and end-effector orientation for a given target point, while taking constraints such as accessibility or bone collisions into account. Technique The algorithm identifies the best entry point for needle trajectories in three steps. First, the source CT data is prepared and bone as well as surface data are extracted and optimized. All vertices of the generated surface polygon {{are considered to be}} potential entry points. Second, all surface points are tested for validity within the defined hard constraints (reachability, bone collision as well as collision with other needles) and removed if invalid. All remaining vertices are reachable entry points and are rated with respect to needle insertion angle. Third, the vertex with the highest rating is selected as the final entry point, and the best end-effector rotation is calculated to avoid collisions with the body and already set needles. Discussion In most cases, the algorithm is sufficiently fast with approximately 5 – 6 s per entry point. This is the case if there is no collision between the end-effector and the body. If the end-effector has to be rotated to avoid collision, calculation times can increase up to 24 s due to the inefficient collision detection used here. In conclusion, the algorithm allows for fast and facilitated trajectory planning in forensic imaging...|$|R

40|$|Background: Cannulation of the {{internal}} jugular vein (IJV) is traditionally performed using the central-longitudinal approach. Pneumothorax, carotid artery puncture, and failure to cannulate are uncommon, {{but by no means}} rare, complications. Ultrasound (US) guidance for IJV cannulation has reduced but not eliminated such complications. Technique: We herein introduce a new approach, coined the "medial-transverse approach" due to the perpendicular angle at which the <b>introducer</b> <b>needle</b> is advanced toward the IJV from the median to lateral direction. Discussion: The direction of the <b>introducer</b> <b>needle</b> is not toward the lung, thus virtually eliminating the possibility of pneumothorax. The image of the entire needle is seen when the US probe is typically orientated for a short-axis view of the IJV and carotid artery, thus improving the chance of uncomplicated IJV puncture. We have used this technique with apparent success in thousands of cases over the past 20 years in two different institutions. Conclusion: A modified IJV cannulation technique that seems to have unique advantages over traditional approaches has been described. This technique is compatible with the blind and US-guided approaches. © 2012 Elsevier Inc. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E

All biopsies were performed utilizing a 19 gauge <b>introducer</b> <b>needle</b> and a 20 gauge core-cut biopsy needle. In all, 669 usable biopsies were taken (from 1 - 5 biopsies in each setting). The specimens were marked sequentially and each biopsy was worked up histologicaly. The biopsy results were correlated to histology after surgery, clinical follow-up or autopsy. The number of biopsies was determined that is necessary to achieve the highest possible accuracy in diagnosing pulmonary lesions. Results In 591 of 669 biopsies (88. 3 %), there were correct positive results. The overall accuracy was 87. 4 %. In 193 of 260 (74. 2 %) patients, a suspected malignancy was confirmed. In 50 of 260 (19. 2 %) patients, a benign lesion was correctly diagnosed. Seventeen (6. 5 %) patients were lost to follow-up.

Suburethral retropubic slings have been developed as a minimally invasive and effective surgical option, {{and they have been}} used as a first-line treatment for stress urinary incontinence since 1995. However, complications including vaginal extrusion, erosion, pain, bleeding, infections, lower urinary tract symptoms, urinary retention, and incontinence have been reported with use of the slings. Several companies manufacture sling kits, and the sling kits vary with regard to the composition of the mesh and <b>introducer</b> <b>needle.</b> The aim of this review was to determine which sling kit was most effective for patients, had minimal reported side effects, and was best accepted by patients and surgeons. In a review of the literature, it was found that a total of 38 studies were published between 1995 and 2014 that reported on eight tension-free retropubic sling kits: SPARC, RetroArc, Align, Advantage, Lynx, Desara, Supris, and Gynecare TVT. The Gynecare TVT was the most cited sling kit; the second most cited was the SPARC.
