5|$|Transversal {{filters are}} not usually {{associated}} with passive implementations but the concept {{can be found in}} a Wiener and Lee patent from 1935 which describes a filter consisting of a cascade of all-pass sections. The outputs of the various sections are summed in the proportions needed to result in the required <b>frequency</b> <b>function.</b> This works by the principle that certain frequencies will be in, or close to antiphase, at different sections and will tend to cancel when added. These are the frequencies rejected by the filter and can produce filters with very sharp cut-offs. This approach did not find any immediate applications, and is not common in passive filters. However, the principle finds many applications as an active delay line implementation for wide band discrete-time filter applications such as television, radar and high-speed data transmission.|$|E

[...] At first, such analogies were used in reverse to help explain electrical phenomena in familiar mechanical terms. [...] James Clerk Maxwell introduced analogies of this sort in the 19th century. [...] However, as electrical network analysis matured {{it was found that}} certain mechanical problems could more easily be solved through an electrical analogy.

500|$|Wilhelm Cauer {{expanded}} on {{the work}} of Foster (1926) [...] and was the first to talk of realisation of a one-port impedance with a prescribed <b>frequency</b> <b>function.</b> Foster's work considered only reactances (i.e., only LC-kind circuits). Cauer generalised this to any 2-element kind one-port network, finding there was an isomorphism between them. He also found ladder realisations of the network using Thomas Stieltjes' continued fraction expansion. This work was the basis on which network synthesis was built, although Cauer's work was not at first used much by engineers, partly because of the intervention of World War II, partly for reasons explained in the next section and partly because Cauer presented his results using topologies that required mutually coupled inductors and ideal transformers. Designers tend to avoid the complication of mutual inductances and transformers where possible, although transformer-coupled double-tuned amplifiers are a common way of widening bandwidth without sacrificing selectivity.|$|E

500|$|One {{advantage}} that mechanical filters have over LC electrical filters {{is that they}} can be made very stable. The resonance frequency can be made so stable that it varies only 1.5parts per billion (ppb) from the specified value over the operating temperature range (...) , and its average drift with time can be as low as 4ppb per day. This stability with temperature is another reason for using nickel-iron as the resonator material. Variations with temperature in the resonance frequency (and other features of the <b>frequency</b> <b>function)</b> are directly related to variations in the Young's modulus, which is a measure of stiffness of the material. [...] Materials are therefore sought that have a small temperature coefficient of Young's modulus. [...] In general, Young's modulus has a negative temperature coefficient (materials become less stiff with increasing temperature) but additions of small amounts of certain other elements in the alloy can produce a material with a temperature coefficient that changes sign from negative through zero to positive with temperature. Such a material will have a zero coefficient of temperature with resonance frequency around a particular temperature. It is possible to adjust the point of zero temperature coefficient to a desired position by heat treatment of the alloy.|$|E

50|$|The {{advantage}} of using commensurate lines {{is that the}} commensurate line theory allows circuits to be synthesised from a prescribed <b>frequency</b> <b>function.</b> While any circuit using arbitrary transmission line lengths can be analysed to determine its <b>frequency</b> <b>function,</b> that circuit cannot necessarily be easily synthesised starting from the <b>frequency</b> <b>function.</b> The fundamental problem is that using more than one length generally requires more than one frequency variable. Using commensurate lines requires only one frequency variable. A well developed theory exists for synthesising lumped element circuits from a given <b>frequency</b> <b>function.</b> Any circuit so synthesised {{can be converted to}} a commensurate line circuit using Richards' transformation and a new frequency variable.|$|E

40|$|Many {{studies have}} {{attempted}} to detect structural damage by examining differences in the <b>frequency</b> response <b>functions</b> of a structure before and after damage. In an experimental setting, this variation can not be attributed solely to the addition of damage. Other sources of variation include testing and structure variation. Examples of testing variation include the error introduced by modal parameter extraction, measurement noise, and the mass loading of the accelerometer. Structure variability is due to slight differences in the supposedly identical structures. Dimensional tolerancing is one example. This study began with six “identical ” undamaged aluminum cylinders, of which three were later damaged to varying extents. The <b>frequency</b> response <b>functions</b> of the undamaged and damaged cylinders were measured. Also, the <b>frequency</b> response <b>function</b> of the same undamaged cylinder was measured multiple times to investigate testing variation. The contributions of testing, cylinder, and damage variation to the differences between cylinder responses was elucidated by specifically examining their <b>frequency</b> response <b>functions</b> in two ways: comparing the natural frequencies and directly investigating the entire <b>frequency</b> response <b>function.</b> The curvature of the <b>frequency</b> response <b>functions</b> was then used to determined the presence, location, and severity of the imparted damage...|$|R

When the rider rides the motorcycle mock up, a system of sensors measures the input motion and {{the response of the}} rider’s body. The response of the rider’s body is represented in the frequency domain by means of frequency response functions: the motion <b>frequency</b> response <b>function</b> describes the lean motion of the rider’s trunk, the torque <b>frequency</b> response <b>function</b> describes the torque applied by the rider on the handlebars.
