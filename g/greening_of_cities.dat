30|$|The {{proposal}} {{of a new}} style of urbanization is aimed at using urbanization to boost domestic demand and using domestic demand to spur adjustments to the economic structure. Compared to conventional urbanization, new-style urbanization places more emphasis {{on the quality of}} city construction. New-style urbanization is driven by new-style industrialization and based on the principle of planning that considers all factors. New-style urbanization promotes the modernization of cities, the clustering of cities, the <b>greening</b> <b>of</b> <b>cities,</b> and the urbanization of the countryside to fully elevate the quality and level of urbanization, achieve scientific development, and coordinate the development of large, medium, and small cities and towns that are scientifically developed, intensive and highly efficient, perfect in function, with good environments, and with social harmony, and which integrates urban and rural areas.|$|E
30|$|A {{synthesis}} of the case studies provided in this discourse shows the greening efforts yet by the cities {{and there are many}} determinant factors to trend. To a great extent, South African cities have successful embraced city greening. This {{can be attributed to the}} aspect of good governance after building on from the political resources accumulated after the end the apartheid government in 1994. These political resources lead to strong environmental policies which include strategies, codes and plans to monitor and improve the urban environment which have also been a factor in the success of greening in South Africa’s cities. One of the cities with the lowest green ratio, Addis Ababa has no colonial heritage and still maturing governance. Funding is an important factor determining the success or failure of city greening efforts. In a number of cities some well-known successful projects, have effectively received funding from some from external aid by donor agencies and a few from government funding. Financing has been important for the successful <b>greening</b> <b>of</b> <b>cities.</b> For example, Johannesburg received US$ 5.3 million from The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and US$ 1.2 million from Danish Development Agency; Cairo received US$ 350 million Clean Technology Fund (CTF) and US$ 5.3 million from The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation [6].|$|E
40|$|Thesis (M. T. R. P.) -University of KwaZulu-Natal, Durban, 2009. Owing to {{the concern}} about the serious factors {{influencing}} global warming and climatic change, the process of sustainable landscape construction as well as ecologically friendly developments needs to be addressed. In particular, the questions to ask is are we nearer to accepting sustainable growth advantages in South Africa, primarily the greater eThekwini Municipal Area? In this research paper an analysis of both a theoretical and practical approach to conventional understanding s relating to development practices and issues that encompass <b>greening</b> <b>of</b> <b>cities</b> {{and the notion of}} rooftop gardens will be assessed. In so doing it will investigate the discourse surrounding urban ecology and sustainable landscape developments and how both processes incorporate the topic of rooftop gardening, urban agriculture and people’s attitudes towards nature in the city, which regrettably from a South African perspective has very little comprehensive literature written about it. The research will give clarity and hopefully show that there is sufficient evidence to demonstrate that rooftop gardens form an intricate part of urban ecology. In addition to this that they can provide general environmental, associated aesthetic and health benefits for cities and their inhabitants. Hopefully in culmination this research study will promote a greater insight into rooftop gardens benefits for city management systems...|$|E

40|$|A {{number of}} {{countries}} are concerned, to a certain degree, about the prospects for {{the implementation of the}} Chinese strategic initiative for the joint creation of the “Silk Road Economic Belt” (SREB). These concerns relate to fears of the transfer from China to the “belt” countries of excessive capacities of the polluting primaries industries, possible environmental degradation, and the destruction of the traditional way of life {{as a result of the}} implementation of mega-projects, and the fragility and vulnerability of many ecosystems along the routes of the prospective throughways between the eastern provinces of China and Europe [Bezrukov, 2016].  Environmental problems are clearly of key importance for the prospects of China’s initiative. The initiative’s program documents have stressed the need to take into account the interests of all parties and act solely on the basis of mutual benefit. The authors briefly consider the variety of natural and socio-economic conditions in the SREB zone and the sharp differences in the degree of economic development of the territory, which require close attention and scientific justification for political and economic decisions. Particular differences include temperature regime, precipitation, modern atmospheric circulation, transport of particulate matter and contaminants, soils, vegetation, land use, and risks of desertification in the SREB zone. The potential of complementarity of the natural resources of China and a number of neighboring countries may be realized. The paper also discusses China’s present policy in the transition to sustainable development and its underlying concepts and achievements, especially at the level of regions and cities, including the concept of “ecological civilization” and the six stages of <b>greening</b> <b>of</b> <b>cities.</b> The authors believe that tourism related activities should be coordinated specifically at the city level as part of “green development. ” It is necessary to create free economic zones in the “economic corridors” along the planned transcontinental lines and utilize the existing national special zones. Such zones are particularly effective in border regions and cities. In conclusion, it is recommended to develop international research networks in the SREB zone, to establish an International Data Center, and to collect, organize, exchange, and publish jointly scientific information on the problems of transition to sustainable development. </p...|$|E
40|$|<b>Greening</b> <b>of</b> <b>cities</b> {{has become}} a {{significant}} motivation for landscape architects, urban designers, and architects, {{as well as a}} growing public expectation. While there is need for the development of new technologies to accomplish some of this greening, a reappraisal of traditional New Zealand parks (19 th century), often modelled on the English Landscape parks of earlier centuries, such as found at the Unitec campus, may also offer innovative contributions to the understanding of green networks (or urban forest) in the city, through their plant selection, management, promotion and evolution. Unitec Institute of Technology, in Auckland, New Zealand, is well known locally for its park like grounds. Unitec’s campus and tree collection can also be understood in its wider urban vegetation context, and has potential to be developed into a more widely recognised and utilised arboretum resource. The tree collection has been documented by the institute, assisted by research from botanist Mike Wilcox (1996) and senior lecturer Penny Cliffin (2001). This paper will illustrate the project progress to date, and reflect on the impact of these developments in relation to urban vegetation values, such as biodiversity, green infrastructure and watershed management, public recreation, amenity and education. Students are currently developing concepts for the arboretum including improved path networks, connections to the wider community via pedestrian and cycleways, and planting proposals for enhancing Arboretum themes such as bird habitat and fruiting trees as well as experiential aspects of spatial design. Along with this design exercise, students are undertaking campus tree research and documentation, by updating and enhancing the campus database, including the addition of photographs and Geotagging. Online and direct mapping and visitor interpretation such as a brief history of the campus and tree labels, is also being developed to promote the arboretum as a resource for staff, students and the public, in order to better understand urban vegetation values and provide student with experience for their future practice...|$|E
30|$|Unfortunately, {{when most}} {{cities in the}} Global North are {{embracing}} <b>greening</b> <b>of</b> <b>cities</b> as the way to go, Africa {{seems to be taking}} a piecemeal and generally a wait-and-see approach to the whole debate and practice (MO [11, 16]). Some cities (like Kigali in Rwanda) have done very well while many seem lost in endeavours to serve as successful green cities by the obsession to deal with the brown agenda issues. Nevertheless, there are also limits to the endeavours. Absent in the assessment of {{the situation on the ground}} and possible scenarios for an African city systems analysis, at theoretical, policy and action research level. Most urban centres in Africa have disintegrated into nothing but places of misery and hopelessness and, with climate change impacts, the situation can get worse by each day. There are unaccounted prospects that are available in endeavours to green the African cities. This article identifies the complexity of environmental issues that cities of Africa face and are likely to face beyond 2050 [11]. It draws some lessons learnt from city greening initiatives implemented beyond Africa as well as those some of the cities are trying to implement. Thus, basing on evidence and experience from selected five cities in the region, this article provides a holistic view of the complex urban environmental systems and how they relate to the efforts by the cities to address environmental challenges. Conventional wisdom has it that the expected growth of the African cities in fifty years will lead to severe urban environmental problems as the challenges are reaching colossal magnitudes ever imagined – for example increasing slum conditions, pollution of water bodies, poor solid waste management practices, to mention but a few. Greening offers a panacea to some of these problems [14, 20] and yet this is not as straightforward and simple as the word implies. Systems dynamics offers some platform on which one can comprehend the urban environmental challenges that urban systems can be encountering and, in this case, the African city. An analysis of various city greening efforts which follows in this article illustrates the complexity of the environmental system. The major thrust of the article is to provide a possible future of Africa beyond 50  years from now (cf. [11]).|$|E

40|$|Green spaces {{help build}} healthy {{communities}} and bring various social {{benefits for the}} public. In order to ensure the wellness of <b>greening</b> <b>of</b> <b>cities,</b> some space standards such as green space coverage and the average area of green space per person are widely adopted in green space location planning, and they were also widely accepted as indices for cross-city comparisons. However, using these standards alone {{ignores the fact that}} both green spaces and population are unevenly distributed in cities. And many cities do not have enough green spaces at adequate locations for public access. Using a real city as an example, this study presents a capacitated location-allocation modeling approach for planners and policy-makers to incorporate existing green space planning standards into location models to evaluate existing green spaces and select potential green space locations to meet public recreation needs. This approach is to find the locations of green spaces among all candidate sites which minimize the cost of green space construction, or in other words, to build the minimum amount of new green space area and make the best use of existing green spaces, such that the proportion of the population that can each share a certain amount of green space within standard catchment distance can meet green space service percent coverage standard. The author addresses the problem of applying some space standards directly into the models and points out that these standards have to be adjusted for feasible solutions. Taking the study case for example, the average green space area per person is much higher than 15 m 2, but when uneven distributions of population were considered, the average accessible green space area per person is less than 5 m 2. Given the uncertainty of such planning standards as part of the model inputs, multiple model results with the various parameter inputs were generated. Finally an integration approach of these model results was proposed for the purpose of green space plan implementation: the green spaces in the solutions were classified into different groups according to their relative contributions to serve the demands, and different implementation strategies were suggested for each green space group. 2019 - 08 - 1...|$|E
