Preliminary tests on the process efficiency, performed with reduced volumes of water and oil in a static system, assessed the sorption kinetics, the yield of the process for fresh wool and the number of sorption-regeneration cycles at which the wool can be submitted without reduction of the original adsorption properties. The obtained results were used to set a scaled up series of tests, on a pilot prototype, suitable for reproduce the real recovery conditions of a ship on the sea. The possible destination of the exhausted wool was also taken into account.

40|$|Selection {{objectives}} and criteria were defined and appraised {{for a simple}} production system involving a New Zealand Romney breeding flock under North Island hill country conditions, in which all surplus offspring are sold as lambs. Through the availability of New Zealand Wool Board auction data for the seasons 1976 / 77 to 1980 / 81, the influence of wool quality traits on price was analysed by regression techniques. Traits examined included mean fibre diameter (MFD), style(S), mean length (ML) and yield (Y). For the 1980 / 81 season only, further data from the Coded Sales Assistance Report (C. S. A. R.) was available for scouring indicator (SI), colour indicator (CI), felted (F), pen stain (P), cotted (Co), tender (T), mixed length (LV) and mixed quality (QV). In addition, the effects on price of three non-fleece variables, lot weight (LW), mode of offering (MO) and New Zealand Wool Board market intervention policies (Int), were considered. Y was shown {{to have a major}} influence over greasy price. The relationship between price and ML was confirmed as being non-linear, with ML having a greater effect on the price of shorter wools. S and MFD were less influential. The control these four traits jointly exerted over greasy price ranged up to 74. 0 %, which was further enhanced by the introduction of quadratic terms. ML 2 was the most important quadratic term. The inclusion of the C. S. A. R. and non-fleece related traits, failed to provide any further control over price. CI proved to be an effective substitute for S. Selection objectives were defined for <b>greasy</b> and clean <b>wool,</b> combined with short, long and mixed length categories. Economic weights for wool quality traits were directly calculated from the regression of auction price on the level of the traits. Economic weights for number of lambs weaned (NLW), weaning weight (WW), ewe body weight (EBW), greasy fleece weight (GFW) and clean fleece weight (CFW) were calculated using the marginal profit method. The relativities between the calculated economic weights were generally in good agreement with those of previously published estimates. For the selection objectives defined, various selection criteria were appraised. These included the traits in the selection objective, or their respective criteria, as well as hogget body weight (HBW), quality number (QN) and fleece character grade (CHG). NLW (dam), HBW and HGFW were of major importance in the selection index. The remaining traits were of only minimal value. On the basis of cost of measurement and value within the index, the full index was converted to a reduced index of NLW (dam), HBW and HGFW. In terms of accuracy of prediction and economy, this index was considered suitable for most commercial conditions. Further reduced indices were computed which generated less overall genetic gain, but which individual breeders may consider more appropriate to their particular requirements. Sensitivity analyses for HBW, NLW, GFW (CFW) and SC generally produced few changes of any consequence to the selection indices.

40|$|Fibre {{diameter}} {{can vary}} dramatically along a wool staple, {{especially in the}} Mediterranean environment of southern Australia with its dry summers and abundance of green feed in spring. Other research results have shown a very low phenotypic correlation between fibre diameter grown between seasons. Many breeders use short staples to measure fibre diameter for breeding purposes and also to promote animals for sale. The effectiveness of this practice {{is determined by the}} relative response to selection by measuring fibre traits on a full 12 months wool staple as compared to measuring them only on part of a staple. If a high genetic correlation exists between the part record and the full record, then using part records may be acceptable to identify genetically superior animals. No information is available on the effectiveness of part records. This paper investigated whether wool growth and fibre diameter traits of Merino wool grown at different times of the year in a Mediterranean environment, are genetically the same trait, respectively. The work was carried out on about 7 dyebanded wool sections/animal. year, on ewes from weaning to hogget age, in the Katanning Merino resource flocks over 6 years. Relative clean wool growth of the different sections had very low heritability estimates of less than 0. 10, and they were phenotypically and genetically poorly correlated with 6 or 12 months wool growth. This indicates that part record measurement of clean wool growth of these sections will be ineffective as indirect selection criteria to improve wool growth genetically. Staple length growth as measured by the length between dyebands, would be more effective with heritability estimates of between 0. 20 and 0. 30. However, these measurements were shown to have a low genetic correlation with wool grown for 12 months which implies that these staple length measurements would only be half as efficient as the wool weight for 6 or 12 months to improve total clean wool weight. Heritability estimates of fibre diameter, coefficient of variation of fibre diameter and fibre curvature were relatively high and were genetically and phenotypically highly correlated across sections. High positive phenotypic and genetic correlations were also found between fibre diameter, coefficient of variation of fibre diameter and fibre curvature of the different sections and similar measurements for wool grown over 6 or 12 months. Coefficient of variation of fibre diameter of the sections also had a moderate negative phenotypic and genetic correlation with staple strength of wool staples grown over 6 months indicating that coefficient of variation of fibre diameter of any section would be as good an indirect selection criterion to improve stable strength as coefficient of variation of fibre diameter for wool grown over 6 or 12 months. The results indicate that fibre diameter, coefficient of variation of fibre diameter and fibre curvature of wool grown over short periods of time have virtually the same heritability as that of wool grown over 12 months, and that the genetic correlation between fibre diameter, coefficient of variation of fibre diameter and fibre curvature on part and on full records is very high (rg > 0. 85). This indicates that fibre diameter, coefficient of variation of fibre diameter and fibre curvature on part records can be used as selection criteria to improve these traits. However, part records of <b>greasy</b> and clean <b>wool</b> growth would be much less efficient than fleece weight for wool grown over 6 or 12 months because of the low heritability of part records and the low genetic correlation between these traits on part records and on wool grown for 12 months...|$|R
40|$|Irregular pagination: missing page 99 Samples from {{different}} body regions {{were obtained from}} the birthcoat, first, second and third fleeces of sheep in two Drysdale flocks. Fibre type arrays of birthcoat samples were analysed and various wool traits were assessed and measured in samples obtained at three shearings. Sampling position was the main source of variation in most traits studied. Sex, birth rank, and age of dam generally made little contribution to the total variance. Shearing, flock and sire effects were also important sources of variation for many traits. The interaction of shearing X position and the interactions of sire with each of shearing, sex and birth rank were significant for many traits. Phenotypic correlations among fleece traits were estimated from shoulder and mid-side positions as well as among fleece averages calculated from all positions. Correlations among fleece averages showed that higher kemp score (KS) was associated with higher bulk; BUL (0. 24 to 0. 64), resilience; RES (0. 03 to 0. 48) and tristimulus colour values; X, Y and Z (0. 08 to 0. 46). Softer handle grade tended to be correlated with lower BUL (- 0. 22 to - 0. 66) and RES (- 0. 16 to - 0. 53) and higher lustre; LG (0. 10 to 0. 62). Higher medullation index (MI) was generally associated with higher BUL (- 0. 15 to 0. 49) and tristimulus colour values (- 0. 01 to 0. 60) and lower LG (- 0. 65 to 0. 08). Correlations among tristimulus colour values were the highest between X and Y reflectances (0. 93 to 1. 00). <b>Greasy</b> and clean <b>wool</b> per unit area (GWA and CWA) were highly correlated (0. 93 to 0. 96). Heavier first greasy fleece weight (GFW 1) correlated positively with GWA (0. 59) and CWA (0. 56). Staple length (STL) tended to be longer as GWA (0. 37 to 0. 60), CWA (0. 39 to 0. 60) and GFW 1 (0. 64) inceased and as BUL decreased (- 0. 01 to - 0. 54). BUL and RES were highly correlated (0. 82 to 0. 95). LG was negatively correlated with BUL (- 0. 12 to - 0. 66) and RES (- 0. 10 to - 0. 41). Very few sickle fibres were found in Drysdale materials; most arrays were plateau. Coarser arrays were associated with higher proportions of hairy-tip curly-tip fibres (HTCT). GFW 1 increased as HTCTs increased (0. 33 to 0. 46). Generally, the correlations among birthcoat and third fleece traits were not strong which implies that birthcoat traits are not reliable indications to selection for various traits in later fleeces of Drysdale sheep. Higher MI was associated with coarser arrays (- 0. 07 to - 0. 55) and higher proportions of super-sickle A fibres (0. 22 to 0. 41). Finer arrays were associated with higher yield (0. 01 to 0. 38). In one flock, sheep with a higher proportion of halo-hair (HH) fibres had higher GWA (0. 25 to 0. 33), CWA (0. 17 to 0. 30) and heavier third fleece weights (0. 09 to 0. 33) while sheep with coarser birthcoat arrays showed a slight tendency to have more bulky fleeces (- 0. 22 to - 0. 29). Medullation index of the third fleece (MI 3) as well as greasy and clean third fleece weights (GFW 3 and CFW 3) can be predicted, with limited accuracy (R 2 = 0. 50) from the first shearing shoulder (SH 1) traits by using the following multiple regression equations: Within flock-sex groups MI 3 = 9. 15 + 0. 45 MI (SH 1) + 1. 84 KS (SH 1) For rams GFW 3 = - 1. 47 + 0. 04 HH% (SH 1) + 0. 14 X (SH 1) - 0. 09 Z (SH 1) CFW 3 = - 1. 53 + 0. 03 HH% (SH 1) + 0. 14 X (SHI) - 0. 09 Z (SH 1) It appeared that the shoulder is the best position from which to sample fleeces when a number of traits are to be assessed for ranking Drysdale sheep...|$|R

The study provides evidence to support the conclusion that the present wool auction system has a number of inefficiencies and suggests that the introduction of objective measurement, into wool marketing could improve this situation...|$|E

Lamb liveweight gains, fasted liveweights at slaughter and hot carcass weights {{tended to be}} highest on legumes and chicory and lowest on plantain and ryegrass. <b>Greasy</b> <b>wool</b> weights were significantly higher on lotus and white clover than on chicory, plantain and ryegrass. <b>Greasy</b> <b>wool</b> weight {{was significantly related to}} fasted liveweight (R 2 = 0. 94 – 0. 99). Protein (%) in herbage accounted for 83 – 92 % of the variability in animal perfor-mance; food intake accounted for 57 – 69 % of the variability and was negatively correlated with hemicellulose and cellulose (R 2 = 97. 2 and 80. 9 %, respectively).

40|$|<b>Greasy</b> <b>wool</b> colour is a {{component}} of wool style and a determinant of price received, but it is clean wool colour that determines potential colour range and dye-ability of wool garments. Selective breeding {{is a means of}} improving raw wool clean colour, but its effectiveness is currently unclear due to limited existing information on clean colour variability, heritability and correlations with other fleece traits. Clean colour was measured on yearling (10 mths, n= 7106) and adult (21 mths, n= 8078) animals. Other fleece traits, including assessed <b>greasy</b> <b>wool</b> colour, were also recorded and genetic parameters for clean and <b>greasy</b> <b>wool</b> colour estimated. Clean wool colour was moderately to highly heritable at both yearling and adult ages (0. 25 and 0. 29 respectively), as was greasy colour (0. 33 and 0. 40). Clean wool colour at yearling and adult age was moderately genetically correlated (0. 52), suggesting that selection using yearling measurements would be effective for improving lifetime clean wool colour. Greasy and clean wool colour were poorly correlated phenotypically and genetically at both yearling and adult age. Of the measured fleece traits, fibre diameter and curvature were those with highest genetic correlations with clean wool colour (yearling, 0. 52,- 0. 34). These correlations indicate that superfine wool animals with a classical crimp frequency to fibre diameter ratio (true-to-type) tend to have superior clean wool colour compared to other wool types included here...|$|E
