[...] His stature {{in the history}} of child art and art education {{is similar to that of}} Franz Cižek's in the West. [...] Elementary schools teachers took to his ideas quickly in the wake of their dissatisfaction with the [...] textbooks the government had mandated in 1910 that emphasized copying and neglected personal expression. [...] Yamamoto's was the first public criticism of the textbooks, and his methods led to a sharp decline in their use in the 1920s. [...] Yamamoto encouraged teachers to take children outdoors to sketch, a practice that continues to be common in Japanese elementary schools. [...] Though Japanese militarism put his ideas on hold from the late 1920s educators revived and expanded them beginning in the 1950s.|$|E

Only it must be observed that the best characters of <b>free</b> <b>drawing</b> are always lost even in the most careful facsimile; and I should not show even these slight notes in woodcut imitation, unless the reader had it in his power, by a glance at the 21st or 35th plates in Modern Painters (and yet better, by trying to copy a piece of either of them), to ascertain how far I can draw or not. I refer to these plates, because, though I distinctly stated in the preface that they, together with the 12th, 20th, 34th, and 37th, were executed on the steel by my own hand, (the use of the dry point in the foregrounds of the 12th and 21st plates being moreover wholly different from the common processes of etching) I find it constantly assumed that they were engraved for me--as if direct lying in such matters were a thing of quite common usage.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: The National College of Art and Design (Norwegian abbreviation: SHKS) in Norway was {{established}} in 1818,as a school for educating craftsmen and artists. Until late 20 th century, <b>free</b> hand <b>drawing</b> was its foundational subject. Today, {{this is no longer}} the case, and the recurrent questions are: Which competences do design students need in <b>free</b> hand <b>drawing,</b> how should this subject be taught, and what should the education curriculum comprise? This paper aims at clarifying the tradition in which <b>free</b> hand <b>drawing</b> is embedded. Asking what the institutional teaching of <b>free</b> hand <b>drawing</b> actually was, reveals that little information is available. This teaching has been demonstrative and oral, therefore, only scarce sources are available. The exception to the rule is Kari Liv Brundin Torjussen (1922 -) who has left a personal archive of her teaching work. She taught <b>free</b> hand <b>drawing</b> in the first year design class at SHKS from 1947 - 1990. This paper represents an initial phase of a broader research project of the institutional history. It presents a brief biography of Kari and the beginning of an analysis of her teaching, based on interviews with her, statements from some of her students, institutional archival material, literature and her personal archive.

40|$|Introduction: The {{utility and}} discriminatory {{pattern of the}} clock face drawing test in ADHD is unclear. This study {{therefore}} compared Clock Face Drawing test performance in children with ADHD and controls.   Material & methods: 95 children with ADHD and 191 school children were matched for gender ratio and age. ADHD symptoms severities were assessed using DSM-IV ADHD checklist and their intellectual functioning was assessed. The participants completed three clock-drawing tasks, and the following four functions were assessed: Contour score, Numbers score, Hands setting score, and Center score    Results: All the subscales scores of the three clock drawing tests of the ADHD group were {{lower than that of}} the control group. In ADHD children, inattention and hyperactivity/impulsivity scores were not related with <b>free</b> <b>drawn</b> clock test scores. When pre-drawn contour test was performed, inattentiveness score was statistically associated with Number score. None of the other variables of age, gender, intellectual functioning, and hand use preference were associated with Numbers score. In pre-drawn clock, no association of ADHD symptoms with any CDT subscales was significant. In addition, more errors are observed with <b>free</b> <b>drawn</b> clock and Pre-drawn contour than pre-drawn clock.  &nbsp;  Conclusion: Putting Numbers and Hands setting are more sensitive measures to screen ADHD than Contour and Center drawing. Test performance, except Hands setting, may have already reached a developmental plateau. It is probable that Hand setting deficit in children with ADHD may not decrease from age 8 to 14 years. Performance of children with ADHD is associated with the complexity of CDT...|$|R
