5|$|A {{number of}} {{additional}} accomplishments in sports {{have been attributed}} to Clement, but cannot be confirmed because of poor record keeping at the time. These claims include winning tennis championships in Iowa and South Dakota and setting world records <b>in</b> <b>shot</b> put, sprinting, hurdling, and baseball, where it is claimed that Clement threw a baseball 275 feet.|$|E

The St. Thomas Aquinas team {{went on to win the}} county championship that year. Almon also played ice hockey and competed <b>in</b> <b>shot</b> put with the track and field team in high school.|$|E
5|$|Amanda E. Clement (March 20, 1888 – July 20, 1971) was {{the first}} woman paid to umpire a {{baseball}} game, and may have also been the first woman to referee a high school basketball game. Clement served as an umpire on a regular basis for six years, and served occasionally for several decades afterwards. An accomplished athlete in multiple disciplines, Clement competed in baseball, basketball, track, gymnastics, and tennis, and has been attributed world records <b>in</b> <b>shot</b> put, sprinting, hurdling, and baseball.|$|E

5|$|Although The Human Centipede {{is set in}} Germany, {{principal}} photography {{took place}} in the Netherlands due to the neighboring countries' similar landscapes. Heiter's home, where most of The Human Centipede takes place, was a villa in the Netherlands found by the production team. The property was in a residential area and not surrounded by woodland as it appears in the film, but by other houses. This meant the filmmakers had some difficulty ensuring that the other houses did not appear <b>in</b> <b>shot.</b> Some conversion of the property took place prior to filming, for example, a cinema room was converted to form Heiter's basement operating theatre, with real hospital beds and intravenous drips rented from a local hospital. The paintings of conjoined twins that were displayed throughout the house were painted by Tom Six, which he felt contributed to the atmosphere in the house. The hotel room scene near the beginning of the film was filmed in a hotel suite at a location near Amsterdam. The film was shot almost entirely in sequence, which Yennie stated helped the actors to develop their characters throughout the film. The opening scene, which only featured Laser and de Wit, was shot {{on the last day of}} filming.|$|E
5|$|Ana Po'uhila {{participated in}} the women's shot put on the behalf of Tonga at the Beijing Olympics, and was the only female athlete {{competing}} for Tonga at the 2008 Olympic games. She was born in Nuku'alofa, the national capital, which lies on the primary Tongan island of Tongatapu. Po'uhila first {{participated in the}} Olympics at age 24, when she represented Tonga <b>in</b> <b>shot</b> put at the 2004 Athens games. She represented Tonga again in Beijing {{at the age of}} 32. During the qualifying heat of her event, which took place on August 15, the Tongan field athlete was placed in the seventeen-person second heat. Po'uhila was given three attempts to put the shot as far as she could. During the first attempt, she lobbed the shot 16.21meters, ranking 12th in her heat. She bested this ranking on her second attempt when she lobbed it 16.42meters, ranking seventh amongst those who threw during the second try. Her third and final attempt, 16.35meters, did not beat her second attempt. Using her best mark, 16.42meters, Po'uhila placed 12th out of the 16 athletes who finished the event. She ranked ahead of Taiwan's Lin Chia-Ying (16.32meters) and behind Russia's Irina Khudoroshkina (16.84meters) in a heat led by China's Gong Lijiao (19.46meters) and Belarus' Nadzeya Ostapchuk (19.08meters). Of the 33 athletes who finished the event, Ana Po'uhila ranked 27th. She did not advance to the final round.|$|E

5|$|The {{engineering}} set {{did provide}} some challenges; a {{health and safety}} brief was required for the actors on it as it was still raised off the ground. Furthermore, {{the results of the}} bubbles being sent through water tubes that represented part of the engine core created noise issues for the sound technicians; they asked for it to be turned off whenever it wasn't placed <b>in</b> <b>shot.</b> One of the special effects went wrong, causing an actual explosion behind Jeri Ryan rather than simply creating sparks following the weapons fire which would be edited in during post-optical effects. The explosion remained in the final cut. The final day of the shoot took place on March 10; taking the filming period to eight days, a day longer than normal for Voyager episodes. It took place on the set of the Dauntless bridge, in the orange color scheme. The final full scene filmed was of the scene {{at the end of the}} episode where the Dauntless returns to Borg space and Arturis realises he is about to be assimilated, and after an hour of closeups for various scenes, the shoot ended at 12:50am on March 11.|$|E

25|$|Baquedano {{wanted to}} check out the troops situation, and moved dangerously close to the front line. Apparently, Peruvian {{soldiers}} fired upon Baquedano, and their shots were answered by the Chileans. <b>In</b> <b>shot</b> time, the cross fire became general, and the battle started unexpectedly at 14:00 hrs., catching both sides unprepared. However, the Chilean right was attacked by Cáceres' Corps. The Chilean battleships began to fire upon the Peruvians trying to ease the pressure. Cáceres saw the chance to destroy Lagos' division and sent the Guardia Chalaca and Guarnición de Marina battalions against Barceló, while a fraction of Col. Suárez' Corps engaged Urriola, who wasn't formed yet. The strength of the attack forced the Chileans to retreat. At this time, Lynch wasn't yet in position, so the cavalry and the artillery withdrew from the front line.|$|E
