25|$|Hampton v. United States, (425 U.S. 484 (1976)), is a United States Supreme Court {{decision}} {{on the subject of}} Entrapment. By a 5-3 margin, the Court upheld the conviction of a Missouri man for selling heroin even though all the drug sold was supplied to him, he claimed, by a Drug Enforcement Administration informant who had, in turn, <b>gotten</b> <b>it</b> from the DEA. The majority held that the record showed Hampton was predisposed to sell drugs no matter his source.|$|E
500|$|Gosling was {{scheduled}} to begin filming The Lovely Bones in 2007. However, he left the production two days before filming began because of [...] "creative differences" [...] {{and was replaced by}} Mark Wahlberg. Gosling had been cast as the father of the murdered teenage girl and initially felt he was too young for the role. The director Peter Jackson and the producer Fran Walsh persuaded him that he could be aged with hair and make-up changes. Before shooting began, Gosling gained 60 pounds in weight and grew a beard to appear older. Walsh then [...] "began to feel he was not right. It was our blindness, the desire to make it work no matter what." [...] Gosling later said, [...] "We didn't talk very much during the preproduction process, which was the problem ... I just showed up on set, and I had <b>gotten</b> <b>it</b> wrong. Then I was fat and unemployed." [...] He has said the experience was [...] "an important realisation for me: not to let your ego get involved. It's OK to be too young for a role." ...|$|E

2500|$|The version {{from the}} Elevation Tour, {{featured}} just the Edge on a Gibson Les Paul Custom {{playing in a}} higher key with less wah-wah. Bono did not play guitar on these versions, as he usually performed on the heart-shaped stage in the audience. This version is also notable for its added introduction with Bono singing new lyrics over only the Edge's arpeggiated chords. His new lyrics would then involve him reciting parts of the chorus of the song. The Edge did not sing in falsetto during the chorus as he has done on the versions from other tours. This tour also included the first extended ending of the song. The band felt that although the song was good, they hadn't <b>gotten</b> <b>it</b> exactly right. David Bowie told them, upon hearing it, that {{it needed to be}} re-recorded. Bono has also said, [...] "It took us fifteen years to really get it right live," [...] implying that the intended product is the version played on the Vertigo Tour.|$|E

2500|$|From late 1970 {{to early}} 1977 Draheim lived in England, where her talents as a fiddler soon became so well {{recognized}} that Austrian music journalist Richard Schuberth counted her among the [...] "crème de la crème of the English folk-rock scene". She {{brought with her}} a background of US genres of folk music which blended well with the British folk-rock scene. [...] In one case at least, her influence on the British music scene rebounded {{to have an effect}} on the US music scene: American guitarist and author of several instructional manuals Duck Baker wrote that he had learned the Peacock Rag from John Renbourn [...] "who would have <b>gotten</b> <b>it</b> from Sue Draheim". Draheim had begun her association with John Renbourn in 1971, and joined the John Renbourn Group, cutting the album Faro Annie with John Renbourn, Keshav Sathe, and Jacqui McShee in 1972. [...] Impressed by Draheim's old West Clare style which she'd learned from Joe Cooley, John Renbourn observed: [...] "I found out more about Irish music from Sue than I could ever have imagined." [...] That same year she also performed on Henry the Human Fly, an album by songwriter and guitarist Richard Thompson. 1972 was a busy year for her as she and John Renbourn worked together with Wizz Jones to produce Wizz's album Right Now, in addition to recording albums with Scottish folksinger Marc Ellington.|$|E
2500|$|Blache was {{introduced}} to the idea of painting Leah Chase by his art representative at the time Eugene C. Daymude in the summer of 2009. The 20 small oil paintings that comprised the series detailed the day-to-day activities 92-year-old Chef Leah Chase encounters from early morning prep work to greeting guests in the dining room. [...] Blache was heralded for his depiction of the culinary icon for his accuracy and delicate handling of paint, color, and texture. [...] “Asked whether she thought the rendering was accurate, Chase, 89, said the young artist had <b>gotten</b> <b>it</b> right. [...] “I told him, ‘You could have made me look like Halle Berry or Lena Horne, but you made it look like me,’” she said. [...] The painting Cutting Squash was acquired for its permanent collection by the Smithsonian National Portrait Gallery in 2011. [...] “We are always looking for portraits of nationally prominent figures,” National Portrait Gallery chief curator Brandon Fortune said. [...] “It is a very interesting image of a woman at work, doing a very simple task, cutting squash,” [...] [...] [...] “But in some ways it transcends the everyday and becomes something of national significance.” [...] This series reinforces Blache's commitment to documenting everyday labor and showcasing these intimate processes to the public. [...] Another one of the Smithsonian Institution Museums, National Museum of African History and Culture, came calling for another painting of Chase from the Blache series in 2013 and acquired Leah Red Coat Stirring (Sketch) in 2013, making it the third painting from Blache {{to be included in the}} permanent collection of the Smithsonian Institution.|$|E
