2500|$|The holotype skull is {{approximately}} [...] in length. Its body length {{is estimated at}} , its weight at [...] Nasutoceratops has several unique derived traits or autapomorphies. The part of the snout around the nostril is strongly developed, representing about {{three quarters of the}} skull length in front of the eye sockets. The rear of each nasal bone is hollowed out by a large internal cavity. The contact surface between the maxilla and the praemaxilla is exceptionally large. The maxilla also has a large <b>internal</b> <b>flange</b> contacting the praemaxilla via two horizontal facets. The brow horns at their bases are pointed forwards and outwards, then curve inwards, and ultimately twist their points upwards.|$|E
40|$|This {{invention}} {{is comprised}} of a tool for installing a gasket and a snap ring including a shaft, a first plate attached to the forward end of the shaft, a second plate slidably carried by the shaft, a spring disposed about the shaft {{between the first and}} second plates, and a sleeve that is free to slide over the shaft and engage the second plate. The first plate has a loading surface with a loading groove for receiving a snap ring and a shoulder for holding a gasket. A plurality of openings are formed through the first plate, communicating with the loading groove and approximately equally spaced about the groove. A plurality of rods are attached to the second plate, each rod slidable in one of the openings. In use, the loaded tool is inserted into a hollow pipe or pipe fitting having an <b>internal</b> <b>flange</b> and an internal seating groove, such that the gasket is positioned against the flange and the ring is in the approximate plane of the seating groove. The sleeve is pushed against the second plate, sliding the second plate towards the first plate, compressing the spring and sliding the rods forwards in the openings. The rods engage the snap ring and urge the ring from the loading groove into the seating groove...|$|E
50|$|<b>Internal</b> <b>flanges</b> {{and other}} {{configurations}} of re-entrant shapes are more costly to produce because they require special, more complex chucks or spinning without backup {{support for the}} work. Also, it is preferred to dimension parts to surfaces adjacent to the chuck (usually inside dimension). This allows the chuck maker to apply these dimensions directly to the chuck, and it avoids variations in diameter or length caused by variations in material thickness.|$|R
50|$|In the {{prototype}} a single Renault 220 HP twelve cylinder engine was installed, allowing a maximum speed of 10 km/h (6.2 mph) at 1200 rpm. The minimum speed was 2 km/h (1.24 mph). The transmission was mechanical, using a disc clutch. The sprocket {{was at the}} rear, the idler at the front. The suspension consisted of bogies, sprung by leaf springs, of four wheels each with alternating external and <b>internal</b> <b>flanges.</b> The tracks were 600 mm (23.6 in) wide, resulting in a ground pressure of 0.6 kg/cm². Ground clearance was 400 mm (15.7 in). The centre of gravity {{was in the middle}} of the vehicle, at a level of one metre above the ground. The design deliberately featured no overhanging front or rear sections, which had greatly hampered the mobility of the earlier French Schneider CA1 and Saint Chamond tanks. The tank could overcome a 1 m (3.3 ft) high vertical obstacle and cross a trench 3.5 m (11.5 ft) wide.|$|R
50|$|The {{original}} headstocks, now {{encased in}} concrete, are 610mm deep wrought iron girders of similar construction {{to the deck}} girders. Cast iron piles 2.4m and 1.2m sections and bolted through either <b>internal</b> or external <b>flanges</b> are used to support the headstocks. The piles are 610mm in diameter with 25mm thick wall. Attempts have been made, unsuccessfully, to fill the piles with concrete.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the {{calculation}} of gasket load drop caused by <b>internal</b> pressure at <b>flange</b> joints. The method published here makes possible {{to take into consideration}} the stiffness effect of the integrated part of the flange ring. The equations published refer to large size welding neck flanges but the method itself can be applied at any other types of flange joint, too. During the determination of the flange rotational stiffness the model shaped up by MURRAY and STUART [4] for calculating stress-state of welding neck flanges should have been made more precise. The preciseness of this method, as well as the convergence of trial-and-error calculations used were proved by results of calculations carried out on flange joint...|$|R
40|$|All-metal joints {{are widely}} used in the vacuum systems of {{particle}} accelerators. The most common ConFlat® design consists of a flat soft copper gasket captured between two stainless steel flanges with sharp edges (knives). The gasket is plastically deformed and a high contact pressure develops around knives to obtain leak tightness. For large accelerators, a high reliability and a cost-optimized design are required. A smooth <b>internal</b> transition between <b>flanges</b> is needed for the RF waveguides of the compact linear collider (CLIC), with limited deformation of the inner part of the gasket. We present the study of a flange meeting these requirements. First the finite element analysis (FEA) of the Stanford linear accelerator center (SLAC) X-band all-metal joint, which has a similar specification, is shown. Some drawbacks, such as non-homogeneous sealing properties, are highlighted. Then, a new joint design is described. FEA results are presented and are compared with experimental measurements carried out on prototypes...|$|R
40|$|Over {{the past}} years Fibre Reinforced Polymers, or FRP, have started making {{more of an}} {{appearance}} in civil engineering structures. They have the advantages that they are light-weight, do not corrode and theoretically require little maintenance during their lifespan. Originally {{they were used to}} construct reinforcement, cables and small bridges but more and more they are finding uses for larger scale structures. One of these newer applications is in lock gates. Locks are structures which are responsible for enabling water based transport while also retaining high water where necessary and are critical links in the water defence system of a region. Their gates also have a relatively large risk of collision due to the amount of moving vessels passing through them. In order to safely construct these lock gates from FRP laminates it is important that their response to such collision loads is well understood. This is the focus of this study with the aim to construct a model to help better understand the collision scenario. To make the theory concrete a case study is done on the lock gates of Sluis III which is situated in the Wilhelminakanaal in Tilburg. These gates are, at the time of writing, the largest FRP lock gates in the world. With the down stream gates being 13. 9 by 6. 3 meters. The event in which a Class III vessel collides with these gates will be examined in detail. The collision is schematised as a one dimensional collision using a series of springs and dampers to obtain understanding of the general collision behaviour. From this model it is concluded that the application of a load from the ship’s engine or taking elastic deformations of the ships bow into account has negligible influence of the results (in the order of 2 %), simplifying the calculations considerably. This simple model is later advanced in three ways: Two numerical finite element models are used to determine the structural response of the gate elements on a global and local scale and a more advanced analytical model is made to account for non-elastic deformation in the ship’s bow. The gate’s structure consists of multiple overlapping laminates which together form the skins of the gate. The numerical model is set up in two ways, one of which is used to determine the overall response of the gate element and the other to focus on the interlaminar resin layer in the skins. The results show that it is of importance to apply the load in a realistic manner as the results may vary widely depending on bow shape and point of impact. The approximation suggested in the Dutch codes in which the load is applied as a distributed load of a 0. 5 m 2 areas proved to be inaccurate. For this reason a dynamic LS-Dyna calculation is run using a rigid model of the ships bow to apply the load. The outcome of this analysis shows minor damage to the gate over a large area around to point of impact, but the stresses remain under the failure limit of the laminates except for the <b>internal</b> <b>flanges</b> directly under the impact. These flanges will fail, but this will not threaten the water retention of the gate. The stresses in the resin layer also remain under their critical limit. It can be concluded that the gate satisfies the requirements but significant repairs will be necessary to restore it to a fully operational state. The expanded analytical model is {{based on the fact that}} the force between the bow and the gate is larger than the failure load of the bow itself. The failure which will then take place will dissipate large portions of energy (in the order of 50 %) making the current approach, in which this does not take place, highly conservative. The model suggested here is a segmented failure model in which parts of the ship bow fail completely once their failure load in reached. The results of this model are dependent on a series of inputs based on the ships structure and the damping during collision, but for all input values within their expected regions it shows a significant reduction in the amount of the energy that must be retained by the gate as well as a decreased sensitivity to the, hard to predict, damping factor. This model shows potential to reduce material usage for lock gates in which collision are considered governing. With further refinement this model could be used during the design of future lock gates to come to a cheaper design. Experimental data would serve an important purpose during this refinement...|$|R
40|$|Rotation {{capacities}} {{obtained by}} a steel box girder with flat webs {{compare to the}} equivalent steel box girders with profiled webs are different. One of {{the objectives of the}} research presented in this thesis is to investigate if there is any improvement of plastic section rotation capacities steel box girder with profiled webs. All the tested specimens were loaded under four point bending. Three dimensional (3 D) computer models analysed using the finite element method were used throughout the study. Results from pre-existing experimental work for 1 - section steel girder were used to validate the results obtained from the finite element analysis. Consequently, establishment of steel box girders were made and then validated with the classical beam theory. Failure mode of steel box girders with profiled webs starts with yielding followed by local buckling of the compression flanges. Incline folds in profiled webs at the compression area are able to cope with higher stresses as compared to horizontal folds. Rotation capacity percentage increament of steel box girder with flat webs as compared to the equivalent steel box girders with profiled webs was about 99. 55 % with 0. 16 standard deviation. The increment is about,double the rotation capacity of a girder with flat webs to the girder with profiled webs. Hence, the contribution from webs was significant to the rotation capacity. Rotation capacities increase significantly as the flange thickness and web thickness increase. While, as the yield stress, <b>flange</b> <b>internal</b> element width and flange external element width of steel plate box girders with the profiled webs are increased, the rotation capacities experience reduction...|$|R
