5000|$|The {{bitterness}} of beer is measured {{according to the}} International Bitterness Units scale, with one IBU corresponding to one part-per-million of <b>isohumulone.</b> When beer is exposed to light, these compounds can decompose in a reaction catalyzed by riboflavin to generate free-radical species by the homolytic cleavage of the exocyclic carbon-carbon bond. The cleaved acyl side-chain radical then decomposes further, expelling carbon monoxide and generating 1,1-dimethylallyl radical. This radical can finally react with sulfur-containing amino acids, such as cysteine, to create 3-methylbut-2-ene-1-thiol, a thiol which causes beer to develop a [...] "skunky" [...] flavor.|$|E
50|$|Bitterness scales {{attempt to}} rate the {{perceived}} relative bitterness of beer. The bitterness of beer is provided by compounds such as humulones, or alpha acids from hops used during brewing. During the brewing process, humulone undergoes isomerization to form both cis- and trans- <b>isohumulone</b> which {{are responsible for the}} bitter taste of the beer. Likewise, hops contain lupulones, or beta acids. These beta acids are not considered in the initial bittering of the wort as much as their alpha acid counterparts since they do not isomerize through boiling, and therefore do not dissolve in the wort. However, beta acids can undergo oxidation and slowly contribute to the bitterness of the beer. This bitterness is harsher than the bitterness of the alpha acids and this flavor can be undesirable. The oxidation occurs over time through fermentation, storage, and aging. At the same time, isomerized alpha acids undergo degradation and reduce the bitterness of the beer.|$|E
40|$|The {{disappearance}} of riboflavin absorbance at 445 nm from beers or model beers on light exposure is {{directly linked to}} light-struck character formation.

50|$|Potentiometric {{titration}} is {{a useful}} tool for estimating the amounts of <b>isohumulones</b> in hops bitter substances, which are a large component of beer. <b>Isohumulones</b> are seen to combine with metals in stoichiometric proportions. This allows solutions of <b>isohumulones,</b> generally created by extracting <b>isohumulones</b> from hops using isooctane or petroleum and a liquid-liquid extraction, can be titrated with solutions of metal salts using changes in conductivity to determine an end point. The solutions of <b>isohumulones</b> can then be titrated against a metal salt such as nickel acetate or lead acetate. Readings of potential difference over time then give a titration curve in which potential will increase very slowly at first and then very rapidly. The rapid change in difference corresponds to all of the <b>isohumulones</b> reacting, signifying the end point of the reaction.|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{lipophilic}} extracts of {{the common}} hops (Humulus lupulus) contain compounds that are readily modified {{to the family of}} <b>isohumulones</b> (e. g., iso-alpha acids). The <b>isohumulones</b> have been found to reduce metabolic inflammation and insulin resistance, and positively impact dyslipidemia and obesity. These effects are consistent across studies in multiple cell lines, animal model systems and human intervention trials. Mechanistic work has demonstrated that these <b>isohumulones</b> have a unique pleiotropic mechanism of action which is consistent with their demonstrated safety and range of physiological effects. It is suggested from this extensive body of work that specific <b>isohumulones</b> may be important bioactive agents for the application in medical nutrition therapy in the support of diseases associated with chronic inflammation and insulin resistance...|$|R

40|$|ObjectiveIn a phase II {{clinical}} trial in nine obese, insulin-resistant humans, we observed that treatment with KDT 501, a novel <b>isohumulone</b> drug, increased total and high-molecular weight (HMW) adiponectin in plasma. The {{objective was to}} determine whether KDT 501 increased adiponectin secretion from subcutaneous white adipose tissue (SC WAT) and the underlying mechanism(s). MethodsNine obese participants with either prediabetes or with normal glucose tolerance plus three features of metabolic syndrome were part of the study. SC WAT biopsies were performed before and after 28 [*]days of KDT 501 treatment in a clinical research setting. In addition, a cold stimulus was used to induce thermogenic gene expression. Adiponectin secretion was measured, and gene expression of 130 genes involved in adipose tissue function was determined. The effect of KDT 501 on adipocyte mitochondrial function was analyzed in vitro. ResultsSC WAT explants secreted more total and HMW adiponectin after KDT 501 treatment (P[*]<[*] 0. 05). After KDT 501 treatment, a number of genes involved in thermogenesis and lipolysis were induced by cold (P[*]<[*] 0. 05). KDT 501 also potentiated β-adrenergic signaling (P[*]<[*] 0. 001) and enhanced mitochondrial function in adipocytes (P[*]<[*] 0. 001). ConclusionKDT 501 induced adiponectin secretion posttranscriptionally and increased gene expression of thermogenic and lipolytic genes in response to cold stimulation. These beneficial effects on SC WAT may be explained by the ability of KDT 501 to potentiate β-adrenergic signaling and enhance mitochondrial function in adipocytes.

Yet, during the first 3 months, they also appeared to be synthesized in the bottle, {{even in the absence}} of yeast. Fresh filtered lager beer was spiked with nonvolatile S-cysteine conjugates of 3 SHol, 3 S 3 MBol, and 3 -methylbut- 2 -en- 1 -thiol (MBT) before aging (1 to 3 months at 20 °C or 5 days at 40 or 60 °C). Thiol-specific para-hydroxymercuribenzoic acid extracts were analyzed by a GC-pulsed flame photometric detector, and HPLC-electrospray ionization/MS/MS was used to quantify the undegraded cysteinylated precursors. S-Cysteine conjugates were chemically degraded in the beer, releasing their corresponding thiols. The conversions were low (< 1 %) but could explain the trace amounts of 3 SHol and 3 S 3 MBol produced in beer during the first months of storage. On the other hand, chemical degradation of Cys-MBT in beer (although reaching up to 33 %) proved not to be efficient enough to release significant amounts of the skunky off-flavor. In this case, photooxidative degradation of <b>isohumulone</b> most probably remains the major synthesis pathway. Complementary analyses are now needed to determine how other beer constituents, such as dicarbonyls, might participate in cysteine adduct degradation.

In this study, we examined whether <b>isohumulones</b> ameliorate renal injury. Dahl salt-sensitive hypertensive rats were fed a low-salt diet (LS), a high-salt diet (HS) or a high-salt diet containing 0. 3 % <b>isohumulones</b> (HS+IH) for 4 weeks. Urinary nitrite/nitrate (NOx) excretion was mea-sured at 4 weeks along with blood pressure and urinary protein excretion. Renal injury was evaluated his-tologically and reactive oxygen species (ROS) and nitric oxide (NO) production in the renal cortex was visualized. Oxidative stress and NO synthase (NOS) expression were evaluated by immunohistochemical staining and Western blot analysis. Mean blood pressure was significantly decreased in the HS+IH group compared with the HS group at 4 weeks (158. 1 ± 8. 7 vs. 177. 5 ± 3. 7 mmHg; p< 0. 05). <b>Isohumulones</b> prevented the development of proteinuria in the HS+IH group compared with the HS group at 2 weeks (61. 7 ± 26. 8 vs. 117. 2 ± 9. 8 mg/day; p< 0. 05). Glomerulosclerosis and interstitial fibrosis scores were significantly decreased in the HS+IH group compared with the HS group (0. 61 ± 0. 11 vs. 1. 55 ± 0. 23, 23. 7 ± 6. 8 vs. 36. 1 ± 3. 5 %; p< 0. 05 for both). In the HS group, increased ROS and decreased NO were observed in glomeruli in vivo. Isohumu-lones reduced the ROS production, leading to the restoration of bioavailable NO. Urinary NOx excretion was significantly increased in the HS+IH group compared with the HS group. Furthermore, renal nitrotyrosine was increased in the HS group compared with the LS group, and this effect was prevented by <b>isohumulones.</b> Renal NOS expression did not differ among the three groups.

50|$|Probably {{the most}} {{important}} chemical compound within hops are the alpha acids or humulones. During wort boiling, the humulones are thermally isomerized into iso-alpha acids or <b>isohumulones,</b> which {{are responsible for the}} bitter taste of beer.|$|R
40|$|The iso-alpha-acids or <b>isohumulones</b> are {{the major}} {{contributors}} to the bitter taste of beer, and it is well-recognized that they are degraded during beer aging. In particular, the trans-isohumulones seem to be less stable than the cis-isohumulones. The major radical identified in beer is the 1 -hydroxyethyl radical; however, the reactivity between this radical and the <b>isohumulones</b> has not been reported until now. Therefore, we studied the reactivity of <b>isohumulones</b> toward the 1 -hydroxyethyl radical through a competitive kinetic approach. It was observed that both cis- and trans-isohumulones and dihydroisohumulones are decomposed {{in the presence of}} 1 -hydroxyethyl radicals, while the reactivities are comparable. On the other hand, the tetrahydroisohumulones did not react with 1 -hydroxyethyl radicals. The apparent second-order rate constants for the reactions between the 1 -hydroxyethyl radical and these compounds were determined by electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy and electrospray ionization-tandem mass spectrometry [ESI(+) -MS/MS]. It follows that degradation of beer bitter acids is highly influenced by the presence of 1 -hydroxyethyl radicals. The reaction products were detected by liquid chromatography electrospray ionization-ion trap-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-ESI-IT-MS/MS), and the formation of oxidized derivatives of the <b>isohumulones</b> was confirmed.

40|$|Background: Humulus lupulus(hops) {{have long}} been used in beer brewing for their {{antimicrobial}} and bittering properties. Hops contain alpha acids, which during the boiling process of beer, get isomerized into iso-alpha-acids also called <b>isohumulones.</b> Research has postulated that daily supplementation with concentrated hop extract could help to reduce visceral obesity in healthy overweight adults. The goal of this systematic review is to summarize recent research on hop extract {{and its role in}} reducing visceral obesity. Methods: An exhaustive search of the available medical literature was performed using MEDLINE-Ovid, Web of Science, CINAHL, and MEDLINE-PubMed. Keywords included hops, hop extract, humulus lupulus, <b>isohumulones,</b> alpha acids, iso-alpha-acids, matured hop bittering acids, alpha-acid axides, mature hop extract, visceral obesity, obesity, and beer. Articles that were relevant were assessed for quality using GRADE. Results: Six articles were found after an exhaustive search of the literature. Two studies fit the criteria and were used for this systematic review. Both studies were randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled trials. Each study was conducted in an outpatient research setting utilizing matured or isomerized hop extract in the form of capsules or liquid drink. Using computed tomography, both studies successfully showed a reduction in visceral obesity utilizing hop extract on a day-to-day basis. Dose dependent improvement in reduction of visceral obesity was shown in one study. Conclusion: Utilizing isomerized or matured hop extract on a day-to-day basis can help reduce visceral obesity in overweight healthy adults. The most benefits are seen with dosages greater than 38 mg per day of isomerized hop extract and at least 35 mg of matured hop extract. Given the ease of creation of hop extract, it should be considered as an adjunctive treatment to diet and exercise for visceral obesity. Further research is still required to determine if results are comparable with larger and more diverse populations and to determine if any risk is involved with supplementation.

In this thesis, studies involving quality issues of two plants used in the production of two popular beverages, hops (in beer) and Ilex paraguariensis (yerba mate) were undertaken. Hops are used as bittering agents and to increase foam stability in beer brewing. The compounds responsible for this are cis/trans <b>isohumulones,</b> produced by isomerisation of the 3 α-acids present in hops. To evaluate their individual effect, they had to be obtained in gram-scale amounts. For this, 3 methods based on the use of CPC (centrifugal partition chromatography) in combination with selective precipitation methods (DCHA) of trans-isomers were developed. Trans-isohumulones were found to precipitate selectively with β-cyclodextrin. Yerba mate is a popular tea-like beverage consumed in S America made from the leaves of Ilex paraguariensis, a species unique for its high caffeine content. The detection of adulterants i. e., cogeneric authoctonous Ilex species is vital for its quality control. The metabolomic profile of 11 Ilex species was determined, resulting in the clear separation of all species. Additionally, arbutin was detected (0. 5 - 10 % dw) in several of the tested species but not in I. paraguariensis, though its presence had not been formerly reported. Promotors: R. Verpoorte, P. G.
