5|$|As a whole, {{pinnipeds}} can {{be found}} in a variety of aquatic habitats, including coastal water, open ocean, brackish water and even freshwater lakes and rivers. Most species inhabit coastal areas, though some travel offshore and feed in deep waters off oceanic islands. The Baikal seal is the only freshwater species, though some ringed seals live in freshwater lakes in Russia close to the Baltic sea. In addition, harbor seals may visit estuaries, lakes and rivers and sometimes stay as long as a year. Other species known to enter freshwater include California sea lions and South American sea lions. Pinnipeds also use a number of terrestrial habitats and substrates, both continental and island. In temperate and tropical areas, they haul-out on to sandy and pebble beaches, rocky shores, shoals, mud flats, tide pools and in sea caves. Some species also rest on man-made structures, like piers, jetties, buoys and oil platforms. Pinnipeds may move further inland and rest in sand dunes or vegetation, and may even climb cliffs. Polar-living species haul-out on to both <b>fast</b> <b>ice</b> and drift ice.|$|E
5|$|Other seals, {{like the}} walrus and most phocids, breed on ice with {{copulation}} usually {{taking place in}} the water (a few land-breeding species also mate in water). Females of these species tend to aggregate less. In addition, since ice is less stable than solid land, breeding sites change location each year, and males are unable to predict where females will stay during the breeding season. Hence polygyny tends to be weaker in ice-breeding species. An exception to this is the walrus, where females form dense aggregations perhaps due to their patchy food sources. Pinnipeds that breed on <b>fast</b> <b>ice</b> tend to cluster together more than those that breed on pack ice. Some of these species are serially monogamous, including the harp seal, crabeater seal and hooded seal. Seals that breed on ice tend to have little or no sexual dimorphism. In lobodontine seals, females are slightly longer than males. Walruses and hooded seals are unique among ice-breeding species in that they have pronounced sexual dimorphism in favor of males.|$|E
5|$|Pinnipeds {{are also}} {{targeted}} by terrestrial and pagophilic predators. The polar bear is well adapted for hunting Arctic seals and walruses, particularly pups. Bears {{are known to}} use sit-and-wait tactics as well as active stalking and pursuit of prey on ice or water. Other terrestrial predators include cougars, brown hyenas and various species of canids, which mostly target the young. Pinnipeds lessen the chance of predation by gathering in groups. Some species are capable of inflicting damaging wounds on their attackers with their sharp canines—an adult walrus is capable of killing polar bears. When out at sea, northern elephant seals dive {{out of the reach}} of surface-hunting orcas and white sharks. In the Antarctic, which lacks terrestrial predators, pinniped species spend more time on the ice than their Arctic counterparts. Arctic seals use more breathing holes per individual, appear more restless when hauled out, and rarely defecate on the ice. Ringed seals build dens underneath <b>fast</b> <b>ice</b> for protection.|$|E

25|$|Because Bear Island lies on a {{boundary}} between cold water of polar origin and warmer Atlantic water, water temperatures {{within a few}} dozen nautical miles of the island are quite variable, sometimes reaching 10°C (50°F) in summer.

25|$|The Larsen D Ice Shelf {{is between}} Smith Peninsula {{in the south}} and Gipps Ice Rise. It is {{considered}} to be generally stable.

500|$|Humans have {{travelled}} the sea since prehistoric times, originally on rafts and in dugout, reed, and bark canoes.

2500|$|It {{is usually}} {{considered}} a rare mineral, {{but this is}} likely due to difficulty in preserving samples. It was first discovered in nature by the Danish mineralogist Pauly in the Ikka (then spelt Ika) fjord in southwest Greenland, close to Ivigtut, the locality of the famous cryolite deposit. Here ikaite occurs in truly spectacular towers or columns (up to [...] tall) growing out of the fjord floor towards the surface water, where they are naturally truncated by waves, or unnaturally by the occasional boat. At the Ikka Fjord, {{it is believed that}} the ikaite towers are created {{as the result of a}} groundwater seep, rich in carbonate and bicarbonate ions, entering the fjord bottom in the form of springs, where it hits the marine fjord waters rich in calcium. Ikaite has also been reported as occurring in high-latitude marine sediments at Bransfield Strait, Antarctica; Sea of Okhotsk, Eastern Siberia, off Sakhalin; and Saanich Inlet, British Columbia, Canada. In addition it has been reported in a deep sea fan off the Congo, and therefore probably has worldwide occurrence. The most recent occurrence has been reported by Dieckmann et al. (2008). They found the mineral ikaite directly precipitated in grain sizes of hundreds of micrometers in sea ice in the Weddell Sea and throughout <b>fast</b> <b>ice</b> off Adélie Land, Antarctica. In addition, ikaite can also form large crystals within sediment that grow to macroscopic size, occasionally with good crystal form. There is strong evidence that some of these marine deposits are associated with cold seeps.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Fast</b> <b>ice</b> (also called land-fast ice, landfast ice, and shore-fast ice) is sea {{ice that}} is [...] "fastened" [...] to the coastline, {{to the sea}} floor along shoals or to {{grounded}} icebergs. <b>Fast</b> <b>ice</b> may either grow in place from the sea water or by freezing pieces of drifting ice to the shore or other anchor sites. Unlike drift (or pack) ice, <b>fast</b> <b>ice</b> does not move with currents and winds.|$|E
50|$|The width (and the presence) of this ice zone {{is usually}} {{seasonal}} and depends on ice thickness, topography {{of the sea}} floor and islands. It ranges from a few meters to several hundred kilometers. Seaward expansion {{is a function of}} a number of factors, notably water depth, shoreline protection, time of year and pressure from the pack ice. The topography of the <b>fast</b> <b>ice</b> varies from smooth and level to rugged (when submitted to large pressures). The ice foot refers to ice that has formed at the shoreline, through multiple freezing of water between ebb tides, and is separated by the remainder of the <b>fast</b> <b>ice</b> surface by tidal cracks. Further away from the coastline, the ice may become anchored to the sea bottom—it is then referred to as bottomfast ice. <b>Fast</b> <b>ice</b> can survive one or more melting seasons (i.e. summer), in which case it can be designated following the usual age-based categories: first-year, second-year, multiyear. The <b>fast</b> <b>ice</b> boundary is the limit between <b>fast</b> <b>ice</b> and drift (or pack) ice—in places, this boundary may coincide with a shear ridge. <b>Fast</b> <b>ice</b> may be delimited or enclose pressure ridges which extend sufficiently downward so as to be grounded—these features are known as stamukhi.|$|E
