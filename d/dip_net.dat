50|$|This fish {{is caught}} at night using kapenta rigs, these rigs use mercury lights {{connected}} to portable generators {{to attract the}} fish to the rig. A <b>dip</b> <b>net</b> measuring roughly six metres in diameter and around 8 to 10 metres in length is then used to bring the fish up from anything from 40 metres (130 ft).|$|E
50|$|Some {{species of}} smelts {{are among the}} few fish that sportsmen {{have been allowed to}} <b>net,</b> using {{hand-held}} <b>dip</b> <b>nets,</b> either along the coastline or in streams. Some sportsmen also ice fish for smelt. They are often fried and eaten whole.|$|R
5000|$|Adult alewives {{are caught}} during their spring {{spawning}} migration upstream by being scooped out of shallow, constricted areas using large <b>dip</b> <b>nets.</b> They are the preferred bait {{for the spring}} lobster fishery in Maine, [...] and are eaten by humans, usually smoked.|$|R
50|$|Historically, fish, {{especially}} salmon, {{comprised the}} main part of the Hän diet. King salmon was caught along the Yukon River in June and chum salmon in August.

5000|$|In the Canadian {{provinces and}} U.S. states around the Great Lakes, [...] "smelt dipping" [...] {{is a common}} group sport {{in the early spring}} and when stream waters reach around 4 °C, (40-42 °F). Fish are spotted using a {{flashlight}} or headlamp and scooped out of the water using a <b>dip</b> <b>net</b> made of nylon or metal mesh. The smelt are cleaned by removing the head and the entrails. Fins, scales, and bones of all but the largest of smelts are cooked without removal.|$|E
50|$|These are passive {{gears and}} their {{position}} {{as well as}} their nature and the effective fishing period, remained unchanged during the last centuries. The so-called independent fishermen who fish mainly with lights, spears and longlines use the non-leased area of the lagoon system. Furthermore, gill <b>nets</b> and <b>dip</b> <b>nets</b> are also used in the lagoon all over the year.|$|R
50|$|Hand nets {{have been}} widely used by {{traditional}} fishermen. Small fish are caught both in the shallow water of lagoons and in the open sea. They are made in different sizes ranging from small nets held in one hand to large scoop nets worked by several men. Historically, the Karuk people of the upper Klamath River harvested fish with <b>dip</b> <b>nets.</b>|$|R
50|$|The Klallam fished {{year round}} {{using a variety}} of tools and {{techniques}} particular to the species, location, and season. They were known to use traps, trolling, gillnets, spears, rakes, <b>dip</b> <b>nets,</b> and holes dug in the beach. Specific locations were known to produce certain fishes at the right time of year, and special implements and skills were employed for a successful catch.|$|R
50|$|Electrofishing {{relies on}} two {{electrodes}} which deliver direct current at high-voltage from the anode to the cathode through the water. When a fish encounters {{a large enough}} potential gradient on this path, it becomes affected by the electricity. Usually pulsed direct current (DC) is applied, which causes galvanotaxis in the fish. Galvanotaxis is uncontrolled muscular convulsion that results in the fish swimming toward the anode. At least two people are required for an effective electrofishing crew: one to operate the anode, {{and the other to}} catch the stunned fish with a <b>dip</b> <b>net.</b>|$|E
50|$|The Kayal {{directly}} {{serves as}} the means of livelihood of thousands of fishermen. The chief catch is grey millets and prawns. The main fishing season is from October to January during the season the Kayal will {{be connected to the}} sea. The majority of fish are caught using any one of cast net, gill net, scare net, seine net, <b>dip</b> <b>net,</b> ring net, scoope net or trap. Arattupuzha, a fishing village on the bank of Kayamkulam Kayal, is famous for chakara mud formation resulting from thronging of large amount of fish and prawns.|$|E
50|$|The SMCA protects {{marine life}} by {{limiting}} the removal of marine wildlife from within its borders. Swami’s SMCA prohibits take of all living marine resources except: recreational take of coastal pelagic species, except market squid by hand-held <b>dip</b> <b>net</b> only, is allowed. Commercial take of coastal pelagic species, except market squid, by round haul net only is allowed. Take pursuant to beach nourishment and other sediment management activities and operation and maintenance of artificial structures inside the conservation area is allowed per any required federal, state and local permits, or as otherwise authorized by the department.|$|E
5000|$|In the Russian River SMRMA, {{the taking}} of all living marine {{resources}} except recreational hunting of waterfowl is prohibited, unless otherwise restricted by hunting regulations. In the Russian River SMCA, {{the taking of}} all living marine resources is prohibited, except the recreational and commercial trapping of Dungeness crab and the taking of Hypomesus pretiosus (surf smelt) by hand-held <b>dip</b> <b>nets</b> or beach nets.|$|R
40|$|John Ducey’s fish {{store is}} {{located near the}} {{shoreline}} in Keels, close to where the trap skiffs and other boats are drawn {{up out of the}} water. It was built in the early to mid- 1950 s by Reg Chapman and Isaac Penny, who used the space for net mending. The Ducey family purchased the store in the early 1980 s. The building’s primary function at the moment is as a storage facility [...] housing <b>dip</b> <b>nets,</b> gill nets, balloons, squid jiggers, lump gear, graples, buoy ropes, boat motors, flakes, furniture, and a slide for hauling wood. John also occasionally uses the space as a workshop when he repairs motors...|$|R
40|$|The Central Marine Fisheries Research Institute (CMFRI) has {{suggested}} that light fishing (fishing using lights) be banned within 12 nautical miles of the territorial waters to protect the interests of traditional fishers. However, a study report released by the research organisation here on Saturday said traditional light fishing practices using Chinese <b>dip</b> <b>nets</b> and boat seines and trammel nets in certain districts of the State may be kept outside {{the purview of the}} recommendation...|$|R
50|$|The ditch {{was first}} dug circa 1665 by English {{settlers}} and Native Americans {{as the first}} public works project on Nantucket. It runs roughly southwest for about 1 mile, and was cut as freshwater channels running through freshwater cattail marsh and salt marsh, {{in order to create}} more meadow and catch fish running through it in a weir. Fish runs have historically included perch, herring, smelt, and eels. In the early 20th century, a large <b>dip</b> <b>net,</b> about four feet in diameter and eight feet long, subconical in shape, was used instead of a weir to scoop up fish.|$|E
50|$|When boat electrofishing, {{the boat}} {{itself is the}} cathode, and the anode(s) are {{generally}} mounted off the bow. The stunned fish swim toward the anode, where they are caught alive using a <b>dip</b> <b>net.</b> Towed barge electrofishers operate similarly to backpack electrofishers, with the exception that the generator is located on a floating barge instead of on a backpack. Often the barge can be left stationary on the shore and longer cathodes and anodes allow the crew to sample large areas. Barge electrofishers often employ gas-powered generators since a user {{does not have to}} carry the extra weight on his or her back.|$|E
50|$|The Cree of the Hudson Bay Lowlands used weirs {{consisting}} of a fence of poles and a trap across fast flowing rivers. The fish were channelled by the poles up a ramp and into a box-like structure made of poles lashed together. The top of the ramp remained {{below the surface of}} the water but slightly above the top of the box so that the flow of the water and the overhang of the ramp stopped the fish from escaping from the box. The fish were then scooped out of the box with a <b>dip</b> <b>net.</b>|$|E

5000|$|Hand nets - {{are small}} nets held open by a hoop. They {{have been used}} since antiquity. They are also called scoop nets, and are used for {{scooping}} up fish near {{the surface of the}} water. They {{may or may not have}} a handle-if they have a long handle they are called <b>dip</b> <b>nets.</b> When used by anglers to help land fish they are called landing nets. Because hand netting is not destructive to fish, hand nets are used for tag and release, or capturing aquarium fish.|$|R
25|$|Historically, in late May {{and early}} June, Nez Perce villagers crowded to {{communal}} fishing sites to trap eels, steelhead, and chinook salmon, or haul in fish with large <b>dip</b> <b>nets.</b> Fishing took place {{throughout the summer}} and fall, first on the lower streams {{and then on the}} higher tributaries, and catches also included salmon, sturgeon, whitefish, suckers, and varieties of trout. Most of the supplies for winter use came from a second run in the fall, when large numbers of Sockeye salmon, silver, and dog salmon appeared in the rivers.|$|R
