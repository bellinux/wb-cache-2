5|$|Items 77–81 <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>code</b> {{have been}} {{interpreted}} as {{a description of a}} woman's financial rights after a divorce or legal separation. These clauses define how much of the household goods a woman could keep in different circumstances, depending on whether she keeps custody of the children, for example. It has recently been suggested, however, that it would be more correct to interpret these clauses as referring to women who are widowed, rather than divorced.|$|E

Ultimately this backfired in 1934 when a billboard in Philadelphia was placed outside the home of Cardinal Dennis Dougherty. Severely offended, Dougherty took his revenge by helping to launch the motion-picture boycott which would later facilitate enforcement of the Code. A commonly repeated theme by those supporting censorship, and one mentioned <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Code</b> itself was {{the notion that the}} common people needed to be saved from themselves by the more refined cultural elite.Massey, pg. 71.|$|E

Jan Mayen is a remote island in the Arctic Ocean; it has no permanent population and is administrated by the County Governor of Nordland. Svalbard and Jan Mayen have in common that they are the only integrated parts of Norway not allocated to counties. While a separate ISO code for Svalbard was proposed by the United Nations, it was the Norwegian authorities who took initiative to include Jan Mayen <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>code.</b> Its official language is Norwegian.|$|E
30|$|Since {{the cross}} layer {{interactions}} (CLI) between different layers are exploited in simulations of random network, {{it is essential}} to investigate the contributions of the cross layer interactions with coverage control and topology control. To solve this problem, <b>the</b> <b>coding</b> opportunities are classified into four categories: (1) No cross layer interaction is involved <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>coding</b> opportunity, marked as No CLI; (2) interactions with coverage control are involved <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>coding</b> opportunity, marked as With CC; (3) interactions with topology control are involved <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>coding</b> opportunity, marked as With TC; and (4) interactions with coverage control and topology control are both involved <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>coding</b> opportunity, marked as With TC & CC.|$|R

5|$|The oldest {{medical records}} show that {{epilepsy}} has been affecting people {{at least since the}} beginning of recorded history. Throughout ancient history, the disease was thought to be a spiritual condition. The world's oldest description of an epileptic seizure comes from a text in Akkadian (a language used in ancient Mesopotamia) and was written around 2000 BC. The person described in the text was diagnosed as being under the influence of a Moon god, and underwent an exorcism. Epileptic seizures are listed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Code</b> of Hammurabi (c. 1790 BC) as reason for which a purchased slave may be returned for a refund, and the Edwin Smith Papyrus (c. 1700 BC) describes cases of individuals with epileptic convulsions.|$|E
