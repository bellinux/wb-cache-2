40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the relationships among}} management control systems (<b>control</b> extent, <b>formal</b> and social <b>control</b> mechanisms), inter-firm trust (goodwill and competence trust) and relational performance in Australian inter-organizational relationships (IORs). Using survey data from 232 Australian IORs, structure equation modelling (SEM) was applied to analyse direct and indirect (mediation and moderation) relationships. The analysis indicates {{that the use of}} tight controls and social control mechanisms are positively associated with goodwill trust, competence trust and relational performance. The use of <b>formal</b> <b>controls</b> is also positively related to goodwill trust and relational performance, although no direct association was found between <b>formal</b> <b>controls</b> and competence trust. Both goodwill trust and competence trust present strong positive associations with inter-organizational performance. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the positive relationships between the use of tight controls and social controls, on one hand and relationship performance, on the other hand, are fully mediated by goodwill trust and competence trust. There were no mediation effects found for neither goodwill trust nor competence trust on the direct positive relationship between <b>formal</b> <b>controls</b> and relational performance. Goodwill trust and competence trust have different influences on the configuration of management control systems in IORs. Tight use of controls and social controls help with inter-firm trust-building and IOR performance through both goodwill trust and competence trust. <b>Formal</b> <b>controls</b> can both directly improve relationship performance and develop goodwill trust, but no evidence shows <b>formal</b> <b>controls</b> help in competence trust-building. 45 page(s...|$|R

40|$|Prior {{literature}} {{stresses the}} importance for manufacturers to use <b>formal</b> and informal <b>controls</b> to coordinate collaborative new product development activities with suppliers. In doing so, the existence of trust between manufacturers and suppliers is believed to {{play a key role}} because it enables manufacturers to reduce investments in <b>formal</b> <b>controls</b> and rely more on less costly informal controls. Manufacturers and suppliers don't suddenly trust each other though: trust typically grows over time as the partners get to know each other. Trust may also decrease if manufacturers overuse <b>formal</b> <b>controls</b> or if suppliers underperform. These fluctuations in trust over the course of supplier–manufacturer relationships complicate the so-called trust–control nexus and raise important questions about the impact of trust on the efficiency and effectiveness of <b>formal</b> and informal <b>controls</b> as coordination mechanisms. Therefore, this study examines how manufacturers should balance <b>formal</b> and informal <b>controls</b> over time to reap the full benefits of collaborative product development with suppliers. For that purpose, a conceptual and system dynamics model are developed, which incorporate the links among <b>formal</b> and informal <b>controls,</b> trust, and the supplier's development performance. In an empirical validation {{in the context of the}} shipbuilding industry, the results reject the notion that manufacturers must lessen <b>formal</b> <b>controls</b> and increase informal controls with trust. Instead, it is most efficient and effective to invest always in <b>formal</b> <b>controls,</b> particularly process control, to coordinate supplier involvement in new product development. These results have important theoretical and managerial implications: Informal controls are not as profitable as expected...|$|R

5|$|Major {{cities and}} {{regional}} rivalry {{played an important}} role in the wars. The disappearance of a central, imperial authority—and in some cases of even a local, viceregal authority (as in the cases of New Granada and Río de la Plata)—initiated a prolonged period of balkanization in many regions of Spanish America. It was not clear which political units which should replace the empire, and there were no new national identities to replace the traditional sense of being Spaniards. The original juntas of 1810 appealed first, to a sense of being Spanish, which was counterposed to the French threat; second, to a general American identity, which was counterposed to the Peninsula lost to the French; and third, to a sense of belonging to the major cities or local province, the patria in Spanish. More often than not, juntas sought to maintain a province's independence from the capital of the former viceroyalty or captaincy general as much as from the Peninsula itself. Armed conflicts broke out between the provinces over the question of whether some cities or provinces were to be subordinate to others as they had been under the crown. This phenomenon was particularly evident in South America. This rivalry also leads some regions to adopt the opposite political cause to that chosen by their rivals. Peru seems to have remained strongly royalist in large part because of its rivalry with Río de la Plata, to which it had lost control of Upper Peru when the latter was elevated to a viceroyalty in 1776. The creation of juntas in Río de la Plata allowed Peru to regain <b>formal</b> <b>control</b> of Upper Peru for the duration of the wars.|$|E

40|$|Information systems {{outsourcing}} {{is not a}} new phenomenon. It {{has evolved}} over time and has been widely used by organisations to reach their goals mainly through lowering operational costs and mitigating risks. Building a long-term relationship between a client and a vendor in the outsourcing environment is one {{of the ways in which}} to sustain amidst fierce global competition, reposition in value networks and achieve business benefits. Trust and <b>formal</b> <b>controls</b> are critical in contemporary IS outsourcing arrangements. Trust has been recognised as the relationship factor that facilitates the development and further maintenance of outsourcing relationships, while <b>formal</b> <b>controls</b> have been treated as the governance mechanism that coordinates the ongoing progress of the outsourcing arrangement according to the signed contract. The complementary relationship between trust and <b>formal</b> <b>controls</b> in managing IS outsourcing arrangements has received a lot attention in the literature due to the better outcomes it promises. Although existing research on the combination between trust and <b>formal</b> <b>controls</b> does offer interesting insights, it is largely descriptive and, does not establish a sound conceptual base for the nature of such combination. In this thesis, I investigate the trust-control nexus in the dynamic nature of IS outsourcing arrangements and argue that the balance, as a complementary relationship between trust and controls can have different effects on the perceptions of outcomes in the IS outsourcing context. Drawing from theories adapted from IS outsourcing and organisational studies, I conceptualise balance as a ‘comfort zone’ between trust and <b>formal</b> <b>controls</b> and define three types of balance (antithetical, orthogonal, synergistic), in which the outsourcing stakeholders make deliberate changes to adapt to the outsourcing environment in order to achieve high service quality and good outsourcing relationships. In doing so, a conceptual framework has been developed to explain how the balance between trust and <b>formal</b> <b>controls</b> is achieved and further evolved over time in the IS outsourcing arrangements. For this purpose, a qualitative research approach and multiple case study methodology have been selected. In particular, five outsourcing case studies have been employed with a total number of 30 in-depth interviews conducted with more than 20 outsourcing stakeholders across three organisational levels (i. e. executive, management and operational) from both client and vendor organisations. The data collected has been further analysed to reveal that the actions of clients and vendors oscillate between different trust and <b>formal</b> <b>controls</b> activities, which led to the formation of three different types of the balance conditional on the degree of dependence between trust and <b>formal</b> <b>controls.</b> In particular, it has been found that trust and <b>formal</b> <b>controls</b> can be negatively related (i. e. antithetical balance), they can co-exist but not impact on one another (i. e. orthogonal balance) and they can be mutually reinforcing and, thus, one can impact on another (i. e. synergistic balance). Based on the derived perceptions of the participants, the study also explores different effects of the balance on the perception of the achieved outsourcing outcomes. Consequently, the synergistic and orthogonal types of balance have been found to be appropriate (and effective) in pursuing outsourcing outcomes in relation to project performance and relationship satisfaction, whereas the antithetical balance has been found to be ineffective and too risky to pursue in IS outsourcing arrangements. Also, the case study findings have revealed that the balance is dynamic and emergent concept and therefore, can change throughout the life of the IS outsourcing arrangement. Overall, the study provides a new way to understand the balance between trust and <b>formal</b> <b>controls</b> in IS outsourcing arrangements and explains how balance impacts outsourcing outcomes through uncovering interpretive patterns of different combinations between trust and <b>formal</b> <b>controls.</b> For practitioners, the research offers recommendations on whether there is a ‘right’ balance to ensure better outcomes for both outsourcing parties involved and how the balance can be changed throughout the course of the outsourcing arrangement...|$|R

40|$|Information systems (IS) {{outsourcing}} projects {{often fail}} to achieve initial goals. To avoid project failure, managers need to design <b>formal</b> <b>controls</b> that meet the specific contextual demands of the project. However, the dynamic and uncertain nature of IS outsourcing projects {{makes it difficult to}} design such specific <b>formal</b> <b>controls</b> at the outset of a project. It is hence crucial to translate high-level project goals into specific <b>formal</b> <b>controls</b> {{during the course of a}} project. This study seeks to understand the underlying patterns of such translation processes. Based on a comparative case study of four outsourced software development projects, we inductively develop a process model that consists of three unique patterns. The process model shows that the performance implications of emergent controls with higher specificity depend on differences in the translation process. Specific <b>formal</b> <b>controls</b> have positive implications for goal achievement if only the stakeholder context is adapted, while they are negative for goal achievement if in the translation process tasks are unintendedly adapted. In the latter case projects incrementally drift away from their initial direction. Our findings help to better understand control dynamics in IS outsourcing projects. We contribute to a process theoretic understanding of IS outsourcing governance and we derive implications for control theory and the IS project escalation literature...|$|R

25|$|The site of {{the church}} and former monastery of San Juan Bautista was a teocalli, or sacred precinct, {{dedicated}} to a god of commerce called Yacapitzauac. This teocalli was destroyed by the Spanish under Gonzalo de Sandoval when he captured and sacked the settlement in 1521. This teocalli and god were the center of the pre-Hispanic community. The Franciscans were the first to arrive in the 1520s to evangelize the local population and they built a small church on the site. However, this church was destroyed in a fire. The Augustinians took over evangelization in the 1530s and formally established the monastery, dedicated to John the Baptist. This figure was chosen because Yacapitzauac was depicted with a staff as a sign of his authority, and John the Baptist is often depicted with a staff. Most of the monastery was constructed between 1535 and 1540. At that time, there was sufficient income to the order to not only finish much of the monastery in a short time, but also to add a number of fine details. Construction of a number of smaller elements continued until 1586. The complex presents similarities with others built by the Augustinians in eastern Morelos at this time, such as a stone wall around the perimeter and the use of merlons, which give these monasteries the look of a medieval castle. Due to the diminishing importance of Yecapixtla, the monastery was mostly abandoned by the 17th century, with the Augustinians losing <b>formal</b> <b>control</b> {{of the church and}} community in the mid 18th century. The complex remained mostly untouched until the late 19th century, when Father José Pilar Sandoval did some remodeling work in the main nave of the church. More restoration work was undertaken by Father Evaristo Nava in the early 20th century, which included the addition of an organ and changing the sacristy into a tabernacle. In 1994, the complex became part of the Monasteries on the Slopes of Popocatépetl World Heritage Site.|$|E
