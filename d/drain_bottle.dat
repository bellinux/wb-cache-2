40|$|Session - Pleural Global Case ReportsINTRODUCTION: The first written {{documentation}} of acupuncture {{dates back to}} the 100 BC in the Chinese literature Huangdi Neijing, this form of alternative therapy has become increasingly popular globally in the last 20 to 30 years. While viewed by many as an effective means for pain relief, one should also be aware of the possible complications associated with this procedure. CASE PRESENTATION: We present a case of a 45 year old man, with unremarkable past health, who had been a smoker for 20 years. On the day before admission, he went to an acupuncturist for neck pain, who subsequently inserted acupuncture needles over his left supraclavicular region and back. At the time the supraclavicular acupuncture needle was removed, he experienced sudden onset left chest pain and dyspnoea. He then presented to the emergency department where a chest x-ray showed left pneumothorax and left pleural effusion. A chest drain was inserted, and he was admitted to our surgical ward. Over the next 24 hours, the chest <b>drain</b> <b>bottle</b> had accumulated 1 litre of heavily blood stained fluid. The haemoglobin drop over these 24 hours was from 12. 8 to 11. 4 g/dL. On repeated chest x-ray, there was partial re-expansion of the left lung, with residual rim of apical pneumothorax and apical collection of fluid. At this point, we decided to go into theatre. On left video assisted thoracoscopy (VAT) exploration, there was approximately 400 ml of blood clots in left pleural space. A fibrovascular adhesion band over the left upper lobe apex was torn with slow active bleeding from the parietal pleura end of the band. Haemostasis was achieved with diathermy. Mechanical pleurodesis was performed using Prolene mesh abrasion to the parietal pleura. The patient was discharged home on post-operative day 3 with the lung fully expanded on chest x-ray. DISCUSSION: Previous systemic reviews of the adverse events associated with acupuncture concluded that minor adverse events may be considerable but serious events were rare. Pneumothorax was rare, occurring only twice in nearly {{a quarter of a million}} treatments. A review in 2004 found reported a total of 715 cases with acupuncture associated adverse events. Within the 715 reports, there were 191 cases of pneumothorax and one case of haemothorax. A systemic review in 2012 of Chinese literature from 1956 - 2010 found 167 articles with 1038 cases. The most frequent adverse events were syncope (468 cases) and pneumothorax (307 cases). There is one reported case of mortality from acupuncture-induced pneumothorax, the patient died because of bilateral tension pneumothorax. Most of the reported cases of acupuncture-induced pneumothorax do not require surgery, but because of the associated substantial haemothorax in our case, surgery was warranted. CONCLUSIONS: Due to the increasing popularity of alternative therapy, medical practitioners should also be aware of other forms of therapy and their associated complications. link_to_OA_fulltex...|$|E

In my own case there was a severe tussle between Dr. Warburg and Fever-fiend. The attacks had changed from a tertian to a quotidian, and every new paroxysm left me, like the 'possessed' of Holy Writ after the expulsion of 'devils,' utterly prostrate.

50|$|Drainage of the pleural cavity is {{achieved}} by the surgeon making a primary incision in the skin followed by a second incision through the muscle between the ribs. This way a tube may be guided into the chest to allow for drainage. Chest tubes are designed to collect this drainage and prevent anything from leaking back into the pleural space. This is accomplished by a check valve, usually part of a specialized drainage system with an underwater seal. Depending {{on the amount of}} air/fluid to be <b>drained,</b> the collection <b>bottle</b> may need to be periodically changed.|$|R
50|$|To obtain patís, {{fermentation}} is longer, usually taking {{six months}} to a year. During the longer fermentation processes, the fish or shrimp constituents disintegrate further, producing a clear yellowish liquid on top of the mixture due to hydrolysis. This is the patis, it can be harvested once it has developed its characteristic smell. It is <b>drained,</b> pasteurized, and <b>bottled</b> separately, while the residue is turned into bagoong. If the residual solids are not moist enough, brine is usually added. The rate of fermentation can vary depending on the pH levels of the mixture and the temperature. Exposure to sunlight can also reduce the amount of time required to two months.|$|R

The similarity of the two bottles was the real suggestion. He laid his pistol parts on the table and mixed himself a long drink. Standing as he did between Koho and the table, he interchanged the two <b>bottles,</b> <b>drained</b> his glass, made as if to search for something, and left the room. From outside he heard the surprised splutter and cough; but when he returned the old chief sat as before. The liniment in the bottle, however, was lower, and it still oscillated.|$|R
40|$|Introduction: In some cases, {{spontaneous}} pneumothorax may require surgery, but in poor risk patients, pleurodesis {{may be a}} reasonable choice. Pleurodedis with autologous blood necessitates the clampage of the chest tube for a period. Excess air leakage from the chest tube may avoid the clampage. A simple technique without clamping the chest tube during pleurodesis is described which we used in patients with persistent air leak. Material and Method: The study comprised 11 patients diagnosed with {{spontaneous pneumothorax}} who were treated by autologous blood patch pleurodesis without clamping the chest tube. Pleurodesis was performed at the bedside by giving 50 ml autologous blood into the pleural cavity. The tube was lifted up to form a loop, {{in order to prevent}} the blood from <b>draining</b> into the <b>bottle.</b> Cessation of air leak at the end of 72 hours was accepted as complete response, whereas a marked decrease in air leakage was accepted as partial response to the procedure. Results: The mean age and age range of 10 male and 1 female patients were 55. 6 + 15. 7 and 29 - 75, consecutively. Complete response was obtained in 6 patients (% 54. 5), partial in 4 (% 36. 4). Air drainage continued without any change in 1 patient. Complications were empyema (1 patient) and intrathoracic coagulum (1 patient). Conclusion: The aforementioned loop technique facilitates the execution of autologous blood patch pleurodesis, particularly in patients with an excessive air leak. In our opinion, it is a reliable technique both for preventing air leakage and achieving pleurodesis in selective patients unsuitable for surgery...|$|R
50|$|Burkhart {{takes the}} young man into the wilderness, where he induces {{the young man}} to forget whiskey. McNair is frantic for liquor. Burkhart argues with him and even uses force to keep McNair from the bottle. In his own chamber Burkhart has a {{well-stocked}} cellarette containing various liquors. Young McNair has noted the cellarette which Burkhart has locked and carries the key in his pocket. One day, seeing the old colored servant drinking from a bottle, McNair snatches it from him and drains it. He does not sleep at night and in the daytime he wanders about the woods, a nervous wreck. One night he has a frightful dream. In a vision he sees himself enter the chamber of Burkhart, thirsting for alcohol, and with an axe, breaking open the cellarette. Then in the vision Burkhart enters and catches him {{in the act of}} <b>draining</b> a whiskey <b>bottle.</b> There is a struggle, and McNair sees himself raise the axe over the head of his devoted friend and knocking him to the floor. Then he sees himself, horror stricken and remorseful, dash out of the bungalow and pull a revolver from his pocket, placing it to his own temple and pulling the trigger. He next sees the old negro servant, awe stricken and frightened {{at the sight of the}} wounded man lying near the door, picks him up and carries him into the house. Then he sees the old negro lay him tenderly on the bed, when the vision changes into wakefulness and he is aroused by the touch of his friend, Burkhart, who shakes him by the shoulder. Then he realizes that it was all a dream. He springs to his feet and embraces his friend. He reads a letter from his wife, telling him of the ruin which has befallen Burkhart owing to his absence from business and his defeat as governor. He is a man again. He will not succumb to liquor in the future. He pledges himself to leave whiskey alone. Burkhart takes him home to his wife and baby. He has paid the price of his error and his conscience tells him he has done well.|$|R

O maior número de pupas de A. aegypti foi coletado nos ralos (31 %), garrafas e latas (23 %); e com A. albopictus o maior número foi nas garrafas, latas (24 %) e vasos de planta (21 %). Do total de pupas obtidas, 84, 3 % e 79, 3 % das pupas de A. aegypti e A. albopictus respectivamente foram coletadas em pequenos reservatórios: garrafas, vasos de plantas, pneus, bromélias, oco de árvores e ralos. Essas produtividades contradizem a {{literatura}} e podem ser explicadas pelas limitações de acesso aos grandes reservatórios e falha na capacitação dos agentes. Esse estudo chama atenção para a importância que os pequenos reservatórios podem ter na densidade do vetor no meio urbano nacional e conclui que a metodologia de vigilância entomológica usada tem sido ineficaz para identificar os grandes e mais produtivos criadouros. Essa conclusão sugere que essa ineficácia pode ser um fator importante pelos insucessos no combate a dengue no Brasil. Evaluation of Breeding Productivity from Surveillance Data for Aedes aegypti (Linnaeus) and Aedes albopictus (Skuse) in Parati, RJ, Brazil Abstract. This study {{evaluated the}} pupa-productivity of the entomologic surveillance according methodology {{used by the}} official Program for Dengue Control in Brazil (PDCB) for Aedes aegypti (Linnaeus) and Aedes albopictus (Skuse) in Parati, RJ, Brazil. The highest number of A. aegypti pupae were found in <b>drains</b> (31 %), <b>bottles</b> and cans (23 %); and {{the highest number of}} A. albopictus pupae were found in bottles and cans (24 %), and plant vases (21 %). Of the total pupae identified 84. 3 % and 79. 3 % of A. aegypti and A. albopictus respectively were collected in small receptacles: bottles, plants vase, tires, bromeliads and tree holes. These productivities are not supported by literature and {{can be explained by the}} restrictions of access for the bigger receptacles and lack of training of the agents. The study points out the importance which the small receptacles can have on vector densities in urban environment despite of their productivity and conclude that the entomology surveillance methodology for dengue used in PDCB has no efficacy to identify the bigger and more productive receptacles. This conclusion suggests that this inefficacy can be an important factor for the failures on dengue vector control in Brazil...|$|R
40|$|Water {{samples for}} CFC and SF 6 {{measurements}} were collected using a CTD/rosette sampling system. The CFC/SF 6 sample {{was the first}} sample drawn from the rosette bottle. The samples were collected in 250 cc glass stoppered bottles through a PVC tube connected to the rosette <b>bottle</b> <b>drain</b> valve. Bubbles were cleared from the tube with water flowing and the tube was inserted {{to the bottom of}} the 250 cc glass bottle. The glass bottle was placed in a wide mouth plastic jar that extended above the opening of the glass bottle. The overflow water collected in the jar, filling and overflowing the jar and covering the glass bottle opening. The flow continued for 3 overflow volumes of the glass bottle (750 cc) and the glass stopper was then inserted underwater preventing air from being trapped in the sample. The bottle was then placed upside down in the jar, the jar was capped and the sample stored at 2 °C in a refrigerator to prevent degassing. At the end of the cruise, the samples were packed in insulated boxes with cold packs to maintain the 2 °C temperature and shipped by air freight to Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory. The measurements were carried out at Lamont using a dual purge and trap system interfaced to a dual ECD (electron capture detector) HP 6890 gas chromatograph. When a water sample is introduced into the system, it is split into two aliquots, a 20 cc aliquot for CFC measurement and a 180 cc aliquot for SF 6 measurement. The aliquots are transferred to appropriately sized sparging chambers and stripped with ultra high purity nitrogen, which transports the extracted gases to cold traps (Unibeads- 2 s for CFCs, Carboxan- 1000 for SF 6) cooled to - 80 °C. The traps are then heated to 110 °C for CFCs and 165 °C for SF 6 and flushed into the gas chromatograph where CFCs are separated with a Porasil-B pre-column and a Carbograph 1 AC main column and SF 6 is separated with a pre-column and main column of Molecular Sieve 5 A. The gases are detected by the ECDs. The ECDs are calibrated by running gas standards with known concentrations of CFCs and SF 6 prepared by Dr. John Bullister of NOAA/PMEL specifically for the CLIVAR Repeat Hydrography program. CFC concentrations are reported on the SIO 98 calibration scale and SF 6 concentrations on the SIO 2005 calibration scale. Duplicate samples were collected and measured to provide a combined precision for sampling and measurement. The average differences from these duplicate measurements was the larger of 0. 024 pmol/kg or 2. 1 % for CFC- 11, 0. 008 pmol/kg or 1. 8 % for CFC- 12, 0. 006 pmol/kg for CFC- 113 and 0. 046 fmol/kg or 4. 3 % for SF 6...|$|R
