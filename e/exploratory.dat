5|$|BART {{has also}} been {{studying}} ways to improve service and reliability in its core system, where density and ridership is highest. Recent <b>exploratory</b> ideas have included a line that would continue from the Transbay Terminal through the SOMA district, northwards on Van Ness and terminating in western San Francisco along the Geary corridor, the Presidio, or North Beach.|$|E
5|$|Geothermal {{projects}} have several stages of development. Each phase has associated risks. At {{the early stages}} of reconnaissance and geophysical surveys, many projects are cancelled, making that phase unsuitable for traditional lending. Projects moving forward from the identification, exploration and <b>exploratory</b> drilling often trade equity for financing.|$|E
5|$|It was Ely {{who first}} {{suggested}} the American producer (and rock star {{in his own}} right) Todd Rundgren. The band members gathered for an <b>exploratory</b> visit to his Utopia Studios in upstate New York where Rundgren, who was already {{a fan of the}} Furs' music, quickly signed onto the project.|$|E
5|$|Mantes-la-Jolie, France. A {{more or less}} complete, but wrecked, Tiger II (production turret) {{is buried}} under {{regional}} road 913. Parts of the turret were recovered in a limited <b>exploratory</b> excavation in 2001. Further excavation is currently halted for financial reasons. There are plans to fully excavate and restore this Tiger II for a Vexin battle memorial.|$|E
5|$|On May 4, 2016, FOX {{picked up}} a sci-fi comedy-drama series called The Orville. The show is created, executive-produced, and starred in by MacFarlane. The show is set 400 {{years in the future}} aboard the Orville, a not-so-top-of-the-line <b>exploratory</b> ship in the Union {{interstellar}} fleet.|$|E
5|$|Researchers {{also have}} access to EVEREST (<b>Exploratory</b> Visualization Environment for Research and Technology) to better {{understand}} the data that Titan outputs. EVEREST is a visualization room with a 10 by 3 meter (33 by 10 ft) screen and a smaller, secondary screen. The screens are 37 and 33 megapixels respectively with stereoscopic 3D capability.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{these and}} {{numerous}} other influences, however, Shelly Manne's style of drumming was always his ownpersonal, precise, clear, {{and at the same}} time multilayered, using a very broad range of colors. Manne was often experimental, and had participated in such musically <b>exploratory</b> groups of the early 1950s as those of Jimmy Giuffre and Teddy Charles. Yet his playing never became overly cerebral, and he never neglected that element usually considered fundamental to all jazz: time.|$|E
5|$|French naturalists Jean René Constant Quoy and Joseph Paul Gaimard {{originally}} {{described the}} cookiecutter shark during the 18171820 <b>exploratory</b> voyage of the corvette Uranie under Louis de Freycinet, {{giving it the}} name Scymnus brasiliensis because the type specimen was caught off Brazil. In 1824, their account was published as part of Voyage autour du monde...sur les corvettes de S.M. l'Uranie et la Physicienne, Louis de Freycinet's 13 volume report on the voyage. In 1865, American ichthyologist Theodore Nicholas Gill coined the new genus Isistius for this species, after Isis, the Egyptian goddess of light.|$|E
5|$|In 2008, an <b>exploratory</b> {{excavation}} discovered {{mass graves}} {{on the edge}} of Pheasant Wood outside of Fromelles. Two-hundred and fifty British and Australian bodies were excavated from five mass graves which were interred in the newly constructed Fromelles (Pheasant Wood) Military Cemetery. This was the first new Commonwealth War Graves Commission cemetery in more than 50 years, the last such cemeteries having been built after the Second World War.|$|E
5|$|In 2013, Dr. Steven DiSalvo, {{the former}} {{president}} of Marian University was named the 10th president of Saint Anselm. DiSalvo replaced Father Jonathan DeFelice, O.S.B. after 24 years of service to the college. Father DeFelice was the longest serving college president in the state of New Hampshire. In 2015, Dr. DiSalvo announced that the Saint Anselm had applied to enter the <b>exploratory</b> phase of NCAA Division III membership for all athletic programs.|$|E
5|$|In 82 Agricola crossed an {{unidentified}} {{body of water}} and defeated peoples unknown to the Romans until then. He fortified the coast facing Ireland, and Tacitus recalls that his father-in-law often claimed the island could be conquered with a single legion and a few auxiliaries. He had given refuge to an exiled Irish king whom he hoped he might use as the excuse for conquest. This conquest never happened, but some historians believe that the crossing referred to {{was in fact a}} small-scale <b>exploratory</b> or punitive expedition to Ireland.|$|E
5|$|In {{the post-war}} years, archaeological {{interest}} in the castle grew. From 1951 onwards the Ministry of Works carried out a long-running research project into the Device Forts, the section on Camber being written by the historian Martin Biddle and finally published in 1982. Biddle carried out an <b>exploratory</b> archaeological survey of the site in 1962 and the following year the ruins were closed to allow more extensive archaeological excavation by the Ministry. These were initially carried out by Biddle and Alan Cook, with support from local school children and from young offenders from the Borstal institution in Dover.|$|E
5|$|Isolated seamounts {{and those}} without clear {{volcanic}} origins are less common; examples include Bollons Seamount, Eratosthenes Seamount, Axial Seamount and Gorringe Ridge. If all known seamounts were collected into one area, {{they would make}} a landform the size of Europe. Their overall abundance makes them {{one of the most}} common, and least understood, marine structures and biomes on Earth, a sort of <b>exploratory</b> frontier.|$|E
5|$|JMP {{software}} is partly focused on <b>exploratory</b> data analysis and visualization. It {{is designed for}} users to investigate data to learn something unexpected, as opposed to confirming a hypothesis. JMP links statistical data to graphics representing them, so users can drill down or up to explore the data and various visual representations of it. Its primary applications are for designed experiments and analyzing statistical data from industrial processes.|$|E
5|$|On 12 September 1965 the {{terminal}} platforms were closed. This allowed the platforms to be renumbered with the order reversed (see list below). The redundant train shed became a covered car park in February the following year, but from 1989 until 1999 the original (Brunel) part was an interactive science centre known as The <b>Exploratory</b> and an exhibition space. From 2002 to 2008 it housed the British Empire and Commonwealth Museum. As of 2016 the shed, {{now known as}} the Passenger Shed, is a venue for events such as conferences and weddings.|$|E
5|$|On May 1, 2009, Paul {{said that}} if Bunning, whose {{fundraising}} in 2009 matched his poor numbers in opinion polling for the 2010 election, declined to seek a third term, he would almost certainly run in the Republican Party primary to succeed him, and formed an <b>exploratory</b> committee soon after, while still promising {{to stay out of}} the race if Bunning ultimately decided to run for reelection. Paul made this announcement on MSNBC's The Rachel Maddow Show, though a Kentucky news site first broke the news.|$|E
5|$|On November 4, 2009, Lamont {{reported}} that he would create an <b>exploratory</b> committee for the race for Governor of Connecticut in 2010, and on February 17, 2010, he officially announced his candidacy. On May 22, 2010, he was defeated for the Democratic nomination by former Stamford mayor Dan Malloy. Lamont received 582 votes (32 percent) to Malloy's 1,232 votes (68 percent). Since Lamont won more than fifteen {{percent of the vote}}, he appeared on the primary ballot on August 10, 2010. He lost the primary election to Malloy, who received 57.6 percent of the vote to Lamont's 42.4 percent.|$|E
5|$|Paul won several early straw {{polls for}} the 2012 Republican presidential {{nomination}} and in late April 2011, he formed an official <b>exploratory</b> committee. He {{participated in the}} first Republican presidential debate on May 5, 2011 and on May 13, 2011, Paul formally announced his candidacy {{in an interview on}} ABC's Good Morning America. He placed second in the 2011 Ames Straw Poll, missing first by 0.9%.|$|E
5|$|The Banker {{horse is}} a breed of feral horse (Equus ferus caballus) living on barrier islands in North Carolina's Outer Banks. It is small, hardy, {{and has a}} docile temperament. Descended from domesticated Spanish horses and {{possibly}} brought to the Americas in the 16th century, the ancestral foundation bloodstock may have become feral after surviving shipwrecks or being abandoned on the islands {{by one of the}} <b>exploratory</b> expeditions led by Lucas Vázquez de Ayllón or Sir Richard Grenville. Populations are found on Ocracoke Island, Shackleford Banks, Currituck Banks, and in the Rachel Carson Estuarine Sanctuary.|$|E
5|$|The {{city has}} {{produced}} a number of scientists, including 19th-century chemist Humphry Davy (who worked in Hotwells). Physicist Paul Dirac (from Bishopston) received the 1933 Nobel Prize for his contributions to quantum mechanics. Cecil Frank Powell was the Melvill Wills Professor of Physics at the University of Bristol when he received the 1950 Nobel Prize for, among other discoveries, his photographic method of studying nuclear processes. Colin Pillinger was the planetary scientist behind the Beagle 2 project, and neuropsychologist Richard Gregory founded the <b>Exploratory</b> (a hands-on science centre which was the predecessor of At-Bristol/We The Curious).|$|E
5|$|The <b>exploratory</b> {{parts of}} the game feature a series of arcane codes and glyphs, {{treasure}} maps and chests, and secret rooms. Players are left without guidance to determine whether game elements are decipherable subpuzzles or simply false signals. These sorts of puzzles include hidden warp gates, enigmatic obelisks, invisible platforms, sequences of tetrominos, a ciphered alphabet, and QR codes. One of the game's recurring themes is an ancient civilization that attempted {{to make sense of}} their dimensionality, as told through artifacts.|$|E
5|$|The {{software}} {{can be purchased}} in any of five capability configurations: JMP, JMP Pro, JMP Clinical, JMP Genomics and the JMP Graph Builder App for the iPad. JMP can be automated with its proprietary scripting language, JSL. The software is focused on <b>exploratory</b> visual analytics, where users investigate and explore data. These explorations can also be verified by hypothesis testing, data mining, or other analytic methods. In addition, discoveries made through graphical exploration can inspire a designed experiment that can be both designed and analyzed with JMP.|$|E
5|$|The yellow-tailed black {{cockatoo}} is {{very fond}} of the larvae of tree-boring beetles, such as the longhorn beetle Tryphocaria acanthocera, and cossid moth Xyleutes boisduvali. Birds seek them out all year but especially in June and July, when the moth caterpillars are largest, and they are accompanied by their just fledged young. They search out holes and make some <b>exploratory</b> bites looking for larvae. If successful, they peel and tear down a strip of bark to make a perch for themselves before continuing to gouge and excavate the larvae, which have deeply tunneled into the heartwood.|$|E
5|$|Two {{weeks prior}} to his withdrawal, Bayh filed his {{organization}} with the Federal Elections Commission as an <b>exploratory</b> committee, under the header Friends of Evan Bayh. Following his exit from the race, Bayh endorsed and campaigned for Hillary Clinton for president, switching his support to Democratic nominee Barack Obama following Clinton's withdrawal. He was a finalist to become Obama's running mate, losing, in a close decision, to Delaware Senator Joe Biden.|$|E
5|$|Under Hall's command, the Polaris {{departed}} from New York City in June 1871. By October, {{the men were}} wintering {{on the shore of}} northern Greenland, making preparations for the trip to the Pole. Hall returned to the ship from an <b>exploratory</b> sledging journey, and promptly fell ill. Before he died, he accused members of the crew of poisoning him. An exhumation of his body in 1968 revealed that he had ingested a large quantity of arsenic {{in the last two weeks}} of his life.|$|E
5|$|Washington's {{retirement}} to personal business at Mount Vernon was short-lived. He made an <b>exploratory</b> {{trip to the}} western frontier in 1784 and inspected his land holdings in Western Pennsylvania that had been earned decades earlier for his service in the French and Indian War. There he confronted squatters, including David Reed and the Covenanters; they vacated, but only after losing a court decision heard in Washington, Pennsylvania in 1786. He also facilitated {{the creation of the}} Potomac Company, a public–private partnership that sought to link the Potomac River with the Ohio River, but technical and financial challenges rendered the company unprofitable.|$|E
25|$|Paul {{formed a}} presidential <b>exploratory</b> {{committee}} on January 11. He also acquired data on {{public interest in}} his running for President around February 19. Based on {{the results from the}} <b>exploratory</b> committee and polling, Paul officially entered the race on March 12.|$|E
25|$|Laparoscopy {{involves}} {{inserting a}} telescoping camera approximately 1nbsp&cm in diameter into the horse's abdomen, {{through a small}} incision, to visualize the gastrointestinal tract. It may be performed standing or under general anesthesia, and is less invasive than an <b>exploratory</b> celiotomy (abdominal <b>exploratory</b> surgery).|$|E

25|$|<b>Exploratory</b> data {{analysis}} {{refers to a}} variety of practices which researchers can use to visualize and analyze existing sets of data. In Peirce's three modes of inference, <b>exploratory</b> data anlysis corresponds to abduction, or hypothesis formation. Meta-analysis is the technique of integrating the results from multiple studies and interpreting the statistical properties of the pooled dataset.|$|E
