This paper provides a new analysis of <b>e-trust,</b> trust occurring in digital contexts, among the artificial agents of a distributed artificial system. The analysis endorses a non-psychological approach and rests on a Kantian regulative ideal of a rational agent, able to choose the best option for itself, given a specific scenario and a goal to achieve. The paper first introduces <b>e-trust</b> describing its relevance for the contemporary society and then presents a new theoretical analysis of this phenomenon. The analysis first focuses on an agent???s trustworthiness, this one is presented as the necessary requirement for <b>e-trust</b> to occur. Then, a new definition of <b>e-trust</b> as a second-orderproperty of first-order relations is presented. It is shown that the second-orderproperty of <b>e-trust</b> {{has the effect of}} minimising an agent???s effort and commitment in the achievement of a given goal. On this basis, a method is provided for the objective assessment of the levels of <b>e-trust</b> occurring among the artificial agents of a distributed artificial system...|$|E

40|$|The rapid {{development}} {{of technology and}} internet has diverted company direction to retain customer e-loyalty. Customer loyalty is becoming an area of great interest for companies and customer loyalty has {{a direct impact on}} the revenue and profitability of a company. With regard to customer loyalty’s importance, we investigate three main research problems that are the most important barriers for e-businesses to survival, which are customer too much switching, switching cost, and competition. To overcome this barriers: companies had to invest on building loyal customer in long- time relationship. Also, in this research, the influential factors of customer e-loyalty were investigated, which are e-satisfaction, <b>e-trust,</b> and e-quality. In this research, e-loyalty and e-satisfaction models are elaborated, then, with regard to limitations, the conceptual e-loyalty model are assumed that investigate the relationship between the e-satisfaction, <b>e-trust,</b> and e-quality as basic constructs of model as well as the relationship between each constructs and e-loyalty. In this study, quantitative research is best to this thesis because of linear structure between e-loyalty and its constructs. In addition, research purpose and research questions indicate that this thesis is primarily exploratory then descriptive. Since the aim of this research is to investigate the relationship of variables and to test some predefined hypothesizes among a number of e-stores, survey is selected as research strategy. The aim of this research is to identify influential factors of customer e-loyalty in Iranian e-stores which are focus on selling Book and CDs. Thus, the sample of this survey consists of online buyers who have deals with three e-stores. The names of e-stores were considered anonymous due to owner's request since they feel free to give us customer's information. Moreover, the size of the population under this study is the sample size that has been determined 280 under formula: still, 352 questionnaires were gathered out which 322 were eventually accepted. The result of this research shows that delivery time, distribution system, specific invoice as well as convenience and flexibility of online shopping is very underlying factor of e-satisfaction from customer point of view. In addition, giving Personal Data, Reliable information, Credit card information, and having Physical location have a very influential effect on <b>E-trust</b> from customer point of view. Also, e-stores brand name as well as previous user’s recommendations is the most underling factors which bring about good word of mouth and finally lead to trust in online shopping. Moreover, Experience of members in communities and chartrooms leads to developing <b>E-trust</b> among members. Besides, need fulfillment, advertisement / promotions, and customized attention are the influential factors of E-quality from customer perspective. Also, sending reminder, relevant information, and share of business with customer are the most underlying factors which affect cultivation and increase customer attention in online shopping and consequently increase e-quality. Moreover, one-stop shop and carry a wide selection of products are the most prominent issues which lead to e-quality. In conclusion, all factors which increase E-satisfaction and E-quality lead to e-loyalty so E-satisfaction as well as E-quality considered as two influential factors of customer E-loyalty. Also, since significant relationship between <b>E-trust</b> with E-loyalty and E-satisfaction rejected, we can say that preparing <b>e-trust</b> solely has no effect on E-loyalty and E-satisfaction. In other words, trust is sufficient condition for any e-business for transactions with customer which is not lead to e-loyalty, exclusively. Beside, since there is significant and positive relationship between <b>E-trust</b> and E-quality, and because E-quality has direct effect on E-satisfaction and E-loyalty, we can conclude that <b>E-trust</b> in companion with E-quality will lead to E-satisfaction and E-loyalty.

New technologies have significantly influenced trade, and converted traditional commerce to e-Commerce. Modern commerce enables people to conduct business in their offices or at homes, with minimal time, cost, error, and maximum efficiency. Customer trust, satisfaction and loyalty play vital roles in {{the success or failure}} of e-Commerce. It is also clear that loyal customers are one of the most important assets of firms, which results in long-term benefits. In this research, three problems were addressed. Firstly, companies easily lose their e-Customers in the competitive environment of today‘s business (Internet). Secondly, gaining loyal customers takes a long time, and is high in cost. Thirdly, there are inactive and nonprofitable customers in the database of online companies; converting inactive and nonprofitable customers to active and profitable customers by increasing their trust, satisfaction and loyalty. These three basic problems encourage us to study the nature of e-Loyalty formation in e-Commerce. The main aim of this study is to answer the question of how firms can increase Electronic Trust (<b>e-Trust),</b> Electronic Satisfaction (e-Satisfaction) and Electronic Loyalty (e-Loyalty) among their e-Customers. A review of literature and interviews with experts in this domain revealed that e-Satisfaction and <b>e-Trust</b> are two important factors that influence e-Loyalty. The significant aspect of this research is derived from the inclusion of a comprehensive conceptual framework with different aspects of technology, organization, and customers (three main entities in e-Commerce). Nine hypotheses display the relationships between technological, organizational, and customer factors with e-Satisfaction and <b>e-Trust,</b> which is significantly influence e- Loyalty. The data for this study were collected from e-Customers of the largest retail company in Iran in 2011, and statistical analyses were used to validate and ensure the reliability of the proposed model. The results showed the relationship between technological, organizational and customer factors with e-Satisfaction, <b>e-Trust,</b> and finally, e-Loyalty. The findings also revealed the fact that technological factor has the most effect on e-Satisfaction, <b>e-Trust</b> and e-Loyalty.

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} is to explore the impact of online service quality on the level of customer delight and on the development of customer relationships. Design/methodology/approach – A self-complete survey was used to collect data from a convenience sample of 200 Australian respondents who use online banking. Factor analysis and structural equation modelling were used to test the proposed model of relationships. Findings – Online service quality has no impact on customer delight, <b>e-trust</b> or the development of stronger relationships with customers. It does have a relationship to e-loyalty. However, the “efficiency” dimension of online service quality is related to <b>e-trust</b> and also indirectly to relationship strength through <b>e-trust.</b> The “personal need” and “site organization” dimensions of online service quality are related to e-loyalty, with “personal needs” exhibiting the strongest impact. Customer delight has no relationship to online service quality, nor <b>e-trust,</b> relationship strength or e-loyalty. Research limitations/implications – Generalizability is the main issue. Further research is required to confirm results and examine the identified lack of association between customer delight and e-loyalty. Further exploration of all scales is recommended. Online service quality is not a sufficient method for retaining customers through relationship building and does not result in delighting customers. Practical implications – Online service quality is not enough to develop strong relationships with bank customers. Banks can achieve customer loyalty through attending to their personal needs in online situations as well as providing a well organized site. Alternatively, if banks wish to develop strong relationships with customers, they must provide user-friendly and efficient websites while also developing trust in the website. Relationship building and e-loyalty appears to represent different things to different customers. Therefore, online service quality alone is not a sufficient means of building strong relationships and retaining customers. Originality/value – Results provide important insights into the impact of online service quality on relationship building with customers. Also online service quality for banks appears different to other previously researched retail settings and has different associated outcomes. 24 page(s...|$|E

40|$|Background: Electronic loyalty (e-loyalty) {{has become}} {{important}} {{in the context of}} electronic commerce (e-commerce) in recent years. Loyal customers bring long-term revenue to companies and are known to be a valuable asset to them. However, firms lose their customers in a competitive environment on the Internet {{because of a lack of}} trust, satisfaction and loyalty. Objectives: This study explains how e-loyalty, <b>e-trust</b> and e-satisfaction form in e-commerce with a focus on customer purchase intention formation. Method: A conceptual framework was formed based upon the literature review. Data were collected from e-customers of online firms in South Africa. After data clarification, confirmatory factor analysis was conducted. The structural equation modelling was applied to test the hypotheses. IBM SPSS AMOS 20 was used for this purpose. Results: Firstly, convenience, customer benefit and enjoyment affect customer satisfaction in e-commerce. In other words, when customers do business activities easily with enjoyment and take benefit, they are satisfied and they will purchase again in future. Secondly, our study demonstrated that customer perception of security, clear shopping process and reliable payment system have a positive relationship with <b>e-trust.</b> Finally, e-satisfaction and <b>e-trust</b> have a positive and strong relationship with e-loyalty formation in e-commerce. Conclusion: The results of the study shed light on important issues relating to e-loyalty formation from a new perspective. Online companies are interested in launching e-loyalty programmes because of the long-term benefits that come from loyal customers. To remain competitive, e-commerce companies should constantly work at enhancing customer trust, satisfaction and loyalty. Keywords: E-commerce; customer satisfaction; trust; loyalty</p...|$|E
