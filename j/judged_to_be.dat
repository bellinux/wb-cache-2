5|$|The two-story station {{building}} {{was destroyed by}} a fire on June 11, 1983. The building had been vacant since the early 1970s and was a frequent target of vandalism; the fire was <b>judged</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> of suspicious origin. The MBTA did not replace the building, but handicapped-accessible platforms were installed in 1992 and were connected with footbridges.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the raid}} on 29 August, the Home Fleet sailed west to cover Convoy RA59A which had sailed from {{northern}} Russia on 28 August bound from the UK. Due to fuel shortages, Indefatigable and three destroyers detached {{later that day}} to return to Scapa Flow and Formidable with two destroyers followed 24 hours later. Duke of York and six destroyers remained on station in the Arctic Sea until 11:00 am on 1 September when the convoy was <b>judged</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> safe from attack.|$|E
5|$|In a {{surprise}} move, the Argentine naval commission then threw {{out all of}} the opening tenders and called for another round of bidding; they simultaneously updated the specifications to include what were <b>judged</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> the best aspects of all the plans. The competitors were given three weeks to come up with new designs and cost estimates. After diplomatic protests, this was modified slightly; the original bids were kept, but alterations to attempt to conform to the new desired characteristics were allowed.|$|E

5|$|Lawrence {{hoped that}} the Manhattan Project would develop {{improved}} calutrons and construct Alpha III racetracks, but they were <b>judged</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> uneconomical. The Alpha tracks were closed down in September 1945. Although performing better than ever, they could not compete with K-25 and the new K-27, which commenced operation in January 1946. In December, the Y-12 plant was closed, thereby cutting the Tennessee Eastman payroll from 8,600 to 1,500 and saving $2million a month. Staff numbers at the Radiation laboratory fell from 1,086 in May 1945 to 424 {{by the end of}} the year.|$|E
5|$|Most of the {{judicial}} system and legal codes of the Weimar Republic remained in use {{during and after the}} Nazi era to deal with non-political crimes. The courts issued and carried out far more death sentences than before the Nazis took power. People who were convicted of three or more offences—even petty ones—could be deemed habitual offenders and jailed indefinitely. People such as prostitutes and pickpockets were <b>judged</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> inherently criminal and a threat to the racial community. Thousands were arrested and confined indefinitely without trial.|$|E

5|$|Six Sea Kings in troop-carrying capacity, {{designated}} Mk42C, {{were also}} procured in 1987. Although the Indian Navy considered the AEW Sea King, {{expected to be}} designated as Mk42D, it was <b>judged</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> too expensive, consequently, in 2003, the Russian Kamov Ka-31 was procured instead. The indigenous HAL Dhruv was the intended replacement for the Sea King in the ASW role, however, in 2000, it was deemed unsuited, as the Indian Navy were dissatisfied with the design's folding blade mechanism and by the Dhruv's maintenance record.|$|E
5|$|The AV-8A's {{abilities}} in air-to-air combat were {{tested by the}} Marine Corps by conducting mock dogfights with McDonnell Douglas F-4 Phantom IIs; these exercises trained pilots to use the vectoring-in-forward-flight (VIFF) capability to outmanoeuvre their opponents and showed that the Harriers could act as effective air-to-air fighters at close range. The success of Harrier operations countered scepticism of V/STOL aircraft, which had been <b>judged</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> expensive failures in the past. Marine Corps officers became convinced of the military advantages of the Harrier and pursued extensive development of the aircraft.|$|E
5|$|The Chittenango ovate amber snail, {{scientific}} name Novisuccinea chittenangoensis, is {{a species of}} small air-breathing land snail in the family Succineidae, the amber snails. This species was discovered in 1905, and was reported three years later as a subspecies of the oval ambersnail, Succinea ovalis. Several taxonomic reviews {{took place in the}} subsequent decades {{until the end of the}} 1980s, when the Chittenango ovate amber snail was finally <b>judged</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a distinct species Novisuccinea chittenangoensis, based on chemical and morphological data.|$|E

5|$|The codex, {{although}} displaying Mixtec stylistic features, is <b>judged</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> Maya (if genuine) {{based upon}} the use of bark paper instead of the deerhide preferred for Mixtec codices {{and because of the}} presence of Maya day signs and numbering. The Mixtec interpretation of the iconography may simply be due to incomplete knowledge of highland Maya iconography during the Postclassic period.|$|E
5|$|The {{duration}} of time until an eventual reward also affects participants' choice of immediate or delayed gratification. A 2001 study demonstrated {{that if a}} reward will not be granted for an extensive amount of time, such as 180–300 months (15–25 years), the monetary amount of the reward is inconsequential; instead, {{the bulk of the}} participants choose the immediate reward, even if their delayed reward would be quite large. Delayed gratification has its limits, and a delay can only be so long before it is <b>judged</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> not worth the effort it takes to wait.|$|E
5|$|Controversy {{has arisen}} since the {{creation}} of the awards; there have been two occasions when no award was given because no titles were <b>judged</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> odd enough, Bent has complained about some of the winners chosen by the public, and the 2008 winner, The 2009–2014 World Outlook for 60-milligram Containers of Fromage Frais, proved controversial because rather than being written by its listed author, Philip M. Parker, it was instead written by a machine of Parker's invention. The most recent winner, in July 2017, was The Commuter Pig Keeper: A Comprehensive Guide to Keeping Pigs when Time is your Most Precious Commodity by Michaela Giles.|$|E

5|$|Despite Australian fears, the Japanese never {{intended}} to invade the Australian mainland. While an invasion was considered by the Japanese Imperial General Headquarters in February 1942, it was <b>judged</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> beyond the Japanese military's capabilities and no planning or other preparations were undertaken. Instead, in March 1942 the Japanese military adopted a strategy of isolating Australia from the United States by capturing Port Moresby in New Guinea and the Solomon Islands, Fiji, Samoa and New Caledonia. This plan was frustrated by the Japanese defeat in the Battle of the Coral Sea and was postponed indefinitely after the Battle of Midway. While these battles ended the threat to Australia, the Australian government continued to warn that an invasion was possible until mid-1943.|$|E
5|$|During {{the course}} of the evaluation, the Tri-partite pilots {{developed}} a typical sortie routine for the Kestrel of conducting short take-offs (STO) and returning to base on vertical landings. This manner of operation (STOVL) was <b>judged</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> the optimal practice. Operating from rough airstrips was also trialled at nearby RAF Bircham Newton, where the aircraft proved adept at traversing boggy ground and taking off from a variety of temporary ground coverings. During testing one aircraft was lost when a pilot tried to do a rolling take-off with the parking brake on; the evaluations were finalised in November 1965.|$|E
5|$|Every second, {{approximately}} 28 cubed {{meters of}} water {{flows into the}} bay. The exchange with the Gulf of Mexico occurs at Cedar Bayou and Aransas Pass. As {{a result of the}} seawater exchange, the bay's salinity is 15 parts per thousand, compared to the seawater average of 35 ppt. This discrepancy is brought about by the volume of fresh water that empties into the bay and its extensions, from Copano Creek, Mission River and Aransas River, forming the Mission-Aransas estuary. Fresh water flows also arrive from the impact of the Guadalupe River on San Antonio Bay. Combined, the fresh water influence is 60 to 70 percent of the system's volume, which is <b>judged</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> minimal.|$|E
