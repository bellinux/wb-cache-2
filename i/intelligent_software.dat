These launches were successful, with the iPhone 5 (released September 21, 2012) becoming Apple's biggest iPhone launch with over two million pre-orders and sales of three million iPads in three days following the launch of the iPad Mini and fourth generation iPad (released November 3, 2012). Apple also released a third-generation 13-inch MacBook Pro with a Retina display and new iMac and Mac Mini computers.|$|E

2500|$|If {{research}} into Strong AI produced sufficiently <b>intelligent</b> <b>software,</b> {{it might be}} able to reprogram and improve itself. The improved software would be even better at improving itself, leading to recursive self-improvement. The new intelligence could thus increase exponentially and dramatically surpass humans. Science fiction writer Vernor Vinge named this scenario [...] "singularity". Technological singularity is when accelerating progress in technologies will cause a runaway effect wherein artificial intelligence will exceed human intellectual capacity and control, thus radically changing or even ending civilization. Because the capabilities of such an intelligence may be impossible to comprehend, the technological singularity is an occurrence beyond which events are unpredictable or even unfathomable.|$|E

[...] One then types a space to move the character from the input buffer onto the screen. [...] In the event that the 4 letter representation of the character is not unique, one would type a digit to select the relevant character (for example, if two characters have the same representation, typing 1 would select the first, and 2 the second). [...] In most implementations, a space can always be typed and simply means 1 in an ambiguous setting.

40|$|Recent {{developments}} in the industry show strong inclination of Architects towards agent based software development and component based development. Both these approaches help organizations to utilize the older and experienced programs and interfaces into new products without having to reinvent the wheel; thereby reducing cost and time of production and ensuring high quality with already tested components and interfaces. Nowadays, researchers envisage an <b>Intelligent</b> Component-Oriented <b>Software</b> Development methodology which is an amalgam of the two approaches resulting in more flexible, reusable and customizable agent components. This helps in pushing forward the development timelines and quality expectations to newer heights. In this paper we mainly analyzed various states of art <b>intelligent</b> component-oriented <b>software</b> development techniques and studied the research gap in the component selection processes. Recommendations for future research direction for <b>Intelligent</b> Component-Oriented <b>Software</b> Development are also highlighted in this paper. Keywords...|$|R
