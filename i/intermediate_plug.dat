50|$|With soft or average {{hardness}} materials, such as plastic, aluminum or mild steel, {{the common}} practice {{is to use}} an <b>intermediate</b> (<b>plug)</b> tap to cut the threads. If the threads are to extend {{to the bottom of}} a blind hole, the <b>intermediate</b> (<b>plug)</b> tap will be used to cut threads until the point of the tap reaches bottom, after which a bottoming tap will be used to finish the hole. Frequent ejection of the chips must be made in such an operation to avoid jamming and possibly breaking the tap. With hard materials, the machinist may start with a taper tap, whose less severe diameter transition reduces the amount of torque required to cut the threads. If threads are to be cut to the bottom of a blind hole, the taper tap will be followed by an <b>intermediate</b> (<b>plug)</b> tap and then a bottoming tap to finish the operation.|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe {{influence}} of burrow spacing on nitrification and denitrification was simulated experimentally using sediment plugs of different thicknesses immersed in aerated seawater reservoirs. Different plug thicknesses mimic different distances between oxygenated burrow centers and produce similar changes in aerobicâanaerobic reaction balances {{as a function}} of diffusive transport scaling. The thicknesses used were roughly equivalent to transport scales (interburrow spacing) that could be produced by burrow abundances of ~ 400 to 50, 000 m- 2, depending on burrow lumen radii (e. g., 0. 05 â 1 cm). Following the exposure of anoxic sediment plugs to aerated water, an efficient aerobic nitrification zone was established within the first ~ 2 â 3 millimeters of sediment. At pseudo-steady state, the thinnest plug (2 mm) simulating highest burrow density, was entirely oxic and the denitrification rate nil. Denitrification was stimulated in anoxic regions of the thicker plugs (5, 10, and 20 mm) compared to the initial value in experimental sediment. Maximum nitrification rates and the highest denitrification/nitrification ratio between oxic nitrification and adjacent denitrification zones occurred for the <b>intermediate</b> <b>plug</b> thickness of 5 mm. Of the oxic/anoxic composites, the thickest plug showed the least efficient coupling between nitrification/denitrification zones (lowest denitrification/nitrification ratio). Both the thickness of the oxic layer and the total net remineralization of dissolved inorganic N varied inversely with plug thickness. A set of diffusionâreaction models was formulated assuming a range of possible nitrification kinetic functions. All model forms predicted optimal nitrificationâdenitrification and ammonificationâdenitrification coupling with relative oxicâanoxic zonation scales comparable to <b>intermediate</b> <b>plug</b> thicknesses (5 â 6 mm). However, none of the commonly assumed kinetic forms for nitrification could produce the observed NO- 3 profiles in detail, implying that natural sediment populations of nitrifiers may be less sensitive to O 2 than laboratory strains. Our experimental and model results clearly show that rates of N remineralization and the balance between stimulation/inhibition of denitrification are highly dependent on sedimentary biogenic structure and the particular geometries of irrigated burrow distributions...|$|E
40|$|Mixing was {{studied in}} free water surface wetland {{receiving}} pumped river water, by {{measurement of the}} non-interacting tracer lithium. The flow pattern {{was found to be}} <b>intermediate</b> between <b>plug</b> flow and well-mixed. The nominal detention time, calculated from volume aand flow, was 50 % larger than the mean tracer detention time. The peak time was found to be one-half the tracer detention time. Three models were constructed: plug flow with dispersion, tanks in series, and a series-parallel network of tanks. All proved capable of fitting the exit tracer concentration curves but the network model provided a better fit to internal measurements. Pumping frequency was high enough to allow use of an average flowrate. The degree of mixing, as characterized by the variance of the exit tracer response curve, was comparable to that found by other researchers for wetlands, ponds and rivers...|$|R
40|$|The central pore of the SecYEG preprotein-conducting {{channel is}} closed at the periplasmic {{face of the}} {{membrane}} by a plug domain. To study its conformational dynamics, the plug was labeled site-specifically with an environment-sensitive fluorophore. In {{the presence of a}} stable preprotein translocation <b>intermediate,</b> the SecY <b>plug</b> showed an enhanced solvent exposure consistent with a displacement from the hydrophobic central pore region. In contrast, binding and insertion of a ribosome-bound nascent membrane protein did not alter the plug conformation. These data indicate different plug dynamics depending on the ligand bound state of the SecYEG channel. ...|$|R
5000|$|Thus, {{this seems}} to be a {{property}} of the main verbs of the sentences, think and say, respectively. After work by Lauri Karttunen, verbs that allow presuppositions to [...] "pass up" [...] to the whole sentence ("project") are called holes, and verbs that block such passing up, or projection of presuppositions are called plugs. Some linguistic environments are <b>intermediate</b> between <b>plugs</b> and holes: They block some presuppositions and allow others to project. These are called filters. An example of such an environment are indicative conditionals ("If-then" [...] clauses). A conditional sentence contains an antecedent and a consequent. The antecedent is the part preceded by the word [...] "if," [...] and the consequent is the part that is (or could be) preceded by [...] "then." [...] If the consequent contains a presupposition trigger, and the triggered presupposition is explicitly stated in the antecedent of the conditional, then the presupposition is blocked. Otherwise, it is allowed to project up to the entire conditional. Here is an example: ...|$|R
40|$|International audienceA {{method to}} {{determine}} residence time distribution (RTD) of municipal sewage sludge {{in a continuous}} contact dryer with agitation has been developed. Experiments were conducted using a pulse injection of chloride sodium and by sampling and analysing the electrical conductivity of sludge leachate offline. Experiments were performed with the same operating conditions in triplicate but with a sampling interval' at the wastewater treatment plant of several weeks. Accuracy and reproducibility of the method was quantified with an averaged mean residence time of 160 +/- 7 min. The RTD curves shows sludge flow behavior is <b>intermediate</b> between a <b>plug</b> flow and a perfectly mixed flow. This is due to presence of paddles which induces axial dispersion on the flow...|$|R
40|$|The Siuna terrane, defined {{here for}} the first time, is {{composed}} of slices of limey sedimentary strata, intermediate volcanic rock, serpentinite, and ultramafic cumulates, thrust together in the lower Upper Cretaceous. The terrane is intruded by <b>intermediate</b> dikes, <b>plugs</b> and plutons dated from 75 to 60 Ma, and is cut by Tertiary normal and strike-slip faults. The Siuna terrane volcanic and sedimentary strata probably formed in a Lower Cretaceous volcanic arc and associated back-arc or inter-arc basin. They host a Zn-Cu-Au volcanogenic massive sulfide occurrence and a Au-Cu skarn (the Siuna Mine), as well as several Au prospects. The serpentinite bodies host podiform chromite and disseminated Au occurrences. The Siuna terrane is distinct from the Chortis block to the north, and may have formed far from it. Evidence to date indicates that the low grade metamorphic "continental" basement of the Chortis block does not extend beneath the Siuna area. Isotopic evidence, as well as the presence of fragments of oceanic crust (serpentinite and ultramafic cumulates), indicate that the Siuna belt represents a fragment underlain by oceanic crust, appended to the Chortis block in the Upper Cretaceous; it may originally have been part of Greater Antilles Arc. The interpretation of the Siuna terrane presented here constitutes a significant departure from previous interpretations of the geology and tectonics history of the area...|$|R
