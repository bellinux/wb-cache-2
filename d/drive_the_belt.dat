40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to develop an {{efficient}} and realistic numerical model in order to predict the dynamic response of <b>belt</b> <b>drives.</b> <b>The</b> <b>belt</b> was modeled as a planar beam element based on an absolute nodal coordinate formulation. A viscoelastic material was adopted for <b>the</b> <b>belt</b> and <b>the</b> corresponding damping and stiffness matrices were determined. The belt-pulley contact was formulated as a linear complementarity problem together with a penalty method. This made it possible for us to accurately predict the contact forces, including the stick and slip zones between <b>the</b> <b>belt</b> and <b>the</b> pulley. The belt-drive model was verified by comparing it with the available analytical solutions. A good agreement was found. Finally, the applicability of the method was demonstrated by considering non-steady belt-drive operating conditions...|$|R

50|$|Steel tracks {{revolving}} around pontoons were {{replaced with a}} system that employed two rubber belts with metal cleats, or grousers, attached to the outside perimeter to grip the snow.

In 1970 with the introduction of the Classic, a small plastic window was installed in <b>the</b> <b>belt</b> lifter handle so <b>the</b> <b>belt</b> could be visually inspected as being intact and installed on the turbine driveshaft. When the Heritage Model was introduced in 1982, the Brush Performance Indicator Light was installed {{in the top of the}} carpet nozzle, which consisted of magnets and a copper wire installed in the rotating vibrating brush.
