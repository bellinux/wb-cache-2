5|$|A rarely appearing, all-white <b>form</b> <b>was</b> {{initially}} described A.phalloides f. alba by Max Britzelmayr, {{though its}} status has been unclear.

The true Amanita verna fruits in spring and turns yellow with KOH solution, whereas A.phalloides never does.|$|E

50|$|In mathematics, {{especially}} vector calculus and differential topology, {{a closed}} <b>form</b> <b>is</b> a differential <b>form</b> α whose exterior derivative is zero (dα = 0), and an exact <b>form</b> <b>is</b> a differential <b>form</b> that <b>is</b> the exterior derivative of another differential form &beta;. Thus, an exact <b>form</b> <b>is</b> {{in the image}} of d, and a closed <b>form</b> <b>is</b> in the kernel of d.|$|R

5|$|During {{the late}} 1950s and early 1960s Millwall's <b>form</b> <b>was</b> poor, {{and they were}} relegated into (and became a {{founding}} member of) Division Four. The {{first time in their}} history they had competed in the fourth tier of English football, which they remained in for four seasons until 1962.

5|$|His second {{first-class}} {{season with}} Middlesex {{was much less}} successful than the first; Kartik took only 16 wickets at 34.06 in seven matches, with a best of 4/101 against Derbyshire. He scored 161 runs at 20.12 with a best of 44 against Warwickshire. His one-day <b>form</b> <b>was</b> also lean, yielding six wickets at 33.00 in six matches.|$|E

5|$|The largest Maya sculptures {{consisted}} of architectural façades crafted from stucco. The rough <b>form</b> <b>was</b> {{laid out on}} a plain plaster base coating on the wall, and the three-dimensional <b>form</b> <b>was</b> built up using small stones. Finally, this was coated with stucco and moulded into the finished form; human body forms were first modelled in stucco, with their costumes added afterwards. The final stucco sculpture was then brightly painted. Giant stucco masks were used to adorn temple façades by the Late Preclassic, and such decoration continued into the Classic period.|$|E
5|$|The {{origin of}} the name for the river is unknown but appears to be Pre-English. In Old English the <b>form</b> <b>was</b> Weolud and may have changed to the Middle English form due to folk-etymology or Scandinavian influence.

5000|$|If [...] {{is not a}} unit {{quaternion}} {{then the}} homogeneous <b>form</b> <b>is</b> still a scalar multiple of a rotation matrix, while the inhomogeneous <b>form</b> <b>is</b> in general no longer an orthogonal matrix.

50|$|If V is finite-dimensional then, {{relative}} to some basis for V, a bilinear <b>form</b> <b>is</b> degenerate if {{and only if}} the determinant of the associated matrix is zero - {{if and only if}} the matrix is singular, and accordingly degenerate <b>forms</b> <b>are</b> also called singular forms.

5|$|This {{discovery}} was preceded nearly eight years earlier by {{a report that}} treatment of unactivated ketones with palladium acetate yielded the same products in low yields.

5|$|A {{couple of}} days before the Varsity Match, talk in the press had been of Geen's likely {{selection}} for England for the forthcoming Home Nations Championship. Geen and Poulton, who together were considered the scoring force of the Oxford team, were both selected to play for England in the second trial match against The North in Leeds. Although Geen scored a try in the game, his <b>form</b> <b>was</b> lacking and he was outshone by Poulton. So for the third and final trial, England versus The Rest on 7 January 1911, Geen was not selected.|$|E
5|$|After {{finishing}} {{work on the}} Spyro the Dragon series, Insomniac originally intended to launch a game codenamed I5 (Insomniac game #5) for the PlayStation 2. The developers, however, were never enthusiastic about it, and the idea was dropped after six months. Ratchet & Clank {{was based on an}} idea by Brian Hastings, which would feature a space-traveling reptile alien who would collect various weapons as he progressed through the game; Ratchet's final <b>form</b> <b>was</b> decided upon after Insomniac considered a space lizard with a tail and various terrestrial creatures, including dogs and rats; feline features stood out to the developers because of the associated sense of agility. Another early idea was to have a three small robots attached to Ratchet, which would perform different functions. However, Insomniac realized that having the robots was both complicated and created confusion about Ratchet's appearance, leading them to have only one robot, Clank.|$|E

5|$|After the Second World War Millwall's <b>form</b> <b>was</b> {{poor and}} the club dropped into the Third and Fourth Division of the Football League. West Ham have never played below the Second Division in their history and often played a league or two above Millwall. The two sides did not play each other {{competitively}} between 13 October 1959 and 7 October 1978, making the 1960s the only decade the teams have not met. Despite the infrequency of their meetings, both sets of supporters still consider the other club their major rival. During these years, the Hammers enjoyed considerable success, winning the FA Cup in 1964, 1975 and 1980. They also won the European Cup Winners' Cup in 1965. Over four decades the sides were only in the same tier of the Football League for three seasons, in 1946–47, 1947–48 and 1978–79. They played two cup games {{against each other in}} the Southern Professional Floodlit Cup in 1959 and the Full Members Cup in 1987.|$|E
5|$|Although Hammond {{began his}} career in 1920, he was {{required}} to wait until 1923 before he could play full-time, after his qualification to play for Gloucestershire was challenged. His potential was spotted immediately and after three full seasons, he was chosen to visit the West Indies in 1925–26 {{as a member of}} a Marylebone Cricket Club (M.C.C.) touring party, but contracted a serious illness on the tour. He began to score heavily after his recovery in 1927 and was selected for England. In the 1928–29 series against Australia he scored 905 runs, then a record aggregate for a Test series. He dominated county cricket in the 1930s and, despite a mid-decade slump in Test <b>form,</b> <b>was</b> made captain of England in 1938. He continued as captain after the Second World War, but his health had deteriorated and he retired from first-class cricket after an unsuccessful tour of Australia in 1946–47. He appeared in two more first-class matches in the early 1950s.|$|E
5|$|Although their league <b>form</b> <b>was</b> less {{impressive}} {{during the}} 1960s, {{the second half}} of the decade saw West Brom establish a reputation as a successful cup side. In 1966, under manager Jimmy Hagan, they beat West Ham United in their first League Cup appearance, winning 5–3 on aggregate in the last two-legged final. The following year they reached the final again, the first at Wembley, but lost 3–2 to Third Division Queens Park Rangers after being 2–0 up at half-time. Albion's cup form continued under Hagan's successor Alan Ashman. He guided the club to their last major trophy to date, the 1968 FA Cup, when they beat Everton in extra time thanks to a single goal from Jeff Astle. Albion reached the FA Cup semi-final and European Cup Winners Cup quarter-final in 1969, and were defeated 2–1 by Manchester City in the 1970 League Cup Final.|$|E
