Marcos heavily relied on Imelda, and as time passed, Imelda was no longer a clone of Marcos. Instead, she had become his political partner.|$|E

Self-discipline neatly ties into this. Intelligence, reliability, <b>determination</b> <b>and</b> also being physically fit are key skills.|$|E
5|$|Allen, {{shortly after}} Arnold's {{departure}} on the raid, decided, after his successes {{at the southern}} end of the lake, to take and hold Fort St. John himself. To that end, he and about 100 Boys climbed into four bateaux, and began rowing north. After two days without significant food (which they had forgotten to provision in the boats), Allen's small fleet met Arnold's on its way back to Ticonderoga near the foot of the lake. Arnold generously opened his stores to Allen's hungry men, and tried to dissuade Allen from his objective, noting that it was likely the alarm had been raised and troops were on their way to St. John. Allen, likely both stubborn in his <b>determination,</b> <b>and</b> envious of Arnold, persisted.|$|E

5|$|Dartnell {{offered his}} {{services}} to the British Army on {{the outbreak of the}} First World War, and was commissioned into the 25th (Frontiersmen) Battalion, Royal Fusiliers in February 1915. He fought in the East African Campaign and was mentioned in despatches for the Battle of Bukoba, where he had stormed the German-held town hall, pulled down the German flag and replaced it with the Union Jack. On 3 September 1915, after his company had been ambushed and despite being wounded, Dartnell voluntarily stayed behind in an attempt to save the lives of wounded men as the remainder of the British force retired from the scene. Dartnell was killed in the attempt, but in recognition of his <b>determination</b> <b>and</b> sacrifice he was posthumously awarded the Victoria Cross.|$|E
5|$|Friends {{and family}} {{recalled}} how Costa's {{style of play}} changed little over time, with his father stating how as a child, Costa would be furious whenever his team lost. Atlético scout Javier Hernández, on watching 17-year-old Costa play for Penafiel, {{was impressed by the}} young forward's <b>determination</b> <b>and</b> power, although found it evident that he was not observing a healthy lifestyle. Costa's Penafiel manager Rui Bento, who was at Sporting CP when Cristiano Ronaldo broke into the team, rated Costa in the same calibre as the Portuguese winger. According to Atlético director Jesús García Pitarch, Costa ranks {{as one of the best}} signings of his career, alongside Mohamed Sissoko, Miranda and Ricardo Oliveira.|$|E
5|$|Gomez proved {{his critics}} wrong {{when he arrived}} at the fight in prime {{condition}} and with aggression, <b>determination</b> <b>and</b> desire. The first two rounds started at a furious pace, with Arthur keeping Gomez at bay with stiff jabs and Gomez working inside with hooks and body punches. The match was turning into a clash of opposing styles, Arthur displaying control and boxing technique and Gomez storming forward with wild ferocity. From the third round the fight began to turn Gomez's way. Gomez cut Arthur in the third and silenced the home crowd, who were not used to seeing the home-town hero being battered in this manner. Gomez dominated the fourth round and was in full control of the fight—he exposed Arthur's weak defence and at one stage landed 28 punches without reply.|$|E

5|$|Historians {{have since}} {{connected}} {{the success of}} Save Our Children with the organization of conservative Christian participation in political processes. Although forceful Christian involvement had not taken a widespread role in politics in the United States since 1925, within two years the Reverend Jerry Falwell developed a coalition of conservative religious groups named the Moral Majority that influenced the Republican Party to incorporate a social agenda in national politics. Homosexuality, the Equal Rights Amendment (ERA), abortion, and pornography were among the issues most central to the Moral Majority's priorities until it folded in 1989. For many gay people, the surprise at the outcome of all the campaigns in 1977 and 1978 instilled a new <b>determination</b> <b>and</b> consolidated activism and communities in many cities where the gay community had not been politically active.|$|E
5|$|IAU {{protocol}} is that discovery {{credit for}} a minor planet goes to whoever first submits {{a report to the}} MPC with enough positional data for a decent orbit <b>determination,</b> <b>and</b> that the credited discoverer has priority in naming it. This was Ortiz et al., and they proposed the name Ataecina, an Iberian goddess of the underworld. She is the equivalent of the Roman goddess Proserpina, who was in turn one of Pluto's lovers. However, as a chthonic deity, Ataecina would only have been an appropriate name for an object in orbital resonance with Neptune, which Haumea was not.|$|E

Towards {{the end of his}} life, forfeiting the affection and loyalty even of his courtiers and family he became a lonely figure, isolated by suspicion and mistrust. But, in spite of all, the name of this great defender of the faith {{is one of the most}} memorable in Ethiopian history.|$|E

5|$|Rupert is {{probably}} best remembered today {{for his role as}} a Royalist commander during the English Civil War. He had considerable success during the initial years of the war, his drive, <b>determination</b> <b>and</b> experience of European techniques bringing him early victories. As the war progressed, Rupert's youth and lack of maturity in managing his relationships with other Royalist commanders ultimately resulted in his removal from his post and ultimate retirement from the war. Throughout the conflict, however, Rupert also enjoyed a powerful symbolic position: he was an iconic Royalist Cavalier and as such was frequently the subject of both Parliamentarian and Royalist propaganda, an image which has endured over the years.|$|E
5|$|A seventh-century work, the Sandong Zhunang ("Pearly Bag of the Three Caverns"), embellished the {{relationship}} between Laozi and Yinxi. Laozi pretended to be a farmer when reaching the western gate, but was recognized by Yinxi, who asked to be taught by the great master. Laozi was not satisfied by simply being noticed by the guard and demanded an explanation. Yinxi expressed his deep desire to find the Tao and explained that his long study of astrology allowed him to recognize Laozi's approach. Yinxi was accepted by Laozi as a disciple. This is considered an exemplary interaction between Daoist master and disciple, reflecting the testing a seeker must undergo before being accepted. A would-be adherent is expected to prove his <b>determination</b> <b>and</b> talent, clearly expressing his wishes and showing {{that he had made}} progress on his own towards realizing the Tao.|$|E
40|$|The Australian Taxation Office {{recently}} issued two draft determinations, TD 2008 / 4 and TD 2008 / 5, {{for public}} comment, {{dealing with the}} proposed tax treatment of deferred purchase agreement (DPA) warrants, and proposing that a DPA warrant is not a "security" {{within the meaning of}} the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 (Cth). According to the preliminary view of the Commissioner of Taxation, the tax treatment of a DPA warrant would ordinarily give rise to a capital gain or loss; however, the Commissioner also describes circumstances where the gain arising from a DPA warrant could be treated as assessable income.
