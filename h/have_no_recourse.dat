25|$|As noted above, a local {{government}} may only {{enter into a}} contract that is within the scope of its charter. A contract to do something beyond its power is void and unenforceable, and in fact the {{local government}} will be prohibited from performing its obligations under such a contract. The private party who performs under such a contract will have no means of recovery, even under equitable theories such as equitable estoppel, implied contract, quantum meruit, and unjust enrichment. This limitation also applies where the subject of the contract is permissible under the charter, but {{the manner in which the}} contract is made or awarded violates proscriptions set forth in the charter. For example, if the charter requires that contracts for provision of a public service be awarded to the lowest bidder in an open bidding process, and such a process is not used to award the contract, then the contract itself is void and the private party to the contract will <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>recourse</b> to enforce the local government's obligations thereunder.|$|E
500|$|Murray {{was elected}} {{chief justice of}} the Howard Court of Peers, the highest student {{position}} at Howard, and in 1944 she was graduated first in her class. Traditionally, men who were graduated first in the class were awarded Julius Rosenwald Fellowships for graduate work at Harvard University, but that university did not accept women. Murray was rejected despite a letter of support from President Roosevelt. She wrote in response, [...] "I would gladly change my sex to meet your requirements, but since the way to such change has not been revealed to me, I <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>recourse</b> but to appeal to you to change your minds.

The next day Ailes withdrew the gift.|$|E
2500|$|South Africa {{became the}} first African nation to legalize {{same-sex}} marriage in 2006, and it remains the only African country where same-sex marriage is legal. Despite this uptick in tolerance of the LGBT community in South Africa, so-called corrective rapes have become prevalent in response, primarily targeting the poorer women who live in townships and those who <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>recourse</b> {{in responding to the}} crimes because of the notable lack of police presence and prejudice they may face for reporting assaults.|$|E

"Before {{we go on}} the {{offensive}} politically or militarily we take the greatest defensive precautions possible to ensure success, e.g. we do not advocate a United Ireland {{without being able to}} justify our right to such a state as opposed to partition; we do not employ revolutionary violence as our means without being able to illustrate that we <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>recourse</b> to any other means. Or in more everyday simple terms: we do not claim {{that we are going to}} escalate the war if we cannot do just that; we do not mount an operation without first having ensured that we have taken the necessary defensive precautions of accurate intelligence, security, that weapons are in proper working order with proper ammunition and that the volunteers involved know how to handle interrogations in the event of their capture etc, and of course that the operation itself enhances rather than alienates our supporters." ...|$|E

Their miscarriage is owing, alas! to want of matter.

60|$|DEAR REDPATH,--I {{wish you}} would get me {{released}} from the lecture at Buffalo. I mortally hate that society there, and I don't doubt they hired me. I once gave them a packed house free of charge, and they never even had the common politeness to thank me. They left me to shift for myself, too, a la Bret Harte at Harvard. Get me rid of Buffalo! Otherwise I'll <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>recourse</b> left but to get sick the day I lecture there. I can get sick easy enough, by the simple process of saying the word--well never mind what word--I {{am not going to}} lecture there.|$|E
60|$|My dear Fanny--I {{have had}} no return of the {{spitting}} of blood, and {{for two or three}} days have been getting a little stronger. I have no hopes of an entire re-establishment of my health under some months of patience. My Physician tells me I must contrive to pass the Winter in Italy. This is all very unfortunate for us--we <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>recourse</b> but patience, which I am now practising better than ever I thought it possible for me. I have this moment received a Letter from Mr. Brown, dated Dunvegan Castle, Island of Skye. He is very well in health and spirits. My new publication has been out for some days and I have directed a Copy to be bound for you, which you will receive shortly. No one can regret Mr. Hodgkinson's ill fortune: I must own illness has not made such a Saint of me as to prevent my rejoicing at his reverse. Keep yourself in as good hopes as possible; in case my illness should continue an unreasonable time many of my friends would I trust for my sake do all in their power to console and amuse you, at the least word from me--You may depend upon it that in case my strength returns I will do all in my power to extricate you from the Abbeys. Be above all things careful of your health which is the corner stone of all pleasure.|$|E
