The dry red powder from roselle calyces was produced using spray-drying technique using four different <b>encapsulating</b> <b>agents,</b> i. e., maltodextrin, gum arabic, {{a combination of}} maltodextrin and gum arabic, and soluble starch. The four types of matrices increased the half-life of the pigments during heat treatment, especially at 98 C (P < 0. 05), compared with the roselle extract as the control.

It is hypothesized that addition of natural prebiotics from dahlia tuber, soybean and garlic can stimulate the growth of probiotic (L. acidophilus Dad 13) in MRS broth medium. Parameters evaluated were size and weight of capsule, number of cells in the capsule, acid and bile salt resistance of the biocapsule produced from carragenan and chitosan added with flours of dahlia tuber, soybean and garlic as the sources of natural prebiotic. The randomized complete block design {{was used as the}} experimental design with two factors. The first factor was the <b>encapsulating</b> <b>agents</b> (A 1 carragenan, A 2 chitosan) and second factor was the sources of natural prebiotic (P 1 dahlia tuber, P 2 garlic, P 3 soybean).

The rate of this base catalyzed exchange {{process has been}} measured using chemical exchange saturation transfer (CEST) NMR techniques {{as a function of}} solution pH for various paramagnetic LnDOTA-(gly) 4 − complexes to evaluate the effects of lanthanide ion size on this process. Complexes with Tb(III), Dy(III), Tm(III) and Yb(III) were chosen because these ions induce large hyperfine shifts in all ligand protons, including the exchanging amide protons. The magnitude of the amide proton CEST exchange signal differed for the four paramagnetic complexes in order, Yb>Tm>Tb>Dy. Although the Dy(III) complex showed the largest hyperfine shift as expected, the combination of favorable chemical shift and amide proton CEST linewidth in the Tm(III) complex was deemed most favorable for future in vivo applications where tissue magnetization effects can interfere. TmDOTA-(gly) 4 − at various concentrations was encapsulated in the core interior of liposomes to yield lipoCEST particles for molecular imaging. The resulting nanoparticles showed less than 1 % leakage of the agent from the interior over a range of temperatures and pH. The pH versus amide proton CEST curves differed for the free versus <b>encapsulated</b> <b>agents</b> over the acidic pH regions, consistent with a lower proton permeability across the liposomal bilayer for the <b>encapsulated</b> <b>agent.</b> Nevertheless, the resulting lipoCEST nanoparticles amplify the CEST sensitivity by a factor of ∼ 104 compared to the free, un-encapsulated agent.
