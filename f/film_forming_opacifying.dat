Materials & Methods: The films were prepared by solvent casting method. Prepared strips were evaluated for <b>film</b> <b>forming</b> capacity, visual appearance and disintegration time. The different polymers were explored for the formulation of strip such as HPMC E- 15, HPMC K 4 M, HPMC E- 5, PVA, PVP, Gelatin, Eudragite RL 100, and Pullulan with different excipients such as carrageen, guar gum.

Conclusion: Very transparent visual appearance, Best <b>film</b> <b>forming</b> capacity and least disintegration time of pullulan strips were observed in the study.

40|$|The {{dissolution}} behaviour in sulphate solutions {{of so-called}} non-porous anodic alumina <b>films</b> and <b>films</b> <b>formed</b> in dry oxygen and i n a moist oxygen atmosphere on chemically polished aluminium has "been investigated. Evidence is presented {{which indicates that}} the non-porous anodic <b>films,</b> <b>formed</b> at 7 - 30 volts, consisted of two regions, a thin, less soluble region adjacent to the metal and a thicker, more soluble outer region into which hydroxyl ions were incorporated. The structure {{might be related to}} the initial method of surface preparation adopted. It is suggested that <b>films</b> <b>formed</b> in dry oxygen at 500 C consist of crystalline Y-alumina, whilst those formed in the moist oxygen atmosphere a t 500 C possibly consist of amorphous alumina with someadsorbed water and are less faulted than the crystalline oxide. Again, there is some indication that the structure of these filmsis strongly influenced by the initial method of surface preparation used. The dissolution behaviour of the anodic <b>films</b> and <b>films</b> <b>formed</b> in dry oxygen at 500 C can be understood in terms of the extent of sulphate ion adsorption, apparently greater under the same conditions for the former type, and its effect on rate of transfer of protons, hydroxyl ions and water across the oxide/solution interface. A reaction scheme, proposed earlier to account for the behaviour during dissolution of the barrier layer of porous <b>films</b> <b>formed</b> anodically in sulphuric acid, appears adequate to explain the dissolution behaviour observed in the present studies. However, the type of behaviour, although rather similar for both' anodic non-porous and <b>films</b> <b>formed</b> in dry oxygen at 500 C, was quite different from the barrier layer of porous <b>films</b> <b>formed</b> anodically in sulphuric acid...|$|R

The paper set up the fine boring squeezed liquid film damped system of multi degree of freedom vibration simulation model and solve mathematical model by transfer matrix theory. The damping coefficient for the fine boring system can be obtained. The mechanical device of liquid film damping system is established. 20 # machine oil, 40 # machine oil, and cutting fluid are used to the system.

40|$|<b>Film</b> <b>forming</b> systems offer {{a number}} of {{advantages}} for topical and transdermal drug delivery, in particular enabling production of a supersaturated state which can greatly improve drug absorption and bioavailability. However the suitability of individual <b>film</b> <b>forming</b> polymers to stabilise the supersaturated state and optimise delivery of drugs is not well understood. This study reports the use of differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) to measure the solubility of methylphenidate both as the free base and as the hydrochloride salt in two polymethacrylate copolymers, Eudragit RS (EuRS) and Eudragit E (EuE) and relates this {{to the ability of}} <b>films</b> <b>formed</b> using these polymers to deliver methylphenidate across a model membrane. EuRS provided greater methylphenidate delivery when the drug was formulated as the free base in comparison EuE because the lower solubility of the drug in EuRS provided a higher degree of drug saturation in the polymeric film. In contrast EuE provided greater delivery of methylphenidate hydrochloride as EuRS could not prevent its crystallisation from a supersaturated state. Methylphenidate flux across the membrane could be directly related to degree of saturation of the drug in the film formulation as estimated by the drug solubility in the individual polymers demonstrating the importance of drug solubility in the polymer included in <b>film</b> <b>forming</b> systems for topical/transdermal drug delivery. In addition DSC has been demonstrated to be a useful tool for determining the solubility of drugs in polymers used in <b>film</b> <b>forming</b> systems and the approaches outlined here are likely to be useful for predicting the suitability of polymers for particular drugs in <b>film</b> <b>forming</b> transdermal drug delivery systems...|$|R

The evalu-ation focuses on the characteristics crucial for barrier layer usage, such as step coverage, N/Ti atomic concentration ratio, x, in TiNs, and C 1 content. Film resistivities are also measured. Excellent step coverage is confirmed. A high-aspect-ratio hole, such as one with a diameter of 0. 5 i~m and a depth of 0. 8 ~m, is completely filled by TiN film. The atomic concentra-tion ratio x for <b>films</b> <b>formed</b> at 500 ~ 176 is nearly equal to 1. Reduction i the C 1 content coming from the source material, TIC 14, {{is a matter of}} concern. High-temperature d position is very effective in reducing C 1 content. A film deposited at 700 ~ contains < 1 atom percent (a/o) of C 1, much less than <b>films</b> <b>formed</b> at lower temperatures contain.

Golden Delicious to further assess the efficacy of foliar applied <b>film</b> <b>forming</b> polymers as scab protectant compounds. All <b>film</b> <b>forming</b> polymers used in this investigation (Bond, Designer, Nu-Film P, Spray Gard, Moisturin, Companion PCT 12) inhibited germination of conidia, subsequent formation of appressoria and reduced leaf scab severity using a detached leaf bioassay. Regardless of treatment, there were no obvious trends in the percentage of conidia with one to four appressoria 5 days after inoculation. The synthetic fungicide penconazole resulted in the greatest levels of germination inhibition, appressorium development and least leaf scab severity. Under field conditions, scab severity on leaves and fruit of apple cv. Golden Delicious treated with a <b>film</b> <b>forming</b> polymer (Bond, Spray Gard, Moisturin) was less than on untreated controls. However, greatest protection in both field trials was provided by the synthetic fungicide penconazole. Higher chlorophyll fluorescence Fv/Fm emissions in polymer and penconazole treated trees indicated less damage to the leaf photosynthetic system as a result of fungal invasion. In addition, higher SPAD values as measures of leaf chlorophyll content were recorded in polymer and penconazole treated trees. Application of a <b>film</b> <b>forming</b> polymer or penconazole resulted in a higher apple yield per tree at harvest in both the 2005 and 2006 field trials compared to untreated controls. Results suggest application of an appropriate <b>film</b> <b>forming</b> polymer may provide a useful addition to existing methods of apple scab management. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.
