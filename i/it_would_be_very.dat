5|$|How these {{clusters}} {{are formed}} {{is not yet}} known, but their formation might well be related to that of globular clusters. Why M31 has such clusters, while the Milky Way does not, is not yet known. It is also unknown if any other galaxy contains these types of clusters, but <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>very</b> unlikely that M31 is the sole galaxy with extended clusters.|$|E
5|$|Though the album's {{release date}} was {{originally}} scheduled for November 26, 2013, Funk Volume announced on their Facebook page on November 18 that <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>very</b> {{hard to find}} Knock Madness in stores {{the first week of}} its release, due to a delay and few stores placing orders for the album. However, instead of pushing back the release date as announced, Funk Volume decided to release the album on its initial date of November 26, for digital download and compact disc format through their website. The album was then released in compact disc format in retail stores on December 3, 2013.|$|E
5|$|Since {{the patrol}} boats of Squadron One were an {{essential}} part of the blockade of war supplies entering South Vietnam from North Vietnam, it was decided that they would be transferred to the South Vietnamese navy after crews had been trained to operate them effectively. On 2 November 1968, Zumwalt, Commander, Naval Forces Vietnam, presented a plan to General Creighton W. Abrams, Commander, MACV to turn over all U.S. Navy and U.S. Coast Guard resources to the RVN by 30 June 1970. Abrams approved the Navy's plan with the caveat that any equipment turned over to the Vietnamese would have to be in first-class condition and that they would have to be properly trained in its use. The Navy plan called for the enlisted Vietnamese personnel to report aboard vessels for training first with the officers finally reporting aboard after the crews were trained. In a recommendation made 14 January 1969, the Commander, Coast Guard Activities Vietnam, Captain Ralph W. Niesz, suggested that English speaking Vietnamese officers report aboard first and be given the chance to receive extensive procedural training with Coast Guard crews before any junior personnel report aboard. Neisz cited cultural imperatives that required seniors to be more knowledgeable than subordinates and that <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>very</b> difficult for officers to accept instruction from junior personnel without losing face. Zumwalt agreed with the Coast Guard plan enthusiastically and ordered it implemented immediately.|$|E

25|$|Although {{documentation}} can {{be maintained}} entirely in a vendor-specific presentation format such as WinHelp, it is more often the case that documentation must be published in multiple presentation formats at once: Microsoft Compiled HTML Help (CHM), WinHelp, HTML pages, Java Help, PDF, etc. <b>It</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>very</b> expensive and error-prone to maintain each format separately.|$|E

25|$|The {{mayor of}} the Mellieħa Local Council, Robert Cutajar, is {{attempting}} to restore the fort.

In 2014, Prime Minister Joseph Muscat stated that the government intends to rehabilitate the fort and the surrounding area.|$|E

25|$|Both trains were on {{the same}} section of single track that runs between the Chatsworth station (which is double tracked) through the Santa Susana Pass. The line returns to double track again as it enters the Simi Valley. Three tunnels under the pass are only wide enough to support a single track, and <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>very</b> costly to widen them. This single track section carries 24 {{passenger}} trains and 12 freight trains each day.|$|E
25|$|In 1983 a {{study by}} town and country {{planners}} of the Ministry of Works found that if a railway were to be constructed into the Taupo region, <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>very</b> beneficial in transporting logs and sawn timber out of the region to the Pulp and Paper Mill at Kawerau and for export through the Port of Tauranga. It was also found that such a line would break even with revenue made from it covering the costs of constructing it.|$|E
25|$|This {{rejected}} the Aguilar–Spinelli test {{and put in}} place a totality-of-the-circumstances standard. This was put into place because the court recognized that there was more evidence that the Gateses were involved in drug trafficking than just the letter standing alone. The court agreed that if the letter had just stood alone it would not be probable cause to get a warrant. The court also recognized that under the Aguilar–Spinelli two-pronged test, <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>very</b> hard for the “reliability” prong to ever be satisfied from an anonymous tip so it therefore should be abandoned.|$|E

25|$|The road's {{northern}} terminus {{had still}} not been settled. In 1942 state highway commissioner H.O. Schermerhorn suggested {{it might be}} more useful if the road veered west north of Chatham towards Albany to connect to a proposed bridge over the Hudson there. The TSPC inspected the proposed route and found <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>very</b> expensive to acquire and build, and in 1943 Schermerhorn agreed that the Taconic should continue on its planned course northwards. Three years later, in 1946, the commission also considered the Hyde Park extension proposed by the recently deceased Roosevelt, but dropped it as construction was resuming {{with the end of the}} war.|$|E
25|$|Leinart {{was named}} the Cardinals' {{starting}} quarterback going into the 2008 off-season, but Ken Whisenhunt stated that <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>very</b> possible for Warner to be the starter before week one of the regular season. Indeed, Warner {{was named the}} starter on August 30, 2008. That season, Warner had 4,583 passing yards, 30 touchdowns, and a completion percentage of 67.1%. He was the top ranked passer in the National Football Conference for the third time, and only trailed Phillip Rivers and Chad Pennington of the AFC in NFL passer rating for the season. Warner also received FedEx Air Player of the Week honors for his performance during weeks 9 and 11 of the season.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the main}} {{differences}} between this theory and Jeremy Bentham's rational choice theory, which had been abandoned in criminology, is that if Bentham considered it possible to completely annihilate crime (through the panopticon), Becker's theory acknowledged that a society could not eradicate crime beneath a certain level. For example, if 25% of a supermarket's products were stolen, <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>very</b> easy to reduce this rate to 15%, quite easy to reduce it until 5%, difficult to reduce it under 3% and nearly impossible to reduce it to zero (a feat which would cost the supermarket so much in surveillance, etc., that it would outweigh the benefits). This reveals that the goals of utilitarianism and classical liberalism have to be tempered and reduced to more modest proposals to be practically applicable.|$|E
