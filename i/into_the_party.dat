5|$|Michael {{tries to}} {{introduce}} another murder and other twists {{to the story}} to pull his staff back <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>party.</b> This infuriates Jim to his breaking point, and they hold a private talk in Michael's office. Michael snaps at Jim and points out that he is doing this to keep the office calm. CFO David Wallace (Andy Buckley) finally returns the phone calls to Jim, and reveals that while nothing has been officially decided yet, Dunder Mifflin {{is expected to be}} insolvent by year-end. Jim hides the news from the staff and nudges them back <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>party.</b> Jim finally realizes that Michael was doing this to help his co-workers cope. At the end of the episode, Michael, Dwight, Andy, and Pam find themselves in a fake Mexican standoff lasting until 6:00 at night. Jim pulls Pam out so they can go home, and the others pretend to shoot each other to death.|$|E

Materia have a limited number of uses before they must be recharged at one of the game's magic shops.

Characters can swap materia among themselves, with unequipped materia being used mid-battle for such things as healing party members, compensating for the limited amount of healing items.|$|E

5|$|In {{the early}} 1840s Caxias {{became a member}} of the Reactionary Party, which evolved <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>Party</b> of Order and finally the Conservative Party. He was elected senator in 1846. The Emperor {{appointed}} him president of the Council of Ministers (prime minister) in 1856; he briefly held that office again in 1861, but fell when his party lost its parliamentary majority. Over the decades Caxias witnessed the growth and zenith of his party, then its slow decline as internal conflict divided it. In 1875, he headed a cabinet for the last time, and after years of failing health he died in May 1880.|$|E
5|$|Long {{decided in}} 1888 {{not to run}} for another term in Congress, {{and spent the next}} eight years in private practice. His clients were {{typically}} corporate interests, and he appeared on their behalf in court as well as in legislative committee hearings. He was sought after as a public speaker, something he engaged in for many years. He remained somewhat active in Republican Party circles, supporting Roger Wolcott's Young Men's Republican Club, which sought to bring new blood <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>party.</b> When offered the opportunity to challenge longtime Republican Senator George Frisbie Hoar, he refused. In 1889 he was appointed to the committee overseeing the enlargement of the Massachusetts State House, a post he held until 1897.|$|E
5|$|Goldsmith {{had prior}} {{political}} experience, having been elected as a Member of the European Parliament (MEP) in France {{as part of}} the Eurosceptic Movement for France coalition in June 1994. Although his father had been a Member of Parliament representing Britain's Conservative Party, and he had personally had a close relationship to the party when it was led by Margaret Thatcher, Goldsmith wanted to launch his campaign independently of the Conservatives, hoping that it could draw on cross-party concerns about the direction of the EU. At the time of the party's formation, Goldsmith had an estimated personal wealth of £800 million, and promised to put £20 million <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>party.</b> He pledged to spend at least £10 million on campaigning for the next general election, to ensure that his party was funded to the same extent as the country's larger political parties. Goldsmith's intervention in British politics has been compared to that of the multi-millionaires Ross Perot in the United States and Silvio Berlusconi in Italy.|$|E

5|$|In the {{aftermath}} of Dom PedroI's abdication in 1831, a regency created to govern Brazil during the minority of the former Emperor's son, Dom PedroII, soon dissolved into chaos. Paraná formed a political party in 1837 that {{became known as the}} Reactionary Party, which evolved <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>Party</b> of Order in the early 1840s and in the mid-1850s into the Conservative Party. He and his party's stalwart and unconditional defence of constitutional order allowed the country to move beyond a regency plagued by factious disputes and rebellions that might easily have led to a dictatorship. Appointed president of Rio de Janeiro Province in 1841, Paraná helped put down a rebellion headed by the opposition Liberal Party the following year. Also in 1842, he was elected senator for Minas Gerais and appointed by PedroII to the Council of State. In 1843, he became the de facto first president (prime minister) of the Council of Ministers, but resigned after a quarrel with the Emperor.|$|E
5|$|The {{conservative}} Moderate {{opposition to}} Feijó had close links to coffee and sugar cane planter families and merchants in the Brazilian southeast and northeast. These groups wielded great political, {{social and economic}} influence. They began to see their interests more in alignment with men like Honório Hermeto, who were planters like themselves—people who supported the slave trade with Africa and desired a centralized state able to impose order. The often strongheaded Honório Hermeto, swallowing his pride, set aside his enmity toward Vasconcelos in pursuit of an alliance. Dubbed the Reactionary Party by Feijó and his allies in 1837, the conservative Moderate opposition born in late 1834 was the genesis of what would evolve <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>Party</b> of Order (c. 1843) and finally into the Conservative Party (c. 1853).|$|E

25|$|Those {{representatives of}} the bourgeoisie who have sneaked <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>Party,</b> the government, the army, and various spheres of culture {{are a bunch of}} counter-revolutionary revisionists. Once {{conditions}} are ripe, they will seize political power and turn the dictatorship of the proletariat into a dictatorship of the bourgeoisie.

Some are still trusted by us and are being trained as our successors, persons like Khruschev for example, who are still nestling beside us.|$|E

Progressively, the Front lost its character as a national government or generic coalition, and became vulnerable to criticism for using its appeal as the first institution involved in power sharing, while engaging itself in political battles with forces that could not enjoy this status, nor the credibility.|$|E
25|$|Raštikis had {{a tenuous}} {{relationship}} with the Lithuanian Nationalist Union, the ruling political party in Lithuania. He was {{not a member of}} the party and was generally favorable to the opposition. The Union disapproved of Raštikis' attempts at keeping the army impartial, his prohibition of officer involvement in politics, and his growing prestige and popularity among Lithuanians. In particular, the Union wanted to turn the Lithuanian Riflemen's Union <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>party</b> organ by merging it with Young Lithuania, party's youth organization, but Raštikis opposed such plans and the Riflemen remained open to everyone.|$|E

25|$|Although MGR's {{charisma}} probably {{played a}} significant role in DMK's success, his popularity also cost the party much. When the party leaders tried to neutralise his powers, MGR launched his own party in 1972, the All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam, with support of the lower cadres alone. According to Professor Hardgrave one of the reasons for antipathy between MGR and the DMK leadership was Karunanidhi's attempt to bring his son M. K. Muthu <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>party</b> to replace MGR and to convert MGR fan clubs into Muthu fan clubs. The fictionalised account of the troubled relationship between Karunanidhi and MGR was later portrayed in the Tamil film Iruvar (The Duo) in 1997.|$|E
25|$|During these {{sessions}} the Federalist Party {{was so small}} and weak that partisan divisions mattered {{much less than the}} personal relationships that developed among the members. McLane quickly became a friend and admirer of William H. Crawford and Martin Van Buren, {{and at the same time}} became an opponent of Henry Clay and John Quincy Adams. These friendships were based more on personality than policy agreement, and were so important that McLane was one of Crawford’s strongest proponents in the presidential election of 1824. Once Crawford returned to Georgia, McLane, Van Buren, and the other Crawford supporters fell <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>party</b> of Andrew Jackson. This was all the easier for him given his existing friendship with Martin Van Buren, who became his mentor and advocate.|$|E
25|$|Born in Gjirokastër in 1908, Hoxha {{became a}} teacher in grammar school in 1936.

He entered <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>Party</b> of Labour of Albania following its creation in 1941. Hoxha was elected First Secretary in March 1943 at the age of 34. The Yugoslav Partisans assisted the Albanians, but communication was limited and Hoxha disagreed with their goal of preventing the creation of a Greater Albania. Less than two years after the liberation of the country, the monarchy was abolished, King Zog was deposed and Hoxha rose to power as the head of state of Albania.|$|E
