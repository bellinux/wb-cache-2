However, this rule was changed in 2011 barring Puerto Rican submissions.|$|E

25|$|In the United States {{there has}} never been a {{national}} political party called the Conservative Party. All major American political parties support republicanism and the basic classical liberal ideals on which the country was founded in 1776, emphasizing liberty, the pursuit of happiness, the rule of law, the consent of the governed, opposition to aristocracy, and fear of corruption, coupled with equal rights. Political divisions <b>inside</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States</b> often seemed minor or trivial to Europeans, where the divide between the Left and the Right led to violent polarization, starting with the French Revolution.|$|E

40|$|Prior to 1900, the {{practice}} of diving <b>inside</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>State</b> Navy was primarily taught through on-the-job training. A course had been developed at the Navy 2 ̆ 7 s Torpedo Station at Newport, Rhode Island, but only a very limited number of personel went through that formal training. Shipboard divers learned from their shipmates and used whatever equipment happened to be at hand. It was {{as a result of}} this situation that Chief Gunner George Stillson felt compelled to write to the Department of the Navy and suggest that both training and equipment of Navy divers be standardized. Virtually every book on diving, civilian and military, mentions the subsequent achievements of Gunner Stillson, but almost nothing is known about the man himself. I am currently writing a book to rectify this situation. This presentation will give a brief overview of my research to date as well as cover the additional information I hope to locate during my Spring 2013 sabbatical...|$|R

25|$|As known, all films {{produced}} <b>inside</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States</b> {{have been}} ineligible for {{consideration for the}} Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film regardless {{of the language of}} their dialogue track. This fact also included films produced in U.S. overseas possessions. However, Puerto Rico is an unincorporated territory of the United States and used to be eligible due to Puerto Ricans having had American citizenship since 1917. Their best success in this award was receiving a nomination for Santiago, the Story of his New Life (1989). However, as of 2011, the Academy had decided not to allow submissions from the territory anymore.|$|E
25|$|In reality, however, {{this is not}} correct. It is true that Nunó, Henneman and Hill did {{register}} the music with the company BMI (BMI Work #568879), with the Edward B. Marks Music Company as the listed publisher of the anthem. This might be the version that some have suggested is copyrighted in the United States. However, United States copyright law declares the Mexican anthem {{to be in the}} public domain <b>inside</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States,</b> since both the lyrics and music were published before 1909. Furthermore, under Mexican copyright law, Article 155 states that the government holds moral rights, but not property rights, of the national symbols, including the anthem, coat of arms and the national flag.|$|E
25|$|Some of {{the revenue}} of the Gulf Cartel is often laundered in several bank accounts, properties, vehicles, and {{gasoline}} stations. Bars and casinos are often the hubs for money laundering of the drug cartels. Top leaders of the Gulf organization, like Juan García Ábrego, Osiel Cárdenas, Jorge Eduardo Costilla Sánchez, and Antonio Cárdenas Guillén, among others, have been charged by the U.S. government for laundering millions of dollars. Bank accounts <b>inside</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States</b> also launder {{millions of dollars for}} the drug lords of the Gulf Cartel. The Economist mentioned in 1997 that the drug money from the Gulf Cartel in the Rio Grande Valley was perhaps moving about $20 billion, and that around 15% of the retailers' gains were from drug money.|$|E

5000|$|Close U.S. {{government}} {{identification with}} corrupt elements of Russia's political establishment risks serious popular backlash <b>inside</b> Russia. <b>The</b> <b>United</b> <b>States</b> must avoid <b>the</b> appearance of unqualified support {{for what is}} routinely seen as a kleptocratic establishment. Such linkage reinforces a growing popular perception that democratic political and market economic systems are merely code words for rapacious criminality. <b>The</b> <b>United</b> <b>States</b> should address this perception by increasing its public diplomacy discussion of the causes and cures for ROC.|$|R

25|$|If an {{asylum seeker}} is <b>inside</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States</b> {{and has not}} been placed in removal proceedings, he or she may file an {{application}} with U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, regardless of his or her legal status in the United States. However, if the asylum seeker is not in valid immigration status and USCIS does not grant the asylum application, USCIS may place the applicant in removal proceedings, in that case a judge will consider the application anew. The immigration judge may also consider the applicant for relief that the asylum office has no jurisdiction to grant, such as withholding of removal and protection under the Convention Against Torture. Since the effective date of the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act passed in 1996, an applicant must apply for asylum within one year of entry or be barred from doing so unless the applicant can establish changed circumstances that are material to his or her eligibility for asylum or exceptional circumstances related to the delay.|$|E
25|$|Established <b>inside</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States</b> Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware, the Panel is {{tasked with}} {{evaluating}} {{the conclusion of}} the Secretary of the Treasury that a company is in (or in danger of) default. The Panel consists of three bankruptcy judges drawn from the District of Delaware, all of whom are appointed by the Chief Judge of the United States Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware. In his appointments, the Chief Judge is instructed to weigh the financial expertise of the candidates. If the Panel concurs with the Secretary, the company in question is permitted to be placed into receivership; if they do not concur, the Secretary has an opportunity to amend and refile his or her petition. In the event that a Panel decision is appealed, the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit has jurisdiction; in the event of further appeal, a writ of certiorari may be filed with the United States Supreme Court. In all appellate events, the scope of review is limited to whether the decision of the Secretary that a company is in (or in danger of) default is supported by substantial evidence.|$|E
