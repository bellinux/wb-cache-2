40|$|Generation of {{energetic}} (<b>hot)</b> <b>electrons</b> is {{an intrinsic}} property of any plasmonic nanostructure under illumination. Simultaneously, a striking advantage of metal nanocrystals over semiconductors lies in their very large absorption cross sections. Therefore, metal nanostructures with strong and tailored plasmonic resonances are very attractive for photocatalytic applications. However, the central questions regarding plasmonic <b>hot</b> <b>electrons</b> are how to quantify and extract the optically-excited energetic electrons in a nanocrystal. We develop a theory describing the generation {{rates and the}} energy-distributions of <b>hot</b> <b>electrons</b> in nanocrystals with various geometries. In our theory, <b>hot</b> <b>electrons</b> are generated owing to surfaces and hot spots. The formalism predicts that large optically-excited nanocrystals show the excitation of mostly low-energy Drude electrons, whereas plasmons in small nanocrystals involve mostly <b>hot</b> <b>electrons.</b> The energy distributions of electrons in an optically-excited nanocrystal show how the quantum many-body state in small particles evolves towards the classical state described by the Drude model when increasing nanocrystal size. We show {{that the rate of}} surface decay of plasmons in nanocrystals {{is directly related to the}} rate of generation of <b>hot</b> <b>electrons.</b> Based on a detailed many-body theory involving kinetic coefficients, we formulate a simple scheme describing the plasmon's dephasing. In most nanocrystals, the main decay mechanism of a plasmon is the Drude friction-like process and the secondary path comes from generation of <b>hot</b> <b>electrons</b> due to surfaces and electromagnetic hot spots. This latter path strongly depends on the size, shape and material of the nanocrystal, correspondingly affecting its efficiency of hot-electron production. The results in the paper can be used to guide the design of plasmonic nanomaterials for photochemistry and photodetectors. Comment: 90 pages, 21 figures, including Supplementary Informatio...|$|R
