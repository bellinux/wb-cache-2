500|$|In a December 18, 2000 {{article for}} People {{magazine}} entitled [...] "Bad to Worse", Downey's stepmother Rosemary told author Alex Tresnlowski that Downey {{had been diagnosed}} with bipolar disorder [...] "a few years ago" [...] and added that his bipolar disorder was [...] "the reason he has a hard time staying sober. What hasn't been tried is medication and intensive psychotherapy." [...] In the same article, Dr. Manijeh Nikakhtar, a Los Angeles psychiatrist and co-author of Addiction or Self-Medication: The Truth (...) , says she received a letter from Downey in 1999, during his time at Corcoran II, asking for advice on his condition. She discovered that [...] "no one had done a complete [...] evaluation ...I asked him flat out if he thought he was bipolar, and he said, 'Oh yeah. There are times I {{spend a lot of money}} and I'm hyperactive, and there are other times I'm down.'" [...] In an article for the March 2007 issue of Esquire, Downey told author Scott Raab that he wanted to address [...] "this whole thing about the bipolar" [...] after receiving a phone call from [...] "the Bipolar Association" [...] asking him about being bipolar. When Downey denied he had ever said he was bipolar, the caller quoted the People article, to which Downey replied, [...] "'No! Dr. Malibusian said ...', and they go, 'Well, it's been written, so we're going to quote it.'" [...] Downey flatly denied being [...] "depressed or manic" [...] and that previous attempts to diagnose him with any kind of psychiatric or mood disorder have always been skewed because [...] "the guy <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>seeing</b> didn't know I was smokin' crack in his bathroom. You can't make a diagnosis until somebody's sober." ...|$|E
2500|$|Kirby {{moved on}} to comic-book {{publisher}} and newspaper syndicator Fox Feature Syndicate, earning a then-reasonable $15-a-week salary. He began to explore superhero narrative with the comic strip The Blue Beetle, published [...] from January to March 1940, starring a character created by the pseudonymous Charles Nicholas, a house name that Kirby retained for the three-month-long strip. During this time, Kirby met and began collaborating with cartoonist and Fox editor Joe Simon, who {{in addition to his}} staff work continued to freelance. Simon recalled in 1988, [...] "I loved Jack's work and the first time I saw it I couldn't believe what <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>seeing.</b> He asked if we could do some freelance work together. I was delighted and I took him over to my little office. We worked from the second issue of Blue Bolt through... about 25 years." ...|$|E
2500|$|Bankhead was {{director}} Irving Rapper's first {{choice for the}} role of Amanda in the film version of Tennessee William's The Glass Menagerie. Laurette Taylor, who originated the role of Amanda, was an idol of Bankhead's and also an alcoholic, whose brilliant performance in the original Broadway production reversed years of career decline. Rapper called Bankhead's screen test the greatest performance he had ever seen: [...] "I {{thought she was going to}} be difficult, but she was like a child, so sweet and lovely. I was absolutely floored by her performance. It's the greatest test I've ever made or seen in my life. I couldn't believe <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>seeing</b> such reality. Bankhead was absolutely natural, so moving, so touching without even trying. The crew was stunned, too." [...] But studio head Jack Warner rejected the idea because of his fear of Tallulah's drinking; though she promised not to drink during shooting, he refused to give her the part. The role was given to Gertrude Lawrence instead, whose acting was panned by most critics.|$|E

6000|$|... "And if that's {{one of the}} proofs {{on which}} {{you are going to}} accuse my future {{son-in-law}} of having committed a murder, then all <b>I</b> can say <b>is,</b> Tom, that you and <b>I</b> <b>are</b> <b>seeing</b> the last of one another to-day." ...|$|R
2500|$|On August 14, United States Senator Claire McCaskill (D-MO) {{stated that}} [...] "militarization {{of the police}} {{escalated}} the protesters' response." [...] St. Louis Chief of Police Sam Dotson stated {{he would not have}} employed military-style policing such as that which transpired. According to Chief Dotson, [...] "My gut told me what <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>seeing</b> were not tactics that I would use in the city and I would never put officers in situations that I would not do myself." [...] Another reason Dotson did not want the city and county police to collaborate was because of the history of racial profiling by police in that county. In an email to a St. Louis Alderman who brought up concerns of racial profiling, he wrote: [...] "I agree and removed our tactical assistance. We did not send tactical resources to Ferguson on Tuesday or Wednesday. Our only assistance was that of four traffic officers to help divert traffic and keep both pedestrians and motorists safe. On Thursday we will have no officers assisting Ferguson." ...|$|E
2500|$|Wong {{descended from}} the rooftop to the street, where he got {{into his car and}} drove quickly toward the ruined railway station. When he arrived, he noted carnage and confusion: [...] "It was a horrible sight. People were still trying to get up. Dead and injured lay strewn across the tracks and platform. Limbs lay all over the place. Only my work helped me forget what <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>seeing.</b> I stopped to reload my camera. I noticed that my shoes were soaked with blood. I walked across the railway tracks, and made many long scenes with the burning {{overhead}} bridge in the background. Then I saw a man pick up a baby from the tracks and carry him to the platform. He went back to get another badly injured child. The mother lay dead on the tracks. As I filmed this tragedy, I heard the sound of planes returning. Quickly, I shot my remaining few feet [...] on the baby. I ran toward the child, intending to carry him to safety, but the father returned. The bombers passed overhead. No bombs were dropped." ...|$|E
2500|$|Producer Lionel Wigram {{remarked that}} for around ten years, {{he had been}} {{thinking}} of new ways to depict Sherlock Holmes. [...] "I realized the images <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>seeing</b> in my head [...] were different to the images I'd seen in previous films." [...] He imagined [...] "a much more modern, more bohemian character, who dresses more like an artist or a poet", namely Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec. After leaving his position as executive for Warner Bros. in 2006, Wigram sought a larger scope to the story so it could attract a large audience, and amalgamated various Holmes stories to flesh it out further. Some sequences in the movie were more than suggested by uncredited incidents found in a 1979 novel Enter the Lion: A Posthumous Memoir of Mycroft Holmes. Lord Blackwood's character was developed as a nod to Victorian interests in spiritualism and the later influence of Aleister Crowley. The producer felt he was [...] "almost clever" [...] pitting Holmes, who has an almost supernatural ability to solve crimes, against a supposedly supernatural villain. The plot point, moreover, nods to the Holmesian tale of The Hound of the Baskervilles, where a string of seemingly supernatural events is finally explained through intuitive reasoning and scientific savvy. Wigram wrote and John Watkiss drew a 25-page comic book about Holmes {{in place of a}} spec script.|$|E

5000|$|Baroness Vadera: [...] "Well, it's a very {{uncertain}} {{world right}} now globally but I wouldn't {{want to be the}} one predicting it. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>seeing</b> a few green shoots but it's a little bit too early to say exactly how they'll grow." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Gracious goodness!" [...] he muttered, [...] "it must be {{something}} is wrong with my eyes so that <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>seeing</b> red. I've already seen two birds dressed in red and now there's another. It certainly must be my eyes. There's Dotty the Tree Sparrow over there; I hear his voice. I wonder if he will look red." ...|$|R
2500|$|During the United States' Formalist {{period in}} literature, American writers admired Villa's work. Mark Van Doren wrote in {{reaction}} to Selected Poems and New that it is [...] "...So natural yet in its daring so weird, a poet rich and surprising, {{and not to be}} ignored". Babette Deutsch wrote in The New Republic that Have Come, Am Here reveals that Villa's concern for [...] "ultimate things, the self and the universe. He is also on visiting terms with the world. He is more interested in himself than in the universe, and he greets the world with but a decent urbanity." [...] Although she viewed Villa's range as somewhat narrow, he [...] "soars high and plunges deep". British poet Edith Sitwell revealed in the preface of Villa's Selected Poems and New that she experienced [...] "a shock" [...] upon reading Have Come, Am Here, most notably the poem [...] "#57", [...] "a strange poem of ineffable beauty, springing straight from the depths of Being. I hold {{that this is one of}} the most wonderful short poems of our time, and reading it I knew that <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>seeing</b> for the first time the work of a poet with a great, even an astonishing, and perfectly original gift." [...] Meanwhile, noted American poet Garret Hongo described Villa as [...] "one of the greatest pioneers of Asian American literature...our bitter, narcissistic angel of both late Modernism and early post-colonialism." [...] In his introduction to Footnote to Youth, American writer Edward J. O'Brien—who dedicated his collection Best American Short Stories of 1932 to Villa—hailed the poet as [...] "one of a half-dozen American short-story writers who count". [...] Meanwhile, {{in reaction to}} Villa's poems, e.e. cummings wrote, [...] "and i am alive to see a man against the sky".|$|E

6000|$|... "Well," [...] said Mrs. Barker {{a little}} impatiently, [...] "you didn't {{expect me to}} take him into the public parlor, where <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>seeing</b> visitors, did you? I sent him out with the nurse into the lower hall {{to play with the}} other children." ...|$|E
60|$|Asleep {{she was not}} unlovely, but {{the mouth}} twitched and the body was shaken with shiverings, {{and there was no}} peace in her at all. Daylight showed her purple-eyed, slack-cheeked, and staring, racked with a {{headache}} and the nervous twitches. Indeed <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>seeing</b> Life; but it did not amuse me, for I felt that I, though I only made capital of her extreme woe, was guilty equally with the rest of my kind that had brought her here.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, then, {{it was so}} far settled {{yesterday}} that I'm to take the management o' the woods. The captain sent for me t' offer it me, when <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>seeing</b> to the poles and things here and I've agreed to't. But if anybody asks any questions upstairs, just you take no notice, and turn the talk to something else, and I'll be obliged to you. Now, let us go on, for we're pretty nigh the last, I think." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Of course, <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>seeing</b> {{rather more}} of Charlie," [...] Letitia went on, [...] "but people won't take any notice of that.

6000|$|... "`Of course, of course. All right.' And {{then turning}} to the Shipping Master who sat there {{swinging}} his leg, {{he said that he}} certainly couldn't go to sea without a second officer. I stood by as if all these things were happening to some other chap whom <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>seeing</b> through with it. Mr Powell stared at me with those shining eyes of his. But that bothered skipper turns upon me again as though he wanted to snap my head off.|$|E
6000|$|The more I {{thought of}} Jackson's arm, the more shaken I was. I {{was confronted by}} the concrete. For the first time <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>seeing</b> life. My {{university}} life, and study and culture, had not been real. I had learned nothing but theories of life and society that looked all very well on the printed page, but now I had seen life itself. Jackson's arm was a fact of life. [...] "The fact, man, the irrefragable fact!" [...] of Ernest's was ringing in my consciousness.|$|E
6000|$|Agatha {{thought the}} newcomer's great pensive {{dark eyes and}} {{overhanging}} brow under very black hair made her look older than Mysie, or indeed than Gillian herself; and when the message had been disposed of, the latter continued, [...] "Dolores {{wanted to know about}} Miss Arthuret's lecture, being rather in that line herself.

5000|$|... "It {{is still}} a {{commonly}} accepted notion that the editor just [...] "cuts out all the bad bits." [...] I liken editing more to sculpture.

5000|$|We shall {{say that}} we have {{acquaintance}} with anything of which we are directly aware, without the intermediary of any process of inference or any knowledge of truths. Thus in the presence of my table <b>I</b> <b>am</b> acquainted with the sense-data that make up the appearance of my table—its colour, shape, hardness, smoothness, etc.; all these are things of which <b>I</b> <b>am</b> immediately conscious when <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>seeing</b> and touching my table. The particular shade of colour that <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>seeing</b> may have many things said about it—I may say that it is brown, that it is rather dark, and so on. But such statements, though they make me know truths about the colour, do not make me know the colour itself any better than I did before so far as concerns knowledge of the colour itself, as opposed to knowledge of truths about it, I know the colour perfectly and completely when I see it, and no further knowledge of it itself is even theoretically possible. Thus the sense-data which make up the appearance of my table are things with which I have acquaintance, things immediately known to me just as they are. (Russell) ...|$|R
60|$|She {{seemed to}} promise {{a way of}} escape from the {{deepening}} opposition in me between physical passions and the constructive career, the career of wide aims and human service, upon which I had embarked. All the time that <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>seeing</b> her as a beautiful, fragile, rather ineffective girl, I was also seeing her just as consciously as a shining slender figure, a radiant reconciliation, coming into my darkling disorders of lust and impulse. I could understand clearly that she was incapable of the most necessary subtleties of political thought, and yet I could contemplate praying to her and putting all the intricate troubles of my life at her feet.|$|E
6000|$|Life is such {{a curious}} {{succession}} of contradictions and surprises that I record here without comment the fact that <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>seeing</b> much more of Nancy since her marriage than I had in the years preceding it. A comradeship existed between us. I often dined at her house and {{had fallen into the}} habit of stopping there frequently on my way home in the evening. Ham did not seem to mind. What was clear, at any rate, was that Nancy, before marriage, had exacted some sort of an understanding by which her [...] "freedom" [...] was not to be interfered with. She was the first among us of the [...] "modern wives." ...|$|E
60|$|It {{was about}} this time that the {{warnings}} of coming events began to fall about us thick and fast. Ernest had already questioned father's policy of having socialists and labor leaders at his house, and of openly attending socialist meetings; and father had only laughed at him for his pains. As for myself, I was learning much from this contact with the working-class leaders and thinkers. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>seeing</b> {{the other side of}} the shield. I was delighted with the unselfishness and high idealism I encountered, though I was appalled by the vast philosophic and scientific literature of socialism that was opened up to me. I was learning fast, but I learned not fast enough to realize then the peril of our position.|$|E

50|$|Use of {{the present}} tense does not always imply present time. In particular, the present tense {{is often used to}} refer to future events (<b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>seeing</b> James tomorrow; My train leaves at 3 o'clock this afternoon). This is {{particularly}} the case in condition clauses and many other adverbial subordinate clauses: If you see him,...; As soon as they arrive... There is also the historical present, in which the present tense is used to narrate past events.|$|R
