Bond markets always played a smaller role and some people believe that the absence of large and robust local bond markets may have helped to cause the Asian crisis. True or not, Asian policymakers have focused on local bond market development since the crisis. Indeed, local bond markets have grown in size, but are still viewed as underdeveloped. This has raised the question, on the one hand, of whether there are too many restrictions that hamper market development.

While the scope of regulation varies from country to country, depending on the <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>liberalisation,</b> an increase in the overall cost of energy, and a shift from operating to capital costs will be relevant for all regulators. Where there is third party access to transmission, the tariffs may need to send stronger signals of the relative costs imposed by generators in different places, and may have significant effects on their profitability. Regulators responsible for generation revenues will have to allow peaking plants to recover their costs, even if those are rarely-used reserves to cope with intermittent renewable generation. Regulators in control of final prices charged to consumers will probably have to pass on a higher cost of energy, and determine how much is paid by different groups. The shift to renewable energy, however, will not change the fundamental tasks or nature of economic regulation. Economic regulation, renewable energy, electricity, transmission pricing...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: The {{sharp decline}} in the {{performance}} of international property markets has been central to the financial distress experienced globally. The Irish housing market experienced particularly strong rates of price increases and heightened activity levels by OECD standards. One reason cited for such large price increases has been the significant <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> financial <b>liberalisation</b> experienced by Irish credit institutions. The culmination of much <b>of</b> this <b>liberalisation</b> resulted in large increases in the availability of mortgage credit. In this paper we apply a recently developed model of mortgage credit and examine the implications for Irish house prices of changes in lending patterns. Our results suggest that post 2003, a significant amount of the increase in Irish prices was determined by innovative developments in international finance, which enabled Irish institutions, in particular, to secure alternative sources of lending funds. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{literature}} on the theoretical and empirical aspects {{of the relationship between}} finance and economic growth is both substantial and extensive. The same cannot be said on the relationship between financial development and poverty reduction [...] an equally important aspect. In this study, we visit the theoretical arguments and conduct an empirical analysis {{of the relationship between the}} capital account dimension <b>of</b> financial <b>liberalisation</b> and poverty for developing countries for the period 1985 [...] 2005. In particular, we employ the 'system GMM' technique to test whether capital account liberalisation has helped alleviate poverty, and also whether the extent to which capital account liberalisation affects poverty depends on the quality of institutions. We also use OLS and IV techniques to verify our findings. Our findings indicate that there is no statistically significant relationship between the <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> capital account <b>liberalisation</b> during the period and the poverty rate. Developing countries with higher institutional quality have lower poverty rates, but the effect has low statistical significance. A higher <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> capital account <b>liberalisation</b> is associated with a lower income share for the poor. Copyright The Author 2009.

It draws on Peter Holmes’ and Alasdair Young’s argument that the EU has pioneered trade liberalisation in a number of sectors, an experience which is a potential model for multicultural trade liberalisation. The paper describes the evolution of the European method <b>of</b> insurance <b>liberalisation</b> by looking first at the pre-single market stage with its focus on market access and non-discrimination within national markets. Second, the method by which insurance liberalisation was achieved as part of the single market programme is analysed: mutual recognition of standards and minimum harmonisation of rules. Progress in market liberalisation relied heavily on the development of an Article 36 equivalent for financial services. The result is a European regime with a high <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> internal variation in regulatory goals, objectives and “philosophies. ” The final section looks at how far this approach lends itself to emulation at the international level.

40|$|The main aim of {{this study}} is to compare how {{specific}} conditions in certain countries (in this case, the UK and Sweden) can stimulate or oblige householders to be more energy efficient, or can obstruct this. European goals for energy and emission reductions now constitute the main frame for long-term energy policy changes, but national governments develop and implement policy in contrasting ways and in different contexts. Important aspects are: geographical contex, <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>liberalisation</b> of electricity and gas industry, structure and composition of energy systems, metering and billing infrastructure, and the nature of electrical load problems. The following conditions are described and compared in this paper: (1) regulation to control residential consumption and emissions; (2) energy systems; (3) electricity pricing; (4) the role of utilities and other agents in residential demand reduction; (5) quality of feedback on energy use to the householder; and (6) customer behaviour and perceptions of energy use. The analysis is carried out with a view to ecological, economic and social aspects of energy systems. The comparison shows the significance of factors that are sometimes overlooked when considering the potential for demand reduction and load management, and produces some lessons and questions that are widely applicable.

It claims that for advancing the liberalisation of trade in services, it is necessary for State Parties to look beyond the negotiation of reciprocal concessions for the removal of existing restrictions, and engage on a long-term strategy aimed at bringing about the gradual convergence of domestic legislation affecting trade in services through regulatory co-operation. It also refers to the need for streamlining the operation of the current institutional system by adopting measures aimed at encouraging existing institutions to exercise their power in a more rule-oriented, transparent, accountable and efficient way, without compromising domestic sovereignty to a level unacceptable for State Parties. However, the thesis suggests that the absence of a matrix of converging national interests on MERCOSUR, and the existence of parallel forums for similar purposes at bilateral, regional and multilateral level, compromises its chances for success and wonders whether the effective integration of service markets could ever be achieved...|$|E

There is not much consensus in earlier studies on the effects of electricity deregulation in the U. S., particularly for residential customers. Part of the reason for not finding a consistent link with deregulation and lower prices was that the removal of transitional price caps led to higher prices. In addition, the timing of the removal of price caps coincided with rising fuel prices, which were passed on to consumers in a competitive market. Using a dynamic panel model, we analyze the effect of participation rates, fuel costs, market size, a rate cap and switch to competition for 16 states and the District of Columbia.

Prior to taking account of general equilibrium effects, the estimates imply that a one point increase in the ALI is associated with an increase of 4 % in bilateral parts and components trade, which is the sector found to be most sensitive to the <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> aviation <b>liberalisation.</b> These findings have important policy implications. In particular, economies actively seeking greater integration in international production networks could greatly benefit from a more liberal aviation policy regime.

40|$|In {{this paper}} a {{structural}} empirical {{model of the}} UK monetary transmission mechanism is estimated, {{which can be used}} for policy analysis and forecasting. A small system is estimated containing eight variables that theoretically have {{an important role in the}} transmission mechanism. The paper then attempts to decompose the movements of each of these variables into a small number of independent underlying forcing processes or 'shocks', with a well-defined economic interpretation. In addition to identifying shocks to productivity, domestic demand, external demand and the foreign exchange risk premium, the paper distinguishes between several types of monetary shock. In particular, a distinction is made between 'permanent' monetary policy shocks, attributable to changes in the underlying nominal target of the authorities, and 'temporary' policy shocks, reflecting either policy 'errors' or transitory deviations from the authorities' reaction function. A financial intermediation shock is also identified reflecting changes in the provision of credit by the banking system and the <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> financial <b>liberalisation.</b> The paper goes on to demonstrate some of the practical uses of the model, which include estimating output and liquidity gaps, historical decompositions of the data and conditional forecasting. ...|$|R
40|$|The main {{characteristics}} of water management in Switzerland are its big diversity, strong decentralisation, and different modes of management between drinking {{water supply and}} sanitation. Both, the distribution of water and sanitation, fall within the competences of the cantons, which normally delegate this mandate down to the municipalities. The water sector in Switzerland is organised as a local monopoly, with the most common organisational structure being the municipal water service for drinking water supply, and the (non-autonomous) municipal management for sanitation services. Although significant changes are not expected in the sector in the near future, there are important features and dynamics that may help understanding how the sector will most likely evolve. Firstly, and especially in what concerns water supply operators, {{there has been a}} trend towards the autonomisation and professionalisation of the public entities. Secondly, there is a growing trend towards regionalisation of operators both for economic, technical, and security reasons. Thirdly, there is a general consensus that the <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> water <b>liberalisation</b> is unlikely to increase in the near future. And, finally, public opinion is considered by the specialists as the most important driving force of the Swiss water sector...|$|R
