5|$|The series follows Meredith Grey (Ellen Pompeo), the {{daughter}} of an esteemed general surgeon named Ellis Grey, following her acceptance into the residency program at the fictional Seattle Grace Hospital. During her time as a resident, Grey works alongside fellow doctors Cristina Yang (Sandra Oh), Izzie Stevens (Katherine Heigl), Alex Karev (Justin Chambers), and George O'Malley (T. R. Knight), who each struggle to balance their personal lives with the hectic work and training schedules. They are overseen during their internship by Miranda Bailey (Chandra Wilson), a senior resident who works for attending Derek Shepherd (Patrick Dempsey), the <b>head</b> <b>of</b> neurosurgery and Meredith's love interest; Preston Burke (Isaiah Washington), the <b>head</b> <b>of</b> cardio who becomes Yang's fiancee; and Richard Webber (James Pickens, Jr.), the Chief of Surgery and attending general surgeon, and lover of Ellis Grey decades ago.

5|$|A {{collective}} {{leadership was}} founded immediately after Khrushchev's ouster, consisting of Brezhnev as First Secretary, Kosygin as <b>head</b> <b>of</b> government, and Anastas Mikoyan (and later Nikolai Podgorny) as <b>head</b> <b>of</b> state. From the beginning, Suslov was a vocal critic of one-man rule {{such as that}} seen under Joseph Stalin and Khrushchev. While he condemned Stalin's one-man rule, he equally criticised the individualistic assertiveness of Khrushchev's de-Stalinisation policy. A strong supporter of democratic centralism, Suslov prevented Brezhnev from taking over Kosygin's post as <b>head</b> <b>of</b> government in 1970. Kirilenko, Brezhnev, and Suslov were members of an unofficial Troika within the Communist Party leadership.|$|E
