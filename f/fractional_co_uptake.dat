The fractional {{carbon monoxide}} uptake in 913 New York City transit workers was studied. A prediction equation for white males, based on nonsmokers, was obtained: <b>fractional</b> <b>CO</b> <b>uptake</b> = 0 · 58032 − 0 · 00204 × age + 0 · 0004 × weight (kilograms). Weight was {{the index of}} body size most strongly correlated with the <b>fractional</b> <b>CO</b> <b>uptake.</b> Decline in function with age by amount of tobacco smoked is described. A correction factor for respiration, based on results from 581 workers with two or more tests, was calculated: − 0 · 123654 × (standard tidal volume − observed tidal volume). Tidal volume {{was the most important}} contributor to individual variability of the <b>fractional</b> <b>CO</b> <b>uptake,</b> and minute volume or respiration rate do not add significantly to it. For epidemiological or screening uses, prediction equations are given for the <b>fractional</b> <b>CO</b> <b>uptake</b> corrected to 0 · 5 1. tidal volume. Respiration variables explain only 1 · 5 % of individual variability, and individual variability over a mean period of 16 · 6 months was much larger (an individual standard error of 0 · 07) than the unexplained population variability (a population standard error of 0 · 01 − 0 · 02); thus the usefulness of the <b>fractional</b> <b>CO</b> <b>uptake</b> as a test of respiratory function is in doubt...|$|E

The {{aim of this study}} was to compare the clinical effectiveness and side effects of <b>fractional</b> carbon dioxide (<b>CO</b> 2) laser resurfacing combined with punch elevation with <b>fractional</b> <b>CO</b> 2 laser resurfacing alone in the treatment of atrophic acne scars. Materials and Methods: Forty-two Iranian subjects (age range 18 - 55) with Fitzpatrick skin types III to IV and moderate to severe atrophic acne scars on both cheeks received randomized split-face treatments: One side received <b>fractional</b> <b>CO</b> 2 laser treatment and the other received one session of punch elevation combined with two sessions of laser <b>fractional</b> <b>CO</b> 2 laser treatment, separated by an interval of 1 month. Two dermatologists independently evaluated improvement in acne scars 4 and 16 weeks after the last treatment. Side effects were also recorded after each treatment. Results: The mean ± SD age of patients was 23. 4 ± 2. 6 years. Clinical improvement of facial acne scarring was assessed by two dermatologists blinded to treatment conditions. No significant difference in evaluation was observed 1 month after treatment (P = 0. 56). Their evaluation found that <b>fractional</b> <b>CO</b> 2 laser treatment combined with punch elevation had greater efficacy than that with <b>fractional</b> <b>CO</b> 2 laser treatment alone, assessed 4 months after treatment (P = 0. 02).

Materials and Methods: Eighty-eight SA lesions in three female patients were included. Lesions on each half of the body were randomly enrolled in each group. Group 1 (n = 44) were treated by <b>Fractional</b> <b>CO</b> 2 laser resurfacing and group 2 (n = 44) by a combination of PDL and <b>Fractional</b> <b>CO</b> 2 laser, alternately. Digital Photographs were taken and the surface area of each lesion was measured digitally (using the PictZar Digital Planimetry Software) at the baseline and four weeks after treatment. The clinical improvement was assessed by comparison of the pre- and post-treatment photos and the participants′ views about their degree of improvement, using a 10 -point verbal analog scale (VAS). Results: The mean surface area decreased significantly in both groups after treatment. The mean difference between the pre- and post-treatment surface area was 0. 62 ± 053 for group 2 and 0. 41 ± 0. 43 for group 1 (P-value = 0. 03).

40|$|Six pathophysiologic {{mechanisms}} of a reduced single breath CO diffusing capacity are discussed and {{the usefulness of}} relating carbon monoxide (<b>CO)</b> <b>uptake</b> to the functioning alveolar volume (DL/VA, specific diffusing capacity) is illustrated for several pulmonary diseases. In patients with emphysema and pulmonary emboli (pulmonary vascular occlusive disease), reduced <b>CO</b> <b>uptake</b> is associated with significantly reduced DL/VA and is compatible with reduction of pulmonary capillary bed. In patients with pulmonary alveolar proteinosis, improvement in <b>CO</b> <b>uptake</b> and DL/VA follows lung lavage and suggests that lung units partially filled with proteinaceous material are responsible for hypoxemia, reduced <b>CO</b> <b>uptake</b> and reduced DL/VA. In most cases of radiation fibrosis, sarcoidosis and miscellaneous interstitial fibrosis, reduced <b>CO</b> <b>uptake</b> {{is associated with a}} normal DL/VA and suggests that loss of alveolar units, both capillaries and alveoli, has occurred. New regression equations for DL and DL/VA are established for children and adults. DL/VA is linearly related to height and independent of age and sex, while different predictive equations must be used for DL for the 5 through 17 and 18 through 76 age groups.

At 2, 500 microliters CO 2 per liter (gas phase, equivalent to 1. 79 milligrams per liter aqueous phase), Isoetes leaves showed continuous uptake in both the light and dark. At this CO 2 level, photosynthetic rates were light saturated at about 10 % full sunlight and were about 3 -fold greater than dark <b>CO</b> 2 <b>uptake</b> rates. In the dark, <b>CO</b> 2 <b>uptake</b> rates were also a function of length {{of time in the}} night period. Measurements of dark <b>CO</b> 2 <b>uptake</b> showed that, at both 2, 500 and 500 microliters CO 2 per liter, rates declined during the night period. At the higher CO 2 level, dark <b>CO</b> 2 <b>uptake</b> rates at 0600 h were 75 % less than at 1800 h. At 500 microliters CO 2 per liter, net <b>CO</b> 2 <b>uptake</b> in the dark at 1800 h was replaced by net CO 2 evolution in the dark at 0600 h.

The main objective of this study was to assess the impact of land-use and soil properties on coxL gene diversity and identify molecular indicators for the soil <b>uptake</b> of atmospheric <b>CO.</b> Soil samples were collected in three neighboring sites encompassing different land-use types, namely deciduous forest, larch plantation and maize field. <b>CO</b> <b>uptake</b> activity was related to total carbon and nitrogen content in soil, with the highest activity observed in deciduous forest. An extensive coxL database was assembled to optimize a PCR detection assay targeting sequences belonging to functional type I-CODH and hypothetical type II-CODH. Fully replicated coxL gene libraries unveiled a unique molecular signature in deciduous forest soil, with enrichment of type I sequences. Genetic profiles of larch and maize monocultures were not statistically different and showed higher level of coxL gene richness than deciduous forest. Soil water content and <b>CO</b> <b>uptake</b> activity explained 38 % of the variation of coxL gene profiles in a canonical ordination analysis, leading to the identification of sequences belonging to the δ-Proteobacteria cluster as indicator for high affinity <b>CO</b> <b>uptake</b> activity. Enrichment of type I and δ-Proteobacteria coxL sequences in deciduous forest were confirmed by qPCR in an independent soil survey. <b>CO</b> <b>uptake</b> activity in model carboxydovore bacteria suggested that a significant fraction of detected putative high affinity CO oxidizers were active in soil. Land-use was a driving force separating coxL diversity in deciduous forest from monocultures...|$|R
40|$|The {{increase}} in atmospheric CO 2 over this century {{depends on the}} evolution of the oceanic air sea <b>CO</b> 2 <b>uptake,</b> which will be driven by the combined response to rising atmospheric CO 2 itself and climate change. Here, the future oceanic <b>CO</b> 2 <b>uptake</b> is simulated using an ensemble of coupled climate carbon cycle models. The models are driven by CO 2 emissions from historical data and the Special Report on Emissions Scenarios (SRES) A 2 high-emission scenario. A linear feedback analysis successfully separates the regional future (2010 - 2100) oceanic <b>CO</b> 2 <b>uptake</b> into a <b>CO</b> 2 -induced component, due to rising atmospheric CO 2 concentrations, and a climate-induced component, due to global warming. The models capture the observation-based magnitude and distribution of anthropogenic <b>CO</b> 2 <b>uptake.</b> The distributions of the climate-induced component are broadly consistent between the models, with reduced <b>CO</b> 2 <b>uptake</b> in the subpolar Southern Ocean and the equatorial regions, owing to decreased CO 2 solu bility; and reduced <b>CO</b> 2 <b>uptake</b> in the midlatitudes, owing to decreased CO 2 solubility and increased vertical stratification. The magnitude of the climate-induced component is sensitive to local warming in the southern extratropics, to large freshwater fluxes in the extratropical North Atlantic Ocean, and to small changes in the CO 2 solubility in the equatorial regions. In key anthropogenic <b>CO</b> 2 <b>uptake</b> regions, the climate-induced component offsets the CO 2 -induced component at a constant proportion up until the end of this century. This amounts to approximately 50 % in the northern extratropics and 25 % in the southern extratropics and equatorial regions. Consequently, the detection of climate change impacts on anthropogenic <b>CO</b> 2 <b>uptake</b> may be difficult without monitoring additional tracers, such as oxygen...|$|R

40|$|Objective Microablative <b>fractional</b> <b>CO</b> 2 laser {{has been}} proven to {{determine}} tissue remodeling with neoformation of collagen and elastic fibers on atrophic skin. The aim of our study is to evaluate the effects of microablative <b>fractional</b> <b>CO</b> 2 laser on postmenopausal women with vulvovaginal atrophy using an ex vivo model. Methods This is a prospective ex vivo cohort trial. Consecutive postmenopausal women with vulvovaginal atrophy managed with pelvic organ prolapse surgical operation were enrolled. After fascial plication, the redundant vaginal edge on one side was treated with CO 2 laser (SmartXide 2; DEKA Laser, Florence, Italy). Five different CO 2 laser setup protocols were tested. The contralateral part of the vaginal wall was always used as control. Excessive vagina was trimmed and sent for histological evaluation to compare treated and nontreated tissues. Microscopic and ultrastructural aspects of the collagenic and elastic components of the matrix were studied, and a specific image analysis with computerized morphometry was performed. We also considered the fine cytological aspects of connective tissue proper cells, particularly fibroblasts. Results During the study period, five women were enrolled, and 10 vaginal specimens were finally retrieved. Four different settings of CO 2 laser were compared. Protocols were tested twice each to confirm histological findings. Treatment protocols were compared according to histological findings, particularly in maximal depth and connective changes achieved. All procedures were uneventful for participants. Conclusions This study shows that microablative <b>fractional</b> <b>CO</b> 2 laser can produce a remodeling of vaginal connective tissue without causing damage to surrounding tissue...|$|R
40|$|Background: Acne is a {{very common}} skin disease in which scars are seen in 95 % of the patients. Although {{numerous}} treatments have been recommended, researchers are still searching for a single modality to treat the complication due to its variety in shape and depth. We compared the effects of <b>fractional</b> carbon dioxide (<b>CO</b> 2) laser alone and in combination with subcision {{in the treatment of}} atrophic acne scars. Materials and Methods: This clinical trial study was performed in Skin Diseases and Leishmaniasis Research Center (Isfahan, Iran) during 2011 – 2012. Eligible patients with atrophic acne scars were treated with <b>fractional</b> <b>CO</b> 2 laser alone (five sessions with 3 -week interval) {{on the right side of}} the face and <b>fractional</b> <b>CO</b> 2 laser plus subcision (one session using both with four sessions of <b>fractional</b> <b>CO</b> 2 laser, with 3 -week interval) on the left side. The subjects were visited 1, 2, and 6 months after the treatment. Patient satisfaction rate was analyzed using SPSS 20 software. Results: The average of recovery rate was 54. 7 % using the combination method and 43. 0 % using laser alone (P < 0. 001). The mean patient satisfaction was significantly higher with the combination method than laser alone (6. 6 ± 1. 2 vs. 5. 2 ± 1. 8; P < 0. 001). Bruising was only seen with the combination method and lasted for 1 week in 57. 0 % and for 2 weeks in 43. 0 %. Erythema was seen in both methods. Postinflammatory pigmentation and hyperpigmentation were associated with combination method. No persistent side effects were seen after 6 months. Conclusion: Using a combination of subcision and laser had suitable results regarding scar recovery and satisfaction rate...|$|R
40|$|Objective. Keratosis pilaris (KP) is {{a common}} {{condition}} which can frequently be cosmetically disturbing. Topical treatments {{can be used with}} limited efficacy. The objective {{of this study is to}} evaluate the effectiveness and safety of <b>fractional</b> carbon dioxide (<b>CO</b> 2) laser for the treatment of KP. Patients and Methods. A prospective, randomized, single-blinded, intraindividual comparative study was conducted on adult patients with KP. A single session of <b>fractional</b> <b>CO</b> 2 laser was performed to one side of arm whereas the contralateral side served as control. Patients were scheduled for follow-up at 4 and 12 weeks after treatment. Clinical improvement was graded subjectively by blinded dermatologists. Patients rated treatment satisfaction at the end of the study. Results. Twenty patients completed the study. All patients stated that the laser treatment improved KP lesions. At 12 -week follow-up, 30 % of lesions on the laser-treated side had moderate to good improvement according to physicians’ global assessment (p= 0. 02). Keratotic papules and hyperpigmentation appeared to respond better than the erythematous component. Four patients with Fitzpatrick skin type V developed transient pigmentary alteration. Conclusions. <b>Fractional</b> <b>CO</b> 2 laser treatment may be offered to patients with KP. Dark-skinned patients should be treated with special caution...|$|R
40|$|Crassulacean acid {{metabolism}} (CAM) {{was observed}} in three species of tropical ferns, the epiphytes Microsorium punctatum and Polypodium crassifolium and the lithophyte Platycerium veitchii. Polypodium crassifolium and P. veitchii exhibited characteristics of weak CAM. Although no net nocturnal <b>CO</b> 2 <b>uptake</b> was observed, the presence of CAM was inferred from nocturnal increases in titratable acidity of 4. 7 and 4. 1 μequiv (g fr wt) – 1 respectively, {{a reduction in the}} rates of net CO 2 evolution {{during the first half of}} the dark period, and the presence of a CAM-like decrease in net <b>CO</b> 2 <b>uptake</b> during the early light period. In M. punctatum net <b>CO</b> 2 <b>uptake</b> during the first half of the dark period was accompanied by an increase in titratable acidity of 39. 2 μequiv (g fr wt) – 1 and a pronounced reduction in net <b>CO</b> 2 <b>uptake</b> during the early light period. When water was withheld from P. crassifolium and M. punctatum, net <b>CO</b> 2 <b>uptake</b> during the light was reduced markedly but there was no change in the extent or patterns of CO 2 exhange in the dark. As a consequence, the proportion of carbon gained due to CO 2 fixation in the dark increased from 2. 8 and 10 % to 63. 5 and 49. 3 %, respectively (100 % being net <b>CO</b> 2 <b>uptake</b> during the light plus the estimated <b>CO</b> 2 <b>uptake</b> during the dark). After 9 days without added water, dark <b>CO</b> 2 <b>uptake</b> was responsible for the maintenance of a net 24 h carbon gain in P. crassifolium. Platycerium veitchii, P. crassifolium and M. punctatum exhibited carbon isotope ratios of between – 25. 9 and – 22. 6 ‰ indicating that carbon isotope ratios may not, by themselves, be sufficient for the identification of weak CAM. We suggest that CAM may be more prevalent in tropical epiphytic and lithophytic ferns than currently envisaged...|$|R
40|$|PURPOSE : To {{evaluate}} {{the effect of}} different energies and stacking in skin shrinkage. METHODS : Three decreasing settings of a <b>fractional</b> <b>CO</b> 2 laser were applied to the abdomen of Twenty five Wistar rats divided into three groups. Group I (n= 5) was histologically evaluated for microthermal zones dimensions. Groups II and III (n= 10 each) were macroscopic evaluated with freeware ImageJ for area contraction immediately and after 30 and 60 days. RESULTS : No statistical significance was found within microthermal zone histological dimensions (Group I) in all settings studied. (Ablation depth: 76. 90 to 97. 18 µm; Coagulation depth: 186. 01 to 219. 84 µm). In Group II, macroscopic evaluation showed that all settings cause significant immediate skin contraction. The highest setting cause significant more intense tightening effect initially, contracting skin area from 258. 65 to 179. 09 mm 2. The same pattern was observed in Group III. At 30 and 60 days, the lowest setting significantly sustained contraction. CONCLUSION : Lower <b>fractional</b> <b>CO</b> 2 laser energies associated to pulse stacking could cause consistent and long lasting tissue contraction in rats...|$|R
40|$|The nail {{provides}} a functional protection to the fingertips and surrounding tissue from external injuries. The nail plate {{consists of three}} layers including dorsal, intermediate, and ventral layers. The dorsal layer consists of compact, hard keratins, limiting topical drug delivery through the nail. In this study, we investigate the application of <b>fractional</b> <b>CO</b> 2 laser that produces arrays of microthermal ablation zones (MAZs) to facilitate drug delivery in the nails. We utilized optical coherence tomography (OCT) for real-time monitoring of the laser–skin tissue interaction, sparing the patient from an invasive surgical sampling procedure. The time-dependent OCT intensity variance was used to observe drug diffusion through an induced MAZ array. Subsequently, nails were treated with cream and liquid topical drugs to investigate the feasibility and diffusion efficacy of laser-assisted drug delivery. Our results show that <b>fractional</b> <b>CO</b> 2 laser improves the effectiveness of topical drug delivery in the nail plate and that OCT could potentially be used for in vivo monitoring of the depth of laser penetration as well as real-time observations of drug delivery...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: This {{pilot study}} aimed {{to assess the}} {{efficacy}} and feasibility of <b>fractional</b> <b>CO</b> 2 laser {{in the treatment of}} vulvovaginal atrophy (VVA) in postmenopausal women. METHODS: VVA symptoms were assessed before and after three applications of laser over 12 weeks in 50 women (age 59. 6 ± 5. 8 years) dissatisfied with previous local estrogen therapies. Subjective (visual analog scale) and objective (Vaginal Health Index Score, VHIS) measures were used during the study period to assess VVA. Quality of life was measured by using the SF- 12. A subjective scale to evaluate the degree of pain related to the laser application and the degree of difficulty to perform the laser procedure was used. RESULTS: <b>Fractional</b> <b>CO</b> 2 laser treatment was effective to improve VVA symptoms (vaginal dryness, vaginal burning, vaginal itching, dyspareunia, dysuria; p < 0. 001) at 12 -week follow-up, as well as the VHIS (13. 1 ± 2. 5 at baseline vs. 23. 1 ± 1. 9; p < 0. 001). Both physical and mental scores of quality of life were significantly improved in comparison with baseline (p < 0. 001). Satisfaction with the laser procedure was reported by 42 women (84 %) and a minimal discomfort was experienced at the first laser application, mainly because of the insertion and the movements of the probe. Finally, the technique was very easy to perform in all women starting from the second application at week 4 and no adverse events were recorded during the study period. CONCLUSIONS: A 12 -week treatment with the <b>fractional</b> <b>CO</b> 2 laser was feasible and induced a significant improvement of VVA symptoms by ameliorating vaginal health in postmenopausal women. Further controlled studies should be performed to confirm the present data and to assess the long-term effects of the laser procedure on vaginal tissues...|$|R
