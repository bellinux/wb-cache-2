5|$|Based on the {{uncertain}} direction and slow {{speed of the}} drift, Nansen calculated that <b>it</b> <b>might</b> <b>take</b> the ship five years to reach the pole. In January 1894 he had first discussed with both Henriksen and Johansen the possibility of making a sledge journey with the dogs, from Fram to the pole, though they made no immediate plans. Nansen's first attempts to master dog-driving were an embarrassing failure, but he persevered and gradually achieved better results. He also discovered that the normal cross-country skiing speed {{was the same as}} that of dogs pulling loaded sledges. Men could travel under their own power, skiing, rather than riding on the sledge, and loads could be correspondingly increased. This, according to biographer and historian Roland Huntford, amounted to a revolution in polar travel methods.|$|E
5|$|Ba {{asserted}} {{that he would}} not take orders from Americans. He also argued that sending the 13 M113 armored personnel carriers through the Cong Ba Ky Canal would enable the Viet Cong to retreat because <b>it</b> <b>might</b> <b>take</b> too much time. An argument broke out between Vann and Ba. Finally, Vann radioed Ziegler at the command post at Tan Hiep and told him to ask the commander of the ARVN 7th Infantry Division to order Ba to move toward Ap Bac immediately. Shortly afterwards, Ziegler returned with Dam's permission, and Ba was ordered to move his M113 carriers {{in the direction of the}} white smoke that was rising from the burning hamlet. The American advisers were quietly confident that Ba's M113s could turn the tide of battle; on previous occasions, Viet Cong fighters often fled from the battlefield as soon as M113 armored personnel carriers turned up. However, in contrast to previous engagements, Viet Cong commander Hoang had ordered the soldiers of the 261st and 514th Battalions to throw everything they had at the South Vietnamese, as retreat through the muddy rice fields would result in certain death.|$|E

25|$|There {{are many}} {{organizations}} providing free care to homeless people in countries {{which do not}} offer free medical treatment organized by the state, but the services are in great demand given {{the limited number of}} medical practitioners. For example, <b>it</b> <b>might</b> <b>take</b> months to get a minimal dental appointment in a free-care clinic. Communicable diseases are of great concern, especially tuberculosis, which spreads more easily in crowded homeless shelters in high-density urban settings. There has been an ongoing concern and studies about the health and wellness of the older homeless population, typically ages fifty to sixty-four years of age, and even older, as to whether they are significantly more sickly than their younger counterparts and if they are under-served.|$|E

25|$|The {{attempted}} {{assassination of}} Coligny triggered {{the crisis that}} led to the massacre. Admiral de Coligny was the most respected Huguenot leader and enjoyed a close relationship with the king, although he was distrusted by the king's mother. Aware of the danger of reprisals from the Protestants, the king and his court visited Coligny on his sickbed and promised him that the culprits would be punished. While the Queen Mother was eating dinner, Protestants burst in to demand justice, some talking in menacing terms. Fears of Huguenot reprisals grew. Coligny's brother-in-law led a 4,000-strong army camped just outside Paris and, although there is no evidence it was planning to attack, Catholics in the city feared <b>it</b> <b>might</b> <b>take</b> revenge on the Guises or the city populace itself.|$|E
25|$|Dialogue journal {{writing has}} become an {{important}} component of professional development for teachers in both pre-service teacher training programs at universities and in in-service workshops and coaching. <b>It</b> <b>might</b> <b>take</b> place between the professor and a class of prospective teachers in a teacher preparation program; between prospective or new teachers and experienced teachers they are working with, as a mentoring and coaching opportunity; or between prospective and practicing teachers. Those who use and study these approaches have found that these professional conversations promote reflection on oneself as a teacher and between teachers as they reflect on their practice. Some research focuses on the types of responses and interactions that are effective for promoting teacher learning. With use of the Internet, these interactions can take place among educators around the world.|$|E

Much of the criticism was in response to the Cowboys selecting Notre Dame offensive guard Zack Martin over the perceived Cowboys savior (Texas A QB Johnny Manziel) {{in the first round of}} the NFL draft. Even Cowboys owner Jerry Jones was uncharacteristically down playing expectations for the upcoming season during spring training, emphasizing to the media and fans, that <b>it</b> <b>might</b> <b>take</b> a little more time for the Cowboys young players to mature into a NFL championship caliber team.|$|E

25|$|On 27 May, Joseph sent Clausel {{an order}} asking {{for him to}} return the {{divisions}} of Barbot, Foy and Taupin, if he was finished using them. At this time <b>it</b> <b>might</b> <b>take</b> eight to ten days to get a courier through to Clausel's 15,000-man column. On 15 June, Clausel marched from Pamplona, heading for Logroño, hoping to join Joseph. From Logroño he turned northwest and reached Treviño on 22 June, completely unaware of the Battle of Vitoria the day before. At last, Clausel heard about the French defeat and his column marched south to Viana on 23 June. The next day he tried to go north to Salvatierra but turned around when he received reports {{of the magnitude of}} the Vitoria disaster. On 25 June Clausel picked up the garrison of Logroño and marched northeast toward Pamplona. But reports that the British were trying to intercept his column caused him to swerve south and cross the Ebro River at Lodosa on 26 June.|$|E
25|$|Next after fine colors, I like plain white. One of my sorrows, {{when the}} summer ends, is that I must put off my cheery and {{comfortable}} white clothes and enter {{for the winter}} into the depressing captivity of the shapeless and degrading black ones. It is mid-October now, and the weather is growing cold {{up here in the}} New Hampshire hills, but it will not succeed in freezing me out of these white garments, for here the neighbors are few, and it is only of crowds that I am afraid. I made a brave experiment, the other night, to see how it would feel to shock a crowd with these unseasonable clothes, and also to see how long <b>it</b> <b>might</b> <b>take</b> the crowd to reconcile itself to them and stop looking astonished and outraged. On a stormy evening I made a talk before a full house, in the village, clothed like a ghost, and looking as conspicuous, all solitary and alone on that platform, as any ghost could have looked; and I found, to my gratification, that it took the house less than ten minutes to forget about the ghost and give its attention to the tidings I had brought.I am nearly seventy-one, and I recognize that my age has given me a good many privileges; valuable privileges; privileges which are not granted to younger persons. Little by little I hope to get together courage enough to wear white clothes all through the winter, in New York. It will be a great satisfaction to me to show off in this way; and perhaps the largest of all the satisfactions will be the knowledge that every scoffer, of my sex, will secretly envy me and wish he dared to follow my lead.|$|E
500|$|A more {{moderate}} conception has been expounded by Thomas Nagel, {{which holds that}} the mind body problem is currently unsolvable at the present stage of scientific development and that <b>it</b> <b>might</b> <b>take</b> a future scientific paradigm shift or revolution to bridge the explanatory gap. Nagel posits {{that in the future}} a sort of [...] "objective phenomenology" [...] might be able {{to bridge the gap between}} subjective conscious experience and its physical basis.|$|E

500|$|Following {{the release}} of Sea Change, Beck felt newer {{compositions}} were sketches for something more evolved in the same direction, and wrote nearly 35 more songs in the coming months, keeping demos of them on tapes in a suitcase. During his solo tour, the tapes were left backstage during a stop in Washington, D.C., and Beck {{was never able to}} recover them. It was disheartening to the musician, who felt the two years of songwriting represented something more technically complex. As a result, Beck took a break and wrote no original compositions in 2003. Feeling as though <b>it</b> <b>might</b> <b>take</b> him a while to [...] "get back to that [...] territory", he entered the studio with Dust Brothers to complete a project that dated back to Odelay. Nearly half of the songs had existed since the 1990s.|$|E
500|$|The {{first weeks}} in the ice were frustrating, as the drift moved unpredictably, {{sometimes}} north, sometimes south; by 19 November Fram's latitude was south of that at which she had entered the ice. Only {{after the turn of}} the year, in January 1894, did the northerly direction become generally settled; the 80° mark was finally passed on 22 March. Nansen calculated that, at this rate, <b>it</b> <b>might</b> <b>take</b> the ship five years to reach the pole. As the ship's northerly progress continued at a rate rarely above a mile (1.6km) a day, Nansen began privately to consider a new plan—a dog sledge journey towards the pole. With this in mind he began to practice dog-driving, making many experimental journeys over the ice. [...] In November Nansen announced his plan: when the ship passed latitude 83° he and Hjalmar Johansen would leave the ship with the dogs and make for the pole while Fram, under Sverdrup, continued its drift until it emerged from the ice in the North Atlantic. After reaching the pole, Nansen and Johansen would make for the nearest known land, the recently discovered and sketchily mapped Franz Josef Land. They would then cross to Spitzbergen where they would find a ship to take them home.|$|E

500|$|Bell and Zbyszewski worked {{together}} on Morse and Hunter's storyline for the third season of Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D., preparing them to move over to the spin-off, with Bell explaining that it would set up Most Wanted by defining exactly who the characters are, such as Hunter and his lack of loyalty to S.H.I.E.L.D. and to ideologies—"nothing specific about the show, it’s just who Hunter is." [...] Blood noted that Hunter is [...] "willing to ignore {{the rules and regulations}} to get the right thing done. Sometimes, Bobbi needs that kick up the backside to send her in that direction. By the same token, Hunter needs Bobbi's rationale sometimes to make sure he doesn't get in trouble again." [...] Bell added that for Hunter, [...] "laws are kind of suggestions, and if he’s with them he’ll follow them, and he’s always been much more a loyalist to the guy in the trenches than to any ideology". Palicki remarked that the differences in the character's views and beliefs would be [...] "a big through line throughout the entire show", and that having Morse and Hunter work for Fortune would test both of their morals, with Hunter having [...] "a bit more experience with that, where the line to cross is a bit fluid. <b>It</b> <b>might</b> <b>take</b> Bobbi a bit more to adapt to that." ...|$|E
500|$|Carnivàles central premise was {{considered}} [...] "cloudy", [...] "unconventional", {{and filled with}} [...] "convoluted symbolic interpretations of historical events" [...] after Daniel Knauf had told TV critics that he regarded the 1930s as [...] "the last great age of magic" [...] being ended by an atomic bomb to herald the Age of Reason. Many reviews quoted and commented on Samson's prologue to explain both the apocalyptic premise and the mythology of the show. Some reviews asserted that the good and evil creatures described in the prologue were Ben and Justin, preparing for a final battle. Still, many reviews were reluctant to state who of the main characters was good and who was evil, aware that <b>it</b> <b>might</b> <b>take</b> some time until this question was answered for sure. Ben and his healing powers led most reviewers {{to believe that he}} was the good creature, and that Justin was a demon or at least a dangerous zealot who received instructions from either God or Satan. Some reviews described the question of Ben's parentage as one of the big puzzles and the show's driving mystery, but refrained from defining further details of the series. The lack of revelation of the characters' roles was apparent {{by the end of the}} first season, although critics expected Sofie to gain significance later in the story.|$|E
500|$|Zeta-Jones {{participated in}} school stage shows {{from a young}} age and gained local media {{attention}} when her rendition of a Shirley Bassey song won a Junior Star Trail talent competition. As part of a dance troupe, she routinely took trips to London, where she auditioned for roles in the theatre. At the age of nine, she was selected to play one of the orphan girls in a West End production of the musical Annie, and in her early teens, she became a national tap-dancing champion. In 1981 she played the lead role of Annie in a Swansea production of the musical, which was staged at the Swansea Grand Theatre. Two years later, she played the lead role of Tallulah in a West End production of Bugsy Malone. When she was 15, Zeta-Jones {{dropped out of school}} without obtaining O-levels and decided to live in London to pursue a full-time acting career; she was also engaged to perform in a touring production of The Pajama Game. Describing her teenage years in London, Zeta-Jones said, [...] "I would queue up for auditions and then change my costume or put on a different leotard and audition again. <b>It</b> <b>might</b> <b>take</b> me two tries, but I always got the job. I figured out what they wanted". She went on to attend the independent Arts Educational Schools in Chiswick, London, for a three-year course in musical theatre.|$|E
