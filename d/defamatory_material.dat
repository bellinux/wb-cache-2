A major item on his agenda was the defense of the General Assembly's 1798 Virginia Resolutions, of which Madison had been the draftsman. The Resolutions, usually {{discussed}} together with Thomas Jefferson's contemporaneous Kentucky Resolutions, were a response to various perceived outrages perpetrated by the Federalist-dominated national government. The most significant of these were the Alien and Sedition Acts, four laws that allowed the President to deport aliens at will, required a longer period of residence before aliens could become citizens, and made it a crime to publish malicious or <b>defamatory</b> <b>material</b> against the government or its officials. Democratic-Republicans were outraged by the legislation, and Madison and Jefferson drafted the highly critical Resolutions adopted in response by the Virginia and Kentucky state legislatures.|$|E

Attributed with borderless nature and geographical independence, these online platforms have enabled Internet users to easily disseminate any kinds of information and news {{to the public at}} large. This is in stark contrast with the traditional print and broadcast media whereby their reach and influence are limited by territorial boundaries and localities. Unfortunately, the ability of these online channels to have a global reach has attracted a large number of unscrupulous users to disseminate <b>defamatory</b> <b>materials</b> in the cyber world. And since cases of online defamation are reportedly on the rise in Malaysia, the study attempts to examine the effectiveness of the existing laws in regulating such a threat to the society. In relation thereof, this study will analyze the provisions of the Malaysian Defamation Act 1957 and relevant decided cases on this matter.

Thereafter, cases such as Zeran v. America Online, , and Blumenthal v. Drudge, , have demonstrated that although courts are expressly uneasy with applying § 230, they are bound to find providers like AOL immune from defamatory postings. This immunity applies even if the providers are notified of <b>defamatory</b> <b>material</b> and neglect to remove it, because provider liability upon notice would likely cause a flood of complaints to providers, would be a large burden on providers, and would have a chilling effect on freedom of speech on the Internet.|$|E

The proper {{pronunciation}} of her name (Her-my-oh-nee) is interjected into the plot when she teaches it to Krum; the best he can do is [...] "Herm-own-ninny," [...] but she has no problem with it. She later gets into a heated argument with Ron after he accuses her of [...] "fraternising with the enemy" [...] in reference to her friendship with Krum. In the book, Hermione's feelings toward Ron are hinted at when she says that Ron can't see her [...] "like a girl," [...] but Krum could. She supports Harry through the Triwizard Tournament, helping him prepare for each task. At {{the end of the second}} task, Krum asks her to come see him over the summer in Bulgaria, but she politely refuses.

2500|$|Wikis {{and their}} users {{can be held}} liable for certain {{activities}} that occur on the wiki. If a wiki owner displays indifference and forgoes controls (such as banning copyright infringers) that he could have exercised to stop copyright infringement, he may be deemed to have authorized infringement, especially if the wiki is primarily used to infringe copyrights or obtains direct financial benefit, such as advertising revenue, from infringing activities. In the United States, wikis may benefit from Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, which protects sites that engage in [...] "Good Samaritan" [...] policing of harmful material, with no requirement on the quality or quantity of such self-policing. However, it has also been argued that a wiki's enforcement of certain rules, such as anti-bias, verifiability, reliable sourcing, and no-original-research policies, could pose legal risks. When defamation occurs on a wiki, theoretically all users of the wiki can be held liable, because any of them had the ability to remove or amend the <b>defamatory</b> <b>material</b> from the [...] "publication." [...] It {{remains to be seen whether}} wikis will be regarded as more akin to an internet service provider, which is generally not held liable due to its lack of control over publications' contents, than a publisher.

Shpiels have traditionally featured only stage performances, but recent spiels include multimedia comedy. The Purim Shpiel is an annual source of tension between administrators, who review drafts for <b>defamatory</b> and unsavory <b>material,</b> and students, who often sneak in inappropriate material. The Purim Shpiel was shut down mid-performance by the faculty in 1996 and 2006. In light of certain teachers taking particular offense to the 2009 Shpiel, though it was reviewed by the administration, the administration took further precautionary measures and watched a full run-through of the 2010 shpiel before granting full approval. The 2012 Shpiel ended in a suspension for one of the students. The 2013 Shpiel involved controversy over content that was barred by the administrators and inappropriate distribution of censored material. The 2014 shpiel, though initially canceled by the administration due to worry about inappropriate content may be re instituted due to student complaints.|$|R

40|$|Introduction In {{this paper}} we look into issues that arise when people collaboratively create digital content {{and want to}} {{publicly}} distribute it. We identify and analyze the issues based on four case studies on amateur content production. In our analysis we discuss the issues both from the amateurs’ point of view, and also, from the game brand owners’ perspective. User-created content (UCC) in games has become popular as demonstrated by game-related skins, mods and extensions, screenshots, gameplay videos, game narratives, walk-throughs, websites, articles, fan art, as well as tools for creating the content. Often UCC is a collaborative activity where people share their expertise and skills, {{and the organization of}} groups into larger communities can even more advance the quality and distribution of the created material. Communities of amateur content creators can create an identity and a virtual location around their activity (e. g., a website), which can act as a publicity and distribution channel for the content, as well as a discussion forum, knowledge pool, and a place for socializing. However, as the collaborative work starts to gain popularity and move towards more professional production, legal and organizational issues arise that even amateur content creators should address. These issues include decisions on commercialization of the content creation activity, intellectual property rights within the content creators, the brand image of the content or the group, and managing the liability risks in content production. These issues can be critical for the existence of the content creation community, and are often largely ignored until they manifest themselves with negative consequences. Case Studies Two of the four cases in our study are computer game related: user-created fan websites for Habbo Hotel, and user-created game worlds for Neverwinter Nights. The other two cases are not directly game-related: a micro-movie producer community Blauereiter, and an electronic publication The Melrose Mirror. The last two examples were chosen to illustrate aspects arising from amateur media content production that may become more relevant for game-related UCC in the future. Habbo Hotel is a virtual meeting place on the Internet where the gamers can create their own characters, and a hotel room for their character where other characters can visit. Habbo Hotel is owned and developed by Sulake Inc, and it has 2, 3 million users worldwide. Habbo Hotel has a devoted fan community that publishes their own fan web pages that are graphically and thematically similar to the Habbo Hotel. Currently Sulake is strongly controlling the contents of the fan sites by forcing the closing of unwanted fansites because of game brand and IPR issues. Neverwinter Nights is a commercial multi-player adventure game developed by BioWare Inc. The game includes a set of tools for gamers to create their own characters, adventures, and worlds. These user-created worlds are hosted by the creators themselves. For other people to play these worlds they must have the Neverwinter Nights game installed on their PC. BioWare has announced their plan to sell user-created game modules, hence opening questions about the commercialization of UCC. Blauereiter is community for discussing and distributing micromovies. Micromovies are short movies made especially for handheld devices with small screens. The community was established in Finland in 2002 to promote students’ micromovies and to have a knowledge sharing website. The website also has the community rules, where it is stated that the community manages the rights, marketing, and distribution of its members’ movies and potential profits. According to the rules the community makes decisions and changes relating to the rules. However, the rules or the website do not explicitly state what or who are the community, how can members affect the community decision making, or how potential revenues are distributed within the community. The Melrose Mirror is an electronic newspaper collaboratively published by a group of senior citizens in Massachusetts, USA. The community has been active since 1996, and has over the years collaboratively produced several thousands of articles and images about the history and current life in Melrose, as well as personal opinions and stories of the authors. The editorial staff, which consists of a sub-group of all contributors, selects the articles and pictures for publication. However, the group has not decided to formally organize their own activity. The members have decided that the opinions in the publication strictly reflect the views of the individual creators, and the copyrights to the material belong to the individual contributors. The decisions regarding issues such as advertising on the website, usage of computers, and opinions about the website content are debated in the group meetings. Conclusions From the case studies we identified and analyzed the issues these particular examples had in creating and publishing user-created content. Two of the communities had a direct relation to commercial stakeholders and their brands and technology. In the other two communities the media was created independent of direct third party connections. Based on these cases we argue that the main legal issues and concerns in collaborative creation of content are decision making and liability. The decision making issues can be further identified as the distribution of potential revenues, deciding on a licensing policy for the content, and the re-publication of content. The liability issues can be specified as infringement of intellectual property rights (i. e., copyrights, patents, and trademarks), publication of illegal <b>material</b> (i. e., <b>defamatory</b> or racist <b>material,</b> child pornography), and the distribution of technically damaging content (i. e., computer viruses). The liability issues are relevant irrespective whether the act is intentional or not. These issues are especially significant if the created content has commercial value, but the issues must be addressed also in non-profit creation and distribution. Based on the identification and analysis we discuss the solutions that legal systems provide to these issues. Mainly, we look into traditional forms of organization, such as corporation, association, and trust, and discuss how these different legal forms of organizations could be applied to collaborative content creation. We also discuss what further issues arise in applying these legal forms of organization into a novel way of global collaboration using digital technology...|$|R

50|$|The plaintiffs {{argued that}} Prodigy should be {{considered}} a publisher of the <b>defamatory</b> <b>material</b> and were therefore liable for the postings under the common-law definition of defamation. Prodigy asked to be dismissed from the case {{on the grounds that they}} could not be held liable for the content of postings created by its users, relying on a 1991 case Cubby, Inc. v. CompuServe Inc., which had found CompuServe, an online service provider, not liable as a publisher for user-generated content.|$|E

The court began by reviewing the possible spectrum of applicable standards over which the court must choose as the standard for this and similar cases. In ascending order the possible standards are [...] "good faith basis to assert a claim, ...pleading sufficient facts to survive a motion to dismiss, and ...showing of prima facie evidence sufficient to withstand a motion for summary judgement." ...|$|E
5000|$|In {{addition}} to seeking dismissal of cases based on CDA immunity, Richie has raised other arguments. For example, on March 13, 2014, {{a federal court}} in Arkansas found that Richie was not subject to personal jurisdiction in that state because [...] "posting <b>defamatory</b> <b>material</b> on the internet, standing alone, is insufficient to create personal jurisdiction over a defendant in the plaintiff's home state." [...] On that basis, the court dismissed the case against Richie, who represented himself in the lawsuit without an attorney. Notably, the Kentucky district court reached the opposite conclusion in the Sarah Jones case, finding that Richie was subject to personal jurisdiction in that state.|$|E
5000|$|The Internet {{has become}} a popular medium of {{expression}} and accessing information and data.

In Canada, there are many public and private organisations with the authority to censor, including many self-censoring associations and service providers. Canadian internet censorship is not specifically regulated; however local laws do apply to websites hosted in Canada as well as to residents who host sites on servers in other jurisdictions. Canada has seen many cases regarding websites including <b>defamatory</b> <b>material</b> [...] and material promoting hatred or contempt.|$|E
50|$|Under the Electronic Communications and Transactions Act of 2002 (ECTA), ISPs are {{required}} to respond to and implement take-down notices regarding illegal content such as child pornography, <b>defamatory</b> <b>material,</b> and copyright violations. Members of the Internet Service Providers Association are not liable for third-party content they do not create or select, however, they can lose this protection from liability {{if they do not}} respond to take-down requests. ISPs often {{err on the side of}} caution by taking down content to avoid litigation since there is no incentive for providers to defend the rights of the original content creator, even if they believe the take-down notice was requested in bad faith. There is no existing appeal mechanism for content creators or providers.|$|E
