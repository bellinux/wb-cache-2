40|$|This study explores {{a method}} of {{generating}} electricity while recovering waste heat through the integration of heat pipes and thermoelectric generators (i. e. HPTEG system). The simultaneous waste heat recovery and power generation processes are achieved {{without the use of}} any moving parts. The HPTEG system consists of bismuth telluride thermoelectric generators (TEG), which are sandwiched between two finned pipes to achieve a temperature gradient across the TEG for electricity generation. A counter-flow heat exchanger was built using two separate air ducts. The air ducts were thermally coupled using the HPTEG modules. The evaporator section of the heat pipe absorbed the waste heat in a <b>hot</b> <b>air</b> <b>duct.</b> The heat was then transferred across the TEG surfaces. The condenser section of the HPTEG collected the excess heat from the TEG cold side before releasing it to the cold air duct. A 2 -kW electrical heater was installed in the <b>hot</b> <b>air</b> <b>duct</b> to simulate the exhaust gas. An air blower was installed at the inlet of each duct to direct the flow of air into the ducts. A theoretical model was developed for predicting the performance of the HPTEG system using the effectiveness-number of transfer units method. The developed model was able to predict the thermal and electrical output of the HPTEG, along with the rate of heat transfer. The results showed that by increasing the cold air velocity, the effectiveness of the heat exchanger was able to be increased from approximately 52 % to 58 %. As a consequence of the improved heat transfer, maximum power output of 4. 3 W was obtained...|$|E

5|$|Due to a {{shortage}} of Brownings, which had been selected as the new standard rifle calibre machine gun for the RAF in 1934, early Spitfires were fitted with only four guns, with the other four fitted later. Early tests showed that while the guns worked perfectly {{on the ground and}} at low altitudes, they tended to freeze at high altitude, especially the outer wing guns. This was because the RAF's Brownings had been modified to fire from an open bolt. While this prevented overheating of the cordite used in British ammunition, it allowed cold air to flow through the barrel unhindered. Supermarine did not fix the problem until October 1938, when they added <b>hot</b> <b>air</b> <b>ducts</b> {{from the rear of the}} wing mounted radiators to the guns, and bulkheads around the gunbays to trap the <b>hot</b> <b>air</b> in the wing. Red fabric patches were doped over the gun ports to protect the guns from cold, dirt and moisture until they were fired. Even if the eight Brownings worked perfectly, pilots soon discovered that they were not sufficient to destroy larger aircraft. Combat reports showed that an average of 4,500 rounds were needed to shoot down an enemy aircraft. In November 1938, tests against armoured and unarmoured targets had already indicated that the introduction of a weapon with a calibre of at least 20mm was urgently needed.|$|R

40|$|This {{study has}} {{investigated}} {{the feasibility of}} installing a gas generator-free turbine type power plant in the R 3 Y aircraft, using a circulating fuel reactor as a power source. Two variations of the cycle were considered. The split flow cycle bleeds high temperature, high pressure air from the gas generator directly to the free turbine in the wing. The through flow cycle partially expands the high temperature, high pressure air through the compressor turbine of the gas generator then directs the compressor-turbine exhaust air to the free turbine in the wing. Design parameters of pressure ratio, radiator depth, radiation flow density, and hot gas duct size were optimized to give minimum weight per shaft horsepower of the complete power plant. The weight of a split flow power plant capable of supplying 22, 000 shaft horsepower {{was found to be}} 116, 600 pounds. The weight of a similar through flow power plant was found to be 119, 900 pounds. The reactor power required in both cases was 70 megawatts. The nominal gross weight of the R 3 Y airplane is 175, 000 pounds. With pay loads of approximately 20, 000 pounds, either nuclear conversion will have a gross weight of 200, 000 pounds. It was found that either cycle could be installed in the R 3 Y aircraft; however, the installation of either would require major structural redesign. The split flow cycle with its smaller <b>hot</b> <b>air</b> <b>ducts</b> required the least amount of redesign. A comparison of existing aircraft engines with a preliminary design of the split flow turbo-components indicated that the compressor and possibly the free turbine could be adapted from current engine components...|$|R

5000|$|Early systems used rotary coolers, {{which were}} {{rotating}} cylinders {{similar to the}} kiln, into which the hot clinker dropped. [...] The combustion air was drawn up through the cooler as the clinker moved down, cascading through the air stream. In the 1920s, satellite coolers became common and remained in use until recently. These consist of a set (typically 7-9) of tubes attached to the kiln tube. They have the advantage that they are sealed to the kiln, and require no separate drive. From about 1930, the grate cooler was developed. This consists of a perforated grate through which cold air is blown, enclosed in a rectangular chamber. A bed of clinker up to 0.5 m deep moves along the grate. These coolers have two main advantages: they cool the clinker rapidly, which is desirable from a quality point of view (to avoid that alite, thermodynamically unstable below 1250 °C, revert to belite and free CaO on slow cooling), and, {{because they do not}} rotate, <b>hot</b> <b>air</b> can be <b>ducted</b> out of them for use in fuel drying, or for use as precalciner combustion air.

However, in practice, obstacles {{have been identified in}} the form of rejection from the community due to the outstanding issues that high-voltage <b>air</b> <b>ducts</b> have an impact on health. Aim: This research aims to analysis the magnitude of electromagnetic wave radiation of high-voltage <b>air</b> <b>ducts</b> construction on health. Methods: The study was conducted by measuring electromagnetic wave radiation prior to high-voltage <b>air</b> <b>ducts</b> (150 kV) construction and predicting the amount of radiation generated after this operation and its impact on health. Result: The field measurement result showed that the highest strength of magnetic field in the absence of construction and operation activity of high-voltage <b>air</b> <b>ducts</b> 150 kV was 0. 00085 mT and the highest electric field was 0. 004241251 V/m. The results of the magnetic field strength analysis showed that the highest strength of magnetic field and electric field when the high-voltage <b>air</b> <b>ducts</b> is completed and operated was magnetic field of 0. 00415 mT and electric field of 38. 4 V/m. The value was far lower than the standard limits recommended by IRPA / INIRC, WHO 1990 and SNI 04 - 6950 - 2003. The allowed electric field strength is 5 kV / m and the allowed magnetic field strength is 0. 1 mT.

40|$|The {{concentrations}} of CO 2, CO, formaldehyde (H 2 CO) and water vapour were simultaneously monitored in various sections {{of a mountain}} church situated {{in the village of}} Rocca Pietore in the Italian Alps. The performance of a conventional, hot-air heating system and a novel design for heating the church, consisting of low-temperature heating elements, such as electrically heated pews and carpets, were compared for the supply, transport and removal of gases, the deposition and/or transformation of which may affect the preservation of displayed works of art. Experiments with sulphur hexafluoride (SF 6) tracer-gas showed a considerable influx of external <b>air</b> through the <b>hot</b> <b>air</b> carrier <b>ducts</b> of the old heating system, and also the leakage of the internal air mostly via the apertures of the doors. The ventilation rates for the total volume of the church with the hot-air heating system (on for 1. 5 h), the new heating system (on for 2 h), and without heating were calculated to be 0. 25, 0. 18, and 0. 13 h- 1, respectively. Without heating, a nearly homogeneous distribution of gases has been observed along both the horizontal and the vertical cross-sections of the church. Immediately after switching on the hot-air heating system, the levels of CO 2 and water vapour showed a sharp increase. After turning this system off, the levels of gases showed a slow fall and they developed a highly non-homogeneous spatial distribution indoors for many hours. In the upper region of the church, being airtight, higher {{concentrations of}} the pollutants could be detected. The low levels of CO and H 2 CO, mostly originating from incense burning during services, were correlated to that of CO 2. The hot-air heating system has been proved to present a potential deterioration risk to artworks, as it increases the supply, transport and deposition probability of air pollutants. On the other hand, the novel, symmetrical heating system eliminates these undesirable effects, thus its application is advantageous to all churches involved in the preservation of works of art...|$|R
40|$|The {{underground}} <b>air</b> <b>ducts</b> along peripheral {{walls of}} a building are a remediation method, which principle is to enable an air flow along the moist building structure’s surface to allow a sufficient evaporation of moisture from the structure.
