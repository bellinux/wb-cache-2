5|$|Meanwhile, Homer, {{with the}} help of Ned Flanders, sets out to rescue the {{children}} (driving Ned's car and sawing off part of his roof to use as a snow plough) but crashes Flanders' car into a fire <b>hydrant,</b> which sprays water that freezes the car in place. Homer's repeated gunning of the accelerator causes carbon monoxide to flood the front of the car. Flanders and Homer get high from the fumes and wildly hallucinate. While the trapped children go wild with power, Skinner uses the school hamster, named Nibbles, to get a message to the outside world. Nibbles makes it to Ned and Homer, breaking the window and reviving them: they crash into a salt silo, melting the snow around the school and badly rusting the car but freeing the kids in the process.|$|E
5|$|Later on, it is Bigger Brothers Day in Marine World, {{where the}} Bigger Brothers and their boys attend to {{celebrate}} (including Homer, Tom, Bart, and Pepi). After running into Homer, Tom begins to brawl with him, {{in a fight}} which rages across Springfield. In the end, Homer winds up getting poked on the back by a fire <b>hydrant,</b> breaking his spine, much to Tom's shock. As a result, Homer is sent to a hospital on a stretcher, and Bart holds himself responsible for this. Later on, Tom sadly talks {{about how much he}} will miss being a Bigger Brother, while Pepi is sad over losing his Bigger Brother. Fortunately, Bart suggests Tom become Pepi's big brother, to which they happily agree, and both Tom and Pepi walk out into the sunset holding hands. At the same time, Homer (whose back is now fixed) and Bart reconcile, as Homer teaches Bart how to brawl due to his experience with Tom.|$|E
5|$|The opening {{sequence}} of the video features Jay Z as a passenger in a car speeding along Mission Road in Los Angeles, where he encounters Beyoncé, {{standing in the middle}} of the road, at the Fourth Street bridge. Beyoncé performs in various dance sequences, beginning with her wearing a white tank top, denim blue shorts, and red high-heels. She performs an elaborate solo dance on a riser. The scene shifts to a gold set with a mock photo shoot, before moving into a scene with dancers detailing Beyoncé and dancing against a wall while wearing caps and full length pants. Jay Z appears and ignites a line of petrol leading to a car parked under the bridge, which explodes in flames. Jay Z performs his rap in front of the burning car, and Beyoncé dances beside him, wearing an exotic silk print over a fur coat, before kicking the valve off a fire <b>hydrant.</b> She continues to dance while the water is flying everywhere. The video ends with Beyoncé and her dancers wearing vibrant Versace dresses in front of a large fan. Their outfits contrast with the neutral colors of the background, the video. Carmit Bachar, a former Pussycat Dolls singer, is one of the dancers.|$|E
50|$|In {{most areas}} fire <b>hydrants</b> require annual {{inspections}} and maintenance — they normally {{only have a}} one-year warranty, but some have 5- or even 10-year warranties, although the longer warranty does not remove the need for periodic inspections or maintenance. These inspections are generally performed by the local municipalities but they often do not inspect <b>hydrants</b> that are identified as private. Private <b>hydrants</b> are usually located on larger properties to adequately protect large buildings {{in case of a}} fire and in order to comply with the fire code. Such <b>hydrants</b> have met the requirements of insurance underwriters and are often referred to as UL/FM <b>hydrants.</b> Some companies are contracted out to inspect private fire <b>hydrants</b> unless the municipality has undertaken that task.|$|R

50|$|In {{areas of}} the United States without winter snow cover, blue reflectors {{embedded}} in the street are used to allow rapid identification of <b>hydrants</b> at night. In areas with snow cover, tall signs or flags are used so that <b>hydrants</b> can be found even if covered with snow. In rural areas tall narrow posts painted with visible colours such as red {{are attached to the}} <b>hydrants</b> to allow them to be found during heavy snowfall periods.The tops of the fire <b>hydrants</b> indicate the amount of pressure each one will put out. This is good because it makes the choice of what <b>hydrants</b> will be used to supply water to the fire scene.|$|R
5|$|Phoenix {{played a}} notable {{role in the}} {{response}} to the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake. At 5:04 pm on October 17, 1989, a major earthquake rumbled through the San Francisco Bay Area. One of the hardest-hit locations was the Marina District of San Francisco; a densely populated neighborhood built up primarily in the 1920s on rubble, sand and debris dumped {{at the edge of the}} bay following the 1906 earthquake. A number of buildings collapsed, and firefighters were called to rescue trapped residents. Subsequent to a sharp aftershock, a fire broke out in a three-story building at Divisadero and Jefferson, threatening nearby buildings. Fire engines connected their hoses to the city's seawater-based Auxiliary Water Supply System (AWSS) and began to quench the fire, but an explosion caused the structure to collapse onto the fire <b>hydrant.</b> Fire crews were forced back, and with the assistance of off-duty police and civilian volunteers they ran hoses four blocks away to alternate sources. Further explosions caused other structures to collapse onto the newly laid hoses. At about the same time, other fire companies in the Marina were reporting water pressure problems with both the AWSS and the regular municipal water system. The AWSS was suffering from broken underground lines and from a 20% loss in stored water volume—both from earthquake damage—and from broken high pressure hydrants caused by building collapses. At 6:16 pm Phoenix was called to assist.|$|E

50|$|Supporters of the bill, {{including}} Rep. Johnson, {{argued that}} the EPA's rule would cause a nationwide shortage of fire <b>hydrants</b> once the new rule {{went into effect in}} January. This is {{due to a lack of}} existing fire <b>hydrants</b> available for installation that already meet the EPA's rule. Supporters also argued that communities would be stuck with millions of dollars' worth of non-compliant fire <b>hydrants</b> they could not use if the EPA's rule took effect. Adding additional urgency to the situation, winter is when more <b>hydrants</b> are replaced due to damage from freezing or being hit by cars driving on slippery roads.|$|R
50|$|Since fire <b>hydrants</b> {{are one of}} {{the most}} {{accessible}} parts of a water distribution system, they are often used for attaching pressure gauges or loggers or monitor system water pressure. Automatic flushing devices are often attached to <b>hydrants</b> to maintain chlorination levels in areas of low usage. <b>Hydrants</b> are also used as an easy above-ground access point by leak detection devices to locate leaks from the sound they make.|$|R

25|$|At {{the time}} of cityhood, Burbank had a {{volunteer}} fire department. Fire protection depended upon the bucket brigade and finding a <b>hydrant.</b> It wasn't until 1913 that the city created its own fire department. By 1916, the city was installing an additional 40 new fire hydrants but still relying on volunteers for fire fighting. In 1927, the city switched from a volunteer fire department to a professional one.|$|E

Therefore, as a class, <b>hydrants</b> would not qualify for the exclusion for pipes, fittings and fixtures used exclusively for nonpotable services." [...] The October 22, 2013 announcement [...] "came as a total surprise to communities whose inventories of new, uninstalled fire <b>hydrants</b> would be rendered obsolete on January 4."

25|$|At the {{intersection}} of Beach and Divisadero Streets in San Francisco, a natural gas main rupture caused a major structure fire. The fire department selected bystanders to help run fire hoses from a distance because the nearby <b>hydrant</b> system failed. Since the bay was only {{two blocks from the}} burning buildings, water from the bay was pumped by the fireboat Phoenix, to engines on the shore, and from there sprayed on the fire. The apartment structures that collapsed were older buildings that included ground floor garages, which engineers refer to as a soft story building.|$|E
25|$|Fuller {{was not an}} {{engineer}} and {{did not realize that}} the site was a poor choice for a large camp because of its wet, low–lying location. The camp lacked sewers for more than a year, and the prairie on which it was built could not absorb the waste from thousands of humans and horses. The camp flooded with each rainfall. In the winter, it was a sea of mud when the ground was not frozen. When the camp opened, only one water <b>hydrant</b> worked. There was a severe shortage of latrines and medical facilities {{from the time of the}} camp's initial use through the period of incarceration of the first group of Confederate prisoners in mid–1862.|$|E
25|$|On 6March 1878, Henry Woollcombe took {{command of}} Endymion. This {{was due to}} the death of Rear-Admiral William Charles Chamberlain, Superintendent at Devonport.

Moresby was promoted to the Bermuda position and Woollcombe was promoted to replace him as captain of Endymion. On 12 April, a fire developed in shops at the Market Place, Hull. Forty marines from Endymion assisted the Hull Police in fighting the fire. They brought a hand pump but was unable to use it owing to incompatibility of the hose and <b>hydrant,</b> being different sizes. On 22August, a private in the Royal Marines was court-martialled at Portsmouth for desertion from Endymion.

25|$|In 1972, the World Bank {{approved}} {{funds for}} further {{expansion of the}} airport, including a new international and domestic passenger terminal building, the airport's first dedicated cargo and freight terminal, new taxiways,associated aprons, internal roads, car parks, police and fire stations, a State Pavilion, airfield androadway lighting, fire <b>hydrant</b> system, water, electrical, telecommunications and sewage systems, a dual carriageway passenger access road, security, drainage and {{the building of the}} main access road to the airport (Airport South Road). The total cost of the project was over US$29 million (US$111.8 million in 2013 dollars). On 14 March 1978, construction of the current terminal building was completed {{on the other side of}} the airport's single runway and opened by President Kenyatta. The airport was again renamed, this time in honour of President Kenyatta after his death about five months later on 22 August 1978.|$|E

Further aircraft parking stands {{would be built}} {{to the east of}} the terminal, and a taxiway would be constructed alongside and to the south of the runway, to avoid the need for aircraft to back-track on the runway. Both these developments would involve further reduction in the water area of the King George V Dock. The existing fuel farm would be relocated to a site at the east of the airport, where it could be supplied by barge, and linked to a <b>hydrant</b> based supply system, thus eliminating both road tanker deliveries and on-airport fuel bowser movements. The existing surface car park would be replaced by a multi-storey car park, allowing extension of the vehicle drop-off and pick up area. The jet centre and hangar facilities would be further extended. Finally the existing terminal building would be replaced.|$|E
25|$|Upon {{arriving}} at the station, guests boarded a large, open-air aerial tram vehicle. There, a live guide aboard the tram informed {{them that they were}} being evacuated off of Manhattan Island and over to Roosevelt Island during Kong's attack. The tram's radio was tuned to the police emergency frequency so that guests could be informed of Kong's location in the city. The tram traveled above the streets of downtown New York City where guests could view Kong's path of destruction. There was a water geyser from a broken fire <b>hydrant,</b> broken steam pipes, crashed and overturned cars, and a subway train partly derailed from its elevated track. A police chopper described the scene around the tram over the radio, alerting that Kong was approaching the tramway and that he was grabbing a power pole. Kong's silhouette could briefly be seen as a spotlight shone on a building ahead of the tram. As the tram passed the power pole, it tipped over and its electrical transformer exploded, unleashing a shower of sparks and fire, which ignited the derailed elevated subway train.|$|E
