40|$|Nuclear Magnetic Resonance {{was used}} to probe the {{distribution}} of water and ionic species in a microstructured poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) polymer optical fibre (MPOF), {{with a view to}} assessing the suitability of these fibres for aqueous chemosensing. The NMR spectra and the measurements of proton spin relaxation in hydrated fibres demonstrated the presence of two distinct pools of water: water residing in the microstructure channels and the hydration water residing in the polymer matrix of the <b>fibre.</b> <b>No</b> facile chemical exchange between these two pools was present. The NMR peaks of the two pools of water were separated by 1. 53 ppm. Relaxation measurements of the fibre samples doped with aqueous copper sulfate showed that charged ions freely entered the microstructure channels but were completely excluded from the polymer matrix of the fibre. Measurements of the apparent diffusion coefficient of water along the axial direction of the fibre showed that water molecules moved unimpeded along the channels. This is the first reported magnetic-resonance study of microstructured optical fibres. The findings suggest that microstructured PMMA fibres are compatible with ionic aqueous solutions and could provide a robust and durable platform for chemical-sensing applications...|$|E

40|$|International audienceReliability of {{standard}} single mode silica optical fibre and hermetic coated fibre {{has been investigated}} through chemical exposure to hydrofluoric acid (HF) vapours into a hermetic closed disposal for different durations. Dynamic fatigue tests were implemented using a two-point bending testing device. Three series of samples subject to HF attack for variable times were compared. Standard fibres tested immediately after exposure show a broader distribution of fibre strength accompanied by the drastic decrease of the failure stress. Drying treated standard fibres prior to testing has also led to a broader distribution and a slight decrease of failure stress by comparison to as-received fibres. Drying in oven prior to mechanical measurement makes handling difficult and results in brittle fibres that exhibit much lower strength and broader distribution of failure stress. Polymer reacts with hydrogen fluoride, which induces viscosity changes, but it returns to solid state after thermal treatment. This is consistent with SEM observations.

Using ultrasonics (approx. 10 W/cm 2) in a conventional dyeing process leads to a faster dyestuff consumption of the wool fibre, a deeper depht of shade and higfher levelness.

Small amounts of modifier are inevitable for deep shades and high levelness. It is possible to recycle the modifier with the carbon dioxide.

30|$|SPME (solid phase microextraction) {{was chosen}} as the method of MVOCs sampling. The {{so-called}} sandwich fibre consisting of three different sorbents (DVB/CAR/PDMS) was chosen for MVOCs sorption [35]. Prior to sampling, each SPME fibre was placed for an hour in the injection port of the gas chromatograph (at 270  °C) in order to desorb any volatile compounds present {{on the surface of the}} fibre in accordance with the manufacturer’s instructions (fibre conditioning). The headspace technique was chosen to sample the MVOCs on SPME fibre in the vials. After piercing the septum, the fibre was push out from needle to a depth at which the sorbents were just over the developed mycelium. The sorption was continued for 24  h to maximize absorption. The sampling was carried out after 6  days of cultivation because it has been confirmed in the literature [19, 32, 35] that the highest MVOCs emission level is measured between the 5 th and the 7 th day of cultivation. When adsorption was completed, the needle was placed in the GC injector and desorption of MVOCs started. The temperature in the injector during desorption was 250  °C. Desorption was carried out for 15  min. This was sufficient time to completely desorb all of the compounds from the surface of the SPME fibre, what was confirmed by performing repeated desorption of the same <b>fibre.</b> <b>No</b> carry-over effect of analytes was observed.

A population of 93 and 82 RILs was tested in two seasons, with two parents and local controls, Sicot 75 (Gh) and Sipima 280 (Gb) in field experiments. Seed cotton samples hand harvested before and after defoliation were used to measure lint percent, boll weight, 100 seed weight and the lint to measure fibre length, uniformity, short fibre index (SFI), elongation, strength, micronaire, maturity ratio (MR), percent of maturity (PM) and fineness. There was large phenotypic variation for individual traits and transgressive segregation occurred in lint percent, lint weight/seed, <b>fibre</b> <b>no.</b> /seed, uniformity, SFI, elongation, MR and PM. Narrow sense heritabilities were moderate for yield components (34. 3 - 41. 2 %) and for key fibre properties, length, strength, micronaire and fineness (38. 3 - 42. 1 %), which led to a predicted selection response of 6. 7 - 24. 0 % for yield components and 3. 9 - 10. 9 % for key fibre properties under a selection intensity of 10 %. Favourable associations were found between key fibre properties, but an adverse association between lint percent and each of these fibre properties. Only five RILs were identified with desirable combinations.

40|$|Surface {{structure}} and surface mechanical properties {{of human hair}} have been characterized by atomic force microscopy in the imaging mode and by force vs. distance, F-d, analysis. The effects of treatment by commercial conditioner/shampoo or by aqueous exposure have been investigated. The cuticular structure has been imaged at medium resolution; longitudinal striations with lateral spacings of 150 - 350 nm and vertical corrugations in the range 2 - 8 nm were observed at higher resolution. The features {{are similar to those}} observed for untreated wool fibre. Both adventitious debris/contamination and residues from cosmetic treatment can be imaged with resolution in the low-nanometre range. Removal of the cuticular surface layer from treatment with alkali solution, and subsequent imaging, revealed a fibrous substructure. F-d analysis of the surface is a rich source of spatially resolved mechanical and chemical information. Surface stiffness, and an equivalent Young's Modulus, E, can be inferred from the shape of the 'approach' tip-to-surface contact curve. A value of E of 蠱 0 MPa was obtained for untreated hair. During aqueous exposure for 1 h the stiffness and modulus decreased by approximately a factor of 10. The discontinuity seen at 'lift-off' during the retract half-cycle of F-d analysis represents a measure of tip-to-surface adhesion. Adhesion decreased during aqueous exposure and was below the level of detectability after 1 h. Likewise, treatment by conditioner had the effect of lowering adhesion.

40|$|In the past, UV {{lithography}} {{has been}} used extensively for the fabrication of diffractive optical elements (DOEs). The advantage of this technique is that the entire structure can be written at one time, however, the minimum feature size is limited to about 1 μm. Many 1 -d and 2 -d periodic grating structures may not need such fine details but {{it is essential for}} diffractive optics with circular structures. This is because the spacing between features typically decreases towards the edge of the element resulting in the smallest feature falling well below 1 μm. 1 -d structures such as sub-wavelength gratings will also have smaller feature sizes throughout the structure. In such cases, advanced techniques such as Focused Ion Beam and Electron-beam Lithography are required for the fabrication of finer structures. In this paper, we present results of DOEs fabricated with a focused ion beam system (Nova Nanolab 600 from FEI) directly on a single mode fibre tip. The ability to write DOEs directly on fibre tip is of great importance in fields such as endoscopy and optical trapping. The DOE itself, transforms the laser beam to a phase and intensity profile that matches the requirement. Because it is located directly on the <b>fibre,</b> <b>no</b> extra alignment is required. In addition, the system becomes more compact, which is especially important for applications in the field of endoscopy. The main goal of the present work was to develop the most accurate method for creating the desired pattern (that is, the DOE structure) into an actually working element. Different exposure strategies for writing test structures directly with the ion beam on the fibre tip have been tested and carefully evaluated.

40|$|Advanced {{structural}} composites such as {{carbon and}} glass fibre-reinforced polymers {{have a limited}} ductility. This is due to intrinsic brittleness of the high performance fibres. The composite ductility can be enhanced by choosing fibers with a higher strain-to-failure, but most known ductile fibres (e. g. some natural and polymer fibres) have a low stiffness. The aim of this work was to investigate a new fibre type for application in composites  annealed stainless steel fibres. The unique property of these fibres is that they combine a high stiffness (± 193 GPa) with a strain-to-failure which can be tailored up to 20 %. The strain-to-failure {{is as high as}} that of a silk fibre and up to 10 times higher than that of a carbon fibre. An extensive experimental program, supported by modelling investigations, was performed to understand the mechanical behaviour of polymer composites made of these fibres. The influence of the matrix ductility, fibre architecture and interphase properties on the damage development and composite properties was investigated. Additionally steel fibre hybrids in combination with carbon fibres, glass fibres or drawn polypropylene tapes were studied. The ductile steel fibres delivered composites with a high stiffness and a high strain-to-failure. The strain-to-failure can be up to 22 %, which is much higher than a typical carbon and glass fibre composite (10 and 5 times, respectively). Steel fibre composites with ductile matrices showed the highest strain-to-failure and a distinctly different failure behaviour, compared to a steel fibre composite with a brittle matrix. In both cases the strain-to-failure could be further improved using a silane treatment which increased the adhesion strength. By replacing low amounts of steel fibres by carbon or glass fibres, the composite strength increased, but with a significantly lower strain-to-failure. However, the sudden failure which is typical for carbon and glass fibre composites, was not present. Adding steel fibres to self-reinforced polypropylene increased its stiffness and, also its specific stiffness despite the high density of steel. In contrast to hybridisation with a brittle <b>fibre,</b> <b>no</b> loss in strain-to-failure in a tensile test was measured. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|This {{study was}} {{concerned}} {{with the level of}} acceptability and perceptions of three types of commercially produced roller-milled white maize meal namely: sifted unfortified, sifted fortified and super fortified versus hammer-mill produced white and yellow maize meal (with and without fibre) among Shangaan consumers in Giyani in the Limpopo Province, South Africa (SA). The local households produce maize grain on a small scale or buy it from small scale farmers and take it to the local small scale millers for milling for a fee. The 48 participants for this project were female consumers (eighteen years old or older). The study was divided into two phases. The aim of the first phase was to determine the difference if any in acceptability of the sensory attributes of the various maize meal types. It employed a sensory evaluation technique which is a quantitative scientific method in which numerical data was collected and analysed in order to determine and compare consumer acceptability. The aim of the second phase was to discuss the perceptions of these consumers in relation to the products and employed focus-group interviews. During phase one maize meal porridge was prepared by local community volunteers under careful supervision in a standardized manner. The porridge was served warm: two samples at a time, marked with 3 -digit random codes. None of the participants had any prior information pertaining to the samples they were tasting at any time. The identity of the samples were only revealed during the focus-group interviews (phase two). Consumers preferred (liked) white sifted fortified maize meal porridge on a double blind basis more than the white sifted unfortified maize meal porridge. Hammer-mill white and hammer-mill yellow maize porridge with fibre were equally disliked by participants. There {{was no significant difference in}} the acceptability of hammer-mill white compared to yellow maize meal without <b>fibre.</b> <b>No</b> significant difference was found in preference for aroma, colour, consistency and taste between white sifted unfortified and super fortified maize meal compared to white hammer-mill maize meal without fibre. The difference in taste preference can only be attributed to the fortificant that is added commercially to the maize meal. This is quite a significant finding and different to that measured prior to the implementation of the SA National Fortification Scheme, where no impact on taste was measured. Furthermore, consumers’ preference for fortified maize meal on a double blind bias is in contrast to previous findings of research indicating a degree of dislike among consumers regarding fortified maize meal, according to maize millers’ opinion. During phase two focus-group interviews were conducted immediately following phase one. The participants sat in a cluster for these interviews. The qualitative data was transcribed verbatim into text for analysis and discussion of results. At least 40 out of 48 consumers stated that they liked the hammer-mill yellow maize meal porridge in terms of aroma, colour, texture, taste and for its nutritional value. Those in Homu 14 village stated that if the price of roller-mill maize meal was similar to that of yellow maize meal they would buy both maize types as they liked them equally but those in Mahlathi would buy yellow maize meal for nutritional reasons.

The contralateral muscles served as unstimulated controls. The mRNA levels for IL- 6, the glucose transport protein GLUT- 4 and β-actin in the rat muscles (white and red gastrocnemius and soleus) were quantified by quantitative competitive RT-PCR. The IL- 6 mRNA level, measured 30 min after the stimulation, increased after both eccentric and concentric contractions {{and there were no}} significant differences in IL- 6 mRNA levels between the different muscle <b>fibre</b> types. <b>No</b> significant increase in IL- 6 mRNA level was seen in the unstimulated contralateral muscle <b>fibres.</b> <b>No</b> increase in GLUT- 4 mRNA level was detected, indicating that the increase in IL- 6 mRNA level was not due to general changes in transcription.

Severity of social impairment, as measured by the Autistic Diagnostic Interview, was negatively correlated with diffusion anisotropy in the fibres of the left superior cerebellar peduncle. These findings suggest a vulnerability of specific cerebellar neural pathways in people with Asperger syndrome. The localised abnormalities in the main cerebellar outflow pathway may prevent the cerebral cortex from receiving those cerebellar feedback inputs necessary for a successful adaptive social behaviour...|$|R
