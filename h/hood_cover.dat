5000|$|StreetKa was a Ford inhouse design {{built by}} Pininfarina (the 2000 motor show concept was {{designed}} by Ghia, Turin) in Italy and all StreetKas have sill plates inscribed [...] "Pininfarina". Pininfarina produced 37,076 StreetKas between 2002 and 2005. StreetKa came in two equipment levels, basic and luxury. Basic had cloth seats and air conditioning was an option. Luxury featured leather seats with matching leather door card inserts, heated seats, a Thatcham approved alarm along with Ford's PATS immobiliser, air conditioning and heated door mirrors. Options included upgrading the single CD/radio to an in-dash 6 disc CD/radio and additional rear speakers beneath the roll over bars and a heated windscreen, standard on winter models. All models featured remote control central locking with remote boot release, driver and passenger air bags with passengers air bag deactivation, electric windows and door mirrors, electric headlight aim adjustment, anti-lock brakes, power steering, front fog lights, racing Puma aluminium gear knob, electric <b>hood</b> <b>cover</b> release and a rev counter. The engine used in StreetKa (and SportKa) is called a Duratec but it is of South African origin where it {{is known as the}} Zetec Rocam. StreetKa features McPherson struts front and rear and uses unique wider front lower arms (wishbones) giving it exceptional handling. The only exterior panel shared with Ka is the bonnet. The front headlights are also shared with Ka but appear different due to the front bumper covering them partly to change their shape. The interior shares most parts with Ka except StreetKa has its facia painted blue rather than silver. Its seats are mounted lower than Ka's and it has aluminium effect detailing.|$|E
40|$|A Thesis {{submitted}} to the Department of Mechanical Engineering for the Degree of Master of Engineering in Manufacturing Systems EngineeringTransportation {{has become a major}} socio-economic and environmental problem in urban environments today. Escalation of oil prices, environmental pollution, unsafe conditions, unbalanced designs of bicycles, motorcycles, and three wheelers and complex lifestyle are some of those significant contributing factors to it. Ergonomically designed Human Powered transport is one of the feasible solutions for urban requirements. Ergonomics deals with human comfort in any work situation in order to operate it efficiently and effectively. Concept of pedal car came into being in order to eliminate discomfort and unsafe conditions due to heat, dust, rain, unbalanced designs, uncovered body, and fatigue due to uneasy- postures. In addition to the above it provides cheap transport and recreational facility, physical exercise, while providing additional value for the rider to iron out complex health hazards. / Design of Power transmission system integrates with Engineering aspects, strength, rigidity, stability and ergonomics aspects. One of the major innovative steps taken in fabrication of first embodiment of the pedal car is to eliminate long chains by introducing pedal linkage with a shorter chain. First embodiment incorporates positive achievements such as; ergonomically designed compact long wheel base and seat, shorter chain, standard parts, small wheel sizes. Affordable price, environmentally friendly, fashionable appearance, F. asy manufacturability and maintainability of Driving Mechanism, and physical exercise to the rider. Over weight of frame and wheel assembly deprived acceleration in gradient at 30 ° to Kim/h and 15 - 18 Km/h in level roads. Reduction of weight of the first embodiment by rc-design and re-selection of parts with lighter <b>hood</b> <b>cover</b> with additional power supply to the system also required to overcome the above problem. One of the major limitations of this study is maximum human power in put. Further study on maximum power application in relation to pedal height, seat angle, toot position and crank length is also important for further improvements...|$|E

40|$|Background: Toxic {{epidermal}} necrolysis can {{be fatal}} and nursing care with careful monitoring of temperature and humidity can improve survival rate. We adapted the greenhouse and igloo principle using a common hood to monitor the temperature and humidity. Methods: A small heater with a regulator {{was placed in a}} mini hood and temperature was recorded inside the uncovered <b>hood</b> and <b>hood</b> <b>covered</b> with green cloth and aluminium foil separately. The regular hood was placed over a volunteer and the temperature was measured inside the open <b>hood</b> and <b>hood</b> <b>covered</b> with green cloth and aluminium foil separately. The relative humidity was also monitored using Zeal mercury dry - wet bulb hygrometer. Results: Temperature increase was most marked in the foil-covered hood followed by cloth-covered hood, both with the heater and the volunteer. Similarly, in the volunteer study, the humidity was best maintained inside the aluminium foil-covered hood. Conclusion: We recommend the use of regular <b>hood</b> with suitable <b>cover</b> to monitor the humidity and temperature of patients with toxic epidermal necrolysis...|$|R
