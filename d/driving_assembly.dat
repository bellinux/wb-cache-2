50|$|Dead {{reckoning}} (DR) uses {{a mechanical}} system {{linked to the}} vehicle’s <b>driving</b> <b>assembly</b> in order to predict the path taken by the vehicle. By measuring {{the rotation of the}} road wheels over time, a fairly precise estimation of the vehicle’s speed and distance traveled can be made. Dead reckoning requires the vehicle to begin at a known, fixed point. Then, by combining speed and distance data with factors such as the angle of the steering wheel and feedback from specialized sensors (e.g., accelerometers, flux gate compass, gyroscope) it can plot the path taken by the vehicle. By overlaying this path onto a digital map, the DR system knows approximately where the vehicle is, what the local speed limit is, and the speed at which the vehicle is traveling. The system can then use information provided by the digital map to warn of upcoming hazards or points of interest and to provide warnings if the speed limit is exceeded. Some top-end GPS-based navigation systems currently on the market use dead reckoning as a backup system in case the GPS signal is lost. Dead reckoning is prone to cumulative measurement errors such as variations between the assumed circumference of the tyres compared to the actual dimension (which is used to calculate vehicle speed and distance traveled). These variations in the tyre circumference can be due to wear or variations in tyre pressure due to variations in speed, payload, or ambient temperature. Other measurement errors are accumulated when the vehicle navigates gradual curves that inertial sensors (e.g., gyroscopes and/or accelerometers) are not sensitive enough to detect or due to electromagnetic influences on magnetic flux compasses (e.g., from passing under power lines or when travelling across a steel bridge) and through underpasses and road tunnels.|$|E

The expressions were developed by substituting the number of truss components in specific truss divisions into associated polynomial equations and solving for the coefficients of the polynomials. To assist in automated or astronaut truss/panel assembly operations, a concept for assembling a tetrahedral truss with hexagonal panels is presented. The assembly concept minimizes the exchange of truss assembly devices and panel attachment devices, assuming that the number of exchanges is a <b>driving</b> <b>assembly</b> concern...|$|E

The system consists of a flexible vehicle, two flexible rings and a magnetic suspension and <b>driving</b> <b>assembly.</b> The necessary skewing of the rings for maneuvering of the vehicle is accomplished by moving the pairs of magnets along tracks distributed around the circumference of the vehicle. The equations of motion for each subsystem are derived by the Lagrangian approach. Attitude motions are {{described in terms of}} quasi-coordinates. For small vehicle angular rates and rings attitude motions, an ordering scheme can be used to separate the equations of motion according to the magnitude of the terms. The ordered equations of motion lead to a linear time-variant optimal control problem for the maneuvering of the spacecraft...|$|E

However, it has not been clearly determined whether the fungal species that arrive first may, potentially, dictate the subsequent pathway of community development, that is, whether there is a priority effect at the species level. We used traditional culture-based techniques coupled with sequencing of amplified genetic markers to profile the fungal communities in beech (Fagus sylvatica) disks that had been pre-colonised separately with nine species from various stages of fungal succession. Clear differences in community composition were evident following pre-colonisation by different species with three distinct successor communities identified, indicating that individual species may have pivotal effects in <b>driving</b> <b>assembly</b> history.

40|$|Caenorhabditis elegans body wall muscle {{contains}} two isoforms of myosin heavy chain, MHC A and MHC B, that {{differ in their}} ability to initiate thick filament assembly. Whereas mutant animals that lack the major isoform, MHC B, have fewer thick filaments, mutant animals that lack the minor isoform, MHC A, contain no normal thick filaments. MHC A, but not MHC B, is present {{at the center of the}} bipolar thick filament where initiation of assembly is thought to occur (Miller, D. M.,I. Ortiz, G. C. Berliner, and H. F. Epstein. 1983. Cell. 34 : 477 - 490). We mapped the sequences that confer A-specific function by constructing chimeric myosins and testing them in vivo. We have identified two distinct regions of the MHC A rod that are sufficient in chimeric myosins for filament initiation function. Within these regions, MHC A displays a more hydrophobic rod surface, making it more similar to paramyosin, which forms the thick filament core. We propose that these regions play an important role in filament initiation, perhaps mediating close contacts between MHC A and paramyosin in an antiparallel arrangement at the filament center. Furthermore, our analysis revealed that all striated muscle myosins show a characteristic variation in surface hydrophobicity along the length of the rod that may play an important role in <b>driving</b> <b>assembly</b> and determining the stagger at which dimers associate...|$|E
40|$|Human {{immunodeficiency}} virus type 1 (HIV- 1) Gag {{is the main}} structural protein <b>driving</b> <b>assembly</b> and release of virions from infected cells. Gag alone is capable of self-assembly in vitro, but host factors {{have been shown to}} play a role in efficient viral replication and particle morphogenesis within the living cell. In a series of affinity purification experiments, we identified the cellular protein Lyric to be an HIV- 1 Gag-interacting protein. Lyric was previously described to be an HIV-inducible gene and is involved in various signaling pathways. Gag interacts with endogenous Lyric via its matrix (MA) and nucleocapsid (NC) domains. This interaction requires Gag multimerization and Lyric amino acids 101 to 289. Endogenous Lyric is incorporated into HIV- 1 virions and is cleaved by the viral protease. Gag-Lyric interaction was also observed for murine leukemia virus and equine infectious anemia virus, suggesting that it represents a conserved feature among retroviruses. Expression of the Gag binding domain of Lyric increased Gag expression levels and viral infectivity, whereas expression of a Lyric mutant lacking the Gag binding site resulted in lower Gag expression and decreased viral infectivity. The results of the current study identify Lyric to be a cellular interaction partner of HIV- 1 Gag and hint at a potential role in regulating infectivity. Further experiments are needed to elucidate the precise role of this interaction. Human {{immunodeficiency virus}} 1 (HIV- 1) assembly an...|$|E

40|$|Habitat {{fragmentation}} {{is one of}} {{the principal}} causes of biodiversity loss and hence understanding its impacts on community assembly and disassembly is an important topic in ecology. We studied the relationships between fragmentation and community assembly processes in the land-bridge island system of Thousand Island Lake in East China. We focused on the changes in species diversity and phylogenetic diversity that occurred between life stages of woody plants growing on these islands. The observed diversities were compared with the expected diversities from random null models to characterize assembly processes. Regression tree analysis was used to illustrate the relationships between island attributes and community assembly processes. We found that different assembly processes predominate in the seedlings-to-saplings life-stage transition (SS) vs. the saplings-to-trees transition (ST). Island area was the main attribute <b>driving</b> the <b>assembly</b> process in SS. In ST, island isolation was more important. Within a fragmented landscape, the factors <b>driving</b> community <b>assembly</b> processes were found to differ between life stage transitions. Environmental filtering had a strong effect on the seedlings-to-saplings life-stage transition. Habitat isolation and dispersal limitation influenced all plant life stages, but had a weaker effect on communities than area.

40|$|Coal fly ash dumps {{represent}} contaminated {{sites that}} pollute {{the environment and}} affect the health of living organisms. Vegetation development at ash dumps is an ecological solution to minimize the environmental threats of ash; however, low content of nutrients, organic matter and moisture pose a challenge for plant growth at the dumps. Bacterial indole acetic acid (IAA) facilitates plant recruitment and growth, more crucially in degraded ecosystems. Bacteria with different levels of IAA determine the plant-bacterial interactions as pathogenesis or symbiosis, therefore, form microbial functional types. Understanding plant-soil feedback and identifying environmental predictors of bacterial IAA producers at ash dump would help in improving biostimulation strategies for vegetation development. Therefore, to evolve a nature-based solution for vegetational restoration of ash dumps, we analyzed the role of geochemical factors, host species and age of dump on the assembly of rhizobacterial IAA functional types of naturally colonizing grasses (Saccharum ravennae and Cynodon dactylon). Analyses showed that the rhizosphere effect on geochemical traits was distinct in the dumps, irrespective of the host plant and age of the dumps. The rhizobacterial communities from the dumps produce relatively high mean IAA levels and harbor a high micro-diversity of IAA producers {{as compared with the}} region as a whole (non-rhizosphere or bulk ash). Canonical correspondence analysis showed that the host species and specific nutrients, i. e., NO 3 -N, PO 4 -P, Fe, and Na are the significant predictors of bacterial IAA functional types. S. ravennae and C. dactylon provided evidence of <b>driving</b> <b>assembly</b> of different IAA functional types in their rhizosphere via enrichment of NO 3 -N and PO 4 -P, respectively. The identification of environmental predictors of rhizobacterial IAA functional types of S. ravennae and C. dactylon has provided basic guidelines to improve the biostimulation strategies to accelerate vegetation restoration at the ash dumps. Both controlled and field experiments involving grass species with supplementation of specific nutrients would be required to develop an effective biostimulation strategy for the on-field application...|$|E
40|$|Understanding how galaxies obtain baryons, their {{stars and}} gas, over cosmic time is {{traditionally}} approached {{in two different}} ways - theoretically and observationally. In general, observational approaches to galaxy formation include measuring basic galaxy properties, such as luminosities, stellar masses, rotation speeds, star formation rates and how these features evolve through time. Theoretically, cosmologically based models collate the physical effects <b>driving</b> galaxy <b>assembly</b> - mergers of galaxies, accretion of gas, star formation, and feedback, amongst others, to form predictions which are matched to galaxy observables. An alternative approach is to examine directly, in an observational way, the processes <b>driving</b> galaxy <b>assembly,</b> including the effects of feedback. This is a new `third way' towards understanding how galaxies are forming from gas accretion and mergers, and directly probes these effects instead of relying on simulations designed to reproduce observations. This empirical approach towards understanding galaxy formation, including the acquisition history of baryons, displays some significant differences with the latest galaxy formation models, in addition to directly demonstrating the mechanisms by which galaxies form most of their baryonic mass.

40|$|The {{importance}} of competition between similar species in <b>driving</b> community <b>assembly</b> is much debated. Recently, phylogenetic patterns in species composition {{have been investigated}} to help resolve this question: phylogenetic clustering is taken to imply environmental filtering, and phylogenetic overdispersion to indicate limiting similarity between species. We used experimental plant communities with random species compositions and initially even abundance distributions to examine the development of phylogenetic pattern in species abundance distributions. Where composition was held constant by weeding, abundance distributions became overdispersed through time, but only in communities that contained distantly related clades, some with several species (i. e., a mix of closely and distantly related species). Phylogenetic pattern in composition therefore constrained the development of overdispersed abundance distributions, and this might indicate limiting similarity between close relatives and facilitation/complementarity between distant relatives. Comparing the phylogenetic patterns in these communities with those expected from the monoculture abundances of the constituent species revealed that interspecific competition caused the phylogenetic patterns. Opening experimental communities to colonization by all species in the species pool led to convergence in phylogenetic diversity. At convergence, communities were composed of several distantly related but species-rich clades and had overdispersed abundance distributions. This suggests that limiting similarity processes determine which species dominate a community but not which species occur in a community. Crucially, as our study {{was carried out in}} experimental communities, we could rule out local evolutionary or dispersal explanations for the patterns and identify ecological processes as the driving force, underlining the advantages of studying these processes in experimental communities. Our results show that phylogenetic relations between species provide a good guide to understanding community structure and add a new perspective to the evidence that niche complementarity is critical in <b>driving</b> community <b>assembly...</b>|$|R

By contrast, the influence of stochastic processes on bacterial community assembly was higher in the sediments closest to the water line, more likely due to lower levels of abiotic stress.

40|$|SummaryE-cadherin is {{the major}} {{adhesion}} receptor in epithelial adherens junctions, which connect cells to form tissues and are essential for morphogenesis and homeostasis. The mechanism by which E-cadherin monomers cluster and become organized in adherens junctions remains poorly understood. Here, using superresolution microscopy techniques in combination with structure-informed functional mutations, we found that loosely organized clusters of approximately five E-cadherin molecules that form independently of cis or trans interactions, and that are delimited by the cortical F-actin meshwork, are the precursors of trans-ligated adhesive clusters {{that make up the}} adherens junction. The density of E-cadherin clusters was wide ranged, and notably, we could detect densities consistent with the crystal lattice structure at the core of adhesive clusters, which were dependent on extracellular domain interactions.

50|$|Characterization of EAS {{secondary}} elements {{involved in}} rodlet assembly have given {{insights into the}} mechanism behind class I hydrophobins self-assembly, but important structural differences with DewA, another class I hydrophobin, suggest that the mechanisms <b>driving</b> rodlet <b>assembly</b> vary among different types of hydrophobins. Like EAS, DewA also has a β-barrel core structure, but it differs significantly from it because of its considerable content of helical secondary elements. A unique feature of DewA is its capacity to exist as two types of conformers in solution, both able to form rodlet assemblies but at different rates. Despite these differences in structural and self-assembly mechanisms, both EAS and DewA form robust fibrillar monolayers, meaning that there must exist several pathways, protein sequences and tertiary conformations able to self-assemble into amphipathic monolayers. Further characterisation of both EAS and DewA and their rodlet self-assembly mechanisms will open up opportunities for rational design of hydrophobins with novel biotechnological applications.|$|R

Paramyxovirus particles form by assembly of the viral matrix protein, the ribonucleoprotein complex and the surface glycoproteins at the plasma membrane of infected cells and subsequent viral budding. Two major glycoproteins expressed on the viral envelope, the attachment protein and the fusion protein, promote attachment of the virus to host cells and subsequent virus-cell membrane fusion.
