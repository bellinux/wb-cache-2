Most importantly, SDC Platinum and Thomson One provide data on all divestitures that companies undertake (and indeed, {{on all of}} their corporate strategy transactions, including acquisitions and alliances). While these data are reasonably comprehensive in identifying the dates of and the entities involved in each divestiture, some of the <b>deal-specific</b> <b>information</b> (e.g., was a sale the outcome of an auction or {{the result of a}} privately-negotiated transaction?) is less comprehensive. Additionally, Compustat and CRSP can be used to collect data on the financial characteristics and stock market performance of the publicly-traded companies that are involved in divestitures: divesting firms, acquiring firms that buy divested business units (in the case of selloffs), and newly-independent spinoff firms (in the case of spinoffs).|$|E

This, in turn, reflects the perception amongst investors that investments in technology-based firms involve greater uncertainty (in terms of market and technology) and hence higher risks. This paper explores this contention {{by means of an}} examination of the performance of investments made by business angels (informal investors) in technology and non-technology firms. Based on the analysis of <b>deal-specific</b> <b>information,</b> the authors demonstrate that the overall returns profiles of the two types of investments are not significantly different. This may be because business angels are better able than venture capital fund executives to manage the risks involved in investing in technology-based firms on account of their industrial and entrepreneurial backgrounds. Alternatively, it may reflect the fact that the risks involved in investing in technology-based firms have been overstated...|$|E
