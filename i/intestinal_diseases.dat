500|$|The {{presence}} of Abir {{in the area}} exacerbated the effect of natural disasters such as famine and disease. Abir's tax collection system forced men out from the villages to collect rubber which meant {{that there was no}} labour available to clear new fields for planting. This in turn meant that the women had to continue to plant worn-out fields resulting in lower yields, a problem aggravated by Abir sentries stealing crops and farm animals. The post at Bonginda experienced a famine in 1899 and in 1900 missionaries recorded a [...] "terrible famine" [...] across the Abir region. The modern descendants of Abir's villagers refer to the period of company control as [...] "Lonkali", the period of famine. Disease was also a problem with smallpox moving in from the east being reported in the Upper Lopori in 1893 and reaching Bongandanga in 1901. A concurrent smallpox epidemic moving from the west destroyed villages along the Lulonga in 1899, and reached Basankusu in 1902. Sleeping sickness was also reported around the Lulonga by 1900 and spread up the Maringa and Lopori. Despite the arrival of these deadly diseases the main killers in the area were lung and <b>intestinal</b> <b>diseases</b> which killed twenty times as many people as smallpox and sleeping sickness combined. At least one missionary attributed the rise of disease with rubber collecting.|$|E

40|$|AIM: To {{identify}} {{definitions of}} cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection and <b>intestinal</b> <b>disease,</b> in {{inflammatory bowel disease}} (IBD), to determine the prevalence associated with these definitions. METHODS: We conducted a systematic review and interrogated PubMed, EMBASE and Cochrane for literature on prevalence and diagnostics of CMV infection and <b>intestinal</b> <b>disease</b> in IBD patients. As medical headings we used "cytomegalovirus" OR "CMV" OR "cytomegalo virus" AND "inflammatory bowel disease" OR "IBD" OR "ulcerative colitis" OR "colitis ulcerosa" OR "Crohn's disease". Both MeSH-terms and free searches were performed. We included all types of English-language (clinical) trials concerning diagnostics and prevalence of CMV in IBD. RESULTS: The search strategy identified 924 citations, and 52 articles were eligible for inclusion. We identified 21 different definitions for CMV infection, 8 definitions for CMV <b>intestinal</b> <b>disease</b> and 3 definitions for CMV reactivation. Prevalence numbers depend on used definition, studied population and region. The highest prevalence for CMV infection was found when using positive serum PCR as a definition, whereas for CMV <b>intestinal</b> <b>disease</b> this applies {{to the use of}} tissue PCR > 10 copies/mg tissue. Most patients with CMV infection and <b>intestinal</b> <b>disease</b> had steroid refractory disease and came from East Asia. CONCLUSION: We detected multiple different definitions used for CMV infection and <b>intestinal</b> <b>disease</b> in IBD patients, which has an effect on prevalence numbers and eventually on outcome in different trials...|$|R
40|$|Clostridium {{perfringens}} {{is one of}} {{the most}} important causes of <b>intestinal</b> <b>disease</b> in animals and humans. Its virulence is attributed to the several toxins it can produce, including the beta 2 toxin encoded by cpb 2. In this thesis we studied the role of the beta 2 toxin produced by C. perfringens in the development of <b>intestinal</b> <b>disease.</b> Results described in this thesis demonstrate that a possible role for beta 2 toxin in the development of <b>intestinal</b> <b>disease</b> is still disputable. The development of a new primer set which recognizes both alleles of cpb 2 and the development of a new test strategy for application of the newly developed PCR on fecal samples improved test sensitivity for the presence of cpb 2. However, a relationship between cpb 2 -harbouring C. perfringens, beta 2 toxin,and <b>intestinal</b> <b>disease</b> could not be proven in chickens and roe deer. Although cpb 2 -positive C. perfringens was abundantly present in the intestinal tract of roe deer, only two isolated strains were able to produce the beta 2 toxin in vitro and the beta 2 toxin was not demonstrated in the intestinal tract by immunohistochemistry in any of the animals. C. perfringens was isolated from both healthy and diseased laying hens with a newly described form of subclinical necrotic enteritis. No relationship could be determined between <b>intestinal</b> <b>disease</b> and the presence of beta 2 toxin producing C. perfringens. However, focal necrotic lesions were only found in the intestinal tract of laying hens with a high watery intestinal content which may have played a predisposing factor in the development of disease providing substrate for beta 2 toxin production by C. perfringens. A significant role for the beta 2 toxin in the development of <b>intestinal</b> <b>disease</b> could not be established in an in vitro model in which the cytotoxic effect of supernatant of cpb 2 -positive C. perfringens cultures with and without beta 2 toxin were compared. A proven role for the beta 2 toxin in the development of <b>intestinal</b> <b>disease</b> or reproduction of the disease by other infection models has not been achieved yet. Therefore the role of the beta 2 toxin in the development of <b>intestinal</b> <b>disease</b> remains at least questionable. Other virulence factors, the intestinal microbiota, and environmental circumstances might influence the significance of the intestinal presence of cpb 2 -harbouring C. perfringens in the development of <b>intestinal</b> <b>disease.</b> This hypothesis was supported by the finding of a reducing effect of Lactobacillus fermentum on beta 2 toxin production by cpb 2 -harbouring C. perfringens. A lower transcription of cpb 2 and a lower production of beta 2 toxin were demonstrated with the presence of L. fermentum while the viability of C. perfringens was not affected. In this way, environmental influences might increase the role of cpb 2 -harbouring C. perfringens in the development of <b>intestinal</b> <b>disease</b> too. Articles on predisposing factors for the development of C. perfringens-associated <b>intestinal</b> <b>disease</b> in animals and human beings were reviewed and discussed. In vivo studies investigating both beta 2 toxin and predisposing factors are necessary to definitely determine or exclude a potential role for beta 2 toxin in the development of <b>intestinal</b> <b>disease...</b>|$|R

Both the soldiers and the instructors at the base drank excessively, as alcohol was cheap and plentiful. Toole remarked in another letter to Fletcher, [...] "We are all rotting here at the moment.
