The album included popular songs from musicals identified by a poll on her radio show, in which 400,000 listeners voted. At this point, Paige had recorded 20 solo albums in total, of which eight were consecutively certified gold and another four multi-platinum, {{and she had}} been featured on seven cast albums. Paige also appeared in concert in Scandinavia, Hong Kong, Europe, the Middle East, New Zealand, Australia and Singapore.

40|$|A {{journalist}} {{working for}} an Internet news service recently made {{an interesting point}} about {{the present state of}} online media. &# 8216;To make money on the Web now,&# 8217; he said, &# 8216;you&# 8217;ve really <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> tied <b>to</b> <b>something</b> else, like a newspaper, a television show or a radio program. Otherwise, it&# 8217;s just too tough. &# 8217; Comments such as these spell the end of the old Internet hubris, the hopes for a digital multitude of new sources of information and new choices for entertainment. It&# 8217;s too early to write online media off, because there are independent sites out there, but Australia&# 8217;s most popular websites remain those controlled by the old communications establishment &# 8212; the television networks, the newspapers, Telstra. Around the world, media companies are seeking new and larger markets beyond their traditional businesses. As the boundaries shift, regulators in Europe and the United States are rewriting the rules for a new era. In Australia we also need to think again about how to secure diversity in the media, remembering that the industry here is already highly concentrated. The Federal Minister for Communications argues that the old restrictions on media ownership are outdated and should be removed. The crucial question is whether there are other or better ways to promote the plurality of opinion and information which is important for a healthy democracy. There is now some urgency about this issue. The Coalition came to power committed to remove the cross-media rules, which have prevented cross-ownership between commercial broadcasting and newspapers since the 1980 s. After an earlier attempt at change, and a prolonged period of toying with the idea, the government says it wants to try again on cross-media in the next parliamentary session. It is true that the current policy was devised for an older media landscape, before pay television, the Internet and digital broadcasting. The rules have never been updated, and a new web of cross ownership has emerged around them; one example is Foxtel, owned by Telstra, the Packers&# 8217; Publishing and Broadcasting Limited, and News Limited. Another case was Telstra&# 8217;s almost-but-not-quite purchase of the Nine Network a few years ago, which would have been allowed by the current rules. Changing circumstances do raise questions about our media ownership rules. The Trade Practices Act on its own does not seem to provide an answer; some specific rules are necessary for preserving diversity in the media, because the political, social and cultural value of diversity cannot be equated exactly with the commercial value of competition in media markets. So far, however, the public debate on this issue has been highly constrained. We know what the media companies want, and we know what the Minister would like to do, but there appears <b>to</b> <b>be</b> little broader support for change. The government cannot change the rules without the support of the Senate. So far, neither the Democrats, nor Labor, nor the Greens have offered Senator Alston much encouragement. The problem is that ownership rules are only one part of a complex system which stands in need of renovation. They protect a modicum of diversity for the time being, but their usefulness must inevitably be limited as new technologies emerge. Media diversity will ultimately be better served by a more inclusive and more comprehensive program of reform. Since the Internet can no longer be presented as the answer to all our problems, the immediate need <b>is</b> <b>to</b> fix the mistakes of the past few years. We need to encourage new broadcasters rather than banning them. We need {{to make the most of}} digital television rather than handicapping it. And we need to strengthen the mix of services by supporting the indigenous, community and public broadcasting sectors alongside a revitalised commercial industry.

So even though ex-Lt. Joe Leaphorn has retired from the Tribal Police (The Fallen Man, 1996), he’s back on the job, looking for Pollard at the request of her wealthy aunt. The murder case couldn’t seem simpler; Jano’s even gotten his blood obligingly mixed with his victim’s on both their clothing, and his claim that they were both nipped by an eagle isn’t borne out by the eagle on the scene, which doesn’t show a trace of blood itself. But Jano’s public defender—who just happens to be Chee’s off-again fiance Janet Pete, returned from hobnobbing in Washington, D.C., to the Rez, but not to Chee’s arms—insists that her client is innocent; Leaphorn’s crisscrossing investigation keeps turning up evidence that the murder and the disappearance are {{two sides of the same}} coin; and an ambitious prosecutor is so eager for a capital conviction that there’s <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>something</b> funny.

The main reason and focus behind the idea of this app is based around the user’s security and personal safety. The aim of the project is to develop a mobile messenger application that utilizes an Auto Message feature where the user can allow for, and set a location to a specific WI-FI network or multiple networks. For example, a user’s home WI-FI network can have a location set to “home. ” When the user’s phone automatically connects to an activated WI-FI network the app will implement the Auto Message feature and send out a templated message, the message will be sent to chosen groups or individuals. The message will be based on the locations that have been set for the specific Wi-Fi networks, and what Wi-Fi network the phone has connected to (“work” “home” “college” “Johns house”) the templated message may look like this (“user-name” has arrived at “set location” or “Paul” has arrived at “home”). As specified in the background, the main overall goal of this app is to achieve something that positively contributes towards the safety of the person using it...|$|E

40|$|The University of Notre Dame Australia’s Fremantle Campus July {{graduation}} ceremony saw School of Nursing Lecturer, Christine Michel, graduate {{as the first}} PhD student from the School of Nursing. Notre Dame’s School of Nursing opened in 2000 and its Doctoral Degree program was introduced in 2003. Under the supervision of Professor Selma Alliex, Dean of the School of Nursing, Dr Michel’s topic: Implementing A Forensic Educational Package for Registered Nurses in Two Emergency Departments in Western Australia, looked at forensic education for nurses in Western Australia. In particular, it focused on emergency departments. “I chose the emergency department (ED) because that is my speciality. EDs are where you see {{a higher percentage of}} forensic patients coming in daily,” said Dr Michel. “I was introduced to forensic nursing in America in 1996. When I came home in 2000, I started working in the ED again and I unfortunately {{was one of those people}} who were on the wrong side of a patient and was assaulted at work. Nobody really knew what to do and there were no protocols in place,” said Dr Michel. “Given my experience in an ED system that worked really well in America and across Canada, I thought there’s <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>something</b> done about this. Patients shouldn’t have to feel helpless. People being on the receiving end of violence shouldn’t have to fumble their way through the system, which is what I had to do because nobody knew how to guide me. ” Dr Michel looked at options of educating nurses in forensic education with the goal of empowering nurses with knowledge which she believed would greatly benefit their work. Dr Michel used many different methodologies in the process of completing her PhD. She looked through educational material and completed trials with control groups and intervention groups which involved working with several hospitals and their nursing staff. “Everybody who has been involved in the project has been very positive about the outcomes and they want the end product. People didn’t have a great knowledge of the management of forensic patients and the possible legal implications. Hopefully this will bridge that ‘knowledge gap’. ” Media contact: Rebecca Cassidy 08 9433 0611, 0408 959 13...|$|E
