5|$|During the 1550s, Henry II became {{concerned}} about the threat of an English or Holy Roman Empire attack on Paris, and strengthened the defences of the Bastille in response. The southern gateway into the Bastille became the principal entrance to the castle in 1553, the other three gateways being closed. A bastion, a large earthwork projecting eastwards from the Bastille, was built to provide additional protective fire for the Bastille and the Arsenal; the bastion was reached from the fortress across a stone abutment using a connecting drawbridge that was installed in the Bastille's Comté tower. In 1573 the Porte Saint-Antoine was also altered – the drawbridges were replaced with a <b>fixed</b> <b>bridge,</b> and the medieval gatehouse was replaced with a triumphal arch.|$|E

5|$|An implant {{supported}} bridge (or fixed denture) is a {{group of}} teeth secured to dental implants so the prosthetic cannot be removed by the user. Bridges typically connect to more than one implant and may also connect to teeth as anchor points. Typically the number of teeth will outnumber the anchor points with the teeth that are directly over the implants referred to as abutments and those between abutments referred to as pontics. Implant supported bridges attach to implant abutments {{in the same way as}} a single tooth implant replacement. A <b>fixed</b> <b>bridge</b> may replace as few as two teeth (also known as a fixed partial denture) and may extend to replace an entire arch of teeth (also known as a fixed full denture). In both cases, the prosthesis is said to be fixed because it cannot be removed by the denture wearer.|$|E
5|$|Below Spalding, {{there were}} no {{restrictions}} on headroom, which allowed small coasters to reach the town. The bridge at Fosdyke was a swing bridge, {{to comply with the}} provisions of the Fosdyke Bridge Act of 1870. The demise of such traffic allowed it {{to be replaced by a}} <b>fixed</b> <b>bridge</b> with headroom of , but the powers of the original act had to be rescinded, and the Port of Fosdyke Act was obtained in 1987 to allow this to happen. The redundant wharfs at Fosdyke have been developed to provide moorings for yachts and other pleasure craft. The lock at Fulney has three sets of gates, two pointing towards the sea, and a third between them which points upriver. The lock can thus only be used when the level below it is higher than the level above it, and as the tide falls, the intermediate gate closes to prevent its use.|$|E
5|$|The New Junction Canal and the Stainforth and Keadby Canal {{leave the}} end of the River Don Navigation, and both head broadly north east, but whereas the New Junction Canal {{continues}} in a straight line for its entire length, the Stainforth and Keadby gradually turns to the east. Shortly after the junction, Bramwith Lock lowers the level of the canal. The River Don, after flowing under the New Junction Canal, joins the canal and continues close to the north bank for several miles. Bramwith Swing Bridge is the first of several swing bridges, most of which are operated by boaters. The tiny village of Kirk Bramwith is just {{to the north of the}} canal and river. Its notable buildings include the church of St Mary, much of which dates from the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries, with a twelfth-century southern doorway. The building is a grade II* listed structure. The hamlet of South Bramwith lies to the south, with Bramwith Hall, a grade II listed 3-storey, 5-bay eighteenth-century country house, which was rebuilt in the early nineteenth century, situated close to the canal. The canal passes to the north of Stainforth, where there is a <b>fixed</b> <b>bridge.</b> A basin, with its former connection to the Don, is now used as moorings by Thorne Cruising Club. This first section is now generally considered to be part of the Stainforth and Keadby Canal, although it was originally part of the Don Navigation as far as Stainforth Lock.|$|E
40|$|Abstract The aims of {{this study}} were to {{evaluate}} the treatment need of <b>fixed</b> <b>bridges</b> according to the distribution of pontics in dentition in different age groups, and to investigate the primary and late complications and survival of the conventional fixed metal ceramic prostheses, as well as patients' satisfaction with the prosthetic treatment. The whole material consisted of the patients treated with fixed metal ceramic prostheses by undergraduate students at the Institute of Dentistry during the years 1984 - 1996. There were altogether 772 patients, 460 women (60 %) and 312 men (40 %). Their mean age was 47 years (23 - 81 years). Altogether 944 single metal ceramic crowns and 543 <b>fixed</b> <b>bridges</b> (1374 abutments and 807 pontics) were prepared. It can be concluded that the <b>fixed</b> <b>bridges</b> are most often prepared to replace upper first premolars and lower first molars also in the future. The most usual primary complications related to <b>fixed</b> <b>bridges</b> occurred during preprosthetic endodontic treatment of abutment teeth and during the preparation of the root canals. Previous restoration of the prepared tooth does not have any marked effect on the prognosis of single crowns with dowels, although anatomically complicated upper lateral incisors and upper first premolars need special attention in the treatment planning. Patients were satisfied with aesthetics and function of the fixed metal ceramic prostheses. Late complications found in clinical examinations were few, and the survival rate for the <b>fixed</b> metal ceramic <b>bridge</b> prostheses was calculated to be 84 % after 10 years, long <b>fixed</b> <b>bridges</b> having a lower survival than the shorter ones. The treatment need for conventional <b>fixed</b> <b>bridges</b> seems to be highest among patients over 50 years of age in the future. Age does not influence the longevity of the fixed prostheses, but basic circumstances of the mouth, especially low secretion of saliva affected by diseases and/or medications and high scores of lactobacilli and streptococcus mutans of the saliva seem to decrease the survival...|$|R

5|$|The 130th Engineer Brigade {{focused on}} {{bridging}} projects as was its specialty, but it ultimately found itself undertaking numerous different projects {{throughout the country}} for much of 2003 and into 2004.

25|$|The last barge {{to travel}} on the section between Pallingham and Newbridge was {{recorded}} in 1888, and Hardham tunnel was closed in 1889. The artificial cuts were officially abandoned in 1896, but limited traffic continued on the old river sections into the 20th century, notably bricks from Harwoods Green below Pallingham and chalk from Houghton Bridge; they were finally stopped in 1938 by a new, <b>fixed</b> <b>bridge</b> on the Havant to Brighton railway line at Ford.|$|E
25|$|By {{the late}} 1930s the {{southern}} section had become derelict, although a water supply was maintained, which the GWR used to supply its engine shed in Stratford. The northern section was never officially closed, but traffic had virtually ceased by 1939. It was blocked when bridge no. 2, the Tunnel Lane lift bridge at Lifford, became faulty, {{and was replaced}} by the GWR with a <b>fixed</b> <b>bridge</b> which left insufficient height for a boat to pass.|$|E
25|$|Starting from Eldad, {{the route}} would curve {{to the north}} and cross the River Tamar about two miles above Torpoint, by a <b>fixed</b> <b>bridge,</b> running close to the north bank of the Lynher to St Germans.

40|$|Long – term {{survival}} rate of bridges over implants {{is the goal}} of the implant therapy. Often <b>fixed</b> <b>bridges</b> are supported by combination of natural teeth and implants. OBJECTIVE: Our goal is to check the {{survival rate}} of the prosthetics over combination of natural teeth and implants comparing to fixed prosthetics over natural teeth within 4 years of follow up. MATERIAL AND METHOD: The patients were divided into 2 groups. The implant group of 20 patients with 32 implants were planned to support 25 <b>fixed</b> <b>bridges</b> supported by combination of implants and natural teeth and the control group of 20 patients with 25 <b>fixed</b> <b>bridges</b> over natural teeth. Clinical data according survival rate criteria were evaluated at the baseline, 3 months, 1 year and 4 years after the finished prosthetic therapy. RESULTS: The results could not show any significant difference in any of scheduled check-up periods. CONCLUSION: Well-planned implant placement and precise prosthetic work with special attention of the balanced occlusion is the key for long – term high survival rate of the prosthetic reconstructions which appears to be of higher value than the type of the support of the fixed prosthetic reconstruction itself.

25|$|A CNC wood router is a {{computer}} controlled machine to which the router or spindle mounts. The CNC Machine can be either a moving gantry style, where the table is fixed and the router spindle moves over it, or <b>fixed</b> <b>bridge</b> design, where the table moves underneath the router spindle. CAD/CAM software programming is used to model the part {{that is to be}} created in the computer and then create a tool path for the machine to follow to cut out the part. The CNC moves along three axes (X-Y-Z). Most CNC routers have a three motor drive system utilizing either servo or stepper motors. More advanced routers use a four motor system for added speed and accuracy.|$|E
25|$|While {{the concept}} has been {{suggested}} {{in a number of}} cases, the only example in the world of a drop lock that has actually been constructed is at Dalmuir on the Forth and Clyde Canal in Scotland. This lock, of the single chamber type, was incorporated during the restoration of the canal, to allow the replacement of a swing bridge (on a busy A road) by a <b>fixed</b> <b>bridge,</b> and so answer criticisms that the restoration of the canal would cause frequent interruptions of the heavy road traffic. It can be emptied by pumping – but as this uses a lot of electricity the method used when water supplies are adequate is to drain the lock to a nearby burn. A series of pictures showing the operation of the lock can be seen here.|$|E
500|$|The {{bridge was}} {{designed}} with a movable floating pontoon. [...] Steel transition spans connect the two {{ends of the}} <b>fixed</b> <b>bridge</b> to the pontoon. Two hydraulic rams, located {{on either side of}} the transition spans, lift the transition spans off the pontoon allowing the pontoon to retract under the <b>fixed</b> <b>bridge.</b> [...] The transition spans accommodate [...] of tide movement and [...] of pontoon movement. [...] In addition, the spans sit on a central pivot that assists with the movement caused by waves. [...] In the event that the transition spans are unable to bear the stress of movement of the pontoon, specifically in the case of seismic activity, the bridge has a breakaway feature that can be easily repaired.|$|E
40|$|Aim This paper {{deals with}} the {{treatment}} of an atrophied toothless mandible with a <b>fixing</b> <b>bridge</b> carried by two non-standard implant systems. Methodology Four bicortical screws were implanted into the frontal part of the mandible and one implant on each side was placed into the distal area of the mandible as a support for a <b>fixing</b> <b>bridge.</b> Results During the years 2002 – 2007 the authors placed a total of 256 bicortical screw and 84 blade implants. During this period only four bicortical screws and one blade implant failed. The primary and secondary surgical success rate was therefore above 98 %, while the prosthetic success rate was 100 %. (Bridges {{which had to be}} re-fabricated due to implant failure were not taken into account.)

500|$|The {{condition}} of the swing bridge at Bathpool caused a change in policy. There were objections to the plan {{to replace it with}} a <b>fixed</b> <b>bridge</b> with limited headroom, and the planning application was deferred. By 1983, a six-year plan to restore the canal was fully costed, and it was adopted by the British Waterways Board, the County Council, Sedgemoor District Council and Taunton Deane Borough Council in the following year. The scheme was supported by the West Country Branch of the Inland Waterways Association, who offered the services of the Waterway Recovery Group, to do some of the work. The swing bridges at Crossways, Boat and Anchor, and Fordgate were rebuilt, and by 1987, [...] of canal were available for navigation. After some teething problems, it was decided that many {{of the rest of the}} accommodation bridges would be raised to give [...] of headroom, rather than rebuilding them as swing bridges. Restoration of the bridges at the Taunton end continued during the early 1990s, and the canal was finally re-opened in 1994.|$|E
