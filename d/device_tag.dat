To overcome these problems a RFID based wireless information and safety system has been developed at Central Institute of Mining and Fuel Research, Dhanbad, India. The hardware components of the system are ZigBee-compliant active radio frequency identification (RFID) devices / transceivers. The devices can be programmed to act as end <b>device</b> (<b>tag),</b> router or coordinator {{that enables them to}} form an IEEE 802. 15. 4 -based mesh network. It uses a unified wireless mesh-networking infrastructure to locate, trace and manage mobile assets and people as well as monitor different environmental conditions using sensors. The associated software has been developed for tracking of underground miners and moveable equipment by wireless sensor networking in mines. The paper describes the developed system and its applications. 1...|$|E
40|$|M. A. (Public Management and Governance) The South African {{road system}} is {{managed by the}} South African National Roads Agency Limited (SANRAL), which is an agency under the Department of Transport. The main aim of SANRAL is to connect major cities, towns and {{emerging}} villages. It has undertaken a project of upgrading and expanding of the road network in the Gauteng Province of South Africa, known as the e-tolling system. It allows for the free flow Electronic Tolling (E-Toll) system and records all vehicles passing through the tollgate without requiring them to stop or slow. A built-in <b>device</b> (<b>tag)</b> is fitted into the overhead gantry system to detect the passing vehicle, which reads an e-tag (if fitted), as well as recording the number plate of the vehicle. A fee for using the road will be charged and paid later from a registered e-toll account, linked to the vehicle user or if no e-tag is present a bill is submitted to the owner. The primary issue associated with the project relates to complaints from various interest groups, political parties and civic organisations regarding public participation in the planning and execution of e-tolling. This has resulted in mass marches and court cases, with the project, consequently undergoing delays, suspension and postponements. The study is, thus, motivated by the foregoing factors in endeavouring to assess {{the effectiveness of the}} public participation process in the initial stages of the e-tolling project. The research utilised an exploratory case study method; comprehensively appraising the public participation areas within the e-tolling project of Gauteng. The study employed both documentation reviews and interviews as data collection methods. The research design was predominantly qualitative, however data analysis was undertaken and presented in both qualitative and quantitative evaluations [...] ...|$|E
40|$|The higher {{mountains}} of the Alps {{focus in the}} western part of Europe and favor a high concentration of glaciers in this area. The Aosta Valley region is surrounded by mountains, more than the 50 % of its territory lying above 2000 m a. s. l. In the summer, most of the water supply of the region relies on the contribution given by snowmelt and, partially, by ice melt. Study of glacial processes is thus very important in this region. In this context the MALATRÀ project (led by Fondazione Montagna Sicura and Envisens Technologies) is created to develop a low-cost instrumentation capable of measuring with continuity the physical parameters of snow and ice. The instrumentation consists of a miniaturized electronic <b>device</b> (<b>tag)</b> equipped with sensors and placed inside an ovoidal small-dimension (48 mm diameter and 180 mm length) plastic capsule. Moreover, the implementation of radio frequency identification technology (RFID) allows remote communication from the surface with the tags placed deep into the glacier, thus saving time, effort and cost in collecting data. Tags allow communication at long distance working at 315 MHz frequency. At this step, the goal is to use such devices during the annual glaciological campaigns to measure the weight of the snowpack above the tag (with a pressure sensor), in order to derive the snow water equivalent (SWE) and temperature inside the ice. As a first step, the capsules will be coupled with ablation stakes installed in the ice, placed at the bottom of boreholes. Each capsule is uniquely identified by a code and can be located in a 3 -D local system via radio using a localization algorithm under development. It is then, during the installation, georeferenced absolutely using a GNSS receiver. This functionality also allows for the glacier displacement measurements. Once the device has been identified, all the data stored in the internal memory can be remotely downloaded from the reader. At the current development stage the board is equipped with a precise thermometer (PT 1000) and a pressure sensor to catch ice data, a magnetometer and a tri-axial accelerometer sensor to study the movement of the capsule within the ice. The performance of the system has been tested in the glacial environment with excellent results...|$|E

30|$|Radio {{frequency}} identification (RFID) {{is known}} in the commercial sectors. Passive or semi-passive <b>tag</b> <b>devices</b> are used in RFID to modulate the radiated RF carrier signals in the wave propagation channel, in which the reader can demodulate the tag’s specific data [1]. The wireless communication approach avoids using an active transmitter in the <b>tag</b> <b>device</b> for power and space savings. By including a sensory data source in the <b>tag</b> <b>device,</b> real-time sensing and data transmission become feasible for applications in the wireless sensor network (WSN) [2 – 4]. An innovative implementation is for data-intensive applications such as video streaming using the semi-passive devices. The importance is that the power associated with the transmitter task can be eliminated from the <b>tag</b> <b>device.</b> This permits cost, space, and power saving for semi-passive devices for guaranteed longevity with the available power resources. It is also possible to use the ambient signals from radio stations for the backscatter communications; the ambient signals are used to illuminate the <b>tag</b> <b>device</b> instead of the reader’s transmitter [5 – 7]. Considering high data rate communication for data-intensive applications, we target hardening the communication channel with a semi-passive <b>tag</b> <b>device</b> in the multipath fading channels.|$|R

30|$|Backscatter {{communication}} is a radar {{approach that is}} different from one-way wireless communication in which the wave propagation channel observes two distinct paths. In the forward path, the RF carrier is emitted from the transmitter and has no information. In the return path, the <b>tag</b> <b>device</b> modulates the <b>tag’s</b> antenna impedance that appeared as a variable radar cross section (RCS) [8]. The backward channel includes the tag-specific information in the form of amplitude or phase modulation of the radiated carrier. The remote receiver decodes the tag antenna reflections and extracts the tag’s data [9]. The modulation level is determined by the number of the loads used in the <b>tag</b> <b>device</b> for switching among [10]. Thus, ultra-low power tag becomes feasible thanks to using an ultra-low power switch device instead of an active transmitter with the power-hungry frontend. The communication link performance can be calculated using Radar equations.|$|R

This paper describes the hyperspeed signaling paradigm, which can endow a network administrator with Flash-like superpowers. Hyperspeed signaling uses optimal (hyperspeed) paths to transmit high priority traffic while other traffic is sent along suboptimal (slower) paths. Slowing the traffic ever so slightly enables the faster command and control messages to implement sophisticated network defense mechanisms.
