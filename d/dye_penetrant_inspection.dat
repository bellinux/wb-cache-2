40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} method to {{indicate}} potential problems when planning <b>dye</b> <b>penetrant</b> and x-ray <b>inspection</b> of welded components. Inspection {{has been found to}} be an important part of the manufacturability evaluation made in a large CAD-based parametric environment for making multidisciplinary design simulations in early stages of design at an aircraft component manufacturer. The paper explains how the proposed method is to be included in the design platform at the company. It predicts the expected probability of detection of cracks (POD) in situations where the geometry of the parts is unfavourable for inspection so that potential problems can be discovered and solved in early stages. It is based on automatically extracting information from CAD-models and making a rule-based evaluation. It also provides a scale for how favourable the geometry is for inspection. In the paper it is also shown that the manufacturability evaluation need to take into consideration the expected stresses in the structures, highlighting the importance of multi-disciplinary simulations...|$|R
50|$|Manufacturers and {{operators}} of aircraft have a financial interest in ensuring that the inspection schedule is as cost-efficient as possible. Because aircraft are often revenue producing, {{there is an opportunity}} cost associated with the maintenance of the aircraft (lost ticket revenue), in addition to the cost of maintenance itself. Thus, this maintenance is desired to be performed infrequently, even when such increased intervals cause increased complexity and cost to the overhaul. Crack growth, as shown by fracture mechanics, is exponential in nature; meaning that the crack growth rate is a function of an exponent of the current crack size (see Paris' law). A desire for infrequent inspection intervals, combined with the exponential growth of cracks in structure has {{led to the development of}} non-destructive testing methods which allow inspectors to look for very tiny cracks which are often invisible to the naked eye. Examples of this technology include eddy current, ultrasonic, <b>dye</b> <b>penetrant,</b> and X-ray <b>inspections.</b> By catching structural cracks when they are very small, and growing slowly, these non-destructive inspections can reduce the amount of maintenance checks, and allow damage to be caught when it is small, and still inexpensive to repair.|$|R

50|$|<b>Dye</b> <b>{{penetrant}}</b> <b>inspection</b> (DPI), {{also called}} liquid penetrant inspection (LPI) or penetrant testing (PT), {{is a widely}} applied and low-cost inspection method used to locate surface-breaking defects in all non-porous materials (metals, plastics, or ceramics). The penetrant may be applied to all non-ferrous materials and ferrous materials, although for ferrous components magnetic-particle inspection is often used instead for its subsurface detection capability. LPI is used to detect casting, forging and welding surface defects such as hairline cracks, surface porosity, leaks in new products, and fatigue cracks on in-service components.|$|E
50|$|Non-destructive {{examination}} (NDE) or {{nondestructive testing}} (NDT) {{is a family}} of technologies used during inspection to analyze materials, components and products for either inherent defects (such as fractures or cracks), or service induced defects (damage from use). Some common methods are visual, industrial computed tomography scanning, microscopy, <b>dye</b> <b>penetrant</b> <b>inspection,</b> magnetic-particle inspection, X-ray or radiographic testing, ultrasonic testing, eddy-current testing, acoustic emission testing, and thermographic inspection. In addition, many non-destructive inspections can be performed by a precision scale, or when in motion, a checkweigher.

40|$|Liquid <b>penetrant</b> <b>inspection</b> {{is one of}} {{the most}} widely applied {{nondestructive}} inspection processes and thus is a major source of confidence in the structural integrity of engineering systems in our society. The simplicity, broad applicability and low cost of liquid <b>penetrant</b> <b>inspection</b> enables and encourages use by workers with expertise ranging from knowledgeable and skilled, to unknowledgeable and unskilled. Although the results should not be expected to be the same, there is a natural tendency to assume equal capabilities and to assume that variations in the process will not significantly affect results.

40|$|This {{research}} {{focused on}} the microstructural characterization and failure analysis of hip implant components. The main hip components analyzed were the femoral heads and the ultra-high molecular weight polyethylene (UHMWPE) liners. Previous {{research has shown that}} hip implants tend to fail by the PE liners due to adhesive and abrasive wear, delamination, and third body particles (metals, ceramics, and PE). The methods and procedures for analyzing the said failures consisted of non-destructive and destructive evaluations. Non-destructive evaluations included of techniques such as visual characterization and <b>dye</b> <b>penetrant</b> <b>inspection</b> (DPI) —which displayed macroscopic surface details and presented initial clues as to the extent and causes of the failures. The use of attenuated total reflection infrared spectroscopy (ATR-IR) produced transmittance spectra for the PE liners to indicate the bonds and their associated wavelength energies. The destructive evaluations included metallography and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). These techniques revealed the microstructural characteristics of the metallic components and focused on microscopic cracks and abrasions from areas of delamination and adhesion in the samples. After further studies and analyses on the failed implants, the information and data shall be given to the collaborating orthopedic surgery group in hopes of altering new components to ensure increased implant lifetimes and less needed revision surgeries for hip replacement patients. ...|$|E

40|$|Two cracked NLG brackets; one in {{finished}} {{condition and}} the other in semi-finished condition, were sent to the laboratory for analysis. Cracks were noticed in the components during <b>dye</b> <b>penetrant</b> <b>inspection.</b> It was established that the cracks were resulted during heat treatment of the semi-finished components. Hence, study was undertaken to establish first whether or not there were any problems in the material or in heat treatment procedure. Microstructural and fractographic examination confirmed that there were no abnormalities in the material. Based on the microstructural study, the possibility of overheating during heat treatment was also ruled out. However, analysis of the failure, in general, indicated that most probably, the cracking of the NLG brackets occurred due to differential stresses that got developed in different sections of the components during quenching process. Because of the shape, varying thickness and extra material left in the component after semi-finishing operation, some of the fillet regions were found to be vulnerable for crack generation during quenching operation. Analysis also shows that such heat treatment cracking in the NLG brackets in its present form is probably unavoidable. In view of this, it is recommended that suitable modification be made in the design so that the fabrication problems encountered currently can be avoided...|$|E
40|$|The {{acoustic}} emission (AE) {{phenomenon has}} many attributes {{that make it}} desirable as a structural health monitoring or non-destructive testing technique, including the capability to continuously and globally monitor large structures using a sparse sensor array and with no dependency on defect size. However, AE monitoring is yet to fulfil its true potential, due mainly to limitations in location accuracy and signal characterisation that often arise in complex structures {{with high levels of}} background noise. Furthermore, the technique has been criticised for a lack of quantitative results and the large amount of operator interpretation required during data analysis. This paper begins by introducing the challenges faced in developing an AE based structural health monitoring system and then gives a review of previous progress made in addresing these challenges. Subsequently an overview of a novel methodology for automatic detection of fatigue fractures in complex geometries and noisy environments is presented, which combines a number of signal processing techniques to address the current limitations of AE monitoring. The technique was developed for monitoring metallic landing gear components during pre-flight certification testing and results are presented from a full-scale steel landing gear component undergoing fatigue loading.

40|$|Cracks {{and other}} defects in ceramic {{materials}} {{can be difficult}} or impossible to examine and photograph due to the extreme lack of contrast. A method for inspecting translucent ceramics using scattered light, also known as vicinal illumination, will be described. This method has been known in the ceramics industry for quite some time, but is not {{well known in the}} testing and failure analysis community. Electronics applications include substrates, packages, multilayer capacitors, and thin film resistors. Ceramic materials are used in electronic applications as microcircuit packages and substrates which carry signals and power between microcircuits. Fine cracks in ceramic materials can result in mechanical failures, electrical failures, and loss of hermeticity. Often, fine cracks are difficult or impossible to detect using standard nondestructive inspection techniques such as visual inspection, ultrasonic inspection, or vapor crack detection. <b>Dye</b> <b>penetrant</b> <b>inspection</b> is usually effective, but contaminates the part, which is unacceptable for space flight hardware. One effective nondestructive inspection method of detecting cracks involves examining the way in which light scatters through the ceramic material when viewed with a standard bright field reflected light microscope. This method, termed vicinal illumination, has been used for detecting cracks during failure analyses of several part types, and screening of space flight hardware. The technique has proven effective on several different types of ceramic materials as well.
