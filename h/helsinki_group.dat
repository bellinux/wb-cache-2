5|$|In {{the opinion}} of the Moscow <b>Helsinki</b> <b>Group</b> {{chairwoman}} Lyudmila Alexeyeva, the attribution of a mental illness to a prominent figure who came out with a political declaration or action is the most significant factor in the assessment of psychiatry during the 1960–1980s. The practice of forced confinement of political dissidents in psychiatric facilities in the former USSR and Eastern Europe destroyed the credibility of psychiatric practice in these countries. When psychiatric profession is discredited {{in one part of the}} world, psychiatry is discredited throughout the world. Psychiatry lost its professional basis entirely with its abuse to stifle dissidence in the former USSR and in the so-called euthanasia program in Nazi Germany. There is little doubt that the capacity for using psychiatry to enforce social norms and even political interests is immense. Now psychiatry is vulnerable because many of its notions have been questioned, and the sustainable pattern of mental life, of boundaries of mental norm and abnormality has been lost, director of the Moscow Research Institute for Psychiatry Valery Krasnov says, adding that psychiatrists have to seek new reference points to make clinical assessments and new reference points to justify old therapeutical interventions.|$|E

25|$|In later issues, the Chronicle also {{included}} summaries of other samizdat bulletins, {{such as the}} Information Bulletins of the dissident civic group Working Commission to Investigate the Use of Psychiatry for Political Purposes, and the documents of the Moscow <b>Helsinki</b> <b>Group.</b>|$|E
50|$|Materials {{provided}} by the <b>Helsinki</b> <b>groups</b> were used at the follow-up Belgrade conference on verification of the Helsinki accords on 4 October 1977. The conference became the first international meeting on a governmental level in which the Soviet Union was accused of human rights violations. In January 1979, the Commission on Security and Cooperation in Europe nominated the <b>Helsinki</b> <b>Groups</b> of the Soviet Union for the Nobel Peace Prize.|$|R
25|$|Although he was {{frequently}} harassed and occasionally arrested for his dissidence, {{for a long}} time Gamsakhurdia avoided serious punishment, probably {{as a result of his}} family's prestige and political connections. His luck ran out in 1977 when the activities of the <b>Helsinki</b> <b>Groups</b> in the Soviet Union became a serious embarrassment to the Soviet government of Leonid Brezhnev. A nationwide crackdown on human rights activists was instigated across the Soviet Union and members of the <b>Helsinki</b> <b>Groups</b> in Moscow, Lithuania, Ukraine, Armenia and Georgia were arrested.|$|R
50|$|As the <b>Helsinki</b> <b>groups</b> were forming {{inside the}} USSR, the Worker's Defense Committee {{was founded in}} Poland in September 1976. Quickly following, on 1 January 1977, Charter 77 was {{established}} in Czechoslovakia. Although not labeled “Helsinki”, these groups focused on human rights issues and the accountability of their respective State constitutions and signatures on the Helsinki Accords. In September 1979 the <b>Helsinki</b> Watch <b>Group</b> was formed, and other Helsinki-labeled watchdog organizations were created throughout the thirty-five signatory States of the Helsinki Accords.|$|R
25|$|In 1976, {{the ongoing}} Lebanese Civil War led Israel to allow South Lebanese {{to cross the}} border and work in Israel. In January 1977, French {{authorities}} arrested Abu Daoud, the planner of the Munich massacre, releasing him a few days later. In March 1977 Anatoly Sharansky, a prominent Refusenik and spokesman for the Moscow <b>Helsinki</b> <b>Group,</b> was sentenced to 13 years' hard labour.|$|E
25|$|Sharansky {{was denied}} an exit visa to Israel in 1973. The reason given for {{denial of the}} visa {{was that he had}} been given access, at some point in his career, to {{information}} vital to Soviet national security and could not now be allowed to leave. After becoming a refusenik, Sharansky became a human rights activist, working as a translator for dissident and nuclear physicist Andrei Sakharov, and spokesman for the Moscow <b>Helsinki</b> <b>Group</b> and a leader for the rights of refuseniks.|$|E
25|$|In 1973 he co-founded the Georgian Action Group for the Defense of Human Rights (four {{years earlier}} a Moscow-based group {{of that name}} sent {{an appeal to the}} UN Human Rights Committee); in 1974 he became the first Georgian member of Amnesty International; and in 1976 he co-founded and became {{chairman}} of the Georgian <b>Helsinki</b> <b>Group.</b> He was also active in the underground network of samizdat publishers, contributing {{to a wide variety of}} underground political periodicals: among them were Okros Satsmisi ("The Golden Fleece"), Sakartvelos Moambe ("The Georgian Herald"), Sakartvelo ("Georgia"), Matiane ("Annals") and Vestnik Gruzii. He contributed to the Moscow-based underground periodical Chronicle of Current Events (April 1968-December 1982). Gamsakhurdia was also the first Georgian member of the International Society for Human Rights (ISHR-IGFM).|$|E
50|$|During the 1970s the Moscow and the Ukrainian <b>Helsinki</b> <b>Groups</b> {{managed to}} recruit new members {{after an initial}} wave of arrests.

5000|$|Human {{rights activist}} Sergei Grigoryants, {{founder of the}} Glasnost periodical, was {{particularly}} scathing. Instead of the heroic and sacrificial traditions of the original <b>Helsinki</b> <b>Groups,</b> the re-established body was an intelligentsia-oriented elite club, forgotten by all. In 2001 he described it as [...] "the most servile and pro-government" [...] among NGOs then existing in Russia.|$|R
25|$|He {{was imprisoned}} another time for being {{involved}} in Ukrainian separatist movements and affiliated publications in 1972. This time Chornovil was given six years of imprisonment and three more years of exile. His term he spent in Mordva camps for political prisoners in the villages of Ozernoye and Barashevo. Half of his term Chornovil spent in a penalized isolation cell and a room of cell type (PKT). Chornovil renounced his Soviet citizenship and {{decided to move to}} Canada in 1975, but was not permitted to do so. He joined the Ukrainian <b>Helsinki</b> <b>Group,</b> which helped to monitor and enforce the 1975 Helsinki Accords. In 1978 by train Chornovil was exiled to the village of Chappandu (Yakutia) where he worked as a laborer at a local state farm (sovkhoz), later as a supplier in Nyurba. In 1978 he was admitted to the International PEN society.|$|E

2500|$|Bonner {{became a}} {{founding}} member of the Moscow <b>Helsinki</b> <b>Group</b> in 1976. When in January 1980 Sakharov was exiled to Gorky, a city closed to foreigners, the harassed and publicly denounced Bonner became his lifeline, traveling between Gorky and Moscow to bring out his writings. Her arrest in April 1984 for [...] "anti-Soviet agitation and propaganda" [...] and sentence to five years of exile in Gorky disrupted their lives again. Sakharov’s several long and painful hunger strikes forced the new Soviet leader, Mikhail Gorbachev to let her travel to the U.S. in 1985 for sextuple bypass heart surgery. Prior to that, in 1981, Bonner and Sakharov went on a dangerous but ultimately successful hunger strike to get Soviet officials to allow their daughter-in-law, Yelizaveta Konstantinovna ("Lisa") Alexeyeva, an exit visa to join her husband, Bonner's son Alexei Semyonov, in the United States.|$|E
