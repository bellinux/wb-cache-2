5|$|As was {{the case}} with most of his works, Etty did not give the {{painting}} a title. It was initially exhibited as A Composition, taken from the Eleventh Book of Milton's Paradise Lost, and was referred to by Etty himself as The Bevy of Fair Women and The Origin of Marriage. By 1862, when it was shown at the <b>International</b> <b>Exhibition,</b> it had acquired its present title.|$|E
5|$|Nevertheless, Meyerbeer's {{last years}} saw the {{composition}} of {{a good deal of}} non-operatic music, including a Coronation March for William I of Prussia, (1861), an overture for the 1862 <b>International</b> <b>Exhibition</b> in London, and incidental music (now lost) to 's play La jeunesse de Goethe (1860). He composed a few settings of liturgical material, including one of the 91st Psalm (1853); and also choral works for the synagogue at Paris.|$|E

5|$|As both {{scientists}} discovered thallium {{independently and}} {{a large part of}} the work, especially the isolation of the metallic thallium was done by Lamy, Crookes tried to secure his priority on the work. Lamy was awarded a medal at the <b>International</b> <b>Exhibition</b> in London 1862: For the discovery of a new and abundant source of thallium and after heavy protest Crookes also received a medal: thallium, for the discovery of the new element. The controversy between both scientists continued through 1862 and 1863. Most of the discussion ended after Crookes was elected Fellow of the Royal Society in June 1863.|$|E
5|$|During 1920 and 1921 Laura met, {{and painted}} backstage, {{some of the}} most famous ballet dancers of the day from Sergei Diaghilev's Ballets Russes. Her {{subjects}} included Lydia Lopokova, Anna Pavlova and the dance teacher Enrico Cecchetti. Knight also painted backstage, and in the dressing rooms, at several Birmingham Repertory Theatre productions. In the early 1920s Knight bought Sir George Clausen's printing press and began etching. She produced 90 prints between 1923 and 1925, including a poster advertising tram travel to Twickenham for London Transport. In 1922 Knight made her first trip to America, where she served on the jury at the Pittsburgh <b>International</b> <b>Exhibition</b> of Pictures.|$|E

5|$|From a {{population}} of about 330,000 in 1901, Bristol grew steadily during the 20th century, peaking at 428,089 in 1971. Its Avonmouth docklands were enlarged during the early 1900s by the Royal Edward Dock. Another new dock, the Royal Portbury Dock, opened across the river from Avonmouth during the 1970s. As air travel grew {{in the first half of}} the century, aircraft manufacturers built factories. The unsuccessful Bristol <b>International</b> <b>Exhibition</b> was held on Ashton Meadows in the Bower Ashton area in 1914. After the premature closure of the exhibition the site was used, until 1919, as barracks for the Gloucestershire Regiment during World War I.|$|E
5|$|Neild {{began to}} {{encounter}} difficulties in {{his political career}} {{towards the end of}} the 1880s; his oversight of the establishment of the 1887 Adelaide Jubilee <b>International</b> <b>Exhibition</b> led to investigation by a Legislative Assembly select committee, which absolved him of accusations of extravagance and using his office for personal gain. In 1895 he began to agitate for old-age pensions, but in 1899 he was investigated again after Premier George Reid paid him £350 for writing a report; although Neild repaid the money, the incident was part of the pretext for a successful no confidence motion in September which brought down the Reid government.|$|E
5|$|The Ashford Green Corridor is {{a linear}} park {{alongside}} {{the two main}} rivers through the town, which is protected from development by lying on the main flood plain. Most of the area covered by the park {{has been marked by}} Ashford Borough Council as a nature reserve. This area includes Victoria Park, which lies to the immediate south of the town centre and the railway. It includes an ornate fountain first shown at the 2nd <b>International</b> <b>Exhibition</b> in London in 1862, and presented to the park by George Harper on 24 July 1912. The Coningbrook Lakes Country Park opened on a former quarry site to the northeast of town in 2015.|$|E

5|$|There {{are some}} criticisms of van Kinsbergen's photographs. He missed some details and {{sometimes}} his series was unbalanced. Trained as an artist, his works lacked archaeological descriptions, {{the main purpose}} of his contract. The printing quality, however, is beyond question and he had success showing the beauty of classical Javanese arts. His photographs were shown to the public both in the 1873 <b>International</b> <b>Exhibition</b> in Vienna and the 1878 World Exhibition in Paris. His works can be seen in several places, including the National Museum in Amsterdam.|$|E
5|$|Although {{working within}} the Neo-Gothic school of design, they {{differed}} from Neo-Gothic architects like Gilbert Scott who simply included certain Gothic features on modern styles of building; instead they sought to return completely to Medieval Gothic methods of craftmanship. The products created by the Firm included furniture, architectural carving, metalwork, stained glass windows, and murals. Their stained glass windows proved a particular success in the firm's early years {{as they were in}} high demand for the surge in the Neo-Gothic construction and refurbishment of churches, many of which were commissioned by the architect George Frederick Bodley. Despite Morris's anti-elitist ethos, the Firm soon became increasingly popular and fashionable with the bourgeoisie, particularly following their exhibit at the 1862 <b>International</b> <b>Exhibition</b> in South Kensington, where they received press attention and medals of commendation. However, they faced much opposition from established design companies, particularly those belonging to the Neo-Classical school.|$|E
5|$|Another {{work from}} this time is The Green Feather, which Knight painted, and {{reworked}} due {{to a change in}} the weather, outdoors in a single day and shows the model Dolly Snell in an emerald evening dress with a hat and a large feather. Knight sent the painting to an <b>international</b> <b>exhibition</b> held at the Carnegie Institute in Pittsburgh and it was purchased by the National Gallery of Canada for £400. Knight started the vast painting Lamorna Birch and his Daughters in 1913, painting in a wood in the Lamorna Valley but then kept the painting unfinished in her studio until finally completing it in 1934, the same year Birch was elected a full member of the Royal Academy.|$|E

5|$|As {{a person}} of {{multiple}} talents, Siddiqui was also a refined poet, musician, and a painter. In August 1924, he held his first <b>international</b> <b>exhibition</b> of paintings in Frankfurt. Later in 1927, his works of art were exhibited at the Uzielli Gallery, Frankfurt. During his stay in Germany, he also translated Rainer Maria Rilke's poetry into Urdu, {{which was published in}} the journal of Jamia Millia Islamia. Though, his passion for arts was superseded by the enthusiasm in scientific research, he continued to patronise arts and culture. In 1966, he was at the forefront for setting up the Central Institute of Arts and Crafts in Karachi. He also compiled a selection of poetry of Mir Taqi Mir into Intekhab-e-Meer. In 1983, he published a portfolio collection of charcoal drawings from 1920 to 1950s.|$|E
5|$|Gaudí's {{reputation}} {{was beginning to}} recover by the 1950s, when his work was championed not only by Salvador Dalí but also by architect Josep Lluís Sert. In 1952, the centenary year of the architect's birth, the Asociación de Amigos de Gaudí (Friends of Gaudí Association) was founded {{with the aim of}} disseminating and conserving his legacy. Four years later, a retrospective was organised at the Saló del Tinell in Barcelona, and the Gaudí Chair at the Polytechnic University of Catalonia was created with the purpose of deepening the study of the Gaudí's works and participating in their conservation. These events were followed in 1957 by Gaudí's first <b>international</b> <b>exhibition,</b> held at the Museum of Modern Art in New York City. In 1976, on the 50th anniversary of his death, the Spanish Ministry of Foreign Affairs organised an exhibition about Gaudí and his works that toured the globe.|$|E
5|$|Many of {{the early}} pieces of furniture, such as the Narcissus Washstand, the Zodiac Settle and the Great Bookcase, were {{originally}} made for Burges's office at Buckingham Street and were later moved to the Tower House. The Great Bookcase was also part of Burges's contribution to the Medieval Court at the 1862 <b>International</b> <b>Exhibition.</b> Later pieces, such as the Crocker Dressing Table and the Golden Bed, and its accompanying Vita Nuova Washstand, were made specifically for the house. John Betjeman located the Narcissus Washstand in a junk shop in Lincoln {{and gave it to}} Evelyn Waugh, a fellow enthusiast for Victorian art and architecture, who featured it in his 1957 novel, The Ordeal of Gilbert Pinfold. Betjeman later gave Waugh both the Zodiac Settle and the Philosophy Cabinet.|$|E

5|$|Sullivan's most {{enduring}} orchestral work, the Overture di Ballo, was composed for the Birmingham Festival in 1870. Also in 1870, Sullivan met Gilbert. 1871 was a busy year for Sullivan. He published his only song cycle, The Window; or, The Songs of the Wrens, to words by Tennyson, {{and he wrote}} {{the first of a}} series of suites of incidental music for West End productions of Shakespeare plays. Still in 1871, Sullivan composed a dramatic cantata, On Shore and Sea, for the opening of the London <b>International</b> <b>Exhibition,</b> and the hymn Onward, Christian Soldiers, with words by Sabine Baring-Gould. The Salvation Army adopted the latter as its favoured processional, and it became Sullivan's {{most enduring}} hymn.|$|E
5|$|In 1939 {{the museum}} began hosting the annual {{exhibitions}} of American Abstract Artists, a group devoted to expanding appreciation of non-objective art {{that had been}} formed in 1936. The show included more than 300 oils, watercolors, pastels, collages, drawings, constructions, and sculpture. That year it also began hosting exhibitions held by the New York Society of Women Artists, a group that had been founded in 1926 to promote the work of avant garde women artists. Other 1939 shows included contemporary works by artists from Poland, documentary photographs of child laborers by Lewis Hine, an <b>international</b> <b>exhibition</b> of works by women artists, and a large display of Pan-American art. Over {{the next few decades}} the museum would specialize in exhibitions by members of artists' groups. In addition to the two already named, these included the Silvermine Guild of Artists (a Connecticut summer art colony), the Manhattan Camera Club, the Photo-Engravers' Art Society, the Brooklyn Society of Artists, the Artists Equity Group, and USCO (a collective from the Woodstock, New York art colony and Garnerville, New York). The museum was organized as a unit of the Master Institute of United Arts. As it had previously done, the institute gave art classes, provided studio space, and sponsored lectures, concerts, poetry readings, art clinics, and other cultural events.|$|E
5|$|On 3 July 1992, Croatia was re-admitted to FIFA, playing {{its first}} {{official}} matches {{in the modern}} era against Australia in Melbourne, Adelaide and Sydney. This team was led by Stanko Poklepović as part of an <b>international</b> <b>exhibition</b> tour; in April 1993, Vlatko Marković was appointed as manager. Croatia finally gained admission into UEFA in June 1993, which was too late for the national team to enter the 1994 FIFA World Cup qualifiers, as these already commenced the year before. Marković only led the team in one match, a home win against Ukraine in June 1993, before being dismissed in February 1994 and replaced by Miroslav Blažević the following month. The team's performances before Croatia's official independence were not recorded by FIFA, so they entered the World Rankings in 125th place. Blažević led Croatia's qualifying campaign for Euro 1996, beginning with the nation's first post-independence competitive victory, a 2–0 win over Estonia on 4 September 1994. Their first competitive defeat came on 11 June 1995 in a 1–0 away loss to Ukraine during the same qualifying campaign. They eventually finished first in their qualifying group and won FIFA's 1994 Best Mover of the Year award as they moved up to 62nd in the rankings {{by the end of the}} year.|$|E
