5|$|Montgomery County, Maryland, {{similarly}} approved {{plans to}} install 20 stations and 200 bikes in the Rockville and Shady Grove areas near Washington Metro stations and <b>high-traffic</b> destinations such as Montgomery College and Rockville Town Center. The expansion {{will be paid}} for by a $1.288 million grant from the National Capital Region Transportation Planning Board with a $688,000 local match. Officials also cited plans to add 50 stations and 400 bicycles in southern areas of the county, including Bethesda, Silver Spring, Friendship Heights, and Takoma Park. However, bicycling advocates cautioned that clusters of stations in the county could be too far from each other as well as the larger network of stations within neighboring Washington, D.C. There was also concern that the county has too few bike lanes and trails to support the expected number of users. Despite these concerns, Montgomery County added its first stations in May 2013.|$|E

5000|$|The IOP {{started out}} strong in 1997, in protest {{to a variety}} of issues across campus {{including}} the requirements all students be required to use Microsoft Windows. The campaign began using the logo of the fork, an inanimate object which is honest and dependable. Soon thereafter, Rob [...] "r0b" [...] Colonna, obtained a seven-foot inflatable whale named Arthur Galpin to serve as their candidate. The IOP is perhaps best known for their satirical posters, which anyone can print out and distribute. In 2002, the IOP protested the beginning of the laptop program at RPI. The IOP posted numerous protest-art fliers and banners at <b>high-trafficked</b> areas around campus: some depicted a check from RPI to Bill Gates, others a degree in [...] "Bachelor of Windows", others simply decried [...] "Unix or Death". According to an IOP bulletin, Arthur was born in 1993, weighs 3.5 pounds, and is [...] "known to carry toast and duct tape".

40|$|At the {{beginning}} of the study, our hypothesis was that visiting certain microenvironments (MEs) {{is one of the most}} important determinants of personal exposure to ultrafine particles (UFP) and that moving between microenvironments significantly differentiates exposure. The overall aim of this study is to perform relevant exposure measurements to extend our knowledge on environmental exposure to UFP in urban environments. The UFP concentrations in different urban MEs were measured by personal monitoring in repeated sampling campaigns along a fixed route. The measurement runs were performed on one-week periods and at different times of day (AM: 08. 00 – 10. 30; PM: 16. 00 – 18. 30) and repeated in different periods of the year (winter, spring, summer, and autumn) for a total of 56 runs (> 110 h). Measurements included on-line monitoring of the UFP particle number concentration (PNC), mean diameter (mean-d) and lung-deposited surface-area (LDSA). Additionally, the PNC, particle mass concentration (PMC) profiles for quasi-ultrafine particles (QUFP; PM 0. 25) were estimated. A significant seasonal difference in the PNC and PMC, mean diameter and surface area was observed as well as between different times of the day and days of the week. In addition, differences in the UFP concentrations were also found in each ME, and there were specific mean-diameter and surface area concentrations. In general, the mean particle diameters showed an inverse relationship with the PNC, while the LDSA had the opposite behaviour. Appreciable differences among all MEs and monitoring periods were observed; the concentration patterns and variations seemed related to the typical sources of urban pollutants (traffic), proximity to sources and time of day. The highest exposures were observed for walking or biking along <b>high-trafficked</b> routes and while using public buses. The UFP exposure levels in modern cars, equipped with high-efficiency filters and in air recirculation mode, were significantly lower...|$|R
25|$|The {{railways}} mostly use {{colour signal}} lights. Earlier the older semaphores and discs-based signalling (depending on the position or colour) were used, {{but these were}} replaced by colour signals. Except for some <b>high-traffic</b> sections around large cities and junctions, the network does not use automatic block systems. However, the signals at stations are almost invariably interlocked with the setting of points (routes) and so safety {{does not depend on}} the skill of the station masters. With the planned introduction of Cab signalling/Anti collision devices the element of risk on account of drivers overshooting signals will also be eliminated.|$|E
25|$|SH 1 has varied road conditions. For most of {{its length}} it is a two-lane single {{carriageway}} road with at-grade intersections and access, sealed with chipseal in rural areas or asphalt in urban and <b>high-traffic</b> areas. The highway has frequent passing lanes on these sections, to allow traffic to pass other vehicles safely. Parts of the road are steep by international standards. Most steep sections having a combination of passing lanes (uphill), and crawler lanes or stopping bays (downhill) to allow heavy and slow vehicles {{to pull out of}} the way to let other vehicles pass.|$|E
25|$|The Southern Pacific Railroad, now the Union Pacific, {{implemented}} DTC {{on several}} of its lines formerly controlled by train orders (most {{of the rest of}} UP's lines use Centralized Traffic Control). The BNSF Railway does not use DTC; it uses mostly CTC with track warrants in its non-signalled territory. The Alaska Railroad changed its Track Warrant Control territory to DTC and is also implementing CTC in <b>high-traffic</b> areas. Queensland Rail in Australia uses the DTC system in some of the lower traffic areas in the western area of the state. CSX uses DTC on their former Georgia railroad mainline from Scottdale, just east of Atlanta, to Augusta.|$|E
25|$|Particulate contaminants, {{including}} pollen, dust, fibers, and soot, may affix {{to objects}} after entering collection areas through poorly maintained ventilation systems. Individuals {{passing through a}} collection area may also have particulates embedded on their clothing or bodies, which can become dislodged thereby becoming an airborne contaminant. Construction or maintenance efforts are another common cause of particulate pollution. Particulates which adhere to collection objects may cause soiling or blemishing, requiring mechanical removal and conservation efforts. These pollutants can be minimized via high quality HVAC systems, regularly replaced filters for vents, and careful placement of objects away from high-risk areas such as designated smoking sections, construction sites, and <b>high-traffic</b> areas such as entryways.|$|E
25|$|All the {{stations}} on the Brown Line and Xinzhuang/Luzhou Lines, {{as well as}} at Taipei Nangang Exhibition Center, are equipped with platform screen doors. <b>High-traffic</b> stations, including Taipei Main Station, Zhongxiao Fuxing, and Taipei City Hall, have platform gates to prevent passengers and other objects from falling onto the rails. For safety reasons, fifteen additional stations will be equipped with these gates in the future (including Ximen, Guting, and Banqiao). All lines and extensions currently under construction will be equipped with platform screen doors. A Track Intrusion Detection System has also been installed to improve passenger safety at stations without platform doors. The system uses infrared and radio detectors to monitor unusual movement in the track area.|$|E
25|$|The {{location}} of the NDCBU in a community or business center is extremely important, since neighborhood cluster box installations located in remote or poorly lighted areas invite large-scale mail theft or vandalism. Even when located in a <b>high-traffic</b> location or inside a gated community, the NDCBU is a tempting target for thieves attracted {{by the possibility of}} recovering checks, cash, identifying information, or other valuables from multiple victims. A 2008 RAND Corporation study, citing USPS statistics collected between 2004 and 2007, found that NDCBU thefts constituted 52.7% of all urban neighborhood mail thefts and 76.6% of all rural neighborhood mail thefts from locations with more than one mailbox, with higher-income ZIP code zones having a substantially higher number of thefts than low-income ZIP code zones.|$|E
25|$|A bus {{rapid transit}} (BRT) system using {{dedicated}} lanes can have a theoretical capacity of 3,600 passengers per hour per direction (30 buses per direction, 120 passengers in articulated buses). BRT is an alternative to LRT, at least if very high capacity is not needed. Using buses, roads can achieve a much higher commuter capacity than is achievable with passenger cars. To have 30 buses per direction an hour, buses must have priority at traffic lights and have their own dedicated lanes. Buses can travel closer to each other than rail vehicles because of better braking capability. However, each bus vehicle requires a single driver, whereas a light rail train may have three to four cars of much larger capacity in one train {{under the control of}} one driver, or no driver at all in fully automated systems, increasing the labor costs of <b>high-traffic</b> BRT systems compared to LRT systems.|$|E
25|$|When {{the council}} rebuffed {{his efforts to}} plant new {{specimens}} within the camp, Kuska contacted the Center for Investigative Reporting {{in the summer of}} 2012. They wrote an article describing the prior council's actions at the camp. Kuska was then informed by lawyers representing the Monterey Bay Area Council that he could only visit the camp under supervision. But in September 2012 they declined to renew his Scouting membership without explanation, effectively expelling him from the organization. Kuska says his membership wasn't renewed because he was a whistle-blower and exposed the Scouts' environmental carelessness. Ron Schoenmehl, director of support services for the council, said that Kuska had been planting lousewort in new, <b>high-traffic</b> areas near the camp's generator, health lodge, and camping area without the Council's permission, which his permit required him to obtain. Since the council is obligated to protect the plant wherever it grows, Schoenmehl said that lousewort in those areas would restrict the camp’s use of those areas.|$|E
25|$|Indianapolis {{continued}} to experience strong growth through the 1960s and 70s, but {{the population of}} Cottage Home and other inner-city neighborhoods was reduced by migration to the suburbs {{in the process of}} urban sprawl. As Cottage Home was within the flood zone of Pogue's Run, residents began to leave for other areas. In addition, I-70/I-65's construction required demolishing homes {{on the west side of}} the neighborhood, leaving it bordered with a <b>high-traffic</b> roadway. By the 1980s, more than 100 houses had been demolished in Cottage Home. A renewed interest in historic restoration and the establishment of the Cottage Home Neighborhood Association (CHNA) in 1984 reversed the demolition trend; the area has since lost only six homes to fire or demolition. CHNA led the effort for the unique neighborhood to be designated as a historic district, achieving addition to the National Register of Historic Places in 1990, the State Register in 1995, and city designation in 2008. Today, while infill has been slow, the neighborhood continues as a vibrant and active community.|$|E

500|$|Since the {{majority}} of the system was built before 1990, the year the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) went into effect, many New York City Subway stations were not designed to be handicapped-accessible. Since then, elevators have been built in newly constructed stations to comply with the ADA. (Most grade-level stations required little modification to meet ADA standards.) In addition, the MTA identified [...] "key stations", <b>high-traffic</b> and/or geographically important stations, which must conform to the ADA when they are extensively renovated. As of January 2017, there are [...] currently accessible stations; many of them have AutoGate access. Under the current MTA plans, the number of ADA accessible stations will go up to 144 by 2020.|$|E
500|$|Other {{difficulties}} street newspapers face include {{high turnover}} of [...] "transient" [...] or unreliable staff, {{lack of adequate}} funding, lack of journalistic freedom for papers that are funded by local government, and, among some demographics, {{lack of interest in}} homeless issues. [...] For example, journalism professor Jim Cunningham has attributed the difficulties in selling Calgary's Calgary Street Talk {{to the fact that the}} mostly middle-class, conservative population has [...] "not enough sensitivity to the causes of homelessness". Finally, anti-homeless legislation often targets street newspapers and vendors; for example, in New York City and Cleveland, laws have prevented vendors from selling papers on public transit or other <b>high-traffic</b> areas, making it difficult for the papers Street News and Homeless Grapevine to earn revenue.|$|E
500|$|The {{three main}} roads—and Upper Lewes Road, which runs between the Ditchling and Lewes Roads—experience heavy traffic, but little through traffic uses the smaller {{residential}} streets such as Roundhill Crescent. [...] Traffic calming measures installed in 2003 have {{acted as a}} deterrent. There are high levels of on-street car parking, though. Union Road and the Vogue Gyratory are also <b>high-traffic</b> routes. The Gyratory, [...] "a fiendish maze of one-way systems, roundabouts and crossings", is {{the point at which}} Upper Lewes Road and Lewes Road meet two other routes. Named after the Vogue—latterly a pornographic cinema—it was built in 1983–84 {{on the site of the}} former Lewes Road viaduct, Cox's Pill Factory and surrounding buildings in connection with a Sainsbury's supermarket development. Demolition of the entire complex of roads was already being advocated in 2007.|$|E
500|$|Art pieces, where present, {{are seldom}} highlighted; they {{primarily}} {{consist of a}} few paintings or sculptures representing the recent past of Singapore, mounted in major stations. The opening of the Woodlands Extension introduced bolder pieces of artwork, such as a 4,000kg sculpture in Woodlands. With {{the opening of the}} North East MRT Line, more series of artworks created under a programme called [...] "The Art In Transit" [...] were commissioned by the Land Transport Authority. Created by 19 local artists and integrated into the stations' interior architecture, these works aim to promote the appreciation of public art in <b>high-traffic</b> environments.
