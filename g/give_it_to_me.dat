To this question Mars said [...] "It definitely sounds awesome. Right? Isn't that what matters? It's an awesome song! I don't know how to tell you that more". In another interview, this time for Rolling Stone, he explained that the track is about [...] "good old animalistic sex". When the interviewer asked if Mars was concerned with the verses [...] "Got a body full of liquor with a cocaine kicker" [...] due to his 2010 drug bust, he replied [...] "To take that line out would dilute my art", since the recording [...] "needs a sense of danger. When I was a kid, pop could be dangerous but still massive. Michael Jackson would grab his crotch. Prince would rock assless chaps".|$|E

500|$|On 25 June 2007, in an {{unexpected}} turn of events, Henry {{was transferred to}} Barcelona for €24million. He signed a four-year deal for a reported €6.8 (£4.6) million per season. It was revealed that the contract included a release clause of €125 (£84.9) million. Henry cited the departure of Dein and continued uncertainty over Wenger's future as reasons for leaving, and maintained that [...] "I always said that if I ever left Arsenal {{it would be to}} play for Barcelona." [...] Despite their captain's departure, Arsenal got off to an impressive start for the 2007–08 campaign, and Henry admitted that his presence in the team might have been more of a hindrance than a help. He stated, [...] "Because of my seniority, the fact that I was captain and my habit of screaming for the ball, they would sometimes <b>give</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> even when I was not in the best position. So in that sense it was good for the team that I moved on." [...] Henry left Arsenal as the club's leading all-time league goalscorer with 174 goals and leading all-time goalscorer in European competitions with 42 goals; in July 2008, Arsenal fans voted him as Arsenal's greatest player ever in Arsenal.com's Gunners' Greatest 50 Players poll.|$|E

2500|$|Easter Sunday - a heavy gunfight in Belfast left a RUC constable dead, {{with six}} IRA members arrested in Cawnpore Street in response. In Dublin, Irish Special Branch {{attempted}} to arrest Lasarian Mangan and Brendan Behan. [...] When Mangan seemed to hesitate in using his gun, Behan was heard to shout [...] "Use it, use it. <b>Give</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> and I will shoot the bastards.". Behan was later arrested in Dublin and received fourteen years in prison. The third {{incident in the}} time line involved Frank Morris, who began shooting when detained at a RUC border checkpoint in Strabane.

2500|$|This moves {{onto another}} track called [...] "You've Changed" [...] that {{features}} her ex bandmates Beyoncé and Michelle Williams. Lyrically the song {{talks about a}} relationship that has gone [...] "awry". Rowland takes prominence on the track, though Beyoncé and Williams each get their [...] "own cathartic verse to go off on a clueless ex". The Honesty Hour compared [...] "You've Changed" [...] to the 2004 Destiny's Child single [...] "Girl". Production on the album then moves on to a light midtempo dance track on [...] "I Remember", which was produced by The Runners. Atop a [...] "tinkling piano and propulsive dance beat", Rowland's [...] "characteristically soulful vocals" [...] can be heard. Hampp said that the song incorporated tribal music and a vibe that [...] "consciously stops short of being a full-on four-on-the-floor banger." [...] According to the Honesty Hour, [...] "I Remember" [...] remains firmly a ballad, but incorporates elements of techno and EDM. Rowland dabbles in some 80's funk pop on the Boi-1da and Matthew Burnett-produced [...] "Red Wine". The song features dreamy synths and a soaring chorus, in a vintage throwback. It was compared to songs by Brandy Norwood. The pace continues on the romantic [...] "This is Love" [...] which focuses on a guy that [...] "got [...] goin’ on cloud 9". Over the light production, Rowland sings [...] "I’m waiting and anticipating for you to <b>give</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> / Boy I’m trying to hold it inside / Heart racing, my body shaking / ‘Cause when you <b>give</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> boy you are the truth, I can’t lie." [...] According to the Honesty Hour, [...] "This is Love" [...] had crossover appear for both R and pop radio.|$|E
2500|$|Featuring the {{portrait}} of an individual on a coin, which became legal in 44 BC, caused the coin {{to be viewed as}} embodying the attributes of the individual portrayed. Dio wrote that following the death of Caligula the Senate demonetized his coinage, and ordered that they be melted. Regardless of whether or not this actually occurred, it demonstrates the importance and meaning that was attached to the imagery on a coin. The philosopher Epictetus jokingly wrote: [...] "Whose image does this sestertius carry? Trajan's? <b>Give</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>me.</b> Nero's? Throw it away, it is unacceptable, it is rotten." [...] Although the writer did not seriously expect people to get rid of their coins, this quotation demonstrates that the Romans attached a moral value to the images on their coins. Unlike the obverse, which during the imperial period almost always featured a portrait, the reverse was far more varied in its depiction. During the late Republic there were often political messages to the imagery, especially during the periods of civil war. However, {{by the middle of the}} Empire, although there were types that made important statements, and some that were overtly political or propagandistic in nature, the majority of the types were stock images of personifications or deities. While some images can be related to the policy or actions of a particular emperor, many of the choices seem arbitrary and the personifications and deities were so prosaic that their names were often omitted, as they were readily recognizable by their appearance and attributes alone.|$|E
2500|$|After {{collaborating with}} American female rapper Nicki Minaj on the song [...] "I'm Legit" [...] for Minaj's album , Minaj agreed {{to appear on}} Ciara's album in return. Originally, the duo had worked on just one {{collaboration}} for Ciara called [...] "I'm Out". Speaking about Minaj's version on the song, Ciara said [...] "The energy of the record is so dope, and it's really for the ladies, and Nicki she just killed the verse. She literally murdered it, like she got that throw-back, that thing that she does that's so special. She went in." [...] Having enjoyed the process Minaj said [...] "I was supposed to only do one song for her album and I think I'm {{going to end up}} doing two. I just love what she's doing and I'm so proud and I'm really excited for people to hear it." [...] In April, Ciara confirmed that Minaj was finished with a second record for the album; in an interview with MTV News, Ciara said, [...] "She's actually finishing up one now that's really it's a monster too. The moments that we have had so far have just been crazy. It's just been magical, it's been something special and I feel like the fans have always wanted to see she and I rock together." [...] In the end, Minaj also recorded vocals for the aforementioned [...] "Livin' It Up". On June 23, 2013, rapper, Future confirmed that the track, [...] "Where You Go", was originally recorded for his second studio album, Future Hendrix (2013); however, he gave it to Ciara, stating, [...] "She's like, 'I need this song. It just seems like it was just speaking to me. <b>Give</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> give it to me.' I was like, 'Man cool, you can have it." ...|$|E
