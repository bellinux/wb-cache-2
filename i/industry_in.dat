The textile <b>industry</b> <b>in</b> Trafford could not compete with that in places such as Manchester, Oldham, and Ashton-under-Lyne, partly because of a reluctance to invest in industry on the part of the two main land owners in the area: the Stamfords and the de Traffords.|$|E

40|$|With {{entertainment}} as its principle part, {{the cultural}} market {{began to develop}} in the early 1980 s and became {{to be the first}} sign of cultural <b>industries</b> <b>in</b> Shenzhen. Some cultural enterprises developed in the background of the "Spiritual Civilization Construction" from the late 1980 s to the early 1990 s and printing, videos, cultural tourism, animation and cartoon started to grow up in Shenzhen. The government began to pay some attentions to cultural <b>industries</b> <b>in</b> the early 1990 s and the scale of cultural <b>industries</b> <b>in</b> Shenzhen had grown up with the development of some important sectors. In the context of "Famous Modern Cultural City Construction" in the late 1990 s, Shenzhen developed cultural industries further, cultural industries had produced economic benefits properly, the industrial structure had became pluralistic and the cultural industries developed intensively on a large scale, but faced many problems. Cultural <b>industries</b> <b>in</b> Shenzhen has met a new epoch since 2000 because of the implementation of the strategy of "Found the City on a Cultural Basis" and the orientation of cultural industries as the fourth economic support industry, not only both of its competitiveness and general strength and its economic contribution rate has enhanced a lot, but also cultural <b>industries</b> <b>in</b> Shenzhen leads mainland relatively. Some distinguishing features have been taken shape in printing, media, entertainment, cultural tourism, animation and cartoon, advertising, art and crafts, design, even though there are many problems and challenges in these fields. The development of cultural <b>industries</b> <b>in</b> Shenzhen could not do without the Hong Kong factor. Although the ideas of the development of cultural <b>industries</b> are different <b>in</b> Shenzhen and Hong Kong, they could cooperate closely. The "shop in the front and factory at the back" operation model had been and will still be the most practical cooperative model for two sides and printing, design, digital entertainment and cultural entertainment may be the most potential cooperative fields. <b>In</b> Conclusion, cultural <b>industries</b> <b>in</b> Shenzhen is moving from the fringes to the mainstream; cultural <b>industries</b> <b>in</b> Shenzhen had developed in a unique way; the general developmental level of cultural <b>industries</b> <b>in</b> Shenzhen still lags other industries; the development of cultural <b>industries</b> <b>in</b> Shenzhen has not been supported strongly by the whole society; the fundamental contradiction of cultural <b>industries</b> <b>in</b> Shenzhen is between cultural industries' economic attribution and ideological attribution {{and will continue to be}} the context of the development of cultural <b>industries</b> <b>in</b> Shenzhen; the government has controlled the upstream of the cultural industries chain, so the development of cultural <b>industries</b> <b>in</b> Shenzhen must take full advantage of the government resources; cultural <b>industries</b> <b>in</b> Shenzhen should focus on "industries" now; cultural <b>industries</b> <b>in</b> Shenzhen should take the Hong Kong factor seriously and make full use of it. 王為理. 呈交日期: 2005 年 8 月. 論文(哲學博士) [...] 香港中文大學, 2006. 參考文獻(p. 244 - 268).
