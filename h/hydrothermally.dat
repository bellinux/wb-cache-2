5|$|Ash {{generated}} during phreatic eruptions primarily {{consists of}} <b>hydrothermally</b> altered lithic and mineral fragments, commonly in a clay matrix. Particle surfaces are often coated with aggregates of zeolite crystals or clay and only relict textures remain to identify pyroclast types.|$|E
5|$|Isolated {{ridges of}} lava and <b>hydrothermally</b> altered rock, {{especially}} {{in the area of}} Sherman Crater, are exposed between glaciers on the upper flanks of the volcano; the lower flanks are steep and heavily vegetated. Volcanic rocks of Mount Baker and Black Buttes rest on a foundation of non-volcanic rocks.|$|E
5|$|Fumarolic {{activity}} affects {{surrounding rocks}} and pyroclastics. Carbonates, opal, and white covers of possibly aluminum sulfate and calcium sulfate have been formed. Gypsum formed from the sulfur {{of the volcano}} {{is found in the}} form of crystals in the upper valleys of Taftan. Sinter and <b>hydrothermally</b> altered rocks are found farther down. Minerals formed by alteration processes include alunite, calcite, cristobalite, illite, jarosite, kaolinite, pyrophyllite, quartz, smectite, sulfur and tridymite. Some epithermal mineralizations have been identified around Taftan. Other secondary factors at Taftan include lahars.|$|E
5|$|Hydrothermal {{alteration}} {{of the central}} lava dome and iron-bearing deposits has generated alunite, anatase, chlorite, copper veinlets, gypsum, illite, jarosite, labradorite, quartz, rutile, sanidine, smectite, and sulfur. Some of these minerals forms veins inside the rock. Silification is prominent and has formed cristobalite and tridymite. Elemental sulfur is also found. Vast regions of the volcano have been altered <b>hydrothermally</b> at temperatures of , giving the rock a clear appearance. Minor exhalation deposits are {{also found in the}} form of sulfates that sometimes conserve conduits. Red-coloured alteration halos occur in andesites adjacent to iron deposits, probably due to iron input.|$|E
5|$|The felsic shield-building stage {{began with}} the {{eruption}} of phonolite, trachyte, phonolitic trachyte, quartz-trachyte and rhyolite lava. Subsequent volcanism of the pre-explosive phase produced a basal sequence of aphyric trachyte lava flows and domes with minor altered flow-banded rhyolite, sulfide-bearing rhyolitic tuffs and a few thin hawaiite lava flows. This activity was concentrated at {{the summit of the}} volcano as shown by the increasing thickness of volcanic material towards the summit. A <b>hydrothermally</b> altered aphyric trachyte dike, which forms a narrow ridge linking Mount Downton and Itcha Mountain, might have been the source for these eruptions.|$|E
25|$|Ultramafic {{mineralogy}} {{is especially}} susceptible to retrograde metamorphism, especially when water is present. Few komatiite sequences display even pristine metamorphic assembages, with most metamorphic olivine replaced by serpentine, anthophyllite, talc or chlorite. Pyroxene tends to retrogress to actinolite-cummingtonite or chlorite. Chromite may <b>hydrothermally</b> alter to stichtite, and pentlandite may retrogress into millerite or heazlewoodite.|$|E
25|$|The McDougall Brook Granite {{formation}} consists {{mostly of}} porphyritic granite, a borderline feldspar (sometimes quartz) porphyry, and minor amounts of fine-grained quartz monzonite. The grain {{size of the}} porphyry and the size and abundance of feldspar increases inward. Amphibole with apatite is the main mineral phase in {{all three of the}} flows. Parts of the feldspar porphyry are <b>hydrothermally</b> altered. The deposit is extensively exposed, and is colored red on the map.|$|E
25|$|Exposed {{within the}} {{interior}} of the Richat Structure are a variety of intrusive and extrusive igneous rocks. They include rhyolitic volcanic rocks, gabbros, carbonatites and kimberlites. The rhyolitic rocks consist of lava flows and <b>hydrothermally</b> altered tuffaceous rocks that are part of two distinct eruptive centers, which are interpreted to be the eroded remains of two maars. According to field mapping and aeromagnetic data, the gabbroic rocks form two concentric ring dikes. The inner ring dike is about 20m in width and lies about 3km from the center of Richat Structure. The outer ring dike is about 50m in width and lies about 7 to 8km from the center of this structure. Thirty-two carbonatite dikes and sills have been mapped within the Richat Structure. The dikes are generally about 300m long and typically 1 to 4m wide. They consist of massive carbonatites that are mostly devoid of vesicles. The carbonatite rocks have been dated as having cooled between 94 and 104million years ago. A kimberlitic plug and several sills have been found within {{the northern part of the}} Richat Structure. The kimberlite plug has been dated to around 99million years old. These intrusive igneous rocks are interpreted as indicating the presence of a large alkaline igneous intrusion that currently underlies the Richat Structure and created it by uplifting the overlying rock.|$|E
500|$|The studies {{demonstrated}} that the most volcanically and <b>hydrothermally</b> active area was along the southern rift. Dives on the less active northern rim indicated that the terrain was more stable there, and high lava columns were still standing upright.

500|$|Next to {{a heavily}} <b>hydrothermally</b> altered lava dome in {{the centre of}} the caldera lies the Laguna Corona del Inca. This [...] deep and [...] high lake {{measures}} [...] The lake has probably generated the evaporite and lacustrine deposits that lie on the caldera floor. Water temperatures of [...] obtained by satellite measurements suggest that some hydrothermal activity persists. The lake is fed by meltwater.|$|E
500|$|The Incapillo {{ignimbrite}} {{is formed}} by potassium-rich and magnesium-poor rhyodacite, forming glassy and porous pumice with individual clasts of [...] in diameter. Typical pumice contains crystals of biotite, hornblende, plagioclase, quartz, and sanidine, with minor amounts of apatite, iron oxides, and titanite. The lava domes have uniform crystalline compositions that are richer in magnesium than the ignimbrite. Within the lava dome rocks lie phenocrysts of amphibole, biotite, plagioclase, quartz, and titanite with some alkali feldspar in some domes. Older domes have higher amphibole and lower quartz content than younger domes. Post-caldera domes are strongly <b>hydrothermally</b> altered.|$|E
500|$|The {{volcanic}} complex sits {{on top of}} ignimbrite layers, the Miocene Ujina and Pleistocene Pastillos Ignimbrites. These ignimbrites are [...] and [...] thick, {{the former}} is a welded ignimbrite that was erupted 9.3 ± 0.4 mya and the latter in two stages 0.79 ± 0.2 - 0.73 ± 0.16 mya and 0.32 ± 0.25 mya. In terms of composition, the Ujina is pink-grey crystals and pumice and the Pastillos a gray-white pumice forming the lower member and the upper member of the Pastillos contains [...] with accessory claystones, siltstones and diatomites. Further volcanic rocks beneath Irruputuncu are <b>hydrothermally</b> altered dacites that {{may be part of}} an older now deeply eroded edifice.|$|E
500|$|The fourth {{phase of}} {{activity}} began one {{million years ago}} when the Cordilleran Ice Sheet retreated from the upper flanks of the adjacent lava plateau, creating Mount Edziza proper which is the most northerly of the four central volcanoes. It is a steep-sided stratovolcano and the largest and highest of the peaks that form the volcanic complex with an elevation of , overlapping the northern flank of Ice Peak. The stratovolcano is made up of a fine-grained volcanic rock called trachyte and is associated with several lava domes which were formed by trachyte lava flows and explosive eruptions. Its smooth northern and western flanks, only slightly channeled by erosion, curve up to a circular [...] summit ridge which surrounds a central, ice-filled caldera [...] in diameter. Many glaciers cover Mount Edziza proper, including the Tencho Glacier on its southern flank. Active cirques on the eastern flank have breached the caldera rim, exposing the remnants of numerous lava lakes which ponded in the caldera 900,000 years ago and rest on <b>hydrothermally</b> altered breccia of the main conduit. Piles of pillow lava and hyaloclastite, formed by subglacial eruptions, are found on the flanks of Mount Edziza and nearby Ice Peak, {{as well as on the}} surface of the surrounding shield volcano. Pillow Ridge on Edziza's northwest flank was formed when basaltic lava erupted beneath the regional Cordilleran Ice Sheet when it was close to its greatest thickness.|$|E
500|$|The Cerro Blanco {{complex is}} formed from {{pyroclastic}} flows extending from nested calderas. The Robledo caldera is heavily eroded and has assumed a semicircular shape. The {{rim of the}} Cerro Blanco caldera proper is well-preserved, with ash and block flows filling the interior. Another theory holds that the northern Cerro Blanco and the southern Robledo calderas are part of one caldera with a minimum subsidence of [...] and a dimension of [...] The Cerro Blanco caldera is [...] wide. On its southern rim, surrounded by ashfall deposits, lies the Holocene Cerro Blanco del Robledo lava dome (...) [...] Some sources call the whole volcano Robledo and use Cerro Blanco {{to refer to the}} lava dome. The whole volcanic complex is formed from lava domes, ignimbrites, ash and block flows and unconsolidated deposits. Cerro Blanco is the largest lava dome and has a debris collapse deposit on its northern side. A <b>hydrothermally</b> altered area {{in the middle of the}} caldera has been linked to phreatomagmatic activity. The El Escondido crater northeast of the caldera is [...] wide and [...] deep. It shows a dark colour and semiannular shape in satellite images and has been interpreted as a phreatic crater. The complex is located at the southwest end of a volcano-tectonic depression formed by local fault systems. These fault systems channel magma during eruptions; usually no eruption column is formed. The formation of the depression may be influenced by the emptying of magma chambers associated with the volcano. The complex is located on [...] thick crust. A crustal low seismic velocity anomaly is located beneath Cerro Blanco, called the Southern Puna Magma Body.|$|E

5000|$|Jotabeche is a 5862 m high volcano with a caldera. A rhyolitic dome formed {{inside of}} the caldera. The Jotabeche complex reaches a {{thickness}} of 500 m when including ignimbrite, lava domes and lavas. The 5432 m high and 4 km wide Jotabeche Norte stratovolcano is found northeast of Jotabeche and is surrounded by pyroclastic flows. The Santa Cecilia lava domes (...) have diameters of 1.5 km and sit along a 4 km long fault. The Miocene volcanic complex branches out in four chains stretching in east-west direction, the Cadillal, Aguas Blancas, Jotabeche Norte and Cordon de Yeguas Heladas. N-S to NE-SW trending faults border the volcanic complex and have allowed the intrusion of diorite porphyries. The resulting <b>hydrothermally</b> altered rocks are the sites of mineral deposits and prospects. These faults include the Yeguas Heladas, Rio La Gallina and Rio Astaburuaga and form a hexagonal structure which partly forms {{the margin of the}} caldera. Otherwise, only little erosion has taken place at Jotabeche; stronger erosion though has exposed a >1 km thick <b>hydrothermally</b> altered complex at Aldebaran-Cerro Casale. Other <b>hydrothermally</b> altered areas are found within depressions. The crust beneath Jotabeche reaches a thickness of 60 km.|$|E
