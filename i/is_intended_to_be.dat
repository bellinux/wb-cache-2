5|$|Loitering munitions fit in {{the niche}} between cruise {{missiles}} and unmanned combat aerial vehicles (UCAVs) sharing characteristics with both. They differ from cruise missiles {{in that they are}} designed to loiter for a relatively long time around the target area, and from UCAVs in that a loitering munition <b>is</b> <b>intended</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> expended in an attack and has a built-in warhead.|$|E

Packets <b>are</b> <b>intended</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> flexible with respect to payload, providing higher performance than messages {{at the expense of}} configuration effort.3. scalars - connection-oriented, fixed size, uni-directional, and FIFO streams. Scalars <b>are</b> <b>intended</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> the highest performance communications mode, albeit at the expense of payload flexibility and configuration effort.|$|R

5|$|Christologically Maximus {{insisted on}} a strict dyophysitism, which {{can be seen as}} a {{corollary}} of the emphasis on theosis. In terms of salvation, humanity <b>is</b> <b>intended</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> fully united with God. This is possible for Maximus because God was first fully united with humanity in the incarnation. If Christ did not become fully human (if, for example, he only had a divine and not a human will), then salvation was no longer possible, as humanity could not become fully divine.|$|E
5|$|Continuous Care is {{a service}} {{provided}} in the patient's home. It is for patients who are experiencing severe symptoms and need temporary extra support. Once a patient is on continuous care, the hospice provides services in the home a minimum of eight hours a day. Because the criteria for continuous care is similar to general inpatient care, and due to the challenges a hospice can face with staffing extended day care in the home, continuous care <b>is</b> <b>intended</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> used for short periods of time.|$|E
