5|$|By the 15th century, English {{was back}} in fashion among all classes, though much changed; the Middle English form showed many signs of French influence, both in {{vocabulary}} and spelling. During the English Renaissance, many words were coined from Latin and Greek origins. Modern English has extended this custom of flexibility, {{when it comes to}} incorporating words from different languages. Thanks <b>in</b> <b>large</b> <b>part</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> British Empire, the English language is the world's unofficial lingua franca.|$|E
5|$|Owen's {{argument}} that the Federal Reserve's deflationary stance was largely responsible for causing the Great Depression {{would have been considered}} unorthodox at the time he made it. In more recent decades, however, such a view has come to be widely accepted, due <b>in</b> <b>large</b> <b>part</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> influence of the 1963 study A Monetary History of the United States by Milton Friedman and Anna J.

5|$|The {{potential}} political {{threat to}} Apollo blew over, due <b>in</b> <b>large</b> <b>part</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> support of President Lyndon B.

He was a staunch supporter of NASA since its inception, had even recommended the Moon program to President John F. Kennedy in 1961, and was skilled at portraying it as part of Kennedy's legacy.|$|E
5|$|By 1920, due <b>in</b> <b>large</b> <b>part</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> city's {{economic}} prosperity, Cleveland {{became the}} nation's fifth largest city. The city counted Progressive Era politicians {{such as the}} populist Mayor Tom L. Johnson among its leaders. In commemoration of the centennial of Cleveland's incorporation as a city, the Great Lakes Exposition debuted in June 1936 along the Lake Erie shore north of downtown. Conceived {{as a way to}} energize a city after the Great Depression, it drew four million visitors in its first season, and seven million by the end of its second and final season in September 1937. The exposition was housed on grounds that are now used by the Great Lakes Science Center, the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Burke Lakefront Airport, among others.|$|E
5|$|Many of {{the rural}} ranchers and Cowboys resented the growing {{influence}} of the city residents over county politics and law enforcement. The ranchers largely maintained {{control of the country}} outside Tombstone, due <b>in</b> <b>large</b> <b>part</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> sympathetic support of Cochise County Sheriff Johnny Behan, who favored the Cowboys and rural ranchers, and who also grew to intensely dislike the Earps. Behan tended to ignore the Earps' complaints about the McLaurys' and Clantons' horse thieving and cattle rustling. The Earps were known to bend the law in their favor when it affected their gambling and saloon interests, which earned them further enmity with the Cowboy faction.|$|E

5|$|The {{music that}} would {{ultimately}} become the Hybrid Theory album was first produced by Linkin Park in 1999 as a nine-track demo tape. The band sent this tape to various recording companies and played forty-two different showcases for recording industry representatives, including performances for Los Angeles promoter and impresario, Mike Galaxy's showcase at The Gig on Melrose. However, they were initially {{turned down by}} most of the major labels and several independent record labels. The band was signed by Warner Bros. Records in 1999, due <b>in</b> <b>large</b> <b>part</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> constant recommendations of Jeff Blue, who had joined the label after resigning from Zomba.|$|E
5|$|There {{has been}} an {{increasing}} gulf between the Premier League and the Football League. Since its split with the Football League, many established clubs in the Premier League have managed {{to distance themselves from}} their counterparts in lower leagues. Owing <b>in</b> <b>large</b> <b>part</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> disparity in revenue from television rights between the leagues, many newly promoted teams have found it difficult to avoid relegation in their first season in the Premier League. In every season except 2001–02 and 2011–12, at least one Premier League newcomer has been relegated back to the Football League. In 1997–98 all three promoted clubs were relegated {{at the end of the}} season.|$|E
5|$|Virginia Tech's defense {{came into}} the 1995 Sugar Bowl ranked 10th {{in the country in}} total defense.

Tech boasted the No. 1 rushing defense in the country, {{allowing}} an average of only 77.4 yards per game on the ground. Tech also had the No. 5 scoring defense in the country, allowing just 14 points per game on average. Tech's defense was No. 11 in total, allowing just 285.9 yards per game. The Hokies also sacked opposing quarterbacks 44 times during the regular season and were ranked No. 23 in pass defense.|$|E

5|$|When the Iowa-class battleships were {{launched}} in 1943 and 1944 they carried twenty quad Bofors 40mm gun mounts, which they used for defense against enemy aircraft. These heavy guns were also {{employed in the}} protection of allied aircraft carriers operating in the Pacific Theater of World War II. These guns remained on the battleships Iowa, Missouri, and Wisconsin {{from the time they}} were commissioned until they were reactivated for service in the 1980s. As each battleship arrived for modernization during the early and mid-1980s the Bofors mounts that remained aboard were removed due <b>in</b> <b>large</b> <b>part</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> ineffectiveness of such manually aimed weapons against modern day jet fighters and enemy missiles. The replacement for the Bofors guns was the US Navy's Phalanx Close-in weapon system (CIWS).|$|E
5|$|In 1928, {{she began}} writing her autobiography, {{with the support}} of a group of American admirers, {{including}} journalist H. L. Mencken, poet Edna St. Vincent Millay, novelist Theodore Dreiser and art collector Peggy Guggenheim, who raised $4,000 for her. She secured a cottage in the French coastal city of Saint-Tropez and spent two years recounting her life. Berkman offered sharply critical feedback, which she eventually incorporated at the price of a strain on their relationship. Goldman intended the book, Living My Life, as a single volume for a price the working class could afford (she urged no more than $5.00); her publisher Alfred A. Knopf, however, released it as two volumes sold together for $7.50. Goldman was furious, but unable to force a change. Due <b>in</b> <b>large</b> <b>part</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Great Depression, sales were sluggish despite keen interest from libraries around the US. Critical reviews were generally enthusiastic; The New York Times, The New Yorker, and Saturday Review of Literature all listed it as one of the year's top non-fiction books.|$|E
5|$|It was not {{uncommon}} for wealthy or powerful families to facilitate the construction of large temple complexes, usually by donating {{a portion of their}} family estate to a Buddhist sect. Often the land already contained buildings that could be re-purposed for religions use. The Fei (費) family of the town of Jinze, located just west of Shanghai, converted a mansion on their property into a Buddhist sutra-recitiation hall, and later built several other religious buildings around the hall. This spurred a boom in temple construction in the area, causing Jinze to become a major center of the White Lotus sect of Buddhism, which in turn spurred the construction of more temples and lead the town to become a significant location within the Song. The nearby town of Nanxiang gained prominence shortly {{after the fall of the}} Song <b>in</b> <b>large</b> <b>part</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> construction of temples and other religious buildings, which spanned the entire Song empire.|$|E

Top500's fastest supercomputer {{at the time was}} BlueGene/L, at 0.280 petaFLOPS. The following year, on May 7, 2008, the project attained a sustained performance level higher than two native petaFLOPS, followed by the three and four native petaFLOPS milestones on August 20 and September 28, 2008 respectively. On February 18, 2009, Folding@home achieved five native petaFLOPS, and was the first computing project to meet these five levels. In comparison, November 2008's fastest supercomputer was IBM's Roadrunner at 1.105 petaFLOPS. On November 10, 2011, Folding@home's performance exceeded six native petaFLOPS with the equivalent of nearly eight x86 petaFLOPS. In mid-May 2013, Folding@home attained over seven native petaFLOPS, with the equivalent of 14.87 x86 petaFLOPS. It then reached eight native petaFLOPS on June 21, followed by nine on September 9 of that year, with 17.9 x86 petaFLOPS. On May 11, 2016 Folding@home announced that it was moving towards reaching the 100 x86 petaFLOPS mark.|$|E
5|$|It {{is clear}} {{nevertheless}} that the gradual {{decline of the}} indigenous Byzantine naval power in the 10th and 11th centuries, when it was eclipsed by the Italian city-states, chiefly Venice and later Genoa, was of great long-term significance for {{the fate of the}} Empire. The sack of the Fourth Crusade, which shattered the foundations of the Byzantine state, was due <b>in</b> <b>large</b> <b>part</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> absolute defencelessness of the Empire at sea. This process was initiated by Byzantium itself in the 9th century, when the Italians were increasingly employed by the Empire to compensate for its own naval weakness in the West. The Italian republics also profited from their role as intermediaries in the trade between the Empire and Western Europe, marginalizing the Byzantine merchant marine, which in turn had adverse effects on the availability of Byzantine naval forces. Inevitably however, as the Italian republics slowly moved away from the Byzantine orbit, they began pursuing their own policies, and from the late 11th century on, they turned from protection of the Empire to exploitation and sometimes outright plunder, heralding the eventual financial and political subjugation of Byzantium to their interests. The absence of a strong navy was certainly keenly felt by the Byzantines at the time, as the comments of Kekaumenos illustrate. Strong and energetic emperors like Manuel Komnenos, and later Michael VIII Palaiologos, could revive Byzantine naval power, but even after landing heavy strokes against the Venetians, they merely replaced them with the Genoese and the Pisans. Trade thus remained in Latin hands, its profits continued to be siphoned off from the Empire, and after their deaths, their achievements quickly evaporated. After 1204, and with the brief exception of Michael VIII's reign, the fortunes of the now small Byzantine navy were more or less tied to the shifting alliances with the Italian maritime republics.|$|E
5|$|The ships saw {{no action}} during the war, owing <b>in</b> <b>large</b> <b>part</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> {{nature of the}} Adriatic campaign. The Austro-Hungarian Navy and its primary opponent, the Italian Navy, both adopted {{cautious}} strategies, since neither wanted to risk its fleet in the narrow waters of the Adriatic Sea, where naval mines and fast, torpedo-armed craft could operate effectively. Zara was stationed in Cattaro Bay and Sebenico protected the harbor of her namesake city, while Spalato provided local defense outside Pola. Zara was transferred from Cattaro Bay to Pola in June 1917, but while en route, suffered a serious explosion that caused significant damage to her bow. A contemporary investigation determined {{that it was the}} result of badly deteriorated chemicals in her torpedo warheads, though the naval historian René Greger reports that a mine was actually to blame. After repairs were effected, she joined the harbor defense at Pola. Sebenico was withdrawn from guard duties in 1918 and assigned to the torpedo school. All three ships were seized as war prizes by the victorious Allied powers after the war in 1918, and all three were awarded to Italy in 1920. Having no use for the vessels, the Italians immediately sold all three to ship breakers.|$|E
