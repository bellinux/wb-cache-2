5|$|After World War II, {{industrial}} development quickened. New technology increased farm productivity through automation of feedlots for hogs and cattle, machine milking at dairy farms, and raising chickens in large buildings. Planting became more specialized with hybridization {{of corn and}} wheat, {{and the use of}} farm machinery such as tractors and combines became the norm. University of Minnesota professor Norman Borlaug contributed to these developments as part of the Green Revolution. Suburban development accelerated due to increased postwar <b>housing</b> <b>demand</b> and convenient transportation. Increased mobility, in turn, enabled more specialized jobs.|$|E
25|$|Mary Peacock Elementary School is {{the newer}} of two {{elementary}} {{schools that are}} located near the high school. The creation of Pelican Bay State Prison caused an increase in <b>housing</b> <b>demand</b> in the Crescent City area, and an increased school district population. This school was built {{as a result of}} that demand, but is not directly associated with the prison.|$|E

This has pushed up the prices of the few private properties that become available and, significantly {{for the majority of the}} islands' populations, it has also affects the rental sector where rates have likewise drastically increased.|$|E

25|$|After the war, Evansville's {{manufacturing}} base of automobiles, household appliances, and farm equipment benefited from growing post-war demand. A growing <b>housing</b> <b>demand</b> also caused residential development to leap {{north and east}} of the city. However, between 1955 and 1963, a nationwide recession hit Evansville. Among other closures Servel (which produced refrigerators) {{went out of business}} and Chrysler ended its local operations. The economy was saved from near total collapse by 28 businesses that moved into the area, including Whirlpool, Alcoa, and General Electric.|$|E
25|$|The current {{housing in}} the city region is {{inadequate}} to support the job growth. Current patterns of demand at {{the upper end of}} the market are likely to continue, increasing problems of division of social groups and affordability. At the other end of the market there are problems both with the shortage of social rented housing and affordability. There is a significant legacy of dense terraced housing some of which is no longer fit for purpose.

25|$|One {{explanation}} is that older Californians with fixed incomes had increasing difficulty paying property taxes, which were rising {{as a result of}} California's population growth, increasing <b>housing</b> <b>demand,</b> and inflation. Due to severe inflation during the 1970s, reassessments of residential property increased property taxes so much, that some retired people could no longer afford to remain in homes they had purchased long before. An academic study found support for this explanation, reporting that older voters, homeowners, and voters expecting a tax increase were more likely to vote for Proposition 13.|$|E
25|$|From {{the late}} 1920s through the mid-1930s, the Holy Cross Fathers, {{who run the}} University of Notre Dame, {{controlled}} the college's administration. The diocese called those priests in {{to help with the}} school's financial problems; they were known as a crisis intervention team of sorts for parochial schools of that time. During World War II, St. Thomas served as a training base for naval officers, which kept the school open when men who would have attended college were fighting in the war. After the war, in 1948, the college established 'Tom Town' on the eastern end of the lower quadrant, which is currently home to the O'Shaughnessey-Frey Library. Tom Town consisted of white, barrack-like housing units for faculty, students and their families. The units helped to meet <b>housing</b> <b>demand</b> after WWII.|$|E

[...] The Reserve Bank of Australia in its submission to the same Productivity Commission report stated that [...] "rapid growth in overseas visitors such as students may have boosted demand for rental housing". However, the Commission found that [...] "the ABS resident population estimates have limitations when used for assessing <b>housing</b> <b>demand.</b> Given the significant influx of foreigners coming to work or study in Australia in recent years, it seems highly likely that short-stay visitor movements may have added to the demand for housing. However, the Commissions are unaware of any research that quantifies the effects." ...|$|E
