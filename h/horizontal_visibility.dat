40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to {{determine}} the area affected by dust storms in different wind speeds using satellite images. In the first step, windy conditions of the Sistan plain were analyzed using wind statistics data. Next, five stormy days of Zabol city, indicating different wind speeds and <b>horizontal</b> <b>visibilities</b> during those storms, were selected. Then, high temporal resolution MODIS data was used as appropriate satellite data in this study. After that, a storm index was defined by means of analyses of storm radiance profile in bands with maximum and minimum storm reflection. The index is the square of difference between visible and thermal infrared bands, which is able to segment stormy confines with the range of reflection changes between 0 and 16. The reflection values were segmented in center of a 1 km 2 network using usual interpolation methods such as Local Polynomial, Radial Basis Function, Inverse Distance Weighted, Ordinary Kriging and Universal Kriging. In order to assess the above mentioned interpolation methods, validation techniques were applied using ArcGIS 9. 2 software. The result of these assessments such as standard deviation method indicates that the Ordinary Kriging had lower standard deviation. By analyzing the variograms and spatial analysis of the data using GS+ software, the best mathematic model able to fit the points was selected and classification was done by using this model. Finally, the stormy corridors with different dust densities were determined and by calculating the area and determining the villages located in these corridors, the critica...|$|R

40|$|AbstractA bar layout {{is a set}} of {{vertically}} oriented non-intersecting line segments, called bars, {{embedded in}} the plane. The visibility graph associated with a layout is defined as the graph whose vertices correspond to the bars and whose edges represent the <b>horizontal</b> <b>visibilities</b> between pairs of bars. Characterizations of the bar-representable graphs (those graphs which are the visibility graphs of some bar layout) are known (Tamassia and Tollis, 1986; Wismath, 1985), and directed versions of the problem of determining whether a graph is bar-representable have also been considered (see (S. K. Wismath, 1989)). In this paper, a weighted version of the problem is formulated and solved; namely, given a weighted graph, does there exist a corresponding layout in which the edge weights are commensurate with the amount of visibility between the corresponding pairs of bars. In particular, a polynomial time algorithm for the layout of such graphs is developed when ordering information is specified (for example, when an embedding of the graph must be respected). Determining bar-representability for weighted undirected graphs is equivalent to solving the following flow problem. Given an undirected weighted graph G, attach a source and sink to G, so that for some orientation of the edges, the resulting network is planar, acyclic, and uses all arcs of G to full capacity. We call this the Full Flow Existence problem. It is the connection of this flow problem to the problem of determining bar-representability of graphs that is exploited to solve the weighted case of the latter. Under a different model of visibility (the so-called “strong” model), the characterization results differ markedly, being NP-Complete in the undirected unweighted case (Andreae, 1992). Tamassia and Tollis (1986) presented conditions for the strong visibility representation of directed unweighted ordered graphs were presented. In Section 5, these conditions are strengthened for the weighted case...|$|R

Viewing angle property in the range of ± 30 ° was tested in the <b>horizontal</b> direction. The <b>visibility</b> of the left angle is wider than the right angel, and the contrast of the left angle is better.

When the voltage gets to 15 V, there is a state of phase change that the display color immediately turns from black to milky white.
