2500|$|Once {{belonging}} to the Lost River Ranch lease, the land that now comprises the Milk River Natural Area was grazed infrequently and was therefore deleted from the grazing lease under the Public Lands Act in 1978 and 1979. Some resource exploration has occurred {{over the years and}} several wells were drilled but have subsequently been abandoned. Coal was also briefly mined but due to the area's remoteness was also abandoned. The Milk River Natural Area and Kennedy Coulee Ecological Reserve were established with the intent [...] "to protect and maintain the ecological and aesthetic character of a representative example of the Mixed Grassland Natural Region with minimal human interference;" [...] specifically, protecting ecological diversity and processes, native species and habitats, rare and significant natural features, recreation, education, and scientific research. Management interference is intended to be minimal and [...] "let nature take its course" [...] wherever possible, while managing some ecological processes such as fires and controlled grazing. A balance of grazing regimes is important to maintain the combination of short and medium grasses defining the dry mixedgrass natural subregion. Cattle do not graze {{in the same way as}} the now-extirpated bison did, but have been used to simulate natural processes. Grazing management maintains the grassland ecosystem in its climax state, but overgrazing must be avoided to prevent soil erosion and loss of biodiversity. Rangeland health assessments aid this goal by periodically evaluating the area's ecosystem health, including measuring factors such as <b>grazing</b> <b>intensity,</b> weed occurrence, species composition, site stability, and soil and plant health. The 2011 rangeland survey concluded that the Milk River Natural Area overall is in excellent health and meeting its management goals, and that plant community health and grazing management were found to be far exceeding provincial standards.|$|E

Using a 5 -year grazing experiment, we investigated the relationship between NH 3 volatilization from soil and grazing pressure (0. 0, 3. 0, 6. 0, and 9. 0 sheep/hm(2)) from June to September of 2009 and 2010 via the vented-chamber method. The results show that soil NH 3 volatilization was not significantly different at different <b>grazing</b> <b>intensities</b> in 2009, although it was higher at the highest stocking rate during 2010. There was no significant linear relationship between soil NH 3 volatilization rates and soil NH 4 +-N, but soil NH 3 volatilization rates were significantly related to soil water content and air temperature. <b>Grazing</b> <b>intensities</b> had no significant influence on soil NH 3 volatilization. Soil NH 3 emissions from June to September (grazing period), averaged over all <b>grazing</b> <b>intensities,</b> were 9. 6 +/- 0. 2 and 19. 0 +/- 0. 2 kg N/hm(2) in 2009 and 2010, respectively. Moreover, linear equations describing monthly air temperature and precipitation showed a good fit to changes in soil NH 3 emissions (r= 0. 506, P= 0. 014). Overall, <b>grazing</b> <b>intensities</b> had less influence than that of climatic factors on soil NH 3 emissions.

Methods: Dry heath and grass heath vegetation plots with inferred <b>grazing</b> <b>intensities</b> (high, intermediate and low) were selected a priori from an interpolated pellet count map compiled in 2002. In each plot, faecal pellets were counted, environmental variables measured and vegetation sampled by listing presence and absence. Species composition was compared with a detrended correspondence analysis, and a canonical correspondence {{analysis was used to}} infer relations between species composition and environmental variables. Plots were also clustered to provide groupings for an indicator species analysis. Results: Significant {{differences in}} faecal pellet count were present between the highest and lowest <b>grazing</b> <b>intensities</b> for both vegetation types, showing that the pattern in the interpolated pellet maps was robust.

50|$|Natural tree {{regeneration}} in Australian agricultural {{landscapes of}} {{species such as}} Eucalyptus and Allocasuarina has historically been low. Higher historical levels of agricultural activity such as cultivation, grazing and degraded land being invaded by weeds tend to lead to less natural regeneration of eucalypt species and other desired vegetation from the threatened communities. <b>Grazing</b> <b>intensity</b> {{appears to be the}} primary determinant of Eucalyptus regenerative success as changes to the seedbed occur due to pasture grass introductions and seedlings are often browsed by either stock or pests reducing their survival rate.

50|$|The most {{important}} skill {{for developing a}} targeted grazing program is patience and commitment. However, understanding livestock and plant responses to grazing are critical in developing a targeted grazing program. The program should have a clear statement {{of the kind of}} animal, timing and rate of grazing necessary to suppress troublesome plants and maintain a healthy landscape. The grazing application should 1) cause significant damage to the target plants 2) limit damage to desired vegetation and 3) be integrated with other control strategies. First, to cause significant damage to targeted plants requires understanding when the target plant is most susceptible to grazing damage and when they are most palatable to livestock. Target plant palatability depends on the grazing animals inherited and developed plant preferences (i.e. the shape of sheep and goat‚Äôs mouths make them well suited for eating broad leaf weeds). Goats are also well designed for eating shrubs. Second, target plants often exist in a plant community with many desirable plants. The challenge is to select the correct animal, grazing time and <b>grazing</b> <b>intensity</b> to maximize the impact on the target plant while reducing it on the associated plant community. Finally, management objectives, target plant species, weather, topography, plant physiology, and associated plant communities are among the many variables that can determine treatment type and duration. Well-developed targeted grazing objectives and an adaptive management plan that takes into account other control strategies need to be in place.|$|E

40|$|Tolerance can enable {{introduced}} {{plants to}} establish {{in the face}} of intense consumption by native herbivores. The siphonacous seaweed, Caulerpa cylindracea, despite being heavily grazed by native herbivores, {{is one of the most}} successful invaders in the Mediterranean. By means of a field experiment simulating herbivore grazing, we tested whether regeneration from damaged creeping stolons may allow C. cylindracea to compensate or overcompensate for biomass loss. In order to simulate different <b>grazing</b> <b>intensities,</b> the cover of C. cylindracea was either left untouched or clipped to 25...|$|R
40|$|In the bunchgrass paramo of Parque Nacional Natural Los Nevados, Colombia, {{aspects of}} {{population}} {{dynamics of the}} stem rosette Espeletia hartwegiana ssp. centro-andina were studied in relation to different <b>grazing</b> <b>intensities</b> and regenerating stages after burning. Life tables corresponding to different management situations are presented. A basal growth rate of 8. 8 cm per year was determined for adults in undisturbed situations. In burned sites, an increased growth rate was observed, including a fire-induced stimulation factor which is dependent on initial plant height {{at the time of}} [...] ...|$|R
40|$|The {{cover of}} large trees in African savannahs is rapidly declining, mainly due to human land-use practices. Trees improve grass {{nutrient}} quality {{and contribute to}} species and structural diversity of savannah vegetation. However, the response of herbivores to trees as habitat features is unknown. We quantified the habitat use of wild and domestic ungulates in two eastern and southern African savannahs. We assessed <b>grazing</b> <b>intensities</b> and quantified dung depositions beneath and around canopies of different sized trees. Grasses were eaten and dung was deposited twice as frequently beneath large (ca. 5 m in height) and very large trees (7 - 10 m) than in open grasslands. Small trees...|$|R
