5|$|Erika {{produced}} light rainfall across southern Texas, peaking at 3.83inches (97mm) in Sabinal, {{though most}} locations reported {{less than two}} inches (50mm) of precipitation. In addition, weather radar estimated isolated accumulations of 4 to 6inches (100 to 150mm) of precipitation in Kenedy and Brooks Counties. Sustained winds from Erika <b>in</b> <b>south</b> <b>Texas</b> peaked at 39mph (62km/h) in Brownsville, where a gust of 47mph (75km/h) was also recorded. Strong waves were reported northwards to Corpus Christi. The storm caused minor flooding and beach erosion along South Padre Island. Strong wind gusts of up to 60mph (95km/h) caused isolated, minor wind damage <b>in</b> <b>south</b> <b>Texas,</b> including in South Padre Island, where the winds damaged {{the roof of a}} business. The winds also uprooted a large tree and caused limb damage to several small- to medium-sized trees in Brownsville. In Texas, damage totaled to $10,000 (2003USD, $ USD).|$|E

5|$|While Erika's {{precursor}} disturbance {{was moving}} across Florida, it dropped heavy rainfall. <b>In</b> <b>south</b> <b>Texas,</b> Erika produced moderate winds of 50 to 60mph (80 to 95km/h) along with light rain, causing minor and isolated wind {{damage in the}} state. In northeastern Mexico, Erika produced moderate amounts of rainfall, resulting in mudslides and flooding. There, two people were killed when their vehicle was swept away by floodwaters.|$|E
5|$|The {{cane toad}} {{is native to}} the Americas, and its range {{stretches}} from the Rio Grande Valley <b>in</b> <b>South</b> <b>Texas</b> to the central Amazon and southeastern Peru, {{and some of the}} continental islands near Venezuela (such as Trinidad and Tobago). This area encompasses both tropical and semiarid environments. The density of the cane toad is significantly lower within its native distribution than in places where it has been introduced. In South America, the density was recorded to be 20 adults per 100m (109yd) of shoreline, 1 to 2% of the density in Australia.|$|E
5|$|The {{most common}} accent and/or dialect spoken by natives {{throughout}} Texas is {{sometimes referred to}} as Texan English, which itself is a sub-variety of a broader category of American English known as Southern American English. Creole language is spoken in East Texas. In some areas of the state—particularly in the large cities – Western American English and General American English, have been on the increase. Chicano English—due to a growing Hispanic population—is widespread <b>in</b> <b>South</b> <b>Texas,</b> while African American Vernacular English, is especially notable in historically minority areas of urban Texas.|$|E

5|$|A damaged {{electric}} {{tower in}} Kenedy County resulted in power outages {{for thousands of}} people. At {{the height of the}} storm, an estimated 64,000people were without power <b>in</b> <b>south</b> <b>Texas.</b> Portions of Texas State Highway Loop 281 were submerged in floodwaters, leaving $50,000 (1999USD) in damage. Damage in Corpus Christi were estimated at $100,000 (1999USD). In Duval County, 200 homes were damaged by flooding and large areas of agricultural land were flooded. Damage in the county amounted to roughly $2million (1999USD). Five other F0 tornadoes touched down in the state. Damage to homes and businesses in Corpus Christi was estimated up to $500,000 (1999USD); agricultural damage reached $1million and another $500,000 (1999USD) was reported in losses. Slick roads from Bret's heavy rains caused the collision of a truck and a tractor, killing four people. Damage amounted to $15million (1999USD) throughout southern Texas.|$|E
5|$|Reconstruction {{of public}} facilities, roads, and water pipes {{received}} increased funding on September3 {{to speed up}} the program. The following day, twelve disaster recovery centers were opened in the affected counties for residents to apply for federal funding. On September9, two more disaster recovery centers were opened for residents <b>in</b> <b>south</b> <b>Texas.</b> Later that day, $831,593.28 (1999USD) in disaster housing grants was distributed to affected residents. On September15, roughly 10,200 people applied for disaster loans, amounting to $3.1million (1999USD). A total of 167 also received crisis intervention from FEMA. In Corpus Christi, winds and rain covered the city in debris and brush, costing $200,000 (1999USD) for clean-up.|$|E
5|$|The {{precursor}} disturbance to Tropical Storm Arlene dropped {{heavy rainfall}} over Central America. As a result, 20fatalities occurred, {{all of which}} were from a mudslide in El Salvador. Heavy rainfall also produced heavy rainfall on the Yucatán Peninsula. After Arlene became a tropical cyclone, rainfall in Mexico inundated areas of Campeche, where damage totaled US$33million. In total, five people were killed in Mexico. Flood damage <b>in</b> <b>South</b> <b>Texas</b> was extensive, with widespread urban flooding and road closures. Entire plots of farmland were inundated by torrential rains brought by Arlene. The landfalling Arlene interacted with a passing cold front which helped to produce showers further northeast, though damage in those locales was comparatively less severe. In total, Arlene caused 26deaths and at least US$60.8million in damage.|$|E

5|$|The {{threat of}} the storm {{prompted}} the United States Weather Bureau to issue southeast storm warnings for Key West, Florida. Light rainfall from the storm was reported in Miami. Before the storm made its final landfall, the Weather Bureau issued northeast storm warnings from Brownsville to Port O'Connor, Texas on July 5. That same day, a hurricane warning was also issued for Brownsville. The hurricane ultimately struck a sparsely-populated area of northeastern Mexico, causing several deaths and heavy damage in the country. High winds downed trees and power lines, and damaged the roofs of several houses. Along the beach near Tampico, high tides damaged coastal structures and flooded some cars. The effects extended into Texas, and Brazos Island, Port Isabel, and Port Aransas were flooded due to the storm surge. High tides damaged ten piers in Port Isabel, and there was damage to buildings along the coast. The storm damaged the cotton and fruit crops <b>in</b> <b>south</b> <b>Texas</b> from high winds and rainfall. Rains from the storm ended an extended drought in the Brownsville area.|$|E
5|$|While {{the storm}} was located in the eastern Gulf of Mexico on August 15, the National Hurricane Center issued a Hurricane Watch and Tropical Storm Warning from Brownsville to Baffin Bay, Texas. The center also {{recommended}} a Hurricane Watch spanning from Soto la Marina, Tamaulipas to the international border. Late that same day, when strengthening was underway, a Hurricane Warning was either issued or recommended from La Pesca, Mexico to Baffin Bay, Texas, though the warnings for south Texas were dropped when a more southward motion occurred. Just one month after Hurricane Claudette caused millions in damage <b>in</b> <b>south</b> <b>Texas,</b> the fast movement of Erika caught citizens by surprise as it was forecast to make landfall near Brownsville. Citizens and business owners boarded up for the storm. About 10,000 were evacuated from northeastern Mexico due to the threat for flooding, including 2,000 in Matamoros.|$|E
