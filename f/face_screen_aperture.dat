50|$|<b>Screens</b> with <b>apertures</b> {{small enough}} to block {{termites}} were developed in Australia and have widely used in the United States, mostly for plumbing penetrations, since the 1990s. One of the early uses of screens for pest exclusion was the implementation of screen doors and window coverings. Screens are required by building codes at vent openings. To exclude rats, screen openings must be ½” (13.7 mm) or smaller. To exclude mice, a <b>screen</b> <b>aperture</b> size of ¼” or smaller is required. Most insects can be excluded with screens measuring 1/16” (1.59mm) in aperture size, but to effectively exclude subterranean termites, required <b>screen</b> <b>apertures</b> measure 1/55” (0.46 mm). Application areas for screens in the building envelope include weep holes, soffits, gable and ridge vents, among others.|$|R

50|$|A trommel screen, {{also known}} as a rotary screen, is a {{mechanical}} screening machine used to separate materials, mainly in the mineral and solid-waste processing industries. It consists of a perforated cylindrical drum that is normally elevated at an angle at the feed end. Physical size separation is achieved as the feed material spirals down the rotating drum, where the undersized material smaller than the <b>screen</b> <b>apertures</b> passes through the screen, while the oversized material exits {{at the other end of}} the drum.|$|R

50|$|However more {{material}} can be screened at once for a vibrating screen {{compared to a}} trommel screen. This is because {{only one part of}} the screen area of the trommel screen is utilised during the screening process whilst the entire screen is used for a vibrating screen. Trommel screens are also more susceptible to plugging and blinding, especially when different sized <b>screen</b> <b>apertures</b> are in series. Plugging is when material larger than the aperture may become stuck or wedged into the apertures and then may be forced through which is undesirable. Blinding is when wet material clump up and stick {{to the surface of the}} screen. The vibrations in the vibrating screens reduce the chance of plugging and blinding.|$|R

40|$|Accurate {{crushing}} {{and screening}} models {{are essential for}} the meaningful simulation of ore dressing plants such as the iron ore beneficiation plant studies in this work. Crushing and screening models were studies, developed and enhanced. The basic simulator used was Microsim, which was subsequently expanded to incorporate these new models. The models were then evaluated individually. The Whiten crushing model was modified for haematite, as this is a particularly hard ore. A new model was developed for the gyradisc crushing of haematite, with two interparticle breakage mechanisms {{taking place in the}} crushing chamber. The gyradisc model has only the crusher closed side setting as parameter. Both models showed good agreement with experimental data. The Karra screen model was enhanced to include the use of ‘poly’ decks and non-square <b>screen</b> <b>apertures,</b> as used on the plant. The Rose efficiency model was developed to use efficiencies from plant data or experiments. The Rose model showed a better relative accuracy than the entirely empirical enhanced Karra model. The screen models developed can be used for different ores but the crushing models are not transferable. Thereafter simulation was done for the quaternary sub-plant manufacturing two or three products respectively. The product ratios obtained by simulation were accurate in both cases. The optimization routine was then used to calculate an improved fine to lumpy ore ratio. It was found that only a small improvement could be achieved in the quaternary plant. Simulation of the preliminary comminution plant, however, failed to give accurate results. This plant does not operate in steady state, therefore the error could be ascribed to this. The accuracy of the Nordberg gyratory crushing model used in this sub-plant could not be established. The washing and screening plant was successfully simulated with the new screening models. The choice of size classes was found to be very important in the simulation of crushing and screening circuits. The maximum number must be used and should coincide with <b>screen</b> <b>apertures.</b> Microsim {{has proved to be a}} powerful simulator subject, to the quality of input data and evaluative skills of the user.

This study used eye tracking to compare spontaneous visual attention to a <b>screen</b> displaying a <b>face</b> or an object between children with autism and controls in a nonconstraint condition and to investigate the relationship with clinical characteristics in autism group. Time exploring screen was measured during passive viewing of static images of faces or objects. Autistic behaviors were assessed by the CARS and the BSE-R in autism group.

40|$|The sputter {{deposition}} of coatings onto capsules of polymer and oxide shells {{as well as}} solid metal spheres is accomplished using a chambered substrate platform. Oxides and metal coatings are sputter deposited through a screen-aperture array onto a 0. 3 - 1. 2 mm diameter, solid spheres and hollow shells. Each shell is contained within its own individual chamber within a larger array. Ultrasonic vibration is the method used to produce a random bounce of each capsule within each chamber, {{in order to produce}} a coating with uniform thickness. Characterization of thin aluminum-oxide coated, platinum solid spheres and thicker copper-gold layer coated, hollow capsules (of both glass and polymer) show that uniform coatings can be produced using a screen-aperture chambered, substrate platform. Potential advantages of this approach compared to open-bounce pans include improved sample yield and reduced surface roughness from debris minimization.

40|$|An {{experimental}} {{study was conducted}} on the flow of aqueous solutions of detergent through mesh screens to mimic cloth washing. Pressure losses across the mesh screens were measured for water, dilute polymer and several aqueous detergent solutions. A reduction of pressure losses was observed for the flow of aqueous solutions of low molecular weight surfactants such as Laurylether (AE), Laurylbenzene-sulfonic acid-sodiumsalt (LAS), Benzalkonium-chloride (BC) Sodium-dodecyl-sulfate (SDS), and Hexadecyltrimetyl-ammonium-bromide (CTAB), but not for the high molecular weight polymers like Polyethylene-oxide (PEO 18) and Polyacrylamide (PAA), through mesh screens. A flow visualization experiment was carried out to observe the flow pattern upstream and downstream of the mesh screen. Photographic images revealed that, instead of an expected large converging flow from the upstream section into the screen opening as in orifice flow, the bulk of the liquid entering the <b>screen</b> <b>aperture</b> took the form of a liquid column of similar diameter as the inlet tube.
