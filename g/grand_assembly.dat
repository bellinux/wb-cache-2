5000|$|The text of {{the first}} nine {{articles}} may be translated as follows: *Article 1: Sovereignty is vested in the nation without condition. The governmental system {{is based on the}} principle of self-determination and government by the people.*Article 2: Executive power and legislative responsibility is exercised by and concentrated {{in the hands of the}} <b>Grand</b> National <b>Assembly</b> which is the sole and real representative of the nation.*Article 3: The Turkish State is governed by the <b>Grand</b> National <b>Assembly</b> (Büyük Millet Meclisi) and its government is entitled 'the Government of Grand National Assembly' (Büyük Millet Meclisi Hükûmeti).*Article 4: The <b>Grand</b> National <b>Assembly</b> is composed of members who are elected by the people of the provinces.*Article 5: Elections to the <b>Grand</b> National <b>Assembly</b> are held every two years. The duration of membership is limited to two years but re-election of a member is possible. The former assembly remains in office until the new assembly convenes. When holding a new election seems to be impossible the legislative period can be extended by only one year. Each member of the <b>Grand</b> National <b>Assembly</b> is not only a representative of the province by which he is elected but of the whole nation.*Article 6: The General <b>Assembly</b> of the <b>Grand</b> National <b>Assembly</b> convenes of its own accord on the first day of November.*Article 7: The basic rights of the application of the ordinances of the sacred law; the promulgation, amendment, and abrogation of all laws; the concluding of treaties and peace; the promulgation of the defence of the fatherland (i.e., the declaration of war) belong to the <b>Grand</b> National <b>Assembly.</b> The preparation of laws and regulations will be guided by juridical and religious provisions, which best conform to the modus operandi of the people and the needs of the times, as well as established customs. The functions and responsibilities of the Council of Ministers shall be fixed by a special law.*Article 8: The government of the <b>Grand</b> National <b>Assembly</b> exercises the executive function through ministers who are elected according to its special law. The <b>Grand</b> National <b>Assembly</b> directs the ministers on executive affairs and changes them when necessary.*Article 9: The Head of the <b>Grand</b> National <b>Assembly</b> who is elected by the General Assembly is the Head of the <b>Grand</b> National <b>Assembly</b> for one electoral period. With this status, he is entitled to sign on behalf of the Assembly and to approve the decisions of the Council of Ministers.

2500|$|Shortly {{after the}} {{formation}} of the Premier Grand Lodge of England, James Anderson was commissioned to digest these [...] "Gothic Constitutions" [...] in a palatable, modern form.

2500|$|The {{political}} system {{depicted in the}} book is a constitutional monarchy, with the House of Orange elevated to the role of providing an Emperor of the Solar System. The Emperor reigns (but does not rule) from a palace on the Moon, with the real {{power in the hands of}} a Supreme Minister, who must command the support of the <b>Grand</b> <b>Assembly.</b> [...] Elections for the Assembly are held as in a Parliamentary system [...] — there is an upper time limit (five years) between elections, but they can be called more frequently if the Prime Minister so decides, or if he is forced to it by the loss of a vote of confidence.|$|E
2500|$|The {{legislative}} power rests with a <b>Grand</b> <b>Assembly,</b> which also meets on the Moon (where the Imperial bureaucracy is located), most members representing {{an area of}} Earth or another planet, with other members representing constituencies not tied to any geographic place; one represents space pilots, for instance, and another districtless university women. [...] As in the British system, representatives need not live in their district or be an actual member of the non-geographical constituency. [...] Candidates for safe seats {{are determined by the}} central party office. [...] At the time depicted in the novel, extraterrestrials are not permitted to be members of the Assembly — although they may vote in elections for representatives — and Bonforte has pledged himself to remove this exclusion. [...] An afterword makes clear that he eventually does so, though his party subsequently loses power.|$|E

60|$|At length {{the time}} arrived for the <b>grand</b> <b>assembly</b> of the khans to be convened. The meeting was called, not at Karakorom, the capital, {{but at a}} central spot in the {{interior}} of the country, called Dilon Ildak. Such a spot was much more convenient than any town or city would have been for the place of meeting, on account of the great troops of horses and the herds of animals by which the khans were always accompanied in all their expeditions, and which made it necessary that, whenever any considerable number of them were to be convened, the place chosen should be suitable for a grand encampment, with extensive and fertile pasture-grounds extending all around.|$|E
60|$|All {{this took}} place, as {{has already been}} said, {{immediately}} after the great battle with Tayian, and before Temujin had been enthroned as emperor, or had received his new title of Genghis Khan. Indeed, Temujin, while making this expedition to Kashin in pursuit of Kushluk and Tukta Bey, had been somewhat uneasy {{at the loss of}} time which the campaign occasioned him, as he was anxious to go as soon as possible to Karakorom, in order to take the necessary measures there for arranging and consolidating his government. He accordingly now determined not to pursue the fugitives any farther, but to proceed at once to Karakorom, and postpone all farther operations against Kushluk and Tukta until the next season. So he went to Karakorom, and there, {{during the course of the}} winter, formed the constitution of his new empire, and made arrangements for convening a <b>grand</b> <b>assembly</b> of the khans the next spring, as related in the last chapter.|$|E
60|$|A solemn diet {{was ordered}} to {{assemble}} at Worms. Here were collected all the nobles of the empire, and before them King Richard was brought. It was a <b>grand</b> <b>assembly.</b> Upon a raised throne on the dais sat the emperor himself, and beside him and near him were the great feudatories of the empire, and {{along the sides of}} the walls were ranged in long rows the lesser barons. When the doors were opened and King Richard entered, the whole assembly, save the emperor, rose in respect to the captive monarch. Although pale from his long confinement, the proud air of Richard was in no way abated, and the eyes that had flashed so fearlessly upon the Saracens looked as sternly down the long lines of the barons of Germany. Of splendid stature and physique, King Richard was unquestionably the finest man of his time. He was handsome, with a frank face, but with a fierce and passionate eye. He wore his moustache with a short beard and closely-cut whisker. His short curly hair was cropped closely to his head, upon which he wore a velvet cap with gold coronet, while a scarlet robe lined with fur fell over his coat of mail, for the emperor had deemed it imprudent to excite the feeling of the assembly in favour of the prisoner by depriving him of the symbols of his rank.|$|E

60|$|On the {{following}} day after the address at the Guildhall, a <b>grand</b> <b>assembly</b> of all the lords, bishops, councilors, and officers of state was convened in Westminster. It was substantially a Parliament, though not a Parliament in form. The reason why it was not called as a Parliament in form was because Richard, having doubts, as he said, about the right of Edward to the throne, could not conscientiously advise that any public act should be performed in his name, and a Parliament could only be legally convened by summons from a king. Accordingly, this assembly was only an informal meeting of the peers of England and other great dignitaries of Church and State, {{with a view of}} consulting together to determine what should be done. Of course, it was all fully arranged and settled beforehand, among those who were in Richard's confidence, what the result of these deliberations was to be. The Duke of Buckingham, Richard's principal friend and supporter, managed the business at the meeting. The assembly consisted, of course, chiefly of the party of Richard's friends. The principal leaders of the parties opposed to him had been beheaded or shut up in prison; of the rest, some had fled, some had concealed themselves, and of the few who dared to show themselves at the meeting, there were none who had the courage, or perhaps I ought rather to say the imprudence and folly, to oppose any thing which Buckingham should undertake to do.|$|E
6000|$|One of {{the most}} {{prominent}} and distinguished of the senators, named Proculus, one who it seems had not been present among the other senators in attendance upon Romulus at the time when he disappeared, came forward one day before a <b>grand</b> <b>assembly</b> which had been convened for the purpose, and announced to them in the most solemn manner, that the spirit of Romulus had appeared to him in a visible form, and had assured him that the story which the other senators had told of the ascension of their chieftain to heaven in a flame of fire was really true. [...] "I was journeying," [...] said Proculus, [...] "in a solitary place, when Romulus appeared to me. At first I was exceedingly terrified. The form of the vision was taller than that of a mortal man, and it was clothed in armor {{of the most}} resplendent brightness. As soon as I had in some measure recovered my composure I spoke to it. 'Why,' said I, 'have you left us so suddenly? and especially why did you leave us at such a time, and in such a way, as to bring suspicion and reproach on the Roman senators?' 'I left you,' said he, 'because it pleased the gods to call me back again to heaven, whence I originally came. It was no longer necessary for me to remain on earth, for Rome is now established, and her future greatness and glory are sure. Go back to Rome and communicate this to the people. Tell them that if they continue industrious, virtuous, and brave, the time will come when their city will be the mistress of the world; and that I, no longer its king, am henceforth to be its tutelar divinity.'" ...|$|E
60|$|Sect. 157. Things of {{this world}} are in so {{constant}} a flux, that nothing remains long in the same state. Thus people, riches, trade, power, change their stations, flourishing mighty cities come to ruin, and prove in times neglected desolate corners, whilst other unfrequented places grow into populous countries, filled with wealth and inhabitants. But things not always changing equally, and private interest often keeping up customs and privileges, when the reasons of them are ceased, it often comes to pass, that in governments, where part of the legislative consists of representatives chosen by the people, that in tract of time this representation becomes very unequal and disproportionate to the reasons it was at first established upon. To what gross absurdities the following of custom, when reason has left it, may lead, we may be satisfied, when we see the bare name of a town, of which there remains {{not so much as}} the ruins, where scarce so much housing as a sheepcote, or more inhabitants than a shepherd is to be found, sends as many representatives to the <b>grand</b> <b>assembly</b> of law-makers, as a whole county numerous in people, and powerful in riches. This strangers stand amazed at, and every one must confess needs a remedy; tho' most think it hard to find one, because the constitution of the legislative being the original and supreme act of the society, antecedent to all positive laws in it, and depending wholly on the people, no inferior power can alter it. And therefore the people, when the legislative is once constituted, having, in such a government as we have been speaking of, no power to act as long as the government stands; this inconvenience is thought incapable of a remedy.|$|E
