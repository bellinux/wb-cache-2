40|$|Diesel {{particulate}} filters (DPF) are {{devices that}} physically capture diesel particulates {{to prevent their}} release to the atmosphere. Diesel particulate filters have seen widespread use in on- and off-road applications as an effective means for meeting increasingly stringent particle emissions regulations. Although the soot deposit can be removed by regeneration, the incombustible material - ash, primarily derived from metallic additives in the engine lubricant, accumulates in the DPF channels with the increasing vehicle mileage or equivalent running hours. Ash accumulation inside filter increases the flow restriction and reduces the <b>filter</b> <b>soot</b> storage capacity, which results in higher filter regeneration frequencies and larger engine fuel penalty. Combined with experimental observations, DPF models are built to investigate the fundamental mechanisms of DPF aging process. The DPF soot and ash loading model, based on porous media filtration theory, is applied to understand the soot deposition across the substrate wall with soot and ash cake layer formation. DPF models are also used to investigate the process of ash transport and catalyst deactivation with increasing ash load level. DPF ash aging is found to have negative effect on passive regeneration due to the catalyst deactivation and diffusion resistance of ash cake layer. Besides, at given amount of ash load, the effects of ash spatial distribution on DPF performance are studied via simulation. It is found that the ash end plug has significant influences on DPF pressure drop while ash radial and axial distributions have minor effects. At known ash and substrate property, DPF performance can be optimized according the sensitivity map developed from this study. DPF model is beneficial to interpret the experimental observations and it is applied to predict the effects of certain factors, like flow rate and deposit level, on DPF performance. At the same time, modeling results are useful in optimizing {{the design of the}} combined engine-aftertreatment-lubricant system for future diesel engines and in understanding the requirements for robust aftertreatment systems. by Yujun Wang.

40|$|The main {{target of}} this thesis {{is the study}} of coupled {{transfer}} and reaction phenomena that take place in Catalyzed Diesel Particulate Filters. The study is based on measurements and simulation tools of the transient behavior of particulate filters and oxidation catalysts, which have been developed by Laboratory of Applied Thermodynamics. The examination of catalyzed filters begins with their filtration efficiency and pressure drop behavior during the loading conditions. The new semi-empirical mathematical model of filtration efficiency simulation is presented for first time, and validated against various operating conditions. The presence of washcoat loading increases the filtration efficiency and the pressure drop, due to the decrease of the filter’s porosity. At high flow rate conditions and large mean pore size substrate the amount of soot collected in the wall is larger, affecting the passive regeneration behavior of the filter. The Catalyzed Diesel Particulate Filter (CDPF) and the Diesel Oxidation Catalyst (DOC) were examined on their gaseous oxidation performance of diesel exhaust. At steady - state and high flow rate operating conditions the CDPF is more effective at the HC oxidation performance. At transient conditions the DOC is more effective to the gaseous oxidation performance. The study which follows examines the low-temperature passive regeneration behavior of catalyzed filters. At 330 °C the systems with DOC upstream are more effective during regeneration, due to the increased NO 2 concentration, which acts directly on the soot layer. At 400 °C the regeneration is based on the NO 2 diffusion phenomena. The study of high temperature - active regeneration performance follows. If the <b>filter</b> <b>soot</b> loading is controlled at levels below a carefully selected threshold, e. g. in the range of 8 g/l, via the regeneration control system, then the single CDPF system and the DOC+CDPF one exhibit comparable efficiencies and maximum temperatures, during the active regeneration with post injection. The study is completed with the evaluation of a zoned catalyzed filter, with axial zones of different activity. A catalyzed filter with larger precious metal loading at its front part is examined experimentally and computationally. The CDPF with the larger amount of Pt at its front part can replace the uniform coated one, with a great advantage at the cost. ...|$|E

As generally the Diesel exhaust temperatures are below the soot light-off temperature, passive regeneration is not possible.

In contrast, the same filter without such a coating can only be partially regenerated. Moreover, considerable amounts of CO are formed. The La 0. 8 Ce 0. 2 MnO 3 coating is shown to have excellent temperature shock resistance and thermo-chemical stability.

40|$|The {{original}} turbulent {{energy cascade}} of eddy dissipation concept (EDC) {{has been extended}} to the LES framework, assuming that {{there is always a}} structure level on which the typical length scale is equivalent to the filter width of large eddy simulation (LES). The velocity scale on this structure level could be calculated from the sub-grid scale (SGS) kinetic energy, provided that this kinetic energy transport equation is solved in LES. All other quantities would thus be calculated on this structure level according to the general formulations from the original turbulent energy cascade. Based on this known structure level, the total kinetic energy and dissipation rate could be estimated with the integral length scale being assumed to be equivalent to the characteristic length of fire plume. Consequently, the Kolmogorov time scale and the integral time scale could also be calculated and then applied in the soot model development. The laminar based smoke point soot model (SPSM) is also extended to the LES framework. The <b>filtered</b> <b>soot</b> mass fraction transport equation is solved with the thermophoresis term neglected. The <b>filtered</b> <b>soot</b> formation rate is treated using the concept of partially stirred reactor (PaSR). This rate is thus associated with the laminar based soot formation rate substituted with the filtered properties through the expression of K. Note that in K the soot formation chemical time scale is assumed to be proportional to the laminar smoke point height (SPH) while its turbulent mixing time is supposed to be the. geometric mean of the Kolmogorov time scale and integral time scale. Furthermore, a new soot oxidation model is developed by imitating the gas phase combustion model, i. e. EDC, as the soot particles are assumed to be the solid phase of the fuel. Note that the turbulent mixing time scale for soot oxidation has been chosen to be the same as soot formation. The soot formation and oxidation models are coupled to treat the effect of soot on the fuel distribution and energy transport. The approaches to calculate flame height, radiative fraction, and surface emissive power (SEP) have also been developed for sooty flames. The models and approaches mentioned above are implemented into FireFOAM, which is a fully compressible solver based on the platform of OpenFOAM. A series of fire scenarios, involved with different fuels including methanol, methane, heptane and toluene, and with different scales ranging from 30 em to 56 m, are performed for validation studies.

40|$|AIR+ESO:LLI:MTS:ABO:PVEThis study {{reports a}} {{mechanistic}} {{study of the}} soot oxidation on Yttria-Stabilized Zirconia (YSZ), a nonreducible oxide with intrinsic bulk oxygen mobility. Temperature-Programmed Oxidation (TPO) and isotope exchange experiments demonstrate the key role of bulk oxygen species in the oxidation process. When "intimate" soot/YSZ contact is achieved after in situ carbon deposition via propylene cracking, lattice oxygen ions are the predominant species involved in the oxidation reaction. Based on isotopic TPO experiments performed with different oxygen partial pressures in "tight" contact mode and oxygen exchange measurements, it is proposed that the ignition of the soot oxidation on YSZ {{can be described as}} a fuel-cell-type electrochemical mechanism at the nanometric scale. The efficiency of this electrochemical process seems to depend both on the YSZ/soot contact and on the oxygen partial pressure. In addition, YSZ porous membranes were fabricated in order to simulate porous walls of YSZ-based DPFs.

40|$|The eddy {{dissipation}} concept (EDC) {{is extended}} to the large eddy simulation (LES) framework following the same logic of the turbulent energy cascade as originally proposed by Magnussen but {{taking into account the}} distinctive roles of the sub-grid scale turbulence. A series of structure levels are assumed to exist under the filter width “Δ” in the turbulent energy cascade which spans from the Kolmogorov to the integral scale. The total kinetic energy and its dissipation rate are expressed using the sub-grid scale (SGS) quantities. Assuming infinitely fast chemistry, the filtered reaction rate in the EDC is controlled by the turbulent mixing rate between the fine structures at Kolmogorov scales and the surrounding fluids. In order to extend the laminar smoke point soot model (SPSM) to LES, the partially stirred reactor (PaSR) concept is used to relate the <b>filtered</b> <b>soot</b> formation rate to the soot chemical time scale, which is assumed to be proportional to the laminar smoke point height (SPH) of the fuel. The turbulent mixing time scale for soot is computed as a geometric mean of the Kolmogorov and integral time scale.

40|$|The new {{emission}} control regulations for the diesel engines impose less soot particulate emissions. The particulates are dangerous and very harmful for the enviroment. Today, the CO and HC emissions of the diesel engines are already very low but the NOx and particulates emissions are still high. These are {{the goal of}} the modern {{emission control}} technologies. The reduction of the NOx and particulates emitted can be reduced with improvements in the engine design, fuel, oil and additive technologies and with exhaust after treatment. The <b>soot</b> <b>filters</b> collect the particulates from the diesel engine exhaust gas. The filter efficiency can be over 90 % and the durability is satisfactory. When the trap's soot load is high the regeneration is necessary to retain the efficiency and to avoid the filter failure. The regeneration methods must be further developed in order to avoid problems cause from the heat released during the combustion of the soot. These problems must be completely solved, for the soot traps to become a common used emission control device in passenger cars. Today, <b>soot</b> <b>filters</b> in passenger cars are used only from PSA, but the emission control regulations in the future will impose every vehicle with a diesel engine to have reduced particulates emissions. That will lead in the wide use of <b>soot</b> <b>filters.</b> The design and improvement of soot traps can be much more easier, more efficiently and with less cost with the use of <b>soot</b> <b>filter</b> simulation software. Many tests and modifications can be made, avoiding the experimental cost. Besides, many parameters of the filter function can be computed and analysed faster and reliably. The diploma thesis with title 'Modeling of ceramic soot filters' was conducted within the purposes of the research project 'Development of computational tools for exhaust after-treatment systems design optimization' for PSA Peugeot Citroen, at the Laboratory of Thermodynamics and Thermal Engines, of the Department of Mechanical and Industrial Engineering. The goal of the diploma thesis is the presentation of the basics of soot traps and the calculations conducted with the <b>soot</b> <b>filter</b> simulation software Catwall. The validation of the model as well as to find the points that need to be improved {{are a part of the}} thesis.

40|$|The great {{challenge}} for next years concerning the emission of diesel engines {{is to develop}} diesel particle filters (DPF) with catalytic regeneration systems. This thesis {{is focused on the}} global understanding of the diesel soot oxidation on sintered metal filters (SMF). Platinum is studied as reference catalyst. The first objective is to determine which of platinum quantity, platinum particle size, or platinum location exhibits the preponderant influence on the catalytic soot oxidation {{in the case of a}} model fuel borne catalyst (FBC) system. The second objective is to determine if it is possible to achieve the same catalytic effect on a platinum coated filter as the one obtained by using a FBC. The answers to these objectives should help to analyze the improvement potential of coated filters and FBCs in future. To answer these objectives, a method was developed to calculate the kinetic parameters of the thermal and the catalytic soot oxidation from temperature ramp experiments. The global activation energy of the catalytic soot oxidation does not differ from the one of the thermal soot oxidation. The catalytic effect was thus defined as the pre-exponential factor ratio between the catalytic and the thermal soot oxidation with the other kinetic parameters being kept constant, following an oxygen transfer mechanism. Temperature ramp experiments were performed in a thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) device for platinum-soot powder samples. A reactor was also designed and built to investigate the catalytic soot oxidation on sintered metal filters. Conversion curves obtained from reactor experiments do not allow to calculate kinetic parameters. For this case the catalytic effect was related to the temperature difference for 50 % soot conversion between the thermal and the catalytic soot oxidation. Six different soot sources were used along this thesis. The kinetic parameters of each soot source were first investigated in the TGA device. Soot produced by pyrolyzing toluene exhibits the closest structure and composition to the reference diesel soot. Its oxidation behavior is also the closest to the reference diesel soot. But all soot sources were found to have reasonably similar composition, structure and thermal behavior to diesel soot. The catalytic soot oxidation on established DPF technologies was first investigated. Platinum-doped soot produced via FBC shows a catalytic effect, increasing with the platinum-to-soot mass ratio. But platinum coated filters do not display any catalytic effect. It was decided to deepen these results by investigating the catalytic effect of platinum on the soot oxidation with artificial platinum-doped soot samples, and with artificial platinum-soot contact scenarios on SMF. In the case of a model FBC, the catalytic effect was observed to increase linearly with the platinum-to-soot mass ratio, and the initial platinum specific surface area. This reinforces the theory of the oxygen transfer mechanism. Platinum particles sinter during the oxidation, but as the soot was itself consumed, this did not affect the platinum surface area related to the soot mass. By investigating the influence of the initial platinum particle size for soot samples containing same platinum quantity, a size optimum was found at a mean diameter of 3 nm. However, this size effect is low compared to the influence of the platinum quantity. The platinum location, embedded in the soot agglomerate or present on the soot surface does not influence the catalytic effect. The catalytic effect of three configurations modeling three contact possibilities on SMF was investigated. <b>Filtering</b> platinum and <b>soot</b> aerosol consecutively does only exhibit a marginal catalytic effect. But <b>filtering</b> platinum and <b>soot</b> aerosol simultaneously exhibits the same catalytic effect as <b>filtering</b> a platinum-doped <b>soot</b> aerosol. It suggests that it is possible to enhance the catalytic effect of coated filters by increasing uniformly the platinum particle density in the soot cake. The results of this thesis suggest that the use of platinum as FBC is limited by the cost of platinum, as the catalytic effect was found to be linear with the platinum-to-soot mass ratio. The only possibility to improve the performances of a platinum FBC for a fixed platinum quantity is to optimize the platinum particle size in the obtained platinum-doped soot, however with low influence on the catalytic effect. The cost problems of platinum FBC could principally be avoided by attaching a fixed platinum quantity on a coated SMF. The contact between <b>filtered</b> <b>soot</b> and platinum is today too low to establish a catalytic effect on a coated filter. However, it has been shown that if all platinum particles are uniformly distributed in the soot cake (simultaneously filtration), the catalytic effect is the same as for a platinum FBC. The enhancing of the platinum density in the soot on a coated filter is thus a great research challenge for next years...|$|R

40|$|A diesel {{particulate}} filter (DPF) is an aftertreatment device used to remove hazardous particulate matter (PM) from diesel engine exhaust. Modem emission restrictions have limited the acceptable amount of PM output by diesel engines {{to the extent that}} a filtration strategy, {{such as the use of}} a DPF, is necessary. Diesel PM is comprised primarily by black carbon soot. Once trapped in the <b>filter,</b> the <b>soot</b> can be oxidized into CO 2 and pass out of the exhaust system during what is referred to as regeneration. Metallic lubricant additive derived compounds, which make up a small fraction of PM, cannot be oxidized and remain inside the DPF until regular maintenance calls for the removal and cleaning of the filter. The buildup of ash increases the pressure drop across the filter, resulting in a direct fuel penalty to the engine. The oxidation of soot can be carried out actively at high temperatures or passively at low temperatures with the aid of a catalyst. Active regeneration requires more energy than passive regeneration because the stream of exhaust gas must be heated to a higher temperature. However, catalysts are expensive, and therefore there is a significant additional capital cost associated wit...|$|R

The <b>filter</b> removes <b>soot</b> particles, which are quasi-permanently burned using NO 2, which is produced from motor NO in the oxidation catalyst.

Due to its small vapour pressure gaseous H 2 SO 4 can form nano particles by homogeneous nucleation with water vapour. Nano particles can intrude the lung and hence could be very harmful. Within the present work H 2 SO 4 was measured by chemical ionisation mass spectrometry in the exhaust of a diesel engine.

In car and truck applications the <b>soot</b> <b>filters</b> are cleaned by burning the particulate matter off of the filter. However, ash will not be burned off and accumulates in the filter. In the case of high-ash loads, like sea ships, a <b>soot</b> <b>filter</b> is not applicable, because the filters cannot be cleaned properly. The goal of the research was to develop a technology to reduce particulate matter that is fuel insensitive. In this thesis such a technology is described, tested and simulated for high-ash applications. The patented technology is based on coating particulate matter with water, and subsequently capturing by an electrostatic precipitator (ESP). In the present experimental set-up this was a two-stage ESP, which has a robust construction and a reduced risk of physical contact between the electrodes at different potential. The water-coated particles will flow off the collection plates, therefore allowing continuous operation of the ESP. The water stream needs to be cleaned before it is discharged in the surface waters. The required cleaning technology, however, is similar to the cleaning technologies used in sea water scrubbers. It is proven that the technology is capable of removing 80 % of particulate matter, including the fraction of particulate matter smaller than 1 micrometer in (mobility) diameter.

Prior to soot loading, {{the sample}} was hydro-thermally aged at 850 degrees C. Flow reactor measurements were performed under various reaction conditions to {{examine the impact of}} soot in an SCR-coated diesel particulate filter (DPF) on standard SCR, fast SCR, NH 3 oxidation, and NO oxidation. In the presence of soot, NOx conversion was slightly lower at 200 - 300 degrees C due to the blocking of active sites. However, at higher temperatures, the NOx conversion was somewhat higher with soot, indicating that soot more strongly inhibited the oxidation of NH 3 than the SCR reaction. When feeding equal amounts of NO and NO 2 together with NH 3, ammonium nitrates on the sample were formed. The presence of soot significantly decreased the formation or the stability of ammonium nitrate, resulting in higher conversion with soot. To further understand this interesting aspect, ammonium nitrate formation and decomposition experiments using model Cu/BEA catalyst with and without soot were performed. It was observed that less N 2 O was formed in the presence of soot, and this in combination with COx formation during the ammonium nitrate formation step suggested that soot reacted with the ammonium nitrates, and we propose that this occurs on CuO species {{on the outside of the}} zeolite particles...|$|R

5000|$|With the {{addition}} of a diesel particulate <b>filter</b> to capture <b>soot,</b> and on some vehicle models, a urea-based exhaust aftertreatment system, the engines were described by Volkswagen as being as clean as or cleaner than US and Californian requirements, while providing good performance. In reality, the system failed to combine good fuel economy with compliant [...] emissions, and VW chose around 2006 to program the Engine Control Unit to switch from good fuel economy and high [...] emissions to low-emission compliant mode when it detected an emissions test, particularly for the EA 189 engine. This caused the engine to emit [...] levels above limits in daily operation, but comply with US [...] standards only when being tested, constituting a defeat device. The newspaper Der Spiegel reported that at least 30 people at management level in VW knew about the deceit for years; VW denied this in 2015.|$|R
40|$|The {{effect of}} exhaust gas {{components}} {{on the performance}} of sulfated and unsulfated Cu/V/K/Cl/Ti based catalytic <b>filters</b> in <b>soot</b> combustion was studied. Soot produced by a gas-oil burner was first captured on ceramic filters supporting the catalyst, then burned off by temperature programmed oxidation in a flow microreactor with different reactant gas compositions, i. e., O 2, O 2 -N 2, O 2 -H 2 O, and O 2 -NO-H 2 O in N 2. The catalytic filter significantly promoted the soot combustion in O 2 -N 2 flow. The addition of NO or H 2 O or both further increased the soot reactivity over the catalytic filter. At lower temperature, this increase was improved by the presence of NO, while at higher temperature by that of H 2 O. However, such components had no effect on the uncatalyzed soot combustion. An exchange between chlorine and sulfur in the catalyst active species was due to severe sulfation of the catalytic filter. The catalyst was deactivated by the presence of sulfur oxides in the exhaust gases. Filter sulfation yielded a significant loss of catalyst activity. The enhancement of soot catalytic oxidation rate in the presence of NO may be due to carbon oxidation by NO 2, which was in turn generated by NO oxidation on the catalyst, while that in the presence of H 2 O could be due to the catalytic activation of the steam gasification of carbon on similar catalyst.

40|$|Closed access. This {{article was}} {{published}} in the journal Plasma Chemistry and Plasma Processing [© Springer] and the definitive version is available at: [URL] novel method for the removal of soot from a diesel particulate filter using pulsed electric discharges is presented. High voltage pulses of between 18 and 25 kV of nano to microsecond duration and with pulse energies of typically 100 – 200 mJ were applied to the filter via a series spark gap. Initial slow erosion of the soot layer proceeds via the formation of microdischarges. Subsequent spark discharges removed the accumulated soot more effectively from a larger <b>filter</b> volume. Average <b>soot</b> removal rates of * 0. 1 – 0. 2 g/min were achieved at 50 Hz breakdown frequency by optimizing both electrode geometry and breakdown voltage. On-engine long term testing of the technology showed soot removal by pulsed discharge to be reliable, efficient and uniform; a total of 100 g of soot was deposited and removed over 18 filter regeneration cycles...|$|R
40|$|Dielectric {{properties}} of La 1 -xCexMnO 3 perovskites are investigated {{in order to}} assess the heating behaviour in the wider context of the use of perovskite coatings in microwave assisted <b>soot</b> <b>filter</b> regeneration. Dielectric permittivities in the radio and microwave region for these perovskites were determined at room temperature. The dielectric constant and dielectric loss are related to ionic conduction at low frequencies, while at microwave frequencies storage and loss mainly proceed through reorientation of molecular dipoles. The dielectric constant rises for a higher degree of La substitution by Ce, which is explained by an increase of the number of cation/oxygen vacancies. Concurrently the mean perovskite crystallite size decreases, which is possibly related to defect formation. The dielectric constant declines for x >= 0. 3, along with the formation of a separate, low dielectric permittivity CeO 2 phase. The La-Ce-Mn perovskites are further shown to exhibit a high thermal stability during repeated heating/cooling, cycles...|$|R
40|$|The {{regeneration}} {{performance of}} a diesel particulate filter (DPF) wash-coated with nanometric ceria particles was studied focusing {{on the effect of}} the soot-catalyst contact. The pore size distribution of the catalyst-loaded filter did not show significant differences with respect to that of the bare filter. Furthermore, the catalyst was highly dispersed inside the <b>filter</b> walls. The <b>soot</b> load was varied, thus investigating different conditions of sootceria contact. At the lowest soot load explored, the deep penetration of soot particles into the macro-pores of the filter walls and the consequent close touch with the catalyst result in a large fraction of soot burned via catalytic path at low temperatures. At the highest soot load explored, a rather thick soot cake layer is also formed on top of the catalytic walls of the filter. The sook cake is substantially segregated from the catalyst and, as such, is oxidized via thermal path at high temperatures...|$|R
40|$|Thermal {{treatments}} {{are the most}} used methods to remediate contaminated solids. However, they may seriously damage the otherwise recoverable matrices, especially when mild operating conditions cannot be used. Microwaves recently raised as a powerful tool in industrial engineering for their ability, among other advantages, to offer a selected heating, thus allowing to treat and remove only the undesired components of a matrix. This work approaches the microwave assisted thermal treatments of waste from a physical–chemical point of view. Two recovering operations have been performed, respectively, on a soil contaminated by volatile organic compounds and on a ceramic <b>filter</b> spoiled by <b>soot,</b> using two specially designed prototypes, both realized on pre-pilot scale. The heat and mass transfer balances have then been analyzed in their more general form, and terms related {{to the use of}} microwaves outlined. Solutions of the differential equations have been applied to interpret the effects of microwaves on rate and efficiency of the remediation processes. doi: 10. 1016 /j. jhazmat. 2011. 07. 12...|$|R
40|$|The goal of {{the present}} {{technology}} development was {{to increase the efficiency}} of internal combustion engines while minimizing the energy penalty of meeting emissions regulations. This objective was achieved through experimentation and the development of advanced combustion regimes and emission control strategies, coupled with advanced petroleum and non-petroleum fuel formulations. To meet the goals of the project, it was necessary to improve the efficiency of expansion work extraction, and this required optimized combustion phasing and minimized in-cylinder heat transfer losses. To minimize fuel used for diesel particulate <b>filter</b> (DPF) regeneration, <b>soot</b> emissions were also minimized. Because of the complex nature of optimizing production engines for real-world variations in fuels, temperatures and pressures, the project applied high-fidelity computing and high-resolution engine experiments synergistically to create and apply advanced tools (i. e., fast, accurate predictive models) developed for low-emission, fuel-efficient engine designs. The companion experiments were conducted using representative single- and multi-cylinder automotive and truck diesel engines...|$|R
40|$|Exhaust gas {{recirculation}} (EGR) is currently {{widely used in}} commercial diesel engines to provide an effective solution in reducing the levels of nitrogen oxide (NOX) emissions. However, this currently comes {{at the expense of}} an exponential increase in particulate matter (PM) emissions resulting directly from the dilution effect (i. e. reduction in oxygen availability), as well as a further penalty arising from the recirculation of the exhaust emissions such as soot and hydrocarbons. In our earlier work it was observed that filtered EGR (FEGR) was able to {{play a significant role in}} controlling the soot recirculation penalty and thus improve the overall NOX/soot trade-off. In order to further our understanding of the effect of recirculated exhaust gases and in particular recirculated soot and hydrocarbon (HC), comparisons were made between standard EGR, FEGR and pure nitrogen (N 2), a direct cleaner replacement of the exhaust gas. When implementing FEGR, a diesel oxidation catalyst (DOC) and diesel particulate filter (DPF) were introduced into the exhaust to not only <b>filter</b> the <b>soot</b> particulates but reduce the recirculation of HC which can play a role in particulate surface growth. It was observed that the recirculated HC species and soot particles (especially at high load and EGR ratios) play a role in promoting the production and growth of further particles within the combustion chamber. Similarly, by comparing at the same O 2 intake concentration as that of FEGR and introducing N 2 as the EGR replacement gas, it was possible to correlate the increase in engine-out mass of soot with EGR to the recirculation of soot particles, HC species as well as the presence of H 2 O and CO 2...|$|R
