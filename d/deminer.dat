5|$|Concerned at {{the expense}} of {{maintaining}} the Falkland Islands in an era of budget cuts, the UK again considered transferring sovereignty to Argentina in the early Thatcher government. Substantive sovereignty talks again ended by 1981, and the dispute escalated with passing time. In April 1982, the disagreement became an armed conflict when Argentina invaded the Falklands and other British territories in the South Atlantic, briefly occupying them until a UK expeditionary force retook the territories in June. After the war, the United Kingdom expanded its military presence, building RAF Mount Pleasant and increasing the size of its garrison. The war also left some 117 minefields containing nearly 20,000 mines of various types, including anti-vehicle and anti-personnel mines. Due to the large number of <b>deminer</b> casualties, initial attempts to clear the mines ceased in 1983.|$|E

50|$|Deploying African giant pouched rats {{to detect}} landmines has several {{advantages}} over conventional {{methods such as}} using special machines or <b>deminers</b> with metal detectors.|$|R
50|$|The MDR {{are most}} {{efficient}} {{when they are}} integrated with manual deminers and machines, whereby the collective strengths of each asset are utilized to maximize productivity. The MDR olfactory ability can be subject to external factors influencing its reliability, such as high temperature, humidity and thick vegetation. Hence early working hours on dry days are the preferred working conditions {{in order to ensure}} the MDR reliability and mitigate external factors. Ground preparation, such as the removal of vegetation is a requirement for all methods for detecting landmines, whether it is an animal or a <b>deminer</b> with a metal detector. Vegetation needs to be removed to allow the dogs and MDR to get their noses sufficiently close to the ground and similarly to allow the <b>deminer</b> to get the metal detector search-head close to the ground.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{recent developments}} in low-cost, comfortable protective clothing and equipment for <b>deminers,</b> and some methods being used to reduce accidents. The principal design threat is accidental explosion of an anti-personnel blast mine near the <b>deminer’s</b> hand during prodding or probing operations. This type of accident is relatively common in Afghanistan, but not necessarily in other regions. Analysis of accident records from Afghanistan provides useful data for design of head protection and body armour. Hand protection {{is an essential part}} of any prodder or probe. Several accidents also occur due to <b>deminers</b> stepping or falling on AP blast mines, but cost-effective protection for these incidents is not yet feasible. Blast mine protection also provides useful protection from other threats: skin lesions from thorns, metal and sharp rocks; falling rocks and masonry; eye damage from thorns or barbed wire; and even sunburn...|$|R
50|$|CSHD {{has set up}} a Landmine Relief Fund {{to support}} the {{demining}} process. The main aim of the Fund is to seek contributions from external organizations to finance the cost required to maintain the demining team. It costs approximately $9,000USD per month to maintain a demining team in the field, with the <b>deminers</b> paid up to $250USD per month. In 2011, CSHD had only 1 demining team, comprising 18 <b>deminers</b> working in the field and 7 support staff. It has been a continuing challenge for CSHD to raise funds.|$|R

5000|$|... ==Landmine clearing== Having laid {{thousands}} of landmines as a soldier, Aki Ra found employment as a <b>deminer</b> with the UN in 1991. After leaving UNMAS in 1992, he continued disarming and removing mines in his community. Having no demining tools, {{he used a}} knife, a hoe, a Leatherman and a stick. He would defuse the landmines and UXOs (Unexploded Ordnance) he found in small villages and bring home the empty casings. Sometimes he would sell them as scrap to help fund his work.|$|E
50|$|The rats {{are able}} to search the ground more quickly (when {{compared}} to a manual <b>deminer)</b> and therefore rapidly confirm {{the presence or absence}} of mines. This process is termed, technical survey (TS); the gathering of evidence through use of mine detection rats. The TS process also allows a more precise definition of the minefield boundaries and can release or cancel land outside these boundaries that were initially thought to be contaminated. This TS process is a more cost effective method to release mined areas as opposed to conducting full clearance over the entire area. For APOPO operations the rats are a key part to this process.|$|E
50|$|In {{addition}} to the existing survey teams HALO is seeking to train and deploy 200+ <b>deminers</b> {{by the end of}} 2013 and aim to grow the programme to 1,500+ national staff by the end of 2015.|$|R
50|$|The PROM-1 is {{difficult}} to render safe because its fuze becomes unstable after being exposed to weather for several years. Most <b>deminers</b> therefore recommend that this mine is destroyed in situ by detonating an explosive charge next to it.Usually (though not always) trip-wires measuring around 20 feet (6 meters) in length are fitted to this mine {{in order to increase}} its activation area. When tracking trip-wires back to their source, <b>deminers</b> must keep in mind that other landmines may have been planted along its length. It is all too easy to concentrate on following a trip-wire back to its source, forgetting that there could be PMA-3, PMN or similar blast mines lying buried underneath.|$|R
50|$|The {{end of the}} war left past {{conflict}} {{zones of}} 2,061sq.km heavily contaminated with approximately 1.6 million land mines. By January 2012, <b>deminers</b> employed by the Sri Lankan army and 8 foreign funded agencies had cleared 1,934sq.km leaving about 127sq.km yet to be cleared.|$|R
5000|$|Another {{version of}} the SB-33 called the SB-33AR (AR {{standing}} for Anti-Rimozione, [...] "Counter-Removal") exists. It looks identical to the standard SB-33 mine. However, the SB-33AR has an integral anti-handling device specifically designed to injure deminers. The anti-handling device in an SB-33AR consists of a mercury tilt switch and battery connected to the detonator. When an SB-33AR is moved a few degrees from the horizontal (i.e. when a <b>deminer</b> lifts it), it detonates, blowing the victim's hand off. Generally, {{a small number of}} SB-33AR landmines would be sown inside a minefield containing standard SB-33 mines in order to hinder and deter any attempt to conduct demining operations.|$|E

Additionally, an M5 anti-lift device has been screwed into another fuze well, hidden under the mine. An inexperienced <b>deminer</b> might detect and render safe the pull-fuze, but then be killed when he lifted the mine, triggering the M5 pressure-release firing device underneath. The lower diagram shows two anti-tank landmines connected by a cord attached to the upper mine's carrying handle. The cord is attached to a pull fuze installed in a secondary fuze well in the bottom mine.|$|E

The Landmine Relief Fund has had a representative in the country working with CSHD. Generous support has also been provided by film producer Richard Fitoussi and film director Tom Shadyac.|$|E
50|$|According to Landmine Monitor in 2003, 21 new {{mine and}} UXO {{casualties}} {{were recorded in}} Nagorno-Karabakh, including nine people killed and twelve people injured.17 Casualties increased significantly {{in the first six}} months of 2004, with 30 new mine/UXO casualties recorded; eleven people were killed and nineteen injured, including three children. New landmine and UXO casualties had been decreasing since the ceasefire in 1994. In 1995, there were 86 casualties, 64 in 1996, 25 in 1997, 16 in 1998, and 30 in 1999.19 There were fourteen casualties (five killed and nine injured) in 2000, nineteen casualties (four killed and fifteen injured) in 2001, and seventeen casualties (all injured) in 2002. According to HALO, the increasing casualty numbers are the result of record harvests produced in recent years and a greater investment in agriculture. As farmers try to increase their agricultural boundaries, more suspected mined areas are being ploughed—despite advice from HALO and the government, and the presence of danger mine signs. Most incidents involve antivehicle mines. The number of annual incidents per capita in Nagorno-Karabakh is far higher than other heavily mine-affected countries such as Cambodia or Afghanistan. The thirty new casualties in 2004 represent 2.5 people for every 10,000 inhabitants.In 2004, 34 new mine/UXO casualties, including ten people killed and 24 injured, were reported in 25 incidents; another nine people were involved in the incidents but did not suffer physical injuries.25 At least three of the casualties were children. This represents a further significant increase from the 21 new mine/UXO casualties recorded in 2003. Of the 25 incidents in 2004, fourteen were caused by antivehicle mines, seven by antipersonnel mines and four by UXO. In 2004, one <b>deminer</b> was injured during mine clearance operations. http://www.icbl.org/lm/2004/nagorno-karabakh.html#fn9466In 2005, one person was killed and three people were injured in five mine/UXO incidents to June; one other person did not suffer physical injuries.|$|E

50|$|Anti-handling devices {{detonate}} {{the mine}} if someone attempts to lift, shift or disarm it. The {{intention is to}} hinder <b>deminers</b> by discouraging any attempts to clear minefields. There is a degree of overlap between the function of a boobytrap and an anti-handling device insofar as some mines have optional fuze pockets into which standard pull or pressure-release boobytrap firing devices can be screwed. Alternatively, some mines may mimic a standard design, but actually be specifically intended to kill <b>deminers,</b> such as the MC-3 and PMN-3 variants of the PMN mine. Anti-handling devices {{can be found on}} both anti-personnel mines and anti-tank mines, either {{as an integral part of}} their design or as improvised add-ons. For this reason, the standard render safe procedure for mines is often to destroy them on site without attempting to lift them.|$|R
50|$|Disarm is a {{documentary}} film which spans a dozen countries {{to look at}} how, despite a global ban, millions of antipersonnel landmines continue to claim victims daily in more than eighty countries. Defined as a conventional weapon, landmines inflict destruction upon civilian populations for decades after the initial conflict has ended. Disarm juxtaposes government and public opinion- that of diplomats, mine victims, <b>deminers,</b> soldiers, campaigners and aid workers- to explore the issues that both hinder and further {{the case against the}} weapon. Visually stunning, Disarm features harrowing footage smuggled out of isolated nation of Burma, scenes from war-ravaged Colombia and Iraq, never-before-seen helmet camera footage shot by Afghan and Bosnian <b>deminers,</b> unprecedented access into warehouses stockpiling millions of Soviet-made mines, and insightful comments by outspoken Nobel Peace Laureate Jody Williams. Looking beyond landmines, Disarm offers a contemporary, intelligent and critical investigation into how weapons systems, war, and the way it is waged are being redefined in the 21st century with devastating consequences.|$|R
