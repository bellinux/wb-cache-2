40|$|The U. S. Census Bureau is {{investigating}} adaptive Nonresponse Follow-Up (NRFU) strategies for single unit {{businesses in the}} 2017 Economic Census. These collection protocols require a suite of viable alternative procedures that can be implemented. With business surveys, the majority of cognitive research and nonresponse <b>follow-up</b> <b>procedures</b> focus on collection methods that obtain valid response data from the larger businesses, and there is relatively little quantitative or qualitative research for small businesses. Moreover, the contact methods for small businesses are often constrained by budget limitations. Business programs at the U. S. Census Bureau rely on mailed reminder letters and supplemental promotional materials, with options for certified and bulk mailings. To explore the benefits and disadvantages of the proposed alternative nonresponse <b>follow-up</b> <b>procedures</b> for small businesses, we conducted a field experiment embedded in the 2014 Annual Survey of Manufactures, an annual program that has similar data collection procedures and sampling units as the Economic Census.

40|$|PURPOSE: Breast cancer <b>follow-up</b> <b>procedures</b> after primary {{treatment}} {{are still a}} controversial issue. Aim {{of this study was}} to investigate, through a web-based survey, surveillance methodologies selected by Italian oncologists in everyday clinical practice. METHODS: Referents of Italian medical oncology units were invited to participate to the study via e-mail through the SurveyMonkey website. Participants were asked how, in their institution, exams of disease staging and follow-up are planned in asymptomatic women and if surveillance continues beyond the 5 th year. RESULTS: Between February and May 2013, 125 out of 233 (53. 6 %) invited referents of Italian medical oncology units agreed to participate in the survey. Ninety-seven (77. 6 %) referents state that modalities of breast cancer follow-up are planned according to the risk of disease progression at diagnosis and only 12 (9. 6 %) oncology units apply the minimal <b>follow-up</b> <b>procedures</b> according to international guidelines. Minimal follow-up is never applied in high risk asymptomatic women. Ninety-eight (78. 4 %) oncology units continue follow-up in all patients beyond 5 years. CONCLUSIONS: Our survey shows that 90. 4 % of participating Italian oncology units declare they do not apply the minimal breast cancer <b>follow-up</b> <b>procedures</b> after {{primary treatment}} in asymptomatic women, as suggested by national and international guidelines. Interestingly, about 80. 0 % of interviewed referents performs the so called "tailored follow-up", high intensity for high risk, low intensity for low risk patients.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{evaluate}} the long-term efficacy and prognosis of hysteroscopic resection and coagulation of the base of endometrial polyps with focal atypia in fertile women with or without progestin suppression. STUDY DESIGN: We conducted a quasi-randomized trial in which conservative treatment was offered to 21 patients who had endometrial polyps with focal atypia and a surrounding normal endometrium. The polyps were analyzed separately from their bases. Random biopsy specimens were taken from 4 standard places of the endometrium. RESULTS: Eighteen women (10 women with an intrauterine device and 8 women with no intrauterine device) completed the <b>follow-up</b> <b>procedure.</b> After 5 years, we found no difference in the 2 groups regarding recurrence of atypical polyps. CONCLUSION: Conservative resectoscopic treatment may be considered in fertile women with atypical polyps if polyp base and surrounding endometrium are benign.

40|$|Purpose: Ambulatory {{chemotherapy}} {{is patient}} friendly but {{may result in}} toxicity-induced unscheduled hospitalizations (TIUHs). This emerging issuemay increase health care costs. Westudied the cost effectiveness of a hospital-homemonitoring programbasedon sys-tematic iterative telephone calls after chemotherapy. Patients and Methods: We retrospectively evaluated the rates of chemotherapy-induced unscheduled hospitalizations in pa-tientswhowere treated inAugust 2008. Patientswere contactedby telephone 1 day before chemotherapy and on the second and eighth days after undergoing chemotherapy. Costs associated with TIUHs were calculated and {{compared with those of}} a cohort con-comitantly treated using the standard <b>follow-up</b> <b>procedure.</b> Results: A total of 259 patients entered the hospital-home monitoring program. They were compared with 86 patients who had similar characteristics but underwent the standard treatment and <b>follow-up</b> <b>procedure.</b> Inclusion in the hospital-home moni-toring program resulted in patients experiencing TIUHs approx-imately half as frequently as patients in the other group (2. 4 % v 4. 9 %; P. 01). Patients in the program experienced TIUHs for a median length of stay of 4 days, representing a nonsignificant reduction in duration of hospitalization (P not significant). Conse-quently, through a two-fold reduction in TIUH annual incidence, this program represents a reduction in unscheduled hospitaliza-tions per year of 383 days, decreasing hospital costs by € 201. 468 ($ 292, 468) per year. Conclusion: The hospital-home monitoring program is a cost-effective strategy for offering ambulatory chemotherapy treatment to patients with cancer.

40|$|PURPOSES: The {{development}} of a national protocol to formalize the screening of Dutch cancer survivors on potential late cancer treatment effects and the medical terminology used in describing the patient follow up procedures. METHODS: A combined evidence-based and qualitative approach, the Glaser's State of the Art Strategy, was used to reach consensus on how to screen Dutch cancer survivors on late cancer treatment effects. A core working group set up a first proposal of a screening protocol and a handbook of medical term definitions by incorporating available research evidence (1980 - 2003), clinical expertise and definitions from Dutch medical dictionaries and textbooks. External experts reviewed this proposal in a cycle of two postal and two discussion rounds. The <b>follow-up</b> <b>procedures</b> and medical term definitions described in the draft screening protocol were to be accepted if consensus among external experts was > or = 50 %. RESULTS: A protocol for screening cancer survivors on late cancer treatment effects was developed describing the <b>follow-up</b> <b>procedures</b> for cancer survivors according to previous therapeutic exposures. Four hundred and twenty one medical terms were used in describing these <b>follow-up</b> <b>procedures.</b> One hundred and fifteen of these terms were classified as multi-interpretable and 101 of these terms were defined. No definitions could be found for the remaining 14 medical terms. CONCLUSIONS: We succeeded in reaching consensus throughout The Netherlands on a protocol to screen cancer survivors on late cancer treatment effects. This protocol is now in use by all Dutch outpatient clinics and warrants that the screening of cancer survivors is consistent across The Netherlands. The screening protocol specifies in detail how screening of cancer survivors should take place and can therefore be used by clinicians who {{were not involved in}} the consensus stud...|$|R

40|$|With the {{evolution}} of cancer care and chemotherapy agents over the last 15 {{years there has been}} an evident shift in care from the inpatient to the ambulatory setting. There is a growing need for cancer care, particularly in the ambulatory (outpatient) setting. Patients receiving chemotherapy in the outpatient setting return home immediately after completing treatment and do not have direct medical and nursing supervision to monitor for and address side effects or adverse reactions of treatment in a hospital inpatient setting. Nurse telephone follow-up post initial chemotherapy allows for assessment and timely management of potential side effects experienced after the administration of chemotherapy in the outpatient setting. The purpose of this quality improvement project was to develop a standardized nurse telephone <b>follow-up</b> <b>procedure</b> post initial chemotherapy. The author developed an electronic script guideline and documentation tool along with a process for conducting the nurse-initiated calls. The project design included an educational activity and a post evaluation of the telephone <b>follow-up</b> <b>procedure.</b> Fifteen biotherapy/chemotherapy nurses participated in a four week pilot. During the four week pilot period 14 out of 34 first time chemotherapy patients received telephone follow-up utilizing the script guidelines. Ten nurses (N= 10, 67 %) completed the post evaluation survey. Results indicated that overall the script guidelines for telephone follow-up post initial chemotherapy was well received by staff and utilized appropriately. Replication of this project should include examining the impact of telephone follow-up on patient satisfaction and outcomes.

40|$|Purpose: To provide {{guidance}} regarding <b>follow-up</b> <b>procedures</b> after initial treatment of early stage testicular seminoma (clinical stages (CS) I–II A/B) {{based on current}} published evidence complemented by expert opinion. Methods and Material: An interdisciplinary, multinational working group consisting of urologists, medical oncologists, and radiation oncologists analyzed the published evidence regarding <b>follow-up</b> <b>procedures</b> {{in various stages of}} seminomatous and nonseminomatous testicular cancers. Focusing on radiooncological aspects, the recommendations contained herein are restricted to early stage seminoma (with radiotherapy being a standard treatment option). In particular, extent, frequency, and duration of imaging at follow-up were analyzed concerning relapse patterns, risk factors, and mode of relapse detection. Results: Active surveillance, adjuvant carboplatin or radiotherapy are equally accepted options for CS I seminoma but they result in different relapse rates and patterns. Usually relapses occur within the first 2 (– 6) years. Routinely performed follow-up using computerized tomography (CT) after adjuvant treatment yield only low detection rates of recurrences. Therefore, {{there is no evidence to}} maintain routine examinations every 3 – 4 months.
