5000|$|Ronne Entrance {{is a broad}} {{southwest}} {{entrance of}} the George VI Sound where it opens from the southeast portion of the Bellingshausen Sea at the southwest side of Alexander Island, Antarctica. The {{south side of the}} Monteverdi Peninsula occupies the north portion of the Ronne Entrance while Ellsworth Land occupies the southern portion of the entrance. The entrance receives much ice throughout the whole year mainly because the entrance protrudes eastward into the adjacent George VI Sound and the George VI Ice Shelf from the southwest section, the Ronne Entrance is also prone to ice flow from the Bach Ice Shelf (which separates {{the south side of the}} Beethoven Peninsula from the north side of the Monteverdi Peninsula) as well as receiving ice from the Wilkins Ice Shelf (mainly from the southernmost end of the ice shelf). There are a few islands situated within the Ronne Entrance, mainly in the southwest area. Some of these islands include the Eklund Islands, DeAtley Island, Spaatz <b>Island,</b> <b>Case</b> Island and Smyley Island. It was discovered on a sledge journey through the sound in December 1940 by U.S. Polar explorer Finn Ronne and Carl Eklund of the US Antarctic Service (USAS), 1939-41, and named [...] "Ronne Bay".

40|$|This article {{considers}} whether state constitutionalism provides greater {{possibilities for}} workplace religious accommodation than is currently available to religious minorities within federal law under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. We approach this question via {{a case study}} of the controversy over religious accommodation for practicing Muslims employed by the JBS Swift and Company meatpacking plant in Grand Island, N E. The case study consists of analyses of the requirements for religious accommodation under federal law, examination of the reasons why religious accommodation under federal law was not achieved in the Grand <b>Island</b> <b>case,</b> and analysis of Nebraska constitutional law on the subject of religious free exercise. We find that the language in the Nebraska Constitution regarding protection of religious practice provides grounds for Muslims and other religious minorities in Nebraska to seek religious accommodations in the workplace through state government venues that they have been unable to achieve under federal law...|$|E
40|$|This Joan Stevens {{memorial}} lecture {{challenges the}} traditional {{account of the}} relationship between the Channel Islands and the Westminster courts, established by John Le Patourel, that after extensive activity there in the 1320 s and 1330 s, in 1368 a further attempt to take an <b>island</b> <b>case</b> to King’s Bench was made – only to be rebuffed. Thenceforth, even if King’s Bench did not see island litigation, other English courts attempted to exercise influence in the islands, in the form of Chancery, Star Chamber and Requests, and especially the privy council, as an expression of the ultimate judicial power of the king. Instead, it concludes that there was in Westminster no obvious source of threat to the local resolution of legal issues after 1341, and that the royal charter of liberties granted in that year governed the relationship between the crown and the islands in this regard as in others over succeeding centuries...|$|E
30|$|The {{synergic}} use of TLS and IRT {{has been}} applied at Elba <b>island</b> <b>case</b> study (section 3.2. 1). The TLS survey yielded a detailed 3 -D remote structural, geometrical, and geomechanical characterization of the investigated rock masses. In particular, a semiautomatic geomechanical survey made possible the automatic calculation of six of the ten parameters suggested by ISRM (1985) for the quantitative description of discontinuities (orientation, spacing, persistence, roughness, number of sets, and block size). A total of 1359 planes were recognized and clustered according to seven different discontinuity sets, adding two more discontinuity sets to the five detected {{by means of the}} traditional field survey, therefore improving the rock mass structural-geomechanical characterization (Fig.  7). The obtained TLS 3 -D products also provided reference morphological maps useful for both further detailed field inspections and the design of possible future restoration works. The proposed approach proved to be an effective tool in the field of emergency management, when it is often urgently necessary and gather all the required information (characterization and mapping) as fast as possible in dangerous environments.|$|E
40|$|In this paper, a new algebraic-graph {{method for}} {{identification}} of islanding in power system grids is proposed. The proposed method identifies {{all the possible}} <b>cases</b> of <b>islanding,</b> due {{to the loss of}} a equipment, by means of a factorization of the bus-branch incidence matrix. The main features of this new method include: (i) simple implementation, (ii) high speed, (iii) real-time adaptability, (iv) identification of all <b>islanding</b> <b>cases</b> and (v) identification of the buses that compose each <b>island</b> in <b>case</b> of <b>island</b> formation.

40|$|This thesis {{seeks to}} {{discover}} the nature of risks in adventure tourism and how these risks can be managed effectively. There are three major sources of risk i. e. the natural environment, people and equipment. Risk results in consequences. These are usually undesirable events such as drownings. Several incidents {{have occurred in the}} recent past prompting negative publicity. To keep incidents at a minimum, several regulatory measures exist for example codes of practice, insurance, risk management plans, legislation, certification and safety standards. These methods can be administered by government, the industry or by businesses themselves. Currently, a combination of the latter two modes of implementation (i. e. industry driven self-regulation) is preferred. A Lower North <b>Island</b> <b>case</b> study using three actives (i. e. whitewater rafting, bungy jumping and jetboating) is used to examine the topic. Operator perceptions of risk are examined, management practices identified and a package for risk management developed. An estimation of the riskiness of the three case study activities is also possible. All businesses interviewed have some form of risk management in place. Operators desire a three tier division of responsibility for risk management including themselves, the government and an industry body...|$|E

40|$|Scientific {{interest}} in “local ” or “traditional ” marine knowledge and its applications in fishery and resource management have fostered linkages between {{the fields of}} marine biology and cultural anthro-pology. Ethnographic techniques are useful for investigating local knowledge structures, but these methods are time-consuming.

This Solomon <b>Island</b> <b>case</b> study focuses on ecological knowledge regarding the Arnavon Marine Conservation Area (AMCA) and marine areas that are not officially regulated (gazetted). Study respondents reside in the Isabel Island communities of Poro, Guguha, Kia and Allardyce.

40|$|This {{book is a}} {{pioneering}} investigation of the tourism practices in the world's other, cold water, islands. Located in extreme latitudes and subject to extreme weather conditions, these islands have been developing their tourism appeal in manners that appear sustainable. They present themselves in images that speak to the pristine, unique and superlative aspects of their natural environment, history and culture. Limited seasonality, difficulty of access, restricted infrastructure, harsh climates and water too cold to swim in, are integral features of the tourism industry, often welcomed as appropriate filters to the slide to the mass market. The collection contains 13 <b>island</b> <b>case</b> studies. A set of seven hail from Northern latitudes: Baffin (Nunavut, Canada), Banks (Northwest Territories, Canada), Greenland/ Kaalaalit Nunaat, Iceland, Lule (Sweden), Nunivak (Alaska), Solovetsky (Russia) and Svalbard (Norway). A second set of four cover the Southerly islands of Chatham (New Zealand), Falklands, Macquarie (Australia) and Stewart (New Zealand). Two other chapters discuss islands from the particular vantage points of cruise ship tourism, one for the Arctic region {{and one for the}} Antarctic. Additionally, five conceptual chapters provide insights into key tourism management issues, as they apply to cold water island experiences:(a) human resources; (b) environment; (c) promotion; (d) seasonality; and (e) access. peer-reviewe...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a state-of-the-art of the geochemical monitoring of volcanoes in the Azores archipelago, developed from 1987 to the present. Also, older data from mineral and thermal water springs and gas compositions on fumarolic discharges {{is presented in}} order to establish larger observations windows that allow to establish base lines that represent the background activity of the studied volcano. Due to organizational constraints the geochemical observations made in the past were on a time-discrete and erratic approach, and in a few cases the data collection only began after the crisis started, which limited the value of the conclusions. In recent years the geochemical surveillance of volcanic activity in the Azores increased, with a broad spectra of observations, and special attention is devoted to the chemical composition of mineral and thermal waters and gaseous phase on fumaroles, as well as to diffusive soil gas emanations. Due to the sparse distribution and to the great difficulties encountered in reaching certain sampling points, this effort is preliminary focused in a few active volcanoes. As a result, the Fogo and Furnas volcanoes in São Miguel, and the Graciosa <b>island</b> <b>case</b> studies will be illustrated, and this task will be complemented with unpublished data from other volcanoes.
