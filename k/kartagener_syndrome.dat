25|$|About 25% of {{individuals}} with situs inversus have an underlying condition known as primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD). PCD is a dysfunction of the cilia that manifests itself during the embryologic phase of development.

If they do, they are said to have <b>Kartagener</b> <b>syndrome,</b> characterized by the triad of situs inversus, chronic sinusitis, and bronchiectasis. Cilia are also responsible for clearing mucus from the lung, and the dysfunction causes increased susceptibility to lung infections. <b>Kartagener</b> <b>syndrome</b> can also manifest with male infertility as functional cilia are required for proper sperm flagella function.|$|E

40|$|A fertile {{woman with}} <b>Kartagener's</b> <b>syndrome</b> and three {{consecutive}} pregnancies Dear Sir, The classic triad of symptoms of <b>Kartagener's</b> <b>syndrome</b> is recurrent rhinosinusitis, bronchiectasis and situs inversus, {{caused by a}} generalized disorder of ciliary motility (Afzelius, 1976). It appears that if <b>Kartagener's</b> <b>syndrome</b> exists, pregnancy is hard to achieve and if pregnancy exists then <b>Kartagener's</b> <b>syndrome</b> is unlikely.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Recurrent lower {{respiratory}} tract infection (LRTI) is a very common problem we encounter in our clinical practice. Failure to recognize the specific cause of this condition may subject the patients to unnecessary and inappropriate treatment. CASE DETAILS: among the various causes of recurrent LRTI, the most frequent causes are abnormalities of general or local impairment of immune mechanism and abnormalities of cilia or mucus of {{respiratory tract}}. We report an adult case of recurrent upper and {{lower respiratory tract}} infections since childhood along with situs inversus totalis which was diagnosed as <b>Kartagener’s</b> <b>syndrome.</b> He had all the classical clinical and radiological features of <b>Kartagener’s</b> <b>syndrome</b> which is a rare inherited disorder which is seen in {{nearly half of the}} cases of primary cilliary dyskinesia (PCD). CONCLUSION: One should always keep in mind the possibilities of <b>Kartagener’s</b> <b>syndrome</b> in patients presenting with recurrent upper and lower respiratory tract infections, sinusitis or bronchiectasis.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Long-term {{observations}} {{in patients with}} <b>Kartagener's</b> <b>syndrome</b> (situs inversus, bronchiectasis, and sinusitis) are rare. The role of additional cardiac malformations and their surgical repair is not well known. METHODS: Nine patients (5 female and 4 male) with <b>Kartagener's</b> <b>syndrome</b> were identified and followed. Four patients had associated cardiac anomalies; 4 underwent total surgical repair at the ages of 4 (2 patients), 7, and 34 years. RESULTS: The postoperative period was uneventful, and these 4 patients are doing well 7 months and 2, 9, and 19 years after repair. The other patients are being treated with conservative therapy and are in relatively good condition. CONCLUSIONS: This disease can be temporarily benign when treated with antibiotics and physiotherapy. Associated cardiac anomalies seem to be quite common, and such patients need careful cardiologic follow-up. Surgical intervention can be safely performed in patients suffering from <b>Kartagener's</b> <b>syndrome</b> associated with a congenital cardiac malformation and produces good long-term results.

40|$|<b>Kartagener's</b> <b>syndrome</b> is a {{clinical}} triad consisting of bron-chiectasis, sinusitis, and situs inversus. Its association with ciliary abnormalities was first described in 19761 {{and since then}} {{there have been many}} reports confirming this associ-ation. It is believed that an inherited defect, usually ofdynein formation, causes impaired ciliary beating, resulting in poor mucociliary clearance and consequent recurrent or chronic infection in upper and lower respiratory tracts. Because the sperm tail has an identical ultrastructure to the ciliary axo-neme, immotile spermatozoa and male infertility are an inte-gral part of this condition. 12 We report a male patient with <b>Kartagener's</b> <b>syndrome</b> who was fertile and had normal respiratory tract cilia.

5000|$|Primary ciliary {{dyskinesia}} (PCD), {{also called}} immotile ciliary syndrome or <b>Kartagener</b> <b>syndrome,</b> is a rare, ciliopathic, autosomal recessive genetic disorder that causes defects {{in the action}} of cilia lining the respiratory tract (lower and upper, sinuses, Eustachian tube, middle ear), fallopian tube, and flagella of sperm cells. The phrase [...] "immotile ciliary syndrome" [...] is no longer favored as the cilia do have movement, but are merely inefficient or unsynchronized.|$|E
50|$|Bronchiectasis {{may result}} from {{congenital}} disorders that affect cilia motility or ion transport. <b>Kartagener</b> <b>syndrome</b> is one such disorder of cilia motility linked {{to the development of}} bronchiectasis. A common cause is cystic fibrosis, which affects chloride ion transport, in which a small number of patients develop severe localized bronchiectasis. Young's syndrome, which is clinically similar to cystic fibrosis, is thought to significantly {{contribute to the development of}} bronchiectasis. This is due to the occurrence of chronic infections of the sinuses and bronchiole tree.|$|E
50|$|This gene encodes {{a member}} of the dynein heavy chain family. It is a microtubule-dependent motor ATPase and has been {{reported}} {{to be involved in the}} movement of respiratory cilia. Mutations in this gene have been implicated in causing primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD, formerly called 'immotile cilia syndrome') and <b>Kartagener</b> <b>syndrome</b> (PCD with situs inversus totalis). Males with PCD are not sterile, but are infertile due to lack of sperm motility. There are reports of subfertility and increased risk of ectopic pregnancy in women with PCD.|$|E
40|$|The nasal {{polyposis}} is a chronic inflammatory {{process of the}} nasal mucosa. Although it is rare in children, there may be also association with cystic fibrosis and primary ciliary dyskinesia. About 50 % of primary ciliary dyskinesia patients develop situs inversus and it is known as <b>Kartagener's</b> <b>syndrome.</b> The <b>Kartagener's</b> sydrome is a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by sinusitis, bronchiectasis, situs inversus.

50|$|However, in some {{individuals}} with PCD, mutations {{thought to be}} in the gene coding for the key structural protein left-right dynein (lrd) result in monocilia which do not rotate. There is therefore no flow generated in the node, Shh moves at random within it, and 50% of those affected develop situs inversus which can occur with or without dextrocardia, where the laterality of the internal organs is the mirror-image of normal. Affected individuals therefore have <b>Kartagener</b> <b>syndrome.</b> This is not the case with some PCD-related genetic mutations: at least 6% of the PCD population have a condition called situs ambiguus or heterotaxy where organ placement or development is neither typical (situs solitus) nor totally reversed (situs inversus totalis) but is a hybrid of the two. Splenic abnormalities such as polysplenia, asplenia and complex congenital heart defects are more common in individuals with situs ambiguus and PCD, as they are in all individuals with situs ambiguus.|$|E
