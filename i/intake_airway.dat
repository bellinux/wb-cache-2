Subsequently, smoke can penetrate into an <b>intake</b> <b>airway</b> and create a hazardous atmosphere in the <b>intake</b> <b>airway</b> upwind from the fire.

The last comprehensive survey of this type was performed in the 1920 s. The size of the coal dust is relevant {{to the amount of}} rock dust required to inert the coal dust, with more rock dust needed to inert finer sizes of coal dust. Dust samples were collected by MSHA inspectors from several mines in each of MSHA's 10 bituminous Coal Mine Safety and Health Districts. Samples were normally collected in several intakes at each mine. The laboratory analysis procedures included acid leaching of the sample to remove the limestone rock dust, sonic sieving to determine the dust size, and low-temperature ashing of the sieved fractions to correct for any remaining incombustible matter. The results indicate that particle sizes of mine coal dust in <b>intake</b> <b>airways</b> are finer than those measured in the 1920 s.

40|$|Thesis (M. Sc. (Occupational Hygiene)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2010. Silicosis {{and coal}} worker's {{pneumoconiosis}} are serious occupational respiratory diseases {{associated with the}} coal mining industry and the inhalation of respirable dusts that contain crystalline silica. Silica exposure is an occupational health priority even when exposure has ceased or is below the occupational exposure limit (0. 1 mg/m 3). The objective {{of this study was}} to determine the individual contributions of the underground coal mining tasks to the total amount of respirable dust and respirable silica dust concentrations found in this environment. The tasks that were identified were continuous miner (CM) cutting, construction, the transfer point, tipping and roof bolting. Respirable dust sampling was conducted at the intake and return of each task, as well as at the intake and return of the section and the <b>intake</b> <b>airway</b> to the section. The five occupations that perform these tasks were also sampled to determine the personal exposure levels. Respirable dust concentrations and small concentrations of respirable silica dust were found in the <b>intake</b> <b>airway</b> and intake of the section, indicating that the air that enters the section is already contaminated. The respirable dust-generating hierarchy of the individual tasks was: transfer point>CM right cutting> CM left cutting> CM face cutting> construction> roof bolting > tipping. For respirable silica dust the hierarchy was: CM left cutting> construction> transfer point> CM right cutting. CM face cutting, tipping and roof bolting generated concentrations of below quantifiable levels. The personal exposures also differed and the eM and stamler operators had the highest exposure to respirable dust (3. 417 ± 0. 862 mg/m 3) and respirable silica dust (0. 179 ± 0. 388 mg/m 3) concentrations, respectively.

40|$|Propagation {{characteristics}} of methane-air deflagrations through an end-to-end pipe were investigated using the AutoReaGas software. The {{results indicate that}} the maximum overpressure first decreases and then increases with increasing distance from ignition source, and the overpressure minimum occurs at approximately 3. 4 m. When shockwaves from the intake and return airways meet, a positive superposition effect forms, generating maximum overpressure, density, and combustion rate values that are larger than the same values at adjacent points. The explosion parameters along the <b>intake</b> <b>airway</b> are similar to the parameters along the return airway. A 50 % filling ratio causes nearly the same level of explosion violence as a 100 % filling ratio.

40|$|Although it is {{believed}} that exemption to the ruling has been common, coal underground beltways in mine areas developed since 1978 in Queensland are required to have belt heading air segregated from other intake headings to improve the likelihood of maintenance of an uncontaminated escape airway {{in the event of a}} mine fire. Furthermore, the 1996 Moura No 2 Warden’s Inquiry Recommendations set down that underground mines should have one <b>intake</b> <b>airway</b> that is completely segregated from other parallel intake airways so as to provide two separate intake airways means of egress from the mine. The results of a study to examine the implications and costs of these provisions are set down and discussed. A number of Queensland mines are facing conditions of having to mine through extensive seam pockets of high concentration unpleasant and toxic gases such as H 2 S. These gases are liberated both from the face and from coal travelling on and being tipped from belts. Panel mining necessitates routing face return air down belt headings homotropally and under these conditions Mains Headings belt air will be contaminated and cannot be reused within the mine.

40|$|Segregation of {{conveyor}} roadways is a ventilation {{practice that}} is being increasingly applied in Australia. It is largely driven by the legislated requirements in Queensland pertaining to separation of escape ways from the mine. This legal requirement {{was based on a}} recommendation from the Moura No. 2 Wardens Inquiry into the mine disaster that claimed 11 lives. The report recommended “the introduction of a requirement for all underground mines to have one <b>intake</b> <b>airway</b> that is completely segregated from other parallel intake airways so as to provide two separate means of egress from the mine via an intake airway”. This recommendation seeks to assist mineworkers to escape from a mine after a fire by providing them with an airway that is free from smoke or contaminants. The concept of an airway being “completely segregated” is an ideal that is challenging to implement in practice when considering the effect of leakage. The practice of belt segregation is concerned with the potential for fires in the belt roadway although there are numerous other potential fire sources in underground coal mines. A review of segregation practices has been conducted applying ventilation engineering principles. Four different scenarios have been analysed with regard to the effectiveness of the segregation stoppings in preventing potential fire contaminants migrating {{to other parts of the}} mine. The results show that in some cases the benefits of segregation to a person evacuating a mine in the event of a fire range from beneficial to detrimental. This is influenced by many factors including the location of that individual in that particular mine. There is room for improvement in the design and implementation of escape ways in underground coal mines. Escape ways need to be planned and designated with regard to the potential sources of fire, pressure differentials between escape ways and the operational practicalities of maintaining the pressure differential between them...|$|E

40|$|The {{workings}} of a bituminous coal mine produce explosive coal dust for which adding rock dust {{can reduce the}} potential for explosions. Accordingly, guidelines have been established by the Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA) about the relative proportion of rock dust that must be present in a mine's <b>intake</b> and return <b>airways.</b> Current MSHA regulations require that <b>intake</b> <b>airways</b> contain at least 65 % incombustible content and return airways contain at least 80 % incombustible content. The higher limit for return airways was set {{in large part because}} finer coal dust tends to collect in these airways. Based on extensive in-mine coal dust particle size surveys and large-scale explosion tests, the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) recommends a new standard of 80 % total incombustible content (TIC) be required in the <b>intake</b> <b>airways</b> of bituminous coal mines in the absence of methane. MSHA inspectors routinely monitor rock dust inerting efforts by collecting dust samples and measuring the percentage of TIC, which includes measurements of the moisture in the samples, the ash in the coal, and the rock dust. These regulations were based on two important findings: a survey of coal dust particle size that was performed in the 1920 s, and large-scale explosion tests conducted in the U. S. Bureau of Mines' Bruceton Experimental Mine (BEM) using dust particles of that survey's size range to determine the amount of inerting material required to prevent explosion propagation. Mining technology and practices have changed considerably since the 1920 s, when the original coal dust particle survey was performed. Also, it has been conclusively shown that as the size of coal dust particles decreases, the explosion hazard increases. Given these factors, NIOSH and MSHA conducted a joint survey to determine the range of coal particle sizes found in dust samples collected from <b>intake</b> and return <b>airways</b> of U. S. coal mines. Results from this survey show that the coal dust found in mines today is much finer than in mines of the 1920 s. This increase in fine dust is presumably due to the increase in mechanization. In light of this recent comprehensive dust survey, NIOSH conducted additional large-scale explosion tests at the Lake Lynn Experimental Mine (LLEM) to determine the degree of rock dusting necessary to abate explosions. The tests used Pittsburgh seam coal dust blended as 38 % minus 200 mesh and referred to as medium-sized dust. This medium-sized blend was used to represent the average of the finest coal particle size collected from the recent dust survey. Explosion tests indicate that medium-sized coal dust required 76. 4 % TIC to prevent explosion propagation. Even the coarse coal dust (20 % minus 200 mesh or 75 microm), representative of samples obtained from mines in the 1920 s, required approximately 70 % TIC to be rendered inert in the larger LLEM, a level higher than the current regulation of 65 % TIC. Given the results of the extensive in-mine coal dust particle size surveys and large-scale explosion tests, NIOSH recommends a new standard of 80 % TIC be required in the <b>intake</b> <b>airways</b> of bituminous coal mines in the absence of methane. The survey results indicate that in some cases there are no substantial differences between the coal dust particle size distributions in return and intake air courses in today's coal mines. The survey results indicate that the current requirement of 80 % TIC in return airways is still appropriate in the absence of background methane. " - NIOSHTIC- 2 Kenneth L. Cashdollar, Michael J.

40|$|In the USA, the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) {{does a lot}} of {{work and}} has {{provided}} news of interesting new developments. Marcia L. Harris describes an Explosibility Meter: In underground mines, coal dust explosions are prevented by the addition of rock dust sufficient to render the coal dust inert. Federal [US] regulations require 65 % and 80 % incombustible content in samples taken in <b>intake</b> <b>airways</b> and return airways, respectively, assuming a nominal coal dust size of 20 % minus 200 mesh. The Coal Dust Explosibility Meter (CDEM), a hand-held instrument developed by NIOSH uses optical reflectance to measure the explosibility of a rock dust and coal dust mixture. The CDEM is now commercially available. It provides real-time results during rock dust surveys instead of waiting weeks for laboratory results 1. With real-time results, the potential for a disaster can be mitigated immediately. The CDEM displays the percent incombustible content as well as a colour indicating the relative explosibility of the coal and rock dust mixture. A red read-out indicates that more incombustible material is required to inert the coal and rock dust sample, while a green read-out indicates that the dust sample is sufficiently inert. When the mixture is marginally explosible, a yellow read-out is indicated. The red-yellow-green output depends upon the particle size distribution of the rock and coal dust mixture with the finer size fraction being more explosible...|$|R

Muck from the excavated face, which is usually fairly wet when placed on the conveyor, dries out as it travels on the conveyor through the airstream. Water sprays placed at intervals along the conveyor will minimize dust from the conveyor contaminating the airstream. Conveyor transfer and drop points should be enclosed and provided with water sprays. Scraper and spray wash will wash return belts and idlers. 7. 5. 11 Airways, Haulage Ways, Mine Cars and Dumping Stations a) Airways and rail haulage ways Cleaning the walls and floors of airways and rail haulage ways, by periodically washing down or vacuuming, will remove many potential dust sources. Concrete lined openings facilitate cleaning. Residual dust and dirt {{should not be allowed}} to accumulate in the airways and haulage ways as these represent potential dust sources. b) Mine cars Keeping the muck in the mine cars wet reduces the potential for creating dust. Overloading cars must be avoided as it can lead to spillage which then becomes another potential dust source. Washing mine cars regularly will keep them free of dirt and dust, and parking a loaded mine car for a long periods should be avoided as this allows the muck to dry out. If feasible, major route of mine cars should not be along primary <b>intake</b> <b>airways.</b> c) Dumping Stations Subsurface muck car dumping stations represent major potential dust sources. Enclosure and bypass airways can be installed to avoid high velocity air/dust contact. Water spray at dump activated during dumping will wet the muck and suppress dust.

Each drill hole is also set as a pressure outlet at about 20  kPa, {{and the rest}} of the boundary is set as a wall. The methane emission intensity is adopted at 0.05  m 3 /s. Because the protected coal seam exists in the caving zone, the release of methane pressure is lower than the original pressure. It is difficult to detect the dynamic decay process of the methane pressure in this sector, and hence this study only sets the situation that the protected layer is full at 100  % volume fraction methane in the initial conditions. Thus, a finite amount of methane in this region can seep towards the surrounding area and decay for the setting of permeability. Therefore, an unsteady calculation in the short term can also obtain a similar situation regarding the methane complementary source from the protected layer. This assumption does not reflect the methane emission intensity of the protected layer precisely, but the main aim is not to accurately describe the methane migration law, but to compare the drainage effect of different drill holes. Hence, the research aim is met under this configuration.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{conditions}} {{leading to the}} indefinite termination of production in four critical primary panels at an underground coal mining operation, the observed shortcomings in the mining approach, and the proposed strategy to mine through the affected panels. Initial assessment of the abandoned panel conditions indicated time-dependent strata failure, (i. e. bolted roof failure overrunning intersections), which occurred from mere minutes to up to four weeks post-production, with and without prior warning of failure. This prompted the constant re-supporting of back areas, which raised safety and productivity concerns. Investigation of the initial mining conditions revealed that the failures were due to a critical combination of factors, the chief of which was isolated horizontal stress. Other factors that were initially overlooked by the mine (i. e. influence of hydraulic stress, misinterpretation of borehole data), resulted in the conditions being described as abnormal. Remedial actions were determined, and in so doing, a new strategic approach was formulated to thoroughly address all failure concerns. The four panels were explicitly planned {{to serve as the}} main <b>intake</b> and return <b>airways</b> for the recently commissioned secondary ventilation shaft, as well as providing access to millions of tons in proven coal reserves.

40|$|To {{improve the}} {{ventilation}} of large-opening under-ground stone mines by using stoppings made from stone left in place. Background Underground stone mines typically use large room-and-pillar openings with little ventilation control. Stone miners may {{be exposed to}} contaminants that include silica dust, diesel particulate matter (DPM), exhaust gases, nuisance dust, and face shot (blasting) fume gases. The health risks from breathing these fine particles and toxic organic materials are well documented. Although contaminants such as dust or diesel exhaust can be some-what controlled at the source, the escaping contaminants are often diluted and removed from work areas using ventilation with minimal controls. In many cases, current mine ventilation practices use trial-and-error techniques to improve ventilation. The growing realization {{of the importance of}} a healthy work environment along with increased regulations will require many stone mines to implement new ways to improve ventilation. In-place stone stoppings are one option. Mine air flows from one point to another because of a pressure differential between those points. This pressure differential is established using a mechanical fan in conjunction with separations (stoppings) between high-pressure (intake) and low-pressure (return) airways. The separation of intakes and returns is an important concept that is used in most other types of mines. Normally, air moves through underground stone mines with minimal control technology. Fans are placed in locations where they are thought to be most beneficial, and intakes are not separated from returns. In a few smaller underground stone mines, proper ventilation can be achieved with a few strategically placed fans. However, as these mines increase in size, moving adequate quantities of air through-out the mine becomes harder, and separation of intakes and returns becomes a problem. Building traditional mine stoppings to separate the <b>intake</b> and return <b>airways</b> in entries with a cross-section area often exceeding 800 ft 2 is difficult. The stoppings must be able to withstand both the dynamic pressure from face shots and the static pressures created by the fans. Construction and maintenance difficulties, as well as high costs, are the main factors preventing these traditional mine stoppings from gaining wide acceptance by the stone mining industry...|$|R
