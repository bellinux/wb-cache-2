50|$|Enprostil is a {{synthetic}} prostaglandin designed to resemble <b>dinoprostone.</b> Enprostil {{was found to}} be a highly potent inhibitor of gastric HCl secretion. It is an analog of prostaglandin E2 but unlike this prostaglandin, which binds to and activates all four cellular receptors viz., EP1, EP2, EP3, and EP4 receptors, enprostil is a more selective receptor agonist in that it binds to and activates primarily the EP3 receptor. Consequently, enprostil is expected to have a narrower range of actions that may avoid some of the unwanted side-effects and toxicities of prostaglandin E2. A prospective multicenter randomized controlled trial conducted in Japan found combining enprostil with cimetidine was more effective than cimetidine alone in treating gastric ulcer.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background The {{objective}} of this randomized prospective study was to compare the efficacy of 50 mcg vaginal misoprostol and 3 mg <b>dinoprostone,</b> administered every nine hours for a maximum of three doses, for elective induction of labor in a specific cohort of nulliparous women with an unfavorable cervix and more than 40 weeks of gestation. Material and Methods One hundred and sixty-three pregnant women with more than 285 days of gestation were recruited and analyzed. The main outcome measures were time from induction to delivery and incidence of vaginal delivery within 12 and 24 hours. Admission rate to the neonatal intensive care unit within 24 hours post delivery was a secondary outcome. Results The induction-delivery interval was significantly lower in the misoprostol group than in the <b>dinoprostone</b> group (11. 9 h vs. 15. 5 h, p 0. 05) but with the disadvantage of higher abnormal fetal heart rate (FHR) tracings (22. 5 % vs. 12 %, p > 0. 05). From the misoprostol group more neonates were admitted to the intensive neonatal unit, than from the <b>dinoprostone</b> group (13. 5 % vs. 4. 8 %, p > 0. 05).

Although very useful, oxytocin alone is not always successful for induction of labor. In a randomized clinical trial we compared vaginal <b>dinoprostone</b> plus oxytocin with oxytocin alone for induction of labor in 91 pregnant women at 40 weeks or greater gestation with Bishop scores ≤ 4. Forty six patients assigned to the <b>dinoprostone</b> group received 3 mg intravaginal <b>dinoprostone.</b> Six hours later the Bishop score was evaluated and if the patient had not at least 3 contractions in 10 minutes lasting for more than 40 seconds, intravenous oxytocin was started at a dose of 6 mu/min and increased by 6 mu/min at 40 minute intervals until adequate uterine activity. Forty five patients assigned to the oxytocin group underwent oxytocin induction from the start of labor induction.

40|$|Background: We {{aimed to}} {{evaluate}} the efficacy and safety of <b>dinoprostone</b> for cervical ripening and labor induction in patients with term oligohydramnios and Bishop score ≤  5. Methods: This was a prospective case–control study, which included 104 consecutive women with a Bishop score≤ 5. Participants {{were divided into two}} groups. Women with term isolated oligohydramnios and Bishop score≤ 5 underwent induction of labor with a vaginal insert containing 10 -mg timed-release <b>dinoprostone</b> (prostaglandin E 2; Group A, n= 40). The control group, Group B, consisted of 64 cases of pregnancy with normal amniotic fluid volume (amniotic fluid index≥ 5  cm) and Bishop score≤ 5, and was matched for patient's age and parity.

In a randomized clinical ‎trial we compared vaginal <b>dinoprostone</b> plus oxytocin with oxytocin alone for ‎induction of labor in 91 ‎pregnant women at 40 weeks or greater gestation with Bishop scores &# 8804; 4. Forty six patients ‎assigned to the <b>dinoprostone</b> group received 3 mg intravaginal <b>dinoprostone.</b> Six ‎hours later the Bishop score was evaluated and if the patient had not at least 3 contractions in ‎ 10 minutes lasting for more than 40 seconds, intravenous oxytocin was started at a dose of 6 mu/min and ‎increased by 6 mu/min at 40 minute intervals until adequate uterine activity. Forty five patients ‎assigned to the oxytocin group underwent oxytocin induction from the start of labor induction. ‎Although the Bishop score change after 6 hours of receiving vaginal <b>dinoprostone</b> from 2. 54 ‎to 4. 97 was statistically significant, the oxytocin only group had a much better response with a change from ‎ 2. 60 to 6. 28. Median time between induction to the start of active labor was significantly ‎shorter in the oxytocin alone group (P = 0. 04). Median time between ‎induction to delivery and the rate of cesarean did not differ significantly in two groups (P > ‎ 0. 05). It was concluded that single dose of ‎dinoprostone is effective for initiating labor in patients with an unfavorable cervix and ‎appears safe but it is not as effective as oxytocin...|$|E
40|$|INTRODUCTION: The study compares {{safety and}} {{efficacy}} of misoprostol and <b>dinoprostone</b> as cervical ripening agents. METHODS: Patients with term, vertex, singleton pregnancy and Bishop score of 4 or less {{were randomly assigned to}} receive misoprostol pessary (n= 35, 50 microg intravaginally) or <b>dinoprostone</b> gel (n= 31, 0. 5 mg intracervically) at 6 hourly intervals. If there were no progress in cervical dilatation or effective uterine contraction even after maximum dose, patients were taken for cesarean section. Patients who achieved Bishop's score more than 7 but the delivery was not progressing, were augmented with oxytocin drip. RESULTS: No uterine hyperstimulation was observed in both groups. However, abnormal fetal heart rate was observed in 3 (8. 6...|$|E
40|$|Background: Induction of labour {{is common}} in obstetric practice. We {{conducted}} this study to find the appropriate and safe drug for labour induction and to compare the safety and efficacy of oral misoprostol and vaginal <b>dinoprostone</b> for labour induction. Methods: In a provisional, prospective and cross-sectional study, {{one hundred and fifty}} five singleton cephalic presentation full term pregnancies with medical or obstetric indication for labour induction were allocated in two groups. First group received oral 50 micrograms for nulliparas and low parity group (1 - 4), and 25 micrograms for grand multiparas (&# 8805; 5) misoprostol orally every 6 hours to a maximum of four doses daily. In the second group vaginal tablets of <b>dinoprostone</b> 3 mg then 1. 5 mg for nulliparas and 1. 5 mg for low parity and grand multiparas groups were inserted in the posterior fornix, every 8 hours. Primary outcome measures were: induction success, induction-delivery interval and number of used doses. Secondary outcome measures included: maternal side effects, caesarean section rate, mode of delivery and neonatal outcome. Data was collected from patient case notes and analyzed using software SPSS (version 13. 0) and p-value < 0. 05 was used as statistical significance of differences. Results: In our study {{there were no significant differences}} in baseline parameters in the two groups nor in the indications for labor induction except misoprostol was used in premature rupture of membrane. Induction of labor succeeded in 123 (79. 35 %) women without other interventions from other methods (80. 26 %misoprostol group versus 78. 5 % <b>dinoprostone</b> p= 0. 492). It was observed that there were no significant differences between the two groups in final outcomes nor in obstetrical complications. There was no significance in differences between misoprostol and <b>dinoprostone</b> groups in induction-delivery interval (15. 2 &# 177; 14. 5 hours versus 16. 4 &# 177; 11. 3 hours p= 0. 6 resp.). Conclusions: This study demonstrated that oral misoprostol is as effective as vaginal <b>dinoprostone</b> tablets for induction of labor and can be a good alternative for this purpose.

DESIGN: Randomised double blind placebo controlled trial. SETTING: Maternity departments in three hospitals in Australia. Population Pregnant women with a singleton cephalic presentation at > or = 36 + 6 weeks' gestation, with an indication for prostaglandin induction of labour. INTERVENTIONS: 20 mug oral misoprostol solution at ourly intervals and placebo vaginal gel or vaginal <b>dinoprostone</b> gel at six hourly intervals and placebo oral solution. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Vaginal birth within 24 hours; uterine hyperstimulation with associated changes in fetal heart rate; caesarean section (all); and caesarean section for fetal distress. RESULTS: 741 women were randomised, 365 to the misoprostol group and 376 to the vaginal <b>dinoprostone</b> group. There {{were no significant differences}} between the two treatment groups in the primary outcomes: vaginal birth not achieved in 24 hours (misoprostol 168 / 365 (46. 0 %) v <b>dinoprostone</b> 155 / 376 (41. 2 %); relative risk 1. 12, 95 % confidence interval 0. 95 to 1. 32; P = 0. 134), caesarean section (83 / 365 (22. 7 %) v 100 / 376 (26. 6 %); 0. 82, 0. 64 to 1. 06; P = 0. 127), caesarean section for fetal distress (32 / 365 (8. 8 %) v 35 / 376 (9. 3 %); 0. 91, 0. 57 to 1. 44; P = 0. 679), or uterine hyperstimulation with changes in fetal heart rate (3 / 365 (0. 8 %) v 6 / 376 (1. 6 %); 0. 55, 0. 14 to 2. 21; P = 0. 401). Although there were differences in the process of labour induction, there were no significant differences in adverse maternal or neonatal outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: This trial shows no evidence that oral misoprostol is superior to vaginal <b>dinoprostone</b> for induction of labour. However, it does not lead to poorer health outcomes for women or their infants, and oral treatment is preferred by women.

40|$|Objective: To {{determine}} whether outpatient use of timed-release <b>dinoprostone</b> vaginal inserts {{is a safe}} and effective option for induction of labour in appropriate low-risk populations. Methods: We performed a retrospective cohort study of inpatient and outpatient inductions of labour at a level II care hospital between 1998 and 2006. We included women undergoing induction of labour {{by the use of}} a <b>dinoprostone</b> vaginal insert, and excluded women with a gestational age of < 37 weeks, previous Caesarean section, multiple gestation, or preadmission intrauterine fetal demise. The outcomes examined were other methods of induction used, method and time of delivery, and fetal outcome defined by Apgar scores, and admissions to the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU).
