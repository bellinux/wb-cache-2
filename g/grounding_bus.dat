50|$|Like all {{industrial}} sites, the buildings, {{the antenna}} masts, the generators, and the transmitting equipment of the stations should be grounded for personal safety against electrical shocks. On the masts and roofs, lightning rods should be used. For transmitter stations working on frequencies below 30 MHz a good grounding {{is required for}} good function and sometimes excessive grounding systems are used. In most cases, it is desirable to connect the rods to each other to form a simple Faraday cage. But in high altitude stations, the ground is usually rocky and finding an appropriate point for the <b>grounding</b> <b>bus</b> may be impossible. In such cases, very long grounding connectors {{may be used to}} find a good ground at lower altitudes.|$|E
50|$|Ground loops - When {{grounding}} a circuit, it {{is important}} to avoid ground loops. Ground loops occur when there is a voltage drop between the two ground potentials. Since ground is thought of as 0 V, the presence of a voltage is undesirable at any point of a <b>ground</b> <b>bus.</b> If this is the case, {{it would not be a}} true ground. A good way to fix this is to bring all the ground wires to the same potential in a <b>ground</b> <b>bus.</b>|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} an event-driven algorithm and its symbolic implementation {{for the analysis}} of power and <b>ground</b> <b>bus</b> networks. The algorithm uses frequency domain techniques and moment matching approaches based on Pad#e approximants to estimate the transfer function at each node in the P#G network. Afterwards, the transientwaveforms are extracted for each node...|$|R

50|$|Note the {{connections}} to the common <b>ground</b> <b>bus</b> from sockets 2 (top left), 19 (center bottom row), 22, 24, 26, 30, and 40 on all connectors. Also note (enlarged detail, bottom, looking from {{the opposite side of}} the connector) that socket 34 of the blue connector does not contact any conductor but unlike socket 34 of the other two connectors, it does connect to the common <b>ground</b> <b>bus.</b> On the gray connector, note that socket 28 is completely missing, so that pin 28 of the drive attached to the gray connector will be open. On the black connector, sockets 28 and 34 are completely normal, so that pins 28 and 34 of the drive attached to the black connector will be connected to the cable. Pin 28 of the black drive reaches pin 28 of the host receptacle but not pin 28 of the gray drive, while pin 34 of the black drive reaches pin 34 of the gray drive but not pin 34 of the host. Instead, pin 34 of the host is grounded.|$|R

40|$|A novel current-estimation {{approach}} is developed to support the analysis of electromigration failures in power supply and <b>ground</b> <b>busses</b> of CMOS VLSI circuits. It uses the original concept of probabilistic simulation to e ciently generate accurate estimates of the expected current waveform required for electromigration analysis. As such, the {{approach is}} pattern-independent and relieves the designer of the tedious task of specifying logical input waveforms. This approach has been implemented in the program CREST which has shown excellent accuracy and dramatic speedups compared to traditional approaches. We describe the approach and its implementation, and present the results of numerous CREST runs on real circuits...|$|R

40|$|Neglecting {{the current}} due to voltage {{glitches}} in CMOS circuits {{can lead to}} large errors in the estimated power and <b>ground</b> <b>bus</b> currents. What little glitch-related research has been reported, has focused on glitch voltage analysis for power estimation. We present {{a model for the}} glitch current and time in a CMOS 2 -input NOR gate. It is an empirical model which exploits the linear dependence of both quantities on the input signal overlap time. The model is accurate to within 15 % of HSPICE with the level- 3 MOSFET model. When used with a previously reported model for the analysis of currents due to complete logical transitions, the speed is two to three orders faster than HSPICE...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} an event-driven algorithm for the symbolic analysis {{of power and}} <b>ground</b> <b>bus</b> networks using moment matching techniques to estimate the transfer function at each node in the P#G network. The P#G network is modeled by a hierarchical combination of mesh and tree structures that are composed {{of a collection of}} RC-# segments and pulldown #or pullup# switches. The switches are symbolically represented by Boolean variables and a compiled symbolic code is generated only once for each P#G network. The transientwaveforms are then produced by repetitiveevaluation of the symbolic output. The results show that the symbolic implementation is an order of magnitude faster, with reasonably good accuracy, than using a traditional analog circuit simulator like SPICE...|$|R

50|$|The {{connector}} is an insulation-displacement connector—in other words, each contact comprises a pair {{of points}} which together pierce the insulation of the ribbon cable with such precision that they make {{a connection to the}} desired conductor without harming the insulation on the neighboring wires. The center row of contacts are all connected to the common <b>ground</b> <b>bus</b> and attached to the odd numbered conductors of the cable. The top row of contacts are the even-numbered sockets of the connector (mating with the even-numbered pins of the receptacle) and attach to every other even-numbered conductor of the cable. The bottom row of contacts are the odd-numbered sockets of the connector (mating with the odd-numbered pins of the receptacle) and attach to the remaining even-numbered conductors of the cable.|$|R
5000|$|The hazard was {{eliminated}} from later sets {{by the use}} of an internal <b>ground</b> <b>bus</b> connected to the chassis by an isolation network. Underwriters Laboratories required the adoption of the floating chassis, as isolation from the mains (the exact circuit and component values were not specified although the leakage current allowed was specified) to limit the shock to a [...] "safe" [...] current level. The chassis was maintained at RF ground (for shielding) by a bypass capacitor (typically 0.05 µF to 0.2 µF) usually with a resistor connected across it (typically 220 kΩ to 470 kΩ, although values as small as 22 kΩ were sometimes used or the resistor was simply omitted). Over the years, these paper capacitors often become leaky, and could allow sufficient current flow to give the user a shock.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the {{estimation}} of the median time-to-failure (MTF) due to electromigration in the power and <b>ground</b> <b>busses</b> of CMOS VLSI circuits. In our previous work [3, 4], we presented a novel technique for MTF estimation based on a stochastic current waveform model. In [6], we argued that including the variance waveform of the current, {{in addition to its}} expected waveform derived in [3, 4], would further improve the accuracy of the MTF estimate. In this paper, we present a novel technique for deriving the variance waveform for CMOS circuits. Using this technique, we establish the importance of the variance waveform by showing that its contribution to the MTF estimate can be in the range of 100 % to 200 % relative to that of the expected waveform. The technique has been built into the probabilistic simulator CREST [3, 4], and has shown good agreement with SPICE, as well as excellent speedup...|$|R
40|$|The {{probabilistic}} simulation approach [1] {{is extended}} {{to include the}} computation of the variance waveform of the power/ground current, {{in addition to its}} expected waveform. To provide the motivation for doing this, we focus on the problem of estimating the median timeto-failure (MTF) due to electromigration in the power and <b>ground</b> <b>busses</b> of CMOS circuits. New theoretical results are presented that quantify the relationship between the MTF and the statistics of the stochastic current. This leads to a more accurate estimate of the MTF that requires both the expected and variance waveforms. A novel technique is then presented to compute the variance waveform for CMOS circuits, which has been incorporated into the probabilistic simulator CREST [1]. We show results of this implementation, demonstrating e ciency and accuracy on a number of circuits. We also use these results to study the importance of the variance waveform by estimating its contribution to the MTF relative to that of the expected waveform. Center...|$|R
