40|$|Background and Objectives: The {{presence}} of certain chemical compounds in dialysis water which enter patients’ bodies through haemodialysis can cause various {{problems such as}} acute poisoning, brain damage, osteoarthritis, Therefore, applying the standards for dialysis water is indispensible. This study was carried out to determine the chemical quality of water entrance to dialysis machines and its comparison with AAMI and EPH standards in the hospitals of Qom province. Methods: This is a descriptive-cross sectional study which was carried out on 45 samples of water entrance to dialysis machines in hospitals of Qom province. Since there were 3 hospitals in Qom having dialysis units, out of each one 15 samples were chosen as the samples of this study. The following machines were used for analysis of samples in the research: Atomic Absorption, DR 4000 and Flame photometer. The gathered data were then analyzed by independent t-test (p< 0. 5). Results: The means of all measured compounds were statistically lower than <b>standard</b> <b>levels</b> and had a significant difference with <b>standard</b> <b>levels.</b> The elements and compounds such as Lead, Zinc, Potassium, Sodium, Sulphate, Nitrate, and Chloride in all the measured samples were below the <b>standard</b> <b>levels,</b> but elements such as Aluminum, Cadmium, and Fluoride were above the <b>standard</b> <b>levels</b> in 13, 6 and 9 percent of samples, respectively. Conclusion: The {{results of the study}} showed that in all cases the means of all the studied compounds were below the <b>standard</b> <b>levels,</b> indicating high quality dialysis water in the hospitals. However, the {{presence of}} high level of elements such as Aluminum, Cadmium, and Fluoride compared with the <b>standard</b> <b>levels</b> signifies that much should be done in examining dialysis water...|$|R

40|$|The {{theory of}} fiscal {{federalism}} {{points out that}} decentralisation should be pursued in order to fit differences in individual preferences. However, the presence of externalities and the need of providing merit goods to citizens suggest that centralisation is likely to produce more efficient results. Moreover, in a political economy framework, each decision - including the possibility to fix a <b>standard</b> <b>level</b> of services - mainly depends on the objective function of the policymakers. Adopting this approach, {{the aim of this}} paper is to compare the individual convenience of a common <b>standard</b> <b>level</b> defined under a centralised system versus different provisions of public services when decisions are decentralised.
