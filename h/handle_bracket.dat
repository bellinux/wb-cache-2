Our approach is to handle compounding as an intermediate stage between morphological analysis and syntactic parsing. We discuss how the compounding machine <b>handles</b> <b>bracketing</b> paradoxes and adjectives in compounds and how the nondeterminism allows for ambiguity due to different bracketings and Turkish subject/object pro-drop...|$|R

40|$|Introduction: Earnings {{questions}} have been asked in South Africa’s national surveys annually since 1994. A key question for labour economists has been to track and explain the evolution of earnings over this post-apartheid period. Unfortunately, however, the measurement instrument has changed in ways that make it tricky to simply take the raw figures and compare them even if one restricts the attention to the October Household Surveys and the various Labour Force Surveys. In this paper we analyse {{some of the changes}} and indicate where corrections are needed. We implement many of these changes in the second release of PALMS, the Post-Apartheid Labour Market Series (Kerr, Lam and Wittenberg 2013). The structure of the paper is as follows. In section 2 we review studies done on the earnings variables in the national surveys from Statistics South Africa, particularly those that comment on the comparability of the variables over time. In Section 3 we pay attention in more detail to the evolution of the measurement instrument. We then turn to an analysis of the actual responses in section 4 with a view to pinpointing where the underlying measurements may have changed. The following sections deal with ways of <b>handling</b> <b>bracket</b> information and missing data respectively. In section 8 we look at the impact of these data quality adjustments on the estimation of average real earnings over time. We acknowledge the support of an infrastructure grant to DataFirst from the Redi 3 x 3 project on “Employment/Unemployment, Income Distribution and Inclusive Growth". The Vice-Chancellor’s Strategic Fund of the University of Cape Town paid for the initial construction of the PALMS dataset without which this research would not have been possible...|$|R
40|$|We have {{developed}} {{and provide an}} algorithm which allows to test the Jacobi identity for a given generalized ‘Poisson’ bracket. Novel frameworks for nonequilibrium thermodynamics have been established, which require that the reversible part of motion of thermodynamically admissible models is described by Poisson brackets satisfying the Jacobi identity {{in order to ensure}} the full time-structure invariance of equations of motion for arbitrary function(al) s on state space. For a nonassociative algebra obeyed by objects such as the Lie bracket, the elements of Lie groups fulfill this identity. But the manual evaluation of Jacobi identities relevant for applications and even for basic examples is often very time consuming. The efficient algorithm presented here can be obtained as a package to be used {{within the framework of the}} symbolic programming language MathematicaTM. The tool <b>handles</b> Poisson <b>brackets</b> acting either on functions or on functionals, depending on whether the system is described in terms of discrete or of continuous variables...|$|R
40|$|This {{document}} {{describes the}} syntactic bracketing {{guidelines for the}} Penn Korean Treebank, which is an online corpus of Korean texts annotated with morphological and syntactic information. The corpus consists of around 54, 000 words and 5, 000 sentences. The Treebank uses a phrase structure style of annotation, making head/phrasal node distinctions, argument/adjunct distinctions, and identifying empty arguments and traces for moved constituents. This document is organized as follows. In section 2, the basic syntactic ingredients of a clause structure are presented. Some notational conventions are introduced in section 3, including different types of syntactic tags, such as head level tags, phrase level tags and function tags used in the Treebank. In section 4, the bracketing guidelines for various types of clauses are discussed, including simple clauses, subordinate clauses, and clauses with coordination. Several types of subcategorizaion frames found in the Treebank are then presented in section 5, followed by bracketing guidelines for various linguistic phenomena in sections 6 to 21, including guidelines for annotating punctuation. The document ends with guidelines for <b>handling</b> some <b>bracketing</b> ambiguities and for handling some confusing examples...|$|R

The barrel is heavily reinforced at the muzzle {{and has two}} raised ribs midway of the barrel, between which the barrel clamping collar is held. The firing mechanism {{is similar to that}} used on the Type 99, 81 mm short mortar. After the weapon has been loaded, a plunger, which projects upward from the mortar breech, is struck with a mallet or similar instrument, thus camming out the firing pin and firing the mortar. A safety lock is fitted on this firing plunger.|$|R
5000|$|Cyclo-cross bike {{design and}} frame {{geometry}} {{has evolved over}} the years. The first cyclo-cross bikes were touring-type road bikes, used for their cantilever bosses, slacker angles and wider tire clearance. Over time as the sport became more formalized, frame angles changed for quicker <b>handling</b> and bottom <b>brackets</b> heights were raised to clear broken ground. Most cyclo-cross frames have a non-compact (flat or near-flat top tube) frame design for easier shouldering. Some design features have recently begun to change, for example, a heightened bottom bracket was typical 10+ years ago; now many cyclo-cross-specific frames do not have elevated bottom brackets, in fact many have a lower bottom bracket than road racing bicycles; this is favorable since the lower seat height makes for easier remounting, and a lower center of gravity increases stability. Many cyclo-cross bicycles are now set up with a single chainring and chain [...] "drop" [...] guards. A single chainring setup simplifies mechanics and reduces the chance of the chain derailing on a bumpy course. People who do run a double chain-ring set up on their bicycles generally use a 36-46 gearing. Many professional-level cyclo-cross bikes are set up with deep-section carbon tubular wheels, not {{for the purpose of}} aerodynamics, but to keep the wheel from being entrapped in deep sand or mud sections. Tubular tires are used to avoid pinch flats, decrease rolling resistance and increase grip with lower tire pressures. In addition, single speed cyclo-cross bikes are becoming increasingly popular for a variety of reasons, including lower initial cost of setup, ease of use and maintenance, and decreased likelihood of mechanical failure on the course.|$|R
40|$|The National Interagency Fire Center (NIFC) is {{the support}} center for wild land {{firefighting}} in the US located in Boise, ID. One {{of the many}} activities that the NIFC coordinates is prescribed burns. Prescribed burns are one of NIFC’smanagement tools to help prevent major forest fires by burning undergrowth and they also help with maintaining and improving habitat. Recently, NIFC has decommissioned their prescribed burn apparatus {{due to lack of}} safety specifications, the Terra-Torch, produced by Firecon, based out of Ontario, Oregon. Last year, Boise State University produced a burn apparatus prototype for NIFC to replace the Terra-Torch. Although last year’sprototype was better than the Terra-Torch, NIFC wants Boise State University to re-engineer the apparatus utilizing standard parts with certain safety ratings such as the Underwriters Laboratories (UL) rating. Our group has focused on re-engineering the ergonomics and robustness of last year’sapparatus using standardized parts. We have focused our attention to the apparatus’sfront <b>handle</b> and igniter <b>bracket.</b> So far, we have developed a front handle design that will include two switches: one that will control the igniter switch and the other will control both the pump’sclutch and mapp gas solenoid. With this design, we will have a fail-safe system that will protect the operator and others around. The failsafe system will shut down the apparatus in case the operator would happen to fall and or drop the apparatus. This would include extinguishing the flame and disengaging the clutch to the pump. Our design for the igniter bracket include: two hose clamps and a curved flame tip. The two hose clamps and curved flame tip will provide easy adjustability for any weather condition to ensure proper ignition of the gelled fuel. In near future, we plan on relocating the sparker ignition box, and mapp gas solenoid. Once these items are completed, we will have a working prototype. We will first test our prototype with water to ensure that our apparatus is sealed properly. If the water test is a success then by mid March, we plan on testing our prototype with NIFC using the actual gelled fuel. The exact date is unknown at this time due to weather conditions and NIFC’s schedule. Once we have the form of our apparatus finalized, we also plan on having the entire apparatus powder coated Boise State blue and orange...|$|R
