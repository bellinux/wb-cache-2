5|$|Another {{quantum effect}} that predicts the {{occurrence}} of faster-than-light speeds is called the Hartman effect; under certain conditions the time needed for a virtual particle to tunnel through a barrier is constant, regardless of {{the thickness of the}} barrier. This could result in a virtual particle crossing a large gap faster-than-light. However, no <b>information</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> sent using this effect.|$|E
5|$|Python {{does not}} support tail call {{optimization}} or first-class continuations, and, according to Guido van Rossum, it never will. However, better support for coroutine-like functionality is provided in 2.5, by extending Python's generators. Before 2.5, generators were lazy iterators; information was passed unidirectionally out of the generator. From Python 2.5, {{it is possible to}} pass information back into a generator function, and from Python 3.3, the <b>information</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> passed through multiple stack levels.|$|E

5|$|Trillium grandiflorum as well {{as other}} trilliums are a favored food of white-tailed deer. Indeed, if trilliums are {{available}} deer will seek these plants, with a preference for T. grandiflorum, to the exclusion of others. In the course of normal browsing, deer consume larger individuals, leaving shorter ones behind. This <b>information</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> used to assess deer density and its effect on understory growth in general.|$|E
5|$|In captivity, only Campbell's dwarf hamsters and Djungarian hamsters {{are able}} to interbreed and produce live {{offspring}} or hybrids. Although hybrids make suitable pets, the breeding of hybrids and cloning can cause health problems, due to inherited diseases. Because genetic <b>information</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> very similar, genetic health problems or vulnerabilities can easily be inherited by the offspring. The widespread breeding and distribution of hybrids could threaten the existence of both pure species and subspecies of the ecosystem. This could ultimately lead to the extinction of the subspecies. Each litter becomes smaller as more generations are produced and the young commonly begin to inherit many congenital problems.|$|E

Console operators perform surveillance, identification, weapons control, battle management and communications functions.

5|$|The {{ecological}} {{conservation of}} seamounts is {{hurt by the}} simple lack of information available. Seamounts are very poorly studied, with only 350 of the estimated 100,000 seamounts in the world having received sampling, and fewer than 100 in depth. Much of this lack of <b>information</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> attributed {{to a lack of}} technology, and to the daunting task of reaching these underwater structures; the technology to fully explore them has only been around the last few decades. Before consistent conservation efforts can begin, the seamounts of the world must first be mapped, a task that is still in progress.|$|E
5|$|Other new {{features}} include Internet Worm Protection to block worms, which scan IP addresses for open ports. It also blocks inbound ports based on known and suspected exploits using signatures and heuristics. The {{addition of the}} feature follows MSBlast in 2003 and Sasser in 2004, worms that exploited vulnerability in Microsoft Windows' operating systems. In response to emerging privacy threats — 75 percent of the threats in the last 12 months attempted to steal confidential information — this version adds phishing protection. Using the firewall component, users can create a whitelist of sites where confidential <b>information</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> transmitted. Users are alerted when information is transmitted to a site not on the list. The Outbreak Alert feature warns users of major threats as classified by Symantec, and users can press the Fix Now button to applies a set of changes to close vulnerabilities, such as blocking necessary ports used by a propagating worm. The Browser Privacy can suppress information website generally receive about its visitors, such as the browser and operating system used. The feature can also block advertisements.|$|E

5|$|The {{simplest}} {{way to gain}} information about brain anatomy is by visual inspection, but many more sophisticated techniques have been developed. Brain tissue in its natural state is too soft to work with, {{but it can be}} hardened by immersion in alcohol or other fixatives, and then sliced apart for examination of the interior. Visually, the interior of the brain consists of areas of so-called grey matter, with a dark color, separated by areas of white matter, with a lighter color. Further <b>information</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> gained by staining slices of brain tissue with a variety of chemicals that bring out areas where specific types of molecules are present in high concentrations. It is also possible to examine the microstructure of brain tissue using a microscope, and to trace the pattern of connections from one brain area to another.|$|E
