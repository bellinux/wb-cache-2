5|$|Before the 1922 season, Huggins {{acquired}} Johnny Mitchell {{from the}} Vernon Tigers of the Pacific Coast League and traded fan favorite Roger Peckinpaugh along with Rip Collins, Bill Piercy, and <b>Jack</b> <b>Quinn</b> to the Red Sox for Everett Scott, Bullet Joe Bush, and Sad Sam Jones. By this time, Ruppert hired Ed Barrow as the team's business manager, and he aided Huggins in player transactions. The Yankees repeated as AL champions that season, but lost the 1922 World Series, {{again to the}} Giants. With the newly gained confidence of his owners, Huggins was retained as manager.|$|E
5|$|Peckinpaugh {{was traded}} twice during the 1921–22 offseason.

On January 10, 1922, Pecknipaugh was {{involved}} in a three-team trade involving the Red Sox, Washington Senators and Philadelphia Athletics, where Peckinpaugh joined the Senators, Joe Dugan and Frank O'Rourke went to the Red Sox, and the Athletics acquired Bing Miller, José Acosta, and $50,000 ($ in current dollar terms). Though team owner Clark Griffith had indicated that Peckinpaugh would serve as his player-manager {{at the time of the}} trade, he named Clyde Milan player-manager for the 1922 season instead. This distracted Peckinpaugh, and along with injuries, limited his performance.|$|E

[...] A resident of Cheektowaga, New York, Gorski is a former County Executive of Erie County, New York, which includes Buffalo, New York {{and many of its}} suburbs.

500|$|During Gorski's second term, one of {{the more}} unusual crises was the arrest of 194 pro-life protesters who mostly {{declined}} to post bail, which meant they were left in jail where the county was obligated to assume the costs for overtime and expenses associated with the arrests. In 1992, he ran against Republican <b>Jack</b> <b>Quinn</b> and Mary Refermat for Henry Nowak's seat in the United States House of Representatives to serve in the 103rd United States Congress. He was expected to win election to succeed Nowak in the New York's 30th congressional district.

2500|$|Philadelphia {{opened the}} third {{month of the}} season by {{breaking}} a 68-inning streak in which no Phillie had hit a home run; Howard's two-run shot in the sixth inning was one of ten hits for the team, but the Braves defeated them, 7–3.

After a day off, the Phillies defeated the San Diego Padres in consecutive games in the Friars' only visit of the season to Philadelphia; Halladay won his eighth decision in a 3–2 victory on June 4, and Moyer followed by becoming the third pitcher to win 100 games after the age of 40 (<b>Jack</b> <b>Quinn,</b> Phil Niekro) in a complete-game win on June 5. After scoring five runs against Padres starter Kevin Correia in less than two innings in the third game, San Diego's bullpen pitched [...] scoreless frames as Philadelphia was defeated in extra innings, 6–5. After Hamels lost a potential no-hitter in the seventh inning on June 7, the Phillies settled for a split with the Padres as they lost, 3–1.

Ben Francisco made an error in the outfield and grounded into two double plays before batting in the winning run in the bottom of the eighth inning; the final score was 10–8. After the second scheduled game of the series was cancelled due to poor weather conditions, the Marlins won the final game, 2–0; Johnson and Halladay matched up for the first time since the latter's perfect game two weeks prior, and the former left as the victor after pitching eight scoreless innings.|$|E
