5|$|Bobby Clarke, {{who succeeded}} Farwell {{as the general}} manager of the <b>Flyers,</b> feuded with Lindros and his parents during his time with Philadelphia. Lindros sat out for the entire 2000–01 NHL season after rejecting a one-year, $8.5million offer as he demanded a trade from the <b>Flyers.</b> The <b>Flyers</b> traded him to the Rangers in 2001. After Lindros retired from the NHL, the <b>Flyers</b> {{inducted}} him into their team Hall of Fame, in 2014.|$|E

5|$|In 1990–91, Hextall {{appeared}} in 36NHL games, {{less than half}} of those played by the <b>Flyers</b> that season. He recorded 13wins, with a GAA of3.13. For the second successive year, the <b>Flyers</b> failed to qualify for the playoffs. Early the following season, Hextall received the third significant suspension of his career, missing six games for slashing Detroit forward Jim Cummins during a pre-season game. Suspension, further injuries, and a lack of form meant Hextall appeared 45times for the <b>Flyers.</b> He recorded 16wins during the season, resulting in his lowest win percentage in the NHL, 35.56%.|$|E
5|$|In Game 6, the <b>Flyers</b> lead 3–0 {{four minutes}} into the second period. Maxime Talbot fought Daniel Carcillo after the <b>Flyers</b> tallied their third goal and the Penguins, re-energized by Talbot's display, scored three goals in what {{remained}} of the second period to tie the game 3–3. Sergei Gonchar scored his first goal of the series, his first in 23playoff games dating back to game two of the Penguins' first-round series against Ottawa in 2008, to break the tie at 2:19 of the third period. Crosby added an empty-net goal and the Penguins eliminated the <b>Flyers</b> and advance to the Eastern Conference Semifinals. Three days after the Penguins series-clinching victory of the <b>Flyers,</b> the Penguins announced that Head Coach Dan Bylsma had signed a multi-year contract extension with the team.|$|E
5|$|In the 1976–77 {{season the}} Flyers' win total slipped from 51 to 48, {{but they still}} managed a 0.700 winning percentage. This marked the fourth {{consecutive}} year of having a 0.700 or better win percentage – once again winning their division and finishing first in the Campbell Conference. In the post season the <b>Flyers</b> again reached the semi-finals, but lost to the Bruins in four straight games. The following season the Flyers' record fell to 45–20–15 finishing second to the Islanders in both the division and the Conference. Shero again led the <b>Flyers</b> to the semi-finals, where they lost to the Bruins once more. At {{the end of the}} season Shero, who had one more year left on his contract, submitted a letter of resignation stating that the <b>Flyers</b> needed a change whether they realized it or not. <b>Flyers</b> management had previously heard rumors about Shero wanting to leave Philadelphia and re-join the Rangers organization, and refused to accept his letter of resignation. Shero then signed a $250,000, five-year contract with the Rangers to be their new Head Coach and General Manager, believing he no longer had a contractual agreement to the <b>Flyers.</b> A few weeks after signing Shero, the Rangers gave the <b>Flyers</b> their first-round pick in the 1978 draft (Ken Linseman) and cash as compensation, allowing the Rangers to avoid tampering charges.|$|E

5|$|The 1920 Muncie <b>Flyers</b> {{season was}} the franchise's inaugural {{season in the}} American Professional Football League (APFA)—later named the National Football League. The <b>Flyers</b> entered the season coming off a 4–1–1 record in 1919. Several representatives from the Ohio League wanted {{to form a new}} {{professional}} league; thus, the APFA was created. The 1920 team only played in one game that counted in the standings: a 45–0 loss against the Rock Island Independents. This game and the Columbus Panhandles–Dayton Triangles on the same date is considered to be the first league game featuring two APFA teams. The <b>Flyers</b> tried to schedule other games, but the opponents canceled to play better teams. As a result, the <b>Flyers</b> had to play the rest of the season's game versus local teams. In week 10, the <b>Flyers</b> won a game against the Muncie Offers More AC for the Muncie City Championship. No players from the 1920 Muncie <b>Flyers</b> were listed on the 1920 All-Pro Team, and no player has been enshrined in the Pro Football Hall of Fame.|$|E
5|$|The <b>Flyers</b> {{hosted a}} {{practice}} {{game against the}} Muncie Tigers on September 26, 1920, but {{the result of the}} game is unknown. The Flyers' first game of the season was against the Rock Island Independents. The Independents beat the <b>Flyers</b> 45–0. As a result, the Staleys, who were supposed to play the <b>Flyers</b> the next week, cancelled because they wanted to play a better team. The <b>Flyers</b> tried to schedule game {{for the next few weeks}} but were unsuccessful. Since there were no rules to keep players on teams, several Flyers' players left and played for other teams. The <b>Flyers</b> scheduled a game against the Cleveland Tigers three weeks later, but the game was cancelled because the Tigers decided to play against the Panhandles instead. The same result happened next week against the Dayton Triangles. The <b>Flyers</b> were challenged by the Gas City Tigers and Muncie Offers More AC—two teams of Muncie. These games are not counted in the APFA standings.|$|E

5|$|The <b>Flyers</b> {{last game}} of the 1920 season was against the Gas City Tigers. The Tigers signed up several players to help them defeat the <b>Flyers.</b> The first quarter was scoreless, as the only near score was from a failed drop kick from the <b>Flyers.</b> The first score of the game came in the second quarter. Weaver of the Tigers {{returned}} a punt 85yards for a touchdown. On the Tigers' next possession, they dropped a pass in the endzone on fourth down. Early in the third quarter, {{a member of the}} Tigers fumbled, and the <b>Flyers</b> recovered it on the 5-yard line. Huffine score a rushing touchdown on that possession to tie the game 7–7. The last score of the game came from the Flyers; Checkaye returned a punt 60yards for a touchdown to give the <b>Flyers</b> a 13–7 victory. The Tigers almost scored on their final possession on the game but fumbled.|$|E
5|$|Without any APFA wins, the <b>Flyers</b> {{could not}} contend for the APFA Championship. However, with wins against the Gas City Tigers and the Muncie Offers More AC, the <b>Flyers</b> {{claimed to have}} won the Indiana State Championship. Sportswriter Bruce Copeland {{compiled}} the All-Pro list for the 1920 season, but no player from the <b>Flyers</b> was on the list. Ken Huffine decided to be affiliated with the Chicago Stayles after the 1920 season, and Cooney Checkaye took over the role the following season. It did not help, and the Flyers' final year in the APFA was 1921. As of 2012, no players from the 1920 Muncie <b>Flyers</b> have been enshrined into the Pro Football Hall of Fame.|$|E
5|$|After {{their first}} {{victory of the}} season, the <b>Flyers</b> were {{challenged}} by the Muncie Offers More AC. The game was labelled as the Muncie City Championship. Since {{most of the other}} local teams' seasons were finished, both Muncie teams hired as many as 20 players for the game. The field was muddy, which caused Offers More AC to fumble the ball several times. In the third quarter, the <b>Flyers</b> scored two touchdowns to give them a 14–0 lead going into the fourth quarter. The <b>Flyers</b> added 10 more points—a touchdown and a field goal—in the final quarter to win the Championship 24–0.|$|E

5|$|Although the Sabres {{held the}} <b>Flyers</b> to two {{shots in the}} first period of game one, eight in the second, and were the {{beneficiaries}} of a 1:04 two-man advantage at one point, the game remained scoreless until the third period when the <b>Flyers</b> connected four times in a 4–1 victory. In game two, the Sabres were held to 19 shots on goal with none coming after Bobby Clarke scored at the 6:43 mark of the third period.|$|E
5|$|During the 1999–2000 season, on February 15, 2000, Brodeur was {{credited}} with his second career goal, as Brodeur was the last Devils player on the ice to touch the puck before Daymond Langkow of the <b>Flyers</b> accidentally put the puck into his own empty net during a delayed penalty call against the Devils. Brodeur had previously stopped an attempted <b>Flyers</b> shot.|$|E
5|$|In 1975–76 Shero {{guided the}} <b>Flyers</b> to a 51–13–16 record {{highlighted}} by a 36–2–2 home ice record. Again {{they won the}} Patrick division and finished first overall in the Campbell Conference. The season saw the club set franchise records in points and winning percentage. The season also witnessed an exhibition game, that {{would become one of}} the most famous games in <b>Flyers</b> history. In 1976 the Soviet Red Army team toured North America and played four games against NHL clubs. On January 11, 1976, the Russians matched up against the <b>Flyers</b> at the Spectrum in Philadelphia. Entering the game the Red Army team was unbeaten, defeating both Boston and the Rangers and registering a tie against the Canadiens. Shero had studied the Soviet style of play, even traveling to the Soviet Union during different off-seasons. Shero even implemented some of the Russian style into his own system, altering it slightly. With his knowledge of the Russian system, Shero devised a game plan. The Russian system involved making several passes often to where a player had just moved from. Shero instructed the Flyers' players not to chase the puck, but rather hold their positions. While in the offensive zone the Flyer forwards were to hold the puck as much as possible to avoid counter-attacks. The <b>Flyers</b> won the game by a final of 4–1 and outshot the Red Army 49–13. The victory led some to see the <b>Flyers</b> as the best team in the world. Following the playoffs that distinction would not last. Bernie Parent had suffered a back injury that limited him to eleven regular season games; he was able to return for the first-round series win versus Toronto. But the pain became too much for Parent to continue to play in subsequent series, and Shero was forced to use his back-up goaltender, Wayne Stephenson. The <b>Flyers</b> were also without second-line centre MacLeish, resulting in a depletion of scoring depth. Despite these setbacks Shero led Philadelphia past Boston in the semi-finals and back to the Stanley Cup Finals. However, the <b>Flyers</b> fell short of winning three straight cups, losing to Montreal in four consecutive games.|$|E
