Feige elaborated that [...] "much of the movie will still be based very much on [...] draft and the DNA of what Edgar has created up to this point", with Reed stepping in to direct and McKay reworking only parts of the script. [...] " [...] {{wanted to be sure}} that he wasn't just inheriting something or following someone else's lead. Or wasn't inheriting something that the evil studio had watered down to be something bad," [...] Feige continued. [...] "He looked at everything, he talked with us, and he said 'Number one, <b>I</b> <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> direction you're going in. And number two, I can add to it.'" ...|$|E

"For {{the reasons}} set forth below, I am {{of the opinion}} that federal courts do have the power to award damages for {{violation}} of 'constitutionally protected interests' and <b>I</b> <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Court that a traditional judicial remedy such as damages is appropriate to the vindication of the personal interests protected by the Fourth Amendment." ...|$|E
2500|$|CRAWFORD, Chief Judge (concurring in {{part and}} in the result): <b>I</b> <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> result in this case but I [...] "would reserve for another day the {{questions}} of whether and how Lawrence [...] applies to the military.

Marcum, [...] "the factual differences between Lawrence and Appellant's case are striking" [...] for the reasons mentioned by the majority {{as well as the}} circumstances surrounding the charges themselves.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>agreed</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> old man, and {{dismissed}} him. So {{soon as he}} was gone, I quitted my chamber, and all dust staineded as I was I made my way down to the garden. A turn in one of the boxwood-bordered alleys brought me suddenly face to face with Madonna Paola.|$|R

I wasn't hampered by the multiplicity of my business and social engagements that evening, so I could afford to pity Clark. It is always rather {{nice to be able}} to pity a person you dislike.|$|R

"I {{would not}} have you believe, Fitz Hamilton, that I am so cold blooded as it {{appeared}} when <b>I</b> <b>agreed</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Jerseyman that we would make no attempt at getting word to Saul. I am burning to let the lad know we stand ready at the first opportunity to give him aid, and to that end would walk down past the house where we are told he is imprisoned." ...|$|R
2500|$|Lustiger upheld papal {{authority}} in theology and morals: [...] "There are opinions {{and there is}} faith," [...] he said in 1997. [...] "When it is faith, <b>I</b> <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Pope because I am responsible for the faith." [...] Cardinal Lustiger was a strong believer in priestly celibacy and opposed abortion and the ordination of women. Although he fully endorsed John Paul II's views on bioethics, he considered condom use {{if one of the}} partners had HIV. He founded the Non-Governmental Organization Tib√©riade to attend to AIDS patients.|$|E
2500|$|Justice Thurgood Marshall dissented. In his view, {{the right}} to punish all {{individuals}} who commit crimes against tribal law within the reservation was a necessary aspect of the tribe's sovereignty. His dissent read, in full: <b>I</b> <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> court below that the [...] "power to preserve order on the reservation [...] [...] [...] is a {{sine qua non of}} the sovereignty that the Suquamish originally possessed." [...] Oliphant v. Schlie, 544 F.2d 1007, 1009 (CA9 1976). In the absence of affirmative withdrawal by treaty or statute, I am of the view that Indian tribes enjoy, as a necessary aspect of their retained sovereignty, {{the right to}} try and punish all persons who commit offenses against tribal law within the reservation. Accordingly, I dissent.|$|E
2500|$|Leonard Woolf {{wrote about}} Sackville-West, who, as an aristocrat, {{came from a}} very {{different}} world than {{he and his wife}} : [...] "She [...] belonged indeed to a world which was completely different from ours, and the long line of Sackvilles, Dorsets, Da La Warrs and Knole with its 365 rooms had put into her mind and heart an ingredient which was alien to us and at first made intimacy difficult". While Sackville-West was visiting Nicholson in Tehran, Woolf wrote to her: [...] "Then there's my character (you see how egoistical I am, for I only answer questions that are about myself), <b>I</b> <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> lack of jolly vulgarity. But then think about how I was brought up! No school, mooning about alone among my father's books, never a chance to pick up all that goes on in the schools-throwing balls: ragging: slang: vulgarity: scenes: jealousies: only rages with my half brothers and being walked off my legs round the Serpentine by my father". In her reply, Sackville-West wrote: [...] "But indeed, my upbringing wasn't so different from yours: I move about too, at Knole mostly, and haven't had a brother or sister to knock the corners off me. And I never went to school. If I am jolly and vulgar, you can cry quits on another count, for you have that interest in humanity which I can never manage-at least I have the interest, but not the diabolical skill in its practice which is yours. As I get older...I get more and more disagreeably solitary". Besides for having similar childhoods, both women had grown up with a profound sense of the weight of English history as Woolf's father Sir Leslie Stephen had been a leading contributor to The Dictionary of National Biography while Sackville-West had grown up at Knole House, one of the grand country houses of England. Likewise, Sackville-West had felt torn between her Spanish heritage which contrasted with the English grandeur she had been brought up in at Knole House while Woolf felt torn between the [...] "sobriety" [...] of her father's family vs. the [...] "flamboyance" [...] of her mother's family.|$|E

5000|$|As Johnson {{followed}} the recommendations and escalated the war, Dirksen gave him strong support {{in public and}} inside the Republican caucus. Some Republicans advised him {{that it would be}} to the party's advantage to oppose Johnson. Ford commented, [...] "I strongly felt that although <b>I</b> <b>agreed</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> goals of the Johnson administration in Vietnam, I vigorously criticized their prosecution of the war. Now, Dirksen never took that same hard-line position that I took." ...|$|R

Hwang explains that he was [...] "moved by {{the tale of the}} genuine love between two people. <b>I</b> <b>agreed</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> director's idea of showing it as pure love, like an uncut gem, without sloppily adding to it or embellishing it." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "As {{you well}} know, I {{came home from}} Canada {{to take care of}} him. Still, <b>I</b> <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> executors. If you can still persuade Dick to believe in you, he must be saved in spite of himself." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "There's {{argument}} and good logic in it," [...] said Paul; [...] "music is music, and it's always noisy, whether {{it comes from}} a fiddle or a jackass. Therefore <b>I</b> <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> old man, and say, Kill the beast." ...|$|E

'I tell you, ma'am,' said Mr Witherden, 'what I {{think as}} an honest man, which, as the poet observes, is the noblest work of God. <b>I</b> <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> poet in every particular, ma'am.

60|$|I am Darrell Standing. I {{was caught}} red-handed. Now {{the right and}} the wrong of this affair with Professor Haskell I shall not discuss. It was purely a private matter. The point is, that in a surge of anger, obsessed by that catastrophic red wrath that has cursed me down the ages, I killed my fellow professor. The court records show that I did; and, for once, <b>I</b> <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> court records.|$|E
60|$|Some {{people have}} a {{wonderful}} knack of extracting comfort from things. I am ashamed to say <b>I</b> <b>agreed</b> ostentatiously <b>with</b> <b>the</b> old lady. She developed the personal view of the matter.|$|R

60|$|THE GRAND DUCHESS. Nonsense! I {{say that}} if the people cannot govern themselves, they must be governed by {{somebody}}. If they will not do their duty without being half forced and half humbugged, somebody must force them and humbug them. Some energetic and capable minority must always be in power. Well, I am {{on the side of the}} energetic minority whose principles <b>I</b> <b>agree</b> <b>with.</b> <b>The</b> Revolution is as cruel as we were; but its aims are my aims.
