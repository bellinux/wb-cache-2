25|$|In October 1961, {{to appease}} the Tory right and dampen down an area of {{political}} controversy, Macmillan replaced Macleod as Colonial Secretary with Reginald Maudling, a much more emollient figure. Macleod replaced his old mentor Rab Butler as Leader of the House of Commons and Chairman of the Conservative Party organisation. There {{was something of a}} conflict of interest between these two jobs as the former, which Butler would have liked to retain, required its incumbent to retain good professional relations with the Labour Party so as to keep the Parliamentary timetable running smoothly, whereas the latter required him to play a leading role in partisan campaigning. In order that <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> salary he was also given the sinecure post of Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, a less prestigious office than the other sinecures of Lord Privy Seal or Lord President of the Council.|$|E
25|$|After {{two years}} without a Western Emperor, the Eastern court {{nominated}} Anthemius, a successful general who had a strong claim on the Eastern throne. He arrived in Italy with an army, supported by Marcellinus and his fleet; he married his daughter to Ricimer, and he was proclaimed Augustus in 467. In 468, at vast expense, the Eastern empire assembled an enormous force to help the West retake the Diocese of Africa. Marcellinus rapidly drove the Vandals from Sardinia and Sicily, and a land invasion evicted them from Tripolitania. The commander in chief with the main force defeated a Vandal fleet near Sicily and landed at Cape Bon. Here Genseric offered to surrender, if <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> five-day truce to prepare the process. He used the respite to prepare a full-scale attack preceded by fireships, which destroyed most of the Roman fleet and killed many of its soldiers. The Vandals were confirmed in their possession of the Diocese of Africa and they retook Sardinia and Sicily. Marcellinus was murdered, possibly on orders from Ricimer. The Praetorian prefect of Gaul, Arvandus, tried to persuade the new king of the Visigoths to rebel, {{on the grounds that}} Roman power in Gaul was finished anyway, but he refused.|$|E

25|$|With McMahon {{turning down}} his number-one {{contender}} spot against The Rock, WWF Commissioner Michaels awarded Austin the title shot {{the next night}} on Raw Is War. At , Stone Cold got a one-on-one match against McMahon in a steel cage match, with the WWF Championship opportunity at WrestleMania XV at stake. During the match, Paul Wight made his debut, breaking through from under the ring and attacking Austin. Wight's attack propelled Austin {{into the side of}} the cage forcing the cage to give way and dropping Austin to the floor first, making him the victor. Austin defeated The Rock at WrestleMania XV to win his third WWF Championship. Austin faced The Rock in a rematch at , in which Shane McMahon was the referee. During the match, Vince McMahon approached the ring, only to hand Austin back his Smoking Skull title belt and take Shane out of the proceedings. Austin won the match when another referee made the count. Austin would lose the title to The Undertaker at Over the Edge. Due to events revolving around Vince McMahon, Stephanie and Linda McMahon made Austin the Chief Executive Officer of the company. Vince and Shane McMahon challenged Austin to a handicap ladder match at King of the Ring with the CEO title on the line, which the duo of father and son won. The next night on Raw Is War, Austin made it clear that while he was the CEO of the company <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> title shot at any time and place to be determined by himself. Austin made the WWF Championship match that night on Raw Is War and defeated The Undertaker to win his fourth WWF Championship. However, after he won it The Undertaker came and hit him with the title belt, leading to a First Blood match between the two at Fully Loaded, where Mr. McMahon stipulated that if Austin lost he would never be able to wrestle for the WWF Championship again, and if Austin won he would never see McMahon again. Austin won after interference from X-Pac, hitting The Undertaker with a TV camera and gave McMahon a goodbye Stone Cold Stunner.|$|E
500|$|Three hundred girls {{auditioned for}} the role of Akeelah in Los Angeles, New York and Atlanta, with Palmer having auditioned five times to get the part. Atchison liked Palmer's acting, but the major factor in {{choosing}} her was the fact that at only age ten Palmer already had a profound interpretation of the script. He chose her as he did not want a kid whom he would command but instead someone with whom <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> collaboration: someone who would understand the role and [...] "would make this character her own."

500|$|Puritans {{gained control}} of the English Parliament in the early 1640s, {{and the issue of}} polity for the Anglican church was of major {{importance}} to congregations throughout England and its colonies. [...] To address this issue, the Westminster Assembly was convened in 1643. [...] Lord Say and Seal had scrapped his plans to immigrate to New England, along with other members of Parliament. He wrote to Cotton, Hooker, and Davenport in New England, [...] "urging them to return to England where they were needed as members of the Westminster Assembly". [...] None of the three attended the meeting, where an overwhelming majority of members were Presbyterian and only a handful represented independent (congregational) interests. [...] Despite the lopsided numbers, Cotton was interested in attending, though John Winthrop quoted Hooker as saying that he couldn't see the point of [...] "travelling 3,000 miles to agree with three men." [...] Cotton changed his mind about attending as events began to unfold leading to the First English Civil War, and he decided that <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> greater effect on the Assembly through his writings.|$|E

500|$|Shearer {{was born}} December 23, 1943 in Los Angeles, {{the son of}} Dora Warren (née Kohn) (d. 2008), a bookkeeper, and Mack Shearer. His parents were Jewish {{immigrants}} from Austria and Poland. Starting when Shearer was four years old, he had a piano teacher whose daughter worked as a child actress. The piano teacher later {{decided to make a}} career change and become a children's agent, as she knew people in the business through her daughter's work. The teacher asked Shearer's parents for permission to take him to an audition. Several months later, she called Shearer's parents and told them that she had gotten Shearer an audition for the radio show The Jack Benny Program. Shearer received the role when he was seven years old. He described Jack Benny as [...] "very warm and approachable [...] He was a guy who dug the idea of other people on the show getting laughs, which sort of spoiled me for other people in comedy." [...] Shearer {{said in an interview that}} one person who [...] "took him under his wing" [...] and was one of his best friends during his early days in show business was voice actor Mel Blanc, who voiced many animated characters, including Bugs Bunny, Daffy Duck and Barney Rubble. Shearer made his film debut in the 1953 film Abbott and Costello Go to Mars, in which he only had a small part. Later that year, he made his first big film performance in The Robe. Throughout his childhood and teenage years he worked in television, film, and radio. In 1957, Shearer played the precursor to the Eddie Haskell character in the pilot episode of the television series Leave It to Beaver. After the filming, Shearer's parents said they did not want him to be a regular in a series. Instead they wanted him to just do occasional work so that <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> normal childhood. Shearer and his parents made the decision not to accept the role in the series if it was picked up by a television network.|$|E
2500|$|Snyder {{read his}} poem [...] "A Berry Feast" [...] at the poetry reading at the Six Gallery in San Francisco (October 7, 1955) that heralded {{what was to}} become known as the San Francisco Renaissance. This also marked Snyder's first {{involvement}} with the Beats, although he was {{not a member of the}} original New York circle, but rather entered the scene through his association with Kenneth Rexroth. As recounted in Kerouac's Dharma Bums, even at age 25 Snyder felt <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> role in the fateful future meeting of West and East. Snyder's first book, Riprap, which drew on his experiences as a forest lookout and on the trail-crew in Yosemite, was published in 1959.|$|E
2500|$|In 1517, Pope Leo X {{added another}} thirty-one cardinals, {{bringing}} the total to sixty-five so that <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> supportive majority in the College of Cardinals. [...] Paul IV brought the total to seventy. His immediate successor, Pope Pius IV (1559–1565), raised the limit to seventy-six. Although Ferdinand I, Holy Roman Emperor sought a limit of 26 and complained about the size {{and quality of the}} College to his legates to the Council of Trent, and some French attendees advocated a limit of 24, that Council did not prescribe a limit {{to the size of the}} College. By the papacy of Sixtus V (1585–1590), the number was set at seventy on 3 December 1587, divided among fourteen cardinal-deacons, fifty cardinal-priests, and six cardinal-bishops.|$|E

2500|$|Inspired by a {{character}} from the Old Testament, this {{was made of}} white marble. It shows Hagar with her hands in prayer and staring slightly up but not straight across. Hagar was the handmaid or slave of Abraham's wife Sarah. Being unable to conceive a child, Sarah gave Hagar to Abraham so that <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> son by her. Hagar gave birth to Abraham's firstborn son Ishmael. After Sarah {{gave birth to her}} own son Isaac, she resented Hagar and made Abraham [...] "cast Hagar into the wilderness". Lewis uses Hagar to symbolize the African mother in the United States. She represented the abuse of African women. Lewis had a tendency to sculpt historically strong women, as demonstrated not just in Hagar but also in Lewis's Cleopatra piece. Lewis also depicted regular women in great situations, emphasizing their strength.|$|E
2500|$|Mark Chorvinsky, {{editor of}} Strange magazine, {{promoted}} Wallace's {{claim that he}} tipped off Patterson exactly {{where to look for}} a Bigfoot. Chorvinsky wrote, [...] "'Roger Patterson came [...] dozens of times pumping me on this Bigfoot,' Ray Wallace explained to researcher Dennis Pilchis in 1982. 'I felt sorry for Roger Patterson. He told me he had cancer of the lymph glands and he was desperately broke and he wanted to try to get something where <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> little income. Well, he went down there exactly where I told him. I told him, 'You go down there and hang around on that bank. Stay up there and watch that spot.'" [...] David Daegling summarized Chorvinsky's argument and concluded that Wallace [...] "had a degree of involvement" [...] with the Patterson–Gimlin film, and that this gave grounds for suspicion of it.|$|E
2500|$|As an umpire, Quirk {{often is}} {{responsible}} for breaking up scuffles among players. [...] During a 1999 NFL season game between the Chicago Bears and St. Louis Rams, Quirk attempted {{to break up a}} skirmish between the Rams Jeff Robinson and the Bears Ty Hallock. [...] Quirk grabbed Robinson by the waist and tackled him to the ground. [...] Robinson was ejected by Quirk for throwing a punch at Hallock. [...] As the game was concluding, Robinson asked Quirk if <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> photo taken together. [...] Robinson later had the photo enlarged and hung it on the wall of his den. [...] After the game, Todd Lyght commented on Quirk's tackle saying, [...] "He did that with authority, and that was an older guy, too. That wasn't one of the young umps. He put it on him. I think that might open up (ESPN's) Prime Time." [...] Dick Vermeil, then-coach of the Rams, later joked with Robinson, asking him, [...] "(Quirk is a) Hell of a tackler, isn't he?" ...|$|E

2500|$|At the University of Michigan, Miller first {{majored in}} journalism {{and worked for}} the student paper, the Michigan Daily. It was during this time that he wrote his first play, No Villain. Miller {{switched}} his major to English, and subsequently won the Avery Hopwood Award for No Villain. The award brought him his first recognition and led him to begin to consider that <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> career as a playwright. [...] Miller enrolled in a playwriting seminar taught by the influential Professor Kenneth Rowe, who instructed him in his early forays into playwriting; Rowe emphasized how a play is built {{in order to achieve}} its intended effect, or what Miller called [...] "the dynamics of play construction". Rowe provided realistic feedback along with much-needed encouragement, and became a lifelong friend. Miller retained strong ties to his alma mater throughout the rest of his life, establishing the university's Arthur Miller Award in 1985 and Arthur Miller Award for Dramatic Writing in 1999, and lending his name to the Arthur Miller Theatre in 2000. In 1937, Miller wrote Honors at Dawn, which also received the Avery Hopwood Award.|$|E
2500|$|Skills are {{categorized}} by difficulty: Easy, Average, Hard, and Very Hard. Easy skills cost few points to purchase levels in, {{and the cost}} per skill level increases with each level of difficulty. [...] Game mechanics allow that eventually it may be less expensive to {{raise the level of}} the base attribute the skills depend on as opposed to purchasing higher levels of skills. [...] A player can generally purchase a skill for his character at any level he or she can afford. [...] The lower you choose the fewer points it costs to buy the skill, and the higher you go, the more points it costs. Some skills have default levels, which indicate the level rating a character has when using that skill untrained (i.e. not purchased). For example, a character with a Dexterity of 12, is using the Climbing skill untrained. Climbing has a default of DX-5 or ST-5, which means that using the skill untrained gives him a Climbing skill level of 7 (12-5) if he tied it to the Dexterity stat. If the character had a higher Strength stat, <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> better chance of success if he tied the Climbing skill there instead.|$|E
2500|$|In June 1986, Berdella {{encountered}} a 21-year-old male prostitute and former acquaintance of his named Todd Stoops at Liberty Memorial Park. Stoops {{and his wife}} had briefly resided with Berdella in 1984; he accepted an invitation to accompany Berdella to his house with an initial incentive of the two simply sharing lunch. Berdella would later stress to investigators he had been extremely physically attracted to Stoops, and this victim was held captive for two weeks before he died, with Berdella gradually making concerted efforts to terrify his captive and render him a cooperative and incapacitated sex slave with efforts including forcing Stoops to endure electrical shocks through his closed eyes in an effort to blind him, and injecting drain cleaner into his larynx in an (unsuccessful) effort to render him mute. On one occasion on the second week of his capture, Stoops asked Berdella if <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> soft drink and a sandwich, which Berdella refused, at which point Stoops burst into tears. Berdella stated that, towards the end of Stoops' two-week period of capture, he did attempt to feed Stoops ice cream and soup, but his captive [...] "wasn't able to keep anything down." [...] Moreover, Stoops [...] "was so weak he was unable to breathe while in a sitting position." [...] His assumption was that this victim died of a combination of a fever and blood loss contracted due to the repeated sexual assaults and abuse he had been forced to endure, which had included enduring the rupturing of his anal cavity with his (Berdella's) fist.|$|E
