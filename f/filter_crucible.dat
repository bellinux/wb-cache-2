50|$|Depending on the {{procedure}} followed, the filter {{might be a}} piece of ashless filter paper in a fluted funnel, or a <b>filter</b> <b>crucible.</b> Filter paper is convenient because it does not typically require cleaning before use; however, filter paper can be chemically attacked by some solutions (such as concentrated acid or base), and may tear during the filtration of large volumes of solution.|$|E
30|$|The Ti-containing eluate {{collected}} from the DGA column was heated to boiling and the pH adjusted to 8.0 with 25 % ammonia solution. As a consequence, a black, flaky precipitate formed immediately and transformed into white TiO 2 over a waiting period of 40  min. The precipitate was filtered through a glass <b>filter</b> <b>crucible</b> (30  mL, pore size 10 – 16  μm, Duran Group GmbH, Germany), heated to 400  °C, in air, and kept at this temperature for 1  h to ensure complete oxidation. XRD-measurements were employed for the specification analysis of the recovered target material.|$|E
30|$|After the incubation, {{the test}} flasks were added 5  mL of 20  % sulfosalicylic acid {{solution}} and left {{at room temperature}} for 30  min to precipitate indigested protein. After 30  min of precipitation, undigested samples were filtered through pre-dried and weighed glass filter crucibles (Filter Crucibles CFE Por. 2, Robu, Hattert, Germany) containing 400  mg of Celite as filter aid using the Fibertec System (Fibertec System 1021 Cold Extractor, Tecator, Hӧganӓs, Sweden). The test flasks were rinsed twice by 1  % sulfosalicylic acid solution. Undigested samples in glass <b>filter</b> <b>crucible</b> were rinsed twice with 10  mL of 95  % ethanol and 10  mL of 99.5  % acetone. Glass filter crucibles with undigested samples were dried at 130  °C for 6  h. After 1  h cooling in a desiccator, glass filter crucibles were weighed.|$|E

The test flasks were rinsed twice by distilled water. Undigested samples in glass <b>filter</b> <b>crucibles</b> were rinsed twice with 10  mL of 95  % ethanol and 99.5  % acetone. Then, glass <b>filter</b> <b>crucibles</b> with undigested samples were dried at 130  °C for 6  h. After 1  h cooling in a desiccator, glass <b>filter</b> <b>crucibles</b> were weighed.|$|R
30|$|After incubation, {{the second}} step of the {{procedure}} simulated the digestion in the small intestine. Firstly, 10  mL of sodium phosphate buffer solution (0.2  M, pH 6.8) and 5  mL of NaOH (0.6  M, pH 13.8) {{were added to the}} samples. Then, pH was adjusted to 6.8 using 1  M HCl or NaOH. Thereafter, 1  mL of freshly prepared pancreatin solution (50  mg/mL; 4  × USP, P 1750, Pancreatin from porcine pancreas, Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) was added. After incubation in a shaking incubator at 39 °C for 18  h, 5  mL of 20 % sulfosalicylic acid solution was added and samples were left for 30  min at room temperature to precipitate the indigestible protein. The samples were then filtered through pre-dried and -weighed glass <b>filter</b> <b>crucibles</b> (<b>Filter</b> <b>Crucibles</b> CFE Por. 2, Robu, Hattert, Germany) containing 400  mg of Celite using the Fibertec System (Fibertec System 1021 Cold Extractor, Tecator, Hӧganӓs, Sweden).

5000|$|In {{the area}} of {{chemical}} analysis, crucibles are used in quantitative gravimetric chemical analysis (analysis by measuring mass of an analyte or its derivative). Common crucible use may be as follows. A residue or precipitate in a chemical analysis method can be collected or filtered from some sample or solution on special [...] "ashless" [...] <b>filter</b> paper. The <b>crucible</b> and lid to be used are pre-weighed very accurately on an analytical balance. After some possible washing and/or pre-drying of this filtrate, the residue on the filter paper can {{be placed in the}} crucible and fired (heated at very high temperature) until all the volatiles and moisture are driven out of the sample residue in the crucible. The [...] "ashless" [...] filter paper is completely burned up in this process. The crucible with the sample and lid is allowed to cool in a desiccator. The crucible and lid with the sample inside is weighed very accurately again only after it has completely cooled to room temperature (higher temperature would cause air currents around the balance giving inaccurate results). The mass of the empty, pre-weighed crucible and lid is subtracted from this result to yield the mass of the completely dried residue in the crucible.|$|R
