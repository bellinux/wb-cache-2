40|$|The {{estimation}} of <b>discount</b> <b>factors</b> {{is a central}} issue in empirical finance, particularly {{in the literature on}} excess volatility. In particular, it is difficult to find empirical <b>discount</b> <b>factors</b> that are volatile enough to account for fluctuations in asset prices. This paper constructs <b>discount</b> <b>factors</b> from some macroeconomic time series commonly used in empirical models of asset prices. Data for the U. S. stock market imply some evidence that <b>discount</b> <b>factors</b> relate to macroeconomic conditions, but comparison of the estimated <b>discount</b> <b>factors</b> to Hansen-Jagannathan (1991) bounds shows that the candidate <b>discount</b> <b>factors</b> cannot account for the volatility in asset returns. ...|$|R

2500|$|Economic theory {{suggests}} that optimal discounting involves the exponential discounting of value over time. [...] This model assumes that people and institutions should discount the value of rewards and punishments at a constant rate according to how delayed they are in time. [...] While economically rational, recent evidence suggests that people and animals do not discount exponentially. [...] Many studies suggest that humans and animals discount future values according to a hyperbolic discounting curve where the <b>discount</b> <b>factor</b> decreases with {{the length of the}} delay (for example, waiting from today to tomorrow involves more loss of value than waiting from twenty days to twenty-one days). [...] Further evidence for non-constant delay discounting is suggested by the differential involvement of various brain regions in evaluating immediate versus delayed consequences. [...] Specifically, the prefrontal cortex is activated when choosing between rewards at a short delay or a long delay, but regions associated with the dopamine system are additionally activated when the option of an immediate reinforcer is added. Additionally, intertemporal choices differ from economic models because they involve anticipation (which may involve a neurological [...] "reward" [...] even if the reinforcer is delayed), self-control (and the breakdown of it when faced with temptations), and representation (how the choice is framed may influence desirability of the reinforcer), none of which are accounted for by a model that assumes economic rationality.|$|E

The leakage effect depends on demand and supply elasticities. Permanence reflects the saturation and volatility characteristics of carbo...|$|R

40|$|To obtain {{effective}} fusion {{results of}} multi source evidences with different importance, an evidence fusion method with importance <b>discounting</b> <b>factors</b> based on neutrosopic probability analysis in DSmT framework is proposed. First, the reasonable evidence sources are selected out {{based on the}} statistical analysis of the pignistic probability functions of single focal elements. Secondly, the neutrosophic probability analysis is conducted based on the similarities of the pignistic probability functions from the prior evidence knowledge of the reasonable evidence sources. Thirdly, the importance <b>discounting</b> <b>factors</b> of the reasonable evidence sources are obtained based on the neutrosophic probability analysis and the reliability <b>discounting</b> <b>factors</b> of the real-time evidences are calculated based on probabilistic-based distances. Fourthly, the real-time evidences are discounted by the importance <b>discounting</b> <b>factors</b> and then the evidences with the mass assignments of neutrosophic empty sets are discounted by the reliability <b>discounting</b> <b>factors.</b> Finally, DSmT+PCR 5 of importance discounted evidences is applied.
