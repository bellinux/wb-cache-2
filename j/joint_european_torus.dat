Beryllium has also been proposed as a cladding material for nuclear fuel rods, because of its good combination of mechanical, chemical, and nuclear properties. Beryllium fluoride is one of the constituent salts of the eutectic salt mixture FLiBe, which is used as a solvent, moderator and coolant in many hypothetical molten salt reactor designs, including the liquid fluoride thorium reactor (LFTR).|$|E

Prior to this, an experimental fusion reactor (the <b>Joint</b> <b>European</b> <b>Torus)</b> had been built at Culham in Oxfordshire.|$|E
40|$|The {{diamagnetic}} drift {{effects on}} the low-n magnetohydrodynamic instabilities at the high-mode (H-mode) pedestal are investigated in this paper with the inclusion of bootstrap current for equilibrium and rotation effects for stability, where n is the toroidal mode number. The AEGIS (Adaptive EiGenfunction Independent Solutions) code [L. J. Zheng, M. T. Kotschenreuther, J. Comp. Phys. 211, (2006) ] is extended to include the diamagnetic drift effects. This {{can be viewed as}} the lowest order approximation of the finite Larmor radius effects in consideration of the pressure gradient steepness at the pedestal. The H-mode discharges at <b>Jointed</b> <b>European</b> <b>Torus</b> (JET) is reconstructed numerically using the VMEC code [P. Hirshman and J. C. Whitson, Phys. Fluids 26, 3553 (1983) ], with bootstrap current taken into account. Generally speaking, the diamagnetic drift effects are stabilizing. Our results show that the effectiveness of diamagnetic stabilization depends sensitively on the safe factor value (q_s) at the safety-factor reversal or plateau region. The diamagnetic stabilization are weaker, when q_s is larger than an integer; while stronger, when q_s is smaller or less larger than an integer. We also find that the diamagnetic drift effects also depend sensitively on the rotation direction. The diamagnetic stabilization in the co-rotation case is stronger than in the counter rotation case with respect to the ion diamagnetic drift direction. Comment: 29 pages, 13 figure...|$|R

25|$|Construction of the ITER Tokamak complex {{started in}} 2013 and the {{building}} costs are now over US$14 billion as of June 2015. The facility is expected to finish its construction phase in 2021 and will start commissioning the reactor that same year and initiate plasma experiments in 2025 with full deuterium–tritium fusion experiments starting in 2035. If ITER becomes operational, it will become the largest magnetic confinement plasma physics experiment in use with a plasma volume of 840 cubic meters, surpassing the <b>Joint</b> <b>European</b> <b>Torus</b> by almost a factor of 10. The first commercial demonstration fusion power station, named DEMO, is proposed to follow on from the ITER project.|$|E
25|$|While {{this was}} taking place, the {{original}} ZETA II proposal {{had been growing}} ever-larger, eventually specifying currents as powerful as the <b>Joint</b> <b>European</b> <b>Torus</b> that was built years later. As it seemed this was beyond the state-of-the-art, the project was eventually cancelled in February 1959. A new proposal soon took its place, the Intermediate-Current Stability Experiment (ICSE). ICSE was designed {{to take advantage of}} further stabilising effects noticed in M-theory, which suggested that very fast pinches would cause the current to flow only in the outer layer of the plasma, which should be much more stable. Over time, this machine grew to be about the same size as ZETA; ICSE had a 6m major diameter and 1m minor diameter, powered by bank of capacitors storing 10MJ at 100kV.|$|E
25|$|The Nord-100 was {{introduced}} in 1979, which was specialized at flexibility and focused on administrative applications. When Digital launched their VAX-11 in 1977, Norsk Data had the Nord-5 32-bit computer ready for CERN. As the VAX-11 was 32-bit and regarded as a superminicomputer, Norsk Data did not initially {{see it as a}} competitor since the Nord-5 had much better processing power. Nord-50 had similar processing power to the Nord-5, but was not a general-purpose computer. The 32 bit computer used a Nord-10 front processor that ran the SINTRAN III operating system. Development of the ND-500 started in 1978 and had so fundamental changes to the system architecture (was not made from bit-slice components but microprammed with a new instruction set) that all software had to be rewritten - except for the SINTRAN. The computer was launched in 1981, but with fundamental shortcomings imposed by the OS It was much faster than the VAX, but did not meet the general customers' expectation of being a multi-purpose computer. Later models improved the performance and tweaking of the system allowed it to become a multipurpose system.at the performance of a special purpose super computer as sold by Cray. A major contract with the ND-500 was the <b>Joint</b> <b>European</b> <b>Torus</b> project, which took delivery of twenty-seven ND-100 and -500 units. Development of the ND-5000 started before the ND-500 was completed. The design was changed to become more modular; this increased the development costs, but reduced production costs and increased scalability. On the ND5000, components were placed in cards that were interconnected, initially to simplify cooling but also to enable the high clock frequency If an electric current is switched at a clock frequency of 1GHz, it travel about one foot per cycle, so 10cm is a delay of a clock cycle at 3GHz. The ND-500 computers had timing problems caused by wire-distance, and going faster just required everything to be close.|$|E
