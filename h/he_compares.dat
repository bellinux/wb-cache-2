5|$|The {{bones and}} joints form a {{mechanical}} structure with features comparable to hinges, mortice and tenon and {{ball and socket}} joints, etc, to provide both support and suitable flexibility. <b>He</b> <b>compares</b> the spine to The Iron Bridge at Bishop Wearmouth.|$|E
5|$|Hazlitt often focuses, as well, on {{specific}} traits {{by comparing the}} characters not to those of real life but to characters in Shakespeare's other plays, comparing, for example, Iago with Edmund in King Lear. His interest {{in the art of}} drama emerges even more obviously when <b>he</b> <b>compares</b> Iago with the villainous character Zanga in Edward Young's The Revenge (1721), still a popular play in Hazlitt's day.|$|E

5|$|In a {{preface to}} his 1926 drama Korbannja Kong-Ek (The Victim of Kong-Ek), Kwee Tek Hoay {{wrote that he}} had drawn {{inspiration}} from the realist Norwegian playwright Henrik Ibsen in that work, having read and reread the author's plays. Damono finds signs of Ibsen's influence already present in Allah jang Palsoe. <b>He</b> <b>compares</b> the stage directions in Allah jang Palsoe to those in Ibsen's Hedda Gabler and finds them to be similar in their level of detail.|$|E
5|$|Jim Dawson devoted {{an entire}} chapter of his 2006 Modern History of the Fart to Shatner's alleged {{flatulence}} in Mind Meld, which <b>he</b> <b>compares</b> {{to the sound}} of someone stepping on a tribble. G. Noel Gross of DVD Talk compared the excitement over this sound to that evinced by adolescent boys watching pornography, and compared the level of scrutiny devoted to the scene to that received by the Zapruder film of the Kennedy assassination.|$|E
5|$|After {{returning}} to Earth, Van den Berg {{continued to work}} on crystal growth experiments at EG in California and he became the head for the section of materials science. At a later time he moved to Florida to become a chief scientist at the Constellation Technology Corporation. At age 72, he continued to work up to 40 hours a week and grow crystals, a process <b>he</b> <b>compares</b> to gardening. The crystals he grows (Mercuric Iodide crystals) are used to make precision detectors for nuclear radiation. These detectors are used in medical applications, by the defense industry and the International Atomic Energy Agency.|$|E

5|$|In The Greek Myths (1955), Robert Graves views Oenopion as his {{perennial}} Year-King, at {{the stage}} where the king pretends to die {{at the end of}} his term and appoints a substitute, in this case Orion, who actually dies in his place. His blindness is iconotropy from a picture of Odysseus blinding the Cyclops, mixed with a purely Hellenic solar legend: the Sun-hero is captured and blinded by his enemies at dusk, but escapes and regains his sight at dawn, when all beasts flee him. Graves sees the rest of the myth as a syncretism of diverse stories. These include Gilgamesh and the Scorpion-Men, Set becoming a scorpion to kill Horus and the story of Aqhat and Yatpan from Ras Shamra, as well as a conjectural story of how the priestesses of Artemis Opis killed a visitor to their island of Ortygia. <b>He</b> <b>compares</b> Orion's birth from the bull's hide to a West African rainmaking charm and claims that the son of Poseidon should be a rainmaker.|$|E
5|$|On {{the weekend}} of Jack Donaghy's (Alec Baldwin) 51st birthday, his {{advances}} with CNBC host Avery Jessup (Elizabeth Banks) are called into question when he learns that his high school sweetheart, Nancy Donovan (Julianne Moore), has finally been divorced from her husband. Jack spends evenings having dinner and wine with both, against Liz Lemon's (Tina Fey) suggestion {{that it is a}} bad idea. <b>He</b> <b>compares</b> Nancy to actor Lee Marvin, after watching a movie marathon starring Marvin, and Avery to baseball player Derek Jeter, after he spends time with Avery at Jeter's home. He is moved by the thoughtful birthday gifts both women give him. Jack is torn between the easygoing, middle-class Nancy and his successful, wealthy counterpart Avery, and does not know whom to choose.|$|E

25|$|Plagge’s {{efforts are}} corroborated by {{survivor}} testimony, historical documents found in Germany, and Plagge’s own testimony {{found in a}} letter he wrote in 1957, a year before his death. In this letter <b>he</b> <b>compares</b> himself with the character of Dr Rieux in Albert Camus' novel The Plague and describes his hopeless struggle against a plague of death that slowly envelops the inhabitants of his city.|$|E
25|$|Roberts {{notes that}} the entire first chapter of View of the Hebrews {{describes}} the siege of Jerusalem by the Romans in A.D. 70. <b>He</b> <b>compares</b> this chapter to the first chapters of the Book of Mormon, in which Lehi prophesies {{of the destruction of}} Jerusalem prior to his departure circa 600 B.C. Mormon apologists argue that View of the Hebrews does not refer to the earlier destruction of Jerusalem by the Babylonians circa 586 B.C.|$|E

25|$|The book is {{primarily}} {{designed for use}} by counterterrorism and law enforcement officials. Terrorist Recognition Handbook is structured into six main sections of information and resources. Appendix resources include explanations of combustible materials, a reference to existing terrorist networks, {{and a list of}} works cited. Nance's main thesis throughout the work is that law enforcement officials must remain vigilant for potential terrorist activities. <b>He</b> <b>compares</b> and contrasts the field of counterterrorism to ordinary criminal prevention, noting that in both cases law enforcement officials should become experts on developing awareness of commons behavior patterns of suspects.|$|E
25|$|Ariel {{is widely}} viewed as a male character, {{although}} this view has wavered over the years, especially in the Restoration, when, for the most part, women played the role. Ariel has also been involved, though lightly, {{in the debate over}} the colonialist nature of the play, as scholars have tried to determine how <b>he</b> <b>compares</b> to the more rebellious Caliban in terms of service to the European Prospero. Whenever Caliban desired not to obey the command of Prospero, Ariel would persuade him to do the work, either by using magical powers or by using force.|$|E
25|$|Taylor {{presents}} a more pancultural {{view of the}} cauldron's images; he concludes that the deities and scenes portrayed on the cauldron are not specific to one culture, but many. <b>He</b> <b>compares</b> Rhiannon, whom he thinks is the figure of plate f, with Hariti, an ogress of Bactrian mythology. In addition, {{he points to the}} similarity between the female figure of plate B and the Hindu goddess Lakshmi, whose depictions are often accompanied by elephants. Wheel gods are also cross-cultural with deities like Taranis and Vishnu, a god from Hinduism.|$|E

25|$|That he {{must have}} been well practised in {{surveying}} is shown by his descriptions of surveying instruments, especially the water level or chorobates, which <b>he</b> <b>compares</b> favourably with the groma, a device using plumb lines. They were essential in all building operations, but especially in aqueduct construction, where a uniform gradient was important to the provision of a regular supply of water without damage to the walls of the channel. He also developed one of the first odometers, consisting of a wheel of known circumference that dropped a pebble into a container on every rotation.|$|E
25|$|As {{a writer}} of verse <b>he</b> <b>compares</b> unfavourably with his uncle. All his pieces, with the {{exception}} of a libellus supplex to King James, are written in Scots. He translated a portion of the Zodiacus vitae of Palingenius, and adapted some passages from Scaliger under the title of Description of the Spainyarts naturall. His Spiritual Propine of a Pastour to his People (1598), The Black Bastill, a lamentation for the kirk (1611), Thrie may keip Counsell, give Twa be away, The Beliefe of the Singing Soul, Davids Tragique Fall, and a number of sonnets show no originality and indifferent technical ability.|$|E
25|$|Kabakov {{claims the}} albums are a genre somewhere between {{several types of}} art {{including}} literature, fine arts, and cinematography. “Most of all,” he suggests, “the ‘albums’ are a type of ‘domestic theater’…like old theater conducted on a town square in broad daylight”. <b>He</b> <b>compares</b> his albums to theater where the viewer is bound by action and darkness, which {{does not allow for}} examination and evaluation of the action. The interest in giving the viewer the freedom to interact and interpret the artwork is central to Kabakov’s oeuvre. None of his works are didactic or attempt to deliver a political statement.|$|E
50|$|The main {{subjects}} {{of many of}} his other poems were music and color, which, at times, <b>he</b> <b>compared</b> to love or lust.|$|R
