5000|$|Poverty Reduction Strategy Papers (PRSPs) are {{documents}} {{required by the}} International Monetary Fund (IMF) and World Bank before a country {{can be considered for}} debt relief within the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) initiative. PRSPs are also required before low-income countries can receive aid from most major <b>donors</b> <b>and</b> <b>lenders.</b> [...] The IMF specifies that the PRSP should be formulated according to five core principles. The PRSP should be country-driven, result-oriented, comprehensive, partnership-oriented, and based on a long-term perspective. The PRS process encourages countries to develop a more poverty-focused government and to own their own strategies through developing the plan in close consultation with the population. A comprehensive poverty analysis and wide-ranging participation are vital parts of the PRSP formulation process. There are many challenges to PRS effectiveness, such as state capacity to carry out the established strategy. Criticism of PRSP include aid conditionality, donor influence, and poor fulfillment of the participatory aspect.|$|E

40|$|The 1990 s saw a {{remarkable}} {{change in the}} rhetoric of international <b>donor</b> <b>and</b> <b>lender</b> agencies. The “magic of the market” paradigm of the previous decade {{gave way to a}} “balanced” strategy in which the state had a crucial role to play. The primacy of economic growth gave way to an emphasis on “poverty reduction”, with poverty being defined not simply in income terms but as a “multidimensional” construct, also covering low levels of education and health, vulnerability and powerlessness. To address this broad agenda, agencies turned to experts on “social development”, often providing a welcome boost to their own previously somewhat marginalised social development teams. This concern with social issues and social context lead to a greatly expanded demand for new methodologies and methods which could provide improved “knowledge” and “understanding” of social processes. A battery of “toolkits”, “manuals” and “sourcebooks” were produced, each of which promised not only to meet this demand but to do so quickly, efficiently and often in partnership with local people. This Working Paper reviews some of the main methodological approaches to emerge from this period, reflecting on both their ambitious objectives and somewhat more prosaic limitations...|$|R
40|$|International audienceOver {{the course}} of the 1990 s, donor enthusiasm for {{participation}} came to be institutionalized in a variety of ways. One particular methodology [...] Participatory Rural Appraisal (PRA) [...] came to enjoy phenomenal popularity. New aid modalities may have shifted <b>donor</b> <b>and</b> <b>lender</b> concern away from the grassroots towards "policy dialogue. " But "civil society participation," "social accountability," and "empowerment" [...] some of the issues PRA grapples with [...] retain a place in the new aid discourse. PRA and its variants also continue to be used by government agencies, non-governmental, and community-based organizations in local-level assessment, planning, monitoring, and evaluation, as well as in national-level poverty assessments. It has sometimes been conflated, by <b>donors</b> <b>and</b> critics alike, with doing participatory development, and has elicited critiques that often go far beyond the bounds of the methodological. Yet these critics have tended to be academics with little experience as practitioners or facilitators. In this article, we draw on an action research project with PRA practitioners. We explore, through their critical reflections, some of the conundrums and contradictions faced by those who were active as PRA practitioners in the early 1990 s. We suggest that the story of PRA's success and of subsequent concerns about abuse and misuse by mainstream development institutions offers broader lessons with continued salience for development...|$|R

40|$|In recent years, {{citizens}} {{in many countries}} {{have been on the}} receiving end of a wave of interest from governments, NGOs, <b>donors</b> <b>and</b> <b>lenders</b> in ways of involving them more actively in shaping decisions that affect their lives. Innovative experiments in governance have opened up spaces for public involvement in deliberation over policies and a greater degree of control over certain kinds of resources (Fung and Wright 2000, Goetz and Gaventa 2001). Levering open arenas once closed off to citizen voice or public scrutiny, these moves have helped to widen political space for citizens to play more of a part in shaping some of the decisions that affect their lives. Forms of political participation associated with liberal democracy have come to be complemented with a new architecture of democratic practice, built on familiar foundations and offering ambiguous new political opportunities. Whether in budgeting, policy dialogue, planning, project appraisal, poverty assessment, monitoring or evaluation, ‘participatory ’ alternatives to expert-driven processes have gained ground. 1 These moves have given rise to new interactions and institutions, blurring old boundaries and creating new configurations of power and resistance. Efforts to involve citizens more directly in processes of governance are inspired, an...|$|E

40|$|M. Comm. For {{twenty years}} Uganda {{suffered}} the disastrous {{consequences of a}} system of rule in which there were no limits to the exercise of power. During this period the country went through no less than seven different regimes, all of which ignored {{the rule of law and}} left people without a sense of personal security or power. Many Ugandans were forced into exile and those staying on withdrew from politics, leaving politicians to conduct their business without any accountability. The National Resistance Movement (NRM) Government, led by President Y oweri Museveni, came to power in early 1986. This brought an end to the political instability and economic decline, which had plagued the country hitherto. Under his leadership, the nation embarked on an ambitious economic recovery program, supported by the IMF, the World Bank, and other donors. The key elements of this successful program have been the restoration of fiscal and monetary discipline; the improvement of the incentive structure and investment climate for exports and other production activities; the rehabilitation of the country's social, economic and institutional infrastructure; and the promotion of increased savings and investment. The economic reforms implemented by the present government in Uganda since 1986, coupled with political stability, have contributed to economic growth rates averaging 6 % per annum in the last decade. This has made Uganda one of the fastest growing countries in Africa. Inflation is under control and has been maintained below 10 % per annum for the last four years. Most economic activities are fully liberalized and open to foreign investment. There are no restrictions to 100 % foreign ownership of investments and no barriers to remittance of dividends. Uganda's shilling is fully convertible and has remained stable over the last years. The foreign exchange market is now wholly liberalized following a move by government, effective July 1997 to liberalize capital account transactions. Uganda is now one of about only five countries in the whole of Africa that have no restrictions on capital amount transfers. Within Africa and the emerging markets, Uganda enjoys a high status with <b>donors</b> <b>and</b> <b>lenders.</b> For the future, it is important to ensure that economic policy does not ignore social expenditure or the poverty dimension. In addition, President Museveni himself has repeatedly stressed the importance of attracting more private investment to Uganda in order to replace the foreign aid which can only be regarded as temporary. Other sectors needing attention are industrialization and privatization. As a landlocked country, Uganda needs to look to markets among its immediate neighbours. The new strategy should further include development of more linkages between agriculture and industry. It also needs to respond to people's basic needs and small-scale industries must be developed further. Only thus can industrialization contribute to economic welfare and sustainable development in Uganda. Privatization also needs to be reconsidered. It has contributed to the country's record rate of economic growth of 7 - 8 per cent, but so far it has not increased employment opportunities at all significantly. Nor has it enlarged the number of Ugandan entrepreneurs. Poverty, too, has not been reduced so far by privatization. There remams substantial room for development in most sectors of the Ugandan economy, creating opportunities for further and increased foreign investment. These sectors include food processmg and packing, construction equipment and electrical power systems, telecommunications equipment and services, travel and tourism services, light manufacturing, household consumer goods, footwear, furniture and textile fabrics, mining, mining industry equipment, non-ferrous metals, marine fisheries products and agriculture, including traditional crops such as coffee, cotton, tea and tobacco, fruit and vegetable processing, edible oil production, staple food crops processing, flowers and livestock. The vehicles for the facilitation of foreign investment are in place, the investment climate is open and friendly towards foreign investors, with an established investment code and incentive regime, offering generous capital recovery terms, particularly for investors whose projects entail significant investment in plant and machinery and whose investments are medium to long term. Uganda offers a predictable environment having achieved macro-economic stability at a time when clouds of uncertainty rock many regions in the world...|$|E

40|$|In Lipchin, C.; Sandler, D.; Cushman, E. (Eds.). The Jordan River and Dead Sea Basin: {{cooperation}} amid conflict. Dordrecht, Netherlands: SpringerNATO Science for Peace and Security Series - C: Environmental SecurityAfrica is {{a continent}} of extreme water resource environments with arguably the greatest {{spatial and temporal}} natural water supply variability in the world. Africa is also a land of transboundary waters. With the exception of island states, every African country has territory {{in at least one}} transboundary river basin. These basins cover 62 % of Africa's total land area, and virtually every one greater than 50, 000 km 2 crosses at least one national boundary. The management of these transboundary waters in conditions of such variability has been made even more complex by the unique political and economic history of the continent, in particular as related to the involvement of outside actors. In {{the first half of the}} 20 th century this involvement was related to colonialism. From the second half to the present, it has involved bi-lateral <b>and</b> international <b>donors,</b> <b>lenders</b> <b>and</b> international NGOs. In this paper, we examine the impacts of this influence by first reviewing the development of transboundary water law in Africa. We then examine how the global norms now mentioned in African law, in particular equity in water allocation, have actually influenced agreement content. Finally, we examine the extent to which influences wielded by international actors are a logical response to conditions in Africa's international basins. The results highlight the tangible influences of international actors on the orientation and content of basin level agreements and suggest the use of greater discretion in the application of international paradigms to water management agreements in extreme environments...|$|R
