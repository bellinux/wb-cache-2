Hydrometallurgical technique is fast emerging as preferred process for the recovery of a variety of metals due to its lower energy consume and lower smelter emissions than conventional pyrometallurgical processes. In this work, a hydrometallurgical process for the recovery of gold and silver from <b>electronic</b> <b>scraps</b> was studied. In place of cyanide, thiosulfate was chosen as complexing agent for gold. Thiosulfate leaching can be considered a non-toxic process and the gold dissolution rates can be faster than conventional cyanidation. The <b>electronic</b> <b>scraps,</b> obtained from “end of life” mobile phones, were crushed and pre-treated with nitric acid before the leaching. Different parameters were studied: concentration of thiosulfate, temperature and reaction time. Moreover, the use of ultrasound to assist the hydrometallurgical gold extraction was investigated, as its application in ores leaching shows a greater metals release in shorter time and the advantage of working at lower concentration of reagents and at lower temperature. In this work, the use of ultrasound allowed a higher recovery of the precious metals than conventional leaching in all the conditions studied (different concentrations of reagents, temperature and reaction time).

Two adsorption steps were also carried out to recover nickel and tin. The goal of the present study is to assess the environmental impacts associated with the designed hydrometallurgical treatment of the small WEEE through Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) methodology. The approach considered is cradle-to-gate, i. e., from the collected WEEE entering the collection centre to the secondary metals obtained from the hydrometallurgical treatment. Results obtained by SimaPro software and CML-IA method show that the nitric acid leaching contributes mostly to the impacts of the hydrometallurgical process (from 40 % to 80 %), followed by the adsorption steps.

40|$|The {{application}} of hyperspectral sensors {{in the development}} of machine vision solutions has become increasingly popular as the spectral characteristics of the imaged materials are better modeled in the hyperspectral domain than in the standard trichromatic red, green, blue data. While {{there is no doubt that}} the availability of detailed spectral information is opportune as it opens the possibility to construct robust image descriptors, it also raises a substantial challenge when this high-dimensional data is used {{in the development of}} real-time machine vision systems. To alleviate the computational demand, often decorrelation techniques are commonly applied prior to feature extraction. While this approach has reduced to some extent the size of the spectral descriptor, data decorrelation alone proved insufficient in attaining real-time classification. This fact is particularly apparent when pixel-wise image descriptors are not sufficiently robust to model the spectral characteristics of the imaged materials, a case when the spatial information (or textural properties) also has to be included in the classification process. The integration of spectral and spatial information entails a substantial computational cost, and as a result the prospects of real-time operation for the developed machine vision system are compromised.

40|$|Due {{to rapid}} {{industrialization}} {{the demand for}} heavy metals is ever increasing, but the reserves of high-grade ores are diminishing. Therefore {{there is a need}} to explore alternative sources of heavy metals. The rapid industrialization generates a variety of industrial wastes. These industrial wastes possess toxic elements such as heavy metals. Improper disposal of these wastes becomes a key factor in metal contamination and thus when leached into atmosphere cause serious environmental problem. These metals exert wide variety of adverse effects on human being. Some of the metals have extremely long biological half-life that essentially makes it a cumulative toxin. Also some metals are carcinogenic in nature. Among the wastes, <b>electronic</b> <b>scraps,</b> medical waste, metal finishing industry waste, spent petroleum catalysts, battery wastes, fly ash etc., are some of the major industrially produced wastes. These solid wastes mostly contain Au, Ag, Ni, Mo, Co, Cu, Zn, and Cr like heavy metals in it. Hence these waste materials which are causing serious environmental problems, can act as potential source for heavy metals. In this sense these industrial wastes can act as artifitial ores. The valuable metals can be recovered from these industrial wastes. There are varieties of methods in use for recovery of heavy metals. These include pyrometallurgical, hydrometallurgical and bio-hydrometallurgical methods. Pyrometallurgical recovery consists of the thermal treatment of ores and metal containing wastes to bring about physical and chemical transformations. This enables recovery of valuable metals. Calcining, roasting, smelting and refining are the pyrometallurgical processes used for metal recovery. The hydrometallurgical recovery uses mainly the leaching process. It involves the use of aqueous solutions containing a lixiviant which is brought into contact with a material containing a valuable metal. Further the metals are concentrated and purified by using precipitation, cementation, solvent extraction and ion exchange. The metals are finally recovered in pure form by using electrolysis and precipitation methods. Biohydrometallurgy is one of the most promising and revolutionary biotechnologies. This technique exploits microbiological processes for recovery of heavy metal ions. In last few decades the concept of microbiological leaching have played a grate role to recover valuable metals from various sulfide minerals or low grade ores. Now the microbiological leaching process has been shifted for its application to recover valuable metals from the different industrial wastes. There are many microrganisms which play important role in recovery of heavy metals from industrial wastes. Among the bacteria Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans, Acidithiobacillus thiooxidans, Leptospirillum ferrooxidans, and Sulfolobus sp., are well known for the bioleaching activity while Penicillium, and Aspergillus niger are some fungi those help in metal leaching process. The process of recovery makes sense only if the cost of recovery is much less than the value of the precious metal. The restrictions imposed on waste disposal and stringent environmental regulations demand eco-friendly technologies for metal recovery. This paper reports a review of number of industrial processes that generate metal containing waste and the various methods in use for recovery of metals from these wastes. This will help in selection of a proper method for recovery of heavy metals from industrial wastes...|$|R

Since these recycled ICs have been used in the field before, the performance of such ICs has been degraded by aging effects and harsh recycling process. In this thesis, to address the above two problems, we developed several light-weight on-chip structures and techniques to improve the security and reliability of ICs. These structures and techniques include (i) a verification-based flow to detect hardware Trojans in IPs, (ii) an on-chip ring oscillator network (RON) acting as power monitors to detect hardware Trojans in ICs, (iii) a novel technique combining the improved RON with transient current to improve the sensitivity of the RON for hardware Trojan detection, (iv) three light-weight sensors recording the usage time to identify recycled ICs, (v) a path- delay fingerprinting flow with zero area overhead to identify recycled ICs, and (vi) two true random number generators (TRNGs) to generate sequences with high randomness, which are widely used for secure data communication and storage. The simulation results and implementation analysis demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed techniques...|$|R

Chemical process involves leaching of gold/silver from <b>electronic</b> <b>scrap</b> using cyanide. The leachate containing gold/silver complex thus obtained is then subjected to biosorption process using low-cost biomass. The model proposed by us will help to strengthen the ‘processing’ part of the functional elements employed for proficient e-waste management. Feasibility study was also conducted to explore the possibility of removal/recovery of silver-cyanide using low-cost biosorbents. Results showed that Eicchornia root biomass and Waste tea powder were efficient biosorbents for leached silver-cyanide from <b>electronic</b> <b>scrap.</b> The concentrated silver-cyanide recovered could further be used as an input material for electroplating industry...|$|E
