25|$|A serious <b>design</b> <b>fault</b> {{in these}} {{locomotives}} was their very high unsprung weight of 33 tons.

Complaints from local residents started immediately after the service commenced and were such that the Board of Trade imposed a speed limit until modifications could be made. This was achieved by only using series mode on the controller, but by 1901, three of the locomotives had been rebuilt with new bogies and nose-suspended GE55 motors, reducing the unsprung weight to 11 tons.|$|E

40|$|A Markov model {{taking into}} account {{physical}} and <b>design</b> <b>faults</b> for a two-version architecture oriented to safety-related applications is developed. Only a probabilistic knowledge of the initial state of the versions {{in relation to the}} presence of <b>design</b> <b>faults</b> is assumed. The model can be split into two submodels accounting separately for physical and <b>design</b> <b>faults,</b> and a closed form expression for the unsafety of the system is obtained. The parameter estimation problem is discussed and a method to predict the probability distribution of the number of related <b>design</b> <b>faults</b> {{at the beginning of the}} operational life of the system is proposed. The method uses a pool model to process fault-occurrence data collected during a “face-to-face” debugging of the two versions. It has by nature a limited capability for proving version diversity, but it is shown that the limit is of the order of the diversity reported by recent experiments on real software. Finally, the impact of version correction during operation is shown to be negligible for critical applications. Postprint (author’s final draft...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a safety case {{approach to the}} justification of safety-related systems. It combines methods used for handling software <b>design</b> <b>faults</b> with approaches used for hazardous plant. The general structure of the safety argument is presented together with the underlying models for system failure {{that can be used}} as the basis for quantified reliability estimates. The approach is illustrated using plant and computer based examples. Introduction The SHIP project was sponsored under the EU Environment Programme (Major Industrial Hazards). The objective of the project was to assure plant safety in the presence of <b>design</b> <b>faults</b> but it was tackled from a novel standpoint.

2500|$|Wind engines had the {{inherent}} <b>design</b> <b>fault</b> {{that they would}} only work when the wind blew, and could therefore be unusable when they were most needed. The Commissioners therefore {{turned their attention to}} mechanising the pumping mills, and employed Mr. W. C. Mylne to advise them on the relative benefits of steam and gas engines in 1829. His report recommended the use of steam engines, and so a [...] engine was ordered from Boulton Watt and Co., which would drive two scoop wheels. The engine cost £1,184, and the engine house another £835. It was installed where the Whitehouse Drain met the River Little Ouse (otherwise known as Brandon Creek), and was commissioned in 1832, when it became known as the Brandon Engine. There were initial teething problems, which resulted in one of the scoop wheels being removed, repairs to the boiler, and a second boiler being installed, but once these problems had been sorted out, it became obvious that the new system was an efficient way to drain the Fens.|$|E
2500|$|The {{original}} satellites, XM-1 ("Rock") and XM-2 ("Roll") {{suffered from}} a generic <b>design</b> <b>fault</b> on the Boeing 702 series of satellites (fogging of the solar panels), which means that their lifetimes were shortened to approximately six years instead of the design goal of 15 years. To compensate for this flaw, XM-3 ("Rhythm") was launched ahead of its planned schedule on February 28, 2005 and moved into XM-1's previous location of 85° WL. XM-1 was then moved to be co-located with XM-2 at 115° WL, where each satellite operated only one transponder (thus broadcasting half the bandwidth each) to conserve energy and cut the power consumption in half while XM-4 ("Blues") was readied for launch. Subsequently, XM launched ground-spare XM-4 ("Blues") ahead of schedule on October 30, 2006 into the 115° WL location to complete the satellite replacement program. On December 15, 2006 XM-1 was then powered down and drifted back to its original location at 85° WL, where it will remain as a backup to XM-3. XM-2 as well was powered down and remains as a backup to XM-4. This makes the current active satellites as XM-3 [...] "Rhythm" [...] and XM-4 [...] "Blues" [...] with two in-orbit spares.|$|E

40|$|This chapter surveys {{techniques}} for tolerating {{the effects of}} design defects in computer systems, paying special attention to software. <b>Design</b> <b>faults</b> are {{a major cause of}} failure in modern computer systems, and their relative importance is growing as {{techniques for}} tolerating physical faults gain wider acceptance. Although <b>design</b> <b>faults</b> could in principle be eliminated, in practice they are inevitable in many categories of systems, and designers need to apply fault tolerance for mitigating their effects. Limited degrees of fault tolerance in software – “defensive programming ” – are common, but systematic application of <b>fault</b> tolerance for <b>design</b> <b>faults</b> is still rare and mostly limited to highly critical systems. However, the increasing dependence of system designers on off-the-shelf components often makes fault tolerance a necessary, feasible and probably cost-effective solution for achieving modest dependability improvements at affordable cost. This chapter introduces techniques and principles, outlines similarities and differences with fault tolerance against physical faults, provides a structured description of the space of design solutions, and discusses some design issues and trade-offs. 1...|$|R
40|$|Programmable {{computers}} make {{it possible}} to construct systems whose behavior is unimaginably complex. These systems are built because their complexity is believed to confer operational benefits, but this same complexity can harbor unexpected and catastrophic failure modes. The source of these failures can often be traced to software faults—for example, a software bug in the control system of the Therac- 25 radiation therapy machine was {{responsible for the death of}} three patients and serious injury to several others [Jac 89]. Software doesn’t wear out: all software-induced failures are due to <b>design</b> <b>faults,</b> and <b>design</b> <b>faults</b> are largely attributable to the complexity of the designs concerned—complexity that exceeds the intellectual grasp of its own creators. The only way to reduce or eliminate software <b>design</b> <b>faults</b> is to bring the complexity of the software into line with our ability to master that complexity. This might mean choosing not to build certain types of system (such as flight-critical computer control systems for passenger aircraft), and it should mean enhancing the intellectual tools available to software designers...|$|R

40|$|AbstractBackground and purposePoor device {{design that}} fails to {{adequately}} account for user needs, cognition, and behavior is often responsible for use errors resulting in adverse events. This poor device design is also often latent, and could be responsible for “No Fault Found” (NFF) reporting, in which medical devices sent for repair by clinical users {{are found to be}} operating as intended. Unresolved NFF reports may contribute to incident under reporting, clinical user frustration, and biomedical engineering technologist inefficacy. This study uses human factors engineering methods to investigate the relationship between NFF reporting frequency and device usability. Material and methodsAn analysis of medical equipment maintenance data was conducted to identify devices with a high NFF reporting frequency. Subsequently, semi-structured interviews and heuristic evaluations were performed in order to identify potential usability issues. Finally, usability testing was conducted in order to validate that latent usability related <b>design</b> <b>faults</b> result in a higher frequency of NFF reporting. ResultsThe analysis of medical equipment maintenance data identified six devices with a high NFF reporting frequency. Semi-structured interviews, heuristic evaluations and usability testing revealed that usability issues caused {{a significant portion of the}} NFF reports. Other factors suspected to contribute to increased NFF reporting include accessory issues, intermittent faults and environmental issues. Usability testing conducted on three of the devices revealed 23 latent usability related <b>design</b> <b>faults.</b> ConclusionsThese findings demonstrate that latent usability related <b>design</b> <b>faults</b> manifest themselves as an increase in NFF reporting and that devices containing usability related <b>design</b> <b>faults</b> can be identified through an analysis of medical equipment maintenance data...|$|R
