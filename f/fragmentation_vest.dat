A bayonet (Bayonet System 2005 by Eickhorn Solingen) mounts {{to the front of}} the tactical vest. Optional equipment includes a CamelBak drinking system and the small pack system. The wide brimmed combat hat can be worn within the camp.|$|R
40|$|Current theatres of {{military}} operations involve exposure to high ambient temperatures while wearing protective clothing such as <b>fragmentation</b> <b>vests</b> and/or {{the use of}} biological and chemical ensembles. Under conditions of uncompensable heat stress, aerobic fitness is {{a critical factor in}} explaining the higher core temperature (Tc) that can be tolerated by endurance trained (TR) versus untrained (UT) individuals. Tolerating higher Tc not only extends exposure time but it ensures that individuals can safely continue to be mobile while carrying their own weight and additional loads.

40|$|The recent Bo Xilai affair {{has created}} strains in the Chinese {{political}} system and has intensified the power struggle concerning the new leadership appointments due to {{take place at the}} 18 th Party Congress. The pressure on the political system is intensified by a number of social phenomena such as increased <b>fragmentation,</b> <b>vested</b> interests, corruption, social unrest, increased income and social inequalities and a de facto reform stop since 2009. Some scholars believe that we now see the end of ‘resilient authoritarianism’ and that China either will experience a political and social collapse or move towards a democratic system. However, developments since 1989 show the regime’s amazing ability to revitalize its organizational capabilities and regain its Mandate of Heaven. It may be too early to declare the Party over...|$|R
50|$|The New Zealand {{troops were}} poorly {{equipped}} and only issued with basic small arms and <b>fragmentation</b> <b>vests,</b> which given the threat level were totally inadequate for the task. Vehicle movement was by light skinned commercial vehicles {{and due to}} the risk of ambush and IEDs was limited, and often the situation deteriorated to a state where vehicle movement was stopped altogether, and helicopters had to be used to fly to United Nations locations around Mogadishu. Gunfire was constant, with Somali bandits climbing into the surrounding buildings and sporadically firing into the airfield and seaport, with random mortar fire also been a constant threat and annoyance. An increasing casualty list of UN personnel and relief workers, served as a continuing reminder of the hostility and dangers of serving in Somalia.|$|R
40|$|Background The core {{temperature}} of the soldier in a MOPP 1 configuration has a substantial impact on how long {{they can continue to}} work once they transition to MOPP 4. The higher their temperature at the start of this transition the shorter will be their work time in MOPP 4. New hot weather biological and chemical (BC) protective ensembles have been designed as stand-alone combat uniforms that are intended to replace the concept of an overgarment that is donned only as the threat level increases above MOPP 1. Given that soldiers are also expected to wear <b>fragmentation</b> and assault <b>vests,</b> the heat strain in MOPP 1 can be considerable during work in hot environments. The present study has examined whether vents in the leg and the arm of the BC uniform assist in reducing the heat strain of the soldier under varied wind conditions. Methods Eight males (33. 6 ± 7. 7 y, 86. 8 ± 10. 8 kg, 48. 9 ± 5. 3 ml/kg/min VO 2 max) completed up to 3 hours of treadmill walking at 4 km/h in 40 ºC and 30 % RH conditions while wearing a new hot weather BC stand-alone uniform, <b>fragmentation</b> and assault <b>vests,</b> and helmet, and carrying an artificial C 7 rifle. The total additional weight of the clothing and equipment was 20 kg. Zippered vents on the lateral aspect of the upper and lower leg and the medial aspect of the upper arm were either opened or closed in low (1 m/s) or high (3. 5 m/s) wind conditions.

40|$|Ballistic helmets are {{designed}} primarily {{to protect the}} head against high-speed impact from fragmentation munitions. The Australian Defence Forces (ADF) have recently introduced into service a composite ballistic helmet. This ballistic helmet is similar in shape to the US Army PASGT helmet on which it is based. When designing these ballistic helmets scant attention {{was given to the}} thermal loading on the wearer. Laboratory trials however, have shown that some soldiers have experienced "hotspots " {{on the front of the}} head when wearing the ADF ballistic helmet in hot environments. The ballistic helmet is an integral component of the personal armour system and must be worn when wearing a <b>fragmentation</b> or ballistic <b>vest</b> regardless of the environmental conditions. In order to reduce the thermal loading, venting of the helmet was proposed. This report examines airflows under a ballistic helmet and the effect of venting on thermal and vapour resistances using a sweating hotplate. From this work venting does not appear to provide an adequate solution to reducing the thermal load imposed by a ballistic helmet. Approved for public release fDEPARTMENT OF DEFENCE] IlCX...|$|R
