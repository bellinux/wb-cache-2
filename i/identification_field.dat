25|$|The {{header section}} {{contains}} the following fields: Identification, Flags, Number of questions, Number of answers, Number of authority resource records (RRs), and Number of additional RRs. The <b>identification</b> <b>field</b> {{can be used}} to match responses with queries. The flag field consists of several sub-fields. The first is a single bit which indicates if the message is a query (0) or a reply (1). The second sub-field consists of four bits; if the value is 1, the present packet is a reply; if it is 2, the present packet is a status; if the value is 0, the present packet is a request. A single-bit sub-field indicates if the DNS server is authoritative for the queried hostname. Another single-bit sub-field indicates if the client wants to send a recursive query ("RD"). The next single-bit sub-field indicates if the replying DNS server supports recursion ("RA"), since not all DNS servers are configured to do this task. Another sub-field indicates if the request was truncated for some reason ("TC"), and a four-bit sub-field indicates status. The question section contains the domain name and type of record (A, AAAA, MX, TXT, etc.) being resolved. The domain name is broken into discrete labels which are concatenated; each label is prefixed by the length of that label. The answer section has the resource records of the queried name. A domain name may occur in multiple records if it has multiple IP addresses associated.|$|E

40|$|Scat {{surveys are}} {{commonly}} used to monitor carnivore populations. Scats of sympatric carnivores {{can be difficult to}} differentiate and field-based identification can be misleading. We evaluated the success of field-based species identification for scats of 2 sympatric carnivores‚Äîcoyotes (Canis latrans) and kit foxes (Vulpes macrotis). We conducted scat surveys in the Great Basin desert of Utah, USA, during the winter and summer of 2013, and we detected 1, 680 carnivore scats. We classified scats based on <b>field</b> <b>identification,</b> recorded morphometricmeasurements, and collected fecalDNA samples for molecular species identification. We subsequently evaluated the classification success of <b>field</b> <b>identification</b> and the predictive power of 2 nonparametric classification techniques‚Äîk-nearest neighbors and classification trees‚Äîbased on scat measurements. Overall, 12. 2 % of scats were misclassified by <b>field</b> <b>identification,</b> but misclassifications were not equitable between species. Only 7. 1 % of the scats identified as coyote with <b>field</b> <b>identification</b> were misclassified, compared with 22. 9 % of scats identified as kit fox. Results from both k-nearest neighbor and classification-tree analyses suggest that morphometric measurements provided an objective alternative to <b>field</b> <b>identification</b> that improved classification of rarer species. Overall misclassification rates for k-nearest neighbor and classification-tree analyses were 11. 7 % and 7. 5 %, respectively. Using classification trees, misclassification was reduced for kit foxes (8. 5 %) and remained similar for coyotes (7. 2 %), relative to <b>field</b> <b>identification.</b> Although molecular techniques provide unambiguous species identification, classification approaches may offer a cost-effective alternative. We recommend that monitoring programs employing scat surveys utilize molecular species identification to develop training data sets and evaluate the accuracy of field based and statistical classification approaches...|$|R
