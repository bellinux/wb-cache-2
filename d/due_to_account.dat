40|$|Down-looking MIMO array SAR can {{reconstruct}} 3 D {{images of}} the observed area in the inferior of the platform of the SAR and has wide application prospects. In this paper, a new strategy based on Bayesian compressive sensing theory is proposed for down-looking MIMO array SAR imaging, which transforms the cross-track imaging process of down-looking MIMO array SAR into the problem of sparse signal reconstruction from noisy measurements. <b>Due</b> <b>to</b> <b>account</b> for additive noise encountered in the measurement process, high quality image can be achieved.

40|$|Although studies {{into the}} {{relation}} between the effects of hypothetical stable TeV-scale black holes produced in particle colliders relative to those which may be produced in nature due to cosmic ray (CR) collisions have already been conducted in great detail [3] this short paper re-examines the relationship between the two. Herein the same figures of CR flux and the planned number of collisions over the lifetime of the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) are used to determine a comparison between the two, though different results are concluded <b>due</b> <b>to</b> <b>account</b> taken of the relative flux of sub-Keplerian phenomena produced at colliders (< 11. 186 km/s) to faster naturally occurring phenomena which would evade gravity capture.

30|$|Patient health records contain {{sensitive}} data {{and there are}} multiple points in any Fog platform {{where they can be}} compromised, such as by exploiting any system and application vulnerability, unauthorised data access while in storage or during transmission, malicious insiders threat and while sharing data with other systems [61]. Medical sensors are continuously transmitting data to Fog platforms, through either wired or wireless connection. It is quite possible to compromise patient privacy, data integrity and system availability by exploiting sensors and their underlying communication network. Wireless sensors usually work in open, unattended and hostile environments. This ease-of-access has the potential to increase the chances of attacks like DoS, report disruption, and selective forwarding attacks [62]. In addition, if the Fog node manages {{sensitive data}} and lacks access control mechanisms, it might leak the data <b>due</b> <b>to</b> <b>account</b> hijacking, unintended access, and other vulnerable points of entry. To avoid such issues, strict policies should be enforced to maintain a high-level of control using multi-factor or mutual authentication, private networks and partial (selective) encryption.|$|E

The financial-statement-information anomaly appears <b>due</b> <b>to</b> <b>accounting</b> ratios proxying for stocks’ expected returns. Anomaly seems {{likely to be a}} permanent state. 1...|$|R
