Sodium caseinate, vegetable oil, glucose, mannitol and fructooligosaccharides were used as protectant of L. acidophilus and L. cremoris during freeze drying or spray drying and during subsequent storage. NaOH, LiCl and silica gel were used as desiccants during 10 weeks of storage of microencapsulated L. acidophilus and L. cremoris kept in an aluminum <b>foil</b> <b>pouch.</b> The results showed that mainly freeze dried L. acidophilus and L. cremoris kept in <b>foil</b> <b>pouch</b> containing NaOH (a w 0. 07) or LiCl (a w 0. 1) showed higher survival (89 - 94 %) than spray dried bacteria kept under the same conditions (86 - 90 %) after 10 weeks of storage (P= 0. 0005). Similar results were also showed by acid tolerance, bile tolerance and surface hydrophobicity of freeze-dried or spray-dried L. acidophilus and L. cremoris. Silica gel was less effective in protecting the functional properties of microencapsulated L. acidophilus or L. cremoris with percentage of survival between 81 and 87 % at week 10 of the storage. However, retention of β-galactosidase was only influenced by a w adjusted by desiccators (P< 0. 05). Based on forecasting using linear regression, the predicted storage period for freeze dried L. acidophilus, spray dried L. acidophilus and freeze dried L. cremoris kept in <b>foil</b> <b>pouch</b> containing NaOH would be 46, 42 and 42 weeks, respectively; while spray dried L. cremoris under LiCl desiccant would require 39 weeks to achieve minimum required bacterial population of 10 7 CFU/g. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E

Protective mechanism of casein-based microcapsule containing mannitol on L. acidophilus and L. lactis ssp. cremoris and glass transition of the microcapsules were studied after spray- or freeze-drying and after 10 week of storage in aluminum <b>foil</b> <b>pouch</b> containing different desiccants (NaOH, LiCl or silica gel) at 25 °C. An in situ FTIR analysis was carried out to recognize any changes in fatty acids of bacterial cell envelopes; interaction between polar site of cell envelopes and microcapsules, as well as alteration of their secondary protein structures, whereas DSC was used to determine glass transition (Tg) of microcapsules. Hierarchical cluster analysis based on functional groups of phospholipid bilayers of cell envelopes and secondary protein structures was also carried out to classify the microencapsulated bacteria. The results showed that drying process did not affect fatty acids and secondary protein structures of bacteria, however, those structures were affected during storage depending upon the type of desiccant. Interaction between bacterial cell envelopes and microencapsulant occurred after drying as shown by alteration of wavelength of P = O symmetric of cell envelopes from 1075 cm− 1 to 1047 and 1048 cm− 1 (fresh L. acidophilus, freeze-dried and spray dried cells, respectively). Similar phenomenon was demonstrated by L. cremoris. However, these structures were maintained after storage in <b>foil</b> <b>pouch</b> containing NaOH. Method of drying and type of desiccants influenced the level of similarities of microencapsulated bacteria. Desiccants and method of drying affected glass transition; yet no Tg ≤ 25 °C was detected. This study demonstrated that the changes in fatty acids and secondary structures of the microencapsulated bacteria still occurred during storage at Tg above the room temperature indicating that glass state did not completely prevent chemical activities. link_to_OA_fulltex...|$|E
40|$|Introduction: The {{transplantation}} of abdominal organs is a life-saving therapeutic intervention. Both procurement and transplantation of {{the organs}} {{must meet the}} highest quality standards. Although the overall process is clearly defined by Eurotransplant, few scientific data are available concerning the effectiveness of organ transport systems (OTS), in which organs should be rapidly cooled to 4 °C and held in that range for extended periods. Since there were no validated preliminary investigations of the thermal behaviour of human organs in organ transport systems should be as practical as possible {{a review of the}} OTS used for over 25 years in the Eurotransplant area and identify possible alternatives to this work. Materials and Methods: Using 22 porcine livers and 34 porcine kidneys, temperatures were measured over time inside the inner <b>foil</b> <b>pouch</b> of currently used organ transport systems (OTS 1). These systems, consisting of a styrofoam box, two foil pouches filled with NaCl solution at 4 °C and a third, outer pouch that is surrounded by crushed ice, were compared to alternative systems (OTS 2 and OTS 3) in which a plastic bowl prevents direct contact with ice. In another series, renal parenchymal temperatures were measured for comparison with temperatures inside the inner pouch in the OTS 1. We also measured the surface temperatures of human organs immediately after explantation and immediately after arrival at a transplant centre. Measurements were taken with KSW® RFID loggers and testo® 454 loggers. Results: Immediately prior to packing, mean liver surface temperature was 16. 2 °C and that of kidneys was 21. 4 °C. After 30 minutes the temperature inside OTS 1 (for livers and kidneys) had reached 6 °C, after 5 hours temperatures in both systems were between 0 and 1 °C. Occasionally temperatures as low as 0. 3 °C were record-ed, although these are not significant due to the physical characteristics/qualities of isotonic NaCl solutions. Control measurements in the renal parenchyma confirmed the temperature course in OTS 1, with all temperatures above 0 °C. Filling the second <b>foil</b> <b>pouch</b> to a volume of 2 litress reduced the time required to cool to 4 °C by 60 minutes. In the new OTS 2, the length of time to reach 6 °C was significantly longer at 3 hours, and in OTS 3 a temperature of 8 °C was reached only after 8 hours. Both OTS 1 and OTS 2 kept the contents in the target range of > 0 to 6 °C for 24 hours. Conclusion: The standard system OTS 1 that comes in the Eurotransplant area used for over 25 years, showed the fastest cooling to the target range of > 0 °C to 6 ° C, and was able to keep this over 24 hours. Subject to a mandatory packing instruction it is a safe organ transport system and is recommended for clinical use...|$|E

For orthopaedic use, it is of vital importance that the attributes of these CPC 2 ̆ 7 s are not compromised by irradiation sterilization. Therefore, the aim of this study is to determine the influence of irradiation sterilization on a range of premixed CPC 2 ̆ 7 s, with an emphasis on improving product shelf life through the use of optimal packaging configurations and annealing steps. Electron spin resonance (ESR) confirmed the presence of free radicals in the inorganic phase of the CPC paste following irradiation. The inclusion of a 24 -h annealing step was the only successful method in reducing the degree of free radical formation. Based on the results of injectability force testing, it was revealed that an annealing step greater than 24 -h significantly altered the viscosity, however; at 24 -h the key attributes of the CPC paste were minimally effected.

Vaginally disintegrating tablets were prepared by lyophilizing the formulated bacteria in tablet-shaped molds, then packaging in <b>foil</b> <b>pouches</b> with desiccant. Disintegration time, potency and stability of the tablets were assessed. For colonization, non-synchronized macaques were dosed vaginally with either one tablet or five tablets delivered over five days. Vaginal samples were obtained at three, 14, and 21 days post-dosing and cultured to determine Lactobacillus colonization levels. To confirm identity of the MucoCept Lactobacillus strain, genomic DNA was extracted from samples on days 14 and 21 and a strain-specific PCR was performed. Supernatants from bacteria were tested for the presence of the mCV-N protein by Western blot. The tablets were easy to handle, disintegrated within two minutes, potent (5. 7 x 1011 CFU/g), and stable at 4 °C and 25 °C.

Sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of the myofibrillar extracts showed that both fish species may be distinguished from each other by protein bands with molecular weights estimated to be 18, 400 and 14, 300 daltons. Rheological methods, differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), phase contrast microscopy and FT-Raman spectroscopy indicated a positive synergistic interaction between flying gurnard proteins and cowpea flour resulting in greater than expected elastic modulus values. The networks were compatible and stabilized by hydrophobic and hydrogen bonds as well as disulfide bonds. Optimum gels were formed with flying gurnard fish and cowpea flour mixed in the ratio of 5 : 5 (w/w) and Burrito fish mince to cowpea flour ratio (2 : 8 w/w). Interactions of the fish minces with cassava starch resulted in phase separation and weak non-covalent interactions. Infant weaning food formulations including flying gurnard mince and other food ingredients showed good nutritional and low viscous properties which compared favourably with commercial infant foods. The shelf life of the products was enhanced with the exclusion of oxygen in vacuum-packed foil packaging. High bloom (275 g) gelatin was produced from flying gurnard fish skin and compared favourably with gelatins from other sources.
