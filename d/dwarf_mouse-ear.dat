These support species, four of which are considered nationally rare while seven of the plant species present are considered notable. Plants of interest include the nationally rare Cheddar pink (Dianthus gratianopolitanus), bedstraw (Galium fleurotii), dwarf sedge (Carex humilis) and <b>dwarf</b> <b>mouse-ear</b> (Cerastium pumilum). Rose Wood and King's Wood are ancient woodland sites. King's Wood has coppiced hazel and nationally important small leaved lime. The nationally rare purple gromwell (Lithospermum purpurocaeruleum) occurs at Rose Wood.|$|E
50|$|Cerastium pumilum, the <b>dwarf</b> <b>mouse-ear</b> or European chickweed, is {{an annual}} or {{biannual}} herbaceous plant, between 2 and 20 cm. high, native to Central and western Europe. The petals {{of the white}} flowers are shorter or equally long as the sepals, and split in the middle, up to {{a quarter of the}} length. The fruit petioles stand diagonal to the stems, often bent over at their top. Flowering occurs between March and May. Rarely occurs on the seacoast.|$|E
5|$|This former quarry has undulating {{calcareous}} grassland which is grazed by rabbits and cattle. It has a rich variety of flora, including sheep's fescue, <b>dwarf</b> thistle, <b>mouse-ear</b> hawkweed, wild thyme and common rock-rose. There are many bryophytes and lichens.|$|R
50|$|On anthills, and in {{the more}} {{disturbed}} turf that is especially {{a feature of the}} impact area, mouse-ear hawkweed (Hieracium pilosella) is abundant together with sheep's fescue (Festuca ovina) and wild thyme. Annuals are also characteristic of this habitat, including common whitlowgrass (Erophila verna), rue-leaved saxifrage (Saxifraga tridactylites,) hairy rock-cress (Arabis hirsuta) and the nationally scarce <b>dwarf</b> <b>mouse-ear</b> (Cerastium pumilum) and fine-leaved sandwort (Minuartia hybrida). A very local community characterised by a lichen-rich turf (Cladonia species) and the broom moss (Dicranum scoparium) is found in some stabilised missile-impaction craters on the central ranges. This vegetation type is found elsewhere only on Porton Down SSSI and on the Brecklands.|$|E
50|$|The flora include chalk grassland-loving {{species such}} as {{marjoram}} and wild thyme. The Cheddar pink, Dianthus gratianopolitanus, also known as firewitch, only grows in the wild in the gorge. It was once common in the gorge but declined after being picked by collectors. It {{is also home to}} unique species of whitebeam.The nationally rare little robin geranium (Geranium purpureum), and Cheddar bedstraw (Galium fleurotii) and the nationally scarce species include slender tare (Vicia tenuissima), <b>dwarf</b> <b>mouse-ear</b> (Cerastium pumilum) and rock stonecrop (Sedum forsteranum) also occur in the gorge.

50|$|This {{ecology of}} the site is varied. There are ancient and {{secondary}} semi-natural broadleaved woodland, however the majority is unimproved calcareous grassland with calcareous grassland and acidic dry dwarf-shrub heath. Four of the calcareousgrassland communities {{and two of the}} woodland types have a restricted distribution in Britain, as does the calcareous grassland/acidic dry dwarf-shrub heath.

50|$|This is {{a nationally}} {{important}} botanical site, for both vascular and non-vascular plants, {{situated on the}} southern escarpment of the Mendip Hills. It also contains a roosting site for two nationally rare species of bat and {{a wide range of}} butterfly species. The very thin soils here support populations of one nationally rare species, Cheddar bedstraw (Galium fleurotii) and four nationally scarce species, pale St John's wort (Hypericum montanum), sea storksbill (Erodium maritimum), <b>dwarf</b> <b>mouse-ear</b> (Cerastium pumilum) and spring cinquefoil (Potentilla tabernaemontani). There is a roosting site for greater horseshoe bat (Rhinolophus ferrumequinum) and lesser horseshoe bat R. hipposideros, both of which are nationally rare. Dormice (Muscardinus avellanarius) are found in the woodland. Twenty-five species of butterfly have been recorded and these include: brown argus (Aricia agestis), green hairstreak (Callophrys rubi), dark green fritillary (Argynnis aglaja) and marbled white (Melanargia galathea).|$|E
