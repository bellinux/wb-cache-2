Since they are unknown to the public and patches are not available, hackers can use them to attack effectively. Detecting software vulnerabilities and making patches could protect hosts from attacks that use these vulnerabilities. But this method cannot prevent all vulnerabilities. Some methods such as address space randomization could defend against vulnerabilities, but they cannot find them in software to help software vendors to generate patches for other hosts. In this paper, we design and develop a proof-of-concept prototype called AutoDunt (AUTOmatical <b>zero</b> <b>Day</b> <b>vUlNerability</b> deTector), which can detect vulnerable codes in software by analyzing attacks directly in virtual surroundings. It does not need any source codes or care about polymorphic/metamorphic shellcode (even no shellcode). We present a new kind of dependence between variables called latent dependence and use it to save necessary states for virtual surrounding replaying. In this way, AutoDunt does not need to use slicing or taint analysis method to find the vulnerable code in software, which saves managing time. We verify the effectiveness and evaluate the efficiency of AutoDunt by testing 81 real exploits and 7 popular applications at the end of this paper. © 2012 Springer-Verlag.

This makes sense {{as they are}} analyzing security data across a myriad of diverse heterogeneous sources, whereas this survey points out numerous times that Big Data challenges can be encountered at only single sources for Intrusion Detection.

We formally define the metric based on a model of relevant network components. We then devise algorithms for computing the metric.

5000|$|Targeted {{threats are}} {{a class of}} malware destined for one {{specific}} organization or industry. A type of crimeware, these threats are of particular concern because {{they are designed to}} capture sensitive information. Targeted attacks may include threats delivered via SMTP e-mail, port attacks, <b>zero</b> <b>day</b> attack <b>vulnerability</b> exploits or phishing messages. Government organisations are the most targeted sector.

30|$|Vulnerabilities {{have become}} {{the root cause of}} threats towards {{cyberspace}} security. Defined in RFC 2828 (Shirey 2000), a vulnerability is a flaw or weakness in a system’s design, implementation, or operation and management that could be exploited to violate the system’s security policy. Attack on <b>vulnerabilities,</b> especially on <b>zero</b> <b>day</b> <b>vulnerabilities,</b> can result in serious damages. The WannaCry ransomware attack (Wikipedia and Wannacry ransomware attack 2017) outbroke in May 2017, which exploits a vulnerability in Server Message Block (SMB) protocol, is reported to have infected more than 230, 000 computers in over 150 countries within one day. It has caused serious crisis management problems and huge losses to many industries, such as finance, energy and medical treatment.|$|R
40|$|Grids allow users {{flexible}} on-demand {{usage of}} computing resources through remote communication networks. A remarkable {{example of a}} Grid in High Energy Physics (HEP) research {{is used in the}} ALICE experiment at European Organization for Nuclear Research CERN. Physicists can submit jobs used to process the huge amount of particle collision data produced by the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). Grids face complex security challenges. They are interesting targets for attackers seeking for huge computational resources. Since users can execute arbitrary code in the worker nodes on the Grid sites, special care should be put in this environment. Automatic tools to harden and monitor this scenario are required. Currently, there is no integrated solution for such requirement. This paper describes a new security framework to allow execution of job payloads in a sandboxed context. It also allows process behavior monitoring to detect intrusions, even when new attack methods or <b>zero</b> <b>day</b> <b>vulnerabilities</b> are exploited, by a Machine Learning approach. We plan to implement the proposed framework as a software prototype that will be tested as a component of the ALICE Grid middleware. Comment: Journal of Physics: Conference Series, Volume 66...|$|R

40|$|Covert {{channels}} {{constitute an}} important security threat {{because they are}} used to ex-filtrate sensitive information, to disseminate malicious code, and, more alarmingly, to transfer instructions to a criminal (or terrorist). This work presents <b>zero</b> <b>day</b> <b>vulnerabilities</b> and weak-nesses, that we discovered, in the Short Message Service (SMS) protocol, that allow the embedding of high capacity covert channels. We show that an intruder, by exploiting these SMS vulnerabilities, can bypass the existing security infrastructure (including firewalls, intrusion detection systems, content filters) of a sensitive organization and the primitive content filtering software at an SMS Center (SMSC). We found that the SMS itself, along with its value added services (like picture SMS, ring tone SMS), appears to be much more susceptible to security vulnerabilities than other services in IP-based networks. To demonstrate the effectiveness of covert channels in SMS, we have used our tool GeheimSMS that practically embeds data bytes (not only secret, but also hidden) by composing the SMS in Protocol Description Unit (PDU) mode and transmitting it from a mobile device using a serial or Bluetooth link. The contents of the overt (benign) message are not corrupted; hence the secret communication remains unsuspicious during the transmission and reception of SMS. Our experiments on active cellular networks show that 1 KB of a secret message can be transmitted in less than 3 minutes by sending 26 SMS without raising an alarm over suspicious activity. status: publishe...|$|R

A signal in the skewness of the lower-level relative humidity distribution over the ensemble suggests that a dry lower troposphere can prevent development of a model cyclone.
