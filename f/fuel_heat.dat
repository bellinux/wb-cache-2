50|$|Some {{experts that}} work with boilers {{on a day-to-day basis}} feel that {{electric}} boilers are actually superior to <b>fuel</b> <b>heated</b> boilers in a few ways. Those experts say that using electric boilers may actually be cheaper than using a <b>fuel</b> <b>heated</b> boiler, while also possibly being much more environmentally friendly. The electric boilers also require less equipment to be installed than a traditional boiler helping to reduce the high installation costs that will come with a <b>fuel</b> <b>heated</b> boiler. Electric Boilers can fit into smaller areas due to the way they are constructed and the lack of required parts that a <b>fuel</b> <b>heated</b> boiler requires to operate.|$|R

50|$|The {{converter}} (also {{known as}} vaporiser or reducer) is a device designed {{to change the}} fuel from a pressurised liquid to a vapour at around atmospheric pressure for delivery to the mixer or vapour phase injectors. Because of the refrigerant characteristic of the <b>fuel,</b> <b>heat</b> must be put into the fuel by the converter. This is usually achieved by having engine coolant circulated through a heat exchanger that transfers heat from that coolant to the LPG.|$|E

40|$|A {{numerical}} {{study of}} soot formation and NO x emission in axisymmetric coflow laminar methane/hydrogen-air diffusion flame was conducted using detailed gas-phase chemistry and complex thermal and transport properties. To investigate {{the impact of}} hydrogen addition, three cases were studied, namely, Case 1, maintaining a constant volume flow of fuel. Case 2, maintaining the <b>fuel</b> <b>heat</b> release rate unchanged, and the fuel nozzle diameter unchanged. Case 3, maintain the <b>fuel</b> <b>heat</b> release rate unchanged, and the fuel jet velocity constant. The results show that, in all three cases, with increasing level of H 2 addition, the flame height decreased, the reaction zone length shortened, residence time shortened, therefore, soot surface growth was inhibited, soot formation reduced, and NO x emissions reduced. Effects of hydrogen addition on soot formation and NO x emissions in Case 2 and Case 3 were much worse than that in Case 1. The results also show that while in reducing soot formation and NO x emission, effect of hydrogen addition in Case 3 was better than that in Case 2. Peer reviewed: YesNRC publication: Ye...|$|E

40|$|An {{experimental}} {{jet fuel}} with a - 33 C freezing point was chilled in a wing tank simulator with superimposed <b>fuel</b> <b>heating</b> to improve low temperature flowability. Heating consisted of circulating {{a portion of}} the fuel to an external heat exchanger and returning the <b>heated</b> <b>fuel</b> to the tank. Flowability was determined by the mass percent of unpumpable fuel (holdup) left in the simulator upon withdrawal of fuel at the conclusion of testing. The study demonstrated that <b>fuel</b> <b>heating</b> is feasible and improves flowability as compared to that of baseline, unheated tests. Delayed heating with initiation when the fuel reaches a prescribed low temperature limit, showed promise of being more efficient than continuous heating. Regardless of the mode or rate of heating, complete flowability (zero holdup) could not be restored by <b>fuel</b> <b>heating.</b> The severe, extreme-day environment imposed by the test caused a very small amount of subfreezing fuel to be retained near the tank surfaces even at high rates of heating. Correlations of flowability established for unheated fuel tests also could be applied to the heated test results if based on boundary-layer temperature or a solid index (subfreezing point) characteristic of the fuel.
