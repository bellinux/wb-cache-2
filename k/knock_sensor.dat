25|$|Automotive engine {{management}} systems use piezoelectric transducers to detect Engine knock (<b>Knock</b> <b>Sensor,</b> KS), {{also known as}} detonation, at certain hertz frequencies. A piezoelectric transducer is also used in fuel injection systems to measure manifold absolute pressure (MAP sensor) to determine engine load, and ultimately the fuel injectors milliseconds of on time.|$|E
25|$|The first 4.0 {{engines in}} 1987 had a RENIX (Renault/Bendix) engine {{management}} system considered quite advanced for their time. A <b>knock</b> <b>sensor</b> allowed the ECU to control spark advance in response to fuel octane and engine load. Unfortunately, there are few scan tools capable of interfacing with the system to pull diagnostics codes. RENIX systems also have no permanent memory for diagnostics codes thus making the diagnosis of intermittent problems more difficult.|$|E
25|$|Modern EMSs read in {{data from}} various sensors about the {{crankshaft}} position, intake manifold temperature, {{intake manifold pressure}} (or intake air volume), throttle position, fuel mixture via the oxygen sensor, detonation via a <b>knock</b> <b>sensor,</b> and exhaust gas temperature sensors. The EMS then uses the collected data to precisely determine how much fuel to deliver and when and how far to advance the ignition timing. With electronic ignition systems, individual cylinders can have their own individual timing so that timing can be as aggressive as possible per cylinder without fuel detonation. As a result, sophisticated electronic ignition systems can be both more fuel efficient, and produce better performance over their counterparts.|$|E

50|$|Higher {{compression}} ratios will however make gasoline engines {{subject to}} engine knocking (also known as detonation) if lower octane-rated fuel is used. This can reduce efficiency or damage the engine if <b>knock</b> <b>sensors</b> are not present {{to modify the}} ignition timing. However, <b>knock</b> <b>sensors</b> have been a requirement of the OBD-II specification used in 1996 model year vehicles and newer.|$|R
50|$|Updated LH-Jetronic {{injection}} and ignition {{changed to}} EZK system, two <b>knock</b> <b>sensors</b> added to engine. Single disk clutch on manual transmission cars, larger torque converter on automatics.|$|R

The 2010 GT500's fuel efficiency increased by 2 miles per gallon.|$|E
2500|$|Starting in February 1983, the AMC [...] I4 {{theoretically}} {{replaced the}} GM Iron Duke 151 under Eagle hoods {{as the standard}} engine, though the installation rate is unknown. The [...] I6 was improved for better performance by increasing the compression ratio to 9.2 to 1 (from the previous 8.2 to 1), {{as well as a}} fuel feedback system, a <b>knock</b> <b>sensor,</b> and the CEC; thus allowing the continuing use of regular-grade fuel.|$|E

All Supras this year {{had the same}} amount of power (both automatics and 5-speeds). The engine received a redesigned throttle position sensor (TPS) as well as a new EGR system and <b>knock</b> <b>sensor.</b> With the slight increase in power the Supra was able to propel itself from 0–60mph in 8.4 seconds and netted a 16.1 second quarter-mile at [...]|$|E
50|$|Saab Full Pressure Turbo (FPT) {{models with}} this unit include the APC name {{displayed}} on a non-numeric boost pressure gauge in the instrument panel. Although <b>knock</b> <b>sensors</b> are common even on non-turbocharged and turbocharged engines today, Saab has continued to use the APC name prominently as a differentiating feature.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Knock</b> <b>sensors</b> {{have been}} {{eliminated}} by utilizing the [...] "ionic current" [...] measuring system. Using the ionic current system, engine misfires as well as knock can be measured simultaneously. The ionic current is measured by passing a low voltage across the spark plugs immediately following the ignition spark.|$|R

2500|$|In 1991, a Chrysler MPI fuel {{injection}} system replaced the RENIX system, and the intake ports were raised approximately [...] for a better entry radius. Chrysler also enlarged the throttle body and redesigned the intake and exhaust manifolds for more efficiency, and the fuel injectors were replaced with higher flow units. Camshaft timing was also changed. The net result was an engine that made [...] and [...] Badging on most Jeeps equipped with this engine read [...] "4.0 Litre HIGH OUTPUT." [...] The new cam profile combined with altered computer programming eliminated {{the need for an}} EGR valve and <b>knock</b> <b>sensor,</b> but made the engine more sensitive to alterations, especially where emissions are concerned. The OEM fuel injectors used with the Mopar MPI system (manufactured by Siemens) have been known to leak fuel especially with OBDII where plugged catalytic converters are common which usually throws a P0420 code.|$|E

50|$|An {{optional}} trip computer, the SCC, {{was introduced}} for the 1993 model year, and provided mileage, speed warning, and alarm functions. A new turbocharger management system, Trionic 5, was equipped from the 1993 model year onwards. The Trionic system used resistor spark plugs to detect for engine knock {{in place of}} the <b>knock</b> <b>sensors</b> incorporated into the engine block in the previous APC system.|$|R
5000|$|The 3MZ-FE is a 3.3 L (3310 cc) version. Bore is 92 mm {{and stroke}} is 83 mm. Output is [...] with 240 lbft Nm of torque in the Camry and [...] with 242 lbft Nm of torque in the Sienna and Highlander. It also {{features}} VVT-i, ETCS-i (Electronic Throttle Control System — intelligent/DBW), PA6 plastic intake, and increased throttle body diameter over the 1MZ. The 3MZ uses a new flat-type <b>knock</b> <b>sensor,</b> {{which is a}} departure from the typical resonator type <b>knock</b> <b>sensor</b> used on the previous MZs. Previous MZs had poor knock control, or perhaps oversensitivity when detecting knock, and power loss up to [...] may be realized due to erratic ignition timing when using an octane lower than 91. The new flat-type <b>knock</b> <b>sensor</b> is a completely different design and detects more frequencies than the traditional resonator type. This provides the ECU with more accurate data. A bolt goes {{through the center of the}} <b>knock</b> <b>sensor,</b> which then mates the sensor to the block on each bank.|$|E
50|$|Compared with ML1.3, {{this system}} adds <b>knock</b> <b>sensor</b> control, purge {{canister}} control and start-up diagnostics. Motronic 3.1 {{is used in}} non-VANOS BMW M50B25 engines.|$|E

50|$|It was {{introduced}} with {{the launch of}} the 850 Turbo (also called the 850 T-5 and 850 T-5 Turbo) in October 1993 for model year 1994. Features included OBD I diagnostics, dual <b>knock</b> <b>sensors</b> and a lot more. For the 1996 model year OBD II diagnostics were introduced on some cars while M4.3 was beginning to be phased out. The last M4.3 equipped cars were made for modelyear 1997.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{addresses}} the implementation and comparison of algorithms for real-time knock detection. Knock is an unwanted abnormal combustion process that may damage engines and limit their efficiency. For series vehicles, knock detection is generally obtained from <b>knock</b> <b>sensors</b> that capture other noise sources, thus requiring robust algorithms. In order {{to estimate the}} performance of time-frequency and Kalman filter based algorithms, a knock signal model is proposed and the algorithms are tested under various noise conditions. Experiments on modelled and real signals show {{the superiority of the}} recently developed S-method with respect to extended Kalman filtering...|$|R
50|$|The {{first of}} the main {{strategies}} used to achieve high output and low fuel consumption was to improve air intake efficiency by applying the MIVEC system (valve timing & lift switching-type), and also optimizing the intake/exhaust-ports in the cylinder head, and employing a variable intake manifold. The second strategy was to reduce mechanical friction by using an offset crankshaft and other technologies. The third strategy was to improve anti-knocking performance by more efficient cooling of the cylinder head/combustion chambers. The fourth strategy was to adopt twin <b>knock</b> <b>sensors</b> (for sensing & control in each bank) to optimize combustion.|$|R
5000|$|An {{option on}} the BF Falcon, its extra power {{comes from a}} slight {{increase}} in compression ratio. This is done safely with the addition of another <b>knock</b> <b>sensor.</b> It was in production since 2005.|$|E

50|$|AMC-Renault uses a fully {{integrated}} {{electronic engine control}} system made by RenixThe Renix electronic ignition system consists of a solid-state Ignition Control Module (ICM), a distributor, a crankshaft position sensor, and an Electronic Control Unit (ECU). The Renix ECU has a powerful microprocessor that was advanced technology for its time. It also incorporates an engine <b>knocking</b> <b>sensor</b> that allows the computer to know if detonation is occurring, thus allowing the computer to make adaptive control by individual cylinder corrections to prevent pinging. The knock detection uses the signal from a wide bank accelerometer mounted on the cylinder head. Good {{signal to noise ratio}} is obtained primarily through angular discrimination.|$|R
50|$|The ML 2.1 system {{integrates}} {{an advanced}} engine management with 2 <b>knock</b> <b>sensors</b> provision for adaptive fuel & timing adjustment, purge canister control, precision sequential fuel control & diagnostics (pre OBD-1). Fuel enrichment during cold-start {{is achieved by}} altering {{the timing of the}} main injectors based on engine temperature. The idle speed is also fully controlled by the digital Motronic unit, including fast-idle during warm-up. Updated variants ML 2.10.1 thru 2.5 add MAF Mass Air Flow sensor logic and direct fire ignition coils per cylinder. Motronic 2.1 is used in the Porsche 4 cyl 16V 944S/S2/968 and the 6 cyl Boxer Carrera 964 & 993, Opel/Vauxhall, FIAT & Alfa Romeo engines.|$|R
5000|$|A {{technique}} {{used to prevent}} the onset of knock is the high [...] "swirl" [...] engine that forces the intake charge to adopt a fast circular rotation in the cylinder during compression that provides quicker and more complete combustion. It is possible to manufacture gasoline engines with compression ratios of over 11:1 that can use 87 (MON + RON)/2 (octane rating) fuel {{with the addition of}} variable valve timing and <b>knock</b> <b>sensors</b> to delay ignition timing. Such engines may not produce their full rated power using 87 octane gasoline under all circumstances, due to the delayed ignition timing. Direct fuel injection, which can inject fuel only at the time of fuel ignition (similar to a diesel engine), is another recent development which also allows for higher compression ratios on gasoline engines.|$|R
50|$|Ignition {{takes place}} with {{individual}} ignition coils {{placed on the}} respective spark plug. The spark plugs, together with the ignition coils and combustion detection module (CDM), are used to detect combustion and possible knocking. This means {{there is no need}} for a camshaft position sensor or separate <b>knock</b> <b>sensor.</b>|$|E
50|$|The most {{typically}} used engine management systems found in automobiles today have a <b>knock</b> <b>sensor</b> that monitors if knock is being {{produced by the}} fuel being used. In modern computer-controlled engines, the ignition timing will be automatically altered by the engine management system to reduce the knock to an acceptable level.|$|E

5000|$|In 1996, the [...] S50B32 {{replaced}} the S50B30 (except in Canada and the United States, where the M52-based S52 engine was used instead). Engine management {{is provided by}} a Siemens MSS50 engine control unit featuring integrated Vanos control for both the intake and exhaust camshafts. The MSS50 ECU also encompassed an advanced knock control system which can monitor each of the s50b32 6 cylinders via 3 <b>knock</b> <b>sensors</b> allowing the engine run a more refined calibration on standard high octane pump gas. The oil sump is a smaller capacity unit first seen on the M3GT and features a dual pick-up system to {{lower the risk of}} oil being forced away from a single pick-up point under cornering. This engine produces [...] The compression ratio is 11.3:1, the bore is 86.4 mm and the stroke is 91 mm.|$|R
2500|$|Further {{detail of}} the engine {{includes}} fully sequential electronic multi-point fuel injection with intake manifold-sited fuel injectors, mapped direct ignition system with solid-state high voltage distribution using eight individual single-spark ignition coils and NGK longlife spark plugs, and three <b>knock</b> <b>sensors.</b> [...] Engine management uses a Bosch Motronic ME7.1.1 engine control unit, which controls all functions of the engine operation; including fuel delivery, ignition system, valve timing, emissions control systems, and torque reduction control—the latter operating {{in conjunction with the}} Bosch ESP5.7 Electronic Stability Programme, as part of the [...] "Anti Slip Regulation" [...] (ASR) traction control system. [...] The engine is compliant with the European Union Euro3 (EU3) standard, and includes two close-coupled primary catalytic converters (CATs), two underfloor main CATs, and four heated oxygen sensors which manage the cylinder bank selective lambda control. [...] This results in a CO2 emissions rating of 350g/km for the Avant and saloon in standard configuration.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: This article {{examines}} the use of instrumentation amplifiers (IAs) for sensor applications. It highlights system challenges and implementation choices, describes new architectures for integrated-circuit IAs, and outlines applications such as ratiometric bridges and low-side current sensing. A similar article appeared in February 28, 2008 edition of Electronic Design. Sensor measurements typically translate physical phenomena of interest into electronic-circuit parameters such as resistance and capacitance, which can then be read with a bridge circuit. Bridge circuits produce an output voltage or current signal that is ratiometric with respect to temperature and power-supply voltages, thereby enabling the measurement system to selfcompensate for these variables. Sensor examples include: Thermistors for temperature sensing Resistive/capacitive strain gauges for pressure sensing Magneto-resistive sensors for direction/position sensing Sensors that produce a signal voltage or current directly do not require a bridge circuit to transform the physical variables. Examples include thermocouples, ECG-based medical instrumentation, and voltage across the current-sense resistor in a powermonitoring circuit. Today's sensor applications range from consumer electronics (thermometers, pressure scales, GPS systems), to automotive equipment (fuel <b>sensors,</b> <b>knock</b> <b>sensors,</b> brake-line sensors, window pinch control), to industrial and medical instrumentation (valve-position sensing, temperature-based system calibration and alarm, and ECG). Their environments are rich in EMI noise, power-supply harmonics, ground-loop currents, and ESD spikes, while the signals of interest {{that are to be}} extracted are extremely small. Thus, the analog-sensor interface becomes nontrivial, and must maintain exacting specifications while rejecting environmental phenomena. For commercial success, it must also deliver low cost, small size, and (for batteryoperated meters) low supply current...|$|R
