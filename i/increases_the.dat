5|$|A key {{step in the}} {{majority}} of GWA studies is the imputation of genotypes at SNPs not on the genotype chip used in the study. This process greatly <b>increases</b> <b>the</b> number of SNPs that can be tested for association, <b>increases</b> <b>the</b> power of the study, and facilitates meta-analysis of GWAS across distinct cohorts. Genotype imputation is carried out by statistical methods that combine the GWAS data together with a reference panel of haplotypes. These methods take advantage of sharing of haplotypes between individuals over short stretches of sequence to impute alleles. Existing software packages for genotype imputation include IMPUTE2 and MaCH.|$|E

50|$|Altering the % {{inspiratory time}} (T%i) changes the {{proportion}} of the time in which the vibration or sound wave is above the baseline versus below it. <b>Increasing</b> <b>the</b> % Inspiratory Time will also <b>increase</b> <b>the</b> volume of gas moved or tidal volume.

2500|$|According to the {{equation}} listed above, <b>increasing</b> <b>the</b> trail and/or decreasing the head angle will <b>increase</b> <b>the</b> wheel flop factor {{on a bicycle}} or motorcycle, which will <b>increase</b> <b>the</b> torque required to bring the handlebars back to the straight ahead position and <b>increase</b> <b>the</b> vehicle's tendency to veer suddenly off the line of a curve. [...] Also, <b>increasing</b> <b>the</b> weight borne by the front wheel of the vehicle, either by <b>increasing</b> <b>the</b> mass of the vehicle, rider and cargo or by changing the weight ratio to shift the center of mass forward, will <b>increase</b> <b>the</b> severity of the wheel flop effect.

5|$|For atoms {{with low}} atomic numbers, a nucleus {{that has more}} {{neutrons}} than protons tends to drop to a lower energy state through radioactive decay so that the neutron–proton ratio is closer to one. However, as the atomic number increases, {{a higher proportion of}} neutrons is required to offset the mutual repulsion of the protons. Thus, there are no stable nuclei with equal proton and neutron numbers above atomic number Z = 20 (calcium) and as Z <b>increases,</b> <b>the</b> neutron–proton ratio of stable isotopes <b>increases.</b> <b>The</b> stable isotope with the highest proton–neutron ratio is lead-208 (about 1.5).|$|E
5|$|Further {{marketing}} of Sleeping Dogs was via cross-promotion on different platforms; players {{who bought the}} game through Steam received an eight item pack for Team Fortress 2, which was later made available for separate purchase, and a Hong Kong-themed Team Fortress 2 level, Kong King. Owners of Just Cause 2 on Xbox 360, PlayStation 3, or PC received automatic access to a Sleeping Dogs character outfit {{in the style of}} Just Cause 2 protagonist Rico Rodriguez. The outfit <b>increases</b> <b>the</b> player's action hijack statistics and <b>increases</b> <b>the</b> range from which the player can perform stunt takeovers of enemy vehicles.|$|E

25|$|<b>Increasing</b> <b>the</b> {{pressure}} in a gaseous reaction will <b>increase</b> <b>the</b> number of collisions between reactants, <b>increasing</b> <b>the</b> rate of reaction.

5|$|Some studies shows {{correlation}} of reduced hippocampus volume and {{posttraumatic stress disorder}} (PTSD). A study of Vietnam War combat veterans with PTSD showed a 20% reduction in the volume of their hippocampus compared with veterans having suffered no such symptoms. This finding was not replicated in chronic PTSD patients traumatized at an air show plane crash in 1988 (Ramstein, Germany). A 2016 study strengthened theory that a smaller hippocampus <b>increases</b> <b>the</b> risk for post-traumatic stress disorder, and a larger hippocampus <b>increases</b> <b>the</b> likelihood of efficacious treatment.|$|E

5|$|A non-safety fougasse {{could be}} built by simply burying the {{propelling}} charge behind the fuel drum and running leads through the soil. Instructions for several variants of this design were published but this construction <b>increases</b> <b>the</b> hazard because the leads {{would have to be}} left exposed on the surface and any electrical current applied could, theoretically, ignite the charge. Also, underground moisture could also easily ruin the charge {{over an extended period of}} time.|$|E

5|$|A recent design, called Hy-Con, {{seeks to}} combine the {{strengths}} of single-hull and double-hull construction. Short for Hybrid Configuration, this design doubles the forward-most and rear-most holds and leaves the others single-hulled.

5|$|A second project, {{the full}} {{duplication}} of the Cronulla branch line, {{was completed in}} 2010. This <b>increases</b> <b>the</b> capacity of the branch line from four to eight trains per hour.

A new timetable with extra services was introduced on 10 October 2010.|$|E
5|$|A special but unusual {{consideration}} is cardiogenic shock, where {{the blood pressure}} is decreased not due to dehydration but due to inability of the heart to pump blood through the blood vessels. This situation requires ICU admission, monitoring of the central venous pressure (which requires the insertion of a central venous catheter in a large upper body vein), and the administration of medication that <b>increases</b> <b>the</b> heart pumping action and blood pressure.|$|E

30|$|The {{source node}} can {{configure}} the SCCC encoder {{to cope with}} the quality of the channel between the nodes in <b>the</b> WSN.

If the WSN application is delay sensitive or the memory at the node is small, the source node can <b>increase</b> <b>the</b> free distance of the outer code by <b>increasing</b> <b>the</b> constraint length K and using longer generating codes. <b>Increasing</b> <b>the</b> free distance of the outer code will <b>increase</b> <b>the</b> interleaver gain for intermediate and high SNRs [23].|$|R
5|$|About 50–80% of {{salicylate}} in {{the blood}} is bound to albumin protein, while the rest remains in the active, ionized state; protein binding is concentration-dependent. Saturation of binding sites leads to more free salicylate and increased toxicity. The volume of distribution is 0.1–0.2 L/kg. Acidosis <b>increases</b> <b>the</b> volume of distribution because of enhancement of tissue penetration of salicylates.|$|E

5|$|An {{interesting}} {{example of}} a bottleneck causing unusual genetic distribution is the relatively high proportion of individuals with total rod cell color blindness (achromatopsia) on Pingelap atoll in Micronesia. After a bottleneck, inbreeding increases. This <b>increases</b> <b>the</b> damage done by recessive deleterious mutations, in {{a process known as}} inbreeding depression. The worst of these mutations are selected against, leading to the loss of other alleles that are genetically linked to them, in a process of background selection. For recessive harmful mutations, this selection can be enhanced {{as a consequence of the}} bottleneck, due to genetic purging.This leads to a further loss of genetic diversity. In addition, a sustained reduction in population size <b>increases</b> <b>the</b> likelihood of further allele fluctuations from drift in generations to come.|$|E
