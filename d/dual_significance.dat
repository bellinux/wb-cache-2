40|$|Hepatitis B virus (HBV) genotypes {{have been}} {{associated}} with specific patterns of disease and response to antiviral therapy. We investigated the effect of HBV genotype on HBV recurrence and mortality after liver transplantation (LT). Pretransplant sera of 45 hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) positive adults were submitted for HBV genotyping by a reverse-phase hybridization line probe assay with genotype-specific probes. Data were correlated with clinical outcomes after transplantation. Genotype A (n = 15), D (n = 13) and A/D (n = 12) accounted for 89 % of all genotypes. Coinfection with two HBV genotypes was encountered in 14 (31. 1 %) patients. Eighteen patients (40 %) developed HBV recurrence at a median of 10 months posttransplant (range, 1 - 53) and 10 patients (22 %) died at a median of 24 months (range, 3 - 63). Genotype D patients were more likely to develop HBV recurrence or die compared with genotype A patients, although this did not reach statistical <b>significance.</b> <b>Dual</b> infection with genotype A/D resulted in mortality similar to that of genotype A but recurrence similar to that of genotype D. Active viral replication at time of transplantation was the only independent factor (P = 0. 03) that predicted HBV recurrence. In conclusion, HBV genotype A and D did not {{have a significant impact on}} clinical outcomes of LT for HBV-related liver disease in patients of European origin. These data do not support routine HBV genotyping in liver transplantation. Copyright © 2004 by the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases. link_to_OA_fulltex...|$|R
40|$|Research Doctorate - Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) This project {{examined}} how {{the structure and}} dynamics in ceramics {{could be made to}} implement energy and change in the vessel form. A key objective was to clarify how the initial concept of symmetry in Antiquity, concerned with beauty, harmony, rhythm, balance and proportional relationships, changed. In this diachronic study of the concept of symmetry from an aesthetic point of view, the traditional viewing of the concept of ‘harmony of proportion’ can have the limitations sometimes implicit in symmetry — sameness, repetitiveness and indifference. In contrast to this vague notion of the concept, the changed modern viewing of symmetry is strictly geometrical, and absolutely precise. Like symmetry, asymmetry has <b>dual</b> aspects of <b>significance,</b> such as change, motion, dynamics, incongruence, disorder, chaos; another aspect is contrast, non-uniformity, diversity, freedom, individuality. For artists the new kind of space (curved space) offered by science signified such a new freedom to depart from earlier constraints. Picasso utilised this freedom in his ceramics, while ceramicists such as George Ohr, Peter Voulkos, Hans Coper and Edmund de Waal took advantage of both the dynamics and the freedom. Their contributions are considered to have formed the background to my own practice through their breaking of symmetry. This period of my ceramic practice was motivated by an exploration of various ways to continue to “break” symmetry to create new ceramic forms. My studio work ran in parallel with my theoretical research, influencing each other reciprocally in carrying out basic symmetry breaking operations as well as multiple operations for compound vessel forms. This body of work was inspired by fieldwork undertaken in Trento, Italy. This project offers to today’s ceramic artists, a wider, updated perception of symmetry/asymmetry, a broader understanding of its reciprocity and studio methodologies to explore its application...|$|R

5000|$|Most Christians {{simply no}} longer {{celebrate}} the Passover, {{since it is}} seen to belong rather to a Jewish or Old Testament tradition which {{they believe to be}} no longer necessary. Among those Christians who do observe the Passover, there are some differences in how this is done. Some follow the instructions that Jesus gave to his disciples {{at the time of his}} last meal before he was crucified, and share instead of roasted lamb, bread (usually unleavened) and wine. In the Christian Passover service the unleavened bread is used to represent Jesus' body, and wine represents his blood of the New Covenant (...) [...] These are a symbolic substitute for Jesus as the true sacrificial Passover [...] "Lamb of God" [...] (...) [...] It should also be noted that Passover day is followed in the Scriptures by seven days of unleavened bread (...) [...] These days have a great <b>dual</b> <b>significance</b> to the observant Christian. Just as leavening causes bread to be puffed up, so sin causes Christians to be [...] "puffed up" [...] with the sin of [...] "malice and wickedness," [...] and therefore must [...] "purge out" [...] that [...] "old leaven" [...] and replace it with [...] "the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth" [...] (King James Version - [...] ). Therefore, in the Christian Passover service Christ's body is represented by unleavened bread symbolizing his sinless life, for he alone had no sin (...)

The Whiskey Rebellion 1794, Harpers Ferry 1859, War with Spain 1898 and The Mexican Border Incident 1916, are not referenced, though Federal Service, since combat was not involved. They also indicate the former regimental designation, the Fifth Maryland, 1794-1941, and the popular sobriquet, [...] "The Dandy Fifth of Maryland." [...] The torteau alludes to the red of the uniform of the Baltimore Independent Cadets, the initial uniformed militia company of the Colony of Maryland; this uniform was later adopted during the Revolutionary War by Smallwood's Regiment of the Maryland Line. The swan is from the coat of arms of the Gist family and commemorates Mordecai Gist who on 3 December 1774 organized and commanded the Baltimore Independent Cadets, the parent unit of the regiment. The gold and black pattern in chief is from the reverse of the Great Seal of the proprietary Colony of Maryland, the family coat of arms of the Calverts, under whose authority the Mordecai Gist company was organized. The bayonet is representative of its introduction to American arms at the Battle of Long Island 1776, by the Maryland Line and in the use of which it became famed throughout the War.

By comparing and contrasting these two poets and their poetry, I investigate the interconnections between the sensual and the cerebral, the political and the corporeal, the intimate and the public matter that is language.

40|$|In this work, I {{investigate}} the moral import of preventable human neediness. Specifically, I am {{concerned with the}} issue of how the world's relatively well-off ought to live, given that they must do so against a pervasive background of poverty. Traditionally, this question is posed in a quantitative guise: How much must one give to poverty relief? How much can one be expected to sacrifice for the sake of helping others? While these are important questions, I argue that we can only find adequate answers to these "how much?" questions in the context of "how so?" questions that have been largely neglected in the literature. How should we see ourselves in relation to those stricken by poverty? What significance should we ascribe to the satisfaction of basic human needs?

To this end, a greenhouse experiment with five salinity treatments (ranging from 2. 0 to 5. 0 decisiemens (dS) m− 1) was carried out and a metabolomic fingerprinting approach was applied to obtain valuable insights on the complicated interactions between salinity treatments, environmental conditions, and the plant’s genetic background.

This paper is concerned with Patinkin's sociology. Hi approach by emphasizing the "central message " of a particular work, neglects the received sociological theory of knowledge in a way that compromises his entire investigation. This contention is illustrated by looking at Keynes's German contenders. They had anticipated Keynesian theories and applied them in the years before the General Theory was published. Nevertheless, they rejected aspects of Keyne ian economics after the appearanced the General Theory. True to his narrowly focussed approach, Patinkin could not analyze this body of work, which both anticipated and extended the Gen ral Theory.

40|$|Pound {{scholars}} {{have tended to}} assume that questions of state power, and {{of the relationship between}} the state and the individual, only become central to his work during the inter-war period. The present thesis, however, argues that these questions are a major concern in Pound’s writing during the years immediately preceding the First World War, and that questions of state power significantly colour Pound’s imagist and vorticist work. Chapter one reads Pound’s translation of the Anglo-Saxon Seafarer as a contribution to the radical Edwardian debate about the expansion of the state’s bureaucratic power and the threat it might pose to individual autonomy. I also consider the way Pound’s translation links state power to the division of labour. Chapter two reassesses Pound’s instigation of the imagist movement, against the backdrop of his concurrent fascination with the First Balkan War, an episode all but ignored in previous Pound scholarship. I argue that Pound interpreted the Balkan states as undertaking on the battlefield the very same modernizing struggle that he saw himself as embarking upon in the field of letters. Chapter three argues that as Pound’s pursuit of the ‘new’ intensifies, his identity as an American—as, in his words, ‘a citizen of a free State, a member of the sovereign people’—takes on a <b>dual</b> <b>significance.</b> Poetically, America’s perceived national youthfulness and virility become important tropes for novelty and modernity in his poetry. Politically, though, Pound casts the unfolding national, political and nascent imperial project of the United States as a metonym for modernity itself, scoffing at the Italian Futurist’s ‘automobilism’ as essentially provincial, and proposing instead his own ‘American Risorgimento’. Methodologically, this thesis strives to combine close readings of Pound’s poetry and prose, seen within its original publication context (that is, largely in little magazines), with careful reference to the broader historical context.

40|$|This thesis explores and {{analyses}} the practices, role {{and significance of}} housekeeping in the royal bedchambers at Hampton Court in the period between 1689 and 1737. Specifically, it seeks to chart contemporary practices of care and maintenance and to situate this work {{within the context of}} the rooms that lay at the heart of the late-Stuart and early-Hanoverian courts. A broad range of primary sources have been used to inform the study, in particular the records of the Lord Chamberlain and the Great Wardrobe. These archives are considered in relation to the material culture of the interiors at Hampton Court and are placed within the broader framework of social and political histories of the period. The thesis is divided into two main parts, the first of which explores the context of the royal bedchambers at Hampton Court. Starting with the premise that the practices of housekeeping were shaped by the specific environment in which they operated, it provides an exposition of the <b>dual</b> <b>significance</b> of this area of the palace as a space for magnificent court ceremony and as a retreat for the rituals of royal private life. Developing these findings, the second part of the study discusses housekeeping practices and the servants who undertook this work. In particular, it focuses on the identity, role and status of the lower ranking female servants of the bedchamber department, the Keeper of the Standing Wardrobe and the Privy Lodgings and the craftsmen of the Great Wardrobe. Throughout the discussion of these individuals, and the practices of care and maintenance, is framed by an analysis of the motivations for good housekeeping at court, and the meanings that were ascribed to this work. The research contained within this thesis contributes to our knowledge of the royal bedchambers at Hampton Court, in a key phase of the palace's history. by offering a more complete picture of how these rooms were inhabited by domestic servants as well as the monarch. New light is also shed on the many long periods when Hampton Court lay empty and the spheres of activity that took place in the absence of the court. The findings of this thesis demonstrate the significant role played by housekeeping as an essential underpinning for the use of Hampton Court as a royal home and as a splendid place of court...|$|E
