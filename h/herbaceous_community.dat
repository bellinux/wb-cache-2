Results indicated that the richness of <b>herbaceous</b> <b>community,</b> grasses and forbs significantly increased with the increased area of both undershrub canopies and open field. However, the cover and biomass of the <b>herbaceous</b> <b>community</b> beneath the shrub canopies decreased with increasing shrub size. Grasses and forbs, as different functional groups, responded differently to the increasing area of shrubs: the cover and biomass of grasses decreased while those of forbs increased. The cover and biomass of <b>herbaceous</b> <b>community,</b> grasses and forbs in the open field did not obviously vary with area. Under the shrub canopies, the cover and mass of litter positively correlated to area, {{but this was not}} the case in the open field. Our results suggest that shrubs have a positive effect on diversity and a negative effect on the cover and productivity of the <b>herbaceous</b> <b>community</b> in forest secondary succession on the alpine cutovers, and that these effects are size-dependent.

40|$|In the {{southern}} Great Plains, the encroachment of grassland ecosystems by mesquite (Prosopis glandulosa), is widespread, and prescribed fire {{is commonly used}} in its control. Despite this, substantial quantitative information concerning their influences on the community composition, functional dynamics, and soil organic carbon (SOC) storage potential of grassland ecosystems is lacking. The objectives {{of this study were}} to: a) quantify the effects of seasonal prescribed fire treatments and mesquite encroachment on aboveground net primary productivity (ANPP) and <b>herbaceous</b> <b>community</b> composition; b) characterize SOC pool sizes, turnover, and storage potential relative to vegetation type and fire treatment; c) evaluate the structure and diversity of soil microbial communities relative to vegetation type; and d) characterize the functional diversity of these same microbes using the GeoChip functional gene microarray. Repeated winter and summer fires led to increased ANPP rates (average, 434 and 313 g m- 2 y- 1, respectively), relative to unburned controls (average, 238 g m- 2 y- 1), altered <b>herbaceous</b> <b>community</b> composition, and increased the storage of resistant forms of SOC, but did not affect overall SOC storage. Herbaceous ANPP rates did not differ significantly as a result of mesquite encroachment, but <b>herbaceous</b> <b>community</b> composition and SOC storage did. Mesquite soils contained significantly more total, slow-turnover, and resistant forms of SOC than those that occurred beneath C 3 or C 4 grasses. Similarity among the soil bacterial and fungal communities associated with the major vegetation types in this system was low to moderate. Significant differences were detected among soil fungi, with the mesquite-associated fungi harboring significant differences in community structure relative to the fungal communities associated with each of the other vegetation types examined. Despite this result, few significant differences were detected with respect to the functional diversity of these communities, suggesting either a high degree of functional redundancy, or that the functional differences harbored by these communities are beyond the scope of the GeoChip.

However, little is known about how changes in intraspecific and interspecific traits across sites influence species richness and community assembly, especially in understory <b>herbaceous</b> <b>communities.</b> Here we partitioned the variance of four functional traits (maximum height, leaf thickness, leaf area and specific leaf area) across four nested biological scales: individual, species, plot, and elevation to quantify the scale-dependent distributions of understory herbaceous trait variance. We also integrated the comparison of the trait variance ratios to null models to investigate the effects of different ecological processes on community assembly and functional diversity along a 1200 -m elevational gradient in Yulong Mountain. We found interspecific trait variation was the main trait variation component for leaf traits, although intraspecific trait variation ranged from 10 % to 28 % of total variation. In particular, maximum height exhibited high plasticity, and intraspecific variation accounted for 44 % of the total variation. Despite the fact that species composition varied across elevation and species richness decreased dramatically along the elevational gradient, there was little variance at our largest (elevation) scale in leaf traits and functional diversity remained constant along the elevational gradient, indicating that traits responded to smaller scale influences. External filtering was only observed at high elevations. However, strong internal filtering was detected along the entire elevational gradient in understory <b>herbaceous</b> <b>communities,</b> possibly due to competition.

Since increased climate variability is expected to favour the invasive success of exotic species, we conducted a field experiment to study the effects that simulated rainy ENSO events in combination with herbivores and shade have on the composition of a semiarid <b>herbaceous</b> <b>community</b> in north-central Chile. We hypothesized that water pulses, such as those associated with rainy ENSO events could trigger {{significant changes in the}} relative abundance of exotic and native herbaceous species. Specifically, we predicted an increase in native grasses and a reduction in the abundance of exotic species, especially prostrate forbs, if water pulses were combined with reduced herbivory. We found that herbivory by small mammals, especially introduced European rabbits (Oryctolagus cuniculus) and hares (Lepus europaeus), have an overwhelming effect on species abundance and composition in this semiarid <b>herbaceous</b> <b>community.</b> Herbivore exclusion produced an overall increase in herb density and biomass mostly due to the extraordinary growth of tall native grasses (especially Bromus berterianus) that outcompeted small prostrate forbs (both native and exotic ones), and small exotic grasses (Koeleria pleoides, Schismus arabicus).

The ponderosa pine and Douglas-fir/ponderosa pine communities ’ herbaceous composition remained relatively constant between 1981 and 1996; however, a few individual species in both communities experienced sig-nificant changes in frequency over time. These individual species changes, along with dominant shifts in the forest canopy, were inconsistent with Marr’s original successional hypotheses for these stands that stated the ponderosa pine stand would remain dominated by ponderosa pine and grassy openings and the Douglas-fir/ponderosa pine stand would eventually have equal dominance between the two tree species. The aspen <b>herbaceous</b> <b>community</b> experienced the most significant change between 1981 and 1996. Significant decreases in species richness and diversity were recorded along with large changes in species composition and frequencies of individual species. These changes were associated with successional changes in the forest canopy, which was congruent with Marr’s successional hypothesis for this stand. The kobresia meadow <b>herbaceous</b> <b>community</b> showed the least change between 1981 and 1996 among the four communities; however, there was variation in frequency percentages for a few individual species over time and a small turnover in species composition.
