60|$|The person it {{appeared}} least to concern proved to be, till dinner, little Miles himself. My perambulations had given me, meanwhile, no glimpse of him, {{but they had}} tended to make more public the change taking place in our relation {{as a consequence of}} his having at the piano, the day before, kept me, in Flora's interest, so beguiled and befooled. The stamp of publicity had of course been fully given by her confinement and departure, and the change itself was now ushered in by our nonobservance of the regular custom of the schoolroom. He had already disappeared when, on my way down, I pushed open his door, and I learned below that he had breakfasted--in the presence of a couple of the maids--with Mrs. Grose and his sister. He had then gone out, as he said, for a stroll; than which nothing, I reflected, could better have expressed his <b>frank</b> <b>view</b> of the abrupt transformation of my office. What he would not permit this office to consist of was yet to be settled: there was a queer relief, at all events--I mean for myself in especial--in the renouncement of one pretension. If so much had sprung to the surface, I scarce put it too strongly in saying that what had perhaps sprung highest was the absurdity of our prolonging the fiction that I had anything more to teach him. It sufficiently stuck out that, by tacit little tricks in which even more than myself he carried out the care for my dignity, I had had to appeal to him to let me off straining to meet him on the ground of his true capacity. He had at any rate his freedom now; I was never to touch it again; as I had amply shown, moreover, when, on his joining me in the schoolroom the previous night, I had uttered, {{on the subject of the}} interval just concluded, neither challenge nor hint. I had too much, from this moment, my other ideas. Yet when he at last arrived, the difficulty of applying them, the accumulations of my problem, were brought straight home to me by the beautiful little presence on which what had occurred had as yet, for the eye, dropped neither stain nor shadow.|$|E

The Stephanowskis bring hope back the story when the reader sees their family and their relationships with each other. This brings hope to Camilla and Frank as well.

These are individuals with individual thoughts and ideas coming together to try and work as one in the best way that they can. There is a lot of forgiving and understanding that goes on.|$|E

That this view was widely shared in Burnell's own time is suggested by his bitter reference to [...] "the other babblers" [...] (i.e. critics) who had apparently ridiculed his play, and whom he in turn regarded with contempt. His efforts to have an earlier play produced had apparently failed, due in his opinion to the hostility of his critics.|$|E

The book Matka and Other Writings (London: Mercury Graphics; includes some texts translated from French by Gillian Raffles) is from manuscript sheets which have lain forgotten and unpublished for over fifty years. One part of this group of papers is a version of Matka and it includes her first meeting and her life with Henri Gaudier, and their adoption of the name Gaudier-Brzeska. It contains her account of what happened to her immediately after Henri Gaudier-Brzeska was killed at the Front in France in 1915 and graphically recounts her efforts and trials to arrange a memorial exhibition of his work, and gives a <b>frank</b> <b>view</b> of how she felt his friends, T.

5000|$|While {{the work}} {{may seem to}} be {{something}} of a bitter diatribe against the organisation that ostracized him it should be remembered that Austin referred to Christianity with great respect in many other works. He attacked the religion's blind faith in its own infallibility without ever losing sight of the Church's many beneficial traits. In a 1928 edition of The Austin Pulpit (a sister publication to Reason) he referred to the bible as being the [...] "First among equals" [...] among religious texts, provided that it is [...] "interpreted rationally". In his 1920 book [...] "The ABC of Spiritualism", Austin answered the question of how Spiritualists should relate to the organised Christian church by reminding his readers that Churches have [...] "done good in many ways". He advised his followers to learn from the many centuries that the Christian church has in religious work as [...] "they cannot but have learned some wisdom". He does finish, it must be admitted, by saying that [...] "a frank acknowledgment of the good done by churches makes the way open for a clear statement on their fallacies and falsities" [...] ix. As in all things Austin praised an honest and <b>frank</b> <b>view</b> of the Truth.|$|E
40|$|The {{research}} study considers insights and challenges to listening to young children’s voices in a pre-school in England. The study {{was motivated by}} {{the political and social}} agendas which assert the fundamental involvement of young children as active decision-makers in all aspects of their lives (for example, the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child of 1989 and the Children Act 2004). The researcher aimed for participatory research with the children and staff to explore effective ways in which young children’s communications might be supported through the co-creation of their early years curriculum. The intention was to focus on ‘tools’ and techniques that might support children’s voices which were gaining attention in the academic literature (for example, the Mosaic Approach introduced by Alison Clark and Peter Moss). As a recent early years practitioner at the pre-school, the researcher offers a <b>frank</b> <b>view</b> of the potential complexities of implementing such participatory research. The researcher took an innovative, flexible and highly reflective stance to adapting the research approach in response to the challenges to establishing participation that emerged, using a postmodern framework to assist meaning-making. A substantive finding was that although the ‘tools’ and techniques opened a significant space for beginning to listen to children’s voices, it was the constructions of the underpinning relationships that offered the most potential (and the greatest challenge) for genuinely participating with and hearing children. The study concluded a focus on the latter is paramount for children to be accorded their rights as active decision-makers...|$|E

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{consists of}} two parts. Part I deals with analyses of the textstructure, the content and the possible sources of GKS. 1657. Part II is a critical edition of manuscript GKS 1657 in the Royal Library in Copenhagen. The manuscript dates from the 15 th century and is written in the southern Dutch dialect of Brabant but with touches of Flemish. It is an instruction manual for women and deals with pregnancy, childbirth, child-care, menstruation and women's diseases. It {{is characterized by a}} <b>frank</b> <b>view</b> on sexuality and shuns value judgements in its attitude towards women. In addition to this neutral, perhaps even progressive attitude, the manuscript also contains scraps of popular magic and cabbala. GKS 1657 is rich in both language and content and provides important documentation of women's culture. In the study GKS 1657 is compared with MS 593, which is from the same period and region. MS 593 also deals with menstruation, women's diseases and, briefly, with childcare, but not with pregnancy and childbirth. Although the subject matter of MS 593 bears in certain parts, a similarity with that of GKS 1657, it is presented differently. MS 593 also lacks the marginal notes indicating that GKS 1657 was in use over a period of 150 - 200 years. The comparison shows the complexity of such manuscripts as well as the inadvisability of attaching simple labels to attitudes in any particular epoch. A major aim of the study is to make manuscript GKS 1657 availible to readers other than those normally interested in medieval texts and to stimulate further interdiscip­linary studies. digitalisering@um...|$|E

Measured by our Christianity of to-day, bad as it is, hypocritical as it is, empty and hollow as it is, neither the Deity nor his Son is a Christian, nor qualified for that moderately high place.
