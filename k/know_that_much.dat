500|$|On December 16, 1956, American Broadcasting Company {{president}} Oliver E. Treyz announced Aubrey {{would immediately}} become the network's head of programming and talent. [...] ABC, the weakest {{of the three}} networks, was a perennial also-ran with a weak roster of affiliates and programs, something comparable to {{the early days of}} the Fox Network. Aubrey later said [...] "at that time, there was no ABC. The headquarters was an old riding stable. But I went because [...] Leonard Goldenson in effect said, 'Look, I don't <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>much</b> about TV, I'm a lawyer.' And he let me have autonomy." ...|$|E
500|$|When {{it became}} public in early 2005 {{that the book}} would be published, representatives of Morrison {{contacted}} the publishers of the book. Said Rogan to The Irish Times: [...] "There has been contact with the publishers, I <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>much.</b> When the news broke {{earlier this year that}} the book was being published, his lawyers asked to see an advance copy of the manuscript. The publishers refused the request. But then {{this is a man who}} when he learnt that there was going to be a plaque erected outside his former Belfast home, got his solicitors to write to the Belfast Telegraph dissociating himself from the tribute." [...] The book was first published in 2005 by Secker & Warburg, and a 2006 edition was published by Vintage Books. Johnny Rogan appeared on a panel of experts in the 2008 documentary Van Morrison: Under Review 1964–1974, along with Steve Turner, author of the 1993 biography [...]|$|E
500|$|A Cajun mutant thief who has {{the ability}} to convert the {{potential}} energy of any object he touches into kinetic energy, forcing it to explode. The size of the object determines the magnitude of the resulting explosion. He is also skilled in the use of a staff, and happens to be very agile. Due to the nature of his power, he displays supernatural durability, being able to take Wolverine's elbow to his face and return to fight moments later. When asked about his thoughts on the character, Kitsch had said, [...] "I knew of him, but I didn't know the following he had. I'm sure I'm still going to be exposed to that. I love the character, I love the powers, and I love what they did with him. I didn't <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>much,</b> but in my experience, it was a blessing to go in and create my take on him. I'm excited for it, to say the least." ...|$|E

Although there is no report of environmental disaster of high magnitude associated with produced water disposal in Niger Delta region of Nigeria, it is nevertheless <b>known</b> <b>that</b> <b>much</b> of this waste fluid is discharged into the environment or re-injected into the wells (Ezemagu 2015).|$|R
500|$|Since the subfossil {{bones of}} extinct lemurs {{have been found}} {{alongside}} the remains of highly arboreal living lemur species, we <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>much</b> of Madagascar had been covered in forest prior {{to the arrival of}} humans; however, the forest coverage of the high plateau region has been debated. [...] Humbert and other botanists suggested that the central plateau had once been blanketed in forest, later to be destroyed by fire for use by humans. [...] However, recent paleoenvironmental studies by Burney have shown that the grasslands of that region have fluctuated over the course of millennia and were not entirely created by humans. [...] Similarly, the role humans played in the aridification of the south and southwest has been questioned, since natural drying of the climate started before human arrival. [...] The marshes of the region (in which subfossil remains have been found) have dried up, subfossil sites have yielded a host of arboreal lemurs, and site names, such as Ankilitelo ("place of three kily or tamarind trees") suggest a recent wetter past. [...] Pollen {{studies have shown that the}} aridification process began nearly 3,000years ago, and peaked 1,000years prior to the time of the extinctions. [...] However, no extinctions occurred prior to the arrival of humans, and the recent climatic changes have not been as severe as those prior to human arrival, suggesting that humans and their effect on the vegetation did play a role in the extinctions. [...] The central plateau lost more species than the dry south and southwest, suggesting that degraded habitats were more affected than arid habitats.|$|E

The traditional view of the deep-sea realm as a hostile and barren place was discredited long ago, and scientists now <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>much</b> of Europe's deep sea is rich and diverse.|$|E
2500|$|On {{the advice}} of his agent, Wesley Rose, Orbison left Monument in mid-1965 for a more lucrative {{contract}} with MGM Records, with Rose taking over as producer. Orbison did not ask for Porter on his recording sessions, and he did not have any hit songs with MGM. Years later, Porter said that, though he really liked Orbison, the singer [...] "never understood the engineer's contribution." [...] It was Rose's advice to leave Monument, and he was [...] "doing his job as a manager" [...] to get more money, but, said Porter, [...] "he didn't <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>much</b> about the music." [...] Porter felt that only with himself as engineer, Fred Foster as producer and Anita Kerr as arranger was Orbison going to find the right combination.|$|E

[...] Jurek has compared him favorably to experimental and avant-garde vocalists Mike Patton and Diamanda Galas. Loudwire wrote [...] "Sporting incredibly low death metal gutturals, Kyo can also turn a complete 180 as one of metal's highest shriekers." [...] Dane Prokofiev of PopMatters said that his [...] "natural ease at and inclination towards striking such a stark contrast between the two {{opposite ends of the}} human vocal spectrum can be obtained as only a kind of pre-birth winning lottery ticket—you <b>know,</b> <b>that</b> <b>much</b> coveted prize we call “talent”." ...|$|E

50|$|After Luchana, Espartero's {{government}} forces successfully drove the Carlists back northward. <b>Knowing</b> <b>that</b> <b>much</b> {{of the support}} for the Carlist cause came from supporters of regional autonomy, Espartero convinced the Queen-Regent to compromise with the fueros {{on the issue of}} regional autonomy and retain their loyalty.
