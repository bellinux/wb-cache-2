40|$|This paper {{reviews the}} <b>fatigue</b> <b>failure</b> {{mechanisms}} for the automobile crankshaft under service loading through the stochastic point of view. <b>Fatigue</b> <b>failure</b> of crankshafts are reviewed in general, {{as it is}} a major concern due to the uncertainties that arise i. e. randomness in structural materials, the geometric shape of the component and randomness of service loads. There has been very little research carried out in assessing the <b>fatigue</b> <b>failure</b> using the stochastic process in predicting the fatigue life of crankshafts. This review paper discusses the durability aspects of the component and is followed by a review of the characteristics of loading and the stochastic <b>fatigue</b> <b>failure</b> effect on the components. In addition, the stochastic approach from empirical model aspect using a safe-life approach from the more recent advances in computational methods to assess stochastic <b>fatigue</b> <b>failure</b> was discussed and reviewed {{in the context of this}} paper. The integration between the empirical and probabilistic methods can be quantified using statistical models, which evaluate the damage that leads to fatigue and eventually <b>fatigue</b> <b>failure.</b> Hence, this review provides a platform for understanding the stochastic <b>fatigue</b> <b>failure</b> for an accurate predictive prediction on the structural integrity of components, especially in the automobile industry...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{shows how}} {{the design of a}} {{structure}} can evolve when considering a stressbased topology optimization along with <b>fatigue</b> <b>failure</b> constraints. More precisely, <b>fatigue</b> <b>failure</b> is added in a stress-based topology optimization Matlab code by following the approach of the design of machine elements, i. e. based on S-N curves or fatigue criteria. The fatigue is introduced through weel-known criteria for high-cycle fatigue such as the Sines and Crossland criteria. The paper presents how these criteria can be formulated for a topology optimization problem. Numerical results for both criteria are successively compared and discussed. The character of <b>fatigue</b> <b>failure</b> in the optimization procedure is illustrated as well as some issues that have to be improved in future work...|$|R
40|$|Different {{approaches}} {{to determine the}} acceptance criteria for <b>fatigue</b> induced <b>failure</b> of structural systems and components are discussed and compared. The considered approaches take basis in either optimization (societal cost-benefit analysis) or are derived from past and actual practice or codes (revealed preferences). The system acceptance criteria are {{expressed in terms of}} the maximal acceptable annual probability of collapse due to <b>fatigue</b> <b>failure.</b> Acceptance criteria for the individual <b>fatigue</b> <b>failure</b> modes are then derived using a simplified system reliability model. The consequence of <b>fatigue</b> <b>failure</b> of the individual joints is related to the overall system by evaluating the change in system reliability given <b>fatigue</b> <b>failure.</b> This is facilitated by the use of a simple indicator, the Residual Influence Factor. The acceptance criteria is thus formulated {{as a function of the}} system redundancy and complexity. In addition, the effect of dependencies in the structure on the acceptance criteria are investigated. Finally an example is presented where the optimal allocation of the risk to different welded joints in a jacket structure is performed by consideration of the necessary maintenance efforts.

40|$|A new multi-axial fatigue {{model for}} fiber-reinforced {{composite}} laminates based on Puck’s criterion is proposed in this article. In the fatigue model, fatigue master curves from the ATM {{are used to}} determine the uniaxial ply fatigue strengths and the multi-axial <b>fatigue</b> <b>failure</b> is then determined by Puck’s criterion with the fatigue strengths at the ply level. The fatigue master curves from ATM are generated with limited uniaxial fatigue tests and can be applied to fatigue loading conditions with various frequencies and stress ratios. Both uniaxial and multi-axial S-N curves can be derived from thefatigue model. <b>Fatigue</b> <b>failure</b> envelopes are also generated from the model to better interpret the multi-axial <b>fatigue</b> <b>failure</b> in multi-axial stress spaces. The proposed multi-axial fatigue model is based on ply-level predictions, but it can beextended to laminate-level predictions with the CLT or numerical methods such as the FEM. Multi-axial <b>fatigue</b> <b>failures</b> caused by either local or global multi-axiality can be predicted by the model. Both uniaxial and biaxial fatigue experimentswere carried out to provide test data for establishing and validating the proposed fatigue model. The application oftheproposed multi-axial fatigue model is demonstrated with predictions of S-N curves and <b>fatigue</b> <b>failure</b> envelopes of unidirectional laminates and multi-directional laminates with typical lay-up configurations. The predictions from the proposed fatigue model are also compared with various experimental results and reasonably good agreement is observed...|$|R
40|$|A {{review of}} records {{maintained}} by the National Transportation Safety Board showed that 16, 054 civil aviation accidents occurred in the United States during the 3 -year period ending December 31, 1969. Material failure was {{an important factor in}} the cause of 942 of these accidents. Fatigue was identified as the mode of the material failures associated with the cause of 155 accidents and in many other accidents the records indicated that <b>fatigue</b> <b>failures</b> might have been involved. There were 27 fatal accidents and 157 fatalities in accidents in which <b>fatigue</b> <b>failures</b> of metal components were definitely identified. <b>Fatigue</b> <b>failures</b> associated with accidents occurred most frequently in landing-gear components, followed in order by powerplant, propeller, and structural components in fixed-wing aircraft and tail-rotor and main-rotor components in rotorcraft. In a study of 230 laboratory reports on failed components associated with the cause of accidents, fatigue was identified as the mode of failure in more than 60 percent of the failed components. The most frequently identified cause of fatigue, as well as most other types of material failures, was improper maintenance (including inadequate inspection). Fabrication defects, design deficiencies, defective material, and abnormal service damage also caused many <b>fatigue</b> <b>failures.</b> Four case histories of major accidents are included in the paper as illustrations of some of the factors invovled in <b>fatigue</b> <b>failures</b> of aircraft components...|$|R
40|$|Fatigue limit tests {{where there}} are two {{competing}} <b>fatigue</b> <b>failure</b> locations, two notches of different size, are performed in this paper. The normal distribution is used for describing the experimental outcome, where the largest occurring stress value or the gradient adjusted stress {{is used as a}} stress measure. Another model for describing the experimental outcome is the Weakest Link (WL) -integral where the integration is performed over the specimen surface area or the specimen volume. The longitudinal positions of the estimated <b>fatigue</b> <b>failure</b> sites are measured and investigated as well. Neither the normal distribution (point stress and gradient adjusted point stress), nor the WL-integral can explain the experimental outcome from the competing notch tests. They all predict the same trend, but not the same trend as in the experiments. When looking at the estimated longitudinal location of <b>fatigue</b> <b>failure</b> {{it can be seen that}} it differs considerably from experiment to experiment. If the stress is evaluated at the estimated <b>fatigue</b> <b>failure</b> location, it is seen that the local stress is much lower than the maximal stress. The load cases where there should be an equal amount of failures in both notches according to the different models do not agree with the experimental findings. It is concluded that stress based continuum models can not describe the experimental outcome when there are competing <b>fatigue</b> <b>failure</b> sites (notches) present. QC 20121025 </p...|$|R
