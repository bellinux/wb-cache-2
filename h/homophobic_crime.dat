5000|$|The {{situation}} is changing in the 21st century, in part {{thanks to the}} discovery of the LGBT community as potential consumers, the so-called pink peso, and tourists. Laws have been created to combat discrimination (2003), and two federal entities, the Federal District and Coahuila, have legalized civil unions for same-sex couples (2007). On December 21, 2009, despite opposition from the Church, the Government of Mexico City approved same-sex marriage, with 39 votes in favor, 20 against and 5 abstaining. It was the first city in Latin America to do so. [...] However, in 2007 Mexico was still one of the countries in which the most crimes are committed against the LGBT community, with a person being murdered in a <b>homophobic</b> <b>crime</b> every two days.|$|E
40|$|In this {{compelling}} and timely book, Larry Ray offers a wide-ranging and integrated {{account of the}} many manifestations of violence in society. He examines violent behaviour and its meanings in contemporary culture and throughout history. Introducing the major theoretical debates, the book examines different levels of violence - interpersonal, institutional and collective - and different forms of violence - such as racist crime, <b>homophobic</b> <b>crime</b> and genocide. It provides readers with a succinct and comprehensive overview of its nature and effects, and the solutions and conflict resolutions involved in responses to violence. Interdisciplinary in its approach, the text draws on evidence from sociology, criminology, primate studies and archaeology {{to shed light on}} arguments about the social construction and innate nature of violence. Engaging, wide-reaching and authorative, this is essential reading for students, academics and researchers in sociology, criminology, social pyschology and cultural studies...|$|E
40|$|This {{research}} project explores gay men’s attitudes to, perceptions {{and experiences of}} community safety and risk amongst Edinburgh’s LGBT places and spaces. Previous research focused {{on the experience of}} <b>homophobic</b> <b>crime</b> but did not explore the ideas of community safety that the gay men held and the impact that fear of abuse has on the men’s sense of sexual citizenship. Previous research spoke of gay men self-policing in order to avoid any negative attention, that homosexual displays are more commonly seen in large cities (Johnson 2002), and the importance of family support after experiencing abuse (Rivers et al 2010). It also stated that abuse is more common at night and in public, particularly gay venues (Rivers et al 2010, Morrison and MacKay 2000). Although there is research on homosexuality and abuse, there has been very little focusing on Edinburgh. This research attempts to address this through the use of the Photovoice method. Photovoice asks participants to take photographs of things they feel are relevant to the topic of interest. In this instance it is two participants view of safety and risk in Edinburgh’s gay community. To compensate for a small number of participants, a secondary data source is examined. The research found that the personal relationships the participants built had a positive impact on their feelings of safety and support. Also the places the participants used were important in order to maintain a sense of safety and sexual citizenship. There were also indications that there was a propensity to manage their identities in certain social settings so as to hide their sexuality from certain people, for fear of being subjected to physical or emotional abuse. The results revealed three key themes of support networks, places of safety and experiences of abuse. Keywords: Gay, safety, support, abuse, Photovoic...|$|E

40|$|Abstract {{copyright}} UK Data Service {{and data}} collection copyright owner. The Metropolitan Police Service User Satisfaction Survey (MPS USS) (formerly known as the Crime Victim Survey) is a corporate survey tool used to measure crime victims' satisfaction with a specific instance of their contact with police. The survey covers the process from initial contact with police, through to police action and follow-up, whilst considering police treatment throughout the process. These elements feed into the main measure of 'Overall Satisfaction', and the results feed into the 'Citizen Focus' domain of Home Office measures. The Overall Satisfaction measure is further explored in order to monitor difference in satisfaction between white and black and minority ethnic (BME) groups, as well as victims of racist incidents. The results are gathered through telephone interviews with c. 18, 000 victims a year, by an external market research company {{on behalf of the}} MPS. Victims are interviewed 6 - 12 weeks after they have reported the crime, and interviewing takes place throughout the year. The file currently includes data from 32 quarters between 2005 / 6 and 2012 / 13, though the documentation largely covers 2011 onwards. The sample includes victims of burglary, violent crime, vehicle crime, racially-motivated and <b>homophobic</b> <b>crime,</b> between the ages of 16 to 85 years. It excludes victims of domestic violence, serious assaults and sexual offences. Road Traffic Collision victims have not been surveyed since the fiscal year 2012 - 13. The USS data is reported quarterly within the MPS, and is also provided to the Home Office and Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary (HMIC). Another MPS survey series, the Metropolitan Police Public Attitudes Surveys, is held at the UK Data Archive under SN 7048. The first edition of the study included data up to 2012 (quarter 27); for the second edition (June 2013), data and documentation from the 2012 - 2013 survey (quarters 28 - 32) were added to the study; for the third edition (February 2016), data and documentation from the 2013 / 14 and 2014 / 15 waves have been added. Main Topics : The questionnaire covers police response to the incident report; subsequent police actions and follow-up; victims' perceptions of their treatment by the police, overall satisfaction/dissatisfaction with the service received; respondent demographics...|$|E

One argument is that conflating violence against trans peoples with violence against gay people erases the identities of people in the greater trans communities and the truth of what happens to them.

Results show that social discourses reveal an attitude of non-acceptance of homosexuality and the lack of one perpetrator type or characteristic contexts associated with the occurrence of episodes of victimization with homophobic motivation, prevailing, however, the verbal abuse. In this scenario, the victims tend to mobilize strategies of concealment of sexual orientation, using various types of social support...|$|R

40|$|This study {{examines}} {{the phenomenon of}} gay tourist victimisation, {{from the viewpoint of}} gay tourists.

The paper questions whether taking these findings together suggests that gay tourists suffer particularly higher levels of victimisation. A qualitative survey of a sample of gay tourists is undertaken with two rounds of interviews. The findings suggest that gay tourists do suffer high levels of victimisation on holiday, though measurement difficulties prevent generalisations. In common with other research, it is also found that: incidents are not reported (for fear of further victimisation in some cases); the types of crime are similar to those suffered by other tourists with additional homophobic related crimes; the lifestyle choices of gay men influence victimisation; offenders of <b>homophobic</b> <b>crimes</b> {{are more likely to be}} other tourists; and gay men are often discriminated against by the tourism industry. The paper concludes by arguing that, although a complex issue, experience and fear of victimisation influence the holiday decision-making processes of gay men...|$|R

5000|$|Wylly's {{political}} acting {{of defending}} minority rights and his very existence as an openly gay congress member {{and human rights}} activist have transformed him in a public enemy of conservative political forces in Brazil.

Among other quotes attributed to him, the one that he had affirmed that the Bible was [...] "a joke" [...] Christians and Bible followers were “clowns” was highly spread. In spite of those quotes had never been existed, people in social networks still share them, strengthening the ongoing hate campaign against Wyllys. To clean up his image damaged by that orchestrated campaign, he created a section on his official webpage where he refutes all the quotes attributed to him.
