40|$|In the {{doctoral}} dissertation {{from which this}} chapter is drawn, Ashwin Ram presented an alternative perspective on the processes of story understanding, explanation, and learning. The issues that Ram explores in that <b>dissertation</b> <b>are</b> <b>similar</b> to those that are explored by the other authors in this book, but the angle that Ram takes on these issues is somewhat different. Ram's exploration of these processes is organized around the central theme of question asking. For Ram, understanding a story means identifying questions that the story raises, and questions that it answers. Question asking {{also serves as a}} lens through which each of the sub-processes of is viewed: the retrieval of stored explanations, for instance, is driven by a library of what Ram calls "XP retrieval questions"; likewise, evaluation is driven by another set of questions, called "hypothesis verification questions". The AQUA program, which is Ram's implementation of this question-based theory of understanding, is a very complex system, probably the most complex among the programs described in this book. AQUA covers a great deal of ground; it implements the entire case-based explanation process in a question-based manner. In this chapter, we have focused on the high-level description of the questions the programs asks, especially the questions it asks when constructing and evaluating explanations of volitional actions...|$|R

40|$|Systems {{that provide}} group {{membership}} services (e. g., Isis) {{can be used}} to solve many canonical problems in distributed systems, such as Consensus and Leader Election. However, solving these problems has been shown to require failure detectors of various strengths, all of which are impossible to implement in an asynchronous system. It has been shown {{that it is possible to}} solve Consensus in an asynchronous distributed system using a very weak failure detector. However, existing group membership systems do not appear to implement this type of failure detector. Furthermore, there are other problems that can be solved with group membership services, such as Leader Election, that are harder than Consensus and cannot be solved without a perfect failure detector. This leads to an apparent contradiction: how can provably impossible problems be solved in existing group membership systems? In this dissertation, we investigate approximations to perfect failure detectors in order to obtain acceptable and practical solutions to otherwise-impossible problems such as Election. We argue that approximating a perfect failure detector yields approximate solutions to these problems, and define a notion of approximation that yields solutions that are useful in practice. We give a formal specification of an approximately-perfect failure detector, give two protocols that implement our approximation, and derive upper bounds on the number of tolerable failures for any such protocol. The approximately-perfect failure detector presented in this <b>dissertation</b> <b>is</b> <b>similar</b> to that used in Isis; this implies that the failure detector implemented in group membership services such as Isis are actually approximately-perfect failure detectors, and that the resulting solutions to Consensus, Election, and other problems are approximate solutions. Furthermore, the protocols that implement our specification are very simple and can be easily implemented. Such an implementation could be used in existing or future group membership services, or by other systems programmers for whom group membership services are not necessary but for whom failure detection would be useful...|$|R
40|$|The Hox gene {{products}} are transcription factors involved in specifying regional identity along the anteroposterior body axis. In Drosophila, where these genes {{are known as}} HOM-C (Homeotic-complex) genes and {{where they have been}} most extensively studied, they are expressed in restricted domains along the anteroposterior axis with different anterior limits. Genetic analysis {{of a large number of}} gain- and loss-of-function alleles of these genes has revealed that these genes are important in specifying segmental identity at their anterior limits of expression. Furthermore, there is a functional dominance of posterior genes over anterior genes, such that posterior genes can dominantly specify their developmental programs in spite of the expression of more anterior genes in the same segment. In the mouse, there are four clusters of HOM-C genes, called Hox genes. Thus, there may be up to four genes, called paralogs, that are more highly homologous to each other and to their Drosophila homolog than they are to the other mouse Hox genes. The single mutants for two paralogous genes, hoxa- 4 and hoxd- 4, presented in this <b>dissertation,</b> <b>are</b> <b>similar</b> to several other mouse Hox mutants in that they show partial, incompletely penetrant homeotic transformations of vertebrae at their anterior limit of expression. These mutants were then bred with hoxb- 4 mutants (Ramirez-Solis, et al. 1993) to generate the three possible double mutant combinations as well as the triple mutant. The skeletal phenotypes of these group 4 Hox compound mutants displayed clear alterations in regional identity, such that a nearly complete transformation towards the morphology of the first cervical vertebra occurs. These results suggest a certain degree of functional redundancy among paralogous genes in specifying regional identity. Furthermore, there was a remarkable dose-dependent increase in the number of vertebrae transformed to a first cervical vertebra identity, including the second through the fifth cervical vertebrae in the triple mutant. Thus, these genes are required in a larger anteroposterior domain than is revealed by the single mutant phenotypes alone, such that multiple mutations in these genes result in transformations of vertebrae that are not at their anterior limit of expression. ...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{deals with}} texts about the intelligentsia in Soviet Lithuania; the texts {{were written in}} 1950 – 1989 in Lithuania and the USSR. In this period the intelligentsia was {{considered}} to be a social stratum specializing in mental work. While used in the Soviet environment the term intelligentsia was often replaced by the terms staff (cadre) and specialists. This tendency reveals an attempt to view the intelligentsia in a manpower context. A great deal of research is reviewed in this article. The texts were written and published by a variety of researchers: historians, economists, demographists, and sociologists, all dealing with the engineering, technical, scientific, medical, artistic, educational, and administrative intelligentsia, both urban and rural. Little of the analysis was original; these studies were supposed to serve as evidence for and to bolster Marxist-Leninist schemes of societal development. Only a few sociologists were capable of producing an “allusive” if semiofficial sociology. The construction of party discourse in late Soviet socialism was secret, classified, and ossified linguistically: some made-up phrases were wandering from one text to another. Humanitarian and sociological discourses were affected by these alterations as well. Statistical data and party resolutions were circulating round and round.

In 1986, the Human Sciences Research Council completed a study of 300 White single parents drawn from lists of children from single parent families at 13 primary schools in the Pretoria School Board District. The report investigated the needs and problems of single parent families, the existence or lack of support facilities in the local communities, and considered and listed the positive factors found in the single parent situation. The study described in this <b>dissertation</b> <b>is</b> a <b>similar</b> quantitative descriptive study using the survey method.. The study provided {{a description of a}} sample of 107 White single parent families in Port Elizabeth drawn from a volunteer group. The description consisted primarily of statistical data presented as frequency and percentage distributions in tables which range the Port Elizabeth data next to that of the Pretoria study. This provided an easy means of comparison as well as some indication of what the national data might look like if such were available. The investigation included the widowed, divorced, separated and unmarried / single parents, as well as, the legal adoption of children by a single (never-married) person. A questionnaire, similar to the. one used in Pretoria, was constructed using both structured categories and' explorative questions. These categories and questions were also incorporated into the interviews and interview schedules done· by the researcher and used for comparative analysis tabulations. The study was spatially confined to the magisterial district of Port Elizabeth and represents an exploratory study highlighting the socioeconomic problems facing the single parent family...|$|R

40|$|Making {{high quality}} and {{reliable}} software systems remains a dicult problem. One approach {{to address this}} problem is automated verication which attempts to demonstrate algorithmically that a software sys-tem meets its specication. However, verication of software systems is not easy: such systems are often modeled using abstractions of innite structures such as unbounded integers, innite memory for allocation, unbounded space for call stack, unrestricted queue sizes and so on. It can be shown that for most classes of such systems, the verication problem is actually undecidable (there exists no algorithm which will always give the correct answer for arbitrary inputs). In spite of this negative theoretical result, techniques have been developed which are successful on some practical examples although they are not guaranteed to always work. This <b>dissertation</b> <b>is</b> in a <b>similar</b> spirit and develops a new paradigm for automated verication of large or innite state systems. We observe that even if the state space of a system is innite, for practi-cal examples, the set of reachable states (or other xpoints needed for verication) is often expressible in a simple representation. Based on this observation, we propose an entirely new approach to verication: the idea is to use techniques from computational learning theory to identify the reachable states (or other xpoints) and then verify the property of interest. To use learning techniques, we solve key problems o...|$|R
