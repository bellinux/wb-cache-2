To support {{battery powered}} mobile {{broadband}} wireless ac-cess devices efficiently, IEEE 802. 16 e defines a <b>sleep</b> <b>mode</b> operation for conserving {{the power of}} mobile terminals.

The model describes the behavior of the mobile stations working in <b>sleep</b> <b>mode.</b> In particu-lar, the service process is designed as a discrete PH model. By means of the mathematic tools of PH theory we then derive the closed-form ex-pressions of the mean sojourn time of packets and power consumption. Comparison with simulation results shows that the model provides an accurate prediction of the system performance. Furthermore, we propose a simple utility function to quantify the efficiency of <b>sleep</b> <b>mode</b> opera-tion which takes the joint effect of sojourn time and power saving into account. This function allows mobile stations to decide when to enable <b>sleep</b> <b>mode</b> operation for power saving. ...|$|R
