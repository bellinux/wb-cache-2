40|$|There is {{an urgent}} need to reduce {{reliance}} on <b>hypodermic</b> <b>injections</b> for many protein-based therapies. Alternative approaches include developing controlled release formulations, which reduce dosing frequencies, and utilizing alternative delivery devices, such as microneedles. This thesis explores the development of controlled release microparticles made of poly(lactic-co¬-glycolic acid) (PLGA) that encapsulate stable/active proteins. These microparticles are then delivered via novel microneedle patches. This work has great implications for improving the utility and coverage of protein-based vaccines. PLGA microparticles are loaded with protein through a novel approach termed active self-healing encapsulation (ASE). This method loads proteins after microparticle fabrication, thus preventing protein exposure {{to a variety of}} stresses. ASE utilizes a protein trapping agent (Alhydrogel), along with the self-healing of microparticle surface pores to sequester and trap proteins inside the microparticles. The self-healing phenomenon was explored in detail, and was determined to be a viscoelastic response of the polymer to high surface tension when above the glass-transition temperature (Tg). The healing kinetics followed expected Williams-Landel-Ferry behavior, and Arrhenius plots generated activation energies consistent with polymeric creep. A mathematical model to predict healing times is also presented. The ASE technique afforded high loading (1. 64 % w/w) and encapsulation efficiencies up to 91 % for the model protein Ovalbumin. In vitro controlled release was shown to be biphasic, with an initial release of soluble protein followed by a delayed release of Alhydrogel-complexed protein over the course of two months. Furthermore, a bulk batch of microparticles can be used to load many different proteins without needing to reformulate unique batches. A process was also designed to deliver protein-loaded microparticles via a microneedle patch. Microneedle patches can be easily self-applied, are easy to store/dispose, and are generally preferred by patients over traditional hypodermic needles. These patches, made of a dissolvable material, successfully delivered microparticles intradermally where they began antigen release. In animal models these patches generated a robust immune response that was as good as or better than conventional administration techniques.

40|$|Aim : {{to assess}} {{efficacy}} {{and safety of}} <b>hypodermic</b> methotrexate <b>injections</b> in children aged from 1, 5 to 16 years old with juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) without extra-articular manifestations. Patients and methods : the results of treatment of 104 patients with JIA without systemic manifestations (61 girls and 43 boys) aged 5, 0 (1, 5 – 16) years old being followed-up in the rheumatology department of FSFI «SCCH» of RAMS were analyzed. The mean duration of the disease {{at the moment of}} methotrexate first administration was 6 months. Efficacy of methotrexate therapy was assessed according to the pediatric criteria for improvement of the American College of Rheumatology. The percentage of non-active stage and medicinal remission achievement were considered to be the target characteristics of therapy efficacy. Results : 61 patients (59 %) were maintained in the study during 1 year. In 12 months of treatment remission according to C. Wallace criteria was induced in 39 of 104 (38 %) children. In 22 (21 %) of patients who failed to achieve remission in 1 year of treatment, 70 % improvement was observed. Side effects were found in 45 (43 %) of children: mild and moderate — in 33 (32 %), severe — in 12 (12 %) of patients. In 9 patients methotrexate was withdrawn due to intolerance of the drug.

40|$|Background: The {{delivery}} of drugs through dermal layers known as transdermal drug delivery {{is one of}} the important contributions in medical practice. It represents an alternative to oral drug delivery and is poised to provide a substitute to <b>hypodermic</b> <b>injections</b> too. The diffusion of drug from the source to the target site is therefore an important issue to address. Aim: This paper is an attempt to establish a mathematical model for the diffusion of drugs through the transdermal drug delivery system. The model identifies the pattern of drug diffusion in human body and its effective absorption rates at various compartments of skin and sub-cutaneous tissues. Methods: The finite element method has been used to obtain the solution of the mass diffusion equation with appropriate boundary conditions. The tissue absorption rate of drug has been taken as the decreasing function of drug concentration from the skin surface towards the target site. The concentration at nodal points has been calculated which in turn determines the drug absorption at various layers. Conclusion: The drug concentration at the nodal points of different dermal layers has been computed and the graphs were plotted between drug concentration and thickness of dermal layers using MATLAB software. It has been observed that due to dense network of connective tissues in dermal and sub-dermal parts, the drug absorption is maximum as compared to cutaneous tissues...|$|R

The most difficult to deliver in this way are hydrophilic drugs. The aquatic phylum Cnidaria, which includes sea anemones, corals, jellyfish and hydra, is one of the most ancient multicellular phyla that possess stinging cells containing organelles (cnidocysts), comprising a sophisticated injection system. The apparatus is folded within collagenous microcapsules and upon activation injects a thin tubule that immediately penetrates the prey and delivers its contents. Here we show that this natural microscopic injection system can be adapted for systemic transdermal drug delivery once it is isolated from the cells and uploaded with the drug. Using a topically applied gel containing isolated natural sea anemone injectors and the muscarinic receptor antagonist scopolamine, we found that the formulated injectors could penetrate porcine skin and immediately deliver this hydrophilic drug. An in-vivo study in pigs demonstrated, for the first time, rapid systemic delivery of scopolamine, with T(max) of 30 minutes and C(max) 5 times higher than in controls treated topically with a scopolamine-containing gel without cnidocysts.

To enable controllable drug infusion and still maintain an unobtrusive and easy-to-use, patch-like design, the system includes a small active dispenser mechanism. The dispenser is based on a novel thermal actuator consisting of highly expandable microspheres. When actuated, the microspheres expand into a liquid reservoir and, subsequently, dispense stored liquid through outlet holes. The microneedles are fabricated in monocrystalline silicon by Deep Reactive Ion Etching. The needles are organized in arrays situated on a chip. To allow active delivery, the microneedles are hollow with the needle bore-opening located {{on the side of the}} needle. This way, the needle can have a sharp and well-defined needle tip. A sharp needle is a further requirement to achieve microneedle insertion into skin by hand. The thesis presents fabrication and evaluation of both the microneedle structure and the transdermal patch as such. Issues such as penetration reliability, liquid delivery into the skin and microneedle packaging are discussed. The microneedle patch was also tested and studied in vivo for insulin delivery. Results show that intradermal administration with microneedles give rise to similar insulin concentration as standard subcutaneous delivery with the same dose rate. QC 2010062...|$|R

40|$|Reuse of {{improperly}} sterilized steel hypodermic needles is {{a leading}} factor in cross infection of diseases between people in specific groups such as patients in developing countries and drug addicts. Disablement after single use is a potential strategy to reduce disease spreading, but disablement of expensive steel needles requires specialized equipment and is a concern in developing countries. Needles made using micromolded polymer are {{examined in this study}} as a potential replacement for steel needles. Instead of using specialized tip cutting instruments for steel needles, soft polymer needles can be easily disabled. Material cost and processing temperature of polymer needles are lower than steel. However, further reduction of cost is limited due to the low production rate in conventional micro-molding. In this study, we analyzed the flow behavior of polymer in the micro-molding process using FEM and determined that runner length limits the production throughput. On the basis of the FEM results, we developed a high throughput, hot embossing production method with multi-parallel material delivery. This process allows multiple molding of needles in a single operation. Standard 22 gauge acetal polymer needles were successfully fabricated. Puncture and buckling tests were conducted to examine the mechanical behavior of the polymer needles on silicone rubber. The puncture load ranged between 1 – 1. 5 N. While this puncture load is higher than that required for commercial steel needles, it is below the critical buckling load of the polymer needles and is within the range of load suited for human administration. We conducted puncture tests using polymer needles and achieved 8 mm needle penetration in silicone rubber, which is the working range of <b>hypodermic</b> <b>injections.</b> The successful development of a high throughput fabrication method is demonstrated in this study and polymeric needles are shown to be suitable for use as a potentially low cost replacement for steel needles...|$|R
40|$|Vaccination {{remains the}} most {{important}} approach to offering protection from infectious diseases. However, using needles and syringes for vaccine administration {{continues to be a}} matter of concern, especially in developing countries. Re-use of needles, needle stick injuries and improper disposal of needles in these regions of the world increase the risk of spreading blood-borne pathogens among health care workers, patients and the wider community. The concerns about the safe vaccination practice have led to an intensive effort to develop safe delivery methods for vaccines and replace <b>hypodermic</b> <b>injections.</b> The opportunity to develop a safe and effective method of vaccination using a minimally invasive method is becoming real. The most promising approaches is microneedle (MN) array which has proven to be a safe and cost effective method for vaccination. The current thesis was focus on dissolvable MNs fabricated from 20 %w/w poly(methyl vinyl ether/maleic acid) loaded with a model antigen, ovalbumin (OVA). Various experiments were carried out during this thesis to investigate the feasibility and efficacy of using MNs for vaccine delivery. The in vitro studies showed that MNs loaded with OVA were strong enough to avoid breaking under high compression force. The integrity of the primary and secondary structure of OVA loaded into MN arrays successfully ensured. Further, MNs enhanced the release of OVA into the skin compared to passive permeation. In in vivo studies, the OVA released from the MNs' matrix upon insertion into mouse skin targeted dendrite cells (DCs). This thesis showed that av A was engulfed by DCs, processed and migrated to the lymph nodes. Consequently, the processed antigen encountered naive T cells, which led to initiation of robust humoral and cellular immune responses indicated by production of IgG, IgG 1, IgG 2 a, IFN-γ and IL- 4. Interestingly, the PMVE/MA copolymer used to fabricate MNs seems to have adjuvant effects, indicated by the higher IgG level of mice immunized using MNs fabricated from PMVE/MA loaded with OVA compared with MNs fabricated from PMVE/MA and loaded with OVA plus adjuvant imiquimod.

Those with hydrocarbon groups of low molecular weight have been found the most toxio, and the only cases of poisoning recorded in man have been due to methyl derivatives. Frankland and Duppa (1863) used di-methyl mercury in the course of some research work undertaken at St. Bartholomew's Hospital to determine the valency of metals and metallic compounds, and two laboratory techni-cians engaged in this work developed symptoms of poisoning and died (Edwards, 1865, 1866). One of them was a German aged 30 years, who had been exposed to di-methyl mercury for three months. He complained of numbness of the hands, deafness, poor vision, and sore gums. He was found to be slow and dull in manner, unsteady in gait, and unable to stand without support. There was no motor palsy, and the fundi were normal. Within a week he became rapidly worse, restless, unable to answer questions, inconti-nent of urine, and comatose. He died two weeks after the onset of his symptoms. A second technician, aged 23 years, had worked in the laboratory for twelve months and had handled di-methyl mercury three months previously for a period of two weeks only. A month after this exposure he complained of sore gums, salivation, numbness of the feet, hands, and tongue, deafness, and dimness of vision. He answered questions only very slowly and with indistinct speech. There was ataxia, but no weakness of the upper limbs. Three weeks later he had difficulty in swallowing, was unable to speak, had incontinence of urine and faeces, and was often restless and violent. He remained in a confused state, and died of pneumonia twelve months after the onset of his symptoms.
