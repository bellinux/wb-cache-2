5|$|After {{suffering}} {{chest pains}} while filming The Drew Carey Show in August 2001, Carey {{went to the}} hospital, where he underwent a coronary angioplasty. Although his weight was a comedic topic throughout his sitcom and improv shows, in 2010 he began a <b>diet</b> <b>and</b> <b>exercise</b> plan, resulting in an extensive weight loss (similar to former TPIR announcer Rod Roddy). He also claimed that he cured his Type 2 diabetes.|$|E
5|$|Metformin, marketed {{under the}} trade name Glucophage among others, is the {{first-line}} medication {{for the treatment}} of type 2 diabetes, After ten years, the incidence of diabetes was 34% lower in the group of participants given <b>diet</b> <b>and</b> <b>exercise</b> and 18% lower in those given metformin. It is unclear whether metformin slowed down the progression of prediabetes to diabetes (true preventive effect), or the decrease of diabetes in the treated population was simply due to its glucose-lowering action (treatment effect).|$|E
5|$|In the 1923 season, {{under the}} eye of the county's coach, James Iremonger, Larwood {{concentrated}} on building his physique and on learning bowling skills. He grew a few inches in height, although he remained short for a fast bowler, and under Iremonger's regime of <b>diet</b> <b>and</b> <b>exercise</b> he gained weight. Besides his physical development, he learned by incessant practice various bowling arts, among them accuracy in line and length, variation of pace and grip, and deviating the ball in the air to produce swing. That year he played intermittently for the county's Second XI, and in a match against Lancashire Seconds took 8 wickets for 44 runs.|$|E

40|$|This study {{explored}} the moderating effects of body dissatisfaction (BD) on {{the relationships between}} various constructs of control and weight restricting and control behaviours (WRCBs). Participants were 167 female undergraduates who completed self-report measures of control, BD and WRCBs. It was found that higher {{external locus of control}} (LOC) was related to less <b>dieting</b> <b>and</b> <b>exercise</b> <b>and</b> that LOC was unrelated to purging. In addition, higher levels of general self-control were found to be related to higher levels of purging when BD was high but not low, and higher general self-control was associated with greater <b>dieting</b> <b>and</b> <b>exercise</b> behaviour. Finally, higher 2 ̆ 7 self-control as self-esteem 2 ̆ 7 was strongly associated with greater <b>dieting</b> <b>and</b> <b>exercise</b> behaviour at both high and low levels of BD, whilst 2 ̆ 7 self-control as self-esteem 2 ̆ 7 was related to purging only when BD was high. The results of this research suggest that different constructs of control have differential effects on WRCBs. The clinical implications of the findings are discussed...|$|R
50|$|After a {{stay at the}} St. Luke’s Hospital in New York City, {{he dropped}} his weight from 411 kgto 90 kg and waist size from 290 cm to 91 cm in 19 months {{with the help of}} the <b>dieting</b> <b>and</b> <b>exercise</b> coach Richard Simmons and was {{recorded}} in the Guinness Book of World Records for the highest recorded weight loss in 1990.

40|$|Objective—To {{investigate}} social comparison {{processes as}} a potential mechanism by which social networks impact young women's weight control thoughts and behaviors and to examine whether social comparisons with close social ties (i. e. friends) have a greater influence on weight control outcomes relative to more emotionally distant ties. Design and Methods—Using Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA) overweight young adult women (N= 46; M age = 19; M BMI = 29) reported the nature and effects of weight-focused social comparisons on <b>dieting</b> <b>and</b> <b>exercising</b> intentions <b>and</b> behaviors during their daily routine. Results—Relative to social comparisons to targets of the same weight, weight-focused comparisons to both thinner and heavier individuals led to increased thoughts of <b>dieting</b> <b>and</b> <b>exercising.</b> Moreover, comparisons to thinner targets also increased the likelihood of engaging in actual <b>dieting</b> <b>and</b> <b>exercising</b> behavior. Weight comparisons to friends amplified these effects. Conclusions—Weight-focused social comparisons may be one mechanism by which social networks impact weight control thoughts and behaviors. Obesity interventions with young adults may achieve better outcomes by harnessing social comparison processes in treatment...|$|R

25|$|Puberty is {{a period}} of several years in which rapid {{physical}} growth and psychological changes occur, culminating in sexual maturity. The average age of onset of puberty is at 11 for girls and 12 for boys. Every person's individual timetable for puberty is influenced primarily by heredity, although environmental factors, such as <b>diet</b> <b>and</b> <b>exercise,</b> also exert some influences. These factors can also contribute to precocious and delayed puberty.|$|E
25|$|Life {{expectancy}} is {{also likely}} to be affected by exposure to high levels of highway air pollution or industrial air pollution. This is one way that occupation can have a major effect on life expectancy. Coal miners (and in prior generations, asbestos cutters) often have lower life expediencies than average life expediencies. Other factors affecting an individual's life expectancy are genetic disorders, drug use, tobacco smoking, excessive alcohol consumption, obesity, access to health care, <b>diet</b> <b>and</b> <b>exercise.</b>|$|E
25|$|The American Eskimo is a {{hardy breed}} {{with an average}} life span of 12–15 years. This breed tends to become {{overweight}} easily, so proper <b>diet</b> <b>and</b> <b>exercise</b> is needed to maintain an overall well being. Health testing should be performed by all responsible breeders and anyone purchasing a puppy {{should be aware of}} the genetic problems which have been found in some individuals of the breed, such as PRA (Progressive Retinal Atrophy), luxating patella, and hip dysplasia). None of these problems are common and the breed is generally very healthy. In addition to the rarer problems mentioned, the breed can have a tendency towards allergies and most commonly, tear-staining. This breed also is known in some cases to have dental issues.|$|E

40|$|In {{the past}} decade, {{research}} {{has begun to}} focus not only on <b>dieting</b> <b>and</b> <b>exercise</b> to lose weight, but <b>dieting</b> <b>and</b> <b>exercise</b> to gain muscle mass (drive for muscularity; DFM). While research has established that men tend to exhibit greater levels of DFM than women, little research has examined the influence of athletic status on drive for muscularity in male and female college students. The present study surveyed 290 student participants (30 female athletes, 38 male athletes, 139 female non-athletes, 82 male non-athletes and asked them about their DFM as well as factors known to relate to DFM. As expected, men and athletes exhibited higher levels of DFM than did women and non-athletes; however different variables predicted DFM in the four groups. Implications for prevention and treatment of DFM are discussed. Research concerning the influence of participation in athletes on disordered eating <b>and</b> <b>exercise</b> behaviors is controversial. Some research indicates that athletes are more vulnerable to developing disordered eating <b>and</b> <b>exercise</b> behaviors than are non-athletes (Engel et al. ...|$|R

25|$|Fasting insulin {{level or}} GTT with insulin levels (also called IGTT). Elevated insulin levels {{have been helpful}} to predict {{response}} to medication and may indicate women needing higher dosages of metformin {{or the use of}} a second medication to significantly lower insulin levels. Elevated blood sugar and insulin values do not predict who responds to an insulin-lowering medication, low-glycemic <b>diet,</b> <b>and</b> <b>exercise.</b> Many women with normal levels may benefit from combination therapy. A hypoglycemic response in which the two-hour insulin level is higher and the blood sugar lower than fasting is consistent with insulin resistance. A mathematical derivation known as the HOMAI, calculated from the fasting values in glucose and insulin concentrations, allows a direct and moderately accurate measure of insulin sensitivity (glucose-level x insulin-level/22.5).|$|E
25|$|Emi is an energetic, extroverted blonde {{girl with}} twintails and forest-green eyes. She has {{prosthetic}} legs, having had her original legs amputated below the knees {{as a result}} of a car accident. Despite her disability, she still has more than enough lower body strength to walk, and in fact she is a successful track runner. She values good <b>diet</b> <b>and</b> <b>exercise,</b> and is on friendly terms with the head nurse of Yamaku; she promises to keep tabs on Hisao's exercise in exchange for having him as a running partner. Indeed, she meets Hisao by literally running into him in the hallway, and ironically endangers his heart on more than one occasion. Hisao feels guilty whenever she pouts, equating her expression to that of a sad puppy. Emi is Rin's friend and hall mate due to both having extremely passionate vocations and complementary disabilities. However, she has trouble getting emotionally close to people, because she is afraid of losing people important to her.|$|E
25|$|With {{the growth}} of the {{wellness}} industry in recent years, social media platforms have witnessed an assortment of fitness influencers and trends. Followers obsessively pursue these <b>diet</b> <b>and</b> <b>exercise</b> regimes posted as a way to remain healthy, while the influencers hope it generates body positivity in return. Yet, these bloggers and companies have received numerous criticism because the “drive for “wellness” and “clean eating” has become stealthy covers for more dieting and deprivation”. Likewise, reports have also shown that the messages delivered by “fitspiration” websites are sometimes identical to the “thinspiration” or pro-anorexia types. This is evident through “language inducing guilt about weight or the body, and promoted dieting”. Although the wellness trend may not lead to eating disorders, the marketing of restrictive diets to young women as a form of self care could potentially cause “increasingly disordered eating” , whereby they became more concerned with ingredients and limited certain types of food. This illness is better known as Orthorexia; which is the obsession with the right and wrong types of food.|$|E
