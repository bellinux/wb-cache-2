5|$|Despite {{economic}} growth during recent decades, India continues to face socio-economic challenges. In 2006, India contained {{the largest number}} of people living below the World Bank's international poverty line of US$1.25 per day, the proportion having decreased from 60% in 1981 to 42% in 2005; under its later revised poverty line, it was 21% in 2011. 30.7% of India's {{children under the age of}} five are underweight. According to a Food and Agriculture Organization report in 2015, 15% of the population is undernourished. The Mid-Day Meal Scheme attempts to lower these rates. Since 1991, economic inequality between India's states has consistently grown: the per-capita net state domestic product of the richest states in 2007 was 3.2 times that of the poorest. Corruption in India <b>is</b> <b>perceived</b> <b>to</b> have increased significantly, with one report estimating the illegal capital flows since independence to be US$462 billion.|$|E

The Government is generally {{perceived to be}} competent in managing the country's economy, and largely free from political corruption. Transparency International's 2010 Corruption Perceptions Index, which compares countries according to {{the degree to which}} corruption <b>is</b> <b>perceived</b> <b>to</b> exist among public officials and politicians, ranked Singapore in joint first place with Denmark and New Zealand out of 178 countries. In addition, Singapore was second only to New Zealand in the Asia-Pacific region. On the other hand, the Government has been criticized for using unfair election tactics, such as discouraging voting for opposition parties in the 2006 general election by stating that wards that elect opposition candidates will receive state-subsidized improvements to public housing only after all PAP-held wards have been attended to. It has also been accused of violating freedom of speech through Ministers bringing defamation suits against opposition politicians, and by restricting the circulation of foreign newspapers deemed to have engaged in domestic politics.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{explores the}} {{perceived}} forms and drivers of sexual and gender based violence in post conflict settings with focus on Northern Uganda. It applied qualitative approaches primarily using in-depth interviews, focus group discussions and key informant interviews. Study findings revealed that although {{all forms of}} violence <b>are</b> <b>perceived</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> prevalent, physical and emotional violence <b>were</b> <b>perceived</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> the most occurring. Men <b>were</b> <b>perceived</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> the main perpetrators of violence. However, there were cases of men who reported to experience violence from women. Few men reported violence to authorities because it <b>was</b> <b>perceived</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> stigmatizing; such men would <b>be</b> <b>perceived</b> as weak in a patriarchal society that <b>perceives</b> ideal men <b>to</b> <b>be</b> strong and less susceptible to physical, emotional and sexual abuse. Early marriages are a major form of gender based violence which <b>was</b> <b>perceived</b> as normal {{in a number of}} communities despite the evidence that it contributes to negative social and reproductive health outcomes. Sexual violence cases in form of rape, defilement as well as incest <b>were</b> <b>perceived</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> on the rise in the sub-region.
