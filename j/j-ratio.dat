40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{influence}} of electromagnetic effects on the two stream instability in a relativistic electron beam propagating through a collisionless plasma channel. The analysis is carried out {{within the framework of}} a macroscopic cold fluid model in which beam and plasma fluid element is in a laminar flow. Axisymmetric electromagnetic stability properties are calculated for the case in which the equilibrium beam and plasma density profiles are rectangular. Consistent with the two stream instability, the perturbed fields are assumed to be the transverse magnetic mode. The resulting eigenvalue equation for the perturbed axial electric field 6 Ez is solved to give a closed algebraic dispersion relation for the croplex eigenfrequency w. This dispersion relation is solved and it is shown that the electromagnetic effects have a strong stabilizing influence for a relativistic electron beam with Yb>> 1, where yb-is the relativistic mass [...] ., [...] <b>j-ratio</b> of beam electrons. For example, the critical beam current for instability is proportional to the electromagnetic current enhancement factor S- (yb + 1) / 2. Thus, the critical current from the electromagnetic calculation increases more drastically with the beam energy than that from the electrostatic approximation. - 1 -i' %...|$|E
40|$|The {{influence}} of varying contents of ferric and ferrous iron on the mineral assemblages de-veloped in regionally metamorphosed pelitic gneisses from Glen Clova, Angus, is considered {{on the basis}} of petrographic, chemical, and X-ray data. The rocks described are essentially quartz-oligoclase-muscovite-biotite-garnet-kyanite-oxide minerals gneisses, with oxidation /, 2 F e 2 O 3 x l 0 0 ṙ. i * • • _ •, • <b>j-ratios</b> = mol [...] ,-. _ o-. 1 varying from 6 to 75; rocks of widely varying oxidation ratio 2 re 2 (J 3 +reU/ may be found intimately interbedded. Increasing oxidation ratios in these rocks are accompanied by increasing amounts of muscovite and iron oxides, and decreasing amounts of biotite and garnet. The relationship between interbedded layers of varying oxygen content may be represented by the equation Fe++ eastonite (biotite) +almandine+O = muscovite+iron oxides+quartz. However, the magnesium content of the rocks is contained almost exclusively in biotite, and the manganese content in garnet. Diminishing amounts of these minerals with increasing roc...|$|R
