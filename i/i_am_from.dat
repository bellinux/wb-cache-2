500|$|On New Years Day 2002, Hamasaki {{released}} her fourth studio album <b>I</b> <b>Am...</b> <b>from</b> Avex Trax. The album saw {{a new direction}} for Hamasaki, whose first three studio albums was dominated by a pop rock sound, and lyrics based on loneliness, confusion, sadness, relationships and individualism. The result was not well-received from critics, who felt the effort was [...] "unassuming", particularly on her debut release A Song for ×× (1999). After being affected emotionally by the September 11 attacks, Hamasaki quickly changed the album's planned musical direction, and updated the album cover to support world peace. This effort was Hamasaki's first album to focus on lighter themes, such as faith, humanity and serenity. I Am... became a success and sold over 2.3 million copies in Japan, and was certified triple million by the RIAJ.|$|E
500|$|Cyrus' first live {{performance}} of [...] "Party in the U.S.A." [...] at the Teen Choice Awards held on August 10, 2009. Clothed by {{a tank top}} that revealed a portion of her bra, black hot pants, and leather boots, Cyrus and backup dancers appeared from a trailer. Midway through the performance, Cyrus danced atop an ice cream pushcart with a pole (which was suggested to be a dance pole by numerous critics) for approximately forty seconds. Cyrus described the performance to be about her heritage: [...] " [...] performance tonight is funny, but I {{wanted it to be}} about [...] I'm like, 'This is to represent where <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>from.</b> I'm so proud of it.' All the girls trying to be Hollywood and stuff with their big glasses, me shooing them away." [...] The performance was met with a media uproar in regards to her dancing being too suggestive and sexual for a teen-oriented event, which caused The Walt Disney Company to issue a statement distancing themselves from the performance. Ian Drew, senior editor of Us Weekly said, [...] "She already has this risque image, so it really wasn't much of a stretch. That's how Britney [...] took off. She was the good girl gone bad, and it looks to be working for Miley as well." [...] Other contemporary critics used negative comparisons to Spears, but Cyrus welcomed the comparisons via a post on her official Twitter account. Child psychologist Wendi Fischer told Newsday: Cyrus was communicating to her fans that it is acceptable to pole dance, which, according to Fischer, was unacceptable. [...] "Miley's only 16. Why is she rushing it?", she concluded. Other critics defended Cyrus. Apryl Duncan of About.com said viewers should have fixated on her accomplishments that night, winning six awards, rather than the sexuality of the performance. Following the backlash of the performance, Cyrus replaced the ice cream pushcart with a luggage cart while touring.|$|E

2500|$|Mario Javier Fernandez-Vega is a Puerto Rican {{forester}} {{who uses}} silvicultural techniques. Fernandez is currently developing cutting edge forestry methods {{known as the}} [...] "Borincano Model". The model capitalizes on the diversity of ecological niches in Puerto Rican forests and native disturbance regimes to formulate practices uniquely suited to the forests of the territory. About his model Fernandez {{has been known to}} comment, [...] "Soy de aquí como el coquí" [...] <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>from</b> here just like the coqui, a common patriotic axiom that is used to demonstrate their native ties to the island. It should be noted, although incorrect, many believe that the Coqui and its unique vocalizations are indigenous to the island of Puerto Rico. In fact however, there are thriving populations of Coquis that, like the people of Puerto Rico, have been transported to the island of Hawaii. Sadly, the Coqui a source of pride to its people, is viewed as an ecological menace in Hawaii where its song of co kee co kee is found to be an irritant by many. Needless to say that efforts to eradicate its presence in Hawaii is not a popular issue among Puerto Ricans.|$|E
