5|$|Procellariids {{begin to}} attend their nesting colony around one month prior to laying. Males will arrive first and attend the colony more {{frequently}} than females, partly {{in order to protect}} a site or burrow from potential competitors. Prior to laying there is a period known as the pre-laying exodus in which both the male and female are away from the colony, building up reserves in order to lay and undertake the first <b>incubation</b> stint respectively. This pre-laying exodus can vary in length from 9 days (as in the Cape petrel) to around 50 days in Atlantic petrels. All procellariids lay one egg per pair per breeding season, in common {{with the rest of the}} Procellariiformes. The egg is large compared to that of other birds, weighing 6–24% of the female's weight. Immediately after laying the female goes back to sea to feed while the male takes over <b>incubation.</b> <b>Incubation</b> duties are shared by both sexes in shifts that vary in length between species, individuals and even the stage of <b>incubation.</b> The longest recorded shift was 29 days by a Murphy's petrel from Henderson Island; the typical length of a gadfly petrel stint is between 13 and 19 days. Fulmarine petrels, shearwaters and prions tend to have shorter stints, averaging between 3 and 13 days. <b>Incubation</b> takes a long time, from 40 days for the smaller species (such as prions) to around 55 days for the larger species. The <b>incubation</b> period is longer if eggs are abandoned temporarily; procellariid eggs are resistant to chilling and can still hatch after being left unattended for a few days.|$|E

Despite this important biogeochemical role, marine and estuarine microorganisms that consume C 1 compounds are poorly characterized. In this study, we investigated the diversity of active methylotrophs and methanotrophs in sediment from the Colne Estuary (Brightlingsea, UK). Aerobic surface sediment samples were examined for the presence of C 1 -utilizing communities using DNA stable-isotope probing (DNA-SIP) with 13 C-labelled methane, methanol and monomethylamine. Active methylotrophic bacteria were confirmed after DNA-SIP and denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis analyses. Clone libraries of 16 S rRNA gene amplicons revealed the presence of methylotrophic bacteria affiliated with Methylophaga spp. in methanol and monomethylamine <b>incubations.</b> The addition of marine ammonium mineral salts medium to the microcosms increased the rate of substrate metabolism in DNA-SIP <b>incubations,</b> although nutrient addition did not affect the active populations contributing 13 C-labelled DNA. The 13 CH 4 SIP <b>incubations</b> indicated the predominant activity of type I methanotrophs and microarray hybridization of amplified particulate methane monooxygenase (pmoA) genes confirmed the role of type Ia methanotrophs in SIP <b>incubations.</b> Type II methanotrophs (i. e.

5|$|Bird predators may seize {{anywhere}} from 7% to 75% of the progeny in a breeding colony.

Egg predation rates of the American white ibis decline with nest age owing to increased nest attentiveness by the parents, especially during the last week of <b>incubation.</b> High nest densities and reduced synchrony increase egg predation rates because of the increased opportunities afforded by the longer <b>incubation</b> times, as well as the greater availability of nests available for predation.|$|E

5|$|Epidemiology is used {{to break}} the chain of {{infection}} in populations during outbreaks of viral diseases. Control measures are used {{that are based on}} knowledge of how the virus is transmitted. It is important to find the source, or sources, of the outbreak and to identify the virus. Once the virus has been identified, the chain of transmission can sometimes be broken by vaccines. When vaccines are not available, sanitation and disinfection can be effective. Often, infected people are isolated {{from the rest of the}} community, and those that have been exposed to the virus are placed in quarantine. To control the outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease in cattle in Britain in 2001, thousands of cattle were slaughtered. Most viral infections of humans and other animals have <b>incubation</b> periods during which the infection causes no signs or symptoms. <b>Incubation</b> periods for viral diseases range from a few days to weeks, but are known for most infections. Somewhat overlapping, but mainly following the <b>incubation</b> period, there is a period of communicability — a time when an infected individual or animal is contagious and can infect another person or animal. This, too, is known for many viral infections, and knowledge of the length of both periods is important in the control of outbreaks. When outbreaks cause an unusually high proportion of cases in a population, community, or region, they are called epidemics. If outbreaks spread worldwide, they are called pandemics.|$|E

Accurate {{quantitative}} {{information on the}} fate of dietary protein in the rumen is central to modern metabolizable protein systems developed to improve the efficiency of nitrogen utilization in ruminants. An in vitro method was developed to estimate the rate of soluble rapeseed meal (Brassica rapa L.) protein (SRMP) degradation. Unlabeled and (15) N-labeled solvent-extracted rapeseed meal were incubated alone or as an equal mixture (125 mg of N/L) with buffered rumen contents and a mixture of carbohydrates formulated to provide a constant source of fermentable energy during the course of all <b>incubations.</b> <b>Incubations</b> were made over 0. 33, 0. 67, 1. 0, 1. 5, 2. 0, 2. 5, 3. 0, 4. 0, 6. 0, 8. 0, and 10. 0 h. Enrichment of (14) N and (15) N isotopes in total N of ammonia (AN), soluble nonammonia (SNAN), and insoluble (ISN) fractions liberated during <b>incubations</b> with test proteins was determined. A model with 4 pools that accounted for both intracellular and extracellular N transformations was used to estimate the rate of SRMP degradation. Parameter values used in the model were adjusted based on the size of A(14) N, A(15) N, SNA(14) N, SNA(15) N, IS(14) N, and IS(15) N pools, measured at different time points during <b>incubations</b> with buffered rumen fluid.
