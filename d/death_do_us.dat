500|$|Dot's second {{significant}} romance {{was built}} upon by scriptwriters in 2000 on {{the behest of}} producer John Yorke. Dot was paired romantically with pensioner Jim Branning, played by John Bardon and a slow courtship was featured, with Dot often shown to be outraged by Jim's advances, resulting in numerous rejections. Dot finally succumbed and accepted his marriage proposal in an episode that aired in November 2001; the scenes were filmed inside one of the carriages of the London Eye on the South Bank of the River Thames. Their wedding aired on 14 February 2002, Valentine's Day. The Guardian critic, Nancy Banks-Smith, described the wedding as [...] "uniquely uneventful [...] For Dot and Jim 'In sickness and health... till <b>death</b> <b>do</b> <b>us</b> part' seemed to carry more resonance than for most." ...|$|E

500|$|Criticism was {{directed}} {{at some of the}} character's aspects, and toward the introduction of the character. Jim Johnson-Smith, in American Science Fiction TV, uses an example of Ezri and Worf's concentration on their romantic relationship in the episode [...] "'Til <b>Death</b> <b>Do</b> <b>Us</b> Part" [...] instead of being more concerned with their capture by the Breen. Ezri was described as [...] "an ill-conceived idea that never really took off and has left many DS9 fans angry that a show favourite (Jadzia Dax) isn't around any more" [...] by the website Flickering Myth. The review on DVD Talk also stated [...] "With its large ensemble cast, DS9 could have gone on perfectly well without a replacement for Jadzia. Instead, we get a [...] "replacement Dax" [...] who turns out to be, hands down, the least interesting and most annoying character DS9 has been stuck with." ...|$|E

'Til <b>Death</b> <b>Do</b> <b>Us</b> Part", later shortened to Life After Death, Wallace {{was involved in a}} car accident that shattered his left leg and temporarily confined him to a wheelchair. The injury forced him to use a cane. He and Lil' Cease were arrested for smoking marijuana in public and had their car repossessed. Wallace chose a Chevrolet Lumina rental SUV as a substitute, despite [...] Lil' Cease's objections. The vehicle had brake problems before the accident but Wallace dismissed them. According to Lil' Cease, Wallace's leg was shattered when they hit a rail along with Lil's Cease's jaw. Wallace spent months in a hospital following the accident and had to complete therapy. Despite his hospitalization, he continued to work on the album.

500|$|Following Bad Blood, Raw {{commentator}} Jim Ross tried making amends between Shawn Michaels and Triple H {{by making}} them shake hands. As Michaels and Triple H extended their hands to shake, however, Kane came out and attacked Michaels, with Kane, in storyline, crushing Michaels' throat with a wedged chair. Michaels was then taken out in an ambulance for medical attention. Lita's pregnancy was scripted into a storyline. On the June 21 episode of Raw, it appeared that Lita's then-boyfriend, Matt Hardy was going to propose to Lita, having {{found out she was}} pregnant, but he was interrupted by Kane, who claimed to be the father of Lita's child. Two months later, it was revealed that Kane was, indeed, the father. At SummerSlam, the rivalry between Kane and Hardy intensified, when they were booked in a [...] "Till <b>Death</b> <b>Do</b> <b>Us</b> Part" [...] match, with the stipulation that Lita would be obliged to marry Kane should Hardy lose. Kane won the match, leading to he and a reluctant Lita marrying one another on an episode of Raw. On the August 30 episode of Raw, Kane revealed that Eric Bischoff's wedding gift to them was to name any match he wanted for at the September annual event, Unforgiven. Continuing with the scripted angle, Lita informed Kane that his opponent at the event was Shawn Michaels. At Unforgiven, Michaels defeated Kane in a no disqualification match.|$|E
500|$|When Madonna {{started work}} on her fourth studio album, Like a Prayer, she was already in an {{emotional}} state of mind, following her divorce with then-husband, Sean Penn, her thirtieth birthday, and unfavorable reviews for her acting endeavors. She had certain personal matters on her mind that she thought could be the musical direction of the album. While writing the songs for Like a Prayer, Madonna also acted in a Broadway production called Speed-the-Plow. In the play, she portrayed Karen, a secretary to a movie producer who bedded her on a bet with his friends. Karen later gets revenge, but is depicted as just as seedy and conniving as {{the men who had}} partaken in this bet and exploited her. Madonna was frustrated with the role and the negative reception, which she vented into her lyrics. The result was a set of three songs—"Till <b>Death</b> <b>Do</b> <b>Us</b> Part", [...] "Promise to Try" [...] and [...] "Oh Father"—where she sought to purge herself from her personal paranoia and demons. Written with producer Patrick Leonard, in [...] "Oh Father" [...] the singer wanted to revisit the pain and confusion that had characterized her relationship with her father. Generally accepted by critics and academics as a love letter to Tony Ciccone or as an indictment, Madonna never divulged her inspiration behind [...] "Oh Father", except saying that the song was about her father and a tribute to Simon & Garfunkel, her favorite band at that time. She added, [...] " [...] is what the listener thinks it is, all open to interpretation. I just wrote the song, it's up to others to interpret them to mean what they want them to mean." ...|$|E
500|$|Lita {{competed in}} the women's {{division}} throughout early 2004, winning a battle royal to become the number one contender for the Women's Championship on the April 5 episode of Raw. Victoria defeated Lita to retain the Women's Championship at Backlash on April 18. The next night on Raw, Lita was reunited with Matt Hardy when Hardy attacked Kane {{in an attempt to}} prevent him from harming Lita, beginning a new storyline involving the trio. In the following weeks, Kane began repeatedly assaulting Hardy and attempting to seduce Lita. During the course of the storyline, he kidnapped Lita and held her tied up backstage, and he persuaded Eric Bischoff to give her a title shot at Bad Blood on June 13, where she was defeated by Trish Stratus in a Fatal Four Way match that also included Gail Kim and defending champion Victoria. The next night on Raw, Lita revealed that she was pregnant. One week later, it appeared that Hardy was going to propose to Lita, but he was interrupted by Kane, who claimed to be the father of Lita's child. Two months later, it was revealed that Kane was, in fact, the father. Hardy and Kane feuded for several months, culminating in a [...] "Till <b>Death</b> <b>Do</b> <b>Us</b> Part" [...] match on August 15 at SummerSlam, with the stipulation that Lita would be obliged to marry the winner of the match. Kane won the match, leading to he and a reluctant Lita marrying one another on the August 23 episode of Raw. Despite being married to Kane, Lita thwarted him during his matches, constantly aiding his opponents. On the September 13 episode of Raw, Lita miscarried after Gene Snitsky struck Kane with a chair, resulting in him falling on Lita. The miscarriage led to Lita and Kane joining forces in order to take revenge on Snitsky.|$|E

A common marriage vow in Wicca is [...] "for as long as love lasts" [...] instead of the traditional Christian [...] "till <b>death</b> <b>do</b> <b>us</b> part".

2500|$|Originally titled [...] "State of Matrimony", {{the song}} Till <b>Death</b> <b>Do</b> <b>Us</b> Part" [...] {{talks about the}} violent {{dissolution}} of Madonna's marriage.

The next song, [...] "Promise to Try" [...] talks {{about the death of}} Madonna's mother. In one part of the song, she specifically asks [...] "Does she hear my voice in the night when I call?". Later, an adult seems to admonish a child with the lines, [...] "Little girl, don't you forget her face/Don't let memory play games with your mind/She's a faded smile frozen in time".|$|E

[...] The band released Till <b>Death</b> <b>Do</b> <b>Us</b> Part on March 23, 2004. The album saw the band experiment with reggae especially on the lead single [...] "What's Your Number".

2500|$|Although Mark {{was desperate}} for Tricia to have chemotherapy, she proved reluctant, {{deciding}} that her previous cycles {{had been too}} grueling. Terrified that he might lose her, Mark proposed that they remarry. [...] Initially, Tricia turned him down, with Sharon Maughan explaining: [...] "She doesn't like the thought of saying 'til <b>death</b> <b>do</b> <b>us</b> part', knowing she's dying. Tricia's still in denial and doesn't want to admit she hasn't got long. She feels everything is accelerating out of her control." [...] However, following an incident which saw the two characters taken hostage at work, Tricia rethought her decision. [...] "It scares her and makes her realise that Mark's always been there for her; he offers a safe place away from the crazy world that's out there". The two remarried in the hospital peace garden in episode [...] "Now or Never", with Chrissie and colleague Lola Griffin as witnesses. Tricia then underwent experimental surgery to excise her cancer, and she and Mark were delighted when it {{appeared to have been}} successful. [...] They planned a second honeymoon in New York City, however, en route to the airport were involved in a road traffic accident. Tricia suffered serious injuries, and although she was stabilized in theatre by Diane Lloyd, her condition soon thereafter worsened, leaving Mark and Chrissie conflicted over how to continue with her treatment. [...] Maughan explained: [...] "Mark and Chrissie have completely opposing views. He's desperate to do anything he can and wants to put Tricia on a life support machine, but Chrissie is saying 'Stop, she's never going to be the same'."

2500|$|Kane and Matt Hardy faced {{one another}} in a [...] "Till <b>Death</b> <b>Do</b> <b>Us</b> Part" [...] match at SummerSlam, with Lita obliged to wed the victor. Kane {{defeated}} Hardy, and [...] "married" [...] Lita on the August 23 episode of Raw. Although he was attacked by Hardy during the ceremony, he gained the upper hand and ultimately chokeslammed Hardy off the stage (in reality, Hardy needed time off because of a knee injury and later a staph infection). [...] A week after the wedding, General Manager Eric Bischoff gave Kane and Lita the wedding gift of choosing any match that Kane wanted at Unforgiven. Shawn Michaels (who had his throat crushed by Kane) was chosen and defeated Kane in a no-disqualification match at the pay-per-view. The next night, on the September 13 episode of Raw, Kane accidentally fell on Lita during a match with the debuting Gene Snitsky, who hit him on the back with a steel chair, ostensibly causing Lita to miscarry. Kane turned face after he sought revenge against Snitsky for causing the death of his child. He lost to Snitsky in a steel chain match at Taboo Tuesday, and he was sidelined for several months after Snitsky crushed his larynx with a chair following the match. This attack was a repeat performance of the storyline where Kane [...] "injured" [...] Michaels in the same exact manner. The [...] "injury" [...] gave Kane time to complete his starring role in the film, See No Evil. Kane returned in January 2005, defeating Snitsky at New Year's Revolution. After WrestleMania 21, Kane and Lita reconciled with one another and began antagonizing Lita's rival Trish Stratus. This led to a match between Kane and Stratus' hired bodyguard Viscera at Backlash that was won by Kane.|$|E
