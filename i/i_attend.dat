I told him I was so busy with my rocket work that I had no time to spare for any political activity. He then told me, that ... the SS would cost me no time at all.

30|$|Later <b>I</b> <b>attended</b> {{conferences}} {{sponsored by}} the International Federation of Nonlinear Analysts, an organization founded by V Lakshmikantham. 5 All of these conferences had sessions devoted exclusively to fixed point theory.

6000|$|... "I'll {{leave you}} boys here alone while <b>I</b> <b>attend</b> to {{making up a}} bed. You could sleep in the spare-room, I suppose; but my best sheets are there, and I don't just like to--Why, you didn't use the napkins!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "After {{the strange}} {{incident}} of this day, madam," [...] said the Lady, [...] "it {{is necessary for}} my honour and that of my son, that I partake whatever is offered to my involuntary guest. Please to inform the Lady Mary that <b>I</b> <b>attend</b> her commands." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Not if {{the court}} knows itself do I let a lady stake my horse for me," [...] said he. [...] "But if you'll run in, /chica/, and throw {{a pot of coffee}} {{together}} while <b>I</b> <b>attend</b> to the /caballo/, I'll be a good deal obliged." ...|$|E

6000|$|Careful of graver matters, <b>I</b> <b>attended</b> the mosque, {{and visited}} the venerable localities in which modern Alexandria abounds. Pilgrimaging Moslems are here ...|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>attended</b> the {{rehearsal}} last night, but am better this morning, {{and the doctor}} thinks I will pull through with careful attention.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Just that, Sir John. It's Mr. Smithers! Mr. Smithers {{has been}} at the work for the last twenty years. I knew it just as well as he from the first, because <b>I</b> <b>attend</b> to these sort of things; but I thought it best to go to the fountain-head.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{have not}} {{observed}} any such reluctance on her part," [...] said the lawyer dryly, [...] "but we can easily settle the question. I must {{go home and}} get some plans before <b>I</b> <b>attend</b> the vestry meeting about that pinnacle. Will you step across with me and we can ask her?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "In {{the name}} of humanity," [...] he repeated, [...] "ye'll allow me to do what I can to ease his sufferings, or I swear to you that I'll forsake at once the duties of a doctor, and that it's devil another patient will <b>I</b> <b>attend</b> in this {{unhealthy}} island at all." ...|$|E
60|$|Em.: How {{like a man}} to {{have his}} breakfast first. <b>I</b> <b>attended</b> to the seat {{business}} as soon as I left my cabin.|$|R

6000|$|... "Very happy," [...] Rhoda said; [...] "she is most {{kind and}} indulgent, {{and so that}} <b>I</b> <b>attend</b> to her little fancies, I can do just as I like. I have had lessons {{regularly}} from the rector's eldest daughter, who has been educated for a governess; and in every respect, aunt {{is all that is}} kind. Fancy her being afraid of Sam eating Minnie." ...|$|E
40|$|While at this conference, <b>I</b> <b>attended</b> {{numerous}} {{discussion groups}} and open forums {{and on the}} exhibit floor talking with vendors regarding products we subscribe to.

40|$|In February 1999 <b>I</b> <b>attended</b> the Ligonier Ministries National Conference {{with about}} 4, 000 {{other people in}} Orlando, Florida. Ligonier is the {{ministry}} of Dr. R. C. Sproul. <b>I</b> <b>attended</b> because {{for the first time}} in 30 years the topic was on Bible Prophecy. Guess what? The predominate view, led by Dr. Sproul, was that most of what you and I believe to be future prophecies have already been fulfilled by first century events. This view now being champion by Dr. Sproul and others is known as preterism...|$|R
6000|$|... "My {{reasons for}} leaving the Castle," [...] said Lord Evandale, glancing a look towards Edith, [...] "though they evidently seemed weighty, must needs give way to those which infer the power of serving you.

6000|$|... "I'm {{beginning}} to understand." [...] Andrew {{looked at her}} gravely. [...] "If anybody else had hinted as much, I'd have felt it was exacting and I was being driven too hard. With you it's different. Once or twice already you have given me the impetus I needed, and you're right now. But if I'm not required by Allinson's why shouldn't <b>I</b> <b>attend</b> to the claims?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I'm {{not a very}} {{important}} person at Elmhurst," [...] replied Eliza, in a pleasant, even tone. [...] "I obtained the situation {{only a few days}} ago. <b>I</b> <b>attend</b> to the household mending, you know, and care for the linen.

50|$|The monastic abbey was {{completed}} in 1089 but not consecrated until Holy Innocents' Day, 1115, (28 Dec) by the Archbishop of Rouen. King Henry <b>I</b> <b>attended</b> as did many bishops and nobles.|$|R

25|$|There {{were three}} or four camps {{under the name of}} Camp Farouk at that time in Afghanistan. <b>I</b> <b>attended</b> the open {{mainstream}} camp, not terrorist camps. I would not have been there if there was any suggestion of terrorist activity or the targeting of civilians. How would a white boy new to Islam, not understanding local customs or languages, largely uneducated in the ways of the world, get access to such supposedly secret camps planning acts of terror? The camps <b>I</b> <b>attended</b> were not al-Qaeda. I did not hear about such an organisation until my arrival in Guantanamo Bay.|$|R

6000|$|... "Why, say," [...] {{explained}} Steve, [...] "I {{was only}} {{thinking that it}} takes all kinds of ivory domes to make a nuttery. I ran across a new brand of simp this morning. Just before I came to you I'm scheduled {{to show up at}} one of these Astorbilt homes t'other side of the park. First I mix it with the old man, then son and heir blows in and <b>I</b> <b>attend</b> to him.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{want you}} {{to put them on}} me," [...] said Northwick. [...] "I intend to go back as your prisoner. If I have {{anything}} to expiate"--and he seemed to indulge a question of the fact for the last time--"I want the atonement to begin as soon as possible. If you haven't brought those things with you, you'd better go out to the police station and get them, while <b>I</b> <b>attend</b> to the tickets." ...|$|E
50|$|In 2013 Patriarch Bartholomew <b>I</b> <b>attended</b> the {{installation}} ceremony {{of the new}} Roman Catholic Pope, Pope Francis, {{which was the first}} time any Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople had ever attended such an installation.|$|R
6000|$|... "I am Mary Yardwell," [...] {{she replied}} in her peculiarly succinct speech. [...] "My home was in Marmion, but <b>I</b> <b>attended</b> school in your village. I sang in your church {{for a little}} while." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>attended</b> {{the theatre}} that night. When I {{returned}} to my hotel, a quiet man in dark clothes, who seemed interested in rubbing his finger nails with a silk handkerchief, appeared, magically, at my side.|$|R
