5|$|Donna {{is taken}} to a dying TARDIS, which UNIT has managed to use as {{the core of a}} crude time machine. Rose uses energy from the TARDIS to show Donna the beetle on her back, but tells her they do not know what it is. She insists that Donna travel back to the day she made the fateful turn and choose to turn left again. Donna is transported back minutes before she would make that turn, but too far away to contact her past self in time. She makes the {{decision}} to walk out in front of a passing truck and let it hit her, creating a traffic jam that causes her past self to turn left out of impatience. As Donna lies on the ground dying, Rose whispers a message <b>into</b> <b>her</b> <b>ear</b> for the Doctor. The alternate universe disappears, and Donna finds herself back on Shan Shen. The beetle falls off of Donna's back, and the fortune teller runs away after uttering some terrified words about what Donna will become.|$|E
25|$|Tiffany, Pat, {{and their}} friends and family arrive at the {{competition}} {{on the night of}} the football game. Tiffany despairs when she finds that Nikki actually is in the audience, invited by Ronnie and Veronica who want Nikki to lift her restraining order on Pat and give Pat the chance to reconcile with her. Tiffany walks to the bar and starts drinking. Pat finds her moments before their dance and drags her onto the dance floor. They begin their routine as the Eagles defeat the Dallas Cowboys. At the conclusion of their set, Tiffany and Pat score exactly 5 points. Amid cheers from friends and family and confused looks from the crowd, Pat approaches Nikki and speaks quietly <b>into</b> <b>her</b> <b>ear.</b> Tiffany sees this and runs off. Pat leaves Nikki behind after a short conversation, and chases Tiffany. He hands her a letter, in which he admits that he knows she forged Nikki's letter and confesses that he loved her from the moment he met her, though it took him so long to come to terms with it. They share a kiss. Patrizio opens a restaurant with the money he has won, Danny grows even closer to the Solitanos, and Pat and Tiffany begin a relationship, no longer wearing their wedding rings.|$|E
2500|$|Linda and Noor {{were sitting}} on a {{two-seater}} couch with Charlotte sitting on the arm, when Noor started touching Linda in a sexual way. He spoke <b>into</b> <b>her</b> <b>ear,</b> {{put his arms around}} her waist and refused to let her go. Kathleen then started screaming at him and a verbal altercation took place where Kathleen Mulhall was alleged to have instructed them to ‚Äùjust kill him for me" [...] Charlotte picked up a Stanley knife and struck Noor across the throat, inflicting a wound that sent him to the ground. Linda then picked up a hammer and hit him on the head a number of times. Their mother looked on but didn't participate. Noor was stabbed at least 27 times. It may have been more, but pathologists had no opportunity to examine the full body.|$|E
60|$|He {{gathered}} {{her in his}} arms, whispering words of courage and love <b>into</b> <b>her</b> <b>ears.</b>|$|R
60|$|Elizabeth {{had begun}} to sob quietly. Philip, who was holding her tenderly in his arms, whispered unheard things <b>into</b> <b>her</b> <b>ears.</b> It was Beatrice who {{remained}} {{in charge of the}} situation.|$|R
60|$|Thus {{when the}} three brothers, each armed with a whip, entered the hut a few seconds later, they found a woman {{extended}} on the floor, and Toueno kneeling at her side, whistling loudly <b>into</b> <b>her</b> <b>ears.</b>|$|R
2500|$|Barnard later wrote, [...] "For a {{dying man}} {{it is not}} a {{difficult}} decision because he knows he is at the end. If a lion chases you to the bank of a river filled with crocodiles, you will leap into the water, convinced {{you have a chance to}} swim to the other side." [...] The donor heart came from a young woman, Denise Darvall, who had been rendered brain dead in an accident on 2 December 1967, while crossing a street in Cape Town. On examination at Groote Schuur hospital, Darvall had two serious fractures in her skull, with no electrical activity in her brain detected, and no sign of pain when ice water was poured <b>into</b> <b>her</b> <b>ear.</b> [...] Coert Venter and Bertie Bosman requested permission from Darvall's father for Denise's heart to be used in the transplant attempt. The afternoon before his first transplant, Barnard dozed at his home while listening to music. [...] When he awoke, he decided to modify Shumway and Lower's technique. [...] Instead of cutting straight across the back of the atrial chambers of the donor heart, he would avoid damage to the septum and instead cut two small holes for the venae cavae and pulmonary veins. [...] Prior to the transplant, rather than wait for Darvall's heart to stop beating, at his brother Marius Barnard's urging, Christiaan had injected potassium into her heart to paralyse it and render her technically dead by the whole-body standard. Twenty years later, Marius Barnard recounted, [...] "Chris stood there for a few moments, watching, then stood back and said, 'It works.'" ...|$|E
60|$|Fanny reconnoitered, and returning, listened breathlessly, while Polly poured <b>into</b> <b>her</b> <b>ear</b> {{the bitter}} secret which was preying on her soul.|$|E
6000|$|Johnny Eames was {{standing}} close, and whispered <b>into</b> <b>her</b> <b>ear,</b> [...] "Changes are so pleasant sometimes! Don't you think so? I do." ...|$|E
60|$|But Mrs. Woodward's {{heart was}} not hard as the nether millstone. She drew her {{daughter}} to her, and as she pressed her to her bosom, she whispered <b>into</b> <b>her</b> <b>ears</b> that she now hoped they might all be happy.|$|R
6000|$|How {{often had}} he whispered [...] "Maryanne" [...] <b>into</b> <b>her</b> <b>ears,</b> and the dear girl had smiled upon {{him to hear}} herself so called! But he could not remind her of this at the present moment. [...] "I have your father's sanction," [...] said he-- ...|$|R
60|$|In {{spite of}} these attentions, however, and the {{frequent}} solicitations of her guardian, Kate stood firmly to her colours. If the Tom of the present were false, she at least would be true {{to the memory of}} the Tom of other days, the lad who had first whispered words of love <b>into</b> <b>her</b> <b>ears.</b> <b>Her</b> ideal should remain with her whatever might befall. No other man could ever take the place of that.|$|R
6000|$|... "Can I do {{anything}} for ye, dearie?" [...] said Old Peg, putting the trumpet-end <b>into</b> <b>her</b> <b>ear,</b> and handing the mouth-piece to Duncan.|$|E
60|$|This {{was said}} in {{consequence}} of Elspie shouting to the old woman to let her put something <b>into</b> <b>her</b> <b>ear</b> to cure deafness.|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{will be all}} right," [...] {{he tried}} to reassure her, with a tone of conviction, {{speaking}} <b>into</b> <b>her</b> <b>ear,</b> and of necessity clasping her more closely than before.|$|E
60|$|After that {{he talked}} to her {{whenever}} he could take an opportunity. The valley became the world for him, and the world beyond the mountains where men lived by day seemed {{no more than a}} fairy tale he would some day pour <b>into</b> <b>her</b> <b>ears.</b> Very tentatively and timidly he spoke to her of sight.|$|R
60|$|She {{could bear}} it no more--she opened her eyes, {{stared at the}} {{darkness}}, {{and out of the}} darkness came voices, telling of death and war. She thrust <b>her</b> fingers <b>into</b> <b>her</b> <b>ears,</b> and tried to fix her thoughts on Rames, that bright-eyed, light-footed lover of hers, whom she so longed to see again, without whom she was so lonely and undefended.|$|R
60|$|Kate stepped {{gracefully}} forward, {{and without}} any show of annoyance or irritation, breathed a few words <b>into</b> <b>her</b> mother's <b>ear.</b>|$|R
60|$|Their {{horses were}} pressed side by side. Baynes had found Meriem's hand and was {{pressing}} {{it as he}} poured words of love <b>into</b> <b>her</b> <b>ear,</b> and Meriem was listening.|$|E
60|$|He {{detained}} {{her after}} {{the manner of}} lovers. She expostulated without struggling because {{it was hard for}} her to repulse him. He whispered <b>into</b> <b>her</b> <b>ear</b> while he put his arms round her.|$|E
60|$|Herbert whispered a {{few words}} quietly <b>into</b> <b>her</b> <b>ear,</b> and then left the room hurriedly with a stiff and formal bow to his brother Ronald. Lady Le Breton turned round to the culprit severely.|$|E
60|$|Romola paused no longer. That {{evening she}} was in Florence, sitting in {{agitated}} silence under the exclamations of joy and wailing, mingled with exuberant narrative, which were poured <b>into</b> <b>her</b> <b>ears</b> by Monna Brigida, who had backslided into false hair in Romola's absence, but now drew it off again and declared she would not mind being grey, if her dear child would stay with her.|$|R
60|$|So, {{with much}} confusion, she whispered <b>into</b> <b>her</b> papa's <b>ear</b> that Norman {{had been telling}} her {{something}} he guessed about Mr. Ernescliffe.|$|R
60|$|She {{turned her}} back, {{thrusting}} <b>her</b> fingers <b>into</b> <b>her</b> <b>ears.</b> Then {{she began to}} laugh, harshly, sharply, metallically; and Hans was shocked as {{he had not been}} shocked through the whole tragedy. Edith Nelson's break-down had come. Even in her hysteria she knew it, and she was glad that she had been able to hold up under the strain until everything had been accomplished. She reeled toward Hans.|$|R
6000|$|... "Griselda," [...] he said,--and {{it must be}} {{admitted}} that his tone was not bad. The word sank softly <b>into</b> <b>her</b> <b>ear,</b> like small rain upon moss, and it sank into no other ear. [...] "Griselda!" ...|$|E
60|$|He tore {{open the}} {{envelope}} and read the few lines scrawled upon a half sheet of notepaper. He read them very softly <b>into</b> <b>her</b> <b>ear,</b> but the words were audible enough to all of them.|$|E
60|$|His {{face was}} very close to Billie's, who had cheered up wonderfully by this time, and he was {{whispering}} his degraded words of endearment <b>into</b> <b>her</b> <b>ear,</b> when there was a sort of explosion in the doorway.|$|E
60|$|But Mrs. Jo {{was among}} {{them before the}} retreat was accomplished, and <b>into</b> <b>her</b> {{sympathetic}} <b>ear</b> the young ladies poured {{the story of their}} woes.|$|R
60|$|By {{screams and}} snatches of song and certain audible testimonials of {{domestic}} felicity was his advent proclaimed. When {{she heard his}} foot on the stairs the old maid in the hall room always stuffed cotton <b>into</b> <b>her</b> <b>ears.</b> At first Jessie had shrunk from the rudeness and favor of these spiritual greetings, but as the fog of the false Bohemia gradually encompassed her she came to accept them as love's true and proper greeting.|$|R
6000|$|... 'And, mamma,' and {{she whispered}} close <b>into</b> <b>her</b> mother's <b>ear,</b> {{as she made}} her next request; 'and, mamma, you will be with me on that day?' ...|$|R
60|$|McMurdo {{found himself}} under {{sentence}} of banishment both from his comfortable quarters {{and from the}} girl whom he loved. He found her alone in the sitting-room that same evening, and he poured his troubles <b>into</b> <b>her</b> <b>ear.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "Nellie, may I {{marry you}} to Jim?" [...] whispered Mr. Wells <b>into</b> <b>her</b> <b>ear.</b> [...] "He {{has told me}} how it is with him. He loves you, Nellie. I'd die happier knowing I'd left you with him." ...|$|E
6000|$|A man's {{voice came}} {{back over the}} wire so clear, so distinct, so intimate, {{it seemed as if}} he were {{speaking}} <b>into</b> <b>her</b> <b>ear.</b> [...] "It is I, Ross Cavanagh. I want to ask how your mother is?" ...|$|E
6000|$|Rachel, though very white, {{called up}} a heroic smile, and {{declared}} that she should get on very well. Her spirit had risen to the occasion, so as to brace her nerves to go becomingly through what was inevitable; and she replied with a ready [...] "yes," [...] to Mr. Grey's repetition of the advice for ever dinned <b>into</b> <b>her</b> <b>ears,</b> not {{to say a word}} more than needful, feeling indeed little disposed to utter anything that she could avoid.|$|R
60|$|She {{had never}} spoken to Linda on the matter, and Linda had offered to her no confidence; but she felt all but sure that her second child would not have entertained the affection which she had been unable {{altogether}} to conceal, had no lover's plea been poured <b>into</b> <b>her</b> <b>ears.</b> Mrs. Woodward questioned her daughters but little, but she understood well the nature of each, and could nearly read their thoughts. Linda's thoughts it was not difficult to read.|$|R
6000|$|... "For seven years," [...] said Lily, {{jumping up}} and {{whispering}} <b>into</b> <b>her</b> mother's <b>ear.</b> [...] "I shall hardly be six-and-twenty then, which {{is not at all}} too old." ...|$|R
