40|$|Abstract: In this paper, Plasma Enhanced Chemical Vapor Deposition (PECVD) SiO 2 film {{properties}} are modeled using statistical analysis and neural networks. For systemic analysis, Box-Behnken's 3 factor {{design of experiments}} (DOE) with response surface method are used. For characterization, deposited film thickness and film stress are considered as film properties and three process input factors including plasma RF power, flow rate of N 2 O gas, and flow rate of 5 % SiH 4 gas contained at N 2 gas are considered for modeling. For film thickness characterization, regression based model showed only 0. 71 % of root mean squared (RMS) error. Also, for film stress model case, both regression model and neural prediction model showed acceptable RMS error.

The major draw back of the SVDD modeling is the issue of training of the SVDD which is a quadratic programming (QP) problem. In this paper we propose a method to efficiently train the SVDD’s. The advantages of our technique are its low memory requirement and its efficiency in terms of speed. The proposed method runs in constant time with respect to the size of the training data set since its retraining is performed only on the support vector working set...|$|E

The study includes a review of literature which relates an application of art therapy principles and practice to an education framework and the developmental and emotional needs of primary age children. The art therapy programs are examined {{in terms of the}} target population (eg. abused, rejected, disaffected, vulnerable children); the value of these programs to children in the primary school system (ie. in helping to remove students 2 ̆ 7 emotional blocks to learning); the logistics of their implementation in primary schools; and their source of funding.
