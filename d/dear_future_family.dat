40|$|The {{present study}} first {{investigated}} {{the factor structure}} and assessed {{the psychometric properties of}} a scale that measures the degree to which <b>future</b> <b>family</b> responsibilities are considered by men when making career decisions. The study then examined the contributions of parental attachment and gender role conflict in predicting men’s career and family planning. Participants included 205 college men. The findings suggested that two subscales comprise the measure: the Incorporating <b>Future</b> <b>Family</b> in Career Plans subscale (IFFCP; α =. 80) and the Choosing a Career Independent of <b>Future</b> <b>Family</b> subscale (CCIFF; α =. 80). Convergent validity was supported through a negative correlation among the IFFCP subscale and career aspirations. Discriminant validity was supported, in which the IFFCP subscale lacked a correlation and the CCIFF subscale had a low correlation with the career decision-making self-efficacy. Attachment to father positively predicted incorporating <b>future</b> <b>family</b> considerations in career planning, and gender role conflict in the success, power and competition domain positively predicte...|$|R

40|$|A {{large body}} of {{literature}} addresses the effects of divorce on children. Only {{a small part of}} this literature, however, addresses the effects of divorce on young adult children. This smaller body of literature addresses the emotional effects of divorce, the way adult children of divorce perceive their families of origin, and the intergenerational transmission of divorce hypothesis. The present study examined {{the nature of the relationship}} between parental divorce and its effects on the expectations of adults children's own <b>future</b> <b>families.</b> It is hypothesized that the structure of the family of origin plays a significant role in these expectations and that young adults from intact families will differ significantly from young adults from divorced families. One hundred sixty-seven students from a midwestern university participated in this study. Participants completed two versions of the Family Adaptability and Cohesion Scales III (FACES III). These two versions were for (1) the family of origin and (2) the <b>future</b> <b>family.</b> Participants also completed a demographic questionnaire. The following hypotheses were tested: (1) Family structure in the family of origin will predict expectations of young adults' own <b>future</b> familes; (2) <b>Family</b> functioning in the family of origin will predict expectations of young adults' own <b>future</b> families; (3) <b>Family</b> structure and family functioning in the family of origin will be related to each other in predicting the expectations of young adults' own <b>future</b> <b>families.</b> Contrary to expectations, only one of the three hypotheses was supported. Family functioning in the family of origin did predict expectations of family functioning in young adults' <b>future</b> <b>families.</b> This was true of both the cohesion and the adaptability contructs. Family structure did not predict expectations of young adults' own <b>future</b> <b>families.</b> An interaction of family structure and family functioning in the family of origin did not predict expectations of <b>future</b> <b>families</b> above and beyond what the two variables could predict independently. Implications of these findings and limitations and recommendations for future research are discussed. Department of Counseling Psychology and Guidance ServicesThesis (Ph. D. ...|$|R

The Planning for Career and Family Scale) and to assess the psychometric properties of this instrument. Participants included 325 women. Data suggested that two subscales comprise the measure, the Incorporating <b>Future</b> <b>Family</b> Scale and the Choosing a Career Independent of Family Scale. Internal consistency estimates of subscales ranged from. 78 to. 83. Convergent and discriminant validity was supported for the Incorporating <b>Future</b> <b>Family</b> in Career Plans subscale and the Choosing a Career Independent of <b>Future</b> <b>Family</b> subscale. Test-retest reliability estimates were adequate, suggesting stability regarding the measurement of these constructs.
