5|$|Prospects for a {{successful}} release did not look good. Aykroyd and Belushi had left SNL {{at the end of}} the previous season, reducing their bankability. Belushi's fame had taken a further hit after the commercial and critical failure of 1941 {{at the end of the}} year. One day after the editing was done, Wasserman invited Landis up to his office to speak with Ted Mann, head of the Mann Theatres chain, which dominated film exhibition in the Western United States. He told Landis that he would not book the film at any theaters in predominantly white neighborhoods, such as Westwood. Not only did Mann not want black patrons going there to see the film, he surmised that white viewers were unlikely to see a film featuring older black musical stars. Ultimately The Blues Brothers <b>got</b> <b>less</b> than half the bookings nationwide for its initial release than a typical big-budget studio film of the era, which did not bode well for its success at the box office.|$|E
25|$|Edén Pastora, {{the former}} Sandinista Deputy Defense Minister (1979–1981), was the presidential {{candidate}} for the Nicaraguan Democratic Action Party (PAD) in 1996. The Supreme Electoral Council (CSE) barred him from running for the presidency {{on the grounds that}} he had Costa Rican nationality. In the 2004 municipal elections, Pastora was running for mayor of Managua on the Independent Liberal Party's ticket. Pastora <b>got</b> <b>less</b> than 5% of the votes.|$|E
25|$|There were {{considerable}} {{difficulties in}} the operation of the contracts and the management of the men. During the period 1870–1875, power gradually transferred from the Provinces to the central government, partly because of the railway question. The Bill to abolish the Provinces was carried in October 1875 and implemented a year later. However, in the interim {{it was very difficult for}} Brogdens to get clear prompt decisions. Brogdens <b>got</b> <b>less</b> work than they had hoped and it became available more slowly than expected. Communications between UK and New Zealand were obviously slow so it was difficult to know how many men to send at any given time. Sometimes Brogdens could not find work for the men when they arrived. Men reneged on their promissory notes. There were disputes over working hours, wages and whether they should be paid when the weather stopped the work. Gradually the men drifted away. By August 1873, 2172 English immigrants had been brought out. They included 1299 working-age men who were contracted to work for Brogdens for two years but only 287 of them were still working for them. Most of the men were agricultural labourers, rather than true navvies and they found local agricultural labour and working conditions more attractive than navvy work.|$|E

[...] He criticized McLachlan's [...] "monumental banality" [...] and summed the album up as [...] "renormalized pop at its most unnecessary." [...] A reviewer for Rolling Stone criticized the album's slow tempo, commenting that [...] "if you {{want a piece of}} her nirvana, you have to go along at her protracted, glacial pace." [...] They said that McLachlan is too [...] "rigid in her introspection" [...] and {{that they would like to}} hear her [...] "work up a good head of steam".|$|E
500|$|Arnold Schwarzenegger's {{performance}} was frequently {{mentioned in the}} critiques. [...] Clarens, Peary, Gunden and Nigel Andrews were among those who gave positive assessments of the former bodybuilder's acting: to them, he was physically convincing as the barbarian in his body movements and appearance. [...] Andrews added that Schwarzenegger exuded a certain charmwith his accent mangling his dialogthat made the film appealing to his fans. [...] Fanfares Royal S. Brown disagreed and was grateful that the actor's dialog amounted to [...] "2pages of typescript." [...] Schickel summed up Schwarzenegger's acting as [...] "flat", while Knoll was more verbose, characterizing the actor's portrayal as [...] "a dull clod with a sharp sword, a human collage of pectorals and latissimi who's <b>got</b> <b>less</b> style and wit than Lassie." [...] While Sandahl Bergman earned acclaim for injecting grace and dynamism into the film, the film's more experienced thespians were not spared criticisms. Gunden said von Sydow showed little dedication to his role, and Clarens judged Jones's portrayal of Thulsa Doom to be worse than camp. [...] Brougher faulted none of the actors for their performances, laying the blame on Milius's script, instead.|$|E
500|$|Loveless {{was largely}} {{recorded}} in mono sound, as Shields felt it {{important that the}} album's sound consisted of [...] "the guitar smack bang {{in the middle and}} no chorus, no modulation effect". Shields wavers his guitar's tremolo bar as he strums, which contributes, in part, to the band's distinctive sound. This technique—nicknamed [...] "Glide guitar"—causes the guitar strings to bend slightly in and out of tune. Shields said that due to his use of the tremolo bar, [...] "People were thinking it's hundreds of guitars, when it's actually <b>got</b> <b>less</b> guitar tracks than most people's demo tapes have." [...] The guitarist asserted that unlike other bands of the shoegazing movement of the early 1990s, My Bloody Valentine did not use chorus or flanger pedals. He insisted, [...] "No other band played that guitar like me [...] We did everything solely with the tremolo arm". Shields aimed to use [...] "very simple minimal effects" [...] which often were the result of involved studio work. He stated, [...] "The songs are really simply structured. A lot of them are purposely like that. That way {{you can get away with}} a lot more when you mess around with the contents". In a 1992 Guitar World interview, Shields described how he achieved a sound akin to a wah-wah pedal on [...] "I Only Said" [...] by playing his guitar through an amplifier with a graphic equaliser preamp. After recording the track, he then bounced it to another track through a parametric equaliser while he adjusted the EQ levels manually. The interviewer asked if Shields could have achieved the same effect more easily by simply using a wah-wah pedal, to which the guitarist replied, [...] "In attitude toward sound, yes. But not in approach." ...|$|E

2500|$|It was {{a remarkably}} good aim if you {{consider}} that the bomb was fired 250yards [...] with no direct line of sight. Technically, it was quite brilliant and I'm sure that many army crews, if given a similar task, would be very pleased to drop a bomb that close. You've got to park the launch vehicle in an area which is guarded by armed men and you've <b>got</b> <b>less</b> than a minute to do it. I was very, very surprised at how good it was.

Yet the water was not all deep. Another shoal {{occupied}} part of the basin and Kit tried to recapture its bearings as he had noted them when he went fishing in the boat. He found he could not. When the light was strong and the swell slow, one could judge distance and know the depth by the changing colour and the measured line of foam. Now there was nothing but foam that tossed in the dark.|$|E
60|$|Indeed, {{during the}} day of suspense, while the two {{physicians}} were gone to London, taking with them the papers, and a minute detail of the evidence at the trial, Gertrude's high spirits, triumph over Charles Cheviot, and desire to trumpet forth the good news, were oppressive. How many times that day was Mab stroked, and assured that her master would come back! And how often did the two sisters endeavour to persuade themselves {{that she was not}} grown broader in the back! Mary was, of course, told early in the day, but Gertrude <b>got</b> <b>less</b> sympathy from her than answered to that damsel's extortionate expectations, for, according to her wicked account, Mary's little Charlie had sneezed three times, and his mamma must regret what sent all the medical science of Stoneborough away by the early train.|$|E

60|$|Marston and the fisher-lad {{vanished}} {{down the}} forecastle hatch, and Wyndham studied the distant object. He {{did not yet}} need the sail the others had gone for, but {{he was afraid of}} Charley's keen eyes. A buoy indicating a shoal was not far off and the sailing directions for the race stated that all marks of this kind must be kept on the port hand, but Wyndham knew the coast and imagined the tide was still ebbing in a neighboring river mouth. The main stream ran north and would carry the boats off their course, but near the shore another stream ran west across some wide shoals. If he could steer Red Rose into this current, it would help her on while her rivals, farther off the land, drifted back. When the others came up with the sail Wyndham wondered whether Marston would ask for the chart, but he did not. The object they had seen had vanished, for although the wind was light the boat slowly forged ahead. The color of the smooth undulations indicated that the depth <b>got</b> <b>less.</b>|$|E

"Well, my lad, {{you have}} done wonders," [...] his father said, when he had finished; [...] "and if I had as much {{enterprise}} and go as you have, I should {{have been out of}} this place years ago. But in the first place, I was very slow in picking up their lingo. You see, until within {{the last three or four}} years, there have always been other Englishmen with me. Of course we talked together, and as most of them were able to speak a little of the lingo, there was no occasion for me to learn it. Then I was always, from the first, when they saw that I was handy at all sorts of things, kept at odd jobs, and so <b>got</b> <b>less</b> chance of picking up the language than those who were employed in drilling, or who had nothing to do but talk to their guards. But most of all, I did not try to escape because I found that, if I did so, it would certainly cost my companions their lives. That was the way that scoundrel Tippoo kept us from making attempts to get off.|$|E
60|$|Pencils, school-keeping, {{and trade}} being thus {{discarded}} one after another, Thoreau, with {{a stroke of}} strategy, turned the position. He saw his way to get his board and lodging for practically nothing; and Admetus never <b>got</b> <b>less</b> work out of any servant since the world began. It was his ambition to be an Oriental philosopher; {{but he was always}} a very Yankee sort of Oriental. Even in the peculiar attitude in which he stood to money, his system of personal economics, as we may call it, he displayed a vast amount of truly down-East calculation, and he adopted poverty like a piece of business. Yet his system is based on one or two ideas which, I believe, come naturally to all thoughtful youths, and are only pounded out of them by city uncles. Indeed, something essentially youthful distinguishes all Thoreau's knock-down blows at current opinion. Like the posers of a child, they leave the orthodox in a kind of speechless agony. These know the thing is nonsense. They are sure there must be an answer, yet somehow cannot find it. So it is with his system of economy. He cuts through the subject on so new a plane that the accepted arguments apply no longer; he attacks it in a new dialect where there are no catch-words ready made for the defender; after you have been boxing for years on a polite, gladiatorial convention, here is an assailant who does not scruple to hit below the belt.|$|E
