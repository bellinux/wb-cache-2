40|$|Thermochemical {{data for}} many basic iron {{phosphates}} have been estimated by a method which regards these cornpounds as components on joins between the simple phosphates and hydroxides. The data so derived {{have been used}} to develop models depicting the phase com-patibilities and the general diagenetic behavior of iron phosphates in subaqueous freshwater environments. The models are combined with measurements on the interstitial waters of Lake Erie to define the chemical requirements for the formation of vivianite and other iron phocphates in the Great Lakes sediments. In aerobic lake sediments, ferrosoferric (and manganousferric) hydroxyphosphates are the stable minerals which may be derived by phosphating ferromanganese oxides or by the oxidation of <b>ferrous</b> <b>phosphates.</b> Strengite and simple ferric phosphates are unlikely to be important diagenetic constituents of freshwater sediments. The stable and most probable phosphate minerals in reducing environments are vivianite, reddingite, and anapaite. The precipitation and dissolution of these iron phosphates (particularly vivianite and ludlamite, the dominant phases) in the Great Lakes sedirnents are considered an important buffer mechanism which regulates both the levels of phosphorus in the interstitial waters and the release of phosphorus to the overlying lake waters...|$|R

40|$|The major lateral radular {{teeth of}} chitons (Mollusca: Polyplacophora) are {{composite}} material, incorporating {{a variety of}} biominerals within an organic scaffold. Numerous studies, conducted over the past 30 years, have proposed that chiton teeth are comprised {{of a variety of}} iron and calcium minerals, such as the iron oxides magnetite, lepidcrocite, geothite, mahemite and limonite, along with calcium phosphates, such as fluroatite, crancolite and dahllite, or amorphous hyrous <b>ferrous</b> <b>phosphates.</b> While magnetite is ubiguitous to the major lateral teeth of all Polyplacophorans whose radule have been described to date, its distribution in these teeth is not constant.

Unlike magnetite, the other biominerals are not common to all Polyplacophora, and the variety of mineralization strategies employed by chitons could well reflect phylogentic affinities, providing a basis for the utilization of biomineralization as a systematic tool in chitons.

40|$|Both {{organic and}} {{inorganic}} sulfur {{play an important}} role in fundamental contemporary biochemistry, suggesting that life's common ancestor used sulfur in its metabolism. In support of this idea is the widely held belief that present-day sulfurmetabolising thermophilic bacteria are the most primitive organisms within the biosphere. This thesis postulates that sulfur may have been important in the origins of life, and reports investigates several interesting and potentially prebiotic reactions involving sulfur. Three different types of chemistry were investigated. The formation of pyrophosphate from phosphate with thioesters over metal phosphate precipitates has been reported; this can be considered a biomimic of the important succinyl-CoA synthetase-catalysed reaction in the citric acid cycle of present-day organisms. The ability of ferrous sulfide and/or <b>ferrous</b> <b>phosphate</b> precipitates to catalyse pyrophosphate production with thioesters or metal ion-bound thioacids as condensing agents was investigated. No pyrophosphate production was detected, but interesting results regarding the effect of ferrous ions in solution and ferrous sulfide precipitates and <b>ferrous</b> <b>phosphate</b> precipitates on the rate of hydrolysis of thioacetic acid are reported. Ferrous ion- and sulfide ion-mediated redox chemistry of thioesters and metal-ion bound thioacids was investigated. The motivation for these experiments came from the involvement of thioesters in contemporary biochemical redox reactions. No ferrous ion- or sulfide ion-dependent redox chemistry was demonstrated. Finally amide bond formation between amines and metal ion-bound thioacids was investigated. It was discovered that nickel sulfide precipitates are efficient catalysts in this process. Nickel sulfide would have been present in the oceans of primordial earth, and may therefore have been an important prebiotic catalyst in the origin of amide bonds in metabolism...|$|E

40|$|In {{an effort}} to improve the {{understanding}} of electron transfer mechanisms at the microbe–mineral interface, Shewanella oneidensis MR- 1 mutants with in-frame deletions of outer-membrane cytochromes (OMCs), MtrC and OmcA, were characterized for the ability to reduce ferrihydrite (FH) using a suite of microscopic, spectroscopic, and biochemical techniques. Analysis of purified recombinant proteins demonstrated that both cytochromes undergo rapid electron exchange with FH in vitro with MtrC displaying faster transfer rates than OmcA. Immunomicroscopy with cytochrome-specific antibodies revealed that MtrC co-localizes with iron solids on the cell surface while OmcA exhibits a more diffuse distribution over the cell surface. After 3 -day incubation of MR- 1 with FH, pronounced reductive transformation mineral products were visible by electron microscopy. Upon further incubation, the predominant phases identified were <b>ferrous</b> <b>phosphates</b> including vivianite [Fe 3 (PO 4) 2 • 8 H 2 O] and a switzerite-like phase [Mn 3,Fe 3 (PO 4) 2 • 7 H 2 O] that were heavily colonized by MR- 1 cells with surface-exposed outer-membrane cytochromes. In the absence of both MtrC and OmcA, the cells ability to reduce FH was significantly hindered and no mineral transformation products were detected.

40|$|The {{reduction}} of less stable ferric hydroxides and formation of ferrous phases {{is critical for}} the fate of phosphorus in anaerobic soils and sediments. The interaction between <b>ferrous</b> iron and <b>phosphate</b> was investigated experimentally during the {{reduction of}} synthetic ferrihydrite with natural organic materials as carbon source. Ferrihydrite was readily reduced by dissimilatory iron reducing bacteria (DIRB) with between 52 % and 73 % Fe(III) converted to Fe(II) after 31 days, higher than without DIRB. Formation of ferrous phases was linearly coupled to almost complete removal of both aqueous and exchangeable phosphate. Simple model calculations based on the incubation data suggested <b>ferrous</b> phases bound <b>phosphate</b> with a molar ratio of Fe(II) :P between 1. 14 - 2. 25 or a capacity of 246 - 485 mg·P·g − 1 Fe(II).

When the ratio of Fe(II) :P was more than 1. 5, the precipitation of Fe(II) phosphate was soundly crystallized to vivianite. Thus, reduction of ferric iron provides a mechanism for the further removal of available phosphate via the production of ferrous phases, with anaerobic soils and sediments potentially exhibiting a higher capacity to bind phosphate than some aerobic systems...|$|R

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. In designated nutrient-sensitive areas, phosphorus must be removed from sewage before it is discharged to the receiving water body. Phosphorus-rich sludge is generated, which is usually digested anaerobically prior to disposal. This research investigated the effect of phosphorus enrichment on metal and phosphorus fractionation in anaerobically digested sludge. The use of two complementary sequential chemical extraction procedures to measure phosphorus and metal fractionation, was a key focus of the research. The fractionation procedures were tested by sequentially extracting inorganic compounds (phosphates, sulphides and carbonates) which showed that the operationally defined metal and phosphorus fractions were not always representative of precise metal phases. Species were tentatively assigned to metal and phosphorus fractions using model compound results. Laboratory-scale batch anaerobic digestion experiments were performed, in which model compounds were used to simulate conditions of soluble and insoluble phosphorus enrichment. Soluble phosphorus at concentrations of 500 mg/l or greater was found to retard volatile solids removal and methane production in the laboratory digesters. Soluble phosphorus enrichment facilitated precipitation of calcium, magnesium and manganese but increased trace metal solubility, particularly that of chromium. Enrichment of digesters with Na 2 HP 04 and MgCb caused struvite to precipitate in digesters containing 1000 mg/l of additional phosphorus. FeP 04 enrichment of digested sludge showed that ferric iron was reduced to ferrous iron, releasing soluble phosphorus into the digester. Most of the phosphorus was reprecipitated as <b>ferrous</b> <b>phosphate,</b> causing co-precipitation of magnesium, manganese and cobalt. By contrast, A 1 P 04 added to the digesters was stable in the sludge. Full-scale CPR sludge digestion (Fe 2 (S 04) 3 dosing) caused soluble phosphorus in the digester to decrease below 0. 05 mg/l. Phosphorus remained associated with iron in the sludge fraction but soluble calcium and magnesium concentrations in the full-scale digester increased {{as a result of}} CPR sludge digestion. Comparison of laboratory and full-scale results showed that the fate of iron-precipitated phosphorus in digested sludge was primarily dependent pn the molar ratio of Fe:P in the sludge. Full-scale BPR sludge digestion showed high concentrations of soluble phosphorus in the digester and some struvite precipitation, although phosphorus was precipitated primarily as calcium phosphate, as was found to occur in the laboratory digesters simulating BPR sludge digestion...|$|E
40|$|Dissimilatory iron-reducing {{bacteria}} (DIRB) couple the oxidation {{of organic}} matter or H 2 to the reduction of iron oxides. The factors controlling the rate and extent of these reduction reactions and the resulting solid phases are complex and poorly understood. Batch experiments were conducted with amorphous hydrous ferric oxide (HFO) and the DIRB Shewanella putrefaciens, strain CN 32, in well-defined aqueous solutions to investigate the reduction of HFO and formation of biogenic Fe(II) minerals. Lactate-HFO solutions buffered with either bicarbonate or 1, 4 -piperazinediethanesulfonic acid (PIPES) containing various combinations of phosphate and anthraquinone- 2, 6 -disulfonate (AQDS), were inoculated with S. putrefaciens CN 32. AQDS, a humic acid analog that {{can be reduced to}} dihydroanthraquinone by CN 32, was included because of its ability to function as an electron shuttle during microbial iron reduction and as an indicator of pe. Iron reduction was measured with time, and the resulting solids were analyzed by X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) with energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) and selected area electron diffraction (SAED). In HCO 3 − buffered medium with AQDS, HFO was rapidly and extensively reduced, and the resulting solids were dominated by ferrous carbonate (siderite). <b>Ferrous</b> <b>phosphate</b> (vivianite) was also present in HCO 3 − medium containing P, and fine-grained magnetite was present as a minor phase in HCO 3 − medium with or without P. In the PIPES buffered medium, the rate and extent of reduction was strongly influenced by AQDS and P. With AQDS, HFO was rapidly converted to highly crystalline magnetite whereas in its absence, magnetite mineralization was slower and the final material less crystalline. In PIPES with both P and AQDS, a green rust type compound [Fe II(6 -x) Fe III x (OH) 12] x+[(A 2 −) x/ 2 • yH 2 O]x− was the dominant solid phase formed; in the absence of AQDS a poorly crystalline product was observed. The measured pe and nature of the solids identified were consistent with thermodynamic considerations. The composition of aqueous media in which microbial iron reduction occurred strongly impacted the rate and extent of iron reduction {{and the nature of the}} reduced solids. This, in turn, can provide a feedback control mechanism on microbial metabolism. Hence, in sediments where geochemical conditions promote magnetite formation, two-thirds of the Fe(III) will be sequestered in a form that may not be available for anaerobic bacterial respiration...|$|E

The {{existence}} of the monohydrogen <b>ferrous</b> <b>phosphate</b> Fe(HPO 4),H 20 (or 2 FeO, P 2 O 5, 3 H 2 O) has "been confirmed. This com-pound was described by Debray but subsequently Erlenmeyer cast doubt on Debray's results. The compound has been obtained in two forms, viz. "amorphous" and crystalline, the latter showing a decidedly lower solubility. In addition a dihydrate Fe(HPO 4), 2 H 2 O (or 2 FeO, P 2 O 5, 5 H 2 O) has been shown to exist. The dihydrogen phosphate Fe(H 2 PO 4) 2, 2 H 2 O (or FeO, P 2 O 5, 4 H 2 O) described by Erlenmeyer has been confirmed. It is thought that the ferrous phosphates are not complex. By the oxidatiod of phase mixtures poor in acid a red-brown ferric phosphate betaFe 2 O 3, P 2 O 5, 4 H 2 O is deposited, which is only stable when ferrous iron is present in the liquid phase (at 70 °). By completing the oxidation the substance changes both in crystalline form and colour (to pink) to a solid having the same empirical composition. It is thought 2 that the latter is a complex ferri-phosphate, whilst the former is a true ferric phosphate. (II) An Aeparatus for the Viscosimetric Determination of Transition Points. By means of an apparatus combining the functions of a viscometer and a stirrer the transition points Na 2 SO 4, 10 ↔ OH 2 O, NiSO 4, 7 ↔ 6 H 2 O, and Na 2 HPO 4, 12 ↔ 7 H 2 O have been determined.

Three compounds occur as mineral : vivianite n = 8, ludlamite n = 4 and phosphoferrite n = 3. By hydrothermal synthesis with vivianite as starting material we have synthetised the other minerals as well as three new species : (A) Fe 3 (PO 4) 2 (H 2 O) 4, (A) Fe 3 (PO 4) 2 (H 2 O) 3, dimorphous to the minerals ludlamite and phosphoferrite respectively, and the monohydrate Fe 3 (PO 4) 2 (H 2 O). Mössbauer spectra shows that in the three mineral species and in (A) Fe 3 (PO 4) 2 (H 2 O) 3 the Fe 2 + ion occupies two crystallographic non-equivalent sites with relative population 2 : 1. In the synthetized compounds (A) Fe 3 (PO 4) 2 (H 2 O) 4, Fe 3 (PO 4) 2 (H 2 O) the three sites of the Fe 2 + ion are none quivalent. Of the new synthetized species only for the monohydrate the three dimensional structure has been determined (P. B. Moore, personal communication). The three sites for Fe 2 + are non-equivalent, Fe(1) and Fe(3) are distorted octahedra but Fe(2) is only five coordinated, a distorted square pyramid. Octahedra edge sharing {{is one of the}} main features of this unusual structure. The correlation of the Mössbauer parameters (Q. S. I. S.) with the hydration number n indicates that with decreasing number of coordinated H 2 O molecules the parameters also decrease, as is observed in other series of hydrated iron compounds. With Fe 3 (PO 4) 2. 3 H 2 O on starting material we have prepared by oxydation a polycrystalline sample of synthetic Krizhanovskite Fe 2 +Fe 3 + 2 (PO 4) 2 (OH) - 2 (H 2 O). In the temperature range between 80 K and 300 K the Mössbauer spectra show a perfect cationic ordering, with the Fe 2 + and Fe 3 + ions occupying different crystallographic sites. At temperatures below TN = 162. 5 K, the spectra show the presence of a long range magnetic ordering together with a local quadrupolar interaction at the Fe 2 + sites of the same order of magnitude. The spectra have been interpreted following the analytical method proposed by Williams and Bancroft (Chem. Phys. Lett. 2 (1969) 110) and recalculated by us for the case I = 3 / 2 leading to slightly different final equations. The temperature dependence of the hyperfine magnetic fields H for the Fe 3 + and Fe 2 + follows the familiar law H ∝ (1 - T/TN) β. The experimental data can be fitted with TN = 162. 5 ± 2. 5 K and β = 0. 25 ± 0. 01. It is important to note that the values of these parameters are the same, for the two sets of Fe ions, within the accuracy of our experimental data...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this work}} was to {{determine}} whether a mechanism exists for bacterial oxidation of covellite (CuS) other than that involving cyclic reduction and oxidation of soluble iron, and to describe any such mechanism. It was thought likely that mechanisms of bacterial attack on CuS would also apply to other metal sulphides. High purity covellite was synthesized by the thermal reaction of sulphur and copper. Thiobacillus cultures were obtained from other workers and from the natural environment, and enriched for sulphide oxidizing capability. 	Oxygen consumption was monitored polarographically. Soluble copper, sulphate and total iron were assayed by Atomic Absorption Spectrophotometry while ferrous ion was determind spectrophotometrically as a complex with orthophenanthroline. 	By rapid specific inhibition of biological activity during sulphide oxidation, the contribution of bacteria to the stoichiometry of oxidation was determined. At pH 2. 5 the product of either biological (Thiobaccillus ferrooxidans) or non-biological oxidation was CuSO 4, the biological rate exceeding the non-biological rate about a hundredfold. At pH 4. 5 T. thioparus was incapable of oxidizing CuS itself but catalysed attack by oxygen (about fivefold) by oxidizing a sulphur passivation film which formed by reaction of CuS with oxygen. The nett result was again CuSO 4 production. 	At pH 2. 5 three strains of T. ferrooxidans oxidized CuS itself without the aid of ferric ion; a fourth strain (BJR-V- 1) was completely dependent on ferric ion or dissolved oxygen to oxidize CuS to sulphur. 	In situations where dissolved oxygen initiated the oxidation of CuS, the oxidation rate was approximately first order with respect to dissolved oxygen, while zero order kinetics were observed when other mechanisms predominated. 	In dilution experiments designed to demonstrate the dependence of sulphide oxidation (to sulphate) on physical contact between bacteria and mineral surfaces, no dependence was observed. It was concluded that water soluble intermediate were involved in CuS oxidation by T. ferrooxidans and in sulphur transport to the cells of T. ferrooxidans and T. thioparus. Arguments were advanced suggesting that the intermediates were inorganic and the concentration of intermediates was estimated from experimental results and the theory if diffusion. 	The process of CuS passivation was studied; consumption of oxygen and acid, and production of cupric ion and sulphate were measured, the results indicating that passivation resulted from the accumulation of approximately 30 micromole of elemental sulphur per square metre of CuS. Oxygen consumed during depassivation by thiobacilli supported this conclusion. Assuming an even distribution of sulphur over the surface, the film was calculated to be one or two atoms thick. 	From consideration of {{the results of this study}} it was proposed that polythionates may be involved both in CuS oxidation by bacteria and in transport of sulphur into bacterial cells. 	The role of iron was investigated. Chemically synthesized ferric ion was less effective in CuS oxidation than was ferric ion produced by T. ferrooxidans strain BJR-V- 1 through oxidation of ferrous ion. 	The half saturation ferrous ion concentration with respect to oxidation by each of the T. ferrooxidans strains was approximately 10 - 5 molar, in contrast to values of 10 - 2 molar reported by others. Further ferrous oxidation kinetic experiments with strain BJR-V- 1 indicated that the major substrate for the rate limiting reaction in ferrous oxidation was a <b>ferrous</b> <b>phosphate</b> complex; a sulphate complex also played a part...|$|E

Giles and Anopheles varunaIyengar, were investigated during August–September 1997 and July 1998 at the Upper Yan Oyawatershed in north-central Sri Lanka. Methods: The physico-chemical parameters measured were: temperature, dissolved oxygen, pH, conductivity,total dissolved solids, alkalinity, ammonia nitrogen, nitrate nitrogen, calcium, magnesium,carbondioxide, <b>ferrous</b> iron, <b>phosphate,</b> colour and turbidity. In total, 75. 5 % of 151 samples analysedwere mosquito-positive. Logistic regression {{was used for}} statistical analysis. Results: Among physico-chemical parameters, An. culicifacies (the major malaria vector in the country) was positively related only to temperature, and An. varuna (a secondary malaria vector) tocalcium. Among habitat characteristics, An. culicifacies was associated with light and vegetation, andnegatively associated {{with the presence of}} potential predators. An. varuna was positively associatedwith other aquatic fauna. Interpretation & conclusion: Surprisingly this detailed study did not find an association betweenAn. culicifacies and dissolved oxygen as previously found in the few studies that have looked atphysico-chemical {{characteristics of}} malaria vector breeding habitats in south Asia. This study, alongwith existing information from other studies indicate that most of the physico-chemical parametersmeasured under natural conditions within the same habitat type is insufficient to explain the distributionof vectors within such habitats. However, it seems likely that both An. culicifacies and An. varuna follow a strategy whereby ovipositing females scatter their eggs over most of or all of a highlytemporary and only transiently available stream bed pool habitat, in order to optimise breedingsuccess...|$|R
40|$|Vivianite, Fe 3 (PO 4) 2 · 8 H 2 O, is a <b>ferrous</b> iron <b>phosphate</b> mineral {{which forms}} in {{waterlogged}} soils and sediments. The phosphorus (P) bound in its crystal lattice {{is considered to}} be immobilised because vivianite is stable under anoxic, reducing, sedimentary conditions. Thus, vivianite formation can make a major contribution to P retention during early diagenesis. Much remains unknown about vivianite in sediments, because technical challenges have rendered direct identification and quantification difficult. To identify vivianite and assess its significance for P burial during early diagenesis we studied the consequences of a 1992 / 1993 in-lake application of FeCl 3 and Fe(OH) 3 aimed at restoring Lake Groß-Glienicke (Berlin, Germany). In a novel approach, we firstly applied a heavy-liquid separation to the iron-rich surface sediments which allowed direct identification of vivianite by X-ray diffraction in the high-density (ρ > 2. 3 g cm − 3) sediment fraction. Secondly, we assessed the contribution of vivianite to P retention, combining results from chemical digestion with magnetic susceptibility data derived from magnetic hysteresis measurements. Scanning electron microscopy revealed that the dark blue spherical vivianite nodules were 40 – 180 μm in diameter, and formed of platy- and needle-shaped crystal aggregates. Although equilibrium calculations indicated supersaturation of vivianite throughout the upper 30 cm of the sediment, the vivianite deposits were homogeneously distributed within, and restricted to, the upper 23 cm only. Thus, supersaturated pore water alone cannot serve as a reliable predictor for the in situ formation of vivianite. In Lake Groß -Glienicke, vivianite formation continues to be triggered by the artificial iron amendment more than 20 yr ago, significantly contributing to P retention in surface sediments...|$|R
40|$|Biogeochemical {{transformation}} (inclusive of dissolution) of iron (hydr) oxides {{resulting from}} dissimilatory reduction has a pronounced {{impact on the}} fate and transport of nutrients and contaminants in subsurface environments. Despite the reactivity noted for pristine (unreacted) minerals, iron (hydr) oxides within native environments will likely have a different reactivity owing in part to changes in surface composition. Accordingly, here we explore the impact of surface modifications induced by phosphate adsorption on ferrihydrite reduction by Shewanella putrefaciens under static and advective flow conditions. Alterations in surface reactivity induced by phosphate changes the extent, decreasing Fe(III) reduction nearly linearly with increasing P surface coverage, and pathway of iron biomineralization. Magnetite is the most appreciable mineralization product while minor amounts of vivianite and green rust-like phases are formed in systems having high aqueous concentrations of <b>phosphate,</b> <b>ferrous</b> iron, and bicarbonate. Goethite and lepidocrocite, characteristic biomineralization products at low ferrous-iron concentrations, are inhibited {{in the presence of}} adsorbed phosphate. Thus, deviations in iron (hydr) oxide reactivity with changes in surface composition, such as those noted here for phosphate, need to be considered within natural environments...|$|R
40|$|AbstractIn this article, {{we review}} the nature, {{occurrence}} and environmental {{relevance of the}} authigenic <b>ferrous</b> iron <b>phosphate</b> mineral vivianite (Fe 3 (PO 4) 2 · 8 H 2 O) in waterlogged soils and aquatic sediments. We critically discuss existing work from freshwater and marine systems, laboratory studies and microbial batch culture experiments aiming to deduce common characteristics of the mineral's occurrence, and the processes governing its formation. Vivianite regularly occurs in close association with organic remains in iron-rich sediments. Simultaneously, it is a biogenic mineral product of metal reducing bacteria. These findings suggest that vivianite nucleation in natural systems is directed by the activity of such bacteria and crystal growth is particularly favoured within protected microzones. Taking into account recent findings from coastal marine sediments where vivianite authigenesis {{has been shown to}} be coupled to the anaerobic oxidation of methane, small-scale microbially mediated reactions appear to be crucial for the formation of vivianite. Small-scale heterogeneity within the sediment matrix may also explain why saturation calculations based upon bulk pore water constitutions often fail to accurately predict the occurrence of the mineral. Vivianite is not restricted to a specific trophic state of a system. The mineral forms in oligotrophic- as well as in eutrophic waters. However, depending on the iron inventory, the production, supply and degradation of organic matter determine the relative contribution of iron sulphide formation to the iron pool, and the concentration of inorganic phosphate and Fe 2 + in pore waters. Thus, vivianite authigenesis is also governed by bulk chemical conditions such as the rate of sulphide formation relative to that of Fe 2 + production. This situation allows stimulation of vivianite formation by iron supplementation aimed at restoring eutrophic lakes. Recent results from coastal marine sediments suggest that vivianite authigenesis is of significance for P burial in the marine realm. Vivianite authigenesis is likely important at the global scale, but has so far largely been ignored...|$|R
30|$|However, {{the fresh}} poultry waste may contain an {{inappropriate}} C/N ratio, pathogens, an improper amount of plant nutrients, annoying odors and its application may {{slow down the}} germination of seed, lessen the growth of plant and harm the crops by rivaling for oxygen or may cause phytotoxicity to plants due to scarcity in organic matter (Chaudhry et al. 2013). Due to these concerns, the demand for humification and high cost of synthetic fertilizer, farmers prefer to adopt the organic farming techniques. Composting is a low investment technology that can transform organic waste into valuable organic matter through bio-oxidation which enhances the quality of soil for plant growth by augmenting aeration, water status, micro- and macronutrients. The compost production in Pakistan is of low quality for plants and its efficiency is also extremely poor. Therefore, it is the need of the hour to enrich the poultry waste materials for maximum nutrient availability to plants and reduce the time of humification through microbial activity. An extensive literature survey was conducted and {{it was found that}} many scientists have studied the impact of enrichment on a variety of wastes and found encouraging results during humification, nutrients’ dynamic, plant toxicity and humification/decomposition time. They used ash, lime, rock <b>phosphate,</b> <b>ferrous</b> sulfate, calcium hydroxide and peroxide (Nishanth and Biswas 2008; Himanen and Hannieen 2009; Iqbal et al. 2010, 2015, 2016; Yadav et al. 2017). Moreover, composting of poultry waste in Pakistan is currently not conducted scientifically by private contractors, where it takes 4 months to produce compost for use and their humification quality is still ambiguous. Therefore, the present study was conducted to examine the influence of aluminum sulfate and rock phosphate on poultry waste humification and uptake of compost nutrients by Abelmoschus esculentus (ladyfinger) plants in pot and incubation study.|$|R

Various pattern morphologies such as periodic bands, dendritic crystals, and continuous precipitates can be formed in many types of diffusion media. We hypothesized that interfering ions that {{are not part of}} the dominant precipitation reaction could affect the formation of self-organized patterns in a reproducible fashion, and that the same precipitation reaction occurring in different diffusion media would produce different pattern morphologies (depending on the physical and chemical properties of that medium).; To initially characterize the patterns formed by various diffusion/reaction systems, we performed experiments with <b>ferrous</b> carbonate, <b>phosphate,</b> and hydroxide precipitation in agarose gel. Ferrous compounds were precipitated under reducing conditions, forming self-organized patterns such as periodic bands, and were subsequently oxidized as atmospheric oxygen diffused into the gel. Mineral replacement occurred upon introduction of a reactant that formed a more insoluble compound than the one already present, and after replacement the banding pattern remained unaltered, allowing identification of the original precipitate.; We also characterized the effects of the diffusion medium and interfering ions on self-organized precipitation in silver nitrate/potassium chromate and silver nitrate/potassium dichromate reaction systems. We observed that precipitate morphology was characteristic of the reactants that were initially present and the type of gel medium in which they precipitated. It was found that soluble impurities in agarose gel were responsible for the slight banding produced in silver chromate precipitation experiments. We then tested the effects of organic compounds (simple amino acids and their N-acetylated derivatives) on morphologies of silver chromate precipitates in purified agarose gel. High concentrations of pure amino acids caused periodic banding of crystals, and N-acetyl amino acids were more effective than pure amino acids, because of their negative charge. We hypothesized that the length and orientation of the neutral side chain of the amino acids, as well as charge, affects the degree of binding to the crystal surface, and hence the ability to induce banded patterns.; To better apply these studies to self-organized patterns that form in natural systems, where the diffusion medium may be inhomogeneous (such as sand or sandstone), we studied laboratory and field examples of self-organized mineral precipitates in porous media. Silver chromate precipitation experiments in tubes of glass beads and glass bead/gel mixtures produced structures such as finger fluid fronts, periodic banding, and millimeter-size spherules. The spheroidal precipitates produced in our experiments nucleated via self-organizing processes throughout the glass bead medium, and bear morphological resemblance to iron oxide concretions formed via self-organizing processes in the Navajo Sandstone, UT, that preserve records of fluid flow events in a porous and permeable sandstone...|$|R
40|$|Aerial {{oxidation}} of dopamine at concentrations {{as low as}} 50 mu M in {{the presence}} of <b>ferrous</b> ions in <b>phosphate</b> buffer (pH 7. 4) led in the early stages (6 - 8 h) to the formation of the quinone of the neurotoxin B-hydroxydopamine, 2, followed (24 h) by a complex product pattern comprising main components norepinephrine (5), 3, 4 -dihydroxybenzaldehyde (4), and the neurotoxic alkaloid 6, 7 -dihydroxy- 1, 2, 3, 4 -tetrahydroisoquinoline (3). Product formation required the assistance of metal ions such as Mn(II), Zn(II), and iron, in either the ferrous or ferric form. Product yields were shown to vary linearly with iron and dopamine concentration in the early phases of the reaction (2 h). Biologically relevant antioxidants, like glutathione and ascorbate, and metal chelators, e. g., 2, 2 '-bipyridyl, inhibited dopamine conversion to products 2 - 5, but not substrate consumption, while hydroxyl radical scavengers such as DMSO and mannitol did not alter the course of the reaction. On the contrary, mannitol increased product yields, an effect seen for other monosaccharides. Catalase exhibited a significant inhibitory effect particularly on the formation of 3 and 4. By using O- 18 (2), evidence was obtained for incorporation of the label into the carbonyl oxygen of 4, but not into the hydroxyl group of 5. On the basis of these and other results, a complete mechanistic picture of the oxidation is drawn involving conversion of dopamine to the corresponding o-quinone and its quinonemethide tautomer with concomitant reduction of Oa to H 2 O 2 Nucleophilic attack by H 2 O to the quinonemethide gives rise to 5, while H 2 O 2 addition leads to benzaldehyde 4 via a beta-amino-hydroperoxide intermediate. This latter reaction path also gives formaldehyde which yields the isoquinoline 3 by Pictet-Spengler condensation with dopamine. The quinone 2 results from H 2 O 2 attack at the 6 -position of dopamine o-quinone in agreement with previous studies. These results provide an insight into new routes of nonenzymatic conversion of dopamine to its metabolite norepinephrine and neurotoxic species which may become operative under conditions relevant to neurodegeneration...|$|R
