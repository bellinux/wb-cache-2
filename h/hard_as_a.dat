5|$|The {{concept of}} Lightning Returns {{originated}} during development of XIII-2, while the development team was brainstorming ideas for possible continuations {{of the story}} and universe of the games, though there was no solid decision to make a second sequel to XIII at the time. Development of Lightning Returns started in May 2012, soon after the release of Requiem of the Goddess, the final story-based DLC episode for XIII-2. According to Motomu Toriyama, he had wanted to tell more stories about Lightning, and the DLC had not provided a satisfactory ending for her. The game was designed in a shorter time than the other games in the series; Yoshinori Kitase explained that this was because the team did not want players to forget the story of the previous games, and the team needed to work especially <b>hard</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> result. Another reason was that the team wished to bring the XIII series to a close before the release of the next generation of gaming hardware. The title was also chosen to be the last original Final Fantasy game on seventh generation consoles, and next-gen versions of the game were not considered. Developer tri-Ace, who had previously worked with the team on XIII-2, returned to help with the graphics.|$|E

25|$|Qazi Muhammad's {{internal}} support eventually declined, {{especially among the}} Kurdish tribes who had supported him initially. Their crops and supplies were dwindling, and {{their way of life}} was becoming <b>hard</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> result of the isolation. Economic aid and military assistance from the Soviet Union was gone, and the tribes saw no reason to support him. The townspeople and the tribes had a large divide between them, and their alliance for Mahabad was crumbling. The tribes and their leaders had only supported Qazi Muhammad for his economic and military aid from the Soviet Union. Once that was gone, many did not see any reason to support him. Other tribes resented the Barzanis, since they did not like sharing their already dwindling resources with them. Some Kurds deserted Mahabad, including one of Mahabad's own marshals, Amir Khan. Mahabad was economically bankrupt, {{and it would have been}} nearly impossible for Mahabad to have been economically sound without harmony with Iran.|$|E

2500|$|The Monday night fight {{lived up}} to its billing. In a preview of their two other fights, a crouching, bobbing and weaving Frazier {{constantly}} pressured Ali, getting hit regularly by Ali jabs and combinations, but relentlessly attacking and scoring repeatedly, especially to Ali's body. The fight was even in the early rounds, but Ali was taking more punishment than ever in his career. On several occasions in the early rounds he played to the crowd and shook his head [...] "no" [...] after he was hit. In the later rounds—in what was the first appearance of the [...] "rope-a-dope strategy"—Ali leaned against the ropes and absorbed punishment from Frazier, hoping to tire him. In the 11th round, Frazier connected with a left hook that wobbled Ali, but because it appeared that Ali might be clowning as he staggered backwards across the ring, Frazier hesitated to press his advantage, fearing an Ali counter-attack. In the final round, Frazier knocked Ali down with a vicious left hook, which referee Arthur Mercante said was as <b>hard</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> man can be hit. Ali was back on his feet in three seconds. Nevertheless, Ali lost by unanimous decision, his first professional defeat.|$|E
2500|$|In July 1941 the 8th Hussars, in Stuart tanks, {{were part}} of the 4th Armoured Brigade for Operation Crusader. During the three-day Battle of Sidi Rezegh Airfield, the {{regiment}} had formed a box leaguer for the night-time lull in fighting {{with the rest of the}} brigade on 22 November (as neither side had night vision aids, battle normally ceased at dusk). The leaguer was discovered by the 15th Panzer Division during the night and in the ensuing engagement left the Irish Hussars with just four Stuart Tanks fit for battle; 35 having been captured or destroyed. The regiment was issued 32 new Stuarts at Cairo and, under the command of Major Sandbach the regiment returned to the battle. On 1 December, to assist ANZAC forces the regiment charged [...] "cavalry style" [...] again at Sidi Rezegh and although the action was [...] successful, Major Sandbach was killed. Command then fell to Major Phillips. After a re-fit and influx of recruits at Beni Yusef the 8th Hussars were temporarily converted to armoured cars but before seeing action in them were issued with new tanks. [...] A & B Squadrons with the General Grant and C Squadron in Stuarts, all under the command of Lt Col Gerald [...] "Smash" [...] Kilkelly. Once again part of the 4th Armoured Brigade with which it served during the Gazala battles of May and June 1942, suffering heavy losses at the Battle of Knightsbridge in which Major Hackett was severely burnt and Colonel Kilkelly captured, and also battles at Bardia and Bir Hacheim. The 8th fought <b>hard</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> composite unit with the 4th City of London Yeomanry (casualties having reduced the size of both regiments) before having to withdraw with the rest of the British Eighth Army to El Alamein. In June, the remnants of the regiment under command of Lieutenant Colonel [...] "Cuthie" [...] Goulbourn detached one squadron to their future partners the 4th Queen's Own Hussars to form a temporary regiment called the 4th/8th Hussars. The brigade, including the 8th and the 4th/8th faced the massive enemy onslaught at Alam Halfa, defeating the enemy. They helped breach the minefields at the Second Battle of El Alamein and then joined the pursuit for three weeks. The regiment then enjoyed a short tour in Cyprus before returning to England.|$|E
2500|$|The poor 2009 {{record of}} Tampa Bay {{was in part}} due to a youthful, inexperienced team (barring a few {{exceptions}} such as 35-year-old CB Ronde Barber, the last remaining member of the 2002 Super Bowl team), and it was hoped that they would improve with time. The Buccaneers got off to a 2-0 start in 2010 by beating Cleveland and Carolina, but both were weak opponents and they proved unable to handle Pittsburgh, a team that was only two years removed from its 2008 Super Bowl win, losing 38-13. Following their bye week, they beat the Bengals in Cincinnati 24-21. [...] After the road victory in Cincinnati, the Bucs came home to face the defending Super Bowl champion Saints, who were struggling after a loss to the Arizona Cardinals in which the Cardinals did not score an offensive touchdown, but capitalized on New Orleans turnovers. [...] A victory would have helped the Bucs towards first place in the NFC South; however, they were blown out 31-6. [...] The next week saw another home deficit against the St. Louis Rams with the Bucs trailing 6-17 at halftime. [...] Strong defense shut down the Rams offense in the second half, and with two field goals and a late touchdown pass to Carnell [...] "Cadillac" [...] Williams, the Bucs topped the Rams 18-17. [...] After the game with the team standing at 4-2, head coach Raheem Morris would famously state, [...] "We're {{the best team in the}} NFC." [...] The following week, the Bucs would make good on Morris's claim by defeating the Arizona Cardinals on the road in a game where they led 31-14, [...] fell behind late 35-31, then retook the lead 38-35 and sealed the victory with an Aqib Talib interception of Cardinals quarterback Derek Anderson near the end zone. [...] With the Bucs and the Atlanta Falcons tied for first place in the division at 5-2, a matchup in Atlanta gave the Bucs a chance to take sole possession of first place. [...] Trailing 27-14 in the second half, Bucs returner Micheal Spurlock returned a Falcons kickoff for a touchdown to put the Bucs within a touchdown of the lead. [...] The game came down to fourth down attempt to score from the Falcons 1 yard-line. Rookie running back LeGarrette Blount was stopped up the middle and gave the Falcons the close victory. [...] Following the tough loss, the Bucs came home and defeated the Carolina Panthers 31-16 before going on the road against the San Francisco 49ers and pitching a 21-0 shutout. [...] The next week, the Bucs road game against the Baltimore Ravens, their fourth game away from Raymond James Stadium in five weeks, was moved to a late start, and the Bucs lost a hard-fought defensive struggle 17-10. [...] Finally returning home the next week, the team sported their throwback creamsicle uniforms and honored coach John McKay at halftime in a home contest against the Falcons on national television. [...] With a great defensive performance and two interceptions of Falcons quarterback Matt Ryan, it seemed the Bucs would get revenge on the Falcons for their loss four weeks ago, leading 24-14 deep in the second half. [...] But Falcons returner Eric Weems returned a kick for a touchdown and the Falcons scored offensively to take a 28-24 lead. [...] Quarterback Josh Freeman attempted the late comeback as he had against the Browns, Bengals, Rams, and Cardinals, but was denied with a Brent Grimes interception. [...] At 7-5, the Bucs' playoff hopes seemed less assured, and the team had yet to defeat an opponent with a winning record, while several key starters had been lost for the season. [...] In a rainy outing at Washington, the Bucs prevailed 17-16 thanks to a botched extra-point attempt by the Redskins, but lost to the Detroit Lions at home in overtime to break the Lions' historic road losing streak. [...] Needing help to make the playoffs as a wild-card team, the Bucs routed the eventual NFC West champion Seattle Seahawks 38-15 in Tampa. [...] With the last week of the regular season on the slate, the Bucs needed to defeat the New Orleans Saints in the Superdome, then hope for the defeats of the Green Bay Packers and the New York Giants by the Chicago Bears and Washington Redskins, respectively, as both teams held playoff tiebreakers over the Buccaneers. [...] The Saints planned to fight the Bucs equally <b>hard,</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> victory and a Falcons loss to the Carolina Panthers would give them the #1 seed in the NFC. [...] The game was close and hard-fought throughout the first half, but two key turnovers by the Bucs defense, a Barrett Ruud forced fumble of Saints running back Julius Jones near the Bucs' goal line and an interception of Saints quarterback Drew Brees near the end of the half, gave the Bucs the slight edge. [...] A Saints field goal in the fourth quarter cut the Tampa Bay lead to 20-13, but with the Falcons holding a large lead over the Panthers, Saints coach Sean Payton chose to sit Brees and put in backup Chase Daniel. [...] The Bucs held on and won the game 23-13, finishing the season with a 10-6 record, their best since 2005. [...] However, the Packers and Giants both won close games as well, thus sending the eventual Super Bowl champion Packers to the playoffs. [...] For the second time in three years, the Bucs had finished with a winning record, yet missed the playoffs. [...] The season marked a 7-game improvement over the previous one, and was highlighted by the superb play of second-year quarterback Josh Freeman and a strong rookie class led by Gerald McCoy, Arrelious Benn, Mike Williams, Cody Grimm, and LeGarrette Blount. [...] No Buccaneers were selected to the Pro Bowl, but left tackle Donald Penn did play in the game as a replacement for Green Bay's Chad Clifton, marking Penn's first appearance. [...] Raheem Morris finished second in AP NFL Coach of the Year voting, and Mike Williams finished second in Offensive Rookie of the Year voting.|$|E
