5|$|An {{approach}} to supporting the possibility premise in Plantinga's {{version of the}} argument was attempted by Alexander R. Pruss. He started with the 8th–9th century AD Indian philosopher Sankara's dictum that if something is impossible, we cannot have a perception (even a non-veridical one) {{that it is the}} case. It follows that <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> a perception that p, then even though it might not be the case that p, it is at least the case that possibly p. If mystics in fact perceive the existence of a maximally great being, it follows that the existence of a maximally great being is at least possible.|$|E

25|$|In {{the light}} of King's {{powerful}} demagogic speech yesterday he stands {{head and shoulders above}} all other Negro leaders put together when it comes to influencing great masses of Negroes.

25|$|Generally, <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> n data points, {{there is}} exactly one {{polynomial}} of degree at most n1 {{going through all}} the data points. The interpolation error {{is proportional to the}} distance between the data points to the power n. Furthermore, the interpolant is a polynomial and thus infinitely differentiable. So, we see that polynomial interpolation overcomes most of the problems of linear interpolation.|$|E
25|$|<b>If</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> a {{principal}} bundle over the manifold M with G as the structure group, and we pick X to be a covariant vector field as {{section of the}} tangent space of the principal bundle (i.e. it has horizontal and vertical components), then the covariant Lie derivative is just the Lie derivative with respect to X over the principal bundle.|$|E

25|$|<b>If</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> any unitary {{representation}} of a group G on a Hilbert space H then the bounded operators commuting with G form a von Neumann algebra G, whose projections correspond exactly to the closed subspaces of H invariant under G. Equivalent subrepresentations correspond to equivalent projections in G. The double commutant G of G is also a von Neumann algebra.|$|E
25|$|The {{dictionary}} learning framework, {{namely the}} linear decomposition of an input signal using a few basis elements learned from data itself, {{has led to}} state-of-art results in various image and video processing tasks. This technique {{can be applied to}} classification problems in a way that <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> built specific dictionaries for each class, the input signal can be classified by finding the dictionary corresponding to the sparsest representation.|$|E
25|$|What {{this means}} is that even <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> {{extracted}} all possible energy from a Fermi gas by cooling it to near absolute zero temperature, the fermions are still moving around at a high speed. The fastest ones are moving at a velocity corresponding to a kinetic energy equal to the Fermi energy. This is the Fermi velocity. Only when the temperature exceeds the Fermi temperature do the electrons begin to move significantly faster than at absolute zero.|$|E

Following a court settlement, the BSA used Ernie Ball/Music Man as an example in advertisements and industry publications; Sterling Ball was so offended at this treatment that he had all Microsoft software removed from Ernie Ball/Music Man ("I don't care <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> to buy 10,000 abacuses,") and imposed an open-source software policy across the company.|$|E
25|$|Bridge 8: Euler walks are {{possible}} if exactly zero or two nodes have an odd number of edges. <b>If</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> 2 nodes {{with an odd}} number of edges, the walk must begin at one such node and end at the other. Since there are only 4 nodes in the puzzle, the solution is simple. The walk desired must begin at the blue node and end at the orange node. Thus, a new edge is drawn between the other two nodes. Since they each formerly had an odd number of edges, they must now have an even number of edges, fulfilling all conditions. This {{is a change in}} parity from an odd to even degree.|$|E
25|$|This allows all the {{language}} and theory of vector spaces (or more generally, modules) {{to be brought to}} bear. For example, the collection of all possible linear combinations of the vectors on the left-hand side is called their span, and the equations have a solution just when the right-hand vector is within that span. If every vector within that span has exactly one expression as a linear combination of the given left-hand vectors, then any solution is unique. In any event, the span has a basis of linearly independent vectors that do guarantee exactly one expression; and the number of vectors in that basis (its dimension) cannot be larger than m or n, but it can be smaller. This is important because <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> m independent vectors a solution is guaranteed regardless of the right-hand side, and otherwise not guaranteed.|$|E

I also appeal for a spirit of reconciliation and forgiveness amongst us all...Our beautiful country has been nicknamed `The Warm Heart of Africa' and we have been admired for our warmth and spirit of hardwork. This admiration calls not only for a need for us to look at our past and present and draw lessons from it, but there is even a greater need for us to look forward to the future in our endeavours to reconstruct and reconcile <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> to move forward at all.|$|E
25|$|A soldier whose {{business}} is murder {{as a fine}} art, a diplomat whose calling is based on deception and secretiveness, a politician whose very life consists in compromises with his conscience, a business man whose aim is personal profit within the limits allowed by a lenient law—such may be excused if they set patriotic deception above common everyday decency and perform services as spies. They merely accept the code of morality to which modern society still conforms. Not so the scientist. The very essence of his life is the service of truth. We all know scientists who in private life do not {{come up to the}} standard of truthfulness, but who, nevertheless, would not consciously falsify the results of their researches. It is bad enough <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> to put up with these, because they reveal a lack of strength of character that is liable to distort the results of their work. A person, however, who uses science as a cover for political spying, who demeans himself to pose before a foreign government as an investigator and asks for assistance in his alleged researches in order to carry on, under this cloak, his political machinations, prostitutes science in an unpardonable way and forfeits the right to be classed as a scientist.|$|E
25|$|Multisocket {{adaptors}} {{allow the}} connection {{of two or more}} plugs to a simple socket. They are manufactured in various configurations, depending on the country and the region in which they are used, with various ratings. In Europe for example, they are called double or triple adaptors, and transform a one socket into a multiple socket. This has the advantage of connecting more than one electrical consumer item to one single socket and is mainly used for low power devices (TV sets, table lamps, computers, etc.). They are usually rated at 6A 250V, 10A 250V, or 16A 250V, however this is the general rating of the adaptor (for example, <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> an adaptor for four sockets and it is marked 16A 250V, this means that the adaptor should not be loaded more than 16A, whether one, two, three or all sockets are used. Some people overload them, thus leading to accidents). In some countries these adaptors are banned and are not available in shops, as they may lead to fires due to overloading them. In the past, these adaptors were made from ceramic, Bakelite or other fire resistant plastics, but nowadays they are made from various available plastics that can be safely used in electrical devices (such as PA6, PVC, PP). Some low quality adaptors are made from plastics not approved for electrical use (such as PS or non fire resistant ABS), and these may cause fires in the case of overheating due to overloading or bad contacts.|$|E

500|$|Associated {{with the}} fact that the {{electron}} can be polarized is another small necessary detail which is connected {{with the fact}} that an electron is a fermion and obeys Fermi–Dirac statistics. The basic rule is that <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> the probability amplitude for a given complex process involving more than one electron, then when we include (as we always must) the complementary Feynman diagram in which we just exchange two electron events, the resulting amplitude is the reverse – the negative – of the first. The simplest case would be two electrons starting at A and B ending at C and D. The amplitude would be calculated as the [...] "difference", , where we would expect, from our everyday idea of probabilities, that it would be a sum.|$|E
