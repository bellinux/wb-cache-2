25|$|From 20 June to 10 July, the {{battalion}} protected the division from anti-mechanized attack, with elements harassing the enemy with high velocity <b>interdiction</b> <b>fire.</b> All {{during this time}} the enemy was {{looking down on the}} U.S. positions from Hill 192, and kept the U.S. units covered with continual harassing mortar, artillery, and long range machine gun fire.|$|E
25|$|Turned {{over to the}} {{operational}} control of Commander, Naval Support Activity, Saigon, in April 1967, the ship commenced services to LSTs engaged in operations off {{the mouth of the}} Mekong River. During this period, the repair ship continued to provide support and maintenance facilities for craft of the Mobile Riverine Assault Force and supported Coastal Division 13 as well. Further, Tutuilas /50 caliber guns spoke in anger {{for the first time in}} the Vietnam conflict, as the ship undertook a shore bombardment in the Rung Sat Special Zone, providing harassment and <b>interdiction</b> <b>fire</b> into an area of suspected Viet Cong activity north of Vung Tau.|$|E

5000|$|For {{more than}} 15 months, John R. Pierce {{operated}} out of Norfolk along the Atlantic coast; then she departed on 15 May 1952 for {{duty in the}} Far East. Sailing via the Panama Canal, San Diego and Pearl Harbor, she arrived Yokosuka, Japan on 18 June. With Commander O. C. Foote, Jr. in command, she sailed on 20 June for blockade and bombardment operations against Communist forces along {{the east coast of}} Korea. From Chongjin to Songjin, she conducted <b>interdiction</b> <b>firing</b> and [...] "anti-mine, anti-junk and anti-fishing" [...] patrols. While engaging enemy shore batteries at Songjin on 6 August, she sustained three hits from enemy <b>fire,</b> but continued <b>interdiction</b> patrols until 11 October. She then departed for the United States via the Indian Ocean, Suez and Gibraltar, arriving Norfolk 12 December.|$|R
25|$|During {{the early}} morning of 16 April 1917 the Nivelle Offensive was launched. In the sector where the tanks {{operated}} the initial waves of French infantry succeeded in taking {{the first and second}} German trenches as planned, but with very heavy losses. The French artillery was insufficient in number to simultaneously sustain the creeping barrage and suppress the numerous German artillery batteries. This was aggravated by the German air superiority which allowed artillery observation planes to precisely direct German <b>interdiction</b> <b>fire</b> on the advancing French columns. Groupement Chaubès suffered many losses before it was even able to leave the French lines. When arriving at the frontline in the early afternoon, it had to assist the infantry in clearing the second trench of the last German remnants. These did not panic {{at the sight of the}} French tanks but had been trained to hide from them, leaving their cover to engage the French infantry when the armoured vehicles had moved on. At the end of the day, the French infantry proved unable to continue the offensive and the last surviving French tanks had to be withdrawn. More to the east, north of Berry-au-Bac after which village later the entire tank action would be named, Groupement Bossut proved more successful. It managed to cross the various trench lines losing only a few vehicles and in the late morning concentrated to carry on the offensive. However, around 11:00 the tank of Bossut, Trompe-la-Mort ("Dare-devil") leading the advance, carrying a tricolour fanion blessed in the Sacré-Cœur at Montmartre, received a direct heavy artillery hit, incinerating most of the crew and blowing Bossut himself from the rear entrance from which he had been directing the battle, killed by a shell splinter through the heart. Nevertheless, the Schneiders continued their progress, advancing several miles in a narrow penetration through a shallow valley towards the third German trench. The weakened infantry though, was unable to follow, forcing the tanks to wait for the arrival of reserve units. For several hours the tanks moved up and down the conquered terrain to avoid presenting static targets for the German artillery. Despite this many vehicles were hit, as they were in plain sight of German batteries on the surrounding hills. Flank assaults by Bavarian stormtroopers were repulsed. In the early evening, fresh infantry units together with the tanks conquered a sector of the third trench, marking the high tide of the French progress during the entire Second Battle of the Aisne. The Schneiders then withdrew, again suffering losses by artillery fire.|$|E
500|$|The same Stuka {{bombardment}} {{that had}} put Brigade B to rout also broke {{the morale of}} the reserves at Rhenen. In the morning these troops had already shown severe discipline problems, with units disintegrating and leaving the battlefield because of German <b>interdiction</b> <b>fire.</b> In the late afternoon most of 4th Infantry Division was fleeing westwards. The Germans had expected that the Dutch would attempt to plug any gaps in the line and indeed it had been planned to shift to the north two regiments of the Dutch 3rd Army Corps for this purpose. But Dutch command now suffered such a loss of control that any thoughts to re-establish a continuous front had to be abandoned. A [...] wide gap had appeared in the defences. Fearing that otherwise they would be encircled, at 20:30 Van Voorst tot Voorst ordered the three Army Corps to immediately abandon both the Grebbe Line and the Waal-Linge Position and to retreat during the night to the East Front of Fortress Holland at the New Holland Water Line. The Germans, however, did not at once exploit their success; only around 21:00 had it become apparent to them that the gap even existed, when the renewed advance had met no enemy resistance.|$|E
2500|$|The year 1969, {{began with}} a two-week fleet service mine test at Buckner Bay. After an upkeep period in Sasebo, Woodpecker {{returned}} to sea for a joint exercise with the Japanese Maritime Self Defense Force. On 3 March 1969, the ship commenced her regularly scheduled overhaul. Sea trials, refresher training, and two inspections followed. Woodpecker sailed for Vietnam on 13 July, and began [...] "Market Time" [...] patrol. Her duties included search and rescue missions, illumination firing, plus harassment and <b>interdiction</b> <b>fire.</b> The ship returned to Sasebo on 1 October. Mine countermeasures refresher training at Buckner Bay from 10 to 22 October, {{was followed by a}} brief stay at Sasebo. From 3 to 13 November, Woodpecker joined in a mine countermeasure exercise with the Korean and British navies. Then, a dependents' cruise and a port visit to Kagoshima, Japan, ensued. The remainder of the year was spent in leave and upkeep status at Sasebo, Japan.|$|E
25|$|An ARA battery {{could perform}} {{any type of}} fire support mission {{conducted}} by conventional artillery, but with a much greater range (limited only by a helicopter's combat radius) than tube artillery. These missions included support of ground troops, landing zone (LZ) preparatory <b>fire,</b> <b>interdiction,</b> and counter-battery <b>fire.</b> In addition to normal artillery missions, the helicopters were also employed as escorts for medevac and re-supply helicopters. They also were teamed with light observation helicopters to perform tactical reconnaissance, although this mission was more commonly performed by the airmobile division's air cavalry squadron.|$|R
2500|$|US forces {{relied heavily}} on {{firepower}} {{in their attempt to}} counter Communist advantages in local concentration, organization, knowledge of the terrain, and the element of surprise in where and when to strike. The VC and NVA had no qualms about provoking US attacks and deliberately using civilians as human shields, sometimes preventing them from leaving an area under attack. Such methods yielded both practical benefits and cynical propaganda opportunities. Some American tactics however caused collateral damage and extensive destruction to the countryside, including harassment and <b>interdiction</b> <b>fires</b> (H), deployment of heavy artillery and bombs in populated areas, defoliation and the creation of [...] "free-fire" [...] zones. Some historians also maintain that generation of refugees was a systematic US tactic, recommended a number of times in official US documents and implemented by military means. One State Department memo for example suggested that [...] "Measures to encourage refugee flow might be targeted where they will hurt the VC most and embitter people toward the US/GVN forces least" [...] and Undersecretary of State Nicholas Katzenbach [...] "ordered the military to produce more refugees" [...] in the Northern I Corps sector. According to one historian: [...] "The actual generation of refugees involved three different destructive policies: intensive bombing and shelling, chemical destruction of crops and forests; and the physical removal of villages by ground troops." ...|$|R
25|$|Bait tactics {{exploited}} the US focus on body counts and its lavish use of firepower, including relatively ineffective Harassment and <b>Interdiction</b> (H) <b>fire.</b> One related method was {{to occupy a}} hamlet or deploy near it, digging into positions at the treeline on {{the perimeter of the}} hamlet for attack or defense. ARVN or US forces would often counterattack by unleashing air and artillery strikes on the community, causing destruction to the persons and property of the civilians {{they were supposed to be}} protecting. The damage done, and protected by their dug-in positions, VC and PAVN fighters melted away at their earliest convenience, later repeating the cycle elsewhere.|$|R
2500|$|On the 19 October 1944, Sigourney shelled Red and White Beaches {{to cover}} {{underwater}} demolition teams reconnoitering the landing sites near Dulag and Tacloban. She and Cony (DD-508) {{remained in the}} area while the remainder of TG77.2 withdrew to the south to cover the approaches to the Leyte Gulf through Surigao Strait. The two destroyers fired night harassing and <b>interdiction</b> <b>fire</b> on beaches, roads, and installations. On the 20th, they bombarded the beaches until H-hour and then provided call-fire support until the 24th when word was received from the Commander, 7th Fleet, {{to prepare for a}} night engagement. Sigourney, Aulick (DD-569), and Welles (DD-628) were in the van as Attack Section 2 of DesDiv [...] "X-Ray" [...] which would screen the battle line consisting of six battleships. In the screening position, they did not take part in the torpedo attacks on the Japanese fleet launched by other American destroyers. On 29 October, Sigourney withdrew from Leyte and returned to Seeadler Harbor, arriving on 3 November.|$|E

5000|$|The Korean War {{revealed}} important {{flaws in}} the application of CAS. Firstly, the USAF preferred <b>interdiction</b> over <b>fire</b> support while the Army regarded support missions as the main concern for air forces. Then, the Army advocated a degree of decentralization for good reactivity, in contrast with the USAF-favored centralization of CAS. The third point dealt with the lack of training and joint culture, which are necessary for an adequate air-ground integration. Finally, USAF aircraft were not designed for CAS: [...] "the advent of jet fighters, too fast to adjust their targets, and strategic bombers, too big to be used on theatre, rendered CAS much harder to implement".|$|R

5000|$|On 16 November, the 29th Infantry Division {{began its}} push toward the Roer River and Jülich. The {{battalion}} supported all three infantry regiments of the 29th {{as they moved}} east along an axis from Merkstein to Siersdorf to Aldenhoven to Jülich. The advance was marked by sharp engagements in each hamlet and village along the route, with the infantry and tanks having to work closely together to overcome the German defenders dug into the basements and other strongpoints in each town. In addition, the tankers had to be vigilant at night to prevent German infiltrators from moving back into the captured towns during darkness. Now defending their homeland, German resistance was stiff, and it took the 29th Infantry Division a week to cover the ten miles to the western approaches to Jülich. The 747th suffered heavy losses as well, with 18 medium tanks lost to enemy action and 38 men either killed or wounded, and another 3 missing. An additional 19 medium tanks were rendered inoperable due to mechanical failures, leaving only 9 operational medium tanks by 24 November. The battalion was withdrawn to Schleiden {{for a period of}} intensive maintenance which they referred to as a [...] "rehabilitation period" [...] until 30 November, {{at the end of which}} the 747th could still only count 20 operational medium tanks. Following this, through 11 December, the battalion rotated up to one platoon of tanks at a time, plus the headquarters company assault gun platoon, to assist the 29th Infantry Division in clearing the west bank of the Roer River opposite Jülich. Having reached the Roer, the battalion dug into position overlooking the Roer on 12 December. For the remainder of December 1944, January 1945, and the first week of February, the battalion provided platoons to support the division artillery to provide nighttime indirect harassment and <b>interdiction</b> <b>fires,</b> while the main body of the battalion reinforced their defensive positions and continued combined arms exercises with the infantry.|$|R

She cleared the Wonsan area 5 March for Songjin, where she joined in setting the siege, and until 6 June was almost constantly patrolling and firing on shore installations at Songjin. She then sailed for home, arriving at Norfolk 2 July.|$|E
5000|$|As Allied troops swarmed ashore {{two days}} later, the {{destroyer}} provided <b>interdiction</b> <b>fire</b> at Abuyog, {{south of the}} Leyte beaches, and patrolled {{the southern end of}} Leyte Gulf for the following week.

50|$|The warship was {{relieved}} on 30 April {{and returned to}} Subic Bay for upkeep. On 7 May, she got underway to the III and IV Corps areas of South Vietnam to provide gunfire support. For the next three weeks, Ault responded to requests for shore bombardment during the day, and for harassment, <b>interdiction,</b> and illumination <b>fire</b> during the night. As the only destroyer available in both Corps areas, she {{was responsible for the}} coast {{from the mouth of the}} Mekong in the IV Corps area to Vũng Tàu and Hàm Tân in the III Corps area.|$|R
25|$|For {{the next}} four days, Benham {{screened}} troop transports at sea while other warships conducted gunfire missions against enemy forces on Tinian. After the landings on 24 July, the destroyer {{spent the rest of}} the month firing at targets around Sunharon town during the day and covering Marine Corps battalions with defensive gunfire at night. Benham also closed the island in the evenings to <b>fire</b> <b>interdiction</b> missions and pound enemy gun emplacements. On 6 August, the destroyer shifted to Guam and spent four days bombarding the last Japanese positions on the northeast corner of the island. With the island declared secure on 10 August, Benham steamed east to Eniwetok for repairs alongside a tender.|$|R
50|$|Night {{harassment}} and <b>interdiction</b> <b>fire</b> against unobserved area targets comprised {{the majority of}} the missions. On some occasions, Whipple operated in conjunction with aerial spotters who directed the destroyer escort's fire on enemy troop movements, coastal defense guns, artillery sites, and tanks. During Whipples first gunfire support assignment on 11 April, the ship twice dueled enemy shore guns, with enemy shells impacting within 150 and 200 yd of the ship. For this action, Whipple received the Combat Action Ribbon.|$|E
50|$|In September 1968, 323 miles {{southeast}} of Charleston, South Carolina, while en route for a return visit to Vietnam, a fire {{broke out in the}} aft fireroom, killing three seamen and injuring five.

After extensive repairs were completed at Charleston Naval Shipyard, Fox departed again for Vietnam arriving in February 1969. From February to September, she operated in the Vietnam area on a variety of assignments which included plane-guarding in the Tonkin Gulf, and harassment and <b>interdiction</b> <b>fire</b> on a regular basis. She also operated independently providing close-in gunfire support to troops on numerous occasions.|$|E
50|$|Turned {{over to the}} {{operational}} control of Commander, Naval Support Activity, Saigon, in April 1967, the ship commenced services to LSTs engaged in operations off {{the mouth of the}} Mekong River. During this period, the repair ship continued to provide support and maintenance facilities for craft of the Mobile Riverine Assault Force and supported Coastal Division 13 as well. Further, Tutuilas 3 in/50 caliber guns spoke in anger {{for the first time in}} the Vietnam conflict, as the ship undertook a shore bombardment in the Rung Sat Special Zone, providing harassment and <b>interdiction</b> <b>fire</b> into an area of suspected Viet Cong activity north of Vung Tau.|$|E

In Vietnam, he was recognized in efforts to quantify and reduce [...] "harassment and <b>interdiction</b> fire", artillery <b>fire</b> intended to reduce enemy morale and movement. Yet in practice, it was rarely observed or checked for results and generally proved useless in countering enemy activities in a war without fronts. Kalergis developed systems to quantify and significantly reduce its use due to ineffectiveness, collateral damage to civilians and its high cost.|$|R
5000|$|On 4 March, the {{destroyer}} joined the carrier Coral Sea on [...] "Yankee Station."

Arriving at Norfolk, 2 February, she operated off the Mid-Atlantic seaboard until April, then underwent modernization at Boston. Emerging in November with the latest in anti-aircraft weaponry, fire control radar, sonar and communications gear, she became the flagship of Destroyer Division 282 (DesDiv 282). She completed further training in the Caribbean and departed Norfolk, 7 January 1953, for a tour in the Korean combat zone. Steaming via the Panama Canal, she arrived at Sasebo 11 February and on the 15th rendezvoused with TF77. Between then and 23 June she performed plane guard and screening duties for the carriers of TF77, screened battleships and cruisers during bombardment missions, and provided gunfire support, plane control, <b>interdiction</b> and harassment <b>fire,</b> and hospital ship services for United Nations Forces fighting in coastal areas, primarily near Wonsan, North Korea.|$|R

Issued also on microfiche from Lange Micrographics. A type of artillery mission practiced by the United States Army since World War I, Harassment and <b>Interdiction</b> (H&I) <b>fire</b> proved controversial during the Vietnam War. Intentionally unobserved, H&I targeted suspected Viet Cong or North Vietnamese Army (NVA) routes and positions. These artillery missions engaged suspected targets with {{no more than a few}} rounds fired at random intervals throughout the night, and sometimes during the day, seeking to deny enemy freedom of movement and to destroy enemy morale. Unlike visually observed missions, or those acquired with sensors, H&I promised fewer benefits in a war without fronts and harbored a greater potential to harm Vietnamese civilians and their property. Nevertheless, the army leveraged its ability to project firepower and fired the majority of its missions and nearly half of its ammunition as H&I during 1966 and 1967. Beginning in October 1967, however, General William C. Westmoreland seriously questioned the effectiveness of H&I fire. As the Commander of the United States Military Assistance Command, Vietnam (MACV), he prompted a series of reforms that gradually, but significantly, reduced H&I before his June 1968 departure from Vietnam. His successor, General Creighton W. Abrams, implemented further significant cuts within three months of assuming command, but maintained H&I at nearly 10 percent of artillery ammunition expended until early 1970 when he nearly eliminated the practice. Although both Westmoreland and Abrams emphasized that poorly applied firepower could cause collateral damage, neither leader viewed H&I as inherently counterproductive to their pacification efforts. Indeed, both leaders responded to budgetary pressure, rather than concern over civilian casualties, when reducing H&I fire. Regarding the narrow issue of H&I reform, both commanders resembled one another more than they differed. Neither Westmoreland nor Abrams reduced H&I fire as part of a radical shift in strategy...|$|R
