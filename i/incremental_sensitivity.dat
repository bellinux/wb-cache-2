40|$|Abstract Background Tuberculosis {{control program}} of Rwanda is {{currently}} phasing in light emitting diode-fluorescent microscopy (LED-FM) {{as an alternative}} to Ziehl-Neelsen (ZN) smear microscopy. This, alongside the newly introduced Xpert (Cepheid, Sunnyvale, CA, USA) is expected to improve diagnosis of tuberculosis and detection of rifampicin resistance in patients at health facilities. We assessed the accuracy of smear microscopy and the <b>incremental</b> <b>sensitivity</b> of Xpert at tuberculosis laboratories in Rwanda. Methods This was a cross-sectional study involving four laboratories performing ZN and four laboratories performing LED-FM microscopy. The laboratories include four intermediate (ILs) and four peripheral (PLs) laboratories. After smear microscopy, the left-over of samples, of a single early-morning sputum from 648 participants, were tested using Xpert and mycobacterial culture as a reference standard. Sensitivity of each test was compared and the <b>incremental</b> <b>sensitivity</b> of Xpert after a negative smear was assessed. Results A total of 96 presumptive pulmonary tuberculosis participants were culture positive for M. tuberculosis. The overall sensitivity in PL of ZN was 55. 1  % (40. 2 – 69. 3  %), LED-FM was 37  % (19. 4 – 57. 6  %) and Xpert was 77. 6  % (66. 6 – 86. 4  %) whereas in ILs the same value for ZN was 58. 3  % (27. 7 – 84. 8  %), LED-FM was 62. 5  % (24. 5 – 91. 5  %) and Xpert was 90 (68. 3 – 98. 8  %). The sensitivity for all tests was significantly higher among HIV-negative individuals (all test p < 0. 05). The overall <b>incremental</b> <b>sensitivity</b> of Xpert over smear microscopy was 32. 3  %; p[*]<[*] 0. 0001. The <b>incremental</b> <b>sensitivity</b> of Xpert was statistically significant for both smear methods at PL (32. 9  %; p[*]=[*] 0. 001) but not at the ILs (30  %; p[*]=[*] 0. 125) for both smear methods. Conclusions Our study findings of the early implementation of the LED-FM did not reveal significant increment in sensitivity compared to the method being phased out (ZN). This study showed a significant <b>incremental</b> <b>sensitivity</b> for Xpert from both smear methods at peripheral centers where majority of TB patients are diagnosed. Overall our findings support the recommendation for Xpert as an initial diagnostic test in adults and children presumed to have TB...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT The small- and large-field (cone) {{horizontal}} cells produce similar dynamic {{responses to}} a stimulus whose mean luminance is modulated by a white-noise signal. Nonlinear components increase {{with an increase in}} the mean luminance and may produce a mean square error (MSE) of up to 15 %. Increases in the mean luminance of the field stimulus bring about three major changes: (a) the <b>incremental</b> <b>sensitivity</b> defined by the amplitude of the kernels decreases in a Weber-Fechner fashion; (b) the waveforms of the kernels are transformed from monophasic (integrating) to biphasic (differentiating); (c) the peak response time of the kernels becomes shorter and the cells respond to much higherfrequency inputs. The dynamics of the horizontal cell response also depend on the area of the retina stimulated. Smaller spots of light produce monophasic kernels of a longer peak response time. The presence of a steady background produces three major changes in the spot kernels: (a) the kernel's amplitude becomes larger (<b>incremental</b> <b>sensitivity</b> increases); (b) the peak response times become shorter; (c) the waveform of the kernels changes in a fashion similar to that observed with an increase in the mean luminance of the field stimulus. A similar enhancement in the <b>incremental</b> <b>sensitivity</b> by a steady background has also been observed in catfish, which shows that this phenomenon is a common feature of the horizontal cells in the lower vertebrate retina...|$|E

40|$|The retina's {{photoreceptor}} cells {{adjust their}} sensitivity to allow photons to be transduced {{over a wide}} range of light intensities. One mechanism thought to participate in sensitivity adjustments is Ca 2 + regulation of guanylate cyclase (GC) by guanylate cyclase-activating proteins (GCAPs). We evaluated the contribution of GCAPs to sensitivity regulation in rods by disrupting their expression in transgenic mice. The GC activity from GCAPs−/− retinas showed no Ca 2 + dependence, indicating that Ca 2 + regulation of GCs had indeed been abolished. Flash responses from dark-adapted GCAPs−/− rods were larger and slower than responses from wild-type rods. In addition, the <b>incremental</b> flash <b>sensitivity</b> of GCAPs−/− rods failed to be maintained at wild-type levels in bright steady light. GCAP 2 expressed in GCAPs−/− rods restored maximal light-induced GC activity but did not restore normal flash response kinetics. We conclude that GCAPs strongly regulate GC activity in mouse rods, decreasing the flash sensitivity in darkness and increasing the <b>incremental</b> flash <b>sensitivity</b> in bright steady light, thereby extending the rod's operating range...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} two low-power voltage-mode multifunction biquadratic filters using differential difference current conveyors. Each proposed circuit employs three differential difference current conveyors, two grounded capacitors and two grounded resistors. The low-voltage ultra-low-power differential difference current conveyor is used {{to provide}} low-power consumption of the proposed filters. By appropriately connecting the input and output terminals, the proposed filters can provide low-pass, band-pass, high-pass, band-stop and all-pass voltage responses at high-input terminals, which is a desirable feature for voltage-mode operations. The natural frequency and the quality factor can be orthogonally set by adjusting the circuit components. For realizing all the filter responses, no inverting-type input signal requirements as well as no component-matching conditional requirements are imposed. The <b>incremental</b> parameter <b>sensitivities</b> are also low. The characteristics of the proposed circuits are simulated by using PSPICE simulators to confirm the presented theory...|$|R
30|$|The {{importance}} of maintaining {{higher levels of}} AsA over DHA {{has been reported in}} previous studies. In transgenic tobacco plants overexpressing cucumber ascorbate oxidase, decreased AsA/DHA ratio increased ozone sensitivity (Sanmartin et al., 2003), whereas a higher AsA/DHA brought about by overexpression of DHAR and MDAR in cytosol resulted in enhanced tolerance to salt stress (Eltayeb et al., 2006). Higher AsA/DHA ratio, higher photosynthetic activity and lower H 2 O 2 contents were reported in transgenic tobacco plants expressing ascorbate oxidase gene (Yamamoto et al., 2005). According to this, we measured the AsA and DHA contents in leaves. Consistently with previous study (Chen et al., 2003), the osmdhar 4 mutant showed lower AsA contents and AsA/DHA ratio than the WT before or after heat treatment,and the OsMDHAR 4 -OE- 1 plants showed higher AsA contents and AsA/DHA ratio than the WT before or after treatment (Additional file  5 : Figure S 5). However, the changes of ascorbate redox state were not be able to explain the increased heat tolerance in the osmdhar 4 mutant and <b>incremental</b> heat <b>sensitivity</b> in OsMDHAR 4 overexpression lines.|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT The {{incremental}} {{responses from}} the second-order neurons of the ocellus of the cockroach, Periplaneta americana, have been measured. The stimulus was a white-noise-modulated light with various mean illuminances. The kernels, obtained by cross-correlating the white-noise input against the resulting response, provided a measure of <b>incremental</b> <b>sensitivity</b> {{as well as of}} response dynamics. We found that (a) the <b>incremental</b> <b>sensitivity</b> of the second-order neurons was an exact Weber-Fechner function; (b) white-noise-evoked responses from second-order neurons were linear; (c) the dynamics of second-order neurons remain unchanged over a mean illuminance rangeof 4 log units; (d) the small nonlinearity in the response of the second-order neuron was a simple amplitude compression; and (e) the correlation between the white-noise input and spike discharges of the second-order neurons produced a first-order kernel {{similar to that of the}} cell's slow potential. We conclude that signal processing in the cockroach ocellus is simple but different from that in other visual systems, including vertebrate retinas and insect compound eyes, in which the system's dynamics depend on the mean illuminance...|$|E

40|$|Distinct neural populations carry {{signals from}} short-wave (S) cones. We used {{individual}} differences {{to test whether}} two types of pathways, those that receive excitatory input (S+) and those that receive inhibitory input (S-), contribute independently to psychophysical performance. We also conducted a genome-wide association study (GWAS) to look for genetic correlates of the individual differences. Our psychophysical test {{was based on the}} Cambridge Color Test, but detection thresholds were measured separately for S-cone spatial increments and decrements. Our participants were 1060 healthy adults aged 16 - 40. Test-retest reliabilities for thresholds were good (ρ= 0. 64 for S-cone increments, 0. 67 for decrements and 0. 73 for the average of the two). "Regression scores," isolating variability unique to <b>incremental</b> or decremental <b>sensitivity,</b> were also reliable (ρ= 0. 53 for increments and ρ= 0. 51 for decrements). The correlation between incremental and decremental thresholds was ρ= 0. 65. No genetic markers reached genome-wide significance (p< 5 × 10 (- 7)). We identified 18 "suggestive" loci (p< 10 (- 5)). The significant test-retest reliabilities show stable individual differences in S-cone sensitivity in a normal adult population. Though a portion of the variance in sensitivity is shared between <b>incremental</b> and decremental <b>sensitivity,</b> over 26 % of the variance is stable across individuals, but unique to increments or decrements, suggesting distinct neural substrates. Some of the variability in sensitivity is likely to be genetic.

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} quality of {{financial}} reporting in Government Linked Companies (GLCs) {{and the effect of}} GLC’s transformation programme on the timeliness of accounting earnings in the Malaysian Market. This paper also compares the timeliness of earnings between the GLCs and Non-GLCs. This paper follows the model of Ball (2003) and estimates a linear pooled regression of accounting income on change in market value of equity during the period of 2004 to 2009. The method facilitates the determination of the timeliness of the accounting record to reflect economic gains or losses. The analysis shows that {{the quality of}} income in GLCs is higher than Non-GLCs. The results reveal that <b>incremental</b> economic losses <b>sensitivity</b> is more before the transformation programme compared to periods after the transformation programme and that economic gains recognition improves post year 2006 in GLCs. While there is an overall decline in the timeliness of losses recognition (in both GLC and Non-GLC groups), there is some improvement in the recognition of economic gains post year 2006. The results presented may be attributed to some transformation programmes implemented in GLCs and Non-GLCs. It is also acknowledged that the results could also be affected by the new IFRS implementation in year 2006. Yearly analysis reveals that there is no consistency in the effect of <b>incremental</b> economic losses <b>sensitivity,</b> which requires specific investigation into the incentives and specific forms of decisions in the future. While prior studies look at the timeliness of economic gains or losses recognition across countries, this paperattempts to investigate the issue of quality financial reporting in GLCs and how the implementation of the government transformation programme is able to {{have a significant impact on}} financial reporting in GLCs...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} worst-error {{analysis}} {{for dealing with}} problems of estimation of spacecraft trajectories in deep space missions. Navigation filters in use assume either constant or stochastic (Markov) models for their estimated parameters. When the actual behavior of these parameters does not follow {{the pattern of the}} assumed model, the filters sometimes result in very poor performance. To prepare for such pathological cases, the worst errors of both batch and sequential filters are investigated based on the <b>incremental</b> <b>sensitivity</b> studies of these filters. By finding critical switching instances of non-gravitational accelerations, intensive tracking can be carried out around those instances. Also the worst errors in the target plane provide a measure in assignment of the propellant budget for trajectory corrections. Thus the worst-error study presents useful information as well as practical criteria in establishing the maneuver and tracking strategy of spacecraft's missions...|$|E
40|$|Epileptogenic zones can be {{localized}} by F- 18 fluorodeoxyglucose positron {{emission tomography}} (FDG PET) and ictal single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT). In medial temporal lobe epilepsy, the diagnostic sensitivity of FDG PET or ictal SPECT is excellent, however, the sensitivity of MRI is so high that the <b>incremental</b> <b>sensitivity</b> by FDG PET or ictal SPECT {{has yet to be}} proven. When MRI findings are ambiguous or normal, or discordant with those of ictal EEG, FDG PET and ictal SPECT are helpful for localization without the need for invasive ictal EEG. In neocortical epilepsy, the sensitivities of FDG PET or ictal SPECT are fair. However, because almost a half of the patients are normal on MRI, FDG PET and ictal SPECT are helpful for localization or at least for lateralization in these non-lesional epilepsies in order to guide the subdural insertion of electrodes. Interpretation of FDG PET has been recently advanced by voxelbased analysis and automatic volume of interest analysis based on a population template. Both analytical methods confirmed the performance of previous visual interpretation results. Ictal SPECT was analyzed using subtraction methods (coregistered to MRI) and voxel-based analysis. Rapidity of injection of tracers, HMPAO versus ECD, and repeated ictal SPECT, which remain the technical issues of ictal SPECT, are detailed...|$|E
40|$|Soft {{errors in}} logic are {{emerging}} as a significant reliability problem for VLSI designs. This paper presents novel circuit optimization techniques to mitigate soft error rates (SER) of combinational logic circuits. First, we propose a gate sizing algorithm that trades off SER reduction and area overhead. This approach first computes bounds on the maximum achievable SER reduction by resizing a gate. This bound is then used to prune the circuit graph, arriving at a smaller set of candidate gates on which we perform <b>incremental</b> <b>sensitivity</b> computations to determine the gates that are the largest contributors to circuit SER. Second, we propose a flipflop selection method that uses slack information at each primary output node to determine the flipflop configuration that produces maximum SER savings. This approach uses an enhanced flipflop library that contains flipflops of varying temporal masking ability. Third, we propose a unified, cooptimization approach combining flipflop selection with the gate sizing algorithm. The joint optimization algorithm produces larger SER reductions while incurring smaller circuit overhead than either technique taken in isolation. Experimental results {{on a variety of}} benchmarks show SER reductions of 7. 9 X with gate sizing, 6. 6 X with flipflop assignment, and 28. 2 X for the combined optimization approach, with no delay penalties and area overheads within 5 - 6 %. The runtimes for the optimization algorithms are on the order of 1 - 3 minutes. ...|$|E

A comprehensive pediatric-specific instrument would be valuable in informing allocation decisions related to pediatric interventions and services. The goal {{of this study was to}} develop the Pediatric Quality Appraisal Questionnaire (PQAQ). MethodsA draft instrument was constructed from published checklists and questionnaires. New questions pertaining to the pediatric population were incorporated. An expert panel reviewed the draft instrument and the proposed scoring scheme for face and content validity. A revised version was pilot tested by three independent appraisers. After addressing discrepancies in scores, a final version was created and subjected to interrater and test–retest reliability assessment. ResultsThe 57 items in the final PQAQ were mapped onto 14 domains: economic evaluation, comparators, target population, time horizon, perspective, costs and resource use, outcomes, quality of life, analysis, discounting, <b>incremental</b> analysis, <b>sensitivity</b> analysis, conflict of interest, and conclusions. Among the 57 items, 46 have response options that are scored from 0 to 1. Interrater reliability was 0. 75 (95 % confidence interval [CI] 0. 66 – 0. 81) and test–retest reliability was 0. 92 (95 % CI 0. 71 – 0. 98).

40|$|Hyperspectral {{imaging and}} {{analysis}} approaches offer accurate detection and quantification of fluorescently-labeled proteins and cells in highly autofluorescent tissues. However, selecting optimum acquisition settings for hyperspectral imaging {{is often a}} daunting task. In this study, we compared two hyperspectral systems—a widefield system with acoustic optical tunable filter (AOTF) and charge coupled device (CCD) camera, and a confocal system with diffraction gratings and photomultiplier tube (PMT) array. We measured the effects of system parameters on hyperspectral image quality and linear unmixing results. Parameters that were assessed for the confocal system included pinhole diameter, laser power, PMT gain and for the widefield system included arc lamp intensity, and camera gain. The signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and the root-mean-square error (RMS error) were measured to assess system performance. Photobleaching dynamics were studied. Finally, theoretical sensitivity studies were performed to estimate the <b>incremental</b> response (<b>sensitivity)</b> and false-positive detection rates (specificity). Results indicate that hyperspectral imaging assays are highly dependent on system parameters and experimental conditions. For detection of green fluorescent protein (GFP) -expressing cells in fixed lung tissues, a confocal pinhole of five airy disk units, high excitation intensity and low detector gain were optimal. The theoretical sensitivity studies revealed that widefield hyperspectral microscopy was able to detect GFP with fewer false positive occurrences than confocal microscopy, even though confocal microscopy offered improved signal and noise characteristics.

40|$|ABSTRACT Control of {{contrast}} sensitivity was studied in {{two kinds of}} retina, that of the channel catfish {{and that of the}} kissing gourami. The former preparation is dominantly monochromatic and the latter is bichromatic. Various stimuli were used, namely a large field of light, a spot-annulus configuration and two overlapping stimuli of red and green. Recordings were made from horizontal, amacrine, and ganglion cells and the results were analyzed by means of Wiener's theory, in which the kernels are the contrast (<b>incremental)</b> <b>sensitivity.</b> Modulation responses from horizontal cells are linear, in that the waveform and amplitude of the first-order kernels are independent of the depth of modulation. In the N (sustained) amacrine and ganglion cells, contrast sensitivity was low for a large modulation input and was high for a small modulation input, providing an example {{of contrast}} gain control. In most of the cells, the contrast gain control did not affect the dynamics of the response because the waveform of the first-order kernels remained unchanged when the contrast sensitivity increased more than fivefold. The signature of the secondorder kernels also remained unchanged over a wide range of modulation. The increase in the contrast sensitivity for the second-order component, as defined by the amplitude of the kernels, was much larger than for the first-order component. This observation suggests that the contrast gain control proceeded the generation of the second-order nonlinearity. An analysis of a cascade of the Wiener type shows that the control of contrast sensitivity in the proximal retinal cells could be modeled by assuming the presence of a simple (static) saturation nonlinearity. Such a nonlinearity must exist somewhere between the horizontal cells and the amacrine cells. The functional implications of the contrast gain control are as follows: (a) neurons in the proximal retina exhibit greater sensitivity to input of lower contrast; (b) saturation of a neuronal response can be prevented because of the lower sensitivity for an input with large contrast, and (c) over a large range of modulation depths, the amplitude of the response remains approximately constant...|$|E

40|$|Background: Urine LAM {{testing has}} been {{approved}} by the WHO for use in hospitalised patients with advanced immunosuppression. However, sensitivity remains suboptimal. We therefore examined the <b>incremental</b> diagnostic <b>sensitivity</b> of early morning urine (EMU) versus random urine sampling using the Determine® lateral flow lipoarabinomannan assay (LF-LAM) in HIV-TB co-infected patients. Methods: Consenting HIV-infected inpatients, screened {{as part of a larger}} prospective randomized controlled trial, that were treated for TB, and could donate matched random and EMU samples were included. Thus paired sample were collected from the same patient, LF-LAM was graded using the pre-January 2014, with grade 1 and 2 manufacturer-designated cut-points (the latter designated grade 1 after January 2014). Single sputum Xpert-MTB/ RIF and/or TB culture positivity served as the reference standard (definite TB). Those treated for TB but not meeting this standard were designated probable TB. Results: 123 HIV-infected patients commenced anti-TB treatment and provided matched random and EMU samples. 33 % (41 / 123) and 67 % (82 / 123) had definite and probable TB, respectively. Amongst those with definite TB LF-LAM sensitivity (95 %CI), using the grade 2 cut-point, increased from 12 % (5 – 24; 5 / 43) to 39 % (26 – 54; 16 / 41) with random versus EMU, respectively (p = 0. 005). Similarly, amongst probable TB, LF-LAM sensitivity increased from 10 % (5 – 17; 8 / 83) to 24 % (16 – 34; 20 / 82) (p = 0. 001). LF-LAM specificity was not determined.

40|$|This work is {{directed}} toward optimizing concept designs of structures featuring inelastic material behaviours by using topology optimization. In the proposed framework, alternative structural designs are described {{with the aid of}} spatial distributions of volume fraction design variables throughout a prescribed design domain. Since two or more materials are permitted to simultaneously occupy local regions of the design domain, small-strain integration algorithms for general two-material mixtures of solids are developed for the Voigt (isostrain) and Reuss (isostress) assumptions, and hybrid combinations thereof. Structural topology optimization problems involving non-linear material behaviours are formulated and algorithms for <b>incremental</b> topology design <b>sensitivity</b> analysis (DSA) of energy type functionals are presented. The consistency between the structural topology design formulation and the developed sensitivity analysis algorithms is established on three small structural topology problems separately involving linear elastic materials, elastoplastic materials, and viscoelastic materials. The good performance of the proposed framework is demonstrated by solving two topology optimization problems to maximize the limit strength of elastoplastic structures. It is demonstrated through the second example that structures optimized for maximal strength can be significantly different than those optimized for minimal elastic compliance...|$|R
40|$|Precursors to 1 / 3 of {{colorectal}} cancer (CRC), serrated polyps have been under-detected by screening {{due to their}} inconspicuous, non-hemorrhagic, and proximal nature. A new multi-target stool DNA test (multi-target sDNA) shows high sensitivity for both CRC and advanced adenomas. Screen detection of serrated polyps by this approach requires further validation. We sought to assess and compare noninvasive detection of sessile serrated polyps (SSP) ≥ 1 cm by sDNA and an occult blood fecal immunochemical test (FIT). In a blinded prospective study, a single stool sample used for both tests was collected from 456 asymptomatic adults prior to screening or surveillance colonoscopy (criterion standard). All 29 patients with SSP ≥ 1 cm were included as cases and all 232 with no neoplastic findings as controls. Buffered stool samples were processed and frozen on receipt; Exact Sciences performed sDNA in batches using optimized analytical methods. The sDNA multi-marker panel targets methylated BMP 3 (mBMP 3) and NDRG 4, mutant KRAS, β-actin, and hemoglobin. FIT (Polymedco OC-FIT Check) was performed in separate lab ≤ 2 days post defecation and evaluated at cutoffs of 50 (FIT- 50) and 100 ng/ml (FIT- 100). MEDIAN AGES: cases 61 (range 57 - 77), controls 62 (52 - 70), p = NS. Women comprised 59 % and 51 %, p = NS, respectively. SSP median size was 1. 2 cm (1 - 3 cm), 93 % were proximal, and 64 % had synchronous diminutive polyps. Among multi-target sDNA markers, mBMP 3 proved highly discriminant for detection of SSP ≥ 1 cm (AUC = 0. 87, p< 0. 00001); other DNA markers provided no <b>incremental</b> <b>sensitivity.</b> Hemoglobin alone showed no discrimination (AUC = 0. 50, p = NS). At matched specificities, detection of SSP ≥ 1 cm by stool mBMP 3 was significantly greater than by FIT- 50 (66 % vs 10 %, p = 0. 0003) or FIT- 100 (63 % vs 0 %, p< 0. 0001). In a screening and surveillance setting, SSP ≥ 1 cm can be detected noninvasively by stool assay of exfoliated DNA markers, especially mBMP 3. FIT appears to have no value in SSP detection...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} of the research was to perform a comprehensive computational analysis {{of the effects of}} material and process modeling approaches on performance of Ultra Light Steel Auto Body (ULSAB) vehicle models. The research addressed numerous material related effects, impact conditions as well as analyzed the performance of the ULSAB vehicles in crashes against designs representing the current US vehicle fleet. Crash modeling simulations show a clear effect of strain-rate sensitivity on high strength steel (HSS) intensive vehicle. The influence of a strain-rate model can be an <b>incremental</b> <b>sensitivity</b> due to the increased flow stress when similar structure collapse modes are predicted. However, significant differences in crash energy management capacity can be predicted if the change in loading on members alters the predicted collapse mode of the structure. From the material substitution study it can be concluded that HSS material substitution cannot be performed {{on the basis of the}} material yield point only and that, especially for advanced HSS vehicle designs, the entire region of material plastic response has to be considered. However, the problem of modeling of the overall dynamic crush process still remains open and requires further experimental and theoretical investigation. Crash modeling simulations show a moderate effect of forming on overall crash performance. The design is the determining factor on the vehicle performance and, therefore, the results of this research cannot provide measures that can be used in a general case. However, it has been shown that for materials that have modest strain hardening, the forming effect is observable and that when more complex forming operations are used, especially in combination with rapid strain hardening materials, forming effects should be taken in the consideration in the computational crash models. crash compatibility study between ULSAB and cars of similar geometric characteristics have shown that the U LSAB design is compatible with the conventional designs of existing cars with similar inertia and geometric characteristics. The structural-performance characteristics of the vehicles involved in a car-to-car collision when one of the cars is the ULSAB are governed by the stiffness and geometry of the crush zone in the vehicles. The effects of mass could not be evaluated because of the similar mass of the vehicle models used in the analysis. Within the constraints of the current analysis it appears that, for the ULSAB, the effects of stiffness dominate the compatibility aspects for collisions with similar vehicles...|$|E
40|$|Abstract This thesis {{describes}} position-sensitive devices (PSDs) {{and optical}} sensor systems suitable for industrial tracking and displacement sensing applications. The main application {{areas of the}} proposed sensors include automatic pointing of a rangefinder beam and measuring the lateral displacement of an object. A conventional tracking sensor is composed of a laser illuminator, a misfocused quadrant detector (QD) receiver and a corner cube retroreflector (CCR) attached to the target. The angular displacement of a target from the receiver optical axis is detected by illuminating the target and determining {{the direction of the}} reflection using the QD receiver. The main contribution of the thesis is related to the modifications proposed for this conventional construction in order to make its performance sufficient for industrial applications that require a few millimetre to submillimetre accuracy. The work includes sensor optical construction modifications and the designing of new types of PSDs. The conventional QD-based sensor, although electrically very sensitive, is not considered optimal for industrial applications since its precision is severely hampered by atmospheric turbulence due to the misfocusing needed for its operation. Replacing the CCR with a sheet reflector is found to improve the precision of the conventional sensor construction in outdoor beam pointing applications, and is estimated to allow subcentimetre precision over distances of up to 100 m under most operating conditions. Submillimetre accuracy is achievable in close-range beam pointing applications using a small piece of sheet reflector, coaxial illumination and a focused QD receiver. Polarisation filtering is found to be effective in eliminating the main error contributor in close-range applications, which is low reflector background contrast, especially in cases when a sheet reflector has a specularly reflecting background. The tracking sensor construction is also proposed for measuring the aiming trajectory of a firearm in an outdoor environment. This time an order of magnitude improvement in precision is achieved by replacing the QD with a focused lateral effect photodiode (LEP). Use of this construction in cases of intermediate atmospheric turbulence allows a precision better than 1 cm to be achieved up to a distance of 300 m. A method based on averaging the positions of multiple reflectors is also proposed in order to improve the precision in turbulence-limited cases. Finally, various types of custom-designed PSDs utilising a photodetector array structure are presented for long-range displacement sensing applications. The goal was to be able to replace the noisy LEP with a low-noise PSD without compromising the low turbulence sensitivity achievable with the LEP. An order of magnitude improvement in <b>incremental</b> <b>sensitivity</b> is achievable with the proposed array PSDs...|$|E
40|$|Choices {{not only}} make life interesting; {{they also make}} it difficult. When I began my career as a cytopathologist, some 30 years ago, the most {{challenging}} decision was whether to use Harris' or Meyer's hematoxylin. The current daunting decisions facing our profession demand careful consideration to choose the most appropriate technology for the task at hand. Despite FDA approval and the studies published or supported by the manufacturers, a new device or method must be validated in each laboratory, {{the same way that}} our clinical laboratories introduce new tests on their menus. Pressure from manufacturers, clinicians and patients cannot substitute for trial and error in our own environments, allowing our personnel to become accustomed to the idiosyncrasies of the device and interpretation of the processed sample. The threat of litigation is not sufficient reason to introduce an automated device or new technology. Most cost more and currently have shown very small, <b>incremental</b> improvements in <b>sensitivity.</b> Moreover, some may actually decrease specificity, raising the costs of the patient management. We should make decisions on our terms as laboratory supervisors and directors.

40|$|AbstractAimsCompare {{metabolic}} responses after mixed versus liquid meals {{of similar}} caloric/nutritional content in healthy and {{type 2 diabetes}} (T 2 D) subjects. MethodsTen healthy men and 10 men with T 2 D received mixed and liquid meals after an overnight fast. Classical (insulinogenic index; insulin/glucose areas under curves, AUCinsulin/AUCglucose) and model-based (beta-cell glucose sensitivity; rate sensitivity; potentiation factor ratio, PFR) beta-cell function estimates were calculated. Between-meal differences in glucose, insulin, C-peptide, triglyceride (TG), beta-cell function and oral glucose insulin sensitivity (OGIS) and between-meal correlations for beta-cell function and OGIS were evaluated. ResultsAmong healthy subjects, beta-cell function and OGIS were similar between meals. C-peptide (p= 0. 03), insulin (p= 0. 002), AUCinsulin/AUCglucose (p= 0. 004) and insulin secretion (p= 0. 04) were higher after the liquid meal. Among T 2 D subjects, glucose, insulin, C-peptide, beta-cell function, and OGIS were similar. PFR was higher (p= 0. 004) and TG increased more slowly (p= 0. 002) after the liquid meal. OGIS and beta-cell function were correlated during both meals in both groups (r= 0. 66 – 0. 98), except <b>incremental</b> AUCinsulin/AUCglucose, rate <b>sensitivity,</b> and, in healthy subjects, PFR. ConclusionsMetabolic responses after mixed or liquid meals of similar content were highly correlated in T 2 D and healthy subjects.

40|$|Adaptation by weak {{backgrounds}} and the spatial spread of desensitization between rods was {{studied in the}} snapping turtle retina, Chelydra serpentina. Intracellular membrane potentials were recorded from these photoreceptors in an eyecup preparation. The kinetics and sensitivity of rod responses were changed significantly by large, very dim backgrounds. For the twenty-five most sensitive rods where the dark-adapted flash sensitivity, SDF, was greater than 1. 0 mV/Rh*, Rh* being the number of effective photo-isomerizations per rod, the background intensity required to halve the amplitude of the linear range response averaged 0. 21 Rh* s- 1. The time-to-peak of the test responses was reduced up to 50 % by these dim backgrounds. The desensitizing effects of full field backgrounds of various intensities on the responses to large test spots were measured. The dependence of <b>incremental</b> flash <b>sensitivity,</b> SF, on background intensity, IB, followed the form (FORMULA: SEE TEXT) where I 0 is the background intensity which halved SDF. The same intensity dependence held for slit-shaped background fields that desensitized responses to small test spots. The desensitizing effects of large, very dim flashed and continuous backgrounds took several seconds to appear and decay to dark levels. This {{in conjunction with the}} sparsity of photons suggests, that the desensitization from a single photoisomerization can persist for several seconds. A comparison of the desensitizing effects of spot and annular backgrounds revealed that small spot backgrounds superimposed on the centered test spots desensitized rods more effectively than annular fields. This finding held true even when annular patterns produced a greater maintained hyperpolarization in the rods. Thus, there was no unique relationship between desensitization and the steady maintained hyperpolarization evoked by a background field. The dependence of adaptation on distance from the impaled rod was determined with slit-shaped background fields placed at different positions across the rod's receptive field. The desensitizing effect of displaced slit stimuli was found to decline much more rapidly with distance than excitation. Displacing the slit by 20 micron from the centre reduced its desensitizing effect by more than 1 log unit. In contrast, excitation fell to about 80 % at the same distance (lambda ranging from 50 to 70 micron). The fall off of desensitization with distance matched the calculated fall off with distance of light scatter from a slit. No difference was noted in the kinetics of test responses in the presence of equally desensitizing, superimposed and displaced slits. (ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS...|$|R
40|$|AIM: To {{assess the}} {{economics}} of various chemotherapeutic regimens for advanced gastric cancer (AGC), and to select the best cost-effective regimen for the common Chinese patients. METHODS: Data source {{used in this study}} was the Chinese Biomedical Disk Database. Patients were diagnosed as AGC and any regimen was eligible. Outcome measures included median survival time (MST) and percentage of complete and partial response (CR+PR). Economic statistics was per capita direct medical cost (DMC) of a single cycle. TreeAge Pro Healthcare 2007 software was used to carry out cost-effectiveness and <b>incremental</b> cost-effectiveness analysis. <b>Sensitivity</b> analyses were applied by altering willingness-to-pay and annual discount rate, and also re-analyzed by excluding the studies with apparent heterogeneity. RESULTS: Seven retrospective economics studies on 760 patients were included. 5 -fluorouracil-based regimens were universal, and also some new agents were involved, such as docetaxel, paclitaxel, and oxaliplatin. By processing analysis, we could recommend etoposide, leucovorin and 5 -fluorouracil (ELF) regimen as preference, with a DMC/MST ratio of 2543 RBM/ 11. 7 mo and a DMC/CR+PR ratio of 2543 RMB/ 53. 3 %. Uracil-tegafur, etoposide and cisplatin (FEP) or 5 -fluorouracil, adrimycin/epirubin and mitomycin (FAM) regimens could be regarded as optional first-line chemotherapy for AGC in common Chinese patients. With no regard for willingness-to-pay, the docetaxel, cisplatin and 5 -fluorouracil (DCF) regimen could be chosen as either a first- or a second-line chemotherapy, with a DMC/CR+PR ratio of 9979 RMB/ 56. 3 %. CONCLUSION: 5 -fluorouracil regimens are still considered the mainstream for AGC, while new agents such as taxanes are optional. More randomized clinical trials are required before any mandatory recommendation of certain regimens for patients with AGC in China is made...|$|R
40|$|Background: Poor {{adherence}} to medical treatment {{is one of}} the main reasons why patients do not achieve the full benefits of their therapy. It also has a substantial financial weight in terms of money wasted for unused medication and increased healthcare costs including hospitalization due to clinical complications. Objective: To provide an overview and examples of the financial and economic consequences of poor {{adherence to}} treatment, techniques and devices for monitoring adherence and interventions for improvement of treatment adherence. Results: New electronic devices with monitoring features may help to objectively monitor patients' adherence to a treatment regimen that can help a healthcare professional determine how to intervene to improve adherence and subsequent clinical outcome. Interventions that aim to enhance adherence may confer costeffectiveness benefits in some indications and settings. The nature of the intervention(s) used depends on a range of factors, including patient preference, therapy area and cost of the intervention. However, there is a pressing need for rigorous trials, as current studies often have major flaws in the economic methodology, especially in terms of <b>incremental</b> analysis and <b>sensitivity</b> analysis. Limitations: This review has focused on a limited number of therapeutic areas as coverage of a more extensive range of diseases may be beyond the scope of such a summary. Nevertheless, the examples are representative of the challenges encountered in many other diseases. Conclusions: The clinical and economic consequences of non-adherence and interventions to improve compliance reflect the nature and severity of non-adherence, as well as the pathophysiology and severity of the disease. Interventions that aim to enhance adherence may confer cost-effectiveness benefits in some indications and settings, and good adherence can help payers and providers contain costs by extracting maximum value from their investment in therapies...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: As {{the health}} care economic-evaluation {{literature}} continues to grow, a need for sound methods to conduct systematic reviews of the existing evidence is emerging. So far, reviews of economic evaluations have relied upon noncomprehensive sources and have adopted simplistic search methods, both {{likely to lead to}} biased results. OBJECTIVE: To provide evidence of the performance of alternative approaches for identifying published health care economic evaluations and to illustrate what forms of bias may affect systematic reviews of such studies. METHODS: The sensitivity and specificity of alternative search strategies were tested for the period January to March 1997, using seven major medical and social science literature databases, one economic evaluation database and a published bibliography. Studies were selected blindly by pairs of reviewers (agreement 94. 1 %- 96. 5 %), using a two-stage procedure. RESULTS: By limiting the scope of a review to Medline and by using appropriate search strategies, researchers may significantly reduce the number of nonrelevant references retrieved by their electronic searches (sensitivity 72 %, specificity 75 %, compared with more extensive strategies), which require exclusion by manual screening. The yield of searches based on specialized bibliographies and databases may be different because of variations in selection criteria, coverage and time lag for inclusion of references. CONCLUSIONS: Medline is the key source for reviews of economic evaluations. Researchers may select from the search strategies proposed in this paper the one that offers an optimal balance between sensitivity and specificity in relation to the aims of their review. Manual searches and searches of databases other than Medline have a limited <b>incremental</b> yield. The <b>sensitivity</b> of all search strategies increases when tighter methodological standards are set, but more research is needed on methods for identifying methodologically sound studies...|$|R
40|$|Abstract and presentationBackground: Many Asian countries, {{including}} Hong Kong, {{have experienced}} {{an increase of}} two to four times in colorectal cancer (CRC) incidence {{during the past few}} decades. CRC has recently become the second leading cause of cancer-related mortality in Hong Kong after lung cancer. There has not been a systematic assessment of the cost-effectiveness of CRC screening in Asia. Objective: To assess the cost-effectiveness of alternative CRC screening strategies (i. e. FOBT, sigmoidoscopy, colonoscopy or combinations thereof at different intervals) in average-risk Hong Kong Chinese. Methods: We specify a state-transition Markov model which is modified from a previous US model that simulates the natural history of the adenoma-carcinoma sequence as a function of age, sex and other risk factors. The model also contains a screening component that allows for the detection and removal of adenomas and possibly an early diagnosis of CRC; and a treatment component for all persons diagnosed with CRC. This modified model reflects the clinical practice in Hong Kong. Data are from local hospitals and laboratories, clinical trials, prospective studies and other published literature. The stopping age (69 vs. 79 years) for the different CRC screening strategies are also explored. Main outcome measures are cancer incidence reduction, years of life saved (YLS), lifetime costs, and <b>incremental</b> cost-effectiveness ratios. <b>Sensitivity</b> analyses are performed to assess the stability of the results within the plausible ranges of uncertain parameters and to establish a set of epidemiologic threshold parameters for which the different types of CRC screening should be considered. Anticipated significance of findings: Results from the mathematical model which simulates clinical practice can use to inform clinical guidelines in Hong Kong. A set of epidemiologic threshold parameters for which the different types of CRC screening should be considered is also useful especially given the continuing upward trend of CRC incidence among many Asian countries...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Colorectal cancer (CRC) {{fulfills}} the World Health Organization {{criteria for}} mass screening, but screening uptake {{is low in}} most countries. CRC screening is resource intensive, and it is unclear if an optimal strategy exists. The objective {{of this study was}} to perform an economic evaluation of CRC screening in average risk North American individuals considering all relevant screening modalities and current CRC treatment costs. METHODS AND FINDINGS: An incremental cost-utility analysis using a Markov model was performed comparing guaiac-based fecal occult blood test (FOBT) or fecal immunochemical test (FIT) annually, fecal DNA every 3 years, flexible sigmoidoscopy or computed tomographic colonography every 5 years, and colonoscopy every 10 years. All strategies were also compared to a no screening natural history arm. Given that different FIT assays and collection methods have been previously tested, three distinct FIT testing strategies were considered, on the basis of studies that have reported "low," "mid," and "high" test performance characteristics for detecting adenomas and CRC. Adenoma and CRC prevalence rates were based on a recent systematic review whereas screening adherence, test performance, and CRC treatment costs were based on publicly available data. The outcome measures included lifetime costs, number of cancers, cancer-related deaths, quality-adjusted life-years gained, and <b>incremental</b> cost-utility ratios. <b>Sensitivity</b> and scenario analyses were performed. Annual FIT, assuming mid-range testing characteristics, was more effective and less costly compared to all strategies (including no screening) except FIT-high. Among the lifetimes of 100, 000 average-risk patients, the number of cancers could be reduced from 4, 857 to 1, 393 [corrected] and the number of CRC deaths from 1, 782 [corrected] to 457, while saving CAN$ 68 per person. Although screening patients with FIT became more expensive than a strategy of no screening when the test performance of FIT was reduced, or the cost of managing CRC was lowered (e. g., for jurisdictions that do not fund expensive biologic chemotherapeutic regimens), CRC screening with FIT remained economically attractive. CONCLUSIONS: CRC screening with FIT reduces the risk of CRC and CRC-related deaths, and lowers health care costs in comparison to no screening and to other existing screening strategies. Health policy decision makers should consider prioritizing funding for CRC screening using FIT...|$|R
40|$|SummaryBackgroundWHO {{recommends}} that Xpert MTB/RIF replaces smear microscopy for initial diagnosis of suspected HIV-associated tuberculosis or multidrug-resistant pulmonary tuberculosis, but no data exist {{for its use}} in children. We aimed to assess {{the accuracy of the}} test for the diagnosis of pulmonary tuberculosis in children in an area with high tuberculosis and HIV prevalences. MethodsIn this prospective, descriptive study, we enrolled children aged 15 years or younger who had been admitted to one of two hospitals in Cape Town, South Africa, with suspected pulmonary tuberculosis between Feb 19, 2009, and Nov 30, 2010. We compared the diagnostic accuracy of MTB/RIF and concentrated, fluorescent acid-fast smear with a reference standard of liquid culture from two sequential induced sputum specimens (primary analysis). Results 452 children (median age 19 · 4 months, IQR 11 · 1 – 46 · 2) had at least one induced sputum specimen; 108 children (24 %) had HIV infection. 27 children (6 %) had a positive smear result, 70 (16 %) had a positive culture result, and 58 (13 %) had a positive MTB/RIF test result. With mycobacterial culture as the reference standard, MTB/RIF tests when done on two induced sputum samples detected twice as many cases (75 · 9 %, 95 % CI 64 · 5 – 87 · 2) as did smear microscopy (37 · 9 %, 25 · 1 – 50 · 8), detecting all of 22 smear-positive cases and 22 of 36 (61 · 1 %, 44 · 4 – 77 · 8) smear-negative cases. For smear-negative cases, the <b>incremental</b> increase in <b>sensitivity</b> from testing a second specimen was 27 · 8 % for MTB/RIF, compared with 13 · 8 % for culture. The specificity of MTB/RIF was 98 · 8 % (97 · 6 – 99 · 9). MTB/RIF results were available in median 1 day (IQR 0 – 4) compared with median 12 days (9 – 17) for culture (p< 0 · 0001). InterpretationMTB/RIF testing of two induced sputum specimens is warranted as the first-line diagnostic test for children with suspected pulmonary tuberculosis.
