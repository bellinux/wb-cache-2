40|$|Abstract. Traditional {{contacting}} measure method {{can easily}} cause cigarette <b>filter</b> <b>rod</b> distortion and needs long measure time. Its measure precision {{is difficult to}} satisfy practice demand and it cannot implement online measure. In order to overcome these shortages, imaging measure technology is used to measure cigarette <b>filter</b> <b>rod</b> parameters. Firstly, preprocessing filtering is operated on the image acquired from imaging measure system. Then binary cigarette <b>filter</b> <b>rod</b> target image is obtained through Otsu segmentation method. After that target feature extraction is processed and correlative parameters of cigarette <b>filter</b> <b>rod</b> are gained. Parameters measuring absolute error for two images which are acquired from the same cigarette <b>filter</b> <b>rod</b> under different illumination is 0. 683 %. Experiment proves that the proposed method can rapidly and correctly measure cigarette <b>filter</b> <b>rod</b> and has good robust and adaptability. It can effectively measure cigarette <b>filter</b> <b>rod</b> in practice...|$|E

40|$|Triethyl citrate (TEC) {{was applied}} in the {{preparation}} of cigarette <b>filter</b> <b>rods</b> by two approaches. One was to utilize TEC as a plasticizer sprayed onto the surface of cellulose acetate (CA) fibers. The other was to apply TEC as an additive coated onto the cellulosic paper of acetate-paper dual filters. Three types of cigarette <b>filter</b> <b>rods,</b> namely, triethyl citrate-cellulose acetate (TEC-CA) <b>filter</b> <b>rods,</b> triethyl citrate-cellulose acetate-paper (TEC-CA-paper) dual <b>filter</b> <b>rods</b> and cellulose acetate-paper-triethyl citrate (CA-paper-TEC) dual <b>filter</b> <b>rods,</b> were manufactured. In order to promote the curing of CA rods, high-frequency radiation was introduced into the procedure of filter manufacture. Then Virginia type cigarettes, combined with the three kinds of prepared <b>filter</b> <b>rods</b> were manufactured and the removal efficiency of phenols from the cigarette mainstream smoke was investigated. The results revealed that no matter where the triethyl citrate was applied as plasticizer or coating additive, the content of phenol, o-, m-and p-cresol in cigarette mainstream smoke could be greatly reduced.

40|$|Abstract—The {{purpose of}} the {{experiments}} {{described in this article}} was the comparison of integrated fixed film activated sludge (IFAS) and activated sludge (AS) system. The IFAS applied system consists of the cigarette <b>filter</b> <b>rods</b> (wasted <b>filter</b> in tobacco factories) as a biofilm carrier. The comparison with activated sludge was performed by two parallel treatment lines. Organic substance, ammonia and TP removal was investigated over four month period. Synthetic wastewater was prepared with ordinary tap water and glucose as the main sources of carbon and energy, plus balanced macro and micro nutrients. COD removal percentages of 94. 55 %, and 81. 62 % were achieved for IFAS and activated sludge system, respectively. Also, ammonia concentration significantly decreased by increasing the HRT in both systems. The average ammonia removal of 97. 40 % and 96. 34 % were achieved for IFAS and activated sludge system, respectively. The removal efficiency of total phosphorus (TP-P) was 60. 64 %, higher than AS process by 56. 63 % respectively. Keywords—Wastewater; biofilm carrier; cigarette <b>filters</b> <b>rods...</b>|$|R

40|$|Background: More than 90 % of the {{cigarettes}} sold worldwide have a filter. Nearly all filters {{consist of a}} rod of numerous (> 12 000) plastic-like cellulose acetate fibres. During high speed cigarette manu-facturing procedures, fragments of cellulose acetate that form the mouthpiece of a <b>filter</b> <b>rod</b> become separated from the filter at the end face. The cut surface of the filter of nearly all cigarettes has these fragments. In smoking a cigarette in the usual manner, some of these fragments are released during puffing. In addition to the cellulose acetate fragments, carbon particles are released also from some cigarette brands that have a charcoal filter. Cigarettes with filters that release cellulose acetate or car-bon particles during normal smoking conditions are defective. Objective: Specific goals were to review systematically the writings of tobacco companies to: (a) iden-tify papers that would document the existence of defective filters; (b) characterise {{the extent of the}} defect; (c) establish when the defect became known; (d) determine whether the defect exists on ciga-rettes marketed currently; (e) assess the prevalence of the defect on cigarettes manufactured by differ-ent companies; (f) define whether the knowledge of the defect had been withheld by the tobacco company as confidential and not disclosed publicly; and (g) ascertain the feasibility of correcting or preventing the defect...|$|E

40|$|PURPOSE: To {{assess the}} use of {{cellulose}} acetate <b>filter</b> <b>rods</b> as a technique for tear collection. METHOD: The cellulose acetate rod (CR) was compared with the 'standard' glass capillary tube (CT), {{in a series of}} experiments, to assess: sample collection by collected volume size; the effect of tear stimulation on total tear protein concentration and major tear protein concentrations; and technique invasiveness. RESULTS: No difference was found in concentrations for total protein, IgA (secretory immunoglobulin A), lactoferrin and lysozyme (p > 0. 05) with no clinically significant increase in serum albumin to show serum leakage. Sample volume was higher for CR (p < 0. 005) and sample volume increased for stimulated collection with CR (p = 0. 001). Dilution effect of a stimulated sample size was reliably shown only with CR (r = - 0. 66, p = 0. 011). Using bovine albumin standard with CR and CT, a smaller sample volume (p < 0. 001) and a higher protein concentration (p < 0. 001) were extracted with CR. CONCLUSION: The cellulose rod offers a suitable alternative to the glass CT. It is able to quickly absorb a sample, allowing use {{for a wide range of}} sample sizes, while being minimally invasive...|$|R

First, our early work on making <b>filters</b> from <b>rods</b> of gold-coated SU 8 is described. Pass (up to 97 %) and stop bands can be observed which are theoretically underpinned by both FDTD and complex band structure simulations. Second, there is a discussion of how THz radiation passes through two-dimensional periodic arrays of subwavelength apertures. In particular, the geometry of the arrays has been studied with time-domain spectroscopy.

40|$|The {{following}} report {{presents an}} assessment of existing capabilities in Sierra/Fuego applied to modeling several aspects of grid-to-rod-fretting (GTRF) including: fluid dynamics, heat transfer, and fluid-structure interaction. We compare {{the results of a}} number of Fuego simulations with relevant sources in the literature to evaluate the accuracy, efficiency, and robustness of using Fuego to model the aforementioned aspects. Comparisons between flow domains that include the full fuel rod length vs. a subsection of the domain near the spacer show that tremendous efficiency gains can be obtained by truncating the domain without loss of accuracy. Thermal analysis reveals the extent to which heat transfer from the fuel rods to the coolant is improved by the swirling flow created by the mixing vanes. Lastly, coupled fluid-structure interaction analysis shows that the vibrational modes of the fuel <b>rods</b> <b>filter</b> out high frequency turbulent pressure fluctuations.

40|$|The {{spatial and}} {{temporal}} properties of rod vision were measured for stimuli at and above the detection threshold in an achromat whose spectral sensitivity, dark adaptation, {{spatial and temporal}} thresholds and Stiles-Crawford effect suggest the presence of only a normally functioning rod system. The properties of rod and cone vision were compared at illuminances where their respective sensitivities were optimum. The threshold spatial sensitivity of the rod mechanism under optimum illumination (180 scotopic trolands) exhibits bandpass properties with a peak sensitivity of around 80 at 0. 5 cycles/deg and a spatial acuity of 6 - 7 cycles/deg. The threshold temporal sensitivity also exhibits bandpass properties under these conditions with a peak sensitivity of around 80 at 5 Hz and a temporal acuity of 30 Hz. For stimuli of low spatial frequency (less than 0. 3 cycles/deg) and low temporal frequency, the threshold sensitivities of rod- and cone-mediated vision are identical. Rod- and cone-mediated vision display comparable spatial and temporal discrimination for targets of equal suprathreshold contrast over the low to mid spatial and temporal range that they share. Rod-mediated discriminations fall below those of cone vision above 1 cycle/deg for spatial judgements and above 15 Hz for temporal judgements. The number of discriminable steps in spatial frequency and temporal frequency at threshold is similar for rod and cone vision over the spatio-temporal frequency range that they share. Over this range rod- and cone-mediated vision can discriminate four steps in spatial frequency and one step in temporal frequency. These results suggest that rod vision shows comparable spatio-temporal discrimination performance to cone vision {{and that it is}} subserved by at least five spatial and two temporal labelled detectors. The response of the highest spatial frequency <b>filter</b> subserving <b>rod</b> vision extends from 0. 5 to 6 cycles/deg...|$|R
40|$|Flashlamp-pumped Ti:sapphire lasers {{have been}} {{reported}} to produce high-energy pulses with broad tunability. However, with the flashlamps operated close to their explosion energy, and thermal loading effects in the laser rod, these lasers were restricted to low repetition rates (typically around 10 PPS). Higher repetition rates at constant laser pulse energy reduce the flashlamp lifetime drastically. The author reports on a reliable flashlamp-pumped Ti:sapphire laser that has been operating at 120 PPS for over 109 shots with the only cavity or pump chamber maintenance being flashlamp changes less than every 2 · 108 pulses—the lowest maintenance reported. A specular dual-lamp pump chamber was used to pump a 4 mm · 6 inches, 0. 1 % doped Ti:sapphire rod. This resulted in a very low lasing threshold, which ensured a stable output at low pump levels. The criterion for pump power was to obtain a highly stable output {{at the edge of the}} selected tuning range, from 790 to 860 nm.

40|$|This study investigates by {{nonlinear}} constitutive equations {{the influence}} of tipping paper, cigarette paper, <b>filter,</b> and tobacco <b>rod</b> {{on the degree of}} filter ventilation and draw resistance. Starting from the laws of conservation, the path to the theory of fluid dynamics in porous media and Darcy's law is reviewed and, as an extension to Darcy's law, two different nonlinear pressure drop-flow relations are proposed. It is proven that these relations are valid constitutive equations and the partial differential equations for the stationary flow in an unlit cigarette covering anisotropic, inhomogeneous and nonlinear behaviour are derived. From these equations a system of ordinary differential equations for the one-dimensional flow in the cigarette is derived by averaging pressure and velocity over the cross section of the cigarette. By further integration, the concept of an electrical analog is reached and discussed in the light of nonlinear pressure drop-flow relations. By numerical calculations based on the system of ordinary differential equations, it is shown that {{the influence of}} nonlinearities cannot be neglected because variations in the degree of filter ventilation can reach up to 20 % of its nominal value...|$|R
40|$|This {{work has}} been {{fulfilled}} within the ATLAS collaboration. I present here two studies, both related with the ATLAS detector and its operation. The ATLAS detector is described in chapter 1 whereas chapter 2 shows {{an introduction to the}} ATLAS tile calorimeter and the TileCal Read-Out Drivers (ROD) where {{the first part of the}} thesis is developed. In chapter 3 I present the study and the implementation of the Optimal Filtering algorithm in the TileCal Read-Out Drivers. The ROD provides the energy and the arrival time of the digital signal that is generated in the tile calorimeter. These parameters are reconstructed online using the Optimal <b>Filtering</b> algorithm, the <b>RODs</b> also provide a quality factor of the reconstruction. This information is sent to the standard ATLAS acquisition data flow with a specific data format defined in this thesis. Chapter 4 contains a short introduction to the Standard Model, presents its problems and describes other theories like Supersymmetry, Little Higgs or Extra Dimension models that try to solve them. The ATLAS experiment is enhanced to detect the Higgs boson and to study the physics at the TeV scale. Chapter 5 shows the study of the Kaluza-Klein gluon resonances predicted by models with extra dimensions. These searches are investigated through the decays of the excited gluons to high transverse momentum jets (pT) measured in the tile calorimeter. In this chapter I also propose the measurement of the polarization of the top quark from the excited gluon decay to discriminate between different models with similar final signatures. A summary and the main conclusions of the analyses are presented in the last part of the thesis. On one hand the implementation of the Optimal Filtering algorithm in the ROD DSPs of TileCal and the validation of this algorithm using cosmic muons from the ATLAS commissioning has been done. And on the other hand the ATLAS sensitivity to observe signatures predicted by extra dimension models has been presented...|$|R
40|$|The {{functional}} role and spatial location of voltage-sensitive conductances that modify the light-evoked electrical signals were studied in retinal rods of the tiger salamander. An isolated rod was {{drawn into a}} suction electrode for recording membrane current and impaled with an intracellular electrode for recording membrane potential and passing current. A bright flash gave a rapid initial hyperpolarization that relaxed to a smaller plateau. Simultaneously the dark current of the outer segment was shut off with {{the time course of}} a rounded step function. This characteristic difference between the wave forms demonstrates that the voltage relaxation does not result from reopening of light-sensitive channels. The voltage relaxation in (2) did not require light or interruption of the dark current, as the wave form was duplicated by suddenly switching off a depolarizing current injected during steady saturating light. This is explained if the relaxation depends purely on voltage-sensitive conductances. The voltage response to a dim flash reached its peak value before the current response. The voltage wave form was predicted assuming that the recorded photo-current drove a linear high-pass filter with parameters derived from analysis of the voltage response to injection of a current step. When the intracellular voltage was changed by current injection the slope resistance of the outer segment slowly declined to a lower level, indicating that the outer segment contains a voltage-sensitive conductance. When a current step was injected in bright steady light, the current recorded from the outer segment consisted of a capacity component proportional to dV/dt and a small extracellular leakage current but no detectable ionic current. This supports other evidence indicating that light-sensitive channels comprise the main or exclusive ionic conductance of the outer segment. The behaviour in (5) is explained if the light-sensitive channels themselves are slowly opened by hyperpolarization and closed by depolarization. Analysis of the current-injection experiments suggests that most of the high-pass <b>filtering</b> in a <b>rod</b> results from the action of voltage-sensitive conductances located in the inner segment. Addition of 10 mM-CsCl to the Ringer solution abolished the relaxation in the voltage response to a bright flash but left intact the high-pass filtering of small signals. This would be explained by a selective block of one of two sets of voltage-sensitive channels in the inner segment or by a voltage-sensitive block of one kind of channel...|$|R
40|$|Cigarettes {{with similar}} design {{features}} but with either cellulose acetate or dual carbon filters {{were made at}} 1 -mg and 13 -mg “tar” levels, as determined under the ISO smoking procedure. Products were smoked under the ISO, Massachusetts and Canadian smoking regimes to provide per-cigarette and per-puff yields of twelve vapour phase (VP) smoke components. The yields generated at the lit end of the cigarette and the significant yield reductions caused by filter ventilation, selective (carbon) adsorption, tobacco rod ventilation and diffusion were estimated in a modelling approach. For a “ 1 -mg tar” carbon-filtered product {{it was estimated that}} the VP generated at the lit end was reduced by 99. 4 % to a machine yield of 17 µg/cig under ISO smoking conditions. Under the Canadian regime with 100 % vent blocking, the estimated total VP was lowered 20 % by tobacco rod effects and 15 % by carbon filter adsorption giving a machine yield of 3487 µg/cig. The carbon filter adsorbed less efficiently partly due to the artificially high smoke temperatures through the filter that would probably not be tolerated by human smokers. Under the Massachusetts regime with 50 % vent blocking, conditions better associated with human smoking, the total VP was lowered 51 % by filter ventilation, 22 % by tobacco rod effects and 17 % by carbon filter adsorption giving a machine yield of 659 µg/cig. Ventilation is used to achieve “tar”/nicotine/carbon monoxide yield ceilings at 10 / 1 / 10 mg based on the current ISO smoking method. If future regulations were to mandate further reductions in VP then this will only be selectively achieved by increasing <b>filter</b> or tobacco <b>rod</b> ventilation/porosity or by using selective adsorption. It is inevitable that manufacturers will need to add further ventilation into their product to comply with such regulations and this should be reflected in any smoking regime. Furthermore, regimes with 100 % vent blocking, that do not produce data reflecting the significant reductions in VP yields, provided to the smoker by ventilation, are misleading and their results will not correlate with relevant biomarker data. When proposing a different smoking regime, it is essential to understand the generation and transfer of smoke within cigarettes and factors involved in the subsequent data interpretation as described in this work. For regulatory evaluation purposes, cigarette characterisation using a regime that removes ventilation, one of the main design tools, is more misleading than the current ISO regime or one with partial vent blocking...|$|R
