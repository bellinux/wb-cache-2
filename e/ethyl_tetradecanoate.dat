50|$|Males produce pheromones in the cephalic {{part of the}} labial gland, {{and they}} mark objects in their flight paths with the {{volatile}} components of the gland secretion. This secretion is a complex mixture of sixty compounds of which 53% is ethyl (z)-tetradec-9-enoate, ethyl esters of fatty acids. Other components include ethyl dodecanoate (6%), <b>ethyl</b> <b>tetradecanoate</b> (2%), ethyl (Z)-hexadec-9-enoate (4%), ethyl (Z)-octadec-9-enoate (2%), hexadecan-1-ol (4%), (Z,Z,Z)-octadeca-9,12,15-trien-1-ol (1%), and (Z)-hexadec-7-enal (2%). The biosynthetic pathway of the pheromones is not well known, but {{it was suggested that}} they are produced from common lipids in the body. Young and old males of B. lucorum have similar quantities of labial gland secretions because the secretory activity continues throughout their lifetime with no dependence on age.|$|E
40|$|Changes in the {{volatile}} components of unpasteurized and pasteurized makgeolli during 30 days of storage were investigated by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and GC-olfactometry (GC-O). A total of 11 odor-active compounds such as 3 -methyl- 1 -butanol (isoamyl alcohol), 2 -methyl- 1 -butanol, 2, 3 -butanediol, butanoic acid, 3 -methylbutanoic acid (isovaleric acid), 2 -methylbutanoic acid, 3 -(methylthio) - 1 -propanol (methionol), 2 -phenylethanol, ethyl decanoate, ethyl dodecanoate, and <b>ethyl</b> <b>tetradecanoate</b> were determined {{in both the}} pasteurized and unpasteurized makgeolli during 30 days of storage. Although {{there were no significant}} differences in the concentrations of odor-active compounds at the initial storage time, most of odor-active compounds were more significantly increased in unpasteurized makgeolli compared to the pasteurized one during the storage period...|$|E
40|$|International audienceVapor {{pressures}} of five {{saturated fatty acid}} ethyl esters (FAEEs), ethyl hexanoate (or ethyl caproate), ethyl octanoate (or ethyl caprylate), ethyl decanoate (or ethyl caprate), ethyl dodecanoate (or ethyl laurate), and <b>ethyl</b> <b>tetradecanoate</b> (or ethyl myristate), were measured at pressures from 1 Pa to 180 kPa and temperatures from (253. 15 to 463. 15) K using a static apparatus. These esters are a light fraction present in biodiesel derived from palmist oil and copra oil (Ballerini and Alazard-Toux, Les biocarburants; IFP Publications: Paris, 2006). The experimental data (P-T) were smoothed using the Antoine equation and compared with the available literature values. The molar enthalpies of vaporization at the mean temperature of the experimental range were derived from the Clausius-Clapeyron equation. From these results the standard enthalpies of vaporization at T = 298. 15 K were calculated...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe vapor {{pressures}} of three binary systems, (ethyl hexanoate (1) + n-tetradecane (2)), (ethyl decanoate (1) + n-tetradecane (2)), and (<b>ethyl</b> <b>tetradecanoate</b> (1) + n-tetradecane (2)), were measured {{by means of}} a static apparatus at temperatures between (373. 15 and 453. 15) K. We correlated the data with the Antoine equation. The molar excess Gibbs energies G(E) obtained from these data by using Barker's method were fitted to the Redlich-Kister equation. A maximum azeotropic behavior is observed for the binary mixture {ethyl decanoate (I) + n-tetradecane (2) }. Positive values of the excess Gibbs energy are obtained for all of the investigated temperatures and compositions. The data were also correlated by using Wilson equation. The predicted G(E) obtained by using group contribution model, UNIFAC (Gmehling version), are different to the experimental values. These deviations are more important for systems {ethyl decanoate (1) + n-tetradecane (2) } and {ethyl tetradecanoate (1) + n-tetradecane (2) }...|$|E
40|$|Two {{analytical}} methods based on gas chromatography with direct injection are described for the quantitative analysis of volatile compounds (acetals, aldehydes, esters, alcohols, and volatile phenols) in cider brandies. Analytes {{were divided into}} major, 15, and minor volatile, 24, compounds depending on their usual concentration in samples. Parameters usually tested for method validation are evaluated. Correlation coefficients are calculated to estimate linearity, obtaining values higher than 0. 999. Detection limits range between 0. 325 mg/L (1 -propanol) and 1. 663 mg/L (methanol) among the major volatile compounds and between 0. 086 mg/L (ethyl 2 -methylbutyrate) and 0. 332 mg/L (<b>ethyl</b> <b>tetradecanoate)</b> among the minor volatiles. Mean recoveries ranged between 109 % (ethyl lactate) and 95 % (1 -butanol) for major volatiles and between 109 % (1 -octen- 3 -ol) and 94 % (ethyl 2 -methylbutyrate) for minor volatiles, thus confirming the accuracy of both methods. Reproducibility for major volatiles is < 5. 4 % (furfural) in all cases and < 9. 6 % (hexyl acetate) for minor volatiles. Moreover, {{the accuracy of the}} methods is evaluated by analyzing a certified whisky and five samples from interlaboratory assays, generally obtaining results in accordance with previous values...|$|E
40|$|Wine aroma is an {{important}} characteristic and {{may be related to}} certain specific parameters, such as raw material and production process. The complexity of Merlot wine aroma was considered suitable for comprehensive two-dimensional gas chromatography (GCGC), as this technique offers superior performance when compared to one-dimensional gas chromatography (1 D-GC). The profile of volatile compounds of Merlot wine was, for the first time, qualitatively analyzed by HS-SPME-GCxGC with a time-of-flight mass spectrometric detector (TOFMS), resulting in 179 compounds tentatively identified by comparison of experimental GCxGC retention indices and mass spectra with literature 1 D-GC data and 155 compounds tentatively identified only by mass spectra comparison. A set of GCGC experimental retention indices was also, for the first time, presented for a specific inverse set of columns. Esters were present in higher number (94), followed by alcohols (80), ketones (29), acids (29), aldehydes (23), terpenes (23), lactones (16), furans (14), sulfur compounds (9), phenols (7), pyrroles (5), C 13 -norisoprenoids (3), and pyrans (2). GCxGC/TOFMS parameters were improved and optimal conditions were: a polar (polyethylene glycol) /medium polar (50 % phenyl 50 % dimethyl arylene siloxane) column set, oven temperature offset of 10 ÂºC, 7 s as modulation period and 1. 4 s of hot pulse duration. Co-elutions came up to 138 compounds in 1 D and some of them were resolved in 2 D. Among the coeluted compounds, thirty-three volatiles co-eluted in both 1 D and 2 D and their tentative identification was possible only due to spectral deconvolution. Some compounds that might have important contribution to aroma notes were included in these superimposed peaks. Structurally organized distribution of compounds in the 2 D space was observed for esters, aldehydes and ketones, alcohols, thiols, lactones, acids and also inside subgroups, as occurred with esters and alcohols. The Fischer Ratio was useful for establishing the analytes responsible for the main differences between Merlot and non-Merlot wines. Differentiation among Merlot wines and wines of other grape varieties were mainly perceived through the following components: ethyl dodecanoate, 1 -hexanol, ethyl nonanoate, ethyl hexanoate, ethyl decanoate, dehydro- 2 -methyl- 3 (2 H) thiophenone, 3 -methyl butanoic acid, <b>ethyl</b> <b>tetradecanoate,</b> methyl octanoate, 1, 4 butanediol, and 6 -methyloctan- 1 -ol. 201...|$|E
