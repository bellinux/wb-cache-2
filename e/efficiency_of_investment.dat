50|$|Asimakopulos (1971, 1991), Piero Garegnani (1978) {{and several}} Post Keynesians offered a {{troublesome}} critique to Keynes' original formulation. Asimakopulos et al. questioned the very {{possibility of a}} downward-sloping Marginal <b>Efficiency</b> <b>of</b> <b>Investment</b> (MEI) function {{in the presence of}} unemployment. In particular, we can note that Keynes's multiplier story implies that if investment is undertaken then, by the multiplier, aggregate demand and output rises. But if the marginal <b>efficiency</b> <b>of</b> <b>investment</b> function is dependent on expected future returns, then should not the increased income and thus aggregate demand from the multiplier imply higher future returns? If so, then the MEI function ought to shift outwards to the right. This, in turn, implies that investment ought to increase which leads to another increase in aggregate demand and thus the MEI curve shifts out again, raising investment, etc.|$|E

Huffman).This paper {{contains}} the utility function {{commonly referred to}} as Greenwood-Hercowitz-Huffman preferences. With this utility function there is no income effect on labor supply. As a result, labor can be solved for independently of consumption, which is a great simplification. In this research shocks to the <b>efficiency</b> <b>of</b> <b>investment</b> are the driving force for business. This is different than the typical TFP shocks used in the real business cycle literature. Last, the paper introduced capacity utilization into the modern business cycle literature.|$|E

5000|$|In his General Theory, John Maynard Keynes {{proposed}} an investment {{function of the}} sort < [...] I = I0 + I(r) > where the relationship between investment and interest rate was of a rather naive form. Firms were presumed to [...] "rank" [...] various investment projects depending on their [...] "{{internal rate of return}}" [...] (or [...] "marginal efficiency of investment") and thereafter, faced with a given rate of interest, chose those projects whose internal rate of return exceeded the rate of interest. With an infinite number of projects available, this amounted to arguing that firms would invest until their marginal <b>efficiency</b> <b>of</b> <b>investment</b> was equal to the rate of interest, i.e. < [...] MEI = r >.|$|E

Estimation <b>of</b> economic <b>efficiency</b> <b>of</b> <b>investments</b> {{is the most important}} problem on the development stage of creating the project, modernization and development of production, including car service. Car service {{is one of the most}} intensive developing sectors of Russian economics due to increasing amount of vehicles, and therefore, it is a significant part of works and services that compose the gross domestic product. At the same time, <b>investments</b> in companies <b>of</b> car service are risky, because wrong prognosis <b>of</b> economic <b>efficiency</b> can lead to unprofitability of the company or inadmissible time <b>of</b> <b>investments</b> payback.

40|$|The {{presence}} of corruption inflicts substantial economic costs on an economy. Corruption {{is a double}} edged sword; it reduces both the volume and <b>efficiency</b> <b>of</b> <b>investment</b> and thus economic growth. This note identifies a simple concept of the macroeconomic <b>efficiency</b> <b>of</b> <b>investment,</b> establishes its linkage with corruption and estimates the relationship between them. The <b>efficiency</b> <b>of</b> <b>investment</b> variables computed by the authors and Transparency International’s Corruption Perception Indices are used as data. The note concludes that substantial gains {{in terms of economic}} growth could be achieved if corruption is reduced. Corruption is popularly defined as the abuse of public power for private benefit. The act often consists of paying bribes to public officials by private beneficiaries as compensation for the abuse. However, not all acts of corruption result in the payment of bribes. A powerful minister can locate a new investment project in his home town unsuitable for that particular activity or he could influence the sanctioning of big business loans to his cronies and friends and still not take an...|$|E
40|$|Abstract @ We {{employ a}} neoclassical business-cycle model that {{builds on the}} Greenwood, Hercowitz, and Huffman (1988) variable-utilization {{framework}} to study two sources of business-cycle fluctuations: marginal <b>efficiency</b> <b>of</b> <b>investment</b> shocks, and total factor productivity shocks. The parameters of the model are estimated using a Bayesian procedure that accommodates prior uncertainty about their magnitudes; from these estimates, posterior distributions of the two shocks are obtained. The postwar U. S. experience suggests that both shocks are important in understanding fluctuations, but that total factor productivity shocks are primarily responsible for beginning and ending recessions.

40|$|This paper {{explores the}} broad {{themes of the}} {{literature}} on economic growth. It makesthe following two broad conclusions. First, it notes that the <b>efficiency</b> <b>of</b> <b>investment</b> {{is as important as the}} level of investment in determining growth performance. Secondly, it states that keeping to a minimum the distortion of resource allocation by government policies makes saving and investment more efficient and promotes long-term economic growth. Policies that contribute to the <b>efficiency</b> <b>of</b> <b>investment</b> and that lower distortions in resource allocation will thus generally encourage growth. Policies that promote investment, liberalize trade restrictions and remove distortions in financial markets are likely to raise a country's long-run rate of growth. It is noted, however, that more research is needed to formulate structural models of growth that give clear guidance on the effect of various policy measures.
