30|$|The {{question}} is how does the growth in cashless payments fuel the economy. The literature suggests two prominent direct benefits of cashless payments on GDP growth: lower costs of storing and processing physical currency and increased tax collection. Bolt et al. (2008), using payment and banking data between Netherlands and Norway (1990 – 2004), estimate that using cashless payment instruments may save 0.7 billion Euro in bank costs for Norway (0.35 % of GDP in 2004) and 2.9 billion Euro for the Netherlands (0.61 % of GDP). This means that, on a <b>discounted</b> <b>basis</b> over time, shifting from 90 % paper-based instruments and cash to 90 % electronic and card instruments could save about 2300 Euro per person in each country. Kruger and Seitz (2014) estimate the cost by simply multiplying a representative hourly wage rate and {{the total number of}} ATM withdrawals per year. They indicate a significant saving if an economy graduates to cashless payments.|$|R
40|$|Given {{the recent}} focus on Eurozone debt {{crisis and the}} credit rating {{downgrade}} not only of US debt, but that of other countries and many UK major banking institutions, this paper aims to explain the concept of bond yield, its different measures and bond pricing equation. Yields on capital market instruments are rarely quoted on the same basis, which makes direct comparison between different as investment choices impossible. Some debt instruments are quoted on <b>discount</b> <b>basis,</b> whilst coupon-bearing ones accrue interest differently, offer different compounding opportunities, have different coupon payment frequencies, and manage non-business day maturity dates differently. Moreover, rules governing debt vary across countries, markets and currencies, making yield calculation and comparison a rather complex issue. Thus, some fundamental concepts applicable to debt instrument yield measurement, with focus on bond equation, are presented here. In addition, bond equation expressed in annuity form and used to apply Newton-Raphson algorithm to derive true bond yield is also shown...|$|R

50|$|Treasury {{bills are}} {{instrument}} of short-term borrowing by the Government of India, issued as promissory notes under discount. The interest received on {{them is the}} discount, which {{is the difference between}} the price at which they are issued and their redemption value. They have assured yield and negligible risk of default.Under one classification, treasury bills are categorised as ad hoc, tap and auction bills. Under another one, it is classified on the maturity period like 91-days TBs, 182-days TBs, 364-days TBs and also 10-days TBs which has two types.In the recent times (2002-03, 2003-04), the Reserve Bank of India has been issuing only 91-day and 364-day treasury bills. The auction format of 91-day treasury bill has changed from uniform price to multiple price to encourage more responsible bidding from the market players.The bills are of two kinds- Adhoc and regular. The adhoc bills are issued for investment by the state governments, semi government departments and foreign central banks for temporary investment. They are not sold to banks and general public. The treasury bills sold to the public and banks are called regular treasury bills. They are freely marketable and commercial banks buy entire quantities of such bills, issued on tender. They are bought and sold on <b>discount</b> <b>basis.</b> Ad-hoc bills were abolished in April 1997.|$|R

The substantial rate of return from IgT is due to the combination of the moderate price paid by PMC, the strong financial return provided by the AAL1gator family of products, and the contribution of the remaining San Jose team to several successful PMC projects, including the strong selling Arrow2xGE Ethernet over SONET mapping device.

40|$|We build a no-arbitrage {{model of}} the term structure, using two {{stochastic}} factors on each date, the short-term interest rate and the forward premium. The model is essentially an extension to two factors of the lognormal interest rate model of Black-Karazinski. It allows for mean reversion in the short rate and in the forward premium. The method is computationally efficient for several reasons. First, interest rates are defined on a bankers' <b>discount</b> <b>basis,</b> as linear functions of zero-coupon bond prices, enabling us to use the no-arbitrage condition to compute bond prices without resorting to cumbersome iterative methods. Second, the multivariate-binomial methodology of Ho-Stapleton-Subrahmanyam is extended so that a multi-period tree of rates with the no-arbitrage property can be constructed using analytical methods. The method uses a recombining two-dimensional binomial lattice of interest rates that minimizes the number of states and term structures. Third, the problem of computing {{a large number of}} term structures is simplified by using a limited number of bucket rates in each term structure scenario. In addition to these computational advantages, a key feature of the model is that it is consistent with the observed term structure of volatilities implied by the prices of interest rate caps and floors. We illustrate the use of the model by pricing American-style and Bermudan-style options on interest rates. Option prices for realistic examples using forty time periods are shown to be computable in seconds. ...|$|R

Previously, this process involved solving a complex system of equations with rational polynomial coefficients.

Distributional analysis of image latencies through ex-Gaussian modeling showed an inverse relation between vividness and latency. However, recall was unrelated to image latency. The follow-up Experiment 2 showed that the processes underlying trial-by-trial vividness ratings are unrelated to the Vividness of Visual Imagery Questionnaire (VVIQ), as further supported by a meta-analysis of a randomly selected sample of relevant literature. The present findings suggest that vividness may act as an index of availability of long-term sensory traces, playing a non-epiphenomenal role in facilitating the access of those memories...|$|R
