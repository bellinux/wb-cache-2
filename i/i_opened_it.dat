500|$|In 1984, Bannon's {{books were}} {{featured}} in the documentary Before Stonewall about how {{gay men and lesbians}} lived prior to the 1969 Stonewall riots, wherein one woman remembered picking up one of Bannon's books for the first time: [...] "I picked up this paperback and <b>I</b> <b>opened</b> <b>it</b> up... and it sent a shiver of excitement in my whole body that I had never felt before." [...] She was {{featured in the}} Canadian documentary [...] in 1992, which recounted women's personal stories of living as lesbians from the 1940s to 1960s. The books were selected for the Quality Paperback Book Club in 1995. Bannon also provided the foreword for Strange Sisters: The Art of Lesbian Pulp Fiction 1949–1969 in 1999, discussing her reaction to the artwork on her own books and the other lesbian pulp fiction books she bought and read. Five of The Beebo Brinker Chronicles were reissued by Cleis Press again between 2001 and 2003—excluding The Marriage—with autobiographical forewords that described Bannon's experiences of writing the books and her reaction to their popularity, causing another wave of interest.|$|E
60|$|The packet {{was in my}} hand. <b>I</b> <b>opened</b> <b>it,</b> {{and read}} the writing of Agnes.|$|E
60|$|MRS. ERLYNNE. [R.C.] Your {{husband has}} never seen the letter. I-- saw it, <b>I</b> <b>opened</b> <b>it.</b> I--read it.|$|E

5000|$|... "I {{only have}} two dreams. One dream {{is that someone}} will {{knock on the door}} and <b>I</b> will <b>open</b> <b>it</b> and they give me a check for $150,000 for the magazine. Second dream is that someone knocks at the door and <b>I</b> <b>open</b> <b>it</b> up and he gives me a corned beef sandwich. Those are my only two dreams. I'm not asking for much. Really, I'm not. And I think they're both reachable." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I am told, sir, {{that you}} are the bearer of a {{despatch}} from the Spanish general, Romana. Before <b>I</b> <b>open</b> <b>it,</b> will you explain how it was that you came to be with him?" ...|$|R
60|$|I {{walked to}} the door, waited a moment before <b>I</b> <b>opened</b> <b>it,</b> and turned round {{to look at her}} again.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>opened</b> <b>it</b> at {{once and}} read these lines. I copy them here, {{thinking}} it best to destroy the original for caution's sake.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>opened</b> <b>it</b> {{softly and}} found Miss Jellyby {{shivering}} {{there with a}} broken candle in a broken candlestick {{in one hand and}} an egg-cup in the other.|$|E
5000|$|It was Shaw, in {{his final}} Saturday Review piece, who {{bestowed}} upon Beerbohm the lasting epithet, [...] "the Incomparable Max" [...] when he wrote, [...] "The younger generation is knocking at the door; and as <b>I</b> <b>open</b> <b>it</b> there steps spritely in the incomparable Max".|$|R
6000|$|But Fanny {{was holding}} up my {{envelope}} between both her thumbs and forefingers, and steadily smiling at me, over its margin. [...] "A joke, Midgetina; {{and one of}} your very own. How exciting. And how bulgy. May <b>I</b> <b>open</b> <b>it?</b> <b>I</b> wouldn't miss it for the world." ...|$|R
6000|$|The Arethusa: [...] "Well, sir, oblige me {{at least}} by looking at this book. Here, <b>I</b> <b>open</b> <b>it</b> with my eyes shut. Read one of these songs--read this one--and tell me, you who are a man of intelligence, {{if it would be}} {{possible}} to sing it at a fair?" ...|$|R
6000|$|At {{this point}} in the {{proceedings}} there was another ring at the front door. Jeeves shimmered out and came back with a telegram. <b>I</b> <b>opened</b> <b>it.</b> It ran: ...|$|E
60|$|But one day {{a letter}} did come from Mark. I dared not read it until I was safely in my own room. Then <b>I</b> <b>opened</b> <b>it</b> with {{trembling}} fingers.|$|E
6000|$|... "We {{looked at}} each other; both of us feeling the same doubt of how the day would end. Miss Minerva pointed impatiently to the lawyer's reply. <b>I</b> <b>opened</b> <b>it.</b>|$|E
60|$|CZAR (to PRINCE PAUL). <b>I</b> won't <b>open</b> <b>it.</b> There may be {{something}} in it.|$|R
6000|$|THE ARETHUSA. Well, sir, oblige me {{at least}} by looking at this book. Here, <b>I</b> <b>open</b> <b>it</b> with my eyes shut. Read one of these songs - read this one - and tell me, you who are a man of intelligence, {{if it would be}} {{possible}} to sing it at a fair? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It is I, Miss Hannay--Bathurst. Danger threatens you, and {{you must}} escape at once. Rabda is waiting for you outside. Please go {{to the door and}} stand there until <b>I</b> <b>open</b> <b>it.</b> <b>I</b> have no doubt that I shall succeed, but if {{anything}} should go wrong, go and lie down again at once." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No {{one knows}} it {{but you and}} I. The paper was left here for me by mistake. <b>I</b> <b>opened</b> <b>it</b> before I {{saw that it was}} {{addressed}} to her." ...|$|E
60|$|She ran to {{the door}} as <b>I</b> <b>opened</b> <b>it,</b> and pushed it to again. Overwhelmed by the {{violence}} of her agitation, my father had sunk into a chair while she was speaking.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh--what a mistake!--it is not mine. Nor {{is it for}} my shepherd. It is for Miss Everdene's. You {{had better}} take it on to him--Gabriel Oak--and say <b>I</b> <b>opened</b> <b>it</b> in mistake." ...|$|E
60|$|In the {{intervals}} of this operation, though {{my head was}} giddy and disturbed by the tobacco, I took up the Bible to read. No sooner did <b>I</b> <b>open</b> <b>it,</b> but there appeared to me these words Call on me in the day of trouble, and I will deliver thee, and thou shall glorify me.|$|R
60|$|He {{handed it}} to me, and <b>I</b> tore <b>it</b> <b>open.</b> <b>It</b> {{contained}} only a few lines, in a large sprawling hand-writing.|$|R
6000|$|... "I try to {{struggle}} against it, but, coming after the strange complication of circumstances {{that has been}} closing round me for weeks past, {{there is something in}} this latest event of all that shakes my nerves. But one last chance of detection stood in my way when <b>I</b> <b>opened</b> my diary yesterday. When <b>I</b> <b>open</b> <b>it</b> to-day, that chance is removed by Mr. Brock's death. It means something; I wish I knew what.|$|R
6000|$|Two weeks {{afterward}} {{the postman}} {{brought me a}} large, fat envelope. <b>I</b> <b>opened</b> <b>it,</b> and took out something that I had seen before, and this typewritten letter from a magazine that encourages society fiction: ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Let me see it,' I said. He {{took another}} {{letter from his}} wallet, and [...] gave it to me. <b>I</b> <b>opened</b> <b>it,</b> and read, in my own handwriting, this [...] answer, {{addressed}} to you: ...|$|E
6000|$|I {{had just}} replied {{that we also}} regretted {{extremely}} the necessity for this separation, when a boy brought me a letter. <b>I</b> <b>opened</b> <b>it,</b> and found it was from Mr. Enderton. It read as follows: ...|$|E
6000|$|... "'Oh, any old key {{will fit}} that bureau. When I was a youngster <b>I</b> have <b>opened</b> <b>it</b> {{myself with the}} key of the box-room cupboard.' ...|$|R
60|$|Half-past Eight.--I closed {{this book}} under the {{consciousness}} of impending ruin, <b>I</b> <b>open</b> <b>it</b> an hour after, thanks be to God, with the strong hope that matters may be got over safely and honourably, in a mercantile sense. Cadell came at eight to communicate a letter from Hurst and Robinson, intimating they had stood the storm, and though clamorous for assistance from Scotland, saying they had prepared their strongholds without need of the banks.|$|R
60|$|Ten! I {{associated}} {{the idea}} with Miss Penclosa's note. It was lying before {{me on the}} table, and <b>I</b> tore <b>it</b> <b>open.</b> <b>It</b> was scribbled in pencil in a peculiarly angular handwriting.|$|R
6000|$|... "Go away," [...] I said, but the knocker {{would not}} go away. So <b>I</b> <b>opened.</b> <b>It</b> was my agent, who whispered in an excited voice, [...] "The count's quite correct, you are in by seven." ...|$|E
60|$|In {{one corner}} was a closet. <b>I</b> <b>opened</b> <b>it,</b> but found it {{contained}} nothing but bottles of liquor and medicine, the former predominating. I closed {{the closet and}} then wondered what I should attack next.|$|E
6000|$|The hall-porter {{presently}} entered, {{bearing a}} huge parcel, which {{had just arrived}} by post. <b>I</b> <b>opened</b> <b>it</b> with all the excitement that an unexpected parcel can cause, and murmured, like Thackeray's sailor-man, 'Claret, perhaps, Mumm, I hope----' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Then {{open the}} door for me," [...] said the young man; [...] "for <b>I</b> cannot <b>open</b> <b>it</b> for myself, as there is neither lock nor key to it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'You cannot mistake it, Sir; it's {{the only}} one that opens into the garden. Tap at it when you hear the clock strike, and <b>I</b> will <b>open</b> <b>it</b> instantly.' ...|$|R
60|$|But go <b>I</b> did, and <b>opened</b> <b>it,</b> defiant-like, kind of {{hoping it}} was Mark Foster {{to see the}} tears on my face. <b>I</b> <b>opened</b> it--and {{staggered}} back like I'd got a blow.|$|R
