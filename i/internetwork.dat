25|$|By {{the summer}} of 1973, Kahn and Cerf had worked out a {{fundamental}} reformulation, in which the differences between local network protocols were hidden by using a common <b>internetwork</b> protocol, and, instead of the network being responsible for reliability, as in the ARPANET, this function was delegated to the hosts. Cerf credits Hubert Zimmermann and Louis Pouzin, designer of the CYCLADES network, with important influences on this design. The protocol was implemented as the Transmission Control Program, first published in 1974.|$|E
25|$|When {{the term}} Internet {{is used to}} refer to the {{specific}} global system of interconnected Internet Protocol (IP) networks, the word is a proper noun that should be written with an initial capital letter. In common use and the media, it is often erroneously not capitalized, viz. the internet. Some guides specify that the word should be capitalized when used as a noun, but not capitalized when used as an adjective. The Internet is also {{often referred to as the}} Net, as a short form of network. Historically, as early as 1849, the word internetted was used uncapitalized as an adjective, meaning interconnected or interwoven. The designers of early computer networks used internet both as a noun and as a verb in shorthand form of <b>internetwork</b> or internetworking, meaning interconnecting computer networks.|$|E
40|$|This project {{addresses}} {{problems for}} theorists {{of writing and}} composition that arose in the 1990 s when capital privatizes the production of <b>internetworked</b> writing and starts operating {{in the manner of}} a practicing compositionist. I begin by noting that capital in the 1990 s converted <b>internetworked</b> writing machines into fixed capital and started composing its version of the cultural form of the 2 ̆ 2 social 2 ̆ 2 we call the Internet. Thereafter, I argue that composition theorists can best understand the Internet, <b>internetworked</b> writing, and <b>internetworked</b> subjectivities if they regard capital as a formidable compositionist, one capable of making the machinofactured <b>internetworked</b> composition into a privately owned means for organizing the direct production of <b>internetworked</b> social writing and <b>internetworked</b> social being. I engage with this problem by pointing out that capital 2 ̆ 7 s private production of the <b>internetworked</b> social subsumes both the interindividual site of sociolinguistic p roduction and the individual <b>internetworked</b> writer. I go on to establish that capital uses its control of end-user license agreements to transform the writer subsumed by capital into a privately controlled intellectual property. I argue that capital subjects <b>internetworked</b> writers to a form of accelerated decrepitude because the <b>internetworked</b> writer 2 ̆ 7 s cycle of life gets tied in to cycles of software and hardware upgrade, overwrite, and erasure. And, finally, I demonstrate that capital converts the <b>internetworked</b> population of commodified writers, along with their commodified writing and commodified formal compositions, into allegorical symbols insofar as 2 ̆ 2 every commodity is a symbol, since, in so far as it is value, it is only the material envelope of the human labour spent upon it 2 ̆ 2 (Marx, Capital, vol. 1, chapter 2). On the strength of these positions, I argue that composition theorists should develop a theory of <b>internetworked</b> writing and composition that makes the following assumpt ions: capital has become a compositionist; <b>internetworked</b> compositionists and compositions have become commodities; and <b>internetworked</b> compositions, compositionists, and composition theorists [...] for having become commodities [...] have entered into an age of allegory [...] that is, an age wherein <b>internetworked</b> compositions necessarily make other, allegorical reference to relations of production and exchange that support capital 2 ̆ 7 s ongoing production of the composed, commodified, and festishized <b>internetworked</b> 2 ̆ 2 social. 2 ̆...|$|R

50|$|With an <b>internetwork</b> layer none of {{this would}} be necessary: inter-domain routing would happen at the <b>internetwork</b> layer, while intra-domain routing within each network would occur at each {{respective}} network layer. NATs would not be required since each network could have its own internal address space; only the addresses in the <b>internetwork</b> layer would have to be common. Moreover, congestion could be conﬁned to individual networks, instead of having to deal with it at a global scope as it is done today. The <b>internetwork</b> layer was there in previous <b>internetwork</b> architectures, for example, the INWG architecture depicted in Figure 3, which was designed in 1976.

40|$|Abstract—After {{classifying}} <b>internetworks</b> into type internet-works, protocol <b>internetworks,</b> {{and organization}} <b>internetworks,</b> this paper {{focuses on the}} last of these. A key problem with organization internetworking is global routing scalability. In developing the NEI architecture to address this problem, some basic mechanisms/tenets of IP internetworking are upended. In NEI, internetworking addresses are not assigned to hosts or gateways (or even their interfaces); instead a four-tuple vec-tor of independently administered intra-organization addresses, stub organization identifiers, transit organization identifiers, and country codes is used. With this basic change, DHCP, ARP and longest-prefix matching are no longer required. Another basic tenet for recent work on location/identifier separation, which is that stub organizations should be given provider independent addresses to minimize changes required when such organizations change their transit providers, is also confronted. A holistic solution that takes a “design-for-change ” approach allows for a draconian rule of only allowing provider aggregatable addressing for stub organizations. It leverages the location-dependent four-tuple concept and combines this with careful DNS resource record structures, and DNS cache updates. Multihoming, mobility, and transit provider changes in NEI are also described. I...|$|R
