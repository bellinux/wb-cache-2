40|$|This paper {{evaluates the}} {{effectiveness}} of several pricing rules intended to promote entry into a network industry dominated by an incumbent carrier. Drawing {{on the work of}} Cournot and Hotelling, we develop a model of competition between two interconnected networks. In a symmetric equilibrium, the price of cross-network calls exceeds the price of internal calls. This "calling circle discount" tends to "tip" the industry to a monopoly equilibrium as would a network externality. By <b>equalizing</b> <b>charges</b> for terminating calls, reciprocity eliminates differences between internal and cross-network prices and makes monopoly less likely. Imputation counteracts an incentive by the dominant network to "price squeeze" a rival by eliminating differences in the wholesale price of termination and the implicit price for internal use. By increasing profits of rival networks and increasing their subscribers' surplus, imputation supports additional entry. Finally, an unbundling rule reduces termination fees charged by a dominant network that was engaging in pure bundling. Again, entry will be facilitated as rival networks offer potential subscribers a more attractive rate schedule. two-way networks, interconnection, reciprocity, imputation, unbundling...|$|R

40|$|Balancing {{battery cells}} {{is a key}} task for battery {{management}} systems (BMS). Imbalances of cells decrease the capacity and lifetime of the battery pack. Many balancing topologies and strategies have been proposed to balance the electric charges among cells {{and most of the}} intelligent control strategies select cells (to shuttle charges) by comparing their terminal voltages. However, the nature of battery equalization is to balance the energy stored in individual cells. The measured terminal voltage is just an external characteristic and cannot accurately reflect the state of charge (SOC) of the cell, especially in a noisy environment. Additionally, when the consistencies of cells are very poor, balancing the cells with terminal voltages will lead to serious errors. In this paper, we introduced a novel battery balancing method, in which the charge-balancing criterion was not the cell voltage, but the shuttling capacities among cells. Data stream mining (DSM) technique was used to calculate the shuttling capacities. A single switched capacitor (SSC) based cell balancing topology was used to test the performance of the proposed method. With the obtained summary information, the cells, the sequence, and the quantity of the <b>equalized</b> <b>charge</b> can be decided automatically by the proposed algorithm. The simulation and experiment results have shown that the proposed method was effective and convenient...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{experimental verification}} {{of the impact}} of individual battery equalization on battery life and performance. A study of two battery systems, one equipped with PowerCheq equalizers, a new battery equalization device, and one without, was conducted over 450 charge and discharge cycles simulating an electric scooter drive routine. The data clearly shows that the batteries equipped with the PowerCheq devices (individual battery equalizers) outperformed those with no equalization as well as those employing string equalization. In fact, the battery without the equalizers reached its end of life (80 % of initial capacity) after 140 drive cycles while the one with the equalizers lasted more than 450 drive cycles, thus tripling battery life. The use of modular, real-time individual battery equalizers allows batteries to stay <b>equalized</b> during <b>charge</b> as well as discharge cycles thus improving battery life and longevity.

50|$|A {{piezoelectric}} cantilever {{is mounted}} directly above {{a base of}} the radioactive isotope nickel-63. All of the radiation emitted as the millicurie-level nickel-63 thin film decays {{is in the form}} of beta radiation, which consists of electrons. As the cantilever accumulates the emitted electrons, it builds up a negative charge at the same time that the isotope film becomes positively charged. The beta particles essentially transfer electronic charge from the thin film to the cantilever. The opposite charges cause the cantilever to bend toward the isotope film. Just as the cantilever touches the thin-film isotope, the charge jumps the gap. That permits current to flow back onto the isotope, <b>equalizing</b> the <b>charge</b> and resetting the cantilever. As long as the isotope is decaying - a process that can last for decades - the tiny cantilever will continue its up-and-down motion. As the cantilever directly generates electricity when deformed, a charge pulse is released each time the cantilever cycles.|$|R

We show that in the holographic dual description, the crystal is made out of pairs of dyons with e=g=± 1 charges in a salt-like arrangement. We argue that with increasing density the dyon masses and topological <b>charges</b> <b>equalize,</b> turning the salt-like configuration to a bcc of half-instantons. The latter is dual to a cubic crystal of half-skyrmions.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION - INDEPENDENT CLAIMS are included for methods for preparing (I) or a layer of (I) by applying a powdered mixture of (I) and a binder to the substrate. USE - The use of (I) is claimed for purifying aqueous liquids (preferably waste water, ground water or percolating water), specifically by treating the liquid with (I), passing the liquid over a substrate coated with (I) or treating the liquid in a vessel coated with (I). In presence of light (e. g. sunlight or light from a suitable lamp), (I) catalyzes the degradation of organic impurities, e. g. chlorinated organic compounds or other non- or difficultly-biodegradable materials. ADVANTAGE - The presence of PVI markedly reduces the photocorrosive properties and increases the photocatalytic degradation rate (e. g. as demonstrated using the test materials dichloroacetic acid and alizarin red S), by compensating for the disruption of the disruption of the TiO 2 crystal lattice by Fe 3 +, <b>equalizing</b> the <b>charge</b> and improving the crystallinity...|$|R
40|$|This study aims {{to develop}} an {{accurate}} model of a charge equalization controller (CEC) that manages individual cell monitoring and <b>equalizing</b> by <b>charging</b> and discharging series-connected lithium-ion (Li-ion) battery cells. In this concept, an intelligent control algorithm is developed to activate bidirectional cell switches and control direct current (DC) –DC converter switches along with pulse width modulation (PWM) generation. Individual models of an electric vehicle (EV) -sustainable Li-ion battery, optimal power rating, a bidirectional flyback DC–DC converter, and charging and discharging controllers are integrated to develop a small-scale CEC model that can be implemented for 10 series-connected Li-ion battery cells. Results show that the charge equalization controller operates at 91 % efficiency and performs well in equalizing both overdischarged and overcharged cells on time. Moreover, the outputs of the CEC model show that the desired balancing level occurs at 2 % of state of charge difference and that all cells are operated within a normal range. The configuration, execution, control, power loss, cost, size, and efficiency of the developed CEC model are {{compared with those of}} existing controllers. The proposed model is proven suitable for high-tech storage systems toward the advancement of sustainable EV technologies and renewable source of applications...|$|R

40|$|A new {{molecular}} dynamics {{model in which}} the point charges on atomic sites are allowed to fluctuate {{in response to the}} environment is developed and applied to water. The idea for treating charges as variables is based on the concept of electronegativity equalization according to which: (a) The electronegativity of an atomic site is dependent on the atom's type and charge and is perturbed by the electrostatic potential it experiences from its neighbors and (b) Charge is transferred between atomic sites {{in such a way that}} electronegativities are <b>equalized.</b> The <b>charges</b> are treated as dynamical variables using an extended Lagrangian method in which the charges are given a fictitious mass, velocities and kinetic energy and then propagated according to Newtonian mechanics along with the atomic degrees of freedom. Models for water with fluctuating charges are developed using the geometries of two common fixed-charge water potentials: the simple point charge (SPC) and the 4 -point transferable intermolecular potential (TIP 4 P). Both fluctuating charge models give accurate predictions for gas-phase and liquid state properties, including radial distribution functions, the dielectric constant, and the diffusion constant. The method does not introduce any new intermolecular interactions beyond those already present in the fixed charge models and increases the computer time by only a factor of 1. 1, making this method tractable for large systems.

40|$|Energy {{harvesting}} is {{an important}} feature that can be implemented in mobile devices {{to provide them with}} extended autonomy, yet it poses several challenges in terms of optimal battery usage. In this paper, we highlight that some non-ideal effects, especially the so-called "charge recovery," can have a dramatic impact on the operation policy of autonomous devices. To do so, we construct a Markov model, where we introduce a bidimensional battery value, including the apparent energy level, which is what available at the electrodes to power the device, and the actual energy level stored in the battery. When power is not drained by the device, these levels tend to <b>equalize</b> due to <b>charge</b> recovery, but, in the case of intense battery usage, they can be significantly different. We show that this non- ideality leads to considerably different estimates of undesirable events such as battery outages, and may cause a general underutilization of the devices if not properly accounted for...|$|R
50|$|Vented {{cell voltage}} rises rapidly {{at the end}} of charge {{allowing}} for very simple charger circuitry to be used. Typically a battery is constant current charged at 1 CA rate until all the cells have reached at least 1.55 V. Another charge cycle follows at 0.1 CA rate, again until all cells have reached 1.55 V. The charge is finished with an <b>equalizing</b> or top-up <b>charge,</b> typically for not less than 4 hours at 0.1 CA rate. The purpose of the over-charge is to expel as much (if not all) of the gases collected on the electrodes, hydrogen on the negative and oxygen on the positive, and some of these gases recombine to form water which in turn will raise the electrolyte level to its highest level after which it is safe to adjust the electrolyte levels. During the over-charge or top-up charge, the cell voltages will go beyond 1.6 V and then slowly start to drop. No cell should rise above 1.71 V (dry cell) or drop below 1.55 V (gas barrier broken).|$|R
40|$|All too often, {{stationary}} {{batteries are}} not correctly or adequately charged. This {{leads to a}} shortened battery life and may also cause a premature and sometimes catastrophic battery failure. It is the author’s experience that almost 50 percent of all stationary batteries are not being properly charged. This observation is based upon hundreds of site visits, multiple battery system tests, and the examination of numerous maintenance records. Battery charging is a complex process. Consideration has {{to be given to}} several fixed and varying parameters such as battery type and chemistry, battery application, and the environment in which the battery is being used. In many cases batteries are installed and put into service connected to chargers that have been factory preset and not readjusted to suit the particular batteries that they are charging. The intent {{of this paper is to}} educate battery users on battery charging and detail the proper methods of float (maintenance) <b>charging,</b> recharging, <b>equalize</b> (boost) <b>charging,</b> adjusting the charge for temperature and limiting the charge current when necessary. Since there are many types of stationary batteries in use today and each chemistry has its own unique and often complex charging requirement, for the purpose of this paper, the discussion is restricted to the lead-acid type which is by far the most commonly used stationary battery. The focus is on maintaining battery health and extending battery life and reliability. The suitability of certain types of battery chargers is also discussed. The basic building block of a battery is the cell. Cells that are connected in series to achieve a required voltage are called a battery string.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a low voltage-stress AC-linked <b>charge</b> <b>equalizing</b> system for balancing the energy in a serially connected, valve-regulated {{lead acid battery}} string using a modular converter that consists of multiple transformers coupled together. Each converter was coupled through an AC- linked bus to increase the overall energy transfer efficiency {{of the system and}} to eliminate the problem of the unbalanced charging of batteries. Previous solutions are based on centralized and modularized topologies. A centralized topology requires a redesign of the hardware and related components. It also faces a high voltage stress when the number of batteries is expanded. Modularized solutions use low-voltage-stress, double-stage, DC-linked topologies which leads to poor energy transfer efficiency. The proposed solution uses a low-voltage stress, AC-linked, modularized topology that makes adding more batteries easier. It also has a better energy transfer efficiency. To ensure that the charge equalization system operates smoothly and safely charges batteries, a small intelligent microcontroller was used in the control section. The efficiency of this charge equalization system is 85 %, which is 21 % better than other low-voltage-stress DC-linked charging techniques. The validity of this approach was confirmed by experimental results...|$|R
40|$|We {{consider}} {{the operation of}} an energy harvesting wireless device (sensor node) powered by a rechargeable battery, taking non-idealities into account. In particular, we consider sudden decrease and increase of the battery level (leakage and charge recovery consequently) due to the inner diffusion processes in the battery. These processes are affecting {{the stability of the}} device operation. In particular, leakage accelerates the depletion of the battery, which results in inactive periods of the device and, thus, potential data loss. In this paper, we propose a simplified self-control management of a battery expressed by restrictions, which could be used for an efficient operational strategy of the device. To achieve this, we rely on the double-queue model which includes the imperfections of the battery operation and bi-dimensional battery value. This includes both apparent, i. e., available at the electrodes and true energy levels of a battery. These levels can be significantly different because of deep discharge events and can <b>equalize</b> thanks to <b>charge</b> recovery effect. We performed some simulation and observed that we can diminish the models variable number to predict possible unwanted events such as apparent discharge events (when the areas near electrodes are depleted while other areas of the battery still contain some energy) and data losses. This observation helps to achieve sufficiently effective self-control management by knowing and managing just few parameters, and therefore offers valuable directions for the development of autonomic and self-sustainable operation...|$|R
