40|$|AbstractObjectiveAlthough utility-based {{algorithms}} {{have been}} developed for the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy (FACT), their properties are not well known compared with those of generic utility measures such as the EQ- 5 D. Our objective was to compare EQ- 5 D and FACT preference-based scores in cancer patients. MethodsA retrospective analysis was conducted on cross-sectional data collected from 472 cancer patients who completed both FACT-General and the EQ- 5 D. Preference-based scores were calculated by using published scoring functions for the EQ- 5 <b>D</b> (<b>Dolan</b> P. Modeling valuations for EuroQol health states. Med Care 1997; 35 : 1095 – 108; Shaw JW, Johnson JA, Coons SJ. US valuation of the EQ- 5 D health states: development and testing of the D 1 valuation model. Med Care 2005; 43 : 203 – 20) and FACT (Dobrez D, Cella D, Pickard AS, et al. Estimation of patient preference-based utility weights from the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-General. Value Health 2007; 10 : 266 – 72; Kind P, Macran S. Eliciting social preference weights for Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Lung health states. Pharmacoeconomics 2005; 23 : 1143 – 53; Cheung YB, Thumboo J, Gao F, et al. Mapping the English and Chinese versions of the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-General to the EQ- 5 D utility index. Value Health 2009; 12 : 371 – 6). Scores were compared on the basis of clinical severity by using Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status ratings by physicians and patients. Relative efficiency of each scoring function was examined by using ratios of F statistics. ResultsMean scores for the overall cohort were lowest when using Kind and Macran's FACT UK societal algorithm (0. 55, SD 0. 09) and highest when using Dobrez et al. 's FACT US patient algorithm (0. 83, SD 0. 08). Mean difference scores associated with clinical severity, when extrapolated to quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), had a range of 0. 18 QALYs gained using FACT (Kind and Macran) to 0. 45 QALYs gained using the EQ- 5 <b>D</b> (<b>Dolan).</b> However, relative efficiencies suggested that FACT (Kind and Macran) scores may provide greater statistical power to detect significant differences based on clinical severity. ConclusionsWe found important differences in utilities scores estimated by each algorithm, with FACT-based algorithms tending to underestimate the QALY benefit compared with algorithms based on the EQ- 5 D. These differences highlight some of the challenges in using disease-specific preference-based measures for decision making despite potentially more relevant disease-specific content...|$|E

40|$|Neisseria meningitidis (Nm), also {{referred}} to as meningococcus, is a human commensal colonising the oropharynx, transmittable by close contact between healthy people. The bacterium can act as an opportunistic pathogen and cause bacterial meningitis and septicaemia. Meningococci are classified into 12 serogroups based on the composition of their polysaccharide (Ps) capsule. Six of these serogroups, serogroups A, B, C, W, X and Y cause meningococcal disease worldwide. The populations most affected by the disease live within the meningitis belt, a sub-Saharan region stretching from Senegal to Ethiopia. Serogroup A Nm (NmA) has been responsible for most of the outbreaks and large epidemics in that region, but serogroups W and X have also caused outbreaks. Until 2010 Ps vaccines were used to halt ongoing epidemics in the meningitis belt, although they had limited effect in young children and did not provide long-term immunity. Conjugate vaccines, developed by coupling a protein to the Ps antigen to activate the T-helper cells of the immune system, elicit strong and long-lasting immune responses, also in children under 2 year, and mediate immunological memory. Until recently, however, conjugate vaccines were too expensive for African countries. An affordable tetanus toxoid-conjugated NmA vaccine, MenAfriVac, was therefore developed for use in the meningitis belt. Burkina Faso was the first country to vaccinate its population between 1 and 29 years of age in December 2010. In addition to protect vaccinated persons from disease, conjugate vaccines may prevent colonisation by the bacterium and, consequently, reduce the circulation of pathogens; indirectly protecting the non-vaccinated people. This herd immunity effect is a major advantage, multiplying the public health impact of a vaccination campaign. Safety and immunogenicity of MenAfriVac was demonstrated in clinical trials but the potential herd immunity effect of vaccination was unknown. The research summarized in this thesis was therefore initiated to determine whether MenAfriVac could provide herd immunity when used {{for the first time in}} mass vaccination in Burkina Faso. The specific aims of this work were to: 1) assess meningococcal carriage prevalence before and after mass vaccination with MenAfriVac to study the epidemiology of carriage and to evaluate the impact of vaccination on NmA carriage; 2) analyse the genetic and phenotypic characteristics of carriage isolates in comparison to those of invasive isolates from Burkina Faso; and 3) study the mucosal immune response to the vaccine. A multicentre repeated cross-sectional study of meningococcal carriage in the 1 - 29 -year-old population in Burkina Faso was successfully implemented before and after mass vaccination (Papers I, III and IV). Between January 2009 and November 2011, nine sampling campaigns were conducted simultaneously in three districts; the urban district of Bogodogo and two rural districts of Dandé and Kaya. During each sampling campaign > 5000 oropharyngeal swabs were obtained from a representative portion of the population within four weeks, yielding a total of 45, 847 samples. Samples were analysed by conventional laboratory methods in Burkina Faso and meningococci were confirmed and genetically characterized in Norway. A laboratory quality control system was implemented to harmonize operational procedures and to document the quality and reliability of the results (Paper II). Overall baseline meningococcal carriage was 3. 98 % while NmA prevalence was 0. 39 %. In 2011, after MenAfriVac mass vaccination, overall meningococcal carriage prevalence was 7. 02 %, while NmA carriage was completely eliminated (P The age distribution of meningococcal carriers in 2009, when NmY dominated, was different from the distribution in 2011, when NmX dominated. Thus, age distribution of meningococcal carriage depended on the epidemiological context and the dominant serogroup. Carriage was lowest in urban Bogodogo compared to the two rural districts. We observed a seasonal variation with higher carriage prevalence during the dry period of the year compared to the rainy season. A study of invasive isolates recovered from patients in the meningitis belt between 2004 and 2010, before the introduction of MenAfriVac (Paper VI) showed that meningococcal disease had predominantly been caused by NmA ST- 7 and ST- 2859, both clones belonging to the ST- 5 clonal complex. In Burkina Faso, the same genotype of NmA (ST- 2859;P 1. 20, 9;F 3 - 1) was found in healthy carriers and in patients throughout the study period, NmX ST- 181 emerged in 2010 before MenAfriVac introduction, NmY ST- 4375 was sporadically identified, while the virulent NmW ST- 11 clone was not circulating after 2004. Molecular characterization of carriage and disease isolates after vaccine introduction demonstrated that NmW ST- 11 had been re-introduced in Burkina Faso after MenAfriVac vaccination as it was first detected among carriers and patients in 2011 (Paper IV). We showed that higher NmX carriage and disease after vaccine introduction was not vaccine-induced, but due to a clonal wave that started before vaccine introduction. Capsule switch of the virulent ST- 2859 genotype as a result of immune evasion was not observed up to 13 months after vaccination. The epidemiology of carriage and molecular characteristics of the non-pathogenic, closely related species, Neisseria lactamica was also assessed before and after vaccine introduction (Paper V). N. lactamica carriage prevalence was homogeneous in the three study districts and stable over time, showing that the vaccine introduction did not affect carriage of N. lactamica. The epidemiology and molecular characteristics of N. lactamica were similar to those in industrialized countries; overall carriage prevalence was 18. 2 %, with a maximum in 2 -year-olds (40. 1 %), and, in the 18 - 29 -year-olds, carriage in women (9. 1 %) was higher than in men (3. 9 %). Saliva samples were obtained from 198 10 - 14 year old children in the capital city of Ouagadougou before and after vaccination. We found a significant increase of salivary IgA and IgG antibodies targeting the serogroup A capsule after vaccination (P As MenAfriVac was administered to children above 1 year of age in December 2010 and no catch-up or routine vaccination was performed after that, the number of unvaccinated children in Burkina Faso continuously increased. These children, however, were indirectly protected from disease at least up to 13 months after mass vaccination because NmA disappeared from circulation (Paper III). Thus, our results are consistent with a herd immunity effect generated by a successful MenAfriVac introduction. List of papers.
