50|$|Virchow {{developed}} {{an interest in}} anthropology in 1865, when he discovered pile dwellings in northern Germany. In 1869, he co-founded the German Anthropological Association. In 1870 he founded the Society for Anthropology, Ethnology and Prehistory (Gesellschaft für Anthropologie, Ethnologie und Urgeschichte) which was very influential in coordinating and intensifying German archaeological research. He edited its journal Zeitschrift für Ethnologie (Journal of Ethnology), which he founded in 1866, until his death, and was several times (at least fifteen times) its president. In 1870, he led a major excavation of the hill forts in Pomerania. He also <b>excavated</b> <b>wall</b> mounds in Wöllstein in 1875 with Robert Koch, whose paper he edited on the subject. For his contributions in German archaeology, the Rudolf Virchow lecture is held annually in his honour. He made field trips to Asia Minor, the Caucasus, Egypt, Nubia, and other places, sometimes {{in the company of}} Heinrich Schliemann. His 1879 journey to the site of Troy is described in Beiträge zur Landeskunde in Troas ("Contributions to the knowledge of the landscape in Troy", 1879) and Alttrojanische Gräber und Schädel ("Old Trojan graves and skulls", 1882).|$|E
30|$|Geotechnical {{engineers}} have long used the lumped {{factor of safety}} approach in design of retaining walls. In recent years, uncertainty inherent in soil properties has caught more attentions from researchers, thus reliability analyses are used widely. In short, combining the probabilistic and deterministic analysis is common practice nowadays and failure probability calculated by risk analysis {{is a kind of}} complement of safety factor. In this paper, reliability analysis of a deep excavation is presented using two probabilistic methods called Point Estimate Method (PEM) and Monte Carlo Simulation (MCS) method. Horizontal displacement of the <b>excavated</b> <b>wall,</b> as well as safety of factor, are adopted as a basis for assessing the performance stability of the system. The paper explains why probabilistic analysis with numerical methods is challenging, and how PEM and MCS can be used to calculate the statistical moments of output variables and to estimate probability of failure. The results are presented and compared in terms of statistical moments, probability of occurrence and most likely values at every stage of construction.|$|E

5|$|Eddisbury was {{excavated}} between 1935 and 1938 by W. J. Varley, {{who also}} undertook excavations at Maiden Castle nearby, {{as part of}} his investigation into the origin of Cheshire's hill forts. The structure was made a Scheduled Ancient Monument in 1995, giving Eddisbury protection against unauthorised change. The eastern entrance was re-excavated by the Habitats and Hillforts Project in 2010, finds including sling stones and a saddle quern. The <b>excavated</b> <b>walls</b> were partially reconstructed and remain visible.|$|R
30|$|The {{distance}} between rigid <b>wall</b> and <b>excavated</b> earth <b>wall,</b> the wall friction of rigid wall, and the deformation of retained earth wall were chosen as experimental variables.|$|R
50|$|The castle {{was partly}} {{excavated}} in 1931 but the conservation project {{ran out of}} money and some of the <b>excavated</b> <b>walls</b> collapsed. During World War II the Swiss Army took over Sogn Parcazi and built two bunkers on the hill. After the war, the army remained responsible for the ruins and in 1964 they were re-excavated, repaired and reinforced. The ruins were turned over to the municipality in 2004 and from 2006 until 2010 they were again repaired and an archeological excavation revealed much of the castle's history.|$|R

2500|$|Narcissi {{have been}} used decoratively for a long time, a wreath of white-flowered N. tazetta having been found in an ancient Egyptian grave, and in frescoes on the <b>excavated</b> <b>walls</b> of Pompeii.

They make a frequent appearance in classical literature.|$|R
50|$|Waterproofing an {{existing}} basement begins with excavating {{to the bottom}} sides of the footings. Once <b>excavated,</b> the <b>walls</b> are then power washed and allowed to dry.

5000|$|Halin or Halingyi ( [...] ), {{located in}} the Mu valley, {{one of the largest}} {{irrigated}} regions of precolonial Burma, is the northernmost Pyu city so far discovered. The earliest artefacts of Halin—city's wooden gates—are radiocarbon dated to 70 CE. The city was rectangular but with curved corners, and brick-walled. <b>Excavated</b> <b>walls</b> are approximately 3.2 km long on the north-south axis and 1.6 km on the east-west. At 664 hectares, the city was nearly twice the size of Beikthano. It has four main gates at the cardinal points, and a total of 12 gates, based on the zodiac. A river or canal ran through the city. Traces of a moat exist on all sides except the south, where it was probably not needed, as land was dammed there to create reservoirs.|$|R

However, a reconsideration of the archaeological and textual evidence suggests that not the „Binnenwall,“ but the „Niederwall“ was constructed {{at the same time as}} the „Außenwall. “ This implies that Shalmaneser III’s inscriptions actually never mentioned the „Binnenwall“ which was probably not built until the end or even sometime after of his reign...|$|R
50|$|The {{inhabitants}} fortified their {{settlement with}} a 4.5m D-shaped bastion {{in order to}} bar access to the village. The wall was built facing inland, suggesting that {{the people living in}} the village were more concerned with attacks from the land than from the sea. After the area was <b>excavated,</b> the <b>wall</b> was not reburied and it still standing. It {{is believed to be the}} oldest surviving fortification in Malta, and it is the best preserved among the six sites in Malta identified as having been fortified settlements in the Bronze Age.|$|R

5000|$|Wainwright was {{involved}} in his first excavation as a university student: this was a Mesolithic settlement at Freshwater West, Pembrokeshire, Wales. In 1965, he excavated an entire iron age settlement in Tollard Royal, Wiltshire: unusually for the time, and with [...] "consternation from traditional archaeologists", he used a JCB digger to clear the topsoil. He used the same technique at more Iron Age sites and also at some late Neolithic henges. In 1966, he <b>excavated</b> Durrington <b>Walls,</b> and he found two timber circles. In 1972, he excavated the Iron Age settlement at Gussage All Saints, Dorset.|$|R
50|$|In 1934 {{the fort}} was partly <b>excavated</b> and the <b>walls,</b> {{apart from the}} missing {{north-east}} wall were uncovered. The north-east and south-west double gates, and the tower at the southern corner were also uncovered. It was also established that the fort was defended by a single ditch.

40|$|A small {{excavation}} {{was carried}} out in September 2000 {{on the south side of}} the late Anglo-Saxon chapel to investigate the possibility of the former existence of a chamber or crypt below the demolished south porticus. Clearance of 19 th-century rubble revealed ashlar facing on the south, and a little of the east wall, establishing that the sub-floor space had existed. The archive consists of drawings and photographs of the <b>excavated</b> south <b>wall</b> elevations, which are now again invisible as the ground has been restored to its pre-excavation level.

The circular and octagonal drums of the dome were also reconstructed, and a metal finial was placed atop the dome.|$|R
