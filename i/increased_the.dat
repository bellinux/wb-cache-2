5|$|As {{the number}} of osteopathic schools has <b>increased,</b> <b>the</b> debate over {{distinctiveness}} has often seen {{the leadership of the}} American Osteopathic Association at odds with the community of osteopathic physicians.|$|E
5|$|Completion of High Speed1 has <b>increased</b> <b>the</b> {{potential}} {{number of}} trains serving London. Separation of Eurostar from British domestic services through Kent meant that timetabling {{was no longer}} affected by peak-hour restrictions.|$|E
50|$|Altering the % {{inspiratory time}} (T%i) changes the {{proportion}} of the time in which the vibration or sound wave is above the baseline versus below it. <b>Increasing</b> <b>the</b> % Inspiratory Time will also <b>increase</b> <b>the</b> volume of gas moved or tidal volume. Decreasing <b>the</b> frequency, <b>increasing</b> <b>the</b> amplitude, and <b>increasing</b> <b>the</b> % inspiratory time will all increase tidal volume and eliminate CO2. <b>Increasing</b> <b>the</b> tidal volume will also tend to <b>increase</b> <b>the</b> mean airway pressure.|$|R
2500|$|According to the {{equation}} listed above, <b>increasing</b> <b>the</b> trail and/or decreasing the head angle will <b>increase</b> <b>the</b> wheel flop factor {{on a bicycle}} or motorcycle, which will <b>increase</b> <b>the</b> torque required to bring the handlebars back to the straight ahead position and <b>increase</b> <b>the</b> vehicle's tendency to veer suddenly off the line of a curve. [...] Also, <b>increasing</b> <b>the</b> weight borne by the front wheel of the vehicle, either by <b>increasing</b> <b>the</b> mass of the vehicle, rider and cargo or by changing the weight ratio to shift the center of mass forward, will <b>increase</b> <b>the</b> severity of the wheel flop effect. [...] <b>Increasing</b> <b>the</b> rotational inertia of the front wheel by <b>increasing</b> <b>the</b> {{speed of the vehicle}} and the rotational speed of the wheel will tend to counter the wheel flop effect.|$|R
30|$|The created {{fracture}} {{length is}} directly related to <b>the</b> gel loading. <b>Increasing</b> <b>the</b> gel loading <b>increases</b> <b>the</b> apparent viscosity of the fracturing fluid (which in turn reduces leakoff) and also <b>increases</b> <b>the</b> net pressure (which in turn <b>increases</b> <b>the</b> fracture length).|$|R
5|$|Conversations {{with the}} {{previous}} game's protagonists <b>increased</b> <b>the</b> Cadet's standing with them: if the player tapped a special button on-screen during timed sections of the conversation, the bond statistic with the chosen character would be <b>increased.</b> <b>The</b> relationships built up by the player triggered special character interactions during the final chapter. Agito featured sub-missions, the game's version of side-quests, some of which changed depending on the real-world day of the week. They were given by NPCs, and could range from crafting new spells and equipment to performing certain actions within a combat mission. Completing quests yielded rewards such as new equipment and items.|$|E
5|$|During the Renaissance, {{money and}} art went hand in hand. Artists {{depended}} entirely on patrons while the patrons needed money to foster artistic talent. Wealth {{was brought to}} Italy in the 14th, 15th, and 16th centuries by expanding trade into Asia and Europe. Silver mining in Tyrol <b>increased</b> <b>the</b> flow of money. Luxuries from the Eastern world, brought home during the Crusades, <b>increased</b> <b>the</b> prosperity of Genoa and Venice.|$|E
5|$|Germanicus {{had managed}} to deal a {{significant}} blow to Rome's enemies, quell an uprising of troops, and returned lost standards to Rome, actions that <b>increased</b> <b>the</b> fame and legend of the already very popular Germanicus with the Roman people.|$|E
30|$|Fowler Flap As {{shown in}} Figure  3 (5) this flap {{mechanism}} has two deformation and two effects.

5|$|Gripen NG: {{improved}} version following on {{from the}} Gripen Demo technology demonstrator. Changes from the JAS 39C/D include the more powerful F414G engine, Raven ES-05 AESA radar, increased fuel capacity and payload, two additional hardpoints, and other improvements. These improvements have reportedly <b>increased</b> <b>the</b> Gripen NG costs to an estimated 24,000 Swiss Francs (US$27,000) per hour, and <b>increased</b> <b>the</b> flyaway cost to 100 million Swiss Francs (US$113M).|$|E

50|$|In {{the study}} of heat transfer, fins are {{surfaces}} that extend from an object to <b>increase</b> <b>the</b> rate of heat transfer to or from <b>the</b> environment by <b>increasing</b> convection. <b>The</b> amount of conduction, convection, or radiation of an object determines the amount of heat it transfers. <b>Increasing</b> <b>the</b> temperature gradient between the object and <b>the</b> environment, <b>increasing</b> <b>the</b> convection heat transfer coefficient, or <b>increasing</b> <b>the</b> surface area of <b>the</b> object <b>increases</b> <b>the</b> heat transfer. Sometimes it is not feasible or economical to change the first two options. Thus, adding a fin to an object, <b>increases</b> <b>the</b> surface area and can sometimes be an economical solution to heat transfer problems.|$|R
30|$|At lower gel loading (20  pptg), <b>increasing</b> <b>the</b> {{injection}} rate does not significantly increase fracture length. At higher gel loadings (40  pptg), <b>increasing</b> <b>the</b> {{injection rate}} significantly <b>increases</b> <b>the</b> fracture width.|$|R
50|$|Guaifenesin <b>increases</b> <b>the</b> {{analgesic}} {{effect of}} paracetamol (acetaminophen) and aspirin, <b>increases</b> <b>the</b> sedative effects of alcohol, tranquilisers, sleep-pills and total anesthetics.

5|$|McKinley won {{the entire}} Northeast and Midwest, and {{broke into the}} border states to win Delaware, Maryland, Kentucky, and West Virginia. He won North Dakota, and came close in South Dakota, Kansas, and in Bryan's Nebraska. McKinley was also {{successful}} in California and Oregon. McKinley won with 7.1 million votes to Bryan's 6.5 million, 51% to 47%. The electoral vote was not as close: 271 for McKinley to 176 for Bryan. McKinley <b>increased</b> <b>the</b> Republican vote by 2,000,000 from Harrison's defeat in 1892, though Bryan also <b>increased</b> <b>the</b> Democratic total.|$|E

This analysis shows that <b>increasing</b> <b>the</b> amount of prey refuge can <b>increase</b> <b>the</b> {{density of the}} predator due to the predator still has enough food for predation with m being small.|$|R
5000|$|Here, {{it can be}} {{seen that}} <b>increasing</b> <b>the</b> area (S) and lift {{coefficient}} (...) allow a similar amount of lift to be generated at a lower airspeed (V).Extending <b>the</b> flaps also <b>increases</b> <b>the</b> drag coefficient of the aircraft. Therefore, for any given weight and airspeed, flaps <b>increase</b> <b>the</b> drag force. Flaps <b>increase</b> <b>the</b> drag coefficient of an aircraft due to higher induced drag caused by the distorted spanwise lift distribution on the wing with flaps extended. Some flaps <b>increase</b> <b>the</b> wing area and, for any given speed, this also <b>increases</b> <b>the</b> parasitic drag component of total drag.|$|R
30|$|The {{degree of}} {{conversion}} calculation shows that by <b>increasing</b> <b>the</b> temperature, <b>the</b> DC <b>increases</b> {{which could be}} due to rapid formation of free radicals, <b>increasing</b> <b>the</b> number of effective monomer collisions and <b>increasing</b> <b>the</b> number of monomers with sufficient energy for reaction.|$|R
5|$|Strong, royalty-based {{nation states}} rose {{throughout}} Europe in the Late Middle Ages, particularly in England, France, and the Christian kingdoms of the Iberian Peninsula: Aragon, Castile, and Portugal. The long conflicts {{of the period}} strengthened royal control over their kingdoms and were extremely hard on the peasantry. Kings profited from warfare that extended royal legislation and <b>increased</b> <b>the</b> lands they directly controlled. Paying for the wars required that methods of taxation become more effective and efficient, {{and the rate of}} taxation often <b>increased.</b> <b>The</b> requirement to obtain the consent of taxpayers allowed representative bodies such as the English Parliament and the French Estates General to gain power and authority.|$|E
5|$|The B-70 {{was planned}} to use a high-speed, high-altitude bombing {{approach}} that followed a trend of bombers flying progressively faster and higher {{since the start of}} manned bomber use. Through that same period, only two weapons proved effective against bombers: fighter aircraft and anti-aircraft artillery (AAA). Flying higher and faster made it more difficult for both; higher speeds allowed the bomber to fly out of range of the weapons more quickly, while higher altitudes <b>increased</b> <b>the</b> time needed for fighters to climb to the bombers, and greatly <b>increased</b> <b>the</b> size of the AAA weapons needed to reach those altitudes.|$|E
5|$|The Dnestr-M {{included}} many improvements {{over the previous}} versions such as {{an increase in the}} pulse length from 200μs to 800μs which <b>increased</b> <b>the</b> range of objects identified, more semiconductors, and many other scanning and processing changes.|$|E
30|$|From {{the above}} expressions, {{we can see}} that <b>increasing</b> <b>the</b> scan Window Size or Integration size <b>increases</b> <b>the</b> scan time and thus reduces the Scan Rate. However, <b>increasing</b> <b>the</b> Step Size {{decreases}} the Scan Rate.|$|R
