Jeremy Hinzman was a U.S. Army deserter who claimed refugee status in Canada as a conscientious objector, one of many Iraq War resisters. Hinzman's lawyer, Jeffry House, had previously raised the issue of the legality of the Iraq War as having a bearing on their case. The Federal Court ruling was released on March 31, 2006, and denied the refugee status claim. In the decision, Justice Anne L. Mactavish addressed the issue of personal responsibility: “An individual must be involved at the policy-making level to be culpable for a crime against peace ... the ordinary foot soldier is not expected to make his or her own personal assessment as to the legality of a conflict. Similarly, such an individual cannot be held criminally responsible for fighting in support of an illegal war, assuming that his or her personal war-time conduct is otherwise proper.” ...|$|R

40|$|In the UK, water {{companies}} {{renew their}} aging water network using novel techniques and robust materials. The {{most common type}} of material used for network rehabilitation is Polyethylene (PE) pipe. A common method of jointing PE pipe is electrofusion welding. Here, electricity is used to heat a coil that melts the fitting and the host pipe of the same material. When the joint cools it forms a bond. However, premature failure of these can occur if best practice <b>installation</b> <b>principles</b> are not followed on site. A novel experimental rig, designed to be retrofitted to an existing servo-hydraulic fatigue testing machine, has been used to cyclically pressurise PE fittings that have been created with a controlled element of 'poor workmanship'. Extensive fatigue tests have shown the relationship between joint failure and the dynamic pressures experienced in water distribution systems. Furthermore, the effects of poor workmanship have shown to have a detrimental effect on asset integrity. A post-failure analysis of the fittings using non-destructive ultra-sonic methods has shown the failure paths of the fittings. Additionally, a bespoke ultra-sonic rig was designed and built to monitor the crack propagation of the fittings during live dynamic tests to confirm the mode of failure. © The Society for Experimental Mechanics, Inc. 2015...|$|R

The aim was to provide an analysis of the principles of environmental protection in statutory provisions, and of their application by the Czech courts (the Supreme Administrative Court in particular). However, also a brief comparative description of the Austrian approach to the discussed topic is given.
