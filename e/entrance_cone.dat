40|$|Long-scale {{preformed}} plasmas {{are generated}} inside the cone by the pre-pulse of the heating laser in the cone-guided fast ignition scheme {{and it is}} found that coupling efficiency from the heating laser to fast electrons especially suitable for core heating is drastically reduced by the preformed plasmas. To mitigate this serious problem, an extremely thin film is suggested to cover the <b>entrance</b> of the <b>cone.</b> This method, however, introduces long rarefied plasmas around the <b>entrance</b> of the <b>cone</b> and the main pulse must propagate through these plasmas. Therefore, fast electron characteristics produced by the main pulse could be affected, and effects of long rarefied plasmas on fast electron generation are investigated. It is found that the electron beam intensity becomes larger than that without the rarefied plasma, but the energy coupling rate from the heating laser to the core decreases due to lack of appropriate electrons for core heating. To achieve less than 10 % degradation of the core electron temperature, the thin film must be expanded by irradiation of the pre-pulse so that the length and the density of rarefied plasmas become less than 500 ?m and one-tenth of the critical density. A thickness of the thin film can be determined by these criteria and the intensity of the pre-pulse...|$|R

The {{behavior of the}} incident and reflected shock waves in a convergent channel is investigated {{in order to determine}} if such a geometrical device {{could be used as a}} means of producing high-enthalpy gas samples. A 10 [degree] half-angle conical convergence is mounted on the end of a pressure-driven, six-inch shock tube. Using argon at an initial pressure of 1. 5 torr, initial shock Mach numbers are varied from 6. 0 to 10. 2. During each run local shock velocities at several positions along the cone axis are measured using a small, multi-crystal, axial piezoelectric probe inserted from the cone vertex. The incident shock velocity profiles show that the shock behavior is dominated by multiple diffraction processes which originate at the <b>cone</b> <b>entrance.</b> Sudden increases in shock velocity at certain positions along the axis are observed, corresponding to the intersection of stemshocks formed by Mach reflection on the cone wall. These increases are separated by regions of deceleration and acceleration, corresponding to the growth and decline of a center shock formed by Mach reflection on the cone axis. Near the vertex the shock velocity has increased by as much as a factor of three, indicating that high temperatures and pressures are generated. By varying the initial Mach number and pressure, real gas effects are found to influence the diffraction process only in a region near the vertex. Reflected shock profiles show that the shock velocity is nearly constant for much of the convergence length, in contrast to the power-law decline predicted by the similarity solution. During this period the shock propagates into fluid originally set into steady, uniform motion outside the <b>cone</b> <b>entrance.</b> Small variations in the velocity result from weak interactions with localized nonuniformities and secondary waves. Beyond the <b>cone</b> <b>entrance</b> the shock decelerates towards the velocity corresponding to reflection from a plane end wall.

40|$|Fast {{ignition}} {{is a new}} {{scheme in}} laser fusion, in which higher energy gain with a smaller laser pulse energy is expected. A cone target has been introduced for realizing higher coupling efficiency. At ILE, Osaka University, a laser with four beams and a total output of 10 kJ ps− 1, laser for fast ignition experiment (LFEX), has been constructed and we have carried out an integrated experiment with one beam of the LFEX. Through experiments {{it was found that}} the coupling efficiency is degraded when the laser pre-pulse is not sufficiently small. Namely, the main pulse is absorbed in the long-scale pre-plasma produced by the pre-pulse and the hot electron energy is higher than that for a clean pulse. Furthermore, the distance between the hot electron source and the core plasma is large. Hence, we are exploring how to overcome the pre-pulse effects on the cone target. In this paper it is proposed that a thin foil covers the laser <b>entrance</b> of the <b>cone</b> to mitigate the pre-plasma and a double cone reduces the loss of high-energy electrons from the side wall of the cone. The simulations indicate that a higher coupling efficiency is expected for the double cone target with a thin foil at the laser entrance.

ABSTRACT OF PART II: The thermodynamic conditions behind the incident and reflected shock wave close to the vertex of a convergent channel are investigated spectroscopically. The investigation was initiated in order to better determine the possible uses of such a geometrical device as a tool for high temperature plasma research. Using argon at an initial pressure of 1. 5 torr, the shock Mach number prior to the <b>entrance</b> of the <b>cone</b> is 10. 2. Two windows are mounted at x/ 1 = 0. 9 in the cone, where the Mach number has increased to 24, and the emitted radiation is monitored for both time-resolved (Monochromator - Photomultiplier) and time-integrated (Spectrograph) analysis. The relative line intensity method is used to measure the electron temperature. The Stark broadened profile of the 6965. 4 [ [...] . ] neutral argon line, and continuum intensity measurements are used to determine the electron number density. From initial values of [ [...] . ] and [ [...] . ], both the electron temperature and number density profiles behind the incident shock are dominated by the previous shock diffraction processes. The general trend is a gradual increase, presumably due to the continuing compression of the gas shocked at successively earlier times. Superimposed upon this is the effect of hot slugs of gas from previous localized regions of very high Mach number. The reflected shock wave heats and compresses the gas even further. The subsequent expansion results in a series of rapid exponential decreases in temperature, density and pressure. Immediately after the reflected shock wave has passed, the gas appears to be in a nonequilibrium state with a population inversion among the upper excited atomic energy levels. There is an indication of the presence of a second reflected wave. The effects of self-absorption on Stark broadened lines is studied. An equation is derived, demonstrating the effect of individual corrections that are necessary before accurate interpretations of measured quantities can be made. Simple self-absorption correction schemes are demonstrated and shown to be self-consistent...|$|R
