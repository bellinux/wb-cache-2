40|$|The tooth {{surfaces}} of crossed helical gears are an <b>involute</b> <b>helicoid,</b> therefore they contact {{each other at}} a single point on the contact line. It is well-known that the tooth bearing is not good and sometimes causes tooth wear or failure. This paper explains how short, narrow, very biased the tooth bearing becomes, using the third-order surface analysis of the hypoid gears, and it clarifies that the contact patterns of the two involute helicoids become elliptical and the tooth bearing can be shown by an equiclearance line between the tooth surface...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. For large gear {{with the}} {{characteristic}} of large structure, quality and modulus, its profile precision is usually measured by in-site measurement. Based on large gear on-machine measuring described, <b>involute</b> <b>helicoid</b> and its characteristic are studied. The definition of medium {{rack in the}} framework of gear meshing transmission is put forward, the scheme of on-machine measurement based on rack-shaped-edge probe is formed, which can be divided into rolled angle (phase angle) and pressure angle (meshing angle) measurement according to the rotation of gear and prob. Measurement grid is determined by measuring straight generatrix deviation of gear profile, furthermore total tooth profile deviation and total helix deviation are separated...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Gears are {{industrial}} components with {{a precise}} geometry. Identification of their basic parameters {{plays an important}} role in their reverse design and quality control process. This article describes a new approach for the calculation of helical gear’s basic parameters using optical data acquired by 3 D digitizer. This approach is implemented by acquiring cloud-of-points data (COP-data) from the bearing seats and gear tooth surface. Cylinder surface fitting through COP-data acquired from bearing seats is performed for the determination of gear axis of rotation. In a final step, <b>involute</b> <b>helicoid</b> surface fitting through COP-data acquired from gear tooth surface determines the helical gear’s primary features. Particle swarm optimization algo-rithm as an efficient method is applied to perform the surface fitting process in this article...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Involute {{helical gears}} mesh {{based on the}} intersections of <b>involute</b> <b>helicoids.</b> However, spiral <b>involutes</b> on the tooth surface do not {{participate}} in meshing directly. A new type of gear drive, the spiral involute gear drive is proposed that works on contact of spiral involutes. The generation of tooth profile is introduced in detail. Through relative-stagnation method spiral involutes prove to have conjugation characteristics. To testify whether the transmission ratio of cylindrical spiral involute gears is constant, simulation is implemented in commercial codes ADAMS based on solid models of a pair of spiral involute gears. The computed results show that this novel gear drive can achieve a constant transmission ratio. Due to transmission with uniform velocity, cylindrical spiral involute gears can be used in transmission between intersecting axes, so that generating milling and generating grinding can be achieved...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. This paper {{analyzes}} {{the relationship between}} cutter parameters and gear profile parameters {{on the basis of}} rack cutter with asymmetric, and proves the new type gear can be manufactured by traditional methods. The meshing theory of involute helical gear with asymmetric is researched. Equation about <b>involute</b> profile <b>helicoids</b> is derived. The 3 D model of involute helical gear with asymmetric is built, and the model establishes the basis of FEA of tooth root bending strength and tooth surface contact strength. Notation: rρ——Radius of rack cutter h ad ——Addendum coefficient on driving side of rack cutter...|$|R
40|$|The {{teeth of}} {{ordinary}} {{spur and helical}} gears are generated by a (virtual) rack provided with planar generating surfaces. The resulting tooth surface shapes are a circle-involute cylinder {{in the case of}} spur gears, and a circle-involute helicoid for helical gears. Advantages associated with involute geometry are well known. Beveloid gears are often regarded as a generalization of involute cylindrical gears involving one additional degree-of-freedom, in that the midplane of their (virtual) generating rack is inclined with respect to the axis of the gear being generated. A peculiarity of their generation process is that the motion of the generating planar surface, seen from the fixed space, is a rectilinear translation (while the gear blank is rotated about a fixed axis); the component of such translation that is orthogonal to the generating plane is the one that ultimately dictates the shape of the generated, envelope surface. Starting from this basic fact, we set out to revisit this type of generation-by-envelope process and to profitably use it to explore peculiar design layouts, in particular for the case of motion transmission between skew axes (and intersecting axes as a special case). Analytical derivations demonstrate the possibility of <b>involute</b> <b>helicoid</b> profiles (beveloids) transmitting motion between skew axes through line contact and, perhaps more importantly, they lead to the derivation of designs featuring insensitivity of the transmission ratio to all misalignments within relatively large limits. The theoretical developments are confirmed by various numerical examples...|$|E
