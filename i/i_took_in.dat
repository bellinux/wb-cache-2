500|$|A visitor was {{so moved}} by George he felt {{compelled}} to express his gratitude for its display in the Dedham Community Theatre basement, writing [...] "Someone had slipped into the bathroom as <b>I</b> <b>took</b> <b>in</b> this painting and began peeing loudly into a toilet. The reverberating sound of urine splashing while viewing George brought the painting to life, and when the denouement of the flush sounded, I wept." [...] MOBA's accompanying caption introduces questions and observations: [...] "Can the swirling steam melt away the huge weight of George's corporate responsibilities? This pointillist piece is curious for meticulous attention to fine detail, such as the stitching {{around the edge of}} the towel, in contrast to the almost careless disregard for the subject's feet." ...|$|E
500|$|In the Gold Medal {{match in}} London, the team faced the Australia women's {{national}} wheelchair basketball team, who had defeated them 48–46 in Sydney {{just a few}} months before, in front of a capacity crowd of over 12,000 at the North Greenwich Arena. The German team had been undefeated up to that point, but had started off slow in its games against the United States and China, winning these games by six-point margins, and seemed to play its best basketball only in the final minutes of a game. Adermann scored 19 points, more than any other player in the match, and was a key factor in Germany winning 58-44. [...] "Most of my shots weren’t even any crazy shots or any outside shots,” Adermann said. [...] "They were the same shots <b>I</b> <b>took</b> <b>in</b> the others games, but I played more in this game, and I had many more easy opportunities getting into the paint." [...] "I’m always one of the shooters, but I think Australia underestimated me and didn’t defend me {{as well as some of}} the other girls. They left me open a lot and I got some big shots, so it went well for me. It just worked out that I scored the most points in the final, but it wasn’t deliberate." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{author of}} the Life of St Cuthbert has not been identified. Heinrich Hahn in 1883 put a case for Herefrith, the abbot of Lindisfarne {{mentioned}} as a source by Bede in his own Vita of the saint. Bertram Colgrave, the Anonymous Life's most recent editor, has roundly rejected Hahn's argument. While offering Baldhelm and Cynemund (two other sources of Bede) as better candidates, Colgrave did not endorse either and declared that [...] "it must always {{be a matter of}} conjecture". [...] From the text itself, and from the writings of Bede, it can be deduced that it was written by a monk of Lindisfarne. Bede, in his introduction to his Historia Ecclesiastica Gentis Anglorum, is almost certainly referring to this work when he wrote that What I have written concerning the most holy father and bishop Cuthbert, whether in this volume or in my little book concerning his acts, <b>I</b> <b>took</b> <b>in</b> part from what I have previously found written about him by the brethren of Lindisfarne. Throughout the Anonymous Life the author refers to Lindisfarne and its monastery with possessive pronouns. Though possibly written by many authors, the first person singular is used often enough to suggest only one major author.|$|E

2500|$|Despite {{having one}} three {{referendum}} victories {{on matters of}} [...] "political fusion", Titus was enraged by the method of reorganization put {{in place by the}} State Executive Committee, which instead of following the direction of the referendum [...] "that an organizer be sent to organize a Local of such members as believe in the uncompromising and independent political action of the Socialist Party", instead elected to issue a call for new applications for a charter from both cities. The Local Quorum [...] of the State Committee had [...] "not obeyed the will of the party expressed in its highest form by a deliberate Referendum", Titus declared. This criticism caused a quick reversal by the Local Quorum, which caused left wing State Secretary U.G. Moore to state in The Socialist on June 2: [...] "I want to apologize to the comrades of the state for any part <b>I</b> <b>took</b> <b>in</b> such action." [...] The other two members of the Local Quorum, the moderates William McDevitt and Scott, held a session in State Secretary Moore's absence and appointed H.B. Jory, an opponent of the sanctions against Locals Spokane and Northport, as the special organizer in charge of reestablishing the two groups. This action fulfilled the directive of the party referenda {{while at the same time}} attempting to subvert its intent, Titus charged. Jory declined to perform the reorganization demanded of him, however, forcing the Local Quorum to make another selection for the reorganization, that being J.H.C. Scurlock of Dupont, Idaho.|$|E
2500|$|On December 26, 1947, Kramer and Riggs {{embarked}} on their long tour, beginning {{with an easy}} victory by Riggs in front of 15,000 people, who had {{made their way to}} Madison Square Garden in New York City in spite of a record snowstorm, that had brought the city to a standstill. On January 16, 1948, Riggs led 8 matches to 6. At the end of 26 matches, Riggs and Kramer had each won 13. By that point, however, Kramer had stepped up his second serve {{to take advantage of the}} fast indoor courts they played on and was now able to keep Riggs from advancing to the net. [...] Kramer had also begun the tour by playing a large part of each match from the baseline. Finally realizing that he could only beat Riggs from the net, he changed his style of game and began coming to the net on every point. [...] Riggs was unable to handle Kramer's overwhelming power game. [...] For the rest of the tour Kramer dominated Riggs mercilessly, winning 56 out of the last 63 matches. [...] The final score was 69 victories for Kramer versus 20 for Riggs, the last time an amateur champion has beaten the reigning professional king on their first tour. In many of the last matches, it was assumed by observers that Riggs frequently gave up after falling behind and let Kramer run out the victory. Riggs says in his autobiography that Kramer had made [...] "nearly a hundred thousand dollars ... on the American tour alone, while <b>I</b> <b>took</b> <b>in</b> nearly fifty thousand as my share." ...|$|E
