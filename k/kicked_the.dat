5|$|Both Cumberland and Western Suburbs {{had been}} winless {{to this point}} {{of the season and}} Cumberland had a score to settle with their rivals from Western Suburbs Rugby Union Club who were with Western Suburbs rugby league club. Cumberland led 4–2 at half time, having two penalty goals kicked by Harry Bloomfield in the first half, however Western Suburbs goalkicker Jim Abercrombie kicked a penalty goal to equalize, after which George Cribb scored between the post and Bloomfield <b>kicked</b> <b>the</b> goal to make it 9–4. Abercrombie scored another penalty goal to make it 9–6, after which Bloomfield intercepted a pass, <b>kicked</b> <b>the</b> ball and regathered it to score which he also {{converted}} to win the match 14–6. Cumberland won its only game in the premiership season and ever.|$|E
5|$|Tech kicker Chris Kinzer, who <b>kicked</b> <b>the</b> game-winning field goal, {{did not go}} on {{to play in the}} National Football League despite {{predictions}} that he might do so. He attended several NFL teams' tryouts, but a contract to play in the league never materialized. He sold insurance for several years, then reentered school and graduated from Virginia Tech in 1994 with a degree.|$|E

25|$|The ball can {{be kicked}} in any {{direction}} and is used as an attacking option or to gain territory. There are three types of <b>kicks</b> used; <b>the</b> punt, drop <b>kick</b> and place <b>kick.</b> To punt <b>the</b> ball <b>the</b> player must <b>kick</b> <b>the</b> ball before it touches the ground. A drop <b>kick</b> occurs if <b>the</b> ball first bounces on the ground before being kicked. With a place <b>kick</b> <b>the</b> ball must {{be placed on the}} ground (usually on a kicking tee or in sand) before being kicked. Slight variations that commonly occur are taps, when a player <b>kicks</b> <b>the</b> ball a very short distance and regathers it, and toe-throughs, when a player <b>kicks</b> <b>the</b> ball along the ground instead of diving on it or picking it up.|$|R

5|$|Barcelona <b>kicked</b> <b>the</b> match off, but Manchester United {{showed their}} intent from the outset, forcing goalkeeper Víctor Valdés to concede a throw-in after just 10 seconds. Further {{pressure}} on the attack resulted in Yaya Touré fouling Anderson within Cristiano Ronaldo's shooting range. Ronaldo fired the free kick directly at Valdés, but the Spanish goalkeeper could only parry the ball and Gerard Piqué did well to divert Park Ji-sung's follow-up effort over the bar. The resulting corner was cleared, but {{only as far as}} Wayne Rooney, whose snap-shot was wayward and went out for a goal kick.|$|E
5|$|Each {{team found}} success {{on special teams}} as well. Cincinnati punter Kevin Huber, a first-team All-American, <b>kicked</b> <b>the</b> ball four times, {{averaging}} 45.8 yards per punt. A 56-yard punt {{in the first quarter}} marked the ninth consecutive game he had a kick of at least 50 yards. Virginia Tech placekicker Dustin Keys missed his first field goal attempt of the game but successfully converted his next two kicks, giving him 23 field goals and the Tech single-season record in that category.|$|E
5|$|Following the touchdown, Virginia Tech <b>kicked</b> <b>the</b> {{ball off}} to Florida State, {{and after a}} short return, the Seminoles' offense took the field at their 22-yard line. Florida State then {{embarked}} upon a 10-play, 78-yard drive {{that resulted in a}} touchdown with 5:40 remaining in the quarter. During the drive, Florida State converted two third downs and Manuel completed passes of 12 yards, 14 yards and 25 yards.|$|E

5|$|Manchester United <b>kicked</b> <b>the</b> game off, {{and also}} {{fashioned}} {{the first chance}} of the game; Ronaldo beat Lauren on the left wing to put over a cross, only for Scholes to head the ball over the crossbar after losing his marker. Two minutes later, a break from José Antonio Reyes had Carroll scampering across from his goal to meet the Spaniard, forcing Reyes wide enough to allow the United defence time to get back.|$|E
5|$|Navy {{received}} {{the ball from}} Washington and began to throw it erratically. After gaining several yards, Ira McKee threw an interception near midfield. On the next play, Fred Abel threw a long pass to George Wilson, who was tackled on the Navy 20-yard line after gaining 30yards. Washington brought out their placekicker, Leonard Ziel, to kick a 32-yard field goal, which would have won them the game. Ziel <b>kicked</b> <b>the</b> ball about a yard short of the right upright, giving the ball back to Navy with the game still tied. A few plays later the game ended in a 1414 tie.|$|E

They are used as clearing kicks, especially if a team is close to their own goal-line or is looking to gain territory. With these <b>kicks</b> <b>the</b> player tries to <b>kick</b> <b>the</b> ball as far as possible towards the opponents goal and they usually aim for one of the touch lines. If the ball crosses the touch line before being touched by anyone a lineout is awarded to the opposing team. If the ball is put inside the player's 22 metre line by a member of the opposition they can <b>kick</b> <b>the</b> ball out on the full and gain ground. Otherwise ground is only gained if the ball bounces in the field of play before crossing the touch line. Care has to be taken not to kick it too far, because if it travels through their opponents in-goal and becomes dead the opposition is awarded a scrum from where <b>the</b> <b>kick</b> occurred. <b>The</b> disadvantage of [...] "kicking for territory" [...] is that it almost always gives possession of the ball to the opposing team. If a clearing kick is caught by the opposition, then they can counter-attack by running, passing, or <b>kicking</b> <b>the</b> ball back toward the clearing team.|$|R

Jack Blott <b>kicked</b> <b>the</b> extra point, and Michigan led, 26–0. In the fourth quarter, Kipke kicked a field goal from the 45-yard line. Michigan's final touchdown was scored by Frederick Parker, substituting for Uteritz at quarterback, on a fourth down run from inside the one-yard line, and Kipke drop kicked for the extra point.|$|E

Buffalo punter Peter Fardon <b>kicked</b> <b>the</b> ball {{over the head of}} UConn {{returner}} Jasper Howard; rather than let the ball go, he ran backwards chasing after it. Trying to grab the ball over his shoulder, he muffed the catch, and the ball bounced into the end zone, where it was recovered by Buffalo's Ray Anthony Long for a Bull touchdown. The special-teams miscue by Howard allowed Buffalo to tie the game at 10–10 with 11:36 remaining in the second quarter.|$|E

5|$|After {{playing their}} {{previous}} game at Birmingham's Lakeview Park, {{the city of}} Montgomery gave Alabama and the Agricultural & Mechanical College of Alabama (now known as Auburn University) $500 to play each other at Riverside Park. In the second edition of what has since {{become known as the}} Iron Bowl, Auburn won 40–16. Auburn scored first when Rufus Dorsey scored on a 10-yard touchdown run and <b>kicked</b> <b>the</b> extra point for a 6–0 lead. Alabama responded on their next possession when John Burgett scored on a 35-yard touchdown run. However G. H. Kyser missed the extra point and Auburn still held a 6–4 lead. Auburn then extended their lead to 18–4 at halftime after a pair of touchdown from J. C. Dunham.|$|E
5|$|At San Diego, Manning {{threw for}} 255 yards, two touchdowns, and one {{interception}} in a 23–20 victory. The interception snapped a career-best streak of 140 pass attempts without an interception. After the Chargers rallied from a 10-point {{deficit in the}} fourth quarter to tie the game, Manning led the game-winning drive by completing a 14-yard pass to Marvin Harrison on 4th and inches at midfield. Adam Vinateri <b>kicked</b> <b>the</b> winning 51-yard field goal three plays later. It was Manning's 5th game-winning drive this season. Manning passed for a season-low 125 yards at Cleveland, but the Colts won their 5th straight game, by a final of 10–6.|$|E
5|$|Because Florida State had {{received}} the game's opening kickoff, Virginia Tech received the ball to begin the second half. As in the first half, however, the Virginia Tech offense failed to advance the ball in any meaningful fashion. Marcus Vick threw two incompletions and running back Cedric Humes managed a short three-yard dash. Forced to punt the ball away yet again, Virginia Tech set up the game's critical play. From his 34-yard line, punter Nic Schmitt <b>kicked</b> <b>the</b> ball 49yards to the Seminoles' Willie Reid, who broke through the Virginia Tech special teams punt coverage for an 89-yard punt-return touchdown. Reid's return was the first touchdown {{of the game and}} the first touchdown in ACC Championship Game history. With 13:46 remaining in the third quarter, Florida State had taken a 103 lead.|$|E

5|$|In a {{situation}} with more time, Virginia Tech would have <b>kicked</b> <b>the</b> ball off to Florida State and {{hoped for a}} defensive stop to give the offense {{a chance for a}} game-winning drive. With less than twominutes remaining, however, and with Virginia Tech having used all its timeouts, the only chance for the Hokies was to attempt a difficult onside kick. A successful recovery would give the Hokies another chance on offense. Kicker Brandon Pace teed up the ball, and kicked it forwards, bouncing the ball high into the air to create a jump ball situation. Virginia Tech's Xavier Adibi recovered the ball, but because the kick had only traveled nineyards before the recovery, the ball was awarded to Florida State. NCAA rules state that an onside kick must travel at least 10yards before the kicking team can legally touch the ball, and Pace's kick had not traveled the requisite distance.|$|E
5|$|It {{took the}} Flyers eight weeks {{in order to}} have a game played; they {{accepted}} the Gas City Tigers' challenge to play in Gas City, Indiana, on November 18. The Tigers were 9–0 and outscored their opponents 443–9 this season. Halfback Mickey Hole scored a 45-yard rushing touchdown three minutes into the game. On the next possession, the Flyers scored again; Kenneth Huffine scored the touchdown, and Cooney Checkaye <b>kicked</b> <b>the</b> point after, which made the score 13–0. Near the beginning of the second quarter, Checkaye scored, but the extra point was missed. The Tigers scored their only touchdown in the game in the third quarter.

5|$|Jud Dunlevy <b>kicked</b> <b>the</b> ball, which {{traveled}} the regulation 10yards, but was recovered by Kansas. The Hokies, despite failing {{to recover the}} onside kick, still had a chance for another offensive possession if they stopped Kansas' offense short of a first down. Because the Hokies had two timeouts remaining, they could stop the clock after two Kansas plays, thus preserving time for a Virginia Tech offensive drive. An 11-yard pass by Todd Reesing netted Kansas a first down, however, and subsequent runs by the Jayhawks allowed Kansas to run out the clock despite the Virginia Tech timeouts. Kansas preserved its lead by kneeling on the ball inside the Virginia Tech 5-yard line on the final plays of the game, and the 2421 victory was celebrated as time ran out.|$|E
