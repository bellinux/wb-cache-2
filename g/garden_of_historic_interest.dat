2500|$|The 18th-century walled garden (whose flint walls survive {{from that}} era) {{is between the}} manor house and St Peter's Church. [...] A hedge-flanked wooden bridge leads to it. [...] The layout follows the sloping {{contours}} of the land, and consists of four linked gardens: the walled section, a formal lawn at a lower level, a sensory garden for blind people and an area with lily ponds. [...] An unusual feature is a pet cemetery, {{believed to be the}} only one in Sussex. [...] Four cats and 16 dogs are buried in the plot in the southwest corner of the garden. [...] English Heritage has designated the manor's grounds in their entirety as a <b>Garden</b> <b>of</b> <b>Historic</b> <b>Interest.</b>|$|E
