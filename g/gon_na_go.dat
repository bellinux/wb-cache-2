40|$|Sodium atoms {{have been}} {{deposited}} on various pyrimidine powders under high vacuum at 77 degrees K and the {{electron spin resonance}} spectra of the resulting free radicals have been observed. Generally, the spectra show that the electron of the <b>Na</b> <b>goes</b> into a molecular orbital of the pyrimidine ring and the Na+ ions become attached to a carbonyl oxygen of the resulting pyrimidine anion. In 5 -fluorouracil and 5 -chlorouracil, however, the halogen is evidently abstracted by the Na to form NaF or NaC 1 and the neutral uracil radical. Thymine shows evidence for H-addition radicals {{as well as the}} Na+-[thymine]-complex. The H source for the addition radicals may be an H- 2 - 0 impurity in the sample, with which the Na atoms combine to release the H atoms. In addition to a resonance with g equals 2. 00 from the pyrimidine anion radical, broad resonances with g greater than 2 were observed for 5 -bromouracil, 5 -chlorouracil and 5 -iodouracil, as well as for alloxan and cytosine. These resonances, generally unstable at room temperature, are believed to arise from electrons trapped in interstitial sties or vacancies in the lattice...|$|R

Produced by Salaam Remi and Nas, it samples James Brown's [...] "The Boss", the percussion from James Brown's [...] "Funky Drummer" [...] and [...] "Rock Creek Park" [...] by The Blackbyrds. Its lyrics detail 3 loosely described criminal stories from different locations. The first story takes place in New York City, New York, where an alleged criminal steals the gun of a court officer, and starts shooting. The 2nd story deals with cocaine dealers from Tennessee who provide Nas with a laced blunt. The final story takes place in Los Angeles where <b>Nas</b> <b>goes</b> to a violent funeral in Crenshaw with his cousin, and later kills 3 people. The stories are linked together by a speech from Salaam Remi that implies that black people will never [...] "get up" [...] if they [...] "get down" [...] in crime.

Chiang Mai defeated the Siam-backed rebellion in Chiang Rai in 1602 only to submit to Ayutthaya later that year. Chiang Mai retook Nan from Lan Xang in 1603. In the western mainland, Siam invaded Lower Burma in 1600, {{and went on to}} attack Toungoo only to be driven back by Toungoo’s ally Arakan. The Portuguese garrison at Syriam switched allegiance from Arakan to Goa in 1603. Siamese vassal Martaban then entered into an alliance with Portuguese Syriam. Ava had seized cis-Salween Shan states by 1604. Siam planned to invade Ava’s vassal southern Shan states in 1605 before cancelling it because of the sudden death of its warrior king Naresuan (r. 1590–1605). Ava conquered Prome (1608), Toungoo (1610), Portuguese Syriam (1613), Siamese Martaban and Tavoy (1613), and Lan Na (1614).|$|R
