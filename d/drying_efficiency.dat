For example, instant drink mixes are spray dries of the various chemicals which make up the beverage. The technique was once used to remove water from food products; for instance, in the preparation of dehydrated milk. Because the milk was not being encapsulated and because spray drying causes thermal degradation, milk dehydration and similar processes have been replaced by other dehydration techniques. Skim milk powders are still widely produced using spray drying technology around the world, typically at high solids concentration for maximum <b>drying</b> <b>efficiency.</b> Thermal degradation of products can be overcome by using lower operating temperatures and larger chamber sizes for increased residence times.|$|E

Drying {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} process in producing a good quality of rosella tea. The study was aimed to evaluate the <b>drying</b> <b>efficiency</b> of rosella tea by using a cabinet dryer. The source of energy for the dryer was from the burning of charcoal.

40|$|Summary Bovine hydrolyzed {{collagen}} (BHC) is {{an important}} food supplement normally consumed {{in the form of}} capsules or powder in order to stimulate the synthesis of collagen, promote health and assist in esthetics.

In this work, a process engineering approach was used aiming to maximize the <b>drying</b> <b>efficiency</b> and investigate the potential of using a spouted bed on the drying performance of BHC. The effects of feed mode, type of inert material and use of an adjuvant on powder production efficiency were analyzed using a 23 factorial experimental design. A statistical analysis showed significant effects of all the independent variables on drying performance. The maximum powder production efficiencies were achieved using polypropylene as the inert material and atomization as the feed mode.

The paper produced was made of kraft softwood pulp with basis weights of 60 - 120 g/m(2). The roll surface temperature ranged from ambient temperature to 350 degreesC and the press loads were between 400 - 800 kN/m. The paper was produced at machine speeds: of 300 - 800 m/min. Two different impulse <b>drying</b> <b>efficiencies</b> were defined, the total specific energy use (TSEU) and the impulse drying specific energy use (ISEU). The TSEU {{was defined as the}} electrical power input divided by the total water removal.

The TSEU was mainly dependent on the roll surface temperature, the ingoing moisture ratio of the paper web, the press load and the basis weight. In general, the impulse unit had higher energy efficiency than a modern dryer section.

The FPD cleaning system consists of two parts, one being a cleaning part which includes a two-phase flow nozzle, and the other being a drying part which includes an air-knife and a halogen lamp. To evaluate the particle removal efficiency by means of two-phase flow cleaning, silica particles 1. 5 µm in size were contaminated onto a six-inch silicon wafer and a four-inch glass wafer.
