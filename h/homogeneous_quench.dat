We present the first series of explicit computations of QNEC in a strongly coupled QFT, using holography.

For vacuum and the thermal phase QNEC is always weaker than NEC.

40|$|We {{develop a}} new method for {{computing}} the holographic retarded propagator in generic (non-) equilibrium states using the state/geometry map. We check that our method reproduces the thermal spectral function given by the Son-Starinets prescription. The time-dependence of the spectral function of a relevant scalar operator is studied {{in a class of}} non-equilibrium states. The latter are represented by AdS-Vaidya geometries with an arbitrary parameter characterising the timescale for the dual state to transit from an initial thermal equilibrium to another due to a <b>homogeneous</b> <b>quench.</b> For long quench duration, the spectral function indeed follows the thermal form at the instantaneous effective temperature adiabatically, although with a slight initial time delay and a bit premature thermalisation. At shorter quench durations, several new non-adiabatic features appear: (i) time-dependence of the spectral function is seen much before than that in the effective temperature (advanced time-dependence), (ii) a big transfer of spectral weight to frequencies greater than the initial temperature occurs at an intermediate time (kink formation) and (iii) new peaks with decreasing amplitudes but in greater numbers appear even after the effective temperature has stabilised (persistent oscillations). We find four broad routes to thermalisation for lower values of spatial momenta. At higher values of spatial momenta, kink formations and persistent oscillations are suppressed, and thermalisation time decreases. The general thermalisation pattern is globally top-down, but a closer look reveals complexities. Comment: 1 + 38 pages, 26 figures, captions improved; version to appear in JHE...|$|E

40|$|A {{rapid and}} {{effective}} preparative procedure has been evaluated for the accurate determination of low-energy (40 – 200 keV) gamma-emitting radionuclides (210 Pb, 234 Th, 226 Ra, 235 U) in uranium ores and uranium ore concentrates (UOCs) using high-resolution gamma ray spectrometry. The measurement of low-energy gamma photons is complicated in heterogeneous samples containing high-density mineral phases {{and in such}} situations activity concentrations will be underestimated. This is because attenuation corrections, calculated based on sample mean density, do not properly correct where dense grains are dispersed within a less dense matrix (analogous to a nugget effect). The current method overcomes these problems using a lithium tetraborate fusion that readily dissolves all components including high-density, self-attenuating minerals/compounds. This is the ideal method for dissolving complex, non-volatile components in soils, rocks, mineral concentrates, and other materials where density reduction is required. Lithium borate fusion avoids the need for theoretical efficiency corrections or measurement of matrix matched calibration standards. The resulting <b>homogeneous</b> <b>quenched</b> glass produced can be quickly dissolved in nitric acid producing low-density solutions that can be counted by gamma spectrometry. The effectiveness of the technique is demonstrated using uranium-bearing Certified Reference Materials and provides accurate activity concentration determinations compared to the underestimated activity concentrations derived from direct measurements of a bulk sample. The procedure offers an effective solution for initial nuclear forensic studies where complex refractory minerals or matrices exist. It is also significantly faster, safer and simpler than alternative approaches...|$|R

These results are consistent with some existing theoretical expectations. Comment: 10 pages, 13 figure...|$|R
40|$|A {{heterogeneous}} catalyst containing MoO 42 - exchanged on layered double hydroxides (Mo-LDHs) is used {{to produce}} 1 O 2 from H 2 O 2, and with this dark 1 O 2, unsaturated hydrocarbons are oxidized in allylic peroxides. The oxidation kinetics {{are studied in detail}} and are compared with the kinetics of oxidation by 1 O 2, formed from H 2 O 2 by a homogeneous catalyst. A model is proposed for the heterogeneously catalyzed 1 O 2 generation and peroxide formation. The model divides the reaction suspension in two compartments: (1) the intralamellar and intragranular zones of the LDH catalyst; (2) the bulk solution. The 2 -compartment model correctly predicts the oxidant efficiency and peroxide yield for a series of olefin peroxidation reactions. 1 O 2 is generated at a high rate by the heterogeneous catalyst, but somewhat more 1 O 2 is lost by quenching with the heterogeneous catalyst than using the <b>homogeneous</b> catalyst. <b>Quenching</b> occurs mainly as a result of collision with the LDH hydroxyl surface, as is evidenced by using LDH supports containing strong 1 O 2 deactivators such as Ni 2 +.

40|$|Melt {{inclusions}} (MI) {{trapped in}} igneous phenocrysts provide {{one of the}} best tools available for characterizing magmatic processes. Some MI experience post-entrapment modifications, including crystallization of material on the walls, formation of a vapor bubble containing volatiles originally dissolved in the melt, or partial to complete crystallization of the melt. In these cases, laboratory heating may be necessary to return the MI to its original homogeneous melt state, followed by rapid quenching of the melt to produce a homogeneous glass phase, before microanalyses can be undertaken. Here we describe a series of heating experiments that have been performed on crystallized MI hosted in olivine, clinopyroxene and quartz phenocrysts, using the Linkam TS 1400 XY microscope heating stage. During the ex- periments, we have recorded the melting behaviors of the MI up to a maximum temperature of 1360 ◦C. In most of the experiments, the MI were homogenized completely (without crystals or bubbles) and remained <b>homogeneous</b> during <b>quenching</b> to room temperature. The resulting single phase MI contained a homogeneous glass phase. These tests demonstrate the applicability of the Linkam TS 1400 XY microscope heating stage to homogenize and quench MI to produce homogeneous glasses that can be analyzed with various techniques such as Electron Microprobe (EMP), Secondary Ion Mass Spectrometry (SIMS), Laser ablation Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry (LA ICP-MS), Raman spectroscopy, FTIR spectroscopy, etc. During heating experiments, the optical quality varied greatly between samples and was a function of not only the temperature of observation, but also on the amount of matrix glass attached to the phenocryst, the presence of other MI in the sample which are connected to the outside of the crystal, and the existence of mineral inclusions in the host...|$|R
40|$|In this thesis, {{we study}} the {{long-range}} behaviour of polymerized membranes using a nonperturbative renormalization group (NPRG) approach. We start by presenting the NPRG after which we introduce membranes systems. In our work, we concentrate on polymerized membranes of different types: <b>homogeneous,</b> anisotropic and <b>quench</b> disordered. Moreover {{as a side}} project, we work on Lifshitz critical behaviour (LCB) in magnetic systems. Our results, both for polymerized membranes and LCB, compare well with weak-coupling, low-temperature and large-d (or large-n for LCB) perturbative results in the limiting cases. But more importantly the need of a non-perturbative approach is justified {{by the fact that}} the physically interesting have been difficult to compute. A long-standing question in homogeneous membranes is the order of the transition between the crumpled and flat phases. Although we do not have a definite answer, our results seem to indicate that the transition is first order in agreement with recent Monte Carlo simulations. An interesting feature of homogeneous membranes is the existence of the flat phase at low-temperature with a non-trivial behaviour. This flat phase has shown to correctly describe the behaviour of graphene although the electronic degrees of freedom are not taken into account...|$|R
40|$|The {{suspensions}} of 4 -cyano- 4 -n-hexylbiphenyl (6 CB) anisometric microcrystal {{were obtained}} by <b>quenching</b> <b>homogeneous</b> 6 CB/ethanol mixtures with different 6 CB concentrations. Such suspensions were strongly suggested from the differential scanning calorimetry examinations and the image observations of the samples during the quench and heating processes. The crystallization process for the mixtures with higher 6 CB concentration looked like the isotropic-nematic phase transition of bulk liquid crystal. Dielectric measurement was carried out on the mixtures during the heating process after quench. Distinct dielectric relaxation was observed in the frequency range between kHz and 100 kHz, which exhibited obvious dependence on temperature and 6 CB concentration. Curve fitting on the complex conductivity spectra indicates that three Debye type relaxations exist in this narrow frequency range. Based on the dependences of relaxation parameters on temperature and 6 CB concentration, the possible relaxation mechanisms and the phase conformation of the mixtures were discussed. It was concluded that the relaxations, from high to low relaxation frequency, originate from the Maxwell-Wagner polarization, the rotation of 6 CB microcrystal around its long axis, and the reorientation of 6 CB microcrystal around its short axis, respectively. It was also confirmed that the quenched 6 CB/ethanol mixtures show isotropic-nematic phase transition {{with the increase of}} 6 CB concentration...|$|R
40|$|In the {{previous}} chapter, {{we discussed the}} dynamics of discrete spin systems. Our primary focus was on a prototypical system that is initially in a homogeneous high-temperature disordered phase and the temperature is quenched (suddenly lowered) to below the critical temperature. Because {{of the complexity of}} this domain coarsening process at the level of discrete spins (see Fig. 6. 7), considerable effort has been devoted to constructing a complementary approach that is based on a phenomenological description at the continuum level. There are many motivations for going to a continuum description. While we lose a direct connection to the individual degrees of freedom of the system in a continuum description, continuum theories are typically simpler than their discrete counterparts. This simplification is particularly important in coarsening phenomena because continuum theories are still quite formidable. When a <b>homogeneous</b> system is <b>quenched</b> to below the critical temperature, a coarsening mosaic of ordered-phase domains forms, as the distinct broken-symmetry phases compete with each other in their quest to select the low-temperature thermodynamic equilibrium state. As a result of this competition, equilibrium is never reached for an infinite system. Instead, self-similar behavior typically arises, where the domain mosaic looks the same at different times but only its overall length scale changes. This self-similarity is an important simplifying feature that is characteristic of coarsening...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe Highly Siderophile Elements (HSE) are {{powerful}} tracers of planetary differentiation. Despite {{the importance of}} their partitioning between silicate and metal for the understanding of planetary core formation, especially for the Earth and Mars, there is still a huge discrepancy between conclusions based on different high temperature (HT) experimental studies. These disagreements {{may be due to the}} presence of HSE micro and nanonuggets in HT experiments. The formation of these nuggets is still interpreted in different ways. One hypothesis is that these HSE nuggets formed during the quench of the silicate melt, while another hypothesis supposes that these nuggets formed before the quench and represented artefacts of HT experiments. The goal of this work is to clarify whether the presence of HSE nuggets in silicate melts is linked to a quench effect or not. Understanding the formation of these HSE nuggets represents thus a necessary step towards the resolution of the Earth's core formation scenarios. We performed new HT experiments (1275 – 2000 • C) at different oxygen fugacities (fO 2), between ambient air up to ∼ 5 log units below the Iron-Wüstite buffer [IW- 5], for two different silicate compositions (synthetic martian and terrestrial basalts) mixed with a metallic mixture of Pt–Au– Pd–Ru. Our 1275 – 1600 • C experiments were contained in either olivine, diopside or graphite crucible; experiments at 2000 • C were performed using a levitation method, so no capsule was necessary. Our samples contained quenched silicate melts, minerals (olivine, pyroxene, spinel depending on the run), a two-phase metallic bead and nano and micro-nuggets of HSE. Our samples underwent fine textural, structural and analytical characterizations. The distribution of the nuggets was not <b>homogeneous</b> throughout the <b>quenched</b> silicate melt. HSE nuggets were present within crystals. Dendritic textures from the quenched silicate melt formed around HSE nuggets, which could be crystallized, showing that the nuggets acted as nucleation sites during the quench. Thus they predated the quench. Finally, these nuggets also had strong heterogeneities suggesting at least a two-stage formation process under reducing conditions. Consequently, our observations clearly show that these HSE nuggets formed before the quench in the silicate melt. Our results agreed with previous studies, which concluded that HSE abundances in the Earth's mantle require the late accretion of chondritic material subsequent to core formation. However, the effects of metallic Si, O, H, or the effect of pressure on the HSE partitioning are still not fully understood. Further work to constrain these effects is to be encouraged to understand the Earth's core formation...|$|R
