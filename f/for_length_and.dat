25|$|In Rømer's {{position}} as royal mathematician, he introduced {{the first national}} system for weights and measures in Denmark on 1 May 1683. Initially based on the Rhine foot, a more accurate national standard was adopted in 1698. Later measurements of the standards fabricated <b>for</b> <b>length</b> <b>and</b> volume show an excellent degree of accuracy. His goal was to achieve a definition based on astronomical constants, using a pendulum. This would happen after his death, practicalities making it too inaccurate at the time. Notable is also his definition of the new Danish mile of 24,000 Danish feet (circa 7,532m).|$|E

25|$|The British Weights and Measures Act of 1824 {{repealed}} all existing British {{weights and}} measures legislation, some {{dating back to the}} 1300s, and redefined existing units of measure. In particular, a new standard yard and troy pound were manufactured as the standards <b>for</b> <b>length</b> <b>and</b> weight respectively. A new measure, the imperial gallon, which replaced the many gallons in use, was defined as being the volume of 10pounds of water at 62°F which, after the authorized experiments, was found to be 277.274 cubic inches. The bushel, which like the gallon, had definitions reflecting the various gallons, was defined as 8imperial gallons.|$|E
25|$|When {{previously}} fired {{cases are}} used, {{they must be}} inspected before loading. Cases that are dirty or tarnished are often polished in a tumbler to remove oxidation and allow easier inspection of the case. Cleaning in a tumbler will also clean the interior of cases, which is often considered important for handloading high-precision target rounds. Cracked necks, non-reloadable cases (steel, aluminum, or Berdan primed cases), and signs of head separation are all reasons to reject a case. Cases are measured <b>for</b> <b>length,</b> <b>and</b> any that are over the recommended length are trimmed down to the minimum length. Competition shooters will also sort cases by brand and weight to ensure consistency.|$|E

25|$|The plan as at early 1982 was for all 54 {{carriages}} (not yet 57) to be {{in service}} {{by the end of}} 1983, running services to Warrnambool, Horsham, Shepparton, Geelong and some Bendigo services. All other services were to be provided by the existing S, Z and airconditioned E carriages, plus interurban Comeng type trains running to Traralgon. All carriages were to be formed into semi-fixed 3 or 4-car sets, with schedules built around standard consists to keep runs fast and simple. Additionally, all sets were to include only one conductor/guard van, rather than one each end, to maximise capacity <b>for</b> <b>length</b> <b>and</b> weight of each train set. The roster at the time worked with fourteen interurban trains (plus four on the electrified eastern region), so that would allow enough N sets spare and in rostered maintenance.|$|E
500|$|In {{the early}} ninth century, when {{much of what}} later became France {{was part of the}} Holy Roman Empire, units of measure had been {{standardised}} by the Emperor Charlemagne. He had introduced standard units of measure <b>for</b> <b>length</b> <b>and</b> for mass throughout his empire. As the empire disintegrated into separate nations, including France, these standards diverged. It has been estimated that {{on the eve of the}} Revolution, a quarter of a million different units of measure were in use in France; in many cases the quantity associated with each unit of measure differed from town to town, and even from trade to trade. Although certain standards, such as the pied du roi (the King's foot) had a degree of pre-eminence and were used by scientists, many traders chose to use their own measuring devices, giving scope for fraud and hindering commerce and industry. These variations were promoted by local vested interests, but hindered trade and taxation. In contrast, in England the Magna Carta (1215) had stipulated that [...] "there shall be one unit of measure throughout the realm".|$|E
500|$|The chase {{scene at}} the end of the game, in which Don pursues Adrienne {{throughout}} the entire mansion, took a full week to film. Homb wore a prosthesis on his face to simulate wounds from Adrienne pouring acid on him. Only one prosthesis was available, and it was in such bad shape by the end of filming that Williams said [...] "we were essentially holding it in place with the proverbial wire and bailing wax". Several scenes in Phantasmagoria involved animals, including a Doberman Pinscher, two cats, a beagle and several rats. Sierra commissioned Dave Macmillian and other Hollywood animal handlers from the company Worldwide Movie Animals to handle the animals. Two cats were required to portray Adrienne's pet Spaz because the cats were temperamental and each would have moments when they would not perform. Some objects were borrowed by a museum operated by the Fresno Flats Historical Society and used as props in the game. The society was thanked in the credits as a result. Ultimately, all of the scenes filmed for Phantasmagoria were used in the final game. Some were edited <b>for</b> <b>length</b> <b>and</b> pacing, but none were cut altogether.|$|E

500|$|When the New SI {{was first}} designed, {{there were more}} than six {{suitable}} physical constants from which the designers could choose. For example, once length and time had been established, the universal gravitational constant G could, from a dimensional point of view, be used to define mass.M−1T−2, so once standards have been established <b>for</b> <b>length</b> <b>and</b> for time, mass can in theory be deduced from G. Also, when fundamental constants as relations between these three units are set, the units can be deduced by a combination of these constants, for example as a linear combination of Planck units. [...] It should be noted that in practice G can only be measured with a relative uncertainty of the order of 10−5 which would have resulted in upper limit of the kilogram's reproducibility being around 10−5 whereas the current international prototype kilogram can be measured with a reproducibility of 1.2×10−8. The choice of physical constants was {{made on the basis of}} minimal uncertainty associated with measuring the constant and the degree of independence of the constant in respect of other constants that were being used. Although the BIPM has developed a standard mise en pratique (practical technique) for each type of measurement, the mise en pratique used to make the measurement is not part of the measurement's definition—it is merely an assurance that the measurement can be done without exceeding the specified maximum uncertainty.|$|E
2500|$|A set of base {{units for}} a system of {{measurement}} is a conventionally chosen set of units, none {{of which can be}} expressed as a combination of the others, and in terms of which all the remaining units if the system can be expressed. For example, units <b>for</b> <b>length</b> <b>and</b> time are normally chosen as base units. [...] Units for volume, however, can be factored into the base units of length (m3), thus they are considered derived or compound units.|$|E

Unlike the previous standard, the new pound standard, made of platinum, was a pound avoirdupois. The new yard, slightly longer than a yard to prevent wear as was experienced with the mètre des Archives, was made of brass and had two gold plugs close to its end.

60|$|I {{have given}} this {{synopsis}} of a communication {{to show the}} kind of thing we got--though this was a very favourable specimen, both <b>for</b> <b>length</b> <b>and</b> for coherence.

On the other hand, what proof was there that these statements were true? I could see no such proof, and they simply left me bewildered. Now, with a larger experience, in which I find that the same sort of information has come to very, many people independently in many lands, I think that the agreement of the witnesses does, as in all cases of evidence, constitute some argument for their truth. At the time I could not fit such a conception of the future world into my own scheme of philosophy, and I merely noted it and passed on.|$|E

As yet thou art within the reach thereof; do not thou go about to measure arms with God, as some good men are apt to do: I mean, do not thou conclude, that because thou canst not reach God by thy short stump, therefore he cannot reach thee with his long arm. Look again, [...] "Hast thou an arm like God" [...] (Job 40:9), an arm like his <b>for</b> <b>length</b> <b>and</b> strength? It becomes thee, when thou canst not perceive that God is within the reach of thy arm, then to believe that thou art within the reach of his; for it is long, and none knows how long.|$|E
