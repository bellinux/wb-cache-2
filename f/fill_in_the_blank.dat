25|$|Established in 1870, the Golden Gate Park Nursery has {{remained}} {{one of the}} few places in the park restricted to the public. This nursery began with donated plants from around the world and expanded over the years with the care of past Golden Gate Park gardeners. The nursery has moved around the park thrice; first to where McLaren Lodge stands today, then to where Kezar Stadium is currently located and finally to its current location of Martin Luther King Jr. Drive. This Nursery houses over 800 species of plants, some of which are exclusive to the nursery, and are sold to the public on the third Saturday of the month. Every week over 3,000 plants are dispersed within the city and park. When the park requires repairing or is in need of empty beds filled, the Nursery provides its wide variety of plants to <b>fill</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>blank</b> spaces. Indoors, the plants are set up in neat rows and beds, showing off the nursery’s green diversity for the buyers picking. The Golden Gate Park Nursery is one of the city’s main green providers and is greatly responsible for the city’s plant life.|$|E
