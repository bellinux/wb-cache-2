5|$|Werner Kaegi (born June 17, 1926) is a Swiss <b>electronic</b> music composer, musicologist and educator. During the 1960s, he {{promoted}} <b>electronic</b> {{music in}} his home country. In the 1970s, as a composer and researcher at Utrecht's Institute of Sonology, The Netherlands, he developed pioneering programs {{in the field of}} computer-generated music.|$|E
5|$|From 1963 to 1970, Kaegi {{worked at}} the Centre de Recherches Sonores, the electroacoustic music studio of Radio Suisse Romande in Geneva. There he started {{composing}} <b>electronic</b> and tape music, including pieces such as Éclipses (1964), L'Art de la Table (1964), and Entretiens (1965). At the C.R.S., Kaegi created several radiophonic works; such as La Porte Noire in 1964 and Zéa in 1965. In the late 1960s, Kaegi wrote several essays on <b>electronic</b> music, including the influential book Was ist elektronische Musik?, ("What Is <b>Electronic</b> Music?"), {{which was published in}} 1967 in Zurich, Switzerland, and also became a film for Swiss television.|$|E

5|$|The tickets {{along the}} Northeast Extension of the Pennsylvania Turnpike were {{originally}} handed out by person. In 1987, machines started to replace humans in distributing tickets. In 1990, an <b>electronic</b> toll collection system was {{proposed for the}} Pennsylvania Turnpike, where a motorist would create an account and use an <b>electronic</b> device that would be read from an <b>electronic</b> tollbooth. The motorist would be billed later. The multi-state <b>electronic</b> tolling system, {{which was to be}} called E-ZPass, was planned to be implemented by 1998. The planned installation date was later pushed back to 2000. On December2, 2000, E-ZPass debuted along the Northeast Extension of the Pennsylvania Turnpike between Mid-County and Lehigh Valley. On December15, 2001, E-ZPass was extended to include {{the entire length of the}} Northeast Extension of the Pennsylvania Turnpike. Commercial vehicles were allowed to start using E-ZPass on December14, 2002.|$|E
5|$|This {{period of}} <b>electronic</b> music championing culminated in 1971 with the {{publication}} of Kaegi's unique record release, a 7-inch record titled Von Sinuston zur elektronischen Musik ("From Sine Wave to <b>Electronic</b> Music"). In the 12 pages accompanying booklet, Kaegi analyses the basic constituents of <b>electronic</b> music like sine wave, sound synthesis, ring modulation or <b>electronic</b> oscillator, with sound examples provided on the disc as well as excerpts from his most recent works of the time, Kyoto, 1970, Thai Clarinet, 1970, Hydrophonie I, 1969 and Illumination Expo'70 Osaka, 1969. The latter piece was commissioned by the Swiss government to be used as background music for the Swiss pavilion at the World Expo '70 in Osaka, Japan, a project he undertook with composer and contemporary music promoter André Zumbach (born 1931), then head of music at Radio Suisse Romande.|$|E
