5|$|Woody {{returns to}} Sunnyside and learns from a Chatter Telephone toy {{that there is}} only one way out of the daycare: the trash. Woody and Andy's other toys execute their plan, but accidentally reset Buzz to Spanish mode instead of his old persona. Buzz {{promptly}} allies himself with Woody and falls in love with Jessie. The toys reach a dumpster, but are cornered by Lotso and his gang. As a garbage truck approaches, Woody reveals what he learned about Lotso and shows proof of Daisy's ownership tag, which Chuckles had kept, to Big Baby. Lotso destroys the tag and says that toys are meant to be discarded, but an enraged Big Baby throws Lotso into the dumpster. As the toys try to leave, Lotso pulls Woody into the dumpster just as the truck collects the trash. The rest of Andy's toys fall into the back of the truck while trying to rescue him, and a falling television lands on Buzz, restoring his memory and normal personality. The truck deposits the toys at a landfill, where they find themselves on a conveyor belt, leading to an incinerator. Woody and Buzz help Lotso reach an <b>emergency</b> <b>stop</b> button, only for Lotso to abandon them and escape. The toys resign themselves to their fate, but are soon rescued by the Aliens operating an industrial claw. Lotso is found by a garbage truck driver, who straps him to his truck's radiator grill, and drives away. Woody and the other toys board another garbage truck back to Andy's house.|$|E

25|$|Through 21 CFR 1040, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulates laser {{products}} entering {{commerce and}} requires all classIIIb and classIV lasers offered in commerce in the US to have five standard safety features: a key switch, a safety interlock dongle, a power indicator, an aperture shutter, and an emission delay (normally {{two to three}} seconds). OEM lasers, designed to be parts of other components (such as DVD burners), are exempt from this requirement. Some non-portable lasers {{may not have a}} safety dongle or an emission delay, but have an <b>emergency</b> <b>stop</b> button and/or a remote switch.|$|E

25|$|Power {{consumption}} compares favourably {{with other}} high-speed rail systems. With an efficiency of 0.85, the power required is about 4.2 MW. Energy consumption for levitation and guidance purposes equates to approximately 1.7kW/t. As the propulsion system is also capable of functioning in reverse, energy is transferred {{back into the}} electrical grid during braking. An exception to this is when an <b>emergency</b> <b>stop</b> is performed using the emergency landing skids beneath the vehicle, although this method of bringing the vehicle to a stop is intended {{only as a last}} resort should it be impossible or undesirable to keep the vehicle levitating on back-up power to a natural halt.|$|E
25|$|In May 2009, four {{children}} became ill when the attraction failed {{to stop at}} the end of its cycle. After returning to a horizontal position, a limit switch failed and the ride continued to spin for five to ten minutes. The park's first-aid staff treated the children, while one was transported to an area hospital by his parents; the child was not admitted, however. An investigation determined that the ride operator did not engage an <b>emergency</b> <b>stop</b> switch due to a miscommunication between her and her supervisor; the park's ride operators are trained in how to stop their rides in the event of a malfunction. Since then, additional safety features have been added to ensure that the attraction automatically stops within 15 seconds if the limit switch were to fail.|$|E
25|$|The {{classification}} of a laser {{is based on}} the concept of accessible emission limits (AEL) that are defined for each laser class. This is usually a maximum power (in W) or energy (in J) that can be emitted in a specified wavelength range and exposure time that passes through a specified aperture stop at a specified distance. For infrared wavelengths above 4 μm, it is specified as a maximum power density (in W/m2). It {{is the responsibility of the}} manufacturer to provide the correct {{classification of}} a laser, and to equip the laser with appropriate warning labels and safety measures as prescribed by the regulations. Safety measures used with the more powerful lasers include key-controlled operation, warning lights to indicate laser light emission, a beam stop or attenuator, and an electrical contact that the user can connect to an <b>emergency</b> <b>stop</b> or interlock.|$|E

25|$|The driverless tractor is {{considered}} controversial {{in terms of}} safety and public acceptance. A tractor operating without a driver makes some people nervous. Creating technology that stays safe in all scenarios where failure could possibly occur {{takes a lot of}} programming and time. In terms of motion detection, the tractors have sensors to stop them if they detect objects in their path such as people, animals, vehicles or other large objects. In 2004, researchers from the Danish Royal Veterinary and Agricultural University published a paper in which they examined the safety of a driverless tractor in detail. With their driverless tractor, they had one person designated as a safety operator. This operator controlled a switch which could immediately shut down and halt the tractor. They also wired four <b>emergency</b> <b>stop</b> switches on each corner of the tractor.|$|E
25|$|Selected as a torch bearer for the 2012 London Olympics, Billy Mitchell (Perry Fenwick) {{is stuck}} on the London Underground with members of his local {{football}} team because someone pulled the <b>emergency</b> <b>stop</b> when an argument broke out. The train starts but police are waiting at the tube station and will not let them through. Billy manages to escape, and frantically tries {{to get ready for}} the torch. Meanwhile, Billy's granddaughter, Lola Pearce (Danielle Harold), is in labour in a local fast food restaurant, refusing an ambulance, and refusing to give birth until she knows Billy has carried the torch and can be there. After some delays, Billy is able to carry the torch, watched by his friends and neighbours. He then hears that Lola is in labour, so rushes to the restaurant, where Cora Cross (Ann Mitchell) delivers the baby.|$|E
25|$|Shortly {{after the}} {{incident}} CERN reported that the most likely {{cause of the problem}} was a faulty electrical connection between two magnets, and that– due to the time needed to warm up the affected sectors and then cool them back down to operating temperature– it would take at least two months to fix. CERN released an interim technical report and preliminary analysis of the incident on 15 and 16 October 2008 respectively, and a more detailed report on 5 December 2008. The analysis of the incident by CERN confirmed that an electrical fault had indeed been the cause. The faulty electrical connection had led (correctly) to a failsafe power abort of the electrical systems powering the superconducting magnets, but had also caused an electric arc (or discharge) which damaged the integrity of the supercooled helium's enclosure and vacuum insulation, causing the coolant's temperature and pressure to rapidly rise beyond the ability of the safety systems to contain it, and leading to a temperature rise of about 100 degrees Celsius in some of the affected magnets. Energy stored in the superconducting magnets and electrical noise induced in other quench detectors also {{played a role in the}} rapid heating. Around two tonnes of liquid helium escaped explosively before detectors triggered an <b>emergency</b> <b>stop,</b> and a further four tonnes leaked at lower pressure in the aftermath. A total of 53 magnets were damaged in the incident and were repaired or replaced during the winter shutdown. This accident was thoroughly discussed in a 22February 2010 Superconductor Science and Technology article by CERN physicist Lucio Rossi.|$|E
