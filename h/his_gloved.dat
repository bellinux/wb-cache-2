5|$|Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) are {{assigned}} to the case. Discussing the photograph, Mulder tells Scully about Ted Serios, who was famous for making photos which showed what was in his mind. He takes pictures of <b>his</b> <b>gloved</b> hand using a camera found in Lefante's apartment, and they all appear {{the same as the}} one from the pharmacy. Mulder deduces that the kidnapper has been stalking his victims.|$|E
5|$|While Tszyu {{celebrated in}} his corner, Judah was in disbelief of what just {{happened}} and became infuriated. Judah picked up his stool and hurled it towards center ring. While being restrained by his father and trainer, Yoel Judah, he broke loose and walked up to Nady and stuck <b>his</b> <b>gloved</b> fist into his neck {{and had to be}} pulled off by cornermen. A few minutes later, Jimmy Lennon, Jr. announced the official decision and Judah screamed out and again had to be restrained by a growing number of security guards and cornermen. Judah was fined $75,000 and suspended for six months by the Nevada State Athletic Commission.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to his protective equipment, a catcher usually also adopts practices that minimize his risk of injury. For instance, unlike fielders elsewhere on the field, a catcher tries, to the extent possible, to catch the ball with <b>his</b> <b>gloved</b> hand alone. An outfielder may catch a fly ball by covering the ball, once it strikes {{the pocket of his}} glove, with his bare hand in order to secure it. The catcher, however, tries to keep his bare hand, which is highly vulnerable to injury, out of harm's way by presenting the pitcher with a target (the large round glove) while hiding his unprotected throwing hand behind his back. By doing so, the bare hand cannot be struck by a foul tip. Many broken fingers, split fingernails, and grotesque dislocations are avoided by adherence to this simple expedient.|$|E
50|$|If {{the runner}} slides, the catcher will often make a {{sweeping}} motion with <b>his</b> <b>glove</b> to quickly tag the runner out. Otherwise, the catcher must brace for impact {{and keep the}} ball in <b>his</b> <b>glove</b> or hand in order to tag the runner out.|$|R
50|$|While {{pitching}} for the Giants, Mulholland made a {{play that}} is often shown on sports bloopers shows. After he grabbed a hard-hit ground ball, the ball got stuck in the webbing of <b>his</b> <b>glove.</b> Mulholland then ran towards first base and tossed <b>his</b> <b>glove</b> to first baseman Bob Brenly, who recorded the out.|$|R
60|$|My cousin stood {{drawing on}} <b>his</b> <b>gloves,</b> and eyed me superciliously.|$|R
500|$|Clippard {{is listed}} at [...] and [...] He has an unorthodox {{pitching}} delivery, rocking forward while sticking <b>his</b> <b>gloved</b> hand {{high in the}} air, which creates an unusual arm angle while pitching, {{making it difficult for}} hitters to pick up the ball in their line of vision. Clippard's father taught him to pitch this way when Clippard was eight years old by having him throw his baseball glove. McCatty nicknamed Clippard's delivery [...] "The Funk".|$|E
2500|$|Although no runs {{were scored}} in the first seven innings, Hilldale mounted several threats. In the second inning, they left runners at second and third after a walk by Thomas and a double by Stephens. In the third, Briggs led off with an infield single and was sacrificed to second, but was then picked off by Bell. In the fourth, Mackey led off with a single, and Judy Johnson {{followed}} with a double. Thomas then grounded to short, and Moore threw out Mackey at the plate. After Thomas stole second, George Johnson lined out to first. Stephens walked to load the bases, but Lee struck out to end the threat. In {{the top of the}} eighth, Carr led off with a walk, Mackey got an infield hit, and Judy Johnson singled to short left to load the bases with no outs. Méndez came in to relieve William Bell. Thomas grounded to short, and Moore threw out Carr at home. Santop pinch hit for George Johnson; according to The Chicago Defender: [...] "'Big Bertha' hit one to Moore that was hotter than tabasco sauce. Moore knocked it down with <b>his</b> <b>gloved</b> hand as it bounded fast over the ground, stumbled over second, forcing Thomas out and throwing to Hawkins from a half crouching position, getting Santop headed for first and making one of the prettiest of double plays." ...|$|E
60|$|The doctor beat <b>his</b> <b>gloved</b> hands {{together}} {{to restore the}} circulation.|$|E
5000|$|The {{title of}} The Looney Tunes Show episode [...] "Rebel Without a Glove" [...] (2012) {{came from the}} movie title. In this episode, Bugs Bunny loses <b>his</b> <b>gloves,</b> and has to {{substitute}} biker gloves for them, only to realize that with the change in <b>his</b> <b>gloves,</b> <b>his</b> personality changes and he becomes a rebel.|$|R
60|$|Ginger {{ceased to}} pluck at <b>his</b> <b>gloves</b> and {{advanced}} into the ring.|$|R

60|$|Bellamy {{was drawing}} on <b>his</b> <b>gloves</b> when the hall-porter brought {{a note to}} Laverick.|$|R
6000|$|Suddenly the {{stranger}} raised <b>his</b> <b>gloved</b> hands clenched, stamped his foot, and said, [...] "Stop!" [...] with such extraordinary violence that he silenced her instantly.|$|E
6000|$|... "Not much further, Mr. Dawson," [...] he said. [...] "I {{think we}} had best make for the shore yonder," [...] and he pointed with <b>his</b> <b>gloved</b> hand.|$|E
60|$|The visitor fumbled in {{her side}} pocket and {{produced}} a diminutive ivory case. She withdrew a card {{and handed it to}} Tallente, with a glance at <b>his</b> <b>gloved</b> hands.|$|E
60|$|He bowed slightly, {{and turned}} away, {{arranging}} <b>his</b> <b>gloves</b> as if about to rise.|$|R
60|$|Mr. Bentham {{rose to his}} feet, {{and began}} slowly to draw on <b>his</b> <b>gloves.</b>|$|R

6000|$|He {{looked toward}} Murgh {{to see that}} he had bent himself and with <b>his</b> <b>gloved</b> hand was drawing lines upon the snow. Those lines when they were done {{enclosed}} the shape of a grave! ...|$|E
6000|$|SIR WILLIAM. Just off, my dear. [To his daughters, genially] Rehearsin'? What! [He {{goes up to}} FREDA {{holding out}} <b>his</b> <b>gloved</b> right hand] Button that for me, Freda, would you? It's a bit stiff! ...|$|E
6000|$|Lord Valleys grimaced {{beneath his}} crisp moustache--the word grandpapa always fell queerly on {{the ears of}} one who was but fifty-six, and by no means felt it--and jerking <b>his</b> <b>gloved</b> hand towards Ann, he said: ...|$|E
5000|$|... #Caption: With the Texas Rangers, Wilson coordinated <b>his</b> <b>glove</b> {{color with}} that of his jersey ...|$|R

60|$|Callopy {{showed his}} craft by {{stepping}} back and lining Rube's high pitch to left. Hoffer leaped across and plunged down, getting <b>his</b> <b>gloved</b> {{hand in front}} of the ball. The hit was safe, but Hoffer's valiant effort saved a tie score.|$|E
6000|$|... "Miss Summerson," [...] said Mr. Vholes, {{very slowly}} rubbing <b>his</b> <b>gloved</b> hands, as if, to his cold sense of touch, {{they were much}} the same in black kid or out of it, [...] "this was an ill-advised {{marriage}} of Mr. C.'s." ...|$|E
60|$|The officer barked an order, {{which brought}} {{his men to}} an {{attentive}} halt, then swaggered forward, <b>his</b> <b>gloved</b> hand bearing down the pummel of his sword, his spurs jingling musically as he moved. He announced his authority to the yeoman.|$|E
50|$|Injury ruled {{him out of}} the 2013 International Rules Series so Paddy O'Rourke filled <b>his</b> <b>gloves.</b>|$|R

50|$|He {{took his}} bow {{and went into}} his opening act. He took off <b>his</b> <b>gloves</b> in {{preparation}} to make them disappear {{when he realized that}} something was wrong: he wasn’t wearing his coat. Without his coat, he could not go on with the first act. Instead of panicking, he set <b>his</b> <b>gloves</b> aside and picked up a pack of cards that was on the table.|$|R
