5|$|Holden's early {{architectural}} {{training was}} in Bolton and Manchester {{where he worked}} <b>for</b> <b>architects</b> Everard W. Leeson and Jonathan Simpson before moving to London.

5|$|At {{the dawn}} of the 19th century, less than a handful of academically trained architects were active in Norway, most of them {{military}} officers having studied civil engineering. The market <b>for</b> <b>architects</b> was limited in a sparsely inhabited country with no capital city, no court and no important government institutions. Architecture was of interest mainly to a limited group of wealthy merchants and landowners. However, toward the close of the previous century, this group saw a remarkable increase in prosperity. Large fortunes were made by a few, who then sought to surround themselves with buildings and gardens appropriate to their social position. Well connected internationally, these people were acquainted with the latest trends in architecture. Neoclassical structures were much in demand.|$|E
5|$|In May, {{costs for}} {{construction}} of the station were again increased to $4.1 million. The increased costs were primarily associated with the relocation of fiber optic lines during {{the construction of the}} pedestrian tunnel. To reduce overall costs, village officials asked <b>for</b> <b>architects</b> to remove the tunnel and replace it with an elevated walkway over the tracks. In October 2004, the village board gave final approval to the revised station plan with a pedestrian bridge. The $3.2 million estimated cost of the station was to be financed through a pair of federal transportation grants in addition to the village borrowing against its tax incremental financing district from the adjacent industrial park.|$|E

25|$|In 1812, {{after the}} Battle of Borodino, Gilardis fled Moscow. The city burnt down in September 1812; the {{disaster}} created {{a wealth of}} opportunity <b>for</b> <b>architects.</b> In 1813, Domenico joined the Kremlin Building Commission, restoring Ivan the Great Bell Tower and other war losses. In 1817, his father retired and returned to Ticino; Domenico inherited his job as lead architect of The Orphanage.|$|E
25|$|Another {{innovation}} from post-revolutionary Russia was a {{new type}} of public building: the workers' club and the Palace of Culture. These became a new focus <b>for</b> <b>architects,</b> who used the visual expression of large elements combined with industrial motifs. The most famous of these was the Zuev Club (1927–29) in Moscow by Ilya Golosov (1883–1945), whose composition relied on the dynamic contrast of simple shapes, planes, complete walls and glazed surfaces.|$|E

25|$|After earning their HSSC, {{students}} may study {{in a professional}} institute for Bachelor's degree courses such as engineering (BE/BS/BSc Engineering), medicine (MBBS), dentistry (BDS), veterinary medicine (DVM), law (LLB), architecture (BArch), pharmacy (Pharm.D) and nursing (BSc Nursing). These courses require {{four or five years}} of study. The accreditation councils which accredit the above professional degrees and register these professionals are: Pakistan Engineering Council (PEC), Pakistan Medical and Dental Council (PMDC), Pakistan Veterinary Medical Council (PVMC), Pakistan Bar Council (PBC), Pakistan Council <b>for</b> <b>Architects</b> and Town Planners (PCATP), Pharmacy Council of Pakistan (PCP) and Pakistan Nursing Council (PNC). Students can also attend a university for Bachelor of Arts (BA), Bachelor of Science (BSc), Bachelor of Commerce (BCom) or Bachelor of Business Administration (BBA) degree courses. These all are the courses that are done in Pakistan and are really common. These days doctor of pharmacy is also gaining much reputation. The pharmacy council of Pakistan is doing huge struggle to make the pharmacy education better. Polytechnics and colleges of technology offers technical education.|$|E
500|$|Furthermore, {{he had a}} {{substantial}} impact {{on the development of}} architecture as a professional body through his involvement in the Architects Act of 1931 and the formation of a national body <b>for</b> <b>architects.</b> [...] This political work also had a social dimension: his work on the Building Act Advisory Committee helped to highlight the low quality of the housing in the poorer areas of Adelaide, and this led to a change in how the public viewed what was acceptable as low-income housing. The South Australian Housing Trust was a direct result of his actions, and led to the provision of low cost rental housing to working families in the state.|$|E
500|$|Schmertz's third album, Sing Oh! the City Oh!: Songs of Early Pittsburgh, {{released}} on Folkways Records in 1959, featured folk songs, such as [...] "Celeron", named after Pierre Joseph Céloron de Blainville, and [...] "The Battle of Bushy Run", {{after the battle}} of the same name, in commemoration of the bicentennial of Pittsburgh's founding. A reviewer for Keystone Folklore Quarterly described the album, to which two of his children, Gretchen Schmertz Jacob and John Schmertz, contributed, as [...] "tuneful and well-done in the folk tradition". A reviewer for Billboard magazine called it a [...] "fascinating package of songs" [...] that [...] "will appeal to folklorists, educational groups, and, of course, residents of Pittsburgh particularly". Schmertz released his final album, Ladies Beware of an Architect: Songs <b>for</b> <b>Architects</b> and Their Girlfriends, in 1960.|$|E

500|$|In early February 2012, Rolo Tomassi {{announced}} {{the release of}} a new single: 'Old Mystics'. 'Old Mystics' and its B-side 'Mesmerizer' was written by synthesiser play James Spence in the earliest stages of the Astraea's writing, in late 2011. The single was uploaded to the band's Facebook profile to stream for free. They released the single on 26 March. The band announced a few days after releasing [...] "Old Mystics" [...] for streaming that it will most likely not appear on the new album and will just be a stand-alone single as they felt the two songs did not fit onto Astraea. Rolo Tomassi completed their first tour of the year as the main support <b>for</b> <b>Architects</b> on a 14-date UK tour in April. They used this tour to promote their new single 'Old Mystics' as well as debut other unrecorded new material from the album, such as songs 'Howl' and 'Remancer'. Rolo Tomassi's presence on the tour was met with positive reception; however, reviewers believed the band's music was too aggressive and chaotic for fans of Architects. Tim Sewell when writing for The Courier Online said that: [...] "it was apparent that much of the crowd (mostly Architects fans) were left a little confused by singer/shewolf Eva Spence, who flung herself about in front of them screaming." ...|$|E
500|$|Mountfort {{arrived in}} Canterbury full of {{ambition}} {{and drive to}} begin designing in 1850 {{as one of a}} wave of settlers encouraged to immigrate to the new colony of New Zealand by the British Government. With him and his wife from England came also his brother Charles, his sister Susannah, and Charles' wife, all five of them aged between 21 and 26. Life in New Zealand at first was hard and disappointing: Mountfort found that there was little call <b>for</b> <b>architects.</b> Christchurch {{was little more than a}} large village of basic wooden huts on a windswept plain. The new émigré's architectural life in New Zealand had a disastrous beginning. His first commission in New Zealand was the Church of the Most Holy Trinity in Lyttelton, built in 1852 by Isaac Luck. The building proved vulnerable to high winds and was considered unsafe. It was demolished in 1857. [...] This calamity was attributed to the use of unseasoned wood and his lack of knowledge of the local building materials. Whatever the cause, the result was a crushing blow to his reputation. A local newspaper called him [...] "...a half-educated architect whose buildings... have given anything but satisfaction, he being evidently deficient in all knowledge of the principles of construction, though a clever draughtsman and a man of some taste.".|$|E
