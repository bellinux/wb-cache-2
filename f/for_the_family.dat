Although this program is meant to provide poor families {{with an increase in}} income, the conditionalities has led to a time poverty <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>family</b> members who are in charge of fulfilling the conditions, most oftentimes the woman.

40|$|A {{topic of}} the {{bachelor}} thesis is "Typology of services dealing with a care for families and their significance". <b>The</b> care <b>for</b> <b>families</b> with children is currently a hot topic that affects the entire social system, from lawmakers to client families which attend NGOs. Just NGOs provide {{a large amount of}} the services dealing with <b>the</b> <b>family</b> issues. <b>The</b> bachelor thesis theoretically and practically deals with aspects concerning services for families with children. A goal of the thesis was to map <b>the</b> services <b>for</b> <b>families</b> with children in Plzeň and České Budějovice and to compare an offer and demand for these services in chosen towns. Quantitative and qualitative research strategies were chosen to meet objectives. Through a questionnaire there were obtained data about organizations providing services <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>families</b> with children in organizations towns of České Budějovice and Plzeň <b>for</b> <b>the</b> cooperation. <b>The</b> basic sample <b>for</b> <b>the</b> qualitative research consisted of managers from organizations in České Budějovice and Plzeň or their representatives. A semi-standardized interview was conducted with both target groups. Before the beginning of the research I set following research questions: Does the current range of offered services <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>families</b> with children in Plzeň correspond to <b>the</b> demand <b>for</b> them? Does <b>the</b> current offer of services <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>families</b> with children in České Budějovice correspond to <b>the</b> demand <b>for</b> those services? Is the offer of services <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>families</b> with children in Plzeň greater than in České Budějovice? What kind of services <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>families</b> with children are missing in Plzeň? What kind of services <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>families</b> with children are missing in České Budějovice? The research showed that there are more organizations providing services <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>families</b> with children in Plzeň than in České Budějovice, but the demand is greater than offer yet. The question of the offer and demand <b>for</b> <b>the</b> services <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>families</b> with children is currently in both towns sufficient, but representatives from all organizations expressed their concern <b>for</b> <b>the</b> future in connection with a constantly increasing number of <b>the</b> client <b>families</b> compared to previous years. Results of the thesis include a typology of the services which are missing in the towns and so they can contribute to an origination of new organizations able to cover and ensure a complexity of <b>the</b> services <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>families</b> with children in Plzeň and České Budějovice...|$|R

After observing the family's quirks, Gabriel takes the family to a forest and diagnoses the family's problems accordingly: Marge tries to prove her self-worth to the family by medicating them with food, Bart is addicted to doing crazy stunts for attention, and Homer is simply a drunken buffoon. Gabriel then sets up a challenge to teach the Simpsons the importance of teamwork by setting up a picnic basket in a tree.
