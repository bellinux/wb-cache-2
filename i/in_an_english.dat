5|$|By {{the late}} 1950s Barnes {{was one of}} the senior players in the side, and succeeded Roy Paul as captain when Paul retired in 1957. During the 1957–58 season Barnes became the third player to score a hat-trick of {{penalties}} <b>in</b> <b>an</b> <b>English</b> top-flight match, as part of a 6–2 defeat of Everton. At this time Barnes was the club's primary penalty taker, helping him to score 11 goals {{over the course of the}} season. In his later years at Manchester City, Barnes role as captain meant he had become a strong influence on younger players. A particularly notable example was Denis Law, who joined the club in 1960, the pair becoming lifelong friends.|$|E
5|$|Correspondence between Chesney and {{his nephew}} Gilbert Foliot {{suggests}} {{their relationship was}} quite close.

Some of Archbishop Theobald's letters, written to Chesney and recorded in John of Salisbury's collection of letters, contain the earliest recorded quotations from Gratian's Decretum <b>in</b> <b>an</b> <b>English</b> source. They were part of a letter sent by Theobald to Chesney discussing difficult legal cases, and giving advice on how to resolve them.|$|E

5|$|George Herbert Hirst (7 September 1871– 10 May 1954) was a {{professional}} English cricketer who played first-class cricket for Yorkshire County Cricket Club between 1891 and 1921, with a further appearance in 1929. He played in 24 Test matches for England between 1897 and 1909, touring Australia twice. One of the best all-rounders of his time, Hirst was a left arm medium-fast bowler and right-handed batsman. He completed the double of 1,000 runs and 100 wickets <b>in</b> <b>an</b> <b>English</b> cricket season 14 times, the second most of any cricketer after his contemporary and team-mate Wilfred Rhodes. One of the Wisden Cricketers of the Year for 1901, Hirst scored 36,356 runs and took 2,742 wickets in first-class cricket. In Tests, he made 790 runs and captured 59 wickets.|$|E
5|$|He {{needed to}} score heavily as England had a {{strengthened}} batting line-up, while the Australian bowling was over-reliant on O'Reilly. Grimmett was overlooked, but Jack Fingleton made the team, so the clique of anti-Bradman players remained. Playing 26innings on tour, Bradman recorded 13centuries (a new Australian record) and again made 1,000first-class runs {{before the end}} of May, becoming the only player to do so twice. In scoring 2,429runs, Bradman achieved the highest average ever recorded <b>in</b> <b>an</b> <b>English</b> season: 115.66.|$|E

5|$|Humpty Dumpty is a {{character}} <b>in</b> <b>an</b> <b>English</b> nursery rhyme, probably originally a riddle {{and one of the}} best known in the English-speaking world. He is typically portrayed as a personified egg, though he is not explicitly described as such. The first recorded versions of the rhyme date from late eighteenth-century England and the tune from 1870 in James William Elliott's National Nursery Rhymes and Nursery Songs. Its origins are obscure and several theories have been advanced to suggest original meanings.|$|E
5|$|In {{the same}} year, Delius began a {{fruitful}} association with German supporters of his music, the conductors Hans Haym, Fritz Cassirer and Alfred Hertz at Elberfeld, and Julius Buths at Düsseldorf. Haym conducted Over the Hills and Far Away, which he gave under its German title Über die Berge in die Ferne on 13 November 1897, {{believed to be}} the first time Delius's music was heard in Germany. In 1899 Hertz gave a Delius concert in St. James's Hall in London, which included Over the Hills and Far Away, a choral piece, Mitternachtslied, and excerpts from the opera Koanga. This occasion was an unusual opportunity for an unknown composer at a time when any sort of orchestral concert was a rare event in London. In spite of encouraging reviews, Delius's orchestral music was not heard again <b>in</b> <b>an</b> <b>English</b> concert hall until 1907.|$|E
5|$|The Battle of Brunanburh is an Old English poem. It is {{preserved}} in the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, a historical record of events in Anglo-Saxon England which was kept from the late ninth to the mid-twelfth century. The poem records the Battle of Brunanburh, a battle fought in 937 between an English army and a combined army of Scots, Vikings, and Britons. The battle resulted <b>in</b> <b>an</b> <b>English</b> victory, celebrated by the poem in style and language like that of traditional Old English battle poetry. The poem is notable because of those traditional elements and has been praised for its authentic tone, {{but it is also}} remarkable for its fiercely nationalistic tone, which documents the development of a unified England ruled by the House of Wessex.|$|E

The record highest {{attendance at}} the ground was set on 14 January 1931, when 12,721 saw Sheffield United play York in an FA Cup third round replay. The highest attendance in the Football League was 10,120, for a Third Division North match against Port Vale on 21 April 1930. The record lowest attendance for a Football League match was 1,735, when York played New Brighton on 25 April 1931 in the Third Division North. The lowest {{attendance at the}} ground for any first-team fixture was 1,500 for an FA Cup preliminary round match against Maltby Main on 23 September 1925.|$|E
5|$|Their FA Cup {{success was}} the first in a decade in which Arsenal were the {{dominant}} club in England.

Arsenal won the title with two games to spare, and finished the season having scored 127 league goals (another club record), though Aston Villa managed to score 128, which is still a record for the most goals <b>in</b> <b>an</b> <b>English</b> top flight season.|$|E
5|$|Waddington {{was less}} {{effective}} in 1923, and despite a good bowling average, he was inconsistent. In July, he slipped on wet grass {{when he was}} about to bowl against Leicestershire at Fartown Ground, Huddersfield; the subsequent shoulder injury effectively ended his season, apart from one match against Lancashire in which he bowled just six overs. In September, the injury required an operation to repair a torn ligament. The injury affected the remainder of his career and his bowling was never as effective. In total, before his injury, he took 65 wickets at 18.23 in 1923. That season, he recorded his best figures with the bat; after never having a first-class batting average better than 12 <b>in</b> <b>an</b> <b>English</b> season, he scored 317 runs at 24.38, including his first fifty in England.|$|E
