50|$|Lars Leksell {{was born}} in Fässberg Parish, Sweden on November 23, 1907. He {{completed}} medical studies at the Karolinska Institute and began his neurosurgical training in 1935 under Herbert Olivercrona. Development of <b>electronystagmography</b> and his thesis on muscular control and gamma motor neurons were his early scientific achievements.In 1949, he developed his arc centered stereotactic frame based on A polar coordinate system. In 1951, using the Uppsala University cyclotron, Leksell and the physicist and radiobiologist Borje Larsson, developed the concept of radiosurgery. Leksell and Larsson first employed proton beams coming from several directions into a small area into the brain, in experiments in animals {{and in the first}} treatments of human patients. Thus, he achieved a new non-invasive method of destroying discrete anatomical regions within the brain while minimizing the effect on the surrounding tissues. He became a professor of surgery at University of Lund in 1958. From 1960 until his retirement, in 1974, he was Professor & Chairman of neurosurgery at the Karolinska Institute in Stockholm, succeeding Herbert Olivecrona, who was the department's founder in 1920.|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{determine}} the best clinical method for identifying peripheral vestibular nystagmus, by comparing eye movement examination with optic fixation, and with fixation removed using Frenzel's glasses, infra-red video-Frenzel's goggles or an ophthalmoscope, with results of <b>electronystagmography.</b> METHOD: One hundred patients referred for <b>electronystagmography</b> from the audiovestibular medicine clinic at Queen Alexandra Hospital, Portsmouth, were examined immediately before undergoing <b>electronystagmography.</b> RESULTS: Video-Frenzel's goggles were highly effective at detecting peripheral vestibular nystagmus, with a sensitivity of 85 per cent (95 per cent confidence interval, 62. 1 - 96. 8 per cent) and a specificity of 65 per cent (53. 5 - 75. 3 per cent), compared with <b>electronystagmography.</b> Ophthalmoscopy had comparable sensitivity to Frenzel's glasses (used in the dark), i. e. 26. 3 per cent (9. 1 - 51. 2 per cent) compared with 31. 6 per cent (12. 6 - 56. 6 per cent), respectively. Frenzel's glasses as normally used in ENT clinics (i. e. in dim lighting) were ineffective, with a sensitivity of just 10 per cent (1. 2 - 31. 7 per cent). CONCLUSION: Video-Frenzel's goggles {{should be used in}} all clinics with substantial numbers of balance-impaired patients.

40|$|Vestibular {{function}} {{tests were}} performed {{on a series of}} 57 {{children between the ages of}} 1 and 16 years. Inattention and immaturity of eye movement control created difficulties in the analysis of the <b>electronystagmography</b> traces in some instances. With the eyes closed, spontaneous and positional nystagmus occurred in 20 % of asymptomatic children and this was thought to be physiological. Changes in external ear pressure (fistula test) enhanced this spontaneous nystagmus. Smooth pursuit ataxia and optokinetic abnormalities were common in the children with reading disabilities and those with congenital deafness, and were thought to be soft neurological signs of brainstem dysfunction. The torsion swing chair test was acceptable and gave easily readable responses. Caloric abnormalities were very common in children with reading disabilities and provided useful information in those with congenital and acquired disorders of hearing and balance.

40|$|OBJECTIVE [...] To {{assess the}} {{diagnostic}} efficiency {{and costs of}} protocols used for investigating patients with suspected lesions of the cerebellopontine angle. DESIGN [...] Prospective evaluation of tests of auditory brain stem responses and acoustic reflex thresholds, <b>electronystagmography,</b> and calorics. Positive test results were confirmed or refuted by high resolution computed tomography with intravenous enhancement. SETTING [...] Single general otolaryngology clinic in a teaching hospital. PATIENTS [...] 270 consecutive patients with sensorineural hearing loss requiring investigation to exclude a lesion of the cerebellopontine angle. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES [...] Estimated costs of various diagnostic protocols and performance in detecting tumours of the cerebellopontine angle. RESULTS [...] Protocols including tests of auditory brain stem responses and acoustic reflex thresholds as sifting tests before computed tomography were clinically acceptable and presented considerable savings {{over the use of}} computed tomography in all patients (74, 000 pounds or 84, 000 pounds v 122, 000 pounds).

40|$|SummaryThe {{causes of}} {{dizziness}} {{are difficult to}} be diagnosed. At present we {{have a variety of}} tests and exams but none of them can adequately evaluate the vestibular function. The most commonly used tests are <b>electronystagmography</b> and posturography. Aim: The objective {{of this study was to}} analyze the results of stabilometry in patients with complaints of dizziness who had normal results in <b>electronystagmography</b> and to compare them with a control group. Study Design: The study was prospective and transversal. Material and method: It was conducted at the ENT department, University Hospital, Federal University of Rio de Janeiro. Twenty-two patients (fifteen women and seven men) aged on average 47. 6 ± 9 were evaluated. The control group was made up of twenty-five healthy individuals (eighteen women and seven men) aged on average 46. 8 ± 7. Results: In all analyzed parameters, there were statistically significant differences between the groups. Comparing the results with closed and opened eyes, the anterior-posterior mean velocity in the control group was the only statistically significant result. Conclusion: We concluded that the group of patients had statistically significant results in relation to the control group in all the analyzed parameters, showing that the group of patients with complaints of dizziness had more instability in standing position than the group of healthy individuals...|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVES [...] To {{review the}} {{clinical}} features, <b>electronystagmography</b> findings, the possible mechanism, {{and a possible}} therapeutic approach to {{benign paroxysmal positional vertigo}} (BPPV). METHODS [...] Sixty-three cases of BPPV of the horizontal canal type have been reviewed. It is characterised by horizontal nystagmus and an intense vertigo, provoked by rotation of the head in a supine patient. The horizontal nystagmus beats towards the ground on both sides, becomes more pronounced when lying on the pathological side, and then the nystagmus often changes direction. RESULTS [...] Forty-eight patients underwent <b>electronystagmography.</b> On the pathological side, the first phase nystagmus had a mean latency of three seconds and a mean duration of 31. 6 seconds. Nystagmus inversion occurred in 36 patients after a nystagmus free interval. The mean second phase nystagmus duration lasted 33. 4 seconds. On the healthy side, the nystagmus had a mean latency of 3. 4 seconds and a mean duration of 39. 5 seconds. Fatigue was seen in six patients. Simultaneous involvement of the posterior canal was present in 16 patients. A liberatory manoeuvre was successful in six patients. CONCLUSIONS [...] The liberatory manoeuvre should be tried in patients with horizontal canal vertigo. It should not be performed in patients with severe cervical arthrosis, vertebrobasilar insufficiency, or when the patient has neck pain during the manoeuvre...|$|E
