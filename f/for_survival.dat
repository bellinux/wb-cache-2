5|$|A {{population}} bottleneck is when {{a population}} contracts to a significantly smaller size over {{a short period of}} time due to some random environmental event. In a true population bottleneck, the odds <b>for</b> <b>survival</b> of any member of the population are purely random, and are not improved by any particular inherent genetic advantage. The bottleneck can result in radical changes in allele frequencies, completely independent of selection.|$|E
5|$|Alien, a science-fiction action horror franchise, {{tells the}} story of humanity's ongoing {{encounters}} with Aliens: a hostile, endoparasitoid, extraterrestrial species.

30|$|The 5 -year overall {{survival}} rate of patients was 77.9  %, and the 3 -year disease-free survival was 76.7  %. <b>For</b> overall <b>survival,</b> a significant benefit was noted {{for treatment of}} at least 8 cycles, <b>for</b> disease-free <b>survival,</b> significant differences were apparent from patient data of those who underwent from 7 to 12 treatment cycles. Multivariate survival analysis of that patient data at cycle 8 <b>for</b> overall <b>survival</b> and cycle 7 <b>for</b> disease free <b>survival</b> revealed cycle number as the only independent prognostic factor (p =  0.04, 0.048).|$|R

5|$|As a three-year-old, Soyer was {{diagnosed}} with leukaemia, and doctors were pessimistic about his chances <b>for</b> <b>survival.</b> Despite being declared cancer free {{by the age of}} six, the cancer came back when he was eight years old.

5|$|As {{well as the}} {{evolution}} of new metabolic pathways, evolution can also cause the loss of metabolic functions. For example, in some parasites metabolic processes that are not essential <b>for</b> <b>survival</b> are lost and preformed amino acids, nucleotides and carbohydrates may instead be scavenged from the host. Similar reduced metabolic capabilities are seen in endosymbiotic organisms.|$|E

In this ant-fungus mutualism, both species depend on each other <b>for</b> <b>survival.</b> The ant Allomerus decemarticulatus has evolved a three-way association with the host plant, Hirtella physophora (Chrysobalanaceae), and a sticky fungus which is used to trap their insect prey.|$|E
5|$|Higginbotham re-joined Stoke, {{now in the}} Premier League, in September 2008 for a £2.5million fee. On 19 October 2008, Higginbotham {{scored the}} first goal of his second spell, with a penalty in a 2–1 win over Tottenham Hotspur. He was the first choice at left-back for manager Tony Pulis, playing in 28 league matches as the team {{successfully}} fought <b>for</b> <b>survival.</b> However, he missed the final five matches of the season due to a slipped disc. He later underwent surgery.|$|E
5|$|Larvae hatch {{from their}} egg casing {{in two to}} six weeks. They are born carnivores, feeding instinctively on small {{invertebrates}} that move in their field of vision. Food items include small aquatic crustaceans (cladocerans, copepods and ostracods), aquatic dipterans and tadpoles. As they develop, they naturally feed upon larger prey. To increase their chances <b>for</b> <b>survival,</b> some individuals grow bigger heads and become cannibals, and feed upon their own brood mates.|$|E

5|$|The {{chemicals}} in the red-colored zone include an aromatic quinone, beta-carotene, and chlorophyll. The quinone is deep-red colored pigment chiodectonic acid, thought {{to function as a}} radiation protectant; in combination with beta-carotene, which has an established role in cellular DNA repair following exposure of the organism to UV-damage, such radiation protectants are often found in lichens and in extremophilic situations and are essential <b>for</b> <b>survival.</b>|$|E

Brock refuses to eat human brains; the symbiote abandons him, and he is locked in an asylum under the care of the deranged Dr. Paine. Brock escapes to hunt the symbiote, which has gone on a killing spree to obtain brains. He reunites with the symbiote (after finding an alternative source of the chemical), but Paine steals the symbiote for himself. Brock frees the symbiote, and again becomes Venom.|$|E
5|$|Among the Ainu, the otter {{is portrayed}} as an {{occasional}} messenger between humans and the creator. The sea otter is a recurring figure in Ainu folklore. A major Ainu epic, the Kutune Shirka, tells the tale of wars and struggles over a golden sea otter. Versions of a widespread Aleut legend tell of lovers or despairing women who plunge into the sea and become otters. These links {{have been associated with}} the many human-like behavioral features of the sea otter, including apparent playfulness, strong mother-pup bonds and tool use, yielding to ready anthropomorphism. The beginning of commercial exploitation had a great impact on the human, as well as animal, populations the Ainu and Aleuts have been displaced or their numbers are dwindling, while the coastal tribes of North America, where the otter is in any case greatly depleted, no longer rely as intimately on sea mammals <b>for</b> <b>survival.</b>|$|E
