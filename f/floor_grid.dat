In this study, the correlation between gut microbiota composition determined by Denaturing Grade Gel Electrophoresis (DGGE) and tag-encoded 16 S rRNA gene amplicon pyrosequencing (454 /FLX) and behavior in the Tripletest (Elevated Plus Maze, Light/Dark Box, and Open Field combined), the Tail Suspension Test, and Burrowing in 28 female BALB/c mice exposed to two weeks of <b>grid</b> <b>floor</b> induced stress was investigated. Cytokine and glucose levels were measured at baseline, during and after exposure to <b>grid</b> <b>floor.</b> Stressing the mice clearly changed the cecal microbiota as determined by both DGGE and pyrosequencing. Odoribacter, Alistipes and an unclassified genus from the Coriobacteriaceae family increased significantly in the <b>grid</b> <b>floor</b> housed mice. Compared to baseline, the mice exposed to <b>grid</b> <b>floor</b> housing changed {{the amount of time spent}} in the Elevated Plus Maze, in the Light/Dark Box, and burrowing behavior. The <b>grid</b> <b>floor</b> housed mice had significantly longer immobility duration in the Tail Suspension Test and increased their number of immobility episodes from baseline. Significant correlations were found between GM composition and IL- 1 α, IFN-γ, closed arm entries of Elevated Plus Maze, total time in Elevated Plus Maze, time spent in Light/Dark Box, and time spent in the inner zone of the Open Field as well as total time in the Open Field. Significant correlations were found to the levels of Firmicutes, e. g. various species of Ruminococccaceae and Lachnospiraceae. No significant difference was found for the evaluated cytokines, except an overall decrease in levels from baseline to end. A significant lower level of blood glucose was found in the <b>grid</b> <b>floor</b> housed mice, whereas the HbA 1 c level was significantly higher. It is concluded that <b>grid</b> <b>floor</b> housing changes the GM composition, which seems to influence certain anxiety-related parameters...|$|R

40|$|In this thesis, several Reliability-based Design Optimization (RBDO) {{methods and}} {{algorithms}} for airplane <b>floor</b> <b>grid</b> layout optimization are proposed. A general RBDO process is proposed and validated by an example. Copula as a mathematical method to model random variable correlations is introduced {{to discover the}} correlations between random variables and to be applied in producing correlated data samples for Monte Carlo simulations. Based on Hasofer-Lind (HL) method, a correlated HL method is proposed to evaluate a reliability index under correlation. As an alternative method for computing a reliability index, the reliability index is interpreted as an optimization problem and two nonlinear programming algorithms are introduced to evaluate reliability index. To evaluate the reliability index by Monte Carlo simulation in a time efficient way, a kriging-based surrogate model is proposed and compared to the original model in terms of computing time. Since in RBDO optimization models the reliability constraint obtained by MCS {{does not have an}} analytical form, a kriging-based response surface is built. Kriging-based response surface models are usually segment functions that do not have a uniform expression over the design space; however, most optimization algorithms require a uniform expression for constraints. To solve this problem, a heuristic gradient-based direct searching algorithm is proposed. These methods and algorithms, together with the RBDO general process, are applied to the layout optimization of aircraft <b>floor</b> <b>grid</b> structural design. M. S.

40|$|Objectives: To {{elucidate}} the pharmacological profile of aripiprazole, we examined its ameliorating {{effect on the}} methamphetamine-induced disruption of latent inhibition (LI) in rats. Method: The effect was measured using a conditioned emotional response procedure. The conditioned stimulus was a tone (2. 8 kHz, 90 dB), and the unconditioned stimulus was a mild foot shock delivered through a <b>floor</b> <b>grid.</b> The conditioning procedure was repeated five times. Results: Methamphetamine-induced (1. 0 mg/kg, i. p.) disruption of LI was ameliorated by the administration of haloperidol (0. 2 mg/kg, i. p.) and by a moderate dose of aripiprazole (0. 3 mg/kg, i. p.) but not by a lower or higher dose (0. 1 or 3. 0 mg/kg, i. p.) of aripiprazole. However, immunohistochemical examination showed increased levels of c-Fos expression in the shell of the nucleus accumbens after the administration of haloperidol (0. 2 mg/kg, i. p.) but not of aripiprazole (0. 3 mg/kg, i. p.).

40|$|The present paper {{describes}} two {{experiments in}} which preferences of laboratory mice for materials which {{could serve as}} cage enrichment were investigated. In the first experiment, presence of nesting material (paper towel or tissue) {{and the presence of}} a nest box (perforated metal or clear perspex box) were tested against each other. On average, the 47 mice tested spent significantly more time in the cage with the nesting material (more than 69 % of their total time, whereas less than 25 % of their time in the cage with the nest box). In the second experiment, the preferred nesting material (tissues) was placed in a cage with a <b>grid</b> <b>floor</b> (previously found to be avoided) and the nest box (perforated metal) was placed in another cage, connected to the first, with a solid floor covered with sawdust bedding material. In this experiment, 24 female mice were tested and on average they spent more than 67 % of their time in the cage with the nesting material, despite the presence of a <b>grid</b> <b>floor.</b> Thus, it is concluded that providing a cage with nesting material (in addition to bedding) may be essential for the well-being of laboratory mice. ...|$|R

30|$|The goal {{of these}} grids {{is to support}} long range {{interactions}} by representing {{the state of the}} environment (namely, the presence of pedestrians and their capability to be perceived from nearby cells) in terms of field modifications. In this way, a local perception for pedestrians actually simply consists in gathering the necessary information in the relevant cells of the <b>floor</b> field <b>grids.</b> In other works, the concept of perception and its practical implementation is more sophysticated, starting from the definition of the field of view mechanism in humans: in (Paris and Donikian 2009) pedestrian’s perception is investigated from a cognitive point of view, while a more physical approach is adopted in (Shao and Terzopoulos 2007). Nonetheless, in CA based approaches such a precise perception model is rarely employed and still the achieved results are often extremely interesting, therefore we decided to employ a simple perception model and evaluate its adequacy.|$|R

40|$|The author {{presents}} the results of measurements of total deformations of the space-grid floor in relation to the torsional strain of beams and the rigidity of beams in bending and torsion while monitoring the erection of the floor of a building. Any space grid system is utterly sensitive to changes in relations between the rigidity of elements. No experimental data covering space <b>grid</b> <b>floors</b> or any method of analysis of their stress-strain state are available. The author performed the assessment of interrelations between the rigidity of some beams in the two directions by means of a full-scale loading test (monitoring) of the monolithic space <b>grid</b> <b>floor,</b> beam size 8. 0 × 9. 2 m. The purpose of the assessment was to confirm the bearing capacity and the design patterns based on deflections and stresses of elements to select the operational reinforcement value. Monolithic concrete was used to perform the load test. As a result, the width of concrete ribs was found uneven. In the design of reinforced concrete space rib floors it is advisable to develop detailed models of structures through the employment of the finite element method due to the significant sensitivity of the system to distribution and redistribution of stresses. Large spans of monolithic space rib floors require the monitoring of the stress-strain state and computer simulations to adjust the design pattern {{on the basis of the}} monitoring results.

40|$|The {{detection}} of synathropic rodents {{may be difficult}} since they are animals with nocturnal activity. Methods of their detection and monitoring rely mostly on indirect signs of their activity such {{as the presence of}} faeces, urine, consumed foods and damaged materials. Our experimental hypothesis was that the production of fluorescent faeces - following consumption of fluorescent bait - may be used for rodent monitoring. For this purpose we studied the production of fluorescent faeces, temporal dynamics and detectability in wild black rat (Rattus rattus). Wild black rats were individually housed in experimental cages with the wire-mesh <b>grid</b> <b>floor</b> and faeces were collected in short-time intervals. The peak of fluorescent activity in faeces was detected 10 - 20 hours after bait ingestion.

In Experiment III, tail shock and foot shock were compared in a within-subject design while the temporal pattern of responding during conditioned stimuli was recorded.

40|$|A {{variety of}} space flight models are {{available}} to mimic the physiologic changes seen in the rat during weightlessness. The model reported by Wronski and Morey-Holton has been widely used by many investigators, in musculoskeletal physiologic studies especially, resulting in accumulation of an extensive database that enables scientists to mimic space flight effects in the 1 -g environment of Earth. However, information on nutrition or gastrointestinal and renal function in this space flight model {{is limited by the}} difficulty in acquiring uncontaminated metabolic specimens for analysis. In the Holton system, a traction tape harness is applied to the tail, and the rat's hindquarters are elevated by attaching the harness to a pulley system. Weight-bearing hind limbs are unloaded, and there is a headward fluid shift. The tail-suspended rats are able to move freely about their cages on their forelimbs and tolerate this procedure with minimal signs of stress. The cage used in Holton's model is basically a clear acrylic box set on a plastic <b>grid</b> <b>floor</b> with the pulley and tail harness system attached to the open top of the cage. Food is available from a square food cup recessed into a corner of the floor. In this system, urine, feces, and spilled food fall through the <b>grid</b> <b>floor</b> onto absorbent paper beneath the cage and cannot be separated and recovered quantitatively for analysis in metabolic balance studies. Commercially available metabolic cages are generally cylindrical and have been used with a centrally located suspension apparatus in other space flight models. The large living area, three times as large as most metabolic cages, and the free range of motion unique to Holton's model, essential for musculoskeletal investigations, were sacrificed. Holton's cages can accommodate animals ranging in weight from 70 to 600 g. Although an alternative construction of Holton's cage has been reported, it does not permit collection of separate urine and fecal samples.

40|$|The {{present study}} was {{designed}} to provide evidence that the behavioral effects of physostigmine are related to inhibition of brain acetylcholinesterase (AChE). Adult male Holtzman rats were trained to pole jump to a buzzer as the conditioned stimulus and to electric shock to the <b>grid</b> <b>floor</b> as the unconditioned stimulus. All drugs were given s. c. as base. Physostigmine (0. 125 - 0. 25 mg/kg) depressed pole jump behavior in methyl atropine (2. 1 mg/kg) or saline-treated rats. (-) Hyoscyamine (1 mg/kg) blocked the actions of physostigmine, suggesting a central site of action. Total brain acetylcholine (ACh) and AChE were determined in various groups of animals. The increase in brain ACh and the decrease in AChE activity were negatively correlated in physostigmine-treated rats. These changes were highly correlated during the onset and peak of physostigmine behavioral effects but not during the recovery period. Although (-) hyoscyamine antagonized the behavioral effects of physostigmine, it did not alter the increase in brain ACh or decrease in brain AChE.

40|$|Scotophobin is a peptide previouslu {{identified}} [14] as the behaviorally active {{factor in}} brain extract of rats trained in passive dark avoidance. Mice injected intraperitoneally with a synthetic version of scotophobin or placebo were tested without reinforcement {{in a box}} with one dark and two white chambers. Scotophobin recipients spent less time than controls in the dark chamber. When strict precautions were taken against chemical degradation, the dose-response relationship remained stable for months and resembled that found by Ungar for natural scotophobin. A content analysis of all frequent mouse behaviors in the test apparatus delineated a more detailed scotophobin behavior pattern. Scotophobin elevated emotionally as measured by defecation rate when mice were locked in the dark box, but not when they were locked in a white or transparent box. The dark box as used in the original rat training situation produced the maximal drug induced avoidance effect.

40|$|According to the {{effective}} reinforcement theory of avoidance learning, {{there is a}} positive relationship between the level of context fear and {{the effective}}ness of feedback stimuli. The present research used different preexposure treatments to manipulate context fear and to evaluate the effects of feedback stimuli in two-way avoidance learning. Rat subjects received nonreinforced preexposure either to the nonvisual context cues (avoidance apparatus with the houselights extinguished), to the visual context cues (avoidance apparatus with the houselights on but with a Plexiglas <b>floor</b> covering the <b>grids),</b> or to a neutral box. During subsequent avoidance training conditioned stimulus termination was delayed for 5 s after an instrumental response and either a flashing light or darkness was presented as a feedback stimulus. Without preexposure, darkness produced better avoidance performance than did the flashing light. Preexposure to the visual context cues decreased the effectiveness of darkness as a feedback stimulus. However, preexposure to either the visual or to the nonvisual context cues facilitated avoidance performance when a flashing light was used as a feedback stimulus. The results suggest that the effects of a feedback stimulus may be dependent upon the amount and source of context fear...|$|R
40|$|Three {{experiments}} {{investigated the}} reinforcing value {{of access to}} a safe place during timeout from an avoidance schedule.

In some conditions, a shelf was inserted into the operant chamber during timeout, enabling subjects {{to get off the}} <b>grid</b> <b>floor.</b> The combination of timeout and shelf maintained substantially higher response rates than the baseline avoidance schedule with ratio requirements as high as 90 (Experiment I). Adding the shelf to timeouts in one component of multiple fixed-ratio schedules of timeout resulted in higher response rates in the component where the shelf was included (Experiment II). When timeouts with and without the shelf were arranged on concurrent schedules, the shelf-timeout combination was preferred, even when of shorter duration than timeout alone (Experiment III). In all three experiments, subjects climbed on the shelf, although all shocks were cancelled during timeout periods. The results could not be accounted for solely in terms of the reinforcing properties of changes in shock rates, but required an interpretation that ascribed conditioned reinforcing value to stimuli associated with such changes...|$|R

In this regard, it {{has been proposed}} that cues associated with repeated administration of drugs can trigger motivational states that can in turn facilitate drug seeking and intake. Therefore, conditional effects are important to study in the context of drug addiction. Research focusing on consolidation and expression of memories supporting cueinduced behaviors, is currently paying considerable attention to the noradrenergic (NE) system, and in particular to α₁ and β-adrenergic receptors. First, our studies in the laboratory focused on exploring the effects of propranolol (nonspecific antagonist of b-adrenergic receptors), with prior repeated administration of cocaine / saline (inducing conditioned sensitization) in the same context (CS +). Sensitized animals showed further drug-free, context-dependent hiperactivation, an effect that was prevented by propranolol. The present study further explored the role of NE receptors by using prazosin, a selective α-adrenergic receptors antagonist. Male DBA/ 2 J animals received intraperitoneal injections of 0 or 20 mg/kg of cocaine on alternate days (Mon, Wed, Fri, Mon, Wed, Fri) in order to achieve psychomotor sensitization. Locomotor activity of animals treated with cocaine was always assessed in a chamber with a particular <b>flooring</b> configuration (<b>grid</b> or hole; counterbalanced), CS+. This design was also used for saline treated animals (CS-). On day 15 of the experiment all animals were presented with the CS +; we obtained conditioned hyperactivity in the group previously treated with cocaine. Prazosin did not block this effect. The finals results were that prazosin has no effect on repeated administration of cocaine-induced conditioned hyperactivity...|$|R
