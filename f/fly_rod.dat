25|$|Custom rod {{building}} {{is an active}} hobby among fly fishermen. See <b>Fly</b> <b>rod</b> building.|$|E
25|$|Saltwater {{fly fishing}} {{is most often}} done from a boat, either a shallow draft flat boat is used to pursue species such as bonefish, redfish, permit and tarpon in shallow waters, or from larger {{offshore}} boats for pursuing sailfish, tuna, dorado, marlin and other pelagics and may be done from shore, such as wading flats for bonefish or redfish or surf fishing for striped bass and other assorted fish. Typically, most trout fly fisherman need to practice new skills to catch saltwater fish on a <b>fly</b> <b>rod.</b> Ocean fish are usually harder to catch. They can be extremely spooky, and much larger. Trout fisherman need to practice with at least an 8 weight <b>fly</b> <b>rod</b> and accurately cast the line 30–90 feet {{if they are going}} to have success—particularly in the flat areas fishing for bonefish, redfish, permit, tarpon, jacks and more.|$|E
25|$|Each rod {{is sized}} {{to the fish}} being sought, the wind and water {{conditions}} and also to a particular weight of line: larger and heavier line sizes will cast heavier, larger flies. Fly rods come {{in a wide variety}} of line sizes, from size #000 to #0 rods for the smallest freshwater trout and pan fish up to and including #16 rods for large saltwater game fish. Fly rods tend to have a single, large-diameter line guide (called a stripping guide), with a number of smaller looped guides (aka snake guides) spaced along the rod to help control the movement of the relatively thick fly line. To prevent interference with casting movements, most fly rods usually have little or no butt section (handle) extending below the fishing reel. However, the Spey rod, a <b>fly</b> <b>rod</b> with an elongated rear handle, is often used for fishing either large rivers for salmon and Steelhead or saltwater surf casting, using a two-handed casting technique.|$|E
50|$|Note {{that the}} line weight {{generalities}} described above hold for both single-handed <b>fly</b> <b>rods</b> as well as double-handed <b>fly</b> <b>rods</b> used for Spey Casting, but the length and usage of double-handed rods often varies significantly.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Fly</b> <b>rods</b> {{normally}} vary between 2 m (6 ft) and 4 m (13 ft) {{in length}} {{with the most}} common length sold being 2.74 m (9 ft). Rod lengths are typically given in imperial measurements of feet and inches. <b>Fly</b> <b>rods</b> and lines are designated as to their [...] "weight", typically written as Nwt where 'N' is the number (e.g. 8wt, 9wt, 10wt).|$|R

25|$|In fly fishing, {{fish are}} caught by using {{artificial}} flies that are cast with a <b>fly</b> <b>rod</b> and a fly line. The fly line (today, almost always coated with plastic) is heavy {{enough to send}} the fly to the target. The main difference between fly fishing and spin or bait fishing is that in fly fishing {{the weight of the}} line carries the hook through the air, whereas in spin and bait fishing the weight of the lure or sinker {{at the end of the}} monofilament or braided line gives casting distance. Artificial flies are of several types; some imitating an insect (either flying or swimming), others a bait fish or crustacean, others attractors are known to attract fish although they look like nothing in nature. Flies can be made either to float or sink, and range in size from a few millimeters to 30cm long; most are between 1 and 5cm.|$|E

5000|$|Saltwater <b>fly</b> <b>rods</b> {{are built}} to handle {{powerful}} fish and to cast large, bulky flies over longer distances or into strong winds. Saltwater <b>fly</b> <b>rods</b> are normally fitted with heavier, corrosion-resistant fittings. The reel seat {{may also be}} equipped with a short extension often called a [...] "fighting butt". Rods for saltwater fishing fall into the 8 to 15 weight class, with 12-weight being typical for most larger species like tuna, dorado (mahi-mahi) and wahoo (ono).|$|R
25|$|A {{wide variety}} of <b>Fly</b> <b>rods</b> of {{different}} weights, lengths and material are used to present artificial flies to target species of fish as well as fight and land fish being caught.|$|R
50|$|The son of E.F. Payne and {{the owner}} of the E.F. Payne Rod Company, Payne {{designed}} and built bamboo <b>fly</b> <b>rods</b> for almost 70 years. His rods are prized by fishermen and collectors. Experts consider Payne to {{have been one of the}} great designers and bamboo rodmakers in the history of fly fishing.|$|R
2500|$|Spey casting is {{a casting}} {{technique}} used in fly fishing. Spey casting requires a longer, heavier two-handed <b>fly</b> <b>rod,</b> {{referred to as}} a [...] "Spey rod". Spey casting is essentially a large roll cast, developed on the Scottish River Spey where high banks do not allow space for the usual back cast.|$|E
2500|$|Fly {{fishing is}} an angling method {{in which an}} {{artificial}} [...] "fly" [...] is used to catch fish. The fly is cast using a <b>fly</b> <b>rod,</b> reel, and specialized weighted line. Casting a nearly weightless fly or [...] "lure" [...] requires casting techniques significantly different from other forms of casting. Fly fishermen use hand tied flies that resemble natural invertebrates, baitfish, other food organisms, or [...] "lures" [...] to provoke the fish to strike (bite at the fly).|$|E
2500|$|In {{conventional}} fishing, smallmouth may {{be successfully}} {{caught on a}} wide range of natural and artificial baits or lures, including crankbaits, hair jigs, plastic jerkbaits, artificial worms, spinnerbaits, and all types of soft plastic lures, including curly tail grubs or tubes with lead head jigs. [...] Spinning reels or baitcasting reels may be used, with line strengths of 6 to 15 pounds typically utilised. Rods are usually of ultralight to medium-heavy action. They may also be caught with a <b>fly</b> <b>rod</b> using a dry or wet artificial fly, nymphs, streamers, or imitations of larger aquatic creatures, such as hellgrammites, crawfish, or leeches. [...] Floating topwater popper fly patterns and buzz baits are also popular for smallmouth fishing.|$|E
50|$|The {{earliest}} <b>fly</b> <b>rods</b> {{were made}} from greenheart, a tropical wood, and later bamboo originating in the Tonkin area of Guangdong Province in China. The mystical appeal of handmade split-cane rods has endured despite the emergence over the last 50 years of cheaper rod-making materials that offer more durability and performance: fiberglass and carbon fiber.|$|R
60|$|After breakfast R.C. and I got out our {{tackles and}} rigged up <b>fly</b> <b>rods,</b> and sallied {{forth to the}} lake with the same eagerness we had felt when we were boys going after chubs and sunfish.

5000|$|Nose grease {{is often}} {{recommended}} as a lubricant for <b>fly</b> fishing <b>rod</b> ferrules.|$|R
2500|$|A rod {{is usually}} also {{classified}} by the optimal weight of fishing line {{or in the}} case of fly rods, fly line the rod should handle. Fishing line weight is described in pounds of tensile force before the line parts. Line weight for a rod is expressed as a range that the rod is designed to support. <b>Fly</b> <b>rod</b> weights are typically expressed as a number from 1 to 12, written as [...] "N"wt (e.g. 6wt.) and each weight represents a standard weight in grains for the first 30 feet of the fly line established by the American Fishing Tackle Manufacturing Association. For example, the first 30' of a 6wt fly line should weigh between 152-168 grains, with the optimal weight being 160 grains. In casting and spinning rods, designations such as [...] "8-15 lb. line" [...] are typical.|$|E
2500|$|Fly rods, thin, {{flexible}} {{fishing rods}} designed to cast an artificial fly, usually {{consisting of a}} hook tied with fur, feathers, foam, or other lightweight material. More modern flies are also tied with synthetic materials. Originally made of yew, green hart, and later split bamboo (Tonkin cane), most modern fly rods are constructed from man-made composite materials, including fibreglass, carbon/graphite, or graphite/boron composites. Split bamboo rods are generally considered the most beautiful, the most [...] "classic", and are also generally the most fragile of the styles, and they require {{a great deal of}} care to last well. Instead of a weighted lure, a <b>fly</b> <b>rod</b> uses the weight of the fly line for casting, and lightweight rods are capable of casting the very smallest and lightest fly. Typically, a monofilament segment called a [...] "leader" [...] is tied to the fly line on one end and the fly on the other.|$|E
2500|$|A fly reel is a single-action reel, {{normally}} {{operated by}} stripping line off the reel with one hand, while casting the rod {{with the other}} hand. [...] The main purpose of a fly reel is to store line, provide smooth uninterrupted tension (drag) when a fish makes a long run, and counterbalance the weight of your <b>fly</b> <b>rod</b> when casting. [...] When used in fly fishing, the fly reel or fly casting reel has traditionally been rather simple in terms of mechanical construction, and little has changed from the design patented by Charles F. Orvis of Vermont in 1874. Orvis first introduced {{the idea of using}} light metals with multiple perforated holes to construct the housing, resulting in a lighter reel that also allowed the spooled fly line to dry more quickly than a conventional, solid-sided design. [...] Early fly reels placed the crank handle {{on the right side of}} the reel. [...] Most had no drag mechanism, but were fitted with a click/pawl mechanism intended to keep the reel from overrunning when line was pulled from the spool. [...] To slow a fish, the angler simply applied hand pressure to the rim of the revolving spool (known as [...] "palming the rim"). [...] Later, these click/pawl mechanisms were modified to provide a limited adjustable drag of sorts. [...] Although adequate for smaller fish, these did not possess a wide adjustment range or the power to slow larger fish.|$|E
50|$|Modern rods are {{sophisticated}} casting tools {{fitted with}} line guides and a reel for line stowage. They are most commonly made of fibreglass, carbon fibre or, classically, bamboo. Fishing rods vary in action {{as well as}} length, {{and can be found}} in sizes between 24 inches and 20 feet. The longer the rod, the greater the mechanical advantage in casting. There are many different types of <b>rods,</b> such as <b>fly</b> <b>rods,</b> tenkara rods, spin and bait casting rods, spinning rods, ice rods, surf rods, sea rods and trolling rods.|$|R
5000|$|In 1922, Garrison met George Parker Holden, {{author of}} The Idyll of the Split-Bamboo. [...] Initially, Everett was {{interested}} in bamboo construction {{as a way to}} improve the shafts on his golf clubs and began to visit Holden at his house in Yonkers. Both men were avid golfers, both also shared a love of fly fishing. It was there that Garrison made his first bamboo <b>fly</b> <b>rods.</b>|$|R
25|$|Marden {{was an avid}} fly-fisherman, {{which led}} to his {{interest}} in bamboo, of which finer <b>fly</b> <b>rods</b> are made. This love {{led him to the}} bamboo groves of China's Kwangtung Province, thereby becoming, in 1974, the first National Geographic representative since the Communist Revolution of 1949 to return to this country. Marden observed and photographed the cultivation and processing of Tonkin bamboo in its restricted growing area in southern China.|$|R
2500|$|Tenkara rods are {{a type of}} <b>fly</b> <b>rod</b> {{used for}} tenkara fishing in Japan. A mixture of the rods in the other categories, they are carbon rods, fly rods and {{telescopic}} rods all in one. These are ultra-light and very portable telescopic rods (read more about telescopic below). Their extended length normally ranges from 11 to 13 feet, {{and they have a}} very soft action. The action of tenkara rods has been standardized as a ratio of [...] "how many parts are stiffer : how many tip parts bend more easily". The standard actions are 5:5, 6:4, 7:3, and 8:2, with 5:5 being a softer/slower rod, and 8:2 being a stiffer rod. Similar to western fly-rods tenkara rods also have cork, and sometimes even wooden handles, with wooden handles (such as red-pine, and phoenix-tree wood) being the more prized rods due to their increased sensitivity to fish bites and the heavier feel that helps balance the rods. Tenkara rods have no guides. Tenkara is a fixed-line fishing method, where no reel is used, but rather the line is tied directly to the tip of the rod. Like the carbon rods mentioned above this allows for [...] "very precise positioning of the fly of which the which in turn enables huge catches of fish with accurate feeding". One of the most common flies used in tenkara fishing is the Sakasa Kebari. Tenkara fishing is very popular in Japan, where these rods can be found in every major tackle shop. In the US, tenkara is beginning to grow in popularity.|$|E
6000|$|Several {{years went}} by before Pattison's mind {{recovered}} spring and equilibrium, and the unstrung nerves were restored to energy. Fishing, the open air, solitude, scenery, slowly repaired the moral ravages of the college election. The <b>fly</b> <b>rod</b> 'was precisely the resource of which my wounded nature stood in need.' About the middle of April, after long and anxious preparation of rods and tackle, {{with a box of}} books and a store of tobacco, he used to set out for the north. He fished the streams of Uredale and Swaledale; thence he pushed on to the Eden and the waters of the Border, to Perthshire, to Loch Maree, Gairloch, Skye, and the far north. When September came, he set off for rambles in Germany. He travelled on foot, delighting in the discovery of nooks and corners that were not mentioned in the guidebooks. Then he would return to his rooms in college, and live among his books. To the undergraduates of that day he was a solemn and mysterious figure. He spoke to no one, saluted no one, and kept his eyes steadily fixed on infinite space. He dined at the high table, but uttered no word. He never played the part of host, nor did he ever seem to be a guest. He read the service in chapel when his turn came: his voice had a creaking and impassive tone, and his pace was too deliberate to please young men with a morning appetite. As he says here, he was a complete stranger in the college. We looked upon him with the awe proper to one who was supposed to combine boundless erudition with an impenetrable misanthropy. In reading the fourth book of the Ethics, we regarded the description of the High-souled Man, with his slow movements, his deep tones, his deliberate speech, his irony, his contempt for human things, {{and all the rest of}} the paraphernalia of that most singular personage, as the model of the inscrutable sage in the rooms under the clock. Pattison was understood to be the Megalopsuchos in the flesh. It would have been better for him if he could have realised the truth of the healthy maxim that nobody is ever either so happy or so unhappy as he thinks. He would have been wiser if he could have seen the force in the monition of Goethe:-- ...|$|E

25|$|Traditionally rods {{are made}} from bamboo, while {{contemporary}} rods are usually made from fibreglass or carbon fibre. In contrast with nets, which are usually used in subsistence and commercial fishing, fishing rods are more often used in recreational fishing and competitive casting. Fishing rods come in many sizes, actions, lengths and configurations depending on whether {{they are to be}} used for small, medium or large fish or in different fresh or salt water situations. Various types of fishing rods are designed for specific types of fishing. <b>Fly</b> <b>rods</b> are used to cast artificial <b>flies,</b> spinning <b>rods</b> and bait casting rods are designed to cast baits or lures. Ice fishing rods are designed to fish through small holes in ice covered lakes. Trolling rods are designed to drag bait or lures behind moving boats.|$|R
25|$|These rods {{are used}} to fish for smaller species, they provide more sport with larger fish, or to enable fishing with lighter line and smaller lures. Though the term is {{commonly}} {{used to refer to}} spinning or spin-cast <b>rods</b> and tackle, <b>fly</b> <b>rods</b> in smaller line weights (size #0–#3) have also long been utilized for ultra-light fishing, as well as to protect the thin-diameter, lightweight end section of leader, or tippet, used in this type of angling.|$|R
25|$|Tackle design {{began to}} improve from the 1880s. The {{introduction}} of new woods to the manufacture of <b>fly</b> <b>rods</b> {{made it possible to}} cast flies into the wind on silk lines, instead of horse hair. These lines allowed for a much greater casting distance. A negative consequence of this, was that it became easy for the much longer line to get into a tangle. This problem spurred the invention of the regulator to evenly spool the line out and prevent tangling.|$|R
