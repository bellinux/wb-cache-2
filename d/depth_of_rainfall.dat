An outstanding characteristic of these soils is a prominent horizon of calcium carbonate accumulation {{at or near the}} <b>depths</b> <b>of</b> <b>rainfall</b> penetration. Objectives <b>of</b> this study were to discuss the genesis, morphological and physico-chemical properties of calcic horizons and mineralogy and classification of soils in semi-arid region. Five representative profiles were selected and soil samples were collected to determine the chemical and physical properties. Carbonate accumulation and clay eluviation-illuviation are the dominant processes in these soils. Calcium carbonate in the studied soils varied from continuous coatings with weakly cemented matrix which appears as few to common carbonate nodules (stage II) and to plugged horizon (stage III). Palygorskite, chlorite, illite, smectite and vermiculite minerals were observed in soil samples. Illite and chlorite are largely inherited from parent materials. Inheritance, transformation and neoformation from other minerals are the main pathways for the occurrence of smectite and palygorskite in the studied soils. Presence of kaolinite only in deeper calcic horizons suggested that these horizons developed in a tropical climate that shifted gradually towards semi-arid conditions.

A stochastic point process model based on a class of doubly stochastic Poisson processes is proposed to analyse finescale point rainfall time series. In this model, rain cells arrive according to a doubly stochastic Poisson process whose arrival rate is determined by a finite-state Markov chain. Each rain cell has a random lifetime.

The objective function is to minimize {{the sum of the}} square of the deviation between predicted and actual direct runoff hydrograph of a watershed. The predicted runoff hydrograph is esti-mated by using a PDF. In a unit hydrograph, the <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> <b>rainfall</b> excess must be unity and the ordinates must be positive. Incorporation of a PDF ensures that the <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> <b>rainfall</b> excess for the unit hydrograph is unity, and the ordinates are also positive. Unit hydrograph ordinates are in terms of intensity of rainfall excess on a discharge per unit catchment area basis, the unit area thus representing the unit rainfall excess.

The number of variables to be estimated by optimization {{is the same as the}} number of probability distribution parameters; gamma and log-normal probability distribu-tions are used.

The objective of this project was to establish the relationship between daily rainfall amounts and that portion <b>of</b> the <b>rainfall</b> lost to evaporation in the subsequent 24 -hour period. Evaporation is the link between the hydrological cycle and the surface energy budget, therefore the evaporation evaluation techniques were based on both the soil water balance and the energy balance. The energy balance methods included the Bowen ratio, and the Penman-Monteith and G-D equations. The soil water balance was evaluated with precipitation measurements as well as replicates of two different types of microlysimeters that allowed evaluation of the drainage component. The dataset consisted of daily soil moisture changes from microlysimeters, soil moisture measurements, and daily rainfall; additional measurements included net radiation, ground heat flux, air temperatures, relative humidities, and windspeed. This dataset spanned 36 days in August and early September 1994. The microlysimeters that permitted drainage were deemed to be more representative of field conditions, as they allowed the drainage during rainfall to be quantified, but the drainage component after rainfall was difficult to isolate. The replicated microlysimeters produced a spatially averaged estimate of evaporation. Microlysimetric and energy balance methods gave evaporation estimates of 43. 1 to 64. 4 mm during a time when the precipitation received was 59. 9 mm. The two methods deemed to most accurately reflect actual evaporative losses were the G-D and cotton-capped (corrected for drainage) microlysimetric methods which produced evaporative loss estimates of 43. 1 and 47. 1 mm, respectively. Estimates of subsequent 24 -hour evaporation by the two methods indicate 20. 1 and 22. 2 mm, respectively, of the 59. 9 mm of precipitation was lost on the day following rainfall. The dataset was limited and no rigorous regression techniques could be used to establish a quantifiable relationship between daily rainfall amounts and subsequent 24 -hour evaporative loss, but the portion <b>of</b> daily <b>rainfall</b> that could be viewed as effective precipitation decreased with decreasing daily <b>depths</b> <b>of</b> <b>rainfall...</b>|$|R

Also because of enough depth of soil gully erosion is common over these soils. For studying of gully development trend in loess hilly area of Gorgan, Golestan province three typical gully selected with 40 cm— 50 cm depth, 90 cm— 110 cm width and 300 cm— 500 cm length. The slop of area was 12 %. Average of annual rainfall is 700 mm. To measure the surface area and changes from cutting back or bank collapse a rectangular grid of erosion pin was set out at an appropriate interval. After each rainfall the dimensions of gully measured again. From 43 rainfall event in one-year study only 6 of them had measurable changes in gullies. In each rainfall event intensity, depth and time of rainfall data was collected from Hashem abad station in 3 km far from study area. The results of this study showed that after each rainfall the amount of degraded soil was between. 0. 1 m 3 — 0. 5 m 3. The total of soil eroded in one-year study was about 0. 6 m 3 for each gully.

40|$|Three-dimensional (3 D) {{numerical}} {{analyses were}} conducted to investigate groundwater responses in an initially unsaturated cut slope at Lai Ping Road in Hong Kong subjected to rainfalls with various patterns, durations, and return periods. Initial and boundary conditions were established from field monitoring data. The computed results show that rainfall pattern has a significant influence on pore-water pressures in soil layers near the ground surface but its influence gradually diminishes with depth. Rainfall with an advanced storm pattern of 24 h duration was found to be the most critical because it results in the highest pore-water pressure in the slope. At a given <b>depth,</b> the influence <b>of</b> <b>rainfall</b> pattern on pore-water pressures depends on the initial groundwater conditions: the higher the initial water table, the smaller the influence <b>of</b> <b>rainfall</b> pattern on pore-water pressures. Under a given rainfall duration, the rise of pore-water pressure at the study site is significant only when the return period increases from 10 years to 100 years, but not from 100 years to 1000 years. Short-duration, intense rainfall causes larger variations in pore-water pressure at shallow depths, whereas long-duration rainfall has a greater influence on groundwater in deep soils because of the generally greater amount <b>of</b> <b>rainfall.</b> For prolonged rainfalls, the difference in pore-water pressure distribution resulting from different rainfall patterns is less significant than that from short-duration, intense rainfalls...|$|R

In recent years integrated models have been developed to simulate the entire urban wastewater system, including urban drainage systems, wastewater treatment plants, and receiving waterbodies. This paper uses such an integrated urban wastewater model to analyze the frequency of receiving water quality in an urban wastewater system with the aim of assessing the overall system performance during rainfall events. The receiving water quality is represented by two indicators: event mean dissolved oxygen (DO) concentration and event mean ammonium concentration. The compliance probability of the water quality indicators satisfying a specific threshold is used to represent the system performance, and is derived using the rainfall events from a series <b>of</b> 10 years' <b>rainfall</b> data. A strong correlation between the <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> each <b>rainfall</b> event and the associated volume of combined sewer overflow (CSO) discharges is revealed for the case study catchment, while there is a low correlation between the intensity/duration <b>of</b> the <b>rainfall</b> event and the volume of the CSO discharges. The frequency analysis results obtained suggest that the event mean DO and ammonium concentrations have very different characteristics in terms of compliance probabilities at two discharging points for CSO and wastewater treatment plant effluent, respectively. In general, the simulation results provide an understanding of the performance of the integrated urban wastewater system and can provide useful information to support water quality management...|$|R
