500|$|At {{the college}} level, his coaches at the University of Michigan also {{accepted}} Robinson's practice. [...] After learning that Robinson could run the 100 meters in 10.4 seconds with his shoes untied, Michigan quarterbacks coach Rod Smith called it [...] "the damnedest thing I've ever seen" [...] and added, [...] "Anybody that runs that fast I'm not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>him</b> how to tie his shoes."

500|$|In {{preparation}} for the 2012–13 season, Gannon signed defenders Sean Newton and James Tunnicliffe, and took back Paul Turnbull on loan once again. However, he was disappointed to lose striker Tom Elliott, who rejected a contract offer to switch to Cambridge United. He also appointed long-time associate Alan Lord as his assistant. However County found themselves struggling in the league, and Gannon blamed the predicament on the board's decision to slash the wage budget in the summer. An angry Lord Snape told the press that [...] "I'm getting pretty fed up of watching part-time teams beat Stockport County. Changes {{are going to be}} made unless things improve. Jim Gannon's pretty good at telling me how this club should be run. Well I'm <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>him</b> that I'm not impressed by the way the team is being run. If we lose a couple of our next games, we're in a relegation battle with a much bigger budget than most of the teams down there with us, which quite frankly is not good enough." [...] Fourteen months into his second spell at Edgeley Park and with County sitting in the relegation zone, Gannon was relieved of his duties as Stockport manager on 16 January 2013 following the 3–1 home defeat by Mansfield Town.|$|E

He was so long about it that Ginger began {{to think he was}} bearing malice, but just as he was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>'im</b> agin, the cab pulled up in a quiet little street opposite a small pub. Ginger Dick and Peter went in and 'ad something and brought one out for Sam. They 'ad another arter that, and Ginger, getting 'is good temper back agin, asked the cabman to 'ave one.|$|R

[...] A white man came on stage and introduced Sitting Bull as the man who had killed General Custer (which, of course, was absolutely false). [...] Sitting Bull arose and addressed the audience in the Sioux tongue, as he did not speak nor understand English. [...] He said, ‘My friends, white people, we Indians are on our way to Washington to see the Grandfather, or President of the United States. [...] I see so many white people and what they are doing, that it makes me glad to know that some day my children will be educated also. [...] There is no use fighting any longer. [...] The buffalo are all gone, as well {{as the rest of the}} game.

2500|$|Initially, Chibnall {{wanted to}} reveal the murderer's {{identity}} to the entire cast and crew at an all-hands meeting on the Harbour Cliffs Beach {{a few days before}} releasing the final three scripts. A short film of completed footage had been edited together to show the cast and crew how the series was coming together. It was his intent {{to reveal the}} secret {{at the end of the}} screen. The night before the meeting, the cast and crew filmed the [...] "re-creation scene" [...] where Tom Miller skateboards through Broadchurch in an attempt to jog people's memories. But some individuals approached Chibnall during the night's shoot and said they enjoyed the suspense, so Chibnall decided not to tell. Reaction by the cast was mixed to his decision. [...] "Olivia Colman, who plays one of the investigating police officers, looked like she was ready to murder me," [...] Chibnall later joked, [...] "while David Tennant grabbed hold of me and said he couldn't believe I wasn't <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>him.</b> But then he admitted he was actually glad."
