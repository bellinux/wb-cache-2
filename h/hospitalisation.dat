40|$|BACKGROUND: To {{follow the}} impact of the 2009 {{influenza}} pandemic in Denmark, influenza surveillance was extended with a system monitoring potentially influenza-associated <b>hospitalisations.</b> METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: National administrative data from 2004 - 2010 from the automatic reporting of all hospital visits and admissions in Denmark (population 5. 5 million) were used. In-patient <b>hospitalisations</b> linked to ICD- 10 codes for potentially influenza-associated conditions (influenza, viral and bacterial pneumonia, respiratory distress, and febrile convulsion) were aggregated by week and age groups; < 5 years, 5 - 24 years, 25 - 64 years and ≥ 65 years. Weekly numbers of influenza-associated <b>hospitalisations</b> were plotted to follow the course of the pandemic. We calculated the total numbers of influenza-associated <b>hospitalisations</b> in each influenza season (week 30 to week 15, the following year). Risk ratios of being admitted with an influenza-associated condition in this season (2009 / 2010) compared to the previous five seasons (2004 / 2005 - 2008 / 2009) were calculated using binary regression. During the pandemic season, influenza-associated <b>hospitalisations</b> peaked in week 47, 2009. The total number of influenza-associated <b>hospitalisations</b> was 38, 273 compared to the median of previous seasons of 35, 662 (p = 0. 28). The risk ratio of influenza-associated <b>hospitalisations</b> during the pandemic season compared to previous seasons was 1. 63 (95 %CI 1. 49 - 1. 78) for 5 - 24 year-olds and ranged between 0. 98 and 1. 08 for the other three age groups. CONCLUSIONS: The 2009 pandemic influenza did not lead to an overall {{increase in the number of}} influenza-associated <b>hospitalisations</b> in Denmark in the 2009 / 2010 season and could be managed within existing hospital capacity. However, there was a disproportionally large impact on the age group 5 - 24 years. The influenza-associated <b>hospitalisations</b> during the 2009 / 2010 pandemic influenza season bore the signature features of historical pandemics: A skewed age-pattern and early out of season transmission...|$|R
40|$|Though injury {{incidence}} and <b>hospitalisations</b> {{are likely to}} be correlated, a range of factors other than incidence of injury in a population may influence trends in hospitalised injuries. These include technical changes in the hospital data's coverage, and real changes in the incidence of <b>hospitalisations</b> independent of the population incidence. This paper addresses the latter using the example of traumatic brain injury (TBI) <b>hospitalisations</b> in New Zealand. Data were New Zealand public hospitals inpatient discharges. Five measures of TBI severity were used. The relative rate of minor to serious TBI <b>hospitalisations</b> declined by approximately 2 – 6 % per year from 1988 to 1998. This decline is observed across different mechanisms and the two severity measures used in the detailed analysis. The relative decline in minor to serious TBI is likely to be related to a change in the probability of admission rather than a change in the population TBI incidence. As most TBI <b>hospitalisations</b> are minor this suggests the trend in TBI <b>hospitalisations</b> was significantly influenced by factors other than changes in population incidence. Any analysis of routinely collected secondary injury data needs to consider case selection carefully, especially if trends are being examined. Applying a severity threshold should give more reliable trends...|$|R
40|$|SummaryObjectiveThis study {{aimed to}} {{investigate}} trends in first-time <b>hospitalisations</b> with {{chronic obstructive pulmonary disease}} (COPD) in a publicly financed healthcare system {{during the period}} from 2002 to 2008 with respect to incidence, outcome and characteristics of <b>hospitalisations,</b> departments, and patients. MethodsUsing health administrative data from national registers, all first-time <b>hospitalisations</b> with COPD in Denmark (population 5. 4 million) were identified. Data based on the individual <b>hospitalisations</b> and patients were retrieved and analysed. ResultsDuring the period 2002 to 2008 the total rate of COPD <b>hospitalisations</b> decreased from 460 to 410 per 100   000 person years. Among persons above 45 years of age, the age- and sex-adjusted incidence rate of first-time COPD <b>hospitalisations</b> decreased by 8. 2 % (95 % CI 5. 0 - 11. 2 %). The inpatient mortality increased OR 1. 16 (95 % CI 1. 01 - 1. 34) and the one-year mortality increased OR 1. 12 (95 % CI 1. 03 - 1. 21). Concurrently, significant age- and sex-adjusted increases were found in use of intensive care, comorbidity, patient travel distance, bed occupancy rate of the receiving department, prior use of oral and inhaled corticosteroids, use of outpatient clinics and encounters in general practice, while length of stay and number of receiving hospitals decreased. ConclusionDecreasing rate of first-time COPD <b>hospitalisations</b> combined with shorter lengths of stay and increasing severity of cases indicates that the use of hospital beds for COPD exacerbations has been gradually restricted. This may be causally related to both the centralisation into overcrowded departments and the improved outside hospital treatment of COPD, also demonstrated in this study...|$|R

A photograph of the pair together was taken at this time, and later published in the Times History of the War. Promoted to sergeant, Howell returned to Australia on 31 October. Having not adequately recovered from his wounds, he was discharged from the Australian Imperial Force on 5 June 1918 on medical grounds.

5|$|In 2004 {{the first}} {{adequately}} large scale {{study on the}} natural history and long-term prognosis of this condition was reported; this showed that at 16 months follow-up 57.1% of patients had full recovery, 29.5%/2.9%/2.2% had respectively minor/moderate/severe symptoms or impairments, and 8.3% had died. Severe impairment or death were more likely in those aged over 37 years, male, affected by coma, mental status disorder, intracerebral hemorrhage, thrombosis of the deep cerebral venous system, central nervous system infection and cancer. A subsequent systematic review of nineteen studies in 2006 showed that mortality is about 5.6% during <b>hospitalisation</b> and 9.4% in total, while of the survivors 88% make a total or near-total recovery.

Finnish infants initially in REST transitioned into the Finnish Extension Study (FES), where they were followed for rotavirus-related <b>hospitalisations</b> and ED visits through their second year of life and beyond. FES identified 150 (31 %) additional rotavirus gastroenteritis (RVGE) cases beyond those identified in REST in the Finnish participants. Overall, RV 5 reduced RVGE <b>hospitalisations</b> and ED visits, regardless of the rotavirus serotype, by 93. 8 % (95 % confidence interval [CI]: 90. 8 – 95. 9 %) for up to 3. 1  years following the last vaccine dose. Vaccine efficacy against combined <b>hospitalisations</b> and ED visits between ages 4  months to 11  months, 12  months to 23  months, and 24  months to 35  months was 93. 9 % (95 % CI: 89. 1 – 96. 9 %), 94. 4 % (95 % CI: 90. 2 – 97. 0 %), and 85. 9 % (95 % CI: 51. 6 – 97. 2 %), respectively. The reduction of <b>hospitalisations</b> and ED visits due to any acute gastroenteritis, rotavirus or not, was 62. 4 % (95 % CI: 57. 6 – 66. 6 %) over the entire follow-up period.

5|$|There {{does not}} appear to be a {{difference}} in motivation for self-harm in adolescent males and females. For example, for both genders there is an incremental increase in deliberate self-harm associated with an increase in consumption of cigarettes, drugs and alcohol. Triggering factors such as low self-esteem and having friends and family members who self-harm are also common between both males and females. One limited study found that, among those young individuals who do self-harm, both genders are just as equally likely to use the method of skin-cutting. However, females who self-cut are more likely than males to explain their self-harm episode by saying that they had wanted to punish themselves. In New Zealand, more females are hospitalised for intentional self-harm than males. Females more commonly choose methods such as self-poisoning that generally are not fatal, but still serious enough to require <b>hospitalisation.</b>|$|E
