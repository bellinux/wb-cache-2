40|$|The need to {{consider}} functional endpoints in defining nutrient The first edition of the recommended dietary allowances (RDAs) was published nearly 55 y ago (1). At that time, knowledge about human nutrient requirements was limited and it was often necessary to extrapolate information from studies in experimental animals. Currently, primarily three different approaches are used to determine human nutrient requirements: 1) balance studies in which nutrient losses are measured in relation to intake; 2) <b>depletion-repletion</b> studies in which sub-jects are maintained on diets low or deficient in a nutrient, followed by correction of the deficit with measured amounts of the nutrient; and 3) the observed intakes of a nutrient by healthy people. In balance studies and <b>depletion-repletion</b> stud-ies, nutrient requirements are defined as the amount required i...|$|E
40|$|Following {{a request}} from the European Commission, the EFSA Panel on Dietetic Products, Nutrition and Allergies (NDA) derived dietary {{reference}} values (DRVs) for thiamin (vitamin B 1). The Panel considers that data from <b>depletion–repletion</b> studies in adults {{on the amount of}} dietary thiamin intake associated with the erythrocyte transketolase activity coefficient (αETK) < 1. 15, generally considered to reflect an adequate thiamin status, or with the restoration of normal (baseline) erythrocyte transketolase activity, without a sharp increase in urinary thiamin excretion, can be used to estimate thiamin requirement. In the absence of new scientific evidence, the Panel endorses the average requirement (AR) of 0. 072 mg/MJ (0. 3 mg/ 1, 000 kcal) for all adults proposed by the Scientific Committee for Food (SCF) in 1993 on the basis of one <b>depletion–repletion</b> study, in which both αETK and urinary thiamin excretion were measured. Results from other <b>depletion–repletion</b> studies are in agreement with this value. The Panel agrees on the coefficient of variation of 20 % used by the SCF to cover uncertainties related to distribution of thiamin requirements in the general population, and endorses the population reference intake (PRI) of 0. 1 mg/MJ (0. 4 mg/ 1, 000 kcal) set by the SCF for all adults. The same AR and PRI as for adults, expressed in mg/MJ, are proposed for infants aged 7 – 11 months, children aged 1 to < 18 years, and during pregnancy and lactation, under the assumption that the relationship between thiamin requirement and energy requirement is the same in all population groups...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT Relative {{bioavailability}} oftwo iron fortificants, electrolytic Fe and ferric or-thophosphate, {{was related}} {{to that of the}} reference ferrous sulfate with in vitro and rat model <b>depletion-repletion</b> methods in four laboratories to compare values directly with those ob-tamed in a parallel human study. In vitro testing was performed on Fe compounds with both solubility and dialysis in a simulated in vitro gastrointestinal digestion system. Two <b>depletion-repletion</b> techniques, hemoglobin-regeneration efficiency (HRE) and an official method of the Association of Official Analytical Chemists (AOAC), were examined. AOAC relative biological values (RBV) of electrolytic Fe were 0. 66 and 0. 78 and of FePO 4 were 0. 25 and 0. 34. HRE values were 0. 78 and 0. 58 for electrolytic Fe and FePO 4, respectively. When compared with FeSO 4 in a radiolabeled farina-based meal fed to humans, the RBV of FePO 4 was 0. 25 and electrolytic Fe 0. 75. Results obtained with the AOAC method serve as the most reliable predic-tion of Fe bioavailability in the human although in vitro dialysis is a promising screening technique.

40|$|ABSTRACT Iron <b>depletion-repletion</b> assays {{were carried}} out with young chicks to {{establish}} Fe bioavaila-bility values for Fe 2 (SO 4) 3 ´ 7 H 2 O (22. 7 % Fe), Fe-ZnSO 4 ´H 2 O (20. 2 % Fe, 13. 0 % Zn), Zn-FeSO 4 ´H 2 O (20. 2 % Zn, 14. 2 % Fe), and cottonseed meal (200 mg Fe/kg). Standard hemoglobin response curves were established using feed-grade FeSO 4 ´H 2 O (28. 8 % Fe) or reagent-grade FeSO 4 ´ 7 H 2 O (20. 1 % Fe) as standards such that relative bioavailability (RBV) could be assessed for the ex-perimental sources of Fe. Weight gain, hemoglobin, and hematocrit responded linearly (P < 0. 05) to Fe sup-plementation in all assays. Using hemoglobin as the response criterion, slope-ratio calculations established Fe RBV values of 126 % for Fe-ZnSO 4 ´H 2 O and 93 % for Zn-FeSO 4 ´H 2 O.

40|$|In this study, {{acute and}} chronic {{responses}} of pancreatic hepatocytes induced in F- 344 rats by copper <b>depletion-repletion</b> protocol to certain hepatocarcinogens were examined. Administration {{of a single}} dose of tannic acid (subcutaneous), aflatoxin B 1 (gavage), or lasiocarpine (intraperitoneally) caused characteristic nucleolar segregation in parenchymal cells of liver {{as well as in}} pancreatic hepatocytes. Chronic dietary administration of 2 -acetylaminofluorene (0. 025 %) for 12 to 32 weeks {{led to the development of}} glutathione S-transferase-P-positive pancreatic hepatocytes in the pancreas. In addition, oval cell proliferation was observed in close association with pancreatic hepatocytes, but not in other areas of pancreas containing residual acinar cells. Oval cells in the pancreas and in the liver that developed in rats after chronic 2 -acetylaminofluorene treatment and pancreatic duct cells stained positively with rat liver oval cell marker OV- 6 antibodies by immunoperoxidase. These findings indicate that pancreatic hepatocytes respond to carcinogens in a fashion similar to parenchymal cells of liver...|$|E
40|$|Lactococcus lactis is a {{commonly}} used starter strain {{that can be}} converted from a vitamin B 2 consumer into a vitamin B 2 2 ̆ 7 factory 2 ̆ 7 by over-expressing its riboflavin biosynthesis genes. The present {{study was conducted to}} assess in a rat bioassay the response of riboflavin produced by GM or native lactic acid bacteria (LAB). The riboflavin-producing strains were able to eliminate most physiological manifestations of ariboflavinosis such as stunted growth, elevated erythrocyte glutathione reductase activation coefficient values and hepatomegalia that were observed using a riboflavin <b>depletion–repletion</b> model. Riboflavin status and growth rates were greatly improved when the depleted rats were fed with cultures of L. lactis that overproduced this vitamin whereas the native strain did not show the same effect. The present study is the first animal trial with food containing living bacteria that were engineered to overproduce riboflavin. These results pave the way for analysing the effect of similar riboflavin-overproducing LAB in human trials...|$|E
40|$|The {{recently}} released Recommended Dietary Allowance of vitamin C for women, 75 mg daily, {{was based on}} data for men. We now report results of a <b>depletion–repletion</b> study with healthy young women hospitalized for 186 +/− 28 days, using vitamin C doses of 30 – 2, 500 mg daily. The relationship between dose and steady-state plasma concentration was sigmoidal. Only doses above 100 mg were beyond the linear portion of the curve. Plasma and circulating cells saturated at 400 mg daily, with urinary elimination of higher doses. Biomarkers of endogenous oxidant stress, plasma and urine F 2 -isoprostanes, and urine levels of a major metabolite of F 2 -isoprostanes were unchanged by vitamin C at all doses, suggesting this vitamin does not alter endogenous lipid peroxidation in healthy young women. By using Food and Nutrition Board guidelines, the data indicate that the Recommended Dietary Allowance for young women should be increased to 90 mg daily...|$|E
40|$|The {{degermination}} of corn grains by {{dry milling}} generates 5 % of a fibrous residue. After segregation and micronization, corn bran becomes a {{potential source of}} dietary fiber consumption. However, its effect on iron bioavailability has not {{been reported in the}} literature. The objective {{of the present study was}} to determine the nutritional composition of corn bran and its effects on iron bioavailability using the hemoglobin <b>depletion-repletion</b> method in rats. The animals were divided into two groups: cellulose (control) and corn bran (experimental). The bran had high content of total dietary fiber, especially the insoluble fraction, and low phytate content. Hemoglobin uptake did not differ between groups at the end of repletion period, and the iron relative bioavailability value of the corn bran diet was 104 % in comparison to that of the control group.

40|$|Heparan sulfate {{proteoglycans}} {{are found}} {{on the surface of}} most cells. Syndecan- 4 is a widely expressed transmembrane heparan sulfate proteoglycan. Using quantitative RNase protection assays and immunoblotting, syndecan- 4 expression was characterized in 3 T 3 -F 442 A mouse adipoblasts. These cells exhibit dramatic changes in their biological and morphological characteristics during differentiation to adipocytes. During this process, the levels of syndecan- 4 protein and mRNA expression changed dramatically. They peaked at the time when quiescent cells reentered the cell cycle before differentiation. Serum <b>depletion-repletion</b> also replicated the syndecan- 4 mRNA induction when the cells were released back into proliferation, and a cycloheximide treatment abolished the peak of induction. In addition, inhibiting syndecan- 4 induction with antisense oligonucleotides inhibited the proliferation of 3 T 3 -F 442 A cells. In the terminally differentiated adipocytes characterized by the loss of proliferation capability, the serum inducibility of syndecan- 4 is repressed, emphasizing the link between syndecan- 4 induction in 3 T 3 -F 442 A cells and cell proliferation...|$|E
40|$|The study {{evaluated}} the iron bioavailability and utilization in rats fed cassava-based complementary diets. Bioavailability and utilization were determined in Sprague-Dawley rats using the iron balance and hemoglobin <b>depletion-repletion</b> methods in a 6 x 8 randomized block design. Rats were depleted by feeding them a low iron casein diet for 14 days. During the repletion period, the rats were fed four composite diets formulated using iron improved cassava varieties {{as the base}} ingredients. Hemoglobin was determined {{at the end of}} depletion and repletion periods. Iron bioavailability expressed as hemoglobin regeneration efficiency (HRE) was higher in the rats that consumed the positive control diet than in those fed test (improved with iron) diets. The present study also found an inverse correlation between diet iron content and bioavailability (r = - 0. 88, P 12 g/dl) except for rat fed the negative control suggesting that iron was poorly utilized. The study confirmed that the overall iron bioavailability expressed as hemoglobin regeneration efficiency (HRE) from composite flour formulated from cassava is low. Peer Revie...|$|E
40|$|Objective: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{establish}} the bioavailability of different folates produced by engineered Lactococcus lactis strains using a rodent <b>depletion-repletion</b> bioassay. Methods: Rats were fed a folate-deficient diet, which produces a reversible subclinical folate deficiency, supplemented with different L lactis cultures that were added as the only source of folate. Three bacterial strains that overexpressed the folC, folKE, or folC + KE genes were used. These strains produce folates with different poly glutamyl tail lengths. The growth response of the rats and the concentration of folates in different organs and blood samples were monitored. Results: The folate produced by the engineered strains was able to compensate the folate depletion in the diet and showed similar bioavailability compared with commercial folic acid that is normally used for food fortification. Folate concentrations in organ and blood samples increased significantly in animals that received the folate-producing strains compared with those that did not receive bacterial supplementation. Hematologic studies also showed that administration of the L towns strains was able to revert a partial megaloblastic anemia caused by folate deficiency. No significant differences were observed in the bioavailability of folates containing different glutamyl tail lengths. Conclusion: To our knowledge, this is the first study that demonstrated that folates produced by engineered lactic acid bacteria represent a bioavailable source of this essential vitamin.

40|$|Background：Recent {{studies suggest}} that the cardioprotective effect of ischemic {{preconditioning}} (IPC) is related to intracellular glycogen content in rat hearts, however, controversies still remain. Methods：To test this hypothesis, isolated Langendorff-perfused rabbit hearts were subjected to 45 min global ischemia followed by 120 min reperfusion with IPC (n＝ 10) or without IPC (ischemic control, n＝ 8). IPC was induced by one cycle of 5 min global ischemia and 10 min reperfusion. In the glucose (G) -free preconditioned group (n＝ 10), G <b>depletion-repletion</b> was induced by perfusion with G-free Tyrode solution for 5 min and then G-containing Tyrode solution for 10 min followed by 45 min ischemia and 120 min reperfusion. For glycogen depletion or loading, hearts were treated with sodium acetate (NA, 5 mM, n＝ 8) or insulin (Ins, 1 unit/L, n＝ 8) for 15 min before 45 min ischemia. Left ventricular function and coronary flow (CF) were continuously recorded during experiments. Myocardial cytosolic and membrane protein kinase C (PKC) activities were measured by 32 P-γ-ATP incorporation into PKC-specific pepetide；glycogen content in the cardiac myocytes was determined by spectrophotometry with amyloglucosidase；expression of PKC isozymes was determined by Western blot with monoclonal antibodies. Infarct size was determined by staining with tetrazolium salt and planimetry. Data were analyzed by ANOVA and Tukey’s post-hoc test. Results：IPC or G-free preconditioning enhance...|$|E
40|$|The {{steady-state}} {{amounts of}} mitochondrial transcripts and transcription proteins were analyzed during mtDNA depletion and subsequent repletion to {{gain insight into}} the regulation of human mitochondrial gene expression. As documented previously, HeLa cells depleted of mtDNA via treatment with ethidium bromide (EB) were found to contain reduced steady-state levels of the mitochondrial transcription factor h-mtTFA. When partially mtDNA-depleted {{cells were cultured in}} the absence of EB, h-mtTFA recovered to normal levels at a significantly slower rate than mtDNA. Human mtRNA polymerase exhibited a similar <b>depletion–repletion</b> profile, suggesting that the mitochondrial transcription machinery is coordinately regulated in response to changes in mtDNA copy number. Newly synthesized mitochondrial transcripts were detected early in the recovery phase, despite the fact that mtDNA, h-mtTFA and h-mtRNA polymerase were simultaneously depleted. Although delayed relative to mtDNA, the amounts of h-mtTFA and h-mtRNA polymerase sharply increased during the later stages of the recovery phase, which was accompanied by accelerated rates of transcription and mtDNA replication. Altogether, these data indicate that when mtDNA copy number is low, it is beneficial to prevent accumulation of mitochondrial transcription proteins. In addition, h-mtTFA and h-mtRNA polymerase are either normally present in excess of the amount required for transcription or their activity is up-regulated to ensure continued expression and transcription-dependent replication of the mitochondrial genome during mtDNA-depleted states...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Vitamin C is a {{cofactor}} in the biosynthesis of carnitine, {{a molecule}} {{required for the}} oxidation of fatty acids. A reduction {{in the ability to}} oxidize fat may contribute to the reported inverse relationship between vitamin C status and adiposity. To examine this possibility, we conducted a preliminary trial to evaluate the impact of vitamin C status on fat oxidation during submaximal exercise. Methods Fat energy expenditure was determined in individuals with marginal (n = 15) or adequate (n = 7) vitamin C status during a submaximal, 60 -minute treadmill test. Subsequently, eight of the subjects with marginal vitamin C status completed an 8 -week double-blind, placebo-controlled, <b>depletion-repletion</b> trial with submaximal exercise testing. Results Individuals with marginal vitamin C status oxidized 25 % less fat per kg body weight during the treadmill test as compared to individuals with adequate vitamin C status. Fat oxidation during exercise was inversely related to fatigue (r = - 0. 611, p = 0. 009). Vitamin C repletion of vitamin C depleted subjects (500 mg vitamin C/d) raised fat energy expenditure during exercise 4 -fold as compared to depleted control subjects (p = 0. 011). Conclusion These preliminary results show that low vitamin C status is associated with reduced fat oxidation during submaximal exercise. Low vitamin C status may partially explain the inverse relationship between vitamin C status and adiposity and why some individuals are unsuccessful in their weight loss attempts. </p...|$|E
40|$|We {{investigated}} {{whether the}} in vivo growth inhibitory {{effect of the}} combination of 4 -amidinoindan-l-one 2 '-amidinohydrazone (CGP 48664 A) and alpha-difluoromethylornithine (DFMO) is reversible by treatment with N- 1 -acetylspermine (N- 1 -acSp). DBA- 2 mice were inoculated with 10 (5) L 1210 cells i. p. on day 0. From day 1 they received 2. 50 mg CGP 48664 A/kg i. p. once daily and 500 mg DFMO/kg i. p. twice daily. On day 5 they received 3 X 2500 nmol N- 1 -acSp i. p. with 15 -min intervals. L 1210 cell numbers, S-phase percentage and polyamine contents, and liver and spleen polyamine contents were monitored in the following 48 h. Four days treatment with CGP 48663 A/DFMO reduced L 1210 cell numbers, S-phase, and spermidine. N- 1 -acSp treatment increased L 1210 spermidine from {{less than or equal}} to 8 h and percentage S-phase from 12 h. Maxima for spermidine and S-phase were reached at {{less than or equal to}} 8 and 18 h, respectively. These were below levels of untreated controls. Decreases were noted from 12 and 18 h, respectively. N- 1 -acSp was detectable in L 1210 from 0 - 18 h. Liver spermidine was decreased by CGP 48664 A/DFlVIO. After N- 1 -acSp treatment, liver N- 1 -acSp and N- 1 -acSd increased from less than or equal to 8 h, reached maxima at less than or equal to 8 and 10 h, respectively, and were undetectable from 15 h. We conclude that the in vivo growth inhibitory effect of CGP 48664 A/DFMO is reversible by N- 1 -acSp treatment. The liver is probably involved in N- 1 -acSp terminal catabolism. The effect of the polyamine <b>depletion-repletion</b> scheme on S-phase cell numbers may be much more profound than present estimates from 5 -bromo- 2 '-deoxyuridine incorporation.

40|$|Determinants of the {{recommended}} dietary allowance (RDA) for vitamin C include the relationship between vitamin C dose and steady-state plasma concentration, bioavailability, urinary excretion, cell concentration, and potential adverse effects. Because current data are inadequate, an in-hospital <b>depletion-repletion</b> study was conducted. Seven healthy volunteers were hospitalized for 4 - 6 months and consumed a diet containing < 5 mg of vitamin C daily. Steady-state plasma and tissue concentrations were determined at seven daily doses of vitamin C from 30 to 2500 mg. Vitamin C steady-state plasma concentrations {{as a function of}} dose displayed sigmoid kinetics. The steep portion of the curve occurred between the 30 - and 100 -mg daily dose, the current RDA of 60 mg daily was on the lower third of the curve, the first dose beyond the sigmoid portion of the curve was 200 mg daily, and complete plasma saturation occurred at 1000 mg daily. Neutrophils, monocytes, and lymphocytes saturated at 100 mg daily and contained concentrations at least 14 -fold higher than plasma. Bioavailability was complete for 200 mg of vitamin C as a single dose. No vitamin C was excreted in urine of six of seven volunteers until the 100 -mg dose. At single doses of 500 mg and higher, bioavailability declined and the absorbed amount was excreted. Oxalate and urate excretion were elevated at 1000 mg of vitamin C daily compared to lower doses. Based on these data and Institute of Medicine criteria, the current RDA of 60 mg daily should be increased to 200 mg daily, which can be obtained from fruits and vegetables. Safe doses of vitamin C are less than 1000 mg daily, and vitamin C daily doses above 400 mg have no evident value...|$|E
40|$|There {{is concern}} {{regarding}} the possible {{negative effects of}} ingestion of dietary fibre on growth and intestinal Fe absorption in infants. {{the aim of the}} present study was to compare the effect of a fibre mixture on the growth and the intestinal absorption of Fe in rats with Fe-deficiency anaemia with that of a diet without fibres. Faecal weight and caecal pH were also evaluated. According to the Hb <b>depletion-repletion</b> model, twenty-two male weaned Wistar rats were fed the AIN 93 -G diet without Fe until Fe-deficiency anaemia was induced with Hb < 70 g/l. the anaemic rats were divided into two groups: (1) fibre mixture group - fed 100 g of fibre mixture/kg of diet (soya polysaccharide, inulin, resistant starch, Arabic gum, fructo-oligossaccharide and cellulose) (n 11); (2) control group - fed without fibres (n 11). All diets had 157 mg of ferric citrate (30 mg of elemental Fe) added to lead to recovery from anaemia. Fe intestinal absorption was measured by Hb repletion efficiency (HRE) and apparent Fe intestinal absorption. the HRE was 44. 8 (SD 9. 5) % in the fibre mixture group and 43. 0 (SD 9. 5) % in the control group (P= 0. 664). the apparent Fe absorption was 46. 2 (SD 16. 5) and 47. 2 (SD 10. 2) % (P= 0. 861) in the fibre mixture and control groups, respectively. the faecal weight median was 6. 17 g in the fibre mixture group and 2. 11 g in the control group (P< 0. 001). the caecal pH was in the same order: 6. 11 (SD 0. 59) and 7. 07 (SD 0. 34) (P< 0. 001). Both the groups consumed similar quantities of diet, and growth was similar in both the groups. the fibre mixture had no influence either on growth or on Fe intestinal absorption in rats recovering from anaemia. This mixture favoured an increase in faecal weight and a decrease in caecal pH.
