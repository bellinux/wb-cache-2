40|$|The {{benefits}} {{which the}} income beneficiary and remainderman ultimately derive from a trust depend primarily, notwithstanding the trustee 2 ̆ 7 s expertise, upon the investment powers which the trustee {{has been given}} by the settlor. In selecting these investment powers to be conferred by the trust instrument, the settlor and his lawyer must consider two familiar problems. The first problem {{is to determine the}} type of investment power to give the trustee which will be most beneficial to both the income beneficiary and remainderman, not only for today, but {{for the duration of the}} trust. The second problem is to draft the trust investment provision to grant the trustee clearly and unambiguously the investment powers intended by the settlor. I. Introduction II.

40|$|Despite {{the deep}} irony {{of free trade}} {{agreements}} being subverted to codify and extend anti-competitive monopoly rights and despite the equally deep irony of foreign investors having greater enforcement rights than local investors, the joining of enhanced intellectual property rights (IPRs) and protections and strengthened investor rights is creating a wild-west opportunity for unbounded corporate power. Two current contestations show the dangers of this expanded power in sharp relief. In the Trans-Pacific Partnership Agreement (TPPA), {{at the behest of}} its powerful pharmaceutical lobby, the United States is seeking the most extreme forms of pharmaceutical patent, data, and enforcement rights that have ever been proposed {{at the same time that}} it is seeking enhanced IP-related investor rights in the most recently leaked Investment Chapter. In the pending investor-state-dispute-settlement case under an older but parallel North America Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) <b>investment</b> <b>clause,</b> an American pharmaceutical company, in Eli Lilly v. Canada, is for the first time claiming $ 500 million in investment-related damages because of Canada’s sovereign decision to invalidate previously granted patents on two medicines on the grounds that those patents failed to meet well-established Canadian standards of patentability. This article is not written as an abstract juxtaposition of these two current events. It is written to expose the dangers that countries face, especially low- and middle-income countries, in trade negotiations with the U. S., Europe, and Japan that seek to impose stronger patent, data, and market entry protections and at the same time seek to expand the armamentarium of enforcement powers available to pharmaceutical behemoths. Part II of the paper contains a brief introduction to the international IP regime, namely the WTO Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) and the TRIPS-plus pharmaceutical protections being sought in the mostly recently leaked TPPA Intellectual Property Chapter and Transparency Chapter still being negotiated between twelve Pacific rim countries. Part III gives a brief historical background on investment treaties and investor-state-dispute-settlement (ISDS). Part IV analyses the TPP Investment Chapter in more depth, particularly its provisions that deal with protection for and enforcement of IP-related investments. Part IV discusses the pending Eli Lilly v. Canada ISDS arbitration, including the claims and defenses of the parties. Part V concludes with a recommendation that investment chapters be struck from the TPP and other trade agreements or that such chapters should not apply whatsoever to the protection or enforcement of IPRs given the many other enforcement powers available to patent holders. The article claims that extending boundless corporate power to Big Pharma through adoption of ISDS for IPRs presents a grave danger to the communal right to health and the right of access to affordable medicines for all...|$|E
40|$|Investor-state {{arbitration}} (ISA) {{has shaped}} the practice, scholarship and teaching of international investment law, {{but to what}} extent has it shaped its substance? According to anecdotal evidence, states change their investment treaties in response to developments in investment arbitration. To separate myth from reality this article empirically investigates the effect of investment arbitration on treaty making through three impact channels: (1) <b>investment</b> <b>clauses,</b> (2) <b>investment</b> claims and (3) investment case law coding close to 1700 international investment agreements (IIA) across 55 clauses. Our analysis sheds new light on several normative debates within the field. First, {{we find that the}} omission or inclusion of <b>investment</b> <b>clauses</b> has no material effect on other treaty design elements. This suggests that ISA clauses are procedural add-ons, which bestow investors with enforcement rights, but do not alter the inter-state nature of the treaties’ substantive obligations. Second, contrary to prior anecdotal and empirical evidence, investment claims do not lead to systematic treaty design changes. Most innovation attributed to investment claims actually pre-dates them. Moreover, only in few countries did investment claims trigger treaty design changes. Hence, rather than worrying about overzealous responses by states to “rebalance” IIAs in the face of investment claims, we should be concerned about the field’s path-dependency and its entrenchment in a pre-arbitration architecture. Third, investment case law exerts the strongest impact on treaty making as controversial interpretive outcomes in investment arbitration trigger traceable changes in treaty design. Hence, states are more active in fine-tuning existing commitments than in designing new ones further entrenching IIAs’ path dependency and lack of innovation...|$|R

40|$|Free trade {{agreements}} (FTAs) and bilateral investment treaties (BITs) typically contain <b>investment</b> <b>clauses</b> designed to attract direct {{foreign investment and}} protect the interests of foreign investors. In addition to defining foreign investment that are entitled to protection, <b>investment</b> <b>clauses</b> typically allow for investor-state dispute resolution, which allows a foreign investor to launch arbitral proceeding directly against the offending government before a private panel of trade lawyers. This paper focuses first on a pro-investor draft investment chapter in an ongoing regional trade negotiation – the Trans-Pacific Partnership Agreement (TPP) - and second on the first investor-state arbitral claim ever by a patent-holding pharmaceutical company under a U. S. free trade agreement, the Eli Lilly v. Canada case. The analysis of the draft TPP chapter shows that it expands protection for drug companies’ “expectations of profit” beyond those contained in the TPP’s proposed Intellectual Property Chapter and risks opening up many patent-affecting decisions and polices of Member States to pharmaceutical investors’ claims. As {{an example of that}} danger, Eli Lilly is currently challenging a well-established patent rule in Canada, the “promise” doctrine, whereby a medicine or any other product’s “utility,” and thus patentability, must be demonstrated or soundly predicted at the time of filing a patent. Eli Lilly, frustrated by the invalidation of its patent on an attention-deficit-disorder drug, makes a number of specific investment chapter claims under NAFTA, including that the Canadian ruling involved a violation of a minimum standard of treatment, indirect expropriation, and discrimination in violation of national treatment norms. A recurrent, indeed dominant feature of Eli Lilly’s investor claim, is that its reasonable expectations of profits may be drawn not just from preexisting Canadian laws and practices, but rather from higher external standards such as utility rules and disclosure norms codified in U. S. and E. U. law. Under the logic of Eli Lilly’s investor-state claim, foreign investors’ expectations have now become unbound. Even the doctrine of legitimate expectations, which is itself a huge stretch of operative minimum standard of treatment principles, is no longer tethered to operative due process (minimum standard of treatment) or to promises of regulatory coherence (indirect expropriation) or to equal treatment compared to domestic firms (national treatment). Instead Eli Lilly hitches its investment expectation to the best deal on IP it has achieved anywhere else. Moreover, it suggests that its expectations tolerate movement on IP policy in only one direction – upward. Any reversal of IP maximalization would dilute the gleam in its eye – unlimited profits on the horizon...|$|R
40|$|Korea and the United States {{declared}} {{the start of}} negotiations {{for the establishment of}} a free trade agreement. The FTA will include investment chapter. That means the Korea-US BIT (Bilateral Investment Treaty) talk, which has been deadlocked since 1998, resumes as a part of FTA negotiations. The FTA investment chapter will be based on the US model BIT, which has been updated in 2004. The updated BIT version includes labor clause which provides that parties should not weaken labor standards in an effort to attract foreign <b>investment.</b> This <b>clause</b> is grounded on the criticism raised by labor groups which asserts that competition among countries to attract foreign investment leads to bidding wars in labor standards. No solid evidence is found in support of the hypothesis that foreign investors favor countries with lower labor standards. Nonetheless, some countries have offered special incentives to investors that limit labor rights in the belief that doing so would help attract foreign investment, especially in export processing or special economic zones. In this regard, the Korea's Act on free economic zones which provides exceptional labor standards to foreign invested enterprise in those zones may become an issue in reaching the FTA. This article contemplates the "not lowering labor standards" provision in the US BIT model and its implications on the FTA talks with the US...|$|R
40|$|Procurement (and concession) {{contracts}} are agreements granting {{the right to}} construct public works, operate and provide a service/good. The main advantage of a procurement contract is that it passes full responsi-bility for investment and operations {{to the private sector}} and consequently provides incentives for e ¢ ciency. Although most contracts include penalty/premium clauses to avoid construction risks (i. e. delays), evidence from ongoing procurement con-tracts shows that there are many delays in making <b>investments.</b> Actually these <b>clauses</b> introduce the exibility to decide when it is optimal to invest and consequently increase the contracts value for the contractor. There-fore if the contracting authority underestimates penalty/premium fees, these may be totally ine¤ective in avoiding construction risks. In this paper we speci 8 ̆ 5 cally investigate the e¤ects that penalty/premium clauses have on both contract value and reduction of delay. We also focus on the design of optimal penalty/premium rules...|$|R
40|$|This article {{presents}} the difficulties {{associated with the}} implementation of the regulatory goal of promoting investment and innovation within the area of sector specific regulation in telecoms. The encouragement of efficient investment {{is one of the major}} goals reflected in the EC and domestic legal rules on telecoms access as well as price- and rate of return regulation. The law and the interplay of the interests of incumbents and alternative operators create a fertile soil for the emergence of various regulatory concepts of stimulating investment and facility-based competition. Considered here are the concepts most frequently referred to in this context including: the notion of new and emerging markets, the ladder of <b>investment</b> theory, sunset <b>clauses</b> and dynamic pricing policies. However, most of these concepts had little influence on regulatory practice so far, seeing as telecoms regulation is mostly directed at service competition and effective utilisation of existing infrastructures. This fact is the result of national regulators balancing their various regulatory goals in the existing technical and economic environment of the sector. The approach of the Polish regulatory authority towards these concepts constitutes an example of this reality. The urgent need to establish a new policy for next generation networks and access, bringing new technologies and business models to the sector, will have to induce more recognition for some concepts presented in this article. ...|$|R
40|$|Investment in privatized {{utilities}} {{leads to}} a very particular form of political risk [...] the risk that regulatory conditions change and special taxes are imposed, all measures within the sovereign powers of the state. The normal forms of protection against political risk (<b>investment</b> insurance, stabilization <b>clauses,</b> international <b>investment</b> treaties and international arbitration clauses) have not yet {{caught up with the}} emergence of new forms of political risk. The 1997 UK windfall tax announced by the Chancellor of the Exchequer in that year 2 ̆ 7 s budget speech is a case in point. This issue is not limited purely to the contemporary UK situation, but illustrates a structural situation which can, and is likely to be repeated wherever utilities are privatized, regulated and exposed to special industry taxes. Such actions are usually undertaken by a new government composed of parties hitherto opposed to privatization, which will be able to combine its previous opposition, and the values therein articulated with the ever present need of governments for new revenue to finance its political popularity objectives. This paper surveys shortly the possible responses by international law, mainly principles and practice of international investment protection, to situations which have recently arisen in the world privatization laboratory (the UK) and situations which are likely to arise in the many countries which currently copy the UK privatization model, once new governments come to power. The UK situation is of particular interest since in the absence of constitutional, federal or judicial constraints the prevailing concept of parliamentary supremacy means that any legal recourse can only be had from external sources of law...|$|R
