5|$|Artabanes was a {{descendant}} of the royal Armenian Arsacid line, a branch of {{which at the time}} was recognized as autonomous local princes in the eastern <b>fringes</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Eastern Roman Empire. His father was named John, and he had a brother also named John.|$|E
5|$|Coal {{measures}} {{occur on}} the western and the eastern <b>fringes</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Peak District, and evidence of past workings can be found from Glossop down to The Roaches, and from Stocksbridge to Baslow. The Coal measures on the eastern <b>fringes</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Peak District form the South Yorkshire Coalfield while the Coal measures on the western fringes form the Lancashire Coalfield. Mining started in medieval times and was at its most productive in the 18th and early 19th centuries, in some cases continuing into the early 20th century. The earliest mining took place at and close to outcrops and miners eventually followed the seams deeper underground as the beds dipped beneath hillsides. At Goyt's Moss and Axe Edge, deep seams were worked and steam engines raised the coal and dewatered the mines. Coal from the eastern mines was used in lead smelting, and coal from the western mines for lime burning.|$|E

5|$|Situated on {{the western}} <b>fringes</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Pacific Ring of Fire, the Philippines {{experiences}} frequent seismic and volcanic activity. The Benham Plateau to the east in the Philippine Sea is an undersea region active in tectonic subduction. Around 20 earthquakes are registered daily, though most are too weak to be felt. The last major earthquake was the 1990 Luzon earthquake.|$|E
5|$|Extremely Severe Cyclonic Storm Nilofar was, at the time, the third-strongest cyclone in the Arabian Sea. In late October 2014, {{it reached}} peak maximum {{sustained}} winds estimated between 205km/h (125mph) and 215km/h (130mph). The India Meteorological Department (IMD) named it Nilofar; the name {{refers to the}} water lily, and was suggested by Pakistan. The western <b>fringes</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> storm caused flash flooding in northeastern Oman, killing four people.|$|E
5|$|Terraces {{of shops}} were {{built around the}} <b>fringes</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> estate, both to cater for the {{residents}} of Noel Park and for residents of the expanding suburb of Wood Green and the users of the adjacent railway station. The designs of the terraces varied, from short terraces of small shops {{on the edges of}} the less-visited eastern portions of the estate, to parades of large shops on Wood Green High Road near the railway station.|$|E

5|$|The 2004 Indian Ocean {{earthquake}} was an undersea, megathrust {{earthquake that}} occurred on 26 December 2004, with an epicentre off {{the west coast}} of Sumatra, Indonesia, triggering a series of devastating tsunamis along coastal <b>fringes</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Indian Ocean. Nagapattinam district was the most affected part of Tamil Nadu, accounting for 6,064 off the 8,009 casualties in the state. Sirkazhi remained mostly unaffected by the tsunami, but the groundwater quality deteriorated where aquifers were close to the water bodies. There was heavy salt water intrusion inland.|$|E
5|$|A {{new plan}} was {{put forward by}} West Sussex County Council in 1961. This {{proposed}} new neighbourhoods at Broadfield and Bewbush, both of which extended outside the administrative area of the then Urban District Council. Detailed plans were made for Broadfield in the late 1960s; by the early 1970s building work had begun. Further expansion at Bewbush was begun in 1974, although development there was slow. The two neighbourhoods were both larger than the original nine: together, their proposed population was 23,000. Work also {{took place in the}} area now known as Ifield West on the western <b>fringes</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> town.|$|E
5|$|As Emilia first {{approached}} the southwest coast of Mexico, officials issued {{a tropical storm}} watch from Manzanillo to Cabo Corrientes, Jalisco; the watch was discontinued 30hours after it was issued. The storm passed the region on July 22, and {{is believed to have}} produced tropical storm force wind gusts along the coastline. A ship recorded 40mph (65km/h) winds while Emilia was just off the coast. Further up the coast, in Mazatlán, strong waves from the storm caused beaches to close, while the outer <b>fringes</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> storm dropped 4.68inches (119mm) of precipitation. Inland, the interaction between Emilia and a tropical wave brought increased moisture and precipitation to southeastern and central Mexico.|$|E

5|$|Deptford borders {{the areas}} of Brockley and Lewisham to the south, New Cross {{to the west and}} Rotherhithe to the north west; Deptford Creek divides it from Greenwich to the east, and the River Thames {{separates}} the area from the Isle of Dogs to the north east; it is contained within the London SE8 post code area. The area referred to as North Deptford is {{the only part of the}} London Borough of Lewisham to front the Thames and is sandwiched between Rotherhithe and Greenwich. Much of this riverside estate is populated by the former Naval Dockyards, now known as Convoys Wharf, the Pepys Estate and some eastern <b>fringes</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> old Surrey Commercial Docks.|$|E
5|$|Elgar's other {{compositions}} {{during the}} war included incidental music for a children's play, The Starlight Express (1915); a ballet, The Sanguine Fan (1917); and The Spirit of England (1915–17, to poems by Laurence Binyon), three choral settings very different in character from the romantic patriotism of his earlier years. His last large-scale composition of the war years was The <b>Fringes</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Fleet, settings of verses by Rudyard Kipling, performed with great popular success around the country, until Kipling for unexplained reasons objected to their performance in theatres. Elgar conducted a recording of the work for the Gramophone Company.|$|E
5|$|Gustav {{had only}} {{effects on the}} Lesser Antilles. Large swells, light rain, and gusty winds were {{reported}} along the outer <b>fringes</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> hurricane. On August30, the Egyptian motorship Raseltin encountered rough seas in relation to Gustav, and the hull of the ship was damaged. The remnants of Gustav severely impacted a seismic research operation {{off the coast of}} the United Kingdom which took place between August25 and September12. The purpose of the operation was to collect seismic reflection profiles of the Rockfall Plateau. On September3, the members of the team had to quickly retrieve all buoys that were deployed to avoid damage to the sensors. However, some of the research tools were damaged before they were recovered. In all, the storm delayed the project by two days.|$|E

5|$|In 1874, Menage {{returned}} to Minneapolis {{and entered the}} real estate business with partner H. C. Brackett. Menage gradually built an empire by purchasing farmland at the <b>fringes</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> city, platting and developing the property into residential neighborhoods, then financing the mortgages for people to purchase the homes. He also worked with Thomas Lowry, head of the city's streetcar system, to ensure that new lines were built to serve the outlying areas he was developing. Much of the present day Prospect Park neighborhood, and the areas surrounding Lake Harriet and Lake Calhoun, were developed by Menage and his companies.|$|E
5|$|In {{southern}} Africa, {{birds of}} both the European subspecies P. d. domesticus and the Indian subspecies P. d. indicus were introduced around 1900. Birds of P. d. domesticus ancestry are confined to a few towns, while P. d. indicus birds have spread rapidly, reaching Tanzania in the 1980s. Despite this success, native relatives such as the Cape sparrow also occur in towns, competing successfully with it. In South America, it was first introduced near Buenos Aires around 1870, and quickly became common {{in most of the}} southern part of the continent. It now occurs almost continuously from Tierra del Fuego to the <b>fringes</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Amazon basin, with isolated populations as far north as coastal Venezuela.|$|E
5|$|Jane Austen lived {{her entire}} life {{as part of a}} large and close-knit family on the lower <b>fringes</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> English gentry. Her family's steadfast support was {{critical}} to Austen's development as a professional writer. Austen read draft versions of all of her novels to her family, receiving feedback and encouragement, and it was her father who sent out her first publication bid. Austen's artistic apprenticeship lasted from her teenage years until she was about thirty-five. During this period, she experimented with various literary forms, including the epistolary novel which she tried and then abandoned, and wrote and extensively revised three major novels and began a fourth. With the release of Sense and Sensibility (1811), Pride and Prejudice (1813), Mansfield Park (1814) and Emma (1815), she achieved success as a published writer.|$|E

The Life in a Lens Museum of Photography & Old Times in Matlock Bath presents the history of photography from 1839. Other attractions on the <b>fringes</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> region include the theme parks at Alton Towers and Gulliver's Kingdom, and the Peak Wildlife Park.|$|E
5|$|They were an {{essential}} part of traditional Tahitian society. Dog teeth were fashioned into fishhooks and dog bones were made into weapons and implements. They also used dog hair, especially the long tail hairs of the Tuamotuan varieties of dogs, to decorate the <b>fringes</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> taumi – a traditional breast ornament often called a gorget – which were worn by priests and high chiefs. The Tuamotuan breed were described as similar to their Tahitian counterparts distinguishable by their longer hair. Historian Margaret Titcomb noted that Tuamotuan varieties may not have been a separate breed that developed in isolation, arguing that the people of the Tuamotus could have eaten their short hair varieties and kept their longer haired dogs for exports to the Society Islands.|$|E
5|$|Tropical Storm Chris was {{the fourth}} {{tropical}} storm of the 2006 Atlantic hurricane season. Forming on July 31 in the Atlantic Ocean east of the Leeward Islands from a tropical wave, Chris moved generally to the west-northwest, skirting the northern <b>fringes</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Caribbean islands. Chris was a relatively short-lived storm, reaching a peak intensity with winds at 65mph (100km/h) on August 2, while positioned north of St. Martin. The storm gradually weakened before finally dissipating on August 5, near eastern Cuba. Overall impact was minimal, amounting to moderate amounts of rainfall throughout its path. No deaths were reported.|$|E
