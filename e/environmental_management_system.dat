25|$|After {{the strong}} {{rejection}} of the Suroît project and its subsequent cancellation in November 2004, Hydro-Québec, {{under the leadership of}} its new CEO Thierry Vandal, reaffirmed Hydro-Québec's commitment towards energy efficiency, hydropower and development of alternative energy. Since then, Hydro-Québec regularly stresses three criteria for any new hydroelectric development undertaken by the company: projects must be cost effective, environmentally acceptable and well received by the communities. Hydro-Québec has also taken part in a series of sustainable development initiatives since the late 1980s. Its approach is based on three principles: economic development, social development and environmental protection. Since 2007 the company adheres to the Global Reporting Initiative, which governs the collection and publication of sustainability performance information. The company employs 250 professionals and managers in the environmental field and has implemented an ISO 14001-certified <b>environmental</b> <b>management</b> <b>system.</b>|$|E

40|$|To check rapidly deteriorating <b>environmental</b> conditions, many <b>management</b> {{tools are}} being used by {{different}} industries. In order to address environmental issues the corporate sector has seen a drastic increase {{in the use of}} <b>environmental</b> <b>management</b> <b>systems.</b> There is strong need to check how these <b>environmental</b> <b>management</b> <b>systems</b> are rendering <b>environmental</b> <b>management</b> services. Research shows that <b>environmental</b> <b>management</b> <b>systems</b> are mistakenly expected to prescribe technical and environmental objectives. Without describing what goals an organization must achieve, they lay out a <b>system</b> for <b>management</b> of numerous <b>environmental</b> obligations. Hence <b>environmental</b> <b>management</b> <b>systems</b> are not strategic; they tend to reactively fix issues contingent upon their occurrence and may miss opportunities to avoid problems before they occur. Further, <b>environmental</b> <b>management</b> itself is seen in isolation of a socio-ecological context, which makes <b>environmental</b> <b>management</b> lose ground and operate in a virtual vacuum. Mostly <b>environmental</b> <b>management</b> is identified as an ’agenda’ which runs counter to the overall development of an organization. Provided, <b>environmental</b> <b>management</b> <b>systems</b> can be integrated with basic principles of sustainable development these <b>management</b> <b>systems</b> can be utilized as a launching pad to move organizations towards sustainability. Built to render the administrative services only through a mechanism of self regulation and continuous improvement, these <b>management</b> <b>systems</b> can be used to deliver sustainable product planning. The present study illustrates the possibilities for integration of sustainability objectives into <b>environmental</b> <b>management</b> <b>systems.</b> In our effort to integrate sustainability in environment <b>management</b> <b>systems</b> extensive literature reviews, interviews and a case study (Hammarplast AB) have been used. For the analysis of the current reality, a framework for strategic sustainable development and methods incorporating “backcasting from principles of sustainability” – i. e. templates for sustainable product development and strategic life cycle management – has been used. The use of tools not only illustrates contemporary sustainability gaps but also gives a concrete set of guidance to integrate sustainability in <b>environmental</b> <b>management</b> <b>systems...</b>|$|R

25|$|In September 1999, one of BP's US subsidiaries, BP Exploration Alaska (BPXA), {{pleaded guilty}} to {{criminal}} charges stemming from its illegally dumping of hazardous wastes on the Alaska North Slope, paying fines and penalties totaling $22million. BP paid the maximum $500,000 in criminal fines, $6.5million in civil penalties, and established a $15million <b>environmental</b> <b>management</b> <b>system</b> at all of BP facilities in the US and Gulf of Mexico that are engaged in oil exploration, drilling or production. The charges stemmed from the 1993 to 1995 dumping of hazardous wastes on Endicott Island, Alaska by BP's contractor Doyon Drilling. The firm illegally discharged waste oil, paint thinner and other toxic and hazardous substances by injecting them down the outer rim, or annuli, of the oil wells. BPXA failed to report the illegal injections when it learned of the conduct, {{in violation of the}} Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act.|$|E
