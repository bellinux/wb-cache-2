The benefits of VFD-based FCAs have not been realized with commercially available Voltage Source Converter (VSC) based VSDs because added filter components, power conditioning and environmental mitigation required for shipboard compatibility increase the size to six times the conventional motor controller based solution. This paper presents a 3. 75 horsepower VSD/PM motor based FCA system having sufficient compactness to fit within the space allocated for the motor and fan in a typical FCA system of this size. A significant power density is achieved in the VSD by using Current Source Converter (CSC) based interface as the front end interface to the 440 V distribution system.

40|$|A dynamically-controlled power-gated (DCPG) FPGA ar-chitecture has {{recently}} been proposed to reduce static en-ergy dissipation during idle periods. During a power mode transition from an off state to on state, the wakeup current drawn from power supplies causes a voltage droop on the power distribution network of a device. If not handled ap-propriately, this current and the associated voltage droop could cause malfunction of the design and/or the device. In DCPG FPGAs, the amount of wakeup current is not known beforehand as the structures of power-gated modules are ap-plication dependent; thus, a configurable solution is required to handle wakeup current. In this {{paper we propose a}} pro-grammable wakeup architecture for DCPG FPGAs. The proposed solution has two levels: a fixed intra-region level and a configurable inter-region level. The architecture en-sures that a power-gated module can be turned on such that the wakeup current constraints are not violated. We study the area and power overheads of the proposed solution. Our results show that the area overhead of the proposed <b>inrush</b> current <b>limiting</b> architecture is less than 2 % for a power gating region of size 3 x 3 or 4 x 4 tiles, and the leakage power saved is more than 85 % in a region of size 4 x 4 tiles...|$|R

The original application note focused on designing systems with no single point failures using Actel Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) for critical applications. Included in that note were the basic principles of operation of the Actel FPGA and a discussion of potential single-point failures. The note also discussed the issue of startup transients for that class of device. It is unfortunate that we continue to see some design problems using these devices. This note will focus on the startup properties of certain electronic components, in general, and current Actel FPGAs, in particular. Devices that are "power-on friendly" are currently being developed by Actel, as a variant of the new SX series of FPGAs. In the ideal world, electronic components would behave much differently than they do in the real world, The chain, of course, starts with the power supply.

40|$|The Green Village {{envisions a}} sustainable, energy autarkic {{environment}} realized {{at the heart}} of the TU Delft campus. This environment will implement a DC electricity infrastructure with the main voltage level inside the buildings, being 380 V. This innovative power system requires the development of new power electronics that can be used to such a grid and contribute to its high performance and reliability. The first test container is meant for testing this electricity system and the relative equipment. This project proposes a buck conversion method with <b>inrush</b> current <b>limiting</b> circuit designed for connecting the test container’s energy consumers to the 380 V DC main bus, in order to achieve optimum operation, in terms of near peak efficiency and safety. Within the framework of this study, the “Femtogrid” system, which is the electricity system used by the test container, is explained and simulated. Additionally, the operation of the buck (step-down) converter and the boost (step-up) converter, that are the main elements of “Femtogrid” system, are studied and their control methods are analyzed. Moreover, some common electronic devices are tested with DC and AC input voltage, revealing important information regarding their behavior in normal and standby mode. An even better performance of some devices when running on DC is observed. The experiments showed high inrush currents due to the charging of the input capacitors during turn-on. Therefore, an inrush current limiter (ICL) is necessary in order to protect the system components from damage. The buck converter topology proposed in this project is the LLC resonant buck converter topology, which holds features like very high efficiency, isolation and small number of components. The ICL consists of a MOSFET in combination with some passive elements that can drive the MOSFET in such a way that the inrush current of the circuit can be limited by controlling the gate charge characteristic of the MOSFET.

40|$|The {{research}} {{presented in}} this dissertation {{is focused on the}} designof a high performance Low Dropout Regulator (LDO) which targetedfor low-power and low-voltage electronic appliances. Recently, with the increase in power consumption of portable electronicappliances, low power and high performance LDO is required. High accuracy of output voltage, high speed response and low noisehave become the main keywords for the researchers. To meet theabove mentioned requirements, several advanced techniques are proposedand {{presented in this}} dissertation to design a high performanceLDO with fast load transient response, high power supply rejectionratio, small inrush current, good load Regulation and precise overcurrent protection. Firstly, a Quick Response Circuit has been proposed to achieve fastload transient response when load current abruptly changes. The circuithas been achieved through properly charging and discharging thegate capacitor of power MOSFET. Secondly, a Bulk-Gate Control Circuithas been proposed to realize the high power supply rejection ratio(PSRR). The circuit has been achieved through controlling the bulkgateof input transistor of error amplifier. Thirdly, in order to keepthe LDO output voltage drop due to bonding wire, the CompensatedCircuit has been proposed. It works to adjust the feedback voltage offeedback network. Fourthly, an Auto <b>Inrush</b> Current <b>Limiting</b> Circuithas also been proposed to restrain the inrush current of output capacitorto make sure that the malfunction of the application system dueto inrush current is avoided. Not only the small inrush current butalso the high speed start up of LDO has been achieved. Fifthly, anOver Current Protection Circuit which is necessary to protect LDOfrom the damage happened by over load current or output shortening,is proposed. The proposed protection circuit has high accurate limitingcurrent and stable holding current without getting effects fromlatchup. The high performance LDO with proposed Quick Response Circuit,Bulk-Gate Control Circuit, Compensated Circuit was fabricated with 0. 18 m CMOS technology while the LDO with proposed Over CurrentProtection Circuit was fabricated with 0. 35 m CMOS technology. Forthe proposed Auto <b>Inrush</b> Current <b>Limiting</b> Circuit, the implementedchip is now being fabricated. The experimental results of the fabricated chips show that the outputundershoot and overshoot of load transient response are only 116 mV and 104 mV for 4. 7 F output capacitor and ILOAD= 0. 1 mA() 150 mA. Also, the PSRR performance is up to 75 dB for 10 Hz andremaining high 61. 8 dB for 1 KHz ripple frequency for VOUT = 1 : 2 Vand ILOAD = 50 mA. The output voltage drop is restrained to lessthan 1 % even when the load current reaches 150 mA. The quiescentcurrent of the whole chip is 8. 5 A for no load and 35 A for full loadcurrent. Meanwhile, the LDO with proposed Over Current ProtectionCircuit has a high accurate limiting current of 200 mA and a stableholding current of 17. 8 mA. It can digitally shut down the output ofLDO, thus, the latchup effect is avoided. From the simulation results, the LDO with Auto Inrush Current LimitingCircuit can achieve a very small inrush current of 144. 1 mA andfast start up time of 127. 7 s for 10 F output capacitor. With all the proposed and developed circuits applied, an LDO withextremely low-power consumption, low-operation-voltage but excellentcharacteristics can be achieved. In recent year, with the rapid development of system-on-chip designs,there is a growing trend toward power-management integration. Thelocal LDO which are utilized to power up sub-blocks of a system individuallymust be the On-chip. However, the external capacitors ofLDO have the equivalent series resistance (ESR) and they can adverselyaffect the stability of the regulator. In addition, these capacitorsand their external pins required to mount, increase the surfacearea (space) which will result in the increasing of high cost for massproduction. Hence, the design of a low-voltage high-stability and fasttransientLDO with, preferably, capacitor-free operation has becomeone of the main topic in our future works. Moreover, for present LDO,the Power MOSFET occupies the majority of the chip area. With theadvance CMOS technology scaling, the driving ability of Power MOSFETat the same size improves compared with the past. Concretely,with the scaling of CMOS technology, the leak current will remarkablyflow in the circuit. Hence, the research on a design of an LDOwhich can correspond to such the Power MOSFET is the one of themost important task to be done. 電気通信大学 200...|$|R
40|$|TutorialA major U. S. {{pipeline}} {{company was}} experiencing multiple problems at a crude pipeline intermediate pump station: Pipeline pumps were rated for 3500 to 7000 bph on 20 cSt crude (original design); Reliability and {{mean time between}} repair (MTBR) problems on existing centrifugal pumps because of operating at about 600 bph; Viscosities ranging from 1500 cSt to 5000 cSt (versus original design); The installed pumps also were under a power company restriction of 500 hp maximum (because of <b>inrush</b> current <b>limit</b> at starting conditions); The required flow rates varied from about 425 bph to 800 bph; Because of viscosity correction the centrifugal pump efficiency varied from about 10 to 20 percent when MTBR allowed the pumps installed to run; Pressure management on the pipeline system was not evenly distributed between the stations. The application seemed ideal for a rotary positive displacement (PD) pump. However, there was an additional complication/concern because only a few company personnel had experience with operating positive displacements pumps in series on a ?tight-line? operation. The pipeline company?s personnel worked with vendors to select a probable pump. The selected vendor provided several pipeline companies as reference examples of running rotary PD pumps in series across a pipeline system. After observing firsthand the operation of a pipeline system in Canada, the company then used computer simulations to model the hydraulic responses of the pump, controls and pipeline system. Ther computer simulations convinced management that rotary PD pumps would indeed function properly and safely in series with reciprocating PD pumps that were located at the originating pipeline stations (upstream in the system). Additional items that were addressed {{as a part of}} the redesign of the station were: Equipment vibration level reduction; Flow-rate flexibility and control system upgrades for the system and redesigned station; Electrical distribution stability for the station. Once installed, the rotary PD pumps provided improved MTBR, better pressure management, and more cost effective operation of the pipeline system in question. The throughput increase averaged 39 percent even though the increased power cost was only 9 percent. The tutorial will show examples of: Operating data showing system flow before and after station redesign; Rotating equipment installation improvements using before and after photos; Operating data showing pressure management improvements; Station operating costs before and after and cost per barrel improvements; Pump testing and inspection to ensure minimal startup issues...|$|R
