5|$|The <b>ecological</b> <b>footprint</b> of Croatia's {{population}} and industry varies significantly between the country's regions since 50% {{of the population}} resides in 26.8% of the nation's territory, with a particularly high impact made {{by the city of}} Zagreb and Zagreb County areas—their combined area comprises 6.6% of Croatia's territory while encompassing 25% of the population. The <b>ecological</b> <b>footprint</b> is most notably from the increased development of settlements and the sea coast leading to habitat fragmentation. Between 1998 and 2008, the greatest changes of land use pertained to artificially developed areas, but the scale of development is negligible compared to EU member states.|$|E
5|$|According to {{the data}} that member {{countries}} represented to the United Nations, Cuba was the only {{nation in the world}} in 2006 that met the World Wide Fund for Nature's definition of sustainable development, with an <b>ecological</b> <b>footprint</b> of less than 1.8 hectares per capita, 1.5, and a Human Development Index of over 0.8, 0.855.|$|E
5|$|The <b>Ecological</b> <b>footprint</b> {{measures}} {{human consumption}} {{in terms of}} the biologically productive land needed to provide the resources, and absorb the wastes of the average global citizen. In 2008 it required 2.7 global hectares per person, 30% more than the natural biological capacity of 2.1 global hectares (assuming no provision for other organisms). The resulting ecological deficit must be met from unsustainable extra sources and these are obtained in three ways: embedded in the goods and services of world trade; taken from the past (e.g. fossil fuels); or borrowed from the future as unsustainable resource usage (e.g. by over exploiting forests and fisheries).|$|E
40|$|Local {{environmental}} action plans are integral documents that enable more efﬁ cient planning and solving of environmental problems. <b>Ecological</b> <b>footprints</b> can represent the {{important part of}} geographical concepts for {{the preparation of the}} local {{environmental action}} plan. The calculation of <b>ecological</b> <b>footprints</b> has shown that at the moment, Ormož municipality does not follow the sustainable development.

5|$|To promote sustainability, {{the site}} was {{selected}} directly adjacent to an already used part of a major ski area. It was also designed to minimize vegetation and the <b>ecological</b> <b>footprint</b> in the area. For energy efficiency, trees were retained to cast shade with weather protection and a shading system used to cover parts of the track. The track itself is painted white to maintain low temperatures while minimizing energy demand on the refrigeration system. Waste heat from the refrigeration plant is captured and reused to heat buildings on-site, and could provide other heat uses in the future. Any wood waste created from site clearing activities during venue construction was composted for reuse. Other on-site buildings also followed similar green building design principles.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 1990s Castro embraced environmentalism, campaigning against {{global warming and}} the waste of natural resources, and accusing the U.S. of being the world's primary polluter. In 1994 a {{ministry}} dedicated to the environment was established, and new laws established in 1997 that promoted awareness of environmental issues throughout Cuba and stressed the sustainable use of natural resources. By 2006, Cuba was the world's only nation which met the United Nations Development Programme's definition of sustainable development, with an <b>ecological</b> <b>footprint</b> of less than 1.8 hectares per capita and a Human Development Index of over 0.8. Castro also became a proponent of the anti-globalization movement, criticizing U.S. global hegemony and the control exerted by multinationals. Castro maintained his devout anti-apartheid beliefs, and at the July 26 celebrations in 1991, he was joined onstage by the South African political activist Nelson Mandela, recently released from prison. Mandela praised Cuba's involvement in battling South Africa in Angola and thanked Castro personally. He later attended Mandela's inauguration as President of South Africa in 1994. In 2001 he attended the Conference Against Racism in South Africa at which he lectured on the global spread of racial stereotypes through U.S. film.|$|E

40|$|Richer {{societies}} have larger <b>ecological</b> <b>footprints</b> {{and are more}} inclined toward environmental protection. But this is an incomplete story as long as climatic temperature is left out of consideration. Our 116 -nation study shows that all countries, but especially richer countries, have larger <b>ecological</b> <b>footprints</b> under more demanding thermal climates. Also, business executives’ ratings of environmental regulations and practices are lowest in poor countries with demanding thermal climates (Armenia, Mongolia), moderate in poor and rich countries with undemanding climates (Mauritius, Nigeria), and highest in rich countries with demanding thermal climates (Canada, Finland). The same holds for efforts to respond to “green” consumer demands. Thus under harsher thermal climates, environmental protection is stronger in richer societies with larger <b>ecological</b> <b>footprints</b> but weaker in poorer societies with larger <b>ecological</b> <b>footprints.</b> Explanations are sought in livability appraisals and behavioral adaptations to climato-economic environments. Some speculation is offered about the future management of national ecosystems...|$|R

25|$|One of the {{striking}} conclusions {{to emerge from}} <b>ecological</b> <b>footprint</b> accounting {{is that it would}} be necessary to have 4 or 5 back-up planets engaged in nothing but agriculture for all those alive today to live a western lifestyle.

25|$|<b>Ecological</b> <b>footprint</b> accounting, {{based on}} the {{biological}} concept of carrying capacity, tracks the amount of land and water area a human population, needed to produce the resources the population consumes and to absorb its waste, under prevailing technology. This amount then is compared to available biocapacity, in the world or in that region. The biocapacity represents the area able to regenerate resources and assimilate waste. Global Footprint Network publishes every year results for all nations captured in UN statistics.|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to compare the carbon emissions produced as a result of product consumption by the residents of an Irish city-region, that is Limerick City and its environs. The resulting carbon footprints are used to compare imports of food items, manufactured products and construction materials with domestic production as well as changes between 1996 and 2002. The total <b>ecological</b> <b>footprints</b> (EF) associated with product consumption are also calculated by aggregating the theoretical land required to sequester carbon emissions and the terrestrial land area appropriated for agricultural production and industrial activity. It is suggested that this approach be used to allocate producer or consumer responsibility for environmental impacts from trade. globalisation, trade, embodied energy, <b>ecological</b> <b>footprinting,...</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{complexity}} of the sustainable-development policy goal is such that policy makers are searching for tools {{to enable them to}} evaluate and develop policy directions. To date, <b>ecological</b> <b>footprinting</b> has been used mainly for raising awareness of environmental impacts but it also has considerable potential as a policy tool, enabling policy makers in their strategic work. The paper presents an application of a specific <b>ecological</b> <b>footprinting</b> development, the REAP (Resource and Energy Analysis Programme) tool, to a current policy issue, the promotion of sustainable construction. Using the London Plan of the Greater London Authority as a case study, it considers {{the strengths and weaknesses of}} this approach and how it can contribute to policy development. ...|$|R
25|$|The {{environmental}} sustainability problem has proven difficult to solve. The modern environmental movement {{has attempted to}} solve the problem in a large variety of ways. But little progress has been made, as shown by severe <b>ecological</b> <b>footprint</b> overshoot and lack of sufficient progress on the climate change problem. Something within the human system in preventing change to a sustainable mode of behavior. That system trait is systemic change resistance. Change resistance is also known as organizational resistance, barriers to change, or policy resistance.|$|E
25|$|Ecological {{economics}} now {{seeks to}} bridge the gap between ecology and traditional neoclassical economics: it provides an inclusive and ethical economic model for society. A plethora of new concepts to help implement and measure sustainability are becoming more widely accepted including the car-free movement, smart growth (more sustainable urban environments), life cycle assessment (the cradle to cradle analysis of resource use and environmental impact over the life cycle of a product or process), <b>ecological</b> <b>footprint</b> analysis, green building, dematerialization (increased recycling of materials), decarbonisation (removing dependence on fossil fuels) and much more.|$|E
25|$|One {{approach}} {{to address the}} problem of waste PVC is also through the process called Vinyloop. It is a mechanical recycling process using a solvent to separate PVC from other materials. This solvent turns in a closed loop process in which the solvent is recycled. Recycled PVC is used in place of virgin PVC in various applications: coatings for swimming pools, shoe soles, hoses, diaphragms tunnel, coated fabrics, PVC sheets. This recycled PVC's primary energy demand is 46 percent lower than conventional produced PVC. So the use of recycled material leads to a significant better <b>ecological</b> <b>footprint.</b> The global warming potential is 39 percent lower.|$|E

40|$|Human {{security}} is usually framed as a multidimensional concept {{that depends on}} socio-political, economic, health-related, and ecological ‘pillars’. An assessment of human security requires {{an analysis of the}} nested relationships between those variables. Focusing on South-East Asian coun-tries we illustrate how those relationships can be used to prioritise determinants of human security. Such priorities are important because policies directed at promoting human security require defi nite starting points and targets. What emerges is a collage of nested systems in which global and region-al environmental patterns exert the dominant infl uence. We assess the long-term human security prospects of South-East Asian countries by comparing their <b>ecological</b> <b>footprints.</b> South-East Asia’s major ecosystems have not yet been overly incapacitated by the impact of its human populations. Human security policies could be much improved by addressing the growing inequities in <b>ecological</b> <b>footprints</b> and by public education campaigns on the signifi cance of ecosystem health...|$|R
25|$|According to the UNDP, in 2010 {{the life}} {{expectancy}} at birth for Costa Ricans was 79.3 years. The Nicoya Peninsula {{is considered one of}} the Blue Zones in the world, where people commonly live active lives past the age of 100 years. The New Economics Foundation (NEF) ranked Costa Rica first in its 2009 Happy Planet Index, and once again in 2012. The index measures the health and happiness they produce per unit of environmental input. According to NEF, Costa Rica's lead is due to its very high life expectancy which is second highest in the Americas, and higher than the United States. The country also experienced well-being higher than many richer nations and a per capita <b>ecological</b> <b>footprint</b> one-third the size of the United States.|$|E
25|$|A {{large and}} still {{growing number of}} {{attempts}} to create aggregate measures of various aspects of sustainability created a stable of indices that provide a more nuanced perspective on development than economic aggregates such as GDP. Some {{of the most prominent}} of these include the Human Development Index (HDI) of the United Nations Development Programme(UNDP); the <b>Ecological</b> <b>footprint</b> of Global Footprint Network and its partner organizations; the Environmental Sustainability Index(ESI) and the pilot Environmental Performance Index(EPI) reported under the World Economic Forum(WEF); or the Genuine Progress Index(GPI) calculated at the national or sub-national level. Parallel to these initiatives, political interest in producing a green GDP that would take at least the cost of pollution and natural capital depletion into account has grown, even if implementation is held back by the reluctance of policymakers and statistical services arising mostly from a concern about conceptual and technical challenges.|$|E
25|$|Edible insects {{have long}} been used by ethnic groups in Asia, Africa, Mexico and South America as cheap and {{sustainable}} sources of protein, and the major role of entomophagy in human food security is well-documented. Up to 2,086 species are eaten by 3,071 ethnic groups in 130 countries. While more attention is needed to fully assess the potential of edible insects, they provide a natural source of essential carbohydrates, proteins, fats, minerals and vitamins and offer an opportunity {{to bridge the gap}} in protein consumption between poor and wealthy nations but also to lessen the <b>Ecological</b> <b>footprint.</b> Many insects contain abundant stores of lysine, an amino acid deficient in the diets of many people who depend heavily on grain. Some argue that the combination of increasing land use pressure, climate change, and food grain shortages due to the use of corn as a biofuel feedstock will cause serious challenges for attempts to meet future protein demand.|$|E
40|$|Following the admonition to "think globally, act locally" {{has proven}} difficult. Discussions of {{sustainability}} often remain {{at a local}} level without addressing global sustainability and yet the need for local engagement is well demonstrated. Using the case of Montreal's West Island, two environmental information tools were created and then evaluated on their ease of development, ability to be publicly engaging and ability to link the local and global scales. The first tool was a GIS visualization of sub-municipal <b>ecological</b> <b>footprints</b> and the second was a more conventional GIS 'atlas'. Focus groups were {{used to test the}} two tools. The atlas tool was considerably easier to create, and both tools succeeded in engaging participants.
