2500|$|Journalist Martin Bashir {{interview}}ed Diana for the BBC {{current affairs}} show Panorama. [...] The interview was broadcast on 20 November 1995. In reference to {{her relationship with}} Hewitt, the Princess said to Bashir, [...] "Yes, I adored him. Yes, I {{was in love with}} him. But I was very let down [...]" [...] Referring to her husband's affair with Camilla Parker Bowles, she said, [...] "Well, there were three of us in this marriage, so it was a bit crowded." [...] Of herself, she said, [...] "I'd like to be a queen of people's hearts." [...] On the Prince's suitability for kingship, she stated, [...] "Because I know the character <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> the top job, as I call it, would bring enormous limitations to him, and I don't know whether he could adapt to that." ...|$|E
2500|$|Sultan Hamid {{apparently}} {{considered the}} under evaluation presented to him of 900,000 as exaggeration. The German {{chief of staff}} of the Ottoman Third Army, Colonel Felix Guse, complained that [...] "The Turks knew only poorly their country, on top of that the possibility of getting reliable statistical figures was out of the question. Fa'iz El-Ghusein, the Kaimakam of Kharpout, wrote in his book, that according to the Ottoman official statistics there were about 1.9 million Armenian's in the Ottoman Empire. Another indication that other statistics might have existed is that Polybius in his book published in 1919, refer to a said “Ottoman Official Census of 1910.” The Turkish historian Dr. Secil Akgun, claimed: “The Ottomans do not have a definite number. That is, we have in our hands contradictory numbers regarding the Armenian population within the borders of the Ottoman Empire. <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> Basmacıyan gives the most accurate number. This is to be between two and three million.” ...|$|E
2500|$|Obama's fellow Illinois Democrats praised {{him after}} the speech. [...] Illinois Speaker of the House Michael Madigan reacted by saying, [...] "He is a star...For Barack, the sky's the limit," [...] while Chicago Mayor Richard M. Daley said, [...] "He hit a grand slam home run." [...] Senate President Emil Jones responded, [...] "It was such a moving speech that I had tears in my eyes...It was electrifying. When I looked around the room, all across the people were so emotional, tears in their eyes. They're crying. A great individual, a great Illinoisan." [...] Governor Rod Blagojevich stated, [...] "After the speech last night, <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> {{even if he had}} an opponent, he might get 100 percent of the vote." [...] Former Illinois Senator Carol Moseley Braun said, [...] "Obama {{represents}} the best of what we brought from our generation...he represents a kind of division within the Democratic Party. It's not the old left." ...|$|E
5000|$|Smith: <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>think</b> from <b>that</b> mimeographed {{list that}} the Library of Congress issued around 1937 , [...] "American Folksongs on Commercially Available Records" [...] Shortly after that, two Carter Family recordings, [...] "Worried Man Blues" [...] and [...] "East Virginia Blues" [...] were reissued {{on the album}} Smoky Mountain Ballads. That album would come to stores that wouldn’t ordinarily have Carter Family records.|$|R

"I {{am sorry}} to hear you give this as your opinion; for just at this moment, <b>I</b> <b>would</b> rather <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> have no cause of complaint, in this way, against the reigning family, or its ministers.

5000|$|When {{asked by}} Stephen Colbert in 2009 {{if there was}} a leader in the gay {{community}} on par with Martin Luther King, Fouratt said, [...] "Well, <b>I</b> <b>would</b> like to <b>think</b> <b>that</b> I'm that leader." ...|$|R
2500|$|Twenty-eight years later, in an {{appearance}} on MSNBC television, Falwell {{said he was not}} troubled by reports that the nominee for Chief Justice of the United States Supreme Court, John G. Roberts (whose appointment was confirmed by the U.S. Senate) had done volunteer legal work for homosexual rights activists on the case of Romer v. Evans. [...] Falwell told MSNBC's Tucker Carlson that if he were a lawyer, he too would argue for civil rights for LGBT people. [...] "I may not agree with the lifestyle, but {{that has nothing to do}} with the civil rights of that part of our constituency," [...] Falwell said. [...] When Carlson countered that conservatives [...] "are always arguing against 'special rights' for gays," [...] Falwell said that equal access to housing and employment are basic rights, not special rights. [...] "Civil rights for all Americans, black, white, red, yellow, the rich, poor, young, old, gay, straight, et cetera, is not a liberal or conservative value. [...] It's an American value that <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> we pretty much all agree on." ...|$|E

6000|$|Nostromo's {{voice was}} speaking, though he, at the tiller, was also {{as if he}} were not. [...] "Have you been asleep, Don Martin? Caramba! If it were {{possible}} <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> I, too, have dozed off. I have a strange notion somehow of having dreamt that there was a sound of blubbering, a sound a sorrowing man could make, somewhere near this boat. Something between a sigh and a sob." ...|$|E

60|$|And then, too, <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>think</b> of <b>that</b> {{other thing}} that Cavalcanti had said: that I had been hasty in my {{judgment}} of his daughter's mind. My hopes rose and tortured me with the suspense they held. Then came to me the awful thought that here {{there might be a}} measure of retribution, and that it might be intended as my punishment that Cosimo, whom I had unconsciously bested in my sinful passion, should best me now in this pure and holy love.|$|R
6000|$|... "Ah, I've done that," [...] {{said the}} girl, [...] "and I {{know how many}} comforts I could buy for the dear Major. Also I'd {{like to go to}} a girl's college, like Smith or Wellesley, and get a proper education. But not with your money, Aunt Jane. It would burn my fingers. Always <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> if you had not been hard and miserly this same money would have saved my mother's life. No! I loathe your money. Keep it or throw it to the dogs, if you won't give it to the boy it belongs to. But don't you dare to will your selfish hoard to me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Miserliness {{is rather}} a quality than otherwise, you know," [...] she continued, holding {{the cat in}} her folded arms. [...] "With us it is misers who can spare money for worthy objects--not the {{so-called}} generous natures. But pray don't think I am a sybarite. My father was a clerk in the Ministry of Finances with no position at all. You may guess by this that our home was far from luxurious, though of course we did not actually suffer from cold. I ran away from my parents, you know, directly I began to think by myself. It is not very easy, such thinking. One {{has got to be}} put in the way of it, awakened to the truth. I am indebted for my salvation to an old apple-woman, who had her stall under the gateway of the house we lived in. She had a kind wrinkled face, and the most friendly voice imaginable. One day, casually, we began to talk about a child, a ragged little girl we had seen begging from men in the streets at dusk; and from one thing to another my eyes began to open gradually to the horrors from which innocent people are made to suffer in this world, only in order that governments might exist. After I once understood the crime of the upper classes, I could not go on living with my parents. Not a single charitable word was to be heard in our home from year's end to year's end; there was nothing but the talk of vile office intrigues, and of promotion and of salaries, and of courting the favour of the chiefs. The mere idea of marrying one day such another man as my father made me shudder. I don't mean that there was anyone wanting to marry me. There was not the slightest prospect of anything of the kind. But was it not sin enough to live on a Government salary while half Russia was dying of hunger? The Ministry of Finances! What a grotesque horror it is! What does the starving, ignorant people want with a Ministry of Finances? I kissed my old folks on both cheeks, and went away from them to live in cellars, with the proletariat. I tried to make myself useful to the utterly hopeless. I suppose you understand what I mean? I mean the people who have nowhere to go and nothing to look forward to in this life. Do you understand how frightful that is--nothing to look forward to! Sometimes I think that it is only in Russia that there are such people and such a depth of misery can be reached. Well, I plunged into it, and--do you know--there isn't much that one can do in there. No, indeed--at least {{as long as there are}} Ministries of Finances and such like grotesque horrors to stand in the way. I suppose I would have gone mad there just trying to fight the vermin, if it had not been for a man. It was my old friend and teacher, the poor saintly apple-woman, who discovered him for me, quite accidentally. She came to fetch me late one evening in her quiet way. I followed her where she would lead; that part of my life was in her hands altogether, and without her my spirit would have perished miserably. The man was a young workman, a lithographer by trade, and he had got into trouble in connexion with that affair of temperance tracts--you remember. There was a lot of people put in prison for that. The Ministry of Finances again! What would become of it if the poor folk ceased making beasts of themselves with drink? Upon my word, <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> finances and all the rest of it are an invention of the devil; only that a belief in a supernatural source of evil is not necessary; men alone are quite capable of every wickedness. Finances indeed!" ...|$|E

5000|$|Jackson Lee {{is active}} on {{immigration}} issues. She has proposed increasing border security and increasing opportunities for legalization among {{those living in}} the United States.

5000|$|One of {{his reasons}} for leaving was that, first and foremost, writing a serial that aired {{five times a week}} proved to be too taxing.
