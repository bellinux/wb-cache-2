5|$|Despite the {{anomalous}} {{electron configuration}} for gaseous thorium atoms, metallic thorium shows significant 5f involvement. This was first realised in 1995, {{when it was}} pointed out that a hypothetical metallic state of thorium that had the 6d27s2 configuration with the 5f orbitals above the <b>Fermi</b> <b>level</b> should be hexagonal close packed like the group 4 elements titanium, zirconium, and hafnium, and not face-centred cubic as it actually is. The actual crystal structure can only be explained when the 5f states are invoked, proving that thorium, and not protactinium, acts as the first actinide metallurgically. The 5f character of thorium is also clear in the rare and highly unstable +3 oxidation state, in which thorium exhibits the electron configuration 5f1.|$|E
5|$|The {{scanning}} tunneling microscope is {{a device}} for viewing surfaces at the atomic level. It uses the quantum tunneling phenomenon, which allows particles to pass through a barrier that would normally be insurmountable. Electrons tunnel through the vacuum between two planar metal electrodes, on {{each of which is}} an adsorbed atom, providing a tunneling-current density that can be measured. Scanning one atom (taken as the tip) as it moves past the other (the sample) permits plotting of tip displacement versus lateral separation for a constant current. The calculation shows the extent to which scanning-tunneling-microscope images of an individual atom are visible. It confirms that for low bias, the microscope images the space-averaged dimensions of the electron orbitals across closely packed energy levels—the <b>Fermi</b> <b>level</b> local density of states.|$|E

Finally, we discuss the key factors relevant to understand device properties and power conversion efficiencies of the BHJ solar cells: recombination, charge generation, and the current–potential curve, based on the suggested model that emphasizes mobile electrons and holes (that we term quasifree carriers) contributing to the respective <b>Fermi</b> <b>levels...</b>|$|R

An upper limit of a solar cell s open circuit voltage is the splitting of the quasi <b>Fermi</b> <b>levels</b> under illumination. To determine this splitting, the band structure and the density of states of a superlattice of cubic silicon quantum dots is calculated. Furthermore, the absorption and the minority charge carrier lifetime of size controlled Si NCs in a silicon dioxide matrix are measured. From these data the excess carrier density under illumination with the AM 1. 5 G solar spectrum {{is estimated to be}} about 1016 cm amp; 8722; 3. Based on the density of states and the carrier concentration, the quasi <b>Fermi</b> <b>levels</b> are calculated. Superlattices of silicon nanocrystals in SiO 2, Si 3 N 4, and SiC are compared.

40|$|Abstract:- The maximum {{theoretical}} {{open circuit}} voltage of a solar cell is set by its builtin voltage. For amorphous silicon p-i-n cells, {{the position of the}} <b>Fermi</b> <b>levels</b> in the p-and n- contact regions are on the order of 0. 4 eV and 0. 2 eV from their respective band edges, limiting the built-in voltage to Eg- 0. 6 eV. We propose replacing the p- and n- regions by superlattices, in which the <b>Fermi</b> <b>levels</b> in the wide gap barrier regions are, on an absolute scale, closer to the valence band or conduction band edges of the low gap material (a-Si:H), than the values indicated above. In order for the p- and n-superlattices to yield a larger build-in voltage, the density of states in the doped wide band materials must be much greater at the <b>Fermi</b> <b>levels</b> than that of the undoped low band gap quantum wells. To accomplish this, the wide gap material must be heavily doped and have effective tails much wider than that of the undoped low band gap material. For the n-region superlattice the barrier must be in the conduction band, hence we propose a-Si 1 –xCx: H and a-Si:H: For the p-region superlattice the barrier must be in the valence band, and we propose a-Si 1 –yNy: H and a-Si:H...|$|R
