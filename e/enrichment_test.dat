40|$|Abstract Background Enrichment testing {{assesses the}} overall {{evidence}} of differential expression {{behavior of the}} elements within a defined set. When we have measured many molecular aspects, e. g. gene expression, metabolites, proteins, it is desirable to assess their differential tendencies jointly across platforms using an integrated set <b>enrichment</b> <b>test.</b> In this work we explore the properties of several methods for performing a combined <b>enrichment</b> <b>test</b> using gene expression and metabolomics as the motivating platforms. Results Using two simulation models we explored the properties of several enrichment methods including two novel methods: the logistic regression 2 -degree of freedom Wald test and the 2 -dimensional permutation p-value for the sum-of-squared statistics test. In relation to their univariate counterparts {{we find that the}} joint tests can improve our ability to detect results that are marginal univariately. We also find that joint tests improve the ranking of associated pathways compared to their univariate counterparts. However, there is a risk of Type I error inflation with some methods and self-contained methods lose specificity when the sets are not representative of underlying association. Conclusions In this work we show that consideration of data from multiple platforms, in conjunction with summarization via a priori pathway information, leads to increased power in detection of genomic associations with phenotypes. </p...|$|E
40|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that pathway analysis can complement single-SNP analysis in exploring genomewide association data. Pathway analysis incorporates the available biological knowledge of genes and SNPs and is expected to improve the chances of revealing the underlying genetic architecture of complex traits. Methods for pathway analysis can be classified as competitive (enrichment) or self-contained (association) according to the hypothesis tested. Although association tests are statistically more powerful than <b>enrichment</b> <b>tests</b> they can be difficult to calibrate because biases in analysis accumulate across multiple SNPs or genes. Furthermore, <b>enrichment</b> <b>tests</b> can be more scientifically relevant than association tests, as they detect pathways with relatively more evidence for association than the remaining genes. Here we show how some well known association tests can be simply adapted to <b>test</b> for <b>enrichment,</b> and compare their performance to some established <b>enrichment</b> <b>tests.</b> We propose versions of the Adaptive Rank Truncated Product (ARTP), Tail Strength Measure and Fisherâ€™s combination of p-values for <b>testing</b> the <b>enrichment</b> null hypothesis. We compare the behaviour of these proposed methods with the established Hypergeometric Test and Gene-Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA). The results of the simulation study show that the modified version of the ARTP method has generally the best performance across the situations considered.

We implement the p-value weighting on a prostate cancer metabolomic dataset. Gene expression on matched samples is used to construct the weights. Under certain regulatory conditions, the use of weighted p-values does not inflate the type I error above what we see for the un-weighted tests except in high correlation situations.

Although gene sets are defined a priori based on biological knowledge, current methods for gene set <b>enrichment</b> <b>testing</b> treat all genes equal. It is well-known that some genes, such as those responsible for housekeeping functions, appear in many pathways, whereas other genes are more specialized and play a unique role in a single pathway. Drawing inspiration {{from the field of}} information retrieval, we have developed and present here an approach to incorporate gene appearance frequency (in KEGG pathways) into two current methods, Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) and logistic regression-based LRpath framework, to generate more reproducible and biologically meaningful results. Results Two breast cancer microarray datasets were analyzed to identify gene sets differentially expressed between histological grade 1 and 3 breast cancer. The correlation of Normalized Enrichment Scores (NES) between gene sets, generated by the original GSEA and GSEA with the appearance frequency of genes incorporated (GSEA-AF), was compared. GSEA-AF resulted in higher correlation between experiments and more overlapping top gene sets. Several cancer related gene sets achieved higher NES in GSEA-AF as well. The same datasets were also analyzed by LRpath and LRpath with the appearance frequency of genes incorporated (LRpath-AF). Two well-studied lung cancer datasets were also analyzed in the same manner to demonstrate the validity of the method, and similar results were obtained. Conclusions We introduce an alternative way to integrate KEGG PATHWAY information into gene set <b>enrichment</b> <b>testing.</b> The performance of GSEA and LRpath can be enhanced with the integration of appearance frequency of genes.

40|$|Cancer {{research}} is embracing the multiple``-omics'' technologies available for global scale measurement of molecular events. Transcriptomics, {{as the global}} measure of gene expression, has been well developed through microarray technology. Metabolomics, an emerging omics field, involves chromatography-coupled mass spectrometry to measure the global activity of metabolites or small molecules. The aim of this dissertation is to integrate the analysis of these two data sources to enhance the ability to find molecular changes between two disease states. This work is motivated by a prostate cancer progression study in which tumor samples of varying stage and benign tissue were assessed for both gene expression and metabolomic levels. Using a pathway-directed approach, transcriptomics and metabolomics data can be mapped using publicly available metabolic pathways. Here we describe three integrative methods. In the first topic {{we begin with a}} classification method that utilizes a differential list of elements from a prior study to make prognostic or diagnostic predictions about samples in a current study. We extend the classification method by providing a testing scenario for the classifier. Though motivated by the integration of in vitro and in vivo gene expression datasets we show that it is applicable across omics platforms as well. The second topic explores the use of p-value weighting to improve the power of per-metabolite tests of differential intensity. We use gene-set <b>enrichment</b> <b>testing</b> to capture the gene expression information contained in pre-defined pathways. The results of these tests are used to devise pathway-based weights. In this way, metabolites that are involved in a pathway that is dysregulated in its gene expression are given higher importance. Finally, the third topic extends two univariate set <b>enrichment</b> <b>tests</b> to jointly search for sets of genes and metabolites that are coordinately differential. We compare these methods to their univariate counterparts and to <b>enrichment</b> <b>testing</b> on the concatenated datasets. In almost all scenarios explored, testing the datasets jointly is preferred.

40|$|Motivation: <b>Enrichment</b> <b>tests</b> {{are used}} in {{high-throughput}} experi-mentation to measure the association between gene or protein ex-pression and membership in groups or pathways. The Fisher Exact test is commonly used. We specifically examined the associations produced by the Fisher test between protein identification by mass spectrometry discovery proteomics, and their Gene Ontology (GO) term assignments in a large yeast dataset. We found that direct application of the Fisher test is misleading in proteomics due to the bias in mass spectrometry to preferentially identify proteins based on their biochemical properties. False inference about associations can be made if this bias is not corrected. Our method adjusts Fisher tests for these biases and produces associations more directly at-tributable to protein expression rather than experimental bias. Results: Using logistic regression we modeled the association be-tween protein identification and GO term assignments while adjust-ing for identification bias in mass spectrometry. The model accounts for five biochemical properties of peptides: 1) hydrophobicity, 2) molecular weight, 3) transfer energy, 4) beta turn frequency, and 5) isoelectric point. The model was fit on 181, 060 peptides from 2678 proteins identified in 24 yeast proteomics datasets with a 1 % false discovery rate. In analyzing the association between protein identi-fication and their GO term assignments we found that 25 % (134 out of 544) of Fisher tests that showed significant association (q-value < = 0. 05) were non-significant after adjustment using our model.

We propose here to evidence polygenic selection by detecting signals of adaptation at the pathway or gene set level instead of analyzing single independent genes. Using a gene-set <b>enrichment</b> <b>test</b> to identify genome-wide signals of adaptation among human populations, we find that most pathways globally enriched for signals of positive selection are either directly or indirectly involved in immune response.

A thorough literature search identified 547 candidate genes for obesity-susceptibility based on evidence from animal studies, Mendelian syndromes, linkage studies, genetic association studies and expression studies. Genomic regions were defined to include the genes Â± 10 kb of flanking sequence around candidate and non-candidate genes.

40|$|Abstract Background Identification of {{transcription}} factors (TFs) {{involved in}} a biological process {{is the first step}} towards {{a better understanding of the}} underlying regulatory mechanisms. However, due to the involvement of a large number of genes and complicated interactions in a gene regulatory network (GRN), identification of the TFs {{involved in a}} biology process remains to be very challenging. In reality, the recognition of TFs for a given a biological process can be further complicated by the fact that most eukaryotic genomes encode thousands of TFs, which are organized in gene families of various sizes and in many cases with poor sequence conservation except for small conserved domains. This poses a significant challenge for identification of the exact TFs involved or ranking the importance of a set of TFs to a process of interest. Therefore, new methods for recognizing novel TFs are desperately needed. Although a plethora of methods have been developed to infer regulatory genes using microarray data, it is still rare to find the methods that use existing knowledge base in particular the validated genes known to be involved in a process to bait/guide discovery of novel TFs. Such methods can replace the sometimes-arbitrary process of selection of candidate genes for experimental validation and significantly advance our knowledge and understanding of the regulation of a process. Results We developed an automated software package called TF-finder for recognizing TFs involved in a biological process using microarray data and existing knowledge base. TF-finder contains two components, adaptive sparse canonical correlation analysis (ASCCA) and <b>enrichment</b> <b>test,</b> for TF recognition. ASCCA uses positive target genes to bait TFS from gene expression data while <b>enrichment</b> <b>test</b> examines the presence of positive TFs in the outcomes from ASCCA. Using microarray data from salt and water stress experiments, we showed TF-finder is very efficient in recognizing many important TFs involved in salt and drought tolerance as evidenced by the rediscovery of those TFs that have been experimentally validated. The efficiency of TF-finder in recognizing novel TFs was further confirmed by a thorough comparison with a method called Intersection of Coexpression (ICE).

Existing tools that can handle for GPA on both mutational and gene expressional aspects are limited. This leads {{to the development of}} uGPA (unified Gene Pathway Analyzer). Methods: uGPA package provides a unified solution to knowledge base-driven competitive GPA that can analyze genome-wide screening data derived from multiple platforms (next generation sequencing or microarray) and sample sources (genomic or transcriptomic) on both mutational and gene expressional perspectives. It allows for a quick assessment of perspective outline of gene sets on the studied disease through <b>enrichment</b> <b>test</b> modeled by cumulative hypergeometric distribution and reports the gene components detected with events (mutation or differential gene expression) in the gene sets. Results: uGPA package has been successfully verified to be applicable on input data generated from NGS-based platforms (transcriptome sequencing and whole-exome sequencing). Genome-wide screening data from other platforms should also apply. Conclusions: uGPA package delivers a simple, flexible and platform-independent functionality to multiple aspects of GPA. It equips clinicians and scientists with a useful tool in studying molecular mechanism of human diseases using modern high-throughput genome-wide screening strategy, which assists personalized therapy.

40|$|Recent {{advances}} in long-range Hi-C contact mapping have revealed {{the importance of}} the 3 D structure of chromosomes in gene expression. A current challenge is to identify the key molecular drivers of this 3 D structure. Several genomic features, such as architectural proteins and functional elements, were shown to be enriched at topological domain borders using classical enrichment tests. Here we propose multiple logistic regression to identify those genomic features that positively or negatively influence domain border establishment or maintenance. The model is flexible, and can account for statistical interactions among multiple genomic features. Using both simulated and real data, we show that our model outperforms <b>enrichment</b> <b>test</b> and non-parametric models, such as random forests, for the identification of genomic features that influence domain borders. Using Drosophila Hi-C data at a very high resolution of 1 kb, our model suggests that, among architectural proteins, BEAF- 32 and CP 190 are the main positive drivers of 3 D domain borders. In humans, our model identifies well-known architectural proteins CTCF and cohesin, as well as ZNF 143 and Polycomb group proteins as positive drivers of domain borders. The model also reveals the existence of several negative drivers that counteract the presence of domain borders including P 300, RXRA, BCL 11 A and ELK 1...|$|E
40|$|We {{studied the}} {{dynamics}} of the proteome of influenza virus A/PR/ 8 / 34 (H 1 N 1) infected Madin-Darby canine kidney cells up to 12 hours post infection by mass spectrometry based quantitative proteomics using the approach of stable isotope labeling by amino acids in cell culture (SILAC). We identified 1311 cell proteins and, apart from the proton channel M 2, all major virus proteins. Based on their abundance two groups of virus proteins could be distinguished being in line with the function of the proteins in genesis and formation of new virions. Further, the data indicate a correlation between the amount of proteins synthesized and their previously determined copy number inside the viral particle. We employed bioinformatic approaches such as functional clustering, gene ontology, and pathway (KEGG) <b>enrichment</b> <b>tests</b> to uncover co-regulated cellular protein sets, assigned the individual subsets to their biological function, and determined their interrelation within the progression of viral infection. For the first time we are able to describe dynamic changes of the cellular and, of note, the viral proteome in a time dependent manner simultaneously. Through cluster analysis, time dependent patterns of protein abundances revealed highly dynamic up- and/or down-regulation processes. Taken togethe...|$|R
50|$|Enrichment only becomes {{effective}} where, by Liebig's law, {{carbon dioxide}} {{has become the}} limiting factor. In a controlled greenhouse, irrigation may be trivial, and soils may be fertile by default. In less-controlled gardens and open fields, rising CO2 levels only increase primary production {{to the point of}} soil depletion (assuming no droughts, flooding, or both), as demonstrated prima facie by CO2 levels continuing to rise. In addition, laboratory experiments, free air carbon <b>enrichment</b> (FACE) <b>test</b> plots, and field measurements provide replicability.|$|R
40|$|Many {{microbes}} {{can acquire}} genetic material from their environment and incorporate {{it into their}} genome, {{a process known as}} lateral genetic transfer (LGT). Computational approaches have been developed to detect genomic regions of lateral origin, but typically lack sensitivity, ability to distinguish donor from recipient, and scalability to very large datasets. To address these issues we have introduced an alignment-free method based on ideas from document analysis, term frequency-inverse document frequency (TF-IDF). Here we examine the performance of TF-IDF on three empirical datasets: 27 genomes of Escherichia coli and Shigella, 110 genomes of enteric bacteria, and 143 genomes across 12 bacterial and three archaeal phyla. We investigate the effect of k-mer size, gap size and delineation of groups on the inference of genomic regions of lateral origin, finding an interplay among these parameters and sequence divergence. Because TF-IDF identifies donor groups and delineates regions of lateral origin within recipient genomes, aggregating these regions by gene enables us to explore, for the first time, the mosaic nature of lateral genes including the multiplicity of biological sources, ancestry of transfer and over-writing by subsequent transfers. We carry out Gene Ontology <b>enrichment</b> <b>tests</b> to investigate which biological processes are potentially affected by LGT...|$|R
