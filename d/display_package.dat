In this paper we describe the process of determining {{the positions of the}} plug-plate holes, where plates contain three or more stacked observation configurations. The process, which up until now has involved several separate processes and has required significant manual configuration and checking, is now being automated to increase efficiency and reduce error. This is carried out by means of a thin Java controller layer which drives the configuration cycle. This layer controls the user interface and the C++ algorithm layer where the plate configuration and optimisation is carried out. Additionally, through the Aladin <b>display</b> <b>package,</b> it provides visualisation and facilitates user verification of the resulting plates. Comment: 4 pages, 3 figures.

40|$|This report {{describes}} {{the activities of}} the nuclear physics group at Mississippi State University, which were performed under contract DE-FG 05 - 92 ER 40726 with the Department of Energy. Under the contract, the nuclear physics group at MSU provided leadership for the Gammasphere Software Working Group (SWG) and developed software and software standards. The SWG held four workshops during the term of the contract to inform committee members and interested parties of development in software and computer technologies and summaries of the presentations and discussions were compiled for distribution. These summaries have been distributed to interested members of the nuclear physics community and copies are included with this report. SWG subcommittees were organized to address specific issues and reports were given to the full SWG at each meeting. The subcommittee on a ''standard format for histogram data'' developed a format that was presented to the Gammasphere Users' Group and has been provided to interested parties. Other subcommittees were organized to address issues of parallel computing and graphical user interfaces at GammaSphere. We worked closely with Robert Varner and Bill Milner at ORNL in adapting and testing the ORNL histogram display software (UPAK) for use on SPARC-based workstations. The software was ported by ORNL staff to the Solaris OS and tests were run at MSU. We also investigated ways to enhance the OpenLook compatibility and user interface of the ORNL <b>display</b> <b>package.</b> The SWG interacted closely with researchers at Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory (LBL).

40|$|In {{trying to}} get {{products}} out to the market in promotional or <b>display</b> <b>packaging,</b> companies {{have the option of}} turning to a contract packager. The purpose of this thesis is to present the area of contract packaging, specifically discussing the internal factors that make a contract packager an attractive actor to outsource packaging of products to and also to find out how a contract packager can affect the supply chain of the company outsourcing to such an actor. The questions posed in this thesis are: - When is it appropriate to outsource? - Why is a supplier of contract packaging successful? - How is the supply chain affected when outsourcing to a contract packager? In addressing these questions a systems approach has been used, because a systems approach allows the researcher to see properties of the whole, rather than seeing the sum of parts as the collective properties of a system. The empirical data were collected through a case study of one company performing contract packaging. Literature was studied in the areas of outsourcing, supply chain/supply chain management, third-party logistics and contract packaging. Each of the questions posed was answered through the papers appended in this thesis. The first paper uses complexity theory in order for managers to be able to view outsourcing situations from a balanced perspective, providing guidance from two important functions – relative power and interface complexity. The conclusion reached in this paper is that in order for an outsourcing situation to be appropriate, the outsourcing company, vis-à-vis the supplier of the activity/process, needs to have high relative power while keeping interface complexity low. V The second and third papers discuss why a contract packager is successful and how it affects the supply chain of the company engaging it. In reference to the contract packager, it is ascertained that important activities to offer, besides the packing of products, are design and manufacturing of packaging and warehousing of the product of the customer. In using a contract packager, the company engaging it can utilize certain characteristics of contract <b>packaging.</b> The characteristics <b>displayed</b> by contract <b>packaging</b> are the “one-stop shop”, flexibility and warehousing. These characteristics give an outcome in the supply chain that can be used by the company to achieve effectiveness — from manufacturing of the product to the delivery of the product in <b>display</b> <b>packaging</b> to the store. The company’s supply chain is enabled to reduce uncertainty, reduce time-to-market of the promotions, and increase responsiveness. The company can also realize other benefits including consolidation of products and postponement of manufacturing of packaging and packing...|$|R
