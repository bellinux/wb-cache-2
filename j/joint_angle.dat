50|$|Powers (2008) {{produced}} a simulation of arm co-ordination. He suggested {{that in order}} to move your arm, fourteen control systems that control fourteen <b>joint</b> <b>angles</b> are involved, and they reorganise simultaneously and independently. It was found that for optimum performance, the output functions must be organised in a way so as each control system's output only affects the one environmental variable it is perceiving. In this simulation, the reorganising process is working as it should, and just as Powers suggests that it works in humans, reducing outputs that cause error and increasing those that reduce error. Initially, the disturbances have large effects on the <b>angles</b> of the <b>joints,</b> but over time the <b>joint</b> <b>angles</b> match the reference signals more closely due to the system being reorganised. Powers (2008) suggests {{that in order to}} achieve coordination of <b>joint</b> <b>angles</b> to produce desired movements, instead of calculating how multiple <b>joint</b> <b>angles</b> must change to produce this movement the brain uses negative feedback systems to generate the <b>joint</b> <b>angles</b> that are required. A single reference signal that is varied in a higher-order system can generate a movement that requires several <b>joint</b> <b>angles</b> to change at the same time.|$|R
40|$|Cataloged from PDF {{version of}} article. Animation of {{articulated}} figures {{has always been}} an interesting subject of computer graphics due {{to a wide range of}} applications, like military, ergonomic design etc. An articulated figure is usually modelled as a set of segments linked with joints. Changing the <b>joint</b> <b>angles</b> brings the articulated figure to a new posture. An animator can define the <b>joint</b> <b>angles</b> for a new posture (forward kinematics). However, it is difficult to estimate the exact <b>joint</b> <b>angles</b> needed to place the articulated figure to a predefined position. Instead of this, an animator can specify the desired position for an end-effector, and then an algorithm computes the <b>joint</b> <b>angles</b> needed (inverse kinematics). In this thesis, we present the implementation of an inverse kinematics algorithm using nonlinear optimization methods. This algorithm computes a potential function value between the end-effector and the desired posture of the end-effector called goal. Then, it tries to minimize the value of the function. If the goal cannot be reached due to constraints then an optimum solution is found and applied by the algorithm. The user may assign priority to the <b>joint</b> <b>angles</b> by scaling initial values estimated by the algorithm. In this way, the <b>joint</b> <b>angles</b> change according to the animator’s priorityAbalı, A. SezginM. S...|$|R
40|$|Two {{experiments}} {{were performed to}} determine if proprioceptive signals are perceived more readily in terms of limb segment inclinations to the vertical than as <b>joint</b> <b>angles.</b> Subjects attempted to match arm positions with the upper arms supported at different inclinations. Constant error data showed that, when instructed to match forearm inclinations to the vertical, subjects were very accurate. When required to match elbow <b>joint</b> <b>angles,</b> however, errors were strongly biased {{in the direction of}} matching forearm inclinations. The results support a view of proprioception as a system in which afferent signals related to the gravitational torques acting at joints lead to the perception of limb orientation rather than <b>joint</b> <b>angles.</b> Such a system would allow more efficient determination of the relationship of limb segments to external objects than would one based purely on <b>joint</b> <b>angles...</b>|$|R

5000|$|Proprioception: Proprioception means [...] "sense of self". In limbs, proprioceptors are {{sensors that}} provide {{information}} about <b>joint</b> <b>angle,</b> muscle length, and tension, which is integrated to give information about {{the position of the}} limb in space. For postural stability, {{it has been suggested that}} stretch receptors may contribute to immediate stabilization in posture. However, researchers have found a weak correlation between muscle length and ankle <b>joint</b> <b>angle,</b> indicating that the stretch reflex is probably not the main contributor to postural stability. Additionally, there is approximately a 30 ms time delay between any stretch receptor response to a change in muscle length, which further supports the idea that stretch receptors may not have a big contribution to postural stability. However, this should not rule out the role of all proprioceptors in maintaining postural stability in humans.|$|E

50|$|Moment arm of ankle muscles: The {{moment arm}} of ankle muscle {{hypothesis}} for postural stability was first developed in 1993 by Young et al. {{and has been}} primarily seen in cats, though it is speculated that such mechanisms may also exist in humans. Results obtained from Young et al. showed that in the cat ankle joint, many of its muscles have predominant moment arms about the adduction/abduction axis. Smaller moment arms are found in inversion/eversion and about the principal axis of motion, dorsiflexion/extension. Additionally, Young et al. showed that the magnitudes of the moment arms in abduction/adduction and inversion/eversion strongly depended on <b>joint</b> <b>angle.</b> As the <b>joint</b> <b>angle</b> moved increasingly away from the neutral axis, {{the magnitude of the}} moment arms also increased. Such a finding suggests that, at least in cats, the coactivation of these agonist-antagonistmuscles is used for immediate stabilization in posture.|$|E
5000|$|An {{isometric}} exercise {{is a form}} of exercise involving the static contraction of a muscle without any visible movement in the angle of the joint. The term [...] "isometric" [...] combines the Greek words [...] "Isos" [...] (equal) and [...] "metria" [...] (measuring), meaning that in these exercises the length of the muscle and the angle of the joint do not change, though contraction strength may be varied. This is in contrast to isotonic contractions, in which the contraction strength does not change, though the muscle length and <b>joint</b> <b>angle</b> do.|$|E

In addition, the <b>joint</b> <b>angle</b> is altered by the shank leverate to tip the bit downward and into the tongue. These bits, sometimes called [...] "cowboy snaffles" [...] due to their popularity among western riders, are actually more harsh than a curb with a simple, solid, ported mouthpiece.|$|E

5000|$|Isometric {{exercise}} tools perform exercises or {{strength test}} using static contraction of a muscle without any visible {{movement in the}} angle of the joint.

50|$|Isometric {{exercise}} {{provides a}} {{maximum amount of}} resistance based on the force output of the muscle, or muscles pitted against one another. This maximum force maximally strengthens the muscles over all of the joint angles at which the isometric exercise occurs. By comparison, weight training also strengthens the muscle throughout the range of motion the joint is trained in, but only maximally at one angle, causing a lesser increase in physical strength at other angles from the initial through terminating <b>joint</b> <b>angle</b> as compared with isometric exercise. In addition, the risk of injury from weights used in weight training is greater than with isometric exercise (no weights), {{and the risk of}} asymmetric training is also greater than with isometric exercise of identical opposing muscles.|$|E
5000|$|Human {{knee joints}} are {{enlarged}} {{for the same}} reason as the hip - to better support an increased amount of body weight. [...] The degree of knee extension (the angle between the thigh and shank in a walking cycle) has decreased. The changing pattern of the knee <b>joint</b> <b>angle</b> of humans shows a small extension peak, called the “double knee action,” in the midstance phase. Double knee action decreases energy lost by vertical movement of the center of gravity. Humans walk with their knees kept straight and the thighs bent inward so that the knees are almost directly under the body, rather than out to the side, {{as is the case in}} ancestral hominids. This type of gait also aids balance.|$|E
