50|$|Welsh {{professional}} club teams traditionally played <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>leagues</b> {{as their}} English counterparts, structured into regional divisions. This often resulted in teams from North Wales and South Wales not {{facing each other}} as the transport links between the two regions were poor. <b>In</b> 1992 <b>the</b> Welsh Premier League was formed to create a national league. Six Welsh clubs who enjoyed success <b>in</b> <b>the</b> English leagues refused to join, but despite this the teams that come top of the Welsh Premier League have a greater chance of playing in European competition, as the top three clubs are drawn into the UEFA Champions League and the UEFA Europa League.|$|R

5|$|The {{origins of}} the Challenge era come from the method of play of the Amateur Hockey Association of Canada prior to 1893. From 1887 to 1893, the league did not play a {{round-robin}} format, but rather challenges between teams of the association that year, with {{the winner of the}} series being the 'interim' champion, with the final challenge winner becoming the league champion for the year. The Stanley Cup kept the tradition going, but added league championships as another way that a team could win the trophy. If a team <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>league</b> as the current champion won the league championship, it would then inherit the Cup, without a challenge. The only time this rule was not followed was in 1904, when the Ottawa Senators club withdrew from its league, the CAHL. The trustees ruled that the Cup stayed with Ottawa, instead of the CAHL league champion.|$|E
5|$|Under {{the name}} piping shrike, the white-backed magpie was {{declared}} the official {{emblem of the}} Government of South Australia in 1901 by Governor Tennyson, and has featured on the South Australian flag since 1904. The magpie is a commonly used emblem of sporting teams in Australia, and its brash, cocky attitude has been likened to the Australian psyche. Such teams tend to wear uniforms with black and white stripes. The Collingwood Football Club adopted the magpie from a visiting South Australian representative team in 1892. The Port Adelaide Magpies would similarly adopt {{the black and white}} colours and Magpie name in 1902. Other examples include Brisbane's Souths Logan Magpies, and Sydney's Western Suburbs Magpies. Disputes over who has been the first club to adopt the magpie emblem have been heated at times. Another club, Glenorchy Football Club of Tasmania, was forced to change uniform design when placed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>league</b> as another club (Claremont Magpies) with the same emblem.|$|E

They rejoined the Lancashire Combination, and played in the league {{for the next five}} seasons, before going bankrupt in 1936 and disbanding for a second time. The club returned to action following the Second World War, and won the Lancashire Combination title in 1950 and 1952. Nelson continued to play <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>league</b> until 1982, when the side achieved a third-placed finish. In the same year, the non-league football system was re-organised, resulting {{in the formation of the}} North West Counties Football League. The club was accepted into the league's Third Division, and was transferred to the Second Division in 1987, as a result of the abolition of the third tier. However, the following season the team was forced to leave the league after their ground was deemed to be unfit. They joined the West Lancashire League in 1988 and stayed there until 1992, never finishing higher than 15th in four seasons. That year, the club was accepted back into the North West Counties League Second Division after improving the stadium. The club played in the same division for the next 15 years, until they won promotion to the First Division, where they played until the end of the 2009–10 season. On 16 July 2010, it was announced that Nelson had resigned from the North West Counties Football League with immediate effect.|$|E

25|$|Past rivalries include local Amsterdam derbies between Ajax {{and clubs}} such as Blauw-Wit, DWS and De Volewijckers (which later merged to become FC Amsterdam in 1972).

40|$|Mutual {{relations}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> area of sports, {{which in}} contemporary international contacts often not only reflect {{the true nature}} of political relations but sometimes even affect them, can be a valuable contribution to the analysis of this conflict’s nature.

Why does it accept the presence of sports teams from both banks of <b>the</b> Dniester playing <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>leagues?</b> Why does Transnistria, despite being much smaller, predominate in many sports? How is it that Sheriff Tiraspol, the flagship football club of the business and political circles controlling Transnistria, managed to win the Moldovan championship ten times in a row and is the main source of players for Moldova’s national team? Does sport really ‘know no borders’ or perhaps the border on the Dniester is different than seems at first sight...|$|R
