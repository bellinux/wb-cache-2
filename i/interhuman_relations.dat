40|$|Theatre can be broadly {{construed}} as a cultural system for collectively modelling and experiencing life, and thus as manifesting the dynamics inherent to all evolving cultural systems. Such is the deﬁnition underpinning the current paper, written from a theatre scholar’s perspective, and employing as a backdrop Gilbert Simondon’s proposal that individuation constitutes a kind of theatre. Notions of ‘‘existential pluralism’’ (Etienne Souriau) and ‘‘agential intra-actions’’ (Karen Barad) are used in attempts to identify theatre {{as a catalyst for}} the renewal of cultural experience vital for sustaining projective powers of the collective imagination. Theatre architectures ranging from the physically sited to the digitally networked involve unique socio-technical craftsmanship and hodological or wayfaring skills, to allow the emergence of <b>interhuman</b> <b>relations</b> Simondon describes as ‘‘transindividual’’...|$|E

In most o f the country families there exists traditional and conservative role division. It results from the division of country duties and work and also from rural mentality and culture.

40|$|Abstract. Companies in nowaday’s {{business}} world {{have started to}} {{recognize the value of}} Social Network Analysis not only for the discovery of <b>interhuman</b> <b>relations,</b> but also for the examination of e. g. interorganizational dependencies and collaboration patterns. However, the corresponding IT-supported analyses require a large amount of explicitly structured data, which is rarely available and costly to create manually. The contribution of our presented approach to the above described problem is therefore two-fold. The first challenge is {{to bridge the gap between}} unstructered text data and the required network structures for the specific domain of business news. The aim is to obtain a network of companies that represents relevant facts (like industry relatedness) as close to reality as possible. We will then apply a chosen catalogue of social network analysis techniques in order to validate their suitability and to generate immediate feedback for the network generation step...|$|E
40|$|English anotation - Bibliodrama as {{relation}} Relational {{dimensions in}} bibliodramatic work and its theological embedment Basic {{question of the}} paper is, if and which connection bibliodrama has as to relation; if {{it is possible to}} understand bibliodrama as a bearer of relation, which dimensions relation has in bibliodrama and how it is theologically embedded. The paper is focused on aspects of bibliodrama in a relations perspective. First is the group (fellowship), meeting a biblical text in context of interhuman and transcendental relations; a description of group dynamics generally and specially in a bibliodramatic group. Another dimension of relations is the Bible representing communication and the relational dimension between God and man. Then the paper describes the phenomenon of religious experience, which is used in bibliodrama and makes man relate to the text in an emotional and personal dimension. Reflection helps to work on emotions in a more conscious way, and see them in a context of personal life and fellowship, biblical text and <b>interhuman</b> <b>relations.</b> Theological embedment of relation is based on the situation of creation, in which the basis of human existence is the ability of man relating to and being a picture of Gods. Likewise man relates to creation (world, other people and society). God is [...] ...|$|E
40|$|This is a {{translation}} of ‘Socialité et argent’, a text by Emmanuel Levinas originally published in 1987. Levinas describes the emergence of money out of <b>interhuman</b> <b>relations</b> of exchange and the social relations – sociality – that result. While elsewhere he has presented sociality as ‘nonindifference to alterity’ it appears here as ‘proximity of the stranger’ {{and points to the}} tension between an economic system based on money and the basic human disposition to respond to the face of the other person. Money both encodes and effaces sociality, both designates and disguises social relations. It arises from the way that needs and interests are manifested in exchange relations, in what he calls the ‘interestedness’ of economic life. But interests are always already cut through by the fact that being is always ‘being with others’. Being is always ‘interbeing’. Interestedness is always confronted by disinterestedness, that is, by a sociality marked by the ‘goodness of giving’, attachment to and concern for the poverty of the other person. Levinas concludes with a discussion of sociality and justice, posing questions about the tension between the demand to respond to an Other immediately before me {{and at the same time}} to respond to the demands of an other Other (the third person) who also invites a response. ...|$|E
40|$|The article {{presents}} a general {{outline of the}} American concept of QWL, being an attempt a tradical changes in the entire work environment A very wide range of problems, which are sought to be solved with {{in the framework of}} practical realization of QWL induces the author to conduct some comparisons of this concept with classical forms of industrial democracy realized in Western Europe. The first part of the article deals with socio-economic relations accounting for definite changes in the U. S. work environment, with a special attention focussed on those which have paved the way for a specific character of QWL programme in comparison with the European experience in this field. The second part of the article is an attempt at defining the QWL term and, simultaneously, it contains short description of characteristic features of the QWL concept and an attempt at evaluation of its practical realization in the U. S. This description is supplemented by an at tempt to substantiate the lack of interest in the classical forms of industrial democracy in the U. S. (especially, lack of interest in the forms of indirect democracy). Moreover, there can be found a brief description of typicaly American experience aiming primarily at labour productivity improvement and betterment of <b>interhuman</b> <b>relations</b> and working conditions.

40|$|Kultura języka", a term {{which does}} not have an English equivalent, but {{corresponds}} roughly to "cultivated usage", consists in exercising conscious influence on the language and its development, as well as in making conscious use of it in <b>interhuman</b> <b>relations.</b> Exercising influence on the language means the forming of linguistic norms, that is to say certain directives on how to use the given elements of language, namely how to pronounce certain sounds, how to inflect words, by means of what rules to join them into sentences, etc. A linguistic norm must be based on linguistic reality, that is one cannot establish a norm which would not be supported by the usage of {{at least part of the}} language community. The notion of norm entails another phenomenon, namely a linguistic error, resulting either from one’s being ignorant of the norm, or from a visible misapplication of the norm. However, language is a phenomenon subject to constant evolution. This evolution results from linguistic innovations, that is to say from such deviations from the norm which do not meet with objection from the competent part of the society. The author goes on to discuss a number of examples which illustrate deviations from the norm in pronunciation, inflection, syntax, lexicon, etc. Talking about the lexicon, the author stresses the fact that the speaker must adjust his vocabulary to the subject matter, in accordance with his intention.

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} an environmental ethic {{based on the}} philosophy of Martin Heidegger. Chapter One uses Heidegger's conception of 'dwelling' {{as the basis for}} a satisfying account of the 'otherness' or alterity of nature. Chapter Two draws upon Heidegger's writings on 'the dif-ference', Madhyamaka Buddhist philosophy and the metaphysics of Alfred North Whitehead to develop a 'dialectical' conception of holism which can accommodate both the account of alterity presented in Chapter One and an account of the intrinsic value of individual beings. Chapter Three frames this conception of environmental holism in terms of ethics. It is argued that Heidegger's ideal of 'releasement' {{can be thought of as}} an essential 'function' of humans, the exercise of which promotes human flourishing. Extending this Aristotelian line of reasoning, it is shown how one can draw upon Heidegger's philosophy to articulate a form of environmental virtue ethic. Chapter Four investigates the charge that Heidegger's later thought is quietistic, a general allegation which is analysed into four interrelated specific charges: 1) the accusation that Heidegger is advocating a passive withdrawal from the world; 2) Adorno's charge in Negative Dialectics that Heidegger's philosophy is inimical to critical thought; 3) the objection that Heidegger is unable to deal adequately with either <b>interhuman</b> <b>relations</b> or the relations between humans and nonhuman animals; and 4) the charge that Heidegger's later writings cannot be brought to bear upon practical environmental issues. In answer to this last objection, case studies are presented of two environmental issues: 1) the environmental impact of tourism; and 2) the practice of environmental restoration...|$|E
40|$|The informatisation of {{our image}} {{of the human being}} Serious {{reflection}} is required to determine our position regarding our {{image of the}} human being. The image we maintain is of critical importance. It determines <b>interhuman</b> <b>relations</b> and human action. The traditional notion of the human subject as absolute, self-certain and autonomous has been comprehensively questioned for some decades and can be considered outdated. This rethinking has a long history and a diversity of insights has been developed by many influential thinkers. Processes of informatisation {{play a significant role in}} the development of these different perspectives. Three developments seem prominent. The first is the development of the notion of the so-called “decentred subject”. The second development puts more emphasis on the mechanical – more specifically the mechanisation of the mind, with the consequent renunciation of human spirituality. This perspective is a predecessor of the third development which entails a further degeneration of human subjectivity. Non-corporeal consciousness can now be downloaded onto computers. The figure of the posthuman emerges. Problems of fallibility, mortality and ageing will disappear. Although such an apocalyptic viewpoint may indeed sound tempting, it leaves many crucial questions unanswered. On the other hand, when dealt with differently, this process of rethinking brings forward some rich and new articulations of what it means to be human, which can be of great significance for individuality and sociality in the light of the crises that threaten to fatally derail contemporary societies worldwide. It is, moreover, not totally unrelated to the other three ways and receives its inspiration from them...|$|E
40|$|This work {{contains}} and mainly tackles {{the contract}} of consumption, its differences and similitudes {{to a general}} contract, manners of applying it, {{and the way in}} which the former can be better coordinated and correlated to the general contracting terms, established by the civil law. Along the years, the consumption contract has undergone several addenda and it has come to represent an instrument of both refference and regulation for the socio-economical relations between two parties who have a commercial agreement. The general law frame has had a great influence in the development of the consumption contract, as well as on its applicability conditions and its manner of deployment. Through the development of the judicial law concerning the contract of concumption, this type of agreement has influenced, through its human and social nature, both the general contract, and the specific frame it relates to. The relationship between the two types of contract is one of interdependence, which is determined by the need of judicial regulation in the Romanian and European economy. The ceaselees development of <b>interhuman</b> <b>relations</b> pushes society towards maintaining a continuous study of the advancement of specific legislation and judicial regulation. The main purpose of this work is analyzing the general judicial frame {{and the way in which}} the differences between the general contract and the consumption one may represent a benefic and mutual influence on protecting the citizens’ rights, which in the case of the consumption contract encompasses the protection of consumers’ rights. Also, it will analyze the aspects that determine the manner of application and the the differences that can be surmounted in order to achieve a better cohesion between these types of contracts...|$|E
40|$|For centuries, but {{especially}} under Heidegger 2 ̆ 7 s {{influence in the}} twentieth century, Christian theology has consistently approached its inquiry through the language of ontology and {{within the framework of}} Being. These attempts to find a rational way to articulate religious life and the mystery of God, making spiritual praxis secondary to theory, not only run the danger of reducing God to a set of propositions, but also risk condoning violent indifference to <b>interhuman</b> <b>relations.</b> In response, Glenn Morrison suggests that Emmanuel Levinas 2 ̆ 7 s philosophical corpus, which puts into question Heidegger 2 ̆ 7 s fundamental ontology, can serve as a valuable resource for developing new theological language that unites theory and praxis. Building on previous attempts to appropriate Levinas to Christian thought, Morrison critiques thinkers such as Michael Purcell, David Ford, Michael Barnes, and Graham Ward for hesitating to go beyond ontotheology. A Theology of Alterity strives to more radically utilize Levinas 2 ̆ 7 s philosophical framework, bringing it into conversation with the theology of Hans Urs von Balthasar, to construct a post-ontotheological account of theology that coincides with ethical behavior. In looking at these two thinkers in relation to each other, Morrison brings out the drama of eros that is often hidden in Levinas 2 ̆ 7 s texts, and he points the way toward a less mystical, more ethical, and more metaphysically transformative reading of von Balthasar. In allowing Levinas 2 ̆ 7 s Judaism to challenge von Balthasar 2 ̆ 7 s Catholicism, Morrison develops a perspective that is both theologically rich and philosophically provocative. Following Levinas 2 ̆ 7 s demand that we think Being 2 ̆ 7 otherwise, 2 ̆ 7 Morrison explores the implications of alterity in both systematic and practical theological matters such as the paschal mystery, Christ 2 ̆ 7 s person and mission, pastoral care, mental health, forgiveness, prayer, and Jewish-Christian friendship. Reflecting on central articles of the Christian faith through the language of alterity, such as Christ 2 ̆ 7 s death and resurrection, he describes the work of an ethically grounded theology that inspires a 2 ̆ 7 trinitarian praxis 2 ̆ 7; wherein theology is driven by a kenotic, self-giving love, a radical gift of passivity, and the desire to encounter Christ {{in the face of the}} other person...|$|E
40|$|A study {{consists}} of three parts, first being focused on theoretical explanation of concepts involved („work", „culture", „culture of work"), the second reflecting general factors that condition changes in the „culture of work", and the third concentrated on problems of stimulating changes {{in the process of}} work, and of its cultural aspects. In the first part, the author deliberates the concepts of „work", „culture" and „culture of work", and their mutual relationships, from the standpoints' of everyday usage and of sociology. Culture is interpreted here as both a „by- -product", and a correlate (or an attribute) of human activity, especially of productive work. Culture patterns, norms and ideals — being a set of by-products of a human productive work — are {{at the same time the}} conditions for a work- -process, its organization, and for intergroup and <b>interhuman</b> <b>relations.</b> In the second part, the author stresses an idea that culture and „culture of work" undergo historical changes due to the process of economic and social development. To his opinion, „culture of work" is greatly impressed by three groups of the situational factors, i. e. : a) an economic and political system of society, and a phase in its development; b) a cultural heritage of a society varying due to both territorial and class diversity of population, and to its international contacts; c) an institutional infrastructure of culture in a society, and a cultural policy of the government. Another main factors influencing „culture of work" are regional and local culture patterns of population, and social relations in the local milieus, both of them correlating with social and demographic characteristics of population. In the third part, the author discusses some cultural aspects of dynamizing the process of work. He points out the three groups of means available of stimulating productivity, i. e. : 1) the means of improving planning and organization, and technology of production; 2) the means of selecting manpower, and of improving their qualifications; 3) the means of re-orienting of workers' norms, values and ideals, of re-modelling of their motivations, morales and attitudes. Characterizing more precisely the last group, the author has pointed out, among others, the following means : a) improving and uprising of professional education (in mural forms, or courses) by introducing some elements of discussion on the role and meaning of work in a human life; b) discussing the results of sociological and psychological investigations on motivation, productivity, etc., within a program of professional education. The author argues, however, that the most important and the most effective means of re-shaping workers attitudes and morales is an immediate, everyday example (if good) of their masters, supervisors, and opinion leaders.
