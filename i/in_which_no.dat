5|$|The 2006 Atlantic {{hurricane}} season was significantly less active than the record previous season. It {{marked the first}} season since 2001 <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>no</b> hurricanes made landfall in the United States, {{and was the first}} since 1994 <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>no</b> tropical cyclones formed during October. Following the intense activity of 2005, forecasters predicted that the 2006 season would be only slightly less active. Instead activity was slowed by a rapidly forming moderate El Niño event, the presence of the Saharan Air Layer over the tropical Atlantic, and the steady presence of a robust secondary high-pressure area to the Azores high centered on Bermuda. There were no tropical cyclones after October 2.|$|E
5|$|A common {{interpretation}} of Either/Or presents {{the reader with}} a choice between two approaches to life. There are no standards or guidelines which indicate how to choose. The reasons for choosing an ethical way of life over the aesthetic only make sense if one is already committed to an ethical way of life. Suggesting the aesthetic approach as evil implies one has already accepted {{the idea that there}} is a good/evil distinction to be made. Likewise, choosing an aesthetic way of life only appeals to the aesthete, ruling Judge Vilhelm's ethics as inconsequential and preferring the pleasures of seduction. Thus, existentialists see Victor Eremita as presenting a radical choice <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>no</b> pre-ordained value can be discerned. One must choose, and through one's choices, one creates what one is.|$|E

5|$|During {{the period}} between 1984 and 1986, <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>no</b> major clash took place, Habré greatly {{strengthened}} his position thanks to western support and Libya's failure to respect the Franco-Libyan 1984 agreement. From 1984 onwards, the GUNT also suffered increasing factional tensions, centered on the fight between Goukouni and Acheikh ibn Oumar over {{the leadership of the}} organization. Taking advantage of the GUNT's difficulties, Habré struck a series of accords with smaller rebel factions, which left the GUNT at the beginning of 1986 with only three of the eleven factions that had originally signed the Lagos Accord in 1979. The remaining factions were Goukouni's People's Armed Forces (FAP), Acheikh's armed branch of the Democratic Revolutionary Council (CDR) and that part of the Chadian Armed Forces (FAT) which had maintained its loyalty to Wadel Abdelkader Kamougué.|$|E
5|$|In 1952, the UK's most {{disastrous}} SPAD ever {{occurred at}} Harrow and Wealdstone, <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>No.</b> 46242 City of Glasgow was severely damaged. The {{lack of an}} ATC system on most of Britain's railways was at last seen as an urgent issue. From 1956 the BR-designed Automatic Warning System (AWS) was installed. It was similar to ATC but relied on an induced magnetic field rather than an electric current and featured a visual indicator in the cab. The receiving system was installed on the Coronation class locomotives from 1959 onwards. The outward evidence of on-board AWS comprised a protective shield behind the front screw coupling, a box to house the necessary batteries immediately {{in front of the}} cab on the right-hand side and a cylindrical vacuum reservoir above the right-hand running plate.|$|E
5|$|In {{directed}} planar graphs, simple directed cycles are dual to directed cuts (partitions of the vertices {{into two}} subsets such that all edges go in one direction, from one subset to the other). Strongly oriented planar graphs (graphs whose underlying undirected graph is connected, {{and in which}} every edge belongs to a cycle) are dual to directed acyclic graphs <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>no</b> edge belongs to a cycle. To put this another way, the strong orientations of a connected planar graph (assignments of directions {{to the edges of}} the graph that result in a strongly connected graph) are dual to acyclic orientations (assignments of directions that produce a directed acyclic graph).|$|E

5|$|In the Second Test at the Melbourne Cricket Ground, {{his last}} {{at his home}} ground, Loxton's 32 formed part of a stand of 84 with Hassett, the highest {{partnership}} in a closely fought, low-scoring game <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>no</b> team passed 200. He again failed in the second innings, scoring two as Australia scraped home by 28 runs. After contributing 17 {{in a total of}} 426 in the Third Test at the Sydney Cricket Ground, which Australia won by an innings to take an unassailable 3–0 series lead, he was dropped in favour of Jim Burke, who scored a century on debut. The Victorian never played Test cricket again.|$|E
5|$|In {{the course}} of his {{preparing}} for a drama review, Hazlitt was in the habit of reading or rereading the play he was soon to see, and his reviews came to include extensive commentary on the plays themselves, turning rapidly from dramatic criticism to literary criticism. With Shakespeare in particular, this led to considerations {{of the ways in which}} the actors—again, particularly his favourite Kean—communicated the message of the plays. But he also noted ways <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>no</b> actor's interpretation could live up to the dramatist's conception.|$|E
5|$|In {{the first}} Test match played, between Australia and England in March 1877, Charles Bannerman {{became the first}} player to score a century in Test cricket. In a match <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>no</b> other player scored more than 20 runs in either innings for Australia, Bannerman scored 165 not out. That score {{remained}} the highest on debut until R. E. Foster scored 287 for England against Australia in 1903. Foster's innings was the highest score in Test cricket until 1930, and remains the highest score amongst Test debutants. His double-century is one of five made on Test debut, the other four were scored by Rowe, Brendon Kuruppu, Mathew Sinclair and Jacques Rudolph. Eight players (Bill Ponsford, Doug Walters, Alvin Kallicharran, Mohammad Azharuddin, Greg Blewett, Sourav Ganguly, Rohit Sharma, and James Neesham) went on to make centuries in the second test as well; Azharuddin is the only player to score centuries in his first three tests.|$|E

5|$|Jim Martin, {{positioned}} {{in the lower}} right, gives a coy and perhaps mischievous glance back at the viewer. He {{is a microcosm of}} the entire scene <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>no</b> one appears to be giving thanks in a traditional manner of a Thanksgiving dinner. Solomon finds it a departure from previous depictions of Thanksgiving in that the participants do not lower their heads or raise their hands in the traditional poses of prayer. She sees it as an example of treating American traditions in both sanctified and casual ways. Theologian David Brown sees gratitude as implicit in the painting, while Kenneth Bendiner writes that Rockwell was mindful of the Last Supper and that the painting's perspective echoes its rendition by Tintoretto.|$|E

He was an early, high-profile opponent of eugenics laws, and he carried his opposition into the vice-presidency.

5|$|The 1951 Atlantic {{hurricane}} season {{was the first}} {{hurricane season}} in which tropical cyclones were officially named by the United States Weather Bureau. The season officially started on June15, when the United States Weather Bureau began its daily monitoring for tropical cyclone activity; the season officially ended on November15. It was the first year since 1937 <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>no</b> hurricanes made landfall on the United States; as Hurricane How was the only tropical storm to hit the nation, the season had the least tropical cyclone damage in the United States since the 1939 season.

5|$|The 1991 Atlantic {{hurricane}} season {{was the first}} season in over 24years <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>no</b> hurricanes developed from tropical waves, which are the source for most North Atlantic tropical cyclones. The {{hurricane season}} officially began on June1, and ended on November30. It was the least active in four years due to higher than usual wind shear across the Atlantic Ocean. The first storm, Ana, developed on July2 off the southeast United States and dissipated without causing significant effects. Two other tropical storms in the season– Danny and Erika– did not significantly affect land. Danny dissipated east of the Lesser Antilles, and Erika passed through the Azores before becoming extratropical. In addition, there were four non-developing tropical depressions. The second depression of the season struck Mexico with significant accompanying rains.|$|E
5|$|The 2006 Atlantic {{hurricane}} season {{was the first}} since 2001 <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>no</b> hurricanes made landfall in the United States, and the first since 1994 that no tropical cyclones formed during October.

The season officially began on June 1, 2006, and lasted until November 30. The timeline includes information which was not operationally released, meaning that information from post-storm reviews by the National Hurricane Center, such as information about a storm that was not operationally warned on, have been included.|$|E
