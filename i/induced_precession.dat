We investigate the perturbations exerted by a gas ring on a nearly-Keplerian stellar disk orbiting a SMBH by means of combined direct N-body and smoothed particle hydrodynamics simulations. We simulate the formation of gas rings through the infall and disruption of a molecular gas cloud, adopting different inclinations between the infalling gas cloud and the stellar disk. We find that a CNR-like ring is not efficient in affecting the stellar disk on a timescale of 3 Myr.

Furthermore, the combined effect of two-body relaxation and Omega-precession drives the stellar disk dismembering, displacing the stars from the disk.

40|$|A precessing spin {{observed}} in a rotating frame of reference appears frequency-shifted, an effect analogous to the precession of a Foucault pendulum observed on the rotating Earth. This frequency shift {{can be understood as}} arising from a magnetic pseudo-field in the rotating frame that nevertheless has physically significant consequences, such as the Barnett effect. Detecting these pseudo-fields is experimentally challenging, as a rotating-frame sensor is required. Previous work has realised classical rotating-frame detectors. Here we use quantum sensors, nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centres, in a rapidly rotating diamond to detect pseudo-fields in the rotating frame.

40|$|The general {{relativistic}} precession rate of periastra in close-in exoplanets can be {{orders of}} magnitude larger than {{the magnitude of the}} same effect for Mercury. The realization that some of the close-in exoplanets have significant eccentricities raises the possibility that this precession might be detectable. We explore in this work the observability of the periastra precession using radial velocity and transit light curve observations. Our analysis is independent of the source of precession, which can also have significant contributions due to additional planets and tidal deformations. We find that precession of the periastra of the magnitude expected from general relativity can be detectable in timescales of � 10 years with current observational capabilities by measuring the change in the primary transit duration or in the time difference between primary and secondary transits. Radial velocity curves alone would be able to detect this precession for super-massive, close-in exoplanets orbiting inactive stars if they have ∼ 100 datapoints at each of two epochs separated by ∼ 20 years.

40|$|A {{combination}} of analytic models and n-body simulations {{implies that the}} structural evolution of the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) is dominated by its dynamical interaction with the Milky Way. Although expected at some level, {{the scope of the}} involvement has significant observational consequences. First, LMC disk orbits are torqued out of the disk plane, thickening the disk and populating a spheroid. The torque results from direct forcing by the Milky Way tide and, indirectly, from the drag between the LMC disk and its halo resulting from the <b>induced</b> <b>precession</b> of the LMC disk. The latter is a newly reported mechanism that can affect all satellite interactions. However, the overall torque does not isotropize the stellar orbits, and their kinematics remains disklike. Such a kinematic signature is observed for nearly all LMC populations. The extended disk distribution is predicted to increase the microlensing toward the LMC. Second, the disk 2 ̆ 7 s binding energy slowly decreases during this process, puffing up and priming the outer regions for subsequent tidal stripping. Because the tidally stripped debris will be spatially extended, the distribution of stripped stars is much more extended than the H I Magellanic Stream. This is consistent with upper limits to stellar densities in the gas stream and suggests a different strategy for detecting the stripped stars. Finally, the mass loss over several LMC orbits is predicted by n-body simulation, and the debris extends to tens of kiloparsecs from the tidal boundary.

The gravitational waves emitted by these very relativistic systems can be accurately modelled using a high-order post-Newtonian gravitational wave generation formalism. In this article, we present {{the current state of}} the art on post-Newtonian methods as applied to the dynamics and gravitational radiation of general matter sources (including the radiation reaction back onto the source) and inspiralling compact binaries. We describe the post-Newtonian equations of motion of compact binaries and the associated Lagrangian and Hamiltonian formalisms, paying attention to the self-field regularizations at work in the calculations. Several notions of innermost circular orbits are discussed. We estimate the accuracy of the post-Newtonian approximation and make a comparison with numerical computations of the gravitational self-force for compact binaries in the small mass ratio limit. The gravitational waveform and energy flux are obtained to high post-Newtonian order and the binary’s orbital phase evolution is deduced from an energy balance argument. Some landmark results are given in the case of eccentric compact binaries – moving on quasi-elliptical orbits with non-negligible eccentricity. The spins of the two black holes play an important role in the definition of the gravitational wave templates.

40|$|The {{space debris}} {{population}} has greatly {{increased over the}} last few decades. Active debris removal (ADR) methods may become necessary to remove those objects in orbit that pose the biggest collision risk. Those ADR methods that require contact with the target, show complications if the target is rotating at high speeds. Observed rotations can be higher than 60 deg/s combined with precession and nutation motions. “Natural” rotational damping in upper stages has been observed for some space debris objects. This phenomenon occurs due to the eddy currents induced by the Earth’s magnetic field in the predominantly conductive materials of these man made rotating objects. Existing solutions for the analysis of eddy currents require time-consuming finite elements models to solve a Poisson equation throughout the volume. The first part of this paper presents a new method to compute the eddy currents torque based on the computation of a new tensor called the ‘Magnetic Tensor’. The general theory to compute this tensor by Finite Element Method is given as well as a particular Frame Model. This last model enables an explicit formula to be determined to evaluate the magnetic tensor. Analytical solutions for the spherical shell, the open cylinder and flat plates are given for the magnetic tensor and the eddy current torque model is validated with existing published work. The second part of the paper presents an active de-tumbling method for space debris objects based on eddy currents.

40|$|Many {{proposed}} spintronics {{devices for}} writing data {{are based on}} the use of spin currents. These currents can switch magnetic bits by transfer of angular momentum from one magnetic layer to the other, exerting a torque on the magnetization. To switch magnetic devices efficiently with current-induced spin-transfer torque, new methods are being investigated to create intense and short spin current pulses. In this thesis, we report on the occurance of spin transfer torque on unprecedented timescales by excitation of a ferromagnetic bilayer by femtosecond laser pulses. When exciting a ferromagnetic layer with a femtosecond laser pulse, an ultrafast demagnetization is induced in this layer within a picosecond. This demagnetization has shown to be accompanied by the generation of a spin-polarized current on the same extremely short timescale. In this research, it is demonstrated that laser-induced spin currents are present in a CoNi/Cu/Co non-collinear magnetic bilayer and that these currents exert a spin-transfer torque on one of the magnetic layers, changing the orientation of its magnetization. To this end, we performed time-resolved laser-induced remagnetization measurements using TR-MOKE, from which laser-induced precessions of the magnetization in both magnetic layers are isolated. The properties of a precession, such as amplitude and phase, depend on the excitation mechanism of the precession. We developed macro-spin models for <b>precessions</b> <b>induced</b> by different mechanisms in both layers and compared the obtained precessional properties to these models. It is demonstrated that the in-plane magnetized layer of the bilayer is excited by a short majority spin current, coming from the out-of-plane magnetized layer. Furthermore, the amplitudes of the current-induced precessions are compared for Cu and Pt spacer layers. The <b>induced</b> <b>precessions</b> are found to be much smaller for Pt, as expected from the small spin diffusion length in Pt. Furthermore, we found that the spin transfer length in Pt is almost ten times smaller than in Cu. Concluding, we have demonstrated {{for the first time that}} laser-induced spin currents can be used to change the orientation of the magnetization of one of the magnetic layers in a non-collinear bilayer. Many proposed spintronics devices for writing data {{are based on the}} use of spin currents. These currents can switch magnetic bits by transfer of angular momentum from one magnetic layer to the other, exerting a torque on the magnetization. To switch magnetic devices efficiently with current-induced spin-transfer torque, new methods are being investigated to create intense and short spin current pulses. In this thesis, we report on the occurance of spin transfer torque on unprecedented timescales by excitation of a ferromagnetic bilayer by femtosecond laser pulses. When exciting a ferromagnetic layer with a femtosecond laser pulse, an ultrafast demagnetization is induced in this layer within a picosecond. This demagnetization has shown to be accompanied by the generation of a spin-polarized current on the same extremely short timescale. In this research, it is demonstrated that laser-induced spin currents are present in a CoNi/Cu/Co non-collinear magnetic bilayer and that these currents exert a spin-transfer torque on one of the magnetic layers, changing the orientation of its magnetization. To this end, we performed time-resolved laser-induced remagnetization measurements using TR-MOKE, from which laser-induced precessions of the magnetization in both magnetic layers are isolated. The properties of a precession, such as amplitude and phase, depend on the excitation mechanism of the precession.
