5|$|A.coccinea {{closely resembles}} A.arachnoidea, {{but may be}} {{distinguished}} from the latter by <b>its</b> <b>bright</b> red arms, and its larger spores (4–5 by 2.5–3μm in A.coccinea compared with 2.5–3.5 by 1.5μm in A.arachnoidea). A.arachnoidea is known from Asia and West Africa. A.rubra is a relatively common pantropical species, and differs from A.coccinea in its reddish receptacle (compared with pink to cream-colored in A.coccinea) and bifurcating arms that are typically multichambered.|$|E
5|$|B. sceptrum is principally {{used in the}} {{cut flower}} industry, with the {{immature}} spikes being commonly sold in florists around Australia. It is occasionally grown in gardens as <b>its</b> <b>bright</b> flower spikes are prominent, but requires a Mediterranean (dry summer) climate and good drainage as it is sensitive to dieback. Seeds do not require any treatment, and take 26 to 47 days to germinate. A dwarf form is in cultivation.|$|E
5|$|Retrospective reviews {{remembered the}} game for <b>its</b> <b>bright</b> and {{impressive}} graphics. Kameo was included in Rare Replay, an August 2015 compilation of 30 Rare titles for the Xbox One, alongside documentary-style videos about the game's development and its planned sequel. The latter was canceled {{after a few months}} of production due to both poor sales of the original and Microsoft's new focus on games for its Kinect peripheral.|$|E

5|$|Brazilian pepper (Schinus terebinthifolius) {{was brought}} to Southern Florida as an {{ornamental}} shrub and was dispersed by the droppings of birds and other animals that ate <b>its</b> <b>bright</b> red berries. It thrives on abandoned agricultural land growing in forests too dense for wading birds to nest in, similar to melaleucas. It grows rapidly especially after hurricanes and has invaded pineland forests. Following Hurricane Andrew, scientists and volunteers cleared damaged pinelands of Brazilian pepper so the native trees {{would be able to}} return to their natural state.|$|E
5|$|Persoonia lanceolata {{is rarely}} seen in cultivation, mainly due to {{difficulties}} in propagation; seed germination is unpredictable, and cuttings have proven difficult to strike. Nevertheless, <b>its</b> <b>bright</b> green hue {{is considered an}} attractive horticultural feature. Well drained sandy soils in sun or part shade are needed for this plant in a garden setting. Once established, it tolerates moderate frosts and dry spells, and grows fairly readily in suitable conditions. Plantsmen in England were able to germinate seed there in 1791.|$|E
5|$|As {{with all}} members of its genus, C.cinnabarinum is {{generally}} considered inedible by field guides. Because the fruit bodies begin development underground, they are too tough for consumption {{by the time they}} are visible, and their appearance may be considered unappetizing. A study of the cultural practices of mestizo descendants of the Otomi people in Tenango de Doria, Mexico, reported that immature specimens of C.cinnabarinum, known locally as yemitas, were frequently eaten raw in the past, especially by children. Consumption of the species was no longer commonplace, with only five of the 450 locals interviewed familiar with the practice. The gleba of C.cinnabarinum has been described as having a mild taste and, despite a local recollection to the contrary, is not sweet. C.cinnabarinum has also been used in traditional medicine. A 1986 ethnomycological study of native traditions in Veracruz identified this use of huang noono, which locals roasted, then consumed as a powder with mineral water to treat gastrointestinal distress. Unlike these Mexican traditions, Hunan folk beliefs hold that the mushroom is poisonous on account of <b>its</b> <b>bright</b> color.|$|E

5|$|Gray was {{not chosen}} for camouflage, however, it did, at times, provide {{enough of a}} mask along tree lines during battle; keeping the line of Infantry hidden long enough to strike effectively. At {{the time of the}} American Civil War, the {{usefulness}} of camouflage was not generally recognized. Gray was chosen for Confederate uniforms because gray dye could be made relatively cheaply and it was the standard uniform color of the various State Militias. The gray uniforms worn by early State volunteers was normally a shade of cadet gray, which is not suitable for combat wear, as it gives away the position of the individual easily from <b>its</b> <b>bright</b> blue-gray tones, and for this reason it was preserved by some men for dress-parade functions. The gray mentioned is dull toned, often varying in color depending on the region and time during the conflict, resulting in a uniform that could blend in with the tree lines, or hide the men in the field wearing them.|$|E
5|$|Investigating one of {{a series}} of {{large-scale}} power outages, Indiana electrical lineman Roy Neary experiences a close encounter with a UFO, when it flies over his truck and lightly burns the side of his face with <b>its</b> <b>bright</b> lights. The UFO, joining a group of three other UFOs, is pursued by Neary and three police cars, but the spacecraft fly off into the night sky. Roy becomes fascinated by UFOs, much to the dismay of his wife, Ronnie. He also becomes increasingly obsessed with subliminal, mental images of a mountain-like shape and begins to make models of it. Jillian also becomes obsessed with sketching a unique-looking mountain. Soon after, she is terrorized in her home by a UFO which descends from the clouds. The presence of the UFO energy field makes every appliance in Jillian's house malfunction and Barry is abducted by unseen beings.|$|E
5|$|Sirius is {{a binary}} star system {{consisting}} of two white stars orbiting {{each other with a}} separation of about 20 AU (roughly the distance between the Sun and Uranus) and a period of 50.1 years. The brighter component, termed Sirius A, is a main-sequence star of spectral type early A, with an estimated surface temperature of 9,940K. Its companion, Sirius B, is a star that has already evolved off the main sequence and become a white dwarf. Currently 10,000 times less luminous in the visual spectrum, Sirius B was once the more massive of the two. The age of the system has been estimated at around 230 million years. Early in its lifespan it was thought to have been two bluish white stars orbiting each other in an elliptical orbit every 9.1 years. The system emits a higher than expected level of infrared radiation, as measured by IRAS space-based observatory. This may be an indication of dust in the system, and is considered somewhat unusual for a binary star. The Chandra X-ray Observatory image shows Sirius B outshining <b>its</b> <b>bright</b> partner as it is a brighter X-ray source.|$|E
5|$|The star, as {{seen from}} Earth, has an {{apparent}} magnitude of 13.8. It is not visible with the naked eye. In comparison, Pluto's apparent magnitude at <b>its</b> <b>brightest</b> is slightly brighter, at 13.65.|$|R
5|$|The {{apparent}} magnitude (v) of HD 154672 is 8.22, {{which means that}} it is not visible to the naked eye. It is slightly dimmer than Neptune, which has an {{apparent magnitude}} of 7.78 at <b>its</b> <b>brightest.</b>|$|R
