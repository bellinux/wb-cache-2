500|$|The {{economic}} development of China under the Song dynasty was marked by improvements in farm tools, seeds, and fertilizers. The Song inherited the plow innovations described in the Tang dynasty text The Classic of the Plow, which documents their utilization in Jiangnan. The Song improved on the Tang curved iron plough and invented a special steel plough design specifically for reclaiming wasteland. The wasteland plough was not made of iron, but of stronger steel, the blade was shorter but thicker, and particularly effective in cutting through reeds and roots in wetlands in the Huai River valley. A tool designed to facilitate seedling called [...] "seedling horse" [...] was invented under the Song; {{it was made of}} jujube wood and paulownia wood. Song farms used bamboo water wheels to harness the <b>flow</b> <b>energy</b> of rivers to raise water for irrigation of farmland.|$|E
