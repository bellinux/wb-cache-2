5|$|A {{substantial}} amount of rebuilding followed. In 1733, work began on the royal residence of Christiansborg Palace which was completed in 1745. In 1749, development of the prestigious district of Frederiksstaden was initiated. Designed by Nicolai Eigtved in the Rococo style, its centre contained the mansions which now form Amalienborg Palace. Major extensions to the naval base of Holmen were undertaken while the city's cultural importance was <b>enhanced</b> <b>with</b> the Royal Theatre and the Royal Academy of Fine Arts.|$|E
5|$|By 1661, Copenhagen had {{asserted}} {{its position}} as capital of Denmark and Norway. All the major institutions were located there, {{as was the}} fleet {{and most of the}} army. The defences were further <b>enhanced</b> <b>with</b> the completion of the Citadel in 1664 and the extension of Christianshavns Vold with its bastions in 1692, leading {{to the creation of a}} new base for the fleet at Nyholm.|$|E
5|$|Defence of Tigné Point {{was further}} <b>enhanced</b> <b>with</b> the {{construction}} of Cambridge Battery between 1878 and 1886. Garden Battery was then built between 1889 and 1894, covering the area between Cambridge Battery and Fort Tigné.

5|$|In a {{visit to}} Los Alamos in September 1944, von Neumann showed that the {{pressure}} increase from explosion shock wave reflection from solid objects was greater than previously believed if the angle of incidence of the shock wave was between 90° and some limiting angle. As a result, {{it was determined that}} the effectiveness of an atomic bomb would be <b>enhanced</b> <b>with</b> detonation some kilometers above the target, rather than at ground level.|$|E
5|$|In late November 2011, {{the site}} of a former BJ's Wholesale Club in Norcross, Georgia was {{converted}} in appearance to a Costco for shooting. On January 23, 2012, Hill announced that filming had concluded. Multiple scene takes were made, allowing the cast to follow the script as written and inject their own improvisations. Special effects company Legacy Effects provided creature designs and effects for the aliens. The alien costume featured an animatronic head, remotely controlled by three people. The suit was hot even in cold areas, and had to be unzipped to let Doug Jones cool off between takes. The costume was <b>enhanced</b> <b>with</b> CGI in a number of ways, including replacing arms and dilating pupils (which Schaffer thought made the creature seem more alive).|$|E

Some {{of the effects}} created by Lazur would rely on software programming rather than the Nintendo 64 hardware, as the latter would not be capable of rendering them directly. The second mode would be a full 3D mode played in either regular or high display resolution, and would feature different level of detail textures depending on camera distances, to maximize clarity and performance. Both modes {{would be in a}} top-down perspective, although more cinematic camera angles, similar to those from , were also considered for the 3D mode.|$|E

The score was to consist in arrangements of the official Chrono Trigger soundtrack written by Yasunori Mitsuda, Nobuo Uematsu and Noriko Matsueda. Valente's goal was to retain the feeling of the original music while enhancing it for a modern platform. Most of the arrangements were created in the Impulse Tracker format, then converted to MIDI and <b>enhanced</b> <b>with</b> a number of tools.|$|E
5|$|Banking {{operations}} in Hampshire County ceased throughout {{the duration of}} the American Civil War, and a new banking institution was not established in Romney until 1888. By September of that year, a coordinated effort by Romney's leading citizens amassed subscriptions for the entirety of the initial offering of 300 shares of stock for the establishment of the Bank of Romney. The shareholders of the Bank of Romney petitioned the Secretary of State of West Virginia for a charter with capital stock totaling 30,000 USD. Following the state's approval of its charter, the Bank of Romney commenced its {{operations in}} the Wirgman Building on December 20, 1888. The bank occupied two rented rooms on the Wirgman Building's first floor, which it shared with a pharmacy. The bank initially used a safe as its bank vault and security for the bank was provided by a nightwatchman who slept in one of the bank office's two rooms. The Wirgman Building's security was further <b>enhanced</b> <b>with</b> the installation of wire mesh glass and bars in the windows. During the bank's residency at the Wirgman Building, Henry Bell Gilkeson served as the bank's president. The Bank of Romney began to outgrow its spaces {{on the first floor of}} the Wirgman Building almost immediately after its incorporation, and in 1906 it moved across Main Street to a new bank building.|$|E

Solid parts of the tumor often <b>enhance</b> <b>with</b> contrast MRI finding on T1 and T2 weighted images are variable.
