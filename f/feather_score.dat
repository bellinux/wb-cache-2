40|$|Feather pecking still {{presents}} {{a major problem}} in organic laying hen farming. In order to identify important risk factors during the laying period as well as during the rearing period in an exploratory epidemiological approach, we followed birds from 23 organic rearing units in Austria and Germany to 46 laying units. Management and housing conditions were recorded during one day visits in the 16 th to 18 th and 30 th to 40 th week of age, respectively. As an indicator of feather pecking, feather conditions of random samples of 30 hens per laying farm were assessed. Average feather scores from 0 (best) to 3 (worst) were calculated. The average score of 0. 73 (± 0. 44) was not significantly different from the score of 0. 77 (± 0. 33) from 54 conventional farms assessed in the same way (p= 0. 247). 73 % of the total variance in <b>feather</b> <b>score</b> between the different organic farms could be explained by 6 variables. About 79 % of the explained variation was due to rearing conditions. The major risk factors for poor plumage were little elevated perch space, few drinking places and no regular scattering of grain during the rearing period, as well as poor litter quality during the laying period. It is concluded that these are feasible starting points for improved prevention strategies against feather pecking...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT Four {{experiments}} {{were conducted to}} compare productivity, nervousness, feather condition, and livability of cage- and floor-reared White Leghorn layers when kept as adults in several environments. In Experiment 1, productivity and livability data were obtained on layers of an experimental stock kept 7 per cage at 332 cm 2 per bird. Age at first egg of cage-reared birds was 5. 3 days younger than that of floor-reared birds. In Experiments 2 and 3, layers of three experimental stocks were kept 6 per cage at 387 cm 2 per bird (Experiment 2) or 20 per floor pen at 1, 800 cm 2 per bird (Experiment 3). In general rearing environment effects and interactions of rearing environments with genetic stock and ages were absent for productivity traits and mortality of hens kept in either cages or floor pens. Floor- and cage-reared layers of three commercial stocks, kept 4 per cage at 348, 464, and 580 cm 2 per bird, were compared in Experiment 4. Cage-reared hens had better feather coverage than floor-reared ones at 57 to 60 wk of age. Rearing environment by genetic stock or by density interactions were generally absent. A negative correlation (r =-. 4) was found between nervousness score and <b>feather</b> <b>score.</b> It was concluded that pullets reared in either cages or floor pens {{should be able to}} adapt equally well to multiple-bird cages or low-density floor pens as adults...|$|E

40|$|Feather {{damaging}} {{behavior is}} one of the most challenging behavioral problems in captive parrots. Several therapeutic options have been proposed and to evaluate the effectiveness of these treatments a reliable and valid way of evaluating feather damaging behavior is needed. The aim of this study was to examine the intra- and inter-observer reliability of the <b>feather</b> <b>scoring</b> method by Meehan and the <b>feather</b> <b>scoring</b> method by Van Zeeland. Photographs of 15 Grey parrots were selected. For the intra-observer reliability 10 parrots were assessed twice by 5 students and 6 specialists. For the inter-observer reliability 10 students and 7 specialists have assessed the photographs of all the 15 parrots. Intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC[2, 1] and ICC[2,k]) with 95 % confidence intervals, standard error of measurement and the minimum difference to be considered real were calculated. An independent-samples t-test was conducted to compare ICC [2, 1] and [2,k] values for the intra- and inter-observer reliability of both scoring methods. The intra- and inter-observer reliability was very high for both <b>scoring</b> methods. The <b>feather</b> <b>scoring</b> method by Van Zeeland showed a significantly higher ICC[2, 1] and ICC[2,k] for the intra-observer reliability and a significantly higher ICC[2, 1] for the inter-observer reliability.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the effects of age on pecking behaviour and plumage quality of free-range laying hens during first access to range. Six hundred 16 -week-old layer pullets obtained from a commercial company were housed in a experimental free-range house. The experimental house consisted of a slat-and-litter floor with range area and was divided into three similar pens. The pullets were randomly assigned to a control and two experimental groups according to age at first access to range area. The birds were allowed into the range area for the first time at 18, 20 and 22 weeks of age in the groups of treatment I, treatment II and control, respectively. Pecking behaviour and plumage quality of the birds were measured for 8 -week intervals from 24 to 48 weeks of age. Total feather damage significantly increased with age in all groups (P P P < 0. 001). Compared to the control group, birds allowed into the range area earlier had less feather damage. The <b>feather</b> <b>score</b> of the tail body region in all groups was significantly greater (more damage) than in the others (P < 0. 001). There were no significant differences for the total pecking behaviour of the birds in the groups at 24, 32, 40 and 48 weeks of age. Incidents of gentle feather pecking in every period were more frequent, while aggressive pecking was less frequent (P P P < 0. 001). It can be said that access to range area as early as possible at the beginning of the laying period may be useful to reduce the negative effect of feather pecking in free-range layer chickens...|$|E
40|$|A {{series of}} trials were {{conducted}} {{to determine the effect}} of feeding barley silage to laying hens and broiler breeder pullets on performance, stress and behaviour. In the first study, two trials were conducted each with 20 hens and 2 roosters (n= 176) {{randomly assigned to one of}} 8 community cages. The birds in 4 cages were provided with a nutritionally balanced soy/wheat–based laying hen diet ad libitum, whereas the birds in another 4 cages were given free access to barley silage in addition to the regular laying hen diet. In both trials, the control birds consumed more feed (P 0. 05) were found in regards to egg quality, egg production and bird weights at various ages; however yolk colour was darker by silage treatment in each trial. At the end of each trial, the <b>feather</b> <b>score</b> was improved in silage-fed birds compared to the control birds. It was concluded that feeding barley silage as a supplement to laying hens can improve their welfare without negatively affecting the egg production and egg quality. A second study was conducted to determine the effect of feeding barley silage on body weight, stereotypic behaviour, stress and fear on broiler breeder pullets during the brooding and rearing periods. The 3 week old broiler breeder pullets (n= 180) were randomly allocated into 12 straw litter floor pens having 15 birds per pen. The birds in 6 pens were provided with a nutritionally balanced corn/oat-soybean/canola meal-based broiler breeder diet at recommended restricted levels, whereas the birds in another 6 pens were given free access to barley silage in addition to a regular broiler breeder diet. Total DM intake was significantly higher (P < 0. 05) for silage-fed birds compared to their control counterparts without affecting mean body weights. Dietary treatment had no significant effect on bird behaviour with the exception of object pecking behaviour which was reduced with silage feeding. Aggressive and gentle feather pecking behaviour was consistently numerically higher in the control birds than the silage-fed birds, although not significantly. Age affected many of the behaviours recorded in this study. Silage feeding had no significant effect on heterophil to lymphocyte ratios and tonic immobility values indicating that birds in both treatments were not very stressed or fearful.

40|$|Social stress {{resulting}} from varied group sizes and stocking density in caged systems and social disruption {{is a common}} problem that impacts bird welfare in the poultry industry in the United States. To examine {{whether there is a}} genetic basis of variations in response to group size and density, and social disruption, two genetic strains of White Leghorn hens were used in this study; a line selected for high group productivity and survivability in multiple-bird cages referred to as HGPS and Dekalb XL (DXL), a commercial line individually selected for production. To examine the effects of increased group size and stocking density effects, birds from each line were housed in either 4 -bird cages (542 cm 2 /bird) or 10 -bird cages (434 cm 2 /bird) from 17 to 60 wk of age. Blood and brain samples and body and organ weights were collected from the birds at 30, 45, and 60 wk. To examine the effects of increased group size and social disruption birds from each line were housed in either 4 -bird cages (542 cm 2 /bird) or 8 -bird cages (542 cm 2 /bird) from 50 to 58 wk of age. Two hens from the 8 -bird cages were moved once a week to create social disruption. Blood and brain samples and body and organ weights were collected from the birds at 58 wk of age. In response to increased group size and density, the unique changes of T subpopulations and the ratio of CD 4 +:CD 8 + suggest that the HGPS birds had greater cell-mediated immunity than DXL birds. There were no genetic or genetic-environment interaction effects on the serotonergic system in the hypthothalmus or Raphe nuclei. Increased group size and density altered dopamine turnover. In response social disruption, the HGPS hens had lower mortality and better <b>feather</b> <b>score</b> than the DXL hens. Social disruption increased adrenal weights and stimulated the immune system in both the HGPS and DXL hens. The results indicate that there were no genetic basis of variations in the concentrations of peripheral tryptophan, serotonin, epinephrine, norepinephrine, and dopamine in response to social disruption. In the Raphe nuclei, the HGPS hens may have a higher serotonin turnover. In the hypothalamus, compared with its relative controls, social disruption led to a lower serotonin turnover in the hypothalamus. In the Raphe nuclei, epinephrine increased in the DXL birds, while the HGPS hens had decreased dihydroxyphenylacetic acid and dopamine turnover post social disruption. The data suggest that selection for docile behaviors and productivity in poultry, such as the hens of the HGPS line, alters hens’ serotonergic and catecholamine homeostasis in the central nervous system in response to increased group size and cage density as well as social disruption. These changes are consistent with the line’s unique behavioral characteristics and capability to cope with their housing environments. ...|$|E
40|$|This study {{evaluated}} {{the effects of}} strain, stocking density and dietary energy level on the feathering of broiler chickens. Four trials were carried out between September 2000 and April 2002. There were 10, 685 broiler chicks from the strains Ross 308, Cobb 500, Hybro PG, Hubbard, MPK, and Isa Vedette. The bids were reared at stocking densities varying between 10 and 16 birds/m² and were given diets containing different metabolizable energy levels. Broiler feathering was evaluated either by atrributing scores from 1 to 10 to feather covering along the thigh and back (visual inspection), or by determining the percentage weight of the feathers at 28 and 42 days of age. Increasing rearing densities resulted in poorer feathering, mainly if 12 or 13 birds/m² were compared with 16 birds/m². The strains showed different feathering; it was better in Cobb 500 and MPK birds, whereas Hubbard birds showed poorer feathering, mostly along the back. The energy level in the diet has also affected <b>feathering</b> <b>scores.</b> Medium energy level resulted in better feathering along the back at 28 days, and the low level, in better feathering along the thigh at 35 days of age.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to compare zinc sources and levels of supplementation on laying hen performance. Bovan White Leghorn hens were fed one of six dietary treatments in a 2 x 3 factorial arrangement consisting of two zinc sources (Availa®Zn or zinc sulfate) and three levels (40, 80, or 120 ppm). Treatments were randomly assigned to 48 cages with five hens/cage. Blocks provided eight replicates/treatment. Hens were housed in a tiered manure belt housing system providing 97. 2 cm 2 /hen. Hens were given 110 g/hen/day of feed ad libitum. Feed intake, egg production, egg weights, egg components, eggshell strength, body weight, bone mineral density, keel bone scores, manure zinc content, and <b>feather</b> <b>scores</b> were measured. Data were analyzed using the Proc Glimmix procedure in SAS. No significant treatment effects were found for feed intake, egg production, feed conversion ratio, body weight gain, egg weight, percent eggshell, bone mineral density, or prevalence of keel bone injury. The 80 ppm level of zinc resulted in significantly greater (P= 0. 048) eggshell breaking strength during months 5 and 7 regardless of source. Hens fed Availa®Zn had higher percent yolk (P= 0. 050) and lower percent albumen (P= 0. 031) compared to hens fed zinc sulfate. There was a significant overall source effect (P 3 ̆c 0. 0001) for manure zinc content such that hens fed zinc sulfate had lower amounts of zinc excretion. There was a significant level effect (P 3 ̆c 0. 0001) where hens consuming 120 ppm zinc excreted the greatest amount of zinc. A significant source by level interaction was observed (P 3 ̆c 0. 0001) for both the overall and individual analyses such that 120 ppm Availa®Zn showed the highest zinc excretion and both 40 ppm zinc sulfate and Availa®Zn showed the lowest zinc excretion. Hens fed 80 ppm zinc sulfate had significantly improved <b>feather</b> <b>scores</b> (P= 0. 031) over all other treatments, while hens fed 120 ppm Availa®Zn had the lowest <b>feather</b> <b>scores.</b> Based on these results Availa®Zn may improve eggshell breaking strength and percent egg yolk.

40|$|Feather pecking {{has been}} {{controlled}} in the laying hen industry through {{methods such as}} beak trimming, breeding low feather pecking lines, providing enrichment items, and altering diets to promote satiety. Two {{recent studies have shown}} the positive impact of feeding silage (a relatively low nutrient feed item) in addition to (or as supplement) a nutritionally balanced hen ration in terms of decreased aggressive and feather pecking behaviour and improved <b>feather</b> <b>score.</b> The objectives of this thesis were to determine which specific characteristic(s) hens prefer, and if the preferred characteristics were responsible for improving hen welfare. Initial experiments consisted of a preference test, which provided a supplement in a removable insert in front of half a cage, and a balanced ration in the other half. In the first experiment, hens were shown to have a locational preference in the feed trough, not resulting from the presence of the insert, nor from intraspecific competition. Experiment two tested the preference for an ensiled or non-ensiled, and moist or dry material using barley greens, dried barley greens, barley silage, and dried barley silage. Results indicated that hens show preference for moist, non-ensiled materials, but ensiled materials are not rejected. Further investigations took place focusing on physical characteristics as experiment two results suggested a preference for unfermented products. Experiment three examined the provision of a forage-able substrate which was edible (wet or dry barley) or not (plastic lace), and found that edible materials increase the time spent at the feeder. Experiment four tested the preference for particle size of various edible materials (oats, silage and alfalfa) and found hens spend more time with smaller particles sizes of silage and oat materials. The final experiment (Experiment five) used a supplement with all preferred characteristics (wet pea fibre) to determine its impact on feather pecking in birds housed in conventional and enriched cages. Birds given supplemental material did not increase time spent at the feeder, and feathers showed no more or less wear than would be expected from the housing system. Vent scores (areas typically affected by pecking) tended to improve under the presence of pea fibre. Feather pecking decreased when hens were offered pea fibre when housed in large group and enriched cages. Decreased body weight, heavier gizzards, and improved feed efficiency (balanced feed per dozen eggs) point towards improved digestive efficiencies with consumed fibre, even though elongation of the ileum and jejunum seem to contradict this hypothesis. While highly preferred, moist, non-ensiled, low nutrient pea fibre did not impact hen welfare to the degree seen in previous studies with silage. However, similar feedstuffs are still a possible means of enrichment to reduce feather pecking and increase welfare in laying hens, and future research should continue with different bird strains and materials for enrichment, as well as examining hen digestive efficiencies and effects on production costs...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: As {{laying hens}} {{continue}} to improve in egg characteristics, it is relevant to examine their response to dietary digestible balanced protein (DBP). Research using Lohmann-LSL hens, from 27 to 66 wk of age, compared DBP intake levels using diets with essential amino acids (AA) balanced to digestible lysine (Dlys) intake levels of 550, 625, 700, 775 and 850 mg/hen/day. Each treatment was replicated 10 times with 12 birds per replicate. Two base diets containing 500 or 850 mg of Dlys per 100 g of diet were blended every three wk based on previous feed intakes to produce diets that would provide treatment levels of Dlys intake. Data collection included daily hen-day egg production (HDEP), and feed intake (FI), egg weight (EW), egg mass (EM), feed efficiency (FE) and egg specific gravity (ESG) every three wk. Hens were weighed and scored for feather cover at 27, 47 and 66 wk of age. Egg components were measured at 41, 52 and 65 wk of age, including albumen height (AH), dry egg shell weight (ESW), and albumen and yolk weights (AW and YW). At {{the end of the}} experiment, pectoralis muscle (PM), abdominal fat pad (AFP), heart, liver and kidneys were collected from 10 randomly euthanized hens per treatment and weighed. Empty weight and length of gastrointestinal tract (GIT) segments were also measured. Excreta samples were collected twice from five randomly selected cages per treatment to determine total excreta nitrogen (N) content. In a completely randomized experimental design, the data were analyzed using one-way ANOVA as mixed model and by using PROC regression and PROC response surface regression procedures of SAS 9. 3 (2003). Differences in means were considered significant when P ≤ 0. 05. The effect of increasing DBP on hen weight, HDEP, EW, EM, FI and FE was quadratic. By using a non-linear regression model, a maximum response for HDEP, EW, EM and FE was observed at 769, 836, 903 and 839 mg/h/d intake of Dlys, respectively. Increasing Dlys levels increased AFP weight linearly and PM weight increased quadratically. Heart, liver and kidney weights were not affected by Dlys intake. Proventriculus absolute weight was increased while gizzard weight decreased linearly with increasing Dlys intakes. Intestinal segment weights decreased linearly or quadratically with increasing Dlys intake. Caeca measurements were not affected by the treatment. <b>Feather</b> <b>score</b> increased with Dlys intake level. Both percent ESW and ESG decreased linearly with increasing intake levels of Dlys. Absolute AW (linear) and YW (quadratic) increased with Dlys intake; proportional values for these criteria were affected in a quadratic manner, but the effects were small. Excreta N content increased in a quadratic manner with increasing amino acid intake. In conclusion, the response of Lohmann-LSL hens to DBP was determined and the DBP (based on diets with essential AA balanced to Dlys) level required to maximize the response varied with the criteria being assessed.

40|$|From 2007 – 2008, data {{on animal}} {{health and welfare}} and farm {{management}} during rearing and laying periods were collected from 49 flocks of organic laying hens in the Netherlands. Our aim was to investigate how organic egg farms performed in terms of {{animal health and welfare}} and which farm factors affected this performance. The flocks in our study were kept on farms with 34 to 25, 000 hens (average 9, 300 hens). Seventy-one percent of the flocks consisted of ‘silver hybrids’: white hens that lay brown eggs. Fifty-five percent of the flocks were kept in floor-based housing and 45 % of the flocks in aviaries. No relation was found between {{the amount of time spent}} outdoors during the laying period and mortality at 60 weeks. Flocks that used their outdoor run more intensively had better feather scores. In 40 % of the flocks there was mortality caused by predators. The average feed intake was 129 g/day at 30 weeks and 133 g/day at 60 weeks of age. The average percentage of mislaid eggs decreased from three at 30 weeks to two at 60 weeks. The average mortality was 7. 8 % at 60 weeks. Twenty-five percent of the flocks were not treated for worms in their first 50 weeks. Flubenol© was applied to the flocks that were treated. Ten percent of the flocks followed Flubenol© instructions for use and were wormed five or more times. The other 65 % percent were treated irregularly between one and four times. Sixty-eight percent of the flocks showed little or no feather damage, 24 % showed moderate damage and 8 % showed severe damage. The <b>feather</b> <b>score</b> was better if the hens used the free-range area more intensely, the laying percentage at 60 weeks was higher, and if they were allowed to go outside sooner after arrival on the laying farm. In 69 % of the flocks, hens had peck wounds in the vent area: on average this was 18 % of the hens. Keel bone deformations were found in all flocks, on average in 21 % of the birds. In 78 % of the flocks, an average of 13 % of the hens had foot-sole wounds, mostly a small crust. Combs were darker in flocks that used the range area more intensively. More fearful flocks had lighter combs. We conclude that organic farms are potentially more animal friendly than other poultry systems based on the animal welfare benefits of the free range areas. However, we also observed mortality rates, internal parasites, keel bone deformities, and foot sole lesions on organic farms that were comparable to or worse than in other husbandry systems. It is unclear whether these ‘remaining’ problems can be attributed to housing or if they are the result of keeping high productive genotypes in an artificial environment. Organic farms use the same high productive genotypes as other husbandry systems...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT When raw {{dried egg}} white (RDEW) {{was the source of}} protein for chicks fed a 6 or 30 ppm zinc diet for 21 days, lack of {{feathering}} and poor weight gains occurred, despite a level of biotin 14 times the requirement, in contrast to chicks fed RDEW cooked at 80 C. Variations in source and type of chick, source of egg white, and the main source of energy were made in an attempt to correct these conditions. When zinc was limiting and sucrose was the source of energy, consistent differences in growth between RDEW and CDEW-chicks were not found for either Leghorn or broiler-type chicks. When zinc was high, CDEW-chicks were significantly improved in weight and feathering than RDEW-chicks, regardless of type or source of chick or source of egg white. When dextrin was fed, the <b>feather</b> <b>scores</b> of all RDEW-fed chicks were significantly im-proved. Those of low-zinc chicks did not differ significantly from CDEW-chicks fed sucrose. When zinc was not limiting, CDEW + sucrose chicks were significantly larger in weight and lower in <b>feather</b> <b>scores</b> than RDEW + dextrin chicks and did not differ from chicks on casein-based diets. These experiments do not pinpoint the reason for the poor performance of chicks fed RDEW plus 30 ppm Zn diets but suggest that when RDEW is used as a protein source for young chicks, another protein source should also be fed to check the growth potential of the chicks...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background An {{association}} study between {{single nucleotide}} polymorphism markers (SNP) and (innate and adaptive) immune parameters but also <b>feather</b> condition <b>score</b> on the back, rump and belly of laying hens was performed. The immune parameters measured in blood samples were natural and acquired antibody titers and complement activity. <b>Feather</b> condition <b>score</b> {{as a measure of}} feather damage was determined, this parameter is closely related to feather pecking behavior in hens housed in groups. The aim {{of the study was to}} detect associations between genetic markers and immune parameters and <b>feather</b> condition <b>score</b> across nine lines of laying hens, focusing on the feather peckers as well as on the victims of feather pecking. Methods A novel approach based on across-line analysis and testing of the SNP-by-line interaction was performed. Results In total 59 significant associations between SNP and immune traits were detected. Previously identified QTL were confirmed and new associations of genes regulating immune function identified. The IL 17 A gene (chromosome 3) influences natural and acquired antibody titers and activation of classical and alternative complement pathways. The major histocompatibility complex on chromosome 16 showed significant association with natural and acquired antibody titers and classical complement activity. The IL 12 B and IRF 1 genes on chromosome 13 were associated with natural antibody titers. The direct effect of the genotype of an individual on its feather condition and the associative effect of the genotype of the cage mates on the individual’s feather condition were analyzed. The direct genetic effect can be described as the susceptibility to be pecked at, and the associative genetic effect as the propensity to perform feather pecking. Eleven significant associations were detected for the direct effect, and 81 for the associative effect. The serotonin receptor 2 C (HTR 2 C) on chromosome 4 was highlighted in both analyses. Conclusions Our results confirmed previously identified QTL and identified new associations of genes regulating immune function. The results for <b>feather</b> condition <b>score</b> supports existing evidence of involvement of the serotonergic system in feather pecking in laying hens.

To study these effects, eggs were set in a commercial incubator either in the dark control or under full spectrum light tubes (Philips TL 95, 36 watt).

A population of 662 hens was genotyped for 1536 SNPs of which 1022 could be used for the association study. The analysis was conducted across 9 different lines of White Leghorn and Rhode Island Red origin. Across lines linkage disequilibrium is conserved at shorter distances than within lines; therefore, SNPs significantly associated with <b>feather</b> condition <b>score</b> across lines are expected to be closer to the functional mutations. The SNPs that had a significant across-line effect but did not show significant SNP-by-line interaction were identified, to test that the association was consistent across lines. Both the direct effect of the individual’s genotype on its plumage condition, and the associative effect of the genotype of the cage mates on the individual’s plumage condition were analysed. The direct genetic effect can be considered as the susceptibility to be pecked at, whereas the associative genetic effect can be interpreted as the propensity to perform feather pecking. Finally, 11 significant associations between SNPs and behavioural traits were detected in the direct model, and 81 in the associative model. A role of the gene for the serotonin receptor 2 C (HTR 2 C) on chromosome 4 was found. This supports existing evidence of a prominent involvement of the serotonergic system in the modulation of this behavioural disorder in laying hens. The genes for IL 9, IL 4, CCL 4 and NFKB were found to be associated to plumage condition, revealing relationships between the immune system and behaviour...|$|R
50|$|Against {{the rival}} Tennessee, Alabama was {{defeated}} by the Volunteers, 7-3 at Legion Field in rainy conditions. Alabama scored its only points of the game when Hillman Holley connected on a 12-yard field goal {{in the second quarter}} to take a 3-0 lead. Alabama held their lead through the fourth quarter when Johnny Cain had a punt of only 12-yards from his own endzone to give Tennessee the ball at the 12-yard line. Three plays later, Beattie <b>Feathers</b> <b>scored</b> on a seven-yard touchdown run and with the extra point, the Volunteers took a 7-3 lead that they would not relinquish. Due to the poor weather conditions, the game was noted for both Alabama head coach Thomas and Tennessee head coach Robert Neyland calling for punt after punt, often on first and second down, in an attempt to gain field position advantage. As a result, Feathers punted 21 times for Tennessee, and Cain punted 19 times for Alabama. Cain's 19 punts and 914 total yards still stand as the single game school records for punts and punting yardage. The loss brought Alabama's all-time record against Tennessee 9-5-1.|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT Three {{experiments}} {{were conducted to}} study early growth, feed and water intake, feed efficiency, abdominal fat, and feathering in commercial broilers (C) and unselected (AC) chickens fed high-protein (P) or high-energy (E) diets. Commercial birds were heavier, consumed more feed and water, had better feed efficiency, higher abdominal fat levels, and poorer <b>feather</b> <b>scores</b> than AC birds. Body weights of C birds fed the E diet were, in general, greater than BW of contemporaries fed the P diet. However, AC body weights did not respond in a similar manner. Feed intake patterns {{were similar to those}} for BW. Water intake and water to feed ratio values were consistently greater in both AC and C birds fed the P diet. The C birds had higher percentages of abdominal fat than AC birds, and C birds fed the E diet had higher abdominal fat (89 %) than those fed the P diet; the difference was only 33 % in the AC stock and this resulted in significant (P<. 05) stock by diet interactions. Diet had little influence on feathering in AC birds, whereas C birds that received the E diet had significantly (P<OS) poorer feathering than those that received the P diet.

40|$|Definition of the problem: Imitated {{natural light}} {{conditions}} during the artificial incubation may influence pullets' behaviour in being {{adapted to the}} diurnal rhythm. Methodology: To study these effects, eggs were set in a commercial incubator either in the dark control or under full spectrum light tubes (Philips TL 95, 36 watt). To imitate the light changes by a clucking hen, the eggs were exposed to light for twelve hours a day with a light-intensity of 20 lux. After six hours there was a step-up in light intensity to 1000 lux for 20 minutes. After the incubation period, at day 18 of incubation, all eggs were transferred to the hatching compartments. After hatching, the chickens were reared in paired groups under Swiss organic standards. Each group, containing 1000 pullets, was observed {{at the age of}} 2, 4, 8 and 10 weeks in 5 trials. Several categories of behaviour, activity and the diurnal rhythm were observed (scan sampling). Hatchability per cent, mortality, weight and <b>feather</b> <b>scoring</b> at the age of 10 weeks were recorded. Results, conclusion, state of the art: There is no constant significance that light exposure during the incubation period affects the diurnal rhythm and behaviour of young laying hens. It seems to be, that the rearing conditions and management are still more important...|$|R
40|$|With an {{estimated}} prevalence of 10 - 15 %, feather damaging behaviour (FDB) {{is a common}} behavioural disorder in captive parrots (in particular Grey parrots, the species studied in this thesis) that may have aesthetic, medical and welfare consequences and often results in relinquishment or euthanasia. Little evidence-based information, however, {{is available on the}} aetiology, associated risk factors, preventive and/or therapeutic interventions. A review of the literature identified many similarities between FDB in parrots, feather pecking in laying hens and trichotillomania in humans and suggested new focus areas for studies into FDB in parrots, which concern both environmental (extrinsic) and animal-bound (intrinsic) factors. First, however, a new <b>feather</b> <b>scoring</b> system was developed for evaluating changes in plumage condition. When compared to an existent <b>feather</b> <b>scoring</b> system, this novel system resulted in higher absolute and relative intra- and inter-observer reliabilities, rendering it useful for monitoring changes in plumage (and FDB) in response to preventive or therapeutic interventions. Environmental enrichment may be an effective tool to reduce FDB. In particular the provision of foraging enrichment is important, as indicated by the presence of contrafreeloading [CFL] in Grey parrots, which demonstrates that parrots are motivated to work for food in presence of free food. The effect of currently available foraging enrichments, however, is too limited to increase foraging times to levels comparable to that of wild conspecifics. These findings emphasize the necessity to develop more effective foraging strategies, but gaining insight into the value of other types of enrichment may be just as important. For this purpose, a closed-economy, two-chamber set-up was designed, which appears promising to establish parrots’ motivation to gain access to different enrichments, thereby allowing for specific recommendations to be made regarding the captive parrot’s living environment. Interestingly, feather damaging parrots were less motivated to work for food compared to healthy individuals, suggesting alterations in their behaviour and ‘needs’. This finding stresses the importance for studies into potential intrinsic factors involved in FDB. Behavioural tests demonstrated that feather damaging parrots display a proactive coping style, suggesting that temperamental traits {{may play a role in}} the development of FDB. In addition, neurotransmitters such as serotonin may be involved. To obtain evidence supporting its role, the efficacy of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (e. g. paroxetine) in the treatment of FDB may be studied. A pharmacokinetic study helped to establish a dosing regimen (twice daily 4 mg/kg paroxetine HCl dissolved in water, orally) which may subsequently be used in double-blinded, randomised, placebo-controlled clinical trials. The current studies focused on the behaviour and needs of (feather damaging) Grey parrots and laid a basis to further elucidate the role of various intrinsic and extrinsic factors in the onset and maintenance of FDB, and evaluate new therapeutic and preventive interventions that are currently under development...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT Two {{experiments}} compared performance traits, feather loss, and nervousness of hens kept in contrasting homogeneous and heterogeneous {{body weight}} groupings. In addition, 15 -day periods of daily uterine palpating vs nonpalpating for an egg in the uterus were compared for effects on egg production. Eighteen-wk-old pullets were weighed and characterized as light, medium, or heavy and housed in laying cages at 19 wk for a 50 -wk production period. In Experiment 1, two hens {{were placed in}} each cage and there were three treatment groups: both light (L), mixed or 1 heavy and 1 light (X), and both heavy (H). In Experiment 2, three pullets were used per cage; a medium-weight group (M) was included and mixed cages included 1 heavy, 1 medium, and 1 light weight bird. In an ancillary experiment, 50 -wk-old hens were also palpated or not palpated for an egg in the uterus over a single 15 -day period. Results indicated that differences that were present in initial body weight groups persisted over the 50 -wk period in Experiments 1 and 2 with no effect of weight grouping on body weight gain, egg production, and livability. Differences that were associated with weight groups were: age at sexual maturity, egg weight, egg mass, and nervousness score. No differences in mean <b>feather</b> <b>scores</b> were present among weight groups. Comparisons between individual hens of the same relative weight but kept in homogeneous or heterogene-ous weight groups failed to indicate competitive advantages or disadvantages in egg production, feathering...|$|R
40|$|An {{experiment}} {{was carried out}} to compare the body weight. shank lenght, rectal temperature, comb area, abdominal fat, blood parameters and bone traits of capon, slip and intact birds in Taiwan country chicken cockerels. One hundred and sixty-six Taiwan country chicken cockerels {{were randomly assigned to}} caponized or intact male groups. Caponized birds were surgically altered at 10 weeks old and raised to 28 weeks old. At 28 weeks of age, the capons were separated into capon and slip groups, depending oil the atrophy of the comb and wattle in size. The results showed that body weight and shank length in slips were significantly (p < 0. 05) greater than in intact birds. Intact birds had the highest (p < 0. 05) <b>feather</b> <b>scores</b> and the lowest (p < 0. 05) rectal temperature. Compared with intact birds and slips, capons had a significantly (p < 0. 05) smaller comb area. Bone percentage. stress and cortical thickness, and bone and ash calcium content and plasma testosterone concentration, in intact birds were the highest (p < 0. 05) followed by slips and capons. Ho However, intact birds had the lowest (p < 0. 05) plasma ionized calcium and phosphorus concentrations. Bone and ash manganese contents in capons were significantly (p < 0. 05) low-er than those in others. These findings support the hypothesis that androgenic effects on secondary Sexual characteristics are stronger than anabolic growth promoting response.

40|$|ABSTRACT Two {{experiments}} were done involving moderately inbred strains known to differ in escape and avoidance behavior. Hens of those strains {{and of a}} cross between them (second experiment only) were compared for fear-related behavior, feather damage and loss, and productivity traits when housed four or eight/cage at densities of 348 (high), 464 (medium), and 580 (low) cm 2 /bird. Hens that died were replaced. Strain cross hens {{did not differ from}} parental strain hens in nervousness, <b>feathering</b> <b>scores,</b> or survival, but exhibited hybrid vigor for rate of lay, egg weight, daily egg mass, and age at sexual maturity. Density, but not group size, affected rate of lay, daily egg mass, and percentage survival. Hens in high density cages were adversely affected but those in medium and low density cages did not differ from each other. Nervousness and feather loss were influenced adversely and stepwise by higher densities, and hens in cages of eight were more nervous and had greater feather loss and damage than those in low density cages. There were no interactions between stock and density or group size for any of the traits measured. However, there was an interaction of stock with age period for both egg weight and daily egg mass. Strain cross hens had an advantage over parental hens during the earlier part of the laying year because of their earlier maturity and relatively heavier egg weights during that period. There was an interaction between density and group size for rate of lay and egg mass during the second and larger scale experiment only; hens in eight-bird cages performed at lower levels than did hens in four-bird cages only when kept at high density. There was a strong interaction between density, but not group size, and age; adverse effects of the high-density cage environment became more evident as time passed...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT Variation of {{behavior}} among hens and the relationships {{of behavior}} to measures of production and physical condition were investigated. The birds were 384 pullets from the mating of two stocks of males, obtained from a commercial breeder, to females from a third flock. The birds were housed as pairs in laying cages at 22 and 20 wk of age (Hatches 1 and 2, respectively). The laying phase was divided into 28 -day periods. In Periods 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, and 11, samples of hens were video recorded for 8 h. In Period 13, direct visual observations were made {{of the behavior of}} individually identified hens. Eleven production-related variables were recorded throughout the laying phase. <b>Feather</b> <b>scores</b> were assessed in Periods 3, 6, 9, and 12. Body weight, lesions to the feet, and claw length were recorded in Periods 6 and 13. Spearman rank correlations were calculated between video-recorded behavioral variables and measures of production and physical condition. The data from direct visual observations were used for heritability estimates of behavioral traits. Eating and standing were positively correlated with egg production, whereas sitting and, for hens derived from male parental Stock 1, resting were negatively correlated with production. Inactivity also coincided with poorer plumage condition and higher body weight. For the offspring of male parental Stock 2, behavioral actions frequently performed in stereotyped manner, e. g., cage pecking and toe pecking, were positively associated with egg production. No significant additive genetic variation for behavior was evident among sires; however, for dams, fairly large heritability estimates occurred for a number of behavioral states. The apparent absence of additive genetic variability among sires for behavior may have been due to genetic fixation at gene loci which control behavior in the stocks acquired from the commercial breeder.

40|$|Concerns {{regarding}} {{the welfare of}} laying hens raised in battery cages {{have led to the}} development of enriched cages that allow hens to perform natural behaviors including nesting, roosting, and scratching. This study was conducted to compare indices of production and welfare in birds housed in 2 different caging systems. Shaver White hens were housed from 21 to 61 wk in either conventional battery cages (n = 500; 10 cages; 5 hens/cage; floor space = 561. 9 cm(2) /hen) or enriched cages (n = 480; 2 cages; 24 hens/cage; floor space = 642. 6 cm(2) /hen) and were replicated 10 times. Enriched cages provided hens with a curtained nesting area, scratch pad, and perches. Production parameters and egg quality measures were recorded throughout the experiment. Plumage condition was evaluated at 37 and 61 wk. Bone quality traits and immunological response parameters were measured at 61 wk, and 59 and 61 wk, respectively. Hen-day egg production, feed consumption, egg weight, and percentage of cumulative mortality of laying hens were not affected by the cage designs. Specific gravity and the percentage of cracked and soft-shelled eggs were also similar between the 2 housing systems. The incidence of dirty eggs was, however, significantly higher (P < 0. 0001) in enriched cages than in conventional cages. <b>Feather</b> <b>scores</b> were similar between birds except for the wing region, which was higher (P < 0. 05) for hens housed in conventional cages. Bone quality measures tended to be higher for hens housed in enriched cages compared with hens in conventional cages. However, the increase was significant only for bone mineral density. Immunological response parameters did not reveal statistically significant differences. Overall, laying performance, exterior egg quality measures, plumage condition, and immunological response parameters appear to be similar for hens housed in the 2 cage systems tested. Enrichment of laying hen cages resulted in better bone quality, which could have resulted from increased activity...|$|R

The trial {{was carried out in}} farm of the Dpt. of Applied Biology (University of Perugia),where 17 -weeks-old females of Ancona breed (n= 200) and Brown Hy-Line (n= 200) were divided in 2 homogenousgroups of 100 birds each and assigned to cage or organic rearing systems. The genotype of the hens affected in a degree which depends on rearing system almost all the variables. The feeding andresting activities were higher in caged whereas moving activities were higher in organic hens and especially in Anconabirds. Social relationships showed genotype and rearing system effects being higher in Brown Hy-Line hens particularlywhen reared in cage. The TI duration was affected by genotype and rearing system being the immobility time longer inBrown Hy-Line. The plumage condition showed a great rearing system effect and genotype effects was observed onlybetween organic groups where Ancona hens showed the better feathers condition. Regarding native immune status serumbactericidal activity showed the highest values in organic hens and mainly in Ancona ones. On the contrary, lysozymeshowed greater value in caged hens. The haptoglobin value was lower in organic Ancona group, the same hens showedabout 30 % greater reactive oxygen substances, but accompanied by highest the antioxidant power. Organic rearingsystem, mainly in the Ancona hens, induced the highest red blood cells, haemoglobin and hematocrite values. Lymphocytes were higher in Organic birds thus reducing the H/L ratio in Organic hens. As expected, organic birdsshowed the worst feed efficiency and percentage of deposition, but the lowest mortality rate. In conclusion, on the basis ofall these information together with the low mortality rate, Ancona hens showed the better welfare status, mainly whenthey were organically reared. [ [...] . ...|$|R
40|$|Abnormal behaviours, such as feather pecking, {{can become}} an even greater problem if they spread through the flock. Domestic hens are a social species {{and it has been}} {{suggested}} that feather pecking behaviour can be socially transmitted from few feather pecking individuals to many. The purpose of this experiment was to investigate whether feather pecking is transmitted from an experimental strain of high feather peckers to an experimental strain of low feather peckers when housed together. The effects of environment and age were also investigated. Four hundred and twenty chicks were housed in either cages or pens in one of three treatment groups; all high feather peckers, all low feather peckers, and a mixed group of half high feather peckers and half low feather peckers. During the rearing phase, severe and gentle feather pecks were recorded at 13 – 15 weeks and <b>feather</b> plumage <b>scored</b> at 12 and 17 weeks. At 17 weeks of age, the groups of mixed hens were removed from the study and the remaining hens resorted into the same three treatment groups.

There was significantly less feather pecking and plumage damage in the pens than in the cages. There was no evidence of severe feather pecking spreading from feather peckers to non-feather peckers, even when actual rates of feather pecking were examined rather than only considering the strain of hen. There was some evidence that gentle feather pecking was transmitted in laying hens housed in cages.

40|$|Because of {{a ban on}} the use of beak {{trimming}} in some European countries, feather pecking is becoming a substantial problem in the layer industry, both from animal welfare and economic points of view. The <b>feather</b> condition <b>score</b> (FCS) as a measure of feather damage {{has been shown to be}} closely related to feather pecking behavior in laying hens housed in groups. To obtain a better understanding of genetic and other biological mechanisms underlying feather pecking behavior, data on FCS of a population of 2, 724 female offspring from crossing 50 male W 1 and 907 female WB purebred lines were used. The offspring of 25 sires were beak-trimmed, and the offspring of another 25 sires were non-beak-trimmed. Titers of plasma natural antibody (NAb) isotypes IgM and IgG binding keyhole limpet hemocyanin at 24 wk of age were measured. <b>Feather</b> condition was <b>scored</b> at 53 wk of age. In the first part of the present study, we estimated genetic parameters for FCS with 2 variance components models: a traditional linear animal model and a model combining direct and associative genetic effects. In the second part of the present study, a trait-based analysis for FCS was conducted to investigate whether NAb isotype titers can explain variation in FCS among individuals, by fitting a linear mixed model. Though the estimated associative genetic variance was substantial, associative effects for FCS were not statistically significant in both populations (P = 0. 09 in beak-trimmed birds, and P = 0. 08 in non-beak-trimmed birds). This suggests an insufficient number of records on FCS.
