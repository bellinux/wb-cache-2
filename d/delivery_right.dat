40|$|Irrigation {{development}} and management in Zimbabwe {{like many other}} sub-Saharan countries has problems related to sustainability. These problems are of a socio-technical nature related to both physical artefacts and configuration of the water delivery continuum {{as well as the}} social, economic, regulatory, financial and other institutional factors that shape the management subsystem. Six schemes in the Save catchment of Manicaland province in Zimbabwe with different attributes related to water sources, mobilisation, conveyance, distribution, application and management were investigated for two cropping seasons in the period 1999 to 2000 to find out major elements that affected their sustainability.   The focused on the concept of teretechnology, that is the ability to care for artefacts. It looked at whether this concept was present in Zimbabwe. Two old gravity surface irrigation schemes of Chakowa and Deure were found to differ significantly due to system design and level of cooperation. Chakowa scheme had no source regulation, was vulnerable to summer floods and was structured in a way that allowed head-end farmers unlimited access to water at any time leading to serious head -end tail end problems that resulted in significant differences in cropping programs and patterns. In contrast Deure had a stabilised water source and cooperation that allowed farmers to practice across block water rotation through the distribution canal, cropping programs and patterns were similar and all farmers had access to a local niche market. This also translated to cooperation in operation and maintenance activities. At Mutema, a second-generation groundwater pumped conventional sprinkler scheme, poor water delivery due to power cuts and lack of repair resulted in salinity that lead to changes in cropping especially from vulnerable beans to mainly tomatoes and cotton. The need to save on electricity costs saw farmers at the new Musikavanhu pumped surface scheme with proportional water division structures and a more reliable water delivery system deliberately enforcing reduced water supplies to winter crops. The new pumped draghose sprinkler system at Bonde experienced unreliable water <b>delivery</b> <b>right</b> from commissioning. This led farmers to emulate the simple gravity surface practices at the Deure with which they share both a water source and abstraction. This is in contrast with the gravity draghose system at Mpudzi where farmers on the heavier soils are engaged in full time market gardening with their main problem centring on strategies to replace worn out sprinklers or reduce the rate sprinkler wear. In conclusion it is thus observed that farmers are primarily concerned with water delivery security, and can operate systems effectively that are simple. They maintain components that are within their capacity only to avoid disruption of delivery and that the institutions need support to enhance capacity to deal with complex systems. It is therefore recommended that future planning and design of water delivery subsystems consider the engineering precepts that take into account these teretechnology requirements to ensure that sustainable systems are developed such that the users can operate and maintain and using local resources and available managerial support structures from government and the private sector and other production related structures like markets to leverage the water delivery. </span...|$|E
40|$|Measurement {{of quality}} is an {{important}} area within the services sector. To date, most attempts at measurement have focussed on how external clients perceive the quality of services provided by organisations. Although recognising that relationships between providers within a service environment are important, {{little research has been}} conducted into the identification and measurement of internal service quality. This research focuses on the measurement of internal service quality dimensions in the complex service environment of an internal healthcare service chain. The concept of quality in healthcare continues to develop as various provider, patient and client, governmental, and insurance groups maintain an interest in how to 'improve' the quality of healthcare service management and delivery. This research is based in healthcare as a major area within the service sector. The service environment in a large hospital is complex, with multiple interactions occurring internally; health is a significant field of study from both technical and organisational perspectives providing specific prior research that may be used as a basis for, and extension into service quality; and the implications of not getting service <b>delivery</b> <b>right</b> in healthcare in terms of costs to patients, families, community, and the government are significant. There has been considerable debate into the nature, dimensionality, and measurement of service quality. The five dimensions of SERVQUAL (tangibles, assurance, reliability, responsiveness, and empathy) have become a standard for evaluations of service quality in external service encounters, although these have been challenged in the literature. As interest in internal service quality has grown, a number of researchers have suggested that external service quality dimensions apply to internal service quality value chains irrespective of industry. However, this transferability has not been proven empirically. This research examines the nature of service quality dimensions in an internal healthcare service network, how these dimensions differ from those used in external service quality evaluations, and how different groups within the internal service network evaluate service quality, using both qualitative and quantitative research. Two studies were undertaken. In the first of these, interviews with staff from four groups within an internal service chain were conducted. Using dimensions established through qualitative analysis of this data, Study Two then tested these dimensions through data collected in a survey of staff in a major hospital. This research confirms the hierarchical, multidirectional, and multidimensional nature of internal service quality. The direct transferability of external quality dimensions to internal service quality evaluations is only partially supported. Although dimension labels are similar to those used in external studies of service quality, the cross-dimensional nature of a number of these attributes and their interrelationships needs to be considered before adopting external dimensions to measure internal service quality. Unlike in previous studies, equity has also been identified as an important factor in internal service quality evaluations. Differences in service expectations between groups in the internal service chain, and differentiation of perceptions of dimensions used to evaluate others from those perceived used in evaluations by others were found. This has implications on formulation of future internal service quality instruments. For example, the expectations model of service quality is currently the dominant approach to conceptualising and developing service quality instruments. This study identifies a number of problems in developing instruments that consider differences in expectations between internal groups. Difficulty in evaluating the technical quality of services provided in internal service chains is also confirmed. The triadic nature of internal service quality evaluations in internal healthcare service chains and the problems associated with transferring the traditional dyadic measures of service quality are identified. The relationships amongst internal service workers and patients form these triads, with patient outcomes a significant factor in determining overall internal service quality, independent of technical quality. This thesis assists in supporting the development of measurement tools more suited to internal service chains, and will provide a stronger and clearer focus on overall determinants of internal service quality, with resultant managerial implications for managerial effectiveness...|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} is to assess any risk-shifting behavior in the catfish market between processors and farmers. Over 93 % of farm-raised catfish are sold through fish processing companies, and processors largely dictate the terms of trade, particularly size requirements. The classic agency theory model was used to investigate the relationship between catfish processors (principals) and catfish farmers (agents). The study used time-series regression techniques, incorporated into the classic principal-agent model, to examine the risk behavior of catfish processors. Results indicate that catfish processors do not shift risk, but bear all market risk. It appears that catfish processors maximize expected payoff by paying lower price to farmers and extract trade gains from bearing the market risks. Farmers may implicitly be paying high premiums by receiving lower prices. <b>Delivery</b> <b>rights</b> offered to catfish farmers as incentives for them to meet certain delivery conditions do not appear to have shifted risk.

She serves as primary Administrative and Technical contact person as well as Systems Administrator for the Libraries’ linking programme, UM Links (SFX). As the University of Manitoba Libraries (UML) collection of electronic journals rapidly increased it became evident that we needed a way to distribute Document Delivery license restrictions to designated library staff. Initially this done by providing Document Delivery staff with periodic spreadsheets listing individual publishers and the applicable license terms. In November 2003, UML implemented SFX. As expected, use of electronic journals increased rapidly, and had an immediate impact on many library units and departments, including Document Delivery. In the absence of a commercial ERM, the Electronic Resources Unit at UML developed a system for distributing the status of Document <b>Delivery</b> <b>rights</b> to designated library staff on a title by title basis using SFX. Using this application, designated staff are now able to enter Document Delivery requests into the SFX Citation Linker and find the current license terms and conditions for Document Delivery, in addition to links to the full text (or print copy) of the citation. We would like to present to the conference attendees the procedures that we developed for setting up customized targets within the linking software, our categorization of licensing language, procedures for making sure that only the Document Delivery Staff can see these rights, how the system works, and the improvements we made to our Linking Software while setting up the system, for example, a new way to search PubMed ID (PMID) numbers from the Citation Linker.

40|$|It {{has long}} been {{recognised}} that the mechanism for funding irrigation infrastructure in Australia may be incompatible with efficient trade in the rural water market. If the revenue received by an irrigation operator {{is dependent on the}} volume of water entitlements held in the operator's region, out-of-region permanent water sales threaten the operator's revenue stream, potentially leading to higher charges on remaining irrigators, encouraging an inefficient 'rush for the exit'. In response, irrigation operators have imposed restrictions on permanent water trade, such as exit fees and termination fees, to protect their revenue stream. Previous economic analysis has suggested that exit fees, in particular, are a barrier to efficient trade in the water market and should be abolished. In contrast, this paper argues that allowing irrigators to cancel their water <b>delivery</b> <b>rights</b> without fees or charges leads to inefficient trade in the water market, hinders efficient on-farm investment in sunk complementary assets and leads to inefficient network rationalisation decisions. Instead, the revenue stream of irrigation operators should be insulated from water trade decisions, through high termination fees, tying irrigation charges to the land, or tagging the obligation to pay delivery charges to the new owner of the traded water.
