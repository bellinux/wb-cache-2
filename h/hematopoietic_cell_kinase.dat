SH 3 domains have a conserved surface that recognises proline-rich peptides in ligand proteins, but additional contacts also contribute to binding. Using the SH 3 domain of <b>hematopoietic</b> <b>cell</b> <b>kinase</b> as a test case, we show that SH 3 binding properties can be profoundly altered by modifications within a hexapeptide sequence in the RT-loop region that {{is not involved in}} recognition of currently known consensus SH 3 target peptides.

PD 1 was obtained from a phage display screen and exhibits exceptional affinity for the Hck SH 3 domain (K(d) = 0. 23 microM). Competition experiments using NMR spectroscopy demonstrate that the peptide even displaces Nef from Hck SH 3 and allow for estimation of the Nef-Hck SH 3 dissociation constant (K(d) = 0. 44 microM), the strongest SH 3 ligand interaction known so far.

40|$|Purpose {{of review}} Allogeneic <b>hematopoietic</b> <b>cell</b> {{transplantation}} with myeloablative conditioning {{is a well}} established therapy for patients with acute myeloid leukemia. Its efficacy depends, in part, on the destruction of recipient acute myeloid leukemia cells by the conditioning regimen and, in part on their removal by donor immune cells contained in the graft (graft-versus-tumor effect). Due to regiment related toxicities, the use of myeloablative allogeneic <b>hematopoietic</b> <b>cell</b> transplantation has been restricted to younger patients in good condition. More recently, the introduction of allogeneic <b>hematopoietic</b> <b>cell</b> transplantation following reduced-intensity or nonmyeloablative conditioning regimens, which rely mainly on graft-versus-tumor effects for tumor cell eradication, has permitted extending <b>hematopoietic</b> <b>cell</b> transplantation to include older patients and those with medical comorbidities. Recent findings Early results with allogeneic <b>hematopoietic</b> <b>cell</b> transplantation after nonmyeloablative and reduced-intensity conditioning for patients with acute myeloid leukemia in first complete remission are encouraging, with 2 -year survivals after <b>hematopoietic</b> <b>cell</b> transplantation ranging from 48 to 79 % among studies.

40|$|The {{trichothecene}} mycotoxin deoxynivalenol (DON), a known translational inhibitor, induces ribosomal RNA (rRNA) cleavage. Here we characterized {{this process}} relative to 1) specific 18 s and 28 s RNA cleavage sites and 2) identity of specific upstream signaling elements in this pathway. Capillary electrophoresis indicated that DON at concentrations {{as low as}} 200 ng/ml evoked selective rRNA cleavage after 6 h and that 1000 ng/ml caused cleavage within 2 h. Northern blot analysis revealed that DON exposure induced six rRNA cleavage fragments from 28 s rRNA and five fragments from 18 s rRNA. When selective kinase inhibitors were used to identify potential upstream signals, RNA activated protein kinase (PKR), <b>hematopoietic</b> <b>cell</b> <b>kinase</b> (Hck) and p 38 {{were found to be}} required for rRNA cleavage, whereas JNK and ERK were not. Furthermore, rRNA fragmentation was suppressed by the p 53 inhibitors pifithrin-α and pifithrin-µ as well as the pan caspase inhibitor Z-VAD-FMK.

40|$|Interleukin- 6 (LI- 6) is a known {{growth and}} {{survival}} factor in multiple myeloma via activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase and phosphatidylinositol 3 -kinase signaling cascade. In this report we show that Grb 2 -associated binder (Gab) family adapter proteins Gab 1 and Gab 2 are expressed by multiple myeloma cells; and that interleukin- 6 induces their tyrosine phosphorylation and association with downstream signaling molecules. We further demonstrate that these events are Src family tyrosine kinase-dependent and specifically identify the role of <b>hematopoietic</b> <b>cell</b> <b>kinase</b> (Hck) as a new Gab family adapter protein kinase. Conversely, inhibition of Src family tyrosine kinases by the pyrazolopyrimidine PP 2, as in kinase-inactive Hck mutants, significantly reduces IL- 6 -triggered activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase and AKT- 1, leading to significant reduction of multiple myeloma cell proliferation and survival. Taken together, these results delineate a key role for Hck-mediated phosphorylation of Gab 1 and Gab 2 docking proteins in IL- 6 -induced proliferation and survival of multiple myeloma cells and identify tyrosine kinases and downstream adapter proteins as potential new therapeutic targets in multiple myeloma...|$|E

However, the exact compositions and functions of the tumor stroma are still largely unknown. Here, using a Lewis lung carcinoma implantation mouse model, we examined the hematopoietic compartments in tumor stroma and tumor-bearing mice. Different lineages of differentiated <b>hematopoietic</b> <b>cells</b> existed in tumor stroma with the percentage of myeloid cells increasing and the percentage of lymphoid and erythroid cells decreasing over time. Using bone marrow reconstitution analysis, we showed that the tumor stroma also contained functional <b>hematopoietic</b> stem <b>cells.</b> All <b>hematopoietic</b> <b>cells</b> in the tumor stroma originated from bone marrow.

40|$|<b>Hematopoietic</b> <b>cell</b> <b>kinase</b> (Hck) is {{a member}} of the Src-family of non-receptor {{tyrosine}} kinases, which plays many roles in signalling pathways involved in the regulation of cell processes. Hck is expressed in cells of hematopoietic origin, specifically myelomonocytic cells and B lymphocytes. It participates in phagocytosis, adhesion, migration, regulation of protrusion formation on cell membrane, lysosome exocytosis, podosome formation and actin polymn. More importantly from a medicinal chem. point of view, high levels of Hck are involved in chronic myeloid leukemia and other hematol. tumors. Furthermore, Hck activity has been assocd. with virus infections including HIV- 1. In particular, Hck is activated by the HIV- 1 accessory protein Nef, a multifunctional HIV- 1 protein that accelerates progression to AIDS and enhances the infectivity of progeny viruses. Nef binding to Hck leads to kinase activation which is important in AIDS pathogenesis. For these reasons, Hck represents a potentially good therapeutic target for the treatment of both specific cancers and HIV infection.

40|$|The {{ability of}} {{proteins}} to regulate their own enzymatic activity can be facilitated {{by changes in}} structure or protein dynamics in response to external regulators. Because many proteins contain SH 2 and SH 3 domains, transmission of information between the domains is a potential method of allosteric regulation. To determine if ligand binding to one modular domain may alter structural dynamics in an adjacent domain, allowing potential transmission of information through the protein, we used hydrogen exchange and mass spectrometry to measure changes in protein dynamics in the SH 3 and SH 2 domains of <b>hematopoietic</b> <b>cell</b> <b>kinase</b> (Hck). Ligand binding to either domain {{had little or no}} effect on hydrogen exchange in the adjacent domain, suggesting that changes in protein structure or dynamics are not a means of SH 2 /SH 3 crosstalk. Furthermore, ligands of varying affinity covalently attached to SH 3 /SH 2 altered dynamics only in the domain to which they bind. Such results demonstrate that ligand binding may not structurally alter adjacent SH 3 /SH 2 domains and implies that other aspects of protein architecture contribute to the multiple levels of regulation in proteins containing SH 3 and SH 2 domains...|$|E
40|$|The <b>hematopoietic</b> <b>cell</b> <b>kinase</b> (hck) is {{a member}} of the src family of {{tyrosine}} kinases, and is primarily expressed in myeloid cells. Hck expression increases with terminal differentiation in both monocyte/macrophages and granulocytes and is further augmented during macrophage activation. Recent evidence has implicated src-related tyrosine kinases in critical signaling pathways in other hematopoietic lineages. Herein we demonstrate that manipulation of the level of hck expression in the murine macrophage cell line BAC 1. 2 F 5 alters the responsiveness of these cells to activation by bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) but does not affect survival or proliferation. Overexpression of an activated mutant of hck in BAC 1. 2 F 5 cells augments tumor necrosis factor (TNF) production in response to LPS, whereas inhibition of endogenous hck expression, by antisense oligonucleotides, interferes with LPS-mediated TNF synthesis. Together, these observations suggest that hck is an important component of the signal transduction pathways in activated macrophages. xposure of monocytes and macrophages to bacterial LPS E triggers a series of biochemical and functional changes including the activation of protein kinase C (1), tyrosine phosphorylation of several proteins (2), production of reactive oxyge...|$|E

Among its putative upward modulators, the <b>Hematopoietic</b> <b>cell</b> <b>kinase</b> (Hck), a member of the Src kinase superfamily, has been identified as a binding partner and a specific tyrosine kinase for ELMO 1.

Regulation of <b>hematopoietic</b> <b>cell</b> <b>kinase</b> (Hck) activity and selective expression of CCAAT enhancer binding protein β (C/EBPβ) isoforms greatly contribute to determine distinct susceptibility of MΦs to HIV- 1. Resistance is attributable to reduced expression of Hck and augmented expression of an inhibitory small isoform of C/EBPβ. Derivatives of erythromycin A (EMA) EM 201 and EM 703 inhibit the replication of HIV- 1 in tissue MΦs, at posttranscriptional and translational levels. We demonstrate that EM 201 and EM 703 convert tissue MΦs from HIV- 1 susceptible to HIV- 1 resistant through down-regulation of Hck and induction of small isoforms of C/EBPβ. These drugs inhibit p 38 MAPK activation which is expressed only in susceptible tissue MΦs. Activated CD 4 +T cells stimulate the viral replication in HIV- 1 resistant MΦs through down-regulation of small isoforms of C/EBPβ via activation of ERK 1 / 2. EM 201 and EM 703 can inhibit the MAPK activation and inhibit the burst of viral replication produced when CD 4 +T cells and MΦs interact.

Here, we report that of the five human CD 45 isoforms, microglia express CD 45 RB and CD 45 RO (RB > RO) and treatment of microglia with a CD 45 agonist antibody αCD 45 RO (UCHL- 1) inhibits HIV- 1 replication. αCD 45 RO prevented HIV- 1 negative factor (Nef) -induced autophosphorylation of <b>hematopoietic</b> <b>cell</b> <b>kinase</b> (Hck), a myeloid lineage-specific Src kinase. Recombinant CD 45 protein also inhibited HIV- 1 -induced Hck phosphorylation in microglia. Antennapedia-mediated delivery of Hck Src homology domain 3 (SH 3), a domain that binds to the Nef PxxP motif with high affinity, reduced HIV- 1 -induced Hck phosphorylation and HIV- 1 production in microglia. HIV- 1 -induced LTR transactivation was observed in U 38 cells stably overexpressing wild-type Hck but not kinase-inactive Hck. In microglia, αCD 45 RO reduced activation of transcription factors (NF-κB and CCAAT enhancer binding protein) necessary for LTR transactivation in macrophages.

PD 1 shows an unusual ligand sequence for SH 3 binding in type I orientation because it lacks the typical basic anchor residue at position P(- 3), but instead has a tyrosine residue at this position. A basic lysine residue, however, is present at position P(- 4). The solution structure of the HckSH 3 :PD 1 complex, {{which is the first}} HckSH 3 complex structure available, clearly reveals that the P(- 3) tyrosine residue of PD 1 does not take the position of the typical anchor residue but rather forms additional van der Waals interactions with the HckSH 3 RT loop. Instead, lysine at position P(- 4) of PD 1 substitutes the function of the P(- 3) anchor residue. This finding expands the well known ligand consensus sequence +xxPpxP by +xxxPpxP.

Western analysis of sucrose density gradient fractions revealed that PKR and Hck interacted with the 40 S ribosomal subunit in U 9 K-C 2 but not U 9 K-A 1 cells.

Compared to FcRL 4 neg B cells from healthy controls, TLR 9 -stimulated FcRL 4 pos B cells express {{significantly higher levels of}} lL- 6 (p[*]=[*] 0. 0179). Further, TLR 9 -stimulated B cells also upregulate the expression of FcRL 4 (p[*]=[*] 0. 0415) and HcK (p[*]=[*] 0. 0386). In B-cell lines, siRNA-mediated HcK knockdown downmodulates TLR 9 -induced FcRL 4 -mediated activation quantified by CD 23 upregulation (p[*]=[*] 0. 0553). We present data suggesting that, in viremic HIV-infected individuals, FcRL 4 expression identifies unique IL- 6 producing pro-inflammatory B-cell subsets. Further, TLR stimulation likely modulates FcRL 4 expression and FcRL 4 expression is associated with Hck, potentially enhancing the activation of TLR-signaling associated transcription factors. Pathogenic B-cells have been identified in other disease settings, and this study represents a novel report describing a pro-inflammatory B cell subset in HIV-infected patients...|$|E
40|$|The role {{of protein}} {{unfolding}} and protein dynamics in the conformation and activity of <b>hematopoietic</b> <b>cell</b> <b>kinase</b> (Hck), a signal transduction protein and oncogene, was investigated. The regulatory SH 3 and SH 2 domains were probed with hydrogen exchange (HX) and mass spectrometry (MS) {{to determine if}} changes in protein conformation and/or dynamics could {{play a role in}} enzymatic regulation. ^ Hck was analyzed in a stepwise fashion. This approach allowed comparison of how the domains related and how they influenced the conformation and dynamics of one another. Hydrogen exchange results for SH 3 revealed that SH 3 unfolded at pH 7, 25 °C every 20 minutes. Unfolding was slowed by ligand binding. MS/MS techniques narrowed the region of unfolding. Slow unfolding in SH 3 may be critical for Hck activation because the region of SH 3 involved in unfolding is part of a potential conserved “north face” binding site for Hck regulators. ^ Binding SH 2 to a high affinity ligand influenced HX into the folded form of SH 2 and stiffened the structural dynamics throughout the domain. The later result may indicate that SH 2 binding could be relayed {{to other parts of the}} protein by means of changes in protein flexibility. To test this hypothesis, the combination SH 32 domain was incubated with either an SH 3 or SH 2 ligand and HX was monitored. The results indicated that communication between SH 3 and SH 2 was not facilitated by changes in SH 3 /SH 2 motions. Interaction(s) of SH 3 /SH 2 with the kinase domain may be more important as a regulatory mechanism rather than communication between SH 3 and SH 2 via dynamics changes. ^ The dynamics of the joint SH 32 construct were compared to HX into the SH 3 and SH 2 domains when expressed alone. There proved to be significant changes in the dynamics of the domains when they are located next to each other. These results indicate that previous biophysical studies of isolated SH 3 and SH 2 domains may be misleading. The SH 3 domain still unfolded in SH 32 and at the same rate, further evidence that SH 3 unfolding is a part of the dynamics of the whole protein and that may be critical for proper protein regulation. ...|$|E
40|$|Fabry {{disease is}} a rare {{lysosomal}} storage disorder (LSD). We designed multiple recombinant lentivirus vectors (LVs) and tested their ability to engineer expression of human α-galactosidase A (α-gal A) in transduced Fabry patient CD 34 + <b>hematopoietic</b> <b>cells.</b> We further investigated the safety and efficacy of a clinically directed vector, LV/AGA, in both ex vivo cell culture studies and animal models. Fabry mice transplanted with LV/AGA-transduced <b>hematopoietic</b> <b>cells</b> demonstrated α-gal A activity increases and lipid reductions in multiple tissues at 6  months after transplantation. Next we found that LV/AGA-transduced Fabry patient CD 34 + <b>hematopoietic</b> <b>cells</b> produced even higher levels of α-gal A activity than normal CD 34 + <b>hematopoietic</b> <b>cells.</b> We successfully transduced Fabry patient CD 34 + <b>hematopoietic</b> <b>cells</b> with “near-clinical grade” LV/AGA in small-scale cultures and then validated a clinically directed scale-up transduction process in a GMP-compliant cell processing facility. LV-transduced Fabry patient CD 34 + <b>hematopoietic</b> <b>cells</b> were subsequently infused into NOD/SCID/Fabry (NSF) mice; α-gal A activity corrections and lipid reductions were observed in several tissues 12  weeks after the xenotransplantation. Additional toxicology studies employing NSF mice xenotransplanted with the therapeutic cell product demonstrated minimal untoward effects. These data supported our successful clinical trial application (CTA) to Health Canada and opening of a “first-in-the-world” gene therapy trial for Fabry disease...|$|R
40|$|<b>Hematopoietic</b> <b>cell</b> {{phosphatase}} is a nonreceptor protein tyrosine phosphatase that is preferentially {{expressed in}} <b>hematopoietic</b> <b>cell</b> lineages. Motheaten mice, which are devoid of (functional) <b>hematopoietic</b> <b>cell</b> phosphatase, have severe disturbances {{in the regulation}} of B cell activation and differentiation. Because signals transduced via the B cell antigen receptor are known to guide these processes, we decided to analyze molecular interactions between the <b>hematopoietic</b> <b>cell</b> phosphatase and the B cell antigen receptor. Ligation of the B cell antigen receptor induces moderate tyrosine phosphorylation of <b>hematopoietic</b> <b>cell</b> phosphatase {{and the formation of}} a multi-molecular complex containing additional 68 - 70 - and 135 -kDa phosphoproteins. In resting B cells most of the <b>hematopoietic</b> <b>cell</b> phosphatase proteins reside in the cytosolic compartment, whereas after B cell antigen receptor cross-linking, a small fraction translocates toward the membrane where it specifically binds to the 135 -kDa phosphoprotein. This 135 -kDa glycoprotein was identified as CD 22, a transmembrane associate of the B cell antigen receptor complex. Together these findings provide the first direct evidence that this cytoplasmic tyrosine phosphatase is involved in antigen receptor-mediated B cell activation, suggesting that in vivo B cell antigen receptor constituents or associated molecules may serve as substrate for its catalytic activit...|$|R
40|$|Background Hematopoietic {{progenitors}} {{are generated}} in the yolk sac and aorta-gonad-mesonephros region during early mouse development. At embryonic day 10. 5 the first <b>hematopoietic</b> stem <b>cells</b> emerge in the aorta-gonad-mesonephros. Subsequently, <b>hematopoietic</b> stem <b>cells</b> and progenitors {{are found in the}} fetal liver. The fetal liver is a potent hematopoietic site, playing {{an important role in the}} expansion and differentiation of hematopoietic progenitors and <b>hematopoietic</b> stem <b>cells.</b> However, little is known concerning the regulation of fetal liver <b>hematopoietic</b> stem <b>cells.</b> In particular, the role of cytokines such as interleukin- 1 in the regulation of <b>hematopoietic</b> stem <b>cells</b> in the embryo has been largely unexplored. Recently, we observed that the adult pro-inflammatory cytokine interleukin- 1 is involved in regulating aorta-gonad-mesonephros hematopoietic progenitor and <b>hematopoietic</b> stem <b>cell</b> activity. Therefore, we set out to investigate whether interleukin- 1 also plays a role in regulating fetal liver progenitor <b>cells</b> and <b>hematopoietic</b> stem <b>cells.</b> Design and Methods We examined the interleukin- 1 ligand and receptor expression pattern in the fetal liver. The effects of interleukin- 1 on <b>hematopoietic</b> progenitor <b>cells</b> and <b>hematopoietic</b> stem <b>cells</b> were studied by FACS and transplantation analyses of fetal liver explants, and in vivo effects on <b>hematopoietic</b> stem <b>cell</b> and progenitors were studied in Il 1 r 1 -/-embryos. Results We show that fetal liver <b>hematopoietic</b> progenitor <b>cells</b> express the IL- 1 RI and that interleukin- 1 increases fetal liver hematopoiesis, progenitor cell activity and promotes <b>hematopoietic</b> <b>cell</b> survival. Moreover, we show that in Il 1 r 1 -/-embryos, <b>hematopoietic</b> stem <b>cell</b> activity is impaired and myeloid progenitor activity is increased. Conclusions The IL- 1 ligand and receptor are expressed in the midgestation liver and act in the physiological regulation of fetal liver <b>hematopoietic</b> progenitor <b>cells</b> and <b>hematopoietic</b> stem <b>cells...</b>|$|R
40|$|Background: Fibrodysplasia {{ossificans}} progressiva {{is a rare}} {{genetic disorder}} of ectopic skeletogenesis associated with dysregulation of bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signaling. <b>Hematopoietic</b> <b>cells</b> have been implicated in the ectopic skeletogenesis of fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva, and their replacement has been postulated as a pos-sible cure. However, the definitive contribution of <b>hematopoietic</b> <b>cells</b> to the pathogenesis of ectopic skeletogenesis remains obscure. Methods: We employed both careful clinical observation and in vivo murine transplantation studies to more precisely determine the contribution of <b>hematopoietic</b> <b>cells</b> to ectopic skeletogenesis. We identified a patient with fibrodyspla-sia ossificans progressiva who had undergone bone marrow transplantation {{for the treatment of}} intercurrent aplastic anemia twenty-five years earlier and investigated whether the clinical course of the fibrodysplasia ossificans progres-siva had been influenced by bone marrow replacement or immunosuppression, or both. In complementary studies, we transplanted <b>hematopoietic</b> stem <b>cells</b> from constitutively expressing LacZ transgenic mice to identify the contri-bution of <b>hematopoietic</b> <b>cells</b> to BMP 4 -induced heterotopic ossification, a histopathologic model of fibrodysplasia os-sificans progressiva.
