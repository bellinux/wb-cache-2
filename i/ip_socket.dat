40|$|Abstract: Traditional but {{proprietary}} infrastructure {{networks for}} building control and facility automation, such as LON, EIB, etc., {{can lead to}} difficulties and costly gateway structures in approaches of integrating them into wider intranets and the internet. “SmartIP devices”, i. e. small sub-computer nodes with fully integrated IP stack, have been developed and deployed. They provide not only a replacement, but additionally open a large range of new application areas. Small devices with actuators and sensors, for in/output, and local positioning systems, providing an <b>IP</b> <b>socket</b> connection and an optional HTTP server, are programmed in Java as “internet appliances”. Self-configuration and ad hoc networking mechanisms allow user-friendly plug-and-play operation. Cabling cost is reduced by supplying electricity via “Power over Ethernet” (no power cable); or by connecting them wirelessly (no network cable). With the aim of Seamless Networking, “Gateway-less ” or “Zero-gateway ” structures become possible. The user benefits from ubiquitous networking support in daily routines, e. g. the transition between home- car- office. 1...|$|E
40|$|The Neutron Residual Stress Facility (NRSF) at ORNL's High Flux Isotope Reactor (HFIR) {{is being}} {{significantly}} upgraded {{in conjunction with}} the upgrade of the HFIR and associated neutron scattering facilities. We have rewritten the LabVIEW-based data acquisition and control software for the NRSF to provide much greater flexibility in operation of the new equipment and to allow remote control over the Internet. The user interface is dynamically adapted to the specifics of each instrument based on instrument configuration information contained in external configuration files. Internet-based remote control is available via three methods. First, a server at the instrument provides local control and accepts connections via an <b>IP</b> <b>socket.</b> Second, instrument status is available on the Web using LabVIEW's built-in web server that will transmit JPEG images of instrument front panels. Third, complete remote control of the data acquisition system is also available to the instrument scientist via Timbuktu Pro, a commercial remote control program. We also support remote scientific collaboration, not just remote instrument control. We have participated in the development of multiple Electronic Notebooks, implemented as a collection of web pages that are created and viewed through a web browser. Access to the notebooks is controlled via X. 509 certificates. We operate a Certificate Authority and issue our own certificates. All access control and session management is performed on the server via Java servlets. Comment: NOBUGS 2002 Conference, Abstract 2002 / 002, Session PB- 2, 13 pages, 6 figure...|$|E
40|$|Semiconductor {{fabrication}} {{requires an}} increasingly expensive and integrated set of tightly controlled processes, driving {{the need for}} a fabrication facility with fully computerized, networked processing equipment. We describe an integrated, open system architecture enabling distributed experimentation and process control for plasma etching. The system was developed at MIT’s Microsystems Technology Laboratories and employs in-situ CCD interferometry based analysis in the sensor-feedback control of an Applied Materials Precision 5000 Plasma Etcher (AME 5000). Our system supports accelerated, advanced research involving feedback control algorithms, and includes a distributed interface that utilizes the internet to make these fabrication capabilities available to remote users. The system architecture is both distributed and modular: specific implementation of any one task does not restrict the implementation of another. The low level architectural components include a host controller that communicates with the AME 5000 equipment via SECS-II, and a host controller for the acquisition and analysis of the CCD sensor images. A Cell Controller (CC) manages communications between these equipment and sensor controllers. The CC is also responsible for process control decisions; algorithmic controllers may be integrated locally or via remote communications. Finally, a System Server manages connections from internet/intranet (web) based clients and uses a direct link with the CC to access the system. Each component communicates via a predefined set of TCP/ <b>IP</b> <b>socket</b> based messages. This flexible architecture makes integration easier and more robust, and enables separate software components to run on the same or different computers independent of hardware or software platform...|$|E

Barnacle Wifi Tether is an app that creates an ad-hoc wireless hotspot on Android devices with root access. For this purpose, Barnacle provides network address translation, but unlike other solutions, does not rely on support in the Linux kernel (NETFILTER). Instead, Barnacle implements a NAT completely in user-space using BPF (packet <b>sockets)</b> and raw <b>IP</b> <b>sockets.</b> To date, Barnacle has been downloaded 600 k times and is actively used on over 200 k Android devices of at least 20 different makes, despite the technical challenges of obtaining root access...|$|R

40|$|We {{describe}} {{the design and}} implementation of a fault tolerant GridRPC system, Ninf-C, designed for easy programming of large-scale master-worker programs that take from few days to few months for its execution in a Grid environment. Ninf-C employs Condor, developed at University of Wisconsin, as the underlying middleware supporting remote file transmission and checkpointing for system-wide robustness for application users on the Grid. Ninf-C layers all the GridRPC communication and task parallel programming features on top of Condor in a non-trivial fashion, assuming that the entire program is structured in a masterworker style—in fact, older Ninf master-worker programs can be run directly or trivially ported to Ninf-C. In contrast to the original Ninf, Ninf-C exploits and extends Condor features extensively for robustness and transparency, such as 1) checkpointing and stateful recovery of the master process, 2) the master and workers mutually communicating using (remote) files, not <b>IP</b> <b>sockets,</b> and 3) automated throttling of parallel GridRPC calls; and in contrast to using Condor directly, programmers can set up complex dynamic workflow as well as master-worker parallel structure with almost no learning curve involved. To prove the robustness of the system, we performed an experiment on a heterogeneous cluster that consists of x 86 and SPARC CPUs, and ran a simple but long-running master-worker program with staged rebooting of multiple nodes to simulate some serious fault situations. The program execution finished normally avoiding all the fault scenarios, demonstrating the robustness of Ninf-C. 1...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{addresses}} {{the problem of}} CPU resource contention between a Web proxy cache and the TCP Splice kernel service, which this application employs for serving cache misses. TCP Splice improves {{the performance of a}} proxy cache by reducing the CPU utilization and latency for cache misses. However, TCP Splice implementations based on packet forwarding in the <b>IP</b> or <b>socket</b> levels can delay the serving of cache hits when high bursts of packets move through the in-kernel infrastructure. In these implementations, the TCP Splice activity has higher priority than the application, and the application has no means of controlling the pace of spliced transfers. In this paper, we propose an alternative paradigm for TCP Splice implementation that enables application control, while providing reasonably large reductions in CPU overheads. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Advances in deep {{sub-micron}} semiconductor process technologies {{offer the}} SoC designer {{the promise of}} more functionality than can be realized using existing tightly coupled architectures and EDA tools. As the ability to integrate IP cores increases linearly, the complexity of interconnecting these cores also increases, often geometrically. The overhead in design, integration, and verification of inter-core communications quickly becomes greater than the design savings in using pre-verified functional cores. The solution requires a matching of interconnect implementations to computational blocks. Socket-based design is a design methodology that can greatly reduce {{the time and effort}} expended on design and verification of complex SoCs. We will discuss the challenges of tightly coupled design, explain why decoupled interconnect design is essential, define socket-based design; explore the OCP socket specification and give examples of both processor-centric and I/O-centric SoC design using OCP-based sockets and decoupled interconnect cores. Key words: socket-based design, IP reuse, smart interconnect <b>IP,</b> OCP <b>socket</b> standards, SoC design methodology, interconnect cores 1...|$|R

The algorithm is easy to implement and compatible with popular routing protocols, such as the Routing Information Protocol(RIP) in wired networks and Destination-Sequenced Distance Vector(DSDV) protocol in wireless networks, without introducing extra control messages. A clear study on the proposed algorithm is presented, and a series of simulation experiments are conducted to verify the results and to show the capability of the proposed algorithm.

Although some designs like <b>IP</b> security, Secure <b>Socket</b> Layer provide essential security, they unavoidably introduce substantial overheads in the Gateway/Host performance and effective network bandwidths. This routing protocol is compatible with the Routing Information Protocol which uses hop-count as its Routing metric. So there will be a limited number of hops and data transmissions are done by selecting hops randomly in a network. This improves security as well as controls traffic in the network. So, the procedure also includes using the multipath routing to select the paths to be followed. It uses the randomization process for selecting the number of hops to be selected for transforming the data. The routing table in this algorithm is based on the well-known Bellman-Ford algorithm.

40|$|Statement of problem: In modern dentistry, {{the concept}} of {{immediately}} loaded implants placed in fresh extraction <b>sockets</b> (<b>IP)</b> gains significance due to patients being affected aesthetically and functionally during the period between extraction and implantation. Objectives: The aim of this RCT was to compare the stability of immediately placed and loaded implants (IP) (for replacing teeth with non-treatable endodontic complications) to the implant stability of immediately loaded delayed placed implants (DP). Materials and methods: 33 implants (NobelReplace Tapered Groovy; Nobel Biocare) {{were placed in the}} IP-group and 33 into bone-graft (Bio-Oss; Geistlich) regenerated extraction sockets after a 6 -months healing period. Implants were placed in regions of single rooted teeth exclusively, followed by immediate functional loading. Implant Stability Quotient (ISQ) was analysed on the day of implant insertion, and 1, 3, and 6 months after implant insertion. Results: The ISQ-values of 28 patients per group were statistically examined. Mean ISQ values did not differ significantly comparing IP and DP groups, neither at the time of surgery (p = 0. 051; unpaired t-test) nor at the time of final evaluation after 6 months (p = 0. 389; unpaired t-test). Compared to baseline readings, the lowest mean stability was measured 1 month post-surgery (IP p = 0. 114; DP p = 0. 492). However, at the 1 - to 3 -months intervals, implant stability of the IP group was significantly lower (p = 0. 011; unpaired t-test), compared to the DP group. Conclusions: Both groups’ implants resulted in successful osseointegration and stable initial (during a 6 months period) peri-implant conditions. The ISQ-measurement is suitable for the presented implantation methods for evaluating the healing in the bone...|$|R
