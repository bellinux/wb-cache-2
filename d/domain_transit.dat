However, the current interdomain routing protocol (BGP) limits each router to using a single route for each destination prefix, which may not satisfy the diverse requirements of end users. Recent proposals for source routing offer an alternative where end hosts or edge routers select the end-to-end paths.

40|$|Abstract This paper proposes {{efficient}} resource alloca-tion {{techniques for}} a policy-based wireless/wireline interworking architecture, where {{quality of service}} (QoS) provisioning and resource allocation {{is driven by the}} service level agreement (SLA). For end-to-end IP QoS delivery, each wireless access domain can independently choose its internal resource management policies to guarantee the customer access SLA (CASLA), while the border-crossing traffic is served by a core network following policy rules to meet the <b>transit</b> <b>domain</b> SLA (TRSLA). Particularly, we propose an engineered priority resource sharing scheme for a voice/data integrated wireless domain, where the policy rules allow cellular-only access or cellular/WLAN interworked access. By such a resource sharing scheme, the CASLA for each service class is met with efficient resource utilization, and the interdomain TRSLA bandwidth requirement can be easily determined. In the <b>transit</b> <b>domain,</b> the traffic load fluctuation from upstream access domains is tackled by an inter-TRSLA resource sharing technique, where the spare capacity from underloaded TRSLAs can be exploited by the overloaded TRSLAs to improve resource utilization. Advantages of the inter-SLA resource sharing tech-nique are that the core network service provider can freely design the policy rules that define underload and overload status, determine the bandwidth reservation, and distribute the spare resources among bandwidth borrowers, while all the policies are supported by a common set of resource allocation techniques...|$|R

In this paper, we introduce novel dual- level framework that consist of attack detection (D-LAD) and characterization scheme for defending against the DDoS attacks. The macroscopic level detectors (MaLAD) attempt to detect voluminous congestion inducing attacks which cause apparent slowdown in network functionality. The macroscopic level characterization process identifies these large volumes attacks that have been detected early in <b>transit</b> <b>domain</b> by MaLAD. The microscopic level detectors (MiLAD) detect sophisticated attacks that cause network performance to degrade gracefully and remain undetected in <b>transit</b> <b>domain.</b> Microscopic level characterization process identifies such attacks that have been detected at border routers in stub domain near the victim by Mi-LAD.

40|$|A general {{model has}} been {{proposed}} for the fusion mechanisms of class I viral fusion proteins. According to this model a metastable trimer, anchored in the viral membrane through its transmembrane <b>domain,</b> <b>transits</b> to a trimeric prehairpin intermediate, anchored at its opposite end in the target membrane through its fusion peptide. A subsequent refolding event creates a trimer of hairpins (often termed a six-helix bundle) in which the previously well-separated transmembrane domain and fusion peptide (and their attached membranes) are brought together, thereby driving membrane fusion. While there is ample biochemical and structural information on the trimer-of-hairpins conformation of class I viral fusion proteins, less is known about intermediate states between native metastable trimers and the final trimer of hairpins. In this study we analyzed conformational states of the transmembrane subunit (TM), the fusion subunit, of the Env glycoprotein of the subtype A avian sarcoma and leukosis virus (ASLV-A). By analyzing forms of EnvA TM on mildly denaturing sodium dodecyl sulfate gels we identified five conformational states of EnvA TM. Following interaction of virions with a soluble form of the ASLV-A receptor at 37 °C, the metastable form of EnvA TM (which migrates at 37 kDa) transits to a 70 -kDa {{and then to a}} 150 -kDa species. Following subsequent exposure to a low pH (or an elevated temperature or the fusion promoting agent chlorpromazine), an additional set of bands at > 150 kDa, and then a final band at 100 kDa, forms. Both an EnvA C-helix peptide (which inhibits virus fusion and infectivity) and the fusion-inhibitory agent lysophosphatidylcholine inhibit the formation of the > 150 - and 100 -kDa bands. Our data are consistent with the 70 - and 150 -kDa bands representing precursor and fully formed prehairpin conformations of EnvA TM. Our data are also consistent with the > 150 -kDa bands representing higher-order oligomers of EnvA TM and with the 100 -kDa band representing the fully formed six-helix bundle. In addition to resolving fusion-relevant conformational intermediates of EnvA TM, our data are compatible with a model in which the EnvA protein is activated by its receptor (at neutral pH and a temperature {{greater than or equal to}} room temperature) to form prehairpin conformations of EnvA TM, and in which subsequent exposure to a low pH is required to stabilize the final six-helix bundle, which drives a later stage of fusion...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — This article proposes an {{architecture}} and algorithms to select optimal diverse AS paths for end-to-end LSPs computation. The multi-domain architecture relies upon a service plane {{consisting of a}} service broker and an AS Selection Agent. Through the broker, every <b>domain</b> advertises <b>transit</b> metrics representing its transit policies (cost, routing policies) and potentially some Traffic Engineering (TE) information. The metrics {{are assumed to be}} directional, i. e. depending on the incoming and outgoing ASs. The Agent uses them to compute AS paths based on both costs and TE constraints, considering also, if needed, local policies and statistics on past transactions stored by the broker. A set of diverse AS paths can be computed, in order to proactively increase the success rate of tunnel set-up, in the case of imprecision or absence of advertised TE information (each AS path being subsequently tested), or to meet end-to-end protection requirements. If an AS path can be activated, the source router trigger the router-level inter-AS path computation along the AS path, which is accomplished by the PCE-based architecture. Within this framework, we formalize the inter-AS diverse route selection problem with directional metrics, and compare a breadth-first search heuristic with limited depth to the optimal approach. Simulations on realistic topologies prove that the heuristic scales with the number of diverse routes, and that it has an optimality gap under the 5 % at least once every two times. I...|$|R

CLL cells that express unmutated immunoglobulin variable domains likely underwent final development prior to their entry into the germinal center, whereas those that express mutated variable <b>domains</b> likely <b>transited</b> through the germinal center and then underwent final development. Regardless, the cellular origin of CLL remains unknown. The aim of this review is to summarize immunological aspects involved in this process and to provide insights about the complex biology and pathogenesis of this disease. We propose a mechanistic hypothesis to explain the origin of B-CLL clones into our current picture of normal B cell development. In particular, we suggest that unmutated CLL arises from normal B cells with self-reactivity for apoptotic bodies that have undergone receptor editing, CD 5 expression, and anergic processes in the bone marrow. Similarly, mutated CLL would arise from cells that, while acquiring self-reactivity for autoantigens—including apoptotic bodies—in germinal centers, are also still subject to tolerization mechanisms, including receptor editing and anergy. We believe that CLL is a proliferation of B lymphocytes selected during clonal expansion through multiple encounters with (auto) antigens, {{despite the fact that}} they differ in their state of activation and maturation. Autoantigens and microbial pathogens activate BCR signaling and promote tolerogenic mechanisms such as receptor editing/revision, anergy, CD 5 + expression, and somatic hypermutation in CLL B cells. The result of these tolerogenic mechanisms is the survival of CLL B cell clones with similar surface markers and homogeneous gene expression signatures. We suggest that both immunophenotypic surface markers and homogenous gene expression might represent the evidence of several attempts to re-educate self-reactive B cells...|$|R

Since backbone routers maintain only the sink tree information, the total number of reservations at each router scales linearly with the number of Internet domains N. (Even aggregated versions of the current protocol RSVP have a reservation count that can grow like O(N 2).) BGRP maintains these aggregated reservations using “soft state. ” To further reduce the protocol message traffic, routers may reserve bandwidth beyond the current load, so that some sources can join or leave the tree without sending messages {{all the way to the}} tree root. BGRP relies on Differentiated Services for data forwarding, hence the number of packet classifier entries is extremely small...|$|R
40|$|Though IP {{multicast}} is resource ef£cient {{in delivering}} data {{to a group}} of members simultaneously, it suffers from scalability problem with the number of concurrently active multicast groups because it requires a router to keep forwarding state for every multicast tree passing through it. To solve this state scalability problem, we proposed a scheme, called aggregated multicast. The key idea is that multiple groups are forced to share a single delivery tree. In our earlier work, we introduced the basic concept of aggregated multicast and presented some initial results to show that multicast state can be reduced. In this paper, we develop a more quantitative assessment of the cost/bene£t trade-offs. We propose an algorithm to assign multicast groups to delivery trees with controllable cost and introduce metrics to measure multicast state and tree management overhead for multicast schemes. We then compare aggregated multicast with conventional multicast schemes, such as source speci£c tree scheme and shared tree scheme. Our extensive simulations show that aggregated multicast can achieve signi£cant routing state and tree management overhead reduction while containing the expense of extra resources (bandwidth waste and tunnelling overhead). We conclude that aggregated multicast is a very cost-effective and promising direction for scalable <b>transit</b> <b>domain</b> multicast provisioning...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} of this research project {{is to develop a}} user interface “test bed” to measure the role of touchscreen kiosks with community connectivity. This interface test bed will apply the knowledge of interface design to the <b>domain</b> of public <b>transit</b> kiosks, with a particular focus on bike share stations. The value of this research is the ability to generate user feedback between community members using urban experiences. Safety, effectiveness and community connectivity of public transit is enhanced with this information interface. This report explains the test bed kiosk’s design, physical build, and hardware and software testing. User interaction studies for standards, accessibility and design criteria were done; 2 D and 3 D modeling, material sourcing and mockups were built. Hardware sensors for proximity included passive infrared (PIR), ultrasonic range finding and RGB-D technology using Microsoft Kinect. Tests measured interaction with user movement type, including the differentiation of pedestrians, cyclists and vehicles. Observed interaction tests were performed with human subjects review approval. The interface test bed will allow for future tests using more advanced sensors and include user intercept surveys. The prototype test bed is a tool to test interface design for connecting urban design theory classifying urban experience information to enhance transit, firstly through the specific application of public bike share...|$|R
40|$|Resource {{reservation}} must {{operate in}} an efficient and scalable fashion, {{to accommodate the}} rapid growth of the Internet. In this paper, we describe a distributed architecture for interdomain aggregated resource reservation for unicast traffic. We also present an associated protocol, called the Border Gateway Reservation Protocol (BGRP), that scales well, in terms of message processing load, state storage and bandwidth. Each stub or <b>transit</b> <b>domain</b> may use its own intra-domain resource reservation protocol. BGRP builds a sink tree for each of the stub domains. Each sink tree aggregates bandwidth reservations from all data sources in the network.
