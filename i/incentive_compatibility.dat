40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} {{the consequences of}} multihoming on private and social <b>incentives</b> for <b>compatibility.</b> Multihoming occurs in our model when consumers buy from both of two competing firms so as to capture network benefits.

40|$|Positive network {{externalities}} {{can arise}} when consumers {{benefit from the}} consumption of compatible products by other consumers (user-positive consumption externalities) or, alternatively, when they incur costs from the consumption of incompatible products by other consumers (nonuser-negative consumption externalities). But whereas user-positive externalities are typically mutually imposed and imply mutual benefit because they relate to interoperability, with nonuser-negative externalities the costs of incompatibility may be imposed unilaterally and borne asymmetrically. For example, increased risks of death and injury on the roads due to the co-existence of large and small vehicles are imposed exclusively by {{the owners of the}} large vehicles and borne exclusively by the occupants of the small vehicles. This paper compares the social optimality of <b>incentives</b> for <b>compatibility</b> under regimes involving user-positive and nonuser-negative externalities. Earlier work with respect to user-positive externalities (e. g., Katz and Shapiro, 1985) suggests that firms with relatively small networks or weak reputations tend to be biased in favor of compatibility, while individual firms’ <b>incentives</b> for <b>compatibility</b> are suboptimal when their networks are closely matched in size. Meanwhile, intuition suggests that with nonuser-negative externalities incentives for incompatibility should always be excessive, reflecting the notion that activities involving unilaterally imposed negative externalities will always be overprovided by the market (in the absence of regulation or Coaseian mitigation). Using a "location" model of differentiated products, we find that, under both regimes, <b>incentives</b> for <b>compatibility</b> tend to be suboptimal when firms' networks are close in size, and excessive for the small firm when the networks differ greatly in size. Surprising public policy implications with respect to externalities are discussed. ...|$|R
40|$|The article {{highlights}} {{the role of}} heterogeneity {{in the formation of}} hedonic prices. The article distinguishes between continuous and groupwise heterogeneity. The distinction helps understanding two important points. First, the analysis of market equilibrium with group wise heterogeneity makes explicit the role of participation and <b>incentives</b> <b>compatibility</b> constraints for groups of buyers. The case of continuous heterogeneity may {{be thought of as a}} limit case of groupwise heterogeneity when the number of groups goes to inﬁnity and their masses go to zero. The hedonic price curve is then obtained as the solution of a diﬀerential equation resulting from a market clearing condition. Second, the article outlines that submarkets emerge from market equilibrium only in the case of groupwise heterogeneity. The existence of submarkets means that the hedonic price function is continuous but the implicit price of characteristics is discontinuous at endogenous threshold values separating submarkets. Major implications for the valuation of environmental quality follow on. Based on numerical simulations, the article gives some insights into the way signiﬁcant biases and drawbacks in the estimation of the implicit price of environmental quality can arise if the usual two steps procedure is implemented...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{provides}} {{an analysis of}} compatibility decisions with oligopolistic price setting in a duopoly logit model. We consider a sequential game in which firms first choose whether they supply compatible products and then set the price which is charged. The equilibrium compatibility configuration is {{the outcome of a}} trade-off between consumers valuation of compatibility and the loss of product differentiation which is associated with compatibility. Finally, it is shown that firms <b>incentives</b> towards <b>compatibility</b> tend to be socially insufficient. ...|$|R
30|$|Providing {{the best}} {{experiences}} for users {{is the core}} pursuit of a collaborative innovation between a manufacturing enterprise and its external resources. Consequently, further measures should be developed to stimulate their innovative inputs {{in terms of the}} <b>incentive</b> <b>compatibilities.</b> For example, a manufacturing enterprise drives strategic suppliers to put forward a technical solution based on their product competitiveness, which means that the manufacturing enterprise gives a commitment to the strategic suppliers in terms of its order size. Reversely, the strategic suppliers contribute greatly to technological innovation by relying on the comprehensive innovative capabilities from their R&D, production and quality assurance departments. Obviously, a manufacturing enterprise could get more benefits from this “big-to-big” collaboration, such as short “time-to-market” of a new innovative product, low sourcing prices for the materials/modules needed, etc. Under these circumstances, it is necessary for the manufacturing enterprise to offer incentive measures to inspire the strategic suppliers in the open innovation collaboration. For example, when strategic suppliers achieve or surpass set project KPIs (Key Performance Indices) including cost reductions, yield rate increase etc., they should be given additional allowances or profit sharing by the manufacturing enterprise. Moreover, strategic suppliers of good standing could have access to more innovation projects. Strategic suppliers with outstanding contributions may also enjoy the renewal of cooperation agreements for forthcoming innovation projects, allowing them to bring in more profit during these projects.|$|R

40|$|We {{contribute}} to the literature network effects by allowing entrepreneurs to sell their innovations to incumbents in addition to entering the industry. We identify three new effects. Stronger network effects make selling innovations attractive, as incumbents bid up the sales price in fear of letting a rival obtain the innovation. This improves innovation <b>incentives.</b> Increased <b>compatibility,</b> however, reduces innovation incentives by reducing the relative advantage {{the owner of the}} innovation gets, in turn resulting in a lower sales price. Finally, bidding competition for innovations is crucial. Innovation waves can occur in network industries as bidding competition is fierce in young industries with several players competing for the top spot, but weak in mature industries with a clear leader. ...|$|R
40|$|We study {{incentive}} compatible profit-sharing rules when output (or profit) {{is obtained}} via the joint {{use of a}} technology exhibiting decreasing marginal returns. The <b>incentives</b> <b>compatibility</b> criterion we adopt is that of strategy-proofness (SP), arguably the most robust and the most demanding incentives requirement. We first show that no strategy-proof mechanism is efficient. We then characterize the class of strategy-proof mechanisms in the two-agent case, and show {{that it is the}} union of the serial and reverse serial families of sharing rules. Moreover, SP and the requirement that no individual benefits from the presence of others (the familiar stand-alone test) characterize the class of rules known as fixed path methods (FPMs), which is a subset of the serial family. FPMs share marginal increments of input, and the corresponding increments of output, along a predetermined path. Finally, we consider a situation where a number of individuals form a partnership and contribute capital and labor to the enterprise. We propose a strategy-proof mechanism which improves upon autarky: the inverse marginal product proportions (IMPP) mechanism. At the margin, capital that would be left idle in autarky, but not under the efficient use of the total capital, is assigned to the agents with relatively low disutility of effort in proportion to the relative productivity of their own capital. The IMPP mechanism is effectively an FPM whose path is uniquely determined by the capital contributions of the partners. Thus, we establish a correspondence between the class of FPMs to manage a common property technology and the family of partnership problems. We discuss the appeal of the IMPP mechanism as an alternative to existing profit-sharing schemes in professional partnerships...|$|R

We assume the presence of two systems, each composed of some basic component {{and a set of}} differentiated complementary products. The combination of complementarity between the two components of the system and of fixed costs in the production of the complementary product results in a form of network effect. We focus on the role played {{by the size of the}} fixed costs in the production of the complementary products in determining the size of this system effect and, by this means, the structure and types of equilibria that may be observed: monopolistic or duopolistic, symmetric or asymmetric. We also highlight the consequence of the same fixed costs for the private and social incentives to render the systems compatible. ...|$|R

40|$|We analyze Bertrand duopoly {{competition}} in markets with network effects and consumer switching costs. Depending on {{the ratio of}} switching costs to network effects, our model generates four different market patterns: monopolization and market sharing, which can be either preserved or reversed. A critical mass effect where one firm becomes the monopolist for sure only occurs for intermediate values of the ratio, whereas for large switching costs market sharing is the unique equilibrium. For large network effects, both monopoly and market sharing equilibria exist. Our welfare analysis reveals a conflict between maximization of consumer surplus and social welfare when network effects are large. We also analyze firms’ <b>incentives</b> for <b>compatibility</b> and <b>incentives</b> to increase switching costs and examine how market outcomes are affected by market expansion and cost asymmetries. Finally, in a dynamic extension of our model, we show how competition depends on agents’ discount factors. ...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{develops}} a generalised model of network competition when consumers {{vary in their}} preferences for network size and location, and networks are vertically and horizontally differentiated. The effect of compatibility {{on the degree of}} competition between the networks is analysed. Two effects are identified as central to determining networks' <b>incentives</b> towards <b>compatibility.</b> Compatibility decreases vertical differentiation (and hence increases competition); but it also decreases the importance of market share (and so decreases competition). Which effect dominates depends on the relative importance of horizontal and vertical aspects in consumers' utilities. When network size is a relatively important factor in consumers' utilities, neither the larger nor smaller network in the unique asymmetric equilibrium wishes to be compatible. When horizontal aspects are important, both networks wish to be compatible. For intermediate cases, the larger network does not wish to be compatible, in contrast to the smaller network. The model may explain the dynamics of network industries, particularly interconnection agreements between Internet service providers...|$|R

Finally, compatibility also requires {{a significant number of}} single-homing users. The results are consistent with empirical observations of social networks and suggest that increased adoption of ad-sponsored business models may lead to many de-facto standards in high-technology industries. ...|$|R
