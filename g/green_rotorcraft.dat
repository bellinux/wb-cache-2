40|$|A novel variable-fidelity multi-objective {{optimization}} technique {{is applied to}} the design problem of helicopter rotorblades of the <b>Green</b> <b>RotorCraft</b> research programme of CleanSky. The {{optimization technique}} utilizes information from aerodynamic low-fidelity tools, here a prescribed wake model in forward flight and inviscid CFD simulations in hover, to speed-up the high-fidelity optimization, which is based on RANS simulations including all five-rotor blades. In reference to a state-of-the-art single-fidelity optimization, this approach finds about 325 % more viable data points. A choice of three rotorblades from the final Pareto frontier of the optimization is investigated in detail including the off-design performance as well as acoustic footprint in an overflight condition. The final outcome is that there does not exist one blade that fully satisfies all criteria at once, but feasible trade-offs are found when applying the variable-fidelity multi-optimization technique...|$|E
40|$|The <b>Green</b> <b>Rotorcraft</b> project (part of Clean Sky JTI) is {{studying}} the Gurney flap as a demonstrator of a smart adaptive rotorblade. Deployment systems for the Gurney flap need to sustain large centrifugal loads and vibrations while maintaining precisely the displacement under aerodynamic loading. Designing such a mechanism relies on both the actuation technology and the link which transmits motion to the control surface. Flexible beams and piezoelectric patch actuators have been chosen as components to design this mechanism. Flexible beams are providing an hinge-less robust structure onto which the piezoelectric actuators are bonded. A candidate topology is determined by investigating the compliance of a simple wire structure with beam elements. A parametrized finite element model is then built and optimized for displacement and force through surrogate optimization. The whole process does not requires many finite element analyses and quickly converge to an optimized mechanism...|$|E
40|$|Wind tunnel {{tests were}} {{performed}} on an aerofoil section {{comparable to that of}} a full scale helicopter blade section with an upstream active Gurney flap in the framework of the European project CleanSky ITD <b>Green</b> <b>RotorCraft.</b> A modified NACA 0012 profile was used, with 23 Kulite pressure transducers embedded in the profile’s surface and with an integrated actuator system for the Gurney flap. The Gurney flap, positioned at 95 % of the chord length and with a deployed size of 1. 3 % of the chord length, extended the full span width of the section. The aerofoil was supported by a mounting system with automated control of the angle of attack. The effect of the Gurney flap is assessed for various deployment strategies. The test campaign carried out was successful. The aerodynamic behaviour can be extracted from the data and contains valuable information for validation of 2 D numerical models developed by other partners in the project. The most important improvement of the setup for future use is the stabilisation of the inclinometer readings, which showed a significant amount of noise...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} the comprehensive approach followed to design, implement and test an innovative sensor system {{aimed at the}} in-flight estimation of the helicopter main rotor state. This activity represents a fundamental step of MANOEUVRES, a project carried on {{in the framework of}} Clean Sky <b>Green</b> <b>Rotorcraft</b> 5 research programme, which is aimed at developing an integrated system capable of informing the pilot of the real-time noise generation and of suggesting possible corrective actions for low-noise maneuvering. The main rotor state {{is one of the most}} impacting factors on the helicopter noise generation, and cannot be measured with conventional rotorcraft instrumentation. The stereoscopic vision-based measurement system described in this paper overcomes this limitation, allowing the running estimation of the main rotor blade attitude in terms of lag, flap and pitch angles. Furthermore, such a sensor system could allow the implementation of enhanced attitude control laws based on rotor state feedback. The full development process of the sensor system, mounted on the main rotor head is presented, up to the flight trials on board an AgustaWestland AW 139 prototype helicopter...|$|E
40|$|Following a {{comparative}} study on shape morphing and adaptive systems to improve rotorcraft efficiency, the <b>Green</b> <b>Rotorcraft</b> consortium has selected the Gurney flap technology as demonstrator of a smart adaptive rotorblade within the Clean Sky Joint Technology Initiative [1]. The aim {{of such a}} system is to actively increase helicopter overall performance by improving lift and alleviating static and dynamic stall on the retreating side of the helicopter [2, 3]. The Gurney flap technology will be subjected to various tests, prior to manufacturing a full-scale demonstrator. Along with wind tunnel and whirl tower tests on full blade sections, a reduced-scale blade is required to be tested on a rotary support in a wind tunnel. The aim {{is to have a}} fully operational mechanism in a 1 / 8 th-scale blade. A specific system needs to be designed for this smaller model blade. The specifications for the model blade mechanism are more challenging compared to the full model blade. The blade tip speed must remain the same between the two blades. Therefore, the model blade rotation speed and centrifugal loads greatly increase. Piezoelectric patch actuators combined with flexible beams are chosen to design a fast and robust mechanism, which would fit inside the model blade and support the large centrifugal loads. A mechanism is modeled using Finite Element Analysis tools and its geometry is optimised using a surrogate optimisation to maximise displacement and force. The optimised geometry has a Z-shape profile and maximise displacement and force. The force generated is sufficient to counter directly the force of the airflow on the flap. However, the displacement and the mechanical work are not large enough to deploy directly the Gurney flap as a conventional flap. The deployment time remains insufficient as well. Building on these results, refined geometries are under investigation using the same optimisation process...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the work done}} and strong interaction between Cranfield University as member of the Technology Evaluator (TE) team, <b>Green</b> <b>Rotorcraft</b> (GRC) Integrated Technology Demonstrator (ITD) and Sustainable and Green Engine (SAGE) ITD of the Clean Sky Joint Technology Initiative (JTI). The aim of Clean Sky is to develop and integrate new and innovative technologies that will hel p meeting the emission and noise reduction targets set by the Advisory Council for Aviation Research and Innovation in Europe (ACARE) for aircraft of next generation. The GRC and SAGE ITDs are responsible for developing new helicopter airframe and engine t echnologies respectively, whilst the TE has the distinctive role of assessing {{the environmental impact of}} these technologies at single flight (mission), airport and Air Transport System levels (ATS). Cranfield University {{as a member of the}} TE is responsibl e for the mission trajectory definition and for conducting the environmental performance assessments. The assessments reported herein have been performed by using a GRC - developed multi - disciplinary simulation framework called PhoeniX (Platform Hosting Oper ational and Environmental Investigations for Rotorcraft) that comprises various computational modules. These modules include a rotorcraft performance code (EUROPA), an engine performance and emissions simulation tool (GSP) and a noise prediction code (HELE NA). PhoeniX can predict the performance of a helicopter along a prescribed 4 D trajectory offering a complete helicopter mission analysis. In the context of the TE assessments reported herein, three helicopter classes are examined, namely a Twin Engine Lig ht (TEL) configuration, for Emergency Medical Service (EMS) and Police missions, and a Single Engine Light (SEL) configuration for Passenger/Transport missions, and a Twin Engine Heavy (TEH) configuration for Oil & Gas missions. The different technologies assessed reflect three simulation points which are the ‘Baseline’ Year 2000 technology, ‘Reference’ Y 2020 technology, without Clean Sky benefits, and finally the ‘Conceptual’, reflecting Y 2020 technology with Clean Sky benefits. The results of this study i llustrate the potential that incorporated technologies possess in terms of improving performance and gas emission metrics such as fuel burn, CO 2, NOx as well as the noise footprint on the ground...|$|E
40|$|Cross-positioned {{within the}} Clean Sky Programme, the Technology Evaluator (TE) is a {{dedicated}} evaluation platform. It has the key role of assessing {{the environmental impact}} of the technologies developed in Clean Sky and their level of success towards the ACARE environmental goals. TE assessments consider all promising green technologies selected by Clean Sky´s ITDs (Integrated Technology Demonstrator platforms) in which these technologies are developed and clustered in coherent and mutually compatible solution sets, identifying optimized new future aircraft solutions. The ITDs are: •	Smart Fixed Wing Aircraft (SFWA) addressing large aircraft technologies •	Green Regional Aircraft (GRA) addressing regional aircraft technologies •	<b>Green</b> <b>Rotorcraft</b> (GRC) addressing rotorcraft technologies •	Sustainable And Green Engines (SAGE) addressing engine technologies •	Systems for Green Operations (SGO) addressing aircraft systems The ITD technologies are integrated into simplified conceptual aircraft performance models in order to evaluate the Clean Sky technology solution sets at aircraft level. These aircraft are named Clean Sky concept aircraft. Using these Clean Sky concept aircraft as a basis the TE conducts assessments at three levels: •	Aircraft level At aircraft level the environmental evaluation of a single flight is performed. To this end a Clean Sky concept aircraft and its reference technology aircraft are compared along the same reference trajectory {{in order to determine the}} environmental benefit of the Clean Sky technologies. The main environmental indicators considered are noise on ground, fuel burn and emissions (CO 2 and NOX). •	Airport level At airport level the environmental impact on local communities around an airport is assessed. To this end a year 2020 airport traffic scenario with reference technology aircraft is compared with the same traffic scenario but in which Clean Sky concept aircraft replace their reference technology counterpart. The main metrics at airport level are noise on the ground, population impacted by certain noise levels, and emissions (CO 2 and NOX). •	Air transport system (ATS) level At ATS level {{the environmental impact of}} Clean Sky technologies is quantified at global scale. To this end a year 2020 fleet traffic scenario with reference technology aircraft is compared with the same traffic scenario but in which Clean Sky concept aircraft replace their reference technology counterpart. Fuel burn and emissions (CO 2 and NOX) are the main indicators of interest at ATS level. The present paper will give an overview on the TE methodology and present the latest results at the three assessment levels...|$|E
