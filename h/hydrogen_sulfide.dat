30|$|Carbon fibers {{are mainly}} {{synthesized}} by {{chemical vapor deposition}} method from a carbon source using transition metal as catalyst. The carbon nanofibers seem to form either in the vapor phase [5, 6] or over catalyst deposited on supported material [7, 8]. A sulfur compound (elemental sulfur, <b>hydrogen</b> <b>sulfides,</b> thiophene) is essential with metal catalyst to promote the catalytic growth for CNFs formation [6, 9]. It helps to increase the reaction kinetics which reduces the soot formation and leads to formation of thickened carbon nanofiber [6]. Small amount of such impurity helps to produce fibers of reasonable quality and good yields. In an earlier study {{it was observed that}} without any <b>hydrogen</b> <b>sulfides</b> in the feedstock, a negligible amount of fibers formed and the major products was soot [9]. Sulfur plays an important role for the formation of CNFs as it liquefies iron particle that enhances CNFs formation. This liquefaction considerably increases the formation of CNFs by VLS process, due to formation of eutectic between iron and iron-sulfur compounds at 988 °C [6].|$|R
40|$|Anoxia was {{successfully}} induced in four benthic chambers installed at 24 m depth {{on the northern}} Adriatic seafloor from 9 days to 10 months. To accurately determine whether benthic foraminifera can survive experimentally induced prolonged anoxia, the CellTracker TM Green method was applied and calcareous and agglutinated foraminifera were analyzed. Numerous individuals were found living at all sampling times and at all sampling depths (to 5 cm), supported by a ribosomal RNA analysis that revealed that certain benthic foraminifera were active after 10 months of anoxia. The results show that benthic foraminifera can survive up to 10 months of anoxia with co-occurring <b>hydrogen</b> <b>sulfides.</b> However, foraminiferal standing stocks decrease with sampling time in an irregular manner. A large difference in standing stock between two cores sampled under initial conditions indicates {{the presence of a}} large spatial heterogeneity of the foraminiferal faunas. An unexpected increase in standing stocks after one month is tentatively interpreted as a reaction to increased food availability due to the massive mortality of infaunal macrofaunal organisms. After this, standing stocks decrease again in cores sampled after 2 months of anoxia to then attain a minimum in the cores sampled after 10 months. We speculate that the trend of overall decrease of standing stocks is not due to the adverse effects of anoxia and <b>hydrogen</b> <b>sulfides</b> but rather due to a continuous diminution of labile organic matter...|$|R

40|$|A {{number of}} {{promising}} technologies {{are currently being}} optimized for coal-based power generation, including the Integrated-Gasification Combined Cycle (IGCC) system. If IGCC {{is to be used}} successfully for power generation, an economic and efficient way must be found to remove the contaminants, particularly sulfur species, found in coal gas. Except for the hot gas desulfurization system, all major components of IGCC are commercially available or have been shown to meet system requirements. Over the last two decades, the U. S. Department of Energy/Morgantown Energy Technology Center (DOE/METC) has sponsored development of various configurations of high-temperature desulfurization systems including fixed-bed, moving-bed, transport-bed, and fluidized-bed systems. Because of their mode of operation and requirements for sorbent manufacturing, the fixed-bed systems can generally use the same materials as moving-bed configurations, i. e., pelletized or extruded sorbents, while fluidized-bed (circulating or bubbling configurations) and transport reactor configurations use materials generally described as agglomerated or granulated. The objective of this program is to remove <b>hydrogen</b> <b>sulfides</b> from coal gas using sorbent materials...|$|R

5|$|The {{principal}} gases released during {{volcanic activity}} are water, carbon dioxide, sulfur dioxide, hydrogen, <b>hydrogen</b> <b>sulfide,</b> carbon monoxide and hydrogen chloride.

5000|$|Black Powder {{results from}} both {{chemical}} and bacterial reactions within hydrocarbon systems. Bacterially, sulfate reducing bacteria and acid producing bacteria {{are dependent on}} the reaction of water and iron to form the <b>hydrogen</b> <b>sulfides</b> that cause oxidization and in turn Black Powder. Chemically, the three primary catalysts of Black Powder contamination are moisture, H2S, and temperature or pressure variance. Within pipeline transmission systems, ever present moisture catalyzes bacterial and chemical corrosion of the carbon steel walls within pipelines and storage reservoirs. In refineries, process plants, and storage reservoirs, if H2S is present, it will corrode all carbon steel components creating more Black Powder. Severe temperature and pressure changes occur throughout the pipeline at city gates, processing plants and refineries, precipitating iron oxides, iron sulfides and sulfur from the hydrocarbon gas or liquids. These particles have an affinity for themselves and {{throughout the rest of}} the pipeline process will reach measurable levels instantly causing clouds of Black Powder in the flow.|$|R
40|$|Ammonothermal {{synthesis}} is {{a method}} for synthesis and crystal growth suitable for a large range of chemically different materials, such as nitrides (e. g., GaN, AlN), amides (e. g., LiNH 2, Zn(NH 2) 2), imides (e. g., Th(NH) 2), ammoniates (e. g., Ga(NH 3) 3 F 3, [Al(NH 3) 6]I 3 · NH 3) and non-nitrogen compounds like hydroxides, <b>hydrogen</b> <b>sulfides</b> and polychalcogenides (e. g., NaOH, LiHS, CaS, Cs 2 Te 5). In particular, large scale production of high quality crystals is possible, due to comparatively simple scalability of the experimental set-up. The ammonothermal method is defined as employing a heterogeneous reaction in ammonia as one homogenous fluid close to or in supercritical state. Three types of milieus may be applied during ammonothermal synthesis: ammonobasic, ammononeutral or ammonoacidic, evoked by the used starting materials and mineralizers, strongly influencing the obtained products. There is little known about the dissolution and materials transport processes or the deposition mechanisms during ammonothermal crystal growth. However, the initial results indicate the possible nature of different intermediate species present in the respective milieus...|$|R
40|$|The {{liberation and}} {{accumulation}} of sulfides {{in the mud}} sediment are discussedon the basis of results of observation at Omura Bay in 1966 and 1967. In the bottom sediments, the sulfate-reduclng bacteria increase with the rising ofseawater temperature in summer, and {{play a major role}} in the production of sulfides. In the earlier period, free <b>hydrogen</b> <b>sulfides</b> liberated by bacterial actions are boundmainly with the iron which is present in the mud, and accumulated in bottomsediments but they are sometimes suspended in the bottom water as iron sulfidesdepending on the condition of seawater and bottom. In the latter period, freehydrogen sulfides, due to lack of available iron, either diffuse onto bottom wateror partially stay in the bottom sediments depending on the condition of the mud. These tendencies seem remarkable in pearl farm. Judging from the above facts and the vertical observations, it seems that anoxiclayer formation in the central part of this bay is caused by abiological or biologicaloxidation of sulfldes diffused in the bottom water from mud sediments. 1966 年と 1967 年の観測結果を基に,底質中の硫化物の挙動について,次のような考察を行なった. 大村湾内の底質中においては,夏季水温上昇と共に,硫酸還元細菌数が増加し,硫化物生成の主役を演じ,その結果発生した硫化水素は,前半期では固定・集積されるが,海況・泥質の状態によっては懸濁硫化鉄として浮揚する. また後半期では硫化水素は,易反応性鉄が不足するため,遊離の状態で水層へ拡散するか,あるいは底質の状況によってその中に一部未結合状態で存在する. これらの傾向は,真珠漁場で著しい. また,湾中央部無酸素層の生成は,これらの水層拡散,あるいは浮揚硫化物の酸化のために,溶存酸素が消費されるのが主因である...|$|R

40|$|Planning of coal {{hydrogenation}} processes, such as liquifaction and gasification, requires {{consideration of}} public health implications. Commercial plants will require coal quantities {{greater than or equal}} to 20, 000 tons/day and the large size of these plants calls for careful consideration of the potential health hazards from the wastes and products of such processes. Analysis of pollution potential can roughly be divided into three categories: raw material structure and constituents, process design, and mode of plant operation. Identifiable pollutants include hydrogen cyanide, phenols, cresols, carbonyl and <b>hydrogen</b> <b>sulfides,</b> ammonia, mercaptans, thiocyanides, aniline, arsenic, trace metals and various polycyclic hydrocarbons. One study of workers in a hydrogenation process has revealed an incidence of skin cancer 16 - 37 times that expected in the chemical industry. In addition, a number of high boiling point liquid products were identified as being carcinogenic, and air concentrations of benzo[a]pyrene up to 18, 000 mug/ 1000 m 3 were reported. Health statistics on occupational groups in other coal conversion industries have shown significantly higher lung cancer rates, relative to groups without such occupational exposures. These data suggest that coal hydrogenation plants must be carefully planned and controlled to avoid harm to environmentally and occupationally exposed populations...|$|R
40|$|<b>Hydrogen</b> <b>sulfides</b> have {{recently}} received {{a great deal}} of interest due to the record high superconducting temperatures of up to 203 K observed on strong compression of dihydrogen sulfide (H 2 S). A joint theoretical and experimental study is presented in which decomposition products and structures of compressed H 2 S are characterized, and their superconducting properties are calculated. In addition to the experimentally known H 2 S and H 3 S phases, our first-principles structure searches have identified several energetically competitive stoichiometries that have not been reported previously: H 2 S 3, H 3 S 2, HS 2, and H 4 S 3. In particular, H 4 S 3 is predicted to be thermodynamically stable within a large pressure range of 25 - 113 GPa. High-pressure x-ray diffraction measurements confirm the presence of H 3 S and H 4 S 3 through decomposition of H 2 S that emerges at 27 GPa and coexists with residual H 2 S, at least up to the highest pressure of 140 GPa studied in our experiments. Electron-phonon coupling calculations show that H 4 S 3 has a small T-c of below 2 K, and that H 2 S is mainly responsible for the observed superconductivity of samples prepared at low temperature (< 100 K) ...|$|R
40|$|Hydrothermal fluids {{passing through}} basaltic rocks along mid-ocean ridges {{are known to}} be enriched in sulfide, while those {{circulating}} through ultramafic mantle rocks are typically elevated in hydrogen. Therefore, {{it has been estimated that}} the maximum energy in basalt-hosted systems is available through sulfide oxidation and in ultramafic-hosted systems through hydrogen oxidation. Furthermore, thermodynamic models suggest that the greatest biomass potential arises from sulfide oxidation in basalt-hosted and from hydrogen oxidation in ultramafic-hosted systems. We tested these predictions by measuring biological <b>sulfide</b> and <b>hydrogen</b> removal and subsequent autotrophic CO 2 fixation in chemically distinct hydrothermal fluids from basalt-hosted and ultramafic-hosted vents. We found a large potential of microbial hydrogen oxidation in naturally hydrogen-rich (ultramafic-hosted) but also in naturally hydrogen-poor (basalt-hosted) hydrothermal fluids. Moreover, hydrogen oxidation–based primary production proved to be highly attractive under our incubation conditions regardless whether hydrothermal fluids from ultramafic-hosted or basalt-hosted sites were used. Site-specific <b>hydrogen</b> and <b>sulfide</b> availability alone did not appear to determine whether <b>hydrogen</b> or <b>sulfide</b> oxidation provides the energy for primary production by the free-living microbes in the tested hydrothermal fluids. This suggests that more complex features (e. g., a combination of oxygen, temperature, biological interactions) may play a role for determining which energy source is preferably used in chemically distinct hydrothermal vent biotopes...|$|R
5|$|Chemolithotrophy {{is a type}} of {{metabolism}} {{found in}} prokaryotes where energy is obtained from the oxidation of inorganic compounds.

These microbial processes are important in global biogeochemical cycles such as acetogenesis, nitrification and denitrification and are critical for soil fertility.|$|E

5|$|Reactions of {{elemental}} fluorine with metals require varying conditions. Alkali metals cause {{explosions and}} alkaline earth metals display vigorous activity in bulk; to prevent passivation from {{the formation of}} metal fluoride layers, most other metals such as aluminium and iron must be powdered, and noble metals require pure fluorine gas at 300–450°C (575–850°F). Some solid nonmetals (sulfur, phosphorus) react vigorously in liquid air temperature fluorine. <b>Hydrogen</b> <b>sulfide</b> and sulfur dioxide combine readily with fluorine, the latter sometimes explosively; sulfuric acid exhibits much less activity, requiring elevated temperatures.|$|E
40|$|In {{the field}} of ground-gas {{monitoring}} and risk assessment, the concentrations and flows of ground-gas from contaminated sites are usually measured in-situ using handheld or transportable field instruments followed with ex-situ analysis. These portable instruments only give spot data of the gases being monitored and few of their controls. However, and more recently, it has been discovered that ground-gas concentrations and flows are temporarily and spatially variable, with the accompanying realization that the existing instruments {{are not able to}} resolve these problems. For example, contaminated sites investigation shows that environment conditions such as pressure, temperature, water level, and air movement substantially affect ground-gas concentrations on the range of timescales, therefore; uncertainty will always exist when using methods that lack temporal resolution. This paper describes the most recent instrumentation that provides real time continuous gas data both inside borehole and ambient air for parameters such as methane, carbon dioxide, volatile organic compounds (VOCs), <b>hydrogen</b> <b>sulfides,</b> oxygen and carbon monoxide alongside atmospheric and borehole pressures.

5|$|The {{hydroxides}} {{themselves are}} the most basic hydroxides known, reacting with acids to give salts and with alcohols to give oligomeric alkoxides.

They react with amphoteric oxides: for example, the oxides of aluminium, zinc, tin, and lead react with the alkali metal hydroxides to give aluminates, zincates, stannates, and plumbates. Silicon dioxide is acidic, and thus the alkali metal hydroxides can also attack silicate glass.|$|E
