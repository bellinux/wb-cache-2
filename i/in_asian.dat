40|$|OBJECTIVE [...] To {{compare the}} {{presentation}} and natural course of first myocardial infarctions <b>in</b> immigrant <b>Asians</b> and the indigenous white population in Britain {{and the subsequent}} risk states of the two groups. DESIGN [...] Prospective ethnic comparison of consecutive patients with first myocardial infarctions. SETTING [...] Secondary referrals to a coronary care unit of a district general hospital. PATIENTS [...] 128 Men (77 white, 54 Asian) presenting consecutively with a first myocardial infarction diagnosed {{on the basis of}} clinical, biochemical, and electrocardiographic findings. END POINT [...] Identification of mechanisms accounting for the increased rate of ischaemic heart disease <b>in</b> <b>Asians.</b> MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS [...] Infarct size was assessed by measuring the release of creatine phosphokinase (all patients), radionuclide ventriculography (50), and contrast ventriculography (103). Risk states after infarction were assessed from the degree of ventricular dysfunction as determined by exercise electrocardiography (82 patients) and from the extent of coronary atheroma as determined by coronary arteriography (103). Glucose state was measured in fasting venous blood samples. Overall the relative rate of infarction was 4. 9 times higher <b>in</b> <b>Asians</b> (95 % confidence interval 3. 4 to 6. 9) than in the white population. Moreover, the relative rate of infarction was higher <b>in</b> <b>Asians</b> <b>in</b> all 10 year age groups, the greatest difference being in 30 - 39 year olds. The mean age of the Asian denominator population was 47. 1 years compared with 49. 5 years in the white population. Age at infarction was less <b>in</b> <b>Asians</b> (50. 2 years) than in white patients (55. 5 years; mean difference 5. 5 years (95 % confidence interval 2. 5 to 7. 1]. <b>In</b> <b>Asians</b> the mean creatine phosphokinase activity was 777 (95 % confidence interval 155 to 1399) U/ 1 higher, radionuclide ejection fraction 8. 9 % (1. 0 % to 16. 9 %) lower, and left ventricular fractional shortening 4. 8 % (1. 4 % to 8. 2 %) lower than in white patients. The extent of coronary atheroma was significantly greater <b>in</b> <b>Asians.</b> The mean numbers of plaques in vessels not associated with infarction were 3. 66 (median 3. 0, range 0 - 10) <b>in</b> <b>Asians</b> compared with 1. 97 (median 2. 0, range 0 - 6) in white patients (p less than 0. 001), and a higher proportion of Asians had three vessel coronary artery disease (p less than 0. 001). Asians with diabetes or impaired glucose tolerance did not differ from those with normal blood glucose values. CONCLUSIONS [...] Atherogenesis arises earlier <b>in</b> <b>Asians,</b> contributing to premature first myocardial infarctions. The increased incidence of diabetes <b>in</b> <b>Asians</b> may not <b>in</b> itself be relevant in the greater propensity to coronary atheroma <b>in</b> <b>Asians...</b>|$|R

In the present study, the angiographic features of consecutive series of 87 Caucasians, 83 British Asian and 30 <b>Asian</b> patients <b>in</b> India with coronary artery disease were assessed. Blood samples at fasting and after ingestion of 75 g of dextrose were taken to assess the extent of diabetes. Fasting blood samples were also taken for measurement of cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and triglyceride. Coronary angiograms were scored by two independent observers who were blinded to the patients' ethnic origin. The Asians were younger than the Caucasians, but {{did not differ in}} their body mass index, systolic or diastolic blood pressure or in cigarette consumption. Lipids were similar apart from Indian Asians having lower cholesterol than British Asians, and Caucasians having lower triglyceride than Asians. There were more diabetics <b>in</b> <b>Asians</b> than <b>in</b> Caucasians. <b>Asians</b> <b>in</b> Britain wait longer than Caucasians and <b>Asians</b> <b>in</b> India from onset of angina to undergoing coronary angiography. The presence of triple vessel disease was not significantly different (P = 0. 19) in the three groups, that is, 38 %, 43 % and 27 % <b>in</b> Caucasians, British <b>Asians</b> and Indian Asians, respectively. The geometric mean coronary score was 26. 3 (C. I. 22. 6 - 30. 6), 25. 3 (C. I. 21. 8 - 29. 4), and 25. 2 (C. I. 19. 6 - 32. 5) <b>in</b> Caucasians, British <b>Asians</b> and Indian Asians, respectively. This difference was not significant (P = 0. 92). Total number of lesions more than three were similar, that is, in 25 % Caucasian, 41 % British Asian and 40 % Indian Asian patients (P < 0. 10). British Asians had less proximal disease (P = 0. 0002), and Indian Asians less distal disease (P = 0. 003) compared to Caucasians. Non-discrete (long) lesions were more prevalent <b>in</b> <b>Asians</b> than Caucasians (P = 0. 0005) The total number of lesions more than three <b>in</b> diabetic <b>Asians</b> was significantly more than in the non-diabetic, 71 % versus 31 % <b>in</b> British <b>Asians</b> (P = 0. 002) and 90 % versus 15 % <b>in</b> Indian <b>Asians</b> (P= 0. 0001). The relationship between diabetes and long lesions in both British and Indian Asians was highly significant (P < 0. 00001 and P < 0. 001, respectively).
