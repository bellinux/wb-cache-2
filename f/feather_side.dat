25|$|The Aleut and Ainu {{people of}} the North Pacific {{traditionally}} hunted tufted puffin for food and feathers. Skins were used to make tough parkas worn <b>feather</b> <b>side</b> in and the silky tufts were sewn into ornamental work. Currently, harvesting of tufted puffin is illegal or discouraged throughout its range.|$|E
30|$|DIP-V- 15153 (Fig. 5 c) {{contains}} two feathers that are truncated basally. The amber surface provides a lateral {{view of the}} <b>feathers</b> <b>side</b> by side and with the tips deflected dorsally (towards the right in Fig. 5 c) by interactions with a resin flow. The rachis tapers distally to just the rachidial ridge, and rami origination points are located on the very posterior edges of the laminae. Long barbs with blunt apices contain reduced, slightly curved barbules that continue as rachidial barbules. Apparent pale brown coloration is generated through diffuse pigmentation in the barbules, barb rami, and rachis.|$|R
50|$|Allen {{started writing}} {{short stories and}} cartoon {{captions}} for magazines such as The New Yorker; he {{was inspired by the}} tradition of New Yorker humorists S. J. Perelman, George S. Kaufman, Robert Benchley and Max Shulman, whose material he modernized.Allen has published four collections of his short pieces and plays. These are Getting Even, Without <b>Feathers,</b> <b>Side</b> Effects, and Mere Anarchy. His early comic fiction was heavily influenced by the zany, pun-ridden humour of S.J. Perelman. In 2010, Allen released digital spoken word versions of his four books, in which he reads 73 short story selections from his work and for which he was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Spoken Word Album.|$|R
50|$|Wakatobi flowerpeckers exhibit sexual dimorphism. Males have {{dark gray}} {{feathers}} {{on the back}} and tail, white feathers on the belly, and red feathers on the chin. Females have medium gray feathers {{on the back and}} tail and light gray to white feathers on the belly and chin. Compared to the closely related grey-sided flowerpecker, the Wakatobi flowerpecker is significantly larger: it has longer wings, a longer bill, a longer skull, and is heavier. Additionally, there are subtle color variations: compared to the grey-sided flowerpecker, male Wakatobi flowerpeckers have bluer upper <b>feathers,</b> lighter <b>side</b> <b>feathers,</b> and their red coloring extends further down. For females there are no major color differences between the two species. The species feeds primarily on fruit.|$|R

5000|$|Unlike the centurion, the cuirass {{was not the}} {{distinguishing}} part of the optios uniform. The identifying part {{would be}} his helmet; this would have had plumes of horse hair or <b>feathers</b> on either <b>side</b> of his helmet that could {{be accompanied by a}} helmet crest.|$|R
50|$|White-tailed {{ptarmigan}} {{males are}} usually monogamous and {{remain with the}} same mate for one breeding season. To attract females, a male will strut and display his tail feathers. The female builds a simple scrape nest on the ground, while the male acts as a sentry to guard the area. The nest is a shallow depression in a snow-free area, generally protected from the wind and is softened with grasses and a few <b>feathers.</b> One <b>side</b> of the nest generally provides a quick escape route.|$|R

5000|$|One {{particularly}} famous Moche portrait vessel {{is known}} as the Huaco Retrato Mochica. The portrait was made during the Late Moche period (ca. 600 CE), according to the chronology made by Rafael Larco Hoyle in 1948. The ceramic portrait is also an example of a stirrup spout vessel of a Moche ruler. The ruler is depicted wearing a material turban on which there is a headdress decorated by a two-headed bird with <b>feathers</b> on <b>side.</b> The effigy also wears tubular earrings that {{can be found in the}} [...] "Gold and Silver Gallery" [...] of the Larco Museum.|$|R
500|$|More than {{a century}} ago, winds were {{initially}} plotted as arrows facing downwind, with <b>feathers</b> on both <b>sides</b> of the staff to indicate wind speed.

50|$|The {{cockatiel}} is now biologically {{classified as}} a genuine member of Cacatuidae on account of sharing all of the cockatoo family's biological features, namely, the erectile crest, a gallbladder, powder down, suppressed cloudy-layer (which precludes the display of blue and green structural colours), and facial <b>feathers</b> covering the <b>sides</b> of the beak, {{all of which are}} rarely found outside the family Cacatuidae.|$|R
60|$|As Buck slid {{along with}} the obscureness of a gliding shadow, his nose was jerked {{suddenly}} to the side as though a positive force had gripped and pulled it. He followed the new scent into a thicket and found Nig. He was lying on his side, dead where he had dragged himself, an arrow protruding, head and <b>feathers,</b> from either <b>side</b> of his body.|$|R
50|$|In copulation, the female, when perched, tilts forward, {{allowing}} the male to land {{with his feet}} lodged on her horizontal back. The female twists and moves her tail <b>feathers</b> to one <b>side,</b> while the mounted male twists his cloacal opening around the female's cloaca. Copulation lasts 5 to 10 seconds and during pre-nesting courtship in late winter or early spring can occur numerous times each day.|$|R
50|$|Head: Lightly curved, longish {{and narrow}} {{with a fairly}} flat frontal. The crest {{develops}} {{from the back of}} the shoulders and runs up to the apex, and here developing into a sharp conical point upon the head. The <b>feathers</b> from both <b>sides</b> of the shoulders converge together into a ridge or niche which runs up the back of the neck to form the crest.|$|R
25|$|With the Industrial Relations Act {{coming into}} effect, at the {{beginning}} of August 1972 Adamson agreed with Victor Feather of the TUC to set up an independent conciliation and advice service. According to <b>Feather</b> both <b>sides</b> saw this as one means of minimising the use of the Act. Through 1973 the government, CBI and TUC tried to establish a working relationship which suited all, but were unable to do so before the economic effects of the oil price rise caused profound disruption to the British economy. On other issues Adamson was strongly supportive of the Government, including giving consistent backing to entry to the European Communities. His leadership in this area was said to be crucial.|$|R
50|$|The grey {{crowned crane}} is about 1 m (3.3 ft) tall, weighs 3.5 kg (7.7 lbs), {{and has a}} {{wingspan}} of 2 m (6.5 ft). Its body plumage is mainly grey. The wings are predominantly white, but contain feathers {{with a range of}} colours. The head has a crown of stiff golden <b>feathers.</b> The <b>sides</b> of the face are white, and there is a bright red inflatable throat pouch. The bill is relatively short and grey, and the legs are black. They have long legs for wading through the grasses. The feet are large, yet slender, adapted for balance rather than defence or grasping. The sexes are similar, although males tend to be slightly larger. Young birds are greyer than adults, with a feathered buff face.|$|R
50|$|Another {{bird species}} found here, {{one that is}} truly endangered, is the red-cockaded woodpecker. It found {{throughout}} the Sam Houston National Forest and frequently spotted by observant visitors. The small black and white woodpecker with distinctive large white cheek patches is slightly larger than a bluebird. The male has a single streak of red <b>feathers</b> on each <b>side</b> of his head. Its unique high-pitched, squeaky call can be recognized at considerable distances.|$|R
50|$|Atef, {{the crown}} of Osiris, is a {{combination}} of Upper Egypt’s white crown, the hedjet, and ostrich <b>feathers</b> on either <b>side.</b> It also often has a golden disc at its tip. The ostrich feathers, similar to those representing ma’at, symbolize truth, justice, morality, and balance. They represent the cult center of Orisis as well, which is located in Busiris. The atef is typically worn atop a pair of ram or bull horns as a circlet.|$|R
50|$|There {{were also}} Royal Bonnevilles {{exported}} to the United States to the specification of Triumph Motorcycles America. These were like UK Royals but with black frames and gold-lined, black tanks. The stylised Prince Of Wales's <b>feathers</b> on their <b>side</b> panel badges were retained {{next to the}} word 'Royal' but the '1981' date was deleted. Their engines were finished in black like the UK version but with polished covers like the US version.|$|R
50|$|The {{bones of}} the tail have not been {{preserved}} in any known specimen, but comparison with related species suggest it was short with a small, plowshare-shaped pygostyle bone, to which the tail feathers anchored. A mass of muscles, called the rectorial bulb, probably was present to control the fanning of the trail feathers. The tail feathers were long, with symmetrical vanes. There were at least 10 tail feathers (rectrices), more than in other primitive fan-tailed birds. The overall shape of the tail was rounded and wedge-shaped when viewed from above; due to the symmetrical <b>feathers,</b> the <b>sides</b> of the tail were probably not held fully fanned into the wind but swept back, forming a partially fanned wedge, as in some modern birds like accipiters, tyrant flycatchers and sunbitterns.|$|R
40|$|Hatlet {{of black}} velvet ribbon, feathers, beads, and sequins. The hatlet is formed on {{a base of}} black velvet ribbon which creates an open oval at top back of head, and has a {{cross-piece}} across head and with extending swallow-tail piece towards wearer's temple. Along front, the ribbon is embellished with sequins and beads, {{and there is a}} large pouf of black, curly <b>feathers</b> at right <b>side,</b> which extends across front. The hatlet is unlined, and has no labels...|$|R
50|$|The upperparts are {{a golden}} green colour and the rump has a white bar. The throat and breast are a {{brilliant}} emerald green. The legs are feathered {{down to the}} feet with horny white short feathers. The tail is brownish black and deeply forked. The tail <b>feathers</b> on either <b>side</b> increase in length from the centre and the outermost ones are exceptionally long and have bare shafts tipped by oval plumes, which gives the species its common name.|$|R
50|$|The tail shows {{completely}} preserved retrices along {{each side}} of the long, bony tail. They are paired, with one <b>feather</b> on each <b>side</b> of each vertebra from the sixth caudal onward to the tip. The proximal five pairs are 60 mm in length, and increase strongly in size until reaching a maximum length of 120 mm at the eleventh caudal; here they begin decreasing until a terminal length of 90 mm is reached at the tail tip.|$|R
50|$|The acronym OSIRIS {{was chosen}} in {{reference}} to the ancient mythological Egyptian god Osiris, the underworld lord of the dead. He was classically depicted as a green-skinned man with a pharaoh's beard, partially mummy-wrapped at the legs and wearing a distinctive crown with two large ostrich <b>feathers</b> at either <b>side.</b> Rex means 'king' in Latin. His name was chosen for this mission as asteroid Bennu is a threatening Earth impactor, with an estimated 1-in-1,800 chance of hitting Earth in the year 2170.|$|R
