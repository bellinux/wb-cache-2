40|$|International audienceThis chapter about <b>etymological</b> <b>dictionaries</b> covers mainly two topics. First, it provides, based {{mostly on}} {{examples}} from European languages, a broad analysis of contemporary practices in etymographical work concerning turn in turn inherited lexicon, borrowings, and internal creations, i. e. the three grand etymological classes which {{make their own}} different demands of an etymologist. Then it tackles some issues the author considers of particular interest in current etymography: the dictionary's underlying definition of etymology, the word-list, what should be considered the etymological (and etymographical) unit, etimologia prossima vs. etimologia remota, the degree of formalization, and the prickly question of bringing <b>etymological</b> <b>dictionaries</b> to an end...|$|R
50|$|Older literature, {{as well as}} {{some older}} <b>etymological</b> <b>dictionaries,</b> often posit some alleged Eastern Iranian or Celtic source of all Slavic etymons with unclear etymologies, which in reality have very little {{linguistic}} support. Dispute on them ranges from all-inclusive to all-denial.|$|R

5000|$|The {{segmentation}} of {{the name}} into Ario- and -vistus is well established. A 19th-century connection between Ehre, [...] "honor", and Ario- {{turned out to be}} invalid.

500|$|In the {{vocabulary}} of the Yugoslav Academy, {{as well as in}} the <b>etymological</b> <b>dictionary</b> of Slavic languages, the word gibanica is a derivative of the Serbian verb /, which means [...] "to fold; sway, swing, rock".

The <b>etymological</b> <b>dictionary</b> of Corominas says the origin is uncertain, but it suggests that it comes from the Vulgar Latin , plural of , [...] "sword hilt". The word cachalot came to English via French from Spanish or Portuguese , perhaps from Galician/Portuguese , [...] "big head".

There were many variations such as barley-bay, barley-bees, barlow or barrels. The use of barlay as a truce term appears in the 14th century poem Sir Gawayne and the Grene Knight and Tobias Smollett's The Reprisal. It is recorded in lexicographer John Jamieson's 1808 <b>Etymological</b> <b>Dictionary</b> of the Scottish Language as a term specifically used by children to demand truce.

500|$|While his output {{covered a}} wide range of topics, he {{is best known for his}} {{contributions}} to botanical history, taxonomy, botanical bibliography, and botanical illustration. Botanical Latin (4 editions 1966–1992), is his best known work, having become a standard reference and described as both the bible of plant taxonomists and a philological masterwork. It was begun during the war years and the first edition was basically a guide to Latin for botanists with no or limited knowledge of the language, which he described as a [...] "do-it-yourself Latin kit" [...] for taxonomists. Later, the work evolved into an <b>etymological</b> <b>dictionary,</b> but the Stearn learned that such a work had already been published in the Netherlands before the war. He then continued to expand it with the assistance of his wife and son, systematically collecting botanical terms from botanical texts. It is said that only he could have written this work, which explains not just the derivation of plant names but also the philological principles involved in forming those names. The work is considered responsible for the continued survival of Latin as the lingua franca of botany. In addition to this seminal text, he frequently delighted in the illumination that the classics could add to understanding plants and plant lore, such as his Five Brethren of the Rose (1965).|$|E
