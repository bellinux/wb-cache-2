500|$|The Freelancer team kept a {{low profile}} {{throughout}} 2001 before displaying a demo of their latest work at International Games Festival 2002, drawing large crowds. [...] Microsoft announced the project was on schedule, and Digital Anvil added all the planned content for the game by October 2002. [...] A beta test with approximately 500testers was conducted, and the only main activities left were to refine the game's features and to <b>fix</b> <b>errors</b> uncovered in the testing. [...] The game shipped to retailers on March4, 2003, and was later available online through Yahoo's Game on Demand service. [...] Digital Anvil's role on Freelancer ended on June6, 2003, with their delivery of a software patch to resolve issues on the server and cheating; the staff were redeployed to other departments in Microsoft. [...] In accordance with their 5-year support policy for software, Microsoft stopped supporting the game on April8, 2008, and shutdown their global server, which managed the list of multiplayer servers and the connection of players to them.|$|E
500|$|DJ Hero {{primarily}} simulates turntablism, {{a musical}} style used by disc jockeys {{to create a}} new mashup song by incorporating one or more previously recorded songs played on record players along with sound effect generators. The game features score attack gameplay similar to the Guitar Hero games. The controller consists of a wireless deck consisting of a movable turntable that supports 3 [...] "stream" [...] buttons, an effects dial, a crossfader, and a [...] "Euphoria" [...] button; a hidden panel contains additional controller buttons to interact with the gaming console outside of the game. A portion of the controller can be detached and reattached to adapt the unit for left-handed players. Notes travel in an arc across a spinning record on screen, and the player holds down one of the 3 stream buttons to play notes; two buttons reflect the two songs used in that particular mix, and the third represents samples to add to the mix which can be adjusted with the effects dial. The player must also constantly adjust the crossfader to match onscreen symbols, which alters the relative volume of the songs as to bring one song to the forefront of the mix for a short time. Certain tracks are shown on screen as a series of up or down arrow, representing scratching sections, requiring the player to turn the turntable {{in the direction of the}} arrows while holding down the button to score points, mimicking the scratching of the record needle on vinyl albums. [...] "Euphoria" [...] is equivalent to Guitar Heros Star Power, collected by successfully completing specific phrases in the song mix, called Perfect Regions, and can be released by pressing the Euphoria button, doubling the player's current multiplier as well as automatic crossfading when active. There is also a [...] "Rewind" [...] meter that builds through consistent successful playing, and once full, allows the player to rewind the song to <b>fix</b> <b>errors</b> in their performance. The player must continue to perform well or their performance meter will drop and the music track will cut out. Failing the song is not possible, unlike in Guitar Hero games.|$|E

30|$|We look at {{precision}} and recall of corrections, {{which are the}} rate of correctly <b>fixed</b> <b>errors</b> over all <b>fixes</b> made {{and the rate of}} correctly <b>fixed</b> <b>errors</b> over all conflict-introducing errors, respectively. Table 1 summarizes numbers of injected errors, conflict-introducing errors, and scores for tuple-wise detection, cell-wise detection (same as shown in Figs. 5, 3, 7), and scores for correction (skewness 0.25, a weak skew). Simply injecting errors to the datasets did not produce sufficient number of conflicts, so we repeated all tuples in the datasets so each tuple appears twice, which leads to sufficient number of conflicts for evaluation.|$|R
