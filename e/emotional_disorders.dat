25|$|Max Weber {{and some}} schools of {{modernization}} theory suggest that cultural values could affect economic success. However, researchers have gathered evidence {{that suggest that}} values are not as deeply ingrained and that changing economic opportunities explain most of the movement {{into and out of}} poverty, as opposed to shifts in values. Studies have shown that poverty changes the personalities of children who live in it. The Great Smoky Mountains Study was a ten-year study that was unexpectedly able to demonstrate this. During the study, about one-quarter of the families saw a dramatic and unexpected increase in income. The study showed that among these children, instances of behavioral and <b>emotional</b> <b>disorders</b> decreased, and conscientiousness and agreeableness increased.|$|E
40|$|Little {{is known}} about the role of {{personality}} characteristics in service utilisation for mental health problems. We investigate whether neuroticism: 1) predicts the use of primary and specialised care services for mental health problems, independently of whether a person has an emotional disorder; and 2) modifies any association between <b>emotional</b> <b>disorder</b> and service use. Data were derived from the Netherlands Mental Health Survey and Incidence Study (NEMESIS) a prospective cohort study in the general population aged 18 - 64. Neuroticism was recorded at baseline, and <b>emotional</b> <b>disorder</b> and service use at 12 -month follow-up, in a representative sample (N= 7076), using the Composite International Diagnostic Interview. People with high neuroticism were more likely to receive care in the specialised mental health sector, and after entry to care they made more visits to the services, whether or not they had an <b>emotional</b> <b>disorder.</b> If they had an <b>emotional</b> <b>disorder,</b> their likelihood of receiving specialised mental health care showed an additional increase. Neuroticism also predicted the use of primary care for mental health problems, but greater numbers of visits were made only by clients with both high neuroticism and an <b>emotional</b> <b>disorder.</b> It would be useful to incorporate personality characteristics into models to understand variations in service utilisation for mental health problems. The findings suggest that professionals would be wise to focus not just on their clients' <b>emotional</b> problems and <b>disorders,</b> but also on strengthening their problem-solving abilities through approaches like cognitive behavioural therapy...|$|R

BACKGROUND: Anxiety and {{depression}} are common in young people and are associated with a range of adverse outcomes. Research has suggested a relationship between <b>emotional</b> <b>disorder</b> and poor school attendance, and thus poor attendance may serve as a red flag for children at risk of <b>emotional</b> <b>disorder.</b> This systematic review aims to investigate the association between child and adolescent <b>emotional</b> <b>disorder</b> and poor attendance at school. METHODS: We will search electronic databases from a variety of disciplines including medicine, psychology, education and social sciences, as well as sources of grey literature, to identify any quantitative studies that investigate the relationship between <b>emotional</b> <b>disorder</b> and school attendance. <b>Emotional</b> <b>disorder</b> may refer to diagnoses of mood or anxiety disorders using standardised diagnostic measures, or measures of depression, anxiety or "internalising symptoms" using a continuous scale. Definitions for school non-attendance vary, and we aim to include any relevant terminology, including attendance, non-attendance, school refusal, school phobia, absenteeism and truancy. Two independent reviewers will screen identified papers and extract data from included studies. We will assess the risk of bias of included studies using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. Random effects meta-analysis will be used to pool quantitative findings when studies use the same measure of association, otherwise a narrative synthesis approach will be used. DISCUSSION: This systematic review will provide a detailed synthesis of evidence regarding the relationship between childhood <b>emotional</b> <b>disorder</b> and poor attendance at school. Understanding this relationship has the potential to assist in the development of strategies to improve the identification of and intervention for this vulnerable group.

25|$|Experimental method: This {{method is}} an {{experimental}} paradigm {{used to study}} human experiences involved in the studies of sensation and perception, learning and memory, motivation, and biological psychology. The experimental psychologist usually deals with intact organisms although studies are often conducted with organisms modified by surgery, radiation, drug treatment, or long-standing deprivations of various kinds or with organisms that naturally present organic abnormalities or <b>emotional</b> <b>disorders.</b> Economists and psychologists have developed a variety of experimental methodologies to elicit and assess individual attitudes where each emotion differs for each individual. The results are then gathered and quantified to conclude if specific experiences have any common factors.

25|$|Music therapy {{finds its}} roots in the military. The United States Department of War issued Technical Bulletin 187 in 1945, which {{described}} the use of music in the recuperation of military service members in Army hospitals. The use of music therapy in military settings started to flourish and develop following World War II and research and endorsements from both the United States Army and the Surgeon General of the United States. Although these endorsements helped music therapy develop, there was still a recognized need to assess the true viability and value of music as a medically-based therapy. Walter Reed Army Medical Center and the Office of the Surgeon General worked together to lead one of the earliest assessments of a music therapy program. The goal {{of the study was to}} understand whether “music presented according to a specific plan” influenced recovery among service members with mental and <b>emotional</b> <b>disorders.</b> Eventually, case reports in reference to this study relayed not only the importance but also the impact of music therapy services in the recovery of military service personnel.|$|E

40|$|Background: The {{psychological}} impact of abortion is a controversial issue. While some {{studies indicate that}} women who had elective abortions present lower psychological distress when compared with those who had spontaneous or therapeutic abortions, other studies found abortion {{to be associated with}} significant psychological distress. Objectives: To assess psychological adjustment (<b>emotional</b> <b>disorder,</b> trauma symptoms and couple relationship) one and six months after abortion, and gender differences regarding psychological adjustment, and to assess the moderation role of couple relationship in the effect of the etiology of abortion on <b>emotional</b> <b>disorder</b> and trauma symptoms. Methods: Women (n= 50) with different etiologies of abortion agreed to participate, as well as 15 partners (N= 65). Assessments took place one and six months after abortion. Measures included the Brief Symptoms Inventory, the Impact of Event Scale-Revised and the Relationship Questionnaire. Results: A decrease in <b>emotional</b> <b>disorder</b> for all etiologies of abortion and an increase in perceived quality of couple relationship in therapeutic abortion were observed over time.

Encopresis is a term that is usually applied when there are no such anatomical defects present. The ICD-10 classifies nonorganic encopresis under [...] "behavioural and <b>emotional</b> <b>disorders</b> with onset usually occurring in childhood and adolescence" [...] and organic causes of encopresis along with FI. [...] FI can also be classified according to gender, since the cause in females may be different from males, for example it may develop following radical prostatectomy in males, whereas females may develop FI as an immediate or delayed consequence of damage whilst giving birth. Pelvic anatomy is also different according to gender, with a wider pelvic outlet in females.|$|E

In adolescent and young-adult offspring of parents with major depressive disorder, this study examined the effects of a second affected parent, offspring gender, gender of the depressed parent and their interactions on risk of depression and anxiety disorder. We found that daughters bad a higher risk of depression and anxiety than sons and that offspring of depressed mothers had a. higher risk of anxiety than offspring of depressed fathers. In addition to these main effects, we found an interaction between parent and offspring gender inasmuch that sons of depressed fathers had the lowest risk of depression and anxiety relative to the other groups. A second affected parent tended to increase risk of depression and significantly increased risk of anxiety. However, this effect of a second affected parent on offspring anxiety was most prominent in daughters when the second affected parent was the father; whereas risk in sons did not increase if the father was affected as well.
