25|$|During his {{overnight}} stay at Titusville, Brooks had repaired the aircraft, using the propeller from the aircraft {{involved in the}} forced landing. He had also placed wooden toothpicks in the vent holes on his <b>fuel</b> <b>cap</b> to prevent moist air from entering and condensing overnight. On February 25, Brooks took off to complete the flight, circled out over the Atlantic where his motor quit and he went down off Melbourne, Florida. The wreckage of the Ford Flivver washed up, but the pilot was never found.

25|$|Both four-door {{sedan and}} five-door station wagon {{variants}} were available as before, although trim levels {{were limited to}} SLX and GS. The SLX was aimed at fleet markets, fitted with power steering, a radio cassette player, a remote boot and <b>fuel</b> <b>cap</b> release, and electric side-view mirrors. The sedan-only SLX V6 added four-wheel disc brakes over the 2.2 model's front-disc, rear-drum layout, with anti-lock brakes (ABS) on the V6 available as an option. Wagons without ABS fitted made do with a load-sensing valve mechanism to control rear brake lock-up. The higher GS trim built on the SLX level, adding 60/40 split-fold rear seats, variable intermittent windscreen wipers, a four-speaker stereo, tachometer, central locking and a more luxurious interior upholstery style.|$|E

2500|$|The basic {{patented}} design {{allowed a}} series of features to be deployed on the spar-frame that would later allow quick development of new models. The original Vespa featured a rear pillion seat for a passenger, or optionally a storage compartment.

Chill block installation was preferred to improve permanent molds for reducing porosities. There were not regular {{to obtain an}} appropriated chill vent from this method unless an experience of mold makers. This research was performed to investigate and evaluate the chill block performance in the HPDC mold of motorcycle <b>fuel</b> <b>caps.</b> The HPDC mold of the thin and complex shape product without chill vents was improved by inserting of chill blocks. The motorcycle <b>fuel</b> <b>caps</b> of molds with and without chill vents were compared to verify size and position of porosity defects. Furthermore the HPDC simulation using the finite element analysis (FEA) had been performed according to the physical experiment.
