5|$|Having {{abandoned}} {{not only}} the concert stage, but also the income that went with it, Ornstein signed an exclusive contract with the Ampico label to make piano rolls. He made over two dozen rolls for Ampico, mostly of a nonmodernist repertoire; the composers he performed most often were Chopin, Schumann, and Liszt. Two rolls contained his own compositions: Berceuse (Cradle Song) (c. 1920–21) and Prélude tragique (1924). Ornstein never recorded, in any format, <b>even</b> <b>a</b> <b>single</b> example of his futurist pieces which had brought him fame.|$|E

5|$|Thaïs (1894), {{composed}} for Sanderson, was moderately received. Like Werther, it did {{not gain}} widespread popularity among French opera-goers until its first revival, which was {{four years after the}} premiere, by when the composer's association with Sanderson was over. In the same year he had a modest success in Paris with the one-act Le portrait de Manon at the Opéra-Comique, and a much greater one in London with La Navarraise at Covent Garden. The Times commented that in this piece Massenet had adopted the verismo style of such works as Mascagni's Cavalleria rusticana to great effect. The audience clamoured for the composer to acknowledge the applause, but Massenet, always a shy man, declined to take <b>even</b> <b>a</b> <b>single</b> curtain call.|$|E
5|$|With {{the end of}} the Battle of France and the {{evacuation}} of the British Expeditionary Force from the port of Dunkirk between 26 May and 4 June 1940, a German invasion of Great Britain seemed likely. However, the British Army was not well-equipped to defend the country in such an event; in the weeks after the Dunkirk evacuation it could only field twenty-seven divisions. The Army was particularly short of anti-tank guns, 840 of which had been left behind in France, and only 167 were available in Britain; ammunition was so scarce for the remaining guns that regulations forbade <b>even</b> <b>a</b> <b>single</b> round being used for training purposes.|$|E

5|$|Anderitum is {{recorded}} in the Notitia Dignitatum as {{the base of the}} praepositus numeri Abulcorum – an infantry unit or numerus of the limitanei or border forces. It also mentions army and naval units bearing the fort's name in connection with the Vicus Julius, in the Roman army in Gaul and stationed at Lutetia (modern Paris). This suggests that by the time the Notitia was written, the original garrison had been moved to Gaul and replaced with the numerus Abulcorum. The Abulci are mentioned in connection with the field army in Gaul and in the suppression of the rebellion of Magnentius in Pannonia Secunda in 351. It is not known whether their name is a geographical or functional one but their description by Zosimus suggests that they were an elite body of troops, who served both in the field army and, probably {{in the form of a}} single detachment, at Anderitum. They may have been foederati, troops raised from allied barbarian tribes and put under the command of a Roman prefect, or perhaps <b>even</b> <b>a</b> <b>single</b> band of warriors with their own leader. Similar numeri were {{recorded in the}} Notitia Dignitata as being stationed in other Saxon Shore forts.|$|E
5|$|The {{firing of}} Montagu's guns had given Nicholas pause for concern, but his men had {{occupied}} the fort, {{and he was}} consulting with his officers on their next move when Burke arrived. They obligingly repeated to Burke that they had arrived to take the powder and weapons, and were prepared to assault the town. Burke brought this news back to Browne around 4:00 pm. Rather than advance further on Nassau, Nicholas and his force (200 marines and 50 sailors) remained at Fort Montagu that night. Browne held a war council that evening, in which {{the decision was made}} to attempt the removal of the gunpowder. At midnight, 162 of 200 barrels of gunpowder were loaded onto the Mississippi Packet and HMS St. John, and at 2:00 am they sailed out of Nassau harbor, bound for Saint Augustine. This feat was made possible because Hopkins had neglected to post <b>even</b> <b>a</b> <b>single</b> ship to guard the harbor's entrance channels, leaving the fleet safely anchored in Hanover Sound.|$|E
5|$|The {{root system}} and the shoot system are interdependent – the usually non{{photosynthetic}} root system depends on the shoot system for food, and the usually photosynthetic shoot system depends on water and minerals from the root system. Cells in each system are capable of creating cells of the other and producing adventitious shoots or roots. Stolons and tubers are examples of shoots that can grow roots. Roots that spread out close to the surface, {{such as those of}} willows, can produce shoots and ultimately new plants. In the event that one of the systems is lost, the other can often regrow it. In fact it is possible to grow an entire plant from a single leaf, {{as is the case with}} Saintpaulia, or <b>even</b> <b>a</b> <b>single</b> cell – which can dedifferentiate into a callus (a mass of unspecialised cells) that can grow into a new plant.|$|E
