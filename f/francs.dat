Desgrange then rescheduled the race from 1 to 19 July, increased the total prize money to 20,000 <b>francs,</b> reduced the entry fee to 10 <b>francs</b> and guaranteed at least five <b>francs</b> a day to the first 50 cyclists in the classification. After that, 79 cyclists signed up for the race, of whom 60 actually started the race.|$|E

5|$|In 1821, {{revenue was}} 816,444 <b>francs,</b> {{and the company}} paid a {{dividend}} of 555,500 <b>francs.</b> The company was able to raise its rates without reducing traffic. In 1822, the canal earned almost a million <b>francs</b> from carrying 243,200 tons of coal and 96,000 tons of other merchandise. The concession holders had repaid most of the debts they had incurred to build the canal, including many improvements since it was opened, {{and were able to}} pay healthy dividends. By 1824, the canal was giving annual revenues of 850,000 <b>francs.</b> An 1824 account described a superb water station at Givors on the right bank of the Rhone, an excellent basin at Rive-de-Gier for loading, fine buildings for administration of the canal and spacious shops and warehouses.|$|E
5|$|The first {{shooting}} thaler {{was issued}} for the Chur shooting festival in 1842 and is denominated at four <b>francs.</b> The second, issued for Glarus, has a face value of forty batzen. The third, minted for the shooting festival in Geneva, is denominated at ten <b>francs.</b> A total of eighteen designs were {{struck in the}} nineteenth century, concluding with the Bern issue of 1885. All those struck from 1855 to 1885 bear the denomination of five <b>francs.</b> Many nineteenth-century issues were also struck in various other metals besides silver, including gold and white metal, in small quantities. In 1934, a new series began production. This series, however, was cut short due to the outbreak of World War II. Another series of shooting thalers began mintage in 1984. The first coins issued in this new series were those minted for the festival at Oberhasli. Every year since has seen the mintage of two coins, each bearing the same design, one struck in silver, the other in gold. The only exceptions are the issues of Zürich and Sion in 1999, {{one of which was}} struck in copper–nickel, two in silver and two in gold. Until 1995, silver issues were denominated at fifty <b>francs,</b> while gold pieces were denominated at 1,000 <b>francs.</b> Later, gold issues were denominated at 500 <b>francs,</b> excepting only the Zürich issues of 1999.|$|E
5|$|The {{numerous}} honours and endowments that General Nansouty received {{following the}} Battle of Friedland {{seem to suggest}} the Emperor's appreciation {{and the fact that}} Napoleon did not regard the early incident during this battle as Nansouty's fault. On 11 July 1807, General of Division Nansouty was named Grand Aigle de la Légion d'Honneur, the fifth and top rank of this order, reserved for the greatest general officers. This also brought an annual revenue of 20,000 <b>Francs.</b> His first endowment of 12,846 <b>Francs</b> was offered on 30 June 1807, and was paid by the Duchy of Warsaw. On 23 September, he received another 5,882 <b>Francs</b> on the Empire's Grand Livre. A count of the Empire from 10 March 1808, Nansouty was offered two additional endowments, one of 25,000 <b>Francs,</b> paid by the Kingdom of Westphalia, and the second of 10,000 <b>Francs,</b> paid by the Zeven domain in Hannover. He also received an endowment of 100,000 <b>Francs</b> for the acquisition of a Parisian Hôtel particulier; Nansouty bought the Hôtel du Président Duret in the Faubourg Saint-Germain, a neighbourhood inhabited by the new elite of Imperial France. Indeed, first-rate military figures such as the Viceroy of Italy Eugène, Marshals Davout and Lannes and Generals Rapp and Legrand also acquired residences in Faubourg Saint-Germain.|$|E

5|$|At {{its height}} {{during the period}} of Ravalomanana's presidency, Tiko {{provided}} direct salaried employment to between 1,000 and 3,000 staff and indirect employment to over 10,000. The group was the largest dairy producer in the country and a leader in the national agribusiness sector. The success of his enterprises made Ravalomanana a wealthy man. In the mandatory self-disclosure of wealth submitted to the High Constitutional Court in 2000 by all presidential candidates, Ravalomanana declared ownership of 27 properties valued at over two billion Malagasy <b>francs.</b> He owned 90 per cent of Tiko Inc., 80 per cent of Tiko Agri and 50 per cent of Tiko Oil Products, a portfolio worth 13.1 billion Malagasy <b>francs,</b> and declared 77 million Malagasy <b>francs</b> in annual revenues. Vivier (2007) demonstrates that the valuation of Ravalomanana's holdings and his annual revenue in particular were significantly underestimated.|$|E
