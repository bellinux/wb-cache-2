5|$|Equipping the Salt Wells Pilot Plant {{involved}} <b>its</b> <b>own</b> <b>challenges.</b> Some facilities {{had to be}} fabricated for the purpose. Some {{items were}} hard to locate, while others were in short supply in the wartime economy. The Manhattan Project's overriding priority overcame this problem. In some cases, the Army had representatives at the factories where items were made who designated them for use by Project Camel. Groves felt that his fears about excessive safety were realized: reinforced concrete, blast proof doors and electrical shielding drove up costs. In the end, after 115 days, the first explosives were melted, mixed and poured on 25 July 1945.|$|E
5|$|Bhardwaj {{instructed}} the film's entire {{cast and crew}} to watch caper classics such as Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels (1998), Snatch (2000), Pulp Fiction (1994) and True Romance (1993) to study the nuances and {{become familiar with the}} genre. Shahid Kapoor played both Charlie and Guddu, twin brothers with speech impediments; Charlie has a lisp and Guddu stammers. The producers did not want them to look like caricatures, so Kapoor prepared for both roles by meeting and interacting with speech therapists and people with these impediments. According to Kapoor, the producers wanted to find out about the medical reasons for the impediments and their mental effects. They met specialists and thoroughly researched stammering and lisping. Kapoor said that each role had <b>its</b> <b>own</b> <b>challenges.</b> Charlie's physique was very different from Kapoor's and it took him nearly a year to change the look of his body. He found changing from one character to the other difficult.|$|E
5|$|The {{adventure}} {{is divided}} into 27 encounters across a 16-page module. Encounters are varied and each presents <b>its</b> <b>own</b> <b>challenges.</b> Encounter seven necessitates characters jumping from platform to platform above a sea of hot mud whilst evading erupting geysers; this in turn leads to encounter eight and a room of permanent darkness where a vampire guards Whelm. Encounter 17 occurs in a giant but fragile bubble located above a boiling lake, with the players needing to defeat a giant crab and retrieve Wave without damaging the bubble. Encounter 26 involves negotiating a magical ziggurat populated by various monsters (including sea lions, giant crayfish, giant scorpions, and manticores) before encounter 28, a battle against an ogre mage who possesses Blackrazor. A final challenge on departing is an encounter with two to four efreet if the characters have succeeded in taking {{two or three of}} the magical weapons.|$|E

25|$|Work {{commenced}} on 80 buildings, 52 of them permanent. To {{meet the}} deadline, construction {{was carried out}} around the clock. Equipping the plants involved <b>its</b> <b>own</b> <b>challenges.</b> As soon as specifications were drawn up for certain items, the design group would place orders for them. Some facilities had to be fabricated for the purpose. Some items were hard to locate, while others were in short supply in the wartime economy. The Manhattan Project's overriding priority overcame this problem. In some cases, the Army had representatives at the factories where items were made who designated them {{for use by the}} Manhattan Project and took possession of them as they came off the assembly line. The molds, which needed to be surrounded by cooling water coils, proved difficult to fabricate, and went through several design changes. The melting kettles required stainless steel mixing blades, cooling jackets and tilting supports. Since each held enough high explosive to level a building, they were operated remotely, behind thick concrete walls.|$|E
25|$|Viticulture is most {{commonly}} found in Mediterranean, continental and maritime climates with each unique climate providing <b>its</b> <b>own</b> <b>challenges</b> in providing sufficient water at critical times during the growing season. In Mediterranean climates irrigation is usually needed during the very dry periods of the summer ripening stages where drought can be a persistent threat. The level of humidity in a particular macroclimate will dictate exactly how much irrigation is needed {{with high levels of}} evapotranspiration more commonly occurring in Mediterranean climates that have low levels of humidity such as part of Chile and the Cape Province of South Africa. In these low humidity regions, primary irrigation may be needed, but in many Mediterranean climates the irrigation is usually supplemental. The amount of precipitation that occurs during spring and summer months is also important. For example, Tuscany receives an average of 8inches (200mm) of rainfall during the months of April through June - the period that includes flowering and fruit set, when the water is most crucial. While fluctuations in rainfall do occur, the amount of natural precipitation, combined with water holding capacity of soil, is typically sufficient to result in healthy harvest. In contrast, Napa Valley only gets 2.4inches (60mm), on average, during the same period of time, often in an erratic pattern (some years seeing more, some years seeing only trace amounts of rain), and most appellations in Central and Southern California (both along the coast and inland) receive even less than that, necessitating supplemental irrigation.|$|E
500|$|Free market {{pressures}} {{exposed the}} U.S. steel industry's own internal problems, {{which included a}} now-outdated manufacturing base that had been over-expanded in the 1950s and 1960s, hostile management and labor relationships, the inflexibility of United Steelworkers regarding wage cuts and work-rule reforms, oligarchic management styles, and poor strategic planning by both unions and management. In particular, Pittsburgh faced <b>its</b> <b>own</b> <b>challenges.</b> Local coke and iron ore deposits were depleted, raising material costs. The large mills in the Pittsburgh region also faced competition from newer, more profitable [...] "mini-mills" [...] and non-union mills with lower labor costs.|$|E
50|$|Early {{comparative}} {{and human}} studies examined {{the fossil record}} to measure features like cranial sizes and capacities so as to infer brain size, growth rate, total growth and potential implications for energy expenditure.

500|$|Reviewers {{considered}} the factions balanced. Eurogamer's Kieron Gillen {{commented that the}} Covenant was harder to master, especially because the campaign served as a tutorial for the UNSC, but no similar introduction was available for the Covenant. However, he said the two sides were [...] "authentically different", and each offered <b>its</b> <b>own</b> <b>challenges</b> to players. Some critics, such as Nick Cowen of The Daily Telegraph, wished that the Flood was a playable faction; in contrast, Ryan Geddes of IGN disliked the Flood and appreciated their exclusion. Will Porter of IGN UK enjoyed the rock-paper-scissors RTS mechanics, but said that [...] "since the game is singularly crap at indicating which units are rocks and which scissors," [...] players had to learn which units were best via trial and error, an issue that was more prevalent with the Covenant.|$|E
