40|$|Amounts of <b>extraneous</b> <b>water</b> {{are a part}} of {{dry weather}} {{discharge}} and are therefore impossible to be measured directly. <b>Extraneous</b> <b>water</b> includes undesirable water that flows into the sewers through different routes and leads to the dilution of wastewater. In origin, they are only slightly contaminated and require no additional cleaning. The most common cause for the increased amount of <b>extraneous</b> <b>water</b> is not only infiltration of underground water into leaking sewers, but also wrong connections and intrusion of stormwater through openings in control shafts. The area included in the frame of our analysis concerns an industrial zone that consists entirely of a separate sewer system. Precondition for a separate system operation is a strict separation of dry and stormwater from the place of their origin and the place of their sale. These wrong connections cause massive amounts of <b>extraneous</b> <b>water,</b> wastewater treatment plant overload and unacceptable watercourse contamination. These are the main reasons why we wanted to find out whether we have an excess of <b>extraneous</b> <b>water</b> on the selected area or not. We also wanted {{to find out what the}} actual specific rates of <b>extraneous</b> <b>water</b> are in comparison with German guidelines ATV that represent <b>extraneous</b> <b>water</b> as an expensive problem that has to be dealt by all managers and users of sewer systems and wastewater treatment plants...|$|E

Preventing and reducing the possibility of intrusion of <b>extraneous</b> <b>water</b> into the sewage system {{is an important factor in}} reducing operating costs of wastewater treatment plants. In the theoretical part of the thesis, at the beginning, Slovenian and European legislation relating to the collection and treatment of wastewater is presented. Next there is some theory about water protection areas. More information is given on collection and treatment of urban waste water and <b>extraneous</b> <b>water.</b> The final part of the theoretical part describes municipality of Tišina and wastewater treatment plants in Murski Črnci and Petanjci. In the practical part of the thesis, we calculated the proportion of <b>extraneous</b> <b>water</b> for each pumping station according to the data of the electricity consumed. From the data about sold water quantities it is clear, that the amount of water sold in Tišina is very small compared with the flow at the wastewater treatment plants, so we tried to determine which pumping stations have largest share of intrusion of <b>extraneous</b> <b>water</b> into the sewage system. Because there are 39 pumping stations that pump water towards the wastewater treatment plants, intrusion of <b>extraneous</b> <b>water</b> into the sewage system presents a huge financial burden for the municipality. For pumping stations where we calculated large shares of extraneous waters, we tried to anticipate the causes of the intrusion of <b>extraneous</b> <b>water.</b> In conclusion, the thesis presents possible solutions and measures by which it is possible to identify and reduce the intrusion of <b>extraneous</b> <b>water</b> in the sewage system...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{describes}} a new steady permeation method for measuring water transport properties of fuel cell membranes. It is distinguished from most previous experiments {{of this type}} by employing a separate procedure for quantifying the <b>extraneous</b> sources of <b>water</b> transport resistance in the measurement cell that do not originate in the membrane (the so-called device resistance). This result is then {{used to determine the}} membrane water permeability in cells built with Nafion membranes in three thicknesses (25, 50, and 125 microns) operating at three different temperatures (70, 90 and 110 ◦C) over a range of relative humidities from 30 – 90 %. The permeability data lie along three parallel straight lines (one for each temperature) on semi-log plots vs. average membrane relative humidity. There is no discernible dependence of permeability on membrane thickness, suggesting that any localized transport resistance that may exist at the membrane surface was too small to be detected by this method. The permeability data can be fit to a simple 3 -constant empirical expression for the membrane permeability as a function of temperature and relative humidity. The largest difference between the present and previous measurements occurs at higher relative humidities, where the device resistance is large compared with the membrane resistance...|$|R

40|$|M. Sc. Gold mining {{activities}} are {{widespread in the}} Witwatersrand area of South Africa. These have significant influences, both positive and negative, on the socio-economic and bio-physical environments. In the case of South Africa’s river systems and riparian zones, mining and its associated activities have negatively impacted upon these systems. The Blesbokspruit Catchment Area and Grootvlei Mines Limited (hereafter called “Grootvlei”) are located in Gauteng Province of South Africa. The chosen study area is east {{of the town of}} Springs in the Ekurhuleni Metropolitan Municipality on the East Rand of Gauteng Province. Grootvlei, which has been operating underground {{mining activities}} since 1934, {{is one of the last}} operational mines in this area. Grootvlei pumps <b>extraneous</b> <b>water</b> from its underground mine workings into the Blesbokspruit, which includes the Blesbokspruit Ramsar site. This pumping ensures that the mine workings are not flooded, which would result in the gold reserves becoming inaccessible and would shortly lead to the closure of Grootvlei. This closure would further affect at least three other marginal gold mines in the area, namely, Springs-Dagga, Droogebult-Wits and Nigel Gold Mine, all which rely on Grootvlei’s pumping to keep their workings dry. Being shallower than Grootvlei, they are currently able to operate without themselves having to pump any <b>extraneous</b> <b>water</b> from their underground workings. A cessation of pumping would also cause flooding of the lower workings of the neighbouring Consolidated Modderfontein Mine. If pumping does not take place the water will eventually percolate to the surface, initially in the Nigel area and eventually throughout the entir e Far East Rand, which would lead to substantial economic losses. This study was undertaken to establish whether Grootvlei’s pumping activities of <b>extraneous</b> <b>water</b> from underground mine workings into the Blesbokspruit has had, and is still having, an impact on the water quality of the Blesbokspruit and, if so, how this impact can be minimized or eliminated. Water quality of the Blesbokspruit was analysed and trends in four selected variables, i. e. pH, Electric Conductivity, magnesium and sulphate content, are discussed in this report. These variables were analysed in relation to three categories, namely the sample point position, seasonal influences and four periods of pumping operations. The sample position immediately downstream of the discharge point of Grootvlei, where the <b>extraneous</b> <b>water</b> from their underground mine workings is pumped into the Blesbokspruit, as well as the samples collected in the dry seasons, recorded the poorest overall water quality values in The Impact of Grootvlei Mine on the Water Quality of the Blesbokspruit ii all four variables. Although the sample position and seasonal changes influenced the water quality of the Blesbokspruit, it was found that the periods of pumping had the most significant influence on the water quality, with a decrease in water quality after the huge increase in pumping volumes, which commenced in October 1995. It was also established that the Blesbokspruit wetland does not have the capacity to purify the water in the Blesbokspruit in order to maintain similar water quality conditions found upstream from the mine. This could be due to the wetland already having too many contaminants in it. The analysis concludes that the pumping of <b>extraneous</b> <b>water</b> from underground mine workings into the Blesbokspruit has had and is still having, although to a lesser degree, a major influence on the deterioration of water quality of the Blesbokspruit. The strategic management plan of Grootvlei, as well as the feasibility study to establish the best -suited scenario for reducing water ingress into the underground mine workings were discussed. In addition, the following recommendations were made in order to assist Grootvlei in improving the water quality of the Blesbokspruit: Strict compliance with environmental law regarding the requirements set out in the water extraction licence of Grootvlei. Grootvlei should adhere to its statements and undertakings to improve the water quality pumped into the Blesbokspruit. Grootvlei should expand on its increased environmental awareness by ensuring that communication channels are open between Grootvlei and the community. This is essential to ensure that Grootvlei is made aware of issues and concerns of the community and that the community is aware that their issues and concerns have been heard, understood and acted upon by Grootvlei. Grootvlei should become actively involved in the activities and decisions of the Blesbokspruit Catchment Forum, and should be a permanent member thereof. The use of Phytoremediation, trees and riparian zones could be implemented as an alternative to, or in conjunction with current practices to improve the water quality of the water before it is pumped into the Blesbokspruit by Grootvlei. Phytoremediation can also be used in order to reduce the amount of water ingress into underground workings, by establishing vegetation, such as trees, to absorb and evapotranspirate water at areas where ingress occurs. Procedures in the reduction of the surface water ingress to the underground mine workings should also be implemented. Monitoring the water quality pumped into the Blesbokspruit, as well as monitoring the amount of water ingress into the underground mine workings must be continued. A study for the restoration of the Blesbokspruit wetland needs to be implemented urgently...|$|E
40|$|This {{communication}} {{is dealing with}} separate sewer overflows from pumping stations. It relies on the processing of data recorded during 3 years on 42 pumping in the urban community of Nantes (France). These data enable to {{make the difference between}} overflows caused by infiltration/inflow, and overflows caused by pump failures, as well as pointing out differences in the behaviour of different pumping stations in different hydrological years. Infiltration seems to have an effect on overflows, at least as an increasing factor during winter period. Two kinds of action are possible for controlling overflows caused by of <b>extraneous</b> <b>water</b> : 1) fixing misconnections of runoff water from house laterals and 2) sealing leaky sewers. A methodology is proposed for evaluating the efficiency of these two actions. It is based on a two-step elimination of infiltration and inflow on experimental catchments, together with a proper modelling of the different components of the flow conveyed by the sewer systems...|$|E
40|$|In {{the dairy}} industry, raw milk samples {{collected}} for quality testing {{should be tested}} or refrigerated immediately to control bacterial growth. A thermistor cryoscope is used to accurately determine the freezing point depression (FPD) of raw milk. Milk containing <b>extraneous</b> amounts of <b>water</b> will have a grossly elevated FPD. Milk that has been spoiled or adulterated with other sources, such as sugar, salt, or milk powder, will depress the freezing point, potentially masking the addition of added water. The pH of milk is a general measure of acidity in the sample. Lower pH values indicate an acidification process such as bacterial spoilage. Impedance methods monitor changes in the metabolic processes and will measure lactic acid as a by-product of lactose, for example. The {{purpose of this study}} was to show the effects that storage conditions have on FPD, pH, and impedance of raw milk. In two identical experiments, 20 raw milk samples were stored at 20 - 25 °C, and 20 at 2 - 8 °C, for 168 hours. All samples were tested at numerous intervals throughout this time period. Spoiled and unspoiled milk samples generated similar results using all 3 methods up to 24 hours of storage. Between 24 and 48 hours, the FPD of the spoiled milk was erroneously depressed by an average of 102. 4 m°C, the pH was lowered by an average of 1. 19 units, and the impedance measurement dropped by an average of 19. 1 ohms. The FPD, pH, and impedance data collected generally indicate that raw milk samples with or without refrigeration can be tested up to 24 hours without showing an appreciable shift in response due to bacterial spoilage...|$|R

The study is about assessment of the extent of <b>extraneous</b> <b>water</b> that infiltrates into sewer pipes in the sewerage system and the appropriateness of the design criteria, under local conditions. The study is divided into two parts, flow characteristics measurement and infiltration measurement. Flow characteristics measurement includes collecting data using flowmeter at a pre-determined manhole and analyzing the data to find hourly flow characteristics, flow per capita contribution and the peak flow factor. Infiltration measurement is carried out at an abandoned sewer line (MH 74 -MH 74 a) in Taman Sri Pulai for a year, at active sewer line in Taman Universiti and at Hydraulic & Hydrology Laboratory, Faculty of Civil Engineering, UTM. The data collected is converted into graph form before analysis. Rainfall data has been collected to identify its influence on the infiltration rate. The results from both flow characteristics measurement and infiltration measurement are compared with design infiltration rate as mentioned in MS 1228 : 1991, which is 50 liter/day/km/mm-dia as well as with previous studies on inflow and infiltration carried out in Taman Sri Pulai and Taman Universiti. The results showed that the flow per capita contribution and the peak flow factor in Taman Sri Pulai and Taman Universiti are lower than recommended in MS 1228 : 1991 and that wet periods contribute more infiltration compared to dry periods.

Although the biology of the Gomantong system has been repeatedly studied, very {{little attention has been}} given to the geomorphology. Here, we report on the impact of geobiological modification {{in the development of the}} modern aspect of the cave, an important but little recognized feature of tropical caves. Basic modeling of the metabolic outputs from bats and birds (CO 2, H 2 O, heat) reveals that post-speleogenetic biogenic corrosion can erode bedrock by between ~ 3. 0 mm/ka (1 m/~ 300 ka) and ~ 4. 6 mm/ka (1 m/~ 200 ka). Modeling at high densities of bats yields rates of corrosion of ~ 34 mm/ka (or 1 m/~ 30 ka). Sub-aerial corrosion creates a previously undescribed speleological feature, the apse-flute, which is semicircular in cross-section and ~ 80 cm wide. It is vertical regardless of rock properties, developing in parallel but apparently completely independently, and often unbroken from roof to floor. They end at a blind hemi-spherical top with no <b>extraneous</b> <b>water</b> source. Half-dome ceiling conch pockets are remnants of previous apse-fluting. Sub-cutaneous corrosion creates the floor-level guano notch formed by organic acid dissolution of bedrock in contact with guano. Speleogenetic assessment suggests that as much as 70 – 95 % of the total volume of the modern cave may have been opened by direct subaerial biogenic dissolution and biogenically-induced collapse, and by sub-cutaneous removal of limestone, over a timescale of 1 – 2 Ma...|$|E

40|$|A {{suite of}} {{interacting}} processes and mechanisms enables tolerance of desiccation and storage (conservation) of orthodox {{seeds in the}} dry state. While this is a long-term option under optimised conditions, dry orthodox seeds are not immortal, with life spans having been characterised as short, intermediate and long. Factors facilitating desiccation tolerance are metabolic ‘switch-off’ and intracellular dedifferentiation. Recalcitrant seeds lack these mechanisms, contributing significantly to their desiccation sensitivity. Consequently, recalcitrant seeds, which are shed at high water contents, can be stored only in the short-term, under conditions not allowing dehydration. The periods of such hydrated storage are constrained by germination that occurs {{without the need for}} <b>extraneous</b> <b>water,</b> and the proliferation of seed-associated fungi. Cryopreservation is viewed as the only option for long-term conservation of the germplasm of recalcitrant-seeded species. This is not easily achieved, as each of the necessary procedures imposes oxidative damage. Intact recalcitrant seeds cannot be cryopreserved, the common practice being to use excised embryos or embryonic axes as explants. Dehydration is a necessary procedure prior to exposure to cryogenic temperatures, but this is associated with metabolism-linked injury mediated by uncontrolled ROS generation and failing anti-oxidant systems. While the extent to which this occurs can be curtailed by maximising drying rate (flash drying) it cannot be completely obviated. Explant cooling for, and rewarming after, cryostorage must necessarily be rapid, to avoid ice crystallisation. The ramifications of desiccation sensitivity are discussed, as are problems involved in cryostorage, particularly those accompanying dehydration and damage consequent upon ice crystallisation. While desiccation sensitivity is a ‘fact’ of seed recalcitrance, resolutions of the difficulties involved germplasm conservation are possible as discussed...|$|E

The <b>extraneous</b> <b>water</b> that enters the sewer pipe system through leakage or improper connections will affect the flow rate and flow capacity of wastewater in the sewer pipe. This thesis deals with the inflow and infiltration that is occurring in the current sewerage system and the appropriateness of the sewer pipes design criteria through collection of data from field runs in three different residential areas which are Taman Lepar Hilir Saujana, Bandar Putra and Kota Sas. Besides that, this research also studies the effects of rainfall on inflow and infiltration in the sewerage system, which was found to be large. The data used in this research was obtained by using two area velocity flow-meters to measure the flow rate in the sewers as well as a rain gauge to collect the rainfall data at every location with an average duration of a month per location. This research was done on selected sewer lines connecting two manholes with no lateral branches in between each location. The data obtained was converted into graph form. Thus, inflow and infiltration of the sewerage system and its relationship with rainfall can be clearly seen. The results of inflow and infiltration are compared with the design infiltration rate prescribed in MS 1228 : 1991 and Hammer & Hammer. The highest infiltration rate obtained at Taman Lepar Hilir Saujana (7756. 36 liter/day/km/mm-dia); Bandar Putra (9213. 53 liter/day/km/mm-dia) are much higher than the design limits mentioned in MS 1228 : 1991 (50 liter/day/km/mm-dia) and Hammer & Hammer (46 liter/day/km/mm-dia).

Inflow and Infiltration (I/I) is <b>extraneous</b> <b>water</b> that {{enters a}} sewage {{treatment}} plant via groundwater infiltration or direct stormwater entry into sewers. This study {{is an attempt to}} quantify I/I impacts based on an assessment of influent and effluent data from twenty-four wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) in Georgia with design capacities of 37, 850 m 3 /d (10 -mgd) or greater. Twelve months of operating data from the 2003 calendar year were evaluated. The objectives of the study were to determine the effect of rainfall intensity on the volumetric flow rate to each WWTP; and the relationship between flow rate and the influent biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) and influent Total Suspended Solids (TSS) concentrations. Moderate to strong correlations were observed between rainfall intensity and volumetric flow rate; and volumetric flow rate and influent BOD and TSS concentrations. Weak correlations were observed for some of the relationships when applied to the complete data set; however, stronger correlations were achieved by performing statistical analyses of variance and pooling subsets of the data. Peaking factors were similar to those reported in the literature. Sponsored and Organized by: U. S.
