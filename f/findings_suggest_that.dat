5|$|In {{those who}} are {{otherwise}} healthy, {{there is little evidence}} that supplements have any benefits with respect to cancer or heart disease. Vitamin A and E supplements not only provide no health benefits for generally healthy individuals, but they may increase mortality, though the two large studies that support this conclusion included smokers for whom it was already known that beta-carotene supplements can be harmful. While other <b>findings</b> <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> vitamin E toxicity is limited to only a specific form when taken in excess.|$|E
5|$|No {{mention of}} Osorkon IV is known after 716 BC. Some archaeological <b>findings</b> <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> shortly after this date, Bocchoris (Bakenrenef) of the 24th Dynasty may have {{expanded}} his realm eastward, supplanting Osorkon at Tanis. In 712 BC, Piye's successor Shebitku marched northward and defeated Bocchoris. When {{around the same}} year King Iamani of Ashdod sought refuge from Sargon II in Egypt, Shebitku {{was in fact the}} sole ruler of Egypt, and returned Iamani to the Assyrians in chains. In any case, Osorkon IV was seemingly dead before that year.|$|E
5|$|Robinson's Arch is {{the name}} given to a monumental {{staircase}} carried by an unusually wide stone arch, which once stood at the southwestern corner of the Temple Mount. It was built {{as part of the}} expansion of the Second Temple initiated by Herod the Great {{at the end of the}} 1st century BCE. Recent <b>findings</b> <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> it may not have been completed until at least 20 years after his death. The massive stone span was constructed along with the retaining walls of the Temple Mount. It carried traffic up from ancient Jerusalem's Lower Market area and over the Tyropoeon street to the Royal Stoa complex on the esplanade of the Mount. The overpass was destroyed during the Great Jewish Revolt, only a few decades after its completion.|$|E

25|$|Psychological {{research}} {{has looked at}} the tinnitus distress reaction (TDR) to account for differences in tinnitus severity. These <b>findings</b> <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> at the initial perception of tinnitus, conditioning links tinnitus with negative emotions, such as fear and anxiety from unpleasant stimuli at the time. This enhances activity in the limbic system and autonomic nervous system, thus increasing tinnitus awareness and annoyance.|$|E
25|$|Additional {{research}} suggests the social component of ritual. For instance, <b>findings</b> <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> ritual performance indicates group commitment and prevents the uncommitted from gaining membership benefits. Ritual may aid in emphasizing moral values {{that serve as}} group norms and regulate societies. It may also strengthen commitment to moral convictions and likelihood of upholding these social expectations. Thus, performance of rituals may foster social group stability.|$|E
25|$|Metabolites of {{ketamine}} including dehydronorketamine, hydroxynorketamine, and norketamine {{have been}} found to act as negative allosteric modulators of the α7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor in the KXa7R1 cell line (HEK293 cells transfected with rat nicotinic acetylcholine receptor genes) with subanesthetic and nanomolar potencies (e.g., IC50 = 55nM for dehydronorketamine), whereas ketamine itself was inactive at the same concentrations (< 1nbsp&µM). These <b>findings</b> <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> metabolites may contribute importantly to the pharmacodynamics of ketamine.|$|E
40|$|The {{relationships}} between coping strategies, goal adjustment and {{positive and negative}} affect were studied in 83 definitive involuntary childless people. Self-report questionnaires were filled out. The <b>findings</b> <b>suggested</b> <b>that</b> positive ways to handle the childlessness were related to positive affect, while negative {{ways to deal with}} the childlessness were related to negative affect. Cognitive coping strategies seemed to have a stronger influence on affect than the behavioral coping strategies. Adjusting the goal to have children seemed to be a fruitful way to cope. These <b>findings</b> <b>suggested</b> <b>that</b> intervention programs should pay attention to both cognitive coping strategies and goal adjustmen...|$|R

25|$|Researchers have {{hypothesized}} {{a number}} of factors that could be responsible for these differences between countries, including national differences in overall income levels, self-serving biases and self-enhancement, and approach and avoidance orientations. Taken together, these <b>findings</b> <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> while extraversion-introversion does have a strong correlation with happiness, it does not stand alone as a sole predictor of subjective well-being, and that other factors must be accounted for when trying to determine the correlates of happiness.|$|E
25|$|In a 2011 {{meta-analysis}} of seven randomized trials that compared a peer support intervention to group cognitive-behavioral therapy in patients suffering from depression, peer support interventions {{were found to}} improve depression symptoms more than usual care alone and results may be {{comparable to those of}} group cognitive behavioral therapy. These <b>findings</b> <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> peer support interventions have the potential to be effective components of depression care, and they support the inclusion of peer support in recovery-oriented mental health treatment.|$|E
25|$|A cyberpsychology {{research}} {{study conducted by}} Australian researchers demonstrated {{that a number of}} positive psychological outcomes are related to Facebook use. These researchers established that people can derive a sense of social connectedness and belongingness in the online environment. Importantly, this online social connectedness was associated with lower levels of depression and anxiety, and greater levels of subjective well-being. These <b>findings</b> <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> the nature of online social networking determines the outcomes of online social network use.|$|E
