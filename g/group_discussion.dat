40|$|Focus <b>group</b> <b>discussions</b> and {{in-depth}} interviews with participants have been {{commonly used in}} community settings in remote or rural areas. In large-scale community projects, these tools of research help to understand health issues such as smoking, mental health conditions like depression and anxiety, dengue control, nutrition regulation, sexual health, Parkinson’s disease, childhood obesity, and cancer. Though {{there is evidence that}} focus <b>group</b> <b>discussions</b> and {{in-depth interviews}} have been extensively used with much success in medical research, their application in the field of community physiotherapy is seldom studied (Sim and Snell, 1996). In a recent study on stroke survivors in Zambia (Mapulanga et al, 2014), 50 households in the Livingstone district were included in focus <b>group</b> <b>discussions</b> to understand the socio-economic burden of the disease at the individual, family and community levels. The analyses of the data collected from these discussions helped to highlight the burden created by the disease at different levels. A review paper by Smith et al (2009) suggested the novel method of using telephone-based <b>group</b> <b>discussions</b> in physiotherapy. The authors emphasised the benefits of this method in terms of greater coverage area, increased participation and handling of sensitive issues. In another study that used focus <b>group</b> <b>discussions,</b> in-depth interviews and participant observations in a semi-urban hospital in Kenya (Gona et al, 2013), the need for cost-effective community physiotherapy for management of chronic aches and pains in low-resource settings was realised. In India, a series of focus <b>group</b> <b>discussions</b> were conducted with slum women and children by Rajan and Koti (2013). These discussions helped to understand the prevalent musculoskeletal health issues in this cohort; thereafter, community physiotherapy was recommended for these problems.

25|$|Pre-session Strategy {{refers to}} the leader’s ability to {{understand}} the importance of small talk just prior to <b>group</b> <b>discussion.</b> The facilitator must cordially greet the group members and begin small talk {{while at the same time}} avoid the topics and issues that will be discussed during the sessions. This will allow the group leader to observe the kind of interactions and understand which participant has what qualities. Recording is beneficial for the leader via tape recording and note taking. Note taking is useful as they can be utilized even if the tape recorder stops working. Someone other than the group leader or the facilitator should take detailed and in depth notes of the discussion. Beginning of the Discussion includes the usual pattern of discussion which is welcome, overview and topic, ground rules and first question. The overview must provide an explanation of the purpose and importance of the topic of discussion. Ground rules must be stated explicitly. Some of the examples are, minimizing or eliminating side conversations, one person talks at a time, no criticizing what others have to say and treating everyone’s opinion with respect and dignity. The initial conversation should include an “ice breaker” in order to make the members more comfortable and open.|$|E

It also included a more adult-oriented staff meeting amongst the toys rather than a juvenile <b>group</b> <b>discussion</b> that had existed in earlier drafts. Buzz Lightyear's character was also changed slightly [...] "to make it more clear to the audience that he really doesn't realize he's a toy." [...] Katzenberg and Schneider approved the new approach, and by February 1994 the film was back in production. The voice actors returned in March 1994 to record their new lines. When production was greenlit, the crew quickly grew from its original size of 24 to 110, including 27 animators, 22 technical directors, and 61 other artists and engineers. In comparison, The Lion King, released in 1994, required a budget of $45million and a staff of 800. In the early budgeting process, Jobs was eager to produce the film as efficiently as possible, impressing Katzenberg with his focus on cost-cutting. Despite this, the $17million production budget was proving inadequate, especially given the major revision that was necessary after Katzenberg had pushed them to make Woody too edgy. Jobs demanded more funds to complete the film right and insisted that Disney was liable for the cost overruns. Katzenberg was not willing, and Ed Catmull was able to reach a compromise.|$|E

2500|$|One of {{the main}} {{purposes}} of focus <b>group</b> <b>discussion</b> is to get light into the respondents’ phenomenological world of experience, thinking, perceiving and feeling. These experiences, feelings, attitudes might be independent of a group or its cultural and social settings but {{are more likely to}} reveal itself in the interaction with other people in a group or another social setting. Focus group discussions help in elaborating the different viewpoints and emotional processes of each member within a group context. The individual interview is simpler for the researcher to control in comparison to a focus <b>group</b> <b>discussion.</b> A focus <b>group</b> <b>discussion,</b> in comparison to other methods helps the research to gain larger pool information in a much lesser amount of time. This observation depends on waiting for things to happen, whereas the researcher has to follow an interview guide in a focus group. In this aspect, focus group discussions are not natural but organized and planned. These discussions are especially helpful when there are differences related to power between its members, decision-makers or professionals, [...] when the culture and language of a specific group is of, and when the researcher or a member wants to understand and explore the level of consensus over a given theme or topic(Kreuger, 1993).|$|E

2500|$|Focus <b>group</b> <b>discussion</b> in {{qualitative}} {{method has}} gain huge popularity {{of this method}} across the social sciences over the past decade. Focus groups are now thoroughly assessable and familiar to the general public. Prior 1920’s and late 1970’s the focus groups were mainly used in marketing, tool, and studies {{in the field in}} the business. Aspects like including education, communication, media studies, feminist research, sociology and social psychology. Focused groups are also known as ‘group interviews’. The members are encouraged to interact and have discussions. The data collected by focused <b>group</b> <b>discussion</b> are seldom produced through interview and observation; it enlightens us with its power of knowledge. Focus <b>group</b> <b>discussion</b> also focuses on the process beyond the individual’s memory and desires. The richness and complexity of group dynamics should be considered. Focus group can also access to social interactional dynamics that produce particular memories, ideologies, and practices among the group members. It themselves becomes relevant, termed as units of analysis of our study. Questions, issues and topics process focus group. Through different dynamics multiple angles of vision {{can be seen in the}} new world in unexpected ways. Focus group helps us move towards constructing a ‘methodology of getting lost” and toward enacting “double practices” (lather, 2001). This seems a necessary step towards conducting qualitative research. Keeping norms and rules of groups in mind the researcher and research participants realize that interpretation of individual are situated, provisional, contingent, unstable thus it’s unchangeable. It is necessary for the researcher to have self-reflectivity that involves making the research transparent rhetorical and poetic work of the researcher in representing the object of the study. It is theoretically important to construct a mutual ground between the researcher and the research participants. The second sense of self-reflexivity is important to encourage refection on interpretive research as the dual practice of knowledge gathering and self transformation is done through self-reflection and mutual reflection. Allowing ourselves to dwell in the existing inevitable indeterminacies, we are leading ourselves in the best way of the qualitative research practice.|$|E
