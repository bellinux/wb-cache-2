40|$|Medicine {{education}} {{as part of}} health education aims to educate about rational medicine use: the right medicine taken {{in the right way}} at the right time for the right problem. <b>Storage</b> <b>places</b> of medicines are one issue discussed in medicine education. This participative observation research of Finnish households’ (n = 10) medicine <b>storage</b> <b>places</b> was conducted together with interviews of 12 mothers and 12 children concerning medicine consumption habits. Data were analysed using directed content analysis. In all interviewed households (n = 12), children and mothers confirmed the same <b>storage</b> <b>places</b> for the medicines. None of the households locked the medicine <b>storage</b> <b>places</b> even if the cabinets had a lock and key. The number of medicine types varied widely among the studied households (n= 10), from 8 to 33. The number of expired medicines ranged from 1 to 10 pieces per household. At home medicines are discussed consciously when the child, family member, relative or a friend has a long-term illness, when being sick and while taking medication. Mothers identified themselves as being responsible for the medicine cabinet at home. Mothers were categorised into four groups − home nurses (2), forgetful (2), reckless (2) and health conscious (4) − based on their medicine consumption and storage practices. Some of these practices do not demonstrate the appropriate use and storage of medicines. Based on the findings, we recommend that educational material should be developed on medicine storage and use...|$|R
40|$|DCSP (Distributed Constraint Satisfaction Problem) {{has been}} a very {{important}} research area in AI (Artificial Intelligence). There are many application problems in distributed AI that can be formalized as DSCPs. With the increasing complexity and problem size of the application problems in AI, the required <b>storage</b> <b>place</b> in searching and the average searching time are increasing too. Thus, to use a limited <b>storage</b> <b>place</b> efficiently in solving DCSP becomes a very important problem, and it can help to reduce searching time as well. This paper provides an efficient knowledge base management approach based on general usage of hyper-resolution-rule in consistence algorithm. The approach minimizes the increasing of the knowledge base by eliminate sufficient constraint and false nogood. These eliminations do not change the completeness of the original knowledge base increased. The proofs are given as well. The example shows that this approach decrease both the new nogoods generated and the knowledge base greatly. Thus it decreases the required <b>storage</b> <b>place</b> and simplify the searching process. Comment: 11 page...|$|R

40|$|The {{effects of}} the <b>storage</b> <b>place,</b> <b>placing</b> manner, and <b>storage</b> time on {{mechanical}} properties of briquettes made from birch chips were laboratorily tested. A unique methodology developed by the present author enabling a relatively easy assessment of mechanical properties of the briquettes is described. The briquettes properties were evaluated by their density and rupture force determination. From the test results it follows that if the briquettes are stored in a well closed plastic bag, neither the <b>place</b> nor the <b>storage</b> time influence significantly their life time. When stored in a net plastic bag, the briquettes get seriously damaged, namely depending on their <b>storage</b> <b>place</b> and <b>storage</b> time...|$|R
