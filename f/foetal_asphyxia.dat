40|$|Background: The {{purpose of}} this study was to find out the affect of {{maternal}} asphyxia influencing the foetus by comparison of the maternal arterial blood gas (ABGs) and acid base levels of normal full term females with the ABGs and acid base values of term females showing any subjective signs of <b>foetal</b> <b>asphyxia</b> during intrapartum period. Methods: In this case control study maternal ABGs and acid base levels of 40 normal term pregnant ladies were compared with 40 other term pregnant females with subjective signs of <b>foetal</b> <b>asphyxia</b> (i. e., foetal heart rate> 160 bpm or < 120 bpm, meconium staining liquor during intrapartum period or Apgar score < 5 at one minute after delivery to confirm the foetal distress. Lactic acid and pH were also estimated to assess the acid base balance. Result: There was considerable difference of lactic acid (LA) and Pco 2 levels which were significantly increased (p< 0. 025) in asphyxiated mothers (AM) as compared with control mothers (CM). No significant difference was observed regarding pH values, bicarbonate ions (HCO 3 -), base excess (BE), carbon dioxide content (CO 2 ct) and percentage saturation of oxygen (%O 2 SAT) levels in both CM and AM groups. The levels of haemoglobin (Hb), packed cell volume (PCV), partial pressure of oxygen (PO 2) and oxygen content (O 2 ct) in AM group were found significantly lower (p< 0. 0001) as compared t...|$|E
40|$|Doctor of PhilosophyPup {{mortality}} {{is reported to}} be a significant problem in the dog. The purpose of this thesis was to identify the extent and causes of the mortality and the risk factors. Mortality was classified according to the clinical condition of the pup at birth and the pathological investigation was designed to investigate the validity of this classification. Total pup mortality, excluding elective euthanasia for show reasons, was 18. 5 %. Perinatal mortality, that is, stillbirths and deaths that occurred in the first week, accounted for 90. 9 % of these losses. Each breed surveyed exhibited a specific mortality pattern and the results of one breed could not be used to anticipate the outcome in another breed. As a consequence of this, there was a marked difference in the predictor variables, or risk factors, identified for each breed. Birth weight and inter-pup whelping intervals were the most consistent variables that increased the odds of a pup dying. The principal cause of pup mortality was attributed to <b>foetal</b> <b>asphyxia,</b> that is, apparently normal pups subjected to excessive hypoxia during the birth process and they were either still born or born in a distressed condition and subsequently died. Death attributed to <b>foetal</b> <b>asphyxia</b> accounted for 7. 8 % of all pups born and 42. 5 % of the total mortality. The majority of these pups (82. 2 %) died during whelping or in the first 24 hours after birth. The death of just over half of these pups could be directly attributed to dystocia. The remaining pups were compromised during {{what appeared to be a}} normal whelping. Neonatal atelectasis, pulmonary congestion, inhalation of amniotic fluid and meconium, leptomeningeal and generalised systemic congestion were the principal pathological findings in these pups. Average birth weights, inter-pup whelping intervals, parity, pup presentation and litter position were all significant predictors of mortality due to <b>foetal</b> <b>asphyxia.</b> The abnormal pup was defined as a pup at birth that was mummified, had died prior to birth, was small for date or had gross congenital defects present. These accounted for the death of 4. 9 % of all pups born and 26. 3 % of all losses. The only significant predictors of mortality due to the birth of an abnormal pup were the inter-pup interval and birth weight. Since the abnormality occurred in utero and was not related to the birth process this result had no bearing on the outcome. The death of live born, apparently normal pups, in the neonatal period accounted for 5. 7 % of all pups born and 31. 2 % of the total mortality. Over half these losses were attributed to fading puppy syndrome. The remainder were due to mismothering / mismanagement and other miscellaneous causes. The majority of fading pups examined were not normal at birth. Growth retardation and the consequent increased susceptibility to foetal hypoxia, lung pathology indicative of <b>foetal</b> <b>asphyxia</b> and intrauterine and/or very early neonatal infections were the principal causes of mortality attributed to fading puppy syndrome identified in this study. The canine perinate is totally dependent on the bitch both in the uterus and in the immediate post partum period. The investigation of pup mortality can not be divorced from the assessment of maternal health, the influence of the whelping process and the post whelping care of the immature pups by the bitch. These factors must be correlated with gross and histological changes identified in dead pups to determine the sequence of events that contributed to the death of the whelp...|$|E
40|$|The {{details of}} the {{deliveries}} of 10 infants whose cords were clamped {{before the onset of}} respiration and within one minute of delivery of the chin but whose residual placental volumes were unexpectedly low are compared with 20 control infants whose cords were clamped under similar conditions but who had the expected residual placental volumes. The only statistically significant difference between these groups was in the high number of patients with foetal distress and low Apgar scores in the former group. It is concluded that placental transfusion occurred before delivery in these patients and that <b>foetal</b> <b>asphyxia</b> facilitated this transfusion, which may be the underlying mechanism of neonatal erythrocythaemia or transient tachypnoea of the newborn...|$|E

The aims of this study were to establish a clinical cut-off point for LBW and to determine its incidence, predictors and complications in a sub-urban areaâ€™s hospital of Cameroon. Methods: We conducted a study in two phases: a 6 -year retrospective phase during which we collected demographic and clinical information from the records of the maternity of the Buea Regional Hospital (BRH) and a 3 -month prospective phase during which data were collected from consenting pregnant women using a structured questionnaire, and newborns were examined and followed after birth. Results: A total of 4941 records were reviewed during the retrospective phase and the 10 th centile of birth weights was 2600 g. In the 200 pregnant women enrolled during the prospective phase, using this cut-off yielded an incidence of LBW of 19. 0 %. Independent predictors of LBW were preterm delivery, hypertensive disorders in pregnancy, HIV infection, maternal age> 36 years, maternal height < 150 cm and pre-delivery BMI < 25 kg/m 2. Neonates with LBW {{were more likely to have}} neonatal <b>asphyxia,</b> <b>foetal</b> distress, respiratory distress and neonatal death. Conclusions: Our results suggest that newborns under 2600 g have LBW in sub-urban Cameroon. They represent one out of every five babies, and they deserve close care. Preventive measures targeting the predictors described here are warranted to reduce the incidence and complications. Similar studies in urban areas are required in order to generalize the results...|$|R
40|$|For {{many years}} {{intermittent}} {{recording of the}} foetal heart rate with a stethoscope and the detec-tion of meconium in the liquor {{have been the only}} signs used for diagnosing intrapartum <b>foetal</b> <b>asphyxia.</b> Although the system has the virtue of simplicity, the unexpected disappearance of foetal heart sound when the foetal heart rate was being recorded as normal, or the frequent delivery of a vigorous baby when a firm diagnosis of foetal distress had been made, have served as constant reminders that more precise tools are needed. Recently, with the technical improvement in electronic recording, it has become possible to obtain a continuous record of the foetal cardiac activity. At the same time the assessment of the significance of abnormalities of the foetal heart rate has been improved by measuring the pH of foetal blood obtained by the technique of foetal blood sampling (Saling, 1962). In this paper the advantages and limitations of these two techniques for diagnosing <b>foetal</b> <b>asphyxia</b> will be decribed. FOETAL BLOOD SAMPLING The technique. Blood is usually obtained from the skin over-lying the skull of the foetus, but may equally well be collected from the buttocks if the breech of the foetus is presenting. A conical endoscope is introduced through the cervix until it is firmly against the foetus. A small area of foetal skin can then be visualized and isolated from the surrounding amniotic fluid and debris. The skin is cleaned with a cotton wool swab, sprayed with ethyl chloride to produce reflex hyperaemia and covered with a thin film of silicone gel to allow the blood to form into discrete globules. One or two small incisions are made into the skin by means of a guarded blade...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE. To {{review the}} {{relationship}} between cerebral palsy and the birth process. DATA SOURCES. Medline and non-Medline literature search and personal experience. STUDY SELECTION. Articles that commented on the routinely used markers of foetal distress, such as abnormal foetal heart rate, meconium-stained liquor, and foetal acidosis. DATA EXTRACTION. Data were extracted and reviewed independently by both authors. DATA SYNTHESIS. The use of meconium alone {{as a predictor of}} cerebral palsy has a high false-positive rate of up to 99. 6 %. No specific foetal heart rate pattern that can accurately predict subsequent neurological impairment, and a low Apgar score is not by itself an indication of intrapartum asphyxia. The presence of encephalopathy in a neonate after birth and the association of multi-organ system dysfunction are important clues to the prior occurrence of <b>foetal</b> <b>asphyxia.</b> CONCLUSION. Cerebral palsy can be caused by asphyxia associated with the birth process. To be able to attribute cerebral palsy to peripartum asphyxia, there should be a sequence of signs during labour, delivery, and the perinatal period. Honest and sympathetic discussion between the obstetrician, paediatrician, and parents is critical throughout the counselling process. published_or_final_versio...|$|E
40|$|The overall aim of {{the work}} {{presented}} in this thesis was to increase knowledge concerning which new mothers delivered by emergency caesarean section (EmCS) may need extra attention for post-traumatic stress symptoms. The first specific aim {{was to examine the}} associations between, on the one hand, sense of coherence (SOC) and obstetric and demographic variables a few days postpartum, and on the other hand, post-traumatic stress symptoms three months postpartum (I). The second specific aim was to explore the experiences and perceptions of support from staff and family as related by women with or without post-traumatic stress symptoms (II). Methods: One-hundred-and twenty-two women delivered by emergency caesarean section (EmCS) participated in the prospective study. The Sense of Coherence Scale (SOC- 13) was administered two days after the EmCS and the Impact of Event Scale (IES- 15) was filled in three months after the EmCS (I). Experiences and perceptions of support postpartum were explored via telephone interviews six months later. We analyzed the interviews of 42 women with post-traumatic stress symptoms and 42 women without such symptoms (II). Manifest content analysis was used. Results: Independent risk factors associated with post-traumatic stress symptoms after an EmCS were: the woman s low SOC (OR 4. 12, 95 % CI 1. 72 - 9. 86) and imminent <b>foetal</b> <b>asphyxia</b> as an indication for caesarean (OR 2. 36, 95 % CI 1. 03 - 5. 44). The women who experienced low SOC were more often those with an intense fear of childbirth during pregnancy, immigrants and socially underprivileged women (I). The midwives actions, the content and organization of care, the women s emotions, {{and the role of the}} family, were main categories that seemed to influence the interviewees perceptions of support in connection with childbirth. Women with posttraumatic stress symptoms mentioned nervous or non-interested midwives, intense fear during delivery, lack of postnatal follow-up, long-term postpartum fatigue and inadequate help from partners. Women without symptoms reported involvement in the decision to undergo EmCS and a feeling of relief (II). Postpartum follow-up was often lacking among the women with post-traumatic stress symptoms. Conclusions: Symptoms of post-traumatic stress following EmCS are associated both with the new mother s personal coping style and the circumstances of the event. Both staff and family have important roles concerning support in connection with an EmCS. Women with post-traumatic stress symptoms tend to experience less support than women without symptoms. They also report more fear during the birth process and less involvement in the decision to perform an EmCS. Obstetric health care staff should actively contact new mothers with risk factors for stress symptoms following childbirth. Consultation by telephone may be a good alternative form of follow up...|$|E
