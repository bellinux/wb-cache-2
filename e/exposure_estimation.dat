40|$|CONCLUSION The {{analysis}} of the exposure measurement problem {{has shown that the}} proper measurement of counterparty exposure for portfolios of derivatives transactions is a complex task that cannot be performed without making a lot of simplifying assumptions. Because of the complicated interaction of correlation effects and offsettings from different transactions, the single transaction framework which is currently used by most banks is definitely not capable of accurately determining the portfolio credit risk. When simulation techniques are applied to estimate exposure, the accuracy of <b>exposure</b> <b>estimations</b> can be increased significantly. However, a lot of modelling choices has to be made concerning the valuation of transactions and the stochastic model of underlying market rates. Because the system has to make projections of market rates into the far future, the choice of an appropriate stochastic model for market rate dynamics is crucial in order to prevent unreasonable scenarios. The predominant application of models based on Brownian Motion in today’s bank risk management therefore leads to questionable results in respect to derivatives exposure evaluation...|$|R

40|$|It has not {{yet been}} {{established}} whether the spatial variation of particle number concentration (PNC) within a microscale environment can have an effect on <b>exposure</b> <b>estimation</b> results. In general, the degree of spatial variation within microscale environments remains unclear, since previous studies have only focused on spatial variation within macroscale environments. The aims of this study were to determine the spatial variation of PNC within microscale school environments, in order to assess the importance of the number of monitoring sites on <b>exposure</b> <b>estimation.</b> Furthermore, this paper aims to identify which parameters have the largest influence on spatial variation, as well as the relationship between those parameters and spatial variation. Air quality measurements were conducted for two consecutive weeks at each of the 25 schools across Brisbane, Australia. PNC was measured at three sites within the grounds of each school, along with the measurement of meteorological and several other air quality parameters. Traffic density was recorded for the busiest road adjacent to the school. Spatial variation at each school was quantified using coefficient of variation (CV). The portion of CV associated with instrument uncertainty was found to be 0. 3 and therefore, CV was corrected so that only non-instrument uncertainty was analysed in the data. The median corrected CV (CVc) ranged from 0 to 0. 35 across the schools, with 12 schools found to exhibit spatial variation. The study determined the number of required monitoring sites at schools with spatial variability and tested the deviation in <b>exposure</b> <b>estimation</b> arising from using only a single site. Nine schools required two measurement sites and three schools required three sites. Overall, the deviation in <b>exposure</b> <b>estimation</b> from using only one monitoring site was as much as one order of magnitude. The study also tested the association of spatial variation with wind speed/direction and traffic density, using partial correlation coefficients to identify sources of variation and non-parametric function estimation to quantify the level of variability. Traffic density and road to school wind direction were found to {{have a positive effect on}} CVc, and therefore, also on spatial variation. Wind speed was found to have a decreasing effect on spatial variation when it exceeded a threshold of 1. 5 (m/s), while it had no effect below this threshold. Traffic density had a positive effect on spatial variation and its effect increased until it reached a density of 70 vehicles per five minutes, at which point its effect plateaued and did not increase further as a result of increasing traffic density...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—A {{fundamentally}} {{new approach}} that accurately estimates the camera response function from comparametric data, i. e., pixel data from two differently exposed images over a common field of view, is presented. It does so by solving {{for the camera}} response function from its associated comparametric relation. The approach offers several advantageous features, including having a complexity that is independent {{of the number of}} pixel data considered, allowing for the modeling of saturated pixels, enabling an inherently constrained optimization problem to be solved in an unconstrained manner, and the easy incorporation into an existing framework for joint image registration. This is accomplished by approximating the camera response function with a constrained piecewise linear model so that its solution, within the comparametric camera relation, can be obtained. This results in a semiparametric comparametric model, optimally determined from pixel data, which is directly parameterized in terms of the exposure parameter. Subsequently, it is shown how this semiparametric model is used for <b>exposure</b> <b>estimation</b> from captured images. Finally, we incorporate the semiparametric model within an existing and previously published framework for simultaneous and joint spatial and tonal image registration in order to illustrate the developed model’s performance.

Application of the framework is illustrated for screening of exposure scenarios for nanoscale titanium dioxide, carbon nanotubes and fullerenes, but it is applicable to other nanomaterials as well. The results show that the WoE-based model overestimates exposure for scenarios where expert judgement was substantially used to fill data gaps, which suggests its conservative nature.

50|$|A {{challenge}} in automating {{the reporting of}} radiation <b>exposure</b> <b>estimations</b> has traditionally been a function of whether the record of dose provided by a manufacturer is persistent (i.e. stored electronically) or transient (i.e. displayed on a read-out).

Newer scanners are able to create DICOM Radiation Dose Structured Reports (RDSRs) alongside the images themselves.

Based on Iranian national standard, none of these preservatives are permitted to be used in Doogh. Methods: A total of 39 Doogh samples were analyzed through RP- HPLC in order to quantify sodium benzoate, potassium sorbate and natamaycin simultaneously. Exposure to each preservative is estimated by mean and maximum concentrations as the residue levels. The per capita Doogh consumption was calculated by the published data from official reports for Doogh annual production in Iran. Results: All samples were shown to contain sodium benzoate while natamaycin was detected in 10. 25 % of the samples and potassium sorbate was not detected in any of them. Sodium benzoate concentration extremely varied among the investigated samples ranged from 0. 94 to 9. 77 mg/l.

Indoor SVOC concentrations were found to be the most influential parameters. Both Henry's law constant (H) and octanol/water partition coefficient (Kow) uncertainty also had significant influence. While exposure media properties such as volume fraction of organic matter in the particle phase (fom-part), particle density (ρpart), concentration ([TSP]) and transport coefficient (ɣd) had a slight influence for some compounds, human parameters such as body weight (W), body surface area (A) and daily exposure (t) make a marginal or null contribution to the variance of dermal intake for a given age group.

Pure-tone audiometric thresholds of noise-exposed workers are compared to a non-exposed control group and to ISO- 1999 predictions. Regression analyses are conducted to explore the relationship between hearing loss and noise intensity, noise exposure time {{and the use of}} hearing protection. Results Noise-exposed workers had greater hearing losses compared to their non-noise-exposed colleagues and to the reference population reported in ISO- 1999. Noise exposure explained only a small proportion of hearing loss. When the daily noise exposure level rose from 80 dB(A) towards 96 dB(A), only a minor increase in hearing loss is shown.
