5|$|During the January 2006 auction, {{the website}} {{was subject to}} a {{distributed}} denial-of-service attack (DDoS) and ransom demand, which left it <b>inaccessible</b> <b>to</b> visitors for a week while its security system was upgraded. The Federal Bureau of Investigation and Wiltshire Constabulary investigated the attack and extortion attempt.|$|E

5|$|In 2010, an {{unlisted}} Bikeshare {{station was}} {{installed on the}} White House grounds, <b>inaccessible</b> <b>to</b> the public. It was removed in August 2017 {{at the request of}} the Trump Administration.|$|E
5|$|Swifts {{spend most}} of their time in flight. Few birds have the {{necessary}} speed and agility to catch them, hobbies being the main exception. The nest sites are also usually sufficiently <b>inaccessible</b> <b>to</b> be beyond the reach of snakes or mammalian predators.|$|E
5|$|The website was <b>inaccessible</b> <b>to</b> {{visitors}} {{for a week}} {{until the}} host server upgraded the security system, and filtered traffic through anti-DDoS software. Wiltshire Constabulary's Hi-Tech Crime Unit and the Federal Bureau of Investigation were called to investigate the extortion and attack; they believed it originated in Russia.|$|E
50|$|Since then, it {{has been}} {{relocated}} on the estate, as in the WOMUD year, the children's field was <b>inaccessible</b> due <b>to</b> it being flooded.|$|R

5|$|After his {{investigations}} Perring {{buried the}} robbers tunnel which remains <b>inaccessible</b> <b>to</b> this day. The pyramid of Userkaf entered the official records {{a few years}} later in 1842 when Karl Richard Lepsius catalogued it in his list of pyramids under number XXXI. Since Perring had already buried the robbers tunnel by that time, K. R. Lepsius did not investigate the pyramid any further.|$|E
5|$|Christmas {{television}} is predominantly secular {{and focuses on}} the ethical message of generosity through gift giving and Santa Claus, or the psychological message of home, nostalgia and childhood, or both. The theological message of the holidaythe Incarnationis rarely encountered in Christmas television. Such a message would be <b>inaccessible</b> <b>to</b> many Americans.|$|E
5|$|Pallas's {{surface is}} most likely {{composed}} of a silicate material; its spectrum and estimated density resemble carbonaceous chondrite meteorites. With an orbital inclination of 34.8Â°, Pallas's orbit is unusually highly inclined to {{the plane of the}} asteroid belt, and its orbital eccentricity is nearly as large as that of Pluto, making Pallas relatively <b>inaccessible</b> <b>to</b> spacecraft.|$|E
50|$|After Carter's {{work in the}} tomb, {{no further}} {{activities}} have been carried out. Since 1994 the burial chamber is <b>inaccessible</b> due <b>to</b> debris deposited by flooding.|$|R

50|$|In 1985 the {{entrance}} of the cave became <b>inaccessible</b> due <b>to</b> a landslide inside the former quarry area. In this context, the present condition of the cave paintings is not known.|$|R
5|$|The Watten {{site was}} {{captured}} on 4 September 1944 by Canadian forces. The Germans had evacuated {{it a few}} days earlier and removed the pumps which kept the cavernous basement free from water; not long afterwards it began to flood. This made a substantial amount of the bunker <b>inaccessible</b> <b>to</b> the Allies.|$|E
5|$|Around 1450 the Chajoma, led {{by their}} king Lajuj No'j, moved to Mixco Viejo (Jilotepeque Viejo) from Ochal {{to make their}} capital more <b>inaccessible</b> <b>to</b> their hostile neighbours. In spite of this, Iximche {{defeated}} the Chajoma and Jilotepeque Viejo became subject to the Kaqchikel kingdom. Groups C and E show Kaqchikel influence in their architectural styles, while groups A and B have a purer Chajoma architectural style. Both ballcourts {{appear to have been}} remodelled after the Kaqchikel fashion, with thick coatings of stucco.|$|E
5|$|Division of Sector West into Croatian- and RSK-controlled areas {{fragmented}} {{the market}} for locally grown agricultural produce, and produce processing plants were rendered <b>inaccessible</b> <b>to</b> most farmers. Furthermore, the RSK-controlled area of Sector West suffered from severe shortage of fuel and electricity, while the Croatian-held Pakrac was cut off from water supply systems fed by springs in the RSK-held area {{to the south of}} the town. The situation led the head of the UN Civil Affairs in Sector West, Gerard Fischer, and Argentine General Carlos Maria Zabala, commanding officer of the UNPROFOR in Sector West, to propose a degree of cooperation between local authorities on both sides in the area.|$|E
50|$|It is not {{staffed by}} any support personnel, {{and is not}} open to the public. During the winter months, it may be <b>inaccessible</b> due <b>to</b> the extreme weather {{conditions}} at the location.|$|R
50|$|When Corporal William Glass and {{his family}} became the first {{settlers}} at Tristan da Cunha in 1816, goats and pigs were brought <b>to</b> <b>Inaccessible</b> Island <b>to</b> serve {{as a source of}} food. Some domestic animals remained for at least 57 years and helped to keep the Stoltenhoff brothers alive during their expedition, but they have now died out. Cattle, sheep, and dogs were also introduced to the island at various points in the island's history, but none remain.|$|R
50|$|Today most of {{the city}} is <b>inaccessible</b> due <b>to</b> dense thorny vegetation. An ever {{increasing}} part of the former city area is occupied by modern settlement, especially in the vicinity of its lakes.|$|R
5|$|Habermas {{argues that}} his ethical theory is an {{improvement}} on Kant's ethics. He rejects the dualistic framework of Kant's ethics. Kant distinguished between the phenomena world, {{which can be}} sensed and experienced by humans, and the noumena, or spiritual world, which is <b>inaccessible</b> <b>to</b> humans. This dichotomy was necessary for Kant because it could explain the autonomy of a human agent: although a human is bound in the phenomenal world, their actions are free in the intelligible world. For Habermas, morality arises from discourse, which is made necessary by their rationality and needs, rather than their freedom.|$|E
5|$|Heilmann's {{articles}} were later collected and published {{as a book}} in Danish in 1916 with the title as in his series, Vor Nuvaerende Viden om Fuglenes Afstamming ("our present knowledge {{about the origin of}} birds"). This met the same lack of interest and is thought to have been a result of publishing in Danish, as this made it <b>inaccessible</b> <b>to</b> many scientists working in the U.S. and much of Europe. The field of paleontology at the time was dominated by American and English scientists, and the discipline in continental Europe was dominated by Germany and to a lesser degree France.|$|E
5|$|Route 68 {{begins at}} General Circle (<b>inaccessible</b> <b>to</b> the general public) with CR616 {{on the grounds}} of Fort Dix in New Hanover Township, heading to the north as a four-lane divided highway called Fort Dix Road. After passing a {{security}} gate to JB MDL, the road continues through public areas of the fort and crosses into Wrightstown, where it narrows into a two-lane undivided road before heading into Springfield Township. The route exits JB MDL at its intersection with CR670 and upon leaving the fort, it heads through a mix of farmland and woodland. Route 68 crosses CR537 before continuing north into agricultural areas with some homes.|$|E

50|$|Victoria's transit fleet {{is fully}} accessible, with either ramps or lifts {{providing}} access. Some bus stops are considered <b>inaccessible</b> due <b>to</b> their design, with inadequate space to accommodate wheelchairs or operation of vehicle ramps/lifts.|$|R
50|$|The lake is {{inhabited}} by various waterfowl and wetland birds. It is however too shallow and <b>inaccessible</b> (due <b>to</b> being surrounded with wetlands) {{to allow for}} recreation other than fishing and duck hunting in season.|$|R
5|$|The ARC {{became the}} driving force behind the design and {{development}} of the oN-Line System (NLS). He and his team developed computer interface elements such as bitmapped screens, the mouse, hypertext, collaborative tools, and precursors to the graphical user interface. He conceived and developed many of his user interface ideas in the mid-1960s, long before the personal computer revolution, at a time when most computers were <b>inaccessible</b> <b>to</b> individuals who could only use computers through intermediaries (see batch processing), and when software tended to be written for vertical applications in proprietary systems.|$|E
5|$|The Malagasy nationalists {{were mostly}} {{equipped}} with spears {{and had little}} protection from the firearms of the French military. They had expected that the United States might intervene in their favor, but no such action was taken by Washington. In addition, {{the majority of the}} population did not rise up to join them in their fight. Between July and September 1948, most of the key leaders of the Uprising were captured or killed. The last rebel stronghold, named Tsiazombazaha ("That which is <b>inaccessible</b> <b>to</b> Europeans"), fell in November 1948. Defeated, most of the remaining nationalist fighters disappeared into the eastern rainforest in December 1948.|$|E
5|$|The Royal Stoa was {{destroyed}} by the Roman army during the sack of Jerusalem in 70 CE. Its site on the Temple Mount esplanade is currently <b>inaccessible</b> <b>to</b> archaeologists. However, artifacts from the Stoa have been recovered both from excavations {{at the foot of}} the platform and in secondary use in later constructions. This evidence has confirmed details given in the accounts of the historian Josephus, and has also allowed comparison of the Royal Stoa's decoration with that used in other, contemporaneous monumental buildings.|$|E
25|$|This area {{is arguably}} the most {{important}} pyramid field in Egypt outside Giza and Saqqara, although until 1996 the site was <b>inaccessible</b> due <b>to</b> its location within a military base, and was relatively unknown outside archaeological circles.|$|R
50|$|Karl Leonhard Reinhold {{published}} {{two volumes}} of Letters Concerning the Kantian Philosophy in 1790 and 1792. They provided a clear explication of Kant's thoughts, which were previously <b>inaccessible</b> due <b>to</b> Kant's use of complex or technical language.|$|R
50|$|The island's {{southern}} coast has {{an abundance of}} deep ports and wide inlets, or 'bights', protected by reefs, while its northern coast is, save for a few narrow passages, largely <b>inaccessible</b> due <b>to</b> extensive coral reef growth.|$|R
