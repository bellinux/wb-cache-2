40|$|The Agreement on Agriculture {{ratified}} {{at the end}} of the Uruguay Round of WTO negotiations {{called for}} the conversion of non-tariff barriers to trade into bound tariffs. This tariffication would have resulted in excessively high tariffs, which would have threatened historic market access levels if not for WTO member countries agreeing to introduce tariff-rate quotas (TRQs). TRQs are two-tier tariffs. Imports below an agreed quota are taxed at a usually low (or zero) <b>in-quota</b> <b>tariff</b> <b>rate</b> while imported commodities in excess of the quota level are taxed at the higher (often prohibitive) over-quota tariff rate. In the process of implementing TRQs, WTO members failed to explicitly regulate TRQ administration procedures. As a result, numerous administration procedures for allocating import licenses were developed in many countries. Importing activities in the Canadian chicken industry have been regulated with a TRQ since 1995. Firms holding the right to import chicken products at the in-quota tariff can potentially enjoy significant rents due to the spread between domestic and world prices. The magnitude of these rents depends upon a number of domestic factors such as market concentration in the processing and retail sectors, production technology, farm output regulation, and so on. This analysis evaluates the preferences of Canadian chicken importers towards TRQ import licensing mechanisms and provides insights about importers’ attitudes towards Canadian trade policy in the chicken sector.

40|$|After {{joining the}} WTO in 2002, Taiwan allowed rice imports {{for the first}} time by {{implementing}} an import quota subject to a special safeguard tariff. In 2003, the import quota was expanded to a two-tier <b>tariff</b> <b>rate</b> import quota system. Although Taiwan maintained land set-asides and domestic support prices for producer sales to the State Trading Enterprise, the latter was limited to importing only 65 percent of the import quota with the rest sold to private traders. This sudden transformation of the Taiwanese import regime and rice market along with the government proposal for a "strategic alliance" amongst traders highlights the importance of studying the effects of policy reforms in the framework of imperfect domestic market structure. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to analyze Taiwanese rice policy reforms using a computational partial equilibrium model. The impact of import controls, price supports, land set-aside and alternative market structures are assessed, including the potential change in regimes within the tariff quota system. Our results show that the "strategic alliance" proposed by the agricultural authority will further distort the domestic market. Elimination of the domestic support price and land set-aside improves social welfare independent of the market structure while a change in the market structure towards competition is always social welfare improving regardless of domestic policy instruments. But the policy regime of the <b>tariff</b> quota (the <b>in-quota</b> <b>tariff</b> versus the out-of-quota tariff versus the quota) and hence social welfare is sensitive to changes in both domestic policy instruments and market structure. <b>tariff</b> <b>rate</b> quota, strategic alliance, domestic support, market structure, Agricultural and Food Policy, International Relations/Trade, Q 17, Q 18,...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{studies the}} impacts of several tariff {{reduction}} formulas on market access to US and EU agricultural markets. The two main instruments for the definition of market access are tariffs and TRQs. A liberalization of these policy instruments does not automatically improve import opportunities as this depends on the interaction of MFN tariff cuts, and developments of domestic supply and demand. Therefore, in separate simulations {{the effect of these}} instruments on different commodity markets is assessed. The simulations are carried out within the framework of a partial-equilibrium, spatial, multi-commodity trade model. The results show that for most commodities only limited new market access opportunities are created. In TRQ regimes stronger MFN tariff reductions as implied by the use of the Swiss approach achieve similar market access results as a combination of TRQ expansion and lowered <b>in-quota</b> <b>tariffs...</b>|$|R

We use a three-country model which is a FTA variant of the “third country model ” of the strategic trade policy. We assume that firms outside the FTA may supply, either by export or by FDI, homogeneous goods to the home market and that the home government can choose a fixed cost, as a FDI policy, that outside firms must incur {{in order to have}} production plants in the home country. First, when FDI cost is exogenous, if that cost is sufficiently low, the optimal external <b>tariff</b> <b>rate</b> is the critical rate at which the outside firms switch their supply mode from export to FDI.

Second, when FDI policy is endogenously determined, the optimal external <b>tariff</b> <b>rate</b> is the <b>tariff</b> <b>rate</b> at which the home welfare is maximized when outside firms choose export.
