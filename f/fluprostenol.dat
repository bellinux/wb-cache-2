50|$|The FP {{receptor}} is {{the least}} selective of the prostenoid receptors {{in that it is}} responsive to PGD2 {{and to a lesser extent}} PGE2 at concentrations close to those of PGF2α. Standard prostanoids have the following relative efficacies as receptor ligands in binding to and activating FP: PGF2α>PGD2>PGE2>PGI2=TXA2. In typical binding studies, PGF2α has one-half maximal binding and cell stimulating actions at ~1 nanomolar whereas PGD2 and PGE2 are ~5- to 10-fold and 10-100-fold weaker than this. The synthetic analogs that like PGF2α act as selective receptor agonists of FP viz., cloprostenol, flupostenol, latanoprost, and tafluprost (acid form) have FP binding affinities and stimulating potencies similar to PGF2α while others as enprostil, sulprostone, U46619, carbacyclin, and iloprost are considerably weaker FP agonists. <b>Fluprostenol</b> is a widely used clinically as a selective FP receptor agonist; latanoprost is a suitable substitute.|$|E
40|$|Summary. Uterine {{electromyography}} {{was performed}} by means of chronically implanted surface electrodes in 3 Pony mares during spontaneous oestrous cycles and following luteolysis induced by a prostaglandin analogue (<b>fluprostenol).</b> Three distinct patterns were recognized during the oestrous cycle. (1) During oestrus well defined phases of activity with closely grouped high-amplitude spikes were separated by long periods (10 =n- 5 min) of complete inactivity. (2) During dioestrus more diffuse phases of activity with low-amplitude spikes were separated by variable periods of relative inactivity. (3) During luteolysis, short and frequently occurring phases of activity were propagated between the two electrodes on one uterine horn; a similar pattern also occurred between 1 and 3 h after injection of <b>fluprostenol.</b> Peripheral plasma progesterone, but not total unconjugated oestrogen, concentrations were closely related to characteristics of the myographic activity during the cycle. Insemination during oestrus and injection of <b>fluprostenol</b> during dioestrus caused a marked and prolonged increase in myometrial electrical activity. Almost any non-specific environmental stimulus, including entry to the mare's stall {{and the sound of}} human voices, was able to influence myometrial activity at any stage of the cycle. Similar changes in activity were induced by palpation of the genital tract per rectum and vaginoscopic examination, but these were of brief duration and the normal resting pattern of activity was quickly re-established after completion of the manipulations...|$|E
40|$|We have {{previously}} reported that prostaglandin F- 2 alpha (PGF(2 alpha)) and its selective agonist <b>fluprostenol</b> increase {{basic fibroblast growth factor}} (FGF- 2) mRNA and protein production in osteoblastic Py 1 a cells. The present report extends our previous studies {{by showing that}} Py 1 a cells express FGF receptor- 2 (FGFR 2) and that treatment with PGF(2 alpha) or <b>fluprostenol</b> decreases FGFR 2 mRNA. We have used confocal and electron microscopy to show that, under PGF(2 alpha) stimulation, FGF- 2 and FGFR 2 proteins accumulate near the nuclear envelope and colocalize in the nucleus of Py 1 a cells. Pre-treatment with cycloheximide blocks nuclear labelling for FGF- 2 in response to PGF(2 alpha). Treatment with SU 5402 does not block prostaglandin-mediated nuclear internalization of FGF- 2 or FGFR 2. Various effectors have been used to investigate the signal transduction pathway. In particular, pre-treatment with phorbol 12 -myristate 13 -acetate (PMA) prevents the nuclear accumulation of FGF- 2 and FGFR 2 in response to PGF 2 a. Similar results are obtained by pre-treatment with the protein kinase C (PKC) inhibitor H- 7. In addition, cells treated with PGF(2 alpha) exhibit increased nuclear labelling for the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), p 44 /ERK 2. Pre-treatment with PMA blocks prostaglandin-induced ERK 2 nuclear labelling, as confirmed by Western blot analysis. We conclude that PGF(2 alpha) stimulates nuclear translocation of FGF- 2 and FGFR 2 by a PKC-dependent pathway; we also suggest an involvement of MAPK/ERK 2 in this process...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The {{factors that}} {{regulate}} vascular mechanotransduction {{and how this}} process may be altered with aging are poorly understood and have not been widely studied. Recent data suggest that increased tissue loading can result in the release of prostaglandin F 2 alpha (PGF 2 α) and other reports indicate that aging diminishes {{the ability of the}} aged aorta to activate mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling in response to increased loading. Using ex vivo incubations, here we investigate whether aging affects the ability of the aorta to induce phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1 / 2 (ERK-MAPK), p 38 -MAPK, and Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK-MAPK) activation following stimulation with a PGF 2 α analog, <b>fluprostenol.</b> Compared to aortas from 6 -mo animals, the amounts of ERK- and p 38 -MAPK remained unchanged with aging, while the level of JNK-MAPK protein increased by 135 % and 100 % at 30 - and 36 -mo, respectively. Aging increased the basal phosphorylation of ERK (115 % and 47 %) and JNK (29 % and 69 %) (p < 0. 05) in 30 - and 36 -mo aortas, while p 38 phosphorylation levels remained unaltered. Compared to age-matched controls, <b>fluprostenol</b> induced phosphorylation of ERK (310 %, 286 %, and 554 %), p 38 -MAPK (unchanged, 48 %, and 148 %), and JNK (78 %, 88 %, and 95 %) in 6 -, 30 -and 36 -mo aortas, respectively. These findings suggest that aging does not affect the ability of the rat aorta to activate ERK-, p 38 -MAPK, and JNK-MAPK phosphorylation in response to PGF 2 α stimulation...|$|E
40|$|This {{study was}} {{undertaken}} to characterize pharmacologically the prostanoid receptor subtypes mediating contraction in human umbilical vein (HUV). HUV rings were mounted in organ baths and concentration–response curves to U- 46619 (TXA 2 mimetic) were {{constructed in the}} absence or presence of SQ- 29548 or ICI- 192, 605 (TP receptor antagonists). U- 46619 was a potent constrictor (pEC 50 : 8. 03). SQ- 29548 and ICI- 192, 605 competitively antagonized responses to U- 46619 with pKB values of 7. 96 and 9. 07, respectively. Concentration–response curves to EP receptor agonists: PGE 2, misoprostol and 17 -phenyl-trinor-PGE 2 gave pEC 50 values of 5. 06, 5. 25 and 5. 32, respectively. Neither pEC 50 nor maximum of PGE 2 and 17 -phenyl-trinor-PGE 2 concentration–response curves were modified by the DP/EP 1 /EP 2 receptor antagonist AH 6809 (1 μM). However, ICI- 192, 605 produced a concentration-dependent antagonism of the responses to all the EP receptor agonists. The pA 2 estimated for ICI- 192, 605 against PGE 2 or misoprostol were 8. 91 and 9. 22, respectively. Concentration–response curves to FP receptor agonists: PGF 2 α and <b>fluprostenol</b> gave pEC 50 values of 6. 20 and 5. 82, respectively. ICI- 192, 605 (100 nM) was completely ineffective against PGF 2 α or <b>fluprostenol.</b> In addition, lack of antagonistic effect of AH 6809 (1 μM) against PGF 2 α was observed. In conclusion, the findings obtained with TP-selective agonist and antagonists provide strong evidence of the involvement of TP receptors promoting vasoconstriction in HUV. Furthermore, {{the action of the}} natural and synthetic EP receptor agonists appears to be mediated via TP receptors. On the other hand, the results employing FP receptor agonists and antagonists of different prostanoid receptors suggest the presence of FP receptors mediating vasoconstriction in this vessel...|$|E

Plasma was spiked with a tetradeuterated analog of travoprost free acid (AL- 5848 X) as internal standard (IS) and acidified with 0. 1 M formic acid. Sample clean up was performed using reversed phase solid-phase extraction. Following elution of the compounds of interest and evaporation to dryness, the residue was reconstituted in methanol:water (1 : 1) and chromatographed on an octadecylsilica (C 18) column with negative ion electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry. The [M[bond]H](-) ions at m/z 457 and 461 for the analyte and IS, respectively, were subjected to collisional fragmentation with argon to yield the same intense 3 -trifluoromethylphenolate (m/z 161) product ion. The validated concentration range was 0. 010 - 3. 00 ng/ml based on a 1. 0 ml plasma aliquot. Fully adequate accuracy, precision, specificity, recovery and stability for routine use in clinical pharmacokinetic studies were demonstrated.

40|$|Fibroblast growth factor- 2 (FGF- 2) and {{prostaglandin}}s (PGs) are mitogenic for bone {{cells and}} have biphasic effects on bone formation.

In this study we examined the effect of PGs, particularly prostaglandin F 2 alpha (PGF 2 alpha) and the selective PGF 2 alpha agonist, <b>fluprostenol</b> (Flup), on FGF- 2 mRNA and protein in the immortalized rat osteoblastic cell line Py 1 a and 21 day fetal rat calvariae. Py 1 a cells were grown to confluence in Ham’s F- 12 medium containing 5 % fetal calf serum and then serum deprived for 24 h before treatment with PGs. FGF- 2 mRNA levels were analyzed be Northern blot, quantitated by densitometry and normalized to glyceraldehyde 3 phosphate dehydrogenase mRNA. In control cultures, Py 1 a cells constitutively expressed FGF- 2 transcripts of approximately 4, 2, and 1. 5 kb with low levels of a 6 kd transcript. Treatment with Flup for 3 hours caused an approximately 2 -fold increase in cytoplasmic labeling for FGF- 2 protein in periosteal cells, osteoblasts and osteocytes. However, there was decreased labeling of the matrix. We conclude that PGs can induce high molecular weight FGF- 2 transcripts and increase FGF- 2 protein in bone cells. These data suggest that some effects of PGs on bone remodeling may be mediated by the regulation of endogenous FGF- 2 production...|$|E
40|$|Although prostanoids {{are known}} to be {{involved}} in regulation of the spontaneous beating rate of cultured neonatal rat cardiomyocytes, the various subtypes of prostanoid receptors have not been investigated in detail. In our experiments, prostaglandin (PG) F 2 a and prostanoid FP receptor agonists (<b>fluprostenol,</b> latanoprost and cloprostenol) produced a decrease in the beating rate. Two prostanoid IP receptor agonists (iloprost and beraprost) induced first a marked drop in the beating rate and then definitive abrogation of beating. In contrast, the prostanoid DP receptor agonists (PGD 2 and BW 245 C) and TP receptor agonists (U- 46619) produced increases in the beating rate. Sulprostone (a prostanoid EP 1 and EP 3 receptor agonist) induced marked increases in the beating rate, which were suppressed by SC- 19220 (a selective prostanoid EP 1 antagonist). Butaprost (a selective prostanoid EP 2 receptor agonist), misoprostol (a prostanoid EP 2 and EP 3 receptor agonist), 11 -deoxy-PGE 1 (a prostanoid EP 2, EP 3 and EP 4 receptor agonist) did not alter the beating rate. Our results strongly suggest that prostanoid EP 1 receptors are involved in positive regulation of the beating rate. Prostanoid EP 1 receptor expression was confirmed by western blotting with a selective antibody. Hence, neonatal rat cardiomyocytes express both prostanoid IP and FP receptors (which negatively regulate the spontaneous beating rate) and prostanoid TP, DP 1 and EP 1 receptors (which positively regulate the spontaneous beating rate) ...|$|E
40|$|Prostaglandin (PG) F 2 α {{suppresses}} adipocyte differentiation by inhibiting {{the function}} of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ. However, PGF 2 α synthase (PGFS) in adipocytes remains to be identified. Here, we studied the expression {{of members of the}} aldo-keto reductase (AKR) 1 B family acting as PGFS during adipogenesis of mouse 3 T 3 -L 1 cells. AKR 1 B 3 mRNA was expressed in preadipocytes, and its level increased about 4 -fold at day 1 after initiation of adipocyte differentiation, and then quickly decreased the following day to a level lower than that in the preadipocytes. In contrast, the mRNA levels of Akr 1 b 8 and 1 b 10 were clearly lower than that level of Akr 1 b 3 in preadipocytes and remained unchanged during adipogenesis. The transient increase in Akr 1 b 3 during adipogenesis was also observed by Western blot analysis. The mRNA for the FP receptor, which is selective for PGF 2 α, was also expressed in preadipocytes. Its level increased about 2 -fold within 1 h after the initiation of adipocyte differentiation and was maintained at almost the same level throughout adipocyte differentiation. The small interfering RNA for Akr 1 b 3, but not for Akr 1 b 8 or 1 b 10, suppressed PGF 2 α production and enhanced the expression of adipogenic genes such as peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ, fatty acid-binding protein 4 (aP 2), and stearoyl-CoA desaturase. Moreover, an FP receptor agonist, <b>Fluprostenol,</b> suppressed the expression of those adipogenic genes in 3 T 3 -L 1 cells; whereas an FP receptor antagonist, AL- 8810, efficiently inhibited the suppression of adipogenesis caused by the endogenous PGF 2 α.

40|$|To {{characterize}} the prostanoid receptors (TP, FP, EP 1 and/or EP 3) {{involved in the}} vasoconstriction of human pulmonary veins, isolated venous preparations were challenged with different prostanoid-receptor agonists in the absence or presence of selective antagonists. The stable thromboxane A 2 mimetic, U 46619, was a potent constrictor agonist on human pulmonary veins (pEC 50 = 8. 60 ± 0. 11 and Emax= 4. 61 ± 0. 46 [*]g; n= 15). The affinity values for two selective TP-antagonists (BAY u 3405 and GR 32191 B) versus U 46619 were BAY u 3405 : pA 2 = 8. 94 ± 0. 23 (n= 3) and GR 32191 B: apparent pKB= 8. 25 ± 0. 34 (n= 3), respectively. These {{results are consistent with}} the involvement of TP-receptor in the U 46619 induced contractions. The two EP 1 -/EP 3 - agonists (17 -phenyl-PGE 2 and sulprostone) induced contraction of human pumonary veins (pEC 50 = 8. 56 ± 0. 18; Emax= 0. 56 ± 0. 24 [*]g; n= 5 and pEC 50 = 7. 65 ± 0. 13; Emax= 1. 10 ± 0. 12 [*]g; n= 14, respectively). The potency ranking for these agonists: 17 -phenyl-PGE 2 >sulprostone suggests the involvement of an EP 1 -receptor rather than EP 3. In addition, the contractions induced by sulprostone, 17 -phenyl-PGE 2 and the IP-/EP 1 - agonist (iloprost) were blocked by the DP-/EP 1 -/EP 2 -receptor antagonist (AH 6809) {{as well as by the}} EP 1 antagonist (SC 19220). PGF 2 α induced small contractions which were blocked by AH 6809 while <b>fluprostenol</b> was ineffective.

Although PGF 2 α 1 -OH and PGF 2 α 1 -OCH 3 exhibited potent contractile effects similar to 17 -phenyl PGF 2 α in the cat lung parenchymal preparation, they were approximately 1000 times less potent than 17 -phenyl PGF 2 α in stimulating recombinant feline and human FP receptors. In human dermal fibroblasts and Swiss 3 T 3 cells PGF 2 α 1 -OH and PGF 2 α 1 -OCH 3 produced no Ca 2 + signal until a 1 [*]μM concentration was exceeded. Pretreatment of Swiss 3 T 3 cells with either 1 [*]μM PGF 2 α 1 -OH or PGF 2 α 1 -OCH 3 did not attenuate Ca 2 + signal responses produced by PGF 2 α or <b>fluprostenol.</b> In the rat uterus, PGF 2 α 1 -OH was about two orders of magnitude less potent than 17 -phenyl PGF 2 α whereas PGF 2 α 1 -OCH 3 produced only a minimal effect. Radioligand binding studies on cat lung parenchymal plasma membrane preparations suggested that the cat lung parenchyma does not contain a homogeneous population of receptors that equally respond to PGF 2 α 1 -OH, PGF 2 α 1 -OCH 3, and classical FP receptor agonists. Studies on smooth muscle preparations and cells containing DP, EP 1, EP 2, EP 3, EP 4, IP, and TP receptors indicated that the activity of PGF 2 α 1 -OH and PGF 2 α 1 -OCH 3 could not be ascribed to interaction with these receptors. The potent effects of PGF 2 α 1 -OH and PGF 2 α 1 -OCH 3 on the cat lung parenchyma are difficult to describe in terms of interaction with the FP or any other known prostanoid receptor...|$|E
40|$|The {{mechanisms}} by which prostaglandin F 2 α (PGF 2 α) increases intracellular Ca 2 + concentration [Ca 2 +]i in vascular smooth muscle remain unclear. We examined the role of store-, receptor- and voltage-operated Ca 2 + influx pathways in rat intrapulmonary arteries (IPA) loaded with Fura PE- 3. Low concentrations (0. 01 – 1 μm) of PGF 2 α caused a transient followed by a plateau rise in [Ca 2 +]i. Both responses became maximal at 0. 1 μm PGF 2 α. At higher concentrations of PGF 2 α, a further slower rise in [Ca 2 +]i was superimposed on the plateau. The [Ca 2 +]i response to 0. 1 μm PGF 2 α was mimicked by the FP receptor agonist <b>fluprostenol,</b> whilst the effect of 10 μm PGF 2 α was mimicked by the TP receptor agonist U- 46619. The plateau rise in [Ca 2 +]i in response to 0. 1 μm PGF 2 α was insensitive to diltiazem, and was abolished in Ca 2 +-free physiological salt solution, and by pretreatment with La 3 +, 2 -APB, thapsigargin or U- 73122. The rises in [Ca 2 +]i in response to 10 μm PGF 2 α and 0. 01 μm U- 46619 were partially inhibited by diltiazem. The diltiazem-resistant components of both of these responses were inhibited by 2 -APB and La 3 + to an extent which was significantly less than that seen for the response to 0. 1 μm PGF 2 α, and were also much less sensitive to U- 73122. The U- 46619 response was also relatively insensitive to thapsigargin. When Ca 2 + was replaced with Sr 2 +, the sustained increase in the Fura PE- 3 signal to 0. 1 μm PGF 2 α was abolished, whereas 10 μm PGF 2 α and 0. 05 μm U- 46619 still caused substantial increases. These results suggest that low concentrations of PGF 2 α act via FP receptors to cause IP 3 -dependent Ca 2 + release and store operated Ca 2 + entry (SOCE). U- 46619 and 10 – 100 μm PGF 2 α cause a TP receptor-mediated Ca 2 + influx involving both L-type Ca 2 + channels and a receptor operated pathway, which differs from SOCE in its susceptibility to La 3 +, 2 -APB and thapsigargin, does not require phospholipase C activation, and is Sr 2 + permeable...|$|E

Rat osteoblatic Py 1 a cells were grown to confluence in ham’s F- 12 medium containing 5 % fetal calf serum and then serum deprived for 24 h before treatment with PGF 2 alpha or Flup for 2 h to 24 h. Expression of FGFR mRNA was determined by northern blot analysis. Py 1 a cells expressed only one FGF receptor (FGFR 2). In the absence of serum Py 1 a cells expressed a 4 kb FGFR 2 mRNA transcript. Time course experiments revealed that PGF 2 alpha caused a 40 % and Flup a 60 % reduction in FGFR 2 mRNA levels at 4 h and both caused an 80 % reduction after 24 h. To investigate in situ localization of FGF- 2 and FGFR 2 protein, binding patterns of FITC labeled antibodies to FGF- 2 and FGFR 2 were examined by confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM). Py 1 a cells expressed low levels of cytoplasmic and nuclear localization for both FGF- 2 and FGFR 2 protein. Following 24 h of treatment with PGF 2 alpha or Flup, FGF- 2 and FGFR 2 proteins accumulated at nuclear membrane and were also co-localized in the nucleus of Py 1 a cells. CLSM studies showed that pretreatment with cycloheximide blocked nuclear labeling for FGF- 2 in response to PGF 2 alpha. Treatment with SU 5402, a specific FGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor, did not block PG mediated nuclear accumulation of FGF- 2 or FGFR 2. In contrast, pretreatment with PMA, an activator of pretein kinase C (PKC) pathway prevented the nuclear accumulation of FGF- 2 and FGFR 2 in response to PGF 2 alpha. Similar results were obtained by pretreatment with the PKC inhibitor H 7. Cells treated with PGs or PMA showed increased nuclear labeling for the mitogen activated protein kinase, p 44 /ERK 2, compared to control cultures. Pretreatment with PMA blocked both PG and PMA induced ERK 2 nuclear labeling.
