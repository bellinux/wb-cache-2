She told him he was free to leave and could phone her if he wanted to, which seemed to reassure him. She last saw him with one of his roommates sitting on the steps of the museum around 8:30pm.|$|E
25|$|Maximilian I shared rule {{with his}} father during the latter year of Frederick's reign, being elected King of the Romans in 1486. By {{acquiring}} the lands of the Tyrolean line of the Habsburgs in 1490 he finally reunited all the Austrian lands, divided since 1379. He also needed {{to deal with the}} Hungarian problem when Mathias I died in 1490. Maximilian reconquered the lost parts of Austria and established peace with Mathias's successor Vladislaus II at the Peace of Pressburg in 1491. However the dynastic pattern of division and unification would be one that <b>kept</b> <b>repeating</b> itself over time. With unsettled borders Maximilian found Innsbruck in the Tyrol a safer place for a capital, between his Burgundian and Austrian lands, although he was rarely in any place for very long, being acutely aware of how his father had been repeatedly besieged in Vienna.|$|E
500|$|Khalid ibn al-Walid {{was also}} sent {{to invite the}} Banu Jadhimah tribe to Islam. They started saying 'Saba'na, Saba'na' (we became Sabians), so Khalid took them prisoners and started {{executing}} some of them, due to past enmity, before being stopped by Abdur Rahman bin Awf. Some men from Banu Jadhimah had previously killed Al-Fakih Ibn Al-Mughirah Al-Makhzumi, the uncle of Khalid, and Awf Ibn Abd-Awf, father of Abdur Rahman bin Awf. Muhammad got very angry when he heard of Khalid's behavior; then paid money to the relatives {{of the dead and}} compensated for the property destroyed and he <b>kept</b> <b>repeating</b> aloud: [...] "O God, I am innocent of what Khalid ibn al-Walid has done!" ...|$|E

500|$|Reviews of {{the other}} two tracks were {{generally}} positive. Brackpool wrote favorably about [...] "Grand Ideas" [...] and made comparisons to Vangelis and Tangerine Dream, while Hoffman named it the most danceable track on the album. Though Battaglia felt the song <b>kept</b> <b>repeating</b> the same chord progression, he believed the [...] "accents and shifts in pitch" [...] strengthened it. Jeff Rovinelli writing for Tiny Mix Tapes thought [...] "The Long Way Home" [...] sounded silly. Brackpool agreed, writing [...] " [...] isolated {{from the rest of the}} album [...] could easily pass for generic library music..." [...] While Draper considered it a solid song, he decided it was a [...] "little too saccharine for its own good". Hoffman enjoyed the song and wrote [...] "the vibe is rangy and exultant [...] as blissful and bemused as the vehemently unpretentious [...] shot of Lindstrøm." ...|$|E
500|$|Two of {{the bridge}} players, Frederic Seward and William Sloper, {{accompanied}} Gibson and her mother to the lifeboats. The group boarded lifeboat no. 7, {{the first to be}} launched. Around 27 other people were on board the boat when it was lowered at 12:40am, just over an hour after the collision. The lifeboat's plug could not be found, causing water to gush in until, as Gibson later put it, [...] "this was remedied by volunteer contributions from the lingerie of the women and the garments of men." [...] Around 1,500 people were still aboard Titanic when she sank, throwing them into freezing water where they soon died of hypothermia. As they struggled in the water, Gibson heard what she described as a [...] "terrible cry that rang out from people who were thrown into the sea and others who were afraid for their loved ones." [...] The sinking deeply affected her; according to Sloper, she became [...] "quite hysterical and <b>kept</b> <b>repeating</b> over and over so that people near us could hear her, 'I'll never ride in my little grey car again.'" [...] The occupants of the lifeboat were finally rescued at 6:15am by the RMS Carpathia and taken to New York.|$|E
500|$|A teenage {{couple in}} Klass County, Washington, are {{returning}} from a date one evening when their car suddenly stops, they see a UFO, and are captured {{by a pair of}} grey aliens. However, the aliens are themselves soon confronted by a giant third alien from another race. Agent Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) is interviewed about the case by famed author Jose Chung (Charles Nelson Reilly), who is researching a book he is writing about alien abductions and the UFO phenomenon. Scully notes that the girl, Chrissy, was found with all her clothes inside out, appearing to be the victim of date rape. Her date, Harold, is brought in by the police. He claims that he did not rape Chrissy, but that they were both abducted by aliens. The foul-mouthed local detective, Manners (whose profanity is humorously replaced with words such as [...] "bleep" [...] and [...] "blank"), does not believe Harold's story, but Agent Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) has Chrissy undergo hypnosis, in which she describes being on a spaceship surrounded by aliens. Harold claims to have encountered a cigarette-smoking grey alien on the ship who <b>kept</b> <b>repeating,</b> [...] "This is not happening." [...] Mulder is convinced that Chrissy and Harold were abducted by aliens, but Scully thinks it is more plausible that the two teenagers simply had consensual sex and are struggling to deal with the emotional aftermath.|$|E

500|$|Other reviews echoed {{complaints}} about the similarity of Blue Shift to previous games. GameSpy's reviewer Jamie Madigan stated that [...] "what really pulls the game down is the 'more of the same' factor". Although writing that the game [...] "feels like {{just a few more}} levels for the original game", he noted that this is what Blue Shift was designed to be, given its origins as an add-on for a Dreamcast version of Half-Life. Madigan described the single-player campaign as [...] "decent" [...] and commented that the High Definition pack made the game [...] "worthy of consideration". Eurogamer echoed criticism on the game's length; reviewer Tom Bradwell commented that [...] "although I'm hard pressed to criticize what you get, the complete absence of everything we've learnt from the likes of Counter-Strike and everything since is frankly bizarre". Bradwell did, however, criticize the game's artificial intelligence and the occasional bug that caused a player to get stuck on a wall. PC Zones Mark Hill was more lenient in his comments, praising the game's artificial intelligence as [...] "intelligent as you could hope an AI enemy to be". In addition, Hill praised the game for showing more activity in the base, noting that [...] "a whole world goes on around you, with people eating at a cantina and scientists doing their laundry. The complex is more alive than ever before". Hill also praised the focus [...] "on a greater interaction with scientists as proper people rather than the two or three models that were cloned throughout the facility who <b>kept</b> <b>repeating</b> the same phrases", describing this as Blue Shifts [...] "greatest achievement". PC Zones review closed by commenting that [...] "as a Dreamcast extra it works perfectly, but as a standalone PC title there's not nearly enough to it." ...|$|E

In describing the incident, Rather said, [...] "I got mugged. Who understands these things? I didn't and I don't now. I didn't make a lot of it at the time and I don't now.

60|$|It {{was then}} that he lost the decorum and {{restraint}} a man keeps up for his own sake. He got down {{on his hands and}} knees, with the lamp on the floor, to look under the bed, like a silly girl. He saw a lot of dust and nothing else.

2500|$|The Soviets, {{trailing}} for {{the first}} time in the game, attacked ferociously. Moments after Eruzione's goal, Maltsev fired a shot which ricocheted off the right goal post. As the minutes wound down, Brooks <b>kept</b> <b>repeating</b> to his players, [...] "Play your game. Play your game." [...] Instead of going into a defensive crouch, the United States continued to play offense, even getting off a few more shots on goal. The Soviets began to shoot wildly, and Sergei Starikov admitted that [...] "we were panicking". As the clock ticked down below a minute, the Soviets got the puck back into the American zone, and Mikhailov passed to Vladimir Petrov, who shot wide. The Soviets never pulled Myshkin for an extra attacker, much to the Americans' disbelief. Starikov later explained that [...] "We never did six-on-five", not even in practice, because [...] "Tikhonov just didn't believe in it". Craig kicked away a Petrov slap shot with 33seconds left. Kharlamov fired the puck back in as the clock ticked below 20seconds. A wild scramble for the puck ensued, ending when Johnson found it and passed it to Ken Morrow. As the U.S. team tried to clear the zone (move the puck over the blue line, which they did with seven seconds remaining), the crowd began to count down the seconds left. Sportscaster Al Michaels, who was calling the game on ABC along with former Montreal Canadiens goalie Ken Dryden, picked up on the countdown in his broadcast, and delivered his famous call: ...|$|E
2500|$|At daybreak on 8 February 1944, planes {{from the}} escort {{carriers}} were covering the convoy. At 13:00, the convoy changed course {{and started the}} last leg of the route toward the British Isles. At 19:30, fog set in and all ships were out of sight of LST-21 which turned on navigation lights and sounded whistle to avoid collision. At 8:45, the fog lifted and at 24:00 the convoy executed an emergency turn to starboard. On 9 February, at 00:35, the convoy resumed it course. At 01:13, they received a radio message that a submarine, , was sunk off the port side of the convoy. At 08:11, the convoy executed an emergency turn of 45 degrees to port, and at 08:40 resumed course. At 10:10, an escort on the starboard bow indicated a contact. LST-21s radioman tuned into an extra receiver on the escorts' and the planes' frequency and the officers and crew in LST-21s wheelhouse listened in on their communications. At approximately 11:00, a plane reported a sub on the surface bearing 150 degrees. The pilot <b>kept</b> <b>repeating</b> this to the Escort Commander, until the reply came back: [...] "Stop telling us about it and get the 'bowstud.'" [...] A few minutes later, the plane reported back: [...] "One down. One down." [...] At 12:14, all ships received a message from the convoy commander confirming the sinking of the second submarine. The weather was thick and visibility only about a mile and a half. At 16:45, they received another message from the Commodore confirming the sinking of a third submarine. The escorts and planes were noted to be having a difficult time with communications due to all of the contacts, real or imagined.|$|E
