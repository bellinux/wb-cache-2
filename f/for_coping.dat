5|$|The moult {{of their}} flight {{feathers}} can cause serious problems for birds, {{as it can}} impair their ability to fly. Different species have evolved different strategies <b>for</b> <b>coping</b> with this, ranging from dropping all their flight feathers at once (and thus becoming flightless for some {{relatively short period of}} time) to extending the moult {{over a period of several}} years.|$|E
5|$|The more {{positive}} emotions and behavior that a 12- to 24-month-old toddler displays when coping with separation from a parent, the better s/he is 3.5 years later at using cooling strategies {{in order to}} delay gratification. This suggests that the emotional skills and processes required <b>for</b> <b>coping</b> with social and interpersonal frustrations {{are similar to those}} utilized <b>for</b> <b>coping</b> with the aggravation of goal-directed delay of gratification. Maternal attachment also influences the development of a child's ability to delay gratification. An interaction has been found between a mother's level of control and how close a child stays to the mother while exploring the environment. Children who have controlling mothers and explore their environment at a far distance from her are able to employ more cooling strategies and delay rewards longer. Similarly, children who stay close to a non-controlling mothers also use more cool strategies and demonstrate longer delays. This suggests that some children of controlling mothers have better learned how to distract themselves from or effectively avoid intrusive stimuli, although additional effects on their emotional competency are speculated but unknown. A greater capacity to delay gratification by using effective attentional strategies is also seen in preschoolers whose mothers had been responsive and supportive during particularly stressful times of self-regulation when the child was a toddler, indicating that maternal responsiveness during highly demanding times is crucial for the development of self-regulation, self-control and emotional competency.|$|E
5|$|A {{securely}} attached toddler will explore freely while the caregiver is present, engage with strangers, be visibly upset when the caregiver departs, and {{happy to see}} the caregiver return. The anxious-ambivalent toddler is anxious of exploration, extremely distressed when the caregiver departs but ambivalent when the caregiver returns. The anxious-avoidant toddler will not explore much, avoid or ignore the parent—showing little emotion when the parent departs or returns—and treat strangers {{much the same as}} caregivers with little emotional range shown. The disorganized/disoriented toddler shows a lack of a coherent style or pattern <b>for</b> <b>coping.</b> Evidence suggests this occurs when the caregiving figure is also an object of fear, thus putting the child in an irresolvable situation regarding approach and avoidance. On reunion with the caregiver, these children can look dazed or frightened, freezing in place, backing toward the caregiver or approaching with head sharply averted, or showing other behaviors implying fear of the person who is being sought. It is thought to represent a breakdown of an inchoate attachment strategy and it appears to affect the capacity to regulate emotions.|$|E

5|$|Between 8 and 10 May 1926, regular {{elections}} to the Third Seimas were held. For {{the first time}} since 1920, the bloc led by the Lithuanian Christian Democratic Party, which strongly supported the Roman Catholic Church and its clergy, did not obtain a majority. The Lithuanian people were disillusioned with this party, as its members had been involved in several financial scandals: Juozas Purickas had been using his diplomatic privileges in Moscow to deal in cocaine and saccharin; Eliziejus Draugelis and Petras Josiukas had purchased cheap low-quality smoked pig fat from Germany instead of buying from Lithuanian farmers; and the Minister of Finance, Vytautas Petrulis, had transferred a large sum of money from the state budget to his personal account. The party's strategies <b>for</b> <b>coping</b> with an economic crisis were perceived as ineffective. An additional tension arose when the Concordat of 1925 between Poland and the Holy See unilaterally recognized Vilnius as an ecclesiastical province of Poland, despite Lithuanian requests to govern Vilnius directly from Rome. Although it was not traditionally a Vatican policy to establish an arrangement of this type, the decision was objected to strongly by many Lithuanians. The decision implied that the Pope had recognized Polish claims to Vilnius, and this created a loss of prestige for the Christian Democrats. Diplomatic relations with the Holy See were severed, and they did not improve when Pope Pius XI unilaterally established and reorganized Lithuanian ecclesiastical provinces in April 1926 without regard to Lithuanian proposals and demands.|$|E

Other mechanisms by which attachment styles may influence relationship satisfaction include emotional expressiveness, strategies <b>for</b> <b>coping</b> with conflict, and perceived support from partners. Further {{studies are needed to}} better understand how attachment styles influence relationship satisfaction.|$|E

25|$|Findings {{have shown}} in {{specific}} cases that paranormal belief {{acts as a}} psychodynamic coping function {{and serves as a}} mechanism <b>for</b> <b>coping</b> with stress.

A study of a random sample of 502 adults revealed paranormal experiences were common in the population which were linked to a history of childhood trauma and dissociative symptoms. Research has also suggested that people who perceive themselves as having little control over their lives may develop paranormal beliefs to help provide an enhanced sense of control.|$|E
25|$|The action–motivation model {{proposes that}} {{inconsistencies}} in a person's cognition cause mental stress, because psychologic inconsistency {{interferes with the}} person's functioning in the real world. Among the ways <b>for</b> <b>coping,</b> the person can choose to exercise a behavior that is inconsistent {{with his or her}} current attitude (a belief, an ideal, a value system), but later try to alter that belief to be consonant with a current behaviour; the cognitive dissonance occurs when the person's cognition does not match the action taken. If the person changes the current attitude, after the dissonance occurs, he or she then is obligated to commit to that course of behaviour.|$|E

25|$|While some {{research}} indicates that psychological resilience is a relatively stable personality trait, new research suggests that positive emotions are critical to trait resilience. This {{is not to say}} that positive emotions are merely a by-product of resilience, but rather that feeling positive emotions during stressful experiences may have adaptive benefits in the coping process of the individual. Empirical evidence for this prediction arises from research on resilient individuals who have a propensity <b>for</b> <b>coping</b> strategies that concretely elicit positive emotions, such as benefit-finding and cognitive reappraisal, humor, optimism, and goal-directed problem-focused coping. Individuals who tend to approach problems with these methods of coping may strengthen their resistance to stress by allocating more access to these positive emotional resources. Social support from caring adults encouraged resilience among participants by providing them with access to conventional activities.|$|E
25|$|The {{more the}} {{internet}} is incorporated into daily life, the greater the impact it has on formal language. This {{is especially true in}} modern Language Arts classes through the use of smart phones, tablets, and social media. Students are exposed to the language of the internet more than ever, and as such, the grammatical structure and slang of the internet are bleeding into their formal writing. Full immersion into a language is always the best way to learn it. Mark Lester in his book Teaching Grammar and Usage states, “The biggest single problem that basic writers have in developing successful strategies <b>for</b> <b>coping</b> with errors is simply their lack of exposure to formal written English...We would think it absurd to expect a student to master a foreign language without extensive exposure to it.” Since students are immersed in internet language, that is the form and structure they are mirroring.|$|E
25|$|Ethiopia {{has been}} {{pioneering}} {{a program that}} has now {{become part of the}} World Bank's prescribed method <b>for</b> <b>coping</b> with a food crisis and had been seen by aid organizations as a model of how to best help hungry nations. Through the country's main food assistance program, the Productive Safety Net Program, Ethiopia has been giving rural residents who are chronically short of food, a chance to work for food or cash. Foreign aid organizations like the World Food Program were then able to buy food locally from surplus areas to distribute in areas with a shortage of food. Ethiopia been pioneering a program, and Brazil has established a recycling program for organic waste that benefits farmers, urban poor, and the city in general. City residents separate organic waste from their garbage, bag it, and then exchange it for fresh fruit and vegetables from local farmers. As a result, the country's waste is reduced and the urban poor get a steady supply of nutritious food.|$|E
40|$|Coping of beams {{is usually}} done {{in order to}} allow for {{clearance}} at connections, but doing so reduces the beams strength and makes it susceptible to local web buckling at the coped section. Due to this reduction of the beam's strength, it was of interest to reinforce the web at the coped end. Previous researchers have proposed several design recommendations <b>for</b> reinforcement of <b>coped</b> beams. Possible measures involves welding on endplates or use of bolted connections at the coped end, and provision of stiffeners at the coped region. In this thesis a numerical study on the coped beam's strength and behaviour is presented. Nonlinear finite element analyses have been conducted to predict the structural behaviour and capacities of coped beams with varying cope dimensions. The beam was strengthened by either restraining the coped end from lateral translation or by provision of stiffeners at the coped region. The effect of restraining the coped end depended on the <b>cope</b> dimensions. <b>For</b> <b>cope</b> length-to-reduced beam hight ratios lesser than 1 (c/h_ 0 = 1), the effect was negligible. Reinforcement in longitudinal direction only did not prevent the occurence of local web buckling, so that the recommended reinforcement details of the coped beam included a combination of stiffeners in both vertical and longitudinal direction for which the beam was able to develop the plastic moment capacity of the full beam section without any significant sideways rigid body movement of the longitudinal stiffeners. The proposed design recommendations considers the webs slenderness and <b>coped</b> dimensions. <b>For</b> <b>coped</b> beams with web depth-to-thickness ratios (h_w/t_w) {{less than or equal to}} 58 and cope length-to-reduced web hight ratios (c/h_ 0) less than one, longitudinal and vertical stiffeners were required while double vertical stiffeners were required <b>for</b> <b>cope</b> ratios equal to or more than 1. <b>For</b> <b>coped</b> beams with web depth-to-thickness ratio more than 58 and less than or equal to 67 and cope ratios less than or equal to 0. 5 vertical and longitudinal stiffeners were required, while double vertical stiffeners were required <b>for</b> <b>cope</b> ratios of more than 0. 5. </p...|$|R

25|$|The {{original}} North Dakota State Capitol building, built between 1883 and 1884, {{and expanded}} in 1894 (Senate wing) and 1903 (House wing), {{burned to the}} ground the morning of December 28, 1930. The fire was said to have been started by oily rags in a janitor's closet {{on the top floor of}} the main part of the building. The rags had been used to clean and varnish the legislators' desks in preparation for the upcoming legislative session. North Dakota Secretary of State Robert Byrne saved the original copy of the state's constitution, but he suffered cuts and burns on his hands while breaking a window to reach the document. Another state employee, Jennie Ulsrud, burned her hands when she attempted to save records in the North Dakota State Treasurer's office. Governor George F. Shafer came back from his visit to St. Paul, Minnesota while the fire was still burning. Upon arrival, he immediately assembled a team of state legislators and officials to discuss plans <b>for</b> <b>coping</b> with the loss of records and work space. The day after the fire, to save as many records as possible, 40 state prison inmates went to work trying to salvage materials from the ruins. The Legislature met temporarily in Bismarck's War Memorial Building and the City Auditorium.|$|E
500|$|According to the Life of William Marshal, {{which dates}} to soon after 1219, when word reached William Marshal, {{one of the}} richest and most {{influential}} barons, that Richard was dead, he consulted with Walter and discussed whom to support as the next king. Marshal's choice was John, but Walter initially leaned towards John's young nephew Arthur of Brittany. When Marshall was insistent on John, who was an adult, the author of the Life has Walter say in reply [...] " [...] 'So be it then,' said the archbishop, 'but mark my words, Marshal, you will never regret anything in your life as much as this.'" [...] This is almost certainly a retrospective comment that has been inserted into the biography, however, based on John's later behaviour. Once John knew he had the support of Walter and William Marshal, he sent Walter ahead to England to request all free men to pledge fealty to the new king. On 27 May 1199 Walter crowned John, supposedly making a speech that promulgated, for the last time, the theory of a king's election by the people. This story is only contained in the writings of Matthew Paris, however, and although it seems certain that Walter made a speech, it is not certain what the exact contents were. On his coronation day, John appointed Walter Lord Chancellor. W. L. Warren, historian and author of a biography of John, says of Walter that [...] "No one living had a firmer grasp of the intricacies of royal government, yet even in old age his mind was adaptable and fecund with suggestions <b>for</b> <b>coping</b> with new problems." ...|$|E

500|$|Despite Marsh's {{precautions}} against alerting {{his rival}} to Como Bluff's rich bone beds, {{word of the}} discoveries rapidly spread.
