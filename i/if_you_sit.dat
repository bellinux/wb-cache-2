500|$|In March 2004, Biden {{secured the}} brief release of Libyan {{democracy}} activist and political prisoner Fathi Eljahmi, {{after meeting with}} leader Muammar Gaddafi in Tripoli. [...] In May 2008, Biden sharply criticized President George W. Bush for his speech to Israel's Knesset in which he suggested that some Democrats were acting {{in the same way}} some Western leaders did when they appeased Hitler in the runup to World War II. Biden stated: [...] "This is bullshit. This is malarkey. This is outrageous. Outrageous {{for the president of the}} United States to go to a foreign country, sit in the Knesset ... and make this kind of ridiculous statement." [...] Biden later apologized for using the expletive. Biden further stated, [...] "Since when does this administration think that <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>sit</b> down, you have to eliminate the word 'no' from your vocabulary?" ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Behind that screen; I {{keep them}} in strict {{seclusion}} there. Now <b>if</b> <b>you</b> will <b>sit</b> down by the window I will bring the easels out." ...|$|R
5000|$|... "People {{will sit}} up and take notice of <b>you</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> will <b>sit</b> up and take notice of what makes them {{sit up and}} take notice." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I haven't been in {{the saloon}} at all yet," [...] Virginia said, [...] "but {{it would be very}} nice <b>if</b> <b>you</b> could <b>sit</b> somewhere near me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Now, old 'ooman, {{you turn}} in," [...] said Adams, when the small hours of morning had {{advanced}} a little. [...] "You'll only be {{unfit for work}} to-morrow <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>sit</b> up bobbin' about on your stool like that." ...|$|E
6000|$|Quite by chance, Dschemil {{happened}} to pass by, and seeing a man sitting there, {{full in the}} glare of the sun, he stopped, and said, 'Get up at once, Jew; you will have a sunstroke <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>sit</b> in such a place.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Mamma's never angry. I {{suppose she}} is {{waiting at the}} sea now while Papa gets tickets. We'll find them and go along with them. Ju, you must n't sit down. Only a little more and we'll come to the sea. Ju, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>sit</b> down I'll thmack you!" [...] said Punch.|$|E
6000|$|... "Not there!" [...] {{she cried}} quickly. [...] "Not on the mother's couch. But <b>if</b> <b>you</b> will <b>sit</b> here, {{it will be}} {{pleasant}} if I can sleep for a little while, resting on you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "My dear Miss O'Mahony, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> would <b>sit</b> {{down for}} a moment, I have a {{proposition}} to make to you. I {{think that it is}} one to which you may be induced to listen." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Very,' replied Dick. 'Nearly dead. You {{might have}} chanced {{to hear of}} your Richard on his bier, but for the friend I sent to fetch you. Another shake of the hand, Marchioness, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> please. <b>Sit</b> down, Sir.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "He speaks a {{good deal}} of himself to me," [...] said Mr. Neuchatel; [...] "and he is going to bring a friend here to-morrow who knows more about his affairs even than I do. So you will have a very good opportunity, Miss Ferrars, of making {{yourself}} acquainted with them, particularly <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>sit</b> next to him at dinner, and are very winning." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Don't make no {{difference}} to me," [...] answered the man; [...] "tea isn't malt liquor; it's poor stuff any way, and it doesn't matter to me whether it's got sugar in it or not, but it's moistenin', and that's what I want. Now, madam, I'll just say to you, if ever I break into a room where you're sleepin', I'll see that you don't come to no harm, even <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>sit</b> {{up in bed and}} holler." ...|$|E
60|$|Give them half an {{hour and}} they'll all settle down, sitting row upon row, tier upon tier of panting, {{expectant}} humanity. After much bousculading the strong ones have got to the front rows, the weaker ones up aloft in the rear. But all can see well into the arena, {{and there are those}} who think that you get a better view <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>sit</b> more aloft; certain it is that you get purer air and something of the shadow of the encircling walls.|$|E
6000|$|... "Now, Miss Dearborn," [...] said he, [...] "I {{have made}} the stern seat very wet, but I don't believe you will mind that, and <b>if</b> <b>you</b> will <b>sit</b> here I will take the oars and row you in." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, Major Mallett, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> will <b>sit</b> {{down and}} write the {{telegram}} with the description that you have given, I will send it off at once. Then, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> will call again in an hour's time, I have no doubt all the answers will have come in." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{must go back}} to {{town with}} you, Fan," [...] he returned. [...] "I will release your hand <b>if</b> <b>you</b> will <b>sit</b> down on this bench and let me speak to you. We must not part in this way." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Do see him, my dear," [...] {{she went}} on as Sophy shook her head, [...] "It will do you good; you are {{fretting}} yourself to death. Indeed, indeed, my dear, you are, {{and it is very}} wrong of you; what is to become of your little baby if you get ill, as I am sure you will, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>sit</b> here think, think, all day, without speaking a word to any one? Do see him, now there's a deary, it will do you good, indeed it will." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'And {{what is that}} to me?' {{shouted the}} brutal seaman. 'How can you arrive at your journey's end sound and hearty <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>sit</b> like a sick fowl upon a perch? Laugh, man, and be merry, or I will give you {{something}} to weep for. Out on you, you chicken-hearted swab, to sulk and fret like a babe new weaned! Have you not all that heart could desire? Give him a touch with the rope's-end, Jem, if ever you do observe him fretting. It is but to spite us that he doth it.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, it's {{just the}} same with you. Can't you see that? Think it over. What would {{you think of a}} {{lieutenant}} that tried to boss all the generals? Just same thing.... Besides, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>sit</b> tight, you can make the team this year, I can practically promise you that. Do understand this now; it isn't a bribe; we want you {{to be able to play}} and do something for old Plato in a real way--in athletics. But you most certainly can't make the team if you're going to be a disorganizer." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{have had}} a meal cooked, which I hope you will eat with us. It is the last {{you are likely to}} be able to enjoy, for some time. We shall feel honoured <b>if</b> <b>you</b> will <b>sit</b> down with us." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh! it is Anthony's coat tails. Just look, {{they are}} turning quite brown. Why, Anthony, {{you must be}} as beautifully done as the beef. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> can <b>sit</b> there and say nothing, you are a Christian martyr wasted, that's all." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Indeed," [...] {{said his}} mother, [...] "you will be {{instantly}} well, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> will <b>sit</b> down {{for half an}} hour--but half an hour. It is eight hours to dawn, and dawn were time enough for your father's son to begin such a journey." ...|$|R
60|$|By {{the light}} thus given the room stood revealed, an eyrie, encased {{on all sides}} except the one of {{approach}} by shoji only. Into these had been let a belt of glass eighteen inches wide all the way round the room, at the height at which a person sitting on the mats could see out. It is much the fashion now thus to graft a Western window upon a Far-Eastern wall. The idea is ingenious and economical, and has but two drawbacks,--that you feel excessively indoors if you stand up, and strangely out-of-doors <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>sit</b> down.|$|E
6000|$|... "Now, Mr. Atherton, you {{had better}} seat {{yourself}} in that great deck-chair of yours with the leg-rest. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>sit</b> there quietly reading when they come on board they {{are not likely to}} suspect you of being a desperate character, or to appreciate your inches and width of shoulder. Allen had better sit quiet till they get alongside, and then slip that sling into his pocket and walk up and down talking to one of the ladies, with his thumb in his waistcoat so as to support his arm. He looks pale and shaky; but they are not accustomed to much colour here, and he will pass well enough." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "On the contrary, it signifies everything. After {{this great}} Tory {{reaction}} {{there is nothing}} to be done now by speeches, and, in all probability, very little that can be effectually opposed. Much, therefore, depends upon where you sit. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>sit</b> on the Mountain, the public imagination will be attracted to you, and when they are aggrieved, which they will be in good time, the public passion, which is called opinion, will look to you for representation. My advice to my friends now is to sit together and say nothing, but to profess through the press the most advanced opinions. We sit on the back bench of the gangway, and we call ourselves the Mountain." ...|$|E
60|$|ZOO [loudly] Yes, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> want to. You {{can stand}} {{on your head}} <b>if</b> <b>you</b> like. [She <b>sits</b> down {{carelessly}} on the gallery railing, {{with her back to}} the abyss].|$|R
6000|$|... "Very well," [...] Abijah said. [...] "I {{will do as}} {{you want}} me, 'm, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> will <b>sit</b> down quiet and not excite {{yourself}}. You know {{you have not been}} out of your room for a year, and <b>if</b> <b>you</b> go a-tiring yourself like this you {{will never be able to}} stand the journey. <b>You</b> <b>sit</b> down in the chair and I will do the packing for you. You can tell me what things you will take with you. I will get the box down." ...|$|R
6000|$|... “I {{never go}} back upon {{anything}} my daughter says, but I don’t know that I’m sorry we shall not be honored with the company of any more of the Sin Verguenza,” he said. “We have ordered comida, and should be pleased <b>if</b> <b>you</b> will <b>sit</b> down with us.” ...|$|R
6000|$|Human {{character}} evermore publishes itself. The most fugitive deed and word, {{the mere}} air {{of doing a}} thing, the intimated purpose, expresses character. If you act you show character; <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>sit</b> still, if you sleep, you show it. You think because you have spoken nothing when others spoke, and have given no opinion on the times, on the church, on slavery, on marriage, on socialism, on secret societies, on the college, on parties and persons, that your verdict is still expected with curiosity as a reserved wisdom. Far otherwise; your silence answers very loud. You have no oracle to utter, and your fellow-men have learned that you cannot help them; for oracles speak. Doth not Wisdom cry and Understanding put forth her voice? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "If you cry out or {{make the}} {{slightest}} sound," [...] Fergus said, showing his knife, [...] "you are all dead men. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>sit</b> quiet and do as we order you, no harm {{will come to}} you. We want clothes. If you have spare ones you can hand them to us. If not, we must take those you have on. We are not robbers, and don't want to steal them. If you will fix a fair price on the things, we will pay for them. But you must in any case submit to be bound and gagged till morning; when, on going on deck, you will find no difficulty in attracting the attention of some of your comrades, who will at once release you.|$|E
6000|$|From one {{she would}} copy and {{practice}} a gesture, from another an eloquent lifting of an eyebrow, from others, {{a manner of}} walking, of carrying a purse, of smiling, of greeting a friend, of addressing [...] "inferiors in station." [...] From her best beloved model, Mrs. Van Alstyne Fisher, she made requisition for that excellent thing, a soft, low voice as clear as silver and as perfect in articulation as the notes of a thrush. Suffused in the aura of this high social refinement and good breeding, {{it was impossible for}} her to escape a deeper effect of it. As good habits are said to be better than good principles, so, perhaps, good manners are better than good habits. The teachings of your parents may not keep alive your New England conscience; but <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>sit</b> on a straight-back chair and repeat the words [...] "prisms and pilgrims" [...] forty times the devil will flee from you. And when Nancy spoke in the Van Alstyne Fisher tones she felt the thrill of noblesse oblige to her very bones.|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't {{know what}} to think of it, Mr. Lacy," [...] was the slow reply. [...] "I have not yet had an {{opportunity}} to interview the two Rovers. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> will <b>sit</b> down here in my office, I'll talk to them and try to settle this matter with you." ...|$|R
6000|$|Hemphill, who {{had been}} smiling mildly at the kick-shin proposition, now turned himself about. [...] "You will not do that," [...] he said, [...] "and <b>if</b> <b>you</b> don't <b>sit</b> quiet and keep your mouth shut, I'll toss you out of this cart, and make you walk {{the rest of the}} way to the station." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Sit down, Mr. Wyatt," [...] {{replied the}} captain, {{somewhat}} sternly, [...] "you will capsize us <b>if</b> <b>you</b> do not <b>sit</b> quite still. Our gunwhale is almost {{in the water}} now." ...|$|R
