5|$|The United States {{reinstated}} {{sanctions against}} Yugoslavia in March 1998 when the Kosovo War started. Shortly after the controversies at Račak and Rambouillet, American diplomat Richard Holbrooke traveled to Belgrade in March 1999 {{to deliver the}} final ultimatum requesting entry of UN forces into Kosovo. Milošević rejected the ultimatum, so the United States completely severed ties with Yugoslavia on March 23, 1999. Bill Clinton became the first president to declare war while bypassing a Congressional majority. The establishment of the bombing campaign was contested {{by one of the}} tightest votings (213-213) in the entire history of the House of Representatives. The United States declared war on Yugoslavia on March 24, 1999 to take part in Operation Allied Force led by U.S. <b>general</b> <b>Wesley</b> <b>Clark.</b> Out of all the territories in Yugoslavia at the time, Serbia was bombed the most due to its concentration of military targets. As a result of Slobodan Milošević granting entry to KFOR in Kosovo, the war against Yugoslavia ceased on June 10, 1999.|$|E

500|$|In 1994, Jackson {{served his}} first {{tour in the}} Balkans, where he {{commanded}} a multi-national division of the Implementation Force. Following a staff job back in the UK, he was appointed commander of NATO's Allied Rapid Reaction Corps (ARRC) in 1997. He returned to the Balkans with the ARRC during the Kosovo War, during which he famously refused to obey an order from American <b>General</b> <b>Wesley</b> <b>Clark,</b> his immediate superior in the NATO chain of command, to block the runways of Pristina Airport and isolate the Russian contingent that was positioned there. He reportedly told Clark, [...] "I'm not going to start the Third World War for you". The incident attracted controversy, particularly in the United States, and earned Jackson the nickname [...] "Macho Jacko" [...] in the British tabloid press. Jackson established a working relationship with the Russian general commanding the detachment at Pristina, giving him a bottle of whisky, of which Jackson {{is known to be}} fond, and providing the Russians with the protection of a squad of British soldiers, commanded by his son, Mark.|$|E
500|$|To {{stop the}} ethnic {{cleansing}} and genocide of Albanians by anti-guerilla military {{units in the}} former Federal Republic of Yugoslavia's province of Kosovo, Clinton authorized the use of U.S. Armed Forces in a NATO bombing campaign against Yugoslavia in 1999, named Operation Allied Force. <b>General</b> <b>Wesley</b> <b>Clark</b> was Supreme Allied Commander of NATO and oversaw the mission. With United Nations Security Council Resolution 1244, the bombing campaign ended on June 10, 1999. The resolution placed Kosovo under UN administration and authorized a peacekeeping force to be deployed to the region. NATO announced that its forces had suffered zero combat deaths, and two deaths from an Apache helicopter crash. Opinions in the popular press criticized pre-war genocide statements by the Clinton administration as greatly exaggerated. In 2001, the U.N.-supervised Supreme Court of Kosovo ruled that genocide did not take place, but recognized [...] "a systematic campaign of terror, including murders, rapes, arsons and severe maltreatments". The term [...] "ethnic cleansing" [...] {{was used as an}} alternative to [...] "genocide" [...] to denote not just ethnically motivated murder but also displacement, though critics charge there is no difference. Slobodan Milošević, the president of Yugoslavia {{at the time of the}} atrocities, was eventually brought to trial before the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia in the Hague on charges of crimes against humanity, genocide, and war crimes. Milošević died in 2006, before the completion of the trial.|$|E
500|$|After he was {{appointed}} Commander of NATO's Allied Rapid Reaction Corps (ARRC), Jackson was promoted to acting lieutenant general in January 1997, a rank he was granted substantively in April 1997. Jackson served in the NATO chain of command, reporting to the Supreme Allied Commander Europe, American four-star <b>General</b> <b>Wesley</b> <b>Clark.</b> Under Jackson's command, the ARRC deployed to Bosnia and Herzegovina in March 1999, where Jackson served his second {{tour of duty in}} the Balkans, commanding KFOR, NATO's multi-national peacekeeping force established {{at the end of the}} Kosovo War. He gained significant media attention in June 1999 after a confrontation with Clark in which he refused to block the runways of the Russian-occupied Pristina Airport and isolate the Russian troops there, thus preventing them from flying in reinforcements, after the order was queried by Captain James Blount. In one heated discussion with Clark, Jackson reputedly told him [...] "I'm not going to start the Third World War for you". He later told the BBC he believed that obeying the order would have led to the possibility of an armed confrontation with Russian troops, which he felt was not [...] "the right way to start off a relationship with Russians". The point became moot when the US government prevailed upon neighbouring countries, including Hungary and Romania, to prevent Russian use of their airspace to fly in reinforcements. Jackson was criticised for his actions by American military officers and politicians, including General Hugh Shelton, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, who called the incident [...] "troubling", and Senator John Warner, who accused Jackson of insubordination.|$|E

5000|$|By {{the first}} week of July 2004, pundits and those close to the Kerry {{campaign}} indicated that the vice-presidential selection had narrowed to five potential choices: U.S. Sen. John R. Edwards (N.C.), Ret. <b>General</b> <b>Wesley</b> K. <b>Clark</b> (Ar.), U.S. Rep. Richard A. [...] "Dick" [...] Gephardt (Mo.), U.S. Sen. Bob Graham (Fl.), and Iowa Gov. Thomas J. Vilsack, all of whom were reportedly instructed to clear their calendars for a potential announcement during the second week of July. Edwards, from North Carolina, Graham, from Florida, and Clark from Arkansas all were Southerners; the other two, from Missouri and Iowa respectively, are Midwesterners (the Midwest is viewed as a key region containing numerous swing states). As of late June, the charismatic Edwards was the first choice of Democratic voters, according to several polls; some pundits attributed this to high name recognition, due to his runner-up status in the primaries.|$|R
2500|$|Resnicoff is {{frequently}} quoted {{on the impact}} of war and violence on the human spirit, including the distinction he makes between [...] "outrage", a feeling we must value, because it is part of being human (and we must fight against the danger that war and violence can numb us against it), and [...] "rage", where emotions take over, we lose our moral compass, and we become vulnerable to manipulation by others who want us to lose our way. [...] While working for <b>General</b> <b>Wesley</b> K. <b>Clark</b> at the U.S. European Command, Resnicoff worked to expand the concept of force protection to include Spiritual Force Protection: protecting military personnel not only against physical danger, but against threats to their humanity, as well.

2500|$|Potential {{ground attack}} – <b>General</b> <b>Wesley</b> <b>Clark,</b> Supreme Allied Commander Europe, was [...] "convinced" [...] that {{planning}} and preparations for ground intervention [...] "in particular, pushed Milošević to concede". [...] The Yugoslav capitulation {{occurred on the}} same day that U.S. President Bill Clinton held a widely publicised meeting with his four service chiefs to discuss options for a ground-force deployment in case the air war failed. However, France and Germany vigorously opposed a ground offensive, and had done so for some weeks, since April 1999. French estimates suggested that an invasion would need an army of 500,000 to achieve success. This left NATO, particularly the United States, with a clear view that a land operation had no support. With this in mind, the Americans reaffirmed their faith in the air campaign. The reluctance of NATO to use ground forces casts serious doubt on the idea that Milošević capitulated out of fear of a land invasion.|$|E
