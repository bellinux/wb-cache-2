5|$|The square-windowed Comet 1 was {{the first}} model produced, a total of 12 {{aircraft}} in service and test. Following closely the design features of the two prototypes, the only noticeable change was the adoption of <b>four-wheel</b> <b>bogie</b> main undercarriage units, replacing the single main wheels. Four Ghost 50 Mk 1 engines were fitted (later replaced by more powerful Ghost DGT3 series engines). The span was 115ft (35.05m), and overall length 93ft (28.35m); the maximum takeoff weight was over 105,000lb (47.628kg) and over 40 passengers could be carried.|$|E

50|$|The Boeing 747 {{has five}} sets of wheels: a {{nosewheel}} assembly and {{four sets of}} four-wheel bogies. A set is located under each wing, and two inner sets {{are located in the}} fuselage, a little rearward of the outer bogies, adding up to a total of eighteen wheels and tires. The Airbus A380 also has a <b>four-wheel</b> <b>bogie</b> under each wing with two sets of six-wheel bogies under the fuselage.|$|E
50|$|During {{rebuilding}} in 1931, {{a modified}} standard gauge G6S boiler was installed; this was 7 ft longer and 6¾in greater in diameter {{than the original}} and had a working pressure of 200psi. To accommodate this, the overall length of the locomotive was increased by slightly less than four feet. The trailing radial truck was replaced by <b>four-wheel</b> <b>bogie</b> and a rear bunker was fitted which held {{one and a half}} tons of coal. The weight was increased by 10¼ tons.|$|E
50|$|Underneath, the {{locomotive}} was supported on two swivelling powered bogies (US: trucks), with all wheels driven; smaller locomotives had <b>four-wheel</b> <b>bogies,</b> while larger had six-wheel. The cylinders on each power bogie pointed outward, towards {{the locomotive}} ends. Couplers and buffers (where fitted) were {{mounted on the}} bogies, not on the locomotive frame, so that they swivelled with the curvature of the track.|$|R
50|$|At {{any rate}} the 15 cm guns were mounted in a well-base flatcar with two <b>four-wheel</b> <b>bogies.</b> No {{outriggers}} were fitted so the recoil energy from shots fired {{perpendicular to the}} railroad track could rock the flatcar significantly even with it chained to the ground. They were fitted with front and side gunshields, although, oddly enough, no overhead armor was fitted. They first saw service in 1918 and {{appear to have been}} mainly used for coastal defense duties.|$|R
50|$|Most coaches ran on two <b>four-wheel</b> <b>bogies</b> {{which were}} of a 9 ft 0 in {{wheelbase}} single bolster design which hardly changed {{for the whole of}} the company's life. Some special vehicles ran on twelve wheel chassis and the six-wheel bogie on these vehicles was of 12 ft 6 in wheel-base, based on the London and North Western Railway design. All coaches except kitchen cars were electrically lit and normally fitted with vacuum brake as standard.|$|R

50|$|The first {{trolleybus}} system connected Poprad with Starý Smokovec from 1904 to 1906. The second trolleybus {{system was}} built in 1909 in Bratislava, but served only until 1915. The route led to the hilly recreational area of Železná studienka and the trolleybuses' motors were fed by a <b>four-wheel</b> <b>bogie</b> running {{on top of the}} wires and connected to the vehicle by a cable. Trolleybuses in Bratislava were reintroduced in 1941, with standard trolley poles. In 1962 trolleybuses were introduced in Prešov. Banská Bystrica introduced trolleybuses in 1989, Košice in 1993 and Žilina in 1994. All trolleybuses were made by Škoda.|$|E
5000|$|In 1929, the ten [...] gauge South Australian Railways 500 class 4-8-2 Mountain {{types of}} 1926 were {{equipped}} with steam boosters {{in the form}} of small auxiliary steam engines to increase their power. This necessitated the replacement of their two-wheel trailing trucks with <b>four-wheel</b> <b>bogies.</b> The booster contributed an additional 8000 lbf kN to the tractive effort and permitted an increase in the locomotive’s load across the Mount Lofty Ranges to 540 tons. In their new 4-8-4 configuration, they were reclassified to 500B class.|$|R
5000|$|The {{locomotive}} {{sold in the}} US {{was ordered}} for the newly built Denver and Rio Grande Railroad in 1872, and was named the [...] "Mountaineer". This was a smaller locomotive with <b>four-wheel</b> <b>bogies,</b> giving it a 0-4-4-0 configuration. The railroad's experience with the locomotive was typical, and {{an indication of the}} fact that, though Fairlie had eliminated several problems of the conventional locomotive, he had introduced new ones of his own. At least one double Fairlie 0-6-6-0 (pictured above) was built by the Mason Machine Works in Taunton, Massachusetts.|$|R
2500|$|Airbus {{devised a}} three-pronged main {{undercarriage}} design philosophy encompassing both four- and six-wheel bogies to ensure it {{can keep the}} pavement loading within limits.

5000|$|The G {{class were}} {{ordered by the}} Canterbury Provincial Council. They were derived from the F class, {{replacing}} {{the first of the}} three driving axles with a <b>four-wheel</b> <b>bogie.</b> It was hoped that the reduced rigid wheelbase would allow the locomotive to provide higher speed passenger services. The type suffered from lack of weight on the driving axles, a driver stating that [...] "it took the 'G' all its time to push its front bogie along, let alone pull a load". They were followed by the L Class which were a more successful attempt to produce a faster F Class.|$|E
50|$|The XB-36 {{featured}} a single-wheel {{main landing gear}} whose tires were the largest ever manufactured up to that time, 9 ft tall, 3 ft wide, and weighing 1320 lb, with enough rubber for 60 automobile tires.

50|$|When the A340-500 was introduced, {{it was the}} world's longest-range {{commercial}} airliner. It first flew on 11 February 2002, and was certified on 3 December 2002. Air Canada {{was supposed}} to be the launch customer, but filed for bankruptcy in January 2003, delaying delivery to March. This allowed early deliveries to the new launch customer, Emirates, allowing the carrier to launch nonstop service from Dubai to New York—its first route in the Americas. The A340-500 can fly 313 passengers in a three-class cabin layout over 16020 km (8650 nm). Compared with the A340-300, the -500 features a 4.3 m fuselage stretch, an enlarged wing, significant increase in fuel capacity (around 50% over the -300), slightly higher cruising speed, a larger horizontal stabilizer and a larger vertical tailplane. The centerline main landing gear was changed to a <b>four-wheel</b> <b>bogie</b> to support additional weight. The A340-500 is powered by four 240 kN thrust Rolls-Royce Trent 553 turbofans and uses the Honeywell 331-600A APU.|$|E
2500|$|As an example, {{a typical}} modern wagon can {{hold up to}} [...] of freight on two <b>four-wheel</b> <b>bogies.</b> The track {{distributes}} {{the weight of the}} train evenly, allowing significantly greater loads per axle and wheel than in road transport, leading to less wear and tear on the permanent way. This can save energy compared with other forms of transport, such as road transport, which depends on the friction between rubber tyres and the road. Trains have a small frontal area in relation to the load they are carrying, which reduces air resistance and thus energy usage.|$|R
5000|$|Structurally it is {{generally}} an American design in its features, with the first dome being a sandbox, and the second being for steam. The firebox is located above the trailing axle. After the first 27 were completed, the design was modified, resulting {{in a slightly different}} appearance of the smokestack and the steam dome. The tender was made bigger at the same time, with coal capacity rising from 11 t to 12 t, and water capacity increasing from [...] to [...] The tender is a four-axle type, running on two <b>four-wheel</b> <b>bogies</b> of American Bettendorf design.|$|R

5000|$|... "Galloping Goose" [...] motor rail buses {{kept the}} Rio Grande Southern {{railroad}} viable from the 1930s by carrying mail {{until they were}} used to scrap their own line in 1953. Knott also purchased this efficient and unique rail vehicle, the RGS Motor #3, which soldiers on at the GT&C on quieter days during the off-season - serving its original purpose when patronage does not justify hostling a steam engine to pull an entire train. It is [...] "kitbashed" [...] from its original Pierce-Arrow limousine frame, engine, radiator, cowling and body which was converted to rail use by replacing the front axle with a <b>four-wheel</b> <b>bogie</b> truck and fitting the rear axle with flanged wheels at first, then a bogie truck which linked the powered axle to its mate with a chain drive. A RGS shop-built freight box (converted with trolley seats for passenger service in 1950) articulates on the kingpin over the chain driven center truck. The wooden limousine sedan body was replaced after World War II with a 1939 Wayne military-surplus bus body with both left and right doors. Its Pierce-Arrow gasoline engine has been replaced, first with a war-surplus GMC gasoline engine at the RGS, then at Knott's with first a war-surplus in-line 6 cylinder Diamond-Reo gasoline engine, and since 1997 with a Cummins Diesel engine supported with an I-beam frame extension salvaged from the demolished Windjammer Surf Racers roller coaster.|$|E
40|$|The major {{features}} and {{physics of the}} aerodynamic interactions between various main components of a generic four-wheel landing gear are studied. The study was conducted {{as a part of}} the UK ATI ALGAAP (Advanced Landing Gear Aero-loads and Aero-noise Prediction) project. Delayed Detached-Eddy Simulations with the Spalart-Allmaras turbulence model with fixed laminar-turbulent transition are performed to compare three configurations of landing-gear components. The wheel geometry is the same as in the tandem-wheel configuration that was previously studied for the ALGAAP project. For this geometry both simulations and experiments are available for validation and comparison with the current results on the <b>four-wheel</b> <b>bogie.</b> The effect of the fixed transition are also assessed on the four-wheel geometry and compared with the tandem wheels. The results show strong effects of the axles and the bogie beam on the low past the wheels. The axles generate a wide low-pressure wake in the aft part of the front wheels, which increases the mean drag coefficient of the front wheels. The flow features observed on the three configurations show some similarities with the flow features that were reported on tandem wheels, with a few differences. Adding axles and bogie beam increases the mean drag significantly on the front wheels, and slightly on the downstream wheels. Adding a main strut reduces the mean drag of the downstream wheels, but the mean drag of the front wheels slightly increases. A similar trend is seen with the RMS. The effect of the fixed transition in the four-wheel case is important in order to capture the transitional ow features but does not show an effect on the mean force coefficients as strong as on the tandem wheels...|$|E
40|$|This {{program has}} involved, first of all, a {{critical}} state-of-the-art assessment of vortex-body interactions. Then, efforts {{were focused on}} experimental investigation on coupled-wake instabilities and turbulence occurring in a two-cylinder system. An extensive review was undertaken {{on the effect of}} incident vortices on various types of bodies. These incident vortices have a length scale of the same order of magnitude as the scale of the body. The body can take on various forms, including, for example, a circular cylinder, a blade or a wing. The classes of vortex-body interaction that were critically assessed include: (1) Periodic distortion of the incident (primary) vortex and shedding of secondary vorticity {{from the surface of the}} body. (2) Modulated vortex distortion and shedding at a leading-edge or surface due to incidence of a complex system of vortices. (3) Vortex distortion and shedding in presence of body oscillation. (4) Three-dimensional vortex interaction and shedding. For all of these classes of vortex-body interaction, quantitative topologies of the vorticity distributions and streamline patterns were found to be central to a unified description of mechanisms of vortex distortion and shedding. In most cases, it was possible to define relationships between vortex interactions and unsteady loading at the body surface. This phase of the program was an experimental investigation of a two-cylinder system, which simulated a central aspect of a <b>four-wheel</b> <b>bogie</b> on a large-scale commercial aircraft. The overall aim of this experimental research program was to determine the crucial elements of the unsteadiness in the gap and near-wake regions as a function of time using cinema-based techniques. During the research program, various image evaluation techniques were employed. They involved assessment of instantaneous velocity fields, streamline topology and patterns of vorticity. Experiments were performed in a large-scale water channel using a high-resolution version of digital particle image velocimetry. The program has focused on acquisition of images of velocity and vorticity for varying gap widths between the two-cylinder system. As a result of analysis of a relatively large number of images, it is demonstrated that low frequency instabilities can occur in the gap region between the cylinder. These low frequency instabilities are hypothesized to influence the near-wake structure of the entire two-cylinder system. The nature of the unstable shear layers in the gap region involves generation of small-scale Kelvin-Helmholtz instabilities. These unsteady shear layers then impinge upon the upper and lower surfaces of the cylinders, thereby influencing both the unsteady structure and the time-averaged patterns of the near-wake. Initial efforts have focused on characterization of the patterns of instantaneous and averaged streamlines using topological concepts. The end result of this investigation is a series of documented instantaneous images. They will serve as a basis for various types of post-processing, which will lead to a fuller understanding of the instantaneous and time-averaged unstable-turbulent fields in the gap region and downstream of the two-cylinder system. This further assessment is the focus of a subsequent program...|$|E
50|$|All of {{the fleet}} were built with four-wheel vertical-boiler power units and a <b>four-wheel</b> {{trailing}} <b>bogie</b> under the carriage. Driving wheels were from 3 ft to 4 ft; cylinders were from 9 x 15 in to 12 x 16 in.|$|R
25|$|The Sperrin was {{equipped}} with a tricycle undercarriage arrangement (a twin-wheel nosewheel {{and a pair of}} <b>four-wheel</b> <b>bogies),</b> in which the nose gear would retract backward and the main gear into the wings towards the fuselage. A safety circuit was present to prevent retraction of the landing gear until a sufficient air speed had been attained. Unusually, the landing gear was steerable, the Sperrin being one of the first British aircraft to be fitted with this feature; operation of the landing gear, along with various other pieces of onboard equipment, was achieved via the onboard Messier hydraulic system. A 24/28-volt DC electrical network was present to power onboard equipment; both of the electrical generators as well as the air pressure of the cabin was maintained by a supercharger driven by two accessory gearboxes that were housed within the wings.|$|R
