40|$|As {{a common}} task in modern {{applications}} users need to enter, edit or browse large, complex, maybe even recursive data structures. Many users prefer form based user interfaces. The form fillin interface style (Szekely 1998) is in widespread use e. g. for database queries, e-commerce orders etc. and exploits the user's {{familiarity with the}} paper equivalent. Many use cases are cumbersome on actual paper forms (e. g. “fill in lines 7 - 9 only <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>answered</b> yes to question 6, proceed to 10 <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>answered</b> no”) but can be handled quite elegantly with electronic forms by displaying relevant sections only- depending on the users former input. Those forms are called adaptive (Frank and Szekely 1998) or dynamic (Girgensohn, Zimmermann et al. 1995). Coding adaptive forms by hand or implementing them with a layout based development tool can grow rather expensive for large and more complex data structures. This paper focuses on how the development of adaptive form based user interfaces can be supported by the automatic code generation tool FormGen...|$|E
