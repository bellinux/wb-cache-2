5|$|One {{criticism}} of the practice holds that the manager has enough to be preoccupied with during a game without playing. With specialized bullpens, extensive scouting reports, and increased media scrutiny, the <b>job</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> manager has become more complex. A player–manager needs to decide how much playing time to give himself. Don Kessinger, player–manager of the Chicago White Sox in 1979, believes he did not play himself enough. Additionally, Bill Terry felt he became isolated from his team {{when he became a}} player–manager.|$|E
5|$|Once a kit {{has reached}} six moons old, they become ‘{{apprentice}}s’. As {{a mark of}} this, each kit is now given the suffix ‘paw’. For example, ‘Graykit’ would become ‘Graypaw’. An apprentice is then assigned to a ‘mentor’. Mentors are often carefully chosen {{in order to fulfill}} an apprentice’s full potential; for example, a rather highly-strung apprentice would be given to a calmer mentor, whilst a more timid apprentice would be given to a mentor known for their bravery. It is the <b>job</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> mentor to train their apprentice for any given situation, teaching them to hunt, fight, and patrol borders. Apprentices move out of the nursery and sleep in their own separate den. In addition to training, apprentices are also tasked with keeping the camp clean.|$|E

The players Wenger recruits {{have often been}} criticised for their character and leadership capabilities; footballer Joey Barton suggested {{it was because the}} manager discouraged them from commanding: [...] "Sometimes you need someone to galvanise and that might be a shouter and bawler.

Wenger is perceived as frugal given his inactivity in transfer windows, but he has denied the stereotype: [...] "Of course people say always to buy but you cannot make careers [...] buy every time you have an injured player.

500|$|Brisco {{was criticized}} early {{on for the}} {{violence}} it portrayed; meant to be comical, a scene in the pilot in which four villains accidentally kill {{each other in a}} crossfire troubled critics instead. Cuse insisted that the show was still appropriate for children, saying, [...] "I think we're very conscious of violence and I think we've made an effort to avoid violence in the pilot and in the future episodes". Halfway through the season, U.S. Senator Byron Dorgan singled out Brisco as the most violent show on television based on a study at Minnesota's Concordia University, in which students watched 132 hours of network and cable programming, during the week of September 28 to October 4, 1993. The students tallied each act of violence, and found that Brisco had 117 violent acts per hour. The study deemed Brisco more violent than the film Beverly Hills Cop, which was also viewed for the study. Cuse called the criticism [...] "patently ridiculous", noting that only one episode of the show was viewed, in which a boxing match takes place. Each punch and jab was counted as an act of violence. Cuse spoke out against legislation to curb television violence, saying that politicians were [...] "chasing a false objective". He said it was the <b>job</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> show's producer to control the moral content of a television program and the parents' duty to monitor what their children watch.|$|E

60|$|I shall only {{trouble you}} with a few {{particulars}} relative to the wretched state of this country. Our markets are exceedingly high; oatmeal 17d. and 18d. per peck, {{and not to be}} got even at that price. We have indeed been pretty well supplied with quantities of white peas from England and elsewhere, but that resource is likely to fail us, and what will become of us then, particularly the very poorest sort, Heaven only knows. This country, till of late, was flourishing incredibly in the manufacture of silk, lawn, and carpet-weaving; and we are still carrying on a good deal in that way, but much reduced from what it was. We had also a fine trade in the shoe way, but now entirely ruined, and hundreds driven to a starving condition on account of it. Farming is also at a very low ebb with us. Our lands, generally speaking, are mountainous and barren; and our land-holders, full of ideas of farming gathered from the English and the Lothians, and other rich soils in Scotland, make no allowance for the odds of the quality of land, and consequently stretch us much beyond what in the event we will be found able to pay. We are also much at a loss for want of proper methods in our improvements of farming. Necessity compels us to leave our old schemes, and few of us have opportunities of being well informed in new ones. In short, my dear Sir, since the unfortunate beginning of this American war, and its as unfortunate conclusion, this country has been, and still is, decaying very fast. Even in higher life, a couple of Ayrshire noblemen, and the major part of our knights and squires, are all insolvent. A miserable <b>job</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> Douglas, Heron & Co.'s bank, which no doubt you have heard of, has undone numbers of them; and imitating English and French, and other foreign luxuries and fopperies, has ruined as many more. There is a great trade of smuggling carried on along our coasts, which, however destructive to the interests of the kingdom at large, certainly enriches this corner of it, but too often at the expense of our morals. However, it enables individuals to make, at least for a time, a splendid appearance; but Fortune, as is usual with her when she is uncommonly lavish of her favours, is generally even with them at last; and happy were it for numbers of them if she would leave them no worse than when she found them.|$|E
