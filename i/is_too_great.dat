5|$|Bahá'í teachings {{state that}} God <b>is</b> <b>too</b> <b>great</b> {{for humans to}} fully comprehend, or to create a {{complete}} and accurate image of, by themselves. Therefore, human understanding of God is achieved through his revelations via his Manifestations. In the Bahá'í religion, God {{is often referred to}} by titles and attributes (for example, the All-Powerful, or the All-Loving), and there is a substantial emphasis on monotheism; such doctrines as the Trinity are seen as compromising, if not contradicting, the Bahá'í view that God is single and has no equal. The Bahá'í teachings state that the attributes which are applied to God are used to translate Godliness into human terms and also to help individuals concentrate on their own attributes in worshipping God to develop their potentialities on their spiritual path. According to the Bahá'í teachings the human purpose is to learn to know and love God through such methods as prayer, reflection, and being of service to others.|$|E
5|$|Parliamentary {{sovereignty}} {{means that}} Parliament can, if it chooses, legislate contrary to fundamental principles of human rights. The Human Rights Act 1998 will not detract from this power. The constraints upon its exercise by Parliament are ultimately political, not legal. But {{the principle of}} legality means that Parliament must squarely confront what it is doing and accept the political cost. Fundamental rights cannot be overridden by general or ambiguous words. This is because there <b>is</b> <b>too</b> <b>great</b> a risk that the full implications of their unqualified meaning may have passed unnoticed in the democratic process. In the absence of express language or necessary implication to the contrary, the courts therefore presume {{that even the most}} general words were intended to be subject to the basic rights of the individual. In this way the courts of the United Kingdom, though acknowledging the sovereignty of Parliament, apply principles of constitutionality little different from those which exist in countries where the power of the legislature is expressly limited by a constitutional document.|$|E
5|$|The Enterprise {{receives}} a distress signal from a shuttlecraft returning Deanna Troi from a conference. They {{find that the}} shuttle has crashed on a desolate planet, Vagra II, and while they can find the life signs of Troi and the pilot, {{they are unable to}} beam the two to the ship. An away team beams down and discovers an animated pool of a tar-like substance, a malevolent life form that calls itself Armus. When Lt. Yar attempts to approach the shuttle, Armus hurls her back with a psychokinetic blast, killing her instantly. The away team is brought back to the Enterprise but the damage to Yar <b>is</b> <b>too</b> <b>great</b> for Dr. Crusher (Gates McFadden) to repair, and they are unable to resuscitate her. A second away team is sent to the planet. Armus taunts the crew members and maintains his grasp of the shuttle. During this time, Troi has communicated with Armus and learned that it is a physical manifestation of evil from the bodies of an ancient race, abandoned on Vagra II.|$|E

5|$|The {{government}} agents arrive, {{revealing that}} Douchebag went into hiding to escape {{them because of}} his ability to quickly make friends on social networks such as Facebook, which the government wanted to use for its own ends. Learning of the Stick's supposed power, the chief agent takes it and bargains with Douchebag to help him use it. Douchebag refuses but Princess Kenny betrays the group, uses the Stick to fight them and infects himself with the Nazi Zombie virus. Unable to defeat Nazi Zombie Princess Kenny, Cartman tells Douchebag to break their sacred rule by farting on Kenny's balls, which he does. The resulting explosion defeats Kenny and cures the town of the Nazi Zombie virus. In the epilogue as South Park is rebuilt, the group retrieves the Stick of Truth; they decide its power <b>is</b> <b>too</b> <b>great</b> for any person to hold and throw it into Stark's Pond.|$|E

25|$|Thus far, the {{required}} velocity (delta-v) to achieve orbit has been unattainable by any single rocket because the propellant, tankage, structure, guidance, valves and engines and so on, take a particular minimum percentage of take-off mass that <b>is</b> <b>too</b> <b>great</b> for the propellant it carries {{to achieve that}} delta-v. Since Single-stage-to-orbit has {{so far not been}} achievable, orbital rockets always have more than one stage.|$|E
25|$|In {{species or}} {{population}} analysis, {{for example in}} conservation work, PCR primers which amplify microsatellites in one individual or species can work in other species. However, the risk of applying PCR primers across different species is that null alleles become likely, whenever sequence divergence <b>is</b> <b>too</b> <b>great</b> for the primers to bind. The species may then artificially {{appear to have a}} reduced diversity. Null alleles in this case can sometimes be indicated by an excessive frequency of homozygotes causing deviations from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium expectations.|$|E
25|$|This {{trade-off}} {{does not}} apply to vacuum insulated glass (VIG), or evacuated glazing, as heat loss due to convection is eliminated, leaving radiation losses and conduction through the edge seal. These VIG units have most of the air removed from the space between the panes, leaving a nearly-complete vacuum. VIG units which are currently on the market are hermetically sealed along their perimeter with solder glass, that is, a glass frit having a reduced melting point. Such a glass seal is rigid, and will experience increasing stress with increasing temperature differential across the unit. This stress may prevent vacuum glazing from being used when the temperature differential <b>is</b> <b>too</b> <b>great.</b> One manufacturer provides a recommendation of 35°C.|$|E

25|$|The Calvinist atonement {{is called}} {{definite}} by some {{because they believe}} it certainly secures the salvation of those for whom Christ died, and it is called {{limited in its extent}} because it effects salvation for the elect only. Calvinists do not believe the power of the atonement is limited in any way, {{which is to say that}} no sin <b>is</b> <b>too</b> <b>great</b> to be expiated by Christ's sacrifice, in their view. Among English Calvinistic (Particular) Baptists, the doctrine was usually known as particular redemption, giving its adherents the name Particular Baptists. This term emphasizes the intention of God to save particular persons through the atonement, as opposed to mankind in general as General Baptists believe.|$|E
25|$|Just as a gun recoils when {{a bullet}} is fired, {{conservation}} of momentum requires a nucleus (such as in a gas) to recoil during emission or absorption of a gamma ray. If a nucleus at rest emits a gamma ray, {{the energy of}} the gamma ray is slightly less than the natural energy of the transition, but in order for a nucleus at rest to absorb a gamma ray, the gamma ray's energy must be slightly greater than the natural energy, because in both cases energy is lost to recoil. This means that nuclear resonance (emission and absorption of the same gamma ray by identical nuclei) is unobservable with free nuclei, because the shift in energy <b>is</b> <b>too</b> <b>great</b> and the emission and absorption spectra have no significant overlap.|$|E
25|$|In the {{tournaments in}} which Nelson competed {{that did not}} have 36-hole cuts (that is: the Masters, PGA Championship and the {{possible}} three other tournaments), only the top 20 players received a paycheck even though all players in these events were guaranteed to compete past 36 holes. Hence, in these no-cut events, Nelson still placed in the top 20, so Nelson's 113 cuts made are reflective of his 113 top 20 finishes. Woods achieved a top 20 finish 21 consecutive times (from July 2000 to July 2001) and, in the 31 no-cut events in which he played, he won 10 and finished out of the top 10 only five times. Others, including Woods himself, argue that the two streaks cannot be compared, because the variation of tournament structures in the two eras <b>is</b> <b>too</b> <b>great</b> for any meaningful comparison to be made.|$|E

25|$|Soil volume: Giving a bonsai a {{relatively}} large soil volume encourages the growth of roots, then corresponding growth {{of the rest of}} the tree. With a large amount of soil, the tree trunk extends in length and increases in diameter, existing branches increase in size and new branches appear, and the foliage expands in volume. The grower can move an outdoor bonsai from a pot to a training box or to open ground to stimulate this sort of growth. Replacing the tree in a bonsai pot will slow or halt the tree's growth, and may lead to die-back if the volume of foliage <b>is</b> <b>too</b> <b>great</b> for the limited root system to support. Managing the tree's available soil volume allows the grower to manage the overall size of the bonsai, and to increase vigor and growth when new branches are required for a planned styling.|$|E
25|$|Wheeler's {{version of}} the double-slit {{experiment}} is arranged so that the same photon that emerges from two slits can be detected in two ways. The first way lets the two paths come together, lets the two copies of the wavefunction overlap, and shows interference. The second way moves {{farther away from the}} photon source to a position where the distance between the two copies of the wavefunction <b>is</b> <b>too</b> <b>great</b> to show interference effects. The technical problem in the laboratory is how to insert a detector screen at a point appropriate to observe interference effects or to remove that screen to reveal the photon detectors that can be restricted to receiving photons from the narrow regions of space where the slits are found. One way to accomplish that task would be to use the recently developed electrically switchable mirrors and simply change directions of the two paths from the slits by switching a mirror on or off. As of early 2014 no such experiment has been announced.|$|E
25|$|The {{earliest}} locomotives did {{not show}} the pressure of steam in the boiler, but {{it was possible to}} estimate this by the position of the safety valve arm which often extended onto the firebox back plate; gradations marked on the spring column gave a rough indication of the actual pressure. The promoters of the Rainhill trials urged that each contender have a proper mechanism for reading the boiler pressure, and Stephenson devised a nine-foot vertical tube of mercury with a sight-glass at the top, mounted alongside the chimney, for his Rocket. The Bourdon tube gauge, in which the pressure straightens an oval-section coiled tube of brass or bronze connected to a pointer, was introduced in 1849 and quickly gained acceptance, and is still used today. Some locomotives have an additional pressure gauge in the steam chest. This helps the driver avoid wheel-slip at startup, by warning if the regulator opening <b>is</b> <b>too</b> <b>great.</b>|$|E

25|$|According to Janes {{the navy}} is badly underfunded {{and much of}} its {{equipment}} {{is in need of}} maintenance; as a consequence it is scarcely able to carry out its tasks, with operations often delayed or cancelled. The navy's patrol craft are barely effective; fuel costs and maintenance problems mean that often only one boat is available for sea duty at any time, while the heavy landing craft have high upkeep costs and are nearing the end of their service life. Although the patrol boats may be at times serviceable, the task of patrolling such a large Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) <b>is</b> <b>too</b> <b>great</b> and they are heavily reliant for information about the presence of foreign ships on daily reports supplied by US satellite surveillance. The main concern is illegal tuna fishing by Japanese vessels. The navy would like larger vessels as the Pacific class experiences difficulties in deep ocean conditions and is exploring the possibility of procuring a 2,000 tonne multipurpose vessel, or the conversion of a merchant vessel, for patrol duties.|$|E
25|$|Mata Nui learns of Bara Magna's past, his creators the Great Beings, and {{his destiny}} to reunite the planet with its moons Aqua Magna and Bota Magna to {{recreate}} the once-plentiful Spherus Magna. He begins his quest by travelling through a maze occupied with booby-traps (using the map he found as a guide), where he uncovers an unstable power source. After convincing the Glatorian and Agori to let him use the prototype robot that they use as their Mega-Village, Mata Nui places the power source, the Mask of Life and his spirit inside it, and as the vessel, begins the process of reuniting Bara Magna with its satellites. Later, Makuta Teridax - in Mata Nui's old body - touches down on Bara Magna after sensing Mata Nui's presence. Planning to conquer the planet and eventually {{the rest of the}} universe, he offers Mata Nui the chance to join him. He refuses, and the two robots do battle. On the ground, several Rahkshi and Skakdi under Teridax's command exit the Matoran Universe via his heel, followed by Tahu, Takanuva and other Toa. The Makuta's forces are soon joined by the Skrall, who together, battle the Glatorian and Agori. Meanwhile, the Mask of Life reduces Tahu into his original Toa Mata form so he can don the Golden Armor; a weapon originally devised to destroy the Makuta species if they were to ever betray Mata Nui. Teridax notices and scatters the armor across the desert with an energy blast. With help from the Glatorian Gresh, Tahu and Takanuva retrieve the armor back from their enemies. When Tahu bestows it, a wave of energy is unleashed that incinerates all the Kraata powering the Rahkshi armor, leaving the Skakdi and Skrall greatly outnumbered. Mata Nui notices Teridax's hesitation in sensing the loss of his Rahkshi and sees a chance to swing his body into the oncoming path of a rock fragment from Aqua Magna. It crashes into the Makuta's head and damages the robot's core processor, killing the tyrant for good. Mata Nui completes his destiny of reforming Spherus Magna, but the strain <b>is</b> <b>too</b> <b>great</b> as his body plummets to the ground. The Toa and Glatorian arrive at the crash-site to find Mata Nui speaking from inside the undamaged Mask of Life. He asks them to seek out the Great Beings as his final wish before deciding to stay dormant within the mask. The Toa, Matoran, Glatorian, Agori and all other beings from both worlds now begin a new life on Spherus Magna.|$|E
500|$|Pulmonary {{contusion}} or its complications such as {{acute respiratory distress}} syndrome {{may cause}} lungs to lose compliance (stiffen), so higher pressures {{may be needed to}} give normal amounts of air and oxygenate the blood adequately. Positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP), which delivers air at a given pressure {{at the end of the}} expiratory cycle, can reduce edema and keep alveoli from collapsing. [...] PEEP is considered necessary with mechanical ventilation; however, if the pressure <b>is</b> <b>too</b> <b>great</b> it can expand the size of the contusion and injure the lung. When the compliance of the injured lung differs significantly from that of the uninjured one, the lungs can be ventilated independently with two ventilators in order to deliver air at different pressures; this helps avoid injury from overinflation while providing adequate ventilation.|$|E
