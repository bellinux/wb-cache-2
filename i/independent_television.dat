5|$|Central <b>Independent</b> <b>Television</b> had {{confidence}} in the project, so rather than the show being shot at their studios in Nottingham as planned, they granted Richmond a £2 million budget. This enabled it to be shot on 16 mm film, rather than the regular, less expensive videotape, and on location, making it very expensive compared with most children's television. These high production costs almost led to its cancellation {{at the end of}} the second series, by which time Central executive Lewis Rudd was unable to commission programmes by himself.|$|E

5|$|ATV Music Publishing {{remained}} a successful {{organization in the}} music industry throughout the 1970s. Len Beadle, the company's chief executive, signed up many songwriters and bought numerous song catalogues. The catalog acquisitions, along with the continuing royalties from Lennon and McCartney, ensured that large amounts of money were frequently coming in for ATV Music Publishing. Despite the success of the music publishing organization, other ventures formed by Grade were not performing as well. Pye Records, which continued to distribute music from artists such as Carl Douglas and Barry White, was failing to bring in large amounts of money. The main television arm of ATV lost its government-granted license in its then-current form and was restructured into Central <b>Independent</b> <b>Television.</b>|$|E
5|$|Renwick {{resisted}} the BBC's attempt to broadcast the episode at Christmas, feeling that such scheduling would contrast unfavourably with the grimness of the show, {{and would be}} viewed as an overt attempt to garner high ratings. The controller of BBC1 relented and the episode was first transmitted on BBC One on 20 November 2000. The broadcast coincided with the transmission of Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?s first UK jackpot win. Some people within the BBC alleged that Celador, the production company in charge of Who Wants to Be a Millionaire? had rigged Judith Keppel's victory to spoil the BBC's expected high ratings for the sitcom's finale. The <b>Independent</b> <b>Television</b> Commission (ITC) cleared Celador and ITV of any wrongdoing.|$|E

5|$|His seat on MGM's {{board would}} last {{less than a}} year. After the {{unexpected}} death of studio head Harry Cohn in late February 1958, Columbia's board of directors selected a committee to pursue hiring his replacement. In early April {{it was confirmed that}} Briskin {{was one of those who}} they were considering. In April 1958 Briskin resigned from MGM, in order to return to Columbia, this time as Vice President in Charge of West Coast Activities. In addition to his executive production roles, Briskin was also made one of 9 members of Fico's board of directors. Fico was a company formed with the express purpose of buying up shares of Columbia stock on the open market as a way to display confidence in the company. By the end of 1958, Briskin was Vice President and General Manager of the studio. In April 1959, Briskin announced an ambitious plan for Columbia, wherein they scheduled 99 films for release over an 18-month span, and studio head Abe Schneider (also Briskin's brother-in-law) tagged Briskin to head the program. Among the films scheduled for production during this span included Anatomy of a Murder, A Raisin in the Sun, and Suddenly, Last Summer. Also in 1959, Briskin made Glenn E. Miller Productions a Columbia affiliate, the new arm specializing film production for military and defense purposes. Something Briskin had experience in during World War II. In July, Briskin's brother, Irving, sold his <b>independent</b> <b>television</b> production company to Screen Gems, Columbia's wholly owned subsidiary. After the sale, he went back to work at Columbia, where he had been prior to forming his own company. Shortly after, Briskin, reunited with his brother, announced that he was re-integrating Screen Gems back into Columbia, and it would no longer operate as a separate entity. Under Briskin, in July 1959 production hit an all-time high at Columbia, with over $11.5 million in production at one time. In August, despite rising production costs, Briskin took the unprecedented step of lowering the fees Columbia charged independent producers under contract to the studio. In September 1959 it was announced that Briskin had been elected to Columbia's board of directors, a position he held until his death. At the same time as Briskin was being elected to Columbia's board, it was announced that his son, Jerry, would be joining him at Columbia, working in the Screen Gems division as the producer for the television series, Manhunt. In December, Briskin's contract with Columbia was up for renewal by their shareholders.|$|E
