5000|$|Flanges {{are flat}} rings {{around the end}} of pipes which mate with an {{equivalent}} flange from another pipe, the two being held together by bolts usually passed through holes drilled through the flanges. A deformable gasket, usually elastomeric, placed between raised faces on the mating flanges provides the seal. Flanges are designed to a large number of specifications that differ because of dimensional variations in pipes sizes and pressure requirements, and because of independent standards development. In the U.S. flanges are either threaded or welded onto the pipe. In the European market flanges are usually welded onto the pipe. In the US flanges are available in a standard 125 lb. bolt pattern as well as a 250 lb (and heavier) bolt pattern (steel bolt pattern). Both are usually rated at [...] A <b>flanged</b> <b>joint</b> is rigid and can bear both tension and compression as well as a limited degree of shear and bending. It also can be dismantled after assembly. Due to the rigid nature of the joint and the risk of excessive bending moment being imposed, it is advised that flanged pipework is not buried.|$|E

40|$|Flanged joints {{on large}} {{diameter}} flanges can prove problematic to seal successfully with many {{factors contributing to}} ensuring a successful operation. One such factor is stud bolt loading contributing to stress and deflection of the <b>flanged</b> <b>joint.</b> This investigation {{involves the use of}} finite element analysis (F. E. A) to predict levels of stress and deflection of a particular <b>flanged</b> <b>joint</b> when the stud bolts are tightened and flange pressurised. The level of stud bolt force selected must ensure the joint is sufficiently tight to avoid leakage. However, the force must not be excessive causing damage. The <b>flanged</b> <b>joint</b> is located on the channel head of a shell and tube heat exchanger. For the purposes of this project, the educational version of ANSYS 5. 5 was used thus a number of critical assumptions were made to operate within the restrictions of the software. As a comparative check of the F. E. A method, a conventional method termed the target load bolt-up method was employed.

40|$|The {{paper is}} an {{overview}} of work by the author in measuring and monitoring loads in bolts using an ultrasonic extensometer. A {{number of cases of}} bolted joints are covered. These include, a clamped joint with clearance fit between the bolt and hole, a clamped joint with the bolt in an interference fit with the hole, a <b>flanged</b> <b>joint</b> which allows the flange and bolt to bend; and a shear joint in a clevis and tang configuration. These applications were initially developed for measuring and monitoring preload in the NASA Space Shuttle Orbiter critical joints but are also applicable for monitoring loads in other critical bolted joints of structures such as transportation bridges and other aerospace structures. The paper explains how to setup a model to estimate the load factor and accuracy for the ultrasonic preload application in a clamped joint with clearance fit.

40|$|The {{recognised}} {{standard method}} of gasketed <b>flanged</b> <b>joint</b> design contained within most pressure vessel codes is {{that based on}} the Taylor Forge procedure (Trans ASME 59 (1937) 161). This has, as its basis, bolt load calculations, which are designed to apply sufficient load to both seat and initialise the gasket, and to ensure sealing via a gasket when the operational pressure load is present. The flange ring and hub transmit the bolt load to the gasket and must therefore be stiff and flat. However, there are many real situations where additional loads arise through external pulling and bending. This is commonly seen in piping systems and other flanged pressure equipment. Although the codes do not specifically address the 'combined load' problem, the normal method for considering this additional load is to form an equivalent pressure. This over-pressure is calculated by making the stress generated in the pipe or vessel wall, by the external load, equal to a longitudinal pressure stress which may be tensile or compressive, depending {{on the nature of}} the load. This results in an over-pressure which can therefore be added to the operating pressure. For bending loads, no account is taken of the variation around the circumference, or the change in gasket seating width, which will vary as the flange faces rotate. In order to assess the effects of external loading on flanges, a combined load test rig has been constructed and a number of bolted flange assemblies examined including standard ANSI joints and compact VERAX VCF joints (Fig. 1 a and b). These assemblies have been strain gauged and tested for a variety of load conditions. Tests have been carried out using hydraulic fluid as the main pressurising medium.

Despite of Turkish standards on air duct are present, studies on energy consumption associated with air leakage are very rare in Turkey, on the contrary to many developed countries. In this study, the subject of preventing energy losses related to the leakage, which causes inefficient working condition, has been investigated. Firstly, air duct system and quality requirements have been explained and the main standards have been analyzed for airtightness of air distribution systems, as well. Secondly, duct system measurements have been conducted by choosing two different approaches. One approach covers leakage calculation of a single duct by using European Standard called Eurovent, whereas the other one divides the system into single sections and uses the Power Law Model for calculation of leakage occurred in each section. Single duct leakage measurements were made on 300 mm and 1000 mm diameter circular ducts and 300 mm by 250 mm and 1000 mm by 500 mm <b>flanged</b> <b>joint</b> rectangular ducts for positive internal pressures. Test results showed that duct leakage depends on the method of duct fabrication, method of sealing, workmanship and static pressure differential. Furthermore, calculated leakage factors were under the allowable leakage limits in classification. C. for rectangular and circular ducts that were produced by Venco A. Ş. Comparing rectangular to circular ducts both had the same length of seam and surface area; the leakage from circular ducts was less than 80 % from rectangular ducts. The air leakage from all test ducts, with the same lock seam type, decreases, whereas the surface area increases. Branched duct leakage measurements were made on 300 mm and 630 mm diameter circular ducts and 300 mm by 200 mm and 500 mm by 300 mm rectangular ducts and also air distribution system for positive internal pressures. Test results showed that fittings in a system cause sudden changes in static pressure; therefore, duct leakage depends on fitting locations. The leakage rate in Spiro sealed system was less than 5 % Trelleborg sealed system. The leakage measured in {{this study showed that}} seam leakage accounts from 14 % to 20 % of the total in the two rectangular ducts and from 8 % to 13 % for the round ducts with Pittsburgh and Spiral lock seams. These data show that the joints are the major source of duct leakage. Improvement in duct construction leading to duct systems with less leakage will need to focus on better joints.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Apparently no {{analytical}} method {{is available to}} analyze the bolt tension in a <b>flanged</b> pipe <b>joint</b> subjected to flexure {{taking into account the}} actual stress distribution at the joint. Conventionally, a method similar to the flexural analysis of beam is sometimes applied on the assumption that bolt tension is proportional to the distance from neutral axis which is far from the actual stress condition. In this paper, an investigation has been carried out to find the effects of various parameters relating to <b>flanged</b> pipe <b>joint</b> connection, so that a definite guideline on determining the bolt tension can be developed.
