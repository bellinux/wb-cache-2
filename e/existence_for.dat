5|$|Although {{the link}} between {{performance}} in chess and general intelligence is often assumed, researchers have largely failed to confirm its <b>existence.</b> <b>For</b> example, a 2006 study found no differences in fluid intelligence, as measured by Raven's Progressive Matrices, between strong adult chess players and regular people. There is some evidence towards a correlation between performance in chess and intelligence among beginning players. However, performance in chess also relies substantially on one's experience playing the game, {{and the role of}} experience may overwhelm the role of intelligence. Chess experts are estimated to have in excess of 10,000 and possibly as many as 300,000 position patterns stored in their memory; long training is necessary to acquire that amount of data.|$|E

5|$|Bowling Green, Kentucky, was {{designated}} the Confederate capital of Kentucky at a convention in nearby Russellville. Due {{to the military}} situation in the state, the provisional government was exiled and traveled with the Army of Tennessee {{for most of its}} <b>existence.</b> <b>For</b> a short time in the autumn of 1862, the Confederate Army controlled Frankfort, the only time a Union capital was captured by Confederate forces. During this occupation, General Braxton Bragg attempted to install the provisional government as the permanent authority in the Commonwealth. However, Union General Don Carlos Buell ambushed the inauguration ceremony and drove the provisional government from the state for the final time. From that point forward, the government existed primarily on paper and was dissolved {{at the end of the}} war.|$|E

5|$|The United Nations Commission on Human Rights {{came under}} fire during its <b>existence</b> <b>for</b> the {{high-profile}} positions it gave to member states that did not guarantee {{the human rights of}} their own citizens. Several nations known to have been guilty of gross violations of human rights became members of the organization, such as Libya, Cuba, Sudan, Algeria, China, Azerbaijan and Vietnam. Meanwhile, the United States was also angry when it was ejected from the Commission in 2002. While it was re-elected, the election of human rights-abusing nations also caused frictions. It was partly because of these problems that Kofi Annan in the In Larger Freedom report suggested setting up a new Human Rights Council as a subsidiary UN body.|$|E
40|$|Frame {{difference}} families, {{which can}} be obtained via a careful use of cyclotomic conditions attached to strong difference families, {{play an important role}} in direct constructions for resolvable balanced incomplete block designs. We establish asymptotic <b>existences</b> <b>for</b> several classes of frame difference families. As corollaries new infinite families of 1 -rotational (pq+ 1,p+ 1, 1) -RBIBDs over F_p^+ ×F_q^+ are derived, and the existence of (125 q+ 1, 6, 1) -RBIBDs is discussed. We construct (v, 8, 1) -RBIBDs for v∈{ 624, 1576, 2976, 5720, 5776, 10200, 14176, 24480 }, whose existence were previously in doubt.

5|$|Throughout {{his career}} Douglas {{attracted}} commissions from wealthy and important patrons. His first-known independent work was an ornament, {{which is no}} longer in <b>existence,</b> <b>for</b> the garden of the Honourable MrsCholmondeley. She was the sister-in-law of Hugh Cholmondeley, 2nd Baron Delamere, and it was from the 2ndBaron that Douglas received his first major commission, a considerable rebuilding of the south wing of his seat at Vale Royal Abbey in 1860. Around the same time, Lord Delamere commissioned him to build the church of St John the Evangelist at Over, Winsford, as a memorial to his first wife.|$|E
5|$|Extending the police's {{presence}} {{across the}} region was logistically challenging, requiring {{the creation of a}} network of new posts and the use of steamers to move supplies around the coast. It proved to be a harsh <b>existence</b> <b>for</b> the force, particularly when deliveries of supplies were delayed by bad weather. Work began on a railroad to Hudson Bay in 1908, continuing for two decades, which, although it required substantial police assistance, gradually eased the challenge of supplying the police outposts around the bay. The police opened temporary detachments around York Factory in 1912, and then at Port Nelson in 1913, where the police established their divisional headquarters. Patrols pushed up into Baker Lake and along the Coppermine River until, {{by the end of the}} decade, the police presence in Hudson Bay had been reduced to a bare minimum, with the force focusing on reaching out into ever more remote areas.|$|E
5|$|Hybrids are {{offspring}} {{resulting from}} the breeding of two genetically distinct individuals, which usually {{will result in a}} high degree of heterozygosity, though hybrid and heterozygous are not synonymous. The deliberate or accidental hybridizing of two or more species of closely related animals through captive breeding is a human activity which has been in <b>existence</b> <b>for</b> millennia and has grown for economic purposes. Hybrids between different subspecies within a species (such as between the Bengal tiger and Siberian tiger) are known as intra-specific hybrids. Hybrids between different species within the same genus (such as between lions and tigers) are known as interspecific hybrids or crosses. Hybrids between different genera (such as between sheep and goats) are known as intergeneric hybrids. Natural hybrids will occur in hybrid zones, where two populations of species within the same genera or species living in the same or adjacent areas will interbreed with each other. Some hybrids have been recognized as species, such as the red wolf (though this is controversial).|$|E

5|$|In botany, a tree is a {{perennial}} plant with an elongated stem, or trunk, supporting branches and leaves in most species. In some usages, {{the definition of}} a tree may be narrower, including only woody plants with secondary growth, plants that are usable as lumber or plants above a specified height. Trees are not a taxonomic group but include a variety of plant species that have independently evolved a woody trunk and branches as a way to tower above other plants to compete for sunlight. Trees tend to be long-lived, some reaching several thousand years old. In looser definitions, the taller palms, tree ferns, bananas and bamboos are also trees. Trees have been in <b>existence</b> <b>for</b> 370 million years. It is estimated that there are just over 3 trillion mature trees in the world.|$|E
5|$|Jackson and Walsh {{conceived}} {{the idea for}} The Frighteners during the script-writing phase of Heavenly Creatures. Executive producer Robert Zemeckis hired the duo to write the script, with the original intention of Zemeckis directing The Frighteners as a spin-off film of the television series, Tales from the Crypt. With Jackson and Walsh's first draft submitted in January 1994, Zemeckis believed the film {{would be better off}} directed by Jackson, produced by Zemeckis and funded/distributed by Universal Studios. The visual effects were created by Jackson's Weta Digital, which had only been in <b>existence</b> <b>for</b> three years. This, plus the fact that The Frighteners required more digital effects shots than almost any movie made until that time, resulted in the eighteen-month period for effects work by Weta Digital being largely stressed.|$|E
5|$|Parliament {{and many}} {{concerned}} reformers had been attempting {{to improve the}} housing of the working classes since the early 1830s. When Hill began her work, the model dwelling movement had been in <b>existence</b> <b>for</b> twenty years, royal and select committees had sat to examine the problems of urban well-being, and {{the first of many}} tranches of legislation aimed at improving working class housing had been passed. From Hill's point of view these had all failed the poorest members of the working class, the unskilled labourers. She found that their landlords routinely ignored their obligations towards their tenants, and that the tenants were too ignorant and oppressed to better themselves. She tried to find new homes for her charges, but there was a severe shortage of available property, and Hill decided that her only solution was to become a landlord herself. John Ruskin, who was interested in the co-operative guild, knew Hill from her work as his copyist and was impressed by her. As an aesthete and a humanitarian he was affronted by the brutal ugliness of the slums. In 1865, having inherited a substantial sum of money from his father, he acquired for £750 the leases of three cottages of six rooms each in Paradise Place, Marylebone.|$|E
