40|$|AbstractIn {{order to}} plan pre-draining time of gas from extracting seam reasonably, coal seam is counted as double media with pores and cracks. Considering seepage, {{diffusion}} and desorption process of gas, the gas flow equation is built up. The solver with MATLAB <b>is</b> <b>work</b> <b>out,</b> and the prediction method of reasonable pre-draining time is discussed. The solver is applied in workface of 4 # coal seam of north area of Sha qu mine, and gas pre-draining rate curve is obtained with time in different holes space. The {{results show that}} in same pre-draining time, the smaller holes space is, the greater gas pre-draining rate is. Under the condition of 5 m holes space, and in the demand of 30 % pre-draining rate, the reasonable pre-draining time is 200 d, which {{is close to the}} actual result. The theoretical method does not need drilling in the field, which could reduce on-site work and avoid the problem such as drilling and sealing quality, uneven distribution of gas and others, as provide dependable basis for gas pre-draining management...|$|E
