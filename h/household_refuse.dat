25|$|In July 2001, it was {{discovered}} that two Halberstadt residents (aged 24 and 26) had gained entry to the tunnel system through an unsecured opening and made off with numerous banknotes. The two residents were convicted of the crime and sentenced to four months in prison and three years of probation. Furthermore, they had to pay €120 to a non-profit organisation. The appearance among collectors of uncirculated 200 and 500 Mark notes, and of the never-issued military currency, is attributed to this theft. Because of the theft and the slowness of the rotting, the KfW then decided to burn the old currency.

500|$|The Rochdale {{system was}} first used in 1869. [...] It used a wooden tub, or pail (sometimes half of a {{petroleum}} barrel), which was placed under the closet seat. [...] The pails were often circular (to aid cleaning), and were designed to be easily handled and of a size that encouraged regular collections. [...] The top of the pail carried a cast iron rim about 3inches deep to receive a tight-fitting inner lid. [...] The pails were collected {{on a weekly basis}} during the day. [...] Each pail was secured by its lid and loaded onto a sealed 24-bay wagon to be taken to a depot where they were emptied, cleaned and returned. [...] While the pail was removed from the closet, a replacement was installed in its place. [...] In 1874, Rochdale Corporation employed five such wagons in full-time service, collecting from 3,354privies spread across the town. [...] By contrast, with a much larger population, Manchester Corporation employed 73wagons. [...] By 1875, 4,741pails were in use, and in 1876 the number was5,566.

According to the recommended standard by Alexander (2001), the observed OC in all treatments, satisfy the required range.

40|$|Introduction. Pilot plant {{study of}} {{anaerobic}} composting {{of the organic}} fraction of municipal solid waste (MSW) in Isfahan was performed using sequential batch system. The anaerobic composting were compared with the conventional aerobic composting of MSW using windrow system in 1998 - 99. &# 13; Methods. An experimental study was performed on samples of <b>household</b> <b>refuses,</b> anaerobic composts, aerobic composts and leachate of anaerobic composts. Inert materials, heavy metals concentration and physical characteristics of anaerobic and aerobic composts were compared. &# 13; Results. There was not significant difference between physical and chemical characteristics of anaerobic and aerobic composting. The study showed that the heavy metals concentration in the anaerobic compost was less than aerobic compost and inert materials in both composts were more than standard concentration. &# 13; Discussion. Sequential batch anaerobic composting (SEBAC) system is stable and has a good flexibility for organic materials with high total solids and a good way for MSWs composting. Amounts of heavy metals (e. g. Pb, Zn, Cu, Ni, Cr, Fe, Cd) in compost of the separated municipal solid wastes were low and about the standard ranges, but in the compost of unseparated MSWs {{were significantly higher than}} standard compost (P < 0. 05). Therefore, separating the municipal solid waste in houses is essential for conservation of agricultural soil pollution...|$|R
40|$|A key {{measure of}} the success of a data {{collection}} effort is the final response rate. The American Community Survey (ACS) achieves a high total response rate each year, {{due in part to the}} data collection design, which in turn reflects the experience and research in data collection strategies drawn from the U. S. Census Bureau’s decennial census and demographic survey programs. Success, however, would not be possible without the high quality of the actual data collection, which is due to the efforts of the interviewing staff in the telephone centers and regional offices. This success also is related to the mandatory nature of the survey. Title 13 of the United States Code [U. S. C. ] authorizes the Census Bureau to conduct the ACS, requires households to participate, and requires the Census Bureau to keep confidential all information collected. The data collection operation for housing units (HUs) consists of three modes: mail, telephone, and personal visit. For most HUs, the first phase includes a questionnaire mailed to the sample address, with a request to the household to complete the questionnaire and return it by mail. If no response is received, the Census Bureau follows up with computer-assisted telephone interviewing (CATI) when a telephone number is available. If the Census Bureau is unable to reach an occupant using CATI, or if the <b>household</b> <b>refuses</b> to participate, the address may be selected for computer-assisted personal interviewing (CAPI) ...|$|R
30|$|However, {{at least}} in the case of houses {{constructed}} in separate settlements away from the winter pasture areas, some problems have already occurred. In these locations there is no space to keep livestock and so some households, especially small or rich <b>households,</b> <b>refused</b> to move in, even after the house construction was completed. In such a situation, it depends on the local executive government how it will proceed. Some households who are dissatisfied with the settlement conditions simply sell the house secretly, hoping there will not be any consequences. During my field research period the Nomadic settlement project was only in the first phase. The first year settlements were being finished and the nomads were about to move in. Therefore, {{it was not possible to}} describe how the government representatives react when the nomads ignore the settlement rules. In most cases however the older generation together with children obliged to attend school reside in the new house, while the middle-aged couple remained on the grassland taking care of the livestock as before. The new houses are comfortable and the road access makes transportation easy, but there are not many new income possibilities for the nomadic households. Besides their knowledge of animal husbandry, their education is usually insufficient. The government hopes that these families could get involved in small businesses and other services mainly for tourism. However, without proper qualifications, this appears to be a difficult issue for the nomads.|$|R

5000|$|The [...] "residual method" [...] {{is widely}} used to {{estimate}} the illegal immigrant population of the US. With this method, the known number of legally documented immigrants to the United States is subtracted from the reported U.S. Census number of self-proclaimed foreign-born people (based on immigration records and adjusted by projections of deaths and out-migration) to obtain the total, illegal immigrant (residual) population. This methodology {{is used by the}} US Department of Homeland Security, the Pew Hispanic Center, the Center for Immigration Studies, and the U.S. Census Bureau. Since illegal immigrants have many reasons for not answering the U.S. Census correctly and since there are no penalties for answering the U.S. Census incorrectly, it is accepted that it under-counts the number of illegal immigrants. The users of this methodology assume that 10% of illegal immigrants are not counted by census takers. The 10% assumption is based on a 2001 University of California survey asked of 829 people born in Mexico and living in Los Angeles whether they responded to census interviewers in the 2000 census with 40% of queried <b>households</b> <b>refusing</b> to answer the survey. Critics claim that the estimate is unreliable for a number of reasons: figures for outmigration are not tracked by the federal government; the proportion of illegal immigrants who respond to the Census is unknown; the estimate that 10% of illegal immigrants do not respond to the census is arbitrary and unsupported by a sufficient sample size and geographic spread; and that the self reporting of where one was born relies on the honesty of the person being questioned.|$|R
