5|$|Pesticides are {{formulated}} to kill pests, {{but many}} have detrimental effects on non-target species; {{of particular concern}} is {{the damage done to}} honey-bees, solitary bees and other pollinating insects and in this regard, the time of day when the spray is applied can be important. The widely used neonicotinoids have been banned on flowering crops in some countries because of their <b>effects</b> <b>on</b> <b>bees.</b> Some pesticides may cause cancer and other health problems in humans, as well as being harmful to wildlife.

5|$|Scientists {{have long}} been {{concerned}} that pesticides, including possibly some fungicides, may have sublethal <b>effects</b> <b>on</b> <b>bees,</b> not killing them outright, but instead impairing their development and behavior. Of special interest is the class of insecticides called neonicotinoids, which contain the active ingredient imidacloprid, and other similar chemicals, such as clothianidin and thiamethoxam. Honey bees may be affected by such chemicals when they are used as a seed treatment because they are known {{to work their way}} through the plant up into the flowers and leave residues in the nectar. The containment of neonicotinoids to crops and fields designated for treatment is difficult, and many times inefficient. Run-off from treated fields and farm machinery that is not properly cleaned after field treatments can lead to exposure and uptake of pesticides by untreated plants. Therefore, honey bees are not only exposed to neonicotinoids by foraging on treated plants, but also by foraging on plants unintentionally exposed to these chemicals. The doses taken up by bees are not lethal, but possible chronic problems could be caused by long-term exposure. In a laboratory setting, both lethal and sub-lethal effects on foraging behavior, memory, and learning ability have been observed in honey bees exposed to neonicotinoids. However, these effects were not seen in field studies with field-realistic dosages. Most corn grown in the US is treated with neonicotinoids, and a 2012 study found high levels of clothianidin in pneumatic planter exhaust. In the study, the insecticide was present in the soil of unplanted fields near those planted with corn and on dandelions growing near those fields. Another 2012 study also found clothianidin and imidacloprid in the exhaust of pneumatic seeding equipment.|$|E

Some pesticides, including Neonicotinoids, are more toxic to bees and cause acute symptoms with lower doses compared to older classes of insecticides. Acute toxicity may depend on the mode of exposure, for instance, many pesticides cause toxic effects by contact while Neonicotinoids are more toxic when consumed orally. The {{acute toxicity}}, although more lethal, is less common than sub-lethal toxicity or cumulative effects.|$|E

40|$|Background: Diverse flower {{communities}} are more stable in floral resource production along the flowering season, {{but the question}} about how the diversity and stability of resources affect pollinator reproduction remains open. High plant diversity could favor short foraging trips, which in turn would enhance bee fitness. In addition to plant diversity, greater temporal stability of floral resources in diverse communities could favor pollinator fitness because such {{communities are}} likely to occupy the phenological space more broadly, increasing floral availability for pollinators throughout the season. In addition, this potential effect of flower diversity <b>on</b> <b>bee</b> reproduction could be stronger for generalist pollinators because they can use a broader floral spectrum. Based on above arguments we predicted that pollinator reproduction would be positively correlated to flower diversity, and to temporal stability in flower production, and that this relationship would be stronger for the most generalized pollinator species. Materials and Methods: Using structural equation models, we evaluated {{the effect of these}} variables and other ecological factors on three estimates of bee reproduction (average number of brood cells per nest per site, total number of brood cells per site, and total number of nests per site), and whether such effects were modulated by <b>bee</b> generalization <b>on</b> floral resources. Results: Contrary to our expectations, flower diversity had no <b>effect</b> <b>on</b> <b>bee</b> reproduction, stability in flower production had a weakly negative <b>effect</b> <b>on</b> one of the bee reproductive variables, and the strength of the fitness-diversity relationship was unrelated to bee generalization. In contrast, elevation had a negative <b>effect</b> <b>on</b> <b>bee</b> reproduction, despite the narrow elevation range encompassed by our sites. Discussion: Flower diversity did not affect the reproduction of the solitary bees studied here. This result could stem from the context dependence of the diversity-stability relationship, given that elevation had a positive <b>effect</b> <b>on</b> flower diversity but a negative <b>effect</b> <b>on</b> <b>bee</b> reproduction. Although high temporal stability in flower production is expected to enhance pollinator reproduction, in our study it had a weakly negative—instead of positive—effect on the average number of brood cells per nest. Other environmental factors that vary with elevation could influence bee reproduction. Our study focused on a small group of closely-related bee species, which cautions against generalization of our findings to other groups of pollinators. More studies are clearly needed to assess the extent to which pollinator demography is influenced by the diversity of floral resources...|$|R
50|$|Pesticides {{are linked}} to Colony Collapse Disorder and are now {{considered}} a main cause, and the toxic <b>effects</b> of Neonicotinoids <b>on</b> <b>bees</b> are confirmed.

30|$|A 2 -year {{moratorium}} {{implemented by}} the European Commission on the usage of several insecticidal neonicotinoids became effective on Dec 1, 2013. The manufacturers Bayer CropScience and Syngenta subsequently challenged the restrictions implemented juristically. Both companies argue that the bans’ justification is solely derived from evidence from laboratory studies showing adverse effects of neonicotinoids on individual honeybees whereas field studies with bee colonies demonstrate the absence of adverse effects. Similarly, a DEFRA paper [1], concluded “that <b>effects</b> <b>on</b> <b>bees</b> do not occur under normal circumstances”, and that “laboratory based studies demonstrating sub-lethal <b>effects</b> <b>on</b> <b>bees</b> from neonicotinoids did not replicate realistic conditions, but extreme scenarios.” Consequently, DEFRA supports the view that “the risk to bee populations from neonicotinoids, as they are currently used, is low.” To support this view, Pilling et al. [2] published {{the results of a}} field study that had been commissioned by the manufacturer of thiamethoxam (Syngenta) as part of the docket for thiamethoxam approval. In essence the study concludes that systemic residues in maize pollen and in nectar and pollen of oilseed rape (OSR) grown from thiamethoxam-treated seeds constitute a “low risk” for honeybee colonies [2].|$|E
40|$|Recent {{concern over}} global {{pollinator}} declines {{has led to}} considerable research {{on the effects of}} pesticides on bees 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. Although pesticides are typically not encountered at lethal levels in the field, there is growing evidence indicating that exposure to field-realistic levels can have sublethal <b>effects</b> <b>on</b> <b>bees,</b> affecting their foraging behaviour 1, 6, 7, homing ability 8, 9 and reproductive success 2, 5. Bees are essential for the pollination {{of a wide variety of}} crops and the majority of wild flowering plants 10, 11, 12, but until now research on pesticide effects has been limited to direct <b>effects</b> <b>on</b> <b>bees</b> themselves and not on the pollination services they provide. Here we show the first evidence to our knowledge that pesticide exposure can reduce the pollination services bumblebees deliver to apples, a crop of global economic importance. Bumblebee colonies exposed to a neonicotinoid pesticide provided lower visitation rates to apple trees and collected pollen less often. Most importantly, these pesticide-exposed colonies produced apples containing fewer seeds, demonstrating a reduced delivery of pollination services. Our results also indicate that reduced pollination service delivery is not due to pesticide-induced changes in individual bee behaviour, but most likely due to effects at the colony level. These findings show that pesticide exposure can impair the ability of bees to provide pollination services, with important implications for both the sustained delivery of stable crop yields and the functioning of natural ecosystems...|$|E
40|$|International audienceWe {{devised a}} simple method ("flower") to feed bees individually, and {{compared}} it {{with two other}} methods commonly used ("film canister" and "glass vial"). We tested the three methods on two solitary species, Osmia lignaria and Megachile rotundata, and one social species, Apis mellifera, under four different light regimes (natural, artificial, plant growth and darkness). The flower method was the most effective for all three bee species: 90 - 95 % of the bees fed under natural light, 80 - 95 % under artificial light, 75 - 100 % under plant growth light, and 45 - 70 % in darkness. Percent success was 0 - 50 % with the film canister method, and 0 - 60 % with the glass vial method.

40|$|International audienceOsmia cornuta adults require {{exposure}} to wintering temperatures followed by incubation {{in the spring}} to emerge. We studied winter survival, weight loss, emergence time, and post-emergence longevity in O. cornuta exposed {{to a variety of}} pre-wintering and wintering treatments. Few bees emerged after {{exposure to}} wintering durations < 30 days. Maximum survival and longevity were obtained with wintering durations of 90 - 150 days. Time to emergence following incubation declined with increasing wintering duration and increasing wintering temperature. Pre-wintering treatment had a dramatic <b>effect</b> <b>on</b> <b>bee</b> fitness. Bees pre-wintered for 15 days lost less weight, had higher survival and lived longer than bees pre-wintered for 45 or 75 days. In general, larger bees were more likely to survive the winter and lived longer than smaller bees. We discuss the relevance of these results to survival in wild O. cornuta populations and the management of populations used in orchard pollination...|$|R

40|$|Diseases have {{important}} but understudied <b>effects</b> <b>on</b> <b>bee</b> foraging ecology. Bees transmit and contract diseases on flowers, but floral traits including plant volatiles and inflorescence architecture may affect transmission. Diseases spill over from managed or invasive pollinators to native wild bee species, and impacts of emerging diseases {{are of particular}} concern, threatening pollinator populations and pollination services. Here we review how parasites can alter the foraging behaviour of bees by changing floral preferences and impairing foraging efficiency. We also consider how changes to pollinator behaviours alter or reduce pollination services. The availability of diverse floral resources can, however, ameliorate bee diseases and their impacts through better nutrition and antimicrobial effects of plant compounds in pollen and nectar...|$|R
40|$|For decades, linden trees (basswoods or lime trees), and {{particularly}} silver linden (Tilia tomentosa), {{have been linked}} to mass bee deaths. This phenomenon is often attributed to the purported occurrence of the carbohydrate mannose, which is toxic to bees, in Tilia nectar. In this review, however, we conclude that from existing literature there is no experimental evidence for toxicity to bees in linden nectar. Bee deaths on Tilia probably result from starvation, owing to insufficient nectar resources late in the tree's flowering period. We recommend ensuring sufficient alternative food sources in cities during late summer to reduce bee deaths on silver linden. Silver linden metabolites such as floral volatiles, pollen chemistry and nectar secondary compounds remain underexplored, particularly their toxic or behavioural <b>effects</b> <b>on</b> <b>bees.</b> Some evidence for the presence of caffeine in linden nectar may mean that linden trees can chemically deceive foraging bees to make sub-optimal foraging decisions, in some cases leading to their starvation...|$|E
40|$|International audienceAs more {{transgenic}} crop plants become commercialised, {{there is an}} increasing need for information on their impacts on honey bees and bumblebees. Direct <b>effects</b> <b>on</b> <b>bees</b> may arise upon ingestion of proteins encoded by transgenes, if they are expressed in pollen, nectar or resin. Indirect effects may occur if plant transformation inadvertently changes flower phenotype. This review summarises current findings on effects of purified transgene product ingestion on adult bee gut physiology, food consumption, olfactory learning behaviour and longevity. Bt, protease inhibitor, chitinase, glucanase and biotin-binding protein genes are discussed. Results from tests conducted in the laboratory with individual adult bees and with colonies {{in the field are}} presented. Observations of bee foraging on transgenic plants kept under containment are also summarised.

40|$|To manage agroecosystems for {{multiple}} ecosystem services, {{we need to}} know whether the management of one service has positive, negative, or no effects on other services. We do not yet have data on the interactions between pollination and pest-control services. However, we do have data on the distributions of pollinators and natural enemies in agroecosystems. Therefore, we compared these two groups of ecosystem service providers, to see if the management of farms and agricultural landscapes might have similar effects on the abundance and richness of both. In a meta-analysis, we compared 46 studies that sampled bees, predatory beetles, parasitic wasps, and spiders in fields, orchards, or vineyards of food crops. These studies used the proximity or proportion of non-crop or natural habitats in the landscapes surrounding these crops (a measure of landscape complexity), or the proximity or diversity of non-crop plants in the margins of these crops (a measure of local complexity), to explain the abundance or richness of these beneficial arthropods. Compositional complexity at both landscape and local scales had positive effects on both pollinators and natural enemies, but different effects on different taxa. <b>Effects</b> <b>on</b> <b>bees</b> and spiders were significantly positive, but effects on parasitoids and predatory beetles (mostly Carabidae and Staphylinidae) were inconclusive. Landscape complexity had significantly stronger <b>effects</b> <b>on</b> <b>bees</b> than it did on predatory beetles and significantly stronger effects in non-woody rather than in woody crops. Effects on richness were significantly stronger than effects on abundance, but possibly only for spiders. This abundance-richness difference might be caused by differences between generalists and specialists, or between arthropods that depend on non-crop habitats (ecotone species and dispersers) and those that do not (cultural species). We call this the ‘specialist-generalist’ or ‘cultural difference’ mechanism. If complexity has stronger effects on richness than abundance, it might have stronger effects on the stability than the magnitude of these arthropod-mediated ecosystem services. We conclude that some pollinators and natural enemies seem to have compatible responses to complexity, and {{it might be possible to}} manage agroecosystems for the benefit of both. However, too few studies have compared the two, and so we cannot yet conclude that there are no negative interactions between pollinators and natural enemies, and no trade-offs between pollination and pest-control services. Therefore, we suggest a framework for future research to bridge these gaps in our knowledge...|$|E
40|$|Managed {{bees are}} {{critical}} for crop pollination worldwide. As the demand for pollinator-dependent crops increases, so does the use of managed bees. Concern has arisen that managed bees may have unintended negative impacts <b>on</b> native wild <b>bees,</b> which are important pollinators in both agricultural and natural ecosystems. The goal {{of this study was}} to synthesize the literature documenting the effects of managed honey bees and bumble <b>bees</b> <b>on</b> wild <b>bees</b> in three areas: (1) competition for floral and nesting resources, (2) indirect effects via changes in plant communities, including the spread of exotic plants and decline of native plants, and (3) transmission of pathogens. The majority of reviewed studies reported negative effects of managed bees, but trends differed across topical areas. Of studies examining competition, results were highly variable with 53 % reporting negative <b>effects</b> <b>on</b> wild <b>bees,</b> while 28 % reported no effects and 19 % reported mixed effects (varying with the bee species or variables examined). Equal numbers of studies examining plant communities reported positive (36 %) and negative (36 %) effects, with the remainder reporting no or mixed effects. Finally, the majority of studies on pathogen transmission (70 %) reported potential negative <b>effects</b> of managed <b>bees</b> <b>on</b> wild <b>bees.</b> However, most studies across all topical areas documented the potential for impact (e. g. reporting the occurrence of competition or pathogens), but did not measure direct <b>effects</b> <b>on</b> wild <b>bee</b> fitness, abundance, or diversity. Furthermore, we found that results varied depending <b>on</b> whether managed <b>bees</b> were in their native or non-native range; managed bees within their native range had lesser competitive effects, but potentially greater <b>effects</b> <b>on</b> wild <b>bees</b> via pathogen transmission. We conclude that while this field has expanded considerably in recent decades, additional research measuring direct, long-term, and population-level effects of managed bees is needed to understand their potential impact <b>on</b> wild <b>bees...</b>|$|R

Behavior changes between bees and/or colonies in laboratory or field test conditions versus natural environments also add to the challenges. Studies submitted by Bayer AG to USEPA have provided some useful information about clothianidin's potential long-term <b>effects</b> <b>on</b> honey <b>bees</b> but outstanding questions remain. USEPA's analysis of nine pollinator field studies submitted concluded that three were invalid, so EPA {{did not use the}} data they provided in making its regulatory decision for clothianidin. EPA classified the remainder as supplemental, generally because Bayer AG conducted the studies without EPA first approving the protocols. Supplemental studies are ones that don't definitively answer uncertainties but still provide some data that might be useful in characterizing risk. Indicative of the rapid advance of regulators' understanding of pollinator science, USEPA first accepted one of the studies as sound science in 2007, then reclassified it as invalid in November 2010 only to reclassify it as supplemental one month later. The changes in EPA's classification of this study have no <b>effect</b> <b>on</b> the regulatory status for clothianidin in the U.S. because the study does not provide data with which EPA can legally justify altering its 2003 registration decision.

Several research groups have developed and tested fungus-based biopesticides in laboratory and field experiments, with varying results. While biopesticides have many desirable qualities, including much lower risk of honey contamination and of pest resistance, future research needs to focus on: (1) identification of the sub-population(s) of V. destructor affected by biopesticides and the duration and impact of the application on mite population dynamics; (2) development of an effective, easily applied formulation, and (3) evaluation of possible side or sublethal <b>effects</b> <b>on</b> <b>bees</b> themselves.

40|$|International audienceHoneybees (Apis mellifera) {{and their}} resource-rich nests are hosts {{to a wide}} range of {{saprophytic}} fungi, including species that produce mycotoxins. The toxicity of aflatoxin B 1 (AB 1) and ochratoxin A (OTA), products of Aspergillus species often found in honeybee hives, was evaluated and LC 50 values for both toxins were calculated. Workers can tolerate a wide range of concentrations of both OTA and AB 1. At low concentrations, AB 1 (1 μg/g and 2. 5 μg/g diet) and OTA (1 μg/g) did not have any apparent toxic <b>effects</b> <b>on</b> <b>bees.</b> Enhancement of the toxicity of AB 1 by piperonyl butoxide (PBO), a known inhibitor of cytochrome P 450 monooxygenases, indicates a role for P 450 s in AB 1 detoxification in honeybees. Extracts of propolis, a complex mixture of plant-derived chemicals, including many flavonoids and other phenolic compounds, similarly ameliorated aflatoxin toxicity and delayed the onset of mortality. Collectively, these results suggest that tolerance of AB 1 by honeybees may be due to P 450 -mediated metabolic detoxification. Propolis may serve a hitherto unrecognized role in honey bee health by enhancing the activity of P 450 enzymes involved in mycotoxin detoxification...|$|E
40|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that the widespread use of neonicotinoid insecticides threatens bees, but research on this topic has been surrounded by controversy. In order to synthesize which research approaches have been used to examine the effect of neonicotinoids on bees and to identify knowledge gaps, we systematically reviewed research on this subject that was available on the Web of Science and PubMed in June 2015. Most of the 216 pri-mary research studies were conducted in Europe or North America (82 %), involved the neo-nicotinoid imidacloprid (78 %), and concerned the western honey bee Apis mellifera (75 %). Thus, little seems to be known about neonicotinoids and bees in areas outside Europe and North America. Furthermore, because there is considerable variation in ecological traits among bee taxa, studies on honey bees are not likely to fully predict impacts of neonicoti-noids on other species.

40|$|Varroa {{destructor}} {{in combination}} {{with one or more}} stressors, such as low food availability or chemical exposure, is considered {{to be one of the}} main causes for honey bee colony losses. We examined the inter-active effect of pollen availability on the protein content and body weight of young bees that emerged with and without V. destructor infestation. With reduced pollen availability, and the coherent reduced nutritional protein, we expected that V. destructor infestation during the pupal stage would have a larger negative <b>effect</b> <b>on</b> <b>bee</b> development than without infestation. Moreover, when raised with ample pollen available after emergence, infested pupae were expected not to be able to compensate for early losses due to V. destructor. We found that both V. destructor infestation and reduced pollen availability reduced body weight, abdominal protein level, and increased the head to abdomen protein ratio. The availability of pol- len did indeed not result in compensation for reduced mass and protein content caused by V. destructor infestation in young bees after 1 week of their adult life.
