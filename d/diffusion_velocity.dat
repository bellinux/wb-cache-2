In this article, we propose an accurate, fast, direct and robust algorithm to compute multi-component <b>diffusion</b> <b>velocities.</b> To our knowledge, {{this is the first}} provably accurate algorithm (the solution can be obtained up to an arbitrary degree of precision) scaling at a computational complexity of O(N) in finite precision. The key idea involves leveraging the fact that the matrix of the reciprocal of the binary diffusivities, V, is low rank, with its rank being independent of the number of species involved. The low rank representation of matrix V is computed in a fast manner at a computational complexity of O(N) and the Sherman-Morrison-Woodbury formula is used to solve for the <b>diffusion</b> <b>velocities</b> at a computational complexity of O(N). Rigorous proofs and numerical benchmarks illustrate the low rank property of the matrix V and scaling of the algorithm. Comment: 16 pages, 7 figures, 1 table, 1 algorith...|$|R
