[...] It exempts [...] "transactional or relationship messages." [...] The FTC issued final rules (...) clarifying the phrase [...] "primary purpose" [...] on December 16, 2004. Previous state laws had used bulk (a number threshold), content (commercial), or unsolicited to define spam. The explicit restriction of the law to commercial e-mails is widely considered by those in the industry to essentially exempt purely political and religious e-mail from its specific requirements. Such non-commercial messages also have stronger First Amendment protection, as shown in Jaynes v. Commonwealth.|$|E

40|$|Clinical {{guidelines}} {{have been}} developed to assist with the management of patient care; however, these guidelines are frequently neglected in clinical practice. Computer-generated reminders enhance guideline use, but these systems often fail to achieve high rates of guideline utilization. This study was designed to test the hypothesis that computer-generated, individualized feedback regarding adherence to care guidelines will significantly improve clinician compliance with guideline recommendations presented through a computer-assisted management protocol. Half of the 45 primary care clinicians employed at a primary care clinic affiliated with an academic medical center, were randomized to receive a biweekly <b>electronic</b> <b>mail</b> <b>message</b> consisting of a computer-generated report summarizing his/her response to care guideline recommendations for the diabetic patients seen during the previous 2 weeks. Clinician compliance with guideline recommendations was the primary outcome measure. This study demonstrated that the intervention significantly increased clinician compliance with the guideline recommendations without incurring high maintenance expenses. Median compliance among the intervention group was 35 % versus 6. 1 % among the control group (p < 0. 01).

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{identify}} {{the reasons for}} seeking weight loss in overweight or obese but otherwise healthy men. DESIGN: Interviews, prior to intervention, with subjects who had volunteered {{to participate in a}} work-site-based weight loss study. SUBJECTS: Ninety-one overweight=obese male workers. Mean age 41, range 18 – 55 y, mean body mass index (BMI) 31. 0, range 26. 2 – 41. 6 kg=m 2. MEASUREMENTS: Anthropometric measurements; body weight and height. Body mass index calculated. A short interview using open questions to determine the individuals reason for seeking weight loss. RESULTS: The message that weight loss is beneficial to health for the overweight was recognized by all subjects regardless of BMI, and was reported as the main factor for attempting weight loss. Improved fitness and effects on appearance and well-being were reported half as often as the primary reason for weight loss. CONCLUSION: Overweight lay members of the public have accepted the health education message that weight loss can improve health. Overweight but otherwise healthy men who responded, of their own accord, to an <b>electronic</b> <b>mail</b> <b>message</b> offering help to lose weight did not regard obesity and overweight as primarily a cosmetic issue.

The feeling tended to be that they were excluded from the dialectic concerning their own lives. There was a feeling that for all the papers and conferences, little had been achieved here [in England] to improve the situation with regard to site provision and access to health and education.

40|$|This paper {{surveys the}} {{techniques}} currently known as {{safe and secure}} execution mechanisms for mobile objects. In this paper we distinguish safety and security in the following way. Safety means that illegal resource access is inhibited and handled in a systematic way. For example, in some programming languages, safe data structures are provided (such as lists in Lisp) to permit only safe operations {{to be applied to}} the data, or an exception handling mechanism is provided for the programmers to explicitly describe fault-handling. Security means to provide protection and integrity in the presence of malicious users. Notice that security subsumes safety. Encoding of an <b>electronic</b> <b>mail</b> <b>message</b> is atypical means of assuring secure communication. Thus, security issues can be divided into two sets: issues covered and not covered by safety. The former in general can be dealt with by preparing only mechanisms, while the latter can be dealt with by preparing both mechanisms and policies [19]. Often, a program that attacks security is designed not to violate safety, because if it did, it would be easily detected by the system. Thus, security maintenance always requires a security policy that draws a clear line between unsecure and secure things. The security maintenance mechanism watches and verifies every operation performed by a questionable object according to the given security policy...|$|E
40|$|Telehealth, also {{referred}} to as Telemedicine or E-Health, is a general term describing the delivery of medicine via digital means rather than an in-person situation. For psychotherapy counseling and mental health services, it has been called TeleMental-Health, TelePsychology, E-Counseling, E-Psychotherapy, TelePsychi-atry, Internet-based psychotherapy, TeleAnalysis, and similar names. TeleMentalHealth is generally de!ned as the use of the telephone, text, e-mail, chats, interactive tele-video-conferencing technologies, or virtual reality (VR) for the assessment and treatment of mental health disorders, mental health consultations and supervision, or the preven-tion of mental health disturbances. $e de!nitions of telehealth and telemedicine are still evolving and o#en vary among states, organiza-tions, licensing boards, and jurisdictions. For example, the California Business and Professions Code (Section 2290. 5) does not include phone and e-mail as part of tele-medicine. It states: 1. “Telemedicine ” means the practice of health care delivery, diagnosis, consultation, treat-ment, transfer of medical data, and educa-tion using interactive audio, video, or data communications. Neither a telephone con-versation nor an <b>electronic</b> <b>mail</b> <b>message</b> be-tween a health care practitioner and patient constitutes “telemedicine ” for purposes of this section. 2. “Interactive ” means an audio, video, or data communication involving a real time (syn-chronous) or near real time (asynchronous) two-way transfer of medical data and in-formation (California Business and Profes-sional Code, 2011).
