5|$|Balard found bromine {{chemicals}} in the ash of seaweed from the salt marshes of Montpellier. The seaweed was used to produce iodine, but also contained bromine. Balard distilled the bromine from a solution of seaweed ash saturated with chlorine. The properties of the resulting substance were intermediate between those of chlorine and iodine; thus he tried {{to prove that the}} substance was iodine monochloride (ICl), but after failing to do so he was sure that <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>found</b> <b>a</b> new element, and named it muride, derived from the Latin word muria for brine.|$|E

Later, May agrees to help Coulson find more information on the S.H.I.E.L.D. agent in question, who had been murdered. In an end tag, Coulson is denied access to his own death and recovery file.|$|E

5|$|A {{featured}} preliminary {{match on}} Turning Point's card {{was for the}} TNA X Division Championship, in which the champion, Petey Williams, defended the championship against Chris Sabin. The match was promoted for Turning Point on the November 12 episode of Impact!. In the weeks leading to the encounter, Sabin stated <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>found</b> <b>a</b> counter to Williams' finishing maneuver the Canadian Destroyer, which {{was thought to be}} uncounterable. The Canadian Destroyer involves Williams grabbing an opponent with his legs around their head, jumping over their back, causing them to perform a backflip, and forcing their head into the mat after they make the full rotation. Making true to his word, Sabin countered the move three times before Turning Point; one on the November 12, one of the November 19, and the last on the November 30 episodes of Impact!.|$|E
5|$|Stroheim {{was known}} to exaggerate events from his life and create myths about himself, such as his fictitious aristocratic origins and {{military}} record in Austria. He claimed that shortly after having moved to the US in the early 1910s, <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>found</b> <b>a</b> copy of McTeague in a motel in New York and had read it in one sitting. He also said that wanting to adapt the book inspired {{him to make a}} career in filmmaking. Georges Sadoul later stated that Stroheim had first read the novel in 1914, while living in poverty in Los Angeles.|$|E
5|$|Tyler {{appointed}} Abel P. Upshur, {{a popular}} Secretary of the Navy and close adviser, as his new Secretary of State, and nominated Gilmer to fill Upshur's former office. Tyler and Upshur began quiet {{negotiations with the}} Texas government, promising military protection from Mexico {{in exchange for a}} commitment to annexation. Secrecy was necessary, as the Constitution required congressional approval for such military commitments. Upshur planted rumors of possible British designs on Texas to garner support among Northern voters, who were wary of admitting a new pro-slavery state. By January 1844 Upshur told the Texas government that <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>found</b> <b>a</b> large majority of senators in favor of an annexation treaty. The republic remained skeptical, and finalization of the treaty took until the end of February.|$|E

5|$|The finder did not {{initially}} realise that <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>found</b> <b>a</b> Roman artefact and {{thought at first}} {{that it was a}} Victorian ornament. He eventually identified it as Roman by consulting auction catalogues, searching the Internet and getting advice from dealers. Find Liaison Officers from the Portable Antiquities Scheme were notified of the discovery and visited the findspot along with the finder. Christie's commissioned Darren Bradbury, an independent conservator and restorer, to restore the helmet and visor for sale. Although Christie's was asked to delay the restoration so that a full scientific examination could be carried out, this request was not granted and information about the helmet's burial may have been lost as a result. However, the British Museum was able to inspect the find during restoration and X-ray fluorescence spectrometry was carried out to determine the composition of the headpiece, visor and griffin. Bradbury's restoration work took some 240 hours and involved the repair of cracks and holes using resin and cyanoacrylate, retouched to match the appearance of the surrounding material.|$|E
5|$|In 1876 the {{zoologist}} Joel Asaph Allen {{discovered the}} remains of Canis mississippiensis (Allen 1876) and associated these with C.dirus (Leidy 1858) and Canis indianensis (Leidy 1869). As so little was found of these three specimens, Allen thought it best to leave each specimen listed under its provisional name until more material could be found to reveal their relationship. In 1908 the paleontologist John Campbell Merriam began retrieving numerous fossilized bone fragments of a large wolf from the Rancho LaBrea tar pits. By 1912 <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>found</b> <b>a</b> skeleton sufficiently complete {{to be able to}} formally recognize these and the previously found specimens under the name C.dirus (Leidy 1858). Because the rules of nomenclature stipulated that the name of a species should be the oldest name ever applied to it, Merriam therefore selected the name of Leidy's 1858 specimen, C.dirus. In 1915 the paleontologist Edward Troxell indicated his agreement with Merriam when he declared C.indianensis a synonym of C.dirus. In 1918, after studying these fossils, Merriam proposed consolidating their names under the separate genus Aenocyon (from Aenos, terrible and cyon, wolf) to become Aenocyon dirus, but not everyone agreed with this extinct wolf being placed in a new genus separate from the genus Canis. Canis ayersi (Sellards 1916) and Aenocyon dirus (Merriam 1918) were recognized as synonyms of C.dirus by the paleontologist Ernest Lundelius in 1972. All of the above taxa were declared synonyms of C.dirus in 1979, according to the paleontologist Ronald M. Nowak.|$|E

25|$|Dedekind's second {{contribution}} is his proof of Cantor's second theorem. Dedekind sent Cantor this proof in reply to Cantor's letter that announced the uncountability theorem and proved it using infinitely many sequences. Before Dedekind's proof arrived, Cantor wrote that <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>found</b> <b>a</b> simpler proof {{that did not}} use infinitely many sequences. So Cantor had a choice of proofs and chose to publish Dedekind's.|$|E
25|$|Upon {{returning}} to the Netherlands, Hudson reported that <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>found</b> <b>a</b> fertile land and an amicable people willing to engage his crew in small-scale bartering of furs, trinkets, clothes, and small manufactured goods.

This stimulated interest in exploiting this new trade resource, and it was the catalyst for Dutch merchant-traders to fund more expeditions.|$|E
