5|$|A {{local radio}} show {{schedules}} {{an interview with}} Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson) to discuss Dunder Mifflin, but, unbeknown to Dwight, the <b>interview</b> <b>is</b> later canceled. Jim Halpert (John Krasinski) suggests they all use this to their advantage, and stage an interview for Dwight's benefit. Dwight believes he is talking to the interviewer through {{the phone in the}} break room, but is actually talking to Nellie Bertram (Catherine Tate) who is using an American accent. They convince him that the information he is giving leads to a hostage situation with CEO David Wallace (Andy Buckley) cornered in his house. Dwight calls David and tries to talk him into surrendering to the police. David is confused but nonetheless responds in a way that leads Dwight to believe he was successful. He emerges from the break room and is greeted by a round of applause from his coworkers.|$|E
25|$|UPPS-R <b>Interview</b> <b>is</b> a semi-structured {{interview}} that measures {{the degree to}} which individuals exhibit the various components of impulsivity assessed by the UPPS-P.|$|E
25|$|Clinical {{observation}} – Clinical {{psychologists are}} also trained {{to gather data}} by observing behavior. The clinical <b>interview</b> <b>is</b> {{a vital part of}} assessment, even when using other formalized tools, which can employ either a structured or unstructured format. Such assessment looks at certain areas, such as general appearance and behavior, mood and affect, perception, comprehension, orientation, insight, memory, and content of communication. One psychiatric example of a formal <b>interview</b> <b>is</b> the mental status examination, which is often used in psychiatry as a screening tool for treatment or further testing.|$|E
50|$|No <b>interviews</b> <b>are</b> required, {{although}} <b>interviews</b> <b>are</b> {{offered and}} can help.|$|R
30|$|All of the <b>interviews</b> <b>were</b> recorded. In four cases, <b>interviews</b> <b>were</b> {{conducted}} by two interviewers, allowing field note comparison to aid understanding and internal {{validity of the}} study. In all other cases, <b>interviews</b> <b>were</b> undertaken by the same single interviewer. The researchers followed an iterative approach to data collection (Strauss and Corbin, 1990), jointly reflecting on each interview before subsequent <b>interviews</b> <b>were</b> undertaken.|$|R
50|$|The {{method of}} {{interviewing}} in the PSID {{has changed over}} time. Until 1972, <b>interviews</b> <b>were</b> done in person using paper, but after 1973 phone <b>interviews</b> <b>were</b> used. Starting in 1993, <b>interviews</b> <b>were</b> conducted using Computer Assisted Telephone (CAT) technology.|$|R
25|$|A second PCC tram, 7126, {{serves as}} a mobile studio for the Le Tram {{television}} programme broadcast by BX1 (formerly Télé Bruxelles) every other Sunday, during which an <b>interview</b> <b>is</b> conducted while the tram tours Brussels. The tram tows a generator trailer.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to core prerequisites, the Dental Admission Test, a multiple choice standardized exam, is also required for potential dental students. The DAT is usually {{taken during the}} spring semester of one's junior year. The vast majority of dental schools require an interview before admissions can be granted. The <b>interview</b> <b>is</b> designed to evaluate the motivation, character, and personality of the applicant. It is often a crucial step in the admissions process.|$|E
25|$|Penn Jillette {{has stated}} that those being interviewed know what show the <b>interview</b> <b>is</b> for and its purpose. One episode shows a video crew from the show going into a {{building}} to perform an interview, and Jillette points out that {{a member of the}} crew is wearing a Penn & Teller: Bullshit! baseball cap. Opponents are then interviewed and they offer rebuttals to the proponents' arguments. These are usually experts, celebrities, or sometimes speakers from the Center for Inquiry, the James Randi Educational Foundation, or the Cato Institute.|$|E
30|$|Participant <b>interviews</b> <b>were</b> {{conducted}} between December 2012 and February 2014. <b>Interviews</b> <b>were</b> {{performed in}} a quiet, closed room in a hospital or hotel, with no other person present. Participants <b>were</b> <b>interviewed</b> once, with interviews lasting 50 – 90  min. The six semi-structured <b>interviews</b> <b>were</b> based on a loose structure comprising open-ended questions, and were conducted according to the methodological orientation of Sandelowski (2000). <b>Interviews</b> <b>were</b> face-to-face and performed by a professional interviewer who first introduced herself and obtained written informed consent.|$|R
30|$|During this study, {{an initial}} pre-course TBI was {{conducted}} 5  months {{prior to the}} semester to determine instructor M’s initial beliefs about teaching and learning. A second mid-course <b>interview</b> <b>was</b> conducted 5  weeks into the course after the first exam. A third end-of-course <b>interview</b> <b>was</b> conducted immediately after {{the last day of}} classes, and a final post-course <b>interview</b> <b>was</b> completed 1  month after the semester ended. All <b>interviews</b> <b>were</b> conducted and transcribed by the PI, and <b>interviews</b> <b>were</b> co-coded by the PI and a peer. Inter-rater reliability analysis performed using the Cohen Kappa statistic determined substantial agreement (k[*]=[*] 0.643, p[*]<[*] 0.001) between coders. It should be noted that no attempt was made to coach instructor M into more student-centered beliefs during the study. Discussions that could possibly lead to student-centered answers on the TBI were avoided throughout the project. Additionally, <b>interviews</b> <b>were</b> not transcribed, coded, and scored until after the final <b>interview</b> <b>was</b> complete.|$|R
50|$|His <b>interviews</b> <b>were</b> {{broadcast}} in NTV, in Channel I Europe, Takveer TV and LBTV24. His <b>interview</b> <b>was</b> {{published in the}} Dailiy Ittefaq.|$|R
25|$|Descriptive {{experience}} sampling (DES), {{developed by}} psychologist Russel Hurlburt. This is an idiographic method {{that is used}} to help examine inner experiences. This method relies on an introspective technique that allows an individual's inner experiences and characteristics to be described and measured. A beep notifies the subject to record their experience at that exact moment and 24 hours later an <b>interview</b> <b>is</b> given based on all the experiences recorded. DES has been used in subjects that have been diagnosed with schizophrenia and depression. It has also been crucial to studying the inner experiences of those who have been diagnosed with common psychiatric diseases.|$|E
25|$|In Order of the Phoenix, Hermione blackmails Rita Skeeter into {{writing an}} article about Harry's {{encounter}} with Voldemort. The <b>interview</b> <b>is</b> published by Xenophilius, and he later sells it to the Daily Prophet for a good price (enough to finance an expedition to Sweden to hunt for the Crumple-Horned Snorkack). In Deathly Hallows, Xenophilius continues to support Harry in his magazine until his daughter Luna gets kidnapped to silence him. Harry, Ron, and Hermione visit Xenophilius for information but discover that the latest issue features an anti-Harry story on the cover. Following Voldemort's ultimate defeat, the Quibbler goes back to its condition of advanced lunacy and becomes popular, still being appreciated for its unintentional humour.|$|E
25|$|The {{weather is}} {{reported}} every half-hour during the program's first three hours, though since Al Roker {{took over as}} weather reporter, an <b>interview</b> <b>is</b> conducted by him {{in place of the}} national weather forecast at least once during the show, leaving only the local weather inserts by NBC stations. Today weather reporters have included Bob Ryan (1978–1980); Willard Scott (1980–1996); and Al Roker (1996–present). Until Ryan's hiring, no one on the show had practical experience or academic credentials in meteorology. Since NBC's purchase of The Weather Channel in 2008, personnel from that network frequently participate in Today forecast segments, at the site of a weather event or from the cable channel's suburban Atlanta headquarters, or as a fill-in for Roker.|$|E
30|$|Qualitative, in-depth, semi-structured <b>interviews</b> <b>were</b> {{conducted}} {{consistent with}} qualitative research designs (Minichellio, Aroni, Timewell & Alexander, 1990; Rubin & Rubin, 1995). Seventeen <b>interviews</b> <b>were</b> conducted by telephone {{and one was}} conducted face-to-face, between January and April 2012. One of the authors, a qualified social worker, conducted the interviews. Due to the sensitive nature of topics discussed, the length of each <b>interview</b> <b>was</b> determined by individual participants (Rubin & Rubin, 1995), with most interviews lasting between 45 and 60 minutes. The <b>interviews</b> <b>were</b> guided by an interview schedule containing broad themes as prompts (Minichellio et al., 1990, Neuman, 2011). <b>Interviews</b> <b>were</b> digitally recorded and later professionally transcribed.|$|R
30|$|All <b>interviews</b> <b>were</b> {{recorded}} and transcribed. We also took notes about participants’ reactions to specific questions. The <b>interviews</b> <b>were</b> conducted {{according to the}} availability of the participants.|$|R
50|$|Since 2011, {{more than}} 4,000 {{face-to-face}} <b>interviews</b> <b>were</b> conducted. Each <b>interview</b> <b>was</b> personalized according to languages or dialects the participant preferred, including English, Mandarin, Cantonese, Toishanese, and Teochew.|$|R
25|$|In November 1916, she was {{travelling}} by steamer from Spain {{when her}} ship called at the British port of Falmouth. There {{she was arrested}} and brought to London where she was interrogated at length by Sir Basil Thomson, Assistant Commissioner at New Scotland Yard in charge of counter-espionage. He gave an account of this in his 1922 book Queer People, saying that she eventually admitted to working for the Deuxième Bureau. Initially detained in Cannon Street police station, she was then released and stayed at the Savoy Hotel. A full transcript of the <b>interview</b> <b>is</b> in Britain's National Archives and was broadcast, with Mata Hari played by Eleanor Bron, on the independent station LBC in 1980. It is unclear if she lied on this occasion, believing the story made her sound more intriguing, or if French authorities were using her {{in such a way}} but would not acknowledge her due to the embarrassment and international backlash it could cause.|$|E
25|$|Linguistic {{analysis}} is a sub-discipline of applied linguistics {{used by many}} governments to verify the claimed nationality of people seeking asylum who do not hold the necessary documentation to prove their claim. This often {{takes the form of}} an interview by personnel in an immigration department. Depending on the country, this <b>interview</b> <b>is</b> conducted either in the asylum seeker's native language through an interpreter or in an international lingua franca like English. Australia uses the former method, while Germany employs the latter; the Netherlands uses either method depending on the languages involved. Tape recordings of the interview then undergo language analysis, which can be done either by private contractors or within a department of the government. In this analysis, linguistic features of the asylum seeker are used by analysts to make a determination about the speaker's nationality. The reported findings of the linguistic analysis can {{play a critical role in}} the government's decision on the refugee status of the asylum seeker.|$|E
25|$|Most {{applicants}} who {{are called}} for interview {{will have been}} predicted at least three A-grade A-level qualifications relevant to their chosen undergraduate course, or the equivalent in other qualifications, such as getting at least 7,7,6 for higher-level subjects at IB. The A* A-level grade (introduced in 2010) now plays {{a part in the}} acceptance of applications, with the university's standard offer for most courses being set at A*AA, with A*A*A for sciences courses. Due to a very high proportion of applicants receiving the highest school grades, the interview process is crucial for distinguishing between the most able candidates. The <b>interview</b> <b>is</b> performed by College Fellows, who evaluate candidates on unexamined factors such as potential for original thinking and creativity. For exceptional candidates, a Matriculation Offer is sometimes offered, requiring only two A-levels at grade E or above. In 2006, 5,228 students who were rejected went on to get 3 A levels or more at grade A, representing about 63% of all applicants rejected.|$|E
30|$|Fifteen {{individual}} semi-structured, face-to-face {{or telephone}} <b>interviews</b> <b>were</b> conducted with key stakeholders (8 patients, 7 staff members) {{to evaluate the}} ease of Standard Set implementation, and explore barriers and enablers to successful implementation and future sustainability. The study team developed the interview schedules including prompt questions (Additional file  1). All qualitative data collection was conducted by BC between May and August 2017. The <b>interviews</b> <b>were</b> electronically recorded to facilitate verbatim transcription of the data. Each patient <b>interview</b> <b>was,</b> on average, 6  min in duration and the other stakeholder <b>interviews</b> <b>were,</b> on average, 12  min in duration.|$|R
30|$|The {{pilot study}} began by formulating the main {{research}} themes, which {{were derived from}} the project’s strategic goals. These themes were used during the pilot interview round. In thematic <b>interviews</b> there <b>were</b> 14 experts who <b>were</b> <b>interviewed.</b> All the <b>interviews</b> <b>were</b> performed face to face. Pilot <b>interviews</b> <b>were</b> summarized and reported in a memo document.|$|R
50|$|Applications for The Amazing Race 6 {{were due}} on April 13, 2004. Semi-finalist <b>interviews</b> <b>were</b> held in May 2004 and final casting <b>interviews</b> <b>were</b> {{selected}} at Los Angeles in June 2004.|$|R
25|$|The {{process of}} reuniting the District of Columbia {{with the state}} of Maryland is {{referred}} to as retrocession. The District was originally formed out of parts of both Maryland and Virginia which they had ceded to the Congress. However, Virginia's portion was returned to that state in 1846; all the land in present-day D.C. was once part of Maryland. If both the Congress and the Maryland state legislature agreed, jurisdiction over the District of Columbia could be returned to Maryland, possibly excluding a small tract of land immediately surrounding the United States Capitol, the White House and the Supreme Court building. If the District were returned to Maryland, citizens in D.C. would gain voting representation in the Congress as residents of Maryland. One problem with any of these proposals, according to one Virginia Republican in a 1999 <b>interview,</b> <b>is</b> that the state of Maryland does not currently want to take the District back. Further, although the U.S. Constitution does not specify a minimum size for the District, retrocession may require a constitutional amendment, as the District's role as the seat of government is mandated by the Constitution's District Clause. Retrocession could also alter the idea of a separate national capital as envisioned by the Founding Fathers. It may also violate the Twenty-third Amendment to the United States Constitution's granting of votes in the electoral college, as they would still be constitutionally granted to the district.|$|E
500|$|Frusciante {{also contributed}} {{music to the}} {{documentary}} film, Little Joe, based upon Joe Dallesandro. In 2009, Frusciante appeared in the documentary, [...] "The Heart is a Drum Machine." [...] His full-length, forty-five-minute <b>interview</b> <b>is</b> available in the special features of the DVD release.|$|E
500|$|The <b>Interview</b> <b>is</b> a 2014 American action comedy film {{produced}} {{and directed by}} Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg in their second directorial work, following This Is the End (2013). The screenplay is by Dan Sterling, based upon a story he co-authored with Rogen and Goldberg. The film stars Rogen and James Franco as journalists who set up an interview with North Korean leader Kim Jong-un (Randall Park), and are recruited by the CIA to assassinate him. The film is also heavily inspired by a Vice documentary which was shot in 2012.|$|E
50|$|Each show {{typically}} {{consists of}} two guests. Harris interviews her guests in person. Most of her <b>interviews</b> <b>are</b> conducted in a studio in New York City, but some are recorded “on the road” while Jessica is traveling to another state or country. On occasion, <b>interviews</b> <b>are</b> remotely recorded. The style of the <b>interviews</b> <b>is</b> very conversational. Guests paint a personal picture of their experiences through anecdotes.|$|R
30|$|The <b>interviews</b> <b>were</b> semistructured {{covering}} {{issues related}} to the different phases of the care process and how they were experienced, what kind of support and guidance would have been necessary in each phase and also about the changes in lifestyle after getting sick. The <b>interviews</b> <b>were</b> conducted by nursing students and therefore the <b>interview</b> form <b>was</b> detailed to guarantee consistent interviews with several student interviewers. The students made notes either on paper or directly to an electronic form. None of the <b>interviews</b> <b>was</b> recorded nor transcribed verbatim.|$|R
30|$|Semi-structured <b>{{interviews}}</b> <b>were</b> also conducted, {{but these}} interviews {{differed from the}} interviews given after the first survey, in that these <b>interviews</b> <b>were</b> only given {{to those who had}} used the mobile and ubiquitous system. In addition, these interviews differed as they were aimed at gathering qualitative data surrounding the use of the ubiquitous system itself, whereas the first round of semi-structured <b>interviews</b> <b>were</b> aimed at understanding acculturation difficulties in more depth.|$|R
500|$|Millennium Group members Frank Black (Lance Henriksen) and Peter Watts (Terry O'Quinn) {{examine the}} crime scene. Black is skeptical when Watts notes that similar killings have {{occurred}} in the past, believing it is simply an urban legend. However, an inmate at the psychiatric hospital nearby was committed for similar murders. Unconvinced that he could have escaped, the pair nevertheless visit the facility. They meet Dr. Ellen Stoller (Melinda McGraw), who reluctantly assists them in interviewing their suspect, E. Jacob Woodcock. Woodcock admits the killing fits his methods, but denies involvement. The <b>interview</b> <b>is</b> terminated when two inmates begin fighting.|$|E
500|$|Another <b>interview</b> <b>is</b> with a Wichita, Kansas {{woman named}} Angie who was prostituted with another girl, Melissa, in the American Midwest {{when they were}} teenagers. Angie recounts how they were {{expected}} to have sex with truck drivers and steal their money. She describes an incident when, after Melissa found pictures of a man's grandchildren in his wallet, they realized he was old enough to be their own grandfather. [...] "I wanted to die," [...] she says, close to tears. Outside the film, Bilheimer said that Angie's trafficker expected her to engage in forty sex acts a night, and threatened to kill her if she refused. [...] "It's not just truck drivers," [...] FBI agent Mike Beaver says. [...] "We're seeing them purchased and abused by both white collar and blue collar individuals." [...] This statement segues into a Washington, D.C., scene wherein two girls in their early teens are shown by a curb on K Street, changing into prostitutes' attire.|$|E
500|$|In an interview, King {{described}} [...] "Chasing Death" [...] {{as being}} about alcoholism: [...] "it's {{like people who}} drink too much. They don't help themselves out so they're chasing death." [...] He explained [...] "Implode" [...] as being {{about the end of}} the world. The album could feature material written by Hanneman prior to his passing. Araya has explained that Hanneman had two songs that he submitted to the rest of the band. One song was an outtake from World Painted Blood, which Araya said that he and Hanneman had been working on melody and lyrics for. Additionally, Araya has said that he plans to go through Hanneman's personal audio files, and that some of that material could also find its way onto the new album in one form or another. One song, mentioned by King in an <b>interview,</b> <b>is</b> [...] "Piano Wire," [...] an unfinished track that Hanneman had been working on for the previous album. King also mentioned that there were two other songs that Hanneman had been holding onto for the last 15 to 20 years that will be released.|$|E
30|$|Semi-structured <b>interviews</b> <b>were</b> {{employed}} between February and mid-March 2014. From each of {{the four}} companies, the member of personnel who had completed the large-scale survey <b>was</b> contacted. <b>Interview</b> questions <b>were</b> sent to the practitioners 3 – 5  days in advance to allow them time to prepare their answers to the interview questions. The average duration of each <b>interview</b> <b>was</b> one and a half hours. All <b>interviews</b> <b>were</b> digitally recorded, and field notes were also used to collect information during the interview. The voice recordings of the <b>interviews</b> <b>were</b> later transcribed into Thai and then translated into English. A case study database was developed and used for visualising the data and for developing tables and matrices containing various views used in the case study analysis.|$|R
40|$|A {{series of}} {{personal}} <b>interviews</b> <b>were</b> carried out following {{on from the}} Project StORe questionnaire. Of the original 46 Biochemistry respondents, 11 {{indicated that they would}} be willing to <b>be</b> <b>interviewed.</b> Each potential interviewee was contacted during May 2006 and 10 <b>interviews</b> in total <b>were</b> conducted during June and July 2006. Of these, 5 <b>were</b> telephone <b>interviews</b> and 5 <b>were</b> conducted face-to-face. Each <b>interview</b> <b>was</b> with a single individual apart from the final face-to-face <b>interview,</b> which <b>was</b> conducted with two members of a research laboratory. Here we present the anonymous transcript in full...|$|R
30|$|The MLD Foundation {{identified}} and contacted potential qualifying caregivers for the cognitive debriefing <b>interviews,</b> which <b>were</b> {{conducted in the}} caregiver’s hometown. The same eligibility criteria as the concept elicitation <b>interviews</b> <b>were</b> utilized for the cognitive debriefing interviews. Each 1.5 -h <b>interview</b> <b>was</b> conducted in person by two experienced interviewers using a semi-structured interview guide.|$|R
