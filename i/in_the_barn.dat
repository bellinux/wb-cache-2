40|$|Organic {{dust and}} {{endotoxins}} can cause respiratory health problems for farmers and cattle. The {{aim of this}} study was to determine the exposure of dust and endotoxin with different kinds of bedding material <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>barns.</b> <b>The</b> different kinds of bedding were rubber mats and a thin layer of saw dust and deep litter with a layer of ten centimeters of sawdust. Sampling took place with agarplates to measure the concentration of all the bacteria and fungi. Persons working <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>barns</b> were equipped with air samplers. For the personnel samples the level of dust intake was twice as much by rubber mats (GM: 0, 928 mg/m 3) as by deep litter(saw dust) (GM: 0, 450 mg/m 3). The level of endotoxin intake was also twice as much with rubber mats (GM: 342, 749 EU/m 3) than with deep litter (GM: 162, 878 EU/m 3). For the stationary samples the level of production of dust was almost equal for the different kinds of bedding. The level of production of endotoxin <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>barns</b> was 150...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} was the study of the {{relationship}} between the air ammonia concentration and <b>the</b> bedding hygiene <b>in</b> dairy cow barns with different housing systems.

5|$|In North America {{and most}} of Europe, voles predominate in the diet and shrews are {{the second most common}} food choice. Mice and rats form the main {{foodstuffs}} in the Mediterranean region, the tropics, sub-tropics and Australia. Barn owls are usually more specialist feeders in productive areas and generalists in drier areas. On the Cape Verde Islands, geckos are the mainstay of the diet, supplemented by birds such as plovers, godwits, turnstones, weavers and pratincoles, and on a rocky islet off the coast of California, a clutch of four young were being reared on a diet of Leach's storm petrel (Oceanodroma leucorhoa). In Ireland, the accidental introduction of the bank vole in the 1950s led to a major shift <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>barn</b> owl's diet: where their ranges overlap, the vole is now by far the largest prey item. Locally superabundant rodent species in the weight class of several grams per individual usually make up the single largest proportion of prey. In the United States, rodents and other small mammals usually make up ninety-five percent of the diet and worldwide, over ninety percent of the prey caught.|$|E
5|$|The {{land where}} the Glidden House stands once held a log structure, which Glidden lived {{in when he}} first came to DeKalb at the beckoning of his cousin Russell Huntley. The house was built in 1861 for barbed wire {{entrepreneur}} Joseph Farwell Glidden. As his personal residence, the house, and its accompanying barn, were closely associated with his invention, really just an improvement, of barbed wire. Glidden's improvement upon a wire board fence developed by Henry Rose was of vast importance in the settlement of the United States west of the Mississippi. It was after Glidden saw Rose exhibit his wire at a fair in 1873 that he was struck with the idea of attaching barbs to wire strand fencing. Glidden is said to have experimented with some of his ideas in the basement kitchen of the Glidden House. He noticed that whenever he tried to attach s directly to strands of wire they slid {{along the length of the}} wire; Glidden realized he needed a way to crimp the barbs. He began tinkering around the home's kitchen. Glidden fit two hair pins to the shaft of a coffee mill, one centered and the other off-center. He found that by placing the wire between the pins and turning the crank a uniform barb resulted. How to crimp the barbs to the wire was solved, <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>barn,</b> by tying one end of the wire and another length of wire to a poplar tree on the grounds of the Glidden House and the other ends of the wires to a grindstone. The grindstone was used to twist the wires together and prevent the barbs from slipping.|$|E

40|$|Livestock-associated methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (LA-MRSA) {{is highly}} {{prevalent}} in pigs and veal calves. The environment and air in pig and veal calf barns is often contaminated with LA-MRSA, and {{can act as}} a transmission source for humans. This study explores exposure-response relationships between sequence type 398 (ST 398) MRSA air exposure level and nasal ST 398 MRSA carriage in people working and/or living on farms. Samples and data were used from three longitudinal field studies in pig and veal calf farm populations. Samples consisted of nasal swabs from the human participants and electrostatic dust fall collectors capturing airborne settled dust in barns. In both multivariate and mutually adjusted analyses, a strong association was found between nasal ST 398 MRSA carriage in people working <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>barns</b> for > 20 h per week and MRSA air levels. In people working <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>barns</b> < 20 h per week there was a strong association between nasal carriage and number of working hours. Exposure to ST 398 MRSA in barn air seems to be an important determinant for nasal carriage, especially <b>in</b> <b>the</b> highly exposed group of farmers, next to duration of contact with animals. Intervention measures should therefore probably also target reduction of ST 398 MRSA air levels. </p...|$|R
