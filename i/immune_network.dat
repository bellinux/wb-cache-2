25|$|A {{theoretical}} framework explaining {{the workings of}} the adaptive immune system is provided by <b>immune</b> <b>network</b> theory, based on interactions between idiotypes (unique molecular features of one clonotype, i.e. the unique set of antigenic determinants of the variable portion of an antibody) and 'anti-idiotypes' (antigen receptors that react with the idiotype {{as if it were a}} foreign antigen). This theory, which builds on the existing clonal selection hypothesis and since 1974 has been developed mainly by Niels Jerne and Geoffrey W. Hoffmann, is seen as being relevant to the understanding of the HIV pathogenesis and the search for an HIV vaccine.|$|E

5000|$|The word [...] "idiotype" [...] became {{influential}} in immunology when Niels Jerne formulated his <b>immune</b> <b>network</b> theory. Jerne {{was awarded the}} Nobel Prize for Medicine or Physiology in 1984 largely for being the father of <b>immune</b> <b>network</b> theory. He defined idiotype as the set of epitopes on the V region of an antibody molecule, where epitope means an antigenic determinant. He also defined the [...] "paratope" [...] to be that part of an antibody variable region that binds to an antigen. The best developed version of <b>immune</b> <b>network</b> theory is called the symmetrical network theory, in which the distinction between idiotype and paratope plays no role.|$|E
40|$|Hoffmann (1982) {{analysed}} a {{very simple}} model of suppressive idiotypic <b>immune</b> <b>networks</b> and showed that idiotypic interactions are stabilizing. He concluded that <b>immune</b> <b>networks</b> provide a counterexample to the general analysis of large dynamic systems (Gardner and Ashby, 1970; May, 1972). The latter is often verbalized as: an increase in size and/or connectivity decreases the system stability. We here analyse this apparent contradiction by extending the Hoffmann model (with a decay term), and comparing it to an ecological model that {{was used as a}} paradigm in the general analysis. Our analysis confirms that the neighbourhood stability of such idiotypic networks increases with connectivity and/or size. However, the contradiction is one of interpretation, and is not due to exceptional properties of <b>immune</b> <b>networks.</b> The contradiction is caused by the awkward normalization used in the general analysis...|$|R

The objective {{of this research is}} to introduce a new model for artificial <b>immune</b> <b>networks</b> that adopts features from other biological successful models to overcome its complexity such as the artificial neural networks. Common concepts between the two systems were investigated to design a simple, yet a robust, model of artificial <b>immune</b> <b>networks.</b> Three artificial neural networks learning models were available to choose from in the research design: supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning models. However, {{it was found that the}} reinforcement model is the most suitable model. Research results examined network parameters, and appropriate relations between concentration ranges and their dependent parameters as well as the expected reward during network learning. In conclusion, it is recommended the use of the designed model by other researchers in different applications such as controlling robots in hazardous environment to save human lives as well as using it on image retrieval in general to help the police department identify suspects...|$|R

40|$|The urban {{landscape}} is dynamic and complex. As improved remote sensing data {{in terms of}} spatial and spectral characteristics became available, more sophisticated methods have been adopted for urban applications. This study proposed and evaluated a classification model incorporating feature selection, artificial <b>immune</b> <b>networks</b> and parameter optimization. Information gain, a broadly applied feature selection metric used in data mining techniques such as decision trees, was used for feature selection. Two types of information gain binary-class entropy and multiple-class entropy - were investigated. Artificial <b>immune</b> <b>networks</b> have been recently applied to remote sensing classification and have been proven useful especially when multiple parameters of the networks are optimized through a genetic algorithm.

50|$|Some {{parts of}} an {{antibody}} {{have the same}} functions. The arms of the Y, for example, contain the sites that can bind to antigens (in general, identical) and, therefore, recognize specific foreign objects. This region of the antibody is called the Fab (fragment, antigen-binding) region. It is composed of one constant and one variable domain from each heavy and light chain of the antibody.The paratope is shaped at the amino terminal end of the antibody monomer by the variable domains from the heavy and light chains. The variable domain is {{also referred to as}} the FV region and is the most important region for binding to antigens. To be specific, variable loops of β-strands, there each on the light (VL) and heavy (VH) chains are responsible for binding to the antigen. These loops are referred to as the complementarity determining regions (CDRs).The structures of these CDRs have been clustered and classified by Chothia et al.and more recently by North et al.and Nikoloudis et al.In the framework of the <b>immune</b> <b>network</b> theory, CDRs are also called idiotypes.
