5|$|The grey-headed <b>flying</b> <b>fox</b> (Pteropus poliocephalus) is a megabat {{native to}} Australia. The species shares {{mainland}} Australia {{with three other}} members of the genus Pteropus: the little red <b>flying</b> <b>fox</b> (P. scapulatus), the spectacled <b>flying</b> <b>fox</b> (P. conspicillatus), and the black <b>flying</b> <b>fox</b> (P. alecto).|$|E
5|$|A 1988 {{field study}} found that most flowers of B.serrata opened at night, and {{recorded}} the brown antechinus (Antechinus stuartii), sugar glider (Petaurus breviceps), eastern pygmy possum (Cercartetus nanus), and bush rat (Rattus fuscipes) as nocturnal mammalian visitors and pollinators. Other mammals recorded eating the flowers include the grey-headed <b>flying</b> <b>fox</b> (Pteropus poliocephalus), little red <b>flying</b> <b>fox</b> (P. scapulatus) and common blossom bat (Syconycteris australis). Banksia serrata is a host plant for the larval and adult stages of the banksia jewel beetle (Cyrioides imperialis). Native bees and European honey bees visit the flowers.|$|E
5|$|The {{fruit is}} {{consumed}} by many bird species including the rose-crowned fruit-dove (Ptilinopus regina), wompoo fruit-dove (P. magnificus), wonga pigeon (Leucosarcia melanoleuca), topknot pigeon (Lopholaimus antarcticus), Pacific koel (Eudynamys orientalis), Australasian swamphen (Porphyrio melanotus), Australian king parrot (Alisterus scapularis), Australasian figbird (Sphecotheres vieilloti), green catbird (Ailuroedus crassirostris), regent bowerbird (Sericulus chrysocephalus), satin bowerbird (Ptilonorhynchus violaceus) and pied currawong (Strepera graculina), {{as well as}} the mammalian grey-headed <b>flying</b> <b>fox</b> (Pteropus poliocephalus), and spectacled <b>flying</b> <b>fox</b> (Pteropus conspicillatus). It is one of several plant species used as food by the endangered Coxen's fig parrot. Many fruits drop onto the ground around the tree, though others are dispersed by animals that eat them.|$|E
50|$|Ross Creek is also {{famous as}} a {{breeding}} ground for colonies of <b>flying</b> <b>foxes.</b> The mangroves provide a permanent home for approximately 2,000 black <b>flying</b> <b>foxes</b> (Pteropus alecto), as well as a seasonal camp for several hundred thousand little red <b>flying</b> <b>foxes</b> (Pteropus scapulatus).|$|R
40|$|In {{response}} to a recent finding of antibodies reactive with equine morbillivirus in four species of <b>flying</b> <b>foxes,</b> people who had close association with <b>flying</b> <b>foxes</b> were tested for antibodies to the virus. One hundred and twenty-eight bat carers were tested, none of whom had detectable antibodies. As people who had regular contact with <b>flying</b> <b>foxes</b> were targeted in this study, {{the majority of the}} subjects had considerable histories of contact with <b>flying</b> <b>foxes,</b> including scratches and bites. These findings suggest that neither prolonged close contact nor casual contact with <b>flying</b> <b>foxes</b> engenders a risk of equine morbillivirus infection in humans.

50|$|Although an algae eater, <b>flying</b> <b>foxes</b> {{are also}} known to consume {{food in the}} form of flakes, wafers and tablets. Being omnivorous, {{vegetables}} such as spinach, zucchini and lettuce, as well as live planarians, tubifex worms, crustaceans and other aquatic insects are normally offered to <b>flying</b> <b>foxes.</b> Oatmeal is also served to <b>flying</b> <b>foxes.</b> It does not consume red algae.|$|R
5|$|The grey-headed <b>flying</b> <b>fox</b> is {{long-lived}} for a mammal of its size. Individuals reportedly {{survived in}} captivity {{for up to}} 23 years, and a maximum age of up to 15 years seems possible in the wild.|$|E
5|$|Mammal species {{consist of}} hog deer (C. porcinus), wild boar (Sus scrota), large Indian civets (Viverra civetta, Viverricula indica), common otter (Lutra lutra), fox, jungle cat, Asian golden cat, bay bamboo rat, musk shrew, common shrew, <b>flying</b> <b>fox,</b> and sambar (Cervus unicolor).|$|E

40|$|Many {{tropical}} plants {{depend on}} seed dispersal by animals for their natural regeneration. Our results reveal {{that in the}} Pendjari Region, Benin (West Africa), fruits of shea trees (Vitellaria paradoxa) constitute a key resource for <b>flying</b> <b>foxes</b> (Chiroptera: Pteropodidae). Furthermore, handling of Vitellaria seeds by <b>flying</b> <b>foxes</b> can {{lead to an increase}} in germination success. We propose that seed dispersal by <b>flying</b> <b>foxes</b> is crucial for the long-term maintenance of this socio-eco-nomically important tree, which is not yet cultivated by local populations in traditional agroforestry systems...|$|R

500|$|Most {{vegetation}} {{communities on}} which this species forages produce nectar and pollen seasonally and are abundant unpredictably, so the <b>flying</b> <b>fox's</b> migration traits cope with this. The time when <b>flying</b> <b>foxes</b> leave their roosts to feed depends on foraging light and predation risk. Flying foxes have more time and light when foraging if they leave their roosts early in the day. The entire colony may leave later if a predatory bird is present, while lactating females leave earlier. With males, the bachelors leave earlier than harem-holding males, which guard their wait until all their females have left. The <b>flying</b> <b>foxes</b> that leave the roost earlier are more vulnerable to predation, and some other <b>flying</b> <b>foxes</b> will wait for others to leave, a phenomenon labelled the [...] "after you" [...] effect.|$|R
5|$|In {{the center}} of the complex is an open stage, a craft center, and a pendopo for special events. This has {{included}} weddings, colouring contests, training sessions, and seminars. A variety of activities and facilities are available onsite, including ATVs, <b>flying</b> <b>fox,</b> jet skis, and fishing. Boats leave from a dock and travel through a canal to Lake Rawa Pening.|$|E
5|$|The double-eyed fig parrot (Cyclopsitta diophthalma) {{eats the}} fruit of Ficus obliqua, {{steadily}} depositing fruity detritus on the ground. The rainbow lorikeet (Trichoglossus moluccanus) is another parrot that consumes the fruit and disperses the seeds; other Australian bird species include the southern cassowary (Casuarius casuarius), brown cuckoo-dove (Macropygia phasianella), rose-crowned fruit dove (Ptilinopus regina), wompoo fruit dove (P. magnificus), wonga pigeon (Leucosarcia melanoleuca), topknot pigeon (Lopholaimus antarcticus), silvereye (Zosterops lateralis), pied currawong (Strepera graculina), black-faced cuckoo-shrike (Coracina novaehollandae), olive-backed oriole (Oriolus sagittatus), Australasian figbird (Sphecotheres vieilloti), green catbird (Ailuroedus crassirostris), regent bowerbird (Sericulus chrysocephalus), satin bowerbird (Ptilonorhynchus violaceus), and Lewin's honeyeater (Meliphaga lewinii). The tree is an important food source for the western Polynesian species the many-coloured fruit dove (Ptilinopus perousii) and crimson-crowned fruit dove (P. porphyraceus), and has been recommended for amenity planting in Tonga for these birds. The spectacled <b>flying</b> <b>fox</b> (Pteropus conspicillatus) and grey-headed <b>flying</b> <b>fox</b> (Pteropus poliocephalus) also eat the fruit.|$|E
5|$|The grey-headed <b>flying</b> <b>fox</b> is {{endemic to}} the {{south-eastern}} forested areas of Australia, principally {{east of the}} Great Dividing Range. Its range extends approximately from Bundaberg in Queensland to Geelong in Victoria, with outlying colonies in Ingham and Finch Hatton in the north, and in Adelaide in the south. In the southern parts of its range it occupies more extreme latitudes than any other Pteropus species.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Long-term {{tracking}} of small-size animals with {{wireless sensor networks}} remains a challenge as only limited energy harvesting and storage is possible due to stringent size and weight constraints for animal collars. We present first experiences towards a perpetual monitoring system for free-living <b>flying</b> <b>foxes.</b> The high mobility of <b>flying</b> <b>foxes</b> requires a delay tolerant wireless network for data gathering: GPS positions and sensor data have to be stored locally until a wireless gateway deployed in bat congregation areas, so called roosting camps, comes within radio range. In this paper, we present the system architecture and discuss our design decisions towards sustainable and reliable monitoring of <b>flying</b> <b>foxes</b> with a limited energy budget for sensing, storage and communication. Using empirical data from three free-living <b>flying</b> <b>foxes,</b> we characterize the overall system performance in terms of energy consumption and latency. ...|$|R
40|$|Objective: To {{identify}} nematodes seen in histological {{sections of}} brains of <b>flying</b> <b>foxes</b> (fruit bats) {{and describe the}} associated clinical disease and pathology. Proceedures: Gross and histological examination of brains from 86 free-living <b>flying</b> <b>foxes</b> with neurological disease was done {{as part of an}} ongoing surveillance program for Australian bat lyssavirus. Worms were recovered, or if seen in histological sections, extracted by maceration of half the brain and identified by microscopic examination. Histological archives were also reviewed. Results: There was histological evidence of angiostrongylosis in 16 of 86 recently submitted <b>flying</b> <b>foxes</b> with neurological disease and in one archival case from 1992. In 10 <b>flying</b> <b>foxes,</b> worms were definitively identified as Angiostrongylus cantonensis fifth-stage larvae. A worm fragment and third stage larvae were identified as Angiostrongylus sp, presumably A cantonensis, in a further three cases. The clinical picture was dominated by paresis, particularly of the hindlimbs, and depression, with <b>flying</b> <b>foxes</b> surviving up to 22 days in the care of wildlife volunteers. Brains containing fifthstage larvae showed a moderate to severe eosinophilic and granulomatous meningoencephalitis (n = 14), whereas there was virtually no inflammation of the brains of bats which died when infected with only smaller, third-stage larvae (n = 3). There was no histological evidence of pulmonary involvement. Conclusion: This is the first report of the recovery and identification of A cantonensis from free-living Australian wildlife. While angiostrongylosis is a common cause of paresis in <b>flying</b> <b>foxes,</b> the initial clinical course cannot be differentiated from Australian bat lyssavirus infection, and wildlife carers should be urged not to attempt to rehabilitate <b>flying</b> <b>foxes</b> with neurological disease. ...|$|R

5|$|The grey-headed <b>flying</b> <b>fox</b> {{is now a}} {{prominent}} federal conservation problem in Australia. Early in the last century, the species was considered abundant, with numbers estimated in the many millions. In recent years, though, direct evidence has been accumulating that the species is in serious decline. Current estimates for the species are between 200,000 - 300,000 and the national population may have declined by over 30% between 1989 and 1999 alone.|$|E
5|$|Around the {{beginning}} of the mating season, adult females move from the periphery towards the central male territories where they become part of short-term ‘harems’ that consist of a male and an unstable group of up to five females. Centrally located males are polygamous, while males on the periphery are monogamous or single. The mating system of the grey-headed <b>flying</b> <b>fox</b> is best described as a lek because males do not provide any essential resources to females and are chosen {{on the basis of their}} physical location within the roost, which correlates with male quality.|$|E
5|$|Baby {{flying foxes}} usually come into care {{after having been}} {{separated}} from their mothers. Babies are often orphaned during {{four to six weeks}} of age, when they inadvertently fall off their mothers during flight. When they are older, orphans usually come into care because of maternal death from power line electrocution or barbed wire entanglement. A rare, but apparent natural, occurrence of mass abandonment can lead to the rescue of hundreds of babies at one time. The latter most recently occurred in November 2008 at the Canungra bat camp in South East Queensland, when Wildcare Australia, working closely with the EPA and regional bat care groups, rescued and rehabilitated over 300 baby grey-headed flying foxes. Most babies are in a dehydrated and distressed state by the time they are rescued, and some are infested with maggots if found sick or injured. A young <b>flying</b> <b>fox</b> must be fed every four hours, and then as it develops it is introduced to blossoms and fruit. When the young <b>flying</b> <b>fox</b> is fully weaned around 10 to 12 weeks of age, it goes into a crèche for rehabilitation and eventual release.|$|E

5|$|Flying foxes {{often come}} to the {{attention}} of Australian wildlife care and rescue organisations, such as Wildcare Australia, ONARR, Wildlife Carers Darling Downs, Bat Care, Bat Rescue, Tweed Valley Wildlife Carers, WIRES, and Wildlife Victoria when reported as injured, sick, orphaned, or abandoned. A very high proportion of adult <b>flying</b> <b>fox</b> injuries are caused by entanglement in barbed wire fences or backyard fruit tree netting, both of which can result in very serious injuries and a slow, agonising death for the animal if not rescued quickly. More recently wildlife advocacy groups such the Victorian Advocates for Animals has used the commercial development of a range of wildlife safe fruit tree netting products to push for regulations to make it illegal to install wildlife unsafe nets on backyard fruit trees. These new products have as their chief characteristic small apertures / holes of 5mm x 5mm or less. Flying foxes are able to climb across the netting without being entangled. It is hoped the uptake of wildlife safe netting products will see a marked decline in <b>flying</b> <b>fox</b> entanglements across time and subsequent reduction in public risk and the burden on wildlife rescue and rehabilitation volunteers.|$|E

5|$|Movements of grey-headed {{flying foxes}} are {{influenced}} by the availability of food. Their population is very fluid, as they move in response to the irregular blossoming of certain plant species. They are keystone pollinators and seed disperses over 100 species of native trees and plants. The grey-headed <b>flying</b> <b>fox</b> is a partial migrant that uses winds to facilitate long-distance movement. It does not migrate in a specific direction, but rather in the direction that will be the most beneficial at the time.|$|E
5|$|The park's fauna {{includes}} notably several endemic {{bird species}}, such as Barau's petrel, the Réunion harrier, and the Réunion cuckooshrike. In total, 18 bird species are found at Réunion, {{half of which}} are endemic. At least 22 bird species have already gone extinct since human colonisation. A major threat to the bird fauna are introduced cats and rats. Of mammals, the Mauritian <b>flying</b> <b>fox</b> recolonised the Réunion after going extinct from the island. Notable butterfly species include Papilio phorbanta and Salamis augustina, and an endemic reptile is the Reunion Island day gecko.|$|E
