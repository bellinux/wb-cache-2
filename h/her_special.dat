5|$|Leech {{was named}} in the Olympic squad and the Australian Swimming Union {{exempted}} her from travelling to the national training camp in Townsville so she could train with Froelich, who understood <b>her</b> <b>special</b> dietary requirements. She joined the squad for the final race trials in Melbourne in October before the Olympics. Fraser and Crapp were too strong in the 100-metre freestyle, with Leech finishing second and third in the two races. After combining with Fraser, Crapp and Margaret Gibson to break the world record for the 4×100-metre freestyle relay, Leech was selected as one of Australia's three entrants in the 100-metre freestyle events and one of six swimmers for the 4×100-metre freestyle relay squad for the Olympics.|$|E
5|$|Throughout {{the course}} of the game, the player can acquire power-ups that enhance Samus's armor and weaponry, as well as grant <b>her</b> <b>special</b> abilities, {{allowing}} them to gain access to areas that were previously inaccessible. The Morph Ball allows Samus to curl into a ball, roll into tight places and plant bombs; the Spring Ball adds an ability to jump while in Morph Ball form. The Speed Booster can be used to run at high speeds, and can crash onto barriers and enemies. The Space Jump allows Samus to jump infinite times to cover great distances, and the Hi-Jump Boots allow for a higher jump. The Grapple Beam can be used to swing across open areas. The X-ray Scope is used to see items and passages through hidden walls and other surfaces.|$|E
50|$|On April 10, 2007, she {{was honored}} by the Museum of Television & Radio in Los Angeles with a <b>special</b> evening celebrating <b>her</b> {{television}} <b>specials</b> of the 1960s-1970s. The sold-out event, Mitzi Gaynor Razzle-Dazzle!: The Special Years, featured a screening followed by a panel discussion with Gaynor, designer Bob Mackie and director-choreographer Tony Charmoli. In conjunction with the event, the museum also featured a month-long gallery exhibit, Mitzi by Mackie, featuring Bob Mackie's Emmy-winning costumes from <b>her</b> <b>specials</b> along with a selection of costumes from Gaynor's legendary stage shows and concert appearances.|$|R

5|$|Chi's {{character}} is voiced by Rie Tanaka, and Georgette Rose in its English counterpart. The anime and manga storylines are essentially the same, but they differ slightly. These differences include {{the events in}} the ending, other things such as describing Elda's memory loss, and <b>her</b> <b>special</b> program. In the anime for example, it is explained that Hibiya reset Elda's memories after her husband's death rather than Elda losing them when she took Freya's program in. Another difference is the special program that was placed into Elda in the anime, this program appears to have an alternate effect. If Chi finds the Person just for her, all persocoms would be granted the ability to feel emotion. The reason for this is since Ichiro Mihara was the creator of persocoms, he viewed them all as his children. His wish was that if Chi were able to find someone who loved her in return, all his children would be able to share in this happiness by being able to feel emotions the way humans do.|$|E
5|$|In August 1868 Parry and {{his family}} arrived in England, where he began a three-year study at the Royal Academy of Music under William Sterndale Bennett and Manuel Garcia. During his last year of study at the Royal Academy, Parry {{appeared}} before Queen Victoria three times, each time by <b>her</b> <b>special</b> request. The Queen made another request of Parry each time he appeared: that he perform only works he had composed. In 1871, Bennett convinced Parry to enter University of Cambridge for a degree in music. While at Cambridge, Parry became the first Welshman to take both the MusB and MusD there. After earning his Bachelor's degree, Parry {{and his family}} returned to Danville, where he operated a school of music {{for the next three}} years. When Aberystwyth University established a chair for music, it was offered to Parry; he moved his family back to Wales, becoming the university's first Professor of Music.|$|E
5|$|Metroid: Zero Mission {{takes place}} on Planet Zebes, a large, {{open-ended}} world with areas connected by doors and elevators. The player controls Samus Aran as she travels through the planet's caverns and environments, hunting Space Pirates. Along the way, the player collects power-ups that enhance Samus's armor and weaponry, as well as grant <b>her</b> <b>special</b> abilities. These abilities allow Samus to access areas that were previously inaccessible, so that the game can be played linearly or non-linearly. For example, the player may come across underground caverns that bypass certain sections, a method termed sequence breaking. To save their progress, players can enter either Save Rooms or Samus's ship on Crateria. As a remake of Metroid, Metroid: Zero Missions layout bears a resemblance to the original, and various powerups and items make reappearances from previous games in the series, with similar uses, effects, and appearances. However, the game adds new items, areas, and mini-bosses, {{as well as a}} completely new area named Chozodia.|$|E

5|$|Aloy {{was cast}} {{out from the}} Nora tribe at birth, raised by an outcast named Rost (JB Blanc). As a child, she {{obtained}} a Focus, a small augmented reality device that gives <b>her</b> <b>special</b> perceptive abilities. After coming of age, Aloy (Ashly Burch) enters a competition called the Proving to win the right to become a Nora Brave, and by extension, {{a member of the}} Nora tribe. Aloy wins the competition, but the Nora are suddenly attacked by cultists. Aloy is almost killed by their leader Helis (Crispin Freeman), but is saved by Rost, who sacrifices himself to save Aloy from a bomb. When Aloy awakes, a Matriarch explains that the cultists had gained control of corrupted machines. Aloy also learns that as an infant, she was found {{at the foot of a}} sealed door that the Nora worship, and was believed by some to be cursed, hence being cast out. An Oseram foreigner called Olin (Chook Sibtain) informs Aloy that the cultists are part of a fanatical religious group calling themselves the Eclipse. They worship a demon called HADES (John Gonzalez), who allows them to corrupt machines. Olin indicates that the reason Aloy was targeted by the Eclipse was due to her resemblance to an Old World scientist named Dr. Elisabet Sobeck (also voiced by Burch).|$|E

25|$|Van Dyne {{displays}} several non-superhuman {{abilities that}} garner <b>her</b> <b>special</b> fame and attention, foremost {{of which is}} her fashion sense; in nearly all of her early appearances, she sports a new costume, presumably designed and manufactured on her own as she is a gifted fashion designer. She is also a skilled amateur screenwriter. The Wasp is trained in unarmed combat by Captain America and in combat utilizing <b>her</b> <b>special</b> powers by Henry Pym. In addition, the Wasp {{is one of the}} most intuitive, if not deductive, members of the Avengers, and is an experienced leader and strategist. She effectively determines that a chemical accident has created a schizophrenic break in Henry and that the relationship between the Scarlet Witch and the Vision is the result of the infused personality of Wonder Man, and guesses Iron Man's identity of Tony Stark.|$|E
25|$|Despite this {{formidable}} {{array of}} tradition and scholarly opinion, the Oxford Franciscans William of Ware and especially Blessed John Duns Scotus defended the doctrine. Scotus proposed {{a solution to the}} theological problem involved of being able to reconcile the doctrine with that of universal redemption in Christ, by arguing that Mary's immaculate conception did not remove her from redemption by Christ. Rather it {{was the result of a}} more perfect redemption given to her on account of <b>her</b> <b>special</b> role in history.|$|E
25|$|Chun-Li's normal {{moves are}} {{balanced}} among punches and kicks, {{but most of}} <b>her</b> <b>special</b> moves are kicks.

Chun-Li can also use the Kiko-Ken, a ranged energy projectile similar to Ryu's Hadouken, and a concentrated static energy burst known as the Kiko-Sho.|$|E

Having lived most of her life in Greenwich Village, Mia attends Albert Einstein High School with her few close friends (including her best friends, Lilly Moscovitz and Tina Hakim-Baba). <b>Her</b> <b>special</b> talent is writing, and she chronicles the main aspects of her life in various personal diaries.

25|$|Cynthia's {{return to}} her birth family {{captured}} the country's imagination. Tens of thousands of Texan families, and many more throughout the U.S., had suffered the loss of family members, especially children, in Indian raids. She was the granddaughter of a famous American patriot, a Marylander who had met a violent end in far-off Texas. This gained <b>her</b> <b>special</b> attention and gave hope {{to those who had}} lost relatives to the Comanche. In 1861, the Texas legislature granted her a league (about 4,400 acres) of land and an annual pension of $100 for the next five years, and made her cousins, Isaac Duke Parker and Benjamin F. Parker, her legal guardians.|$|E

25|$|Under {{the care}} of her adoptive family, Saya Otonashi had been living {{the life of an}} anemic amnesiac, but {{otherwise}} ordinary schoolgirl. However, her happy life is shattered when she is attacked by a Chiropteran, a hematophagous bat-like creature that lives by feeding on human blood. Saya learns that she {{is the only one who}} can defeat them, as her blood causes their bodies to crystallize and shatter. Armed with <b>her</b> <b>special</b> katana, Saya embarks on a journey with her family, allies, and her chevalier Haji, to rid the world of the Chiropteran threat and recover her identity. The course of the journey reveals the background history of the Chiropterans and Saya's past, which extends into the mid-19th century.|$|E
25|$|The celebrated John Duns Scotus (d. 1308), a Friar Minor like Saint Bonaventure, argued, on the contrary, {{that from}} a {{rational}} point of view it was certainly as little derogatory to the merits of Christ to assert that Mary was by him preserved from all taint of sin, {{as to say that}} she first contracted it and then was delivered. Proposing a solution to the theological problem of reconciling the doctrine with that of universal redemption in Christ, he argued that Mary's immaculate conception did not remove her from redemption by Christ; rather it {{was the result of a}} more perfect redemption granted her because of <b>her</b> <b>special</b> role in salvation history.|$|E
25|$|In 252, Sun Liang {{became the}} second emperor of Eastern Wu {{following}} the death of his father. As Sun Liang was only nine years old then, Zhuge Ke served as regent and ruled on his behalf. In 253, Sun Jun staged a coup d'état against Zhuge Ke and killed him, and then became the new regent. Sun Jun had a secret affair with Sun Luban; the affair probably started after her husband Quan Cong died in 249. Making use of <b>her</b> <b>special</b> relationship with Sun Jun, Sun Luban instigated him to help her get rid of her half-brother Sun He, the former Crown Prince. In 253, Sun Jun had Sun He relocated to Xindu Commandery (新都郡; around present-day Yi County, Anhui) and then sent an emissary to force him to commit suicide.|$|E
