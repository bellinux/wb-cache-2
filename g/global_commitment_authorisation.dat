40|$|In {{this study}} Howard Lewis III and J. David Richardson explore the gains that workers, companies, and {{communities}} achieve from choosing {{to engage with}} the global economy. Why <b>Global</b> <b>Commitment</b> Really Matters! follows two earlier Institute publications that explored the benefits of exporting. This study summarizes new research on American importing, international investment, and technology transfers that shows similar benefits. All types of <b>global</b> <b>commitment</b> seem to generate greater productivity, higher pay, stronger growth, and better survival rates. These in turn rejuvenate entire industries and their workforces and communities as they allow better firms and jobs to supplant those with less desirable traits. Exports, imports, investment, and technology transfer form a family of <b>global</b> <b>commitments</b> that spawns a family of economic rewards. The study shows that exactly the same patterns are being discovered in similar new research abroad. Little of this new research has made {{its way into the}} mainstream of public debate over trade and economic policies. The authors supplement their research survey with profiles of real American exporters, importers, multinational companies, foreign affiliates, and technology partners. They also weigh criticisms and alternative interpretations of the research, and examine the problems of those left on the margins of the global economy. ...|$|R

40|$|While {{it is not}} {{possible}} to stabilize greenhouse gas concentrations immediately, a <b>global</b> <b>commitment</b> to reducing emissions would decrease the risks of global warming regardless of uncertainties about the response of the climate system. Scenario analyses conducted by EPA for a Report to Congress on Policy Options for Stabilizing Global Climate indicate that if no policies to limit greenhouse gas emissions are undertaken, the equivalent of a doubling of carbon dioxide would occur between 2030 and 2040, and the Earth might be committed to a global warming of 2 - 4 °C(3 - 7 °F) by 2025 and 3 - 6 °C(4 - 10 °F) by 2050. Early application of existingand emergingtechnologies designed among other things, to increase the efficiency of energy use, expand the use of non fossil energy sources, reverse deforestation, and phase out chlorofluorocarbons, could reduce the <b>global</b> warming <b>commitment</b> in 2025 by about one fourth, and the rate of climatic change during the next century by at least 60 %.

The article concludes with some practical recommendations of how <b>global</b> <b>commitments</b> could be used to address national challenges by shaping policy and importantly its implementation at ground level. One of these is to focus on educational research, within and by Pakistanis themselves, to understand their own educational needs more fully and consequently be able to construct policy more reflective of national challenges and feed into <b>global</b> <b>commitments...</b>|$|R
