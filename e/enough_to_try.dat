5|$|In 1923, the Nazis felt strong <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>try</b> {{to seize}} power in Munich. They decided to march on the city, {{inspired}} by Benito Mussolini's successful march on Rome. Known as the Beer Hall Putsch, Hitler and his paramilitary Sturmabteilung (SA) troops {{failed to take}} control of Munich. Schaub and other Nazis were arrested and imprisoned with Hitler at Landsberg Prison. After the 1925 reformation of Nazi Party, Schaub became {{a founding member of the}} Schutzstaffel (SS), documented as member #7. In 1943, he was promoted his final rank of SS-Obergruppenführer.|$|E
25|$|Over {{the years}} this became almost a {{mandatory}} exercise {{and although it}} may seem to many to be a gross act of indecency, it was generally well received by the sometimes up to hundreds of tourists and locals. The Kai Tais or Beanie Boys, as the trans women were referred to by Anglophone white visitors, certainly did not mind either. By the mid-70s Singapore started a crackdown on this type of lewd behaviour and sailors were arrested at gunpoint by the local authorities for upholding the tradition. By this time those sailors brave <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>try</b> it were dealt with severely and even shipped home in disgrace. Though many locals accepted this part of Singaporean culture, many conservative Singaporeans {{felt that it was}} a disgrace and it defaced Singapore's image.|$|E
25|$|Hatch {{first had}} to {{convince}} a group of USAID officers that his epiphany would pay off—for the rural poor {{and the government of}} the United States, whose grant dollars would fund the first projects. Remarkably, the officials liked his innovative idea and provided an initial grant of $1 million. Hatch and his Peruvian business partner, Aquiles Lanao, launched the program in five separate geographical areas of Bolivia and within four weeks, they had created funds in 280 villages serving 14,000 families with loans worth $630,000. Hatch's clients in Bolivia were puzzled at first by village banking because it represented a significant departure from business as usual. They were intrigued <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>try</b> it, however, and it was an immediate success. When Hatch's client in Bolivia changed its in-country team, the new representatives shut the program down. More cautious than the original client team, the new group acknowledged the program's success but still felt that uncollateralized lending to very poor people was too risky. Undeterred, Hatch spent the next few months training others in the village banking methodology, helping open new programs throughout Latin America, and building the institution that would {{come to be known as}} FINCA International. FINCA incorporated in 1985.|$|E

500|$|That same year, Hitler felt strong <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>try</b> {{to seize}} power in Munich. Inspired by Benito Mussolini's [...] "March on Rome" [...] the {{previous}} year, the Nazis aimed to first establish power in Munich and then challenge {{the government in}} Berlin. On 9 November 1923 the Stoßtrupp, along with the SA and several other paramilitary units, {{took part in the}} abortive coup d'état, resulting in the death of sixteen Nazi supporters and four police officers, an event known as the Beer Hall Putsch. After the putsch, Hitler and other Nazi leaders were incarcerated at Landsberg Prison for high treason. [...] The Nazi Party and all associated formations, including the Stoßtrupp, were officially disbanded.|$|E
500|$|Nirvana used dynamic shifts {{that went}} from quiet to loud. Cobain {{had sought to}} mix heavy and pop musical sounds; he commented, [...] "I wanted to be totally Led Zeppelin in a way and then be totally extreme punk rock and then do real wimpy pop songs". When Cobain heard the Pixies' 1988 album Surfer Rosa after {{recording}} Bleach, he felt it had the sound he wanted to achieve but until then was too intimidated to try. The Pixies' subsequent popularity encouraged Cobain to follow his instincts as a songwriter. Like the Pixies, Nirvana moved between [...] "spare bass-and-drum grooves and shrill bursts of screaming guitar and vocals". Near {{the end of his}} life, Cobain noted the band had become bored by the formula, finding it limited, but he expressed doubts that the band was skilled <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>try</b> other dynamics.|$|E

Monáe is young and fearless <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>try</b> anything, gifted enough to pull {{almost all of it}} off, and large-hearted enough to make it feel like a communal experience: Us rather than Me". The ArchAndroid was voted the fourth-best album in The Village Voices Pazz & Jop critics' poll for 2010. Five songs from the album were included in the poll's singles list, including [...] "Tightrope" [...] (number two), [...] "Cold War" [...] (number 22), [...] "Wondaland", [...] "Locked Inside", and [...] "Sir Greendown" [...] (all tied for number 549).|$|E

Kelly West of Cinemablend.com wrote that even though the episode did not play-out [...] "the way [...] expected", she was [...] "definitely not complaining". Alan Sepinwall, a writer for The Star-Ledger, was critical of the proposal scenario, saying that [...] "I really, really, really hope the writers aren't going to be foolish <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>try</b> to create real strife in the PB (Pam Beesly and Jim) relationship over how long it's going to take Jim to propose."

The Millennium Choir performed the Lacrimosa sequence ("Lacrimosa dies illa Qua resurget ex favilla Judicandus homo reus. Huic ergo parce, Deus: Pie Jesu Domine, Dona eis requiem. Amen.") and backing vocals throughout the song. Lee, the orchestra and choir recorded the song at a chapel in Seattle, Washington. In a number of interviews, Lee revealed that everyone asked about a collaboration between her and Mozart. She further stated that she always wanted to make Lacrimosa from Mozart's Requiem a metal song, later adding that The Open Door was [...] "the time for that, for trying things I hadn't been brave <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>try</b> before."

The following year, Avon's printer, J.W. Clements, suggested to Meyers {{the idea of a}} pulp magazine which included a few pages of comics. [...] Meyers asked Wollheim to try the idea, thinking that the additional section might draw comics readers to buy a pulp magazine, and in July 1950 Wollheim duly launched Sparkling Love Stories and Out of This World Adventures. [...] The romance magazine was cancelled after a single issue because of poor sales; but Out of This World Adventures seemed promising <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>try</b> a second issue, which appeared in December 1950, along with a third magazine in the part-comic format: Pioneer Western.

John Walker of MTV reviewed it positively writing, [...] "The sparkling, goddess-like centerpiece in a swirling sea of pink feathers, Beyoncé shines like a true showgirl on stage.

Sweeney stated: [...] "Clearwater got that little bit more creepy recently, with the death - the police are treating it as suicide - of Shawn.
