40|$|Mirror-touch {{synaesthesia}} is {{a condition}} where observing touch to another's body induces a subjective tactile sensation on the synaesthetes body. The present study explores which characteristics of the inducing stimulus modulate the synaesthetic touch experience. Fourteen mirror-touch synaesthetes watched videos depicting a touch event while indicating (i) whether the video induced a tactile sensation, (ii) on which side of their body they felt this sensation and (iii) {{the intensity of the}} experienced sensation. Results indicate that the synaesthetes experience stronger tactile sensations when observing touch to real bodies, whereas observing touch to dummy bodies, pictures of bodies and disconnected <b>dummy</b> body <b>parts</b> elicited weaker sensations. These results suggest that mirror-touch synaesthesia is not entirely bottom-up driven, but top-down information, such as knowledge about real and <b>dummy</b> body <b>parts,</b> also modulate the intensity of the experience. 2011...|$|R
40|$|It {{has been}} shown that the design of the Hybrid III dummy's hip joint can cause high spikes in the chest accelerations. These spikes are {{generated}} when the pelvis rotation is suddenly stopped by the bottoming out of the hip joint. This creates large lumbar shear and tension forces which act to resist forward movement of the dummy's chest. This problem has partly been resolved by the introduction of 'modified femurs'. However, even with modified femurs, high peaks have still been observed in chest accelerations of some front barrier crashes. In order to analyze the load path from upper legs to chest, dynamic experiments have been performed on the hip joint (with modified femurs and with standard femurs), on the isolated lumbar spine and on a partial dummy consisting of upper legs, torso, neck and head. These tests have been used to significantly improve an existing model of the dummy. In the hip joint, a considerable rate-dependency was found and the adjustment of hip friction was found to be an important factor. For different lumbar spines from the same manufacturer, major differences in response were found. These differences between <b>dummy</b> <b>parts</b> are a concern for reproducibility of full dummy tests. A sensitivity analysis showed that such dummy related factors lead to variations in the order of 2 - 8 % for peak chest acceleration and chest deflection, but lead to much larger variations in lumbar loads...|$|E

50|$|A {{special effects}} {{supervisor}} has {{to ensure the}} safety of his/her crew and everyone else on set. Before the cameras start rolling, local officials may step onto set and perform inspections, so knowledge of the law and safety protocols helps when using explosives and firearms during the production process. Specific education programs are recommended for one to gain high awareness in health and safety. Other training in various fields such as handling explosives, firearms, high voltage and other hazardous material and equipment helps. One should be familiar with all the necessary equipment such as wind, snow, fog, fire and rain machines, as well as <b>dummies</b> and body <b>parts.</b> On set, the supervisor is the one in charge of setting up and operating these gears. Creativity and imagination plays a big role in this occupation, for he/she is the one responsible to see the big picture of the script and know when and how a special effect should be implemented. He/she should have the ability to visualize how things will appear âon screen.â Strong communication skills and presentation skills are an asset because being able to show such skills during the interview process proves personal responsibility and willing to collaborate with others. As well, the head of the entire special effects team works closely with the production designer and art director. The supervisor plans a special effects scene and presents it to the director, in hope that he/she will be pleased with the results. Experience in photography may be an advantage in this job because as the supervisor, he/she has to plan the camera angles when shooting special effects scenes. Starting young allows one to absorb all the information and experience you can get and applying them to become a special effects artist.|$|R
50|$|Later, Sethupathi interrogates two {{adolescent}} {{school boys}} {{on the grounds of}} chain-snatching. When they don't speak up, Sethupathi threatens to shoot them on the count of five. At the fifth count, he shoots one of the boys, leaving him critically injured. Sethupathi is charged with attempt-to-murder and is suspended. However, Sethupathi had no intention of shooting either of the boys and realises that someone had unlocked his gun, which he had thought was locked. He soon finds out that Kanagavel is responsible for unlocking his gun. Kanagavel unlocked the gun and replaced the bullets with <b>dummy</b> ones as <b>part</b> of a plan to put Vaathiyar in jail for life so that he will be free to reconcile with his wife. Sethupathi and his senior official appear before an enquiry to prove his innocence. However, {{one of the members of}} the enquiry panel is an ally of Vaathiyar and she tries to influence the panel against Sethupathi, but her double-game is soon exposed and Sethupathi is cleared of all charges. Sethupathi's troubles are still not over; Vaathiyar burns Kanagavel alive and starts targeting Sethupathi and his family. Sethupathi overcomes all the hurdles put by Vaathiyar and his henchmen. Vaathiyar then decides to silence Sethupathi once and for all by sending his henchmen to kill Sethupathi's wife (Remya Nambeesan) and his two children, but Sethupathi's son, who is aware of police work, drives away the henchmen with the help of his father. Infuriated with the failed attempt, Vaathiyar instructs his men to kill the school boy injured by Sethupathi and put the blame on him. However, Sethupathi, aware of Vaathiyar's plan, guards the hospital where the boy is admitted and saves him from Vaathiyar's henchmen.|$|R
2500|$|In mid-1968, Powell's book The House of Lords in the Middle Ages was {{published}} after twenty years' work. At {{the press conference}} for its publication, Powell said if the government introduced a Bill to reform the Lords he would be its [...] "resolute enemy". Later in 1968, when the Labour government published its Bills for the new session, Powell was angry at Heath's acceptance of the plan drawn up by the Conservative Iain Macleod and Labour's Richard Crossman to reform the Lords, titled the Parliament (No. 2) Bill. Crossman, opening the debate on 19 November, said the government would reform the Lords in five ways: removing the voting rights of hereditary peers; making sure no party had a permanent majority; ensuring {{the government of the}} day usually passed its laws; weakening the Lords' powers to delay new laws; and abolishing the power to refuse subordinate legislation if it had been passed by the Commons. Powell spoke in the debate, opposing these plans. He said the reforms were [...] "unnecessary and undesirable" [...] {{and that there was no}} weight in the claim that the Lords could [...] "check or frustrate the firm intentions" [...] of the Commons. He claimed that only election or nomination could replace the hereditary nature of the Lords. If they were elected it would pose the dilemma of which House was truly representative of the electorate. He also had another objection: [...] "How can the same electorate be represented in two ways so that the two sets of representatives can conflict and disagree with one another?" [...] Those nominated would be bound to the Chief Whip of their party through a sort of oath and Powell asked [...] "what sort of men and women are they to be who would submit to be nominated to another chamber upon condition that they will be mere <b>dummies,</b> automatic <b>parts</b> of a voting machine?" [...] He also stated that the inclusion in the proposals of thirty crossbenchers was [...] "a grand absurdity", because they would have been chosen [...] "upon the very basis that they have no strong views of principle on the way in which the country ought to be governed". Powell claimed the Lords derived their authority not from a strict hereditary system but from its prescriptive nature: [...] "It has long been so, and it works". He then added that there was not any widespread desire for reform: he indicated a recent survey of working-class voters that showed that only a third of them wanted to reform or abolish the Lords, with another third believing the Lords were an [...] "intrinsic part of the national traditions of Britain". Powell deduced from this, [...] "As so often, the ordinary rank and file of the electorate have seen a truth, an important fact, which has escaped so many more clever peopleâthe underlying value of that which is traditional, that which is prescriptive".|$|R

The marginal effect of a covariate is equal to the estimated parameter times the probability of being uncensored; for the average respondent, this probability varies from 0.747 to 0.865 over the eight questions. 12 The average log income is about 7.25, so the coefficients on the dummies should be compared with 7.25 times the coefficient on log income.|$|R
