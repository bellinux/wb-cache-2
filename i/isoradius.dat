40|$|We {{propose a}} {{technique}} for 3 D face registration and matching using a novel representation called “isoradius contours”. An <b>isoradius</b> contour is the contour on the 3 D facial surface {{that is a}} known fixed distance relative to some predefined reference point (the tip of the nose). A 3 D face representation contains many <b>isoradius</b> contours with different radii and the first major benefit of the technique is that {{the shape of the}} contours is independent of the facial pose, due to the infinite rotational symmetry of a sphere. The second major benefit of the technique is that registration, alignment and matching can be implemented using a simple process of 1 D correlation. Our results have shown that registration and alignment is of comparable accuracy to ICP (iterative closest points), but is fast, non iterative, and is robust to the presence of outliers. ...|$|E
40|$|We {{propose a}} {{technique}} for simultaneous 3 D object registration (alignment) and matching using a novel representation, {{which we call}} contours". The method is particularly useful {{when there is a}} single distinctive and easily localised point on the 3 D object surface. In the case of a human face, the nose tip is easy to localise and so the method works well for 3 D face verication and recognition applications. An <b>isoradius</b> contour is the contour on a 3 D surface that is a known xed distance relative to some predened reference point (such as the tip of the nose) and can be thought of a the intersection of a sphere (of given radius, centered on that reference point) with the object surface. An object representation contains many <b>isoradius</b> contours with dierent radii and the rst major benet of the technique is that the shape of the contours is independent of the object pose, due to the innite rotational symmetry of a sphere. We show how the method can be used both to register (align) 3 D objects and match (compare) them in recognition and verication applications. The second major benet of the technique is that registration and matching can be implemented with a simple process of 1 D correlation. The method easily lends itself to a rich representation of both 3 D structural and 2 D color-texture properties. Also, in terms of applications which image the human face, such as face recognition/verication, the representation can be used to usefully encode facial expression and may be used in advanced techniques that simultaneously determine or verify identity and yield a classication of facial expression. ...|$|E
40|$|Abstract We {{consider}} {{the problem of}} generating either pairwise-aligned or pose-normalised depth maps from noisy 3 D point clouds in a relatively unrestricted poses. Our system is deployed in a 3 D face alignment application and consists of the following four stages: (i) data filtering, (ii) nose tip identification and sub-vertex localisation, (iii) computation of the (relative) face orientation, (iv) generation of either a pose aligned or a pose normalised depth map. We generate an implicit radial basis function (RBF) model of the facial surface and this is employed within all four stages of the process. For example, in stage (ii), construction of novel invariant features is based on sampling this RBF over a set of concentric spheres to give a spherically-sampled RBF (SSR) shape histogram. In stage (iii), a second novel descriptor, called an <b>isoradius</b> contour curvature signal, is defined, which allows rotational alignment to be determined using a simple process of 1 D correlation. We test our system on both the University of York (UoY) 3 D face dataset and the Face Recognition Grand Challenge (FRGC) 3 D data. For the more challenging UoY data, our SSR descriptors significantly outperform three variants of spin images, successfully identifying nose vertices {{at a rate of}} 99. 6 %. Nose localisation performance on the higher quality FRGC data, which has only small pose variations, is 99. 9 %. Our bes...|$|E
