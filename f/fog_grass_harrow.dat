50|$|There are medieval {{ridge and}} furrows on this {{unimproved}} meadow on clay. The drier ridge tops have many herbs, while the damp furrows {{are dominated by}} creeping bent and Yorkshire <b>fog</b> <b>grasses.</b> There are also mature hedges and a small pond.|$|R
50|$|Plants found include typical wetland {{species such}} as sedges, willows, and rushes. Hedge {{woundwort}} is plentiful, as are wild angelica (Angelica sylvestris) is plentiful, as are Hedge woundwort (Stachys sylvatica), yellow flag iris (Iris pseudacorus), and reed canary grass, (Phalaris arundinacea). The open water area exhibits yellow pond-lily (Nuphar lutea). Wild angelica, reedmace (bullrush), yellow meadow vetchling, Yorkshire <b>fog</b> <b>grass,</b> tussock grass, and meadowsweet were also noted and Brooklime speedwell grows within the ditch of the Joppa Burn inflow.|$|R

5000|$|Holcus lanatus is a {{perennial}} grass. The specific epithet [...] is Latin for 'woolly' which describes the plant's hairy texture. Common names include Yorkshire <b>fog,</b> tufted <b>grass,</b> and meadow soft grass. In North America, {{where it is}} an invasive species, names include velvet grass and common velvet grass.|$|R
30|$|The trial {{areas were}} planted either with Pinus radiata or Pseudotsuga menziesii in July 2011 at 1000 stems ha− 1. Site {{preparation}} included windrowing and line-ripping in November 2010, {{followed by an}} aerial pre-plant spray operation in April 2011 consisting of 2.5  kg ha− 1 glyphosate (AGPRO Green Glyphosate 510, 510  g L− 1 glyphosate as the isopropylamine salt, AGPRO NZ Ltd) applied in 100  L ha− 1 water with 0.5  L ha− 1 organosilicone adjuvant. In the oversowing treatment plots and following the pre-plant spray, Holcus lanatus L. (Yorkshire <b>fog</b> <b>grass)</b> was sown at 5.0  kg ha− 1, together {{with a mix of}} Lolium perenne L. and Trifolium repens L. (rye/clover mix) at 8.0  kg ha− 1. In May 2011, all plots other than those that were oversown, received a second pre-plant spray with 0.8  kg ha− 1 glyphosate and 0.18  kg ha− 1 triclopyr (AGPRO Triclop 600, 600  g L− 1 triclopyr as the butoxyethyl ester; AGPRO NZ Ltd) applied in 100  L ha− 1 water with 0.3  L ha− 1 organosilicone adjuvant.|$|R
40|$|Various {{characters}} are reputed {{to reduce the}} acceptability of Yorkshire <b>fog</b> <b>grass</b> (Holcus lanatus) to sheep. The relative importance of these characters in determining the acceptability of Yorkshire fog to sheep was investigated in summer, autumn, and early-winter of 1978, using standardised regression, and based upon a phenotypically diverse collection of spaced plants from fifty-three seed populations. A clump defoliation score {{was used to assess}} sheep preference. Cluster analysis of ratios of the standardised partial regression coefficients from individual genotype populations generally confirmed the results obtained from the standardised partial regression coefficient ratios of pooled genotype populations. Sheep rejected plants exhibiting a high proportion of inflorescences, dead leaf and sheath material and crown rust infection. The presence of inflorescences and crown rust were respectively 1. 5 and 0. 86 times as important as clump greenness over all genotype populations, in the summer period. Leaf pubescence was only 0. 13 times as important as clump greenness and was therefore considered relatively unimportant in determining sheep preference. Leaf tensile strength, leaf width, clump height and diameter, clump erectness, leaf flavanol level and soluble sugar level, were also considered unimportant in this study, and ranged from 0. 57 to 0. 019 times as important as clump greenness in determining sheep preference. However only 20 - 25 % of the variation in sheep preference was explained by the characters examined in the three seasons of this study. The unexplained variation may have been due to a high level of amongst sheep preference variance or to unassessed plant characters. The phenotypic variation of each character was partitioned using a split-plot-in-time model. Broad-sense heritability estimates for all characters examined were low and ranged from 34 % to 0. 4 %. It was suggested from these results that the acceptability of Yorkshire <b>fog</b> <b>grass</b> to sheep, by reduction of inflorescences and crown rust infection, and by removal of excessive dead leaf and sheath material, was largely under the control of grazing management (i. e. an aspect of the environment). However, some progress might be achieved by selection and breeding for genotypes with reduced levels of inflorescences (h 2 = 34 %) and crown rust infection (h 2 = 29 %) ...|$|R
40|$|Competition for below-ground {{resources}} {{was investigated}} between young Eucalyptus globulus Labill. (Tasmanian blue gum) and Holcus lanatus L. (Yorkshire <b>fog</b> <b>grass)</b> in a plantationin SE Tasmania, Australia. The {{objectives of the}} study were (1) to measure the competitive effect of weeds on the growth of E. globulus under contrasting levels of soil water and nitrogen availability and (2) to determine the 'critical period' of competition for soil water and nitrogen in a developing stand of E. globulus. This information lead to improved understanding of the mechanisms of competition between H. lanatus and young E. globulus. A two hectare field experiment was established on a low rainfall (500 mm yr- 1), ex-pasture site with a sandy soil of low to moderate fertility. Two levels of both irrigation and nitrogen (N) fertiliser (urea) were applied to provide contrasting soil water and nitrogen levels. A range of periods of weed presence and absence (following the Critical Period method) were used in specific combinations of water and nitrogen availability. Weedy plots were rapidly dominated by H. lanatus, a very competitive grass, that had up to 100...|$|R

60|$|How lang Steenie lay there, {{he could}} not tell; but {{when he came to}} himsell, he was lying in the auld kirkyard of Redgauntlet parochine just {{at the door of the}} family aisle, and the scutcheon of the auld knight, Sir Robert, hanging over his head. There was a deep morning <b>fog</b> on <b>grass</b> and gravestane around him, and his horse was feeding quietly beside the minister's twa cows. Steenie would have thought the whole was a dream, but he had the receipt in his hand, fairly written and signed by the auld laird; only the last letters of his name were a little disorderly, written like one seized with sudden pain.|$|R
50|$|Grasshoppers in general, {{including}} this species, are herbivorous and subsist mainly on grasses. Scientists have gained {{knowledge of the}} diet of G. rufus {{through the use of}} feces as a source of DNA. It has been documented to eat plants of the genus Bromus, the species Holcus lanatus, and the subfamily Pooideae, all within the family Poaceae. Poaceae is a family of flowering monocots whose members are referred to as true grasses. Pooideae includes lawn grasses and cereals such as wheat and barley. Bromus is composed of grasses called brome grasses or cheat grasses. Holcus lanatus, more commonly known as Yorkshire <b>fog</b> or velvet <b>grass,</b> is a species of perennial pasture grass noted for its hairy texture. The rufous grasshopper has also been known to sparingly eat other plants such as rushes.|$|R
60|$|It was {{necessary}} he should see Mortsheugh, the sexton {{of the old}} burial-ground at Armitage, to arrange matters for the funeral of Alice; and, as the man dwelt near the place of her late residence, the Master, after a slight refreshment, walked towards {{the place where the}} body of Alice was to be deposited. It was situated in the nook formed by the eddying sweep of a stream, which issued from the adjoining hills. A rude cavern in an adjacent rock, which, in the interior, was cut into the shape of a cross, formed the hermitage, where some Saxon saint had in ancient times done penance, and given name to the place. The rich Abbey of Coldinghame had, in latter days, established a chapel in the neighbourhood, of which no vestige was now visible, though the churchyard which surrounded it was still, as upon the present occasion, used for the interment of particular persons. One or two shattered yew-trees still grew within the precincts of that which had once been holy ground. Warriors and barons had been buried there of old, but their names were forgotten, and their monuments demolished. The only sepulchral memorials which remained were the upright headstones which mark the graves of persons of inferior rank. The abode of the sexton was a solitary cottage adjacent to the ruined wall of the cemetery, but so low that, with its thatch, which nearly reached the ground, covered with a thick crop of <b>grass,</b> <b>fog,</b> and house-leeks, it resembled an overgrown grave. On inquiry, however, Ravenswood found that the man of the last mattock was absent at a bridal, being fiddler as well as grave-digger to the vicinity. He therefore retired to the little inn, leaving a message that early next morning he would again call for the person whose double occupation connected him at once with the house of mourning and the house of feasting.|$|R
