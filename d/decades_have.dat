Apart from Berliner, they have rejected the idea that White has a forced win from the opening position. Many also reject the traditional paradigm that Black's objective should be to neutralize White's initiative and obtain equality.|$|E

5|$|Despite {{the early}} {{fascination with the}} novel, after the Second World War it fell into neglect as {{critical}} attention to Döblin was directed primarily towards his next novel, Berlin Alexanderplatz (1929), and a new edition of Berge Meere und Giganten was not published until 1977.

5|$|Hermaphroditism {{appeared}} in medical literature {{enough to be}} considered common knowledge, although cases were rare. Homoerotic elements in literature were pervasive, specifically the masquerade of one gender for another to fool an unsuspecting woman into being seduced. Such plot devices were used in Shakespeare's Twelfth Night (1601), The Faerie Queene by Edmund Spenser in 1590, and James Shirley's The Bird in a Cage (1633). Extraordinary cases during the Renaissance of women taking on male personae and going undetected for years or <b>decades</b> <b>have</b> been recorded.|$|E
5|$|Melting of {{floating}} ice shelves (ice that originated on the land) {{does not in}} itself contribute much to sea-level rise (since the ice displaces only its own mass of water). However it is the outflow of the ice from the land to form the ice shelf which causes a rise in global sea level. This effect is offset by snow falling back onto the continent. Recent <b>decades</b> <b>have</b> witnessed several dramatic collapses of large ice shelves around the coast of Antarctica, especially along the Antarctic Peninsula. Concerns have been raised that disruption of ice shelves may result in increased glacial outflow from the continental ice mass.|$|E
5|$|State law {{requires}} that wards be compact and contiguous and that the largest ward may not exceed {{the population of the}} smallest by more than 10% of the average ward size. Ward boundaries are redrawn, as needed, by a board of ward commissioners consisting of two Democrats and two Republicans appointed at the county level and the municipal clerk. Redrawing of ward lines in previous <b>decades</b> <b>have</b> shifted traditional boundaries, so that downtown currently occupies portions of the East and Central Wards. The boundaries of the wards are altered for various political and demographic reasons and sometimes gerrymandered, especially the northeastern portion of the West Ward.|$|E

5|$|The {{battle was}} {{one of the largest in}} Medieval Europe and is {{regarded}} as the most important victory in the histories of Poland and Lithuania, also it's widely celebrated in Belarus. It has been used as a source of romantic legends and national pride, becoming a larger symbol of struggle against foreign invaders. During the 20th century the battle was used in Nazi and Soviet propaganda campaigns. Only in recent <b>decades</b> <b>have</b> historians moved towards a dispassionate, scholarly assessment of the battle, reconciling the previous narratives, which differed widely by nation.|$|E
5|$|The {{last three}} <b>decades</b> <b>have</b> seen a {{proliferation}} of subfamily names, {{as a result of}} three factors: (1) the realization that some subfamilies were assemblages of unrelated taxa; (2) abandonment of paraphyletic taxa, and (3) the discovery of novel fossil taxa. Seventeen extant subfamilies of ants are currently recognized, along with four extinct subfamilies. One of the fossil taxa, Armaniinae, is often given family rank within the superfamily Formicoidea. About 13 genera are incertae sedis (of uncertain placement), and are not assigned to any subfamily.|$|E
5|$|The main {{attraction}} of Waterfall Gully is the waterfall, First Falls. It {{is at the}} south-eastern end of the road, in land owned by Cleland Conservation Park.

Development in the area has continued since the construction of a restaurant in 1912. Developments over recent <b>decades</b> <b>have</b> included improving access to the site, upgrading the bridges, and the addition of new signage.|$|E

5|$|Australia has {{competed in}} {{cross-country}} skiing in 1952, 1960, 1968, 1980 to 1998, and since 2006. The two Australian representatives in 1952 occupied {{the last two}} places, and before 1984, no Australian finished above the bottom 15% of racers. Results have slowly improved, but most Australian entrants {{in the last two}} <b>decades</b> <b>have</b> placed in the bottom 25%. In 1992, Anthony Evans became the first Australian to place in the top half, finishing in the top 40 in two events. Australia fielded three competitors in cross-country skiing in 2006, its largest contingent in the event. Paul Murray and Esther Bottomley competed in the sprint; Clare-Louise Brumley was selected for the pursuit and 30km freestyle, but competed only in the former due to illness. Nobody broke into the top half in their respective races. At the 2010 Games, Australia had three representatives. Ben Sim came in the top half in one event, but he, Bottomley and Murray finished in the bottom 20% in their remaining four events. Australia has never competed in ski jumping, and their sole entry in Nordic combined was by Hal Nerdal in 1960, who came last.|$|E
5|$|Essgee Entertainment {{produced}} an adapted version of Pinafore in 1997 in Australia and New Zealand {{that has been}} much revived. Another musical adaptation is Pinafore! (A Saucy, Sexy, Ship-Shape New Musical), adapted by Mark Savage. It was first performed at the Celebration Theater in Los Angeles, California on 7 September 2001, directed by Savage, where it ran with great success for nine months. It then played in Chicago and New York in 2003. In this adaptation, only one character is female, and {{all but one of}} the male characters are gay. An original cast recording was issued in 2002 by Belva Records. Pinafore Swing is a musical with music arranged by Sarah Travis. It premiered at the Watermill Theatre in England in 2004 in a production directed by John Doyle. The adaptation, set in 1944, changes the characters into members of a band entertaining the sailors on a World War II troop ship in the Atlantic. The reduced-size acting cast also serve as the orchestra for the singing roles, and the music is infused with swing rhythms. Numerous productions in recent <b>decades</b> <b>have</b> been set to parody Star Trek or Star Wars.|$|E
