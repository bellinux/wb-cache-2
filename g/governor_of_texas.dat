5|$|When Congress reconvened in July, {{it passed}} a Reconstruction Act against Johnson's position, {{waited for his}} veto, {{overruled}} it, and went home.

5|$|Ross {{became the}} 19th <b>governor</b> <b>of</b> <b>Texas.</b> His inauguration ball {{was held at}} the newly opened Driskill Hotel, a {{tradition}} followed by every subsequent Texas governor. Under the 1876 Texas Constitution, which he had helped write, the governor was granted the power to be commander-in-chief, to convene the legislature, to act as executor of the laws, to direct trade with other states, to grant pardons, and to veto bills. His campaign had focused on land use reform, as most of the frontier issues now resulted from disagreements over the use of public land, especially between farmers and ranchers concerned with water rights and grazing issues. At Ross's urging, the legislature passed laws to restore the power of the Land Office Commissioner, provide punishments for those using state lands illegally, and to catalog existing public lands.|$|E
5|$|The state {{legislature}} decided during Houston's third senatorial term not to re-elect him, so {{he ran for}} the office of <b>Governor</b> <b>of</b> <b>Texas,</b> losing to Hardin Richard Runnels. He was still in Washington when William (Willie) Rogers Houston was born on May 25, 1858, their last child born in the Woodland home. In order to satisfy creditors of his gubernatorial campaign debts, Houston was forced to sell the house to his political supporter J. Carroll Smith. He subsequently defeated incumbent Runnels with a second bid for the office during a period when the populace was bitterly divided over the issue of secession from the United States, and was sworn in December 31, 1859.|$|E
5|$|Through 1971, it was {{uncertain}} if Agnew would be retained {{on the ticket}} as Nixon sought a second term in 1972. Neither Nixon nor his aides were enamored of Agnew's independence and outspokenness, and were less than happy at Agnew's popularity among conservatives suspicious of Nixon. The President considered replacing him with Treasury Secretary John Connally, a Democrat and former <b>Governor</b> <b>of</b> <b>Texas.</b> For his part, Agnew was unhappy with many of Nixon's stances, especially in foreign policy, disliking Nixon's rapprochement with China (on which Agnew was not consulted) and believing that the Vietnam War could be won with sufficient force. Even after Nixon announced his re-election bid {{at the start of}} 1972, it was unclear if Agnew would be his running mate, and it was not until July 21 that Nixon asked Agnew and the vice president accepted. A public announcement was made the following day.|$|E

Following the Civil War, Ross briefly served as sheriff of McLennan County before resigning to participate in the 1875 Texas Constitutional Convention.

In 1887, he became the 19th <b>governor</b> <b>of</b> <b>Texas.</b> During his two terms, he oversaw the dedication of the new Texas State Capitol, resolved the Jaybird-Woodpecker War, and became the only Texas governor to call a special session to deal with a treasury surplus.|$|E
5|$|In the Gulf of Mexico, Shell Oil {{evacuated}} about 40{{workers from}} drilling operations.

Perry activated up to 1,200National Guard troops, a 70member rescue team, six helicopters, and an incident management team that brings food and water to affected areas.

In Cameron Parish, Louisiana the Office of Emergency Preparedness ordered a mandatory evacuation, where Sheriff's deputies also erected roadblocks.|$|E
5|$|Sue Ellen {{has become}} a {{powerful}} woman in Dallas, leading successful fundraising campaigns and making connections with influential Texans.

But despite this success, Sue Ellen harbors deep regret for her mistakes as a mother raising John Ross and {{will do anything to}} make things right for him. Upon seeing J.R. {{for the first time in}} years, there is a brief moment of romantic tension and nostalgia. However, Sue Ellen becomes wary of J.R.'s claims of having changed when Cliff Barnes returns to town. Then when a colleague and occasional lover of John Ross's, Veronica Martinez, is pushed off a balcony and killed, Sue Ellen bribes the medical examiner into ruling the death a suicide and finds herself looking for support from Harris Ryland, Ann's ex-husband. Harris later plans to use Sue Ellen's sure win to his advantage and desiring to run a clean office, Sue Ellen seeks Ann's help who later gets a recording of Harris admitting to his crimes and placing him into a spot of submission.|$|E
