5|$|Strategic management: Due to the {{increasing}} importance of design as a <b>differentiator</b> and its supporting role in brand equity, design management deals with strategic design issues and supports the strategic direction of the business or enterprise. The debate on design thinking suggests the integration of design thinking into strategic management. Design thinking and strategic thinking have some commonalities in their characteristics, both are synthetic, adductive, hypothesis-driven, opportunistic, dialectical, enquiring and value-driven.|$|E
5|$|Non-dental {{sources of}} pain often cause {{multiple}} teeth to hurt {{and have an}} epicenter that is either above or below the jaws. For instance, cardiac pain (which can make the bottom teeth hurt) usually radiates up from the chest and neck, and sinusitis (which can make the back top teeth hurt) is worsened by bending over. As all of these conditions may mimic toothache, {{it is possible that}} dental treatment, such as fillings, root canal treatment, or tooth extraction may be carried out unnecessarily by dentists in an attempt to relieve the individual's pain, and as a result the correct diagnosis is delayed. A hallmark {{is that there is no}} obvious dental cause, and signs and symptoms elsewhere in the body may be present. As migraines are typically present for many years, the diagnosis is easier to make. Often the character of the pain is the <b>differentiator</b> between dental and non-dental pain.|$|E

The adaptive grid spline <b>differentiators</b> give much more accurate results than the uniform grid ones within a comparable computing time.

40|$|Abstract—A new {{optimization}} {{method for}} the design of fullband and lowpass IIR digital <b>differentiators</b> is proposed. In the new method, the passband phase-response error is minimized under the constraint that the maximum passband amplitude-response relative error is below a prescribed level. For lowpass IIR differen-tiators, an additional constraint is introduced to limit the average squared amplitude response in the stopband so as to minimize any high-frequency noise that may be present. Extensive experi-mental results are included, which show that the <b>differentiators</b> designed using the proposed method have much smaller maximum phase-response error for the same passband amplitude-response error and stopband constraints when compared with several <b>differentiators</b> designed using state-of-the-art competing methods.

25|$|This {{can also}} {{be viewed as a}} high-pass {{electronic}} filter. It is a filter with a single zero at DC (i.e., where angular frequency nbsp&radians) and gain. The high-pass characteristics of a differentiating amplifier (i.e., the low-frequency zero) can lead to stability challenges when the circuit is used in an analog servo loop (e.g., in a PID controller with a significant derivative gain). In particular, as a root locus analysis would show, increasing feedback gain will drive a closed-loop pole toward marginal stability at the DC zero introduced by the <b>differentiator.</b>|$|E

25|$|Companies {{that operate}} strong CSR {{activities}} tend to drive customer's attention to buy {{products or services}} regardless of the price. As a result, this increases competition among firms since customers {{are aware of the}} company's CSR practices. These initiatives serve as a potential <b>differentiator</b> because they not only add value to the company, but also to the products or services. Furthermore, firms under intense competition are able to leverage CSR to increase the impact of their distribution on the firm's performance. For instance, lowering the carbon footprint of a firm's distribution network or engaging in fair trade are potential differentiators to lower costs and increase profits. In this scenario, customers can observe the company's commitment to CSR while increasing company sales.|$|E

25|$|Ciliary {{neurotrophic}} factor (CNTF) is a cytosolic protein {{that is not}} secreted. CNTF {{has been shown to}} promote the survival of neuronal cultures in vitro, and it can also act as a <b>differentiator</b> and trophic factor on glial cells. Further, CNTF has been previously shown to affect the differentiation of glial precursor cells in vitro; however, the influence of CNTF in the in vivo setting has only recently been determined. Winter et al. used CNTF over-expressing transgenic mice as well as wildtype controls that had CNTF levels artificially elevated via injection, were subjected to neuronal damage using ZnSO4 (a known neuronal degenerative factor), which was injected intranasally in the olfactory epithelium. The olfactory bulb was then assessed for the expression of GFAP mRNA- a common marker for the glial scar. It was determined that mice with elevated levels of CNTF increased their GFAP mRNA expression two-fold. This data suggests that CNTF may mediate glial scar formation following CNS damage.|$|E

25|$|In 2005 a study {{conducted}} by Angela Chu and Jin Nam Choi was published in the Journal of Social Psychology, in which they intended to understand task performance among procrastinators with the definition of procrastination as the absence of self-regulated performance, from the 1977 work of Ellis & Knaus. In their study they identified two types of procrastination: the traditional procrastination which they denote as passive, and active procrastination where the person finds enjoyment of a goal-oriented activity only under pressure. The study calls this active procrastination positive procrastination, as it is a functioning state in a self-handicapping environment. In addition, it was observed that active procrastinators have more realistic perceptions of time and perceive more control over their time than passive procrastinators, which is considered a major <b>differentiator</b> between the two types. But surprisingly, active and passive procrastinators showed similar levels of academic performance. The population of the study was college students and the majority of the sample size were women and Asian in origin. Comparisons with chronic pathological procrastination traits were avoided.|$|E

500|$|Mark Schilling of The Japan Times {{rated the}} film 5 out of 5 stars and {{observed}} that Summer Wars [...] "may contain familiar elements, beginning with its bashful, moonstruck young hero, but it combines them in ways fresh, contemporary and dazzlingly imaginative". He {{also said that}} the film provides a social commentary on the differences between an [...] "analog world" [...] and a [...] "realm of digital devices". Schilling titled his article [...] "The future king of Japanese animation may be with us; Hosoda steps out of Miyazaki's shadow with dazzling new film". He praised Sadamoto, Aoyama and Nishida for producing [...] "scenes of animated spectacle that, in their dazzling fluency of motion and untethered brilliance of invention, makes the usual SF/fantasy anime look childish and dull". Twitch Film published a review by Guillem Rosset who also referenced Miyazaki noting that following The Girl Who Leapt Through Time [...] "cries went out immediately hailing him [...] as the heir apparent". He claimed that with Summer Wars, [...] "Hosoda is the new king, the best story teller working within the animated medium in Japan and– quite possibly– the world." [...] Rosset praised the film itself as [...] "richly detailed and beautifully written...gorgeous to look at." [...] and [...] "blessed with an extensive cast of stunningly detailed and authentic characters." [...] He concluded by saying [...] "Hosoda has perfectly balanced the need to entertain via the visuals with the rich and satisfying character work that separates him from the massive pack of quality technicians to establish himself as truly a master story teller." [...] He also noted that [...] "The wonderful cast of characters is one of the film's greatest strengths" [...] while also highlighting that, of the virtual world of OZ, [...] "Here the creative minds of Madhouse can let their imagination run wild." [...] With regards to the technical aspects, Rosset called the film [...] "a top class audiovisual show."

We are going to generalize this method from the integer order to the fractional order so as to estimate the fractional order derivatives of noisy signals. For sake of clarity, this work has been divided into two parts. The first part {{presented in this paper}} focuses on the continuous case while the second part that has been presented in another paper deals with the discrete case with on-line applications.

Hence, they can be used both for continuous-time and discrete-time models in on-line or off line applications. Then, some error bounds are provided for the corresponding estimation errors in continuous case.
