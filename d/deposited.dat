5|$|No {{consensus}} {{has been}} reached on the exact depositional nature of the Irati oil shale.

5|$|Rosendale is {{underlain}} by a shale {{member of}} the Martinburg Formation called Martinburg shale, <b>deposited</b> as early as 500 million years ago; Martinburg shale also lines {{the bottom of the}} Rondout Creek as it flows through the town. A conglomerate of the Shawangunk Formation was <b>deposited</b> over the Martinburg layer approximately 425 million years ago. The conglomerate is in turn covered by High Falls Shale, a reddish shale formed by mud flats. Subsequent streams left a layer of gray Binnewater Sandstone above the shale. After the sandstone was <b>deposited,</b> the region experienced folding and faulting, and was submerged in a shallow sea. This allowed the creation of fossiliferous limestone roughly 390 million years ago, specifically the Rondout Formation and New Scotland Formation. The Rondout Formation's dolostone member, formed during the upper Silurian, was mined throughout the village because of its ability to form natural cement. The region experienced repeated glaciation, and large amounts of till and alluvium were <b>deposited</b> during the Wisconsonian glaciation.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{examines}} how international depositors respond to national <b>deposit</b> insurance policies. Countries with explicit <b>deposit</b> insurance {{are found to}} be relatively attractive to international non-bank depositors. <b>Deposit</b> schemes characterized by coinsurance, a private administration, and a low <b>deposit</b> insurance premium appear to be particularly favored by these depositors. The sensitivity of non-bank <b>deposits</b> to <b>deposit</b> insurance policies opens up the possibility of international regulatory competition in this area. The EU directive on <b>deposit</b> insurance imposes minimum standards on national <b>deposit</b> insurance policies. This directive, however, is silent on several important features of <b>deposit</b> insurance such as the level of the <b>deposit</b> insurance premium. Hence, it may not preclude regulatory competition in Europe. <b>deposit</b> insurance, international <b>deposit...</b>|$|R

5|$|The holotype of Herrerasaurus (PVL 2566) was {{discovered}} in the Cancha de Bochas Member of the Ischigualasto Formation in San Juan, Argentina. It was collected in 1961 by Victorino Herrera, in sediments that were <b>deposited</b> in the Carnian stage of the Triassic period, approximately 235 to 221 million years ago. Over the years, the Ischigualasto Formation produced other fossils ultimately referred to Herrerasaurus. In 1958, A.S. Romer discovered specimen MCZ 7063, originally referred to Staurikosaurus in Carnian sediments. Herrerasaurus specimens PVL 2045 and MLP(4)61, were collected in 1959 and 1960, respectively, in sediments that were <b>deposited</b> in the Norian stage of the Triassic period, approximately 228 to 208 million years ago. In 1960, Scaglia collected specimen MACN 18.060, originally the holotype of Ischisaurus cattoi, in sediments <b>deposited</b> in the Carnian stage. In 1961, Scaglia collected Herrerasaurus specimen PVL 2558, in the Carnian beds of this formation. In 1990, the Cancha de Bochas Member produced more Herrerasaurus specimens, also from its Carnian beds. Specimen PVSJ 53, originally the holotype of Frenguellisaurus, was collected by Gargiulo & Oñate in 1975 in sediments that were <b>deposited</b> in the Carnian stage.|$|E
