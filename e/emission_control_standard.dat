30|$|We {{obtained}} the statistics of registered motor vehicles in India from various agencies in India, including the Ministry of Shipping, Road Transport & Highway. The data collection was extremely tedious {{due to an}} inferior information storage system in India. Data were obtained by combining internet search, peer-reviewed literature and reports, and personal communication with multiple research groups and agencies (both private and government agencies) in India and abroad via e-mails and phone calls. The annual average distance in kilometers travelled by various Indian vehicles {{was obtained from the}} Road Transport Yearbook [30] published by the Government of India. Upon analyzing the data, we found that older vehicles travelled lesser distance compared to the newer vehicles. The data are sorted out in terms of vehicle category, fuel type (diesel or gasoline), type of engine (two or four strokes), operation (e.g. taxi and private use for passenger cars and the <b>emission</b> <b>control</b> <b>standard</b> compliance. Driving conditions are defined as either urban or rural conditions. We categorized vehicles broadly into the following four categories: trucks (diesel), buses (diesel), passenger cars (including taxis and private cars powered by diesel and gasoline) and motor bikes (2 -stroke and 4 -stroke motor bikes powered by gasoline). The percentage share of each categoriy of vehicles on the basis of fuel type has been obtained from The Automotive Research Association of India (ARAI). Motorized two wheelers are differentiated by two stroke and four stroke engine.|$|E

50|$|In 2001, five {{separate}} lawsuits {{were filed}} against the US EPA by the Engine Manufacturers Association (EMA) and several individual trucking industry entities (such as International Truck and Engine Corporation). Each of those lawsuits challenged thelegality and technological feasibility of certain engine <b>emission</b> <b>control</b> <b>standards</b> in EPAregulations now referred to as NTE requirements. In their challenge, EMA stated that to determine whether an engine meets a primary emission standard, engines are tested and assessed using a standardized 20-minute emissions laboratory test known as the Federal Test Procedure. The NTE, by contrast, has no specified test procedure and potentially could apply over an almost infinite number of test conditions. This, in the manufacturers’ view, made it virtually impossible to ensure total compliance with the NTE—since {{there is no real}} or practical way to test an engine under all conceivable conditions—and so made the NTE both unlawful (the CAA authorizes EPA to adopt engine standards AND accompanying test procedures) and technically infeasible.|$|R
40|$|The {{problem at}} hand is to {{investigate}} the near-term commercial feasibility {{of a wide range}} of automotive <b>emission</b> <b>control</b> technologies. The central issues can best be explained in terms of the <b>emission</b> <b>control</b> characteristics of each technology and their costs. Governmentally established <b>emission</b> <b>control</b> <b>standards</b> may be viewed as constraints on the use of a given vehicle and engine design. Either the technology meets the standard in use or it will not be sold. <b>Emission</b> <b>control</b> technologies that show promise of near-term manufacturability will be identified. Then, without presuming what future emission standards will be, the emission characteristics of example vehicle-engine combinations will be listed. Technologies that are acceptable, given a specified emission standard, can then be identified by a process of elimination. The approach to identifying the relevant costs associated with a given technology is not as clear cut. One would like to think that the most basic question governing the adoption of a given feasible technology is, "Will it be purchased by the public?" The second part of this paper will discuss the impact of pollution control technology on the economic decisions facing the new car customer. The cost considered by the rational new car consumer involves more than first cost. Other important factors include maintenance, operating expenses, resale value, and financing charges. Since resale value and financing charges are highly time dependent, it is possible that a new car purchaser's decision on which technology to buy may depend on how long he plans to keep the car. A cost annualization procedure will thus be developed which considers these factors...|$|R
40|$|To {{meet the}} {{increasingly}} exacting <b>emission</b> <b>control</b> <b>standards</b> that are emerging, alternative fue l vehicles will be needed. I t appears that these will require opti-mised and dedicated systems utilising innovative control strategies {{to achieve the}} necessary standards. I n this paper, the major <b>emission</b> <b>control</b> issues for engines fuelled with alcohol, naturalgas, propane, or diesel fuels are identified. Control strategies employing dedicated <b>emission</b> <b>control</b> catalysts are discussed and performance results f r o m laboratory, engine and vehicle tests are high-lighted. Comparisons are made with gasoline fuelled engines, where signifi-cant experience has been accumulated wer the past decade {{with the use of}} closed loop fuel control plus a catalytic converter to suppress the three ma in polluting emissions. The use of catalytic converters containing f low through catalysts is emphasised. The development of vehicles using clean alter-native fuels, such as methanol, ethanol, natur-al gas, propane, reformulated gasoline and clean diesel, has been hastened by tighter emission standards, such as the United States Federal Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990. As a result of legislative initiatives the regulatory agencies, the automotive industry and the manufactur-ers of <b>emission</b> <b>control</b> components are assess-ing the emission characteristics of these vehi-cles. At the same time, efforts are being made to develop effective and durable emission con-trol systems suitable for vehicle fleets and pro-totype engines being developed for future auto-motive markets. Part of this development involves the catalytic converter technology already installed on over 150 million gasoline-powered vehicles to reduce hydrocarbons, car-bon monoxide and oxides of nitrogen (1). This same technology offers considerable potential for responding to the <b>emission</b> <b>control</b> chal-lenges associated with alternative fuelled vehi-cles.

40|$|International audienceThe EDGAR (Emissions Database for Global Atmospheric Research) v 4. 3 global {{anthropogenic}} emissions inventory of several gaseous (SO 2, NOx, CO, non-methane {{volatile organic compounds}} (NMVOCs) and NH 3) and particulate (PM 10, PM 2. 5, black and organic carbon (BC and OC)) air pollutants for the period 1970 – 2010 is used to develop retrospective air pollution emission scenarios to quantify the roles and contributions of changes in fuels consumption, technology, end-of-pipe emission reduction measures and their resulting impact on health and crop yields. This database presents changes in activity data, fuels and air pollution abatement technology for the past 4 decades, using international statistics and following guidelines for bottom-up emission inventory at the Tier 1 and Tier 2 levels with region-specific default values. With two further retrospective scenarios we assess (1) {{the impact of the}} technology and end-of-pipe (EOP) reduction measures in the European Union (EU) by considering a stagnation of technology with constant emission factors from 1970 and with no further abatement measures and improvement in European emissions standards, but fuel consumption occurring at historical pace, and (2) the impact of increased fuel consumption by considering unchanged energy use with constant fuel consumption since 1970, but technological development and end-of-pipe reductions. Our scenario analysis focuses on the three most important and most regulated sectors (power generation, the manufacturing industry and road transport), which are subject of multi-pollutant EU Air Quality regulations. If technology and European EOP reduction measures had stagnated at 1970 levels, EU air quality in 2010 would have suffered from 129 % higher SO 2, 71 % higher NOx and 69 % higher PM 2. 5 emissions, demonstrating the large role of technology in reducing emissions in 2010. However, if fuel consumption had remained constant starting in 1970, the EU would have benefited from current technology and <b>emission</b> <b>control</b> <b>standards,</b> with reductions in NOx by even 13 % more. Such further savings are not observed for SO 2 and PM 2. 5. If the EU consumed the same amount of fuels as in 1970 but with the current technology and <b>emission</b> <b>control</b> <b>standards,</b> then the <b>emissions</b> of SO 2 and PM 2. 5 would be 42 % respectively 10 % higher. This scenario shows the importance for air quality of abandoning heavy residual fuel oil and shifting fuel types (from, e. g., coal to gas) in the EU. A reduced-form TM 5 -FASST (Fast Screening Scenario Tool based on the global chemical Transport Model 5) is applied to calculate regional and global levels of aerosol and ozone concentrations and {{to assess the impact of}} air quality improvements on human health and crop yield loss, showing substantial impacts of export of EU technologies and standards to other world regions...|$|R
40|$|Medical waste {{constitutes}} one of {{the waste}} streams that should be dealt with special priority due to its potential negative impact on public health and on the environment. Incineration {{is a process that}} is widely used for the treatment of medical waste. However, self-supporting combustion of medical waste cannot avoid releasing many hazardous pollutants into our environment. The most favored solutions are firing additional fuels of high calorific value and direct purification by air pollution control devices (APCD). This process entails not only large first time investment but also an increase in the operation cost. A novel incinerator is proposed for better utilization of energy of the incineration process. Its originality is essen-tially due to combining a feeder, a rotary grate, a cylindrical gasifier and a “coaxial” secondary combustion chamber into a unique unit. The structure of the incinerator as well as the principle of the incineration process is presented in this paper. A full-scale trial of the novel incinerator with APCD was carried out from March to May 2008 to investigate how the distinct configuration influenced the incineration process. Data on PM, CO, NOX,O 2 were recorded by a continuous emission monitoring system during the study period. Heavy metals and PCCD/Fs were also sampled and measured. Measuring results were compared with the China and U. S. EPA guidelines. The concentrations of contaminants were below their respective limits in <b>emission</b> <b>control</b> <b>standards.</b> Results from testing the novel medical waste incinerator confirmed that this technology has a good suitability for neutralization of medical wastes and purification of flue gases.

40|$|The EPA {{implements}} {{its policy}} of exhaust <b>emission</b> <b>control</b> by setting <b>standards</b> specified in terms of grams of pollutants per mile traveled. As a result, the tax must first restrain the vehicle miles traveled (VMT) {{if it is to}} have an impact on emission at all. EPA's choice of miles traveled as the medium through which {{its policy of}} pollution control must run is unfortunate, because travel is an activity that people resist giving up. This is reflected in a low long-run price elasticity of travel demand. Consequently, it takes substantial increases in the gasoline tax to make an impact on long-run travel demand. Simulation results show that under an alternative policy option, where EPA's standards are specified in terms of grams of pollutant per gallon of fuel burned, the same long-run reduction in exhaust emissions achievable today can be achieved (at an even higher level of confidence) with less than one-tenth of the increase in gasoline price required under the existing policy regime. ...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{examines}} how regional inequalities {{are affected by}} <b>emission</b> <b>controls</b> via credit trading and availability of absorption sources. We assume that homogeneous goods are costly traded without <b>emission</b> <b>controls</b> and that the rural areas have an advantage {{in terms of the}} availability of absorption sources. We especially focus on the long-term effects of firm relocation. Our two key findings are as follows. First, in the case where an <b>emission</b> <b>control</b> scheme is implemented without allowing for offsetting emissions with carbon absorption sources (carbon sinks), strengthening the <b>emission</b> <b>controls</b> drives firms to relocate from rural areas to urban areas, in the case that wage levels remain unchanged in both areas.

40|$|The {{substantial}} {{reductions in}} motor vehicle emissions {{that have occurred}} since the late 1960 s have been accompanied by continuous increases in vehicle <b>emission</b> <b>control</b> costs, and cost increases or decreases due to changes in vehicle performance such as driveability, power, fuel economy, and vehicle maintenance. In this paper, a systematic approach has been developed to estimate <b>emission</b> <b>control</b> costs for motor vehicles.

This paper does not estimate costs of the changes in vehicle performance and maintenance caused by <b>emission</b> <b>control.</b> Using information on <b>emission</b> <b>control</b> parts and their prices for new light-duty vehicles sold in California in 1990, per-vehicle control costs and total control costs for all new light-duty vehicles have been estimated. The cost to vehicle manufacturers per vehicle for <b>emission</b> <b>control</b> ranges from $ 220 to $ 1, 460, depending on vehicle size and manufacturer.
