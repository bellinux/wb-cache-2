40|$|The {{objective}} {{of the study is}} to identify the entrepreneurial intention among college community students in malaysia. A study was designed to determine the relationship of entrepreneurial intention antecedents perceived desirability, perceived feasibility and propensity of proative behaviour with entrepreneurial intention. The study was carried out in 17 college communities in Malaysia and 253 students were involved to complete a structured questionnaire. The questionnaire was divided into six sections which include propensity of proactive behaviour, perceived desirability, perceived feasibility, breadth of entrepreneurial experience and positive entrepreneural experience, entrepreneural intention and the demografic factors. The analysis shows that the respondents have high in entrepreneurial intention. In this study shows that perceived desirability and propensity of proactive behaviour have positive relationship with the entrepreneurial intention. However. the ananlysis shows that perceived feasibility does not have a positive relationship with the entrepreneurial intention. <b>In</b> <b>addition</b> <b>to</b> <b>that,the</b> study would also like to see the relationship of the breadth of entrepneurial experience and positive entrepreneurial experience with those three indenpendent variables. This research proposed one model od entrepreneurial intention which uses theoretical framework mainly from Ajzen-Fishbeins intention theory (1980),Shaperos intention model (1982, entrepreneurial intention by Kruger and Carsrud (1993) and the theory of proactive personality by bateman and crant (1993). The Study can provide feedback to the management in order to improve the entrepreneurial programme and trainning which can increase the level of entrepreneurial intention among college community students in Malaysia...|$|E
40|$|The {{presence}} of Acrylic Acid (AA) in process {{water is the}} major problem in many industries which are using AA. There are no proper methods available to remove AA from process water and hence the industries incinerating the process water containing AA to remove it. This method consumes large amount of natural gas and in turn leads to high energy consumption. This research attempt to remove AA via batch adsorption process by using activated carbon based coconut shell. The process water that taken from BASF Petronas Chemicals Sdn Bhd containing 4 wt % of AA is used as sample water in this study. The adsorption capacity was tested by varying different size of activated carbon (granular and powder) amount of activated carbon and contact time. The initial and final concentration of AA was tested by using High performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). The performance of adsorption process is modeled using three types of adsorption isotherms namely,Langmuir isotherms, Freundlich isotherm and Redlich-peterson isotherm. From the experimental results {{it was found that}} the activated carbon based coconut shell was good in removing AA from process water and Langmuir isotherm describe the process well compared to other two isotherms with value R 2 = 0. 94278 %. The maximum capacity of adsorption by using activated carbon based coconut shell was found, qm = 94. 3396 mg/g with the dosage used of 400 g/L. <b>In</b> <b>addition</b> <b>to</b> <b>that,the</b> adsorption of acrylic acid onto powder activated carbon represents the favorable process...|$|E
40|$|Writing {{is one of}} the {{language}} skills that belongs to MKK (Matakuliah Keilmuan dan Keterampilan) subject. This subject provides the students with basic knowledge and skill. As MKK subject, writing is a compulsory subject for the students of English Department of UTM. Related to the implementation of competency- based curriculum in SMP and SMU, English Department of UTM applies text- based syllabus for writing. However, the students still find difficulties in developing paragraphs. The problems addressed in the research are (1) to what extent can Thematic Progress Patterns with Cooperative Learning Method (TP-CL) improve the students writing skill. (2) to what extent Thematic Progression Patterns with Cooperative Learning Method (TP-CL) is effective forteaching writing; The data used in the research were the paragraphs that were written by the fourth semester Students of English Department of UTM who took writing 3 subject in 2011 / 2012 Academic Year. To analyze the effectiveness of TP-CL in teaching paragraph writing, the writer followed Blum in Nunan theory (1994) and Constant Comparative method developed by Glaser and Strauss (1999). This method consists of four stages. They are comparing incidents applicable to each category, integrating categories and their properties, delimiting the theory, and writing the theory. Besides that, I also applied simple quantification (descriptive statistics) in this Classroom Action Research in order to show whether or not introducing Thematic Progression patterns with Cooperative Learning Method can improve the students competence in developing the paragraph. Vol. 39 No. 2, 15 Agustus 2013 : 94 - 116 The result of the research shows that the implementation of TP-CL can make the teaching- learning activity of writing class effective. In addition to that, it was proved that introducing Thematic Progression Patterns can improve the students writing skill. The results suggest that writing lecturers should introduce text- types to the students as well as how to develop the paragraph in order that they can write paragraphs coherently and various Theme in order that they can write the paragraph artistically. <b>In</b> <b>addition</b> <b>to</b> <b>that,the</b> application of various cooperative learning methods can make the teaching- learning process effective Key Words: Thematic Progression, Cooperative Learning Method, Writing, Effective Teaching...|$|E
