40|$|<b>Salt</b> {{marsh and}} <b>meadow</b> {{vegetation}} belong to very {{specific type of}} azonal ecosystem. There develop is made possible because of high concentrations of salts in the substrate. On the coast the development results from the contact of shore area with seawater. The existence of <b>inland</b> <b>salt</b> <b>meadow</b> is depending on specific climatic, geological and pedological conditions. Plants (halophytes) developed specific types of adaptation to resist high level of salinity and other extreme conditions of their habitat. During evolution occurred this type of adaptation in several phylogenetic lineages independently. Structure and physiognomy of <b>salt</b> marsh and <b>meadow</b> vegetation depend {{on the degree of}} salinity of the substrate and we can distinguish several zones on this gradient. Climatic conditions during the pleniglacial were very favourable for the development of halophyte vegetation. The oldest salt marshes, which played role of the refuge, are located on the coast, but also in the inland of Central Asia. This kind of vegetation reaches also south part of Central and Eastern Europe. After glaciation and the arrival of the forest, big part of this vegetation disappeared. Some inland areas have been maintained thanks to a man, which has used them since Neolithic times as pastures. With the abolition of grazing, [...] ...|$|R

The 2.5 mi of trails at <b>Salt</b> <b>Meadow</b> wind through grassland, forest, and marsh habitats. The 9 acre of fields support woodcock, bluebirds, tree swallows, wild turkeys and numerous species of butterflies and dragonflies. Birdwatchers can expect to see great egrets, glossy ibis, snowy egrets, belted kingfishers, osprey, red tailed hawk, and many other species. Mammal species include red fox, white-tailed deer, skunk, and coyote. In partnership with Potopaug Audubon Society, the refuge hosts many wildlife events at <b>Salt</b> <b>Meadow</b> Unit throughout the year.

50|$|St. Peter-Ording is {{situated}} on the North Sea coast, on the western tip of the Eiderstedt peninsula, approx. 45 km southwest of Husum. Part of the municipality lies in the Schleswig-Holstein Wadden Sea National Park. Its characteristics include a beach that is approximately 12 kilometers long and up to one kilometre wide, the dunes, the <b>salt</b> <b>meadows</b> and the cultivated forested areas, atypical for this region. The <b>salt</b> <b>meadows</b> are of special ecological importance, since they belong to the few <b>salt</b> <b>meadows</b> that remain in their natural state. In contrast to other <b>salt</b> <b>meadows</b> along the North Sea they contain numerous ponds and puddles. The landward side is flooded with sea water only occasionally and not every year, so that amphibians such as grass frogs, moor frogs and toads (Bufo bufo) live uncharacteristically close to the seashore. Even the Natterjack Toad (Bufo calamita) is able to reproduce successfully in this environment.|$|R
