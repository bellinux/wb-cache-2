The brick {{wall of the}} new church cracked. The walls {{of a number of}} other buildings cracked. The rafters of the roof of the tide <b>gauge</b> <b>box</b> set {{up at the end of}} the breakwater (on Del Morro Island) came out of their grooves, the roof collapsed and carried the instrument and the box with it into the water. Pile wooden homes rocked so strongly in a north-south direction, that 8 cm gaps appeared in the ground at the foundations. The corrugated roof of the lower shed was bent in by the collision of two adjacent sheds. The embankments connecting Tumaco Island with adjacent islands crumbled and cracked. Bottles, vases, dishes, cameras, typewriters, etc. fell and broke. Water splashed out of tubs. The telegraph link between Tumaco and La Espriella was out of commission for 24 hours because of fallen posts. A resident of the city was injured. Eyewitnesses between Tumaco and Esmeraldas found it difficult to remain standing. Water gushed out of cracks in the ground on Manglares Cape, and trees fell.|$|E
40|$|Both {{strength}} and durability of concrete are now considered as significant issues for concrete structures. In BS 8110 : Part 1 : 1985, the improved durability of concrete {{is achieved by}} using mixes with higher strength such as Grades 25 and 30. However, a recent survey has found that volume batched nominal mix of 1 : 2 : 4 (20 mm) is still used in many construction sites in Sri Lanka, especially in the outstation sites. Though this mix gives 28 days compressive strength of 20 N/mm 2, the long term durability of this concrete specially when exposed to aggressive environment is questionable. This could be an undesirable situation which should be corrected with both short term and long term solutions. The concrete mixes such as 1 : 1. 5 : 3 and 1 : 1 : 2 recommended for Grades 25 and 30 are also not often used since they are expensive. It is shown that these two mixes could contain about 375 kg/m 3 and 485 kg/m 3, respectively. These are quite high cement contents and hence indicated the possibility for reduction {{to make them more}} cost effective. However, in all these mixes, the fine to coarse aggregate ratio was maintained at 1 : 2 so that the same gauge boxes could be used at the site. In this research, a cost effective short term solution is suggested to obtain Grades 25 and 30 concretes based on detailed experimental programme. It is shown that strengths of 25 N/mm 2 and 30 N/mm 2 could be obtained with volume batched 1 : 2 : 4 nominal mixes by adding extra cement. For Grade 25, 20 % extra cement could be recommended. For Grade 30, it is 30 %. This can be considered as a quite practical solution since an extra <b>gauge</b> <b>box</b> for the percentage increase in volume of cement could be used. With the aid of sorptivity testing, it is shown that extra cement could give enhanced durability. This study was further extended to determine the effectiveness of silica fume with locally available fine and coarse aggregates, It is shown that silica fume could give strength enhancement with certain mix proportions. It could also give the same workability at a lower binder to water ratio. It could also reduce the sorptivity thus increasing the durability.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} the activities required to modify a facility {{and the process}} of characterizing, repackaging, and preparing for shipment the Nevada Test Site’s (NTS) legacy transuranic (TRU) waste in 58 oversize boxes (OSB). The waste, generated at other U. S. Department of Energy (DOE) sites and shipped to the NTS between 1974 and 1990, requires size-reduction for off-site shipment and disposal. The waste processing approach was tailored to reduce the volume of TRU waste by employing decontamination and non-destructive assay. As a result, the low-level waste (LLW) generated by this process was packaged, with minimal size reduction, in large sea-land containers for disposal at the NTS Area 5 Radioactive Waste Management Complex (RWMC). The remaining TRU waste was repackaged and sent to the Idaho National Laboratory Consolidation Site for additional characterization in preparation for disposal at the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant (WIPP), near Carlsbad, New Mexico. The DOE National Nuclear Security Administration Nevada Site Office and the NTS Management and Operating (M&O) contractor, NSTec, successfully partnered to modify and upgrade an existing facility, the Visual Examination and Repackaging Building (VERB). The VERB modifications, including a new ventilation system and modified containment structure, required an approved Preliminary Documented Safety Analysis prior to project procurement and construction. Upgrade of the VERB from a radiological facility to a Hazard Category 3 Nuclear Facility required new rigor in the design and construction areas and was executed on an aggressive schedule. The facility Documented Safety Analysis required that OSBs be vented prior to introduction into the VERB. Box venting was safely completed after developing and implementing two types of custom venting systems for the heavy <b>gauge</b> <b>box</b> construction. A remotely operated punching process was used on boxes with wall thickness of up to 3. 05 mm (0. 120 in) to insert aluminum bronze filters and sample ports to prevent sparking during penetration. A remotely operated cold-drilling process with self-drilling, self-tapping titanium coated spark-resistant filters was used for boxes with wall thickness of up to 6. 35 mm (0. 25 in). The box headspace was sampled for the presence of flammable gases. To further accelerate the project schedule, an innovative treatment process was used. Several of the OSBs were re-assayed and determined to be mixed low-level waste (MLLW) which allowed treatment, followed by disposal in the Mixed Waste Disposal Unit at the NTS Area 5 Radioactive Waste Management Complex (RWMC). The MLLW boxes were certified using real-time radiography and overpacked into custom-built polyethylene-lined macroencapsulation containers. The polyethylene-lined lid was welded to the poly-lined box using automatically controlled resistance heating through embedded wiring in the lid. The work was performed under the existing Documented Safety Analysis since plastic welding is accomplished at low temperature and does not introduce the risks of other macroencapsulation processes, such as welding stainless steel containers. The macroencapsulation process for MLLW not only accelerated the schedule by reducing the number of boxes requiring size reduction, but it also resulted in significantly improved safety with as low as reasonable achievable levels of exposure to workers plus reduced cost by eliminating the need to perform repackaging in the VERB...|$|E

5000|$|Ford {{manufactured}} the Econoline (E300) Box van {{starting in}} 1973. It was Ford's direct {{entry into the}} commercial midsize heavy equipment markets. Prior to this introduction, only larger fleet customers could purchase a roll-up full-rear-door box van. Its release enabled a larger group of business and trades to purchase the vehicles. Ford continues to sell updated versions of this very successful design to this day. It has changed to the E350 but the concept is still the same. The 14 <b>gauge</b> welded steel <b>boxes</b> ranged from 10 feet to 18 feet in length, with an interior height of 6 feet 2 inches. The boxes {{also known as the}} [...] "high cube design" [...] were designed with square corners and edges to optimize their cargo space. This design allowed them to load and carry items with square edges like cabinets, without wasting space due to the ceilings interior concave shape of other manufactures vans of the time. Their roll up rear door is full width enabling much larger and heavier loads to be place into them with a forklift. The E300 Box Van started as a one-ton configuration. They could be ordered with two ton configurations also. When ordered with the heavier suspension they had a payload capacity of 4300 pounds.|$|R
40|$|In this thesis, {{we study}} {{effective}} field theories for doubly heavy baryons and lattice QCD. We construct a chiral Lagrangian for doubly heavy baryons and heavy mesons that is invariant under heavy quark-diquark symmetry at leading order and includes the leading O(1 /m_Q) symmetry violating operators. The theory {{is used to}} predict the electromagnetic decay width of the J = 3 / 2 member of the ground state doubly heavy baryon doublet. Numerical estimates are provided for doubly charm baryons. We also calculate chiral corrections to doubly heavy baryon masses and strong decay widths of low lying excited doubly heavy baryons. We derive the couplings of heavy diquarks to weak currents {{in the limit of}} heavy quark-diquark symmetry, and construct the chiral Lagrangian for doubly heavy baryons coupled to weak currents. Chiral corrections to doubly heavy baryon zero-recoil semileptonic decay for both unquenched and partially quenched QCD are calculated. This theory is used to derive chiral extrapolation formulae for measurements of the doubly heavy baryon zero-recoil semileptonic decay form factors in lattice QCD simulations. Additionally, we study the pion physics on lattice using chiral perturbation theory. For finite volume field theories with discrete translational invariance, conserved currents can obtain additional corrections from infrared effects.

40|$|Failures of box {{culverts}} {{under static}} and earthquake loads can cause significant economic loss. Therefore, {{it is important}} to investigate the soil-culvert interaction of box culverts to understand their responses to such loads. The response of buried box culverts is a complex soil-structure interaction problem, where the relative stiffness between the soil and the structure is a critical factor. Soil arching is an important aspect of the soil-culvert interaction problem, and results in the redistribution of free-field stresses due to the presence of buried structures and leads to an increase or decrease in the loading around box culverts. A series of static and seismic scaled physical model centrifuge tests were performed to investigate the soil culvert interaction. Two different box culvert thicknesses and two Nevada sand relative densities were used to explore the interaction between the sand and box culverts under a wide range of different conditions. The static loading consisted of the soil self-weight of and the surcharge from a surface foundation, while the seismic loading considered the application of seven earthquake shaking events for each test. Several sensors were used in these tests, including tactile pressure sensors, LVDTs, accelerometers and strain gauges. A newly developed method for installing the strain <b>gauges</b> inside the <b>box</b> culvert model is introduced. The responses of the box culvert have been compared for all of the loading conditions. It was observed that the kinematic soil culvert interaction due to the presence of a box culvert, as well as the surface foundation, had a significant effect on reducing the peak ground acceleration at the surface when compared to the free-field peak ground acceleration. The kinematic interaction can provide up to a 50 % reduction and is dependent on the amplitude of the input motion {{at the base of the}} model. Small values for the rocking of the box culvert and surface foundation were also observed, and their values changed with the amplitude of the input motion. The values observed for the foundation were higher than those for the culvert, due to the soil confinement. The lateral movement of the foundations increased as the peak ground acceleration at the base of the model increased. The racking deformation ratio of the culvert was found to change with the thickness and therefore the relative stiffness of the culvert and the soil density. Soil pressures measured by different methods were in good agreement and those obtained from the tactile sensors can be considered to bound the expected behaviours. The soil pressure observed on the culvert top slab had a parabolic shape, i. e., higher values at the edges and lower at the center than the theoretical vertical soil pressure. On the side wall, the horizontal soil pressure increased with depth. The soil-culvert interaction factors decreased at the center and increased at the edges of the top slab, as the thickness and the relative stiffness of the culvert decreased. The seismic analysis showed that the seismic bending moment increased as the peak ground acceleration at the model base and the relative stiffness of the culvert increased. The static and seismic responses of the box culvert were analyzed using the finite difference code FLAC 2 D and the results matched the experimental responses. The validated numerical model was then used to perform a parametric study, to evaluate the effects of: culvert geometric parameters, foundation locations and soil properties for the static loading and only the culvert geometric parameters for the seismic loading. The results have been evaluated for bending moment, soil pressure and soil culvert interaction factors. Based on these analyses, charts and equations are presented to help in assessing the design values of the static soil pressure, static bending moment, and the seismic bending moments around box culverts.
