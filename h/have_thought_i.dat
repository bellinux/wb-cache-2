2500|$|For {{years during}} Gwynn's career, media preseason {{predictions}} declared that [...] "this season" [...] {{he would become}} {{the first player to}} hit [...]400 since Williams in 1941. Relatively healthy in 1994, Gwynn batted [...]394, his career-high and the highest in the National League since Bill Terry hit [...]401 in 1930; he also had a league-leading [...]454 OBP. From April 22 through the 24 against Philadelphia, he had eight consecutive hits and reached base nine straight times, tying Padres records held by Winfield and Bip Roberts, respectively. Gwynn was batting [...]383 at the All-Star break; however, talk of a strike by the Major League Baseball Players Association (MLBPA) was looming, and he wanted to get to [...]400 before that date. He hit [...]423 over 28 games in the second half, and heated up to [...]475 though 10 games in August, when the season ended prematurely on August 11 due to the baseball strike. He was 6-for-9 in the last two games and 3-for-5 in the eventual finale, falling short of batting [...]400 by three hits. Fans were awaiting an end to the strike and for Gwynn to resume his quest for [...]400, but hopes of the season restarting were dashed when the World Series was canceled. He later commented, [...] "I'm not unhappy or bitter that the strike came. I look at it this way: I would have sooner fell short due to the strike than if I would have hit [...]400 and then the strike came. Then people would <b>have</b> <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> would have collapsed down the stretch, instead of being at [...]390 when the strike came and being so close." [...] That year, Gwynn pulled the ball with greater regularity. He was 10th in the league with a slugging percentage of [...]568, which was also his career-high. His 12homers in 419at-bats was a higher rate than in 1986, when he hit a then-career high 14homers in 642at-bats. He won another batting title (.368) in 1995. For the second straight year, he did not go longer than two games without a hit. He led the NL in batting {{with runners in scoring position}} (.394), and he had a then-career high 90 RBI. Gwynn hit in 15 straight games in July, his longest hitting streak since his 18-game run in 1988. He hit 28-for-65 (.431) with 15 RBI during the streak. Although he missed batting [...]400 in 1994, he batted [...]403 during a 179-game stretch between July 3, 1993 and May 9, 1995.|$|E
