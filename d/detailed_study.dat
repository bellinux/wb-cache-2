5|$|The Dutch East Indies {{government}} then commissioned F.C. Wilsen, a Dutch engineering official, {{who studied}} the monument and drew hundreds of relief sketches. J.F.G. Brumund was also appointed to make a <b>detailed</b> <b>study</b> of the monument, which was completed in 1859. The government intended to publish an article based on Brumund's study supplemented by Wilsen's drawings, but Brumund refused to cooperate. The government then commissioned another scholar, C. Leemans, who compiled a monograph based on Brumund's and Wilsen's sources. In 1873, the first monograph of the <b>detailed</b> <b>study</b> of Borobudur was published, followed by its French translation a year later. The first photograph of the monument was taken in 1872 by a Dutch-Flemish engraver, Isidore van Kinsbergen.|$|E
5|$|A Tarbosaurus skull {{found in}} 1948 by Soviet and Mongolian {{scientists}} (PIN 553-1, originally called Gorgosaurus lancinator) included the skull cavity {{that held the}} brain. Making a plaster cast, called an endocast, of the inside of this cavity allowed Maleev to make preliminary observations about {{the shape of a}} Tarbosaurus brain. A newer polyurethane rubber cast allowed a more <b>detailed</b> <b>study</b> of Tarbosaurus brain structure and function.|$|E

The project addresses the issues relating to water management, sustainable fisheries development, community participation and development, catchment area treatment and conservation of wildlife. The Planning Commission of the Government of India, decided in September 2008 that these policies would be implemented {{over a period of}} 56 years at an estimated cost of over Rs500crores (US$100million), and extended the area under management to also incorporate the water of Nambul and other rivers and their tributaries, which are primarily responsible for polluting the Loktak Lake.|$|E
5|$|After {{receiving}} Staines's report, the Admiralty {{decided to}} take no action. In the following years, many ships called at Pitcairn Island and heard Adams's various stories of {{the foundation of the}} Pitcairn settlement. Adams died in 1829, honoured as the founder and father of a community that became celebrated over the next century as an exemplar of Victorian morality. Over the years, many recovered Bounty artefacts have been sold by islanders as souvenirs; in 1999, the Pitcairn Project was established by a consortium of Australian academic and historical bodies, to survey and document all the material remaining on-site, as part of a <b>detailed</b> <b>study</b> of the settlement's development.|$|E
5|$|After the side-scan sonar aboard Geosounder was {{switched}} {{out for the}} ROV (again {{delayed by}} technical issues and more bad weather), the survey ship returned to Sydneys wreck site on 3 April, and performed a <b>detailed</b> <b>study</b> {{of the ship and}} her debris field. Inspections were also carried out on Kormoran and the believed battle site (the latter found to be outcrops of pillow lava), before Mearns declared the search over on 7 April. In April 2015, an expedition to the wrecks by Curtin University and the Western Australian Museum commenced, with the objective of using 3D imaging to map the wrecksites for further study, and to determine if any deterioration since the 2008 discovery requires the development of a conservation management plan.|$|E

5|$|As {{both the}} other {{alternatives}} were discarded, consensus gradually grew for the Flåm alternative, and the Railway Committee for Nordre Bergenhus County recommended this proposal. New plans from NSB criticized {{the mix of}} rack and adhesion railway, and instead proposed a conventional adhesion line all the way. Engineer Ferdinand Bjerke traveled to Continental Europe to study several combined railways. He published a preliminary report in 1911, which recommended an adhesion railway, although he also felt {{the need for a}} <b>detailed</b> <b>study</b> of a rack railway. His final report was finished in 1913, and although it recommended adhesion, it pointed out that the line's capacity would be smaller than predicted and that costs would be three times as high—NOK5.5 million. The plans were approved by the Ministry of Labour and NSB's main board in 1915.|$|E
5|$|Chicago {{earned a}} general score of 7.0 during the Applicant phase, after a <b>detailed</b> <b>study</b> of the Applicant Files {{received}} by the IOC Working Group on January 14, 2008. Between April 4 and 7, 2009, the IOC Evaluation Commission, led by Nawal El Moutawakel, arrived in Chicago to assess {{the conditions of the}} city. The Commission attended technical presentations, participated in question-and-answer sessions about the Candidature File, and made inspections in all the existing venues across the city. Though considered a favorite entering the voting process, and despite personal appeals from such high-profile Chicagoans as U.S. President Barack Obama, Michelle Obama, and Oprah Winfrey, Chicago was eliminated on the first ballot in IOC voting on October 2, 2009, with 18 votes in a three-round exhaustive ballot of the IOC.|$|E
5|$|Darwin {{set out a}} <b>detailed</b> <b>study</b> {{of common}} descent with {{modifications}} by expanding {{on the theme of}} coevolution between local populations of insects and flowering plants that he had briefly discussed in On the Origin of Species. He examined numerous ways in which orchids vary, showing how they had diverged and developed specialised pollen-dispersal mechanisms. The intricate morphology and anatomy of each flower was carefully described. Apparently trivial details were examined in relation to natural selection to demonstrate how slight variations in similar structures of closely related flowers led to specialised modifications that provided various pollinators (insects) with different ways to cross-fertilise. The mass of descriptive detail was a great achievement, but the result is demanding to read.|$|E

5|$|Five males {{collected}} from an M. vindex nest are {{presumed to be}} M. inquilina, but {{the similarities between the}} two species cannot confirm if the males are M. inquilina. While the males collected are morphologically similar to M. vindex males, the head and gaster are darker, and two specimens show a reddish-brown colour {{at the base of the}} first gastric segment, a characteristic that does not occur in M. vindex males. The genitalia is similar, but a more <b>detailed</b> <b>study</b> can distinguish these features among the two ants.|$|E
5|$|In 2001, further {{research}} on the fossils was continued by two American scientists sponsored by the American Institute of Indian Studies, New Delhi and the National Geographic Society, U.S.A. The Americans, Paul Sereno and Jeff Wilson, started {{the reconstruction of the}} collection of dinosaur bones gathered in 1983 and 1984. The team of scientists, after a <b>detailed</b> <b>study</b> of the maps prepared earlier by Srivastava, were able to reconstruct the partial skull, left and right hip bones, and a sacrum. They interpreted the part of a skull and a horn as resembling those of dinosaurs found in Madagascar. Fossils of Rajasaurus were also found near Jabalpur in Madhya Pradesh. In all, the collected fossils include a partial skull, limb bones, hip bones, and vertebrae.|$|E

Piero della Francesca had made a <b>detailed</b> <b>study</b> of perspective, {{and was the first}} painter to make a scientific study of light.

5|$|On {{his way to}} Lima, {{he stopped}} in Riobamba, {{where a group of}} priests asked him to write a reply to a report written by Ignacio Barreto, chief tax collector. The report accused the priests of Riobamba of various abuses against the Indians in order to take their money. Espejo gladly {{accepted}} the task because he wanted to settle accounts with Barreto and other citizens of Riobamba, among them José Miguel Vallejo, who had turned him in to the authorities when he tried to flee Requena's expedition to the Marañón river. He wrote Defensa de los curas de Riobamba (Defense of the clergy of Riobamba), a <b>detailed</b> <b>study</b> of the way of life of the Indians from Riobamba and a powerful attack on Barreto's report.|$|E
5|$|Recent {{studies have}} also failed to find {{evidence}} for well-defined subspecies, which are no longer recognized. Larson (1997) studied the morphological variation in the jaguar and showed there is clinal north–south variation, but also the differentiation within the supposed subspecies is larger than that between them, and thus does not warrant subspecies subdivision. A genetic study by Eizirik and coworkers in 2001 confirmed {{the absence of a}} clear geographical subspecies structure, although they found that major geographical barriers, such as the Amazon River, limited the exchange of genes between the different populations. A subsequent, more <b>detailed</b> <b>study</b> confirmed the predicted population structure within the Colombian jaguars.|$|E

5|$|Several {{volcanic}} {{features in}} the Mount Cayley field were illustrated by volcanologist Jack Souther in 1980, including Mount Cayley, Cauldron Dome, Slag Hill, Mount Fee, Ember Ridge and Ring Mountain, which was titled Crucible Dome at the time. This resulted {{in the creation of}} a geologic map that showed the regional terrain and locations of the volcanoes. The most <b>detailed</b> <b>study</b> of Mount Cayley took place during this period. Little Ring Mountain at the northernmost end of the field had not been studied at the time and was not included on Souther's 1980 map. Ember Ridge at the southern end of the field was originally mapped as a cluster of five lava domes. The sixth lava dome, Ember Ridge Northeast, was discovered by Ph.D. student Melanie Kelman during a period of research in 2001.|$|E
5|$|Slow lorises are omnivores, eating insects, other arthropods, small {{birds and}} reptiles, eggs, fruits, gums, nectar and {{miscellaneous}} vegetation. A 1984 {{study of the}} Sunda slow loris indicated that its diet consists of 71% fruit and gums, and 29% insects and other animal prey. A more <b>detailed</b> <b>study</b> of another Sunda slow loris population in 2002 and 2003 showed different dietary proportions, consisting of 43.3% gum, 31.7% nectar, 22.5% fruit, and just 2.5% arthropods and other animal prey. The most common dietary item was nectar from flowers of the Bertram palm (Eugeissona tristis). The Sunda slow loris eats insects that other predators avoid due to their repugnant taste or smell.|$|E
5|$|The bipedal-quadrupedal {{consensus}} was changed by a <b>detailed</b> <b>study</b> of the forelimbs of Plateosaurus by Bonnan and Senter (2007), which clearly showed that Plateosaurus {{was incapable of}} pronating its hands. The pronated position in some museum mounts had been achieved by exchanging the position of radius and ulna in the elbow. The lack of forelimb pronation meant that Plateosaurus was an obligate (i.e. unable to walk in any other way) biped. Further indicators for a purely bipedal mode of locomotion are the great difference in limb length (the hind limb is roughly {{twice as long as}} the forelimb), the very limited motion range of the forelimb, {{and the fact that the}} centre of mass rests squarely over the hind limbs.|$|E
