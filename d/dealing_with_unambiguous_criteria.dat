40|$|Abstract. The {{problem of}} discriminating among given nonorthogonal quantum states is {{underlying}} {{many of the}} schemes that have been suggested for quantum communication and quantum computing. However, quantum mechanics puts severe limitations on our ability to determine the state of a quantum system. In particular, nonorthogonal states cannot be discriminated perfectly, {{even if they are}} known, and various strategies for optimum discrimination with respect to some appropriately chosen criteria have been developed. In this article we review recent theoretical progress regarding the two most important optimum discrimination strategies. We also give a detailed introduction with emphasis on the relevant concepts of the quantum theory of measurement. After a brief introduction into the field, the second chapter <b>deals</b> <b>with</b> optimum <b>unambiguous,</b> i. e error-free, discrimination. Ambiguous discrimination with minimum error is the subject of the third chapter. The fourth chapter is devoted to an overview of the recently emerging subfield of discriminating multiparticle states. We conclude with a brief outlook where we attempt to outline directions of research for the immediate future...|$|R
40|$|The {{evolution}} of GIS-T is characterized in three stages: the map view, the navigational view, and the behavioral view. The static {{nature of the}} map view favors applications related to inventory and description, and raises difficult questions of accuracy and interoperability. The navigational view adds concerns for connectivity and planarity, and the storage of time-dependent attributes. Navigation also raises issues of representation related to scale, including the need for lane-level connectivity. The behavioral view stems {{from the work of}} Hagerstrand, treating transportation events as dynamic and occurring within the largely static transportation space. Appropriate representations for the behavioral view have still to be worked out. In all three cases the legacies of prior technologies and perspectives are still evident. The paper presents a series of research challenges, <b>dealing</b> <b>with</b> standards, representation, <b>unambiguous</b> communication, economic models, response to new technologies, and application of knowledge gained from GIS-T and ITS research to other fields...|$|R

The general purpose is to propose an internally consistent system of concepts which allows classification of cartographic presentation methods based on <b>unambiguous</b> <b>criteria.</b> For this purpose, in the article the concept of presentation method and the concept of presentation form were differentiated, the cartographic presentation method was divided into stages, and possible data transformation and visualization aspects during application of a method were specified. Then, review of the previous classifications of cartographic presentation methods was conducted which allows differentiation of two fundamental approaches to classification and comparison of the applied criteria. On this basis, the author’s classification of cartographic presentation methods was suggested in which three qualitative and four quantitative methods were differentiated. It constitutes a compromise between accepting <b>unambiguous</b> <b>criteria</b> and the possibility to differentiate methods fixed in cartographic convention...|$|R

This has raised concerns that some of these materials may introduce new risks for humans or the environment.

In October 2011 the European Commission published the ‘Recommendation on the definition of a nanomaterial’, primarily intended to provide <b>unambiguous</b> <b>criteria</b> to identify materials for which special regulatory provisions might apply, but also to promote consistency on the interpretation of the term ‘nanomaterial’. In this paper, the current status of various regulatory frameworks of the European Union with regard to nanomaterials is described, and major issues relevant for regulation of nanomaterials are discussed. This will contribute to better understanding the implications of the choices policy makers have to make in further regulation of nanomaterials.

40|$|This thesis details two {{experimental}} {{tests that}} can be applied to particular quantum states to reveal important information. We begin by discussing the relevant background in quantum information. We introduce qubits and qudits as basic quantum states, and we discuss the evolution and measurement of quantum states. We then discuss quantum state tomography as a means by which to obtain complete information about a state, followed by a discussion of state discrimination as a means by which to determine the state given the promise that it is drawn from some known set. We then discuss relevant experimental techniques in quantum optics, including measurement, generation of entanglement, and generation of single photons from entanglement. The first experiment we discuss <b>deals</b> <b>with</b> the causal structure of a system, which is the description of the origin of correlations between two or more states. The causal structure can be direct-cause, meaning that one state causes the other; common-cause, meaning that both states are caused by another; or hybrid-cause, which is a combination of the two. We perform the first implementation of a new type of tomography to determine the causal structure; this is called causal tomography and functions regardless of whether two qubits are related by a common state, a process, or some combination thereof. We implement a process on two entangled photons so that we can select the exact causal structure that results, which ranges continuously between direct-cause and common-cause structures. Using causal tomography, we recover causal structures that closely match expected results and demonstrate that quantum mechanics provides an advantage in causal inference. The second experiment we discuss <b>deals</b> <b>with</b> the <b>unambiguous</b> discrimination of multiple quantum states. For the first time, we apply the principles of unambiguous state discrimination to high-dimensional systems. Given a state chosen randomly out of d possible states encoded in d dimensions, we implement a procedure for determining which state was chosen; this procedure in theory functions without error. We encode and detect the states in the orbital angular momentum degree of freedom up to dimension d= 14. Although no experiment can provide perfectly error-free measurement due to inevitable imperfections, we obtain an error rate below the theoretical error rate of minimum-error state discrimination for dimensions up to d= 12.
