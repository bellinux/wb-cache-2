40|$|In {{functional}} brain-imaging {{the advantage}} of wide-field microscopy versus the frequently used laser-scanning microscopy {{is the possibility of}} simultaneous recording at different locations with high speed. However, in doing so depth discrimination of the signals is very restricted. In this thesis it is investigated for the first time how the method of structured illumination which introduces optical sectioning into wide-field microscopy can be used for functional brain imaging. A new technique of grating movement for <b>high</b> <b>speed</b> <b>recording</b> with high velocity and a new algorithm to extract fast and weak in-focus signals had to be developed. Thus functional signals could be detected in vitro. Furthermore it was shown in vivo how out-of-focus light lets the intensity of in-focus structures seem reversed in the conventional wide field image. In comparison to the conventional wide-field microscope the signal-to-noise ratio is reduced by light detected from beyond the optical sectioning strength before the sectioning algorithm is applied. Hence the optical sectioning strength used in laser scanning microscopy is not applicable here. A sectioning strength of 90 micrometers which roughly corresponds to the thickness of one cortical layer in mouse was realized. The second relevant factor for the signal-to-noise ratio was scattering in the brain which diminished the in-focus modulation. Its effect can be reduced by a longer excitation wavelength and wider grating bars without strongly broadening sectioning strength...|$|E

The mechanical properties are usually measured as a stress-strain relation. However, wood has an inhomogeneous structure and its properties are greatly affected by environmental factors. Because of the inhomogeneous structure of wood, the average strain over a large sample having several annual rings is not a satisfactory measurement. The local strain levels in the wood need to be defined. This thesis presents a measurement technique based on high speed image acquisition and correlation-based image analysis that allows {{the definition of the}} local strain levels in the sample during deformation. The main goal of the work was the implementation of a high speed image acquisition system and analysis algorithm as well as to complete the measurements. A representative number of samples are analysed to ensure the efficacy of the method and certain conclusions can be drawn concerning the behaviour of the wood. The thesis consists of three parts. The first part presents the measurements along with the test samples and the testing device. The high speed camera and camera optics that were used are also described. The choice of illumination method is discussed and finally there is an account of problems faced during the measurements. The second part of the thesis considers the image analysis algorithms. There is also a brief consideration of several alternative methods followed by an explanation of the basic principles of the Digital Image Correlation (DIC) algorithm. The second part concludes with an explanation of the algorithm used, which employs the same principles as DIC. The final section presents the calculated strain levels from the chosen samples.

The crystallization of the amorphous recording mark {{results from the}} growth of the surrounding crystalline phase toward the amorphous phase. Therefore, the crystallization speed will be affected by the laser spot size. As the laser spot size is reduced, the crystallization speed of AgInSbTe will become faster. Due to this effect, AgInSbTe is considered as one of the promising materials for the high density blue laser recording media. In the past, many people doubt about the application of AgInSbTe for <b>high</b> <b>speed</b> <b>recording</b> due to the experience of CD-RW.

According to the thickness of upper dielective layer, the thickness of the lower dielective layer can be decided between 90 and 110 nm to conform to the possibility of blue laser phase change recording media. 目錄 第一章 序 論……………………………………………………………… 1 1. 1 前言………………………………………………………. ………………… 1 1. 2 研究目的…………………………………………. ………………………… 2 第二章 理論基礎與文獻回顧……………………………. …………………… 4 2. 1 光記錄媒體之發展歷史…………………………. ………………………… 4 2. 2 光碟片之製造、原理與製作方法……………………………… [...] ………… 6 2. 2 - 1 唯讀型…………………………………………………………………… 7 2. 2 - 2 可寫一次型……………………………………………………………… 9 2. 2 - 3 可重複讀寫型………………………………………………… [...] ……… 11 2. 3 相變化材料之發展………………………………………………………… 15 2. 4 GeSbTe與AgInSbTe系列相變化材料之相變機構………………… 18 2. 5 高密度可重複讀寫相變型光碟未來之發展……………………… 19 第三章 實驗方法………………………………. ……………………………… 33 3. 1 實驗設計與流程……………………………………………………… 33 3. 2 實驗步驟與儀器原理………………………. ……………………… 35 3. 2 - 1 使用材料與試片準備………………………. ………………… 35 3. 2 - 2 薄膜濺鍍……………………………………………………. ……… 35 3. 2 - 3 薄膜厚度量測……………………………. ……………………… 36 3. 2 - 4 記錄薄膜光學性質之測量……………………………. ……………… 37 3. 2 - 5 結晶化溫度與活化能之量測………………………………… 38 3. 2 - 6 恆溫相變化反應指數n值之量測……. ………… [...] ………… 39 3. 2 - 7 晶體結構分析………………………………………………. ………… 39 第四章 實驗結果與討論……………………………. ………. …… 43 4. 1 厚度及表面形貌量測………………………………………………… 43 4. 2 光學常數之分析………………………………………………… [...] … 44 4. 2 - 1 折射率n與消光係數k值之量測……………………………………… 44 4. 2 - 2 反射率R及相對比(Rc-Ra) /Rc之量測……………………………… 50 4. 3 熱性質分析……………………………………………………………… [...] 51 4. 3 - 1 結晶化溫度與活化能…………………………. ………………… 52 4. 3 - 2 結晶化反應指數r…………………………………………… [...] ……… 56 4. 4 X-Ray與TEM之結構分析………………………………………………… 59 第五章 光學模擬………………………………………………………. 85 5. 1 膜層結構及光學模擬……………………………………………………. … 85 5. 2 光學模擬結果與分析…………………………………………. …… [...] …… 87 第六章 結論………………………………………………………. 99 參考文獻……………………………………………………………. … 10...|$|E
40|$|Driven by {{the current}} {{insights}} in sustainability and technological development in biorefining natural renewable resources, the food industry has taken an interest in fractionation of agrofood materials, like milk and cereal crops. The purpose of fractionation is to split the raw material in several functional ingredients. For example, milk can be split in fractions containing milk fat, casein micelles, and whey proteins. Traditionally, separation processes in food industry are mainly aimed at separating fluid from a suspension stream. Frequently membrane technology is used this type of separation; membranes seem an obvious choice because {{they are able to}} sieve components during mild fractionation of many foods, which are suspensions by nature, like milk, or are suspended in liquid during processing (such as starch granule suspensions). However, membrane separation is hindered by fouling of the pores by the food ingredients and accumulation of these components in front of the pore, which makes fractionation with membranes more challenging than plain separation of fluid and solids. That is why we have investigated the possibilities of alternative technologies such as microfluidic devices, and evaluated them under conditions required for food applications. Microfluidic devices are currently investigated for fractionation in biological applications, like sorting of DNA or cells. Due to the large degree of freedom in design, these devices are very suited for innovative fractionation technologies. First, we have evaluated various designs available in literature in chapter 2, which concludes that so-called deterministic ratchets are the most promising technology for fractionation of food suspensions. This conclusion is based on the high yield, compactness of equipment, and high selectivity that can be reached with such devices. In chapters 3 6, we report on detailed investigations on deterministic ratchets through 2 D simulation (chapter 3), image analysis in comparison with simulation results (chapter 4), and full 3 D simulations in combination with the previously mentioned methods (chapter 5). In the last chapter, our findings are summarized in classification and design rules, and an outlook for future developments is given. Deterministic ratchets are microchannels, containing a regularly spaced array of obstacles, through which the particle suspension flows. The essential property of these ratchets is that each obstacle row is displaced slightly laterally with respect to the previous row. Small particles follow the streamlines of the fluid, and zigzag around the obstacles, while particles larger than a certain critical size bump into the obstacles, and are consequently displaced from their streamline. The larger particles will continuously be displaced in a direction in which the obstacles are placed, and have a certain angle with the flow direction. The small particles are moving {{in the direction of the}} liquid flow, which implies under an angle of zero degrees. Via the difference in migration angle of the zigzag and displacement motion, particles can be fractionated, and collected from different outlets. An important property of deterministic ratchets is the size of the particles relative to the width of the so-called flow lane, which determines whether it will show zigzag motion or not. This we have investigated intensively in chapter 3 by means of 2 -D flow field simulation. The critical particle size is related to the width of the flow lanes, within which the zigzagging particles will move, and we have determined the flow lane widths for various designs. The distribution of the flow lane width is found to depend strongly on the design of the ratchets. For a limited number of designs the original hypothesis of the inventors of the deterministic ratchets holds, and the flow lanes are symmetrically distributed over the space in between obstacles in one single row. In general, ratchets have an asymmetric flow lane distribution, and typically, ratchet designs suitable for food applications show a strong asymmetric flow lane distribution. An asymmetric flow lane distribution implies that there is not one critical flow lane width but two that determine the type of motion of particles inside the ratchets. As a first approach we have taken these as the first and last (and largest) flow lane width, df, 1 and df,N. Consequently, particles are expected to show alternative motions that are in between zigzag and displacement motion. Its existence has become evident in the experiments described in chapter 4, and we have named it mixed motion. The mixed motion is irregular, in contrast to the zigzag and displacement motion, and has a migration angle which is intermediate between the angles corresponding to zigzag and displacement motion, 0 < _ < _max. The particles moving in the ratchets we have tracked by <b>high</b> <b>speed</b> <b>recording,</b> and the migration angle were quantified through tailor-made image analysis. As expected, the transitions between the different types of particle motion seem to occur on the basis of the critical length scales, df, 1 and df,N. However, this conclusion can not be stated with high certainty because of the large experimental error due to the wide particle size distribution of the used suspensions. Because the ratchets used in chapter 4 has not been specifically designed to investigate various particle behaviors, we have designed new ratchets based on the critical length scales, df, 1 and df,N, via 2 D flow simulations, in order to allow detailed investigation. Although these critical length scales do not take all aspects that play a role during particle movement in a ratchet into account, we have stated that they can be used as an initial guideline for ratchet designs. Next, we have performed detailed and computationally intensive, 3 D simulations, that include the particles. These 3 D simulations are performed to check the validity of the classification rules, derived from the 2 D simulations, that only include fluid flow. The simulation results show that the transition between zigzag and mixed motion occurs indeed at the critical length scale, df, 1, being the width of the first flow lane. However, the length scale determining the occurrence of displacement motion is larger than the last lane width, df,N, and might even be uncorrelated with it. We have concluded that this second critical length scale, df,c, can only be determined via 3 D simulations. The thus obtained classification rules are investigated experimentally and we have been able to correlate the migration angle of many observed particles exhibiting mixed motion, to the critical length scales. This makes us confident, that we now have identified the relevant critical length scales in deterministic ratchets. In the concluding chapter, we discuss the approach that we chose to ultimately derive the classification rules, and discuss the implications of the corrected length scales on the key performance indicators of ratchets, that are relevant to food applications. We find that obtaining the correct critical length scales requires computationally intensive 3 D simulations. Specifically for compact ratchet designs, which are relevant for food application, the critical lane width df,c is not much different from df,N, obtained via 2 D flow simulations - and 2 D simulation may thus offer a more time-efficient way of estimating df,c. Further, we have discussed the existence of mixed motion in terms of selectivity during fractionation for polydisperse suspensions, and have found that the yield, compactness, and selectivity, all decrease, but at the same time it also opens possibilities for fractionation in multiple streams in one step...|$|E
