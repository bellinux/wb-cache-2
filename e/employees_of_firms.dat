Participants were non-disabled <b>employees</b> <b>of</b> <b>firms</b> and cooperative societies; they worked in contact with colleagues with psychiatric problems.

Consistent with intergroup contact theory (Brown & Hewstone, 2005), the positive effects of contact on anxiety and empathy toward disabled colleagues generalized to the whole category of the disabled when group distinctions were salient within the contact setting. Notably, frequent and cooperative contact also reduced implicit prejudice toward the general disabled category. Theoretical and practical implications of findings are discussed...|$|E

40|$|Excerpt] This paper studies {{reciprocal}} interlocks of {{boards of}} directors <b>of</b> large <b>firms</b> where an <b>employee</b> <b>of</b> <b>firm</b> A sits on firm B 2 ̆ 7 s board {{and at the same}} time an <b>employee</b> <b>of</b> <b>firm</b> B sits on firm A 2 ̆ 7 s board. The study of Boards of Directors by those in economics and finance is not new. In fact, Dooley (1969) writes of interlocking directorates, but his definition is different in that he presents evidence of interlock where 2 ̆ 2 at least one director [...] . sat on the board of at least one other of the largest companies 2 ̆ 2. Books by Mizruchi (1982) and Pennings (1980) as well as many articles, for example Bearden and Mintz (1985), Bunting and Barbour (1971) and Mintz and Schwartz (1981) discuss interlocking boards in much more detail from a sociological perspective. Mizruchi and Stearns (1988) study the longitudinal formation of interlocking directorates using a small sample <b>of</b> <b>firms.</b> This paper uses data from the early 1990 s to explore reciprocal interlocks and the effects they have on firms. There are several goals, including documenting the frequency of interlocks and the characteristics of boards that interlock, exploring several different definitions of reciprocal interlock, examining whether interlocks are symptomatic of agency problems, and whether interlocks have an effect on managerial pay...|$|R

40|$|Using {{official}} household micro {{data from}} the Labour Force Survey, this paper examines {{the increase in the}} working hours of regular male employees in Japan under recession from the late 1990 s to the early 2000 s. The most important findings of this paper are that working hours tended to be longer among male regular <b>employees</b> <b>of</b> <b>firms</b> in which (1) there was major employment adjustment, (2) substantial increase in proportion of non-regular workers, and (3) wide variance in regular wages. The results suggest that the existence of a large amount of fixed duties that are necessary to maintain internal organization and transition from the traditional employment system are the main factors that explain the increase in the working hours during the recession in Japan. ...|$|E
30|$|A {{total of}} 250 {{out of the}} 400 {{questionnaires}} of company car drivers were collected in areas with many hi-tech companies by personally addressing employees during their lunch break. The 150 remaining questionnaires were collected after personally addressing individuals who had a company car, working at various small companies. Attempts to create a pure random sample, {{as well as to}} get the cooperation of large firms that offered their employees a company car arrangement were not found to be feasible. Therefore, the disadvantage of a lack of randomness in the survey should be noted. However, the recruiting of respondents was carried out randomly in the places chosen for the sampling. The 230 questionnaires of the control group were collected by personally addressing individuals and <b>employees</b> <b>of</b> <b>firms</b> not offering a company car arrangement.|$|E
40|$|International audienceOver {{the last}} twenty years or so, the firm has changed considerably, {{especially}} with the growing importance of human capital. Paradoxically, the primacy of the shareholder value model has endured. The aim {{of this paper is to}} explore the main theoretical and empirical elements involved to propose a new model of firm governance. We view strategic <b>employees</b> <b>of</b> <b>firms</b> as critical resources because they represent specific human capital. We explain that the inalienable residual rights of control they have over their own human capital are inconsistent with disciplinary models of corporate governance. They rather call for the creation of an internal mode of regulation able to effectively mobilize specific human capital by motivating key employees. This model, which we call the ‘multi-resource model', is composite: we show that it aims to encourage, retain and collectively enrich critical resources by using an original operational system based on complementary instruments of incentive and coordination...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{develops}} a simple model of reputation {{to show how}} firms operating in concentrated sectors can use the sponsorship of (general) human capital investments to trained workers as a device of commitment with prospective employees. <b>Employees</b> <b>of</b> <b>firms</b> that operate in concentrated sectors learn skills that are valuable only for {{a limited number of}} alternative employers. This gives monopsonistic power to the training firm over the trained workers. Foreseeing it, potential employees will be reluctant to work for the firm unless the employer is able to commit herself not to take advantage of such situation. It is argued that human resources policies including the provision of (specific or general) human capital to workers reduces employers ’ commitment costs. Evidence from the 1995 of the ECHP shows that, consistently with the predictions of the model, firms from more concentrated sectors are more likely to provide their workers with training, education and health insurance...|$|E
40|$|NoThe anticapitalist protests at Seattle and Genoa are {{dramatic}} {{symbols of}} a growing collective anger about the of a few multinational corporations. But {{there is more to}} anticapitalism than demonstrations: concepts like participatory democracy and economic solidarity form the heart of alternative but equally compelling visions. Hilary Wainwright, writer and long-time political activist, set out on a quest to find out how people are putting such concepts into practice locally and taking control over public power. Her journey starts at home, in east Manchester, where local community groups are testing Tony Blair¿s commitment to ¿community-led¿ regeneration by getting involved in the way government money is spent. In Newcastle, she joins a meeting of homecare workers and their clients to challenge the threat of privatization of homecare services in that city.

40|$|Although {{there is}} good reason to expect that the growth of {{information}} work and information technology will significantly affect the trade-offs inherent in different structures for organizing work, the theoretical basis for these changes remains poorly understood. This paper seeks to address this gap by analyzing the incentive effects of different ownership arrangement in the spirit of the Grossman-Hart-Moore (GHM) incomplete contracts theory of the firm. A key departure from earlier approaches is the inclusion of a role for an "information asset", analogous to the GHM treatment of property. This approach highlights the organizational significance of information ownership and information technology. For instance, using this framework, one can determine when 1) informed workers are more likely to be owners than <b>employees</b> <b>of</b> <b>firms,</b> 2) increased flexibility of assets will facilitate decentralization, and 3) the need for centralized coordination will lead to centralized ownership. The framework developed sheds light on some of the empirical findings regarding the relationship between information technology and firm size and clarifies the relationship between coordination mechanisms and the optimal distribution of asset ownership. While many implications are still unexplored and untested, building on the incomplete contracts approach appears to be a promising avenue for the careful, methodical analysis of human organizations and the impact of new technologies. ...|$|E
