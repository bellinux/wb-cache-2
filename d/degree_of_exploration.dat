40|$|In this work, {{we present}} a model that {{integrates}} both exploration and exploitation in a common framework. First of all, we define the concept of <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>exploration</b> from a state as the entropy of the probability distribution {{on the set of}} admissible actions in this state. This entropy value allows to control the <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>exploration</b> linked to this state, and should be provided by the user. Then, we restate the exploration/exploitation problem as a global optimization problem: define the best exploration strategy that minimizes the expected cumulated cost, while maintaining fixed degrees of exploration. This formulation leads to a set of nonlinear updating rules reminiscent from the “value iteration” algorithm. Interestingly enough, when the <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>exploration</b> is zero for all states (no exploration), these equations reduce to Bellman’s equations for finding the shortest path while, when it is maximum, a full “blind ” exploration is performed. We further show that if the graph of states is directed and acyclic, the nonlinear equations can easily be solved by performing a single backward pass from the destination state. The theoretical results are confirmed by simple simulations showing that the model behaves as expected. 1...|$|E

This paper evaluates EABC on a larger number of benchmark functions, including both unimodal and multimodal functions. EABC is an improved variant of the Artificial Bee Colony (ABC) algorithm. A major problem with the basic ABC {{algorithm is}} that it is more aligned towards exploitations, rather than explorations, which often leads to premature convergence and fitness stagnation. The improved variant — EABC tries to increase the <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>explorations</b> <b>of</b> ABC by introducing more randomness during its perturbation operations.

This paper extends the experimental studies on EABC by evaluating it on as many as 13 complex, high dimensional benchmark functions, including both unimodal and multimodal, separable and non-separable functions. The results are compared with the basic ABC algorithm.

40|$|A {{major problem}} with the Artificial Bee Colony (ABC) {{algorithm}} is its premature convergence to the locally optimal points of the search space, which often originates {{from the lack of}} explorative search capability of its mutation operator. This paper introduces ABC with Adaptive Mutation Rate (ABC-AMR), a novel algorithm that modifies the basic mutation operation of the original ABC algorithm in an explorative way. The novelty of the proposed algorithm lies in an adaptive mutation strategy that enables ABC-AMR to automatically adjust the mutation rate, separately for each candidate solution of the bee population, in order to customize the <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>explorations</b> and exploitations around each candidate solution, while the original ABC algorithm employs a naïve fixed mutation rate. Besides, a few more explorative schemes and parameter values are employed by ABC-AMR to assist the adaptive mutation procedure.

Results show that ABC-AMR can perform better optimization than the original ABC algorithm on some of the benchmark problems...|$|R

40|$|Introduction Recent {{advances}} in machine learning and artificial neural networks {{have made it}} possible to build robots and virtual agents that can learn a variety of behaviors. However, their learning capabilities are strongly dependent on a number of parameters, such as the learning rate, the <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>exploration,</b> and the time scale of evaluation. These parameters are often called metaparameters because they regulate the way detailed parameters of an adaptive system change with learning. The permissible ranges of such metaparameters are dependent on particular tasks and environments, making it necessary for a human expert to tune them usually by trial and error. This is why most learning robots and agents to date can only work in the laboratory. This is in a marked contrast with learning in even the most primitive animals, which can readily adjust themselves to unpredicted environments without any help from a supervisor.

We define design knowledge reuse as the reuse of previously designed buildings, building subsystems, or building components, {{as well as the}} knowledge and expertise ingrained in these previous designs.

We argue that in order for knowledge to be reusable, the user should {{be able to see the}} context in which this knowledge was originally created and interact with this rich content. We call a repository of such knowledge in context the corporate memory. We describe empirical observations of designers reusing knowledge from their personal design experiences. Based on these observations, we formalize two key activities in the process of knowledge reuse: finding reusable items and understanding these items in context.

40|$|A {{user study}} was {{conducted}} to compare the performance of three methods for map navigation with mobile devices. These methods are joystick navigation, the dynamic peephole method without visual context, and the magic lens paradigm using external visual context.

In the dynamic peephole method the device is moved and the map is fixed with respect to an external frame of reference, but no visual information is present outside the device’s display. The magic lens method augments an external content with graphical overlays, hence providing visual context outside the device display. Here too motion of the device serves to steer navigation.

The present research seeks to understand the family therapy experiences of individuals within their familial context. Two families of three were interviewed using a semi-structured interview guide and interviews were analysed using Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis. Results are presented as two family case studies. One over-arching theme of ???the safety of the therapeutic relationship??? emerged from the accounts of both families.

40|$|Cooperation {{has been}} {{recognized}} as an evolutionary puzzle since Darwin, and remains identified {{as one of the}} biggest challenges of the XXIst century. Indirect Reciprocity (IR), a key mechanism that humans employ to cooperate with each other, establishes that individual behaviour depends on reputations, which in turn evolve depending on social norms that classify behaviours as good or bad. While it is well known that different social norms give rise to distinct cooperation levels, it remains unclear how the performance of each norm is influenced by the random <b>exploration</b> <b>of</b> new behaviours, often a key component of social dynamics where a plethora of stimuli may compel individuals to deviate from pre-defined behaviours. Here we study, for the first time, the impact <b>of</b> varying <b>degrees</b> <b>of</b> <b>exploration</b> rates - the likelihood of spontaneously adopting another strategy, akin to a mutation probability in evolutionary dynamics - in the emergence of cooperation under IR. We show that high exploration rates may either improve or harm cooperation, depending on the underlying social norm at work. Regarding some of the most popular social norms studied to date, we find that cooperation under Simple-standing and Image-score is enhanced by high exploration rates, whereas the opposite occurs for Stern-judging and Shunning.

This proposition is demonstrated by PMMP for hydrothermal Au-Cu deposits (HACD) and by estimating the number of undiscovered prospects for HACD in Catanduanes Island (Philippines). The results of analyses of the spatial pattern of known prospects of HACD and their spatial associations with geological features are consistent with existing knowledge of geological controls on hydrothermal Au-Cu mineralization in the island and elsewhere, and are used to define spatial recognition criteria of regional-scale prospectivity for HACD. Integration of layers of evidence representing the spatial recognition criteria of prospectivity via application of data-driven evidential belief functions results in a map of prospective areas occupying 20 % of the island with fitting- and prediction-rates of 76 % and 70 %, respectively. The predictive map of prospective areas and a proxy measure for <b>degrees</b> <b>of</b> <b>exploration</b> based on the spatial pattern of known prospects of HACD were used in one-level prediction of undiscovered mineral endowment, which yielded estimates of 79 to 112 undiscovered prospects of HACD.
