5000|$|The {{temperature}} {{problem can}} be solved with some combination of a transpiring surface, exotic materials, and possibly heat-pipes. In a transpiring surface, small amounts of a coolant such as water are pumped through small holes in the aircraft's skin (see transpiration and perspiration). This design works for Mach-25 spacecraft re-entry shields, and therefore should work for any aircraft that can carry {{the weight of the}} coolant. Exotic materials such as carbon-carbon composite do not conduct heat but endure it, but they tend to be brittle. <b>Heatpipes</b> are not widely used at present. Like a conventional heat exchanger, they conduct heat better than most solid materials, but like a thermosiphon are passively pumped. The Boeing X-51A deals with external heating {{through the use of a}} tungsten nosecone and space shuttle-style heat shield tiles on its belly. Internal (engine) heating is absorbed by using the JP-7 fuel as a coolant prior to combustion. [...] Other high temperature materials, referred to as SHARP materials (typically zirconium diboride and hafnium diboride) have been used on steering vanes for ICBM reentry vehicles since the 1970s, and are proposed for use on hypersonic vehicles. They are said to permit Mach 11 flight at 100000 ft altitudes and mach 7 flight at sea level. These materials are more structurally rugged than the Reinforced Carbon Composite (RCC) used on the space shuttle nose and leading edges, have higher radiative and temperature tolerance properties, and do not suffer from oxidation issues that RCC needs to be protected against with coatings.|$|E

If fission propulsion systems are to be developed to their full potential; however, near-term customers must be identified and initial fission systems successfully developed, launched, and operated. Studies conducted in fiscal year 2001 (IISTP, 2001) show that fission electric propulsion (FEP) systems operating at 80 kWe or above could enhance or enable numerous robotic outer solar system missions of interest. At these power levels {{it is possible to}} develop safe, affordable systems that meet mission performance requirements. In selecting the system design to pursue, seven evaluation criteria were identified: safety, reliability, testability, specific mass, cost, schedule, and programmatic risk. A top-level comparison of three potential concepts was performed: an SP- 100 based pumped liquid lithium system, a direct gas cooled system, and a <b>heatpipe</b> cooled system.

Many of their buildings have ventilation systems with a type of heat-recovery called âheatpipeâ. This case study focuses on two buildings which have certain problems with these <b>heatpipes.</b> The recovery rates of the existing systems are low, and one building suffers from a warm indoor climate in the summertime. Problems with the indoor climate seem to stem from a faulty installation of the heatpipe. This building does also have considerably higher energy consumption than the other one, which leads suspicions to overloaded fan motors. Â  The main {{purpose of this study is}} to retrieve information about the present situation energy- and ecomonywise.

40|$|A {{final design}} has been {{established}} for a basic Lunar Evolutionary Growth-Optimized (LEGO) Reactor using current and near-term technologies. The LEGO Reactor is a modular, fast-fission, heatpipe-cooled, clustered-reactor system for lunar-surface power generation. The reactor is divided into subcritical units that can be safely launched with lunar shipments from Earth, and then emplaced directly into holes drilled into the lunar regolith to form a critical reactor assembly. The regolith would not just provide radiation shielding, but serve as neutron-reflector material as well. The reactor subunits are to be manufactured using proven and tested materials for use in radiation environments, such as uranium-dioxide fuel, stainless-steel cladding and structural support, and liquid-sodium <b>heatpipes.</b> The LEGO Reactor system promotes reliability, safety, and ease of manufacture and testing {{at the cost of}} an increase in launch mass per overall rated power level and a reduction in neutron economy when compared to a single-reactor system. A single unshielded LEGO Reactor subunit has an estimated mass of approximately 448 kg and provides approximately 5 kWe. The overall envelope for a single subunit with fully extended radiator panels has a height of 8. 77 m and a diameter of 0. 50 m. Six subunits could provide sufficient power generation throughout the initial stages of establishing a lunar outpost. Portions of the reactor may be neutronically decoupled to allow for reduced power production during unmanned periods of base operations. During later stages of lunar-base development, additional subunits may be emplaced and coupled into the existing LEGO Reactor network, subject to lunar base power demand. Improvements in reactor control methods, fuel form and matrix, shielding, as well as power conversion and heat rejection techniques can help generate an even more competitive LEGO Reactor design. Further modifications in the design could provide power generative opportunities for use on other extraterrestrial surfaces...|$|E
40|$|Here let us {{describe}} the trends in heatsinks focusing on those for personal computers. At first, the heat generation rate itself of CPUs {{was small and}} hence the heat density was low necessitating no heatsinks, and conventionally the heat was dissipated into the printed circuit board, {{taking advantage of the}} CPU package made of plastics, through the socket. Then, as CPUs upgraded in integration scale and the design rule for circuit patterns improved in preciseness together with the increasing clock frequency, the heat generation rate continued to upsurge. Consequently, a need for cool-ing using heatsinks arose, and heatsinks based on extru-sions and die-castings were employed for desktop PCs. Later on, as the heat generation rate of CPUs increased higher, these blower-less air-cooling devices were found to be insufficient, so that forced air-cooling using a motor-driven fan was introduced, and this cooling method continues to be used up until now experiencing many improvements 2), 3). On the other hand, with respect to notebook PCs, the heat was at first diffused over the entire casing using its aluminum sheet metal to be naturally dissipated into the air. In the meantime, in 1993, heatpipe was combined with the casing to improve the heat-diffusing perfor-mance, and further, motor-driven fan was introduced thus achieving performance improvements year by year. As it is now some CPUs generate a heat rate of more than 100 W, and those developed for notebook PCs in excess of 30 W. Moreover, the heat generation rate of other devices such as GPU now exceeds 10 W, producing a tendency toward increased temperature within the casing. As described above, the heatsinks of today are used in many crucial places where extremely high performance is required. Accordingly, it is essential for heatsinks to maxi-mize the fin efficiency by adopting <b>heatpipes</b> that outper- 1...|$|E

MASCOT carries four full-scale asteroid science instruments and an uprighting and relocation device within a shoebox-sized 10 kg spacecraft; a complete lander comparable in mass and volume to a medium-sized science instrument on interplanetary missions. Asteroid surface science will be obtained by: MicrOmega, a hyperspectral near- to mid-infrared soil microscope provided by IAS; MASCAM, a wide-angle Si CMOS camera with multicolour LED illumination unit; MARA, a multichannel thermal infrared surface radiometer; the magnetometer, MASMAG, provided by the Technical University of Braunschweig. Further information on the conditions {{at or near the}} landerâs surfaces is generated as a byproduct of attitude sensors and other system sensors. MASCOT uses a highly integrated, ultra-lightweight truss-frame structure made from a CFRP-foam sandwich. It has three internal mechanisms: a preload release mechanism, to release the structural preload applied for launch across the separation mechanism interface; a separation mechanism, to realize the ejection of MASCOT from the semi-recessed stowed position within HAYABUSA 2; and the mobility mechanism, for uprighting and hopping. MASCOT uses semi-passive thermal control with Multi-Layer Insulation, two <b>heatpipes</b> and a radiator for heat rejection during operational phases, and heaters for thermal control of the battery and the main electronics during cruise. MASCOT is powered by a primary battery during its on-asteroid operational phase, but supplied by HAYABUSA 2 during cruise for check-out and calibration operations as well as thermal control. All housekeeping and scientific data is transmitted to Earth via a relay link with the HAYABUSA 2 main-spacecraft, also during cruise operations. The link uses redundant omnidirectional UHF-Band transceivers and patch antennae on the lander. The MASCOT On-Board Computer is a redundant system providing data storage, instrument interfacing, command and data handling, as well as autonomous surface operation functions. Knowledge of the landerâs attitude on the asteroid is key to the success of its uprighting and hopping function. The attitude is determined by a threefold set of sensors: optical distance sensors, photo electric cells and thermal sensors. A range of experimental sensors is also carried.
