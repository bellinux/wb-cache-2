5|$|Shortly {{after the}} first chat with Manning, Lamo {{discussed}} the information with Chet Uber of the volunteer group ProjectVIGILANT, which researches cybercrime, and with Timothy Webster, {{a friend who had}} worked in Army counterintelligence. Both advised Lamo to go to the authorities. His friend informed the Army's Criminal Investigation Command (CID), and Lamo was contacted by CID agents shortly thereafter. <b>He</b> <b>told</b> <b>them</b> <b>he</b> believed Manning was endangering lives. He was largely ostracized by the hacker community afterwards. Nicks argues, on the other hand, that it was thanks to Lamo that the government had months to ameliorate any harm caused by the release of the diplomatic cables.|$|E
5|$|Jacobs {{was living}} with his mother in Manor Road, Tottenham, {{at the time of}} the riot. He had spent time in a {{residential}} school in Reading, and in 1985 joined a Tottenham gang, the Park Lane Crew. He was named shortly after the riot by two of those arrested, and was arrested himself five days later on suspicion of murder. The police had a photograph of him from the night carrying a petrol bomb and a container of rocks, though <b>he</b> <b>told</b> <b>them</b> <b>he</b> had first arrived at the estate after midnight, two hours after Blakelock was killed. In the end he was charged with affray, and in November 1986 was sentenced to eight years by Judge Neil Denison (the longest sentence handed out for affray during the riot, according to Rose), reduced on appeal to six years. Jacobs was one of nine suspects that the Crown Prosecution Service decided not to charge with Blakelock's murder at the conclusion of Commander Perry Nove's 1992–1994 inquiry.|$|E
25|$|When Grossman signed Janis Joplin and {{her four}} bandmates from Big Brother and the Holding Company in 1967, <b>he</b> <b>told</b> <b>them</b> <b>he</b> would not {{tolerate}} any intravenous drug use, and all five agreed {{to abide by the}} rule. When he discovered, in the spring of 1969, that Joplin was injecting drugs anyway, he did not confront her. Instead, in June 1969 he took out a life insurance policy guaranteeing him $200,000 in the event she died in an accident. His yearly premium was $3,500.|$|E

25|$|In mid-August, {{four months}} into his Florida sojourn, Ben {{returned}} to Tennessee for a week. His parents and girlfriend, Emily Greer, said he seemed optimistic. <b>He</b> <b>told</b> <b>them</b> <b>he</b> {{was working on}} getting certified as an instructor so he could find a job {{and that he was}} researching cave diving with an eye toward getting that certification as well. On his nights out with Greer, he told her of plans to eventually start a diving-related business. On the weekend of August 14–15, he returned to Florida, leaving behind a letter thanking his parents for the sabbatical and promising to look after them as they grew older. They never saw him again.|$|E
25|$|Later, Holopainen confessed that, at that time, he seriously started {{thinking}} about breaking Nightwish up. After a gig in Russia, he sent a text message to fellow musician Tony Kakko of metal band Sonata Arctica, telling him {{that he did not}} think he had a band any longer, and asking him what plans he had for next year. After Nightwish's last gig for the Over the Hills and Far Away tour in 2001, Holopainen called their labels Drakkar and Spinefarm, unofficially declaring Nightwish was over. <b>He</b> <b>told</b> <b>them</b> <b>he</b> might produce another album, but he'd never perform another show with the band. The same message was also written on the band's message board.|$|E
25|$|In 2008, Diamond gave filmmaker Greg Kohs {{permission}} to use his songs in a documentary. Kohs, a director from Philadelphia, had met a popular Milwaukee, Wisconsin, duo, Lightning & Thunder, composed of Mike Sardina, who did a Diamond impersonation, and his wife Claire. Kohs followed them for eight years and produced the film Song Sung Blue, but he needed {{permission to}} use Diamond's songs. The movie {{was sent to the}} singer in January 2008, at the recommendation of Eddie Vedder, a supporter of the film and of the duo. Though Sardina had died in 2006, Diamond invited his widow and her family to be his front-row guests at his show in Milwaukee, where <b>he</b> <b>told</b> <b>them</b> <b>he</b> was moved by the film.|$|E

500|$|Bamber telephoned {{the police}} {{from his home}} {{in the early hours of}} 7 August to raise the alarm. <b>He</b> <b>told</b> <b>them</b> <b>he</b> had {{received}} a telephone call from his father—from the White House Farm landline to the landline at Bamber's home—to say that Sheila had [...] "gone beserk" [...] with a gun. Bamber said the line went dead in the middle of the call.|$|E
500|$|Smith {{moved from}} Gloucester to Tewkesbury and then Ross-on-Wye, {{where he lived}} with a female partner. They had a son in 1990 and two more {{children}} in 1992, but Smith left the family and moved to Cardiff when the relationship became difficult. He then {{spent a year in}} Ireland lodging with a travelling family who took pity on him while he was hitchhiking in Athlone, County Westmeath, Ireland. <b>He</b> <b>told</b> <b>them</b> <b>he</b> was an English gypsy visiting Ireland, and they allowed him to live rent-free in a spare caravan, while he contributed a portion of his unemployment benefit towards food.|$|E
500|$|Pratt and Rogers became Rockefeller's partners. Rogers, in particular, {{became one}} of Rockefeller's key men in the {{formation}} of the Standard Oil Trust. Pratt's son, Charles Millard Pratt, became Secretary of Standard Oil. For many of his competitors, Rockefeller had merely to show them his books so they could see what they were up against and make them a decent offer. If they refused his offer, <b>he</b> <b>told</b> <b>them</b> <b>he</b> would run them into bankruptcy and then cheaply buy up their assets at auction. But this was not intended to eliminate competition entirely. In fact, his partner Pratt said of that accusation [...] "Competitors we must have...if we absorb them, it surely will bring up another." ...|$|E
60|$|Abbot Sisois, when he lay dying, {{begged to}} live a little longer, that he might repent; and when they wondered, <b>he</b> <b>told</b> <b>them</b> that <b>he</b> had not yet even begun repentance. Whereby they {{saw that he was}} perfect in the fear of the Lord.|$|R

50|$|According to an interview, Steve Ritchie, a {{longtime}} Star Trek fan, stated that getting the license was a challenge, due to Paramount insisting that they don't {{want to put}} any violence in the game; however, <b>he</b> <b>told</b> <b>them</b> that <b>he</b> would never violate the Prime Directive.|$|R
500|$|Fram reached Funchal on 6September. Three {{days later}} Amundsen {{informed}} {{the crew of}} the revised plan. <b>He</b> <b>told</b> <b>them</b> <b>he</b> intended to make [...] "a detour" [...] to the South Pole {{on the way to the}} North Pole, which was still his ultimate destination, but would have to wait for a while. After Amundsen outlined his new proposals, each man was asked whether he was willing to go on, and all responded positively. Amundsen wrote a lengthy letter of explanation to Nansen, stressing how the North Pole claims of Cook and Peary had dealt a [...] "death blow" [...] to his original plans. He felt he had been forced into this action by necessity, asked for forgiveness and expressed the hope that his achievements would ultimately atone for any offence.|$|E
500|$|Taiwanese {{director}} Ang Lee {{was hired}} {{as a result of his}} work in the 1993 family comedy film The Wedding Banquet, which he co-wrote, produced, and directed. He was not familiar with Jane Austen. Doran felt that Lee's films, which depicted complex family relationships amidst a social comedy context, were a good fit with Austen's storylines. She recalled, [...] "The idea of a foreign director was intellectually appealing even though it was very scary to have someone who didn't have English as his first language." [...] The producer sent Lee a copy of Thompson's script, to which he replied that he was [...] "cautiously interested". Fifteen directors were interviewed, but according to Doran, Lee was one of the few who recognised Austen's humour; <b>he</b> <b>told</b> <b>them</b> <b>he</b> wanted the film to [...] "break people's hearts so badly that they'll still be recovering from it two months later." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Jugband Blues" [...] {{was written}} {{around the same}} time as [...] "Vegetable Man". Both songs contain the same cynical humour, but while on [...] "Vegetable Man" [...] Barrett focuses his humour on himself, on [...] "Jugband Blues" [...] it is {{directed}} towards those around him. [...] "Jugband Blues" [...] was recorded on 19 October 1967 at De Lane Lea Studios. Barrett wanted a Salvation Army band to play on the track. <b>He</b> <b>told</b> <b>them</b> <b>he</b> wanted them to simply [...] "play whatever they want" [...] regardless {{of the rest of the}} group, while Norman Smith insisted on recorded parts. Eventually both versions were recorded and used. About The Salvation Army, band manager Andrew King said that Barrett [...] "wanted a massive Salvation Army freak-out, but that's the only time I can remember Norman [...] putting his foot down." [...] The song features a distinctive three-tiered structure: starting off in 3/4 meter, then into 2/4 and finishing off in 4/4.|$|E

500|$|On 16 August, Rajab {{was sentenced}} to one year in prison on each of three charges {{for a total of}} three years. Charges were [...] "involvement in illegal {{practices}} and inciting gatherings and calling for unauthorized marches through social networking sites", [...] "participation in an illegal assembly", and [...] "participation in an illegal gathering and calling for a march without prior notification." [...] Public prosecutors stated that Rajab's [...] "provocation of his supporters" [...] had incited violence, including the road blockades and petrol bomb attacks. [...] "The Public Prosecution produced evidence that the accused had called in public speeches for a demonstration to confront public security personnel, inciting violence and escalation against law enforcement officers, resulting in deaths during those confrontations", a public prosecutor said. The appeal was scheduled to take place on 10 September. Rajab was placed in Jaw prison. On 20 August, he was allowed to make a two-minute call to his family. <b>He</b> <b>told</b> <b>them</b> <b>he</b> was in solitary confinement with no access to newspapers.|$|E
2500|$|Flegenheimer {{went back}} to work at Schultz Trucking and was soon associating with known criminals.

With the enactment of Prohibition, Schultz Trucking began smuggling liquor and beer into New York City from Canada.

2500|$|Peter Walker, a 49-year-old {{choreographer}} who {{indulged in}} sadomasochism, took Ireland {{back to his}} flat in Battersea. There he was bound, and ultimately suffocated by a plastic bag being placed over his head. Ireland placed two teddy bears in a 69 position on the body. He left Walker's dogs locked in another room. The day after the murder, having heard no news reports of the crime, he called the Samaritans and a journalist from The Sun newspaper, advising them of the dogs, {{and that he had}} murdered their owner. <b>He</b> <b>told</b> <b>them</b> <b>he</b> wanted to become famous for being a serial killer.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>told</b> <b>them</b> how <b>he</b> {{had come}} to buy the {{gasoline}} launch {{and said it was}} big enough to take on board a party of twelve or fifteen with comfort. It was decided to take some provisions along, for there was no telling how long the chase would last.|$|R
6000|$|And then Eustace {{rose and}} made his speech, {{and a very good}} speech it was, {{considering}} the trying circumstances under which it was made. <b>He</b> <b>told</b> <b>them</b> how <b>he</b> {{had fallen in love with}} Augusta's sweet face the very first time that he had set eyes upon it in the office of his uncle at Birmingham. <b>He</b> <b>told</b> <b>them</b> what <b>he</b> had felt when, after getting some work in London, he had returned to Birmingham to find his lady-love flown, and of what he had endured when he heard that she was among the drowned on board the Kangaroo.

50|$|His {{arrest was}} the result of police investigative work {{following}} the arrest of two other ETA suspects who said <b>he</b> <b>told</b> <b>them</b> that <b>he</b> had killed the two officers in Capbreton on 1 December 2007.

2500|$|The idea {{to create}} the {{settlement}} of Netanya was drawn up {{at a meeting of}} the Bnei Binyamin association in Zikhron Ya'akov. The location was decided upon near the ancient site of Poleg, and it was decided to name it in honor of [...] (1848–1931), co-owner of Macy's department store, New York City Parks Commissioner, and president of the New York City Board of Health, who gifted two-thirds of his personal fortune to projects benefiting Jews and Arabs in Palestine. [...] "Netanya...was named for Straus in the hope he would donate money to them. When <b>he</b> <b>told</b> <b>them</b> <b>he</b> had no more money to give they were disappointed, but decided to keep the city's name anyway." [...] In 1928 members of Bnei Binyamin and Hanote, an organisation set up after Straus was informed of the establishment of the settlement, purchased [...] of Umm Khaled lands.|$|E
2500|$|Nimoy became [...] "excited" [...] {{about the}} {{prospect}} of portraying Spock once more after he had seen The Wrath of Khan. Paramount Pictures approached him to see if he wanted to play Spock once more, but coupled with a desire to achieve a film career outside of the franchise, <b>he</b> <b>told</b> <b>them</b> <b>he</b> wanted to direct the next film. After convincing studio chief Michael Eisner that he had not had the death of Spock included in his contract for the previous film, and he did not hate Star Trek as Eisner believed, Nimoy was given the job. Eisner immediately joked that the title could be [...] "Leonard Nimoy directs The Search for Spock", and although other story ideas were considered, the general premise remained. One idea which was ruled out, was to have Spock appear in a ghost-like form, similar to Alec Guinness as Obi-Wan Kenobi in The Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi.|$|E
2500|$|On Sunday afternoon, August 31, a {{crowd of}} 2,700, 800 of them women and children, marched in sweltering heat to pack the Palestra, a [...] "colossal oven," [...] where Moyer {{encouraged}} them to continue early morning picketing, telling them they {{had the right to}} peacefully persuade men to stay away from work. The WFM Executive Board fully sanctioned their strike, <b>he</b> <b>told</b> <b>them.</b> <b>He</b> had told reporters that the WFM had all kinds of money, piles and stacks of it. He assured the strikers that benefits would be forthcoming: the WFM had $161,000 [...] "in cash here"; an assessment of $2 had been levied for September on each WFM member—90,000 of them, Moyer had said, doubling the actual membership figure. The $161,000 had included the loans he hoped to procure, but he did not tell them that. Rather, he depicted a financially secure WFM, ready and able to finance the strike, a characterization that was most unreal. The strikers passed resolutions calling for a Senate investigation, protesting the militia, and denouncing the deputies.|$|E
