There are 19 pins, with bandwidth to carry all SDTV, EDTV, HDTV, and 4K UHD modes. It is electrically compatible with single-link DVI-D.|$|E
25|$|The Wii Remote also {{features}} an expansion port {{at the bottom}} which allows various functional attachments to be added. The connector, and any accessories that attach to it, use a 400kHz I²C protocol. This expandability {{is similar to that}} available with the port on the Nintendo 64 controller. A <b>female</b> <b>connector</b> is found on Wii remotes while expansions use a male connector.|$|E
25|$|At {{one time}} three-pin XLR {{connectors}} {{were also used}} extensively on loudspeaker cables, as when first introduced they represented a new standard of ruggedness, and economic alternatives were not readily available. Often, two-conductor loudspeaker cable had three-pin female connectors on both ends, to distinguish it from a three-conductor shielded signal level cable, which has a <b>female</b> <b>connector</b> {{at one end and}} a male at the other. Either pin 2 or 3 was live, depending on the manufacturer, with pin 1 always the 'earthy' return. This usage is now both obsolete and dangerous to equipment but is still sometimes encountered, especially on older equipment. For example, some loudspeakers have a built-in male connector as an input connector for speaker-level signal. This use was superseded in professional audio applications by the Neutrik Speakon connector.|$|E
50|$|Port {{connectors}} may be male or <b>female,</b> but <b>female</b> <b>connectors</b> {{are much}} more common. Bent pins are easier to replace on a cable than on a connector attached to a computer, so it was common to use <b>female</b> <b>connectors</b> for the fixed side of an interface.|$|R
5000|$|Some cords contain {{multiple}} <b>female</b> <b>connectors</b> {{in close}} proximity of one another; others have <b>female</b> <b>connectors</b> spaced {{along the length of}} the cord. Cords generally contain either grounded or ungrounded connectors. While a grounded male connector can be forced into an ungrounded female socket, this is unsafe.|$|R

2500|$|Where XLR {{connectors}} {{are used}} for DC power, the genders are reversed {{with respect to their}} standard use for line-level and mic-level audio. Typically, audio signals on XLR connectors [...] "follow the pin," [...] such that a male connector is an output and a <b>female</b> <b>connector</b> is an input. In most power applications (not just XLR connectors) the <b>female</b> <b>connector</b> is the output and the male connector is the input. This makes accidental contact with live parts less likely. In audio devices it also prevents accidental application of DC power to signal inputs.|$|E
2500|$|Most NEMA {{connectors}} {{are named}} following a simple alphanumeric code consisting of: a numeral preceding a hyphen, a numeral following the hyphen, and letters {{at the beginning}} and end of the code to indicate whether the connector is a locking type and whether it is a plug (male connector) or the corresponding receptacle [...] (<b>female</b> <b>connector).</b>|$|E

50|$|RS-232 devices may be {{classified}} as Data Terminal Equipment (DTE) or Data Circuit-terminating Equipment (DCE); this defines at each device which wires will be sending and receiving each signal. According to the standard, male connectors have DTE pin functions, and <b>female</b> <b>connectors</b> have DCE pin functions. Other devices may have any combination of connector gender and pin definitions. Many terminals were manufactured with <b>female</b> <b>connectors</b> but were sold with a cable with male connectors at each end; the terminal with its cable satisfied the recommendations in the standard.|$|R
50|$|Pigtails {{can have}} <b>female</b> or male <b>connectors.</b> <b>Female</b> <b>connectors</b> could be mounted {{in a patch}} panel, often in pairs {{although}} single-fiber solutions exist, {{to allow them to}} be connected to endpoints or other fiber runs with patch fibers.

50|$|Electronic {{designers}} often select <b>female</b> jack <b>connectors</b> for fixed mounting {{on electronic}} equipment they design. This is usually done because <b>female</b> <b>connectors</b> are {{more resistant to}} damage or contamination, {{by virtue of their}} concealed or recessed electrical contacts. A damaged motherboard connector can result in the scrapping of an expensive piece of electronic equipment. The risk of expensive damage is reduced by relegating the more exposed male contacts to connecting cables, which can be repaired or replaced at lower cost.|$|R
