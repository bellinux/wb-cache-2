40|$|Notch stress {{formulae}} {{are derived}} {{for the application}} of a notch stress approach to the fatigue assessment of spot welds. A <b>keyhole</b> <b>notch</b> is assumed to describe the edge of the weld spot between the overlapping plates. The stress fields at the <b>keyhole</b> <b>notch</b> under 'singular' and 'non-singular' in-plane loading modes inclusive of the stress concentration factors K-t are derived from the relevant Airy stress functions. The formulae are applied to typical loading cases of spot welds and compared with finite element solutions. Fatigue-effective notch stresses inclusive of fatigue notch factors K-f are calculated by applying the microstructural support hypothesis of Neuber. The notch stresses at the keyhole are also derived for out-of-plane shear loading based on the relevant harmonic stress functions. The multiaxial notch stresses at the weld spot edge are thus completely described...|$|E
40|$|Closed form {{expressions}} of stress distributions for V-notches with end holes and varying opening angles are presented. The {{solution for the}} elastic plane problem is obtained {{by means of the}} Kolosov-Muskhelishvili approach by using a reduced number of complex terms. The exponents of the potential functions are simple combinations of Williams' eigenvalues for pointed V-notches in mode I and mode II. The degree of accuracy of the new solution, which is approximate, is found to be very satisfactory for engineering applications. When the V-notch opening angle is equal to zero, the solution matches the <b>keyhole</b> <b>notch</b> solutions already reported in the literature by Neuber (for mode I) and by Kullmer and Radaj (mode I and mode II) and based on the Airy stress function. In parallel, the out-of-plane problem is solved by means of an holomorphic function H(z) where the exponent is still linked to the leading order eigenvalue of the pointed V-notch in mode III. For this loading mode the solution is exact. When the notch opening angle is equal to zero and also the notch root radius tends to zero the solution matches Kullmer's <b>keyhole</b> <b>notch</b> solution...|$|E
40|$|Several lately {{proposed}} modifications or variants {{of the structural}} stress or strain concepts, of the notch stress or strain concepts (also termed 'local stress or strain concepts') and of the fracture mechanics concepts of fatigue assessment of welded joints are reviewed, whereas the wider context is presented in a recently republished and actualised standard work. The structural stress concepts described first {{are based on a}} linearisation of the stress distribution across the plate thickness or along the anticipated crack path and, alternatively, on the structural stress 1 mm in depth below the weld toe. The structural stress is defined and set against design S-N curves. A further structural stress concept is presented for welded joints in thin-sheet steels and aluminium alloys. Among the elastic notch stress concepts, the variant with the reference notch radius, rho(r) = 1 mm, recently verified also for welded joints in aluminium alloys with plate thicknesses t >= 5 mm and the variant with a small-size reference notch radius, rho(r) = 0. 05 mm, applicable to welded joints in thin-sheet materials, are outlined. The elastic-plastic notch strain concept is applied to a spot-welded tensile-shear specimen starting from a small-size <b>keyhole</b> <b>notch</b> at the nugget edge. The novel notch stress intensity factor (NSIF) approach relating to crack initiation and extrapolated to final fracture of seam-welded joints in steels and in aluminium alloys is reviewed. A more recently developed crack propagation approach for spot welds is finally described...|$|E
40|$|The {{notch stress}} {{intensity}} factor (NSIF) based analytical frame {{is applied to the}} slit tips (or weld roots) of welded joints with inclusion of the T-stress component. This T-stress can be determined from FE models evaluating the ligament stresses close to the pointed slit tip. An alternative analytical frame is presented for the corresponding <b>keyhole</b> <b>notches</b> based on analytical solutions from the literature, which are applied to the ligament stresses. In the slit tip models, the mean local strain energy density (SED) with inclusion of the T-stress effect is determined analytically and numerically in comparison, using two different fatigue-relevant control radii, R(0) = 0. 28 mm and R(0) = 0. 15 mm, the former value well proven for thick-sheet welded joints made of structural steel. The latter smaller value is tentatively proposed for thin-sheet welded joints, in the direction suggested in the recent literature where a reduction of the microstructural support length for laser beam welds and resistance spot welds is recommended. The FEM-based and analytical stress concentration factors (SCF) for the lap joint keyhole model and also the SED values for the corresponding pointed slit tips are found to be in good agreement. The J-integral consisting of the first and second component (the latter containing the T-stress) is compared with the corresponding SED values...|$|R
40|$|Several fatigue {{failures}} are initiating {{from the}} root of non-penetrating welds, which are widely applied in several industrial sectors. The structural optimization and reduction of weld material increase the danger of root cracking. The fatigue assessment during design is mainly based on the nominal, structural hot-spot or notch stress approach. These approaches are only partly applicable to weld roots, give rough estimates such as the nominal stress approach or over-conservative life estimation such as occasionally the notch stress approach when <b>keyhole</b> <b>notches</b> are modelled. An alternative assessment is possible with the crack propagation approach assuming the non-welded root gap and a short crack at the weld toe as initial cracks. A new approach is the notch stress intensity approach (N-SIF approach) which is able to assess the fatigue life of V-shaped notches at weld toes as well as crack-like notches at weld roots using the strain energy density around the notch. Both approaches are applied to different joints where toe and root failures are probable. The results are compared with a previous analysis using the notch stress approach. Fatigue test results are also available for a comparison which allows to draw conclusions {{with respect to the}} approaches for an appropriate fatigue strength assessment...|$|R
