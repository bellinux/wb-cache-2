25|$|In most {{papillomavirus}} types, {{the primary}} {{function of the}} E7 protein is to inactivate members of the pRb family of tumor suppressor proteins. Together with E6, E7 serves to prevent cell death (apoptosis) and promote cell cycle progression, thus priming the cell for replication of the viral DNA. E7 also participates in <b>immortalization</b> of infected cells by activating cellular telomerase. Like E6, E7 {{is the subject of}} intense research interest and is believed to exert a wide variety of other effects on infected cells. As with E6, the ongoing expression of E7 is required for survival of cancer cell lines, such as HeLa, that are derived from HPV-induced tumors.|$|E

2500|$|This {{traditional}} religious belief in physical immortality was generally denied by the Greek philosophers. Writing his Lives of Illustrious Men (Parallel Lives) {{in the first}} century CE, the Middle Platonic philosopher Plutarch's chapter on Romulus gave an account of the mysterious disappearance and subsequent deification of this first king of Rome, comparing it to traditional Greek beliefs such as the resurrection and physical <b>immortalization</b> of Alcmene and Aristeas the Proconnesian, [...] "for they say Aristeas died in a fuller's work-shop, and his friends coming to look for him, found his body vanished; and that some presently after, coming from abroad, said they met him traveling towards Croton." [...] Plutarch openly scorned such beliefs held in traditional ancient Greek religion, writing, [...] "many such improbabilities do your fabulous writers relate, deifying creatures naturally mortal." ...|$|E
2500|$|According to many scholars, sonnet 55 is a {{poem about}} time and <b>immortalization.</b> The speaker claims that his beloved will wear out this world to the ending doom. According to Alison Scott, the speaker's poem won't last much {{compared}} to his beloved, even though his beloved is immortalised in the poem, adhering to a larger theme of giving and possessing that runs through many of Shakespeare's sonnets. David Kaula, however, emphasizes the concept of time slightly differently. [...] He argues that the sonnet traces the progression of time, from the physical endeavours built by man (monuments, statues, masonry), {{as well as the}} primeval notion of warfare depicted through the image of [...] "Mars his sword" [...] and [...] "war's quick fire", to the concept of the Last Judgment. [...] The young man will survive all of these things through the verses of the speaker.|$|E
2500|$|There {{are three}} types of viral infections that can be {{considered}} under the topic of viral transformation. [...] These are cytocidal, persistent, and transforming infections. [...] Cytocidal infections can cause fusion of adjacent cells, disruption of transport pathways including ions and other cell signals, disruption of DNA, RNA and protein synthesis, and nearly always leads to cell death. [...] Persistent infections involve viral material that lays dormant within a cell until activated by some stimulus. [...] This type of infection usually causes few obvious changes within the cell but can lead to long chronic diseases. [...] Transforming infections are {{also referred to as}} malignant transformation. [...] This infection causes a host cell to become malignant and can be either cytocidal (usually in the case of RNA viruses) or persistent (usually in the case of DNA viruses). [...] Cells with transforming infections undergo <b>immortalization</b> and inherit the genetic material to produce tumors. [...] Since the term cytocidal, or cytolytic, refers to cell death, these three infections are not mutually exclusive. [...] Many transforming infections by DNA tumor viruses are also cytocidal.|$|E

As a result, they are good preclinical models for understanding processes like <b>immortalization</b> and its role in promoting cancerous tumors. The absence of <b>immortalization</b> means a cell can no longer undergo malignant transformation.

50|$|Cancer cells {{require a}} {{mechanism}} to maintain their telomeric DNA {{in order to continue}} dividing indefinitely (<b>immortalization).</b> A mechanism for telomere elongation or maintenance {{is one of the key}} steps in cellular <b>immortalization</b> and can be used as a diagnostic marker in the clinic. Telomerase, the enzyme complex responsible for elongating telomeres through the addition of telomere repeats to the ends of chromosomes, is activated in approximately 80% of tumors. However, a sizeable fraction of cancerous cells employ alternative lengthening of telomeres (ALT), a non-conservative telomere lengthening pathway involving the transfer of telomere tandem repeats between sister-chromatids.|$|E

There are multiple ways in which <b>immortalization</b> of non-stem cells can be achieved, one of which being via the introduction of hTERT into the cells. Differentiated cells often express hTERC and TP1, a telomerase-associated protein that helps form the telomerase assembly, but does not express hTERT. Hence, hTERT acts as the limiting factor for telomerase activity in differentiated cells [...] However, with hTERT over-expression, active telomerase can be formed in differentiated cells. This method {{has been used to}} immortalize prostate epithelial and stromal-derived cells, which are typically difficult to culture in vitro. hTERT introduction allows in vitro culture of these cells and available for possible future research. hTERT introduction have an advantage over the use of viral protein for <b>immortalization</b> in that it does not involve the inactivation of tumor suppressor gene, which might lead to cancer formation.|$|E
