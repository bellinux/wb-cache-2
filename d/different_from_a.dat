People who {{have grown up in}} the Hampton Roads area have a unique Tidewater accent which sounds <b>different</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> stereotypical Southern accent. Vowels have a longer pronunciation than in a typical southern accent.|$|E
5|$|The {{solar wind}} is quite <b>different</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> {{terrestrial}} wind, in that its origin is the sun, {{and it is}} composed of charged particles that have escaped the sun's atmosphere. Similar to the solar wind, the planetary wind is composed of light gases that escape planetary atmospheres. Over long periods of time, the planetary wind can radically change the composition of planetary atmospheres.|$|E
5|$|Justice Hayne {{concluded}} that the detention scheme in the Migration Act did not contravene Chapter III because, fundamentally, it was not punitive. The Act did not make being in Australia without a visa an offence (although {{it had been in}} the past), and in reality he considered the mandatory detention scheme to be not that <b>different</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> system in which all people were prevented from entering Australia without permission at all.|$|E

5|$|R.I.P. 35E {{and other}} citizens' groups {{continued}} to oppose a direct connection, {{arguing that it}} would be no <b>different</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> typical freeway, since drivers {{would be more likely to}} exceed the speed limit if it was a continuous roadway to I-94. Saint Paul changed its mind again in September 1981, supporting a direct connection, along with Mn/DOT and the Metropolitan Council. A bill passed in March 1982 removed the stipulation that the parkway shall not connect to I-94, and allowed Route390 (I-35E) to use Route382 (the parkway). The final EIS was approved at about that time, and several groups including R.I.P. 35E filed suit in early 1983.|$|E
5|$|Shortly after this, Lutosławski {{started work}} on his Second Symphony, which had two premieres: Pierre Boulez {{conducted}} the second movement, Direct, in 1966, and when the first movement, Hésitant, was finished in 1967, the composer conducted a complete performance in Katowice. The Second Symphony is very <b>different</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> conventional classical symphony in structure, but Lutosławski used all of his technical innovations {{up to that point}} to build a large-scale, dramatic work worthy of the name. In 1968, the work earned Lutosławski first prize from the International Music Council's International Rostrum of Composers, his third such award, which confirmed his growing international reputation. In 1967 Lutosławski was awarded the Sonning Award, Denmark's highest musical honour.|$|E
5|$|To the observatory's {{disappointment}} and surprise, Pluto showed no visible disc; it {{appeared as a}} point, no <b>different</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> star, and, at only 15th magnitude, was six times dimmer than Lowell had predicted, which meant it was either very small, or very dark. Because Lowell astronomers thought Pluto was massive enough to perturb planets, they assumed that its albedo could be no less than 0.07 (meaning that it reflected only 7% of the light that hit it); about as dark as asphalt and {{similar to that of}} Mercury, the least reflective planet known. This would give Pluto an estimated mass of no more than 70% that of Earth. Observations also revealed that Pluto's orbit was very elliptical, far more than that of any other planet.|$|E

5|$|Plans for a Hubble {{successor}} materialized as the Next Generation Space Telescope project, which {{culminated in}} {{plans for the}} James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), the formal successor of Hubble. Very <b>different</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> scaled-up Hubble, {{it is designed to}} operate colder and farther away from the Earth at the L2 Lagrangian point, where thermal and optical interference from the Earth and Moon are lessened. It is not engineered to be fully serviceable (such as replaceable instruments), but the design includes a docking ring to enable visits from other spacecraft. A main scientific goal of JWST is to observe the most distant objects in the universe, beyond the reach of existing instruments. It is expected to detect stars in the early Universe approximately 280 million years older than stars HST now detects. The telescope is an international collaboration between NASA, the European Space Agency, and the Canadian Space Agency since 1996, and is planned for launch on an Ariane 5 rocket. Although JWST is primarily an infrared instrument, its coverage extends down to 600nm wavelength light, or roughly orange in the visible spectrum. A typical human eye can see to about 750nm wavelength light, so there is some overlap with the longest visible wavelength bands, including orange and red light.|$|E
5|$|Traditionally, saber-toothed cats {{have been}} artistically {{restored}} with external features {{similar to those}} of extant felids, by artists such as Charles R. Knight in collaboration with various paleontologists in the early 20th century. In 1969, paleontologist G.J. Miller instead proposed that Smilodon would have looked very <b>different</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> typical cat and similar to a bulldog, with a lower lip line (to allow its mouth to open wide without tearing the facial tissues), a more retracted nose and lower-placed ears. Paleoartist Mauricio Antón and coauthors disputed this in 1998 and maintained that the facial features of Smilodon were overall not very different from those of other cats. Antón noted that modern animals like the hippopotamus are able to achieve a wide gap without tearing tissue by the moderate folding of the orbicularis oris muscle, and such a muscle configuration exists in modern large felids. Antón stated that extant phylogenetic bracketing (where the features of the closest extant relatives of a fossil taxon are used as reference) is the most reliable way of restoring the life-appearance of prehistoric animals, and the cat-like Smilodon restorations by Knight are therefore still accurate.|$|E

25|$|The YB-10A was <b>different</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> YB-10 {{only in its}} engines. It used Wright R-1820-31 turbo-supercharged radials, {{allowing}} it to attain speeds of 236mph (380km/h).
