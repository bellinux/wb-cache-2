5|$|On December 2, 2014, ABC aired Toy Story That Time Forgot. In the story, {{the toys}} {{are trapped in}} room {{with a group of}} {{humanoid}} dinosaur warrior toys called Battlesaurs who do not <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> are toys and must escape.|$|E
5|$|Portland had {{strongly}} desired Washington, {{and their}} general manager Stu Inman, {{was a close}} friend of Pete Newell's. Inman had worked hard through Newell to let Washington <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> intended this to be the last time he was traded. This was important as the media coverage and re-locations had been hard on Pat and the children. To his great relief, the city of Portland welcomed Washington with open arms. Portland had one of the more rabid fan bases in the league, and everywhere Washington went he was treated like a beloved celebrity.|$|E
5|$|This module {{starts in}} one of two ways. If the players have {{finished}} Steading of the Hill Giant Chief, they have been transported to the glacial rift via the magic chain. They will <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> are searching for some force behind the giant alliance. If the players are starting with Glacial Rift of the Frost Giant Jarl, then they have been hired by nobles to destroy the frost giants. Either way, a safe, hidden cave is easily found for a base of operations.|$|E
60|$|If Cousin Cramchild says, that {{if there}} are water-babies, they must grow into water-men, ask him how he <b>knows</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> do not? and then, how he <b>knows</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> must, {{any more than the}} Proteus of the Adelsberg caverns grows into a perfect newt.|$|R
5000|$|... 11 Group's {{most famous}} period {{was during the}} Battle of Britain when, due to its position, 11 Group bore {{the brunt of the}} German aerial assault. Pilots posted to squadrons in 11 Group <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> would be sent into certain action while pilots and squadrons {{transferring}} out of 11 Group <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> were going to comparatively safer duty.|$|R

5|$|Bushnell and Gene Lipkin, Atari's {{vice-president}} of sales, approached toy and electronic retailers to sell Home Pong, but were rejected. Retailers felt {{the product was}} too expensive and would not interest consumers. Atari contacted the Sears Sporting Goods department after noticing a Magnavox Odyssey advertisement in the sporting goods section of its catalog. Atari staff discussed {{the game with a}} representative, Tom Quinn, who expressed enthusiasm and offered the company an exclusive deal. Believing they could find more favorable terms elsewhere, Atari's executives declined and continued to pursue toy retailers. In January 1975, Atari staff set up a Home Pong booth at a toy trade fair in New York City, but was unsuccessful in soliciting orders {{due to the fact that}} they did not <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> needed a private showing.|$|E
5|$|Humans {{exist in}} an {{alternate}} Domain, and {{are referred to}} as creatures with no natural defenses. Most believe that they are fictional creatures; but a few, including the Dewclaws, <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> exist. This was developed further in 2003 by the introduction of the character Danielle, a human who enters the animal world via the Bermuda Triangle and transforms into a rabbit. However, she later has a son, Francis, who is born human. The series features jokes on a variety of topics. Many draw satirical parallels between its world and ours, making fun and sometimes social commentary on politics, sports, society, class-snobbery, school, technology, pop culture and corporate culture, for example; in January 2008 the Predator's Union was described as going on strike, in a parody of the 2007â€“08 Writers Guild of America strike.|$|E
5|$|Per {{traditional}} accounts, some Brahmins of Varanasi {{were still}} not satisfied, and sent two thieves {{to steal the}} manuscript. The thieves tried {{to break into the}} Ashram of Tulsidas, but were confronted by two guards with bows and arrows, of dark and fair complexion. The thieves {{had a change of heart}} and came to Tulsidas in the morning to ask who the two guards were. Believing that the two guards could be none other than Rama and Lakshmana, Tulsidas was aggrieved to <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> were guarding his home at night. He sent the manuscript of Ramcahritmanas to his friend Rai Todar Mal, the finance minister of Akbar, and donated all his money. The thieves were reformed and became devotees of Rama.|$|E

5|$|Certain {{events can}} take place while {{managing}} the tower. For example, terrorists may phone the player to let them <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> have hidden a bomb in the building, and that they demand a ransom. If the ransom is not paid, then security services must find the bomb before it detonates, or else the tower will incur significant damages. If the player builds facilities underground, the game may notify them that their workers have discovered gold treasure, which gives the player {{a significant amount of}} funds. At random intervals during the game, there are notifications that state that a VIP will be visiting the tower soon, so the player must prepare for their visit. If the VIP enjoys their visit because of variables such as a comfortable hotel suite and efficient navigation, the VIP will give the tower a favorable rating. A favorable rating would then allow the tower to advance to the next star level, assuming the other qualifications are met. Although it does not have any impact on the tower, {{at the end of the}} fourth quarter every year in the game, Santa Claus and his reindeer fly across the tower.|$|E
5|$|This rockfowl usually lives either {{alone or}} in pairs, {{although}} small flocks of three to ten birds are not uncommon. It normally moves through its habitat {{in a series of}} runs and long, springing hops on the ground and in low branches. It uses its tail for balance while hopping and running. When in a flock, rockfowl hop almost in unison. In the unusual occurrences when the species does fly, it is fast and is capable of navigating through the trees and rocks well. When it is standing still, the rockfowl has its tail down and its head looking up. Typically, it silently evades any unusual movements in their forest. However, if these birds <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> have been sighted, they can become quite inquisitive and occasionally approach observers. This is not a shy species once it knows that it has been seen, and often studies things of interest, including humans, from an open location. When this species is suspicious, it raises the small crown on its head and the ruff on its neck while uttering a muffled groan. It is most active in the early morning and late evening, and from 10:30 am to 7:00 pm remains perched with little activity either in liana-tangled areas or in caves away from the nests. To scratch its head, the species lifts its foot over its head. It bathes in small pools. While its lifespan in the wild is unknown, it has lived up to 25 years in captivity.|$|E
25|$|There {{is common}} {{knowledge}} that all players meet these conditions, including this one. So, not only must each player know the other players meet the conditions, but also they must <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> all <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> meet them, and <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> meet them, and so on.|$|E

60|$|Every morning, very early, Blacky {{flew over}} there, and every morning he found Dusky the Black Duck and his flock in the rushes and wild rice at that {{particular}} place, and he <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> had been there all night, He <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> had come in there just at dusk the night before, to feast on the yellow corn the man had scattered there in the afternoon.|$|R
25|$|We <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> adore a large bird {{similar to}} a kite, which they raise with the {{greatest}} of care from the time it is young, and they hold to many errors regarding it.|$|E
25|$|Truckers {{also use}} their 4 ways {{flashing}} {{up a steep}} hill, mountain roads and on ramps on express ways to let others <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> are traveling at a slow speed and to be cautious approaching them.|$|E
25|$|That's when Shan Mei and Frank meet {{numerous}} times. But both of {{them are}} having money issues so they decide to live together. Little do they <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> both started falling in love with one another.|$|E

25|$|Nominally a {{civilian}} organisation {{that could be}} plausibly disowned by the apartheid government, the CCB drew its operatives from the SADF itself or the South African Police. According to Joubert, many operatives did not <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> were members of an entity called the CCB.|$|E
25|$|These were in many, but not lasted to our time. There are {{multiple}} of them, up to 162 count of signals. We know that {{right wing of}} the army marked with red banners and left wing with yellow. We also <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> are tactical importance to hide the exact number of soldiers.|$|E
25|$|Number Four is {{the primary}} defence player. They can move {{anywhere}} on the field, but they usually try to prevent scoring. The emphasis on defence by the Number Four allows the Number Three to attempt more offensive plays, since they <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> will be covered if they lose the ball.|$|E
60|$|It seems {{unfortunate that}} strong people are usually so disagreeable and {{overbearing}} {{that no one}} cares for them. In fact, {{to be different from}} your fellow creatures is always a misfortune. The Growleywogs <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> were disliked and avoided by every one, so they had become surly and unsociable even among themselves. Guph <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> hated all people, including the Nomes; but he hoped to win them over, nevertheless, and <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> if he succeeded they would afford him very powerful assistance.|$|R
60|$|Happy and frolicsome suggestion! The invitations circulated, and it {{was soon}} <b>known</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> were all to gather at the matin meal.|$|R

25|$|Let {{the nation}} know {{the meaning of}} our numbers. We are not a {{pressure}} group. We are not an organization. We are not a mob. We are the advance guard of a massive moral revolution that is not confined to the Negro, nor is it confined to civil rights, for our white allies <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> are not free while we are not.|$|E
25|$|If {{the patient}} can {{be led to}} accept one suggestion, they will more readily accept others. With {{resistant}} patients, it becomes necessary to find a suggestion that they can accept. Resistance is always important, and should always be respected, so if the resistance itself is encouraged, the patient is made to feel more comfortable, because they <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> are allowed to respond however they wish.|$|E
25|$|There {{are a few}} {{examples}} of medieval noblewomen who acted with considerable de facto independence. Prominent are Lady Ingegjerd Ottesdotter RÃ¸mer of AustrÃ¥tt and Lady GÃ¸rvel Fadersdotter (Sparre) of Giske. It is, however, important to <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> acted as so-called 'pseudo men', i.e. in the formal rÃ´le of a man (usually their deceased husband's, father's or brother's). Legally, {{there was no such thing}} as formal female rÃ´les.|$|E
