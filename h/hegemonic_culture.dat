40|$|Defining {{cultures}} and explaining cultural interaction takes {{us back to}} the formative years of archaeological thinking {{in the first half of}} the nineteenth century, when contributions to leading debates often came from prehistorians and concerned prehistoric times. For later periods, for which literary sources are available, it has been noticed that in ordering archaeological data into {{cultures and}} periods, archaeologists and ancient historians were essentially characterizing continuity and change, an exercise often affected by the interplay of disciplinary structures and professional goals. This is a theme that has been explored for the Punic period by P. van Dommelen in several writings published over the last decade. In exposing the relationship between archaeological representations of ancient colonial situations and the contemporary world he has shown how the dualist conception of colonial situations as a confrontation between distinct entities does not work. Colonial situations are murky and ambiguous; he argues that Punic Sardinia from the mid-sixth century BC onwards is a good example of such a contact situation. Influencing, imitation and creative subversion of a <b>hegemonic</b> Punic <b>culture</b> resulted in the creation of local inventions of material culture, artefacts which are essentially a hybrid. It is not the author's intention here to question the existence of a <b>hegemonic</b> Punic <b>culture,</b> although he believes that to be a valid query. This paper looks at cultural interaction in the Archaic period and takes as a point of departure a class of diagnostic artefacts – metal bowls – commonly held to be Phoenician on account of stylistic idiosyncrasies. The author's principal point in reviewing the definition of a culture considered to be the progenitor of the Punic one is to widen the limited perspective that considers only the ultimate origin of certain stylistic features in material culture so that it includes one that takes as its central aims a social analysis.

50|$|Hegemony was {{a concept}} {{previously}} used by Marxists such as Vladimir Ilyich Lenin {{to indicate the}} political leadership of the working-class in a democratic revolution, but developed by Gramsci into an acute analysis {{to explain why the}} 'inevitable' socialist revolution predicted by orthodox Marxism had not occurred by the early 20th century. Capitalism, it seemed, was even more entrenched than ever. Capitalism, Gramsci suggested, maintained control not just through violence and political and economic coercion, but also ideologically, through a <b>hegemonic</b> <b>culture</b> in which the values of the bourgeoisie became the 'common sense' values of all.

5000|$|One of {{the central}} ideas for many {{critical}} theorists {{is the idea of}} the subject. Rey Chow studies the idea of subjectivity in light of ethnicity, especially the subjectivity of ethnic minorities. In exploring the ethnic subject, she builds on the ideas of Foucault alongside psychoanlytic concepts. One of her central concepts concerning the ethnic subject states that the individual becomes ethnic through the pressure created by social systems to do self-confessional literature, or literature that seeks to explore one's own ethnicity. Through this idea, she challenges the conventional idea that these self-confessional writings can create ethnic liberation. In her book, The Protestant Ethnic and the Spirit of Capitalism, Chow says thatWhen minority individuals think that, by referring to themselves, they are liberating themselves from the powers that subordinate them, they may actually be allowing such powers to work in the most intimate fashion from within their hearts and souls, in a kind of voluntary surrender that is, in the end, fully complicit with the guilty verdict that has been declared on them socially long before they speak.For Chow then, the self-confessional literature allows the <b>hegemonic</b> <b>culture</b> to evoke a stereotyped ethnicity from individuals. In describing this stereotyped ethnicity, she focuses on how individuals must act [...] "authentic" [...] in representing an ethnic culture or they become the focus of criticism. Thus society interpellates individuals to perform ethnicity, but the individual only imitates a certain standard of authentic ethnicity because of the coercion created by the larger society. Chow calls these performance of ethnicity [...] "coercive mimeticism", because the individual only simulates ethnicity in reaction to the social pressure placed on that individual to fulfill a certain ethnic role. Also, Chow describes how often the individual who provide the coercion are not of the <b>hegemonic</b> <b>culture,</b> but rather members of ethnic communities. Ethnic individuals become the main source of criticism for other individuals not being [...] "ethnic enough". Thus, for Chow, identification of individuals as [...] "ethnic" [...] can become a tool for belittling amongst individuals of minority cultures as well as a means of maintaining the hegemonic subjugation of those individuals.|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this cross-disciplinary {{dissertation}} is to explore how magic(al) realist techniques are applied in Toni Morrison’s Beloved and Love and Frida Kahlo’s selected paintings to dramatize the traumas experienced in post-colonial period, and how the artists resist the cultural hegemony through their art works. From the magic(al) realist and Gramscian point of view, the dissertation focuses on 1) the similar situations and cultural hegemony of African Americans and Frida Kahlo had experienced; 2) why and how Toni Morrison and Frida Kahlo chose and used magic(al) realist techniques in their art works to dramatize the traumas; and 3) how Toni Morrison and Frida Kahlo resist the cultural hegemony by applying magic(al) realist techniques in their art works. The results show that in the post-colonial period, African Americans and Frida Kahlo were influenced by the <b>hegemonic</b> <b>culture</b> and the traumas they experienced were caused by colonization and cultural hegemony. Toni Morrison and Frida Kahlo aimed at arousing the awareness of the marginalized people in such situation. Therefore, both of the outstanding artists applied magic(al) realist techniques in Toni Morrison’s novels Beloved and Love and Frida Kahlo’s selected paintings to exaggerate the physical and psychological traumas that African Americans and Frida Kahlo had gone through. In Beloved and Love, Toni Morrison dealt with traumas took place on African American women caused by colonialism and Euro-American <b>hegemonic</b> <b>culture.</b> In order to depict the pain to the most, Toni Morrison blended {{the boundary between the}} practical world and magical world, to make it possible to the readers to share the sufferings that African American women went through in the colonial and post-colonial period. Toni Morrison did not stop at depicting the traumas, she in fact used magic(al) techniques to bring the dead back to the world to dramatize the traumas and focused on the causes for these traumas, that was, the <b>hegemonic</b> <b>culture</b> in colonialism and pot-colonialism. By writing the novels with these techniques, Toni Morrison resisted the post-colonial <b>hegemonic</b> <b>culture.</b> Not like Toni Morrison, who described collective traumas of African Americans; Frida Kahlo portrayed her own physical and psychological traumas by applying magic(al) realist techniques in her selected paintings. She integrated Mexican indigenous cultural heritage and pre-Columbian images in her paintings to resist the influence from the <b>hegemonic</b> <b>culture.</b> She rejected standard western concept of beauty in paintings by combining magical objects with objects in real world...|$|E

All this is of great importance whether the institutional <b>hegemonic</b> masculine <b>culture</b> within the United Nation and its peacekeeping operations, is challenged or not...|$|R

For example, working time norms require these mothers to work exceptionally long hours, to have permeable time boundaries {{even if they have}} negotiated reduced working hours and to ‘socialise’ in the evenings.   Mothers are limited in their ability to protest or implement creative working time solutions because they feel they must hide their motherhood, which in itself creates tension.

40|$|Indigenous social {{movements}} in the Americas have multiple sources, but in regards to Mexican Americans, my focus considers Chicana/o Indigeneity of particular importance to decolonization efforts because of its density, scope, and breadth, as well as spatial location. My dissertation answers the following question: how are Chicana/o assertions of cultural Indigeneity, intrinsically parallel and related to Chicana/o participation in Indigenous transnational struggles? The underlying premises for my investigation of Chicana/o Indigeneity are the following subquestions: how do transnational these efforts enrich {{our understanding of the}} respect of human rights, and what are the bases of Chicana/o Indigeneity? I explicate how Chicana/o historic consciousness is influenced by the complex transnational activism with Indigenous Peoples to decolonize the Americas and contend that Chicana/o Indigenist activists, informed by trans-border interactions, cultural practices, and long oral traditions challenged hegemonic constraints of Indigeneity constructed by Mexican and U. S. pro-western domination premised assimilationist projects. These challenges have resulted in Chicana/o participation in broader challenges to the prominence of western cultural hegemony in the nation-states of the Americas. 	I depict groups and organizations comprising a specific activism that challenge assimilation and contribute to the prominence of contemporary Indigenismo or Indigenism as a cultural and political ideology. This activism, which seeds and stimulates Indigenism, instills calls for cultural assertion within international human rights advocacy. I focus on Chicana/o activists, activist organizations, and cultural groups that demanded the right to revive their Indigenous culture, and in doing so, aligned their cultural revival with the right to cultural survival that is integral to the demands of Indigenous Peoples. Since the late 1960 s, the objective of Chicana/o statements on Indigeneity have provided the forum for a discussion regarding a culturally autonomous trajectory for Chicanas and Chicanos free of colonial logics, <b>hegemonic</b> <b>cultures,</b> and oppression. By no means has this road been straight forward and without equivocations. Nevertheless, by the 1980 s and well into the twenty-first century, most Chicana/o and Indigenous activists stood generally unified by certain precepts and agreements despite national borders in their efforts to redress the violation of human rights in the Americas...|$|R
