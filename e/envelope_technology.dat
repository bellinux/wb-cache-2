New Building codes (existing or going to be approved as the new one of Milano), use the Average Daylight Factor (ADF) as an index of daylighting performance: any of its proposed calculation methods are the simplified ones, based on the Italian standard UNI 10840. This method is effective in preliminary design phase even though the mean value excludes the contribution of the optical properties of outside surfaces. This contribution, on the other hand, could modify the lighting level and the indoor illuminance distribution for high-density urban environments. Furthermore, the reflectance of building envelope surfaces is affected by weathering and soiling. Improved daylight analyses should thus take into account the impact of ageing on the optical properties of building and urban surfaces. Herein we present the results of a numerical simulation activity, by means of ray-tracing model, showing the dependence of DF on urban morphology, and on the reflectance of exterior surfaces.

Methods to evaluate the environmental sustainability of buildings and those to measure operational energy efficiency often do {{not take into account the}} decay in performance of building materials over time. Results of ongoing research conducted at the Politecnico di Milano, Dept.

40|$|With {{environmental}} protection posing {{as the number}} one global problem, man {{has no choice but}} to reduce his energy consumption. One way to accomplish this is to resort to passive and low-energy systems to maintain thermal comfort in buildings. The conventional and modern designs of wind towers can successfully be used in hot arid regions to maintain thermal comfort (with or without the use of ceiling fans) during all hours of the cooling season, or a fraction of it. Climatic design is one of the best approaches to reduce the energy cost in buildings. Proper design is the first step of defence against the stress of the climate. Buildings should be designed according to the climate of the site, reducing the need for mechanical heating or cooling. Hence maximum natural energy can be used for creating a pleasant environment inside the built <b>envelope.</b> <b>Technology</b> and industry progress in the last decade diffused electronic and informatics' devices in many human activities, and also in building construction. The utilisation and operating opportunities components, increase the reduction of heat losses by varying the thermal insulation, optimise the lighting distribution with louver screens and operate mechanical ventilation for coolness in indoor spaces. In addition to these parameters the intelligent envelope can act for security control and became an important part of the building domotic revolution. Application of simple passive cooling measure is effective in reducing the cooling load of buildings in hot and humid climates. Fourty-three percent reductions can be achieved using a combination of well-established technologies such as glazing, shading, insulation, and natural ventilation. More advanced passive cooling techniques such as roof pond, dynamic insulation, and evaporative water jacket need to be considered more closely. The building sector is a major consumer of both energy and materials worldwide, and that consumption is increasing. Most industrialised countries are in addition becoming more and more dependent on external supplies of conventional energy carriers, i. e., fossil fuels. Energy for heating and cooling can be replaced by new renewable energy sources. New renewable energy sources, however, are usually not economically feasible compared with the traditional carriers. In order to achieve the major changes needed to alleviate the environmental impacts of the building sector, it is necessary to change and develop both the processes in the industry itself, and to build a favourable framework to overcome the present economic, regulatory and institutional barriers. This article describes various designs of low-energy buildings. It also, outlines the effect of dense urban building nature on energy consumption, and its contribution to climate change.

40|$|AbstractThe {{development}} of adaptive building <b>envelope</b> <b>technologies,</b> and particularly of switchable glazing, can make {{significant contributions to}} decarbonisation targets. It is therefore essential to quantify their effect on building energy use and indoor environmental quality when integrated into buildings. The evaluation of their performance presents new challenges when compared to conventional “static” building envelope systems, as they require design and control aspects to be evaluated together, which are also mutually interrelated across thermal and visual physical domains. This paper addresses these challenges by presenting a novel simulation framework for the performance evaluation of responsive building <b>envelope</b> <b>technologies</b> and, particularly, of switchable glazing. This is achieved by integrating a building energy simulation tool and a lighting simulation one, in a control optimisation framework to simulate advanced control of adaptive building envelopes. The performance of a photovoltachromic glazing is evaluated according to building energy use, Useful Daylight Illuminance, glare risk and load profile matching indicators for a sun oriented office building in different temperate climates. The original architecture of photovoltachromic cell provides an automatic control of its transparency {{as a function of}} incoming solar irradiance. However, to fully explore the building integration potential of photovoltachromic technology, different control strategies are evaluated, from passive and simple rule based controls, to optimised rule based and predictive controls. The results show that the control strategy has {{a significant impact on the}} performance of the photovoltachromic switchable glazing, and of switchable glazing technologies in general. More specifically, simpler control strategies are generally unable to optimise contrasting requirements, while more advanced ones can increase energy saving potential without compromising visual comfort. In cooling dominated scenarios reactive control can be as effective as predictive for a switchable glazing, differently than heating dominated scenarios where predictive control strategies yield higher energy saving potential. Introducing glare as a control parameter can significantly decrease the energy efficiency of some control strategies, especially in heating dominated climates...|$|R

In this paper, the impact of light shelves over the illuminance levels in a south facing office building in Toronto is evaluated. The Useful Daylight Illuminance (UDI) is considered as the metric of analysis. Annual simulations for four different window-to-wall ratios (WWR) are compared with and without light shelves. Results show that light shelves enhance the UDI levels mainly in the first six meters in front of the windows, and provide a more homogeneous daylight distribution with an increase of the UDI for any considered WWR. Finally, this paper shows that WWR above 35 % result in increasing daylight quantity with higher glare issues, and in case of the adoption of floor to ceiling windows, WWR above 35 % are not advantageous in terms of daylighting...|$|R

Experimental results that are reported for both laboratory-scale and full-size building elements were tested in the field. Some PCM-enhanced building materials, such as PCM-gypsum boards, PCM-impregnated concretes, or PCM-enhanced fiber insulations have already found their limited applications in different countries. Today, continued improvements in building <b>envelope</b> <b>technologies</b> suggest that throughout southern and central U. S. climates, residences may soon be routinely construct ed with PCMs in order to maximize insulation effectiveness and maintain low heating and cooling loads. However, PCM applications, in order to be fully effective, need to be well engineered, taking into account optimum functional temperature for the PCM, its location, and its concentration. This paper presents a short overview of basic material characteristics and energy performance data necessary for future applications of simple PCM systems in residential and commercial buildings...|$|R

The {{purpose of this}} Cooperative Research and Development Agreement (CRADA) between UT-Battelle, LLC and John s Manville was to design a basic concept {{of a new generation}} of thermally-enhanced fiber glass insulation. Different types of Phase Change Materials (PCMs) have been tested as dynamic components in buildings during the last 4 decades. Most historical studies have found that PCMs enhance building energy performance. Some PCM-enhanced building materials, like PCM-gypsum boards or PCM-impregnated concretes have already found their limited applications in different countries. Today, continued improvements in building <b>envelope</b> <b>technologies</b> suggest that throughout Southern and Central U. S. climates, residences may soon be routinely constructed with PCM in order to maximize insulation effectiveness and maintain low heating and cooling loads. The proposed thermally-enhanced fiber glass insulation will maximize this integration by utilizing a highly-efficient building envelope with high-R thermal insulation, active thermal mass and superior air-tightness. Improved thermal resistance will come from modifications in infrared internal characteristics of the fiber glass insulation. Thermal mass effect can be provided by proprietary thermally-active microencapsulated phase change material (PCM). Work carried out at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) on the CRADA is described in this report...|$|R
