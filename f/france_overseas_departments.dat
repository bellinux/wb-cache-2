40|$|This {{article will}} begin to answer the question: {{what might happen if}} a decentred view of Francophone Cinema were to emerge? It will go beyond the {{definition}} of 'Francophone Cinema' as simply the 'Other' to metropolitan film production and examine the relationship between films set in <b>France's</b> <b>overseas</b> <b>departments</b> and territories and the concept of 'French national cinema'. To what extent, therefore, can so-called 'French national cinema' be 'francophonised', or made minoritarian, by this approach? A 'francophonising' cinema will highlight crossings and itineraries, and challenge claims to plenitude made by languages and cultures. The article will conclude with an analysis of André Téchiné's Loin (2001), an outstanding example of a film displaying these 'francophonising' processes...|$|R
50|$|Various {{groups in}} Gibraltar have campaigned {{in favour of}} a far closer {{relationship}} with Britain, {{in the form of}} devolved integration or incorporation into the Britain itself. This is similar to the offer made to Malta in 1955, under which Malta would be represented in the British House of Commons and be placed under the Home Office, while retaining internal self-government. This would be a similar status to <b>France's</b> <b>overseas</b> <b>departments</b> and to Spain's North African enclaves, Ceuta and Melilla, claimed by Morocco. One of Spain's arguments in rejecting comparisons between Gibraltar and these territories is that they are part of Spain, whereas Gibraltar is a British overseas territory and not part of the UK.|$|R

500|$|Napoleon did {{not succeed}} in {{defeating}} the Allied army as thoroughly as he wanted, but historians and enthusiasts alike recognize that the original plan provided a significant victory, comparable to other great tactical battles such as Cannae. Some historians suggest that Napoleon was so successful at Austerlitz that he lost touch with reality, and what used to be French foreign policy became a [...] "personal Napoleonic one" [...] after the battle. In French history, Austerlitz is acknowledged as an impressive military victory, and in the 19th century, when fascination with the First Empire was at its height, the battle was revered by the likes of Victor Hugo, who [...] "in the depth of [...] thoughts" [...] was hearing the [...] "noise of the heavy cannon rolling towards Austerlitz." [...] In the 2005 bicentennial, however, controversy erupted when neither French President Jacques Chirac nor Prime Minister Dominique de Villepin attended any functions commemorating the battle. On the other hand, some residents of <b>France's</b> <b>overseas</b> <b>departments</b> protested against what they viewed as the [...] "official commemoration of Napoleon," [...] arguing that Austerlitz should not be celebrated since they believed that Napoleon committed genocide against colonial people.|$|R
