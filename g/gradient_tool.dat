Design/methodology/approach: The materials were obtained by mixing the powders of the HS 6 - 5 - 2 high-speed steel, tungsten carbide (WC), and vanadium carbide (VC). The mixes were poured one by one into the die, yielding layers with the gradually changing volume ratio of carbides within the high-speed steel matrix. Structural research by using the scanning and transmission electron microscopes, x-ray microanalysis and density, hardness and porosity tests, were performed. Structure and hardness of selected materials after heat treatment were also investigated. Findings: On the basis {{of the results of the}} research, it was found that it was possible to obtain gradient materials by the powder metallurgy methods, in order to ensure the required properties and structure of the designed material. It was shown that the new sintered graded materials were characterized by a multiphase structure, consisting of ferrite, primary carbides of the high speed steel, of the MC and M 6 C type, and dependently of the reinforcement phase, of the tungsten carbide WC or the vanadium carbide VC, which were introduced into the material, in the form of powder. Additionally in the structure of the WC-reinforced materials the W 2 C phase occurs. The <b>gradient</b> <b>tool</b> materials reinforced with the WC carbide were characterized by a higher hardness, and a lower porosity in relation to the materials reinforced with the VC carbide. It was found that the desired structure and properties (density, porosity and hardness) had the material containing 25 % of the WC carbide in the surface layer, after sintering at the temperature 1210 oC, for 30 minutes. The heat treatment application causes a significant increase of the surface layer hardness of the material.

The {{methods of}} {{displaying}} data from archaeological surveys are of considerable importance in representing realistic impressions of archaeological sites {{that few people}} are able to visit. In many cases, further study of a site is not possible at the location of the site. This would require that the surveyed data of the site be displayed {{in such a way as}} to be accurate and realistic as well as including interactive tools, enabling further studies. Traditional displays of archaeological data have been either in textual form or in the conventional hardcopy form of maps and drawings. With the advent of computers and computer graphics alternative methods of displaying the data have become possible. 3 D graphics have become an important method of displaying archaeological data. In 1995 and 1996 the Department of Geomatics at the University of Cape Town participated in the survey of the 3. 6 million year old hominid footprints in Tanzania.

The chemical composition of the investigated materials’ core is corresponding to the M 2 high-speed steel and was reinforced with the WC and TiC type hard carbide phases with the growing portions of these phases in the outward direction from the core to the surface. Such composed material was sintered, heat treated and deposited appropriately with (Ti,Al) N or Ti(C,N) gradient coatings.

40|$|The {{traditional}} first-order {{analysis in}} Euclidean spaces {{relies on the}} Sobolev spaces W 1,p(Ω), where Ω ⊂ Rn is open and p ∈ [1, ∞]. The Sobolev norm is then defined as the sum of Lp norms of a function and its distributional gradient. We generalize the notion of Sobolev spaces in two different ways. First, the underlying function norm {{will be replaced by}} the “norm” of a quasi-Banach function lattice. Second, we will investigate functions defined on an abstract metric measure space and that is why the distributional gradients need to be substituted. The thesis consists of two papers. The first one builds up the elementary theory of Newtonian spaces based on quasi-Banach function lattices. These lattices are complete linear spaces of measurable functions with a topology given by a quasinorm satisfying the lattice property. Newtonian spaces are first-order Sobolev-type spaces on abstract metric measure spaces, where the role of weak derivatives is passed on to upper <b>gradients.</b> <b>Tools</b> such asmoduli of curve families and the Sobolev capacity are developed, which allows us to study basic properties of the Newtonian functions. We will see that Newtonian spaces can be equivalently defined using the notion of weak upper gradients, which increases the number of techniques available to study these spaces. The absolute continuity of Newtonian functions along curves and the completeness of Newtonian spaces in this general setting are also established. The second paper in the thesis then continues with investigation of properties of Newtonian spaces based on quasi-Banach function lattices. The set of all weak upper gradients of a Newtonian function is of particular interest. We will prove that minimalweak upper gradients exist in this general setting. Assuming that Lebesgue’s differentiation theoremholds for the underlyingmetricmeasure space,wewill find a family of representation formulae.

40|$|Controlling the {{interaction}} of cells with a material surface is of major interest {{in the field of}} biomedical material science. Plasma polymers are an attractive way to modify the surface chemistry of a material because this technique is versatile and can be applied {{to a wide range of}} different surfaces. The aim of the present work is to prepare a new chemical <b>gradient</b> <b>tool</b> using plasma polymerisation and assess its ability to provoke position dependent cell-surface interactions. A novel diffusion based approach is used to develop gradients from hydrophobic hexane (ppHex) to more hydrophilic allylamine (ppAAm) plasma polymers. The surface of the gradient and that of uniform control samples is characterised using WCA, XPS, ToF-SIMS and AFM. This data shows that the most distinct gradient was found in the wettability profile which can be controlled by changing the size of the opening through which diffusion of depositing species from the plasma occurs. The mechanism of the gradient formation is studied with channels of well defined cross sections. The deposition rate obtained on these samples shows a sharp drop off in the amount of ppHex deposited from the plasma starting 2 mm in advance of the opening. An estimation of the sheath dimensions indicates that this corresponds to the sheath thickness. It is suggested that plasma deposition through small openings such as pores depends on the relative dimensions of the sheath and the pore cross section. Inside the channels, oligomer formation is observed in the gas phase, presumably following a nucleophilic addition reaction mechanism. To study the stability of these plasma polymer surfaces in physiological conditions, surface analysis is also carried out on samples exposed to aqueous solutions. Some changes in the topography of the plasma polymer films are found. Most notably, uniform samples of ppHex deposited on top of ppAAm show the formation of blisters that are not observed on other samples. It is argued that these blisters are the result of water penetrating through the top ppHex layer and interacting with the more hydrophilic ppAAm or glass substrate. 3 T 3 fibroblasts cultured on the gradients show a gradual increase in cell density. This cell density gradient can be related linearly to the wettability gradient on the surface with non-linear relationships being observed with other surface parameters such as the ppHex thickness. The cell number on uniform ppAAm is much greater than on the ppAAm side of the gradient. Data from experiments with non-proliferating 3 T 3 fibroblasts indicates that the differences between the gradient and uniform ppAAm as well as the cell density increase along the gradient have their origin in a different number of cells adhered to the surface within the first 24 hours of cell culture. The adsorption of albumin and fibronectin on the plasma polymers demonstrate that displacement of the former by the latter takes place on the surface when adsorbed competitively. However, this displacement does not occur in different extents along the gradient surface, suggesting that protein displacement can not explain the increase in cell density towards the ppAAm end of the gradient.

40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose of}} the paper is to {{describe}} sintered <b>Tool</b> <b>Gradient</b> Materials manufactured by powder metallurgy process. The Powder Metallurgy method has been chosen to manufacture <b>tool</b> <b>gradient</b> materials with high disproportion of cobalt matrix portion between core and surface layer. Design/methodology/approach: Forming methods were developed during the investigations for tungsten carbide and cobalt, {{making it possible to}} obtain materials wits five layers in their structure. Findings: : High diversification of cobalt matrix portion in comparison to hard phases in subsequent layers of gradient materials leads to their deformation in as sintered state. In case of all gradient materials, mean hardness was equal about 1750 HV 1. Whereas, hardness of lower cobalt matrix rich layers is about 1548 HV 1 and increased up to 2154 HV 1 for lower layer of material rich with hard carbide phases. The porosity decreases along with the carbon content in these layers. Practical implications: Material presented in this paper is characterized by very high hardness of the surface and relative ductility of core. TGM with a smooth changes of the cobalt phase in the material. Originality/value: The obtained results show the possibility of manufacturing of TGM on basis of different portion of cobalt reinforced with hard ceramics particles carried out in order to improve the abrasion resistance and ductility of tool cutting materials...|$|R
40|$|Assigning a {{constant}} feedrate for a ball-nosed cutter {{in the manufacturing}} of sculptured surfaces cannot achieve an optimum material removal rate (MRR). This is because the actual cutting speed on the cutting edges of the cutter is varying due to the change of surface gradient. In addition, the cutting force cannot be maintained at {{a constant}} level when the cutting speed changed. In this study, a fuzzy based MRR optimization approach is proposed {{in order to increase}} the machining efficiency. An optimum feedrate for each cutting point in the machining of sculptured surfaces is calculated, and the cutting force is kept constant. The surface <b>gradient</b> and <b>tool</b> life are treated as the fuzzy input variables. A machining trail demonstrated that the MRR was increased by 41 % in comparison with the conventional constant feedrate cutting for the same surface. © 2003 Elsevier Science B. V.

40|$|Purpose: The {{mechanical}} alloying (MA) method has been chosen to manufacture <b>tool</b> <b>gradient</b> materials with high disproportion of cobalt matrix portion between core and surface layer. Design/methodology/approach: The following research {{studies have been}} carried out to elaborate a new group of sintered <b>tool</b> <b>gradient</b> materials, tungsten carbide with cobalt matrix, to elaborate their fabrication technology and to determine their structure and properties: a fabrication technology of mixtures and the formation technology of tungsten carbide gradient materials with cobalt matrix WC-Co was applied and elaborated; sintering conditions were selected experimentally, ensuring the best structure and properties; phase and chemical composition of the sintered gradient WC-Co materials was determined using EDX; the structure of sintered gradient WC-Co materials was investigated using scanning microscopy; mechanical and physical properties of sintered gradient WC-Co materials was determined: hardness, resistance to abrasive wear, resistance to brittle cracking. Findings: The presented research results confirm that the methods of mixing tungsten carbide in cobalt matrix an important effect upon the grain size of mixture. But {{it is not possible to}} determine the changes in grain size distribution. The larger particles break down rapidly that the product becomes more uniform.

40|$|Purpose: The goal of {{this work}} is to obtain the {{gradient}} materials based on the (W, Ti) C with high disproportion of cobalt matrix portion between core and surface layer. In this work is shown the structure and properties of <b>Tool</b> <b>Gradient</b> Materials (TGM). Design/methodology/approach: In presented study (W, Ti) C powder were mixed with cobalt powder. Prepared mixtures were heaped up, pressed at 300 MPa and sintered in vacuum furnace at temperatures 1450 °C. Produced gradient materials were studied by scanning electron microscope (SEM), light microscope. Hardness tests and density examination were also made. Findings: According to carried out researches it could be stated, that forming the gradient materials with highest portion of complex carbide (W,Ti) C 91 - 95 %, using uniaxial unilateral pressing, could be possible after adding into each layer of mixtures 2 % of paraffin lubricant. High diversification of cobalt matrix ratio in comparison with hard phases in subsequent layers of gradient materials leads to their deformation in as sintered state. In case of all gradient materials, mean hardness was equal about 1600 HV 1. Whereas, hardness of lower cobalt matrix rich layers has value about 1450 HV 1 which increases up to 1700 HV 1 for lower layer of material rich with hard carbide phases.

This framework uses at its core the approach developed in [14] which adopts the level set framework of [10] to construct a function that encodes visibility information in a continuous way.
