The debit entry will be recorded on the debit side (left-hand side) of a <b>General</b> <b>ledger</b> <b>account,</b> and the credit entry will be recorded on the credit side (right-hand side) of a <b>General</b> <b>ledger</b> <b>account.</b> If the total of the entries on the debit side of one account is greater than the total on the credit side of the same nominal account, that account is said to have a debit balance.|$|R

The latter (cost accounting) applies financial reporting conventions to inventory valuation, transfer pricing, and the cost of goods and services sold, and it serves the informational requirements of external parties, including investors, creditors, regulators, and tax authorities. Managerial costing is intended for internal use; it supports the decisions that managers make to optimize operations. The authors observe, [...] "The stock market clearly does not value a company for excellently prepared financial statements if operational excellence is lacking."

These efforts are essential to transforming DOD's business operations. GAO was asked to (1) provide the status of the ERPs as of December 31, 2009; (2) determine whether selected ERPs followed schedule and cost best practices; and (3) determine if DOD has defined the performance measures to assess whether the ERPs will meet their intended business capabilities.

50|$|In the General Journal, {{transactions}} are recorded in several lines (see Figure 1), and each transaction is posted to the <b>general</b> <b>ledger</b> separately.

In special journal, {{transactions are}} recorded in a single line, and the format of the journal made it possible to post only the total amount for each <b>account</b> to the <b>general</b> <b>ledger.</b> For example, if fifty sales on account were made during one day, only the total amount for Accounts Receivable, Sales, and Sales Tax Payable were posted to the <b>general</b> <b>ledger.</b> Thus the posting process is more efficient.

Therefore, the USSGL Board developed attributes containing various domain values that, when added to a basic 4 -digit USSGL account, provide the appropriate level of detail needed for central agency reporting and, in effect, create new USSGL accounts. See Section IV for attribute definitions and domain values. It is this lower level of detail, the basic 6 -digit USSGL account plus applicable attribute domain values, that agencies must capture at the transaction level to (1) comply with USSGL policy contained herein, and (2) achieve the desired result for proper reporting.
