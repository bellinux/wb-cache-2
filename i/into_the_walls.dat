5|$|The {{great auk}} was a food source for Neanderthals more than 100,000 years ago, as {{evidenced}} by well-cleaned bones found by their campfires.

5|$|By {{the turn}} of the century, the site of Fort Jackson had become the {{footings}} for a new railroad bridge, constructed in 1903. Three years later, a road bridge was constructed just to the west. A brickworks was also located nearby, sometimes utilizing the clay that formed the bastions of Fort Runyon as raw material for the bricks that would later go <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>walls</b> of Washington homes. These projects obliterated what little trace there was of Fort Jackson.|$|E
5|$|In 1849 the British {{seized control}} of Lahore from the Sikh Empire. During the British Raj, the mosque and the {{adjoining}} fort continued {{to be used as}} a military garrison. The 80 cells built <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>walls</b> surrounding the its vast courtyard were demolished by the British after the Freedom Fight of 1857, so as to prevent them from being used for anti-British activities. The cells were replaced by open arcades known as dalans.|$|E
5|$|In 1922, an {{important}} {{year of his}} life, Escher traveled through Italy, visiting Florence, San Gimignano, Volterra, Siena, and Ravello. In the same year he traveled through Spain, visiting Madrid, Toledo, and Granada. He {{was impressed by the}} Italian countryside, and in Granada by the Moorish architecture of the fourteenth-century Alhambra. The intricate decorative designs of the Alhambra, based on geometrical symmetries featuring interlocking repetitive patterns in the coloured tiles or sculpted <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>walls</b> and ceilings, triggered his interest in the mathematics of tessellation, and became a powerful influence on his work.|$|E

5|$|Modern historians {{consider}} that some biographical—or autobiographical—texts are important historical documents. For example, the biographical stelas of military generals in tomb chapels built under Thutmose III provide {{much of the}} information known about the wars in Syria and Palestine. However, the annals of Thutmose III, carved <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>walls</b> of several monuments built during his reign, such as those at Karnak, also preserve information about these campaigns. The annals of Ramesses II (r. 1279–1213 BC), recounting the Battle of Kadesh against the Hittites include, {{for the first time in}} Egyptian literature, a narrative epic poem, distinguished from all earlier poetry, which served to celebrate and instruct.|$|E
5|$|The Lapidary is {{an open-air}} museum of {{primarily}} stone artworks, both originals and copies, which formerly decorated buildings {{that no longer}} exist. Some are set <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>walls</b> around a 1969 terrace, while others are freestanding at various locations in the park. For example, in {{the walls of the}} terrace there are fragments of five carved heads from the keystones over windows, supposed to be from the Old City Hall of Berlin in Spandauer Straße and attributed to Georg Gottfried Weiyhenmeyer; two allegorical reliefs; 17th- and 18th-century building signs; a late Gothic vault keystone; and a 16th-century sandstone relief from the Stadtschloß.|$|E

5|$|During the 19th century {{some changes}} to Conwy's town walls {{were made in}} order to {{accommodate}} a new railway line and roads. The engineer Thomas Telford built two new gateways <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>walls</b> in 1826 to accommodate the traffic from the new suspension bridge across the river Conwy. In 1848 Robert Stephenson constructed the Chester to Holyhead railway line, which ran through Conwy; unusually for the period, attempts were made to sensitively protect the appearance of the medieval fortifications and the entrance for the railway through the walls {{on the south side of}} the town was built in the form of a mock-Gothic archway, while an exit tunnel was dug under the western walls.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} Anglo-Saxon period, the {{internal}} street layout of Canterbury was remodelled, but {{the line of}} the outer walls remained the same. A cattle market was created outside the city to the south-east, and Newingate, later renamed St George's Gate, was inserted <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>walls</b> to allow easy access to it. During this the period the main axis of the city shifted from the older line of streets running from London Gate and Riding Gate, to the new route between West Gate and Newingate. A lane was built running around the inside of the walls, in a similar way to the intramural streets built around the same time at Exeter and Winchester. Churches and chapels were built over the gates, including St Mary's above the North Gate; the Holy Cross over West Gate; St Michael's over Bargate; St Edmund's within Riding Gate; and, potentially, St George's Chapel over Newingate. Canterbury's walls were mentioned by the early chronicler, Bede, in his history of England.|$|E
5|$|There {{were three}} {{trenches}} {{in a typical}} front line sector; the fire trench, the support trench and the reserve trench, all joined by communication trenches. The trenches varied in depth, but they were usually {{about four or five}} feet deep, or in areas with a high water table a wall of sandbags would be built to allow the defenders to stand upright, fire trenches were provided with a fire step, so the occupants could return fire during an attack (see diagram). Ideally, the bottom of the trench was lined with duckboards to prevent men from sinking into the mud and dugouts were cut <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>walls,</b> these gave shelter from the elements and shrapnel, although in the British Army dugouts were usually reserved for the officers and senior NCOs. The men were then expected to sleep wherever they could and in wet weather they lived under groundsheets or in tents {{at the bottom of the}} trench on the duckboards.|$|E

5|$|On {{the north}} side of the bailey are the remains of the Norman chapel, which {{comprised}} a nave, a square tower and an apsidal chancel, 12.7 metres by 6 metres (42ft by 20ft), 4 metres square (13ft square) and 4.6 metres by 4 metres (15ft by 13ft) respectively. It was built from local grey sandstone, and Roman tiles from one of the nearby villas were used to construct its roof and incorporated <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>walls.</b> Originally the tower would have had a church bell, and the casting pit for this is buried under the floor of the nave. A stone bench runs around the base of the walls, and in the 19th century there was also a stone base for a font in the nave, but this has since been lost. A piece of early medieval graffiti, possibly depicting a Norman soldier, has survived on the south exterior wall. A fireplace was added to the chapel during the Tudor period, although this was only in use for a few years before being abandoned.|$|E
5|$|The bridge {{ceiling was}} redesigned, with Michelson taking {{structural}} inspiration from a jet engine fan. Minor built a central bubble for the ceiling {{to give the}} bridge a human touch. Ostensibly, the bubble functioned {{as a piece of}} sophisticated equipment designed to inform the captain of the ship's attitude. Most of the bridge consoles, designed by Lee Cole, remained from the scrapped television series. Cole remained on the motion picture production and was responsible for much of the visual artwork created. To inform actors and series writers, Lee prepared a USS Enterprise Flight Manual as a continuity guide to control functions. It was necessary for all the main cast to be familiar with control sequences at their stations as each panel was activated by touch via heat-sensitive plates. The wattage of the light bulbs beneath the plastic console buttons was reduced from 25watts to 6watts after the generated heat began melting the controls. The seats were covered in girdle material, used because of its stretching capacity and ability to be easily dyed. For the science station, two consoles were rigged for hydraulic operation so that they could be rolled <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>walls</b> when not in use, but the system was disconnected when the crew discovered {{it would be easier to}} move them by hand.|$|E
