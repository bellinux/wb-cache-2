40|$|In {{knowledge}} {{discovery in}} single sequences, different {{results could be}} discovered from the same sequence when different <b>frequency</b> <b>measures</b> are adopted. It is natural to raise such questions as (1) do these <b>frequency</b> <b>measures</b> reflect actual <b>frequencies</b> accurately? (2) what impacts do <b>frequency</b> <b>measures</b> have on discovered knowledge? (3) are discovered results accurate and reliable? and (4) which measures are appropriate for reflecting frequencies accurately? In this paper, taking three major factors (anti-monotonicity, maximum-frequency and window-width restriction) into account, we identify inaccuracies inherent in seven existing <b>frequency</b> <b>measures,</b> and investigate their impacts on the soundness and completeness of two kinds of knowledge, frequent episodes and episode rules, discovered from single sequences. In order to obtain more accurate frequencies and knowledge, we provide three recommendations for defining appropriate <b>frequency</b> <b>measures.</b> Following the recommendations, we introduce a more appropriate <b>frequency</b> <b>measure.</b> Empirical evaluation reveals the inaccuracies and verifies our findings.  ...|$|R

40|$|This study {{investigates the}} {{influence}} of frequency on the production of bimorphemic words, and considers which <b>frequency</b> <b>measure</b> is most apt to explain the differences. Previous studies have reported that frequent words are produced faster and more casually than infrequent ones, and that medial segments will have shorter durations. The present study examines the relation between frequency and the duration of medial segments in English derived words by conducting a production experiment with 6 native speakers of American English using 74 English '-ment' derivatives, and pits word frequency, base frequency, and relative frequency (wordfreq/basefreq) against one another as predictors. The results show that models incorporating {{any of the three}} <b>frequency</b> <b>measures</b> strongly predict medial segment duration (R-squared = 0. 56, with the differences in R-squared between them on the order of 1 %. Among the three <b>frequency</b> <b>measures,</b> whole word <b>frequency</b> explained the most variance, across all consonant types. The duration of segments in highly frequent words tends to be shorter than that in relatively infrequent words. Overall, this study confirms that speakers are sensitive to the extralinguistic information associated with the words such as frequency, and in this case, traditional <b>frequency</b> <b>measures</b> (whole word and base frequencies) are better predictors than relative frequency...|$|R

Thirteen participants exerted handgrip force related to maximum voluntary contraction (MVC) in four tests: 20 %MVC and 50 %MVC in neutral wrist posture and 20 %MVC in full wrist flexion and extension. EMG measurements from EDC and FCU were used to calculate normalized values of amplitude (nRMS) and mean and median frequency of the power spectrum (nMPF, nMF). During muscle shortening (wrist flexion for FCU and wrist extension for EDC) nRMS was approximately twofold higher than in neutral posture for FCU and fourfold for EDC. All measures obtained at 20 %MVC in neutral posture were significantly different from 20 %MVC in wrist flexion for FCU and 20 %MVC in wrist extension for EDC (p< 0. 05). Differences between 50 %MVC and 20 %MVC at neutral posture (nRMS) were significant for both muscles, although in nMPF and nMF for EDC only. Muscle shortening changed the pattern of statistical significance when the time and <b>frequency</b> domain <b>measures</b> were compared, whereas muscle lengthening did not. It can be concluded that muscle shortening caused by altering wrist posture influences {{the relationship between}} the time and <b>frequency</b> <b>measures</b> in both muscles.
