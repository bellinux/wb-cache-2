50|$|The longest {{palindromic}} {{word in the}} Oxford English Dictionary is the onomatopoeic tattarrattat, {{coined by}} James Joyce in Ulysses (1922) for {{a knock on the}} door. The Guinness Book of Records gives the title to detartrated, the preterite and past participle of <b>detartrate,</b> <b>a</b> chemical term meaning to remove tartrates. Rotavator, a trademarked name for an agricultural machine, is often listed in dictionaries. The term redivider is used by some writers, but appears to be an invented or derived term—only redivide and redivision appear in the Shorter Oxford Dictionary. Malayalam, an Indian language, is of equal length.|$|R

Bulge {{is a type}} of deformation containers experience when subject to compressive forces such as stacking or internal forces due to under- and over-packaging. Both compressive and internal forces can accelerate the failure of <b>a</b> <b>container</b> by causing panels to flex and flutes to buckle, compromising structural integrity.

50|$|The {{source of}} the heat for the self-heated can is an {{exothermic}} reaction that the user initiates by pressing {{on the bottom of}} the can. The can is manufactured as <b>a</b> triple-walled <b>container.</b> <b>A</b> <b>container</b> for the beverage surrounds <b>a</b> <b>container</b> of the heating agent separated from <b>a</b> <b>container</b> of water by a thin breakable membrane. When the user pushes {{on the bottom of the}} can, a rod pierces the membrane, allowing the water and heating agent to mix. The resulting reaction releases heat and thus warms the beverage surrounding it.|$|R

30|$|The main {{difference}} between <b>a</b> <b>container</b> and <b>a</b> VM {{is that the}} container shares it’s kernel with its host while a VM has its own. As a consequence, {{there is no need}} to trace <b>a</b> <b>container</b> since the kernel trace of the host will suffice. Furthermore, all the processes in containers are also processes of the host. Knowing if <b>a</b> <b>container</b> is currently running comes down to whether the current running process is from the said container or not.|$|R

50|$|In {{computer}} programming, an iterator is {{an object}} that enables a programmer to traverse <b>a</b> <b>container,</b> particularly lists. Various types of iterators are often provided via <b>a</b> <b>container's</b> interface. Though the interface and semantics of a given iterator are fixed, iterators are often implemented {{in terms of the}} structures underlying <b>a</b> <b>container</b> implementation and are often tightly coupled to the container to enable the operational semantics of the iterator. Note that an iterator performs traversal and also gives access to data elements in <b>a</b> <b>container,</b> but does not perform iteration (i.e., not without some significant liberty taken with that concept or with trivial use of the terminology). An iterator is behaviorally similar to a database cursor. Iterators date to the CLU programming language in 1974.|$|R

25|$|<b>A</b> full <b>container</b> load (FCL) is <b>an</b> ISO {{standard}} <b>container</b> that {{is loaded}} and unloaded under {{the risk and}} account of one shipper and only one consignee. In practice, {{it means that the}} whole container is intended for one consignee. FCL container shipment tends to have lower freight rates than an equivalent weight of cargo in bulk. FCL is intended to designate <b>a</b> <b>container</b> loaded to its allowable maximum weight or volume, but FCL in practice on ocean freight does not always mean a full payload or capacity - many companies will prefer to keep <b>a</b> 'mostly' full <b>container</b> as <b>a</b> single <b>container</b> load to simplify logistics and increase security compared to sharing <b>a</b> <b>container</b> with other goods.|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} a {{specific}} procedure for the structural assessment of <b>a</b> <b>container</b> stack is implemented to a realistic case {{in order to}} evaluate its effectiveness in the prediction of the operational limits of <b>a</b> <b>container</b> vessel. The feasibility of an extensive calculation based on such procedure is tested, paving {{the way to the}} direct analysis of <b>a</b> <b>container</b> stack subject to the inertial loads arising from the ship motions. The procedure is based on a 3 D non-linear FE analysis coupled with a direct simulation of non-linear ship motions for the determination of inertial forces acting on <b>a</b> <b>container</b> stack. <b>A</b> non-linear approach has been used for modelling both the ship motion response and the container stack structural response, leading to a global large amplitude analysis. A simplified model of <b>a</b> <b>container</b> stack has been defined in order to decrease the computational cost of the structural calculations, allowing for a use in the framework of an extensive analysis considering many different ship sailing conditions. As final results, diagrams showing the occurrence of failure of container structures or lashing equipment are presented...|$|R
