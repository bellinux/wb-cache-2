5|$|Adult {{pelicans}} rely on visual {{displays and}} behaviour to communicate, particularly using their wings and bills. Agonistic behaviour consists of thrusting and snapping at opponents with their bills, or lifting and waving their wings in a threatening manner. Adult pelicans <b>grunt</b> when at the colony, but are generally silent elsewhere or outside breeding season. Conversely, colonies are noisy as chicks vocalise extensively.|$|E
5|$|The species {{exhibits}} {{a variety of}} vocal behaviors. The cry of a pup is often {{compared to that of}} a seagull. Females coo when they are apparently content; males may <b>grunt</b> instead. Distressed or frightened adults may whistle, hiss, or in extreme circumstances, scream.|$|E
5|$|Although {{cartoonist}} Danny Antonucci {{began his}} career by working as an animator on various children's series for Hanna-Barbera, his later solo works were edgy and aimed at adult audiences. He gained notoriety with the 1987 short film Lupo the Butcher and then, after founding his own production studio, a.k.a. Cartoon in 1994, created the series The Brothers <b>Grunt</b> for MTV. It was quickly cancelled, however, upon being met with generally poor reviews.|$|E
50|$|The {{mangrove}} forests act as nurseries {{for many}} fish species. Adult blue striped <b>grunts,</b> French <b>grunts,</b> white <b>grunts,</b> gray snappers, French angelfish, gray angelfish, and seahorses {{may also be}} found among the mangroves. The seagrass beds have parrotfish, hogfish, and occasional turtles. Manatees are rare visitors. Shark Ray Alley has nurse sharks, rays, and occasionally other fish.|$|R
40|$|Previous {{research}} {{has suggested that}} the quiet, tonal <b>grunts</b> given by female savanna baboons (Papio cynocephalusursinus) function to mollify lower-rankingfemales and thereby facilitate friendly social interaction with them (Cheney et al., 1995). In a two-year study of wild chacma baboons, we assessed whether or not <b>grunts</b> given by adult males function similarly to facilitate heterosexual interaction. Two patterns of male vocal behavior initially suggested this function. First, males <b>grunted</b> more often when approaching females with which social interaction was potentially highly bene cial and/or unlikely (due to female evasion), i. e. estrus females and lactating females (particularly friend females); males rarely <b>grunted</b> whe...|$|R
50|$|The pigfish (Orthopristis chrysoptera) is {{a member}} of the Haemulidae family, members of which are {{commonly}} called <b>grunts.</b> This name derives from the <b>grunting</b> or chattering noise these fish make by rubbing their pharyngeal teeth together.|$|R
5|$|Although {{generally}} {{quiet and}} non-vocal, giraffes {{have been heard}} to communicate using various sounds. During courtship, males emit loud coughs. Females call their young by bellowing. Calves will emit snorts, bleats, mooing and mewing sounds. Giraffes also snore, hiss, moan, <b>grunt</b> and make flute-like sounds, and possibly communicate over long distances using infrasound—though this is disputed. During nighttime, giraffes appear to hum to each other above the infrasound range for purposes which are unclear.|$|E
5|$|Danny Antonucci, a {{cartoonist}} {{known for}} his edgy adult work such as Lupo the Butcher and The Brothers <b>Grunt,</b> was dared by someone to prouduce a children's cartoon. In 1996, Antonucci pitched Ed, Edd n Eddy, which he conceived while designing a commercial, to Cartoon Network and Nickelodeon. After Cartoon Network agreed to give Antonucci creative control over the show, the series went into production and premiered its first season on January 4, 1999.|$|E
5|$|In {{the first}} issue, it is {{revealed}} that the team’s official moniker is Special Counter-Terrorist Unit Delta. G.I. Joe featured an ensemble cast, with the original thirteen characters being Hawk, Stalker, Breaker, Clutch, Scarlett, Snake Eyes, Rock ‘n Roll, Steeler, Grand Slam, Flash, Short-Fuze, <b>Grunt</b> and Zap. This reflected their origins in the Hasbro toy line, with the initial characters being {{the same as the}} action figures in the original 1982 release of the toy line. The team roster expanded as additional action figures were released.|$|E

They have methane suits {{that allow them to}} remove the breathing apparatuses they usually wear to sustain them in a non-methane atmosphere. In Halo Reach, if a player kills a <b>Grunt</b> in a particular way, their methane tank will ignite causing them to fly and bounce around the area out of control, causing damage if they hit the player.|$|E
5|$|Each squad {{member in}} Mass Effect 2 had music {{composed}} for them, intended to convey their character; BioWare gave the composers detailed character studies for each to help. Tali's theme {{was created by}} Jimmy Hinson, who had generally made game remixes beforehand. Hinson worked {{from his home in}} Tennessee and made his pieces using FL Studio 9. Although they were given full access to the game's content, Hinson chose to avoid looking beyond what he absolutely needed to look at to write the tracks, due to wanting to experience the game fresh upon its release. In addition to Tali, Hinson also wrote tracks for Samara and <b>Grunt,</b> as well as various other tracks in the game.|$|E
5|$|Halo: Combat Evolved Anniversary was {{announced}} to the public with a trailer on June 6, 2011, at Microsoft's annual E3 global media briefing, which closed with the teaser trailer for Halo 4. Bonuses for preordering the game included a Master Chief Xbox 360 avatar costume and an exclusive <b>Grunt</b> Funeral skull, which toggles whether enemy Grunts explode upon death. During the Halo Universe panel at the 2011 San Diego Comic-Con, a short trailer showcasing the animation used in the terminals with a narration by 343 Guilty Spark was shown to the fans. Microsoft launched the Halo Living Monument, consisting of a live-action short and a website, to celebrate the launch of Combat Evolved Anniversary.|$|E

In our conversation data, these <b>grunts</b> occur an average of once every 5 seconds in Amer- ican English conversation. In a sample of 79 conversations from a larger corpus, Switchboard, urn was the 6 th most frequent item (after /, and, the, you, and a), and the four items uh, uh-huh, urn and urn-hum accounted for 4 % of the total. These sounds are not only frequent, they are important in language use. To mention just one example, people learning English {{as a second language}} are handicapped in informal interactions if they cannot produce and recognize these sounds...|$|R

5|$|As an {{animator}} {{of various}} Hanna-Barbera children's cartoons, Canadian cartoonist Danny Antonucci was bothered {{by people who}} thought that animation was only for children, prompting him to produce edgy adult works such as Lupo the Butcher and The Brothers <b>Grunt.</b> Antonucci was later dared to produce a children's cartoon and accepted the challenge. Antonucci drew the Eds while designing a commercial. Impressed, he spent months designing the show and then faxed a one-page concept sheet to Cartoon Network (CN) and Nickelodeon in 1996. Both responded quickly with high interest, but demanded creative control, to which Antonucci refused. After CN agreed to let Antonucci have creative control, a deal was made that his studio, a.k.a. Cartoon, would produce the series. The show entered production in 1997, making it Cartoon Network's first original series to be produced by an outside production company rather than Hanna-Barbera, {{as well as the}} first to by-pass a seven-minute short.|$|E
5|$|Shepard {{is brought}} to meet the Illusive Man, who reveals that entire populations of human colonies have been disappearing all over the galaxy. Now working for Cerberus, Shepard is sent to {{investigate}} a recently attacked colony, where he/she finds clues about the Reapers working by proxy through an insectoid species called the Collectors. The Illusive Man explains that the Collectors reside beyond the Omega-4 Relay, a place from which no ship has ever returned. Shepard is given command of a new starship, the Normandy SR-2, piloted once again by Joker and equipped with an onboard AI named EDI, and begins to assemble a team to stop the Collectors. Shepard recruits Mordin Solus, former squad member Garrus Vakarian, Jack, and (optionally) <b>Grunt,</b> before receiving intel from the Illusive Man that another human colony is under attack. With the help of Mordin's studies on Collector biology, Shepard successfully defends the colony, but is unable to stop {{a large portion of}} the population from being captured.|$|E
5|$|Vocalisations are {{frequent}} as the juveniles disperse, {{and again as}} they congregate in the morning. Nearby adults, presumably the parents, also give signals warning of predators or alerting the youngsters {{to the presence of}} food. The range and quantity of vocalisations vary between species. Alligators are the noisiest, while some crocodile species are almost completely silent. Adult female New Guinea crocodiles and Siamese crocodiles roar when approached by another adult, while Nile crocodiles <b>grunt</b> or bellow in a similar situation. The American alligator is exceptionally noisy; it emits a series of about seven throaty bellows, each a couple of seconds long, at ten second intervals. It also makes various grunts and hisses. Males create vibrations in the water to send out infrasonic signals that serve to attract females and intimidate rivals. The enlarged boss of the male gharial may serve as a sound resonator.|$|E
40|$|Juvenile {{french and}} white <b>grunts</b> (Haemulorlflavolineatum and Haemulonplumieri) form diurnal resting schools over colonies of Porites furcata and Acropora palmata in St. Croix. We studied {{the effect of}} these <b>grunts</b> on the tissue {{composition}} and growth rate of corals. Porites furcata colonies with <b>grunts</b> had significantly more tissue cm- *, N cm- * and zooxanthellae cm- * than colonies without <b>grunts.</b> Acropora palm&a colonies with <b>grunts</b> also showed elevated amounts of N cm- 2 and P cm+. Seasonal changes were also observed in these parameters and in coral growth rates and skeletal density, apparently related to light availability. Several measures of coral growth rate were significantly greater in P. furcata colonies with <b>grunts.</b> <b>Grunts</b> were removed from two colonies, and growth rates before and after removal were compared to rates in reference colonies. Before removal most growth rate measures were greater in the colonies with grunts; after removal growth rates were lower or not significantly different. These data demonstrate that schools of resident fishes can stimulate coral growth, perhaps by providing nitrogen supplements. Abundant migrating vertebrates can be effective transporters of nutrients and organic matter in terrestrial (Hutchinson 1950), wetland (McCall and Burger 1976; Onuf et al. 1977), freshwater (Richey et al. 1975; Durbin et al. 1979), and marine ecosystems (Ganning and Wulff 1969; Bray et al. 198 1). Similarly, fishes that migrate between feeding areas away from coral reefs and resting areas on the reef provide a nitrogen and phosphorus supplement to coral...|$|R

5|$|The other {{significant}} theory {{about the origin}} of the legend, proposed by Robert Chambers in 1864, is that a genuine child was born in the early 17th century with facial deformities resembling a pig's face and a speech impediment causing her to <b>grunt.</b> The science of teratology (the study of birth defects and physiological abnormalities) was then in its infancy, and the theory of maternal impression (that the thoughts of a pregnant woman could influence the future appearance of her children) was widely accepted. It is possible that the birth of a genuinely deformed child led to the story of the beggar as a possible explanation for her appearance, with other elements of the story being later additions or distortions by publishers. Chambers speculates that the original child may have had a similar appearance to Julia Pastrana, a woman with hypertrichosis and distorted (although not pig-like) facial features, who was widely exhibited in Europe and North America until her death in 1860, and then, embalmed, until the 1970s. However, while a 1952 stillbirth with a face resembling a pig is documented, {{there has never been a}} reliably documented case of a human with deformities of this kind surviving outside the womb, while all versions of the pig-faced woman legend describe her as a healthy adult.|$|E
