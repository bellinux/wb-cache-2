40|$|The Van Nes rotationplasty is {{a useful}} limb-preserving {{procedure}} for skeletally immature patients with distal femoral or proximal tibial malignancy. The vascular supply to the lower limb either must be maintained and rotated or transected and reanastomosed. We asked whether there would be any difference in the ankle brachial index or complication rate for the two methods of vascular management. Vessels were resected with the tumor in seven patients and preserved and rotated in nine patients. One amputation occurred in the group in which the vessels were preserved. Four patients died secondary to metastatic disease diagnosed preoperatively. The most recent ankle brachial indices were 0. 96 and 0. 82 for the posterior tibial and <b>dorsalis</b> <b>pedis</b> <b>arteries,</b> respectively, in the reconstructed group.

40|$|AbstractObjectives: to {{investigate}} the relationship between calf vessel run-off assessed by hand-held Doppler, graft patency and patient survival following infra-inguinal graft surgery. Design: prospective cohort study of 258 consecutive patients undergoing infra-inguinal bypass grafts in one centre between 1995 – 99. Materials and methods: ankle Doppler auditory waveform characteristics were documented for patients considered for infra-inguinal bypass grafting. Doppler signals from the anterior tibial, posterior tibial and <b>dorsalis</b> <b>pedis</b> <b>arteries</b> were scored triphasic/biphasic (2), monophasic (1) or absent (0). A total Doppler run off score (0 – 6) was calculated. Following surgery graft surveillance was undertaken using duplex ultrasound at 6, 12, 26 and 52 weeks. Graft and patient survival were analysed using Cox regression analysis. Results: overall primary assisted graft patency at one year was 80 %. With an increasing Doppler score from 0 to 6, primary assisted graft patency steadily rose from 50 % to 100 % (p = 0. 0002), accompanied by a steady fall in patient mortality from 50 % to 5 % (p = 0. 0003) ...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: We {{report an}} {{interesting}} case of atypical Tolosa Hunt syndrome with bilateral Sclerokeratitis and optic atrophy {{in a patient}} with Takayasu's arteritis. Observations: A 31 -year- old lady presented with severe retroorbital pain in the right eye and right sided headache of 2 weeks duration. She {{had a history of}} 6 th and 7 th nerve palsies which improved with oral corticosteroids. Her BCVA was no perception of light in OD and 6 / 6 in OS. Slitlamp examination showed bilateral old sclerokeratitis and fundus examination showed bilateral optic atrophy. Systemic examination revealed BP of 240 / 100 mm of hg in the right upper limb with absent pulsations in the left radial, bilateral femoral and <b>dorsalis</b> <b>pedis</b> <b>arteries</b> noted. CT aortic angiography confirmed the diagnosis of Takayasu's arteritis. Symptoms improved with oral corticosteroids and azathioprine, which was followed by a renal stenting procedure. At 1 year followup, she is doing well with no recurrences. Conclusions and importance: This case report presents a unique manifestation of atypical Tolosa Hunt syndrome in Takayasu's arteritis.

40|$|Purpose: To {{report the}} {{clinical}} outcome of stent-assisted below-the-ankle angioplasty for limb salvage {{in the setting}} of critical limb ischemia (CLI). Methods: A retrospective single-center study was conducted of 40 critical ischemic limbs in 31 patients (mean age 6768 years, range 46 – 94) undergoing below-the-ankle stent-assisted angioplasty between April 2006 and April 2009. Coronary bare metal stents were implanted in cases of failed balloon angioplasty due to significant recoil, flow-limiting dissection, abrupt closure, or repeat early reocclusion. Results: Technical success was 93 % (37 limbs), with 3 failures to cross the occlusive lesions. Acute or subacute occlusion was evident in 9 (23 %) limbs. The number of runoff vessels increased significantly (p, 0. 001) from 0. 660. 8 to 1. 860. 8. During a clinical follow-up of 19. 3611. 4 months (range 1 – 48), the number of repeat interventions for limb salvage was 2. 261. 6 (range 1 – 9), and a total of 1. 660. 9 stents (range 1 – 3) were implanted in 8 <b>dorsalis</b> <b>pedis</b> <b>arteries.</b> Acute or subacute stent thrombosis after stenting was observed in 2 of these, and symptomatic in-stent restenosis was detected in 4, which were all treated by repeat intervention.

40|$|AbstractObjectiveThe study aims {{to assess}} a novel thermosensitive polymer (LeGoo®) for distal vessel control during infra-popliteal (crural/pedal) bypass surgery in severe leg ischaemia. MethodRetrospective {{analysis}} of all distal bypasses from October 2009 to February 2012. Technical success, patency, limb salvage and amputation-free survival rates were analysed. ResultsFifty-four infra-popliteal bypasses using the polymer were performed in 46 patients. The distal anastomosis {{was at the}} anterior tibial (n =  15, 28 %), posterior tibial (n =  12, 22 %), peroneal (n =  8, 15 %), tibio-peroneal trunk (n =  8, 15 %) and <b>dorsalis</b> <b>pedis</b> <b>arteries</b> (n =  11, 20 %). Technical success was achieved in 51 / 54 (94. 4 %; failures: two inadequate haemostasis, one un-dissolved polymer). In-hospital duplex of the distal anastomosis showed a significant stenosis in two cases (4. 3 %). Outflow angioplasty was performed in three cases (two distal anastomotic, one run-off vessel, 5. 6 %). The 1 -year patency rate was 76. 2 % (standard error (SE) 6. 7 %), limb salvage rate 79. 3 % (SE 6. 7 %). Amputation-free survival was 93. 5 % at 30 days (SE 3. 6 %) and 67. 5 % at 1 year (SE 7. 5 %). ConclusionThis thermosensitive polymer is a potentially safe and useful atraumatic device to achieve a blood-less distal anastomotic field in infra-popliteal bypasses. The technique avoids other potentially traumatic methods of vessel control, which may be particularly important in patients with calcified distal vessels...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: To {{investigate}} whether multispectral optoacoustic tomography (MSOT) developed for deep-tissue imaging in humans could enable the clinical assessment of major {{blood vessels and}} microvasculature. Materials and Methods: The study {{was approved by the}} Institutional Review Board of the University Medical Center Groningen (CCMO-NL- 43587) and registered in the Dutch National Trial Registry (NTR 4125). The authors designed a real-time handheld optoacoustic scanner for human use, based on a concave 8 -MHz transducer array, attaining 135 degrees angular coverage. They applied a single-pulse-frame (SPF) sequence, which enabled motion insensitive optoacoustic imaging during handheld operation. SPF optoacoustic imaging was applied to imaging arteries and microvascular landmarks in the lower extremities of 10 healthy volunteers. The diameters selected microvessels were determined by measuring the full width at half maximum through the vessels in the MSOT images. Duplex ultrasonography was performed on the same landmarks in seven of the 10 volunteers for subjective comparison to the corresponding optoacoustic images. Results: Optoacoustic imaging resolved blood vessels as small as 100 mu m in diameter and within 1 cm depth. Additionally, MSOT provided images reflecting hemoglobin oxygen saturation in blood vessels, clearly identifying arteries and veins, and was able to identify pulsation in arteries during imaging. Larger blood vessels, specifically the tibialis posterior and the <b>dorsalis</b> <b>pedis</b> <b>arteries,</b> were also visualized with MSOT. Conclusion: Handheld MSOT was found to be capable of clinical vascular imaging, providing visualization of major blood vessels and microvasculature and providing images of hemoglobin oxygen saturation and pulsation.

40|$|Indicator {{dilution}} curves {{obtained from}} various systemic arterial sampling sites {{are commonly used}} for analysis of blood flow, cardiac shunts and valvular regurgitation, and for study of segments of the blood volume. It is generally assumed that the contour of such curves is largely determined by the passage and dilution of the indicator in the central circulation and that changes occurring during arterial passage are minor and predictable {{on the basis of}} the expected velocity of arterial blood flow and the distances of the commonly used sampling sites from the aortic root. Although it is accepted that quantification of blood flow is unaffected by changes in curve contour so long as the first circulation of indicator can be identified, the estimation of other parameters available from curve analysis may be significantly influenced by the validity of the above assumption. Beard, Wood and Clagett (1) and Fox, Sutterer and Wood (2) have demonstrated considerable differences in contour as well as appearance time of curves obtained from the femoral (FA), radial (RA) and <b>dorsalis</b> <b>pedis</b> <b>arteries.</b> The first study showed delay in the FA components in coarctation of the aorta as compared with the RA curve, whereas the latter study noted delay and skewing of the RA or pedal curve as compared with the FA curve. The FA curves were similar in contour to the abdominal aortic curves in normal subjects. During preliminary studies of an investigation which attempted to quantitate valvular regurgitation by comparison of indicator dilution curves recorded simultaneously from the pulmonary artery (PA) and a systemic artery, we noted that in normal subjects only FA curves consistently resembled the PA curve while those recorded from th...|$|R
40|$|ObjectiveThis study {{aimed to}} {{ascertain}} differences in benefit {{and effectiveness of}} popliteal versus tibial retrograde access in subintimal arterial flossing with the antegrade–retrograde intervention (SAFARI) technique. MethodsThis was a retrospective study of SAFARI-assisted stenting for long chronic total occlusion (CTO) of TASC C and D superficial femoral lesions. 38 cases had superficial femoral artery lesions (23 TASC C and 15 TASC D). All 38 cases underwent SAFARI-assisted stenting. The ipsilateral popliteal artery was retrogradely punctured in 17 patients. A distal posterior tibial (PT) or <b>dorsalis</b> <b>pedis</b> (DP) <b>artery</b> was retrogradely punctured in 21 patients, and 16 of them were punctured after open surgical exposure. ResultsSAFARI technical success was achieved in all cases. There {{was no significant difference}} in 1 -year primary patency (75 % vs. 78. 9 %, p = . 86), secondary patency (81. 2 % vs. 84. 2 %, p = . 91) and access complications (p =  1. 00) between popliteal and tibial retrograde access. There was statistical difference in operation time between popliteal (140. 1  ±  28. 4  min) and tibial retrograde access with PT/DP punctures after surgical vessel exposure (120. 4  ±  23. 0  min, p = . 04). ConclusionThe SAFARI technique is a safe and feasible option for patients with infrainguinal CTO (TASC II C and D).

Current guidelines recommend screening for PAD in primary care setting using ankle brachial index (ABI) in all patients with cardiovascular risks. This is, however, not performed strictly because the standard Doppler method is cumbersome and time-consuming. Here, we evaluate the accuracy and reproducibility of ABI measurements obtained by an improved automated oscillometric device, the MESI ABPI MD® device, and the standard Doppler method. ABI was measured in random order in a general practice with Doppler probes by two operators separately (ABI_dop) and twice with the MESI ABPI MD device (ABI_mesi). ABI_dop was calculated dividing the highest systolic blood pressure from both tibial and <b>dorsalis</b> <b>pedis</b> <b>arteries</b> by the highest systolic blood pressure of both brachial arteries. ABI_mesi was obtained automatically with simultaneous measurements on three extremities. According to ABI_dop, PAD was present in 10 % of the 136 screened subjects (68. 2 ± 7. 4 years). Interoperator coefficient of variation was 5. 5 % for ABI_dop, while the intrasubject coefficient of variation for ABI_mesi was 3. 0 %. ABI_mesi was correlated with ABI_dop (R= 0. 61, P< 0. 0001). The {{difference between the two}} techniques was 0. 06 ± 0. 14 with ABI_mesi providing slightly higher values (P< 0. 0001) and negligible bias across the range (R= 0. 19, P< 0. 0001). Therefore, ABI_mesi ≤ 1 had a sensitivity of 85 % and specificity of 96 % to detect ABI_dop ≤ 0. 9 and hence PAD. Doppler measurements took seven times longer than MESI ABPI MD measurements to be performed. In conclusion, MESI improved automated oscillometric method and offered a faster and repeatable measurement of ABI with only a small, clinically irrelevant overestimation of ABI value. The tested MESI ABPI MD-improved oscillometric system {{can be used as a}} screening tool for patients in general practice and would enable family doctors to comply with current guidelines for PAD.

40|$|Abstract O 162 Introduction: Indigenous Australians {{have high}} rates of {{premature}} cardiovascular disease and high prevalence of periodontitis, an inflammatory disease of the tissues surrounding teeth. Periodontitis {{has been associated with}} arterial stiffening and incident cardiovascular events and. periodontal bacteria have been isolated from atheromatous plaques. If periodontitis contributes causally to cardiovascular disease, periodontal treatment may confer important benefits to the health of Indigenous Australians. Objectives: To determine if a single episode of periodontal treatment improved arterial stiffness in otherwise healthy Indigenous Australian adults. Methods: Participants were 273 Indigenous Australian adults (57 % male; age 40. 3 years [SD 10. 2]) with moderate or severe periodontal disease in the Northern Territory, Australia. Participants were randomized into intervention (n¼ 138) or control (n¼ 135) groups. The intervention involved removal of sub- and supra-gingival calculus and plaque biofilm by scaling and root-planing once, at randomization. Pulse wave velocity (PWV) was assessed by applanation tonometry (SphygmoCor- PVMx device, AtCor Medical, Sydney, Australia) between the carotid and <b>dorsalis</b> <b>pedis</b> <b>arteries,</b> at baseline and again 3 -months (n¼ 169) and 12 -months (n¼ 171) post randomization. Comparison of randomized groups was by complete case analysis using ANCOVA adjusted for baseline measures. Results: At baseline, the average carotid-dorsalis pedis PWV was 8. 34 m/s (SD 1. 25). The mean reduction in periodontal pocketing from enrollment to 3 -months was 0. 14 mm greater [95 % CI 0. 24 to 0. 05] in the intervention group compared to control, P¼ 0. 004). This was less marked at 12 -months, mean reduction in periodontal pocketing 0. 09 mm greater [95 % CI - 0. 01 to 0. 18] in the intervention versus control, P¼ 0. 08). In contrast, the intervention did not affect PWV at 3 -months [the primary endpoint] (between-group difference in means + 0. 06 m/s [95 % CI - 0. 17 to 0. 29] intervention vs. control, P ¼ 0. 59), although there was some evidence that the intervention increased PWV at 12 -months, this was not statistically significant (between-group difference in means + 0. 21 m/s [95 % CI - 0. 01 to 0. 43] intervention vs. control, P¼ 0. 06). Conclusion: A single episode periodontal intervention in Indigenous Australians with periodontal disease provides short-term improvement in periodontal health, but did not significantly influence arterial stiffness as measured by pulse wave velocity.

40|$|ObjectivesLower {{extremity}} embolization {{occurs during}} aortoiliac aneurysm repair and may require major amputation when distal arteries are occluded. Because nonoperative treatments are often ineffective, we evaluated an aggressive operative approach. MethodsIn the past 11 years, we performed 328 endovascular and 350 open aortoiliac aneurysm repairs. Excluding cases of embolization to iliac, femoral, popliteal, and more proximal tibial vessels, which were {{treated in a}} standard fashion, foot ischemia severe enough to produce cadaveric, pregangrenous, or gangrenous skin changes occurred from more distal embolization after seven endovascular and three open aortoiliac aneurysm repairs. Six of these 10 patients underwent thromboembolectomies of both their <b>dorsalis</b> <b>pedis</b> and perimalleolar posterior tibial arteries ≤ 4 hours of their original operation. In the other four patients, treatment was delayed 7 to 10 days. Because of progressive foot ischemia, arteriography was performed. From these results, four bypasses (3 autologous vein, 1 polytetrafluoroethylene graft) were performed to the transverse metatarsal arch, <b>dorsalis</b> <b>pedis,</b> perimalleolar peroneal <b>artery,</b> or perimalleolar anterior tibial artery. ResultsPatency and limb-salvage rates for both thromboembolectomy and bypass procedures were 100 % at a mean follow-up of 3. 0 years (range, 5 months- 8 years). ConclusionsPerimalleolar and foot artery thromboembolectomy and bypasses to arteries as distal as the metatarsal arch can be effective treatment for distal embolization from aortoiliac aneurysm repair. Even when cadaveric, pregangrenous, or gangrenous lesions are present, distal arteriography and operative treatment (thromboembolectomy or bypass) may be indicated to successfully salvage the foot...|$|R

50|$|In medicine, a pulse {{represents}} the tactile arterial palpation of the heartbeat by trained fingertips.

The heart rate can also be measured by listening to the heart beat directly (auscultation), traditionally using a stethoscope and counting it for a minute. The radial pulse is commonly measured using three fingers. This has a reason: the finger closest to the heart is used to occlude the pulse pressure, the middle finger is used get a crude estimate of the blood pressure, and the finger most distal to the heart (usually the ring finger) is used to nullify the effect of the ulnar pulse as the two arteries are connected via the palmar arches (superficial and deep). The study of the pulse is known as sphygmology.|$|E
