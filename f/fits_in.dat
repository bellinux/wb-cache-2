5|$|Starting in the 2000s, {{loitering}} {{weapons have}} been developed for additional roles beyond the initial SEAD role ranging from relatively long-range strikes and fire support down to tactical, very short-range battlefield use such as the AeroVironment Switchblade which is deployed at the platoon level and <b>fits</b> <b>in</b> a backpack. A documented use of loitering munitions was in 2016 Nagorno-Karabakh clashes in which an IAI Harop was used against a bus functioning as a troop transport.|$|E

5|$|In the 1990s, astronomers began finding {{other objects}} {{at least as}} far away as Pluto, now known as Kuiper Belt objects, or KBOs. Many of these shared some of Pluto's key orbital {{characteristics}} and are now called plutinos. Pluto came to be seen as the largest member of a new class of objects, and some astronomers stopped referring to Pluto as a planet. Pluto's eccentric and inclined orbit, while very unusual for a planet in the Solar System, <b>fits</b> <b>in</b> well with the other KBOs. New York City's newly renovated Hayden Planetarium did not include Pluto in its exhibit of the planets when it reopened as the Rose Center for Earth and Space in 2000.|$|E

25|$|Variable-length {{representations}} of integers, such as bignums, can store any integer that <b>fits</b> <b>in</b> the computer's memory.

25|$|If {{efficiency}} {{is not a}} concern, computing factorials is trivial from an algorithmic point of view: successively multiplying a variable initialized to 1 by the integers up to n (if any) will compute n!, provided the result <b>fits</b> <b>in</b> the variable.
