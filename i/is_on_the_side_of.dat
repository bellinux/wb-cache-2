Some of these include the “Evolution of the Totonac Culture” mural on the side of the main church, the “History of Papantla” mural which <b>is</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> the Chapel of Cristo Rey and the Monumento del Volador, a giant statue which is on a hill in the center of the city.|$|E
25|$|The {{municipality}} {{is located}} between Ixtlahuaca and Atlacomulco, fifty four kilometers {{north of the}} state capital of Toluca. This area is in the northwest of the state, in the Ixtlahuaca Valley, which is formed by small mountain chains that belong to the Sierra Madre Occidental, with some formations {{as a result of}} being on the Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt. Elevation varies from 2,530 masl next to the Lerma River on the far south to 2,900, {{on one side of the}} Jocotitlán volcano, with an average of 2,770. However, much of the land in the area is relatively flat and covers much of the Ixtlahuaca Valley.

The Maich Water forms the Local Authority boundary here and harbours a geocache upon its course before it empties into Kilbirnie Loch. The Smuggler's Cave <b>is</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> the Maich Water, formerly reached through an entrance guarded by sandstone pillars off the driveway.

The New Zealand Memorial to the New Zealand Division on the Somme is found on the former site of the Switch Line, on a lane off the D 197 running north of Longueval (GPS co-ordinates 50.039501 2.801512) and the New Zealand Division {{memorial}} to the Missing in France is near the Commonwealth War Graves Commission Caterpillar Valley Cemetery, just east of Longueval. The 41st Division erected a memorial in Flers, commemorating the capture of the village; topped with a bronze battle dressed soldier, the statue is well known as the photograph on the battlefield tour guide Before Endeavours Fade (Rose Coombs). The statue by Albert Toft is the same figure used at the Royal London Fusiliers Monument in London and Oldham War Memorial.

25|$|While amate {{is made in}} a {{few small}} villages in {{northern}} Puebla, northern Veracruz and southern Hidalgo state, only San Pablito in Puebla manufactures the paper commercially. San Pablito is a village in the municipality of Pahuatlán located in the Sierra Norte de Puebla. Tulancingo, Hidalgo is the closest urban center. The area is very mountainous and the village itself <b>is</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> a mountain called the Cerro del Brujo. The making of {{the paper is the}} primary economic activity of the community and has alleviated poverty in the village. Before the villagers only had very small houses made of wood, but now they have much larger houses made of block. The paper makers here guard the process greatly and will sever contact with anyone seeking to replicate their work. In addition to providing income to the paper makers themselves the craft has been employing an increasing number of people to harvest bark, over an area which now extends over 1,500km2 in the Sierra Norte de Puebla region. The village manufactures large quantities of paper, still using mostly pre-Hispanic technology and various tree species for raw material. About half of this paper production is still sold to Nahua painters in Guerrero.|$|E

25|$|Overall, {{there is}} a {{significant}} lack of cultural institutions such as theaters, auditoriums and museums. However a number of institutions do exist. The Tlahuac Regional Museum is located in San Pedro Tláhuac. It is housed in the former civil registry office and was the first museum established in the borough. The Regional Museum of Mixquic <b>is</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> the parish church. It contains exhibitions of local archeological pieces which mostly date between 1200 to 1500CE but also some from the Toltec and Teotihuacan periods. The church and former monastery are also classed as an archeological site. The Andrés Quintana Roo Museum has a collection of 279 archeological pieces from the collectionof Dr. Socorro Bernal Roque. The pieces are mostly of clay and stone from the Teotihuacan era found in the Tlahuac area. The most important pieces are a chac-mool, the remains of a teotlachtli, clay and stone seals, a tzompantli and a cylindrical serpent. The Tomás Medina Villarruel Museum is named after a native of San Juan Ixtayopan who is an important figure in the conservation of the archeological record of the area. In 1984, he and his family donated a collection of 850 pieces to the borough. The museum was built in 1998 as a community museum and the collection has since grown with new donations. The Fábrica de Artes y Oficios FARO Tláhuac was founded in 2006, as part of a network of FAROs sponsored by the city Secretary of Culture. Its aim is to promote community involvement in the arts and various trades. It has workshops on various to allow residents to learn creative and practical skills as well as conferences, cinema, theater, art exhibitions, concerts and more. Other cultural institutions in the borough include the Centro Cultural Zapotitlán, Centro Cultural Santa Catarina, Centro Cultural Nopalera, Casa de Cultura Diego Rivera, Casa de Cultura Frida Kahlo, Casa de Cultura Ampliación Los Olivos and the Casa de Cultura Rosario Castellanos.|$|E

500|$|The {{months leading}} up to the {{introduction}} of the ban had also seen a particularly intense period of Troubles-related violence. One of the bloodiest episodes of that time was the Ballygawley bus bombing which resulted in the deaths of several British soldiers. Another incident, the killing of two off-duty British soldiers who drove into an IRA funeral procession, brought the media into conflict with the government after journalists present at the funeral declined a Royal Ulster Constabulary request to hand over footage of the incident amid concerns doing so would put them at risk. In response the Prime Minister, Margaret Thatcher, told the House of Commons journalists had a [...] "bounden duty" [...] to assist with the investigation. [...] "Either one <b>is</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> justice in these matters or one <b>is</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> terrorism".

There is not the sort of revelry one would expect in a tale about a miniature household but rather a [...] "desperate sense" [...] of wanting to keep that household free of invaders and unwanted outsiders. The Tale of Two Bad Mice is another tale about a miniature household, but there Potter <b>is</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> the invading two bad mice.

500|$|The god Krishna, {{who is a}} {{close friend}} of and advisor to the Pandavas, hears of Duryodhana's plan, and devises one of his own, to ensure that Aravan will give himself as a {{sacrifice}} on behalf of the Pandavas rather than the Kauravas. [...] Krishna first discusses the issue with Yudhishthira (Dharma or Dharmaraja), the eldest of the Pandavas, recommending the sacrifice to Kali as a part of an ayudha-puja ("worship of the weapons"). Krishna establishes that there are four candidates most suited to being offered as the victim: Shalya, who <b>is</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> Kauravas; Arjuna, the commander of the Pandavas; Aravan; and Krishna himself. From this shortlist, Krishna finally narrows the best choice down to Aravan. Aravan agrees to undergo the kalappali on behalf of the Pandavas but mentions his prior commitment to Duryodhana.|$|E

500|$|In Things Fall Apart, Okonkwo's furious manhood overpowers {{everything}} [...] "feminine" [...] in his life, {{including his}} own conscience. For example, when he feels bad after being forced to kill his adopted son, he asks himself: [...] "When did you become a shivering old woman?" [...] It is also argued that one’s chi, or personal god, is the ‘mother within’. This understanding further demonstrates how Okonkwo’s hypermasculinity corrupts his conscience, as his contempt for his own mother and other women prevents him from being in harmony with his chi. He views all things feminine as distasteful, {{in part because they}} remind him of his father's laziness and cowardice. His father was considered an agbala—a word that refers to a man without title, but is also synonymous with ‘woman’. Thus, Okonkwo not only regrets his father’s lack of success, but attributes it to a lack of masculinity. Okonkwo’s feminization of all things lacking success or power is a common theme throughout the novel. His obsession with maleness is fuelled by an intense fear of femaleness, which he expresses through physical and verbal abuse of his wives, his violence towards his community, his constant worry that his son Nwoye is not manly enough, and his wish that his daughter Ezinma had been born a boy. The women in the novel, meanwhile, are obedient, quiet, and absent from positions of authority– despite the fact that Igbo women were traditionally involved in village leadership. Nevertheless, the need for feminine balance is highlighted by Ani, the earth goddess, and the extended discussion of [...] "Nneka" [...] ("Mother is supreme") in chapter fourteen. Ekwefi’s perseverance and love for Ezinma, despite her many miscarriages, is seen as a tribute to Igbo womanhood, which is typically defined by motherhood. Okonkwo's defeat is seen by some as a vindication of the need for a balancing feminine ethos. Some have also argued that all of Okonkwo’s failures are tied to his contempt and fear of women and his inability to form quality personal relationships with the women in his life—his wives, his children, and his own mother. Achebe has expressed frustration at frequently being misunderstood on this point, saying that [...] "I want to sort of scream that Things Fall Apart <b>is</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> women... And that Okonkwo is paying the penalty for his treatment of women; that all his problems, all the things he did wrong, can be seen as offenses against the feminine." [...] Indeed, it is argued that Okonkwo’s violent and vehement anti-women position is the exception, not the norm, within his community of Umuofia and the wider Igbo society. Still, post-colonial African writing is intensely male-centred, a phenomenon that is not alleviated by the frequent trope of the African woman as the [...] "embodiment of the male writer’s vision for the new Africa". It is argued that even when women and their lives are more centrally depicted in literature, the male writer continues to be the visionary while the woman is the [...] "sign" [...] of changes to come.|$|E
