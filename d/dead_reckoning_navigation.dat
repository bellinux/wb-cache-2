50|$|The marine sandglass was {{critical}} for maritime navigation before the 19th century. At {{the beginning of}} that century it became possible to navigate by the lunar distances, thanks to the tables of haversines of Joseph de Mendoza y Ríos. Prior to this, <b>dead</b> <b>reckoning</b> <b>navigation</b> based on sandglass-determined times was used, alongside determination of latitude using the quadrant (see also backstaff, astrolabe, and octant); this was the only system available to mariners to navigate the globe. The parallel use of relative time measurements at sea, and time measurement by mechanical clocks on land continued from at least 1350 to 1805, i.e., for more than 450 years.|$|E
50|$|Although the Fw 200 was the {{heaviest}} Luftwaffe bomber, the bomb load was only 2000 lb. The plane was a converted airliner, {{and had not}} been designed to withstand damage.

5000|$|Like the United States Army Air Forces {{later in}} the war, Bomber Command had first {{concentrated}} on a doctrine of [...] "precision" [...] bombing in daylight. When the German defences inflicted costly defeats on British raids late 1939, a switch to night bombing was forced upon the Command. The problems of enemy defences were then replaced {{with the problems of}} night navigation and target-finding. It was common {{in the early years of}} the war for bombers relying on <b>dead</b> <b>reckoning</b> <b>navigation</b> to miss entire cities. Surveys of bombing photographs and other sources published during August 1941, indicated that fewer than one bomb in ten fell within 5 mi of its intended target. One of the most urgent problems of the Command was thus to develop navigational aids.|$|E

50|$|A drift meter, also drift {{indicator}} and drift sight, is an optical device {{used to improve}} <b>dead</b> <b>reckoning</b> for aircraft <b>navigation.</b> It consists of a small telescope extended vertically through {{the bottom of the}} aircraft with the eyepiece inside the fuselage at the navigator's station. A reticle, normally consisting of spaced parallel lines, is rotated until objects on the ground are seen to be moving parallel to the lines. The angle of the reticle then indicates the aircraft's drift angle due to winds aloft, and can be used to calculate the ground speed.|$|R

30|$|The {{demand for}} {{navigating}} pedestrian {{by using a}} hand-held mobile device increased remarkably {{over the past few}} years, especially in GPS-denied scenario. We propose a new pedestrian <b>dead</b> <b>reckoning</b> (PDR)-based <b>navigation</b> algorithm by using magnetic, angular rate, and gravity (MARG) sensors which are equipped in existing commercial smartphone. Our proposed navigation algorithm consists of step detection, stride length estimation, and heading estimation. To eliminate the gauge step errors of the random bouncing motions, we designed a reliable algorithm for step detection. We developed a BP neural network-based stride length estimation algorithm to apply to different users. In response to the challenge of magnetic disturbance, a quaternion-based extended Kalman filter (EKF) is introduced to determine the user's heading direction for each step. The performance of our proposed pedestrian navigation algorithm is verified by using a smartphone in providing accurate, reliable, and continuous location tracking services.|$|R
50|$|Radio waves cannot {{penetrate}} water very far, so {{as soon as}} an AUV dives {{it loses}} its GPS signal. Therefore, a standard way for AUVs to navigate underwater is through <b>dead</b> <b>reckoning.</b> <b>Navigation</b> can however be improved by using an underwater acoustic positioning system. When operating within a net of sea floor deployed baseline transponders this is known as LBL navigation. When a surface reference such as a support ship is available, ultra-short baseline (USBL) or short-baseline (SBL) positioning is used to calculate where the sub-sea vehicle is relative to the known (GPS) position of the surface craft by means of acoustic range and bearing measurements. To improve estimation of its position, and reduce errors in dead reckoning (which grow over time), the AUV can also surface and take its own GPS fix. Between position fixes and for precise maneuvering, an Inertial Navigation System on board the AUV calculates through dead reckoning the AUV position, acceleration, and velocity. Estimates can be made using data from a Inertial Measurement Unit, and can be improved by adding a Doppler Velocity Log (DVL), which measures the rate of travel over the sea/lake floor. Typically, a pressure sensor measures the vertical position (vehicle depth), although depth and altitude can also be obtained from DVL measurements. These observations are filtered to determine a final navigation solution.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a pedestrian indoor navigation {{system based on}} the multi-sensor fusion and fuzzy logic estimation algorithms. The proposed navigation system is a self-contained <b>dead</b> <b>reckoning</b> <b>navigation</b> that means no other outside signal is demanded. In order to achieve the self-contained capability, a portable and wearable inertial measure unit (IMU) has been developed. Its adopted sensors are the low-cost inertial sensors, accelerometer and gyroscope, based on the micro electro-mechanical system (MEMS). There {{are two types of}} the IMU modules, handheld and waist-mounted. The low-cost MEMS sensors suffer from various errors due to the results of manufacturing imperfections and other effects. Therefore, a sensor calibration procedure based on the scalar calibration and the least squares methods has been induced in this study to improve the accuracy of the inertial sensors. With the calibrated data acquired from the inertial sensors, the step length and strength of the pedestrian are estimated by multi-sensor fusion and fuzzy logic estimation algorithms. The developed multi-sensor fusion algorithm provides the amount of the walking steps and the strength of each steps in real-time. Consequently, the estimated walking amount and strength per step are taken into the proposed fuzzy logic estimation algorithm to estimates the step lengths of the user. Since the walking length and direction are both the required information of the <b>dead</b> <b>reckoning</b> <b>navigation,</b> the walking direction is calculated by integrating the angular rate acquired by the gyroscope of the developed IMU module. Both the walking length and direction are calculated on the IMU module and transmit to a smartphone with Bluetooth to perform the <b>dead</b> <b>reckoning</b> <b>navigation</b> which is run on a self-developed APP. Due to the error accumulating of <b>dead</b> <b>reckoning</b> <b>navigation,</b> a particle filter and a pre-loaded map of indoor environment have been applied to the APP of the proposed navigation system to extend its usability. The experiment results of the proposed navigation system demonstrate good navigation performance in indoor environment with the accurate initial location and direction...|$|E

5000|$|Until {{the mid-19th}} century, vessel speed at sea was {{measured}} using a chip log. This consisted of a wooden panel, attached by line to a reel, and weighted on one edge to float perpendicularly to the water surface and thus present substantial resistance to the water moving around it. The chip log was cast over {{the stern of the}} moving vessel and the line allowed to pay out. Knots placed at a distance of 8 fathoms - 47 feet 3 inches (14.4018 m) from each other, passed through a sailor's fingers, while another sailor used a 30-second sand-glass (28-second sand-glass is the currently accepted timing) to time the operation.
