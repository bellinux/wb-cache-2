Fumio Fujimura's second cycle on May 25, 1950, {{was the first time}} a player {{collected}} the hits in order. On average, the natural cycle occurs approximately every 13years. Other than Fujimura, the four players to hit for the natural cycle are Kazuhiko Kondo in 1961, Takahiro Tokutsu in 1976, Takanori Okamura in 1985, and Muramatsu in 2003. The natural cycle has only been accomplished in reverse by Ochoa (2004).|$|E

5|$|The natural cycle, {{in which}} the hits come in order from least total bases to most (single, double, triple, and home run), <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>accomplished</b> 14 times in MLB history. Bill Collins {{was the first to}} collect the hits in order on October 6, 1910. The natural cycle {{happened}} most commonly in the 1960s, occurring three times in a four-year span (Jim Hickman in 1963, Ken Boyer in 1964, and Billy Williams in 1966). It also occurred three times in a seven-season timeframe from 2000 to 2006: José Valentín in 2000; Brad Wilkerson in 2003; and Gary Matthews, Jr. in 2006. The natural cycle has also been accomplished in reverse (home run, triple, double, single) by six players: Bid McPhee (1887);Gee Walker (1937);Jim Fregosi (1968; his second cycle); Luke Scott (2006); Carlos Gómez (2008); and Rajai Davis (2016).|$|E

Despite discussion of programs to require payments for resources (especially water) and to collect fines from heavy polluters, however, little <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>accomplished.</b> The obstacles are a lack of law enforcement in these areas, inconsistent government economic and environmental planning, corruption, and the overwhelming concentration of power in the hands of a president who shows little tolerance of grassroots activity.|$|E

Where food preparation in traditional societies is more laborious and technically inefficient, modern society has strived towards speed and precision in its delivery. Fast-food restaurants, designed to maximise profit, have strived toward total efficiency since their conception, and continue to do so. A strict level of efficiency <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>accomplished</b> in several ways, including stricter control of its workers' actions, the replacement of more complicated systems with simpler, less time-consuming ones, simple numbered systems of value meals {{and the addition of}} drive-through windows.|$|E
25|$|The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) is the U.S. Federal agency {{responsible}} for conducting research and making recommendations for prevention {{of all kinds of}} occupational injuries and illnesses. Over the past 10 to 15 years, NIOSH has devoted considerable effort to building its capacity for research and prevention activities related to occupational road safety. This <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>accomplished</b> through analysis and interpretation of injury and fatality data development of injury prevention resources, and research to advance prevention of MVCs and resulting injuries in high-risk populations. NIOSH seeks to effect change through a variety of mechanisms: communication of research results through the peer-reviewed literature and industry channels, safety information targeted to employers and workers, changes in government regulations, and development of voluntary consensus standards.|$|E
25|$|Fort Queenscliff {{is located}} in the Borough of Queenscliffe, some 106km from Melbourne, on the western side of the {{entrance}} to Port Phillip. It occupies an area of 6.7 hectares on high ground known as Shortland's Bluff and overlooks the shipping lanes leading to Melbourne and Geelong. The Fort is a superb example of the defences that existed around the coastline of Australia from colonial times through {{to the end of the}} Second World War. Considerable restoration <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>accomplished</b> at Fort Queenscliff in recent years, including the recovery and refurbishment of some of the original guns, the restoration of historic buildings, and the development of a comprehensive indoor display and archival centre. Fort Queenscliff has been classified by the National Trust and entered in the Register of the National Estate.|$|E

25|$|A {{series of}} hiking, {{mountain}} biking, equestrian, and paved trails traverse the Canmore area. Major trail systems {{are located on}} the Benchlands of Mount Lady Macdonald, at the Canmore Nordic Centre, and along the north slope of Mount Lawrence Grassi. Many of these trails, and others around the community, are located within Bow Valley Wildland Provincial Park and Kananaskis Country. Some of these, including the Montaine Traverse Trail and the Highline Trail, have been improved by the Town of Canmore, the Government of Alberta, the Municipal District of Bighorn No. 8, and various stakeholders (Bow Valley Mountain Bike Alliance, the B.V. Riding Association, and local hiking groups) in order to balance recreational opportunities with environmental sustainability. Much of the upgrading <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>accomplished</b> by volunteers organized by the Trail Care Program of The Friends of Kananaskis Country.|$|E
25|$|Security Council Resolution 1325 was {{the first}} major step taken by the UN to include women as active and equal actors in “the {{prevention}} and resolution of conflicts, peace negotiations, peace-building, peacekeeping, humanitarian response and in post-conflict reconstruction and stresses the importance of their equal participation and full involvement in all efforts for the maintenance and promotion of peace and security”. A critique of this resolution is that UNSCR 1325 proposes the implementing gender mainstreaming, however the progress that <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>accomplished</b> in this area has focused on women, rather than on assessing the impacts of planned action on both men and women. In 2010, a comprehensive 10-year impact study was conducted to assess the success of this resolution and found that there was limited success with the implementation, particularly in the increasing women’s participation in peace negotiations and peace agreements, and sexual and gender-based violence has continued to be prevalent, despite efforts to reduce it.|$|E
25|$|Following {{the end of}} the ceasefire, {{both sides}} made small {{gestures}} of peace, with Santos ordering that the bodies of guerrillas killed in combat be identified and returned to their families while the FARC reiterated their will to remain in the negotiations. A technical sub-commission for {{the end of the}} conflict began discussions about confidence-building measures, while the mine clearance pilot project began in Briceño (Antioquia), with Humberto de la Calle highlighting the historic nature of the military and the FARC working alongside one another. The FARC's negotiators in Havana and their leader, Timochenko, adopted a conciliatory tone. Analysts opined that the talks had reached a point of maturity where both sides appreciated their common objective and jointly protect what <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>accomplished.</b> On June 4, the negotiating sides created a commission for the clarification of truth, coexistence and non-repetition - the basis for an extrajudicial truth commission on the victims of the conflict.|$|E

25|$|The {{ultimate}} single achievement among pitchers is {{a perfect}} game, which <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>accomplished</b> 23 times in over 135 years, most recently by Félix Hernández of the Seattle Mariners on August 15, 2012. By definition, a perfect game is counted as a shutout. A no-hitter completed by one pitcher is also a shutout unless the opposing team manages to score {{through a series of}} errors, base on balls, catcher's interferences, dropped third strikes, or hit batsmen. The all-time career leader in shutouts is Walter Johnson, who pitched for the Washington Senators from 1907–1927. He accumulated 110 shutouts, which is 20 more than the second place leader, Pete Alexander. The most shutouts recorded in one season was 16, which was a feat accomplished by both Pete Alexander (1916) and George Bradley (1876). These records are considered among the most secure records in baseball, because pitchers today rarely earn {{more than one or two}} shutouts per season with a heavy emphasis on pitch count and relief pitching. Complete games themselves have also become rare among starting pitchers.|$|E
25|$|The {{national}} economy following {{the withdrawal of}} the remaining funds from the Bank was booming and the federal government through duty revenues and sale of public lands was able to pay all bills. On January 1, 1835, Jackson paid off the entire national debt, the only time in U.S. history that <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>accomplished.</b> The objective had been reached in part through Jackson's reforms aimed at eliminating the misuse of funds and through his veto of legislation had he deemed extravagant. However, reckless speculation in land and railroads caused the Panic of 1837. Contributing factors included Jackson's veto of the Second National Bank renewal charter in 1832 and subsequent transfer of federal monies to state banks in 1833 that caused western banks to relax their lending standards. Two other Jacksonian acts in 1836 contributed to the Panic of 1837: the Specie Circular, which mandated western lands only be purchased by money backed by gold and silver, and the Deposit and Distribution Act, which transferred federal monies from eastern to western state banks and in turn led to a speculation frenzy by banks. Jackson's Specie Circular, albeit designed to reduce speculation and stabilize the economy, left many investors unable to afford to pay loans backed by gold and silver. The same year there was a downturn in Great Britain's economy that stopped investment in the United States. As a result, the U.S. economy went into a depression, banks became insolvent, the national debt (previously paid off) increased, business failures rose, cotton prices dropped, and unemployment dramatically increased. The depression that followed lasted for four years until 1841 when the economy began to rebound.|$|E
500|$|For a cricketer {{to score}} [...] a century (100 runs or more) on his Test match debut is {{considered}} a notable achievement, and as of December 2016, it <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>accomplished</b> 103 times by 101 players. Two of those players, Lawrence Rowe and Yasir Hameed, have scored centuries in both innings of their debut match. Players representing all ten of the Test-playing nations have scored centuries on Test debut; cricketers playing for Australia have achieved the feat the most often, doing so on twenty occasions, while only two Zimbabwean players have managed it.|$|E
