5|$|American {{officers}} serving under Pulaski {{had difficulty}} taking orders from a foreigner who could scarcely speak English and whose ideas {{of discipline and}} tactics differed enormously from those {{to which they were}} accustomed. This resulted in friction between the Americans and Pulaski and his fellow Polish officers. There was also discontent in the unit over delays <b>in</b> <b>pay,</b> and Pulaski's imperious personality was a regular source of discontent among his peers, superiors, and subordinates. Pulaski was also unhappy that his suggestion to create a lancer unit was denied. Despite a commendation from Wayne, these circumstances prompted Pulaski to resign his general command in March 1778, and return to Valley Forge.|$|E

5|$|On September 17, 2013, the {{government}} announced that a four-year tentative agreement had been reached with the Newfoundland and Labrador Association of Public and Private Employees (NAPE), the province's largest public sector union. The deal between the two was reached after 18 months of negotiations, during at which point NAPE released radio and television advertisements criticizing {{the government}} for saying the province's economy was booming while they laid off employees and told unions to expect a modest increase <b>in</b> <b>pay.</b> The tentative deal included a wage freeze {{during the first two}} years of the deal, a two per cent increase <b>in</b> <b>pay</b> during year three and a three per cent wage increase in year four. Full-time employees will also receive a $1,400 signing bonus, while temporary, seasonal and part-time workers will get a pro-rated bonus. As well a new job evaluation system would see significant monetary benefits for some employees. Two weeks after reaching an agreement with NAPE, {{the government announced}} tentative agreements with the Canadian Union of Public Employees (CUPE) and the Association of Allied Health Professionals (AAHP). Both agreements had a similar structure as the one government reached with NAPE.|$|E
5|$|Simon Spies, {{owner of}} Spies Rejser, speculated in February 1971 {{that he might}} merge his airline Conair of Scandinavia with Trans Polar, {{although}} he also stated that once his airline received new aircraft {{it would no longer}} necessarily need to charter aircraft from other airlines. Trans Polar was subject to a lawsuit by a laid-off pilot which the airline owed NOK26,600 <b>in</b> <b>pay</b> and compensation for him paying his own connection flights to reach Trans Polar charters. The company had issued several cheques and bills of exchange that had bounced and the pilot threatened to bankrupt the airline unless he was paid. The company responded that he would have a very difficult time bankrupting them and the press should instead write about the airline's future, which they regarded as very bright.|$|E
5|$|Unemployment {{had more}} than tripled by late November 2008, with over 7000 {{registered}} jobseekers (about 4% of the workforce) compared to just 2136 {{at the end of}} August 2008.

Since October 2008, 14% of the workforce have experienced reductions <b>in</b> <b>pay,</b> and around 7% have had their working hours reduced. According to the president of the Icelandic Federation of Labour (ASÍ), Gylfi Arnbjörnsson, these figures are lower than expected. 85% of those registered as unemployed in Iceland stated that they lost their job in October, after the economic collapse.|$|E

5|$|With {{the peace}} treaty concluded, Macrinus took {{measures}} to control the expenditures of Rome, by reversing Caracalla's changes and thus effectively reinstating the fiscal policies of Septimius Severus. This included a reduction <b>in</b> <b>pay</b> and benefits for Legionnaires, which was not popular with the Army who had placed him in command. These policies applied only to new recruits, but the enlisted soldiers saw this as setting precedent for further changes to the fiscal policies brought in by Caracalla. The sullen behaviour of new recruits, who entered service committing to greater labour for less payment, only furthered discontent among the soldiers. Gibbon suggests that from here only a small spark was required to ignite a rebellion.|$|E
5|$|In response, on 29 March, the British Secretary of State for War Leslie Hore-Belisha {{announced}} plans to increase the Territorial Army (TA) from 130,000 men to 340,000 {{and in so doing}} double the number of territorial divisions. The intended plan of action was for the existing units to recruit over their allowed establishments (aided by an increase <b>in</b> <b>pay</b> for territorials, the removal of restrictions on promotion that had been a major hindrance to recruiting during the preceding years, the construction of better quality barracks, and an increase in supper-time rations) and then form 'second-line' divisions from small cadres that could be built upon. As a result, the 61st Infantry Division was to be created as a second-line unit, a duplicate of the first-line 48th (South Midland) Infantry Division. In April, limited conscription was introduced. At that time 34,500 'Militiamen', all of the age of 20, were conscripted into the regular army with the intent of being trained for six months before being deployed to the forming second line units. However, despite the intention for the army to grow in size, the programme was complicated by a lack of central guidance on the expansion and duplication process, and issues regarding the lack of facilities, equipment, and instructors.|$|E
5|$|In the 17th century, a {{midshipman}} was {{a rating}} for an experienced seaman, {{and the word}} derives from the area aboard a ship, amidships, either where the original rating worked on the ship, or where he was berthed. Beginning in the 18th century, a commissioned officer candidate was rated as a midshipman, and the seaman rating began to slowly die out. By the Napoleonic era (1793–1815), a midshipman was an apprentice officer who had previously served {{at least three years}} as a volunteer, officer's servant or able seaman, and was roughly equivalent to a present-day petty officer in rank and responsibilities. After serving at least three years as a midshipman or master's mate, he was eligible to take the examination for lieutenant. Promotion to lieutenant was not automatic, and many midshipmen took positions as master's mates for an increase <b>in</b> <b>pay</b> and responsibility aboard ship. Midshipmen in the United States Navy were trained and served similarly to midshipman in the Royal Navy, although unlike their counterparts in the Royal Navy, a midshipman was a warrant officer rank until 1912.|$|E

On March 5, 2010, Lapierre was suspended four games for a hit against opposing forward Scott Nichol {{during a game}} against the San Jose Sharks the previous day. Nichol left the game injured after Lapierre pushed him from behind, causing him to crash into the end boards. In addition to the suspension, Lapierre lost approximately $14,000 <b>in</b> <b>pay,</b> which went to the National Hockey League Players Association (NHLPA)'s emergency fund. In the 2010 playoffs, Lapierre helped the Canadiens advance to the Eastern Conference Semi-finals, scoring goals in Game 6 of the first round against the Washington Capitals and the second round against the Pittsburgh Penguins, both elimination games. The Canadiens, however, were eliminated in the third round by the Philadelphia Flyers; Lapierre finished the playoff season with three goals and one assist in 19 games.|$|E
