2500|$|MSG is one {{of several}} forms of glutamic acid found in foods, in large part because glutamic acid (an amino acid) is {{pervasive}} in nature. Glutamic acid and its salts may be present in a variety of other additives, including hydrolyzed vegetable protein, autolyzed yeast, hydrolyzed yeast, yeast extract, soy extracts, and protein isolate, which must be specifically labeled. Since 1998, MSG cannot be included in the term [...] "spices and flavorings". The ribonucleotide food additives <b>disodium</b> <b>inosinate</b> and disodium guanylate are usually used with monosodium glutamate-containing ingredients. However, the term [...] "natural flavor" [...] is used by the food industry for glutamic acid (chemically similar to MSG, lacking only the sodium ion). The Food and Drug Administration does not require disclosure of components and amounts of [...] "natural flavor." ...|$|E
50|$|As a {{relatively}} expensive product, <b>disodium</b> <b>inosinate</b> {{is usually not}} used independently of glutamic acid; if <b>disodium</b> <b>inosinate</b> is present in a list of ingredients, but MSG {{does not appear to}} be, it is possible that glutamic acid is provided as part of another ingredient or is naturally occurring in another ingredient like tomatoes, Parmesan cheese or yeast extract.|$|E
50|$|In {{the food}} industry, inosinic acid and its salts such as <b>disodium</b> <b>inosinate</b> {{are used as}} flavor enhancers.|$|E
50|$|In 2004, <b>disodium</b> <b>inosinate</b> {{was removed}} from the food {{additive}} list by Codex Alimentarius Commission(but it is still mentioned on the last (2009) codex alimentarius list).|$|E
50|$|The food {{additives}} <b>disodium</b> <b>inosinate</b> and disodium guanylate are usually used in synergy with monosodium glutamate-containing ingredients, {{and provide a}} likely indicator of the addition of glutamate to a product.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Disodium</b> <b>inosinate</b> {{is used as}} {{a flavor}} enhancer, in synergy with monosodium {{glutamate}} (MSG) to provide the umami taste. It is often added to foods in conjunction with disodium guanylate; the combination is known as disodium 5'-ribonucleotides.|$|E
50|$|Inosinic acid can be {{converted}} into various salts including <b>disodium</b> <b>inosinate</b> (E631), dipotassium inosinate (E632), and dicalcium inosinate (E633). These three compounds are used as flavor enhancers with a comparatively high effectiveness. They are mostly used in soups, sauces, and seasonings for the intensification and balance of meat taste.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Disodium</b> <b>inosinate</b> (E631) is the {{disodium}} salt of inosinic acid with the chemical formula C10H11N4Na2O8P. It {{is used as}} a food additive and often found in instant noodles, potato chips, {{and a variety of other}} snacks. Although it can be obtained from bacterial fermentation of sugars, it is often commercially prepared from animal sources.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Disodium</b> <b>inosinate</b> is {{generally}} produced from meat, including fish. Though it is normally a non-vegetarian product, {{it also may}} be produced from tapioca starch without any animal products involved in the production. The producer can provide information on the origin {{and it is in}} some cases labeled as [...] "vegetarian" [...] in ingredients lists when produced from plant sources.|$|E
50|$|Pringles {{have about}} 42% potato content, the {{remainder}} being wheat starch and flours (potato, corn, and rice) combined with vegetable oils, an emulsifier, salt, and seasoning. Other ingredients can include sweeteners like maltodextrin and dextrose, monosodium glutamate (MSG), <b>disodium</b> <b>inosinate,</b> disodium guanylate, sodium caseinate, modified food starch, monoglyceride and diglyceride, autolyzed yeast extract, natural and artificial flavors, malted barley flour, wheat bran, dried black beans, sour cream, cheddar cheese, etc.; Pringles varieties {{vary in their}} ingredients.|$|E
50|$|Disodium 5'-ribonucleotides, E number E635, is {{a flavor}} {{enhancer}} which is synergistic with glutamates {{in creating the}} taste of umami. It {{is a mixture of}} <b>disodium</b> <b>inosinate</b> (IMP) and disodium guanylate (GMP) and is often used where a food already contains natural glutamates (as in meat extract) or added monosodium glutamate (MSG). It is primarily used in flavored noodles, snack foods, chips, crackers, sauces and fast foods. It is produced by combining the sodium salts of the natural compounds guanylic acid (E626) and inosinic acid (E630).|$|E
5000|$|Nacho Cheese Doritos {{ingredients}} (U.S.), {{in order}} of percent of product: whole corn, vegetable oil (corn, soybean, and/or sunflower oil), salt, cheddar cheese (milk, cheese cultures, salt, enzymes), maltodextrin, whey, monosodium glutamate, buttermilk solids, romano cheese (part skim cow's milk, cheese cultures, salt, enzymes), whey protein concentrate, onion powder, partially hydrogenated soybean and cottonseed oil, corn flour, disodium phosphate, lactose, natural and artificial flavor, dextrose, tomato powder, spices, lactic acid, artificial color (including Yellow 6, Yellow 5, Red 40), citric acid, sugar, garlic powder, red and green bell pepper powder, sodium caseinate, <b>disodium</b> <b>inosinate,</b> disodium guanylate, nonfat milk solids, whey protein isolate, corn syrup solids.|$|E

50|$|In October 2009, the DOE banned bake sales, {{though some}} schools {{continue}} to have them with frequency. The DOE cited the high sugar content of baked sale goods and that 40% of NYC students are obese. Meanwhile, vending machines in the schools operated by Frito Lay and Snapple continue to sell high processed empty calorie foods such as Doritos and Juices. Contracts for the vending machines were awarded in no-bid deals through Mayor Bloomberg's office. As part of the DOE's ambition to create healthy diets among students, as of October, Frito Lay will have to put Reduced Fat Doritos in machines. The DOE considers Reduced Fat Doritos, which contain corn dextrin, corn maltodextrin, monosodium glutamate (MSG), disodium phosphate, artificial flavor, dextrose, artificial color, <b>disodium</b> <b>inosinate</b> and disodium guanylate, a healthy snack based on its June 2009 request for healthy snack vending machine proposals. The NYC school lunch menu contains numerous highly processed foods and high sugar content foods including chicken nuggets, French fries, French toast and syrup. NYC also continues to fail to meet the mandatory physical education requirements of NY State, and NYC DOE has failed to maintain or improve playgrounds instead turning them into ad-hoc additional classroom space or parking lots.|$|E
40|$|Expanded {{products}} {{have been developed}} by extrusion of non-conventional highly nutritious raw materials such as amaranth and chickpea blended with bovine lung. As sensory acceptance of these snacks is restricted, this study aimed at improving their texture, through the addition of monosodium glutamate (MSG) and <b>disodium</b> <b>inosinate</b> (IMP) flavor enhancers to the feeding material, or to the flavor added after the extrusion. Sensory and mechanical analyses showed that both enhancers affected texture, assessed by sensory and instrumental methods. Addition of IMP together with MSG to the chickpea-based snacks presented the best results. This beneficial effect was not observed in the amaranth-based snack, suggesting that IMP and MSG can favorably impact texture of extruded products depending on the amount and type of protein presen...|$|E
