He sought effective analytical methods of separating and identifying the individual amino acids, discovering a new type, the cyclic amino acids: proline and hydroxyproline. He also studied the synthesis of proteins by obtaining the various amino acids in an optically active form in order to unite them. He was able to establish the type of bond that would connect them together in chains, namely, the peptide bond, and by means of this he obtained the dipeptides and later the tripeptides and polypeptides. In 1901 he discovered, in collaboration with Ernest Fourneau, the synthesis of the dipeptide, <b>glycylglycine,</b> and in that year he also published {{his work on the}} hydrolysis of casein. Amino acids occurring in nature were prepared in the laboratory and new ones were discovered.

Data {{on the effect of}} the constituent amino-acids of carnosine on <b>glycylglycine</b> absorption rate have similarly been obtained. The solutions infused in each subject contained (A) carnosine (50 mmol l. - 1), (B) carnosine (50 mmol l. - 1) and <b>glycylglycine</b> (50 mmol l. - 1), (C) <b>glycylglycine</b> (50 mmol l. - 1), and (D) <b>glycylglycine</b> (50 mmol l. - 1), L-histidine (50 mmol l. - 1) and beta-alanine (50 mmol l. - 1). <b>Glycylglycine</b> produced a significant impairment in the mean rate of histidine absorption from carnosine (P less than 0 - 01). However, carnosine did not {{have a significant effect on}} the mean rate of glycine absorption from <b>glycylglycine.</b> Mean rate of histidine absorption from solution D was significantly higher than that from solution A (P less than 0 - 01). Mean rate of glycine absorption from <b>glycylglycine</b> was not significantly different during infusion of solutions B, C, and D. The results are consistent with the concept that carnosine on <b>glycylglycine</b> is probably because the affinity of mechanism; the lack of influence of carnosine on <b>glycylglycine</b> is probably because the affinity of carnosine for the dipeptide uptake mechanism is relatively low. A gross difference has been shown between mean absorption rate of histidine from free L-histidine (solution D) (25 - 8 mmol h- 1) and when it is given in the form of carnosine in the presence of another dipeptide (solution B) (8 - 7 mmol h- 1); that emphasizes the complexity of amino acid and peptide interaction during absorption, which must be important in nutrition...|$|E
40|$|The {{transport}} system for <b>glycylglycine</b> in Escherichia coli behaves like a shock-sensitive {{transport system}}. The initial rate of transport is reduced 85 % by subjecting whole cells to osmotic shock, and <b>glycylglycine</b> is not transported by membrane vesicles. The energetics of transport was studied with strain ML 308 - 225 and its mutant DL- 54, which is deficient in Ca 2 +- and Mg 2 +-stimulated adenosine 5 ′-triphosphatase (EC 3. 6. 1. 3) activity. It is concluded that active transport of <b>glycylglycine,</b> like other shock-sensitive transport systems, has an obligatory requirement for phosphate bond energy, {{but not for}} respiration or the energized state of the membrane. The major evidence for this conclusion is as follows. (i) Uptake of <b>glycylglycine</b> is severely inhibited by arsenate. (ii) Oxidizable energy sources such as d-lactate, succinate, and ascorbate, which is mediated by N-methylphenazinium methylsulfate, cannot serve as energy sources for the transport of <b>glycylglycine</b> in DL- 54, which lacks oxidative phosphorylation. (iii) When energy is supplied only from adenosine- 5 ′-triphosphate produced by glycolysis (anaerobic transport assays with glucose as the energy source in DL- 54), substantial uptake of <b>glycylglycine</b> is observed. (iv) When the Ca 2 +-Mg 2 +-adenosine triphosphatase activity is absent but substrate-level phosphorylations and electron transport are operating (glucose as the energy source in DL- 54), transport of <b>glycylglycine</b> shows significant resistance to the uncouplers, dinitrophenol and carbonyl cyanide-p-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone...|$|E

Jejunal absorption rates of both <b>glycylglycine</b> and glycylleucine followed the kinetics of a saturable process. The Km value in millimoles/liter of <b>glycylglycine</b> was significantly greater than the Km value of glycylleucine (43. 3 ± 2. 6 vs. 26. 8 ± 5. 9, P < 0. 05); and the Km value of glycine was also significantly greater than the Km value of leucine (42. 7 ± 7. 5 vs. 20. 4 ± 5. 4, P < 0. 05). While overlapping occurred among the Km values of free amino acids and dipeptides, the transport kinetics of dipeptides were characterized by higher Vmax values (in micromoles per minute per 15 centimeters) than those of free amino acids. For example, the Vmax values for <b>glycylglycine</b> and glycine were 837 ± 62 and 590 ± 56, respectively (P < 0. 02). While jejunal absorption rates of <b>glycylglycine</b> were not significantly affected by free leucine or free glycine, they were competitively inhibited by glycylleucine. The jejunal absorption rate of glycylleucine was not significantly altered by an equimolar mixture of free glycine and leucine.

40|$|Effect of {{systemic}} bacterial infection on absorption rates of L-histidine and glycyiglycine {{from the human}} jejunum in vivo 1 G. C. Cook, 2 M. D., D. Sc., F. R. C. P. ABSTRACT Jejunal absorption rates of L-histidine (from a 100 mmole/liter solution) and <b>glycylglycine</b> (from a 50 mmole/liter solution) were determined with a double-lumen tube perfusion system in vivo in 12 Zambian African men; six had acute bacterial pneumonia (infection group) and six had no clinical evidence of a bacterial infection (control group). With this experimental design the mean rate of histidine absorption was significantly higher in the infection compared with the control group, but mean rates for glycine absorption from <b>glycylglycine</b> were not significantly different. During the <b>glycylglycine</b> infusions, the luminal disappearance rate of the intact peptide was significantly greater than the total glycine absorption rate. The correlation between individual histidine and <b>glycylglycine</b> absorption rates was significant. That is probably because after intracellular hydrolysis and efflux to the lumen, some <b>glycylglycine</b> is reabsorbed as free glycine by the amino-acid transfer mechanism, {{and the rate of}} that has previously been shown to be increased in subjects with systemic bacterial infections. Am. J. Clin. Nutr. 30 : 1994 - 1998, 1977. Acute systemic bacterial infections not involving the intestine have been shown to increase, significantly, the rate of glycine absorption from the human jejunum (1).

40|$|A 30 cm {{segment of}} the duodenum, jejunum, or ileum of normal human volunteers was perfused, on {{separate}} occasions, with test solutions containing either <b>glycylglycine,</b> free glycine, glycylleucine, or equimolar amounts of free glycine and free leucine. Luminal fluid contained no hydrolytic activity against <b>glycylglycine</b> and minimal activity against glycylleucine. In each intestinal segment, amino acid absorption rates were significantly greater from the test solutions containing {{the same amount of}} amino acids in dipeptide than in free form(as high as 185 % increase). Perfusion of each intestinal segment with a test solution containing the equimolar mixture of free glycine and free leucine always resulted in a greater leucine than glycine absorption rate. This preferential absorption of leucine, however, was either diminished (jejunum) or almost abolished (duodenum and ileum) when the glycylleucine solution instead of the equimolar mixture was presented to the intestinal mucosa. Among the three segments, the duodenum exhibited the least potential for the disappearance of dipeptides. The jejunal and ileal dipeptide disappearance rates were either similar for glycylleucine (94 % vs. 92 %) or slightly different for <b>glycylglycine</b> (92 % vs. 79 %). Despite lack of a remarkable difference in the disappearance rates, absorption rates of constituent amino acids were markedly greater in the jejunum than in the ileum. This reduced amino acid absorption was brought about by a greater accumulation of free amino acids in the lumen of the ileal segment (3 to 10 -fold difference). Inhibition of free glycine absorption by leucine during the perfusion of the intestine with a test solution containing <b>glycylglycine</b> and leucine did not result in any greater concentration of free glycine in the lumen than when the <b>glycylglycine</b> test solution did not contain free leucine. Similarly, inhibition of free glycine and free leucine absorption by isoleucine was not accompanied by any remarkable alteration of absorption rates of the constituent amino acids of glycylleucine. The results of these studies suggest that: (a) dipeptide disappearance in the gut lumen is principally accomplished by intact absorption and not by hydrolysis; (b) intracellular hydrolysis of dipeptides is markedly greater in the ileum than in the jejunum, while dipeptide absorption rates are either similar or only slightly different in these two segments; (c) there is no appreciable hydrolysis of <b>glycylglycine</b> by the membrane-bound enzymes and {{only a small fraction of}} glycylleucine is hydrolyzed by these enzymes...|$|E

Histochemical localization of GGT and measurement of its activity were performed by using chromogenic substrates in sections and in aorta homogenates, respectively. The role of GGT in GSNO metabolism was evaluated by measuring GSNO consumption rate (absorbance decay at 334 nm), NNO release was visualized and quantified with the fluorescent probe 4, 5 -diaminofluorescein diacetate. The vasorelaxant effect of GSNO was assayed using isolated rat aortic rings (in the presence or absence of endothelium).

40|$|The surface {{chemistry}} of glycine, <b>glycylglycine,</b> adenine and thymine on Si(111) 7 × 7 are studied {{for the first}} time by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and Scanning Tunneling Microscopy (STM) experimental techniques. The results are supported with the density functional theory based computations by elucidating equilibrium geometries of the adsorbate-substrate structures. In contrast to common carboxylic acids, glycine is found to adsorb on Si(111) 7 × 7 dissociatively through cleavage of a NH bond instead of O−H bond. Increasing the glycine film thickness reveals the existence of a transitional adlayer between the first adlayer and the zwitterionic multilayer. This transitional adlayer is estimated to be 1 - 2 adlayer thick and is characterized by the presence of intermolecular NHO hydrogen bond. Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations of glycine adsorption on Si(111) 7 × 7 and Si(100) 2 × 1 model surfaces illustrates that the formation of different surface adducts involving the –NH 2 and –COOH functional groups plays a vital role in determining the adsorbate structures on the 7 × 7 and 2 × 1 surfaces and therefore control the ultimate surface adproducts. The unique unidentate adsorption configuration of glycine on Si(111) 7  7 through NH dissociation, with the unreacted carboxyl group remaining free, has shown to be an effective way to capture other biomolecules such as <b>glycylglycine,</b> alanine, adenine and thymine on a glycine-functionalized Si(111) 7 × 7 surface and through [OHN] hydrogen bonding. The captured molecules can be released simply by annealing. The glycine-functionalized Si(111) surface therefore provides a flexible platform for potential applications as selective molecular traps, chemical sensors, and biomolecular electronic components. The STM study of glycine adsorption on Si(111) 7 × 7 provides strong evidence for dissociative adsorption of glycine through N–H bond cleavage (and N–Si bond formation) as reported in X-ray photoemission study. In addition, STM images with higher glycine exposures shows that the second adlayer is mediated by vertical hydrogen bonding and that the horizontal hydrogen bonding between two N–H dissociated glycine adsorbates at two neighbouring adatom sites can be possible. Similar to glycine adsorption on Si(111) 7 × 7 surface, the XPS investigation of <b>glycylglycine</b> on the Si(111) 7 × 7 also reveals three growth stages; dissociative adsorption of <b>glycylglycine</b> in the first adlayer, a hydrogen bonded transitional adlayer and a ultimately the zwitterionic multilayer. In contrast to glycine, <b>glycylglycine</b> adsorbs in a bidentate fashion with the dissociation of N‒H and O‒H bonds in the first adlayer. The STM investigations support the evidence of dissociative adsorption of <b>glycylglycine</b> in a bidentate fashion on two adjacent Si adatoms across a dimer wall or an adatom-restatom pair as observed from the filled state images. The strong bidentate interactions of <b>glycylglycine</b> with the Si atoms also inhibit surface diffusion of the adsorbed fragment, and the adsorption apparently follows random sequential adsorption statistics. The XPS and STM results of the <b>glycylglycine</b> adsorption on Si(111) 7 × 7 can be corroborated with our DFT based computational study which suggests that the bidentate adproducts involving N–H and O–H dissociations are viable. In addition, the DFT results also predict that the free –CONH– and –COOH groups remaining on the respective bidentate adstructures could facilitate adsorption of the second adlayer through the formation of hydrogen bonding. In sharp contrast to glycine and <b>glycylglycine,</b> the STM studies of adenine on Si(111) 7 × 7 shows the evidence of molecular adsorption of adenine through dative bonding to the surface silicon atoms. The majority of the adsorbed adenine molecules are found to appear as dimer pairs at the initial adsorption stage, which are formed by hydrogen bonds. The experimental evidence of the formation of dative bonds between the substrate and adenine and the feasibility of the H-bond mediated dimers can also be supported by ab-initio DFT/B 3 LYP/ 6 - 31 G++(d,p) calculations and X-ray photoemission data. As the exposure of adenine increases, the numbers of dimers as well as the unique self-organized adenine structures also increase. These dimers and self-assembled structures are found to be most prominent in the growth of adenine nanowires, most notably aligned along the Si dimer-wall or [- 110] direction of the 7 × 7 unit cell. The self-aligned adenine dimer nanowires offer a natural template for catch-and-release biosensing, lithography, and molecular electronic applications. On the other hand, the STM study of another nucleobase thymine on Si(111) 7 × 7 surfaces reveal the existence of three different kinds of adsorption products. When compared with the XPS and DFT based computational methods, it can be suggested that the three different adsorption products could correspond to 1, 4 and 3, 6 cycloaddition products and hydrogen bonded adcomplex respectively. The statistical analysis for three different exposures of Thy on the 7 × 7 surface further helps to assign the three different features observed in STM images to the 1, 4 and 3, 6 cycloaddition products {{as well as to the}} hydrogen bonded adcomplexes.

The Mn II atom is located on an inversion center and is coordinated to six water molecules in a slightly distorted octahedral geometry. The Cu II atom is chelated by the tetradentate Schiff base ligand in a distorted CuN 2 O 2 square-planar coordination. In the crystal structure, the complex [Mn(H 2 O) 6] 2 + cations and the [CuL] anions are arranged in columns parallel to the a axis and are held together by O—H O hydrogen bonding. Additional hydrogen bonds of the same type further link the columns into a three-dimensional network...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT A 30 cm {{segment of}} the duodenum, je-junum, or ileum of normal human volunteers was per-fused, on {{separate}} occasions, with test solutions contain-ing either <b>glycylglycine,</b> free glycine, glycylleucine, or equimolar amounts of free glycine and free leucine. Lu-minal fluid contained no hydrolytic activity against gly-cylglycine and minimal activity against glycylleucine. In each intestinal segment, amino acid absorption rates were significantly greater from the test solutions con-taining {{the same amount of}} amino acids in dipeptide than in free form (as high as 185 % increase). Perfusion of each intestinal segment with a test solution containing the equimolar mixture of free glycine and free leucine always resulted in a greater leucine than glycine ab-sorption rate. This preferential absorption of leucine, however, was either diminished (jejunum) or almost abolished (duodenum and ileum) when the glycylleucine solution instead of the equimolar mixture was presented to the intestinal mucosa. Among the three segments, the duodenum exhibited the least potential for the disap-pearance of dipeptides. The jejunal and ileal dipeptide disappearance rates were either similar for glycylleucine (94 % vs. 92 %) or slightly different for <b>glycylglycine</b> (92 % vs. 79 %). Despite lack of a remarkable difference in the disappearance rates, absorption rates of con-stituent amino acids were markedly greater in the je-junum than in the ileum. This reduced amino acid ab-sorption was brought about by a greater accumulation of free amino acids in the lumen of the ileal segment (3 to 10 -fold difference). Inhibition of free glycine ab-sorption by leucine during the perfusion of the intestine with a test solution containing <b>glycylglycine</b> and leucine did not result in any greater concentration of free glycin...|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe gas-phase basicities of serine and dipeptides {{containing}} {{amino acid}} residues of serine and glycine {{were determined by}} proton transfer reactions in a Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometer. The gas-phase basicity (GB) of l-serine {{was found to be}} 205. 9 kcal/mol, with addition of a hydroxymethyl group (CH 2 OH) increasing the basicity by 4. 5 kcal/mol relative to the simplest amino acid glycine (GB = 201. 4 kcal/mol). This is attributed to a combination of intramolecular hydrogen bonding, induction, and symmetry effects. For the dipeptides, addition of a hydroxymethyl group does not result in a large increase in basicity relative to the basicity of <b>glycylglycine</b> (GB = 208. 0 kcal/mol). The gas-phase basicities determined for glycyl-l-serine,l-serylglycine, and l-seryl-l-serine are 209. 3, 210. 6, and 210. 9 kcal/mol, respectively. In comparison to <b>glycylglycine,</b> addition of the hydroxymethyl group at the N terminus has a greater impact on basicity than its placement at the C terminus. These data suggest that the protonation site for these dipeptides is the N-terminal amino nitrogen...|$|E
40|$|The initial-velocity {{kinetics}} of hog kidney gamma-glutamyltransferase were studied. Glutamate gamma-(4 -nitroanilide) and its 3 -carboxy derivative, glutamate gamma-(3 -carboxy- 4 -nitroanilide), {{served as}} gamma-glutamyl donors, and <b>glycylglycine</b> as an acceptor. Reaction products {{were identified by}} paper chromatography and amino acid analysis. Inhibited Ping Pong mechanisms and a comprehensive initial- velocity expression were developed which account for the observed simultaneous gamma-glutamyl transfer and autotransfer, competitive inhibition by <b>glycylglycine,</b> and non-competitive inhibition by the carboxy donor. The validity of the proposed Ping Pong mechanisms are supported by enzyme-velocity data obtained with constant ratios of acceptor to donor concentrations. Kinetic constants were determined by a non-linear regression analysis. With glutamate gamma-(4 -nitroanilide) as the donor, Michaelis constants for the donor, acceptor and donor-acting-as-acceptor are 1. 87, 24. 9, and 2. 08 mM respectively. With glutamate gamma-(3 -carboxy- 4 -nitroanilide) as the donor, these Michaelis constants are 1. 63, 16. 6, and 12. 3 mM.
