25|$|Scorpions are {{opportunistic}} predators {{of small}} arthropods and insects. They use their chelae (pincers) {{to catch the}} prey initially. Depending on the toxicity of their venom and size of their claws, they will then either crush the prey or inject it with neurotoxic venom. The neurotoxins consist {{of a variety of}} small proteins as well as sodium and potassium cations, which serve to interfere with neurotransmission in the victim. Scorpions use their venom to kill or paralyze their prey {{so that it can be}} eaten; in general, it is fast acting, allowing for effective prey capture. Scorpion venoms are optimised for action on other arthropods and therefore most scorpions are relatively harmless to humans; stings produce only local effects (such as pain, numbness or swelling). A few scorpion species, however, mostly in the family Buthidae, can be dangerous to humans. The scorpion that is responsible for the most human deaths is Androctonus australis, or <b>fat-tailed</b> <b>scorpion</b> of North Africa. The toxicity of A.australiss venom is roughly half that of the deathstalker (Leiurus quinquestriatus), but since A.australis injects quite a bit more venom into its prey, it is the most deadly to humans. Human deaths normally occur in the young, elderly, or infirm; scorpions are generally unable to deliver enough venom to kill healthy adults. Some people, however, may be allergic to the venom of some species, in which case the scorpion's sting can more likely kill. A primary symptom of a scorpion sting is numbing at the injection site, sometimes lasting for several days. It has been found that scorpions have two types of venom: a translucent, weaker venom designed to stun only, and an opaque, more potent venom designed to kill heavier threats.|$|E

50|$|Androctonus is {{widespread}} in North and West Africa, the Middle East, but the wider family tolerates {{a wider range}} of habitats. This relates to the fact that black <b>fat-tailed</b> <b>scorpions</b> are rather efficient when temperatures range from 85 °F-95 °F, as this temperature allows for productive growth. Black <b>fat-tailed</b> <b>scorpions</b> are normally found in arid or semi-arid areas as well as margins of desert areas, typically areas with sandy soil. They generally prefer warm and dry areas.|$|R
50|$|Black <b>fat-tailed</b> <b>{{scorpion}}s</b> {{come from}} the family of Buthidae, {{which is the largest}} of the scorpion family. They can be identified by their hefty physique. They tend to move very fast, and are of an aggressive nature. Black <b>fat-tailed</b> <b>scorpions</b> can live for up to 5 years. Adults can reach up to 40-60 millimeters, 80 millimeters being the maximum. These scorpions typically possess black and brown coloration. These scorpions enjoy making scrapes with wood and rocks, and are nocturnal, thus they hide in crevices or certain objects during the day. They stay in shade to retain moisture (that they obtain from prey) in their bodies, as they are susceptible to losing moisture due to their environmental preference.|$|R
50|$|The Buthidae are {{the largest}} family of scorpions, {{containing}} about 80 genera and over 800 species as of mid-2008. Its members are known as, for example, <b>fat-tailed</b> <b>scorpions</b> and bark scorpions. A few very large genera (like Ananteris, Centruroides, Compsobuthus or Tityus) are known, but {{a high number of}} species-poor or monotypic ones also exist. New taxa are being described at a rate of several to several dozen new species per year. They occur in the warmer parts of every major landmass on Earth, except on New Zealand. Together with the Microcharmidae, the Buthidae make up the superfamily Buthoidea. The family was established by Carl Ludwig Koch in 1837.|$|R

50|$|Androctonus maroccanus is {{a species}} of scorpion, {{belonging}} to the family Buthidae. Along {{with other members of}} the genus Androctonus it is also known by the collective vernacular name <b>fat-tailed</b> <b>scorpion.</b> A. maroccanus is endemic to the Atlantic coast of central Morocco.|$|E
5000|$|While it {{originates}} {{from the}} Buthidae family, the black <b>fat-tailed</b> <b>scorpion</b> {{belongs to the}} genus Androctonus, which can be translated into [...] "man-killer". The species name is bicolor which is translated into having two-colors, which could be referring to their brown-black coloration. Scorpions are under the class Arachnida, making them arachnids that have eight legs.|$|E
5000|$|Fattail Scorpion or <b>fat-tailed</b> <b>scorpion</b> is {{the common}} name given to {{scorpions}} of the genus Androctonus, {{one of the most}} dangerous groups of scorpions species in the world. They are found throughout the semi-arid and arid regions of the Middle East and Africa. They are a moderate sized scorpion, attaining lengths of 10 cm (just under 4 in). Their common name is derived from their distinctly fat metasoma, or tail, while the Latin name originates from Greek and means [...] "man killer". Their venom contains powerful neurotoxins and is especially potent. Stings from Androctonus species are known to cause several human deaths each year. Several pharmaceutical companies manufacture an antivenom for treatment of Androctonus envenomations.|$|E
5000|$|Black fat-tailed {{scorpions}} use neurotoxic venom, {{which is}} fast acting {{and can be}} absorbed very quickly, {{because of the small}} molecular weight of the proteins that make up the venom. These neurotoxins act on the central nervous system, causing paralysis in the nerves that are responsible for respiration, which ultimately causes death by respiratory failure. The neurotoxins may also cause widespread neuronal excitation, symptoms of which can include pain, sweating, salivation, and tearing. Severe envenomation is likely, as the rate of envenoming is 10-20%, making it potentially lethal. Victims are likely to feel progressively weaker after envenoming. Envenoming can result in death, which can occur between 5 and 15 hours, but it is also possible for death to occur within one hour. Examples of common symptoms that occur after a sting are: drowsiness, drooping eyelids, paralysis of neck muscles, loss of muscle coordination, and abdominal pain. A monovalent antivenom (an antivenom that heals stings of specific species [...] ) called Anti-scorpionique is available to treat stings from a black <b>fat-tailed</b> <b>scorpion.</b>|$|E
