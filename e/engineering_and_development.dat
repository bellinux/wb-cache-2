5|$|In November 2008, the U.S. Department of Energy, {{which had}} {{oversight}} over the reactor in Oak Ridge, allowed the scientific {{use of the}} extracted berkelium. The production lasted 250 days and ended in late December 2008, resulting in 22milligrams of berkelium, enough to perform the experiment. In January 2009, the berkelium was removed from ORNL’s High Flux Isotope Reactor; it was subsequently cooled for 90 days and then processed at ORNL’s Radiochemical <b>Engineering</b> <b>and</b> <b>Development</b> Center to separate and purify the berkelium material, which took another 90 days. Its half-life is only 330days: after that time, half the berkelium produced would have decayed. Because of this, the berkelium target had to be quickly transported to Russia; for the experiment to be viable, {{it had to be}} completed within six months of its departure from the United States. The target was packed into five lead containers to be flown from New York to Moscow.|$|E

25|$|Some {{scholars}} claim Shapur sent Valerian {{and some}} of his army to the city of Bishapur, where they lived in relatively good conditions. Shapur used the remaining soldiers in <b>engineering</b> <b>and</b> <b>development</b> plans, as the Romans were skilled tradesman and artisans. Band-e Kaisar (Caesar's dam) is one of the remnants of Roman engineering located near the ancient city of Susa.|$|E
25|$|Design of {{the chassis}} {{began in the}} late 1980s, after Chrysler had bought another automaker, American Motors Corporation (AMC) in 1987. During this time, Chrysler began {{designing}} the replacement for the Dodge Dynasty and Chrysler New Yorker, as well as a potential Plymouth. The initial design of Dodge's LH bore resemblance to the Dynasty, and this design was scrapped entirely after François Castaing, formerly AMC's Vice President of product <b>engineering</b> <b>and</b> <b>development,</b> became Chrysler's Vice President of vehicle engineering in 1988. The new design, under Castaing's leadership, began with the Eagle Premier, also sold later as the Dodge Monaco.|$|E

25|$|As AMC began {{development}} of the next Jeep in 1985, management created a business process that {{is now known as}} product lifecycle management (PLM). According to François Castaing, Vice President for Product <b>Engineering</b> <b>and</b> <b>Development,</b> the smallest U.S. automaker was {{looking for a way to}} speed up its product development process to compete better against its larger competitors. The XJC's development was aided by computer-aided design (CAD) software systems making the engineers more productive while new communication allowed potential conflicts to be resolved faster thus reducing costly engineering changes because all drawings and documents were in a central database. The system was so effective that after Chrysler purchased AMC in 1987, it expanded the system throughout its enterprise, thus connecting everyone involved in designing and building products.|$|E
500|$|On 23 March 1966, the Army awarded Lockheed an <b>engineering</b> <b>and</b> <b>development</b> {{contract}} for 10 prototypes, designating the aircraft AH-56A. Initial operating capability was planned for 1972 with an optimistic target of late 1970. Lockheed began {{construction of the}} aircraft at its Van Nuys, California facility, and on 3 May 1967, Lockheed held a roll-out ceremony for the AH-56A. The aircraft was christened Cheyenne by the Army. [...] The first flight of the AH-56 occurred on 21 September 1967. [...] The Secretary of Defense approved pre-production funding to support an initial production order for 375 aircraft on 8 January 1968. [...] Manufacture of the 10 Cheyenne prototypes was completed by 1969.|$|E
500|$|The {{decision}} in the district court ruling had been very costly to Accolade. [...] According to Accolade co-founder Alan Miller, [...] "Just to fight the injunction, {{we had to pay}} at least half a million dollars in legal fees." [...] On April 14, 1992, Accolade filed for a stay on the injunction pending appeal in the district court, but when the court did not rule by April 21, Accolade appealed the verdict to the Ninth Circuit of the U.S. Court of Appeals. A stay was granted on the mandate to recall all of Accolade's Genesis games, but the injunction preventing further reverse <b>engineering</b> <b>and</b> <b>development</b> of Genesis software was maintained until August 28, when the Ninth Circuit ordered it dissolved pending the appeal review.|$|E

2500|$|The Premier {{inspired}} {{many of the}} LH platform’s design features. François Castaing, formerly AMC's Vice President {{of product}} <b>engineering</b> <b>and</b> <b>development,</b> became Chrysler's Vice President of vehicle engineering in 1988, and as a result, the Premier was {{the starting point for}} Chrysler's new LH sedans. Although the cab forward styling was quite different, the engines in the LH cars were mounted longitudinally, like the Premier. This was [...] "a hallmark of Renault's front-wheel-drive designs" [...] and unlike any other car built by Chrysler to that time. The LH platform's dedicated transmission, the A606, was also quite similar in design to the electronically controlled automatic featured in four-cylinder Premiers. The Premier's body shell was used for LH prototype development mules, under which the LH drivetrain was tested.|$|E
2500|$|The Allen and Eggers discovery, {{initially}} {{treated as}} a military secret, was eventually published in 1958. Blunt body theory made possible the heat shield designs that were embodied in the Mercury, Gemini, Apollo, and Soyuz space capsules, enabling astronauts and cosmonauts to survive the fiery re-entry into Earth's atmosphere. Some spaceplanes such as the Space Shuttle made use of the same theory. At the time the STS was being conceived, Maxime Faget, the Director of <b>Engineering</b> <b>and</b> <b>Development</b> at the Manned Spacecraft Center, was {{not satisfied with the}} purely lifting re-entry method (as proposed for the cancelled X-20 [...] "Dyna-Soar"). He designed a space shuttle which operated as a blunt body by entering the atmosphere at an extremely high angle of attack of 40° with the underside facing the direction of flight, creating a large shock wave that would deflect most of the heat around the vehicle instead of into it. The Space Shuttle essentially uses a combination of a ballistic entry (Blunt body theory) and then at an altitude of about , the re-entry interface takes place. Here the atmosphere is dense enough for the Space Shuttle to begin its lifting re-entry by reducing the angle-of-attack, pointing the nose down and using the lift its wings generate to [...] "start flying" [...] (gliding) towards the landing site.|$|E
