The rigid form of PVC {{is used in}} construction for pipe and in profile applications such as doors and windows. It is also used for bottles, other non-food packaging, and cards (such as bank or membership cards). It can be made softer and more flexible {{by the addition of}} plasticizers, the most widely used being phthalates. In this form, it is also used in plumbing, <b>electrical</b> <b>cable</b> insulation, imitation leather, signage, phonograph records, inflatable products, and many applications where it replaces rubber.|$|E
25|$|This uses {{low-voltage}} {{electricity to}} transmit {{the action of}} the organ keys to the pipes. Earlier church instruments used a mechanical linkage of rods and wires to connect the keys to the pipes. With the new system, the console (also known as a key-desk) could be placed at virtually any distance from the organ's pipes and could be somewhat portable, as just an <b>electrical</b> <b>cable</b> and flexible wind line connected the console with other parts of the instrument. This also allowed the console to achieve its ubiquitous place—on an elevator platform in front of the stage, low in the orchestra pit for accompanying the film, and rising majestically to stage height for organ solos.|$|E
25|$|On 20 September 2011, a power fault {{disrupted}} train {{services on}} all 16 stations on the Circle Line. The four hours delay left thousands of commuters stranded during rush-hour.

Train services were gradually restored from 8am and all services were restored just before 10am. Dakota and Mountbatten stations were the last two to resume operations. Investigations were carried out. It was later found that a faulty cable beneath the platform level at Dakota Station caused a power fault on Tuesday morning that affected train services at all 16 stations on the Circle Line. 27,000 passengers were affected by the disruption during the four hours delay, with bus bridging services plying the Circle Line route.|$|E

He was disappointed at the standard of training that had been achieved by the I Corps and 6th Division signals units in the Middle East, and just as disappointed with the reinforcements arriving from Australia.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to discuss {{condition}} monitoring (CM) of medium voltage <b>electrical</b> <b>cables</b> by means of partial discharge (PD) measurements. <b>Electrical</b> <b>cables</b> are exposed to a variety of operational and environmental stressors. The stressors will lead to the degradation of the cable’s insulation material and ultimately to cable failure. The premature failure of cables can cause blackouts and will have a significant effect on the safety of such a network. It is therefore crucial to constantly monitor the condition of <b>electrical</b> <b>cables.</b> The first part of this paper is focussed on fundamental theory concepts regarding CM of <b>electrical</b> <b>cables</b> as well as PD. The derivation of mathematical models for the simulation of PD is also discussed. The simulation of discharge activity is due to a single void within the insulation material of medium voltage cross-linked polyethylene (XLPE) cables. The simulations were performed in the MATLAB® Simulink® environment, in order to investigate the effects of a variety of parameters on the characteristics of the PD signal. A nonintrusive CM technique was designed for the detection of PD activity within cables. The CM technique was used to measure and analyse practical PD data. Two MATLAB® programs were designed to analyse the PD data in both the time-domain and frequency-domain[URL]...|$|R
