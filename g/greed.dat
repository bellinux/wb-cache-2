5|$|Attempts to {{reconstruct}} the uncut version of <b>Greed</b> without use of the lost footage first began in 1958. At the Brussels International Exposition, the Cinémathèque royale de Belgique named <b>Greed</b> {{as one of the}} twelve greatest films ever made and simultaneously published von Stroheim's original, uncut script for <b>Greed,</b> which came directly from von Stroheim's personal copy preserved by his widow Denise Vernac. This publication led to three separate books that all used von Stroheim's script in order {{to reconstruct}} the original version of the film and compare it to the released version: a French book edited by Jacques-G. Perret in 1968 and two versions edited by Joel Finler and Herman G. Weinberg, both in 1972. Weinberg's book utilized 400 individual stills and production photos {{to reconstruct the}} uncut version of <b>Greed,</b> the first time that images from the uncut version were publicly available.|$|E
5|$|During {{the making}} of <b>Greed,</b> the {{production}} company merged into Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, putting Irving Thalberg {{in charge of the}} production. Thalberg had fired Stroheim a few years earlier at Universal Pictures. Originally almost eight hours long, <b>Greed</b> was edited against Stroheim's wishes to about two-and-a-half hours. Only twelve people saw the full-length 42-reel version, now lost; some of them called it the greatest film ever made. Stroheim later called <b>Greed</b> his most fully realized work and was hurt both professionally and personally by the studio's re-editing of it.|$|E
5|$|<b>Greed</b> is {{the desire}} for too much of what one does not need.|$|E
5|$|<b>Greed</b> premiered on December 4, 1924, at the Cosmopolitan Theatre in Columbus Circle, New York City, {{which was}} owned by William Randolph Hearst. Frank Norris had once worked for Hearst as a foreign {{correspondent}} during the Spanish–American War and Hearst praised <b>Greed,</b> calling it the greatest film he had ever seen. Hearst's newspapers promoted the film, but MGM did very little advertising. At {{the time of the}} release von Stroheim was in Los Angeles, having begun production on The Merry Widow on December 1. In May 1926 <b>Greed</b> was released in Berlin, where its premiere famously caused a riot at the theater that may have been instigated by members of the then-fledgling Nazi party.|$|E
5|$|The poem is a lyrical {{description}} {{of the life of}} a tribe he was living with along the Amazon river. While it has echoes of Tennyson in the rhymes and rhythms the poem itself is not overly Romantic, serving more as a tool to set the scene and then draw contrast between {{the lives of the people}} living here and those in England. The poem is a comment on savagery and <b>greed,</b> making the point that some in England were more 'savage' than those on the Amazon, either by a <b>greed</b> for gold or by their <b>greed</b> for gold driving others into poverty.|$|E
5|$|Artemis Fowl has {{a number}} of {{underlying}} themes, but the most essential of these are <b>greed</b> and the conflict between good and evil.|$|E
5|$|Arthur Lennig {{asserted}} that MGM's official budget for <b>Greed</b> was suspiciously high {{for a film}} with no stars, no built sets, a small crew and inexpensive film stock. Lennig suspects that MGM averaged the film's cost with the more expensive The Merry Widow {{in order to prevent}} von Stroheim from getting a percentage of the more profitable film. The Merry Widow ended up being a hit and earned more profits than <b>Greed</b> had lost; it cost $614,961 but earned $996,226 on its initial run.|$|E
5|$|Despite Stroheim's {{reputation}} as a perfectionist, <b>Greed</b> contains anachronisms. In the scenes on Polk Street, the main characters are clothed in 1890s fashions, but the extras wear 1920s clothing. Stroheim {{did his best to}} avoid such historical mistakes; he shot only those buildings that were from the era <b>Greed</b> was set in, and he kept motor vehicles out of sight while filming. Daniels stated that, despite his desire for authenticity, Stroheim sometimes had walls knocked out of real locations to achieve a desired camera position.|$|E
5|$|Ethically, silver also symbolizes <b>greed</b> and {{degradation}} of consciousness; {{this is the}} negative aspect, the perverting of its value.|$|E
5|$|<b>Greed</b> has {{sometimes}} been said to be over 100 reels long. Stroheim said that his initial edit was 42 reels, although several {{of the people who}} saw this cut remembered it as being anywhere from 42 to 47 reels. Grant Whytock remembered the edited version that Stroheim initially sent to him as between 26 and 28 reels. MGM's official studio files list the original cut of the film at 22 reels. As recently as 1992, former MGM Story Editor Samuel Marx erroneously claimed that the original version of <b>Greed</b> was 70 reels.|$|E
5|$|<b>Greed</b> was a {{financial}} disappointment. On its initial run, it earned $224,500 in the United States, $3,063 in Canada and $47,264 in other markets. In total it earned $274,827. Von Stroheim's biographer Arthur Lennig stated {{that according to}} MGM's records the final cost of <b>Greed</b> was $546,883. Another biographer, Richard Koszarski, stated that its final cost was $665,603: $585,250 for the production, $30,000 for von Stroheim's personal fee, $54,971 for processing and editing, $53,654 for advertising and $1,726 for Motion Picture dues.|$|E
5|$|Sabyasachi Chakrabarty as Naveen Roy. Cold at heart, {{a shrewd}} and a conniving {{businessman}} who even places human values and relationships below his <b>greed</b> for money.|$|E
5|$|Stroheim shot {{more than}} 85 hours of footage and obsessed over {{accuracy}} during the filming. Two months were spent shooting in Death Valley for the film's final sequence {{and many of}} the cast and crew became ill. <b>Greed</b> {{was one of the few}} films of its time to be shot entirely on location. Stroheim used sophisticated filming techniques such as deep-focus cinematography and montage editing. He considered <b>Greed</b> to be a Greek tragedy, in which environment and heredity controlled the characters' fates and reduced them to primitive bête humaines (human beasts).|$|E
5|$|The most {{prominent}} themes are the anti-war and environmental {{focus of the}} film. Nausicaä, the heroine, believes {{in the value of}} life regardless of its form and through her actions stops a war. Loy and Goodhew state there is no evil portrayed in the film, but the Buddhist roots of evil: <b>greed,</b> ill will and delusion. Fear is what drives the conflicts, the fear of the poisoned forest results in the <b>greed</b> and resentment. Nausicaä, {{in addition to being a}} transformative force, leads people to understand and respect nature which is portrayed as welcoming, spiritual, and restorative for those who enter it peacefully.|$|E
5|$|The {{motivation}} for an action {{refers to the}} internal passions or negative emotions that prompt the act, including: anger, <b>greed,</b> pride, deceit and so on.|$|E
5|$|The {{two films}} most {{commonly}} compared to <b>Greed</b> are Huston's The Treasure of the Sierra Madre and Welles' The Magnificent Ambersons. Rosenbaum believes that besides Huston's film ending with gold being {{lost in the}} desert and similarities between Trina's descent into madness with Fred C. Dobbs own obsessions, the two films have little else in common. The Magnificent Ambersons and <b>Greed</b> both have characters who struggle with class differences that lead to their downfall. Ambersons was famously edited down drastically by its studio and the cut footage is now lost. Rosenbaum goes on to state that <b>Greed</b> influenced the methods in which novels are adapted into films and filmmakers like Welles, Huston and Bill Forsyth followed von Stroheim's example by re-arranging the plot and adding new scenes to their films while still remaining faithful to {{the intentions of the}} original novels. The 1994 Jonathan Lynn film Greedy pays tribute to the film by giving the main characters the last name McTeague.|$|E
5|$|According to Mummer Kaylan, {{author of}} The Kemalists: Islamic Revival and the Fate of Secular Turkey, Bazna {{said that he}} began spying for the Germans because he needed the money and, {{although}} {{he was not a}} Nazi, he liked Germans and disliked the British. He also alluded to involvement with the Milli Emniyet Hizmeti, which became the Turkish National Security Service in 1965. The British historian Richard Wires wrote Bazna was motivated entirely by <b>greed</b> as he had dreams of becoming rich by selling secrets to the Germans. Wires described Bazna as a typical petty criminal from the Balkans, a man of low intelligence with no values except <b>greed</b> who was apolitical and opportunistic, taking advantages of whatever chances he found to try to get rich, but who was easily duped by the Germans.|$|E
5|$|As in {{his other}} films, von Stroheim used Christian imagery and symbols, such as crosses and churches. Trina first shows signs of <b>greed</b> on Easter Sunday and is murdered by McTeague on Christmas Eve. Christmas Eve was often {{depicted}} in von Stroheim's films and {{was close to the}} date of his father's death. Lennig asserted that the character of McTeague's father (who was only briefly mentioned in the novel) is based on von Stroheim's own father, while McTeague's mother is a tribute to von Stroheim's mother, to whom <b>Greed</b> is dedicated. Von Stroheim stated that he considered all of his good qualities to have come from his mother and all of his bad qualities to have come from his father.|$|E
5|$|However, the <b>greed</b> of {{toll road}} {{operators}} resulted in diminishing upkeep, which forced the province to enact legislature allowing counties to assume {{ownership of the}} roads. It took until 1907 for Oxford County to assume the toll road; the proprietors were compensated with $15,500 ($ when adjusted for inflation from 1916).|$|E
5|$|It was a mad waste. The colonists {{in their}} <b>greed</b> for more grass seed and sheep pasture burned {{millions}} of pounds worth of timber. They recklessly destroyed the wonderful {{beauty of the}} bush, baring the soil until it was carried away by landslides, and lowered the rainfall, and laid waste the homes of countless sweet songsters.|$|E
5|$|Pielke {{praised the}} final scene of the sketch as evocative of the {{original}} series and an indictment of capitalism. He wrote that Belushi finished off the sketch with a moving rendition of {{the introduction to the}} original Star Trek series, while modifying it slightly to emphasize that NBC's <b>greed</b> had ended the Enterprise mission.|$|E
5|$|The Archbishop's curse had no {{discernible}} effect, either on Urse's career or the castle. Other chroniclers record that Urse stole monastic lands, including some from Evesham Abbey. Urse {{gained a reputation}} for <b>greed</b> and avarice, {{especially with regard to}} church lands. Great Malvern Priory, however, claimed him as a founder in a 14th-century document.|$|E
5|$|The philosopher Peter Singer {{considers}} that usually when we describe an action as conscientious {{in the critical}} sense we do {{so in order to}} deny either that the relevant agent was motivated by selfish desires, like <b>greed</b> or ambition, or that he acted on whim or impulse.|$|E
5|$|Throughout the book, the third-person {{narration}} switches from {{following the}} human characters to following the fairy characters to present underlying themes of <b>greed</b> and conflict. The book received a mostly favourable critical response and several awards. A film adaptation {{was reported to}} be in the writing stage in mid-2008 with Jim Sheridan directing.|$|E
5|$|At {{home that}} night, Scrooge is visited by Marley's ghost, who wanders the Earth, entwined by heavy chains and money boxes, forged during a {{lifetime}} of <b>greed</b> and selfishness. Marley tells Scrooge that he has one chance to avoid the same fate: he will be visited by three spirits and he must listen to them or be cursed to carry chains of his own, much longer than Marley's chains.|$|E
5|$|Commentators {{attributed}} the mismanagement behind Enron’s fall {{to a variety}} of ethical and political-economic causes. Ethical explanations centered on executive <b>greed</b> and hubris, a lack of corporate social responsibility, situation ethics, and get-it-done business pragmatism. Political-economic explanations cited post-1970s deregulation, and inadequate staff and funding for regulatory oversight. A more libertarian analysis maintained that Enron’s collapse resulted from the company’s reliance on political lobbying, rent-seeking, and the gaming of regulations.|$|E
5|$|Given that Gadge is {{revealed}} {{to actually be}} a witch, Howick asked Shearsmith whether the former's character, Thomas, truly had witnessed Gadge engaging {{in some kind of}} supernatural activity. Shearsmith suggested that Thomas was motivated by <b>greed.</b> However, he begins to regret his choice when he witnesses Gadge being tortured. Pemberton, though, noted that the real-life accusations of witchcraft must have been based on some level of belief.|$|E
5|$|<b>Greed</b> is {{the first}} main theme that is {{introduced}} into the book, and specifically the desire to obtain gold. In a similar manner to other themes in the book, it changes throughout, becoming less of a focus near {{to the end of}} the novel, where Artemis is willing to part with a large sum of money to help someone else.|$|E
5|$|However, the bathhouse of {{the spirits}} cannot {{be seen as a}} place free of {{ambiguity}} and darkness. Many of the employees are rude to Chihiro because she is human, and corruption is ever-present; it is a place of excess and <b>greed,</b> as depicted in the initial appearance of the No-Face. In stark contrast to the simplicity of Chihiro's journey and transformation is the constant chaotic carnival in the background.|$|E
5|$|Hugh Despenser the Younger (1286–1326) became Royal Chamberlain in 1318 and the {{favourite}} of Edward II of England but {{developed a}} reputation for <b>greed</b> and, after falling out with the Barons, was accused of treason. He was forced into exile in 1321 with his father, who later fled to Bordeaux. Hugh was captured and sentenced to public execution by hanging (for thievery), and drawing and quartering (for treason).|$|E
5|$|In 2008, Gekko is {{promoting}} {{his new book}} Is <b>Greed</b> Good?, warning about a coming economic downturn. His estranged daughter, Winnie, runs a small, non-profit news website and is dating Jacob Moore, a top trader at Keller Zabel Investments (KZI). Jacob, a protégé of KZI managing director Louis Zabel, has been raising money for Dr. Masters and his fusion research project, which might create abundant clean energy. Jake is also financially assisting his mother, Sylvia, who has quit nursing to speculate in residential real estate.|$|E
5|$|In Japan, {{the film}} also {{influenced}} many horror films throughout the 1950s and 1960s. In these ghost story films, <b>greed</b> commonly leads to murder and extramarital affairs, many involving former samurai characters. Examples in this genre include Tokaido Yotsuya kaidan (1959). The 1998 Japanese horror film Ringu also {{falls in the}} tradition of Japanese folklore and film, which includes Ugetsu, Tokaido Yotsuya kaidan, Kwaidan (1965) and Onibaba (1964). The 2001 anime fantasy film Spirited Away follows Ugetsu and Kwaidan as a cinematic adaptation of Japanese ghost mythology.|$|E
5|$|In his 2005 and 2006 {{biographies of}} Druitt, D. J. Leighton {{concluded}} that Druitt was innocent, but repeated some of Knight's and Wilding's discredited claims. Leighton suggested that Druitt {{could have been}} murdered, either out of <b>greed</b> by his elder brother William or, as previously suggested by Howells and Skinner, {{out of fear of}} exposure by Harry Wilson's homosexual cronies. The propensity of theorists to associate Ripper suspects with homosexuality has led scholars to assume that such notions are based on homophobia rather than evidence.|$|E
5|$|Man's {{inability}} to live God's words makes the Avatar's teaching a mockery. Instead of practicing the compassion he taught, man has waged wars in his name. Instead of living the humility, purity, and truth of his words, man {{has given way}} to hatred, <b>greed,</b> and violence. Because man has been deaf to the principles and precepts laid down by God in the past, in this present Avataric form, I observe silence.|$|E
5|$|Melish likely {{held back}} {{much of the}} issue for later resale, and with few pieces available, prices for the set spiked, rising to over five times the issue price. The value dropped {{somewhat}} when the boom in commemorative coins burst in late 1936, but quickly recovered and the coins are valuable today. Melish has been assailed by numismatic writers for <b>greed.</b>|$|E
5|$|Parineeta {{primarily}} {{revolves around}} the lead characters, Lalita and Shekhar. Since childhood, Shekhar and Lalita have been friends and slowly this friendship blossoms into love. A series of misunderstandings surface and they are separated with the conniving schemes of Shekhar's father. The plot deepens {{with the arrival of}} Girish, who supports Lalita's family. Eventually, Shekhar's love defies his father's <b>greed</b> and he seeks Lalita.|$|E
