The study is concerned with the problems that occur in cooling towers at Dr. Mahmoud Sharif Power Station and their effects on the towers efficiency and to the maintenance cost. These problems include scale deposition, corrosion, microbiological growth, fouling, air suspended particles, clogged spray nozzles and cooling tower fan system problems. The objectives of this study are to investigate the above-mentioned problems and to study their effects on the cooling towers performance and to propose solution for these problems, in order to improve the performance of cooling towers and consequently achieve low maintenance cost and high plant efficiency with longer equipments life. Many solutions have been suggested to solve or reduce these problems, the solutions include installation of sidestream filter, air intake filters, conductivity control instrument, covering the <b>distribution</b> <b>basins,</b> use of better chemical treatment and introduction of cooling tower vacuum pump...|$|E
40|$|The {{deployment}} of materials for controlling stormwater has gained greater emphasis as municipalities and civil works groups look {{to cope with}} increasing climate variables. The effects of erosion and water loss, especially {{in areas that are}} not readily accessible, have led to increased costs to these groups. Many of these systems and structures have been in place for decades, with concrete structures for water distribution and metering utilized since the beginning. These systems are a combination of earthen ditches intermixed with flumes, and concrete connection and <b>distribution</b> <b>basins</b> between ditches. Over time these structures have sustained damage from use and are in need of repair or replacement. ASTM has defined a new group or classification of materials as Geosynthetic Cementitious Composite Mats or GCCMs. This new material classification has been used initially at industrial sites, at power plants, within road right-of-way, along railroad corridors, at airports, at landfills and other organizations looking for hard armor erosion control solutions, vegetation suppression, or challenging infrastructure repair. Concrete ClothTM geosynthetic cementitious composite mats (GCCM) are a groundbreaking material technology that makes it possible to use concrete on slopes, in water, and in other hard-to-reach locations, without forms or mixing and minimal equipment requirements...|$|E

40|$|We study {{partition}} of networks into basins of attraction {{based on a}} steepest ascent search for the node of highest degree. Each node is associated with, or "attracted" to its neighbor of maximal degree, {{as long as the}} degree is increasing. A node that has no neighbors of higher degree is a peak, attracting all the nodes in its basin. Maximally random scale-free networks exhibit different behavior based on their degree distribution exponent γ: for small γ (broad distribution) networks are dominated by a giant basin, whereas for large γ (narrow distribution) there are numerous basins, with peaks attracting mainly their nearest neighbors. We derive expressions for the first two moments of the number of basins. We also obtain the complete <b>distribution</b> of <b>basin</b> sizes for a class of hierarchical deterministic scale-free networks that resemble random nets. Finally, we generalize the problem to regular networks and lattices where all degrees are equal, and thus the attractiveness of a node must be determined by an assigned weight, rather than the degree.

40|$|Abstract: The {{analysis}} of magmatic <b>distribution,</b> <b>basin</b> formation, tectonic evolution and structural styles of different {{segments of the}} Andes shows {{that most of the}} Andes have experienced a stage of flat subduction. Evidence is presented here {{for a wide range of}} regions throughout the Andes, including the three present flat-slab segments (Pampean, Peruvian, Bucaramanga), three incipient flat-slab segments (‘Carnegie’, Guañacos, ‘Tehuantepec’), three older and no longer active Cenozoic flat-slab segments (Altiplano, Puna, Payenia), and an inferred Palaeozoic flat-slab segment (Early Permian ‘San Rafael’). Based on the present characteristics of the Pampean flat slab, combined with the Peruvian and Bucaramanga segments, a pattern of geological processes can be attributed to slab shallowing and steepening. This pattern permits recognition of other older Cenozoic subhorizontal subduction zones throughout the Andes. Based on crustal thickness, two different settings of slab steepening are proposed. Slab steepening under thick crust leads to dela-mination, basaltic underplating, lower crustal melting, extension and widespread rhyolitic volcan-ism, as seen in the caldera formation and huge ignimbritic fields of the Altiplano and Puna segments. On the other hand, when steepening affects thin crust, extension and extensive within-plate basaltic flows reach the surface, forming large volcanic provinces, such as Payenia in the southern Andes. This last case has very limited crustal melt along the axial part of the Andean roots, which shows incipient delamination. Based on these cases, a Palaeozoic flat slab is proposed with its subsequent steepening and widespread rhyolitic volcanism. The geological evolution of the Andes indicates that shallowing and steepening of the subduction zone are thus frequent processes which can be recognized throughout the entire system...|$|R

Sub-basin area and physical characteristics of the study area such as slope and aspect maps were determined with the help of DEM into GIS as layers.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a tectonic escape {{model for the}} formation of sedimentary basins in the Yangzhou Block of the Lower Yangtze Region, Eastern China. Nine sedimentary basins are identified in which the Pukou Formation of the Upper Cretaceous has been deposited. From south to north, the nine sedimentary basins are named: Wangjing, Qianshan, Wuwei, Nanxuan, Changzhou, Jurong, Nanjing, Quanjiao and Subei basins. They form a wedge-shape fragment (the Yangzhou Block) occupying an area of 100, 000 km 2 in the Lower Yangtze Region. The two side boundaries of the Yangzhou Block are the strike-slip Tanlu Fault and the strike-slip Quangjiao-Xiangshui Fault on the northwest and the strike-slip Qingyang-Nantong Fault on the southeast. The wide end of the wedge faces the Southern Yellow Sea in the northeast and the narrow end contacts the Dabie Block in the southwest. During the Early Mesozoic, collision between the Yangtze Block and the North China Block resulted {{in the formation of the}} Qinling- Dabie Orogenic Belt and caused the Lower Yangtze Region to become a foreland basin with many strike-slip faults. During the Late Mesozoic, wide spread extension in Eastern China and shortening in Qinling/Dabie Shan and in the Huaying Shan region resulted following establishment of an Andean-type arc margin to the east of the Southern Yellow Sea area, when 'Greater Japan' collided with Asia. Consequently, the wedge-shaped Yangzhou Block escaped tectonically toward the northeast and formed distinctive geological features in nine sedimentary basins during Pukou time in the Late Cretaceous. These geological features are reflected in <b>basin</b> spatial <b>distributions,</b> <b>basin</b> geometries, sedimentary facies, sediment thicknesses, sedimentary environments, and the petrology of fanglomerates and sandstones. These basin are part of a large population of arc-crestal rifts formed on top of that Andean arc.

40|$|The {{structure}} of a river network {{may be seen as}} a discrete set of nested sub-networks built out of individual stream segments. These network components are assigned an integral stream order via a hierarchical and discrete ordering method. Exponential relationships, known as Horton's laws, between stream order and ensemble-averaged quantities pertaining to network components are observed. We extend these observations to incorporate uctuations and all higher moments by developing functional relationships between distributions. The relationships determined are drawn from a combination of theoretical analysis, analysis of real river networks including the Mississippi, Amazon and Nile, and numerical simulations on a model of directed, random networks. Underlying distributions of stream segment lengths are identied as exponential. Combinations of these distributions form single-humped distributions with exponential tails, the sums of which are in turn shown to give power-law distributions of stream lengths. <b>Distributions</b> of <b>basin</b> area and stream segment frequency are also addressed.
