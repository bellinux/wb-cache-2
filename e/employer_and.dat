30|$|The most {{noticeable}} regional difference {{is in the}} earnings differences between <b>employers</b> <b>and</b> professionals vs. employees. In Latin America men earn a premium as <b>employers</b> <b>and</b> professionals but women do not, while in Europe and Central Asia neither men nor women earn a significant premium or penalty as <b>employers</b> <b>and</b> professionals.|$|R
30|$|Across all countries, on average, we {{find that}} <b>employers</b> <b>and</b> own-account {{professionals}} enjoy an earnings premium compared to employees, with major {{differences between men and}} women. While earnings premiums for <b>employers</b> <b>and</b> professionals are largest for men in middle income and Latin American countries, their female counterparts consistently earn a penalty in all countries (or an insignificant premium). Further, {{we find that}} neither male nor female <b>employers</b> <b>and</b> professionals earn premiums in Europe and Central Asia. This we believe might be due to fundamental differences in labor market and other regulations and laws, which can directly affect earnings premiums/penalties, between Latin America where <b>employers</b> <b>and</b> professionals are favored and Europe and Central Asia where <b>employers</b> <b>and</b> professionals are penalized.|$|R

30|$|On average, {{across all}} {{countries}} in the sample, <b>employers</b> <b>and</b> own-account professional workers earn a premium compared to employees, although there are important differences across countries and between men and women. Gender differences are particularly strong when examining earnings premiums for <b>employers</b> <b>and</b> professionals. Overall, male <b>employers</b> <b>and</b> professionals earn an 18 percent premium compared with all employees, while women face a penalty of roughly the same magnitude. In terms of regional differences, earnings premiums for <b>employers</b> <b>and</b> professionals are largest for men in middle income Latin American countries. On the other hand, women <b>employers</b> <b>and</b> professionals do not earn a statistically significant premium compared to employees in any region of the world. In addition, neither male nor female <b>employers</b> <b>and</b> professionals earn premiums in either high income or developing countries in Europe and Central Asia. Conditions appear to be favorable for <b>employers</b> <b>and</b> professionals in Latin America, as they are more numerous and earn greater premiums versus formal employees. In contrast, conditions seem to be less favorable for the same group in Europe and Central Asia, where they are fewer and do not earn premiums vs. formal employees.|$|R

5|$|Germanwings' {{parent company}} Lufthansa offered victims' {{families}} an initial aid payment {{of up to}} €50,000, separate from any legally-required compensation for the disaster. Elmar Giemulla, a professor of aviation law at the Technical University of Berlin quoted by the Rheinische Post, said he expected the airline would pay €10–30million in compensation. The Montreal Convention sets a per-victim cap of €143,000 in the event an airline is held liable, unless negligence can be proved. Insurance specialists said although co-pilot Andreas Lubitz hid a serious illness from his <b>employer</b> <b>and</b> deliberately crashed the passenger aircraft, these facts would not affect the issue of compensation nor be applicable to the exclusion clause in Lufthansa's insurance policy. Lufthansa's insurance company set aside US$300million (€280million) for financial compensation to victims' families and {{for the cost of}} the aircraft.|$|E

5|$|The {{decline of}} heavy {{industry}} in the 20th century left Windy Nook with no major <b>employer</b> <b>and</b> there was little {{in terms of economic}} activity. There is no major commercial area and residents usually travel to neighbouring Felling town centre to shop or use the small shopping area at the junction of Windy Nook Road and Carr Hill Road/Albion Street. However, in November 2011, planning permission was approved for conversion of the Black House Inn at the junction of Carr Hill Road and Coldwell lane into a 'Tesco Extra' store. The approval was granted in spite of complaints and concerns as to noise and traffic being raised by local residents.

5|$|The first mall to {{be opened}} in College Station, Post Oak is the largest mall within the Brazos Valley area. At its opening, it became the city's largest <b>employer,</b> <b>and</b> nearly doubled its city sales tax revenues. Though the mall {{generated}} additional traffic and added to the demand on city services, it also generated $1 million in annual sales tax revenue, $120,000 in property taxes, and a half-million in taxes for the city school district. It is credited with creating the first major impetus for growing economic and commercial developments for College Station, which previously lacked a major retail community. The mall generates over 75 percent of the area's retail sales through its approximately eleven million annual visitors. It remains the city's largest taxpayer and its second largest employer. It is also the top employer of the students of nearby Texas A University.|$|E
5|$|West Germans {{were able}} {{to cross the border}} {{relatively}} freely to visit relatives, but had to go through numerous bureaucratic formalities. East Germans were subjected to far stricter restrictions. It was not until November 1964 that they were allowed to visit the West at all, and even then only pensioners were allowed. This gave rise to a joke that only in East Germany did people look forward to old age. Younger East Germans were not allowed to travel to the West until 1972, though few did so until the mid-1980s. They had to apply for an exit visa and passport, pay a substantial fee, obtain permission from their <b>employer</b> <b>and</b> undergo an interrogation from the police.|$|E
30|$|Gender {{differences}} are particularly striking for <b>employers</b> <b>and</b> professionals. Statistically significant measured earnings premiums for male <b>employers</b> <b>and</b> professionals {{are consistent with}} the hypothesis that men in these categories have a comparative advantage in self-employment, or are being compensated for the higher costs and risks of self-employment compared to wage and salaried employees. The sizeable average penalties for female <b>employers</b> <b>and</b> professionals suggests that men and women make different calculations when deciding to become <b>and</b> remain <b>employers</b> or professional workers. One possibility is that because women are primarily responsible for unpaid domestic work, women are more willing to accept lower earnings as <b>employers</b> <b>and</b> professional own-account workers as compensation for flexibility in hours and location of work.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} effects of {{monetary}} policy on output, its distribu-tion, and welfare in a search-theoretic monetary model with heterogeneous agents. In the model, {{there are two types}} of agents: <b>employers</b> <b>and</b> workers. The paper considers two instruments of monetary policy: the money creation rate and the distribution of the monetary injection between <b>employers</b> <b>and</b> workers. Monetary policy redistributes consumption between <b>employers</b> <b>and</b> workers. This redistribution creates a channel by which both a higher money creation rate and a more favorable distribution of the monetary injection to-wards <b>employers</b> increase output <b>and</b> employment. The market equilibrium is inefficient. The Friedman rule along with the appropriately chosen distri-bution of the monetary injection between <b>employers</b> <b>and</b> workers achieve the first best. The sub-optimal distribution of the monetary injection magnifies the welfare cost of inflation...|$|R

5|$|At Marsh's urging, Powell {{pushed for}} Cope to return {{specimens}} he had unearthed during his employment under the government surveys. This was an outrage to Cope, {{who had used}} his own money {{while working as a}} volunteer. In response, Cope went to the editor of the New York Herald and promised a scandalous headline. Since 1885, Cope had kept an elaborate journal of mistakes and misdeeds that both Marsh and Powell had committed over the years. From scientific errors to publishing mistakes, he had them written down in a journal he kept in the bottom drawer of his Pine Street desk. Cope sought out Marsh's assistants, who complained of being denied access and credit by their <b>employer</b> <b>and</b> of being chronically underpaid. Reporter William Hosea Ballou ran the first article on January 12, 1890, in what would become a series of newspaper debates between Marsh, Powell, and Cope. Cope attacked Marsh for plagiarism and financial mismanagement, and attacked Powell for his geological classification errors and misspending of government-allocated funds. Marsh and Powell published their own side of the story and, in the end, little changed. No congressional hearing was created to investigate Powell's alleged misallocation of funds, while Cope and Marsh were not held responsible for any mistakes. Indirectly, however, the attacks may have been influential in Marsh's fall from power in the survey. Due to pressure from Powell over bad press, Marsh was removed from his position for the government surveys. Cope's relations {{with the president of the}} University of Pennsylvania soured, and the entire funding for paleontology in the government surveys was pulled.|$|E
5|$|Whilst wool {{remained}} {{an important part}} of the town's economy into the 19th (and even 20th) centuries, other industries were established in the town. A bell-foundry started in 1684 by William Cockey grew to be a major producer of components for the developing gas industry and employer of 800 people. The J W Singer brass foundry and bronze-casting works, was a major <b>employer</b> <b>and</b> produced bronze statues. John Webb Singer was born in Frome and established his art metal work foundry in 1851. They made brass ornaments for local churches and became known through the Oxford Movement within the Church of England which led to increasing demand for church ornaments. In addition to church ornaments the firm developed the facilities and expertise to create large statues. One of the first statues cast was a copy of General Gordon riding a camel. The firm was also responsible for the bronze statue of Boudica with her daughters in her war chariot (furnished with scythes after the Persian fashion), which was commissioned by Prince Albert and executed by Thomas Thornycroft. It was not cast in bronze until 1902, 17 years after Thornycrofts death, and now stands next to Westminster Bridge and the Houses of Parliament, London. The statue of Lady Justice on the dome above the Old Bailey was executed by the British sculptor, F. W. Pomeroy and cast by Singers. She holds a sword in her right hand and a pair of weighing scales in her left. The statue is popularly supposed to show blind Justice; however, the figure is not blindfolded. The statue of Alfred the Great at Winchester was a further commission. The statues from Singers have also been exported around the world. Printing was another major industry, with the Butler and Tanner printworks being set up in the middle of the century. Brewing was also a source of employment.|$|E

These gender differences are consistent with the hypothesis that women are more willing to accept lower wages as compensating earnings differentials for the flexibility of self-employment.|$|R
