25|$|When World War II {{broke out}} in 1939, Roosevelt could not support the United Kingdom directly, as in 1935 the Shipping Neutrality Act was signed to prevent Mussolini from invading Ethiopia. A {{solution}} was found by <b>flagging</b> <b>out</b> to Panama, which was under US control. The advantage for shipping companies was not having to comply with US regulations and not having to sail with US crew which were 50 percent more expensive than European crews at that time. In 1939 there were 52 tankers with a total capacity of 700,000 long tons of deadweight under Panamanian flag, a boost for flags of convenience.|$|E
40|$|The paper {{seeks to}} model the {{benefits}} and costs involved {{in the decision to}} flag out, and to provide arguments for alternative policies, aiming to counteract this age-long phenomenon. Based on the analysis of the evolution of worldwide and Chinese <b>flagging</b> <b>out,</b> the emphasis in the paper is on the comprehensive effect assessment of <b>flagging</b> <b>out</b> and the required adjustment of Chinese shipping policy. To identify the determinants of such an adjustment, the paper introduces fuzzy set theory and related models, aimed to assess the economic effects of <b>flagging</b> <b>out</b> through the use of context-dependent economic and societal indicators (factors). The degree to which such indicators contribute to the choice of flag decision is assessed through a questionnaire survey. In parallel, and {{in the context of the}} determinant analysis of fuzzy models, the paper probes into the 'policy competition' and 'government intervention' policies to counteract <b>flagging</b> <b>out.</b> In the same context, a comparative analysis of shipping policies between China and traditional maritime countries is undertaken, in order to assess the current 'openness' of the Chinese shipping policy and explore possible policy alternatives. The paper concludes that the preferred policy alternative for China would be the establishment of second international ship register. <b>Flagging</b> <b>out</b> Flags of convenience (FOC) International ship registers Shipping policy Fuzzy set theory...|$|E

Toward the end of thefirst decade of the 20 th century ferry -and passangervessels trading in the Baltic Sea wereflagged out from Åland to the flag of Sweden. <b>Flagging</b> <b>out</b> to Sweden is not common but thespecific circumstances for this trade has made the Swedish ship's register interesting for shipowners. The primary reason for <b>flagging</b> <b>out</b> was said to be currency exposure between theSwedish krona and the Euro, however there are other reasons aswell, for instance the EU banon wet tobacco. The paper studies the example of Åland from the different point of views. The purpose of the paper is to study if and how stakeholders experienced any impact fromflagging out.

40|$|Sweden {{has a long}} {{tradition}} of being a strong shipping nation. However, the industry is currently experiencing a rapid trend of shipping companies <b>flagging</b> <b>out</b> from Sweden to other flag states, most often to other European countries. The study explores this trend and touches upon the factors influencing the decision to flag out, how it could be stopped, and what consequences it might have for the Swedish shipping industry. From a transport perspective, the flag of the ship does not matter as the goods will leave/enter the country anyway. However, all respondents except one believe that the <b>flagging</b> <b>out</b> can have a substantial negative impact on the Swedish shipping industry regarding loss of competence, job opportunities, influence in international organizations, etc. All respondents agree that this trend is due to unfavourable competitive conditions associated with flying the Swedish flag. This can be summarized in three categories: economic factors, political decisions combined with lack of maritime strategy from the government, and problems with surveys of the ships.

40|$|The Swedish {{merchant}} fleet has declined sharply since the 1970 s, {{largely because of}} the lack of competitive conditions compared with many other countries, for instance Denmark. A large number of ships flagged out from Sweden, some shipping companies have even closed down offices and moved abroad which meant jobs being lost as a result. To prevent ships from <b>flagging</b> <b>out,</b> Sweden introduced various support measures such as subsidies for shipping and TAP agreements, which would reduce the crew costs for Swedish flagged vessels. These measures have not completely slowed down the <b>flagging</b> <b>out,</b> as it has continued to do so in recent years. Other European countries, such as Denmark and Norway, chose to adopt more parts of the Commission's State Aid Guidelines, for instance the international ship register and tonnage tax, which has increased their competitiveness against Sweden. To prevent further vessels from <b>flagging</b> <b>out</b> and promote regrowth in Swedish shipping, Sweden has decided to introduce tonnage tax in the summer of 2016, which has made the shipping industry very happy. The report was written in 2016 to find out what the Swedish shipping companies require to flag into Sweden, and if the tonnage tax will affect shipping companies to register their ships in Sweden. To find out, six shipping companies were interviewed, as well as the industry organization Swedish Shipowner’s Association and one of the unions. Overall the shipping companies are satisfied with some of the actions that has been adopted, including tonnage tax and the delegation of flag state inspections from the Transport Agency to classification societies. However, they demand long-term and reliable maritime transport politics, as well as that the Swedish Transport Agency should continue to improve, for example, their customer service and the procedure of flagging into Sweden. Furthermore, some of the companies want to see that the Maritime Officers' Association provides temporary or permanent exception from the requirements to have a Swedish master and chief engineer. In the Swedish Government Official Reports, SOU 2010 : 73, parts of the proposed actions have been implemented. The net wage model has been increased and the Swedish Transport Agency has appointed a supervisor to handle the matters regarding the registration of ships. However, the TAP agreement has not become a central contract or been increased...|$|E
40|$|As {{is already}} known, the 1981 - 1987 deep, {{prolonged}} and severe shipping crisis has forced almost all European Maritime Nations and Greece, to flag out to percentages that vary from 50 % to 95 % (Belgium). For certain flag administrations like Greece {{this phenomenon is}} an acute problem for which immediate measures should have already be taken {{a year or two}} ago. For some other flag administrations, like the Netherlands, <b>flagging</b> <b>out</b> benefits have been counted out via input-output analysis and {{have been found to be}} quite substantial (70 % of 1. 85 billion Dutch florins is produced by shore maritime activities nothing to do with flag). Greek shipping in 1980 had almost 80 % of tonnage (GRT) under Greek flag while in 1997 this fell to 38 %. This article will investigate the likely reasons for this phenomenon. Reasons for and against <b>flagging</b> <b>out</b> are not clear. The vessels go away (flag out) under a low freight market, but even when market improves vessels do not return! World statistics suggest that vessels are on average 50 : 50 in national maritime flag and foreign flags. Is this some kind of economic equilibrium? This article will investigate the following obscure facts for Greek shipping which can put in the form of questions: what really is the benefit of a national flag to a ship in terms of US dollars per day? What is the contribution to the national economy of a vessel under the national flag and what under foreign flags? Greeks have apparently "lost" from the Greek registry some 2700 vessels between 1978 and 1994 and some 1 / 2 of Greek seamen positions, too, while the average (per ship) crew has been steady at round 17 persons! It can be estimated that 2000 ships have been flagged out and that 700 have gone away due to scrapping, better productivity, economies of scale and automation. These phenomena are indeed worthy of investigation. This article will look mainly into the 1980 - 1997 situation and will propose a new maritime policy for Greeks (lacking capacity for support measures, like Europeans, to cope the same way with <b>flagging</b> <b>out).</b> Moreover, in 1995 and 1997 Greek shipping flagged out with 409 ships, 8. 82 million GRT and the Greek Shipowners Union proposed crew complements to be reduced in all ships from current levels to 5 - 7 Greeks and 1 trainee per ship. How can this be a workable proposition?...|$|E

40|$|Purpose – In the {{aftermath}} of the financial crisis, flagging behaviour exhibits different features than before. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to examine the current ship registration situation and particularly the impact of the 2008 financial crisis on flagging behaviour in light of national characteristics. Design/methodology/approach – The paper provides an overview of ship registration over the past 14 years and picks up new trends in the changing global economy. Moreover, a panel data analysis is applied to examine flagging in/out on a state by state basis. Findings – The clear-cut distinction between national registration and open registration has been diminishing and a convergence has been observed between the two flag types. The sovereignty of states creates a set of regulatory niches. The panel data results show that the flagging behaviour varies from nation to nation. A shipowner's view on choice of flag might be affected by national characteristics, and different continents and ship types tend to exert different influences on <b>flagging</b> <b>out.</b> Practical implications – It is an oversimplification to assume the downfall of regulation and the rise of liberal deregulation, as different nations have different roles to play in this globalised maritime arena. At some point, an equilibrium may be established whereby the ratio of <b>flagging</b> <b>out</b> would reach a stable plateau within each nation. Originality/value – This paper identifies the new features of ship registration after the financial crisis. Whereas flagging behaviour has been examined before from many different perspectives, this study approaches the issue from a macroeconomic viewpoint and further elucidates the impact of national states on the globalised phenomenon of the shipping world...|$|E
40|$|Flag {{selection}} {{is not just}} a crucial decision with regard to ship operation, but also {{plays an important role in}} national and international maritime policy. This study uses individual ship registration data to analyse flag selection behaviour, including <b>flagging</b> <b>out</b> decision using a binary choice model, and final flag choice by applying a nested logit model. Operators from traditional maritime countries are found to flag out high-quality vessels, whereas those from open-registry countries tend to flag out low-quality ones. Flag preferences are more sensitive to the registration fee than to the annual due; full-open flags are more elastic than quasi-open ones and substitution among flags within the same group is higher than across different groups. Port State Control, Flag State Control and safety records have opposite impacts on flag choice for ships from closed registry countries and those from open registers.

40|$|Abstract: It {{has become}} one {{important}} strategy for shipowners to improve their competitiveness by shifting their vessels registration to the countries with more comparative advantages, especially to the Flag of Convenience (FOC). Although the phenomena and causes of vessel <b>flagging</b> <b>out</b> have been discussed in literatures, differentiation {{on the characteristics of}} liner and bulk shipping markets with systematic and quantified analysis has not been found. In order to quantify the influence of related factors to the vessel registrations of Taiwan’s bulk shipping firms, this study develops a hierarchical analysis framework that consists of four different aspects of objectives being applied by AHP method. Operational performances of five selected public bulk-shipping firms are then analyzed using Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) method. Inputs and outputs are selected based on the concepts of production function, and the window analysis method is adopted to overcome the limitation of small sample sizes. Finally, the relationships of vessel registration and operational performance of these firms are further explored...|$|E

40|$|This study {{takes its}} {{departure}} in the difficulties {{to recruit and}} retain qualified senior seafarers in the Swedish shipping sector. The study focus is on seafarers' motivation at work for the specific shipping company (organizational commitment), and seafarers' motivation towards their occupation (occupational commitment), in times of <b>flagging</b> <b>out.</b> It was hypothesized that the youngest seafarers and the oldest may be most sensitive to foreign registration of ships. Statistical analyses were employed, using a survey material of 1, 309 Swedish seafarers randomly collected in 2010 from a national register of seafarers. The results of the analyses show that flagging-out imposes a significant decline in organizational commitment for all seafarers. This decline {{is related to the}} perception of the social composition of crew. In addition, the oldest seafarers (age 55 +) demonstrate diminished occupational commitment under a foreign flag. This decline is related to the degree of satisfaction with the social security structure. Occupational commitment among the youngest seafarers (age 19 - 30) is not affected by the nationality of flag. However, this type of commitment is decreasing by the time served on the same ship. This effect is partly related to a decline in satisfaction with the work content. In the concluding discussion, the findings are discussed in more details and recommendations are put forward...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} of Swedish {{seafarers}} was to investigate attitudes, perceptions and work experiences in the seafaring occupation. The study was undertaken partly in response {{to the needs of the}} shipping industry to recruit and retain qualified Seafarers, and partly because of political ambitions to extend people’s working lives in general. The two main areas of enquiry were seafarers’ motivations to work for the specific shipping company (organizational commitment) and seafarers’ motivations for working in their particular occupation (occupational commitment). The study is based on survey responses from a sample of 1, 309 seafarers taken from the Swedish Register of Seafarers. The study has shown that the seafaring occupation has strong influence on identity construction and that job satisfaction is generally high. Seafarers enjoy and are motivated by their job content. The study also, however, observed a number of challenges for Swedish shipping. It emerged that <b>flagging</b> <b>out</b> – registration of ships abroad – impairs commitment to the particular shipping company and that perceptions of the social composition on board are one underlying cause. Specifically for older seafarers (55 +), flagging-out also resulted in a distinct decline in commitment to the occupation in general. The cause in this case is the perceived inadequacy of the social security structure. Occupational commitment otherwise increases with age and seafarers in the oldest category appear to find the seafaring life unproblematic. In this respect, there is a clear difference compared to the youngest seafarers (aged 19 - 30), a large proportion of whom believe it is likely they will leave the occupation within the next few years. The first two chapters of the report present the general aims of the study along with those aspects of shipping and the situations of seafarers in 2009 - 2010 relevant to the aims. The third chapter presents a selection of earlier Swedish maritime research. Work and commitment are discussed, based on theory and international studies, in the fourth chapter, where the study aims are also defined in greater detail. Chapter five presents the approach to data collection and processing. Results are reported and analyzed thereafter in three separate results chapters. In the final chapter, the most important results are brought to the fore and discussed along with associated recommendations and suggestions for future research.
