Carpenters were hired {{and worked on}} the house day and night until it became a seven story mansion. She did not use an architect and added on to the building in a haphazard fashion, so the home contains numerous oddities such as doors and stairs that <b>go</b> <b>nowhere,</b> windows overlooking other rooms and stairs with odd-sized risers. Many accounts attribute these oddities to her belief in ghosts.|$|E
25|$|The Midnight Express {{had a short}} stay in World Class Championship Wrestling in Texas {{where they}} feuded mainly with The Fantastics (Bobby Fulton and Tommy Rogers). When {{opportunities}} in WCCW looked to <b>go</b> <b>nowhere</b> the Midnight Express signed with Jim Crockett Promotions (JCP) in 1985, giving them national exposure through JCP’s television shows that were broadcast on SuperStation TBS. Shortly after joining JCP, the Midnight Express reignited their feud with the Rock 'n' Roll Express from whom they won the NWA World Tag team titles in February 1986. Eaton and Condrey lost the titles back to the Rock 'n' Roll Express six months later. Besides feuding with the Rock 'n' Roll Express, Eaton and Condrey also had long-running feuds with The New Breed (Chris Champions and Sean Royal) as well as The Road Warriors (Animal and Hawk). The feud with the Road Warriors included a high profile Scaffold Match at Starrcade 1986, which the Midnight Express lost.|$|E
25|$|In 200, Xu Chu {{followed}} Cao Cao to the Battle of Guandu {{against the}} northern warlord Yuan Shao. During the battle, Xu Ta (徐他) and some conspirators plotted to assassinate Cao Cao. They feared Xu Chu so they {{waited until he}} went to rest before they entered Cao Cao's tent with swords hidden under their clothes. Xu Chu felt uneasy earlier on, so he had returned to Cao Cao's tent to protect his lord. When Xu Ta and the others showed up in Cao Cao's tent, they were very surprised to see Xu Chu there and could not contain their astonishment. Xu Chu sensed their intentions and killed them. After this incident, Cao Cao trusted Xu Chu even more and would <b>go</b> <b>nowhere</b> without Xu by his side. Xu Chu participated in the Battle of Ye in 204 and received {{the title of a}} Secondary Marquis (關內侯) as a reward for his efforts.|$|E

[...] It was written by Ciara, 2 Chainz, William Wesson, Patrizio Pigliapoco, Christopher Trujillo, K. Townsend, and S. Randolph. The song was described as [...] "bass-heavy banger" [...] by Rap-Up.

500|$|Pitchfork writer Stuart Berman {{stated that}} [...] "The Hungry Saws {{temperate}} approach {{feels like the}} work of a band who are grateful for a new lease on life, but not sure exactly what to do with it," [...] noting how [...] "the record turns increasingly more restrained, as it reconciles the band's well-established soul affinities with a more pastoral presentation" [...] while praising its [...] "beautifully rendered" [...] ballads. In his review for PopMatters, Michael Keefe opined that while [...] "all of The Hungry Saw finds Tindersticks trekking through fairly familiar territory...they find new diversions along the way." [...] Writing for Record Collector, Jake Kennedy said that [...] "The Hungry Saw marks a wonderful coming of age for Tindersticks...this is the sound of pure rejuvenation." [...] In a less complementary review, Shannon Zimmerman of Spin found that [...] "the first half of Tindersticks' latest is a can't-miss proposition" [...] but that [...] "the disc's second half descends into a morass of half-finished, melancholic curios that mostly <b>go</b> <b>nowhere</b> slowly." [...] Uncut critic Sam Richards was similarly unimpressed, offering that [...] "Tindersticks have returned refreshed, but some of the old dissolute glamour is gone." [...] This opinion was not shared by Tiny Mix Tapes, whose reviewing writer said that [...] "ultimately, it’s another Tindersticks record, and they’re still good after all these years. It’s not an incredibly remarkable record, but when a band is this consistent for this long, it’s hard to fault it." ...|$|E

[...] He mocked the protestors, saying they should have taken a high-speed train to Maltepe instead of walking in the hot summer weather.|$|E

2500|$|On April 30, 2008, Thailand, {{one of the}} world's biggest rice exporters, {{announced}} {{the creation of the}} Organisation of Rice Exporting Countries with the potential to develop into a price-fixing cartel for rice. It is a project to organize 21 rice exporting countries to create a homonymous organisation to control the price of rice. The group is mainly made up of Thailand, Vietnam, Cambodia, Laos and Myanmar. The organization attempts to serve the purpose of making a [...] "contribution to ensuring food stability, not just in an individual country but also to address food shortages in the region and the world". However, it is still questionable whether this organization will serve its role as an effective rice price fixing cartel, that is similar to OPEC's mechanism for managing petroleum. Economic analysts and traders said the proposal would <b>go</b> <b>nowhere</b> because of the inability of governments to cooperate with each other and control farmers' output. Moreover, countries that are involved expressed their concern, that this could only worsen the food security.|$|E
