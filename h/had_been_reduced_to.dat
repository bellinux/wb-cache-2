5|$|As the NAACP {{attracted}} {{more money and}} talent, and {{became the center of}} anti-Bookerite civil rights activity, Trotter and the NERL became increasingly marginalized on the left. Trotter would not have as prominent a role in the civil rights dialogue again. By 1921 the League <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>reduced</b> <b>to</b> a handful of Trotter supporters.|$|E

In 1909 the Chief Protector of Aborigines visited the Island, apparently to check on the activities of Japanese pearling crews in the area, and reported the existence of a small camp of Aborigines.|$|E

5|$|The {{expenditures}} that Caracalla {{made with}} the large bonuses he gave to soldiers prompted him to debase the coinage soon after his ascension. At the end of Severus' reign, and early into Caracalla's, the Roman denarius had an approximate silver purity of around 55%, {{but by the end}} of his reign the purity <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>reduced</b> <b>to</b> about 51%.|$|E
5|$|A {{mixture of}} 0.303-inch (7.7 mm) machine guns {{were used for}} close defence work, and could be fitted to {{pedestals}} at various points on the ship, primarily around the bridge and on the three searchlight platforms (one {{either side of the}} forward funnel, the third raised above the aft superstructure). At launch, Sydney carried fourteen Lewis machine guns and two Vickers machine guns, but by the start of World War II, the Lewis guns <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>reduced</b> <b>to</b> nine, and the Vickers guns removed completely.|$|E

The following year Cornwall Property sold {{it on to the}} Great Southern Group, the owners of Streatham Park Cemetery, South London Crematorium and a chain of funeral directors in central London.|$|E

5|$|After seeing minor {{action in}} the Battle of Hanover Court House on May 27, the 22nd {{remained}} in camp at Gaines' Mill for nearly a month as McClellan positioned his army for an assault on Richmond. The men of the 22nd could see the steeples of Richmond from their camp. By this time, the regiment <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>reduced</b> <b>to</b> roughly 750 men due to sickness {{over the course of}} the campaign and minor casualties in action.|$|E
5|$|After {{twenty minutes}} {{fighting}} both Victory and Temeraire, the Redoutable <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>reduced</b> <b>to</b> a floating wreck. Temeraire had also suffered heavily, damaged when Redoutables main mast fell onto her poop deck, and having {{had her own}} topmasts shot away. Informed that his ship {{was in danger of}} sinking, Lucas finally called for quarter to the Temeraire. Harvey sent a party across under the second lieutenant, John Wallace, to take charge of the ship.|$|E
5|$|Along {{with the}} three East Bosnian Shock Battalions, the Partisan General Staff of Bosnia-Herzegovina first {{attempted}} to cross the Bosna to follow the Partisan Supreme Headquarters and main force to western Bosnia, but instead retreated to Birač, where they joined forces with the Birač Detachment {{at the end of}} May. The Birač Partisan Detachment was the only Partisan or volunteer detachment in East Bosnia not to suffer a pro-Chetnik coup in March–May 1942. By June–July 1942, the Partisans in eastern Bosnia <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>reduced</b> <b>to</b> a strength of around 600 fighters.|$|E

The NK 6th Division <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>reduced</b> <b>to</b> 3,000 or 4,000 and had to replenish its ranks with South Korean conscripts from Andong. Fighting in the region continued {{for the rest of the}} month.|$|E
5|$|Blue whale hunting {{was banned}} in 1966 by the International Whaling Commission, and illegal whaling by the Soviet Union finally halted in the 1970s, {{by which time}} 330,000 blue whales had {{been caught in the}} Antarctic, 33,000 {{in the rest of the}} Southern Hemisphere, 8,200 in the North Pacific, and 7,000 in the North Atlantic. The largest {{original}} population, in the Antarctic, <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>reduced</b> <b>to</b> a mere 360 individuals, about 0.15% of their initial numbers.|$|E
5|$|By 1914, Hydra and Psara <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>reduced</b> <b>to</b> {{secondary}} duties: Hydra {{became a}} gunnery training ship while Psara {{was used to}} train engine-room personnel. During World War I, Greece belatedly entered the war {{on the side of}} the Triple Entente and the Hydra-class ships served as coastal defense. They were already obsolete and were decommissioned immediately after the war, although their hulks survived as naval training facilities and accommodation space for a decade. All three ships were broken up for scrap in 1929.|$|E

5|$|By 1975, {{peregrine}} falcons <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>reduced</b> <b>to</b> 324 pairs in North America, {{primarily as}} a result of DDT, a widely used pesticide. DDT lowered estrogen levels in female peregrines and inhibited the production of calcium, causing eggs to thin and break during incubation. Recovery efforts for the peregrine falcon have been remarkably successful: agricultural DDT was banned by the U.S. in 1972 and efforts to breed and train peregrine falcons in captivity to later release to the wild were effective. In 1999, the peregrine falcon was removed from the U.S. Endangered Species list.|$|E
5|$|By {{the time}} of the court-martial in August 1944, the charges against Robinson <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>reduced</b> <b>to</b> two counts of insubordination during questioning. Robinson was acquitted by an all-white panel of nine officers. The {{experiences}} Robinson was subjected to during the court proceedings would be remembered when he later joined MLB and was subjected to racist attacks. Although his former unit, the 761st Tank Battalion, became the first black tank unit to see combat in World War II, Robinson's court-martial proceedings prohibited him from being deployed overseas; thus, he never saw combat action.|$|E
5|$|By {{the time}} the Khmer Rouge {{initiated}} their dry-season offensive to capture the beleaguered Cambodian capital on 1 January 1975, the Republic was in chaos. The economy had been gutted, the transportation network <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>reduced</b> <b>to</b> air and water systems, the rice harvest had been reduced by one-quarter, and the supply of freshwater fish (the chief source of protein) had declined drastically. The cost of food was 20 times greater than pre-war levels and unemployment was not even measured anymore.|$|E

The South Sudbury run on the Central Mass was terminated on November 26, 1971. The Bedford round trip on the Lexington Branch ended after a major snowstorm on January 10, 1977, leaving the Fitchburg Line (with multiple daily round trips) as the only rail service at Cambridge station.|$|E
5|$|Hamburg {{had once}} been Germany's main seaport, the fourth largest in the world, but in 1943 {{virtually}} the entire city <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>reduced</b> <b>to</b> rubble by World War II bombing raids. By 1960, when they arrived, the Hamburg that had grown up from the ruins of WWII had established a reputation throughout Europe as a city of vice and criminal activity. In contrast to an economically depressed post-war Liverpool, Hamburg was a wealthy city.|$|E
5|$|However, Henry's army never progressed {{further than}} Leith; there the army could keep in {{physical}} {{contact with the}} supporting fleet. Henry took a personal interest in his convoys, at one point even verbally instructing that two Scottish fishermen fishing in the Firth of Forth were to be paid £2 for their (unspecified) assistance. However, Henry never besieged Edinburgh Castle where the Duke of Rothsay was ensconced. By now, Brown says, Henry's campaign <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>reduced</b> <b>to</b> a 'war of words.' By 29 August, the English army {{had returned to the}} other side of the border.|$|E
