30|$|It is {{important}} to follow {{the dynamics of the}} ring current particles and the electromagnetic field evolution in a fully self-consistent manner. In other words, the drift and bounce motions modify the particle pressure distribution, which produces an induction electric field and the magnetic field evolves according to Faraday’s law. The modified electromagnetic field then, of course, affects the particle motion. This self-consistent coupling between the particles and field is not incorporated in popular ring current models that have been used in the inner magnetosphere community. Substantial effort has been devoted recently to combine a conventional ring current model with a global MHD simulation to take <b>into</b> account <b>some</b> <b>sort</b> of self-consistent couplings (e.g., De Zeeuw et al. 2004; Pembroke et al. 2012; Glocer et al. 2013).

We believe that the fully self-consistent coupling may be incorporated only when both the particle and field dynamics are governed by the same physical principles.|$|R

In 1301, however, the new, aggressive Bulgarian emperor Theodore Svetoslav had several bloody encounters with the Byzantines. [...] He first defeated the former emperor Michael Asen II, who unsuccessfully tried to advance into Bulgaria with a Byzantine army in about 1302. As a consequence of his success, Theodore felt secure enough to take the offensive by 1303 and captured several fortresses in northeastern Thrace, including Mesembria (Nesebăr), Ankhialos (Pomorie), Sozopolis (Sozopol), and Agathopolis (Ahtopol) in the following year. The Byzantine counter-attack failed at the battle on the river Skafida near Sozopolis, where the co-emperor Michael IX Palaiologos was turned to flight. Nevertheless, the war continued, with Michael IX and Theodore Svetoslav taking turns pillaging each other's lands. In 1305 Theodore's uncle Aldimir seems to have entered <b>into</b> <b>some</b> <b>sort</b> of agreement with the Byzantines, and Theodore Svetoslav annexed his lands.
