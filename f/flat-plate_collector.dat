Typically polypropylene or EPDM rubber or silicone rubber is used as an absorber. Used for pool heating it can work quite well when the desired output temperature is near the ambient temperature (that is, when it is warm outside).

The comparative tests of solar <b>flat-plate</b> <b>collector</b> (SFPC) and heat pipe evacuated tube collector (HPETC) were done in this paper. The results show that during the low temperature difference range, the heat collecting efficiency of the <b>flat-plate</b> <b>collector</b> is about 2. 3 {{times higher than the}} efficiency of the heat pipe evacuated tube collector and the heat loss of the <b>flat-plate</b> <b>collector</b> is about 3. 2 times bigger than that of the heat pipe evacuated tube collector.

40|$|Abstract-This paper {{presents}} a new method for predicting the radiative transfer in an absorbing and isotropically scattering, non-gray plane-parallel atmosphere. The technique {{is based upon}} the F (“F-hat”) concept and was developed to determine the radiative transfer at short wavelengths for the transparent insulation material, monolithic silica aerogel. The angular dependence of solar transmittance of diffuse and ground reflected radiation is evaluated along with the “transmittance-absorptance product ” of a collector. The i- technique is also used to determine the IR transmission of the cover from which the overall loss coetlicient for a <b>flat-plate</b> <b>collector</b> constructed with aerogel filled covers is determined. The performance of a system using aerogel collectors is compared to systems using other types of high performing collectors. It is shown that, at least for the system investigated, the decrease in solar transmittance of monolithic silica aerogel is more than compensated by the decrease in thermal losses. 1.
