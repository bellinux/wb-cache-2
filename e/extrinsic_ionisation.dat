40|$|In {{this work}} metal - Microwave Plasma CVD diamond Schottky devices were studied. The current density vs. applied voltage reveals {{rectification}} ratios up to 10 (4) at +/- 2 V UÌ‡nder illumination an inversion and {{increase of the}} rectification is observed. The carrier density is 10 (15) cm(- 3) and the ideality factors near 1. 5. The dark current vs. temperature shows that below 150 K the bulk transport is controlled by a hopping process with a density of defects of 10 (16) cm(- 3). For higher temperatures an <b>extrinsic</b> <b>ionisation</b> with activation energy of 0. 3 eV takes place. The correlation with the polycrystalline nature of the samples is focused...|$|E
