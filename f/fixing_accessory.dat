40|$|MAGIC (Mammary Garment Ideal for Camouflage) is a bra {{conceived}} and designed for women showing a temporary/permanent breast asymmetry due to volume, shape or size differences after breast surgery (lumpectomy or mastectomy, congenital malformations correction), while having the breast reconstructed with skin expander procedures or Lipofilling, whom request no surgical field compression in postoperatory. Wound dressing bulking is another {{common cause of}} postoperative asymmetry. Patients face the impossibility to wear a common bra, often for months, thereof losing support of contralateral breast, showing visible chest deformity. Furthermore the new mamma’s dimensions are subject to continue modification until the reconstructive process in accomplished. MAGIC bra offer a practical help: it’s made {{by a pair of}} preshaped cups, each apt to contain a respective mamma without apply unwanted pressure, with an inner layer elastically deformable. Between the two layers there is a pocket in which a separate pad may be customized on the patient’s chest defect. The pad is therefore inserted into the pocket and fixed in the appropriate position with a <b>fixing</b> <b>accessory.</b> Inner pads can be combined to adapt to the breast variations during reconstructive process time. Wearing MAGIC provide support to the breast avoiding postural related diseases, with exterior aspect of a “normal” breast, camouflaging the temporary deformity without unwilling interference with the plastic surgeon work. The MAGIC solution is absolutely feasible: patient does not entail significant differences with a common bra; nor this innovative customized bra request high additional cost for its industrial production...|$|E

40|$|AbstractHuman Vγ 2 Vδ 2 + T cells {{recognize}} mycobacterial non-peptide antigens, such as isopentenyl pyrophosphate, {{and their}} synthetic analogs, such as monoethyl phosphate, through a TCR-dependent process. Here, {{we examine the}} presentation of these antigens. Vγ 2 Vδ 2 + T cells recognized secreted prenyl pyrophosphate antigens {{in the absence of}} other accessory cells but, under such conditions, required T cell-T cell contact. Recognition required neither the expression of classical MHC class I, MHC class II, or CD 1 a, CD 1 b, and CD 1 c molecules, nor MHC class I or class II peptide loading pathways. <b>Fixed</b> <b>accessory</b> cells also presented the prenyl pyrophosphate antigens to γδ T cells. Thus, in contrast with the presentation of conventional peptide antigens, protein antigens, and superantigens to αβ T cells, prenyl pyrophosphate antigens are presented to γδ T cells through a novel extracellular pathway that does not require antigen uptake, antigen processing, or MHC class I or class II expression. This pathway allows for the rapid recognition of bacteria by γδ T cells and suggests that γδ T cells {{play a role in the}} early response to bacterial infection...|$|R
40|$|We {{examined}} the pathways involved in presentation of native histoplasmln by adherent splenocytes (as {{a source of}} accessory cells) to JC 1, a Histoplasma capsulatum-reactlve murine T-cell line that is CD 4. JC 1 {{did not respond to}} accessory cells that had been fixed with paratormaldehyde and then exposed to histoplasmin but did proliferate to antigen-pulsed cells that were subsequently <b>fixed.</b> <b>Accessory</b> cells that were co-incubated with histoplasmin and sodium azide or 2 -deoxy-D-glucose failed to induce proliferation of JC 1. Moreover, accessory cells exposed to the lysosomotropic agents, chioroqulne and ammonium chloride, were unable to present antigen. Monensin also inhibited presentation of histoplasmin if added to accessory cells concomitant with antigen. In contrast, accessory cells that had been pulsed with antigen for 2 hr and then exposed to each Inhibitor for 2 hr stimulated proliferation of JC 1. The antigen-presenting capacity of accessory cells that had been pulsed with histoplasmln for 2 hr was diminished considerably by subsequent treatment with phospholipase A 2. Additional studies demonstrated that cerulenin, which depresses posttranslational lipid modifica-tion of proteins, abolished presentation of hlstoplasmin. The reactIvity of JC 1 was sharply reduced by anti-L 3 T 4 (CD 4) or by antilAb monoclonal antibody. The results not only indicate that presentation of histoplasmin requires active metabolic events within accessory cells, they also delineate the pathways Involved in handling this antigen. Key words: antigen presentation, antigen processing, T-ceIl activation, fungal antigen...|$|R

We show with examples that middle convolutions transform the Fuchsian systems with a <b>fixed</b> number of <b>accessory</b> parameters into fundamental systems whose spectral type is in a finite set and we give an explicit connection formula for solutions of Fuchsian differential equations without moduli.

40|$|The {{photochemical}} {{activities of}} various species of unicellular algae (Anacystis nidulans, Chlorella pyrenoidosa, and Porphyridium cruentum) were studied following chemical fixation. Fixation with formaldehyde and glutaraldehyde yielded cells which retained {{their ability to}} perform photosystem I and photosystem II reactions. The photochemical efficiencies of some fixed algae are as great as those of unfixed spinach chloroplasts. <b>Fixed</b> algae containing <b>accessory</b> pigments appear to be useful models for further studies of the light reactions of photosynthesis...|$|R
40|$|Studies of biosignature {{formation}} in photosynthetic microbial mat communities offer potentially useful insights {{with regards to}} both solar and extrasolar astrobiology. Biosignature {{formation in}} such systems results from the chemical transformation of photosynthetically <b>fixed</b> carbon by <b>accessory</b> microorganisms. This <b>fixed</b> carbon represents a source not only of reducing power, but also energy, to these organisms, so that chemical and energy budgets should be coupled. We tested this hypothesis by applying an energy balance model to predict the fate of photosynthetic productivity under dark, anoxic conditions. Fermentation of photosynthetically fixed carbon is taken {{to be the only}} source of energy available to cyanobacteria in the absence of light and oxygen, and nitrogen fixation is the principal energy demand. The alternate fate for fixed carbon is to build cyanobacterial biomass with Redfield C:N ratio. The model predicts that, under completely nitrogen-limited conditions, growth is optimized when 78 % of fixed carbon stores are directed into fermentative energy generation, with the remainder allocated to growth. These predictions were compared to measurements made on microbial mats that are known to be both nitrogen-limited and populated by actively nitrogen-fixing cyanobacteria. In these mats, under dark, anoxic conditions, 82 % of fixed carbon stores were diverted into fermentation. The close agreement between these independent approaches suggests that energy balance models may provide a quantitative means of predicting chemical partitioning within such systems - an important step towards understanding how biological productivity is ultimately partitioned into biosignature compounds...|$|R
