5|$|For {{clarity of}} presentation, the {{diagrams}} <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>article</b> <b>are</b> drawn with the components implemented in stripline format. This {{does not imply}} an industry preference, although planar transmission line formats (that is, formats where conductors consist of flat strips) are popular {{because they can be}} implemented using established printed circuit board manufacturing techniques. The structures shown can also be implemented using microstrip or buried stripline techniques (with suitable adjustments to dimensions) and can be adapted to coaxial cables, twin leads and waveguides, although some structures are more suitable for some implementations than others. The open wire implementations, for instance, of a number of structures are shown in the second column of figure 3 and open wire equivalents can be found for most other stripline structures. Planar transmission lines are also used in integrated circuit designs.|$|E
