40|$|Antonio Santucci's {{armillary sphere}} {{is one of}} the symbols of the wealth of the world {{cultural}} heritage: it is an elaborate representation of the geocentric universe as it was known at that time. Its exceptional dimensions (more than 3 meters high) make it an object which is considered as a complex structure, built with a technique of mixite made of nail-laminated timber. Constructed {{at the end of the}} 16 th century, this sphere has suffered wear and tear, mostly due to the combined effects of gravity loads over time and environmental agents (such as variations in the relative humidity of the air), as well as means of exposure of the object. The purpose of this research project is to study <b>delayed</b> <b>phenomena,</b> and it lies in the evaluation of the coupled mechano-sorptive effects likely to generate a critical state which would threaten the stability and the durability of the structure. This study highlights a problem which is already very real, even though irreversible consequences may not appear until the future. This work shows the importance of taking into account the variations in relative humidity undergone by the environment in which the sphere is exposed. These changes are at the origin of increasing deformations which could soon become prejudicial to the satisfactory conservation of the object...|$|E

40|$|Pathological {{laughter}} is an uncommon symptom usually caused by bilateral, diffuse cerebral lesions. It {{has rarely been}} reported in association with isolated cerebral lesions. Midbrain involvement causing pathological {{laughter is}} extremely unusual. We describe three patients who developed pathological laughter after midbrain and pontine-midbrain infarction. In two patients a small infarction in the left paramedian midbrain was detected, whereas the third one sustained a massive bilateral pontine infarction extending to the midbrain. Laughter heralded stroke by one day in one patient and occurred as a <b>delayed</b> <b>phenomenon</b> three months after stroke in another. Pathological laughter ceased {{within a few days}} in two patients and was still present at a two year follow-up in the patient with delayed-onset laughter. Pathological laughter can herald midbrain infarction or follow stroke either shortly after onset of symptoms or as a <b>delayed</b> <b>phenomenon.</b> Furthermore, small unilateral midbrain infarctions can cause this rare complication...|$|R

Some discrete event systems involving choice phenomena could be transformed, under some conditions, into switching max-plus linear systems modeled as automata.

The control problem we propose is optimal under just in time criterion when the switching variable is given on the study horizon. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — All post-silicon tasks – validation, diagnosis, delay {{testing and}} speed-binning – must {{be carried out}} by {{applying}} vectors to actual chips, and capturing and analyzing responses. Yet, vectors used must be generated and analyzed using pre-silicon models of the circuit. Three comprehensive industrial studies demonstrate that existing approaches for generating and analyzing such vectors are inadequate, and one major weakness is that existing delay models either do not capture process variations or do not capture advanced <b>delay</b> <b>phenomenon</b> that significantly affect delays, especially multiple input switching (also known as near-simultaneous transitions) at inputs of a gate, the charge on internal capacitance and Miller effect. In this paper, we address two related questions. (1) How do we extend advanced delay models that capture these <b>delay</b> <b>phenomena</b> to also capture process variations? (2) How do we use such a model, especially to select paths and generate or evaluate vectors for post silicon tasks? In particular, we present a general approach for extending any delay model (pin-to-pin and beyond) to ensure that all minimum and maximum delay values computed are guaranteed to bound the corresponding delay values in silicon. We present extensive experimental results to demonstrate that our models capture variability in a way that tightly bounds the actual delays, at a computational complexity that is practical even for generating vectors...|$|R

40|$|Several {{widely publicized}} incidents, in which {{passengers}} remained on an aircraft {{on the tarmac}} for up to 11 hours prompted the Department of Transportation (DOT) to issue a new rule designed to provide consumer protection to airline passengers. The rule mandates water/food/amenities for passengers on a plane for two hours, and an option to deplane after three hours. The rule also stipulates that airlines develop internal, auditable plans to meet the two/three hour clauses, and to report tarmac delays to the government for causal analysis. The underlying premise of the rule is that causal analysis (and incentives of fines) will enable elimination of the phenomenon. This approach assumes {{that the issue is}} not inherent to the design of the system-of-systems (e. g. span-of-control and availability of information), and that phenomenon that occur in-the-tails of the distribution are homogeneous and have finite causes. An analysis of the roles and responsibilities of the stakeholders involved in the Tarmac <b>Delay</b> <b>phenomenon</b> identified “gaps ” in the authority and availability of information to critical stakeholders that are inherent to the “design ” of the “system. ” Further, since the Tarmac <b>Delay</b> <b>phenomena</b> occurs in-the-tails of the distribution, it is not likely that the causal analysis will eliminate this phenomenon in a reasonable time-frame. An alternate approach is to provide a “safety-net ” tool to stop the gap. The requirements for the tool, described in this paper, perform real-time operations oversight by monitoring flights on the tarmac and identifying those flights that are forecast to exceed time thresholds (e. g. two/three hours). With access to the tool, stakeholders with the authority can take mitigation actions. A prototype, web-based, tool is described. The implications of this approach to rule making are discussed...|$|R
