25|$|The main {{disadvantage}} of this design {{is that when}} steering is applied the engine power {{is removed from the}} track. This makes the tank slow down, even if the brake is not applied. If the tank <b>is</b> <b>climbing,</b> or in soft terrain, forward motion may stop entirely. Another disadvantage is that the brakes slowed the vehicle as dissipated heat, which made this concept unsuitable for larger designs which required massive brakes to avoid overheating.|$|E
25|$|Some {{species of}} opossums have prehensile tails, {{although}} dangling {{by the tail}} is more common among juveniles. An opossum may also use its tail as a brace and a fifth limb when climbing. The tail is occasionally used as a grip to carry bunches of leaves or bedding materials to the nest. A mother will sometimes carry her young upon her back, where they will cling tightly even when she <b>is</b> <b>climbing</b> or running.|$|E

50|$|A third route, {{particularly}} difficult and rated TD+, {{runs along the}} south ridge and <b>is</b> very rarely <b>climbed.</b> It <b>was</b> <b>climbed</b> {{the first time on}} the 24 June 1969 by a Yugoslavian party (T. Sbrizaj, S. Semraj and B. Naglic).Other routes have <b>been</b> <b>climbed,</b> but very rarely repeated.|$|R
50|$|There {{are several}} routes {{typically}} used to climb Mount Mallory. It can <b>be</b> <b>climbed</b> from the East via Green Pass from the Meysan Lake Trailhead, {{or it can}} <b>be</b> <b>climbed</b> from the west via Arc Pass. The East slopes present the most obvious route, and the mountain <b>is</b> often <b>climbed</b> in conjunction with Mount Irvine.|$|R
25|$|The {{viviparous}} lizard inhabits rocky terrain, {{as does the}} black alpine salamander known locally as the Bergmandl, which can be seen after rain showers as one <b>is</b> <b>climbing.</b> Butterflies like Apollo, Thor's fritillary, gossamer-winged butterfly, geometer moth, ringlet and skipper may {{be seen on the}} west and south sides of the Zugspitze massif, especially in July and August. The woods around the Zugspitze are home to red deer, red squirrel, weasel, capercaillie, hazel grouse and black grouse. On the glaciers live glacier fleas (Desoria saltans) and water bears.|$|E
25|$|In Paris {{there is}} a full length marble statue by Pierre Julien, now in the Louvre, that was {{commissioned}} in 1781 and exhibited at the 1785 Salon. The writer is represented in an ample cloak, sitting in contemplation on a gnarled tree on which a vine with grapes <b>is</b> <b>climbing.</b> On his knee is the manuscript of the fable of the fox and the grapes, while at his feet a fox is seated on his hat with its paw on a leather-bound volume, looking up at him. Small scale porcelain models were made of this by the Sèvres pottery and in polychrome porcelain by the Frankenthal pottery. In the following century small models were made of the bronze statue by Etienne Marin Melingue, exhibited in Paris in 1840 and in London in 1881. In this the poet is leaning thoughtfully against a rock, hat in hand. Also in the Cour Napoléon of the Louvre is the 1857 standing stone statue by Jean-Louis Jaley.|$|E
25|$|One of the para-Alpine skiing {{techniques}} used by this class {{is called the}} three track method, and was developed {{as part of the}} American Training System. One of the first skills learned using this technique is how to walk with the ski so the skier can learn how to flex the ankle, knee and hip. This allows the skier to determine their centre of gravity. The skier is then taught how hop turn in order to understand arm and leg coordination while on skis. This technique is only used while stationary and is not a competition skill. The skier next learns how to fall down and get back up again. The next skill learned <b>is</b> <b>climbing</b> gentle terrain, followed by learning to go down a straight run and learning to stop. After this, the skier learns how to get on and off a ski lift. This is followed by learning how to traverse the fall line, which teaches the skier how to maintain the ski edge. Other skills are then taught including the Uphill Christie, beginning turns, parallel turns, short swings and moguls.|$|E

Monte Tanarello can <b>be</b> <b>climbed</b> by unmarked footpaths accessed from {{the path to the}} south and Cima Ventosa can <b>be</b> <b>climbed</b> to the north. It can also be accessed in winter with snowshoes.|$|R
50|$|The {{southern}} face <b>was</b> <b>climbed</b> for {{the first}} time in 1880 by Pierre Gaspard together with Henri Duhamel.

50|$|Tirsuli West <b>was</b> <b>climbed</b> for {{the first}} time in 2001, via the Southwest Ridge, by a team from the Nehru Institute of Mountaineering. They placed four camps on the route.

500|$|The game {{opens with}} an adventurous youth named Benjamin {{climbing}} the Hill of Destiny. While exploring, his village is destroyed in an earthquake. As Benjamin <b>is</b> <b>climbing</b> the Hill, he meets a mysterious {{old man who}} charges Benjamin with fulfilling the knight's prophecy. Although initially in disbelief, Benjamin accepts the role and the Old Man shows him the Focus Tower (supposedly {{the center of the}} World). [...] After defeating a monster {{at the top of the}} hill, Benjamin follows the Old Man to the Level Forest, where he is tasked with recovering the Crystal of Earth. [...] Proceeding to Foresta, he meets with an axe-wielding girl named Kaeli, who agrees to help Benjamin if he can help her rid the Level Forest of monsters. [...] Kaeli is ambushed and poisoned in the process, and her mother informs Benjamin of the Elixir and where it can be found. [...] Benjamin's search for Elixir to heal Kaeli brings him to Bone Dungeon, where he's aided by a treasure hunter named Tristam in succeeding dual purposes: not only does Benjamin get Elixir from Tristam to heal Kaeli, but he defeats one of the four Vile Evils, Flamerous Rex, to free the Crystal of Earth and in turn restore life to the dying village of Foresta. [...] Tristam leaves and Benjamin heals Kaeli.|$|E
2500|$|The {{station is}} about a mile {{southeast}} of Crewkerne on the A356 road, which crosses the platform and railway on a bridge. The entrance and platform are {{on the north side}} of the line, which <b>is</b> <b>climbing</b> westwards at 1 in 80 (1.25%) to the [...] Crewkerne Tunnel. The main building was designed by Sir William Tite and has been designated as a Grade II listed building. North of the station is a builder’s yard which is on the site of the old railway goods yard. The office (converted to a cafe in late-2013) by the main road was used to operate the weighbridge, and the old goods shed can be seen near the railway line. Between this and the platform is the disused signal box.|$|E
2500|$|And yet, [...] "synchronization", in {{the usual}} sense of the word, between the rate of fire of a machine gun (firing as such, in a fully {{automatic}} manner) and the revolutions per minute of a spinning aircraft propeller is also a conceptual impossibility. A machine gun normally fires at a constant number of rounds a minute, and while this may be boosted by (for instance) strengthening and increasing the tension on a return spring, or redirecting the gasses produced by each firing, it cannot be varied at will while the gun is operating. The propeller of an aircraft, on the other hand, turns at widely differing rates of revolution per minute, depending on the throttle setting, and whether the aircraft <b>is</b> <b>climbing,</b> flying level, or diving. Even if it were feasible to pick a particular point on an aircraft engine's tachometer at which a machine gun's cyclic rate would permit it to fire through the propeller – this would be very limiting.|$|E
50|$|Teram Kangri II (7,407 m) <b>was</b> <b>climbed</b> in 1978 by an Indian Army {{expedition}} led by Colonel Narendra Kumar in {{the first}} move by India to lay claim to the Siachen Glacier area. Teram Kangri I has <b>been</b> <b>climbed</b> once since, in 1992. The expedition approached through Indian territory.|$|R
5000|$|There {{has been}} no fully {{accepted}} record of the mountain having <b>been</b> <b>climbed</b> since 1935 and this would mean it has never <b>been</b> <b>climbed</b> from the Nepalese side. This is perhaps remarkable because from Everest Base Camp, along with Pumori and Khumbutse (which have both <b>been</b> <b>climbed),</b> the mountain <b>is</b> very noticeable being less than 5 km away. An attempt on Lingtren was made in 2013. In Hoger dan de Dhaulagiri, [...] claimed he had climbed Lingtren in 1993 saying he started in Nepal and then crossed into Tibet. This claim has, however, been discounted.|$|R
50|$|The {{mountain}} may <b>be</b> <b>climbed</b> from Barrisdale to {{the northeast}} or Inverie to the south. From Barrisdale the mountain may <b>be</b> <b>climbed</b> as part of circuit of Coire Dhorrcaill; this route involves {{a certain amount of}} scrambling, particularly on the section immediately north of the subsidiary summit of Stob a Chearcaill.|$|R
2500|$|Prints {{became very}} popular in Europe {{from the middle of}} the fifteenth century, and because of their compact nature, were very {{suitable}} for erotic depictions that did not need to be permanently on display. [...] Nudity and the revival of classical subjects were associated from very early on in history of the print, and many prints of subjects from mythological subjects were clearly in part an excuse for erotic material; the engravings of Giovanni Battista Palumba in particular. [...] An earthier eroticism is seen in a printing plate of 1475-1500 for an Allegory of Copulation where a young couple are having sex, with the woman's legs high in the air, at one end of a bench, while at the other end a huge penis, with legs and wings and a bell tied around the bottom of the glans, <b>is</b> <b>climbing</b> onto the bench. [...] Although the plate has been used until worn out, then re-engraved and heavily used again, none of the contemporary impressions printed, which probably ran into the hundreds, have survived.|$|E

2500|$|Aerial {{reconnaissance}} {{was carried}} out by both sides. Aerial photographs enabled a new partly contoured map on the 1/40,000 scale to be printed before the Second Battle of Gaza. However, each side was keen to monitor the others' preparations and the air became disputed territory. Newly arrived German aircraft attacked EEF reconnaissance aircraft during which several duels were fought, none being decisive. On 6 April five German aircraft approaching Rafa were intercepted by two AFC Martinsyde aircraft, one of which was forced to land and was destroyed on the ground, while the other went for reinforcements. Three Martinsydes arrived to attack the German formation. Aerial bombing was also strenuously continued by both sides, and while this aerial fight was taking place, hostile aircraft bombed Bir el Mazar. On 7 April a joint raid by four Australian aircraft, with several from No. 14 Squadron, bombed Gaza and the Ramleh aerodrome, hitting two hangars. At El Arish hospital, Dr. Duguid described the strong moon light on 8 April 1917, [...] "... now it <b>is</b> <b>climbing</b> the heavens. 10.30pm. It is as clear as day, and the shadow thrown on the sand is very definite. I hear we are expecting an air raid soon. The regiments are digging funk holes everywhere." ...|$|E

60|$|If a mob <b>is</b> <b>climbing</b> {{the stairs}} thirsting for your blood, {{you do not}} want to stand upright with your arms {{stretched}} out, a good eighteen inches from the door, while you go over at some length the varied incidents leading up to the annoyance. If your desire were to act naturally you would push against that door for all you were worth, and yell for somebody to bring you a chest of drawers and a bedstead, and things like that, to pile up against it. If you were a king, and were giving a party, you would not want your guests to fix you up at the other end of the room and leave you there, with nobody to talk to but your own wife, while they turned their backs upon you, and had a long and complicated dance all to themselves. You would want to be in it; you would want to let them know that you were king.|$|E
60|$|There were hollows and bowers at {{the extreme}} end of that leafy garden, in which the laurels and other immortal shrubs showed against {{sapphire}} sky and silver moon, even in that midwinter, warm colours as of the south. The green gaiety of the waving laurels, the rich purple indigo of the night, the moon like a monstrous crystal, make an almost irresponsible romantic picture; and among the top branches of the garden trees a strange figure <b>is</b> <b>climbing,</b> who looks not so much romantic as impossible. He sparkles from head to heel, as if clad in ten million moons; the real moon catches him at every movement and sets a new inch of him on fire. But he swings, flashing and successful, from the short tree in this garden to the tall, rambling tree in the other, and only stops there because a shade has slid under the smaller tree and has unmistakably called up to him.|$|E
