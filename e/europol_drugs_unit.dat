25|$|The European Union Agency for Law Enforcement Cooperation (Europol), {{formerly}} known as the European Police Office (Europol) and the <b>Europol</b> <b>Drugs</b> <b>Unit</b> (EDU), is the law enforcement agency of the European Union (EU) formed in 1998 to handle criminal intelligence and combat serious international organised crime and terrorism through cooperation between competent authorities of EU Member States.|$|E
2500|$|The {{idea of the}} Luxembourg Summit {{was further}} {{elaborated}} at the European Council in Maastricht on 9–10 December 1991, a meeting to draft the Maastricht Treaty. The European Council agreed to create [...] "a European police office (Europol) the initial function {{of which would be}} to organize exchange of information on narcotic drugs". The Council likewise instructed TREVI ministers to take measures in setting up the office. On 7 February 1992, Europol was enshrined with more substance in Article K.1, section 9, as the Maastricht Treaty was signed: Member States shall regard the following areas as matters of common interest: [...] police cooperation for the purposes of preventing and combatting terrorism, unlawful drug trafficking and other serious forms of international crime, including if necessary certain aspects of customs cooperation, in connection with the organization of a Union-wide system for exchanging information within a European Police Office (Europol).Europol was first de facto organised provisionally in 1993 as the <b>Europol</b> <b>Drugs</b> <b>Unit</b> (EDU) in Strasbourg at the same site as the Schengen Information System was hosted. The small initial group started operations there in January 1994 under the leadership of Jürgen Storbeck and with a mandate to assist national police forces in criminal investigations. The competition for the permanent site of Europol during the period was between The Hague, Rome and Strasbourg—the European Council decided on 29 October 1993 that Europol should be established in The Hague. A former Catholic boys school built in 1910 at Raamweg 47 was chosen as the precise location. The house was used in World War II by police and intelligence agencies and after the War manned by the Dutch State Intelligence Service until Europol relocated there later in 1994.|$|E
50|$|Once the Maastricht Treaty {{had come}} into effect, the slow process of {{negotiating}} and ratifying a Europol Convention began. In the meantime, the <b>Europol</b> <b>Drugs</b> <b>Unit</b> (EDU) had its powers extended twice, in March 1995 and again in December 1996 to include a range of trafficking offences in its remit. During this period, information amongst officers could only be exchanged bilaterally, with a central database to be established once the Europol Convention was ratified. The Europol Convention finally came into effect in October 1998 after ratification by all 15 EU national parliaments though some outstanding legal issues (primarily data protection supervision and judicial supervision) ensured it could not formally take up duties until July 1999.|$|E
5000|$|Delays in ratifying the Maastricht Treaty led to TREVI ministers agreeing a [...] "Ministerial Agreement on the <b>Europol</b> <b>Drugs</b> Unit" [...] in June 1993. This {{intergovernmental}} agreement, {{outside of}} EU law, {{led to the}} establishment of a small team headed by Jürgen Storbeck, a senior German police officer who initially operated from some temporary cabins in a Strasbourg suburb (shared with personnel of the Schengen Information System) while more permanent arrangements were made.|$|R

5000|$|The {{establishment}} of Europol was agreed {{to in the}} 1992 Maastricht Treaty, officially known as the Treaty on European Union (TEU) that came into effect in November 1993. The agency started limited operations on 3 January 1994, as the <b>Europol</b> <b>Drugs</b> <b>Unit</b> (EDU). The Europol Convention was signed on 26 July 1995, and came into force in October 1998 after being ratified by all the member states. Europol commenced its full activities on 1 July 1999. Europol came under the EU's competence with the Lisbon Treaty, and the Convention {{was replaced by a}} Council Decision in 2009. [...] It was reformed as a full EU agency on 1 January 2010. This gave Europol increased powers to collect criminal information and European Parliament more control over Europol activities and budget.|$|E

Combining data from the Law Enforcement Management and Administrative Statistics (LEMAS) Survey, the 2000 Census, and the Uniform Crime Report, we use both bivariate and multivariate methods to conduct the analysis. The findings indicate that county-level agencies, those with other formalized drug control efforts, high levels of violent crime, high degrees of task specialization and formalization, and high proportions of the resident population accounted for by renters {{were more likely to}} operate <b>drug</b> <b>units,</b> participate in multi-agency drug task forces, and allocate more officers per capita to these efforts...|$|R

40|$|Question Answering (QA) can {{be viewed}} as a {{particular}} form of Information Retrieval (IR), in which the amount of information to return is the minimum required to satisfy the user needs expressed by a specific question such as: "Where is the <b>Europol</b> <b>Drugs</b> Unit?” 1. A Passage Retrieval (PR) system is an IR system which, given a list of keywords (e. g. : "Electricity," "Motor", etc [...] ) or a question such as the previous one, returns fragments of texts (passages) that are relevant to the user needs. The Cross-Language Evaluation Forum 2 (CLEF), organises competitions for the assessment of multilingual information retrieval systems. In CLEF- 2009 edition, due to the growing interest in natural language processing of legal texts from both the university and the business sector, tracks such as ResPubliQA 3 and IP 4 have been organised. We have participated in both tracks in the framework of the collaboration between the Natural Language Engineering Lab. of the Universidad Politécnica de Valencia (UPV) and the Maat Knowledge enterprise.
