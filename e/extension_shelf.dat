The protein and fat content of wheat bread significantly increased but carbohydrate levels decreased significantly as enrichment with Warankashi increased. The amino acid profile of the wheat bread increased with increasing enrichment. The incorporation of Warankashi into wheat flour affected the rheological and textural properties of wheat flour; the rate of water absorption of the wheat flour decreased as Warankashi incorporation levels increased. Also, the dough stability time of the enriched flours was lesser than that of the wheat flour. The 3 % enrichment level had the highest dough consistency (520 BU). The extensibility of 1 % and 3 % wara bread dough were the same while that of wheat flour bread and 5 % Warankashi were the same. The 3 % wara bread dough had the highest resistance to <b>extension.</b> <b>Shelf</b> life of the bread remained unaffected by Warankashi incorporation but the rate of bacteria and fungi (yeast and mould) growth decreased significantly (P < 0. 05) as enrichment levels increased.

Consequently, certain lactic acid bacteria (LAB), with demonstrated antimicrobial properties commonly associated with foods, are being assayed to increase the safety and/or prolong the shelf life of foods. The antagonistic properties of LAB derive from competition for nutrients and the production of one or more antimicrobial active metabolites such as organic acids (lactic and acetic), hydrogen peroxide, and antimicrobial peptides (bacteriocins). Nowadays the use of LAB bacteriocins is considered an integral part of hurdle technology. Their combined use allows most pathogenic and spoilage bacteria to be controlled and also extend their inhibitory activity spectrum to such intrinsically resistant organisms as the Gram-negative bacteria...|$|R

However, Enterococcus faecium and Enterococcus faecalis are indicators of faecal contamination and are also implicated in nosocomial diseases.

Thus, the use of enterococci in the food industry is becoming controversial. However, enterococci are also involved in the fermentation of many foods (milk, vegetables, meats or fish) and are able to produce various antimicrobial molecules (e. g. lactic acid, bacteriocins or hydrogen peroxide) that make them indispensable in the food industry. Their use as probiotic must therefore be carefully characterized in order to prove their safety.

40|$|Mushrooms are {{consider}} as a nutritional and health beneficial product. Three most cultivated mushrooms worldwide are Agaricus bisporus, Lentinus edodes and Pleurotus spp. Mushrooms are highly perishable. They tend to lose quality after harvest, {{mainly because of}} their high respiration rate {{and the fact that}} they have no barrier to protect them from water loss. Mushrooms’ shelf-life is limited to a few days under normal refrigeration conditions, which is a constraint on the distribution and marketing of fresh product, making <b>extension</b> of mushroom’s <b>shelf</b> life a constant quest. Modified atmosphere packaging provides an affordable packaging system that partly avoids enzymatic browning, fermentation and other biochemical processes by maintaining a controlled gas atmosphere. However, modified atmosphere packaging conditions should be carefully designed. Inappropriate modified atmosphere conditions may be ineffective or even shorten the shelf life of the product due to damage of tissues. Preservation techniques and specially use of MAP, specifically for Agaricus, Lentinus edodes and Pleurotus, is reviewed...|$|R

Such was the case on the Moon, by the way... We from the outset said that this expedition was part of the big work being carried out under the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea, within the international authority where Russia's claim to submerged ridges which we believe to be an <b>extension</b> of our <b>shelf</b> is being considered. We know that this has to be proved. The ground samples that were taken will serve the work to prepare that evidence." ...|$|R
