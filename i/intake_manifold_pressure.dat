5|$|The E Series 3 was {{announced}} in September 2010. It carried the same motor and drivetrain as before, and only {{minor changes to the}} exterior. In this series HSV focused on changes to the interior of the car as well as major upgrades to the computer systems and a new electronic interface called the HSV Enhanced Driver Interface. External changes included the shock wave exhaust tips and grilles and new HID Xenon adaptive projector headlamps. The control panel changes included a new 'Oracle Dash' with upgraded trip computer, tire pressure monitors and fuel statistics; the center console was reworked, introducing the Holden touchscreen IQ system and the HSV EDI performance data logging system (similar to the Nissan GT-R), which displays real-time information on engine speed, brakes, gear shifts, g-forces on the car, steering angle, fuel economy, stability control, Magnetic Ride Control suspension, car dynamics, Bi-Modal Exhaust, battery voltage, oil pressure, power, torque, elevation, exhaust pressure, <b>intake</b> <b>manifold</b> <b>pressure</b> and air intake temp. The system includes preloaded race track locations, stop watches and track maps, satellite navigation, digital radio, Bluetooth, optional DVD player and ability to download data onto a PC using the Motech i2 software. The E Series 3 introduced (SBZA) Side Blind Zone Alert which uses ultrasonic sensors to alert drivers of traffic obstructions in blind spots. Using the HSV EDI the driver can customize operation of the car by for example turning off stability control and controlling the Bi-Modal Exhaust. The E Series 3 offered the option of HSV LPI (Liquid Propane Injection), an LPG Autogas system which allows the use of liquid propane as an alternative fuel. The LPI is controlled by the car's ECU and seamlessly changes from petrol to LPG when the engine has reached optimum temperature (when maximum engine power is required, the system automatically switches back to petrol).|$|E
25|$|In {{automotive}} applications, 'boost' {{refers to}} the amount by which <b>intake</b> <b>manifold</b> <b>pressure</b> exceeds atmospheric pressure. This {{is representative of the}} extra air pressure that is achieved over what would be achieved without the forced induction. The level of boost may be shown on a pressure gauge, usually in bar, psi or possibly kPa.|$|E
25|$|Modern EMSs read in {{data from}} various sensors about the {{crankshaft}} position, intake manifold temperature, <b>intake</b> <b>manifold</b> <b>pressure</b> (or intake air volume), throttle position, fuel mixture via the oxygen sensor, detonation via a knock sensor, and {{exhaust gas temperature}} sensors. The EMS then uses the collected data to precisely determine how much fuel to deliver and when and how far to advance the ignition timing. With electronic ignition systems, individual cylinders can have their own individual timing so that timing can be as aggressive as possible per cylinder without fuel detonation. As a result, sophisticated electronic ignition systems can be both more fuel efficient, and produce better performance over their counterparts.|$|E
40|$|Copyright c ○ 2004 SAE International Mean value {{cylinder}} {{air charge}} (CAC) estimation models for control and diagnosis are investigated on turbocharged SI-engines. Two topics are studied; Firstly CAC changes due to fuel enrichment and secondly CAC sensitivity to exhaust <b>manifold</b> <b>pressure</b> changes. The {{objective is to}} find a CAC model suitable for control and diagnosis. Measurements show that CAC models based on volumetric efficiency gives up to 10 % error during fuel enrichment. The error is caused by the cooling effect that the fuel has as it evaporates and thus increases the charge density. To better describe the CAC during fuel enrichment a simple one parameter model is proposed which reduces the CAC estimation error on experimental data from 10 % to 3 %. With active wastegate control, the pressure changes in the exhaust manifold influences the CAC. The magnitude of this influence is investigated using sensitivity analysis on an exhaust <b>manifold</b> <b>pressure</b> dependent CACmodel. From the sensitivity analysis it can be concluded, that the CAC is most sensitive to exhaust <b>manifold</b> <b>pressure</b> changes for low <b>intake</b> <b>manifold</b> <b>pressures</b> (part load). Without taking the exhaust <b>manifold</b> <b>pressure</b> into account the CAC error is approximately 5 % when the wastegate is opened at part load. The exhaust <b>manifold</b> <b>pressure</b> dependent CAC model is then augmented with the charge cooling model and the total model gives precise agreement on experimental data. The resulting model is thus highly suitable for CAC estimation for control and diagnosis of turbocharged SI-engines...|$|R

25|$|In {{petrol engine}} {{turbocharger}} applications, boost pressure {{is limited to}} keep the entire engine system, including the turbocharger, inside its thermal and mechanical design operating range. Over-boosting an engine frequently causes damage to the engine {{in a variety of}} ways including pre-ignition, overheating, and over-stressing the engine's internal hardware. For example, to avoid engine knocking (also known as detonation) and the related physical damage to the engine, the <b>intake</b> <b>manifold</b> <b>pressure</b> must not get too high, thus the pressure at the intake manifold of the engine must be controlled by some means. Opening the wastegate allows the excess energy destined for the turbine to bypass it and pass directly to the exhaust pipe, thus reducing boost pressure. The wastegate can be either controlled manually (frequently seen in aircraft) or by an actuator (in automotive applications, it is often controlled by the engine control unit).|$|E

40|$|A {{research}} project {{was carried out}} in which a DAF engine was equipped with a two-stage turbocharging system. Objectives were to investigate an engine concept with very high BMEP (25 - 30 bars), maintaining acceptable emissions and fuel consumption, while concentrating on the control system and transient performance. Two-stage turbocharging has several advantages compared with single stage turbocharging. Two-stage turbocharging enables high specific power levels across a broad speed range. In addition transient behaviour of a two-stage turbocharged engine is improved because of the combination of a small (and fast) High Pressure turbocharger and a larger Low Pressure turbocharger. Especially at high <b>intake</b> <b>manifold</b> <b>pressures</b> (pressure ratio > 3. 5) the overall efficiency of two-stage turbocharging is better than with single state turbocharging. The two-stage system on the engine that was tested consists of two parallel Low Pressure turbochargers, a High Pressure turbocharger with controlled by-pass valve, and a cooler behind the High Pressure compressor. With this configuration BSFC was optimised, while maintaining EURO III emission levels. Also transient tests were carried out, whereby the transient behaviour was compared with that of the current DAF engine. In the development of the control algorithms for the by-pass valve, simulatons were used with a complete engine model built in Matrixx. These simulations were also used to estimate transient performance of the engine concept, prior to the test program. In addition the engine model was used to analyse the measured data, and to understand several transient effects that play a role. The results show that two-stage turbocharging is an effective way to increase specific power output while maintaining acceptable fuel consumption and transient performance...|$|R

50|$|When the {{throttle}} is opened (in a car, the accelerator pedal is depressed), ambient air {{is free to}} fill the <b>intake</b> <b>manifold,</b> increasing the <b>pressure</b> (filling the vacuum). A carburetor or fuel injection system adds fuel to the airflow in the correct proportion, providing energy to the engine. When {{the throttle}} is opened all the way, the engine's air induction system is exposed to full atmospheric pressure, and maximum airflow through the engine is achieved.

50|$|Sequential turbos {{refer to}} a set-up in which the motor uses one {{turbocharger}} for lower engine speeds, and a second or both turbochargers at higher engine speeds. Typically, larger high-flow turbochargers are not as efficient at low RPM, resulting in lower <b>intake</b> <b>manifold</b> <b>pressures</b> under these conditions. On the other hand, smaller turbos spool up quickly at low RPM but cannot supply enough air at higher engine speed. During low to mid engine speeds, when available spent exhaust energy is minimal, only one relatively small turbocharger (called the primary turbocharger) is active. During this period, all of the engine's exhaust energy is directed to the primary turbocharger only, providing the small turbo's benefits of a lower boost threshold, minimal turbo lag, and increased power output at low engine speeds. As RPM increases, the secondary turbocharger is partially activated in order to pre-spool prior to its full utilization. Once a preset engine speed or boost pressure is attained, valves controlling compressor and turbine flow through the secondary turbocharger are opened completely. (The primary turbocharger is deactivated {{at this point in}} some applications.) In this way a full twin-turbocharger setup provides the benefits associated with a large turbo, including maximum power output, without the disadvantage of increased turbo lag.|$|R

50|$|In a {{compression}} release engine braking {{system for a}} turbocharged internal combustion engine, excessive stress associated with opening the exhaust valves of the engine near top dead center of engine compression strokes when the engine is turning at high speed is prevented by reducing the <b>intake</b> <b>manifold</b> <b>pressure</b> from what it otherwise would be at that high speed.

Peak torque can be achieved by about 2000 rpm. Unlike the basic illustration, most modern Roots-type superchargers incorporate three-lobe or four-lobe rotors; this allows the lobes to have a slight twist along the rotor axes, which in turn reduces pulsing in the input and output (this is impractical with two lobes, as even a slight twist could open up a free path through the supercharger at certain angles).|$|E

5000|$|A vital {{component}} of all diesel engines is a mechanical or electronic governor which regulates the idling speed and maximum {{speed of the}} engine by controlling the rate of fuel delivery. Unlike Otto-cycle engines, incoming air is not throttled and a diesel engine without a governor cannot have a stable idling speed and can easily overspeed, resulting in its destruction. Mechanically governed fuel injection systems are driven by the engine's gear train. [...] These systems {{use a combination of}} springs and weights to control fuel delivery relative to both load and speed. [...] Modern electronically controlled diesel engines control fuel delivery by use of an electronic control module (ECM) or electronic control unit (ECU). The ECM/ECU receives an engine speed signal, as well as other operating parameters such as <b>intake</b> <b>manifold</b> <b>pressure</b> and fuel temperature, from a sensor and controls the amount of fuel and start of injection timing through actuators to maximise power and efficiency and minimise emissions. Controlling the timing of the start of injection of fuel into the cylinder is a key to minimizing emissions, and maximizing fuel economy (efficiency), of the engine. The timing is measured in degrees of crank angle of the piston before top dead centre. For example, if the ECM/ECU initiates fuel injection when the piston is 10° before TDC, the start of injection, or timing, is said to be 10° BTDC. Optimal timing will depend on the engine design as well as its speed and load, and is usually 4° BTDC in 1,350-6,000 HP, net, [...] "medium speed" [...] locomotive, marine and stationary diesel engines.|$|E
