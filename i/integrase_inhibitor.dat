The enzyme contains a highly conserved region called the catalytic core, which {{is essential for}} binding to the virally encoded DNA. <b>Integrase</b> <b>inhibitors</b> block {{the ability of the}} catalytic core to form covalent bonds with the phosphodiester backbone of DNA.

40|$|AbstractPhenotypic {{resistance}} {{analysis is}} an indispensable method for determination of HIV- 1 resistance and cross-resistance to novel drug compounds. Since <b>integrase</b> <b>inhibitors</b> are essential components of recent antiretroviral combination therapies, phenotypic resistance data, {{in conjunction with}} the corresponding genotypes, are needed for improving rules-based and data-driven tools for resistance prediction, such as HIV-Grade and geno 2 pheno[integrase]. For generation of phenotypic resistance data to recent <b>integrase</b> <b>inhibitors,</b> a recombinant phenotypic integrase susceptibility assay was established. For validation purposes, the phenotypic resistance to raltegravir, elvitegravir and dolutegravir of nine subtype-B virus strains, isolated from integrase inhibitor-naïve and raltegravir-treated patients was determined. Genotypic resistance analysis identified four virus strains harbouring RAL resistance-associated mutations. Phenotypic resistance analysis was performed as follows. The HIV- 1 integrase genes were cloned into a modified pNL 4 - 3 vector and transfected into 293 T cells for the generation of recombinant virus. The integrase-inhibitor susceptibility of the recombinant viruses was determined via an indicator cell line. While raltegravir resistance profiles presented a high cross-resistance to elvitegravir, dolutegravir maintained in-vitro activity in spite of the Y 143 R and N 155 H mutations, confirming the strong activity of dolutegravir against raltegravir-resistant viruses. Solely a Q 148 H+G 140 S variant presented reduced susceptibility to dolutegravir. In conclusion, our phenotypic susceptibility assay permits resistance analysis of the integrase gene of patient-derived viruses for <b>integrase</b> <b>inhibitors</b> by replication-competent recombinants. Thus, this assay can be used to analyze phenotypic drug resistance of <b>integrase</b> <b>inhibitors</b> in vitro. It provides the possibility to determine the impact of newly appearing mutational patterns to drug resistance of recent <b>integrase</b> <b>inhibitors...</b>|$|R

Distinct differences were observed in the energetics of binding between the studied classes of inhibitors that also correlated with drug resistant patterns. Quantitative-property–activity-relationships correlated experimental IC 50 values to the binding energy and the logarithm of the partition coefficient between n-octanol and water (clog P).

40|$|Chemotherapy of HIV-I infection/AIDS {{currently}} employs inhibitors of two {{products of}} the viral pol gene, the reverse transcriptase acid protease enzymes. However, a third product of the pol gene is essential for retroviral multiplication, the integrase. As no cellular homologue of HIV integrase has been described, potential inhibitors could be relatively nontoxic. Development of HIV- 1 <b>integrase</b> <b>inhibitors</b> could have favorable implication for combination therapy, including potential synergy with currently available inhibitors, as well as prevention of the chronic carrier state {{and the emergence of}} resistant mutants. Although several classes of putative <b>integrase</b> <b>inhibitors</b> that been described, still no clinically useful anti-integration drugs are available. It is the structural and functional complexity of the integration process together with the limitations of the available in vitro assays that has made it problematic to develop inhibitors of the HIV integrase. In this review we summarize current knowledge concerning the biology of this enzyme and of the integration process, and discuss major classes representatives of <b>integrase</b> <b>inhibitors</b> considering the obstacles to the development of true anti-integrase drugs...|$|R
40|$|Background The <b>integrase</b> <b>inhibitors,</b> {{raltegravir}} and dolutegravir, are nucleoside {{reverse transcriptase}} inhibitor-sparing agents {{which may be}} used as part of first-line antiretroviral therapy for HIV. These drugs inhibit creatinine secretion through organic cation transporters, thus elevating serum creatinine without affecting glomerular filtration. We sought to determine whether subtle signs of nephrotoxicity could be observed in mice administered a two-week regimen of high-dose <b>integrase</b> <b>inhibitors.</b> Methods C 57 BL/ 6 mice were fed standard water (CTRL, n[*]=[*] 6), raltegravir-containing water (40 [*]mg/kg/day, n[*]=[*] 6), or dolutegravir-containing water (2. 7 [*]mg/kg/day, n[*]=[*] 6) for two weeks and sacrificed. Endpoints were assessed including urine microalbumin, kidney injury molecule- 1 renal tissue gene expression, renal histopathology, serum creatinine, and blood urea nitrogen. Results The results are NOT consistent with a direct nephrotoxic effect of the <b>integrase</b> <b>inhibitors</b> in mice. Serum creatinine was significantly elevated in raltegravir and dolutegravir mice (p[*]<[*] 0. 05) compared to control (raltegravir[*]=[*] 0. 25 [*]mg/dl, dolutegravir[*]=[*] 0. 30 [*]mg/dl versus CTRL[*]=[*] 0. 17 [*]mg/dl). Blood urea nitrogen, cystatin C, and urine microalbumin were unchanged. Kidney injury molecule- 1 tissue expression in raltegravir and dolutegravir groups was nonsignificantly elevated compared to control (1. 2 -fold compared to control). Renal histopathology by periodic acid–Schiff staining failed to reveal glomerular or tubular renal injury in any group. Conclusion These studies are consistent with <b>integrase</b> <b>inhibitors</b> competitively inhibiting creatinine secretion. While no evidence of direct nephrotoxicity was observed after two weeks of high-dose drug administration, additional studies may be performed to understand whether these drugs lead to chronic nephropathy...|$|R

40|$|To {{study the}} effect of {{potential}} human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV- 1) <b>integrase</b> <b>inhibitors</b> during virus replication in cell culture, we used a modified nested Alu-PCR assay to quantify integrated HIV DNA {{in combination with the}} quantitative analysis of extrachromosomal HIV DNA. The two diketo acid <b>integrase</b> <b>inhibitors</b> (L- 708, 906 and L- 731, 988) blocked the accumulation of integrated HIV- 1 DNA in T cells following infection but did not alter levels of newly synthesized extrachromosomal HIV DNA. In contrast, we demonstrated that L 17 (a member of the bisaroyl hydrazine family of <b>integrase</b> <b>inhibitors)</b> and AR 177 (an oligonucleotide inhibitor) blocked the HIV replication cycle at, or prior to, reverse transcription, although both drugs inhibited integrase activity in cell-free assays. Quercetin dihydrate (a flavone) was shown to not have any antiviral activity in our system despite reported anti-integration properties in cell-free assays. This refined Alu-PCR assay for HIV provirus is a useful tool for screening anti-integration compounds identified in biochemical assays for their ability to inhibit the accumulation of integrated HIV DNA in cell culture, and it may be useful for studying the effects of these inhibitors in clinical trials.

40|$|Since the {{discovery}} of the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV- 1) as the causative agent of AIDS in the early eighties, its spread has been dramatic. Current therapeutic strategies for the inhibition of viral replication employ a combination of drugs targeted at the viral reverse transcriptase and protease enzymes. The clinical benefit of this combination therapy is considerable, although often only transient, partly due to the emergence of multiple drug-resistant viral strains. The addition of new anti-HIV drugs targeting a third step of the viral replication may help in preventing resistance development. During HIV replication, the integration of the genome into the cellular chromosome is a vital step, which is catalysed by the viral integrase. The search for antiviral compounds capable of selective inhibition of integrase during viral replication is laborious and the large-scale screening programs for <b>integrase</b> <b>inhibitors</b> have thus far led to only one series of compounds that selectively inhibit the integration step of HIV replication, the diketo acids. In this review we summarize the current knowledge about HIV- 1 <b>integrase</b> and <b>integrase</b> <b>inhibitors.</b> We address the issue why it is so difficult to find potent and selective <b>integrase</b> <b>inhibitors,</b> suitable to be included in a therapeutic drug combination and we propose new strategies for {{the discovery}} of integration inhibitors. status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Microbicides are {{products}} {{that can be}} applied to vaginal or rectal mucosal surfaces with the goal of preventing, or at least significantly reducing, the transmission of sexually transmitted infections including HIV- 1. Despite more than two decades of HIV- 1 research, there is still no efficacious HIV- 1 vaccine, and the scientific community appears sceptical about the short or long-term feasibility of developing a vaccine that has the ability to induce sterilizing immunity against HIV- 1. In this setting, microbicide research has been developed. Among the promising candidate microbicides, the <b>integrase</b> <b>inhibitors</b> are the most recently developed compounds. In fact, since the beginning reverse transcriptase, fusion and entry inhibitors were identified as possible HIV-specific candidate microbicides along with the non-specific topical microbicides. In the case of <b>integrase</b> <b>inhibitors,</b> only a few have demonstrated to block HIV- 1 infection in models that mimic sexual transmission of the virus. These compounds have been tested in in vitro and ex vivo assays to determine their efficacy in pre- and/or post-exposure prophylactic settings. In particular, the naphthyridinecarboxyamide L- 870, 812 has been shown to block viral infection in pre- and post-exposure studies obtaining comparable results to the reverse transcriptase inhibitor PMPA.
