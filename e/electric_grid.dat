In response, numerous families boarded up their homes and sought refuge in the 45 public shelters opened across the republic. On December1, a United States Navy vessel arrived in Palau in case requests for assistance were made after the storm. As a precautionary measure, the nations <b>electric</b> <b>grid</b> was shut down at 6:00p.m. local time on December2.

5|$|Direct {{geothermal}} heating systems contain pumps and compressors, which may consume energy from a polluting source. This parasitic load is normally {{a fraction of}} the heat output, so it is always less polluting than electric heating. However, if the electricity is produced by burning fossil fuels, then the net emissions of {{geothermal heating}} may be comparable to directly burning the fuel for heat. For example, a geothermal heat pump powered by electricity from a combined cycle natural gas plant would produce about as much pollution as a natural gas condensing furnace of the same size. Therefore, the environmental value of direct geothermal heating applications is highly dependent on the emissions intensity of the neighboring <b>electric</b> <b>grid.</b>|$|E
5|$|General Motors is {{sponsoring}} the Pecan Street demonstration project in Austin, Texas. The project {{objective is to}} learn the charging patterns of plug-in electric car owners, and to study how a residential fleet of electric vehicles might strain the <b>electric</b> <b>grid</b> if all owners try to charge them at the same, {{which is what the}} preliminary monitoring found when the plug-in cars return home in the evening. The Mueller neighborhood is the test ground, and , the community has nearly 60 Chevrolet Volt owners alone.

40|$|Proliferation of {{electric}} vehicles (EVs) will engender additional loads on <b>electric</b> <b>grids.</b> As EVs will be parked {{in large numbers}} for long time at business locations such as universities, shopping malls, offices etc., <b>electric</b> <b>grids</b> of these business locations can be affected. Thus, this paper analyzes impacts as such on business premises, whose diurnal distributions of number of arrival and departure of vehicles are known. A statistical EV load model has been derived and an innovative probabilistic impact index (II) has been defined for better visualization of the impact. The analysis {{has been carried out}} for different EV load penetration levels, charging rates and market shares of different vehicles etc. The developed methodology for this analysis will help carryout future planning and operational exercises to reduce any adverse impacts of EV charging on grids...|$|R

25|$|Public {{transportation}} {{vehicles are}} not usually included in the green vehicle category, but Personal rapid transit (PRT) vehicles probably should be. All vehicles that are powered from the track {{have the advantage of}} potentially being able to use any source of electric energy, including sustainable ones, rather than requiring liquid fuels. They can also switch regenerative braking energy between vehicles and the <b>electric</b> <b>grid</b> rather than requiring energy storage on the vehicles. Also, they can potentially use the entire track area for solar collectors, not just the vehicle surface. The potential PRT energy efficiency is much higher than that which traditional automobiles can attain.|$|E
25|$|In {{a nuclear}} power station, the {{pressurized}} steam is fed through a steam turbine which drives an electrical generator connected to the <b>electric</b> <b>grid</b> for transmission. After passing through the turbine the secondary coolant (water-steam mixture) is cooled down and condensed in a condenser. The condenser converts the steam to a liquid {{so that it can}} be pumped back into the steam generator, and maintains a vacuum at the turbine outlet so that the pressure drop across the turbine, and hence the energy extracted from the steam, is maximized. Before being fed into the steam generator, the condensed steam (referred to as feedwater) is sometimes preheated in order to minimize thermal shock.|$|E
