The Crane Flat phase lasted from 1000BCE to 500CE and is marked by hunting with the atl atl {{and the use of}} grinding stones. The Tarmarack phase lasted from 500 until 1200, marked by a shift to using smaller rock points, indicating development and use of the bow and arrow. The Mariposa phase lasted from 1200 until contact with <b>European</b> <b>Americans.</b>|$|E

40|$|<b>European</b> <b>American,</b> Japanese, and Chinese 11 -month-olds {{participated in}} emotion-inducing labora-tory procedures. Facial {{responses}} were scored with BabyFACS, an anatomically based coding system. Overall, Chinese infants were less expressive than <b>European</b> <b>American</b> and Japanese infants. On measures of smiling and crying, Chinese infants scored lower than <b>European</b> <b>American</b> infants, whereas Japanese infants {{were similar to}} the <b>European</b> <b>American</b> infants or fell between the two other groups. Results suggest that differences in expressivity between <b>European</b> <b>American</b> and Chinese infants are more robust than those between <b>European</b> <b>American</b> and Japanese infants and that Chinese and Japanese infants can differ significantly. Cross-cultural differences were also found for some specific brow, cheek, and midface facial actions (e. g., brows lowered). These are {{discussed in terms of}} current controversies about infant affective facial expressions. Over 25 years ago, Ekman, Sorenson, and Friesen (1969) conducted a landmark study demonstrating that preliterate New Guinea tribespeople identified a number of emotional facial ex-pressions similar to participants in three literate cultures: Japan, Brazil, and the United States.

5|$|Irataba (Mohave: eecheeyara tav , {{also known}} as Yara tav, Yarate:va, Arateve; – 1874) was {{a leader of the}} Mohave Nation, known for his role as a {{mediator}} between his people and the United States. He was born near the Colorado River in present-day Arizona. Irataba was a renowned orator {{and one of the first}} Mohave to speak English, a skill he used to develop relations with the United States. Early records mention his large physical size and gentle demeanor. Irataba first encountered <b>European</b> <b>Americans</b> in 1851, when he assisted the Sitgreaves Expedition. In 1854, he met Amiel Whipple, then leading an expedition crossing the Colorado. Several Mohave aided the group, and Irataba agreed to escort them through the territory of the Paiute to the Old Spanish Trail, which would take them to southern California. He later helped and protected other expeditions, earning him a reputation among whites as the most important native leader in the region.|$|E
5|$|Moving to Northern California, McNallen began {{a career}} as a school teacher; during the summer {{vacations}} he travelled the world as a military journalist, writing articles for Soldier of Fortune magazine. Concerned by what he saw as the growth of liberal, universalist ideas in Heathenry, he returned to active involvement in the Heathen movement in the mid-1990s, establishing the Asatrú Folk Assembly, which was headquartered in Grass Valley, California. In 1997 he was involved in the establishment of the International Asatru/Odinist Alliance alongside Murray's AA and the British Odinic Rite. He brought greater attention to his group after they became involved in the debate surrounding the Kennewick Man, arguing that it constituted evidence for a European presence in prehistoric America. In the 21st century he became more politically active, becoming involved in both environmentalist campaigns and a group promoting the rights of <b>European</b> <b>Americans.</b>|$|E

5|$|Some of {{the first}} <b>European</b> <b>Americans</b> to visit the area were fur trappers led by Peter Skene Ogden in 1827. In 1841 the United States Exploring Expedition passed through the Rogue Valley. Neither Ogden nor the {{expedition}} mentioned the Table Rocks. The gold rush of the early 1850s brought many emigrants to the area, and Table Rock City (later renamed Jacksonville) was established several {{miles south of the}} rocks. The sudden increase of settlers created conflicts with the Rogue River Indians. These conflicts turned into warfare, and several treaties were signed in an attempt to end the hostilities. In June 1851, soldiers of the United States Army led by Major Philip Kearny attacked the Takelma near Lower Table Rock, but the Takelma were prepared. One soldier died, and three others were injured. Major Kearny returned with volunteers from Yreka soon after, accompanied by Oregon Territory delegate Joseph Lane. The ensuing Battle of Table Rock lasted 10days, and 30Takelma were imprisoned.|$|E
5|$|The area {{including}} present-day Youngstown {{was part}} of the Connecticut Western Reserve, a section of the Northwest Territory that Connecticut initially did not cede to the Federal government. Upon cession, Connecticut retained the title to the land in the Western Reserve, which it sold to the Connecticut Land Company for $1,200,000. While many of the area's early settlers came from Connecticut, Youngstown attracted a significant number of Scots-Irish settlers from neighboring Pennsylvania. The first <b>European</b> <b>Americans</b> to settle permanently in the area were Pittsburgh native James Hillman and wife Catherine Dougherty. By 1798, Youngstown was the home of several families who were concentrated near the point where Mill Creek meets the Mahoning River. Boardman Township was founded in 1798 by Elijah Boardman, a member of the Connecticut Land Company. Also founded in 1798 was Austintown by John McCollum who was a settler from New Jersey.|$|E
5|$|The first <b>European</b> <b>Americans</b> {{to visit}} the area were a group of fur trappers led by Peter Skene Ogden in 1827. The {{community}} of Buncom was founded by Chinese miners in 1851 when gold, silver, cinnabar, and chromite were discovered in nearby Jacksonville. In the spring of 1854, James Sterling and Aaron Davis discovered gold in the Sterling Creek area, and hundreds of miners soon arrived. The town of Sterlingville was founded, and by October its population had risen to over 1,500. Mining lasted through the 1850s and 1860s, {{and much of the}} riverbeds of Sterling Creek and the lower Little Applegate River were excavated. The Sterling Ditch and several other ditches were constructed in the 1870s, providing water to large hydraulic mining operations in Sterlingville and surrounding regions. The Sterlingville mine quickly became the largest hydraulic mine in Oregon, and possibly the entire western United States.|$|E
40|$|African American {{youth are}} less likely to use alcohol than their <b>European</b> <b>American</b> counterparts; however, the greater {{consequences}} of use for African American youth highlight the need for greater research attention to this group. Two social contexts that have been linked with adolescent alcohol use are parents and peers, yet these studies have rarely included African American youth or failed to examine potential racial differences. This study examined the main and interactive effects of parents and peers, as well as the moderating role of race on alcohol use, in African <b>American</b> and <b>European</b> <b>American</b> rural adolescents (n � 71) identified as at high-risk for alcohol use.

40|$|Four {{quantitative}} meta-analyses examined whether teachers' expectations, referrals, {{positive and}} neutral speech, and negative speech differed toward ethnic minority students (i. e., African American, Asian American, and Latino/a) {{as compared with}} <b>European</b> <b>American</b> students. Teachers were found to hold the highest expectations for Asian American students (d = -. 17). In addition, teachers held more positive expectations for <b>European</b> <b>American</b> students than for Latino/a (d =. 46) or African American (d =. 25) students. Teachers made more positive referrals and fewer negative referrals for <b>European</b> <b>American</b> students than for Latino/a and African American students (d =. 31). Although teachers directed more positive and neutral speech (e. g., questions and encouragement) toward <b>European</b> <b>American</b> students than toward Latino/a and African American students (d =. 21), they directed {{an equal amount of}} negative speech (e. g., criticism) to all students (d =. 02). In general, teachers' favoring of <b>European</b> <b>American</b> students compared with African American and Latino/a students was associated with small but statistically significant effects. The meta-analyses suggest that teachers' expectations and speech vary with students' ethnic backgrounds. PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2007 APA, all rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} the present study was to {{investigate}} the potential for cross-ethnic miscommunication of facial expressions. The ability of elementary school chil-dren to identify emotion in African <b>American</b> and <b>European</b> <b>American</b> facial ex-pressions and how this ability relates to social competence was examined. Afri-can American (n = 37) and <b>European</b> <b>American</b> (n = 37) children were administered African <b>American</b> and <b>European</b> <b>American</b> faces. Sociometric rat-ings alsowere obtained. The ability to read faces differing in ethnicity did not dif-fer by children’s ethnicity. However, ability to read facial expressions of one’s own ethnic group, but not the other, was significantly related to social competence. For the past three decades, there has been increasing interest in determin-ing the role of culture and race in the recognition of emotion in facial expres-sions. These studies, however, primarily used <b>European</b> <b>American</b> partici-pants and <b>European</b> <b>American</b> facial expressions of emotion. When facial expression stimuli other than EuropeanAmericanwere used, theymost often were either Japanese (Matsumoto & Ekman, 1988) or African American (Nowicki, Glanville, & Demertzis, 1998), and they were administered to adults. A separate body of nonverbal research has examined the role of facial expressions in the regulation of children’s social interaction and their subse-quent development of peer relationships (Feldman, Philippot, & Custrini, 1991; Monfries & Kafer, 1987; Nowicki et al., 1998).
