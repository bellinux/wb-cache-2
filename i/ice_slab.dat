5000|$|Some teams propose dry venting {{of carbon}} dioxide (CO2) gas and sand, {{occurring}} between the ice and the underlying bedrock. It is known that a CO2 <b>ice</b> <b>slab</b> is virtually transparent to solar radiation where 72% of solar energy incident at 60 degrees off vertical will reach {{the bottom of a}} 1 m thick layer. In addition, separate teams from Taiwan and France measured the ice thickness in several target areas, and discovered that the greatest thickness of the CO2 frost layer in the geysers' area is about 0.76-0.78 m, supporting the geophysical model of dry venting powered by sunlight. [...] As the southern spring CO2 ice receives enough solar energy, it starts sublimation of the CO2 ice from the bottom. [...] This vapor accumulates under the slab rapidly increasing pressure and erupting. High-pressure gas flows through at speeds of 160 km/h or more; [...] under the slab, the gas erodes ground as it rushes toward the vents, snatching up loose particles of sand and carving the spidery network of grooves. [...] The dark material falls back to the surface and may be taken up slope by wind, creating dark wind streak patterns on the ice cap. [...] This model is consistent with past observations. [...] It is clear that sublimation of the base of the seasonal ice cap is more than capable of generating a substantial overpressure, which is four orders of magnitude higher than the ice overburden pressure and five orders of magnitude higher than atmospheric pressure as discussed above.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, we use {{morphological}} and numerical {{methods to}} test the hypothesis that seasonally formed fracture patterns in the Martian polar regions result from the brittle failure of seasonal CO 2 <b>slab</b> <b>ice.</b> The observations by the High Resolution Imaging Science Experiment (HiRISE) of polar regions of Mars show very narrow dark elongated linear patterns that are observed during some periods of time in spring, disappear in summer and re-appear again in the following spring. They are repeatedly formed in the same areas but they do not repeat the exact pattern from year to year. This leads to the conclusion that they are cracks formed in the seasonal ice layer. Some of models of seasonal surface processes rely on the existence of a transparent form of CO 2 <b>ice,</b> so-called <b>slab</b> <b>ice.</b> For the creation of the observed cracks the ice is required to be a continuous media, not an agglomeration of relatively separate particles like a firn. The best explanation for our observations is a <b>slab</b> <b>ice</b> with relatively high transparency in the visible wavelength range. This transparency allows a solid state green-house effect to act underneath the ice sheet raising the pressure by sublimation from below. The trapped gas creates overpressure and the ice sheet breaks at some point creating the observed cracks. We show that the times when the cracks appear are in agreement with the model calculation, providing one more piece of evidence that CO 2 <b>slab</b> <b>ice</b> covers polar areas in spring...|$|R

40|$|The {{phenomenon}} of freezing and melting following sudden contact between {{a pool of}} binary, eutectic-forming, solution and an underlying solid layer of the lighter pool component was investigated. Experiments were conducted using various salt (KI, NaCl, MgCl(, 2), or CaCl(, 2)) solutions as the pool and air-bubble-free ice as the solid. Both the melting regime and the selective freezing regime, were studied. Experimentally, the temperature transients and the phase-change rates were measured and the interface morphology {{as well as the}} micro-physical process near the phase-change front were observed. Within the temperature and the density ratio ranges explored, the ice melting rate was found to be very sensitive to the ratio of solution to ice melt density but independent of solution and ice temperature difference. By varying the density ratio, two different convection patterns in the pool and two different morphologies of the solid-liquid interface were observed. For low-density ratios, the interface was less wavy and the average wavelength was much larger than observed for high-density-ratios. In both convection regimes, melt streamers were observed emanating from the crests of the wavy interface into the pool. The measured wavelengths (spacing) between the streamers for four different pairs of materials were correlated with density ratio and agree favorably with Taylor instability theory predictions. In the selective freezing study, the growth of a solid-liquid two phase region over a subcooled <b>ice</b> <b>slab</b> was investigated. The morphology of the two-phase region for NaCl-H(, 2) O pool were observed. The two-phase, liquid front motion was recorded through a telescopic device together with measured transient temperature distribution. Assuming that each infinitesimal element of the two-phase region is in local thermodynamic equilibrium with the solid and that the solid is semi-infinite in extent, a similarity model was developed to predict the dependence of the freezing rate and temperature distribution on the parameters of the system. For a thick <b>ice</b> <b>slab,</b> the analytical and the experimental results agree quite well.

The following fundamental processes of H 2 formation via two H atoms’ recombination, H+H → H 2, were studied in detail; 1) the sticking of H atom onto the surface, 2) the diffusion of H atom on the surface, 3) the reaction of two H atoms on the surface, 4) the ejection of H 2 from the ice surface. The sticking probability, the mobility, the reaction probability, and the ejection lifetime were selfconsistantly obtained for the above processes. The product energy distribution of H 2 molecules formed on icy mantles of dust grains was also studied, and it was found that H 2 molecules can be highly vibrationally excited by formation pumping mechanism.|$|R

The experiments were done using the spectro-radiogoniometer described in Brissaud et al. (2004). The radiative transfer model assumes an isotropization of the flux after the second interface and is fully described in Andrieu et al. (2015). Two kind of experiments were conducted. First, the specular spot was closely investigated, at high angular resolution, at the wavelength of 1. 5 μ m, where ice behaves as a very absorbing media. Second, the bidirectional reflectance was sampled at various geometries, including low phase angles on 61 wavelengths ranging from 0. 8 μ m to 2. 0 μ m. In order to validate the model, we made a qualitative test to demonstrate the relative isotropization of the flux. We also conducted quantitative assessments by using a bayesian inversion method in order to estimate the parameters (e. g. sample thickness, surface roughness) from the radiative measurements only. A simple comparison between the retrieved parameters and the direct independent measurements allowed us to validate the model. We developed an innovative bayesian inversion approach to quantitatively estimate the uncertainties on the parameters avoiding the usual slow Monte Carlo approach. First we built lookup tables, and then searched the best fits and calculated a posteriori density probability functions.

Saving energy from dehumidification systems in ice rinks is a subject that still needs to be developed and investigated with an increased focus in matters of energy efficiency in these types of structure. The performance of the dehumidification system of diverse ice rinks located near the city of Stockholm, Sweden, is here analysed in order to evaluate the use of energy related to indoor and outdoor climate. The connection of a district heating system to a dehumidifier in Älta ice rink is also investigated, with the final conclusion that the amount of electricity that the system is able to save is nearly 50 %. There are two different types of dehumidifiers and their energy consumption is studied and further compared with the obtained values of energy usage by the refrigeration system to dehumidify the air using the <b>ice</b> <b>slab.</b> The results show that the <b>ice</b> <b>slab</b> uses much less energy comparing with the dehumidifier system (0, 336 and 2, 076 kWh/kg water, respectively, in Älta ice rink case).

Changing only one boundary or initial condition, the model produces solutions with at least some ice-free oceans in the low latitudes. Using some combination of these forcing parameters, a full Earth's glaciation is obtained. We find that the most significant factor leading to an ice-covered Earth is the high land albedo in combination with initial temperatures set equal to the freezing point. Oceanic heat transport and orography play only a minor role for the climate state. Extremely low concentrations of CO 2 also appear to be insufficient to provoke a runaway ice-albedo feedback, but the strong deviations in surface air temperatures in the Northern Hemisphere point {{to the existence of}} a strong nonlinearity in the system.

The model employs a coordinate transformation which maps {{the thickness of}} the snow and <b>ice</b> <b>slabs</b> onto unity intervals and thus enables automatic relayering when the snow or ice thickness changes. This is done through an advection term which naturally appears in the transformed energy equation. Unlike previous approaches, the model conserves the total energy per layer (Jm⁻² as opposed to Jm⁻³), which takes into account the changes in internal energy associated with thickness changes. This model was then tested against observational data from the Surface Heat Budget of the Arctic Ocean (SHEBA) experiment {{in the context of the}} Sea Ice Model Intercomparison Project, Part 2, Thermodynamics (SIMIP 2). In general, the model reproduces the observed internal snow-ice temperature and the ice thickness evolution very well.

Given that the spatial variability in snow depth at small scale is large, the specification of the snow depth temporal evolution is crucial for an intercomparison project. Since F/ocn in SIMIP 2 is calculated as a residual of the observed basal growth rates and heat conduction, the salinity of newly formed ice used in the simulations must be consistent with that used to derive F/ocn. Simulated and observed snow surface and snow-ice interface temperatures suggest that not enough heat is conducted through the snow layer even when using a snow thermal conductivity as large as 0. 50 Wm⁻¹ K⁻¹ (value derived from observed snow and ice internal temperature profiles).

This precursory activity is represented by a 1 - 3 hour period of activity comprising a sequence of discrete repeating earthquakes and a period of continuous groundshaking that builds in amplitude. The avalanche itself is represented by a broadband (1 - 20 Hz), spindle-shaped signal that may be composed of several pulses of activity. The precursory earthquakes are similar in time series, indicating that they share a common source region and mechanism, and {{become more and more}} frequent until they blend into the continuous signal.

Until recently, exact apalytical solutions of the system of the above equations were known only for one and two-dimensional cases under unrealistically simplified assumptions.

The first method is based on new surface and ice thickness data from which the line of buoyant flotation is found. We compare this hydrostatic map with kinematic GPS measurements of the tidal response of the ice surface. By detecting the transitions where the ice starts to move vertically in response to the tidal forcing we find control points for the grounding line position along GPS profiles. %If it can be shown that the long-term viscous mechanical behaviour of the <b>ice</b> <b>slab</b> validates the hydrostatic approach, mapping the grounding line from the ice supper surface displacements conversely requires correcting for the rigid elastic slab effect that dominates at tidal frequencies.

The breeding habitat of Caspian seals is land-fast or drift ice, usually at least 20 cm thick, overlying water 3 – 5 m deep. Pregnant females formed pairs or small groups. They were not observed to use lairs, but preferentially pupped beside ice ridges or ice-slab piles that afforded shelter to pups. In years when there were few natural leads into the ice-field, females often gave birth {{on the edge of}} artificial leads formed by shipping channels. Pups were categorized into stages from newborn (1), white-coat (2), molting (3), and molted (4), with Stage 3 and 4 pups appearing from mid to late February. The nursing period lasted at least 3 weeks and neighboring mother-pup pairs appeared to be mutually tolerant. Mothers left their pups alone or at nursery sites, presumably to forage. Most white-coat pups moved over the ice while avoiding water in response to disturbance from vessels. Mother-pup pairs maintained contact while moving across the ice by a combination of the pup’s following response and diligent chaperoning by the mother. During disturbances some lone pups sought refuge in shelters under <b>ice</b> <b>slabs,</b> whereas others followed a neighboring mother-pup pair away from the vessel. Male-female pairing occurred in late season with no male-male competition observed on the ice. While breeding and pup rearing behavior of Caspian seals has some features in common with that of other Holarctic seals, it is largely distinct and adapted to the unique conditions of the Caspian environment, in particular the paucity of snow cover on the ice...|$|R
25|$|The lower slopes on the SE {{side of the}} {{mountain}} are composed of <b>ice</b> polished <b>slabs</b> dotted with long flowing mounds of debris, this is fluted moraine, deposited from a glacier, the mounds are less than four metres in height but up to 400 metres in length. The mountains visual attraction is further added to by the presence of four small lochs around its NE flanks, they are all on different levels. One of these lochs, Loch a’ Mhadaidh Ruadh, is rated {{as one of the most}} beautiful in the Scottish Highlands, it is located on the Bealach a’ Choire Ghairbh and is enclosed by walls of quartzite rock, giving it an almost artificial look. All drainage from {{the mountain}} makes the short journey to the west coast of Scotland, either going directly west to Upper Loch Torridon or SE to Glen Carron and then Loch Carron.|$|R
30|$|The low thermal {{conductive}} {{properties of the}} wood blocks was determined using two types of dry <b>ice</b> forms (solid <b>slabs</b> and crushed small particles/snow; 1300  ±  50  g) in a specially designed polystyrene (JIS A- 9511 [22]) insulation chamber (Fig.  1 b). The insulation chamber {{was designed to maximize}} the heat transfer properties of solid carbon dioxide. During the test operation, the instant temperature change of the wood blocks tested were monitored with a thermocouple [3.5 (ϕ) ×  70 -mm (L), JUST Co. Ltd, Tokyo, Japan] connected to a computer via a thermocouple interface and SoftThermo E 830 software (Technol Seven, Tokyo, Japan) for 20  h at 15 -min intervals.|$|R
