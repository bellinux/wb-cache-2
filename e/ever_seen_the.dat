5|$|In the Second Test in Sydney. Miller had a quiet match, scoring 40 {{and taking}} one wicket on a spin-friendly pitch as Australia secured another innings victory, but showed {{he was in}} prime batting form when he {{returned}} to the Sheffield Shield. Playing against New South Wales, he hammered three sixes in one over and made 153 of a 271-run partnership with Merv Harvey in just over three hours, setting up an innings victory. Bill Ponsford said that it was the hardest hitting he had <b>ever</b> <b>seen.</b> <b>The</b> Third Test was Miller's first in his home town. He had a mediocre game in a drawn match, scoring 33 and 34, and taking two wickets.|$|E
25|$|Additionally {{the role}} was played by Mark Rylance at the Globe Theatre in 2003. An often {{overlooked}} production, the lead actor handles the character in, as The Guardian noted, {{perhaps the most}} vulnerable way <b>ever</b> <b>seen.</b> <b>The</b> play returned to the Globe in 2015 with Charles Edwards in the title role.|$|E
25|$|Fakhreddine is {{regarded}} by the Lebanese {{as the best}} leader and prince the country has <b>ever</b> <b>seen.</b> <b>The</b> Druze prince treated all the religions equally and {{was the one who}} formed Lebanon. Lebanon has achieved during Fakhreddine's reign enormous heights that the country had and would never witness again.|$|E

25|$|In 1901 the Gladys City Oil, Gas, and Manufacturing Company struck oil on Spindletop Hill in Beaumont. Though {{petroleum}} {{production was}} not new, this strike {{was by far}} the largest the world had <b>ever</b> <b>seen.</b> <b>The</b> find led to widespread exploration throughout Texas and neighboring states. By 1940 Texas was firmly established as the leading oil producer in the U.S.|$|E
25|$|In 2004, it was {{reported}} that Spitzer had spotted a faintly glowing body that may be the youngest star <b>ever</b> <b>seen.</b> <b>The</b> telescope was trained on a core of gas and dust known as L1014 which had previously appeared completely dark to ground-based observatories and to ISO (Infrared Space Observatory), a predecessor to Spitzer. The advanced technology of Spitzer revealed a bright red hot spot in the middle of L1014.|$|E
25|$|At Brisbane, on a wicket {{that was}} the worst that I have <b>ever</b> <b>seen,</b> <b>the</b> Yorkshireman was superb. The head-high bouncer was safely ignored. The chest-high {{deliveries}} of both the pace men and the spinners were played safely to the ground, {{out of the way of}} the many grasping hands in the leg-trap, and Hutton's display was a perfect lesson in the art of batsmanship...that will long remain in my memory, being by far the best innings I have ever seen played.|$|E

25|$|On May 3, 1849, a Mississippi River levee breach upriver {{from the}} city (around modern River Ridge, Louisiana) created the worst {{flooding}} the city had <b>ever</b> <b>seen.</b> <b>The</b> flood, known as at Sauvé's Crevasse, left 12,000 people homeless. While New Orleans has experienced numerous floods large and small in its history, the flood of 1849 was of a more disastrous scale than any save the flooding after Hurricane Katrina in 2005. New Orleans has not experienced flooding from the Mississippi River since Sauvé's Crevasse, although it came dangerously close during the Great Mississippi Flood of 1927.|$|E
25|$|These {{contests}} were {{timed to}} coincide with an exposition of 1,200 Greek and 72 foreign exhibitors, the largest Greece had <b>ever</b> <b>seen.</b> <b>The</b> Greek royal family did not attend. There was not enough space for huge crowds that attended, who finally filled up the arena of the Stadium. Dissatisfaction ensued, and Fokianos was considered responsible despite his great efforts and the very good training of the athletes. The press heavily criticized the Games {{not only for the}} lack of organization, but also because the organizers had disqualified the working classes from competing. Fokianos became so embittered that he resigned as overall leader of the Olympics. However, the artistic competition of the Olympics proved a great success: 25 composers won awards in music and 25 sculptors and painters were honored.|$|E
25|$|In Royal Indian Navy (RIN) service, crewing LCAs {{followed}} {{somewhat similar}} lines. By mid-1941 {{members of the}} RIN Reserve and RIN Volunteer Reserve were being trained to operate LCA. In 1942, the RIN began receiving four battalions of Indian army troops to provide crews for landing craft. Seven hundred soldiers of the 9/1st Punjab Regiment volunteered for such a transfer in February 1943. The 15/13th Frontier Force Rifles Regiment voted similarly. These battalions were transferred {{despite the fact that}} few of the men had <b>ever</b> <b>seen</b> <b>the</b> sea. Their training suffered severely from lack of landing craft, spares, and trained instructors. From around mid-1943 there was also a Burma Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve in existence working closely among LCA and LCS crews. By 1945, the BRNVR seems to have been formed into the 59th Motor Launch Flotilla. In all likelihood, it had been put together at least partly from those with maritime experience escaping from the 1942 Japanese onslaught in Burma.|$|E

500|$|Guitarist Kerry King commented [...] "there's tons {{of stuff}} on there", citing {{the amount they}} had to choose from as a problem. King himself owned five large Tupperware storage boxes full of {{material}} amassed over the years. Having every magazine had <b>ever</b> <b>seen</b> <b>the</b> group inside, King also possessed roughly 70 VHS and 8mm videos dating back to 1983. Nick John of Slayer’s management team sifted through every video and transferred them to DVD.|$|E
500|$|She {{said she}} wasn't {{interested}} in doing any kind of biography or anything ever, which {{is a bit of}} a stern statement from someone who has been so out there. It doesn't matter whether it's me, Norman Mailer, whoever. I was disappointed because I felt that we've only <b>ever</b> <b>seen</b> <b>the</b> caricature, the cartoon version of Madonna and I really wanted to show that she is a considerable artist and that she is more than anything that has been written about her in the past. I think for her it is an opportunity missed." ...|$|E

[...] On 9 September Fram was escorted into Christiania's harbour and welcomed by the largest crowds the city had <b>ever</b> <b>seen.</b> <b>The</b> crew were {{received}} by King Oscar, and Nansen, reunited with family, remained at the palace for several days as a special guest. Tributes arrived from all over the world; typical was that from the British mountaineer Edward Whymper, who wrote that Nansen had made [...] "almost as great an advance as has been accomplished by all other voyages in the nineteenth century put together".|$|E

500|$|None {{who have}} <b>ever</b> <b>seen</b> <b>the</b> place have {{questioned}} its strength. [...] Old President López had such implicit faith in its impregnability {{that he believed}} if even a Xerxes attacked Paraguay {{he could not get}} past Humaitá. [...] The same implicit confidence in its strength was inculcated {{in the minds of the}} Paraguayan people. [...] Their watchword was 'Humaitá', and possibly to the exaggerated idea of its strength by the present López may be traced the grave political error which step by step led this unfortunate man from the cautious policy of his father to become the great champion of River Plate equilibrium.|$|E
500|$|... "Spirit Wind" [...] {{incorporates}} a folk rock sound with influences from country music. The song, {{one of the}} first songs Mark Hall ever wrote, was written after Hall saw a pastor at a church in Alabama preach the story of Ezekiel and the valley of dry bones to a church that Hall described as one of the [...] "deadest churches" [...] he had <b>ever</b> <b>seen.</b> <b>The</b> song's verse structure goes from [...] "Ezekiel in the first verse to the country preacher in the second verse and finally to a prayer for God to raise his Church again as a mighty army [...] ".|$|E

According to Dylan, [...] "She was the most erotic thing I'd <b>ever</b> <b>seen...</b> <b>The</b> air was suddenly filled with banana leaves. We started talking and my head started to spin." [...] Rotolo was photographed arm-in-arm with Dylan {{on the cover of}} his album The Freewheelin' Bob Dylan. Critics have connected Rotolo to some of Dylan's early love songs, including [...] "Don't Think Twice It's All Right". The relationship ended in 1964. In 2008, Rotolo published a memoir about her life in Greenwich Village and relationship with Dylan in the 1960s, A Freewheelin' Time.|$|E

500|$|Many World War II {{veterans}} {{stated that}} the film was the most realistic depiction of combat they had <b>ever</b> <b>seen.</b> <b>The</b> film was so realistic that combat veterans of D-Day and Vietnam left theaters rather than finish watching the opening scene depicting the Normandy invasion. Their visits to posttraumatic stress disorder counselors rose in number after the film's release, and many counselors advised [...] "'more psychologically vulnerable'" [...] veterans to avoid watching it. The Department of Veterans Affairs set up a nationwide hotline for veterans who were affected by the film, and {{less than two weeks}} after the film was released it had already received over 170 calls.|$|E

500|$|Location {{shooting}} for scenes {{set at the}} Police Station Garage {{took place at the}} Coal Exchange and Mount Stuart Square, Cardiff Bay on 21 November 2006. Fields House, located in Newport, filled in for Wester Drumlins. The house was already abandoned and falling into disrepair when the filming crews arrived. Moffat noted that [...] "very little of it was tarted up" [...] for the shoot; Moffat later called the location [...] "the creepiest house" [...] he had <b>ever</b> <b>seen.</b> <b>The</b> name was taken from a previous residence that Moffat lived in during the late 1990s. Larry describes the residence as [...] "Scooby-Doo's house", a reference to the dilapidated mansions that the Scooby-Doo gang would usually visit.
