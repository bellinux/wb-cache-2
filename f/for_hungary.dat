5|$|At {{some point}} Masolino {{was joined by}} another artist, the {{eighteen}} years younger Masaccio. Masolino eventually left, either <b>for</b> <b>Hungary</b> in 1425 or for Rome in 1427, leaving {{the completion of the}} chapel to Masaccio. In 1427 or 28, before the chapel was completed, Masaccio joined Masolino in Rome. Only in the 1480s was the work finished, by Filippino Lippi. The Tribute Money, though, is considered Masaccio's work entirely.|$|E
5|$|In 1263, the {{situation}} in Bulgaria was far from stable, as Constantine was facing both the threat of his predecessor Mitso Asen's throne ambitions and a large-scale Byzantine invasion. Because Constantine was unable to assist Jacob against the advancing Byzantines, Jacob sought aid from his northern neighbour, Hungarian king Stephen V. The Hungarians drove the Byzantines out of Jacob's domain and themselves invaded Byzantine-controlled territories. Rescued from the Byzantine threat, Jacob Svetoslav submitted to Hungarian suzerainty. Stephen V placed him as the ruler of the Vidin province on the Danube River, previously governed <b>for</b> <b>Hungary</b> by the then-deceased Rostislav Mikhailovich, and allowed him to retain his lands to the south. Had {{it not been for}} the appointment of Jacob Svetoslav as a Hungarian vassal at Vidin, Bulgaria would have re-established control over the city in 1263.|$|E

5|$|Starting in December 1848, {{a number}} of Wallachian revolutionaries who had escaped or had been set free from arrest began {{mediating}} an understanding between Hungary's Lajos Kossuth and those Romanian Transylvanian activists and peasants who, {{under the leadership of}} Avram Iancu, were mounting military resistance to the Honvédség troops of Józef Bem. Nicolae Bălcescu emerged from his refuge in the Principality of Serbia, and, together with Alexandru G. Golescu and Ion Ionescu de la Brad, began talks with Iancu in Zlatna. The Wallachians presented Kossuth's proposal that Iancu's fighters should leave their base in the Apuseni and help rekindle revolution in Wallachia, leaving room <b>for</b> <b>Hungary</b> to resist Russian invention, but the offer was dismissed on the spot. In parallel, Magheru reached out to Hungarian authorities, asking them to consider confederating Hungary proper and Transylvania; this plan was also rejected.|$|E

25|$|Eventually, as Germany {{completed}} its invasion of Poland {{and continued to}} voice support <b>for</b> <b>Hungary</b> in relation to Romanian-ruled Transylvania, Romania conceded to German economic demands (on March 7, 1940, the Gheorghe Tătărescu executive agreed to direct almost all cereal and oil exports towards Berlin). Romania did however offer assistance to Polish troops fleeing their country immediately {{after the start of}} Nazi occupation (see Polish-Romanian Alliance). The country's position became even more precarious after the fall of France in May—as a direct consequence, Romania renounced its alliance with the United Kingdom and began attempts to join the Axis.|$|E

25|$|The {{division}} later saw {{action in}} the Western Front in the Ardennes {{as part of the}} 6th Panzer Army's I SS-Panzer Corps, where it took part in the Battle of the Hurtgen Forest.

In the battle both Hungarian archbishops perished, along with other prelates and barons. Contemporary sources, among them Roger of Torre Maggiore, depict the utter desolation and destruction inflicted by the Mongols. All of the forty monasteries that are known to have disappeared at this time lay in the area affected by the invaders.|$|E
