50|$|In Australia, {{where it}} is known as phytophthora dieback, dieback, <b>jarrah</b> <b>dieback</b> or {{cinnamon}} fungus, Phytophthora cinnamomi infects a number of native plants, causing damage to forests and removing habitats for small mammals.|$|E
40|$|Jarrah trees {{surviving}} on <b>jarrah</b> <b>dieback</b> {{sites or}} seedlings surviving inoculation with Phytophthora cinnamomi under glasshouse conditions were propagated using tissue culture techniques. Clones and seedlings of jarrah were inoculated with zoospores in vitro and under glasshouse conditions. When inoculated in vitro individual clones showed a consistent response, between trials, {{with regard to}} time to infection. After inoculation in the glasshouse all seedlings became infected and had reduced growth, but the level of infection of the root system and {{the reduction in the}} growth of the plants varied between clones...|$|E
40|$|The {{fungicide}} phosphite (previously {{known as}} phosphonate) is a cheap and {{effective means of}} controlling Phytophthora cinnamomi Rands (the fungus that causes <b>jarrah</b> <b>dieback)</b> (1, 2). To date, {{studies have focused on}} the effect and mechanism of action of phosphite on P. cinnamomi and its effects on agricultural species and native Western Australian plants which are under threat from P. cinnamomi. The fungicide appears to have minimal phytotoxic effects on the vegetative parts of the plant (3). The phytotoxic effects of phosphite on flowers and reproduction has not been studied in detail...|$|E
50|$|Prevalent in the {{northern}} areas of the <b>Jarrah</b> Forest, <b>dieback</b> disease, caused by the introduced soil-borne pathogen Phythopthora cinnamomi, is {{a serious threat to}} many plant species. The disease involves the formation of lesions (decaying tissue) starting in the roots and moving up the stem of a plant, and, in the case of many species, killing them. It negatively affects more than 22% of the plant species in the forest. P. cinnamomi has been found in suberized and partially suberized roots that are perennial and it is these roots that form the specialised feeder root system of the jarrah. The spread of dieback is exacerbated by altered drainage caused by mining and timber harvesting. The soil population of P. cinnamomi is generally highest during spring, {{the time of year when}} soil temperature and moisture levels are high. An increase in summer rainfall is likely to increase the harm that this pathogen causes in {{the northern}} and southern jarrah forests, with high mortality rates of jarrah expected.|$|R
40|$|The name <b>jarrah</b> <b>dieback</b> {{was used}} in the 1940 s to {{describe}} a serious economic problem in the jarrah forest in the south west of Western Australia. This was the sudden death of groups of jarrah (Eucalyptus marginata) trees that occurred on previously logged sites that had a tendency to become waterlogged in winter. Although the cause was not determined at the time, from symptoms recorded in early investigations the most likely explanation is that the trees died as the result of waterlogging damage. In the 1960 s it was shown that many of these sites were infested by the introduced oomycete Phytophthora cinnamomi and tree deaths, together with the deaths of many mid- and under-storey plants, were attributed to this pathogen. A chronology of the research, based on contemporary unpublished documents, shows that in 1968 the conclusion that P. cinnamomi caused jarrah deaths was not supported by the available evidence, because the work did not satisfy the first and fourth of Koch’s postulates. The evidence that P. cinnamomi killed many mid- and under-storey plants was much stronger. There are two problems that have been confused: the death of groups of jarrah trees (<b>jarrah</b> <b>dieback)</b> that is caused by waterlogging and the death of many mid- and under-storey plants (Phytophthora dieback) caused by P. cinnamomi infection...|$|E
40|$|The name <b>jarrah</b> <b>dieback</b> {{has been}} used for two {{different}} disorders, leading to considerable confusion. It was coined in the 1940 s to describe the sudden death of groups of jarrah (Eucalyptus marginata) trees in south western Western Australia, which occurred on poorly drained sites, following exceptionally heavy rainfall. In the 1960 s these sites were shown to be infested by Phytophthora cinnamomi and jarrah deaths were attributed to it, even though it was only isolated from 5 % of sampled trees. Also the definition of <b>jarrah</b> <b>dieback</b> was expanded to include deaths of many other plants on infested sites, from which P. cinnamomi was more readily isolated. Jarrah trees die from severe water deficiency, indicating problems with water conduction through roots. Xylem vessel diameters vary along roots, being narrow at the root collar, while distally they are larger, providing water storage. Jarrah transpires vigorously during summer, accessing water at depth on sites with deep soil, but being more dependent on internally stored water when root systems are shallower. Following waterlogging, sapwood vessels become blocked with tyloses, reducing both conductivity and potential water storage; such trees may have insufficient water reserves for summer survival. In jarrah P. cinnamomi is unlikely to cause water deficiency because sapwood invasion is rapidly contained in healthy roots. Recent investigations into P. cinnamomi invasion and host responses in other plants show that it can potentially cause a vascular wilt in Banksia spp. and chronic, symptomless infections in herbaceous plants. Susceptibility to waterlogging damage, and/or mortality resulting from infection by P. cinnamomi can only be clarified by detailed knowledge of the hosts and their vulnerabilities. This is essential for making diagnoses, devising management strategies, and avoiding the confusions of the past...|$|E
40|$|Forest insect and {{pathogen}} {{species are}} expanding their geographical ranges through international trade {{at a rate}} that most pest specialists and ecologists find alarming. While many invaders are relatively innocuous, several species have damaging impacts on agricultural and natural resources. Furthermore, some of these non-native pests have had catastrophic impacts on ecosystem functions when they invade native communities in which they have no prior evolutionary history. Examples include the demise of chestnut trees in North America, major losses of elms in Europe and North America, <b>Jarrah</b> <b>dieback</b> in Australia, and the devastating effects of pine wood nematode in Asia. Predicting which insects or pathogens will become most problematic and devising mitigation measures {{to reduce the risk of}} their arrival and establishment has become the ‘holy grail’ for many entomologists and plant pathologists worldwide. Analysis of historical data is an essential tool for identifying important invasion pathways and weak links in the chain of biosecurity measures that must be strengthened to protect local economies and ecosystem stability. In this issue of New Phytologist, Santini et al. (pp. 238 – 250), provide a comprehensive and insightful analysis of historical forest pathogen establishment and spread records from Europe. A product of a collaborative (20 nations) European Union-funded project, the paper identifies dominant plant pathogen invasion pathways and key factors predicting pathogen species invasiveness, as well as habitat characteristics that render certain regions more vulnerable to pathogen invasion. All of these associations have implications for preventing future invasions. In their paper, Santini et al. observed dramatic changes over time in the sources of forest pathogens establishing in Europe. The earliest known pathogen species establishments were largely a result of intra-European spread. North American species first trickled in during the late nineteenth century, and became even more important during the twentieth century. More recently, Asia has become a major source of pathogens. These changes reflect Europe’s expanding sphere of trading partners, particularly for live plant imports, the primary invasion pathway identified in this work and others (Kenis et al., 2007; Liebhold et al., 2012). These observations also suggest a potential ‘invasive species source depletion’ in which a long history of trade with a given source country results in early establishment of many species followed by fewer invasions as the stock of aggressive invaders becomes depleted. However, the authors correctly observe that there is danger associated with new intra- European invasions originating from previously trade-isolated member states, particularly given the lack of trade barriers currently in place within the European Union. A surprising wealth of exotic pathogen species established in Europe is documented, compared with recent reports from the United States. Aukema et al. (2010) reported only 17 non-native forest tree pathogens established in the United States, whereas Santini et al. found 60 in Europe (only 60 of the 91 pathogens alien to Europe infect forest trees, a criterion used by Aukema et al., 2010). This discrepancy suggests that either taxonomists are more diligent at describing new pathogens in Europe, or perhaps Europe’s long history of colonialism and more extensive planting of non-native trees may contribute to a heavier burden of introduced pathogens in Europe...|$|E
