25|$|In {{continuation}} of the 9th form of the basic school, the Gymnasium provides a 3-year course of continued general education. This covers the necessary basis for further studies and is completed by an examination (the upper secondary school exit examination). The upper secondary school exit examination, called studentereksamen in Danish, qualifies the student for admission to higher education, subject to regulations. The teaching must furthermore contribute to the pupils’ personal development and enlightenment, developing their interest in and ability to participate actively <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>democratic</b> <b>society.</b>|$|E

The course work for the minor emphasizes the history and emergence of the non-profit sector as a national institution distinct from {{the private and public}} spheres. The practicum aspects of the minor couples with the traditional academic work encourages students to see the connection between the deeds of charitable service and the historic worth of citizens participation in the common public franchise.|$|E

25|$|The {{size of the}} U.S. {{military}} {{in the latter half}} of the twentieth century, unprecedented in peacetime, caused concern in some circles, primarily as to the potential effect of maintaining such a large force <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>democratic</b> <b>society.</b> Some predicted disaster and were concerned with the growing militarization of American society. These writers were quite sure that a distinctly military culture was inherently dangerous to a non-militaristic liberal society. Others warned that the ascendancy of the military establishment would fundamentally change American foreign policy and would weaken the intellectual fabric of the country. However, most of the arguments were less apocalyptic and settled along two tracks. The two tracks are highlighted, respectively, by Samuel P. Huntington's Soldier and the State and Morris Janowitz's The Professional Soldier.|$|E
25|$|In December 2007, {{cautions}} {{were published}} separately by Karsten Nohl and Henryk Plotz regarding the weak encryption and other vulnerabilities {{of the particular}} security scheme as implemented on NXP's MIFARE chip set and contactless electronic card system. In March 2008, articles on the vulnerabilities appeared in newspapers and computer trade journals. A comparable independent cryptanalysis, focused on the MIFARE Classic chip, was performed at the Radboud University Nijmegen. On March 7 the scientists were able to recover a cryptographic key from the RFID card without using expensive equipment. With respect to responsible disclosure the Radboud University Nijmegen published the article six months later. NXP {{tried to stop the}} publication of the second article through a preliminary injunction. In the Netherlands, the judge ruled on July 18 that publishing this scientific article falls under the principle of freedom of expression and that <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>democratic</b> <b>society</b> it is of great importance that the results of scientific research can be published.|$|E
500|$|The UK Human Rights Act 1998 makes Article 9(1) of the European Convention on Human Rights, {{which protects}} freedom of religion, {{enforceable}} in UK domestic law. Article 9(2) states when {{the freedom of}} religion may be restricted: [...] "Freedom to manifest one's religion or beliefs shall be subject only to such limitations as are prescribed by law and are necessary <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>democratic</b> <b>society</b> {{in the interests of}} public safety, for the protection of public order, health or morals, or {{for the protection of the}} rights and freedoms of others." [...] R. (Begum) v. Headteacher and Governors of Denbigh High School (2006) was a House of Lords case involving a female Muslim student who wished to wear a jilbab (a long, coat-like garment) to comply with her understanding of the requirements of her faith, but was disallowed from doing so. Lord Bingham of Cornhill said that under Article 9(2), for a restriction to be justified it must be [...] "prescribed by law and necessary <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>democratic</b> <b>society</b> for a permissible purpose, that is, it must be directed to a legitimate purpose and must be proportionate in scope and effect". In the end, a majority of the Law Lords hearing the appeal (including Lord Bingham) held that the appellant's rights had not been interfered with. However, the court held unanimously that even if they had been, there were justifiable grounds for such interference, one of which was the need to protect the rights of other female students at the school who would not wish to be pressured into adopting a more extreme form of Muslim dress.|$|E

500|$|Several {{groups and}} {{persons in the}} Netherlands have called for legal action against Wilders, while others defended his right to free speech. On 15 August 2007, a {{representative}} of the Prosecutors' Office in Amsterdam declared that dozens of reports against Wilders had been filed, and that they were all being considered. Attempts to prosecute Wilders under Dutch anti-hate speech laws in June 2008 failed, with the public prosecutor's office stating that Wilders' comments contributed to the debate on Islam in Dutch society and also had been made outside parliament. The office released a statement reading: [...] "That comments are hurtful and offensive for a large number of Muslims {{does not mean that they}} are punishable. Freedom of expression fulfils an essential role in public debate <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>democratic</b> <b>society.</b> That means that offensive comments can be made in a political debate." ...|$|E
500|$|Jackson {{prompted}} {{debate about}} the legitimacy of limiting parliamentary sovereignty and the theoretical justifications for the ruling. Alison Young suggests that the opinions {{could be explained by}} the Parliament Act 1911 modifying the rule of recognition defining valid legal documents or by the Act redefining Parliament in a manner that binds the courts. Christopher Forsyth argues that the Parliament Acts redefined Parliament to be a bicameral body for all legislation which also has a method of unicamerally legislating (except to extend Parliament beyond five years). Jowell proposes that there are two reasons for limiting parliamentary sovereignty – if the democratic legitimacy of the legislature were undermined by its acts or if the body attempted to remove fundamental rights <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>democratic</b> <b>society</b> – [...] and cites support for these arguments from the judgment. The case was also criticised for claims made by Lord Steyn and Lord Hope that the doctrine of parliamentary sovereignty was solely a judicial creation.|$|E
