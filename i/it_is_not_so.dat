5|$|The bohor reedbuck inhabits moist grasslands and swamplands {{as well as}} woodlands. It {{is found}} in two kinds of habitat in {{northern}} Cameroon: the seasonally flooded grasslands rich in grasses like Vetiveria nigritana and Echinochloa pyramidalis (in the Sahelo-Sudan region) and Isoberlina woodlands (in the Sudano-Guinean region). Often found on grasslands susceptible to floods and droughts, the bohor reedbuck can adapt remarkably well to radical seasonal changes and calamities. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>so</b> widespread as the bushbuck due to its habitat requirements. In some margins of its range, the bohor reedbuck shares its habitat with the mountain reedbuck. The ranges of the bohor reedbuck and southern reedbuck extensively overlap in Tanzania.|$|E
5|$|As a young man, Manuel {{had been}} {{determined}} to restore by force of arms the predominance of the Byzantine Empire in the Mediterranean countries. By the time he died in 1180, 37 {{years had passed since}} that momentous day in 1143 when, amid the wilds of Cilicia, his father had proclaimed him emperor. These years had seen Manuel involved in conflict with his neighbours on all sides. Manuel's father and grandfather before him had worked patiently to undo the damage done by the battle of Manzikert and its aftermath. Thanks to their efforts, the empire Manuel inherited was stronger and better organised than at any time for a century. While it is clear that Manuel used these assets to the full, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>so</b> clear how much he added to them, and there is room for doubt as to whether he used them to best effect.|$|E

25|$|If {{there exists}} a minimal {{sufficient}} statistic, and this is usually the case, then every complete sufficient statistic is necessarily minimal sufficient(note that this statement does not exclude the option of a pathological {{case in which a}} complete sufficient exists while there is no minimal sufficient statistic).

25|$|In {{a popular}} {{personal}} report called Tre dagar med Victoria, which profiled her work during a three-day period that aired on TV4 in December 2004, Victoria commented on criticism directed at Westling, “Many unfair things are written. I {{understand that there}} is speculation, but some day justice will be done there, too.” Victoria also gave her opinion that happiness is important, and that these days <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>so</b> much about background and pedigree but about two people who have to live with each other. She said that if they are not happy and comfortable with each other, it is impossible to do a good job.|$|E

25|$|One toponym {{with a good}} {{claim to}} {{derivation}} from the saint's name is Chadkirk Chapel in Romiley, Greater Manchester, which {{dates back to the}} 14th century– although the site is much older, possibly dating back to the 7th century when it is believed St Chad visited to bless the well there. Cameron points out that -kirk toponyms more frequently incorporate the name of the dedicatee, rather than the patron, so {{there is every reason to}} believe that Chadkirk really was dedicated to St Chad in the Middle Ages. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>so</b> certain that Chadsmoor in Staffordshire, Chadwich in Worcestershire, or Chadwick in Warwickshire, were named after the saint.|$|E
25|$|In {{describing}} {{the shape and}} type of the St. Francis Dam the word curved is used although by today's standards, due {{to the amount of}} curve in its radius, the dam would be considered arched and therefore making it of the gravity-arch design. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>so</b> called because the science of gravity-arch dams was still in its infancy and little was known in the engineering community about the arch effect, how it worked and how loads were transmitted, other than that it did help with stability and support. As such, the dam was designed without any of the additional benefits given by the arch action, which led to its profile being considered conservative given its size.|$|E
25|$|We have {{no doubt}} that if the Legislature of this State should {{undertake}} to proscribe for any offense against its laws the punishment of burning at the stake, breaking at the wheel, etc., it would be the duty of the courts to pronounce upon such attempt the condemnation of the Constitution. The question now to be answered is whether the legislative act here assailed is subject to the same condemnation. Certainly, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>so</b> on its face, for, although the mode of death described is conceded to be unusual, there is no common knowledge or consent that it is cruel; {{it is a question of}} fact whether an electric current of sufficient intensity and skillfully applied will produce death without unnecessary suffering.|$|E

25|$|In this {{approach}} the so-called earlier 'rhythmic' manuscripts of unheightened neumes that carry {{a wealth of}} melo-rhythmic information but not of exact pitches, are compared in large tables of comparison with relevant later 'melodic' manuscripts' that are written on lines or use double alphabetic and neumes notation over the text, but as a rule have less rhythmic refinement compared to the earlier group. However, the comparison {{between the two groups}} has made it possible to correct what are obvious mistakes. In other instances <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>so</b> easy to find a consensus. In 1984 Chris Hakkennes published his own transcription of the Graduale Triplex. He devised a new graphic adaptation of square notation 'simplex' in which he integrated the rhythmic indications of the two most relevant sources, that of Laon and Skt. Gallen.|$|E
25|$|The self {{is found}} to be a cause of force, free in its action, on the ground that we are obliged to relate the {{volition}} of consciousness to the self as its cause, and its ultimate cause. It is not clear from the analysis whether the self is immediately observed as an acting or originating cause, or whether reflection working on the principle of causality is compelled to infer its existence and character. If self is actually so given, we do not need the principle of causality to infer it; if <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>so</b> given, causality could never give us either the notion or the fact of self as a cause or force, far less as an ultimate one. All that it could do would be to warrant a cause of some sort, but not this or that reality as the cause. And further, the principle of causality, if fairly carried out, as universal and necessary, would not allow us to stop at personality or will as the ultimate cause of its effect—volition. Once applied to the facts at all, it would drive us beyond the first antecedent or term of antecedents of volition to a still further cause or ground—in fact, land us in an infinite regress of causes.|$|E

[...] The sundial, another early clock, relies on shadows to provide a good estimate of the hour on a sunny day. [...] <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>so</b> useful in cloudy weather or at night and requires recalibration as the seasons change (if the gnomon was not aligned with the Earth's axis).|$|E
500|$|Ponsford {{simultaneously}} {{retired from}} baseball and cricket in 1934. In his newspaper column, {{he said that}} he liked both sports equally. He felt that baseball gave a player more opportunities to perform: [...] "In cricket you may have the bad luck to get out early; which often means a blank afternoon. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>so</b> with baseball; you are in the game all the time." [...] Joe Clark, the author of History of Australian Baseball, said [...] "Ponsford is {{considered by many to be}} the best baseballer of his time in Australia." [...] The official program for the 1952 Claxton Shield—held in Perth—made a similar claim.|$|E
500|$|A {{misconception}} circulated at {{the time}} that the painting had been inspired by Swinburne's poem. In a letter to a newspaper, Whistler refuted this, while still showing his respect for Swinburne's work; [...] "those lines" [...] he wrote [...] "were only written, in my studio, after the picture was painted. And the writing of them was a rare and graceful tribute from the poet to the painter – a noble recognition of work by the production of a nobler one." [...] Swinburne repaid the compliment: [...] "...whatever merit my song may have, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>so</b> complete in beauty, in tenderness and significance, in exquisite execution and delicate strength, as Whistler's picture..." ...|$|E

500|$|Bridge {{topology}} is {{an important}} topology with many uses in both linear and non-linear applications, including, amongst many others, the bridge rectifier, the Wheatstone bridge and the lattice phase equaliser. [...] There are several ways that bridge topology is rendered in circuit diagrams. [...] The first rendering in figure 1.8 is the traditional depiction of a bridge circuit. [...] The second rendering clearly shows the equivalence between the bridge topology and a topology derived by series and parallel combinations. [...] The third rendering is more commonly known as lattice topology. [...] <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>so</b> obvious that this is topologically equivalent. [...] It {{can be seen that}} this is indeed so by visualising the top left node moved {{to the right of the}} top right node.|$|E
500|$|Edgar Allan Poe {{was very}} close to his brother, as he wrote: [...] "there can be no tie more strong than that of brother for brother — <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>so</b> much that they love one another as that they both love the same parent." [...] Edgar {{occasionally}} used the alias [...] "Henri Le Rennet", a French version of his older brother's name. He was also inspired by his brother Henry's travels, often incorporating some of his stories from overseas into tellings of his own life story. The character of August Barnard in Edgar's novel The Narrative of Arthur Gordon Pym of Nantucket (1838) seems to be inspired by Henry, especially in his travels across the sea and his drinking. Poe may have also transformed his brother's name into the title character in his poem [...] "Lenore".|$|E
500|$|The {{extensive}} use of forest roads through conifer plantations has been another criticism: {{the authors of the}} Lonely Planet guidebook, Walking in Ireland, found, [...] "The Way's one shortcoming is the character of the walking [...] you'll become all too familiar with forest tracks and roads through conifer plantations [...] where they're surrounded by tall, dense forest they're not particularly interesting". Similarly, Paul Gosling, who walked the Way for The Independent, found that, [...] "While the long distance path is, on occasion, very attractive, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>so</b> much hazardous as unadventurous. [...] Over the next four and a half days, we lost our enthusiasm for conifers [...] The views were restricted and there was little sign of wildlife". In The Irish Times John G. O'Dwyer described them as [...] "gloomy trails through invading armies of monoculture [...] as memorable as a motorway median".|$|E
