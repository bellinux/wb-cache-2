6000|$|The sheets {{dropped from}} his hand. Very slowly he was {{grasping}} the appalling fact {{that on the}} floor beside his chair lay the life or death of yet another man; that by taking this confession he had taken into his own hands the fate of the vagabond lying under sentence of death; that he could not give him back his life without incurring the smirch of this disgrace, without even endangering himself. If he let this confession reach the authorities, he could never escape the gravest suspicion that he had known of the whole affair during these two months. He would have to attend the inquest, be recognised by that policeman as having come to the archway to see where the body had lain, as having visited the girl the very evening after the murder. Who would believe in the mere coincidence of such visits {{on the part of the}} murderer's brother. But apart from that suspicion, the fearful scandal which so sensational an affair must make would mar his career, his life, his young daughter's life! Larry's suicide with this girl would make sensation enough as it was; but nothing to that other. Such a death had its romance; involved him in no way save as a mourner, could perhaps even be hushed up! The other--nothing could hush that up, nothing prevent its ringing to the house-tops. He got up from his chair, and for many minutes roamed the room unable to get his mind to bear on the issue. Images kept starting up before him. The face of the man who handed him wig and gown each morning, puffy and curious, with a leer on it he had never noticed before; his young daughter's lifted eyebrows, mouth drooping, eyes troubled; the tiny gilt crucifix <b>glinting</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> hollow of the dead girl's arm; the sightless look in Larry's unclosed eyes; even his own thumb and finger pulling the lids down. And then he saw a street and endless people passing, turning to stare at him. And, stopping in his tramp, he said aloud: [...] "Let them go to hell! Seven days' wonder!" [...] Was he not trustee to that confession! Trustee! After all he had done nothing to be ashamed of, even if he had kept knowledge dark. A brother! Who could blame him? And he picked up those sheets of paper. But, like a great murky hand, the scandal spread itself about him; its coarse malignant voice seemed shouting: [...] "Paiper!... Paiper!... Glove Lane Murder!... Suicide and confession of brother of well-known K.C..... Well-known K.C.'s brother.... Murder and suicide.... Paiper!" [...] Was he to let loose that flood of foulness?

Angular glint {{is a key}} factor <b>in</b> <b>the</b> generation loss probability in radar detections, and the intrinsic physical characteristic and suppression techniques of glint have been a hot topic in radar signal analysis. <b>In</b> this paper, <b>the</b> radar angular glint samples of a typical complex target are calculated by the Greco method based on Phase Gradient method. The simulated glint series fit the prerequisites of chaos for deterministic, nonlinear generation and no regularities in time domain, therefore the analysis the chaotic traits is required.

40|$|Glint, the {{specular}} reflection of sunlight off Earth's oceans, may reveal {{the presence of}} oceans on an extrasolar planet. As an Earth-like planet nears crescent phases, {{the size of the}} ocean glint spot increases relative to the fraction of illuminated disk, while the reflectivity of this spot increases. Both effects change the planet's visible reflectivity as a function of phase. However, strong forward scattering of radiation by clouds can also produce increases in a planet's reflectivity as it approaches crescent phases, and surface glint can be obscured by Rayleigh scattering and atmospheric absorption. Here we explore <b>the</b> detectability of <b>glint</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> presence of an atmosphere and realistic phase-dependent scattering from oceans and clouds. We use the NASA Astrobiology Institute's Virtual Planetary Laboratory 3 -D line-by-line, multiple-scattering spectral Earth model to simulate Earth's broadband visible brightness and reflectivity over an orbit. Our validated simulations successfully reproduce phase-dependent Earthshine observations. We find that the glinting Earth can be as much as 100 % brighter at crescent phases than simulations that do not include glint, and that the effect is dependent on both orbital inclination and wavelength, where the latter dependence is caused by Rayleigh scattering limiting sensitivity to the surface. We show that this phenomenon may be observable using the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) paired with an external occulter.

30|$|Szpak and Tapamo [4] {{introduce}} {{an approach}} that uses level set methods {{as a way to}} track detected maritime objects in a scene. Object detection is implemented using a modified method of single Gaussian background subtraction. Where normal background subtraction deals with pixels in isolation, spatial-smoothness constraint is enforced to deal with neighbourhoods of pixels. The constraint assumes that real-world objects are spatially consistent entities and requires that a whole group of pixels, rather than single ones, exhibit motion behaviour before marking them as such. The output of this method is further segmented using level set methods. The contour is used <b>in</b> <b>the</b> tracking phase as described by Bertalmio et al. [29], where the final contour from the previous frame is used as an initial contour <b>in</b> <b>the</b> next. The algorithm was tested in 17 test sequences and showed promising results. It was able to successfully track in all but three of the 17 given sequences. The algorithm even showed good results in overcast and rainy conditions. It failed in sequences where there was insufficient contrast between the ocean and the target and thus fails to pick up specific motion of the target, when the target moves too slowly and is thus considered part of the background and when {{there is a lot of}} <b>glint</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> scene. Due to its high success rate and possible avenues for improvement, it was decided to base further work on <b>the</b> model proposed <b>in</b> [4].|$|R

Analysis of <b>the</b> images <b>in</b> conjunction with ancillary data confirmed that the ocean features were bathymetric signatures.

40|$|Rhinolophidae or Horseshoe bats emit {{long and}} {{narrowband}} calls. Fluttering insect prey generates echoes in which amplitude and frequency shifts are present, i. e. glints. These glints are reliable cues {{about the presence}} of prey and also encode certain properties of <b>the</b> prey. <b>In</b> this paper, we propose that these glints, i. e. the dominant glints, are also reliable signals upon which to base prey localization. <b>In</b> contrast to <b>the</b> spectral cues used by many other bats, <b>the</b> localization cues <b>in</b> Rhinolophidae are most likely provided by self-induced amplitude modulations generated by pinnae movement. Amplitude variations <b>in</b> <b>the</b> echo not introduced by the moving pinnae can be considered as noise interfering with the localization process. The amplitude of the dominant glints is very stable. Therefore, these parts of the echoes contain very little noise. However, using only the dominant glints potentially comes at a cost. Depending on the flutter rate of the insect, a limited number of dominant glints will be present in each echo giving the bat a limited number of sample points on which to base localization. We evaluate the feasibility of a strategy under which Rhinolophidae use only dominant glints. We use a computational model of the echolocation task faced by Rhinolophidae. Our model includes the spatial filtering of the echoes by the morphology of the sonar apparatus of Rhinolophus rouxii as well as the amplitude modulations introduced by pinnae movements.

Cars slither by, <b>glinting</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> sun. The valley echoes with camera clicks. Tourists stream into grocery stores and souvenir shops.

Yosemite Valley, the park's population center, exemplifies {{the tension between the}} two. My research examines this ideological conflict through the lens of youth counterculture. Like many other places, Yosemite experienced some form of turmoil during the late 1960 s. Much of this was related to increased visitation. Expecting a refuge from urban life, visitors instead found traffic, noise, and air pollution. Worst of all, they found an influx of hippie visitors who irritated park rangers and visitors alike. That irritation boiled over on July 4, 1970, when hippies and park authorities clashed in Stoneman Meadow. As a result, the park began refusing entrance to youths, especially those with long hair or vans. In the words of the Berkeley Tribe weekly, Yosemite had become ‚Äúan occupied zone. ‚Äù The Stoneman riot carries larger implications {{for the study of the}} American West. National park tourism is often viewed as a distinctive part of American identity, promoting self-sufficiency, ruggedness, and family values. Yet places like Yosemite also offered an escape from these norms. Although federally owned, national parks symbolized escape from the moral authority of civilization. Campgrounds allowed hippies to form and reform communal living situations overnight. Tourism is a pliable construct, capable of accommodating disparate moral and political factions.

This is primarily {{due to the fact that}} such systems require calibration. <b>In</b> this thesis <b>the</b> various aspects that comprise an eye gaze tracker are investigated. From that we developed an eye gaze tracker for automobiles that does not require calibration. We used a monocular camera system with IR light sources placed <b>in</b> each of <b>the</b> three mirrors. The camera system created the bright-pupil effect for robust pupil detection and tracking. We developed an SVM based algorithm for initial eye candidate detection; after that the eyes were tracked using a hybrid Kalman/Mean-shift algorithm. From the tracked pupils, various features such as the location of <b>the</b> <b>glints</b> (reflections <b>in</b> <b>the</b> pupil from the IR light sources) were extracted. This information is then fed into a Generalized Regression Neural Network (GRNN). The GRNN then maps this information into one of thirteen gaze regions <b>in</b> <b>the</b> vehicle. ...|$|R
40|$|Remote sensing {{has become}} an {{important}} tool for monitoring the Earths environment. Considerable climate changes will probably take place <b>in</b> <b>the</b> nearest future, especially around the polar areas. To {{be able to use}} satellite images of the polar regions, the atmospheres composition and the spectral properties of the ground will have to be examined. This has already been performed for large parts of the Earth, but not <b>in</b> <b>the</b> same extent <b>in</b> polar and sub-polar areas as <b>in</b> <b>the</b> equatorial regions. <b>The</b> work described <b>in</b> this report {{is a part of the}} Nordkalotten Satellite Evaluation co-operation Network (NorSEN). The main goal for project NorSEN is the establishing of a network for satellite data validation <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Arctic and sub-Arctic regions. For reaching this goal NorSEN includes stations for performing spectral measurements on different sites within the sub-Arctic region. One of these stations is described and evaluated here. The main purpose of this report is to process, analyse and evaluate data from ground based measurements. This, to be able to use <b>the</b> data <b>in</b> later comparison with satellite data. To perform ground based measurements a raft was placed on lake Tornetr√§sk, which lies <b>in</b> <b>the</b> sub-Arctic region <b>in</b> Sweden‚Äôs northern parts, during three months <b>in</b> <b>the</b> late summer 2005. The raft was equipped with three spectrometers for measuring downwelling irradiance from the sky, downwelling radiance from a small part of the sky and upwelling radiance from a column of water <b>in</b> <b>the</b> lake. Tornetr√§sk is a large and very clear lake with not much pollution and was therefore selected to be a possible reference surface for satellite image validation. Issues like sun glint, weather, waves, shadows and particle flows into the lake were investigated. The reflectance, i. e. the amount of incoming radiation reflected from somewhere inside the water column, was studied since it can be compared to spectral satellite data. Particle flows into the lake clearly effected the reflectance and it also differed between clear and cloudy days. The waves did not seem to effect the measurements as much as expected. But, as it was hard to determine whether the waves caused errors <b>in</b> <b>the</b> data or not, some data was excluded. To compensate for sun <b>glint</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> analysis turned out to be a complicated process, and has to be further investigated. <b>The</b> work <b>in</b> this thesis establishes a foundation for future research within satellite image validation in polar and sub-polar regions.
