25|$|Point-and-click {{adventure}} {{games are}} those where the player typically controls their character through a point-and-click interface {{using a computer}} mouse or similar pointing device, though additional control schemes may also be available. The player clicks to move their character around, interact with non-player characters, often initiating conversation trees with them, examine objects in the game's settings or with their character's item inventory. Many point-and-click games would include a list of on-screen verbs to describe specific actions {{in the manner of}} a text adventure, but newer games have used more context-sensitive user interface elements to reduce or eliminate this approach. Often, these games come down to collecting items for the character's inventory, and figuring where is the right time to use that item; the player would need to use clues from the visual elements of the game, descriptions of the various items, and dialogue from other characters to <b>figure</b> <b>this</b> <b>out.</b> Later games developed by Sierra Online including the King's Quest games, and nearly all of the LucasArts adventure games, are point-and-click based games.|$|E
500|$|In 2002, Rick and Laura Brown, two sculptors from Massachusetts, {{along with}} Massachusetts College of Art and Design {{students}} and faculty, constructed another replica. The Browns {{set out to}} gain a better understanding of human ingenuity while keeping Bushnell’s design, materials, and technique authentic. “With it, Yankee ingenuity was born,” observed Rick Brown, referring to the latest in a long line of commemoration that perceived the Turtle as something authentically American. Of the temptation to use synthetic and ahistorical materials, Rob Duarte, a MassArts student observed, “It was always a temptation to use silicone to seal the thing," [...] says Rob Duarte, a MassArt student. [...] "Then you realized that someone else had to <b>figure</b> <b>this</b> <b>out</b> with the same limited resources that we were using. That's just an interesting way to learn. You can't do it any other way than by actually doing it.” The outer shell of the replica was hallowed, using controlled fire, from a twelve-foot Sitka Spruce. The log was seven feet in diameter and shipped from British Columbia. This replica took twelve days to build and was successfully submerged in water. In 2003, it was tested in an indoor test tank at the United States Naval Academy. Lew Nuckols, a professor of Ocean Engineering at USNA, made ten dives, noting “you feel very isolated from the outside world. If you had any sense of claustrophobia it would not be a very good experience.” ...|$|E

Matsuzaka gained his first win {{of the season}} against the Detroit Tigers on June 2, 2009, but failed to produce any quality starts. After a loss against the Atlanta Braves on June 19, 2009, Matsuzaka was once again placed on the disabled list. Red Sox manager Terry Francona stated that Matsuzaka {{was placed on the}} DL due to [...] "weakness" [...] in his throwing arm possibly caused by the extensive pitching he did in the World Baseball Classic. Francona also made it clear {{that it would not be}} a [...] "two-week DL" [...] stating [...] "We're going to have to <b>figure</b> <b>this</b> <b>out.</b> We have a lot of work ahead of us trying to get him back to being Daisuke." ...|$|E
2500|$|For these reasons, Scalia {{argued that}} the {{proportionality}} test from Solem should be overruled. [...] Solem had held that a particular punishment was unconstitutionally disproportional if (1) the crime was relatively minor {{in comparison to the}} punishment, (2) the sentence imposed in the jurisdiction for similarly grave offenses was less, and (3) other jurisdictions impose a lesser sentence for the same crime. Scalia argued that (1) it was difficult to assess the gravity of a particular crime, and thus (2) {{it would be difficult to}} determine whether similarly grave crimes carried a lesser sentence. As for whether other jurisdictions imposed a lesser sentence for the same crime, Scalia conceded that it is easy to <b>figure</b> <b>this</b> <b>out,</b> but that this inquiry has [...] "no conceivable relevance to the Eighth Amendment." [...] If a mode of punishment was [...] "unusual" [...] because it was infrequently imposed, the three factors of the Solem test hardly mattered to Scalia. In a federal system, moreover, some state will always have the distinction of imposing the harshest punishment for a particular crime. [...] "The Eighth Amendment is not a ratchet, whereby a temporary consensus on leniency for a particular crime fixes a permanent constitutional maximum, disabling the States from giving effect to altered beliefs and responding to changed social conditions." [...] Because the proportionality requirement was of recent vintage, [...] "issued 185 years after the Eighth Amendment was adopted," [...] and then only in capital cases, Scalia reasoned it should be abandoned entirely, or at least limited only to capital cases.|$|E

50|$|Evil is {{much like}} Death in its manner of {{transferring}} power, though with one major exception: It has a break-in period and accompanying test. One becomes the Incarnation of Evil by vanquishing the previous Incarnation, but after {{that there is a}} 30-day trial period, where the new Incarnation must learn the secret of controlling demons - namely, that mortals can't control demons and the only way through is to bluff.

30|$|Whether one regards {{these results}} as a {{consequence}} of evolution or merely of a set of changes, one should ask: Why did it take 60  years and more – from 1915 or 1930 until 1990 and beyond – for the patterns shown in the right panels of Figs.  2, 3, and 4 to appear?
