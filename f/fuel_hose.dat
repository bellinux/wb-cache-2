The turbojet engine was removed and the <b>fuel</b> <b>hose</b> and its drogue extended {{out from the}} jet's former exhaust opening. Aircraft in service retained the turbojet and had their bomb bay doors modified to accommodate the hose and drogue. They were refueling aircraft during late 1954.|$|E
25|$|The hoses are {{color-coded}} {{for visual}} identification. The {{color of the}} hoses varies between countries. In the United States, the oxygen hose is green, and the <b>fuel</b> <b>hose</b> is red. In the UK and other countries, the oxygen hose is blue (black hoses may still be found on old equipment), and the acetylene (<b>fuel)</b> <b>hose</b> is red. If liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) fuel, such as propane, is used, the <b>fuel</b> <b>hose</b> should be orange, indicating that it is compatible with LPG. LPG will damage an incompatible hose, including most acetylene hoses.|$|E
25|$|A recall {{was issued}} in 1995, {{regarding}} <b>fuel</b> <b>hose</b> fitting issues. Over 400 models had this defect which {{was caused by}} variances in temperature and environment. Another recall was issued {{in relation to the}} passive restraint system on seat belts not functioning properly, on over 2,000 512TR's. If the restraint system suffered a mechanical or electrical failure only the lap belt would provide the occupant protection.|$|E
50|$|The burner {{and fuel}} system {{must also be}} kept clean to ensure safe {{operation}} on demand. Damaged <b>fuel</b> <b>hoses</b> need to be replaced. Stuck or leaky valves must be repaired or replaced. The wicker basket may require occasional refinishing or repair. The skids on its bottom may require occasional replacement.|$|R
5000|$|Fifteen fleet {{replenishment}} oilers, {{the largest}} subset of Naval Fleet Auxiliary Force ships, provide fuel to deployed Navy ships at sea, {{as well as}} to their assigned aircraft. Oilers and the ships they refuel sail side by side as <b>fuel</b> <b>hoses</b> are extended across guide wires. Underway replenishment of fuel dramatically extends the time a Navy battle group can remain at sea. The fifteen ships of the oiler fleet are as follows: ...|$|R
2500|$|The hoses are {{designed}} for use in welding and cutting metal. A double-hose or twinned design can be used, meaning that the oxygen and <b>fuel</b> <b>hoses</b> are joined together. If separate hoses are used, they should be clipped together at intervals approximately [...] apart, although that is not recommended for cutting applications, because beads of molten metal given off by the process can become lodged between the hoses where they are held together, and burn through, releasing the pressurised gas inside, which {{in the case of}} fuel gas usually ignites.|$|R
25|$|Some {{historic}} systems {{used for}} pioneering aerial refueling used the grappling method, where the tanker aircraft unreeled the <b>fuel</b> <b>hose</b> and the receiver aircraft would grapple the hose midair, reel {{it in and}} connect it so that fuel can be transferred either {{with the assistance of}} pumps or simply by gravity feed. This was the method used on the Question Mark endurance flight in 1929.|$|E
25|$|During the , Räikkönen {{qualified}} {{fourth and}} lost {{a place at}} the start to Kovalainen. He stayed fifth until the second round of pitstops when he exited before the <b>fuel</b> <b>hose</b> was properly disengaged from his car and left one of the mechanics with a fractured toe. Two laps later, he suffered a similar engine failure to Massa in the previous race; a connecting rod in his engine broke and he was forced to retire.|$|E
25|$|On March 18, 2010, Holden {{issued a}} recall for 9,098 {{petrol-engined}} 2010 model year Cruzes in Australia and a further 485 in New Zealand over a faulty <b>fuel</b> <b>hose.</b> According to Holden, some hoses on 1.8-liter cars {{had developed a}} leakage, although no accidents or injuries had been reported prior to the recall. The recall followed a stop-delivery notice issued by Holden to its dealers on March 3 while the automaker conducted {{an investigation into the}} matter.|$|E
50|$|Studies {{published}} in 1930 written independently by Lebedev, the American Wallace Carothers and the German scientist Hermann Staudinger led in 1931 {{to one of}} the first successful synthetic rubbers, known as neoprene, which was developed at DuPont under the direction of E.K. Bolton. Neoprene is highly resistant to heat and chemicals such as oil and gasoline, and is used in <b>fuel</b> <b>hoses</b> and as an insulating material in machinery. The company Thiokol applied their name to a competing type of rubber based on ethylene dichloride which was commercially available in 1930.|$|R

25|$|Felipe Massa stalled on the grid, {{leading to}} a second {{formation}} lap and causing the Brazilian to start from the pit lane, joining Takuma Sato, who also started from the pits. Hamilton led from the start with Räikkönen closely following and Alonso a few seconds behind them. Hamilton led the race until lap sixteen, {{when he made his}} stop and rejoined in fifth; his car briefly lurched forward with the <b>fuel</b> <b>hose</b> attached when Hamilton reacted to the 'lollipop' board being turned over. Räikkönen stopped three laps later and came out of the pit in front of Hamilton to take the race lead. Another three laps later Alonso took a good pit stop and came out in front of both of the previous race leaders.|$|E
25|$|On 5 May 1998, a {{flexible}} <b>fuel</b> <b>hose</b> in the ship's engine room burst. The spraying fuel ignited {{when it came}} into contact with hot machinery, and the first-response extinguishers were unable to cope with the fire's intensity. It took two hours for the fire to be extinguished, and four sailors died from carbon monoxide poisoning. A Board of Inquiry reported in December that a different type of hose inappropriate for an engine-room environment was fitted, the civilian contractors that fitted the hose had not passed the configuration changes to the Lloyd's Register classification society as required, and that personnel aboard Westralia did not have the training and qualifications required for their responsibilities. Repairs and modifications were made to the ship, and she returned to operational service during 2000.|$|E
25|$|In Singapore, {{the first}} night event in Formula One history, Räikkönen {{qualified}} third behind Massa and Hamilton. He remained in this position {{for most of the}} early laps. On lap 14, Nelson Piquet Jr.'s Renault hit the wall at turn 17 and the safety car was deployed. Both Ferrari drivers pitted during the safety car period, with Räikkönen queued behind Massa in a busy pitlane. Ferrari released Massa before the <b>fuel</b> <b>hose</b> was disconnected from the car, which compromised Räikkönen who rejoined in 16th. Räikkönen managed to climb to fifth place, but on lap 57, while attacking Timo Glock, he hit the wall after pushing too hard at turn 10 and retired. He set the fastest lap of the race as his tenth of the season. This equalled Michael Schumacher's 2004 record of ten fastest laps in a Formula One season.|$|E
5000|$|The {{following}} day found the oiler still off Lunga, pumping aviation gasoline to tanks ashore. At 1130, the ship received an air raid alert for a Japanese attack expected at 1245. Fifteen minutes later, Tappahannock intercepted a dispatch ordering all {{ships in the}} vicinity to get underway immediately. The oiler disconnected her <b>fueling</b> <b>hose</b> and quickly got underway, in company with destroyers [...] and [...] The trio then proceeded through the Lunga Channel at their best sustained smokeless speed of 17 knots. Unknowingly the American sailors were steaming directly {{in the path of}} a segment of Admiral Isoroku Yamamoto's force as he made his last thrust against the American Navy in the Solomon Islands.|$|R
5000|$|Their {{contributions}} to the victory, however, have been considered overstated in some cases. Historians agree that Clark's Lotus-Ford was capable of winning the race handily without the added help of the Wood Brothers. In fact, the only work done on the cars was routine refueling, as they {{did not need to}} change tires during the race. Clark made only two stops all day, and the quickness of the refueling process was largely attributed to a specially-designed gravity fueling rig with a venturi tube. One of the things they did ahead of time was to [...] "break in" [...] the new <b>fueling</b> <b>hose</b> nozzles by simply working them {{in and out of the}} coupling for a period of time.|$|R
25|$|The {{threaded}} connectors on the hoses are handed to avoid accidental mis-connection: the thread on the oxygen hose is right-handed (as normal), while the <b>fuel</b> gas <b>hose</b> has a left-handed thread. The left-handed threads {{also have an}} identifying groove cut into their nuts.|$|R
25|$|On lap 44 Timo Glock ran wide {{onto the}} grass and {{the bottom of his}} car hit two {{substantial}} bumps, the second of which caused it to briefly fly {{up in the air and}} land with force sufficient to break the suspension, leaving the monocoque in contact with the ground and unable to be stopped, resulting in a sizable accident. Glock spun twice and came to rest against the wall further down the track. He was forced to retire and the safety car came out for a third time. On the same lap, due to a false signal from the chief mechanic, Barrichello left a pit stop before the <b>fuel</b> <b>hose</b> had been removed from his car. Several mechanics suffered minor injuries. He would also serve a ten-second penalty for this pit stop as it was taken while the pit lane was closed. Ultimately he was disqualified for exiting the pitlane when the red light was on.|$|E
25|$|Jamie Whincup and Paul Dumbrell {{dominated}} the Wilson Security Sandown 500, securing pole position and leading 150 of the 161 laps {{on their way}} to victory. The two Holden Racing Team cars filled the podium, with James Courtney and Greg Murphy finishing ahead of Garth Tander and Warren Luff. Mark Winterbottom fell to third in the championship standings behind Craig Lowndes, after Winterbottom and Steve Owen could only finish tenth while Lowndes and Steven Richards finished fourth. Lee Holdsworth had a high-speed crash when his car suffered a mechanical failure {{at the end of the}} back straight, resulting in heavy contact with the tyre barrier. A wheel was torn off in the accident, which was collected by Jason Bright, forcing he and Andrew Jones out of the race. The only other retirement was the car of James Moffat and Taz Douglas, whose car was retired when the team were unable to disconnect the <b>fuel</b> <b>hose</b> from the car during their first pit stop.|$|E
500|$|In October 2006, Holden {{introduced}} a bi-fuel {{version of the}} Alloytec V6, available to the Omega and Berlina. Able to run on both petrol and LPG, it features an advanced sequential vapour gas injection (SVGI) system and hardened valve seats to cope. The bi-fuel V6 produces [...] and [...] less than the conventional V6 when run on LPG, {{for a total of}} [...] Although LPG prices are lower, the engine uses a large [...] cylindrical gas tank which causes decreased boot space and slightly increased fuel consumption. Holden was {{able to take advantage of}} a loophole in government legislation, allowing an A$2,000 rebate on LPG installation because the unit is fitted post-production by Holden's customisation arm HSVi. Normally, people would only be entitled to a A$1,000 rebate for new cars pre-installed with LPG. Due to the possibility that these bi-fuel Commodores may have been fitted with undersized O-rings in the service valve hand tap, Holden issued a recall affecting the first 981 of these models on 10 April 2007. There were also two VE recalls previous to this. The initial 16 October 2006 recall affecting 1,521 V8 Commodore and WM Statesman/Caprice models involved a faulty <b>fuel</b> <b>hose,</b> causing a fuel smell to enter the cabin. A second 10 November 2006 recall affecting 12,830 Commodores and WM models built prior to 11 September 2006 resulted from defective rear seat belt anchors. On 7 December 2007, another recall was issued for over 86,000 VE and WM V6 models. This was due to the possibility that one of the fuel lines in the engine compartment may have a rub condition with a fuel vapour hose clip, possibly causing a fuel smell to become evident.|$|E
500|$|McClusky's {{decision}} {{to continue the}} search and his judgment, {{in the opinion of}} Admiral Chester Nimitz, [...] "decided the fate of our carrier task force and our forces at Midway..." [...] All three American dive-bomber squadrons (VB-6, VS-6 and VB-3) arrived almost simultaneously at the perfect time, locations and altitudes to attack. Most of the Japanese CAP was focusing on the torpedo planes of VT-3 and were out of position, armed Japanese strike aircraft filled the hangar decks, <b>fuel</b> <b>hoses</b> snaked across the decks as refueling operations were hastily being completed, and the repeated change of ordnance meant that bombs and torpedoes were stacked around the hangars, rather than stowed safely in the magazines, making the Japanese carriers extraordinarily vulnerable.|$|R
5000|$|On November 27, 1929, Evelyn [...] "Bobbi" [...] Trout and Elinor Smith {{took off}} from Metropolitan Airport in a Commercial Sunbeam biplane {{in an attempt to}} set an {{official}} record for a refueled endurance flight by women. A Carrier Pigeon was used as the tanker aircraft, which refueled the Sunbeam 3 1/2 times. The Sunbeam was to be refueled in early morning and before sunset. Refueling went well. With shifts of four hours each, two days passed. By Thanksgiving Day, they had been up for 39 hours. While refueling, the Carrier Pigeon began trailing black smoke. Trout quickly tossed the <b>fueling</b> <b>hose</b> over the side as Smith maneuvered away from the ailing Carrier Pigeon. It landed, and the fliers emerged safely.|$|R
50|$|Alongside {{connected}} replenishment {{is a risky}} operation, as two {{or three}} ships running side-by-side at speed must hold to precisely the same course and speed {{for a long period}} of time. Moreover, the hydrodynamics of two ships running close together cause a suction between them. A slight steering error on the part of one of the ships could cause a collision, or part the transfer lines and <b>fuel</b> <b>hoses.</b> At a speed of 12 knots, a 1 degree variation in heading will produce a lateral speed of around 20 feet per minute. For this reason, experienced and qualified helmsmen are required during the replenishment, and the crew on the bridge must give their undivided attention to the ship's course and speed. The risk is increased when a replenishment ship is servicing two ships at once.|$|R
500|$|The Benetton and Williams {{teams were}} {{employing}} different pit stop strategies – the Benetton team were planning a threestop strategy whereas the Williams team were only planning for twostops. Schumacher made a pit stop on lap18, but was momentarily baulked by the slowing Jordan car of Barrichello {{as he was}} entering the pitlane. Schumacher exited the stop behind Berger, but overtook the Austrian driver {{at the beginning of}} the next lap. Hill, who had remained close behind Schumacher before the German made a pit stop, made his own stop on lap21, exiting the pitlane in front of Schumacher. Coulthard took the lead of the race for one lap, before pitting and dropping behind the two leaders and the yet-to-stop Häkkinen and Berger. Häkkinen and Berger were the final drivers of the leading teams to pit, however, the McLaren mechanics had trouble getting the <b>fuel</b> <b>hose</b> off the Finn's car when he stopped on lap23, losing him tenseconds. Several other teams experienced problems with attaching and detaching the refuelling nozzles, and occasional small sprays of fuel were observed, reinforcing the problem experienced by McLaren with the equipment before the race meeting. Berger, adopting a strategy of pitting late, was the only driver not to have stopped by lap24 and thus was third, with Hill, Schumacher, Coulthard, Alesi and Salo the other drivers in the top six places. Salo's stop had been faultless, gaining him significant time on those drivers who had been running in front of him. By this stage Gachot had retired his Pacific car after it got stuck in fifth gear. Berger made his stop on lap 27, but had problems leaving the pit lane after a communication problem between him and his mechanics nearly led to him leaving the pit lane with a loose wheel nut on the front right-hand wheel. The pit [...] "lollipop", signalling the driver when to leave, was raised and lowered again in quick succession, preventing Berger from leaving until the wheel nut was sufficiently tightened. The miscommunication cost Berger 13seconds, dropping him back to seventhposition. Alesi fell behind Salo and Häkkinen after the firstset of pitstops, Salo overtaking him on lap25, with Häkkinen moving past threelaps later as Alesi was held up behind the lapped Montermini.|$|E
2500|$|A new Atlantic-Fokker C-2A transport, {{serial number}} 28-120, was {{selected}} for the project. Assigned to the 14th Bombardment Squadron at Bolling Field, it was flown to Middletown Air Depot, Pennsylvania, for modifications. The C-2A was an American-built military version of the Fokker F.VIIa-3m Trimotor, a high-wing monoplane with a gross weight of , re-engined with three Wright R-790 motors producing [...] each. A C-2 variant nicknamed the Bird of Paradise had made the first transpacific flight to Hawaii the year before and proven the capability of the design. The C-2A had an internal fuel capacity of [...] {{in a pair of}} wing tanks, and for the project two [...] tanks were installed in the cargo cabin. A hatch was cut in the roof of the C-2 behind the wing for transfer of the <b>fuel</b> <b>hose</b> and passage of supplies from the tanker to the receiver. 72-octane aviation gasoline would be received in [...] increments of approximately 90 seconds duration.|$|E
2500|$|The {{following}} lap, {{an accident}} involving Adrian Sutil and Nick Heidfeld necessitated {{the deployment of}} the Safety Car to remove debris from the track. Sutil spun attempting to pass Jaime Alguersuari {{on the inside of}} Turn 14 and, with his car facing the wrong way, attempted to rejoin the circuit as Heidfeld was taking the corner, causing a collision that forced both cars to retire, Heidfeld's first non finish since the 2007 United States Grand Prix. Sutil was later reprimanded and fined $20,000 by stewards for dangerous driving. [...] Most cars that had thus far not pitted for fuel and tyres did so under the Safety Car conditions, including both Brawn cars. The Safety Car did not benefit Rosberg, as Formula One regulations prevent a drive-through penalty being served under Safety Car conditions, meaning he would have to stop within two laps of the restart when the field was still closely bunched. During this round of pit stops, Alguersuari repeated the infamous mistake made by Felipe Massa at the 2008 race by attempting to exit his pit garage with the <b>fuel</b> <b>hose</b> still attached.|$|E
