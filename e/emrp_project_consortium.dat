40|$|Magnetotransport {{measurements}} on Hall bar devices fabricated on purely monolayer epitaxial graphene on silicon carbide (SiC/G) show {{a very tight}} spread in carrier concentration and mobility across wafer-size dimensions.

The spread in properties among devices patterned on the same SiC/G wafer can thus be understood by considering the inhomogeneous number of layers often grown on the surface of epitaxial graphene on SiC.

40|$|We {{investigate}} Ti/Au contacts to monolayer epitaxial graphene on SiC (0001) {{for applications}} in quantum resistance metrology. Using three-terminal measurements in the quantum Hall regime we observed variations in contact resistances {{ranging from a}} minimal value of 0. 6 Omega up to 11 k Omega. We identify {{a major source of}} high-resistance contacts to be due bilayer graphene interruptions to the quantum Hall current, whilst discarding the effects of interface cleanliness and contact geometry for our fabricated devices. Moreover, we experimentally demonstrate methods to improve the reproducibility of low resistance contacts (less than 10 Omega) suitable for high precision quantum resistance metrology.

40|$|Experimental {{evidence}} from both spin-valve and quantum transport measurements points towards unexpectedly fast spin relaxation in graphene. We report magnetotransport studies of epitaxial graphene on SiC in a vector magnetic field showing that spin relaxation, detected using weak-localization analysis, is suppressed by an in-plane magnetic field B-parallel to, and thereby proving {{that it is}} caused {{at least in part}} by spinful scatterers. A nonmonotonic dependence of the effective decoherence rate on B-parallel to reveals the intricate role of the scatterers spin dynamics in forming the interference correction to the conductivity, an effect that has gone unnoticed in earlier weak localization studies.

40|$|In the {{framework}} of the <b>EMRP</b> <b>project</b> “ENV 58. Metrology for essential climate variables”, a new technique to perform traceable temperature measurements of the sea water column and sea water surface was designed and it is being studied and applied to a real situation in the submarine observatory (www. obsea. com). This new technique is based on optical fiber Bragg gratings, which implies the distribution of temperature sensors along the fiber. In the design of these distributed thermometers special attention was paid to the involved materials {{in order to avoid the}} damages of such corrosive environment. These fibers were calibrated as optical instruments and as thermometers, in order to get traceable measurements, as well as, reliable uncertainty calculation of the seawater temperature profile and of the sea water surface temperature, that are being continuously measured.

40|$|We {{find that}} {{monolayer}} epitaxial graphene devices exposed to aggressive aqueous-ozone processing and annealing became cleaner from post-fabrication organic resist residuals and, significantly, maintain their high carrier mobility. Additionally, we observe {{a decrease in}} carrier density from inherent strong n-type doping to extremely low p-type doping after processing. This transition is explained to be {{a consequence of the}} cleaning effect of aqueous-ozone processing and annealing, since the observed removal of resist residuals from SiC/G enables the exposure of the bare graphene to dopants present in ambient conditions. The resulting combination of charge neutrality, high mobility, large area clean surfaces, and susceptibility to environmental species suggest this processed graphene system as an ideal candidate for gas sensing applications.
