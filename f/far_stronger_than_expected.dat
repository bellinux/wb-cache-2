40|$|The present paper aims at elaborating a {{completely}} physical representation {{for the general}} 4 -parameter family of the extended double-Kerr spacetimes describing two spinning sources in gravitational equilibrium. This involved problem is solved in a concise analytical form by using the individual Komar masses and angular momenta as arbitrary parameters, and the simplest equatorially symmetric specialization of the general expressions obtained by us yields the physical representation for the well-known Dietz-Hoenselaers superextreme case of two balancing identical Kerr constituents. The existence of the physically meaningful "black hole-superextreme object" equilibrium configurations permitted by the general solution may {{be considered as a}} clear indication that the spin-spin repulsion force might actually be by <b>far</b> <b>stronger</b> <b>than</b> <b>expected</b> earlier, when only the balance between two superextreme Kerr sources was thought possible. We also present the explicit analytical formulas relating the equilibrium states in the double-Kerr and double-Reissner-Nordström configurations. Comment: 10 pages, 2 figures; references adde...|$|E
40|$|We present RGS {{data from}} an XMM-Newton {{observation}} of the Seyfert 1 galaxy NGC 3516, taken while the continuum source was in an extreme low state. The spectrum shows numerous emission lines including the H-like lines of C, N and O and the He-like lines of N, O and Ne. These data show that the N lines are <b>far</b> <b>stronger</b> <b>than</b> would be <b>expected</b> from gas of solar abundances. Based on our photoionization models, we find that N is overabundant compared to C, O and Ne by at least a factor of 2. 5. We suggest {{this is the result}} of secondary production of N in intermediate mass stars, and indicative of the history of star formation in NGC 3516. Comment: 19 pages, 3 color figures.

40|$|This work is {{concerned}} with the breaking of chiral symmetry in gauge theories and the associated generation of a dynamical mass scale. We investigate this phenomenon {{in the context of a}} simple model, three dimensional QED, where the complicating factor of infinite renormalisations is absent. This model possesses an intrinsic scale, set by the coupling [e(^ 2) ] = M, and it is the relationship between this and the dynamically generated mass scale that is of interest. The chiral symmetry breaking mechanism is investigated using the Schwinger Dyson equations which are then truncated in a nonperturbative manner using the Ball-Chiu vertex ansatz. The complexity of the resulting coupled fermion-photon system means that the photon is initially replaced by its perturbative form. Numerical investigations of this simplified system then reveal the existence of an exponential relationship, in terms of the dimensionless parameter N, between the intrinsic and dynamical mass scales, m ~ e(^ 2) exp(-cN). Contrary to the assertions of Appelquist et al the wavefunction renormalisation was found to be nonperturbative and crucial in determining this behaviour. The sensitivity of this mechanism to the nonperturbative behaviour of the photon is investigated. A simple analysis shows it to be <b>far</b> <b>stronger</b> <b>than</b> previously <b>expected.</b> This is confirmed by a numerical analysis of the coupled photon-fermion system which suggest the relationship between the two scales in the theory is of the form m ~ e(^ 2) exp(-cN(^ 2)). This model therefore illustrates how a large hierarchy of scales may naturally occur in a gauge theory, for instance N= 3 m/a ~ 10 (^- 5). Finally an investigation of the gauge dependence of this approach is initiated. The softening of the photon in the low momentum region is shown to amplify automatically any inadequacy of the vertex ansatz by factors of O(a/m) in all but the Landau gauge. It is therefore expected that any incomplete vertex form will result in the generation of a "critical gauge", ɛ(_e), below which chiral symmetry breaking solutions will not exist. A path of further investigation is suggested...|$|R
40|$|We present Reflection Grating Spectrometer {{data from}} an XMM-Newton {{observation}} of the Seyfert 1 galaxy NGC 3516, taken while the continuum source was in an extremely low flux state. This observation offers a rare opportunity for a detailed study of emission from a Seyfert 1 galaxy as these are usually dominated by high nuclear continuum levels and heavy absorption. The spectrum shows numerous narrow emission lines (FWHM approximately less than 1300 kilometers per second) in the 0. 3 - 2 keV range, including the H-like lines of C, N, and O and the He-like lines of N, O and Ne. The emission-line ratios and the narrow width of the radiative recombination continuum of CVI indicate that the gas is photoionized and of fairly low temperature (kT approximately less than 0. 01 keV). The availability of emission lines from different elements for two iso-electronic sequences allows us to constrain the element abundances. These data show that the N lines are <b>far</b> <b>stronger</b> <b>than</b> would be <b>expected</b> from gas of solar abundances. Based on our photoionization models we find that nitrogen is overabundant in the central regions of the galaxy, compared to carbon, oxygen and neon by at least a factor of 2. 5.

40|$|Strong output {{gains in}} {{manufacturing}} are gradually extending from basic and intermediate towards finished goods. With aggregate demand in continental Europe rebounding, net exports have risen markedly since mid-year thereby preventing a further {{rise in the}} trade deficit. However, the surplus in foreign tourism services declined as higher spending by Austrians abroad {{was accompanied by a}} fall in foreign demand. The international business cycle recovery has so <b>far</b> proved rather <b>stronger</b> <b>than</b> <b>expected</b> and is providing major stimulus to activity in Austria. Exports to North America and South East Asia are rising at double-digit annual rates, those to eastern and western Europe are gaining momentum, with the exception of sales to Germany which have recently slowed down. In all, merchandise exports rose by 7. 4 percent year-on-year in July and by 4. 7 percent in August. With exports outpacing imports (July + 4 and August + 2. 5 percent), the speedy recovery in Europe is benefiting the Austrian trade balance, keeping the deficit slightly below the level a year ago. However, the net surplus in tourism services continues to fall as exchange rate changes and cheap air fares encourage foreign travel by Austrians {{while at the same time}} dampening foreign demand. Industrial activity strengthened further during the summer, with output in the first eight months rising 4 percent over the level a year ago. Substantial gains are no longer confined to basic and intermediate goods but also concern investment manufactures and consumer durables. Order figures suggest further advances over the coming months. Following the boom early in the year, construction activity has returned to a more sustainable pace, with residential building remaining the most buoyant component. Despite household disposable incomes being boosted by tax cuts, retail sales are picking up only gradually as demand is held back by the expectation of price cuts in the context of accession to the European Union. Inflation is receding slowly, with the CPI still rising at annual rates of above 3 percent in August and September. Rents and other housing costs as well as service prices show the highest increases, cuts in regulated food prices are offset by seasonal hikes. Prices of manufactures show no sign of decelerating, despite falling unit labor costs and stable import prices, as both the pick-up in private demand and a low degree of competition in the retail sector favor a widening in profit margins. The labor market is reacting relatively quickly to the recovery of demand and output. Despite substantial efforts being made to raise productivity, employment in manufacturing has almost stopped falling and many service branches are hiring personnel. The seasonally adjusted unemployment rate, according to national definitions, was 6. 4 percent in October. Industriekonjunktur kommt in Schwung; Industrial Activity Gaining Strength...|$|R
