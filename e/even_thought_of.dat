5|$|Philosophy of {{chemistry}} is the philosophical {{study of the}} methodology {{and content of the}} science {{of chemistry}}. It is explored by philosophers, chemists, and philosopher-chemist teams. It includes research on general philosophy of science issues as applied to chemistry. For example, can all chemical phenomena be explained by quantum mechanics or is it not possible to reduce chemistry to physics? For another example, chemists have discussed the philosophy of how theories are confirmed in the context of confirming reaction mechanisms. Determining reaction mechanisms is difficult because they cannot be observed directly. Chemists can use a number of indirect measures as evidence to rule out certain mechanisms, but they are often unsure if the remaining mechanism is correct because there are many other possible mechanisms that they have not tested or <b>even</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of.</b> Philosophers have also sought to clarify the meaning of chemical concepts which do not refer to specific physical entities, such as chemical bonds.|$|E
5|$|While {{the primary}} focus is on driver safety near {{railroad}} crossings, other basic driving safety rules are reinforced, such as not passing on hills or curves, not driving or pulling over when fatigued or sleepy and not being a distracted driver. Alan is also shown a police report of an accident where an acquaintance of his had died in an accident due to his reckless driving. Filling out the film is a nostalgic {{look back at the}} early 1900s, when such things as horseless carriages were parts of everyday life and four-lane superhighways—in the late 1950s still a relatively new concept—weren't <b>even</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of,</b> and slower and less congested roadways meant fewer dangers in driving; however, Hal cautions that his point is that the human body hasn't changed and that even more attention to safety must be heeded.|$|E
25|$|Jacques {{moved to}} Buenos Aires to give free physics lectures, {{but these were}} not popular. With Alfredo Cosson, he {{traveled}} to Rosario and Entre Rios to produce daguerreotypes. In 1854, now-president Urquiza appointed him director of the land registry. He lived briefly in Córdoba and spent several years in Santiago del Estero, where he was married. He became the official surveyor of the province and conducted an expedition down the Salado River into Chaco. He also continued {{to work as a}} baker, and <b>even</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> becoming a sugarcane planter. An account of his expedition, Excursion ou Rio Salado et dans le Chaco, was published in Paris in 1857. In it, he recalled the events he had witnessed, including descriptions of the scenery and the customs of local people.|$|E

60|$|A last dance together, {{and that}} had been the end. <b>Even</b> <b>thoughts</b> <b>of</b> him would be {{forbidden}} her after this: for her thoughts were no longer free of him, her heart was no longer free; her promise belonged to Maurice, but her heart, her thoughts were no longer hers to give.|$|R
25|$|The Nobel Committee reacted almost {{immediately}} to the first successful clinical trials. In the autumn of 1923, Banting and Macleod received the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine, even though the long-term importance of the discovery was not yet apparent. They were nominated by the Danish physiologist and Nobel laureate August Krogh, who had a diabetic wife and had visited Macleod's laboratory and taken the method back to Denmark. The committee judged that Macleod's work in interpreting the data, managing the clinical trials and providing {{a high level of}} public presentation were crucial for success, so they awarded the Nobel prize to both. Banting was furious, as he was convinced that Best should have received the other half, and he <b>even</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> rejecting the prize. He was finally persuaded to accept it but gave half of his prize money to Best. Macleod in turn gave half of his to Collip. In 1972 the Nobel Foundation officially conceded that omitting Best was a mistake.|$|E
500|$|In a 1985 {{interview}} on Yorkshire Television's Arthur C. Clarke's World of Strange Powers, Elsie {{said that she}} and Frances were too embarrassed to admit the truth after fooling Doyle, the author of Sherlock Holmes: [...] "Two village kids and a brilliant man like Conan Doyle– well, we could only keep quiet." [...] In the same interview Frances said: [...] "I never <b>even</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> it as being a fraud– it was just Elsie and I having a bit of fun and I can't understand to this day why they were taken in– {{they wanted to be}} taken in." ...|$|E
500|$|Santoro was {{recommended}} by Paulo Autran, who acted {{along with him}} in the TV series Hilda Furacão. After seeing Santoro's acting, he was Bodanzky's first choice for Neto's role; [...] "I never <b>even</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> another person. ... When I saw him, I was impressed with his giving of himself to the role/character. I knew that Neto was him." [...] Santoro read the book and was [...] "shocked," [...] which led him to contact Carrano; after talking to the author, he was convinced to take the role. He found the story [...] "very moving, but kind of over the top," [...] and was worried about overacting and making the character [...] "fake." [...] To prepare himself for the role, he talked with interns and watched productions on the subject, among them the film One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest by Miloš Forman.|$|E

500|$|The {{extended}} shooting schedule owed much to {{the fact}} that scenes where ghosts and human characters interacted had to be filmed twice; once with human characters acting on set, and then with the ghost characters acting against a blue screen. The two elements would later be digitally composited into one shot with the use of split screen photography. Such sequences required precise timing from the cast as they traded dialogue with characters who were merely blank air. The hardest challenge for the digital animators at Weta was creating the Grim Reaper, which went through many transformations before finding physical form. [...] "We set out with the intention of doing the Reaper as a rod puppet, maybe shooting it in a water tank," [...] Jackson commented. [...] "We <b>even</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> filming someone, dressed in costume, at different camera speeds." [...] Test footage was shot with puppets and a man in a Reaper suit, but in the end, it was decided that using computer animation would be the easiest task. Another entirely computerized character called [...] "the Gatekeeper", a winged cherub who helps guard the cemetery, was deleted from the final cut.|$|E
500|$|Although {{only six}} {{years since the}} release of Licence to Kill, world {{politics}} had changed dramatically in the interim. GoldenEye was the first James Bond film to be produced {{since the fall of}} the Berlin Wall, the collapse of the Soviet Union, {{and the end of the}} Cold War, and therefore it was doubtful whether the character was still relevant in the modern world. Some in the film industry felt it would be [...] "futile" [...] for the Bond series to make a comeback, and that it was best left as [...] "an icon of the past". The producers <b>even</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> new concepts for the series, such as a period piece set in the 1960s, a female 007, or a Black James Bond. Ultimately, they chose to return to the basics of the series, not following the sensitive and caring Bond of the Dalton films or the political correctness that started to permeate the decade. However, when released, the film was considered a successful revitalisation, and it effectively adapted the series for the 1990s. One of GoldenEye's innovations was the casting of a female M. In the film, the new M quickly establishes her authority, remarking that Bond is a [...] "sexist, misogynist dinosaur" [...] and a [...] "relic of the Cold War". This is an early indication that Bond is portrayed as far less tempestuous than Timothy Dalton's Bond from 1989.|$|E
500|$|In an {{interview}} in August 2005, Key explained that the album was a [...] "definite departure" [...] and [...] "more political" [...] than what Ocean Avenue had contained. In discussion of the album, Key said that the band had matured and that the music in Lights and Sounds would be different from their previous album. Though, Key added, [...] "...we have to be careful, {{we have to try}} and write songs [...] we wrote before. We have to make a conscious effort {{not to think about the}} fact that we went from being a nothing band... to having a bunch of hit singles in like, one year." [...] Printz Board of The Black Eyed Peas collaborated with Yellowcard on the song [...] "Two Weeks from Twenty" [...] where he played a trumpet solo. The song, [...] "How I Go", features a duet with Dixie Chicks' lead vocalist Natalie Maines, and features a twenty-five piece orchestra, which was conducted by violinist Sean Mackin. According to Peter Mosely, the band liked the Dixie Chicks' and <b>even</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> collaborating with Maines on Ocean Avenue for the song [...] "View from Heaven". Mosely also revealed that the band approached Maines about singing on [...] "How I Go"; [...] "The original plan was just for her to sing back-up (on the song). [...] it ended up turning into a duet." [...] He also added that Maines took a demo of the song and returned to the studio, Sunset Sound, where the band were working, in addition to the Dixie Chicks working on their album, with lyrics and vocals of her own.|$|E
6000|$|The {{irony of}} the {{situation}} had reached its climax to Peter. It didn't seem to be his voice that said, [...] "I can answer by an argument still more personal. I have <b>even</b> <b>thought</b> myself <b>of</b> marrying an Indian woman." ...|$|R

5000|$|During the {{turbulent}} 1990s and Yugoslav wars, Bogdan largely withdrew from public performances. As he explained, [...] "Simply, I wasn't {{in a mood}} to work. Also, the piracy took so much momentum that I was sick <b>even</b> <b>of</b> <b>thoughts</b> <b>of</b> composing and music... I hope those ugly times have gone {{and that we would}} be able to live like humans again".|$|R
2500|$|On May 14, he was {{the winning}} {{pitching}} when Mickey Mantle hit his 500th career home run. Of the event, Womack said, [...] "Most guys wouldn't have <b>even</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> the pitcher at such an important time. His home run won the ball game for me, and after the game he came over and shook hands and thanked me {{for the opportunity to}} celebrate." ...|$|E
2500|$|It was {{critical}} that Salk develop {{the trust of}} the U.S. public for his experiments and the mass tests that would become necessary. An associate of his noted, [...] "That boy really suffers when he sees a paralytic case. You look at him and you see him thinking, 'My God, this can be prevented'." [...] An article in Wisdom notes that at one point, [...] "he <b>even</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> giving up virus research": ...|$|E
2500|$|In early 2010, Young the Giant {{began work}} on its debut album with Grammy-winning {{producer}} Joe Chiccarelli. The album features live track recording, which the band had never previously attempted. Drummer Francois Comtois noted that working with Chiccarelli for the sessions [...] "was incredibly intimidating, but he kicked our asses into shape." [...] Gadhia also recalled the experience: [...] "We were criticized in ways we had never <b>even</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of,</b> and were constantly pushed to reach the next level. Looking back on it, [...] he shaped us into better musicians, performers, and songwriters. It was also great fun hearing his stories about Bono, Jay-Z and Elton John.|$|E
60|$|And so, at length, Lane's black demon {{of despair}} overthrew <b>even</b> his <b>thoughts</b> <b>of</b> Mel, and fettered him there, in {{darkness}} and strife of soul. He was an atom under the grinding, monstrous wheels of his morbid mood.|$|R

2500|$|Martin Burgess's {{memories}} of Gresham's during the freezing months of January to March 1947, the coldest British winter on record, are quoted at length in I Will Plant Me a Tree (2002). Not {{only was the}} winter icy cold, but because of fuel shortages the school was unheated. Burgess recalls that [...] "Periods were held in full overcoats and scarves and gloves. If it happened now the School would be closed, but such a step was not <b>even</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> then. In any case, the roads were blocked... One day the School was called out to dig out a farm, {{or was it a}} small village? Hurrah! No periods! In the afternoon everyone prayed there would be periods, it was so cold. A man had died." ...|$|E
2500|$|Rumours of the {{connection}} between the title of [...] "Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds" [...] and the initialism [...] "LSD" [...] began circulating shortly after the release of the Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band LP in June 1967. [...] Paul McCartney gave two interviews that same month admitting to having taken the drug. Lennon later said he was surprised at the idea that the song title was a hidden reference to LSD, countering that the song [...] "wasn't about that at all", and that it [...] "was purely unconscious that it came out to be LSD. Until someone pointed it out, I never <b>even</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> it. I mean, who would ever bother to look at initials of a title?... It's not an acid song." ...|$|E
2500|$|His first novella Is She to Blame? Pisemsky wrote {{while still}} a {{university}} student. He {{gave it to}} professor Stepan Shevyryov and the latter, being an opponent of the [...] "natural school", recommended to the author [...] "to soften up everything {{and make it more}} gentlemanly." [...] Pisemsky agreed to do so, but didn't hurry to follow this advice. What he did instead was send the professor Nina, a naive story about a fresh-looking, beautiful girl who turns into a dull matron. Shevyryov made some editorial cuts and then published the story in the July 1848 issue of the Syn Otechestva magazine. So curtailed and disfigured was this version, that the author never <b>even</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> re-issuing it. The story made its way into the posthumous Wolf's Publishing House 1884 collection of Pisemsky's works (Volume 4). Even in this curtailed form it bore, according to Skabichevsky, every mark of misanthropy and pessimism, seeds of which were sown in Boyarschina.|$|E
50|$|In some {{religions}} and traditions, these titles are separate demons; others identify these names as guises of the devil. <b>Even</b> when <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> as individual demons, some are often <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> being under the Devil's direct control. This identifies only those <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> as the devil; List of demons {{has a more}} general listing.|$|R
50|$|Indeed, the ICSC and the MSDS can <b>even</b> be <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> as complementary. If the {{two methods}} for hazard {{communication}} can be combined, then {{the amount of}} knowledge available to the safety representative or shop floor workers {{will be more than}} doubled.|$|R
6000|$|... "Comrade," [...] the Burman said, [...] "you {{have done}} a great deed, with courage. I, who am esteemed no coward, would never <b>even</b> have <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> attacking that great leopard with but a knife, and that {{to save the life}} of a stranger." ...|$|R
