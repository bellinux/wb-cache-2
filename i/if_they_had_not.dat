5|$|In 2010, McCaw and Dan Carter {{were on a}} NZ$750,000 a year {{contract}} that saw them {{through to the end}} of the 2011 Rugby World Cup, making them the highest paid rugby players in New Zealand at the time. This contract would still have applied <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>not</b> been selected for the World Cup squad.|$|E
5|$|In Nikki Stafford's analysis, the {{reactions}} of Buffy, Dawn, Xander, Willow, Anya, and Tara represent stages of Elisabeth Kübler-Ross' five stages of grief in different parts. Joss Whedon stated on the DVD commentary how surprised {{he was at the}} response from viewers who wrote to say that the episode allowed them to accept the death of a close family member, even <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>not</b> acknowledged it for months or years. Joyce's death was the first by natural causes in the series.|$|E
5|$|The Big Four Bridge {{was finally}} {{completed}} in September 1895. Due {{to the various}} accidents, the Louisville and Jeffersonville Bridge Company was financially strapped after building the bridge, and later in 1895 sold it to the Indianapolis-based Cleveland, Cincinnati, Chicago and St. Louis Railway, {{also known as the}} Big Four Railroad. This gave the railway its first entry into the Louisville market, although the railroad would have likely used the bridge even <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>not</b> bought it, as they desired access to Louisville.|$|E

5|$|In 2002 McCaw {{played for}} the All Blacks against the touring Ireland team (15–6 and 40–8 victories) and in the TriNations against Australia and South Africa. Of the six 2002 test matches McCaw played in, five were won by New Zealand with the only loss to Australia. The 14–16 loss {{occurred}} in New Zealand's third TriNations match and ensured the Bledisloe Cup stayed with Australia. During the All Blacks match against South Africa in Durban a pitch invader attacked Irish referee David McHugh as a scrum was being set, dislocating his shoulder in the process. McCaw and A.J. Venter wrestled the assailant off the referee and, according to McHugh, <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>not</b> got involved his shoulder would have been broken. McCaw was rested, along with 20 {{other members of the}} TriNations squad, from the 2002 end-of-year tour to Europe.|$|E
5|$|According to Nick Davies in The Guardian, the {{statement}} {{was the result of}} an intense argument in the Met's press office, after an earlier draft had been rejected. He wrote that both the Met and IPCC said {{the statement}} represented the truth as they understood it at the time, and that there had been no allegation at that point that Tomlinson had come into contact with police. Davies asked why the IPCC were involved <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>not</b> realized there had been police contact. He alleged that senior sources within the Met said privately that the assault on Tomlinson had been spotted by the police control room at Cobalt Street in south London, and that a chief inspector on the ground had also reported it. The Met issued a statement saying they had checked with every chief inspector who had been part of Operation Glencoe, and that none of them had called in such a report.|$|E
5|$|Kepler-14b is an {{extrasolar planet}} {{in orbit around}} the primary star of the binary Kepler-14 system. It is {{currently}} the only planet known to exist in this star system. Kepler-14b is 8.4 times the mass of Jupiter and has a radius 1.14 times that of Jupiter, and it orbits its host star every 6.79 days. It was discovered by NASA-led Kepler mission, which noted the planet as a planetary candidate as early as March 2009, {{around the same time}} as the discovery of the first five planets discovered by Kepler (Kepler-4b to Kepler-8b). However, the team was unable to confirm the planet until extensive follow-up observations, as high-resolution imaging resolved the star Kepler-14 as a closely orbiting binary system. The Kepler team would have not noticed that Kepler-14 was a binary star based solely on initial radial velocity measurements (a standard method for confirming a planet's existence), and found that <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>not</b> realized this, their data on Kepler-14b would have been very inaccurate.|$|E

5|$|On October 19, the Martin Company {{was about}} 110 miles (177 km) further east, making its last {{crossing}} of the North Platte River near present-day Casper, Wyoming. Shortly after completing the crossing, the blizzard struck. Many members of the company suffered from hypothermia or frostbite after wading through the frigid river. They set up camp at Red Bluffs, unable to continue forward through the snow. Meanwhile, the original scouting party continued eastward until it reached a small vacant fort at Devil's Gate, {{where they had been}} instructed to wait {{for the rest of the}} rescue party <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>not</b> found the Martin Company. When the main rescue party rejoined them, another scouting party consisting of Joseph Young, Abel Garr, and Daniel Webster Jones was sent forward. The Martin company remained in their camp at Red Bluffs for nine days until the three scouts finally arrived on October 28. By the time the scouts arrived, 56 members of the company had died. The scouts urged the emigrants to begin moving again. Three days later the main rescue party met the Martin Company and the Hodgett and Hunt wagon companies and helped them on to Devil's Gate.|$|E

25|$|The Winter War {{also helped}} reaffirm the Swedish position. Aid to Finland {{had been as}} much about aiding a {{neighbour}} as about neutralising the public opinion calling for active intervention in the war. It also helped to establish the political priorities before the events of 9 April 1940, when Germany invaded Denmark and Norway. The goal was now fixed on keeping Sweden out of the growing European conflict; <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>not</b> gone to war to defend Finland, {{there was no way}} that they would do it for Norway.|$|E

25|$|The {{uniformity}} of laws {{in some areas}} of federal jurisdiction was significantly delayed. Offences under the Criminal Code were not made uniform until 1892, when common-law criminal offences were abolished. Divorce law was not made uniform until 1968, Canadian maritime law until not until 1971 and marriage law until 2005. Provisions of the Civil Code of Lower Canada, adopted in 1865 by the former Province of Canada, affecting federal jurisdiction continued to be in force in Quebec (<b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>not</b> been displaced by other federal Acts) until their repeal on 15 December 2004.|$|E
25|$|Fleischmann and Pons' {{announcement}} drew wide media attention.

Many scientists were also reminded of the Mössbauer effect, a process involving nuclear transitions in a solid. Its discovery 30 years earlier had also been unexpected, though it was quickly replicated and explained within the existing physics framework.|$|E
25|$|Before 2002, Russian law allowed {{residents}} of former Soviet Union {{to apply for}} citizenship <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>not</b> become citizens of their newly independent states.

The new citizenship law of Russia adopted on 31 May 2002 introduced a simplified procedure of citizenship acquisition for former citizens of the Soviet Union regardless of their place of residence. In Abkhazia and South Ossetia, the application process was simplified even further, and people could apply even without leaving their homes. Russian nationalist non-governmental organisations {{with close ties to}} Russian officialdom simply took their papers to a nearby Russian city for processing.|$|E

To maintain certification, all certified peace officers must complete forty hours of in-service training annually. Sheriffs themselves, however, are not mandated to be trained and certified as the job requirements for sheriff are described in the Kentucky Constitution, rather than the Kentucky Revised Statutes.

25|$|A canal was dug by the British {{to enable}} 42 small boats {{to get to}} the river. Preparations for the attack had foundered early on the 8th, as the canal being dug by Cochrane's sailors {{collapsed}} and the dam made to divert the flow of the river into the canal failed, leaving the sailors to drag the boats of Col. Thornton's west bank assault force through deep mud and left the force starting off just before daybreak, 12 hours late. The frontal attack was not postponed, however, as it was hoped that the west bank would at least create a diversion, even <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>not</b> succeeded in the assault.|$|E

The graduate rate of Secondary School was high, likely between 90 and 95 percent. Top-performing Navy graduates were promoted to Petty-officer 2nd or even 1st class Radio Technician; this rating was changed to Electronics Technician Mate (ETM) or Aviation Electronics Technician Mate (AETM) in 1945.
