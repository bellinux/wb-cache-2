Since excessive cell growth is a hallmark of cancer development, targetes chemotherapy that disrupts the <b>fuctioning</b> of DNA ligase can impede adjuvant cancer forms. Furthermore, {{it has been shown}} that DNA ligase can be broadly divided into two categories namely, ATP dependent and NAD+ dependent. Previous research has shown that although NAD+-dependent DNA ligases have been discovered in sporadic cellular or viral niches outside the bacterial domain of life, there is no instance in which a NAD+-dependent ligase is present in a eukaryal organism. The narrow phylogenetic distribution, unique substrate specificity, and distinctive domain structure of NAD+ depandant compared with ATP-dependent human DNA ligases recommend the NAD+ ligases as targets for the development of new antibacterial drugs.|$|E

40|$|Four {{studies were}} carried out. In the first, it was {{hypothesized}} that individuals may have a predisposition for ‘reinvestment’ of controlled processing, which will lead to skill failure under stress as a result of disruption of the automatic functioning of the skill. Factor analysis of established personality measures related to the concept of reinvestment uncovered a reliable 20 -item factor which appeared to be associated with reinvestment. In the second study a predictive validation of this ‘Reinvestment Scale’ was attempted. It was predicted that the motor performance of high scorers on the scale {{would be more likely to}} fail under pressure than that of low scorers, on the grounds that high reinvesters would be more likely to disrupt the smooth <b>fuctioning</b> of their own skill by investing it with controlled processing. High and low reinvesters learned a two-dimensional rod-tracing task to a level of performance approaching asymptote and were then required to perform under conditions of stress. Despite highly significant increases in the levels of stress exhibited, performance was unaffected in both groups, thus providing neither support for nor refutation of the prediction. An explanation of this was that the rod tracing task was not complex enough to present the kind of demands that would lead to reinvestment. Hence, a third study was carried out in which a more complex, golf-putting skill was considered. In this instance support was found for the prediction that the performance of high scorers on the Reinvestment Scale would be more likely to fail under pressure than that of low scorers. Finally, a fourth study was carried out in which further validation was sought by exploring whether a relationship existed between the reinvestment scores of university team squash and tennis players and the opinion of informed raters on their tendency to ‘choke’ under pressure. A correlation was again found, providing further evidence that high reinvesters are more likely to suffer from performance breakdown under pressure. It was concluded that the Reinvestment Scale does indeed assess a predisposition towards reinvestment of controlled processing, and may prove to be a valuable instrument in predicting skill failure in stressful situations involving complex, rule-bound skills...|$|E
40|$|Purpose The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{ascertain}} the developmental status of a selected group of Black freshman college women; and to determine if there was a relation ship between their developmental status and their academic performance, interpersonal <b>fuctioning</b> and curriculum adj ustment. Hypotheses In this study nine hypotheses were tested. Hypotheses one and two were tested, using the Fisher t—test for uncorrelated samples to determine the influence of the awareness of developmental status on academic performance and interpersonal functioning. Hypotheses three, four and five were tested using the Pearson product moment co efficient of correlation to determine the degree of relationship between autonomy—developmental status and academic performance. The Pearson r was used to test hypctheses six, seven and eight, to determine the degree of relationship between autonomy—developmental status, interpersonal relationships—developmental status and inter personal functioning. The Chi-square test of significance and the Fisher exact probability test were used in testing hypothesis nine to determine the influence of the awareness of developmental status upon curriculum adjustment. The. 05 level of significance was the criterion for acceptance of each null hypothesis. Procedure One hundred and sixteen Black female freshman college students were the participants in this study. There were fifty-three subjects in the experimental group and sixty-three subjects in the control group. A strati fied random sample of 150 students was selected from the 1982 - 83 entering freshman class in a predominantly Black southern liberal arts college for women. Due to lack of availability of data, thirty-four of these students had to be eliminated. Pre- and post-investigation data were collected from the experimental and the control groups. These con sisted of developmental status scores from the Student Developmental Task Inventory; inventoried vocational interests from the Strong-Campbell Interest Inventory; intended curriculum (major) and vocational choice from the American Council on Education Questionnaire and the New Student Slip; interpersonal functioning scores from the Attitude Questionnaire on Interpersonal Relationships; age, SAT or ACT scores, grade point averages, second semester majors, and activities in which each subject participated from college records. Early in the spring semester, the Student Developmental Task Inventory results were interpreted to the subjects in the experimental group in small groups as the treatment for this study by five trained graduate assistants who served as counselors. Conclusions Conclusions drawn from the findings of this study were as follows: 1. Freshman college females who are aware of their developmental status are very likely to function interpersonally at a higher level than those who are not aware. This awareness, however, is not likely to be reflected in their academic performance. 2. Neither autonomy, purpose nor inter personal relationships-developmental status were predictors of academic performance. 3. There was a significant relationship between autonomy, purpose and interpersonal relationships-developmental status and interpersonal functioning for the control group subjects but only interpersonal relatioships-developmental status was significantly related to interpersonal functioning for the experimental group subj ects. 4. Neither the frequency nor the direction of curricular adjustment was significantly influenced by awareness of developmental status of the freshman college females in this study. 5. Of the variables considered in this study relative to the student profile, only combined SAT scores demonstrated the potential to be used as a predictor of academic performance...|$|E
