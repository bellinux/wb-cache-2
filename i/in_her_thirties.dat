5|$|For most of Edward's reign, Mary {{remained}} {{on her own}} estates and rarely attended court. A plan between May and July 1550 to smuggle her out of England {{to the safety of}} the European mainland came to nothing. Religious differences between Mary and Edward continued. When Mary was <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>thirties,</b> she attended a reunion with Edward and Elizabeth for Christmas 1550, where 13-year-old Edward embarrassed Mary, and reduced both her and himself to tears in front of the court, by publicly reproving her for ignoring his laws regarding worship. Mary repeatedly refused Edward's demands that she abandon Catholicism, and Edward persistently refused to drop his demands.|$|E
5|$|As Anderson {{remained}} {{throughout her}} life evasive {{about the details}} of her life as a commercial writer, it is not known when she began writing commercially under pseudonyms, what those pseudonyms were, or, indeed, how much she wrote. She revealed only that she began writing for magazines and newspapers out of commercial necessity, and rarely under her own name. Although she achieved success later in this field, she sometimes stated that, as her writing improved, her pieces were more frequently turned down for publication. <b>In</b> <b>her</b> <b>thirties,</b> she began to write for commercial radio. Beginning with half-hour slots, Anderson gradually became interested in the technique of crafting radio plays, and began submitting some of her better work to the ABC under her own name. She later ascribed her fondness for writing the expansive dialogue in her novels to her early experience writing radio plays.|$|E

Her course {{included}} lectures at Birkbeck College given by Nikolaus Pevsner, {{author of the}} 46-volume series The Buildings of England. In late 1963 she was employed by him as a part-time research assistant on the Bedfordshire volume but the work (gathering building references from the Victoria County History) was unfulfilling, and to Pevsner's great annoyance she left {{after a few months}} to resume her writing.|$|E
25|$|Luisa Banti {{was born}} into a well-to-do family in Florence in 1894, the oldest of six children. Her father, Guido Banti, was a {{prominent}} physician and Professor of Pathology at the University of Florence. Having inherited her father's propensity for analytical research, she defied expectations for women of her day by enrolling in the University of Florence when she was <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>thirties,</b> to study philology and classical antiquity. She wrote her doctoral dissertation on the Luni site and her post-doctoral thesis on the cult of the dead in archaic Rome. Among her professors were Giacomo Devoto, who introduced her to Etruscology, and Luigi Pernier, who trained her in Etruscan archaeology.|$|E
25|$|As {{the product}} of a morganatic marriage, and without {{succession}} rights to the throne, Francis was not acceptable as a husband for princesses in most of the European royal houses. He further had little income in comparison with other European princes. He thus married into a richer family, by marrying his father's third cousin (in descent from King George II of Great Britain) Princess Mary Adelaide of Cambridge, the younger daughter of Prince Adolphus, Duke of Cambridge, and a granddaughter of George III, who was known as 'Fat Mary' because of her wide girth. That, together with {{the fact that she was}} (by 1866) already <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>thirties,</b> meant that Mary Adelaide was also short of choices for marriage.|$|E

500|$|Jessica was the {{youngest}} of four children; her elder siblings were [...] (1908–1982), Vida Joan Queale (1910–1954), and Patricia Queale. While each features to some extent in her semi-autobiographical work, Stories from the Warm Zone and Sydney Stories, Anderson's relationship with her brother, Alan (Neal in the memoirs), who was eight years her senior, is the least developed in the collection. Indeed, Anderson stated in one interview that for many years, she and her brother [...] "lived in different channels of the same family," [...] and that it was only during the later years of his life, when they were the last surviving members of their immediate family that they grew close. Alan Queale rose to some renown in his own right as a prolific archivist, mostly of Australiana and artefacts of Queensland's history, and many of his collections remain in the State Library of Queensland and the National Library of Australia. Beyond the brief glimpses afforded by Stories from the Warm Zone and Sydney Stories, little is known about Anderson's relationships with her two sisters, Joan and Patricia. Her eldest sister, Joan, died in her early forties, when Anderson was <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>thirties,</b> tragically leaving behind several young children. Her other sister, Patricia, also died of cancer some years later. Anderson writes very affectionately of her sisters.|$|E

500|$|... is the [...] of the Kirigakure. She {{possesses}} two kekkei genkai: the Lava Style, {{a combination}} of fire and earth elements that allows her to spit lava, and Vapor Style, which mixes fire and water to create corrosive mist. She is apparently relatively new to the position and does not remember the previous leadership, which conducted witch hunts against kekkei genkai users like her, fondly. During the Kage Summit, Mei acts rather dodgy when asked about rumors that Akatsuki formed in her village, and when she finds out Danzo is capable of mind control she suspects him of using it on the previous Mizukage. She manages to nearly kill Sasuke during the meeting and initially helps guard the daimyo of the Shinobi Countries during the preparation for the Fourth Ninja War. During the war, Mei fights the revived Madara Uchiha with the other Kages, though despite their impressive teamwork, they still end up losing to Madara's might. Years after the war {{comes to an end}} and during some point at the epilogue, Mei passes down her title to her former bodyguard Chōjūrō. Despite being a beautiful woman <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>thirties,</b> she is never married, and the status of being one pains her. She is voiced by Yurika Hino in the Japanese anime, and by Mary Elizabeth McGlynn in the English adaptation.|$|E

2500|$|Food was scarce, often {{little more}} than porridge, {{resulting}} in vitamin deficiencies. Public hygiene was non-existent and lavatories were basic.

Well filled plates of porridge in the morning and piles of potatoes were peeled each day in the kitchen while Tabby told stories about her country or Emily revised her German grammar, and sometimes Mr Brontë would return home from his tours of the village with game donated by the parishioners.|$|E
2500|$|<b>In</b> <b>her</b> <b>thirties,</b> Craddock {{left her}} Quaker {{upbringing}} behind.

[...] As a freethinker, she was elected Secretary of the Philadelphia chapter of the American Secular Union in 1889. [...] Although {{a member of the}} Unitarian faith, Craddock became a student of religious eroticism and declared herself a Priestess and Pastor of the Church of Yoga. [...] Never married, Craddock eventually claimed to have a blissful ongoing marital relationship with an angel named Soph. [...] Craddock even stated that her intercourse with Soph was so noisy as to draw complaints from her neighbors. Her mother responded by threatening to burn Craddock's papers and unsuccessfully tried to have her institutionalized.|$|E
2500|$|Mademoiselle de Maupin (1835) In September 1833, Gautier was {{solicited}} {{to write}} a historical romance based {{on the life of}} French opera star Mlle Maupin, who was a first-rate swordswoman and often went about disguised as a man. Originally, the story was to be about the historical la Maupin, who set fire to a convent for the love of another woman, but later retired to a convent herself, shortly before dying <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>thirties.</b> Gautier instead turned the plot into a simple love triangle between a man, d'Albert, and his mistress, Rosette, who both fall in love with Madelaine de Maupin, who is disguised as a man named Théodore. The message behind Gautier's version of the infamous legend is the fundamental pessimism about the human identity, and perhaps the entire Romantic age. The novel consists of seventeen chapters, most in the form of letters written by d'Albert or Madelaine. Most critics focus on the preface of the novel, which preached about Art for art's sake through its dictum that [...] "everything useful is ugly." ...|$|E
