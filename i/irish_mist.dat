It is made from aged Irish whiskey, heather and clover honey, aromatic herbs, and other spirits, blended to an ancient recipe claimed to be 1,000 years old.

50|$|Following this period, Prohibition in the United States, an {{economic}} war with Britain in the 1930s, and World War II all harmed the industry. Tullamore {{was one of}} many Irish distilleries affected by a general decline in Irish whiskey sales worldwide. After World War II, Desmond Williams, grandson of Daniel E. Williams, used modern marketing techniques to re-establish Irish whiskey in world markets. In 1947, Desmond Williams also developed <b>Irish</b> <b>Mist,</b> an Irish liqueur made from a blend of whiskey, herbs and honey, using a recipe alleged to have disappeared in the late 17th century and to have been rediscovered in a manuscript 250 years later. Williams also capitalised on the Irish coffee concept, and promoted blended whiskies.|$|E

5000|$|In 1938 Heublein {{acquired}} {{all rights}} to Smirnoff Vodka, a brand {{that had been}} produced in Russia prior to the October Revolution. Heublein is credited with popularizing vodka in the United States by marketing Smirnoff as [...] "White Whiskey", and with the phrase [...] "leaves you breathless" [...] the probable source of the mistaken belief that vodka consumption leaves no tell-tale odor. Smirnoff became one of Heublein's most successful brands. [...] Heublein also acquired distribution rights in the United States to many other international spirit, wine, and beer brands including Don Q Rum, Jose Cuervo, Black & White, Harvey's Bristol Cream, <b>Irish</b> <b>Mist</b> liqueur, Bell's whisky, Guinness Stout, Lancer's wines, and Bass Ale. Heublein also held American import and distribution rights to non-alcoholic beverages such as Perrier mineral water and Rose's Lime Juice.|$|E
5000|$|The word 'whiskey' (or whisky) {{comes from}} the Irish (or 'Gaelic') uisce beatha, meaning water of life. Irish whiskey {{was one of the}} {{earliest}} distilled drinks in Europe, arising around the 12th century (see Distilled beverage). It is believed that Irish monks brought the technique of distilling perfumes back to Ireland from their travels to the Mediterranean countries around 1000 A.D. The Irish then modified this technique to obtain a drinkable spirit. Although termed [...] "whiskey", the spirit produced during this period would have differed from what we currently recognise as whiskey. The uisce beatha or whiskey produced in historical times would not have been aged, and was often flavoured with aromatic herbs such as mint, thyme or anise. <b>Irish</b> <b>Mist,</b> a whiskey liqueur launched in 1963 is purportedly based on such a recipe.|$|E
5000|$|In {{the fall}} of 1974, Woods's {{grandfather}} died and bequeathed him {{enough money to buy}} a yacht suitable for the race. He ordered a Golden Shamrock-based yacht from Ron Holland, and worked with him on designing the interior suitable for single-handeded racing and Woods' personal needs. Since his previous sailing experience consisted of [...] "racing a ten-foot plywood dinghy on Sunday afternoons against small children, losing regularly", Woods spent eighteen months learning more about sailing and celestial navigation while his yacht was being built in Cork. He gained more boating experience by sailing from Ireland to England as part of the crew on STY Creidne, a training ship purchased by the Irish Government for the Irish Naval Service, <b>Irish</b> <b>Mist</b> II, Ron Holland's Golden Apple, and as many other yachts that would accept him, amassing 1200 miles of offshore experience. He entered the August 1975 Multihull Offshore Cruising and Racing Association (MOCRA) Azores Race and asked fellow Galway Bay Sailing Club member Commander Bill King to join him.|$|E
50|$|Like many Irish distilleries, {{the company}} {{suffered}} {{in the early part}} of the 20th century, due to the advent of competition from blended Scotch whisky, and the curtailment of exports to the British Empire and the United States during Prohibition and the Anglo-Irish Trade War. In fact, the distillery closed in 1925 to cut costs, staying closed for thirteen years, before reopening again in 1937. Faced with struggling sales in the 1940s, Desmond E. Williams, a descendant of the original D.E. Williams, began into alternative products, such as heather wine, a drink reputedly enjoyed by old Irish chieftains, which was made from a combination of whiskey, heather honey and other herbs. Unable to find an extant original recipe in Ireland, Williams wondered if Irish emigrants, such as those that left Ireland in the Flight of the Wild Geese in 1691, or after the Great Famine had carried the recipe overseas with them, and sent out word that he was interested in finding such a recipe. As luck would have it, an Austrian War refugee appeared in Tullamore in 1948 with a family recipe of Irish origin. Better than Williams' own reconstructed recipe, the result was <b>Irish</b> <b>Mist,</b> the first modern whiskey liqueur to be launched in Ireland.|$|E
