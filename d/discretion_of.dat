5|$|When {{a public}} {{authority}} fetters its discretion, it {{can either be}} said to have failed to exercise its discretionary power or to have been subject to external influences. In the Singapore High Court decision Lines International Holding (S) Pte. Ltd. v. Singapore Tourist Promotion Board (1997), two distinct forms <b>of</b> fettering <b>of</b> <b>discretion</b> were recognized: fettering <b>of</b> <b>discretion</b> through rigid adherence to a policy, and fettering <b>of</b> <b>discretion</b> by an unlawful delegation of authority. These two forms <b>of</b> fettering <b>of</b> <b>discretion</b> have been said to represent two elements defining the concept <b>of</b> <b>discretion</b> in administrative law – the first form relates to freedom of choice, and second form the notion <b>of</b> one's personal <b>discretion.</b>|$|R

5000|$|It {{is often}} {{hard to control}} officers' use <b>of</b> <b>discretion</b> because <b>of</b> {{the way it is}} applied to situations. [...] "Policing the police" [...] is a very {{important}} part in maintaining a balance <b>of</b> police <b>discretion</b> and controlling it so the power <b>of</b> <b>discretion</b> is not abused. Unfortunately, the police have an ability to perform an abuse <b>of</b> <b>discretion</b> without being noticed or regulated by the judicial or legislative community in what {{is referred to as the}} [...] "legal shadow". In this place questionable police tactics are being performed and, in a sense, covered up with police privilege backed by government support. Although there has been some effort by the federal government to regulate police discretion, unless there is a conflict including the Constitution, it is difficult for them to involve themselves. Most of the time police misconduct doesn't draw enough attention to include federal intervention.|$|R

50|$|According to Lipsky, the {{exercise}} <b>of</b> <b>discretion</b> among street level bureaucrats {{is critical in}} how public servants interact with citizens on a daily basis. He claims to understand these acts <b>of</b> <b>discretion</b> once must analyze the outcome of agency performance the public experiences as a combined result of agency rules and street level bureaucrats responses to unsanctioned work. Lipsky said the use <b>of</b> <b>discretion</b> by street level bureaucrats can’t be removed from everyday practice due to the complexity and uncertainty of human service work. Carrington identifies the fear of power abuse as {{a major reason for}} the opposition <b>of</b> <b>discretion</b> in the arena of street level bureaucrats and its citizens. In order to control problems in discretionary action there has been a demand for control by understanding the social situations in which discretion varies. Marissa Kelly also examines the use <b>of</b> <b>discretion</b> among street level bureaucrats to assert that discretion can either enhance or inhibit street level bureaucrats’ implementation of justice. She asserts that whether discretion is appropriate or not justice theories need to be further examined.|$|R
