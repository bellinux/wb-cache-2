40|$|Master of ScienceDepartment of Civil EngineeringSunanda DissanayakeIn the United States, the mileage of unpaved roads {{is about}} 1. 6 million miles. Total length of unpaved roads in Kansas is about 98, 000 miles, of which about 78, 000 miles are <b>gravel</b> <b>roads.</b> Most of the <b>gravel</b> <b>roads</b> are not posted with speed limit signs but {{regulated}} with a 55 mph blanket speed limit {{established by the}} Kansas Statutes. Surface conditions of <b>gravel</b> <b>roads</b> are very likely to change with time, space, and quality of maintenance work, making it even more necessary to have proper control of speeds on <b>gravel</b> <b>roads.</b> Normally used speed regulations and rules for freeways or other types of paved roadways might not be appropriate for <b>gravel</b> <b>roads,</b> especially for those local <b>gravel</b> <b>roads</b> which usually carry very low traffic in rural areas. Based on an extensive literature search, there was no specific rule or references to provide guidelines on how speed limits on <b>gravel</b> <b>roads</b> could be set. Therefore, an effort was made in this study to evaluate the effects of currently posted lower speed limits in some counties in Kansas, based on traffic characteristics and safety on <b>gravel</b> <b>roads,</b> {{with the intention of}} providing proper guidelines for setting speed limits on <b>gravel</b> <b>roads</b> in Kansas. In order to study traffic characteristics on <b>gravel</b> <b>roads,</b> field speed studies were conducted with automatic traffic counters on more than forty <b>gravel</b> <b>road</b> sections in seven counties in Kansas. Important speed measures, such as 85 th-percentile speed and mean speed, were obtained from the raw data. A group of other related road characteristics were also recorded at the time of field data collection. Crash data on <b>gravel</b> <b>roads</b> were extracted from the Kansas Accident Recording System (KARS) database. Speed analysis on a number of <b>gravel</b> <b>roads</b> where the statutory imposed, unposted speed limit of 55 mph was utilized indicated that they are functioning at a reasonably acceptable level in terms of actual speeds. In order to evaluate whether there were differences in traffic speeds between two counties or groups which have different speed limit settings on <b>gravel</b> <b>roads,</b> t-test was used. The analysis found that {{there was no significant difference}} between the mean speeds in two counties, one of which has 35 mph posted speed limit on <b>gravel</b> <b>roads</b> while the other does not post any speed limits. Moreover, the mean speed on the sections with 35 mph posted speed was a little higher than that on <b>gravel</b> <b>roads</b> without any speed limits. Linear models to predict 85 th-percentile speed and mean speed on <b>gravel</b> <b>roads</b> were developed based on speed data. Both models indicated that traffic speeds are not significantly affected by the speed limit, but are related with 90 % confidence to road width, surface classification and percentage of large vehicles in traffic. Chi-square tests were conducted with the crash data, and the results indicated that the posted 35 mph speed limit on <b>gravel</b> <b>roads</b> had not resulted in either smaller total number of crashes or decreased proportion of severe crashes, compared to <b>gravel</b> <b>roads</b> where no speed limits were posted. Logistic regression models were also developed on four levels of crash severity, which indicated that <b>gravel</b> <b>roads</b> with higher speed limits are likely to experience higher probability of having injury crashes. Two mail-back surveys were also conducted to gather the opinions of county engineers and road users on the subject of suitable speed limits on <b>gravel</b> <b>roads.</b> The majority of county engineers believed that blanket speed limit should be used for <b>gravel</b> <b>roads</b> and does not need to be posted. Three restrictions: changeful road conditions, unpractical law enforcement, and limited funds, are basic reasons why they do not think that <b>gravel</b> <b>roads</b> should be posted. Besides that, a few respondents said 55 mph is too high for <b>gravel</b> <b>roads</b> and needs to be lowered. Majority of the road users suggested that all <b>gravel</b> <b>roads</b> be posted with lower speed limit signs. However, they were more concerned about law enforcement since they believe that posted speeds won't bring any benefits if no law enforcement patrol <b>gravel</b> <b>roads.</b> Based on all aspects looked into in this study, it does not appear that reducing the speed limits and posting it with signs, is going to improve either traffic operational or safety characteristics on <b>gravel</b> <b>roads</b> in Kansas, and therefore is not recommended for new situations...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. <b>Gravel</b> <b>roads</b> are majorly {{affected}} by deterioration which manifests as loss of gravel materials due to traffic and environmental conditions. District Road Maintenance Managers {{are faced with}} competing investment demands to maintain <b>gravel</b> <b>road</b> networks in the best condition due to inadequate intelligent techniques of evaluating the roadway performance. The aim of evaluating the road network performance {{is to reduce the}} rate of deterioration so that maintenance interventions could be extended. Road condition data is a precursor for road monitoring and is collected on a periodic basis by road authorities to assist in transportation planning. The primary objective of this paper was to evaluate and analysis the trend of Botswana <b>gravel</b> <b>road</b> condition which best captures the effects of <b>gravel</b> <b>road</b> condition influencing factors. This was achieved by carrying out exploratory statistical analysis. <b>Gravel</b> <b>road</b> condition data were collected through the Botswana Roads Department covering 2002, 2005 and 2008 for Botswana district <b>gravel</b> <b>road</b> networks. The variables required for the analysis were clustered and pre-processed to determine their suitability. The analysis results gave a broad overview {{of the extent to which}} <b>gravel</b> <b>road</b> condition trends lend credence to their usefulness in district transportation networks monitoring in Botswana...|$|R
