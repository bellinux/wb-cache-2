40|$|Reducing power {{dissipation}} {{is the ultimate}} objective {{in the world of}} VLSI circuit design. Conventional logic dissipates more power by losing bits of information whereas reversibility recovers bit loss from the unique input-output mapping. Thus reversible logic has become immensely popular research area and its applications have spread in various technologies. In this paper we have proposed the compact design of reversible circuits for a data acquisition and storage system. The design comprises with a compact reversible analog-to- digital converter and a reversible address register. In the way of designing this data acquisition and storage system we have proposed a reversible <b>J-K</b> <b>flip-flop</b> with asynchronous inputs, a reversible D flipflop and a reversible three state buffer register. All the reversible designs individually have less number of gates, garbage outputs and quantum cost compared with the existing ones and have outperformed those described in the literature. Moreover we have proposed some lower bounds for designing these reversible components of the compact data acquisition and storage system...|$|E

This is where the reference frequency signal is compared with the signal fed back from theVCO output, and the resulting error signal is used to drive the loop filter andVCO. In a digital PLL (DPLL) the phase detector or phase-frequency detector is a logical element. The three most common implementations are : Exclusive-or (EXOR) Gate <b>J-K</b> <b>Flip-Flop</b> Digital Phase-Frequency Detector Here we will consider only the PFD, the element used in the ADF 4110 andADF 4210 synthesizer families, because [...] -unlike the EXOR gate and the J-K flip flop [...] -its output {{is a function of}} both the frequency difference and the phase difference between the two inputs when it is in the unlocked state. Figure 1 shows one implementation of a PFD, basically consisting of two D-type flip flops. One Q output enables a positive current source; and the other Q o...|$|E
40|$|Abstract-Several {{techniques}} for choosing state assignments {{which tend to}} minimize the combinational input and output circuitry of sequential machines have been developed. One of these techniques is a heuristic scoring approach which was originally developed assuming delays asmemory elements [1]. This technique was later expanded to cover the cases when trigger flip-flops or combinations of trigger flip-flops and delays were used as memory elements [2]. In this correspondence the hueristic scoring approach developed by Dolotta and McCluskey will be expanded to cover the case whenJ-K flip-flops are used asmemory elements. It will be shown that {{the relative importance of}} various features when using delays as memory elements {{is not the same as}} when <b>J-K</b> <b>flip-flops</b> are used. Also, a new set of scores for <b>J-K</b> <b>flip-flops</b> based on the relative importance of various features will be developed. Index Terms-J-K flip-flop memory, sequential machines, state assignment...|$|R
40|$|The {{problem of}} {{constructing}} linear shift registers {{with a minimum}} number of adders has provoked interesting research on the theory of trinomials over the field with two elements. Each adder which can be eliminated significantly increases {{the speed at which}} the sequence can be generated, and linear shift registers corresponding to trinomials have only one adder. In this paper we describe a class of sequence generators employing <b>J-K</b> <b>flip-flops</b> in place of the usual delay elements, and which require no adders or additional gating. <b>J-K</b> <b>flip-flops</b> operate at a speed comparable to that of delay elements. If n is the number of flip-flops, then for n = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 15, 17, and 18 a sequence of period 2 sun- 1 can be generated. This sequence is linear and has the well-known randomness and correlation properties. A table in the final section of this paper gives the periodic structure for all n â‰¦ 19...|$|R
