Materials/MethodsA retrospective study of 33 patients with brain tumours treated between April 2005 and January 2006 was performed in the Radiotherapy Department of the Oncology Centre in Łódź. Stereotactic surgery was performed in all patients. All treatment plans {{were divided into two}} groups: plans with one isocentre and plans with two <b>isocentres.</b> For each treatment plan various kinds of conformity parameters were calculated and optimal prescription isodose level was determined. ResultsAll conformity indices are within ranges and were accepted. Their values are lower in plans with two <b>isocentres</b> in comparison to plans with one isocentre. ConclusionsConformity indices are very helpful in the analysis of treatment plans, but they do not give real insight into all aspects of plans. Prescription isodose should completely enclose PTV volume. Optimal prescription isodose does not cover PTV; thus from a clinical point of view it is inapplicable...|$|E
40|$|Conventional 3 D dose {{calculations}} for stereotactic radiosurgery involve {{integration of}} individual static beams comprising {{a set of}} arcs. For iterative optimization of multiple isocentre treatment, which requires repetitive dose calculations at {{a large number of}} sample points, the conventional method is too slow. To overcome this problem spherically symmetric dose distributions are assumed. The authors describe a spherical dose model derived from a parametrized convolution of the collimator width and a dose spread kernel. The method is fast and easy to implement requiring just a single empirically derived value. Furthermore, the model is differentiable with respect to the parameters to be optimized. This property is useful when the optimization strategies rely on gradient information. 1.

Methods: VMAT planning was performed a whole body computed tomography (CT) data set using Rapid Arc. The planning target volumes included entire body trimmed to 3 mm below the skin. The organs at risk included the lungs and kidneys. A dose of 12 Gy in 10 fractions was prescribed to the target volume. The VMAT-TBI technique consisted of three <b>isocentres</b> and three overlapping arcs: the head and neck, the chest, and the pelvis. The plans were prescribed to ensure, at a minimum, 95 % planning target volume dose coverage with the prescription dose (percentage of volume receiving dose of 12 Gy was 95 %) and maximum dose of 109. 8 %. Mean dose to lung was restricted at 8. 6 Gy. Results: The total body volume {{in the study was}} 15469 cm 3 and the PTV volume was 11322 cm 3. The mean dose to PTV was 104 %. The homogeneity index was 0. 09. Sparing of normal tissues with adequate coverage of skeletal bones was shown to be feasible with Rapid Arc.

A realistic and practical solution for these treatments delivered in conformal radiotherapy is proposed to control the absorbed dose at <b>isocentre,</b> using multiple surface MOSFET measurements over an arc. On the one hand, a forward method was developed to optimize {{the location of the}} detectors at the patient surface, taking into account arc length, prescribed <b>isocentre</b> dose, collimator and field size.

Finally, the reconstructed dose at <b>isocentre</b> was compared to real measurement, obtained for several detectors positioned at a phantom surface. Results show that the inverse method gives good results with five MOSFET equi-spaced positioned within the arc beam course: deviation between prescribed and computed average total dose at <b>isocentre</b> was below 2 % both for 30 × 30 mm 2 and 18 × 18 mm 2 field siz...|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} a new method is {{proposed}} to quantify {{and reduce the}} radiation beam position uncertainty due to the radiotherapy treatment machine gantry deflection. A new tool has been designed and manufactured to provide the means to measure the alignment of the collimator axis and of the beam central axis in space, using the NDI Polaris optical tracking system and Gafchromic® films. The tool can be mounted onto the accessory tray of the linacs from different manufacturers. The approach has been demonstrated with measurements of the mechanical <b>isocentre</b> being performed on ten linacs from three major manufacturers at four clinical sites. Measurements of the radiation <b>isocentre</b> were performed on a single linac. The collimator axis trajectory is modelled using a vector-end effector {{in order to provide}} more information than standard mechanical assessment methods. The method uses a mathematical optimization technique to calculate the position of the mechanical <b>isocentre</b> and the 'size' of the collimator axes intersection locus. Deviations of the collimator axes from the <b>isocentre</b> are expressed in terms of systematic and random error. The effects of measurement uncertainties are evaluated both via simulations and experimentally. The use of optical tracking and optimization techniques combined with an operator-induced measurement error compensation algorithm leads to a faster measurement of the mechanical <b>isocentre</b> (20 min for 24 angles) and eliminates operator-induced uncertainties. The uncertainty of the measurement of the mechanical <b>isocentre</b> was between 40 µm and 70 µm in terms of standard deviation. For some of the linacs assessed, the mechanical <b>isocentre</b> obtained using a standard approach with an adjustable pointer was displaced by over 1 mm from that found with the proposed method. The radii of the collimator axes intersection locus found with the proposed method were between 0. 4 mm and 0. 72 mm for the linacs assessed. Film measurement revealed a misalignment of the mechanical <b>isocentre</b> and the radiation <b>isocentre</b> by 0. 4 mm. The proposed method potentially enables a reduction of the beam position uncertainty. This may be achieved at the planning stage by compensating for the identified systematic collimator axes deviations which were found to be reproducible. The method also creates a potential for using different setup margins independently for each axis and for each gantry angle, calculated specifically for a given linac...|$|R

Eleven patients were treated with implanted prostate fiducial markers and online set-up corrections. Pretreatment orthogonal electronic portal images were acquired to determine couch shifts and verification images were acquired during treatment to measure residual set-up error. The prostate set-up errors that would result from skin marker set-up, off-line bony anatomy-based protocols and online fiducial marker-based corrections were determined. Set-up margins were calculated for each set-up technique using the percentage of encompassed <b>isocentres</b> and a margin recipe. The prostate systematic set-up errors in the medial–lateral, superior–inferior and anterior–posterior directions for skin marker set-up were 2. 2, 3. 6 and 4. 5 mm (1 standard deviation). For our bony anatomy-based off-line protocol the prostate systematic set-up errors were 1. 6, 2. 5 and 4. 4 mm. For the online fiducial based set-up the results were 0. 5, 1. 4 and 1. 4 mm. A prostate systematic error of 10. 2 mm was uncorrected by the off-line bone protocol in one patient. Set-up margins calculated to encompass 98 % of prostate set-up shifts were 11 – 14 mm with bone off-line set-up and 4 – 7 mm with online fiducial markers. Margins from the van Herk margin recipe were generally 1 – 2 mm smaller. Bony anatomy-based set-up protocols improve the group prostate set-up error compared with skin marks; however, large prostate systematic errors can remain undetected or systematic errors increased for individual patients. The margin required for set-up errors was found to be 10 – 15 mm unless implanted fiducial markers are available for treatment guidance...|$|E
40|$|A quality {{assurance}} system in stereotactic radiosurgery and stereotactic fractionated radiotherapy, concerning the physical and dosimetric aspects, may be divided into three elements: (1) the preparation of reliable basic data for the computerized treatment planning system; (2) a control of the accelerator parameters prior to patient treatment; (3) preparation of the optimal treatment plan with the treatment planning system. Due to {{the small size of}} the beams formed by circular collimators (7. 5 – 35 mm diameter, BrainLab System) the smallest available detectors should be used for measurements – a diamond diode (0. 3 mm thickness) and a 0. 015 cm 3 ionization chamber (PTW Freiburg) are adequate to measure precisely TMR curves, beam profiles and output factors required for the treatment planning system BrainScan. The full control of accelerator parameters (Clinac 2300 C/D) necessary to safely carry out the treatment requires a comprehensive list of tests (an extended list of weekly checks including Winston-Lutz test). Testing procedure carried out with a set of specialized devices (Med-Tec, Radak, BrainLab) takes about two hours. Proper accelerator check and regulations allow for very precise patient positioning. Treatment planning (with the treatment planning system BrainScan) is based on a series of CT and MR scans with target volume and organs at risk marked on each slice by the radiotherapist. The planner has to select the positions of <b>isocentres</b> (up to 3), collimator diameters, number and range of the arcs. Additional parameters for optimization procedure are the total dose proportions delivered by each arc. The treatment plan evaluation is based on the analysis of DVHs for target volume and also for organs at risk (orbits, optical nerves, brain stem) in order to minimize the dose and volume irradiated. It was accepted that the dose uniformity factor, defined as a ratio Dmin/Dmax within the target volume, should be not less than 0. 8, and should approach 0. 9 as much as possible. The above-presented system of quality control, specifying tolerance limits of controlled parameters, assures safe and precise dose delivery in stereotactic radiotherapy...|$|E
40|$|An {{interactive}} 3 D target localisation and delineation tool {{has been}} developed for radiosurgery planning of arteriovenous malformations (AVMs). With this system, magnetic resonance (MR), MR angiography (MRA) and computed tomography (CT) volumes can be fused in stereotactic space. Stereotactic angiography (SA) images {{can be linked to}} the MRA volume by recovering the SA acquisition geometry. The MRA and SA images can be correlated (1) by ray-tracing through the MRA volume with the recovered SA acquisition geometry and overlaying the images onto the SA images and (2) by localising the AVM onto a volume rendered representation of the MRA with a 3 D cursor and projecting its position onto the SA images. Target contours can then be drawn on the MRA/MR/CT images and simultaneously projected onto the SA images. The plans of patients who had previously undergone radiosurgery at our institution employing SA images for localisation and MR images for delineation were investigated. MRA datasets were also acquired at the time of MR scanning employing the 3 D TOF technique. Some ray-traced MRA images correlated well visually with the SA images, others presented inconsistencies which suggest that MRA should be used only as complement to SA images. The role of the different modalities (M-RA, MR and SA) in the definition of target volumes is investigated by defining the target contours with different combinations of modalities within the interactive system. The target volumes drawn with different modalities were compared to a reference volume, drawn using MRA, MR and SA images, and presented underestimation and overestimation of target volumes ranging from 20 % to 92 % and from 3 % to 40 %. The dosimetric implications of image fusion for target delineation are investigated by retrospective evaluation of the dose coverage of the reference target volume by the original treatment plan. Target coverage inferior to 60 % of the reference target volumes by the original treatment plans was obtained for the patients. Treatment plan optimisation was performed to evaluate the possible dosimetric improvements resulting from image fusion for AVM target delineation. The plans were improved by employing three, eight and four <b>isocentres</b> for the 3 patients, and resulted in target coverage equal or superior to 98 % for all three patients...|$|E

In recent years, several reports have been developed addressing {{issues related to the}} commissioning and quality assurance (QA) of RTPSs. AimTo evaluate the differences between dose distributions obtained with different dose calculation algorithms implemented in TPSs for stereotactic irradiation. Materials and MethodsBrainLab's iPlan v. 3. 0. 2 RT Dose calculates by pencil beam algorithm, while Eclipse v. 7. 5. 18 (Varian Medical Systems) calculates by different types of pencil beam/AAA algorithms (selectable). ResultsThe largest difference was found in the lung patient, where a difference of 10. 3 % in the number of monitor units and 8. 3 % in dose to the <b>isocentre</b> occurred (with calculation by AAA algorithm of Eclipse in relation to iPlan PB algorithm). The average difference in all other cases (AAA compared to iPlan) was 2. 2 % for MUs and 1. 5 % for dose to the <b>isocentre.</b> The average difference in all other cases (PB compared to iPlan) was 1. 9 % for MUs and 3. 2 % for dose to the <b>isocentre.</b> When data were transferred from iPlan through DICOM RT to Eclipse, for all patients an <b>isocentre</b> shift was observed.

40|$|Doctor of Health ScienceIt is well {{documented}} that for prostate cancer patients undergoing radiation therapy there is a correlation between target volume displacement and changes in bladder and rectal volumes. However, these studies have used a methodology that has captured only a subset of all treatment positions. This research used daily Computer Tomography (CT) imaging to comprehensively assess organ volumes, organ motion and their effect on dose, something {{that has never been}} performed previously, thus adding considerably {{to the understanding of the}} topic. Daily CT images were obtained using a Siemens Primus Linear Accelerator equipped with an in-room Somatom CT unit in the accelerator suite, marketed as ‘Primatom’, to accurately position the patient prior to treatment delivery. The internal structures of interest were contoured on the planning workstation by the investigator. The daily volume and location of the organs were derived from the computer to assess and analyse internal organ motion. The planned dose distribution was then imported onto the treatment CT datasets and used to compare the planned dose to i) the actual isocentre, where the isocentre was actually placed for that fraction, ii) the uncorrected isocentre, by un-doing any on-line corrections performed by the treatment staff prior to treatment delivery, and iii) the future isocentre, by placing the isocentre relative to internal organ motion on a daily basis. The results of this study did not confirm a statistically significant decrease in rectum volumes over time (hypothesis 1), however large fluctuations in bladder volume were confirmed (hypothesis 2). Internal organ motion for the rectum and bladder was demonstrated to be related to organ filling. Ideal planning volumes for these organs have been reported to minimise systematic and random uncertainty in the treatment volumes. An observed decrease in prostate volume over time, a systematic uncertainty in the location of the prostate at the time of the planning CT scan and a significant relationship between prostate centre of volume and rectum and bladder volumes has resulted in a recommendation that patients should be re-scanned during treatment to ensure appropriate clinical target volume coverage. A significant relationship between rectal and bladder volumes and the dose delivered to these organs was found (hypothesis 3). The dose delivered to the planning target volume was not related to the rectal or bladder volumes, although it was related to the motion of these organs. Despite these results only minimal effects on the dose delivered to any of the three <b>isocentres</b> occurred, indicating that the planned dose was accurately delivered using the methodology presented here (hypothesis 4). However the results do indicate that the patient preparation instructions need to be improved if margins are to be reduced in the future. It is unrealistic to assume that Image Guided Radiation Therapy will ever become routine practice due to infrastructure costs and time limitations. This research will inform radiation therapy centres of the variables associated with prostate cancer treatment on a daily basis, something that has never before been realistically achievable. As a result centres will be able to devise protocols to improve treatment outcomes...|$|E

The TLDs were calibrated using 6 - and 18 -MV X-ray beam. Neutron dose equivalents measured with CR- 39 etch-track detectors were used to derive readout-to-neutron dose conversion factor for (6) LiF:Mg,Cu,P TLDs. Average neutron dose equivalents per 1 Gy of <b>isocentre</b> dose were 3. 8 ± 0. 9 mSv Gy(- 1) for thyroid and 7. 0 ± 5. 4 mSv Gy(- 1) for colon.

These events consist primarily of low-energy protons that produce a highly in-homogeneous depth–dose distribution.

Thorough characterization of spot profiles as a func-tion of energy, distance and RS position is critical to accurate treatment planning. At 105 MeV, the spot sigma is 234 mm at 4800 mm from the <b>isocentre</b> when the RS is installed at the nozzle. With the energy increased to 220 MeV, the spot sigma is 66 mm.

The accuracy and practicality of the EPID in-vivo dosimetry system was confirmed through a comparison with traditional TLD in-vivo measurements performed on five prostate patients.

40|$|Introduction This study {{investigated}} the sensitivity of calculated stereotactic radiotherapy and radiosurgery doses {{to the accuracy of}} the beam data used by the treatment planning system. Methods Two sets of field output factors were acquired using fields smaller than approximately 1 cm 2, for inclusion in beam data used by the iPlan treatment planning system (Brainlab, Feldkirchen, Germany). One set of output factors were measured using an Exradin A 16 ion chamber (Standard Imaging, Middleton, USA). Although this chamber has a relatively small collecting volume (0. 007 cm 3), measurements made in small fields using this chamber are subject to the effects of volume averaging, electronic disequilibrium and chamber perturbations. The second, more accurate, set of measurements were obtained by applying perturbation correction factors, calculated using Monte Carlo simulations according to a method recommended by Cranmer-Sargison et al. [1] to measurements made using a 60017 unshielded electron diode (PTW, Freiburg, Germany). A series of 12 sample patient treatments were used to investigate the effects of beam data accuracy on resulting planned dose. These treatments, which involved 135 fields, were planned for delivery via static conformal arcs and 3 DCRT techniques, to targets ranging from prostates (up to 8 cm across) to meningiomas (usually more than 2 cm across) to arterioveinous malformations, acoustic neuromas and brain metastases (often less than 2 cm across). <b>Isocentre</b> doses were calculated for all of these fields using iPlan, and the results of using the two different sets of beam data were evaluated. Results While the <b>isocentre</b> doses for many fields are identical (difference = 0. 0...|$|R
40|$|Purpose To assess out-of-field dose {{using three}} {{different}} variants of LiF thermoluminescence dosimeters (TLD) for ten patients who underwent stereotactic ablative body radiotherapy (SABR) for primary {{renal cell carcinoma}} (RCC) and compare with treatment planning system (TPS) dose calculations. Methods and materials Thermoluminescent dosimeter (TLD) measurements were conducted at 20, 30, 40 and 50 cm from <b>isocentre</b> on ten patients undergoing SABR for primary RCC. Three types of high-sensitivity LiF:Mg,Cu,P TLD material with different 6 Li/ 7 Li isotope ratios were used. Patient plans were calculated using Eclipse Anisotropic Analytical Algorithm (AAA) for clinical evaluation and recalculated using Pencil Beam Convolution (PBC) algorithm for comparison. Results Both AAA and PBC showed diminished accuracy for photon doses at increasing distance out-of-field. At 50 cm, measured photon dose was 0. 3 cGy normalised to a 10 Gy prescription on average with only small variation across all patients. This is likely due to the leakage component of the out-of-field dose. The 6 Li-enriched TLD materials showed increased signal attributable to additional neutron contribution. Conclusion LiF:Mg,Cu,P TLD containing 6 Li is sensitive enough to measure out-of-field dose 50 cm from <b>isocentre</b> however will over-estimate the photon component of out-of-field dose in high energy treatments due {{to the presence of}} thermal neutrons. 7 Li enriched materials which are insensitive to neutrons are therefore required for accurate photon dosimetry. Neutron signal has been shown here to increase with MUs and is higher for patients treated using certain non coplanar beam arrangements. Further work is required to convert this additional neutron signal to dose...|$|R
40|$|The 1. 5 T Elekta MR-Linac, {{due to the}} {{construction}} of the system will have a maximum radiation field size in the superior-inferior patient direction of 22 cm at <b>isocentre.</b> The field size may impact on the patient groups which can be treated on the system. This technical note aims to address the question of which treatment sites will be affected by field size limitations on the MR-Linac. Using historical data for 11 595 cases over 2 yr treated at the authors' institution, the proportion of plans that would fit the MR-Linac's field size was determined for eleven patient groups. In addition, cervix plans were analyzed to determine the length of the two Clinical Target Volumes (CTVs) and any overlap between them. With a 1 cm margin to allow for online plan adaption, 80 % of all plans would be suitable for the MR-Linac due to the field size. This percentage increases to 100 % for smaller tumor volumes such as prostate and brain. However, for cervix and three dose-level head and neck plans the percentage becomes 61 % and 66 %, respectively. The maximum radiation field size of the MR-Linac in the superior-inferior patient direction is 22 cm. With a 1 cm margin approximately 80 % of all plans would be suitable for the MR-Linac with the available field size, decreasing to 61 % for larger tumor volumes. For cervix patients this may motivate investigations into treating each CTV with a separate <b>isocentre,</b> allowing for careful control of matching field...|$|R
40|$|Mechanical {{structures}} {{capable of}} delivering a therapy beam for cancer treatment from any direction {{to the patient}} are called medical gantries. Typically, a gantry rotates around the patient who is kept in the supine position (rotating gantries). In Europe several currently proposed clinic facilities for ion therapy want to install an ion gantry equipped with a pencil-beam scanning system. Such a treatment apparatus allows the optimisation of the dose-to-target conformity, but the active pencil-beam scanning increases the demands considerably on the beam transport accuracy. Usually, a sub-millimetre precision of the beam position at the patient (i. e. in the gantry <b>isocentre)</b> is {{required in order to}} treat tumours in the vicinity of critical organs, {{which is one of the}} main domains of ion therapy [...] ...|$|R
40|$|Despite {{the highly}} {{localized}} doses {{that may be}} delivered via stereotactic radiotherapy, a small dose is nonetheless delivered to out-of-field regions, which may cause detriment to the patient. In this work, a systematic set of dose measurements have been undertaken up to a distance of 45 cm from the <b>isocentre,</b> for stereotactic fields shaped by a BrainLAB mini-multileaf collimator (MMLC) mounted on a Varian 600 C linear accelerator. A range of treatment parameters were varied so as to determine the factors of greatest influence and establish relationships with dose. The commercial treatment planning software (TPS) miscalculates the dose to out-of-field regions. Measured dose decreases consistently out to 45 cm, whereas the TPS decreases out to 10 - 15 cm, {{at which point the}} predicted dose is constant. At the 5 - 10 cm off-axis distance (OAD), measurements indicate doses of about 5 - 10 % of the dose at the <b>isocentre,</b> 1 % at 15 cm OAD and 0. 1 % at 45 cm OAD. There are several observed trends. Greater MMLC field sizes (with static jaw) result in higher out-of-field dose, as do shallower depths. The source-to-surface distance does not greatly influence peripheral dose. However, the results given in this work do indicate that simple treatment arrangements, such as preferable collimator rotation, would in certain cases reduce out-of-field dose by an order of magnitude. Peripheral dose raises questions of treatment optimization, particularly in cases where patients have a long life expectancy in which secondary effects may become manifest, such as in the treatment of paediatric patients or those with a non-malignant primary. For instance, for a 20 Gy hypo-fractionated treatment, dose to out-of-field regions is of the order of cGy - a substantial dose in radiation protection terms...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to model and assess the impact of {{systematic}} and random uncertainties in patient positioning and treatment delivery in prostate bed Intensity Modulated Radiation Therapy (IMRT) and Volumetric Modulated Arc Therapy (VMAT) performed with and without an EndoRectal Balloon (ERB) insertion. CT and contour data from four post-prostatectomy patients with and without an ERB insertion were considered for the study [1]. A step and shoot IMRT plan and single arc VMAT plan using a 6 MV photon beam model for an Elekta-Synergy accelerator was generated on both data sets (ERB and NOERB) using the Pinnacle planning system. A total of 960 plans were generated. 560 plans were generated with random uncertainties introduced. The magnitude of these uncertainties was a number chosen randomly within the range of ± 2 mm in steps of 0. 5 mm for MLC and jaw positions and ± 1, in steps of 0. 5 o for gantry and collimator angles. Treatment <b>isocentre</b> positions were also simulated by introducing random uncertainties within the range of ± 3 mm to each of the original <b>isocentre</b> co-ordinates. 384 plans were generated with systematic uncertainties introduced for MLC open/close and MLC shift within the range of ± 3 mm, in steps of 1 mm for the jaw and MLCs and ± 3 o, in steps of 1 o for the collimator and gantry. An additional 16 baseline plans were calculated with no uncertainties introduced. Clinical endpoints were assessed by calculating the Tumour Control Probability and Normal Tissue Complication Probability for the plan with systematic uncertainties. The random uncertainty simulated plans were recalculated and the impact of random uncertainties on IMRT plans with ERB and NOERB was studied by assessing the dose change in D 95 for PTV and CTV...|$|R
40|$|Electron arc {{therapy is}} a special {{radiotherapeutic}} technique using a rotational electron beam {{in the treatment of}} large superficial tumours following curved surfaces. In those cases, arc therapy offers the best way to optimize dose uniformity while sparing healthy tissues and critical organs. The use of this technique overcomes under or over dosage problems caused by field junctions. However, electron arc therapy presents important challenges in terms of dosimetry and treatment planning. Clinical implementation of electron arc therapy requires the study of many parameters of influence such as the radius of curvature of the treated surface, the width of the treatment field, the total angle of irradiation and the beam energy. Monitor unit calculation to deliver prescribed dose is a very critical topic and, in general, requires acquisition of a large amount of measured dosimetric data. This project concerns the clinical implementation of electron arc therapy using an Elekta SL- 25 linear accelerator in the radiation oncology department of the Maisonneuve-Rosemont Hospital (Montreal, Canada). Firstly, the objective of the study is to observe the influence of the radius of curvature, the total arc angle and the field width on the following dosimetric parameters: depth of maximum dose, isodose distributions and electron arc beam output at the depth of maximum dose. Secondly, for our particular setup, the goal is to develop a simple monitor unit calculation method, based on an analytical model fitted through measured dosimetric data covering a large range of possible clinical situations. In order to achieve these goals, electron arc irradiations were performed on cylindrical acrylic phantoms of different radii, successively varying the total arc angle and the field width at <b>isocentre.</b> Results obtained with thermoluminescent dosimeters show a minor impact of the radius of curvature variation on the percent depth dose curves. However, they show {{a significant impact on the}} beam output. It was also observed that the total arc angle influences the dose at the depth of maximum dose only up to a limit angle value, different for each radius of curvature. Finally, the field width at <b>isocentre</b> has an impact on the beam output as well as on the bremsstrahlung contribution at the <b>isocentre.</b> Concerning the monitor unit calculation, a seven parameter analytical model fitted through measured data was obtained using Origin 7 software. A relationship giving the beam output as a function of the radius of curvature and the total arc angle was found. The field width was not included in the model, but will be part of further investigation before clinical implementation. As future work, dosimetric measurements with other energies should be carried on, mainly to be able to cover a wider range of clinical cases...|$|R
