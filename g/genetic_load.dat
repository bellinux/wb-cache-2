25|$|In {{a series}} of {{experiments}} beginning in the mid-1880s, Theodor Boveri gave the definitive demonstration that chromosomes are the vectors of heredity. His two principles were the continuity of chromosomes and the individuality of chromosomes. It is the second of these principles that was so original. Wilhelm Roux suggested that each chromosome carries a different <b>genetic</b> <b>load.</b> Boveri was able to test and confirm this hypothesis. Aided by the rediscovery {{at the start of}} the 1900s of Gregor Mendel's earlier work, Boveri was able to point out the connection between the rules of inheritance and the behaviour of the chromosomes. Boveri influenced two generations of American cytologists: Edmund Beecher Wilson, Nettie Stevens, Walter Sutton and Theophilus Painter were all influenced by Boveri (Wilson, Stevens, and Painter actually worked with him).|$|E
25|$|The {{formation}} of proliferating buds {{is one of}} several unusual adaptations for reproduction in this species. The buds form near the base of the stipe, and when covered with soil, can grow into new individuals as the frond that bore them dies. Ebony spleenwort is also well-adapted to propagate by spores: the upright sterile fronds help the spores enter the airstream for long-distance dispersal, and a low <b>genetic</b> <b>load</b> allows spores that have grown into a gametophyte to self-fertilize {{with a high degree of}} success. This dispersal ability seems to have helped the species spread rapidly in the Great Lakes region in the late 20th century. Long-distance dispersal may also explain its naturalized appearance in South Africa; the same mechanism may have given rise to an isolated population found in Slovakia in 2009, its first known occurrence in Europe.|$|E

40|$|Background Grey matter, both {{volume and}} concentration, has been {{proposed}} as an endophenotype for schizophrenia given a number of reports of grey matter abnormalities in relatives of patients with schizophrenia. However, previous studies on grey matter abnormalities in relatives have produced inconsistent results. The aim {{of the present study}} was to examine grey matter differences between controls and siblings of patients with schizophrenia and to examine whether the age, <b>genetic</b> <b>loading</b> or subclinical psychotic symptoms of selected individuals could explain the previously reported inconsistencies. Methods We compared the grey matter volume and grey matter concentration of healthy siblings of patients with schizophrenia and healthy controls matched for age, sex and education using voxel-based morphometry (VBM). Furthermore, we selected subsamples based on age (< 30 yr), <b>genetic</b> <b>loading</b> and subclinical psychotic symptoms to examine whether this would lead to different results. Results We included 89 siblings and 69 controls in our study. The results showed that siblings and controls did not differ significantly on grey matter volume or concentration. Furthermore, specifically selecting participants based on age, <b>genetic</b> <b>loading</b> or subclinical psychotic symptoms did not alter these findings. Limitations The main limitation was that subdividing the sample resulted in smaller samples for the subanalyses. Furthermore, we used MRI data from 2 different scanner sites. Conclusion These results indicate that grey matter measured through VBM might not be a suitable endophenotype for schizophrenia...|$|R

25|$|While DNA {{is able to}} {{recombine}} {{to modify}} alleles, DNA is also susceptible to mutations within the sequence that can affect an organism in a negative manner. Asexual organisms {{do not have the}} ability to recombine their genetic information to form new and differing alleles. Once a mutation occurs in the DNA or other genetic carrying sequence, there is no way for the mutation to be removed from the population until another mutation occurs that ultimately deletes the primary mutation. This is rare among organisms. Hermann Joseph Muller introduced the idea that mutations build up in asexual reproducing organisms. Muller described this occurrence by comparing the mutations that accumulate as a ratchet. Each mutation that arises in asexually reproducing organisms turns the ratchet once. The ratchet is unable to be rotated backwards, only forwards. The next mutation that occurs turns the ratchet once more. Additional mutations in a population continually turn the ratchet and the mutations, mostly deleterious, continually accumulate without recombination. These mutations are passed onto the next generation because the offspring are exact genetic clones of their parent. The <b>genetic</b> <b>load</b> of organisms and their populations will increase due to the addition of multiple deleterious mutations and decrease the overall reproductive success and fitness.|$|E

40|$|Background: Symptomatology in psychoses can be {{summarised}} as quantitative symptom dimensions, {{but their}} genetic basis is unknown. Aims: To investigate whether genes make {{an important contribution}} to symptom dimensions. Method; A total of 224 probandwise twin pairs (106 monozygotic, 118 same-gender dizygotic) where probands had psychosis were ascertained from the Maudsley Twin Register in London. Factor analysis was performed on lifetime symptoms rated on the Operational Checklist for Psychotic Disorders (OPCRIT). Correlations of dimension scores within monozygotic and dizygotic pairs concordant for Research Diagnostic Criteria psychoses were performed. Relationships between dimension scores and <b>genetic</b> <b>loading</b> for psychoses were assessed using logistic regression. Results: Patterns of familial aggregation consistent with a genetic effect were found for the disorganised dimension and for some measures of the negative, manic and general psychotic dimensions. Disorganised dimension scores were related significantly to <b>genetic</b> <b>loading</b> for psychoses. Conclusions: The disorganised dimension, and possibly other symptom dimensions, may be useful phenotypes for molecular genetic studies of psychoses. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

40|$|MS is {{believed}} to be a complex trait determined by genetic and nongenetic factors. Data suggest that MS susceptibility and age at onset are each, at least to some extent, under genetic control. The present study carefully examined five covariates (sex of the index case, sex of the sibling, birth cohort of the sibling [or = 1940], age of MS onset in the index patient (40 years), and MS disease status of the parents [i. e., MS present in one parent or no parent with MS]) that may influence the familial risk of MS in a large cohort of 1, 896 MS patients and 8, 878 of their first-degree relatives. Of these, sex of the sibling, parental MS status, and index patient onset age were the important factors influencing MS risks to siblings. The results of this study are (1) the index-patient-onset-age effect suggests that individuals with a greater <b>genetic</b> <b>loading</b> (i. e., a greater contribution of susceptibility alleles) have an earlier age at onset and (2) <b>genetic</b> <b>loading</b> is substantially increased in individuals with an affected parent.

2500|$|A {{variety of}} adaptations make A.platyneuron an {{aggressive}} colonizer, even weedy, {{when compared with}} other spleenworts, although a warming climate {{and an increase in}} second growth habitats may also {{have played a role in}} its expansion in the Great Lakes region. It tolerates broad variation in soil conditions, including pH, and will grow in both sun and shade. The starchy stipe bases provide energy for rapid growth in the spring, allowing the fronds to keep ahead of competing vegetation. The erect fertile fronds, unusual for Asplenium, help release spores into the wind for long-distance dispersal, while the proliferative buds allow clonal propagation in moist, fertile habitats. The species also carries a very low <b>genetic</b> <b>load,</b> so that viable sporophytes can develop from intragametophytic self-fertilization with 83–89% success. This means that new sporophytes can usually grow from the gametophyte formed from a single spore. This has allowed ebony spleenwort to be an early colonizer, from distant locations, of recently disturbed habitats, such as coal spoils in southern Iowa. The appearance of A.platyneuron in a disturbed habitat in Slovakia, [...] is probably the result of long-distance dispersal, which may also have allowed it to colonize and naturalize in South Africa.|$|E
50|$|One {{problem with}} calculating <b>genetic</b> <b>load</b> {{is that it}} is {{difficult}} to evaluate either the theoretically optimal genotype, or the maximally fit genotype actually present in the population.

50|$|<b>Genetic</b> <b>load</b> is the {{difference}} between the fitness of an average genotype in a population and the fitness of some reference genotype, which may be either the best present in a population, or may be the theoretically optimal genotype.

40|$|Background: The Th 17 /IL 23 pathway {{has both}} genetically and biologically {{been implicated in}} the {{pathogenesis}} of the inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), Crohn's disease, and ulcerative colitis. So far, it is unknown whether and how associated risk variants affect expression of the genes encoding for Th 17 /IL 23 pathway proteins. Methods: Ten IBD-associated SNPs residing near Th 17 /IL 23 genes were used to construct a genetic risk model in 753 Dutch IBD cases and 1045 controls. In an independent cohort of 40 Crohn's disease, 40 ulcerative colitis, and 40 controls, the <b>genetic</b> risk <b>load</b> and presence of IBD were correlated to quantitative PCR-generated messenger RNA (mRNA) expression of 9 representative Th 17 /IL 23 genes in both unstimulated and PMA/CaLo stimulated {{peripheral blood mononuclear cells}}. In 1240 individuals with various immunological diseases with whole genome genotype and mRNA-expression data, we also assessed correlation between <b>genetic</b> risk <b>load</b> and differential mRNA expression and sought for SNPs affecting expression of all currently known Th 17 /IL 23 pathway genes (cis-expression quantitative trait locus). Results: The presence of IBD, but not the <b>genetic</b> risk <b>load,</b> was correlated to differential mRNA expression for IL 6 in unstimulated peripheral blood mononuclear cells and to IL 23 A and RORC in response to stimulation. The cis-expression quantitative trait locus analysis showed little evidence for correlation between <b>genetic</b> risk <b>load</b> and mRNA expression of Th 17 /IL 23 genes, because we identified for only 2 of 22 Th 17 /IL 23 genes a cis-expression quantitative trait locus single nucleotide polymorphism that is also associated to IBD (STAT 3 and CCR 6). Conclusions: Our results suggest that only the presence of IBD and not the <b>genetic</b> risk <b>load</b> alters mRNA expression levels of IBD-associated Th 17 /IL 23 genes...|$|R

This study compared the niacin flush response in subjects from families with only one member affected with schizophrenia (simplex families) with those from families having a sib-pair with schizophrenia (multiplex families). Subjects were patients with schizophrenia and their nonpsychotic first-degree relatives from simplex families (176 probands, 260 parents, and 80 siblings) and multiplex families (311 probands, 180 parents, and 52 siblings) as well as 94 healthy controls. Niacin patches of 3 concentrations (0. 001 M, 0. 01 M, and 0. 1 M) were applied to forearm skin, and the flush response was rated at 5, 10, and 15 minutes, respectively, with a 4 -point scale. More attenuated flush response to topical niacin was shown in schizophrenia probands and their relatives from multiplex families than in their counterparts from simplex families, and the differentiation was better revealed using 0. 1 M concentration of niacin than 0. 01 M or 0. 001 M. For the highest concentration of 0. 1 M and the longest time lag of 15 minutes, a subgroup of probands (23 %), parents (27 %), and siblings (19 %) still exhibited nonflush response. Flush response to niacin skin patch is more impaired in schizophrenia patients and their relatives from families with higher <b>genetic</b> <b>loading</b> for schizophrenia, and this finding has implications for future genetic dissection of schizophrenia. © 2008 The Authors. published_or_final_versio...|$|R
