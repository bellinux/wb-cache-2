500|$|In 1983, Chéreau {{directed}} the film The Wounded Man (L'Homme Blessé), {{a more personal}} project for him. He and his co-writer, Hervé Guibert, worked for six years on the scenario, which tells of a love affair between an older man involved in prostitution and a teenage boy, a dark view {{in the context of}} HIV/AIDS. His 1994 film was La Reine Margot, based on the 1845 historical novel of the same name by Alexandre Dumas. It won the Jury Prize and Best Actress Award (Virna Lisi) at Cannes, as well as five César Awards. Set in the 16th-century, depicting the conflict between Catholics and Protestants in France, it shows battles and the St Bartholomew's day massacre. A scene of the queen with the head of her lover is reminiscent of the opera Salome, uniting cult and obsession ("Einheit von Kult und Obsession"), as Koch remarks. The film was Chéreau's longest, most expensive production, and his greatest financial success. [...] "t was erotic and violent, and offers poured in from Hollywood," [...] but, he said, [...] "I was always being offered films based in the Renaissance and involving a massacre. <b>I</b> <b>even</b> <b>had</b> an offer from the UK to do a film about Guy Fawkes." [...] He refused similar offers: [...] "It's useless to repeat something you already did." ...|$|E

She {{was enrolled}} in ballet at three and showed her natural talent for acting in her primary and high school years. She says that she was first inspired to become an actress upon seeing Margaret Hamilton's performance as the Wicked Witch of the West in The Wizard of Oz. Kidman has revealed that she was timid as a child, saying, [...] "I am very shy– really shy– <b>I</b> <b>even</b> <b>had</b> a stutter as a kid, which I slowly got over, but I still regress into that shyness. So I don't like walking into a crowded restaurant by myself; I don't like going to a party by myself." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1951, Hughes {{initially}} studied English at Pembroke College under M.J.C. Hodgart, {{an authority}} on balladic forms. Hughes felt encouraged and supported by Hodgart's supervision, but attended few lectures and wrote no more poetry at this time, feeling stifled by literary academia and the [...] "terrible, suffocating, maternal octopus" [...] of literary tradition. He wrote, [...] "I might say, that I had as much talent for Leavis-style dismantling of texts as anyone else, <b>I</b> <b>even</b> <b>had</b> a special bent for it, nearly a sadistic streak there, {{but it seemed to}} me not only a foolish game, but deeply destructive of myself." [...] In his third year, he transferred to anthropology and archaeology, both of which would later inform his poetry. He did not excel as a scholar. His first published poetry appeared in Chequer. A poem [...] "The little boys and the seasons", written during this time, was published in Granta, under the pseudonym Daniel Hearing.|$|E

2500|$|Jobs did not contact {{his birth}} family during Clara's (his adoptive mother) lifetime, however. He would later tell his {{official}} biographer Walter Isaacson: [...] "I never wanted [...] {{to feel like}} I didn't consider them my parents, because they were totally my parents [...] I loved them so much that I never wanted them to know of my search, and <b>I</b> <b>even</b> <b>had</b> reporters keep it quiet when any of them found out." [...] However, in 1986 when he was 31, Clara was diagnosed with lung cancer. He began to {{spend a great deal}} of time with her and learned more details about her background and his adoption, information that motivated him to find his biological mother. Jobs found on his birth certificate the name of the San Francisco doctor to whom Schieble had turned when she was pregnant. Although the doctor did not help Jobs while he was alive, he left a letter for Jobs to be opened upon his death. As he died soon afterwards, Jobs was given the letter which stated that [...] "his mother had been an unmarried graduate student from Wisconsin named Joanne Schieble." ...|$|E

60|$|On this occasion, too, I {{began to}} have a new fancy, for fancy or {{illusion}} I was determined to regard it, that some swift-footed being was treading the ground near me; that I occasionally caught the faint rustle of a light footstep, and detected a motion in leaves and fronds and thread-like stems of creepers hanging near the surface, as if some passing body had touched and made them tremble; and once or twice that <b>I</b> <b>even</b> <b>had</b> a glimpse of a grey, misty object moving at no great distance in the deeper shadows.|$|E

So the Syrian Prince was introduced to the Royal equerry, and a great many compliments passed between us. <b>I</b> <b>even</b> <b>had</b> the audacity to state that on my very last interview with my Royal master, His Royal Highness had said, [...] "Colonel Titmarsh, when you go to Beyrout, you will make special inquiries regarding my interesting friend Cogia Hassan." ...|$|E

5000|$|The {{combination}} of bright lights on-set and working under sunlight while filming Black Sheep caused permanent damage to David Spade's eyes.

I've become such a pain in the butt with this light-sensitive thing, it's a wonder they don't Just Shoot Me!" ...|$|R
6000|$|My {{imagination}} {{carried me}} {{so far that}} <b>I</b> <b>even</b> <b>had</b> the refusal of several farms--the refusal was all I wanted--but I never got my fingers burned by actual possession. The nearest that I came to actual possession was when I bought the Hollowell place, and had begun to sort my seeds, and collected materials with which to make a wheelbarrow to carry it on or off with; but before the owner gave me a deed of it, his wife--every man has such a wife--changed her mind and wished to keep it, and he offered me ten dollars to release him. Now, to speak the truth, I had but ten cents in the world, and it surpassed my arithmetic to tell, if I was that man who had ten cents, or who had a farm, or ten dollars, or all together. However, I let him keep the ten dollars and the farm too, for I had carried it far enough; or rather, to be generous, I sold him the farm for just what I gave for it, and, as {{he was not a}} rich man, made him a present of ten dollars, and still had my ten cents, and seeds, and materials for a wheelbarrow left. I found thus that I had been a rich man without any damage to my poverty. But I retained the landscape, and I have since annually carried off what it yielded without a wheelbarrow.

This I soon received, [...] and found, as I expected, that he was in towering wrath against my [...] brother for his disobedience; and, after some time, <b>I</b> <b>even</b> <b>had</b> [...] reason to think, (as how could it be otherwise, Harry?) that, on [...] becoming better acquainted with the merits and amiable manners of [...] his apparent heir, he lost any desire which he might formerly have [...] entertained, of accomplishing any change in my circumstances in [...] relation to the world.

6000|$|... "I hadn't any {{interest}} in Canada, except to get the child away," [...] said Mrs. Hasketh. [...] "Sometimes it seemed strange we should be in Canada, and not Mr. Tedham! She got acquainted with some little girls {{who were going to}} a convent school there as externes--outside pupils, you know," [...] Mrs. Hasketh explained to my wife. [...] "She got very fond of one of them--she is a child of very warm affections. I never denied that Mr. Tedham had warm affections--and when her little girl friend went into the convent to go on with her education there, Fay wanted to go too, and--we let her. That was when she was twelve, and Mr. Hasketh felt that he ought to come back and look after his business here; and we left her in the convent. Just as soon as she was out of the way, and out of the question, it seemed as if I got to feeling differently toward Mr. Tedham. I don't mean to say I ever got to like him, or that I do to this day; but I saw that he had some rights, too, and for years and years I wanted to take the child and tell her when he was coming out. I used to ask myself what right <b>I</b> <b>even</b> <b>had</b> to keep the child from the suffering. The suffering was hers by rights, and she ought to go through it. I got almost crazy thinking it over. I got to thinking that her share of her father's shame might be the very thing, of all things, that was to discipline her and make her a good and useful woman; and that's much more than being a happy one, Mrs. March; we can't any of us be truly happy, no matter what's done for us. I tried to make believe that I was sparing her alone, but I knew I was sparing myself, too, and that made it harder to decide."

60|$|I {{was seldom}} {{at home in}} the evening, for when I {{attempted}} to occupy myself in my apartments the lamplight brought in a swarm of noxious insects, and it was too hot for closed windows. Accordingly I spent the late hours either on the water (the moonlight of Venice is famous), or in the splendid square which serves as a vast forecourt to the strange old basilica of Saint Mark. I sat in front of Florian's cafe, eating ices, listening to music, talking with acquaintances: the traveler will remember how the immense cluster of tables and little chairs stretches like a promontory into the smooth lake of the Piazza. The whole place, of a summer's evening, under the stars and with all the lamps, all the voices and light footsteps on marble (the only sounds of the arcades that enclose it), is like an open-air saloon dedicated to cooling drinks and to a still finer degustation--that of the exquisite impressions received during the day. When I did not prefer to keep mine to myself there was always a stray tourist, disencumbered of his Baedeker, to discuss them with, or some domesticated painter rejoicing in the return of the season of strong effects. The wonderful church, with its low domes and bristling embroideries, the mystery of its mosaic and sculpture, looking ghostly in the tempered gloom, and the sea breeze passed between the twin columns of the Piazzetta, the lintels of a door no longer guarded, as gently as if a rich curtain were swaying there. I used sometimes on these occasions to think of the Misses Bordereau and of the pity of their being shut up in apartments which in the Venetian July even Venetian vastness did not prevent from being stuffy. Their life seemed miles away from the life of the Piazza, and no doubt it was really too late to make the austere Juliana change her habits. But poor Miss Tita would have enjoyed one of Florian's ices, I was sure; sometimes <b>I</b> <b>even</b> <b>had</b> thoughts of carrying one home to her. Fortunately my patience bore fruit, and I was not obliged to do anything so ridiculous.|$|E
60|$|Going {{down from}} Jerusalem to Jericho I {{was more than}} once moved by a flippant and {{possibly}} profane memory of the swine that rushed down a steep place into the sea. I do not insist on the personal parallel; for whatever my points of resemblance to a pig I am not a flying pig, a pig with wings of speed and precipitancy; and if I am possessed of a devil, {{it is not the}} blue devil of suicide. But the phrase came back into my mind because going down to the Dead Sea does really involve rushing down a steep place. Indeed it gives a strange impression that the whole of Palestine is one single steep place. It is as if all other countries lay flat under the sky, but this one country had been tilted sideways. This gigantic gesture of geography or geology, this sweep as of a universal landslide, is {{the sort of thing that}} is never conveyed by any maps or books or even pictures. All the pictures of Palestine I have seen are descriptive details, groups of costume or corners of architecture, at most views of famous places; they cannot give the bottomless vision of this long descent. We went in a little rocking Ford car down steep and jagged roads among ribbed and columned cliffs; but the roads below soon failed us altogether; and the car had to tumble like a tank over rocky banks and into empty river-beds, long before it came to the sinister and discoloured landscapes of the Dead Sea. And the distance looks far enough on the map, and seems long enough in the motor journey, to make a man feel he has come to another part of the world; yet so much is it all a single fall of land that even when he gets out beyond Jordan in the wild country of the Shereef he can still look back and see, small and faint as if in the clouds, the spire of the Russian church (I fancy) upon the hill of the Ascension. And though the story of the swine is attached in truth to another place, I was still haunted with its fanciful appropriateness to this one, because of the very steepness of this larger slope and the mystery of that larger sea. <b>I</b> <b>even</b> <b>had</b> the fancy that one might fish for them and find them in such a sea, turned into monsters; sea-swine or four-legged fishes, swollen and with evil eyes, grown over with sea-grass for bristles; the ghosts of Gadara.|$|E
