25|$|But {{after seven}} months I {{dropped out of}} Dune, by then Rudy Wurlitzer {{had come up with}} a first-draft script which I felt was a decent {{distillation}} of Frank Herbert's. But I also realised Dune was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> lot more work—at least two and a half years' worth. And I didn't have the heart to attack that because my older brother Frank unexpectedly died of cancer while I was prepping the De Laurentiis picture. Frankly, that freaked me out.

Regarding the tonal quality of the score, Elfman stated, [...] "We're <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>an</b> approach that's old school but not self-consciously old-fashioned. Let the melodrama be melodrama, let everything be what it is. I also think there's the advantage that I'm able to write narratively, and when I'm able to write narratively I can also move quicker because that's my natural instincts, I can tell a story in the music." ...|$|R

I got so frightened my heart fell in my shoe. When he finally walked away, the director yelled 'Cut' and I had to take a long breather. But I could really relate to the lion. I feel like in a past life I was a lion or a cat or something." ...|$|E

500|$|Kosterman, who {{has played}} law {{enforcement}} officials before, initially turned down the role. After his agent informed him {{it would be a}} recurring role, and the producers were willing to pay him more than he made on any previous show, Kosterman decided to take the job. To executive producers Mark Verheiden and Greg Beeman, making Ethan the villain in [...] "Suspect" [...] was the ultimate [...] "red herring" [...] for audiences. Sheriff Ethan was originally <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> nurse hostage, but the ending was rewritten to leave Ethan as more of a sympathetic character. Mitchell prefers the filmed ending, as he could not see any reason why his character would suddenly become evil.

500|$|Later during January 2013, Solis {{confirmed}} {{her interest}} in the County Board of Supervisors race, saying [...] "I'm <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> look at it."

[...] It controls a workforce larger than the Labor Department's and its $26 billion budget is equivalent to that of an average U.S. state. Each member presiding over some two million constituents, three times that of Solis' old congressional district, and that it is quite possibly the fourth most powerful position in California politics, after Governor, U.S. Senator, and Mayor of Los Angeles. [...] The supervisors have long been nicknamed [...] "the five little kings".|$|E
500|$|Discussing the {{increasing}} popularity of unreliable narrators in television, Hawley {{said that he}} did not want the audience thinking that the series is a puzzle that needs to be solved, saying, [...] "We're <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> character out of confusion into clarity and an audience out of mystery into clarity"; this is seen in the season's latter episodes, which are more narratively straightforward after Haller becomes [...] "clear on what’s going on [...] we are as well." [...] A noted sequence in the season's penultimate episode sees Haller explain the series' backstory and events to himself (and the audience)—Haller was institutionalized not because of his abilities, but because his mind had been infected by the Shadow King. Hawley wanted to indicate to the audience that this would be the only sequence in the series so exposition heavy, and so it features Haller creating a class room environment within his mind to make the teaching purpose of the scene explicit.|$|E
5000|$|Barrie {{has been}} {{critical}} about the producers' decision to kill Alma {{in such a way}} and cancer organisations also highlighted inaccuracies with the plot.
