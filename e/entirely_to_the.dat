5|$|The Bebington Kop, simply {{referred}} to as the Kop, is a large single-tier, all-seater stand with a capacity of 5,696. Completed in 1995, it replaced the earlier open terrace (also called the Kop) which had stood behind the goal at the Bebington End. The Bebington Kop is also the biggest Kop stand in Non league football. Originally the Kop housed both home and away fans, split down the middle, and occasionally was handed <b>entirely</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> away fans. However, following the 2000 League Cup semi-final against Bolton, when the Kop was given <b>entirely</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> home fans, a campaign was begun to claim the Kop as a home end. From the 2000-01 season this became the case, with away fans housed in the Cowshed.|$|E
5|$|Like Bülow, Bache {{performed}} {{works from}} memory instead of from the printed page, {{at a time}} when doing so was a matter of open debate. Also like Bülow, he began giving recitals devoted <b>entirely</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> work of one composer. In 1879, he began giving all-Liszt recitals, and in 1883 he experimented with an all-Beethoven recital.|$|E

However, in 1985 it became possible to devote the extension <b>entirely</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Gallery's uses, due to a donation of almost £50 million from Lord Sainsbury and his brothers Simon and Sir Tim Sainsbury. A closed competition was held, and the schemes produced were noticeably more restrained than in the earlier competition.|$|E

However, he did express interest in seeing the finished product.|$|E
5|$|Deal Castle was {{increasingly}} resembling a private house, rather than purely a fortification, and {{this led to}} arguments in 1829 {{as to whether it}} should be subject to local taxation as a private dwelling, or continue to be exempt as a military site. The captaincy had long since become an honorary position, given out as a reward by the Crown. In 1898, the War Office agreed that the Office of Works should be consulted over any external alterations to the historic castle, and that the Office of Works would be responsible for paying for any resulting work. The War Office finally concluded in 1904 that the castle no longer had any value either as a defence or as a barracks, and transferred it <b>entirely</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Office of Works. When the captain was not in residence it was opened to visitors.|$|E

5|$|December 44 Museum, La Gleize, Belgium. A cosmetically {{restored}} Tiger II (production turret) Hull number 280273, {{built in}} October 1944. Turret number 213 from s.SS Pz.Abt 501. Displayed {{at the entrance}} to DECEMBER 44 MUSEUM Collections, a museum devoted <b>entirely</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Battle of the Bulge. This tank was abandoned in La Gleize on 24 December 1944, where the advance of Kampfgruppe Peiper was halted. The front part, about 1/3, of the gun barrel is restored with a Panther gun barrel and muzzle brake. It also has restored mudguards. It is stripped of exterior and internal fittings and most of the torsion bars are broken, but it still has its gearbox and engine in place.|$|E
5|$|In 1777, the Revolutionary War {{intensified}} in Kentucky. British {{lieutenant governor}} Henry Hamilton armed his Indian allies from his headquarters at Fort Detroit, {{encouraging them to}} wage war on the Kentucky settlers in hopes of reclaiming the region as their hunting ground. The Continental Army could spare no men for an invasion in the northwest or {{for the defense of}} Kentucky, which was left <b>entirely</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> local population. Clark spent several months defending settlements against the Indian raiders as a leader in the Kentucky County militia, while developing his plan for a long-distance strike against the British. His strategy involved seizing British outposts north of the Ohio River to destroy British influence among their Indian allies.|$|E
5|$|The most {{detailed}} account of this period is handed down to us by Tacitus, whose Annals dedicate the first six books <b>entirely</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> reign of Tiberius. Tacitus was a Roman senator, born {{during the reign of}} Nero in 56 AD, and consul suffect in AD 97. His text is largely based on the Acta Senatus (the minutes of the session of the Senate) and the Acta Diurna (a collection of the acts of the government and news of the court and capital), as well as speeches by Tiberius himself, and the histories of contemporaries such as Marcus Cluvius Rufus, Fabius Rusticus and Pliny the Elder (all of which are lost).|$|E

5|$|Coghlan {{directed}} {{his attention to}} Northern Rhodesia. Howard Moffat, his Minister for Mines and Works, had supervised mineral exploration in Northern Rhodesia twenty years earlier and so knew of the rich copper deposits across the Zambezi. However, Moffat's first public claim on the northern territory, in November 1925, was {{on the issue of}} control of the railway, which would grant control of the central African cattle trade. At the 1926 Imperial Conference in London, some degree of control over the railway was granted to Southern Rhodesia. There was also the issue of attracting labour for mines and farms from the far north and this gave impetus to Coghlan's and Moffat's territorial expansionism in Northern Rhodesia and Nyasaland. Coghlan called on Britain's Colonial Secretary, Leopold Amery, to give the North <b>entirely</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> South or at least the reversionary right to it but Amery refused this request. During his tour of Southern Rhodesia the following year, Amery appeared to give support to its claims to neighbouring territories. But by 1928, after Coghlan's death, both the Dominions Office and the Colonial Office were for maintaining Northern Rhodesia's territory intact, and favoured its association with the East African dependencies of Kenya, Tanganyika and Uganda.|$|E
5|$|Many of {{the free}} peasants of Anglo-Saxon society appear to have lost status and become indistinguishable from the non-free serfs. Whether this change was due <b>entirely</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> conquest is unclear, but the {{invasion}} and its after-effects probably accelerated a process already under way. The spread of towns and increase in nucleated settlements in the countryside, rather than scattered farms, was probably accelerated by {{the coming of the}} Normans to England. The lifestyle of the peasantry probably did not greatly change in the decades after 1066. Although earlier historians argued that women became less free and lost rights with the conquest, current scholarship has mostly rejected this view. Little is known about women other than those in the landholding class, so no conclusions can be drawn about peasant women's status after 1066. Noblewomen appear to have continued to influence political life mainly through their kinship relationships. Both before and after 1066 aristocratic women could own land, and some women continued {{to have the ability to}} dispose of their property as they wished.|$|E
