In the 2014 Orlando Classic semifinals against Tennessee on November 28, he posted 16 points. Then in the finals against #20 Michigan State on November 30, he contributed 4 blocks. On December 5 during the Big 12/SEC Challenge contest against Florida, Alexander posted a team-high 10 rebounds along with 12 points for his first collegiate double-double. On December 20, Alexander was {{expected}} to be in the starting lineup for the first time against Lafayette, but he was not. However, he started on December 22 against Temple. On January 19 against #19 Oklahoma, Alexander posted 13 points and 13 rebounds. The 13 rebounds in just 23 minutes played marked a career <b>high</b> <b>for</b> Alexander and an individual season <b>high</b> <b>for</b> the Jayhawks. Alexander was named Big 12 newcomer of the week on January 26, 2015. Alexander made his second start of the season on February 10 against Texas Tech, replacing Jamari Traylor in the lineup and posting 10 points, 4 blocks and 5 rebounds. On February 28, Alexander was inactivated due to an undisclosed NCAA investigation as a precautionary measure. He did not play any games after February 23 because of the investigation of his mother's initiation of pre-NBA draft loan processing.|$|E

40|$|We {{assessed}} {{the risk of}} overweight and obesity for six large migrant groups in Switzerland. We used population-based survey data form the Swiss Migrant Health Survey 2010 and the Swiss Health Survey 2007. The sample comprised permanent residents aged 17 - 64 years (n = 14, 637). Multivariate logistic regressions {{have been used to}} estimate odds ratios (OR). Compared with Swiss nationals, the odds of being obese were 1. 97 times <b>higher</b> <b>for</b> Turkish nationals (CI- 95 1. 26, 3. 07), 1. 73 times <b>higher</b> <b>for</b> Kosovan nationals (CI- 95 1. 09, 2. 74) and 3. 42 times <b>higher</b> <b>for</b> Serbs (CI- 95 2. 28, 5. 12). The chance of being obese was not statistically different between Swiss nationals and those from Portugal, Italy, and Germany. The chance of being overweight or obese (BMI ≥ 25) was <b>higher</b> <b>for</b> migrants than for Swiss nationals. The respective odds were 1. 54 times <b>higher</b> <b>for</b> nationals from Portugal (CI- 95 1. 13, 2. 11), 2. 05 times <b>higher</b> <b>for</b> those from Turkey (CI- 95 1. 50, 2. 78), 2. 67 times <b>higher</b> <b>for</b> those from Serbia (CI- 95 1. 93, 3. 68), 2. 68 times <b>higher</b> <b>for</b> those from Kosovo (CI- 95 2. 01, 3. 56), and 2. 16 times <b>higher</b> <b>for</b> nationals from Italy (CI- 95 1. 54, 3. 02).
