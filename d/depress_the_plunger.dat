(MMWR July 2009 pg. 27) • Vaccinate all healthy persons 2 – 49 years of age with TIV or LAIV (FluMist®) * • All persons who want {{to reduce the risk of}} influenza disease or transmitting it to others, should be vaccinated, I. ORDER: 1. Screen for contraindications. 2. Provide the current Vaccine Information Statement (VIS), answering any questions. 3. Obtain a signed Vaccine Administration Record (VAR). 4. While the recipient is in an upright position, head tilted back, place the tip just inside the nostril. With a single motion, depress plunger as rapidly as possible until the dose-divider clip prevents you from going further. Spray 0. 1 ml from the LAIV sprayer intranasally into one nostril.

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>plunger</b> is <b>depressed</b> to both draw up and {{dispense}} the liquid. Normal operation {{consists of}} <b>depressing</b> <b>the</b> <b>plunger</b> button to <b>the</b> first stop while the pipette {{is held in}} the air. The tip is then submerged in the liquid to be transported and <b>the</b> <b>plunger</b> is released in a slow and even manner. This draws the liquid up into the tip. The instrument is then moved to the desired dispensing location. <b>The</b> <b>plunger</b> is again <b>depressed</b> to <b>the</b> first stop, {{and then to the}} second stop, or 'blowout', position. This action will fully evacuate the tip and dispense the liquid. In an adjustable pipette, the volume of liquid contained in the tip is variable; it can be changed via a dial or other mechanism, depending on the model. Some pipettes include a small window which displays the currently selected volume. The plastic pipette tips are designed for aqueous solutions, and are not recommended for use with organic solvents that may dissolve the plastics of the tips or even the pipettes.|$|R

40|$|Hugh E Hetherington, 1 Jon E Block 2 1 Bozeman Deaconess Health Group, Bozeman, MT, USA; 2 The Jon Block Group, San Francisco, CA, USA Objective: To {{evaluate}} the initial clinical {{performance of a}} prototype injection control device (ICD) to facilitate fat grafting by injection. Methods: An ICD, which mechanically couples the act of withdrawing the cannula with <b>the</b> act of <b>depressing</b> <b>the</b> <b>plunger,</b> was fabricated {{for the purpose of}} facial fat grafting. The action of the device results in deposition of consistent threads of fat having a volume of approximately 33 uL per cm that the cannula is withdrawn, which is slightly less than the internal volume of a 12 -gauge cannula. A total of 26 patients underwent 30 procedures, and the results were subjectively evaluated using pre- and postoperative photographs, with a minimum follow-up of 4 months. Results: The desired degree of correction was more consistent, recovery was faster, and procedural efficiency was improved when performing the procedure with the ICD compared to historical use of the manual method of injection. Minor irregularities were the only complications encountered. Conclusion: The ICD optimally distributes fat as a uniform thread along the withdrawal tract of the cannula, thereby eliminating clumping and minimizing tissue trauma, resulting in reduced recovery time as well as more consistent and predictable clinical results. Since the ICD automates the injection process, it provides a notable and easily attainable efficiency in procedural time and minimal learning curve for the user.

40|$|This article {{describes}} the design and evaluation of AutoSyP, a low-cost, low-power syringe pump intended to deliver intravenous (IV) infusions in low-resource hospitals. A constant-force spring within the device provides mechanical energy to <b>depress</b> <b>the</b> syringe <b>plunger.</b> As a result, the device can run on rechargeable battery power for 66 hours, a critical feature for low-resource settings where the power grid may be unreliable. The device {{is designed to be}} used with 5 - to 60 -mL syringes and can deliver fluids at flow rates ranging from 3 to 60 mL/hour. The cost of goods to build one AutoSyP device is approximately $ 500. AutoSyP was tested in a laboratory setting and in a pilot clinical study. Laboratory accuracy was within 4 % of the programmed flow rate. The device was used to deliver fluid to 10 healthy adult volunteers and 30 infants requiring IV fluid therapy at Queen Elizabeth Central Hospital in Blantyre, Malawi. The device delivered fluid with an average mean flow rate error of − 2. 3 % ± 1. 9 % for flow rates ranging from 3 to 60 mL/hour. AutoSyP has the potential to improve the accuracy and safety of IV fluid delivery in low-resource settings...|$|R
50|$|The grenade was a three-piece weapon, {{consisting}} of <b>the</b> <b>plunger</b> (or nostril), casing (body or orange shell, containing main charge), and tailpiece.
