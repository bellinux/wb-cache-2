50|$|Years later, Iron Man {{returned}} to Greece {{to investigate the}} death of a private investigator who had been hired to find out who had been stealing gold shipments bound for Stark Enterprises. Iron Man came across an undersea base containing Midas' Centurions. Midas joined the battle having been turned into a living being of gold as an after-effect of his powers being turned inward by Marianne Rodger's psi-powers. Midas tried to escape on a vehicle piloted by one of his Centurions after Iron Man defeated him. His weight and the supply of gold he had proved too much causing him to be accidentally thrown overboard. Iron Man searched the ocean bottoms for him, but couldn't find him. As Midas tried to <b>grab</b> <b>Iron</b> Man, his electrode shorted out causing Midas to sink to the mire.|$|E
5000|$|Secure <b>grab</b> <b>irons.</b> After July 1, 1895, unless Interstate Commerce Commission says otherwise, {{unlawful}} for RR {{company to}} use any car in interstate commerce that doesnâ€™t have secure <b>grab</b> <b>irons</b> or handholds in the ends and sides of each car (more secure for men who couple and uncouple cars.) ...|$|R
2500|$|The current [...] "Horsehead" [...] {{paint scheme}} for NS {{locomotives}} {{is black and}} white, with yellow <b>grab</b> <b>irons</b> and step-edge highlights. Locomotives feature a rearing horse decal enclosed in the [...] "catfish" [...] stripes on both the nose and rear, {{which is consistent with}} marketing campaigns where NS has billed itself as [...] "The Thoroughbred of Transportation".|$|R
50|$|Thrall {{was mainly}} a freight car {{fabrication}} and assembly operation. Additional car types manufactured included boxcars and gondolas. Most cars {{were designed for}} standard gauge interchange service on AAR-approved railroads within North America. Many tri-level autoracks built by Thrall exist today, identifiable by the blue Thrall rectangle logo present on either the extreme right or left end of the car side. Cast or forged parts, such as <b>grab</b> <b>irons,</b> trucks, axles, and wheels, were purchased from suppliers from the Chicago area.|$|R
50|$|Like most Proto 2000 models, this {{locomotive}} had two variations, both came {{in boxes}} {{that had the}} frame with the drive line separated form the body shell, each in its own compartment. The shell was almost the same on both. It was the proper width had the steps on the doors {{as well as all}} <b>grab</b> <b>irons</b> with vibrant paint. The main differences were that the mark I version had sunshades that attach with a cured looking bar. These shells, {{like the rest of the}} shells on these locomotives, set a new standard for detailing.|$|R
50|$|Assigned #2649 {{and painted}} in Santa Fe's {{blue and yellow}} Billboard scheme, the {{locomotive}} was placed into service in February 1970 and put through its paces during a series of shakedown runs between Cleburne and Dallas. The unit was officially unveiled to the public on March 13. This initial conversion was considered a success, though several key modifications were incorporated into future units. Based on input from trainmen within the Santa Fe system, the steps on were lowered and enlarged to provide better footing for the brakeman. Additionally, the <b>grab</b> <b>irons</b> were repositioned to enhance crew safety during switching movements.|$|R
5000|$|The {{second section}} prohibits such a carrier from hauling or using on its line in moving interstate traffic any car not {{equipped}} with couplers {{which can be}} coupled and uncoupled automatically [...] "without the necessity of men going between {{the ends of the}} cars", and the fourth section forbids the use in interstate commerce of any car not provided with secure <b>grab</b> <b>irons</b> or hand holds on the ends and sides of the car [...] "for greater security to men in coupling and uncoupling cars". The sixth section imposes for every violation of the act a penalty of $100.|$|R
5000|$|The Proto 1000 line {{originally}} {{was created to}} compete with Athearn products {{at a lower price}} point. The detailing was not as extensive as with the Proto 2000 line (as an example, details like <b>grab</b> <b>irons</b> or uncoupling bars were not included) so as to provide a model that was more resilient to handling by, and more attractive at lower price to, less-experienced modelers. However, the line included the proven smooth Proto 2000 drive, and the models would run as well as their better detailed, more expensive Proto 2000 cousins. Models released under the Proto 1000 line include the Budd RDC-1, -2, -3 and -4, Alco RS-2, Fairbanks-Morse [...] "Erie-Built," [...] and EMD F3 in A and B configuration.|$|R
5000|$|The Gremlin next {{appeared}} {{as the second}} Titanium Man, wearing a new suit of the power armor he had originally created for Boris Bullsky. With the other Soviet Super-Soldiers, he contended with the X-Men and Avengers {{in an attempt to}} capture Magneto. Later, the Gremlin fought Iron Man while wearing the Titanium Man armor during the [...] "Armor Wars". Iron Man - despite using his weaker stealth armor - managed to defeat the Crimson Dynamo in the fight but was unable to neutralize the Gremlin, who destroyed Iron Man's negator pack. When the Gremlin <b>grabbed</b> <b>Iron</b> Man and the armored Avenger attempted to escape, his booster jets ignited the titanium armor. The Titanium Man armor exploded, apparently burning the Gremlin to death and forcing Iron Man to flee.|$|R
50|$|The {{original}} law was {{amended by}} a subsequent act in 1903, whose first section provides that {{the requirements of}} the original act respecting train brakes, automatic couplers, and <b>grab</b> <b>irons</b> shall be held to apply to all trains and cars used on any railroad engaged in interstate commerce, unless a minor exception were satisfied. By its second section this act requires that not less than 50 percent of the cars in a train shall have their train brakes used and operated by the engineer on the locomotive, and confers upon the Interstate Commerce Commission (ICC) the authority to increase this minimum percentage to the end that the objects intended may be more fully accomplished. By an order promulgated June 6, 1910, the Commission increased the minimum number of cars whose train brakes must be under the engineer's control to 85 percent.|$|R
25|$|While the PATH {{resembles a}} typical intraurban heavy rail rapid transit system, {{it is in}} fact under the {{jurisdiction}} of the Federal Railroad Administration (FRA). PATH continues to be subject to FRA regulations because it used to share trackage with the Pennsylvania Railroad between Hudson interlocking near Harrison and Journal Square. In more recent past the line connected to the Amtrak mainline near Harrison station and also near Hudson tower. These connections have since been severed as the track layout at Hudson interlocking has been modified considerably. While PATH operates under several grandfather waivers, it is required to do things not typically seen on American transit systems. Some of these include the proper fitting of <b>grab</b> <b>irons</b> to all PATH rolling stock, the use of federally certified locomotive engineers, installation of positive train control (PTC), and compliance with the federal railroad hours of service regulations.|$|R
2500|$|EMD's diesel {{program was}} well {{underway}} {{in the late}} 1940s and early 1950s, thanks {{to the success of}} the company's FT demonstrations across the country. [...] While the F-units in production were great for moving trains over the railroad, their full-width carbody made it difficult for locomotive crews to see to the rear of the locomotive. This was considered a worthwhile sacrifice for a mainline locomotive, which was expected to do little switch work, since the full width carbody type was considered much more handsome and stylish, if lacking in the utility of the more functional looking switch engines, with their square lines, walkways and handrails, and narrow cowling covering their mechanical parts. [...] The F-units also lacked locations for brakemen or switchmen to stand and ride short distances while performing switching duties, such as the fore and aft platforms, footboards and handrails provided on diesel switchers, which were too small and slow for road service. [...] The F-units did have <b>grab</b> <b>irons</b> and stirrup steps, but these features were a hindrance in locations with tight clearances.|$|R

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{has investigated}} whether {{a combination of}} DEM and MBD {{can be used for}} a reliable and accurate environment for predicting grab unloading performance. A grab is a type of bulk material handling equipment used for unloading materials such as coal and iron ore from vessel to shore. Both a <b>grab</b> and <b>iron</b> ore pellets have been modelled and coupled into a co-simulation. Particle stiffness reductions and coarse graining techniques have been developed and applied to reduce computational costs. The developed large scale coupled grab-pellets model compared very well with validation experiments conducted on a bulk terminal with a scissors grab. A demonstration of virtual prototyping of grabs showed that when this model is implemented in the grab design process significant improvements in grab performance can be achieved.

50|$|Eight-Ball and {{the other}} carnies tie Lynne up in a cellar for her own good {{as well as the}} people. Yang removes her blades, agreeing with the carnies. Lynne manages to free herself with a {{concealed}} knife in her boot. The Colonel has the Hispanic woman's daughters cleaned to be raped, but Lynne, disguised as a prostitute, offers herself instead. She fools the Colonel, thinking she will be able to kill him when he reveals he recognized her after smelling her neck. The Colonel's men rush in to hold Lynne down to the bed. Back in the laundry, the carnies run in looking for Lynne, and Yang realizes where she is. He <b>grabs</b> an <b>iron</b> and shatters the seal on his sword to free it. Far away, Saddest Flute jerks up from meditation, sensing the seal break, and is aware of Yang's location.|$|R
5000|$|According to Asbury, Dolan {{attacked}} Noe with eye gougers before {{beating him}} to death with an iron bar. According to the Times, the burglar struck Noe {{on the head with}} a rattan cane, then <b>grabbed</b> an <b>iron</b> tube ("paint-iron") and repeatedly hit Noe over the head with it. After Noe collapsed, the burglar was even [...] "considerate enough to provide a pillow for the bleeding, mangled head," [...] using rags found on the floor, the Times wrote. The burglar then bound and gagged Noe, and robbed him of several items, including a watch and chain. Noe survived several days before dying. Of damage to the eyes, a post-mortem report mentions [...] "a lacerated wound" [...] on the upper lid of the left eye and a [...] "fissure of the frontal bone." [...] Official cause of death was meningitis caused by the injuries.|$|R
5000|$|In {{the course}} of his {{remaining}} in town, Jonas continues hunting for the men who branded him. He takes [...] "Johnsey-Boy" [...] Hood on his way back from romancing the lonely wife of a local farmer (Gloria Grahame) in hopes of cheating her out of some money. Under the threat of being [...] "branded and gelded" [...] by Jonas, Hood's sanity cracks. He <b>grabs</b> the hot <b>iron</b> and rams it repeatedly into his stomach as he runs screaming into the woods. He later commits suicide.|$|R
50|$|Baldwin and Cynthia are {{the only}} ones left alive, with Yorga supernaturally mocking Baldwin {{throughout}} the estate. However, Yorga seals their exit routes while his brides slowly close in on the two. They duck into a darken hallway, but when Baldwin turns on the lights, he finds himself confronted by all the brides (including Ellen and Mitzi) with Yorga behind them who calls Cynthia over to his side. Yorga takes her away preparing to transform her into a new bride, while leaving his army of brides to finish off Baldwin. Baldwin somehow escapes the brides and gives pursuit (along the way, <b>grabbing</b> an <b>iron</b> battle-axe from a wall), chasing the two up to the balcony. The two men fight, with Yorga gaining the advantage. Just as he's about to kill Baldwin via choking. Cynthia's memories of the brides killing her family resurfaces causing her to realize Yorga was responsible for their deaths. She strikes Yorga in the chest with Baldwin's battle-axe. With Yorga stunned by the action, Baldwin uses the moment to throw Yorga off the balcony, killing him.|$|R
50|$|The sheriff {{returns to}} the police station where Amanda and Claire {{approach}} him. Soon, lights all around begin to flicker. Inside the local pub, Max, bartender Tony (Chris Gauthier), and Harry see this too along with Earl in his car which suddenly died. Out the window, Tony sees Amanda, Claire and the sheriff, along with Iron coming their way. Claire turns and runs while Iron chases her. Claire falls and gets a bloody forehead. Right before <b>Iron</b> <b>grabs</b> her, Max appears and helps her escape. Jake returns in his car and sees Iron. Jake attempts to ram Iron until his car dies as well, but he managed to break off Iron's leg, causing it to fall apart. The infected pieces are still alive however, and one them grabs the sheriff and kills him. Jake gets Amanda and they and Earl hide in the pub with Tony and Harry.|$|R
50|$|The West Coast Avengers {{arrives at}} Tony's home, where {{they try to}} make Tony explain himself. Tony tells them he found out about the armor being stolen after {{analyzing}} Force's armor. The West Coast Avengers remained hesitant to tell Tony he's off the team after he leaves. The Crimson Dynamo and Titanium Man meets with the president, who tells them to defend the people of Russia after revealing that Iron Man is going to Russia, but Titanium Man disagrees, saying that Iron Man is too dangerous for anybody to handle, preferring to remain in hiding. Tony invents {{a modified version of the}} Stealth armor to sneak into Russia undetected. Iron Man goes after Titanium Man, but he fought back. While Iron Man was distracted by the Crimson Dynamo, the Titanium Man's pilot dons the armor and leads a double assault on Iron Man. Iron Man defeats the Crimson Dynamo and negates his armor. Distracted, Iron Man is attacked and overwhelmed by Titanium Man. Iron Man tries to escape, but Titanium Man <b>grabs</b> him. <b>Iron</b> Man flies up to space to try to shake Titanium Man off of him. However, Titanium Man's armor overheated, setting him on fire. The Titanium Man armor explodes, killing the pilot. Enraged, the Russian soldiers try to attack Iron Man, but he escapes. Back at the West Coast Avengers Mansion, Hawkeye states that Iron Man is stripped of his membership as a West Coast Avenger.|$|R
50|$|The mobile drops {{what appears}} {{at first to}} be a large lump of dough which emerges from behind the boy as a creepy clown-like {{gingerbread}} man named Dan Dan. Dan Dan insists that Hansel eat him and begins driving Hansel crazy with his incessant screaming on the matter. Finally, Hansel takes Dan Dan's head, the one part he refused to eat, and throws him into the wall, shattering Dan Dan to pieces. The witch, by this point, had taken Gretel down to the kitchen to begin heating the oven to cook Hansel. The witch pulls a chain hanging from her ceiling which causes two long arms to drop from the mobile above Hansel and bring him back up to the kitchen so she could begin baking him. Before the witch can shove Hansel into her oven, however, Gretel <b>grabs</b> the fire <b>iron</b> beside the oven and hits the witch in the back with it. Enraged, the witch fights the children in a kung fu-style battle.|$|R
40|$|Dentists, comedian Bill Cosby memorably mused, {{tell you}} not to pick your teeth with any sharp metal object. Then you sit in their chair, and the first thing they <b>grab</b> is an <b>iron</b> hook!" Conventional {{periodontal}} probing is indeed invasive, uncomfortable for the patient, and the results can vary greatly between dentists and even for repeated measurements by the same dentist. It is a necessary procedure, though, as periodontal disease is the most common dental disease, involving the loss of teeth by the gradual destruction of ligaments that hold teeth in their sockets in the jawbone. The disease usually results from an increased concentration of bacteria in the pocket, or sulcus, between the gums and teeth. These bacteria produce acids and other byproducts, which enlarge the sulcus by eroding the gums and the periodontal ligaments. The sulcus normally has a depth of 1 to 2 millimeters, but in patients with early stages of periodontal disease, it has a depth of 3 to 5 millimeters. By measuring the depth of the sulcus, periodontists can have a good assessment of the disease s progress. Presently, there are no reliable clinical indicators of periodontal disease activity, and the best available diagnostic aid, periodontal probing, can only measure what has already been lost. A method for detecting small increments of periodontal ligament breakdown would permit earlier diagnosis and intervention with less costly and time-consuming therapy, while overcoming the problems associated with conventional probing. The painful, conventional method for probing may be destined for the archives of dental history, thanks to the development of ultrasound probing technologies. The roots of ultrasound probes are in an ultrasound-based time-of-flight technique routinely used to measure material thickness and length in the Nondestructive Evaluation Sciences Laboratory at Langley Research Center. The primary applications of that technology have been for corrosion detection and bolt tension measurements (Spinoff 2005). This ultrasound measurement system was adapted to the Periodontal Structures Mapping System, invented at Langley by John A. Companion, under the supervision of Dr. Joseph S. Heyman. Support of the research and development that led to this invention was provided by NASA s Technology Applications Engineering Program and by the Naval Institute for Dental and Biomedical Research, in Great Lakes, Illinois...|$|R
