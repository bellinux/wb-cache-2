Predicting the component geometry using finite element analysis is computationally expensive and time consuming.

40|$|Abstract—Modern {{scientific}} {{databases and}} web databases maintain large and heterogeneous data. These real-world databases contain hundreds or {{even thousands of}} relations and attributes. Traditional predefined query forms {{are not able to}} satisfy various ad-hoc queries from users on those databases. This paper proposes DQF, a novel database query form interface, which is able to dynamically generate query forms. The essence of DQF is to capture a user’s preference and rank query <b>form</b> <b>components,</b> assisting him/her in making decisions. The generation of a query form is an iterative process and is guided by the user. At each iteration, the system automatically generates ranking lists of <b>form</b> <b>components</b> and the user then adds the desired <b>form</b> <b>components</b> into the query form. The ranking of <b>form</b> <b>components</b> is based on the captured user preference. A user can also fill the query form and submit queries to view the query result at each iteration. In this way, a query form could be dynamically refined until the user is satisfied with the query results. We utilize the expected F-measure for measuring the goodness of a query form. A probabilistic model is developed for estimating the goodness of a query form in DQF. Our experimental evaluation and user study demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the system.

50|$|A {{circular}} sheet (blank) of 118 mm diameter was {{cut from}} the alloy sheet and the cut surfaces polished to remove burrs. The blank {{was placed on the}} die and the top chamber brought in contact. The furnace was switched on to the set temperature. Once the set temperature was reached the top chamber was brought down further to effect the required blank holder pressure. About 10 minutes were allowed for thermal equilibration. The argon gas cylinder was opened to the set pressure gradually. Simultaneously, the linear variable differential transformer (LVDT), fitted {{at the bottom of the}} die, was set for recording the sheet bulge. Once the LVDT reached 45 mm (radius of bottom die), gas pressure was stopped and the furnace switched off. The <b>formed</b> <b>components</b> were taken out when the temperature of the die set had dropped to 600 °C. Easy removal of the component was possible at this stage. Superplastic bulge forming of hemispheres were carried out at temperatures of 1098, 1123, 1148, 1173, 1198 and 1223 K (825, 850, 875, 900, 925 and 950 °C) at forming pressures of 0.2, 0.4, 0.6 and 0.87 MPa. As the bulge forming process progresses, significant thinning in the sheet material becomes obvious. An ultrasonic technique was used to measure the thickness distribution on the profile of the formed component. The components were analyzed in terms of the thickness distribution, thickness strain and thinning factor. Post deformation micro-structural studies were conducted on the <b>formed</b> <b>components</b> in order to analyze the microstructure in terms of grain growth, grain elongation, cavitations, etc.|$|E

Mechanical forming, in particular, employs the use of a punch, which is pressed against the sheet material to be deformed into a die by the application of an external force. This study reports on the finite element analysis of the effects of punch stroke on the resulting sheet deformation, which is directly a function of the structural integrity of the <b>formed</b> <b>components</b> for possible application in the automotive industry. The results show that punch stroke is directly proportional to the resulting bend angle of the <b>formed</b> <b>components.</b> It was further revealed that the developed plastic strain increases as the punch stroke increases...|$|E

Samples {{of the steel}} sheets were mechanically bent to 120 mm curvatures using a 20 ton capacity eccentric mechanical press at room temperature and also with the laser beam using a 4. 4 kW Nd: YAG laser system at a scan speed of 1. 9 m/min, beam diameter of 12 mm, laser power of 1. 7 kW at 25 % beam overlap using argon for cooling the irradiated surfaces.

The tensile tests conducted revealed 46 % elongation while the yield strength of the laser <b>formed</b> <b>components</b> were enhanced with about 18 %. Furthermore, elongated grain structures were observed in the micrographs of the three components formed at the maximum parameter setting.

The measured grain sizes further showed that the components formed at the optimized maximum process parameter window were characterized by smaller grain structures with about 60 % of the grain sizes of the parent material. A progressive increase in the micro Vickers hardness of about 40 % was also observed in the three laser <b>formed</b> <b>components</b> in comparison to the parent material.
