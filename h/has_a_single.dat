5|$|Both written {{history and}} {{molecular}} genetic {{studies indicate that}} the domestic carrot <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>single</b> origin in Central Asia. Its wild ancestors probably originated in Persia (regions of which are now Iran and Afghanistan), which remains the centre of diversity for the wild carrot Daucus carota. A naturally occurring subspecies of the wild carrot was presumably bred selectively over the centuries to reduce bitterness, increase sweetness and minimise the woody core; this process produced the familiar garden vegetable.|$|E
5|$|Endpoints {{are grouped}} into {{interfaces}} and each interface {{is associated with}} a single device function. An exception to this is endpoint zero, which is used for device configuration and is not associated with any interface. A single device function composed of independently controlled interfaces is called a composite device. A composite device only <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>single</b> device address because the host only assigns a device address to a function.|$|E
5000|$|There is <b>a</b> {{correlation}} between <b>having</b> <b>a</b> <b>single</b> yolk sac and <b>having</b> <b>a</b> <b>single</b> amniotic sac. However, {{it is difficult}} to detect the number of yolk sacs, because the yolk sac disappears during embryogenesis.|$|R

5|$|Another {{analysis}} {{found that}} 17 percent of eligibles may <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>single</b> insurer option in 2017. North Carolina, Oklahoma, Alaska, Alabama, South Carolina and Wyoming {{were expected to}} <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>single</b> insurer, while only 2 percent of 2016 eligibles had only one choice.|$|R
5|$|In the Catholic Church, {{display of}} a cross behind the shield is {{restricted}} to bishops as a mark of their dignity. The cross of an ordinary bishop <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>single</b> horizontal bar or traverse, {{also known as a}} Latin cross. A patriarch uses the patriarchal cross with two traverses, also called the cross of Lorraine. The papal cross has three traverses, but this is never displayed behind the papal arms.|$|E
5|$|Like the FIFA World Cup, {{nowadays}} the Copa Libertadores {{is sponsored}} {{by a group of}} multinational corporations. However, unlike the World Cup, the competition <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>single,</b> main sponsor for naming rights; it is currently primarily sponsored by Bridgestone Corporation. This sponsorship deal for naming rights is for a period of 5 years and began with the 2012 edition. Thus, the competition is known officially as the '"Copa Bridgestone Libertadores'".|$|E
5|$|Rainier Beach station {{consists}} of a single, at-grade island platform in the median of Martin Luther King Jr. Way South {{on the south side}} of South Henderson Street. The station <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>single</b> entrance at Henderson, accessible via two crosswalks. A small plaza on the northeast corner of the intersection has seating, 20 bicycle lockers, a bus stop, and public art. Rainier Beach station, like others in the Rainier Valley, was designed by architecture firm Arai/Jackson.|$|E

5|$|The Box Tree is a {{restaurant}} located in Ilkley, West Yorkshire, England. It has been operated by chef Simon Gueller and his wife, Rena, since 2005. Under their management the restaurant has been redecorated, although elements {{from the original}} owners of the restaurant remain. Reception by food critics has improved over the years; the restaurant <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>single</b> Michelin star and three AA rosettes. A sister company is also run by the chef, called Box Tree Events.|$|E
5|$|The RAAF <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>single</b> {{operational}} command, Air Command. Air Command is {{the operational}} {{arm of the}} RAAF and consists of Air Combat Group, Air Mobility Group, Surveillance and Response Group, Combat Support Group, Air Warfare Centre and Air Force Training Group. Each group consists of several wings.|$|E
5|$|The irises of {{its eyes}} are red, its feet are black, and its beak is flesh-colored. The eye <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>single</b> {{incomplete}} row of eyelashes {{on the upper}} lid and two rows on the lower lid. Its beak is thick, rounded, and hooked at the tip. Because of its habit of urohidrosis, the scaly portions of its legs are often streaked white with uric acid.|$|E

5000|$|The league office {{might require}} that each team <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>single</b> uniform for all games or {{requires}} that each team <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>single,</b> white home uniform and <b>a</b> <b>single,</b> non-white away uniform. With {{the elimination of}} the separate American League and National League administrations, this rule is most often seen in use in the minor leagues.|$|R

5|$|The station <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>single</b> large concourse, {{separate}} from the train shed. Originally, there were no seats installed there to deter vagrants and crime, but these were added following complaints from passengers. A few remnants of the older station remain: two Portland stone entrance lodges and a war memorial. A statue of Robert Stephenson by Carlo Marochetti, previously in the old ticket hall, stands in the forecourt.|$|E
5|$|This {{research}} has shown that there was a single origin of ectomycorrhizal symbiosis in the Amanita genus. DNA analysis has shown that a group of species in the subsection Vittadiniae (which includes S.thiersii) has few derived characteristics. This clade <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>single</b> ancestor (or a very small number) and seems to have come into being at a very early stage {{in the evolution of the}} genus.|$|E
5|$|Unlike its predecessor, Mysteries of the Sith <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>single,</b> morally {{positive}} course, as {{the player}} progresses through {{the game in}} a linear fashion. The game includes most of the enemies featured in Dark Forces II, plus some new monsters. The player has access to Force powers and projectile weapons such as a blaster or railgun, {{as well as a}} lightsaber.|$|E

5|$|Additionally, {{there can}} be {{confusion}} between the various water hemlock species and poison hemlock (Conium maculatum) as the common name hemlock is applied to both Cicuta and Conium maculatum. Both are poisonous and can be differentiated by differences in their root structure. Water hemlock has a branched root systems with tubules, while poison hemlock <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>single</b> tap root. Another reliable method to identify water hemlock {{is to examine the}} leaf veins. Water Hemlock is unique in the Apiaceae family in that it has leaf veins which terminate in the notches between the leaf tips, rather than extend to the tip of the leaf, as is found in the leaf structure of other members of this family.|$|E
5|$|Constructed in 1878, the Fosterâ€“Payne House is {{a two-story}} {{home with a}} {{low-pitched}} multi-gabled roof. The house <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>single</b> story open porch on the western side, a kitchen ell that projects from the rear and a single-story bay window that projects from the western bay of the front facade. The house is distinguished by its clapboard exterior and wooden trim under the gable peaks, the window trim and the porch brackets. There are three types of windows used on the house, single and paired one-over-one windows and two-over-two windows.|$|E
5|$|Described {{as being}} similar {{to members of}} the genera Pareledone, Eledone, and Enteroctopus, V. togata has a large body with large eyes and {{extensive}} membranes that link the octopus' arms together. The species <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>single</b> line of suckers on each arm, and its head, mantle, and part of its arms are covered in warts. Although the reproductive habits of V. togata have not been extensively studied, the species is believed {{to be one of the}} most fecund among octopuses in its region and depth level, despite the species possessing large eggs and extremely large spermatophores.|$|E

5|$|Each {{level has}} the player follow a linear path through waves of enemies and culminates with a boss. In boss stages the player's craft {{does not move}} forward, but hovers {{in front of the}} boss. Each boss <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>single</b> {{vulnerability}} which flashes when hit. These areas are often heavily shielded and must be hit repeatedly to remove armor. Other bosses' vulnerabilities are hidden and appear for only short periods. Most bosses have weapons that fire upon the player or reflect the player's shots. At the end of each level, players receive bonuses for defeated enemies, lives remaining, and the energy level of the player's craft. An extra life is granted if the score reaches certain thresholds.|$|E
5|$|Eriophorum angustifolium {{differs from}} other species within the genus Eriophorum in its habitat and morphology. Its {{multiple}} flower heads and growth from rhizomes {{distinguish it from}} E.vaginatum, which <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>single</b> flower head and grows from dense tussocks. Although E.latifolium has 2â€“12 flower heads, it has laxly caespitose (tufted) growth, and its pappi are forked. The smooth peduncles and preference for acidic soil pH distinguishes E.angustifolium from E.gracile, which grows in swamp with a neutral pH and has scabrid (rough) peduncles.|$|E
5|$|In many species, fleas are principally a {{nuisance}} to their hosts, causing an itching sensation {{which in turn}} causes the host to try to remove the pest by biting, pecking or scratching. Fleas are not simply a source of annoyance, however. Flea bites cause a slightly raised, swollen itching spot to form; this <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>single</b> puncture point at the centre, like a mosquito bite. Besides this, the eczematous itchy skin disease flea allergy dermatitis is common in many host species, including dogs and cats. The bites often appear in clusters or lines of two bites, and can remain itchy and inflamed for up to several weeks afterwards. Fleas can lead to hair loss {{as a result of}} frequent scratching and biting by the animal, and can cause anemia in extreme cases.|$|E
