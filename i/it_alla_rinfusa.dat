50|$|Bundesliga-hår ("Bundesliga hair") is the Danish {{word for}} a mullet, because this type of haircut (as well as in Hungary) was {{regarded}} a characteristic of football Bundesliga players. Also the Italians saw this kind of connection and dubbed <b>it</b> capelli <b>alla</b> tedesca (German style haircut).|$|R

5000|$|Dalhousie {{has many}} places to visit. A {{favorite}} spot for tourists {{is the area}} near <b>Alla.</b> <b>It</b> is a potato field and it offers mesmerizing scenic landscape. Another popular spot is the area of Karelanu. It {{is famous for its}} precious water, which healed Subhas Chandra Bose. He was suffering from tuberculosis and he regularly drank the water from the natural spring in Karelanu and was healed. Some of the major tourist attractions of the town are: ...|$|R
40|$|Conducting {{monetary}} policy [...] . isakin to driving without full vision—perhaps like driving in a rainstorm with defective windshield wipers. It can be done, but only very carefully. (John Crow, Eric J. Hanson Memorial Lecture, 1988) The Fed’s dilemma {{is like that}} of a tugboat captain pushing a long string of barges in a dense fog; the awkward load is difficult to pilot. He needs to start his turn half a mile before the bend. But he can’t see the bend until <b>it’s</b> too late. (<b>Alla...</b>|$|R
5000|$|The {{piece in}} A minor is scored for eight voices in two choirs SATB. <b>It</b> is in <b>alla</b> breve time and marked [...] "Ziemlich langsam" [...] (rather slowly). Reger repeats {{the first two}} lines of the text, with {{modified}} music the second time, arriving at a structure of A - A' - B. The B section is set in contrast in A major, marked [...] "Etwas bewegter" [...] (A bit more moving). Within this line, only one word is repeated and intensified: [...] "seinen", ending on [...] "his, his hands".|$|R
5000|$|He {{was also}} known for his buitenplaats Zandbergen on the Amersfoortseweg that was built by Jacob van Campen. His {{portrait}} by Hals hung there for centuries, though {{it was in the}} possession of National Gallery in Prague by 1890.This portrait is admirable for the loose brushwork used to depict the gold brocade of his jacket. Research has revealed that <b>it</b> was painted <b>alla</b> prima or wet-in-wet. Measuring only 31.5 × 26.6 inches, this portrait could have easily been completed while Schade was on a day trip to Haarlem, taking it with him, still wet. The painting was documented by Cornelis Hofstede de Groot in 1910 who wrote: ...|$|R
50|$|In Denmark and Norway, {{although}} February 14 {{is known}} as Valentinsdag, it is not celebrated to a large extent, but is largely imported from American culture, and some people take time to eat a romantic dinner with their partner, to send a card to a secret love or give a red rose to their loved one. The cut-flower industry in particular is still working on promoting the holiday. In Sweden <b>it</b> is called <b>Alla</b> hjärtans dag ("All Hearts' Day") and was launched in the 1960s by the flower industry's commercial interests, and due {{to the influence of}} American culture. It is not an official holiday, but its celebration is recognized and sales of cosmetics and flowers for this holiday are only exceeded by those for Mother's Day.|$|R
25|$|Theorbos were {{developed}} during the late sixteenth century in Italy, inspired by the demand for extended bass range instruments for use in opera developed by the Florentine Camerata and new musical works utilising basso continuo, such as Giulio Caccini's two collections, Le nuove musiche (1602 and 1614). For his 1607 opera L'Orfeo, Claudio Monteverdi lists duoi (two) chitaroni among the instruments required for performing the work. Musicians originally used large bass lutes (c. 80+ cm string length) and a higher re-entrant tuning; but soon created neck extensions with secondary pegboxes to accommodate extra open (i.e. unfretted) longer bass strings, called diapasons or bourdons, for improvements in tonal clarity and an increased range of available notes. Although the words chitarrone and tiorba were both {{used to describe the}} instrument, they have different organological and etymological origins; chitarrone being in Italian an augmentation of (and literally meaning large) chitarra – Italian for guitar. The round-backed chitarra was still in use, often referred to as chitarra Italiana to distinguish <b>it</b> from chitarra <b>alla</b> spagnola in its new flat-backed Spanish incarnation. The etymology of tiorba is still obscure; it is hypothesized the origin may be in Slavic or Turkish torba, meaning 'bag' or 'turban'.|$|R
