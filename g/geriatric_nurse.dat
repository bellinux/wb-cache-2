Favorable changes were seen in two out of eight activity of daily living (ADL) measures: five of 18 nursing therapies; two of six drug therapies; six of eight tracers. There was some reduction in hospital admissions and total days in geriatric NP homes. Overall measures of medical attention showed a mixed pattern with some evidence of geriatric NP care substituted for physician care.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{investigation}} was to develop an instrument to test the theory of reasoned action (Fishbein 2 ̆ 6 Ajzen, 1975) in a new behavioral domain the health promotive behaviors of <b>geriatric</b> <b>nurse</b> practitioners (GNPs). The two behavioral categories included in the study were health assessment and health teaching, each with its individual index of actions. A questionnaire was developed to examine the beliefs of a sample of 200 certified <b>geriatric</b> <b>nurse</b> practitioners and to test the relationships of the theoretical model. Names of the subjects were randomly selected from the American Nurses 2 ̆ 7 Association 1989 list of certified GNPs. Ninety-four returned questionnaires were included in the data analyses. Data analysis included frequency of demographic attributes, correlation, stepwise multiple regression, and factor analysis. Estimation of validity and reliability of the instrument were sufficient to warrant reuse of the instrument. As a homogeneous group, the <b>geriatric</b> <b>nurse</b> practitioners shared strong personal and social beliefs about carrying out health promotive behaviors with older clients. They perceived that important others in the organization think the GNP should carry out health assessment and health teaching with clients. The theory was partially supported in the investigation. Intention was a determinant of behavior in both categories. Attitude was a more significant predictor of intent to carry out behavior than were the perceived social pressures. Motivation to comply with important others was not a determinant of the subjective norm. Results from this study hold implications for both nurse educators, clinicians and health care administrators. In a period when reimbursement for nurse practitioners and cost containment have become realities in the health care system, a GNP who carries out health promotive behaviors with the ever increasing number of elderly clients will be a desirable asset in any health care system...|$|E

40|$|Having {{established}} an academic and clinical infrastructure, geriatric nursing is {{well positioned to}} {{play a central role}} in improving the health of the nation’s older adults now and in the future. Currently, whether working inde-pendently, in collaborative practice with physicians, or as members of geriatric teams, <b>geriatric</b> <b>nurse</b> practition-ers and clinical specialists have been shown to improve care to older adults in the community, in hospitals, and in skilled nursing facilities. Sixty-three master’s programs now prepare advanced practice geriatric nurses.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to examine changes in self-perceived {{competency}} of Gerontological Certified Nurses in skilled nursing facilities over time after initial certification. The sample used for this study was comprised of registered nurses who participated in the Midwest Geriatric Nursing Quality Improvement project between 2009 and 2011. Data was collected using the Hartford <b>Geriatric</b> <b>Nurse</b> Competencies Tool and a set of qualitative interview questions. The Everyday Excellence Framework was chosen as the foundation for professional practice and to support the Hartford <b>Geriatric</b> <b>Nurse</b> Competencies Tool. Analysis of the data found that there were no significant changes in the self-perceived competency when the current scores were compared with those from the original study. Growth in competency over time was found to be moderate and current self-perceived competency among the nurses was reported to be above average or highly competent. Interviews were conducted using open-ended questions to obtain information on factors that affect change in competency. Nurses who reported higher rates of growth in competency also reported participating in more educational activities and had encountered fewer barriers since becoming certified. In the future, more research in the development interventions to support continued growth in competency and minimize barriers is needed. In addition the implementation of the Everyday Excellence framework and address ways to support ability of the nurse to continue to gain competency in practice. ...|$|E
40|$|A {{number of}} aspects will be {{discussed}} with regard to frailty in hospitalised elderly patients and {{the role played by}} nurses. With regard to frailty, several definitions and operationalisations are used that may have an influence when frailty is used for case-finding. Frailty is related to disability and comorbidity and may occur more or less often in specific groups of patients. It is not clear whether information obtained from significant others is useful for assessing a patient's frailty and determining whether nurses of non-geriatric wards have sufficient experience to determine the specific problems of frail elderly people. Geriatric interventions have shown positive results with regard to frail elderly people. It can be studied whether an intervention with a central role for the <b>Geriatric</b> <b>Nurse</b> Specialist will also have a positive effect in frail elderly people and whether the RE-AIM model is useful in evaluating the intervention study undertaken. ...|$|E

40|$|Increasing {{numbers of}} health {{maintenance}} organizations (HMOs) are contracting {{with the federal government}} to permit enrollment of Medicare beneficiaries, and increasing numbers of the elderly are joining HMOs. A review of past HMO performance suggests that, although these organizations will try to effect a decrease in the rate and duration of hospitalization to control costs, a high rate of functional disability and acute illness in elderly patients will make it impossible to accomplish this significantly. Also, although HMOs will attempt to provide more comprehensive coverage, the demand for prescription drugs, eyeglasses, and medical devices will make such coverage very expensive. Attempts to ration the services of primary-care physicians will impede case management and continuity of care. If HMOs are to provide high-quality medical care at a reasonable cost, they will need to consider making use of geriatric assessment units, geriatric consultants, <b>geriatric</b> <b>nurse</b> practitioners, and special geriatric hospital wards.

40|$|A Clinical Paper Submitted in Partial Fulfillment of the Requirements for the Degree of Master of Science in Nursing [...] University of Wisconsin-Oshkosh, 2008 Primary care {{providers}} treating patients in clinic settings {{are increasingly being}} called upon to treat depressed patients.

40|$|OBJECTIVES—To {{assess the}} role of {{potential}} (occupational) risk factors for fragrance contact allergy (FCA). Most studies assessing the range of contact sensitisation in various clinical populations found the fragrance mix, a good screening tool {{for the detection of}} FCA in general, {{to be one of the}} leading allergens. The role of occupational exposure to fragrances is, however, yet unclear.  METHODS—Firstly, crude analyses of the prevalence of FCA in various occupational fields including all 57   779 patients patch tested in the participating centres of the Information Network of Departments of Dermatology (IVDK) between January 1992  and December 1998.  Secondly, a multifactorial Poisson regression analysis of these patients, including several potential risk factors.  RESULTS—(a) The proportion of patients with FCA varied greatly between different occupational groups from 2. 5 % to 17. 4 %, (b) the highest occupational risk of FCA was associated with work as a masseur or physiotherapist, metal furnace operator, potter or glass maker etc, or <b>geriatric</b> <b>nurse,</b> (c) non-occupational factors that influenced risk of FCA included atopy, female sex, several sites, in particular the axillae, and increasing age.  CONCLUSIONS—Occupations with a high risk of FCA were identified as targets of preventive action—that is, the substitution of scented products with fragrance free materials with which to work (skin disinfectants, cleaning solutions, personal care products) wherever possible.    Keywords: contact allergy; occupational risk factors; fragrance...|$|E
