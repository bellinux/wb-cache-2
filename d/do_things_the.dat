He worked hard and played hard and wasn't afraid to push the boundaries." [...] The character has often {{been referred to as}} a [...] "", with editorials also mentioning his [...] "heavy-drinking" [...] tendencies. Edmondson has described his alter-ego as [...] "a great character - he's a maverick and can <b>do</b> <b>things</b> <b>the</b> others {{would not be able to}} get away with.", while the Daily Mirror have discussed the personality trait whereby [...] "Abra finds it hard to conform to bureaucracy and is a risk taker. He is not afraid to fight for what he believes in - which, inevitably, lands him in all sorts of trouble." ...|$|E
500|$|In several {{instances}} in Torchwood, Jack displays {{no qualms about}} killing a person of any species, which within Doctor Who, allows Jack's character to act in ways the lead character cannot. Barrowman remarks, [...] "He'll <b>do</b> <b>things</b> <b>the</b> Doctor won't do ... fight. Jack will kill. And the Doctor, in a way, knows that, so he lets Jack do it. I'd say Jack's the companion-hero." [...] A flashback in the third series of Torchwood shows Captain Jack sacrificing twelve children to aliens {{in order to save}} millions of lives. Davies feels that the third series of Torchwood is a [...] "tale of retribution and perhaps redemption" [...] for Captain Jack, who experiences [...] "maximum damage" [...] when his lover Ianto is killed. Davies chose to have Ianto die so that Jack would be damaged enough to sacrifice his grandson in order to destroy the same aliens.|$|E
500|$|Actor and comedian Adrian Edmondson guest-starred in {{the episode}} as surgeon Abra Durant, {{having been a}} fan of the show since its 1999 conception. His {{character}} proved so popular that Edmondson reprised the role twice in 2005, and signed a six-month contract in 2006, with series producer Emma Turner commenting that: [...] "He made a huge impact in the few episodes that he was involved in." [...] Edmondson returned to the series again in 2007, then 2008, making his final appearance in December 2008, when Abra returned to Ghana with Holby General nurse Kyla Tyson (Rakie Ayola). Edmondson ultimately departed from the series to pursue a full-time music career as part of the folk band The Bad Shepherds. He deemed the role of Abra a [...] "dream", calling him a [...] "great character", and characterising him as [...] "a maverick [...] can <b>do</b> <b>things</b> <b>the</b> others {{would not be able to}} get away with." ...|$|E

5000|$|The {{expression}} cart {{before the}} horse is an idiom or proverb used to suggest something is done contrary to a conventional or culturally expected order or relationship. [...] A cart is a vehicle which is ordinarily pulled by a horse, so to put the cart before {{the horse is}} an analogy for <b>doing</b> <b>things</b> in <b>the</b> wrong order. [...] The figure of speech means <b>doing</b> <b>things</b> <b>the</b> wrong way round or with the wrong emphasis. The idiom is about confusing cause and effect.|$|R
500|$|The Romanian writer {{also spent}} the Dada period issuing {{a long series}} of manifestos, which were often {{authored}} as prose poetry, and, according to Cardinal, were characterized by [...] "rumbustious tomfoolery and astringent wit", which reflected [...] "the language of a sophisticated savage". Huelsenbeck credited Tzara with having discovered in them the format for [...] "compress what we think and feel", and, according to Hans Richter, the genre [...] "suited Tzara perfectly." [...] Despite its production of seemingly theoretical works, Richter indicates, Dada lacked any form of program, and Tzara tried to perpetuate this state of affairs. His Dada manifesto of 1918 stated: [...] "Dada means nothing", adding [...] "Thought is produced in the mouth." [...] Tzara indicated: [...] "I am against systems; the most acceptable system is on principle to have none." [...] In addition, Tzara, who once stated that [...] "logic is always false", probably approved of Serner's vision of a [...] "final dissolution". According to Philip Beitchman, a core concept in Tzara's thought was that [...] "as long as we <b>do</b> <b>things</b> <b>the</b> way we think we once did them we will be unable to achieve any kind of livable society." ...|$|E

Supporters refer to inconsistent results and unexpected events as [...] "Typical City", or [...] "City-itis" [...] and media often refer to City as a [...] "soap opera" [...] club. Historical events and results labelled as [...] "Typical City" [...] include being the only team to score and concede 100 league goals in one season (1957-58) and the only reigning champions in English football to be relegated.

2500|$|The {{album is}} named after track four, [...] "Talk a Good Game" [...] which {{features}} Kevin Cossom. Over a [...] "snaky but sweet" [...] production from T-Minus Rowland sings [...] "I don’t think I can take another broken promise / Why <b>do</b> <b>things</b> <b>the</b> hard way when you can just be honest". Hampp said that Cossom's rap gave the song a [...] "street edge". It takes the listener on an emotional journey according to The Honesty Hour. The next song, [...] "Down on Love", is a midtempo production featuring another classic sample, this time the 1987 song [...] "Rock Steady" [...] by American R group The Whispers. Using her mezzo-soprano vocals, Rowland takes on a downtrodden romantic situation, [...] "We want two different things at two different times / You know how the story go / Easy come easy go". [...] "Dirty Laundry" [...] was co-written by Rowland, Carlos McKinney and The Dream, and is R [...] "confessional" [...] ballad, containing [...] "R jam spools" [...] and a piano-led melody. It details a [...] "frank and often poignant commentary" [...] on Rowland's life. The song is a [...] "brutal" [...] chronicle of {{the last ten years}} of Rowland's life, covering her envy of Beyoncé's solo success and the end of an abusive relationship. Amongst the lyrics, Rowland sings [...] "Kinda lucky I was in her shadow / Phone call from my sister what’s the matter / She said, 'Oh no / You gotta leave' / I’m on the kitchen floor / He took the keys." ...|$|E

Right there I told him that my father had been a famous squirrel hunter in his day. He had such remarkable eyesight that he could espy the ear of a squirrel projecting above the highest limb of a tall white oak. And he was such a splendid shot that he had often [...] "barked" [...] squirrels, as was a noted practice of the old pioneer. I had to explain to Takahashi that this practice consisted of shooting a bullet to hit the bark right under the squirrel, and the concussion would so stun it that it would fall as if dead.|$|E
6000|$|This was {{a fitting}} {{entrance}} for Shaw to his didactic drama; because the commonplace courage which he respects in Bluntschli {{was the one}} virtue which he was destined to praise throughout. We can best see how the play symbolises and summarises Bernard Shaw if we compare it with some other attack by modern humanitarians upon war. Shaw has many of the actual opinions of Tolstoy. Like Tolstoy he tells men, with coarse innocence, that romantic war is only butchery and that romantic love is only lust. But Tolstoy objects to these things because they are real; he really wishes to abolish them. Shaw only objects to them {{in so far as}} they are ideal; that is in so far as they are idealised. Shaw objects not so much to war as to the attractiveness of war. He does not so much dislike love as the love of love. Before the temple of Mars, Tolstoy stands and thunders, [...] "There shall be no wars"; Bernard Shaw merely murmurs, [...] "Wars if you must; but for God's sake, not war songs." [...] Before the temple of Venus, Tolstoy cries terribly, [...] "Come out of it!"; Shaw is quite content to say, [...] "Do not be taken in by it." [...] Tolstoy seems really to propose that high passion and patriotic valour should be destroyed. Shaw is more moderate; and only asks that they should be desecrated. Upon this note, both about sex and conflict, he was destined to dwell through much of his work with the most wonderful variations of witty adventure and intellectual surprise. It may be doubted perhaps whether this realism in love and war is quite so sensible as it looks. Securus judicat orbis terrarum; the world is wiser than the moderns. The world has kept sentimentalities simply because they are the most practical things in the world. They alone make men <b>do</b> <b>things.</b> <b>The</b> world does not encourage a quite rational lover, simply because a perfectly rational lover would never get married. The world does not encourage a perfectly rational army, because a perfectly rational army would run away.|$|E
