5|$|The primary biome of inland Massachusetts is {{temperate}} <b>deciduous</b> <b>forest.</b>|$|E
5|$|Germany: The {{species is}} known from two {{different}} areas in the country. In 2005 and 2006, specimens were caught in an old moist forest near the Rhine in western Baden-Württemberg. Two other bats were found in highway tunnels close to this site. The species is also known from the Kyffhäuser hill range of Thuringia in central Germany, an island of relatively warm habitat with some unusual wildlife. There, bats were caught near a spring in a karst landscape amid oak-dominated <b>deciduous</b> <b>forest.</b> The species was also recorded in <b>deciduous</b> <b>forest</b> at a former Soviet military training site in eastern Thuringia. M.alcathoe has also been recorded in the nearby states of Saxony-Anhalt and Saxony, where it occurs in mixed <b>deciduous</b> <b>forest.</b> Many Saxony-Anhalt records are from near water. However, the species was also recorded {{in the center of}} the city of Chemnitz in Saxony.|$|E
5|$|Dense moist <b>deciduous</b> <b>forest</b> mainly {{consists}} of sal, haldu, peepal, rohini and mango trees. Forest covers almost 73% of the park, 10% {{of the area}} {{consists of}} grasslands. It houses around 110 tree species, 50 species of mammals, 580 bird species and 25 reptile species.|$|E
50|$|In {{the west}} is the Kathiawar Peninsula and the strip of western Rajasthan between the Aravalli Range and Thar Desert. To the northwest, the Kathiawar-Gir dry <b>deciduous</b> <b>forests</b> transit to the Upper Gangetic Plains moist <b>deciduous</b> <b>forests.</b> To the {{southeast}} lies the Narmada Valley dry <b>deciduous</b> <b>forests,</b> of the Vindhya Range, and the Narmada River Valley. The ecoregion also borders the North Western Ghats moist <b>deciduous</b> <b>forests</b> in southeastern Gujarat.|$|R
50|$|Baisipalli {{is located}} in the Eastern Highlands moist <b>deciduous</b> <b>forests</b> ecoregion. The two major plant {{communities}} are mixed <b>deciduous</b> <b>forests</b> including Sal (Shorea robusta), and riverine forest.|$|R
50|$|It covers {{an area of}} 160 km². The {{terrain is}} hilly, and covered with mixed <b>deciduous</b> <b>forests.</b> It is in the Eastern Highlands moist <b>deciduous</b> <b>forests</b> ecoregion.|$|R
5|$|The Liliaceae {{probably}} arose as shade plants, {{with subsequent}} evolution to open areas including <b>deciduous</b> <b>forest</b> {{in the more}} open autumnal period. This {{was accompanied by a}} shift from rhizomes to bulbs, to more showy flowers, the production of capsular fruit and narrower parallel-veined leaves.|$|E
5|$|Fifty-seven {{percent of}} the Nescopeck Creek {{watershed}} is composed of <b>deciduous</b> <b>forest.</b> Areas of perennial herbaceous vegetation make up 11 to 12 {{percent of the}} creek's watershed. Additionally, there are scattered patches of mixed vegetation and annual herbaceous vegetation in the northwestern part of the Nescopeck Creek watershed. Four to seven percent of the Nescopeck Creek watershed consists of mines, quarries, and gravel pits.|$|E
5|$|For {{almost two}} decades after its discovery, Psilocybe tampanensis was known only from the type locality, {{southeast}} of Brandon, Florida. In 1996, Guzmán reported finding it in a meadow with sandy soil in a <b>deciduous</b> <b>forest</b> in Pearl River County, Mississippi, a habitat {{similar to that of}} the type location. Due to its scarcity, however, its habitat preferences are not known with certainty. Like all Psilocybe species, it is saprobic.|$|E
50|$|The drier Anatolian Plateau lies to the south, {{where the}} Northern Anatolian forests {{transition}} to the Eastern Anatolian <b>deciduous</b> <b>forests</b> to the southeast, the Central Anatolian <b>deciduous</b> <b>forests</b> to the south, and the Anatolian conifer and <b>deciduous</b> mixed <b>forests</b> to the southwest.|$|R
50|$|The tiger {{reserve is}} located in the Eastern Highlands moist <b>deciduous</b> <b>forests</b> ecoregion. The major plant {{communities}} are mixed <b>deciduous</b> <b>forests</b> including Sal (Shorea robusta), and riverine forest.|$|R
30|$|Transects. Data on {{woody plant}} species were {{collected}} from belt transects of 500 m × 10 m in the study areas. In the Sathyamanglam landscape, 16 transects were from the tropical dry <b>deciduous</b> <b>forests,</b> 10 from the tropical dry thorn forests, and 9 transects from the tropical moist <b>deciduous</b> <b>forests.</b> In the Nilgiri landscape, 17 transects were enumerated in the tropical dry <b>deciduous</b> <b>forests,</b> 10 transects from the tropical dry thorn forests, and 2 transects from the tropical moist <b>deciduous</b> <b>forests.</b> Methods were adapted from Cochrane and Schultz (1999).|$|R
5|$|Despite the {{proximity}} of the city centre, the Žirmūnai bank of the River Neris is covered with a strip of dense <b>deciduous</b> <b>forest</b> that begins at the Žirmūnai Bridge and continues upstream (northeasterly). The forested strip is largely uninterrupted, with gaps near bridges. At the approximate centrepoint of the Žirmūnai shoreline, the forest surrounds a backwater, which had been used to park disused passenger ferries. The forest's northernmost section is part of a botanical nature reserve within Verkiai Regional Park.|$|E
5|$|Biomes {{are larger}} units of {{organization}} that categorize {{regions of the}} Earth's ecosystems, mainly according to the structure and composition of vegetation. There are different methods to define the continental boundaries of biomes dominated by different functional types of vegetative communities that are limited in distribution by climate, precipitation, weather and other environmental variables. Biomes include tropical rainforest, temperate broadleaf and mixed forest, temperate <b>deciduous</b> <b>forest,</b> taiga, tundra, hot desert, and polar desert. Other researchers have recently categorized other biomes, such as the human and oceanic microbiomes. To a microbe, {{the human body is}} a habitat and a landscape. Microbiomes were discovered largely through advances in molecular genetics, which have revealed a hidden richness of microbial diversity on the planet. The oceanic microbiome plays {{a significant role in the}} ecological biogeochemistry of the planet's oceans.|$|E
5|$|Geastrum triplex is a {{saprobic}} fungus: it derives {{nutrients from}} decomposing organic matter. The fruit bodies are usually found growing singly or more commonly in groups in hardwood forests where much humus has accumulated; in Mexico, {{they have been}} collected in tropical <b>deciduous</b> <b>forest.</b> Fruit bodies are often found around well-rotted tree stumps; they are initially almost buried in the loose duff, but emerge during maturity as the downward curling of the rays exposes the spore sac. Old fruit bodies are persistent, and may survive the winter to be found the following spring or summer. A Dutch study reported a propensity for G.triplex to grow on soil made calcium-rich from washed-out chalk of crushed shells on bicycling paths. It is described as common in North America and Europe. One author states it is commonly found under beech trees.|$|E
50|$|It covers {{an area of}} 430 km², mostly small {{hills and}} valleys. It is in the Eastern Highlands moist <b>deciduous</b> <b>forests</b> ecoregion. The major plant {{communities}} are mixed <b>deciduous</b> <b>forests</b> and scrublands.|$|R
5|$|The Western Ghats {{are home}} to four {{tropical}} and subtropical moist broadleaf forest ecoregions – the North Western Ghats moist <b>deciduous</b> <b>forests,</b> North Western Ghats montane rain forests, South Western Ghats moist <b>deciduous</b> <b>forests,</b> and South Western Ghats montane rain forests. The northern portion of the range is generally drier than the southern portion, and at lower elevations makes up the North Western Ghats moist <b>deciduous</b> <b>forests</b> ecoregion, with mostly <b>deciduous</b> <b>forests</b> made up predominantly of teak. Above 1,000 meters elevation are the cooler and wetter North Western Ghats montane rain forests, whose evergreen forests are characterised by trees of family Lauraceae.|$|R
5000|$|It {{is located}} on the Chota Nagpur Plateau in northeastern Odisha. The primary plant {{community}} is mixed <b>deciduous</b> <b>forests,</b> including Sal (Shorea robusta). It is in the Eastern Highlands moist <b>deciduous</b> <b>forests</b> ecoregion.|$|R
5|$|Grand Teton National Park and the {{surrounding}} region host over 1,000 species of vascular plants. With an altitude variance of over , the park {{has a number of}} different ecological zones including alpine tundra, the Rocky Mountains subalpine zone where spruce-fir forests are dominant, and the valley floor, where a mixed conifer and <b>deciduous</b> <b>forest</b> zone occupies regions with better soils intermixed with sagebrush plains atop alluvial deposits. Additionally, wetlands near some lakes and in the valley floor adjacent to rivers and streams cover large expanses, especially along the Snake River near Oxbow Bend near Moran and Willow Flats near the Jackson Lake Lodge. Altitude, available soils, wildfire incidence, avalanches and human activities have a direct impact on the types of plant species in an immediate area. Where these various niches overlap is known as an ecotone.|$|E
5|$|In South Asia {{the golden}} jackal inhabits Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Nepal, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka. In Central Asia it inhabits Tadjikistan, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan. In Southeast Asia it inhabits Myanmar and Thailand. There {{have been two}} {{reported}} sightings from Cambodia, three from southern Laos, and two from Vietnameach sighting made only in lowland, open <b>deciduous</b> <b>forest,</b> and no specimens were presented. In Southwestern Asia it inhabits Iran, Iraq, Israel, Jordan, Kuwait, Lebanon, Oman, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Syria, Turkey, United Arab Emirates, and Yemen. In Europe it inhabits Albania, Armenia, Austria, Azerbaijan, the Baltic states, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Croatia, Georgia, Greece, Hungary, Italy, Kosovo, Macedonia, Moldova, Montenegro, Poland, Romania, the Russian Federation, Serbia, Slovakia, Slovenia, Switzerland, Turkey, and the Ukraine. It has been sighted in Belarus, the Czech Republic, and Germany. It {{has been reported in}} the media in Denmark and the Netherlands, but it is unclear if this jackal was an escapee from a private zoo.|$|E
5|$|The {{purposes}} of bonsai are primarily contemplation (for the viewer) and the pleasant exercise {{of effort and}} ingenuity (for the grower). Bonsai practice focuses on long-term cultivation and shaping {{of one or more}} small trees growing in a container, beginning with a cutting, seedling, or small tree of a species suitable for bonsai development. Bonsai can be created from nearly any perennial woody-stemmed tree or shrub species that produces true branches and can be cultivated to remain small through pot confinement with crown and root pruning. Some species are popular as bonsai material because they have characteristics, such as small leaves or needles, that make them appropriate for the compact visual scope of bonsai and a miniature <b>deciduous</b> <b>forest</b> can even be created using such species as Japanese maple, Japanese zelkova or hornbeam.|$|E
50|$|The {{ecoregion}} is bounded on {{the north}} by the Himalayan subtropical pine forests, Terai-Duar savannas and grasslands and Himalayan subtropical broadleaf forests of the Himalaya foothills, to the west by the drier Northwestern thorn scrub forests and Kathiarbar-Gir dry <b>deciduous</b> <b>forests,</b> on the south by the Narmada Valley dry <b>deciduous</b> <b>forests</b> of the Malwa and Bundelkhand uplands, and on the east by the more humid Lower Gangetic plains moist <b>deciduous</b> <b>forests.</b>|$|R
50|$|The refuge covers {{portions}} of the Lower Gangetic Plains moist <b>deciduous</b> <b>forests</b> and Chota Nagpur dry <b>deciduous</b> <b>forests</b> ecoregions. Plant communities include dry and moist sal (Shorea robusta) forests, ravine thorn forest, and tropical dry riverine forest.|$|R
50|$|The {{sanctuary}} covers {{an area of}} 255 km². It {{lies within}} the Eastern Highlands moist <b>deciduous</b> <b>forests</b> ecoregion.3 Major plant communities include mixed <b>deciduous</b> <b>forests</b> and scrublands.It has also high mineral deposit like bauxite and manganese etc.|$|R
5|$|Tigers can {{occupy a}} wide range of habitat types, but will usually require {{sufficient}} cover, proximity to water, and an abundance of prey. Compared to the lion, the tiger prefers denser vegetation, for which its camouflage colouring is ideally suited, and where a single predator is not at a disadvantage compared with the multiple felines in a pride. A further habitat requirement is the placement of suitably secluded den locations, which may consist of caves, large hollow trees, or dense vegetation. Bengal tigers in particular live in many types of forests, including wet, evergreen, and the semievergreen of Assam and eastern Bengal; the swampy mangrove forest of the Ganges Delta; the <b>deciduous</b> <b>forest</b> of Nepal, and the thorn forests of the Western Ghats. In various parts of their range they inhabit or have inhabited additionally partially open grassland and savanna as well as taiga forests and rocky habitats.|$|E
5|$|Although Myotis alcathoe was {{initially}} known only from Greece and Hungary and {{was thought to}} be restricted to southeast Europe, records since then have greatly expanded its range, and it is now known from Spain and England to Sweden and European Turkey. In several European countries, focused searches were conducted to detect its occurrence. Its habitat generally consists of moist, deciduous, mature forest near streams, for example in ravines or in alluvial forest (forest near a river), where there are many decaying trees that the bat can use as roosting sites. In Germany, its preferred habitat consists of mixed <b>deciduous</b> <b>forest.</b> In the south of the continent, it usually occurs in mountain ranges, but the factors affecting its distribution in the north are less well known. Its range appears to be similar in shape to those of the greater and lesser horseshoe bats (Rhinolophus ferrumequinum and R. hipposideros) and Myotis emarginatus. It may yet be found in other European countries, such as the Benelux countries, Ireland, and Moldova. Although there are abundant records from some areas, such as France and Hungary, the species appears to be rare in most of its range.|$|E
5|$|The single known living specimen, a {{young adult}} male, was {{collected}} at 80m (260ft) altitude in the Andaladomo forest (part of the Mikea Forest) in 2003. The Andaladomo forest is different in vegetation {{from the rest of}} the Mikea Forest, and is similar to forests further to the north on Madagascar. The animal was found in an isolated fragment of dry <b>deciduous</b> <b>forest</b> amid land cleared for maize cultivation. The trap was set at the foot of a tree surrounded by bushes and succulent plants. Other small mammals known from the Mikea Forest include the bastard big-footed mouse, the introduced black rat (Rattus rattus), several species of tenrecs, and the shrew Suncus madagascariensis. Although only a single individual of Petter's big-footed mouse was caught during Goodman and Soarimalala's survey, which accrued 3100trap-nights, they argue that this does not necessarily mean the species is rare, since trapping rates for rodents in the dry forests of Madagascar are often variable depending on year and season. Nothing is known of its behavior, but the animal's morphology suggests it lives on the ground.|$|E
50|$|The {{ecoregion}} is drier than surrounding ones, {{including the}} Eastern Highlands moist <b>deciduous</b> <b>forests</b> {{that covers the}} Eastern Ghats and Satpura Range to the south, and the Lower Gangetic Plains moist <b>deciduous</b> <b>forests</b> in the lowlands {{to the east and}} north.|$|R
