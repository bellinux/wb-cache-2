5|$|Specialised <b>football</b> <b>boots</b> {{began to}} emerge in the {{professional}} era, taking the place of everyday shoes or work boots. Players initially simply nailed strips of leather to their boots to enhance their grip, leading the Football Association to rule in 1863 that no nails could project from boots. By the 1880s these crude attachments had become studs. Boots of this era were made of heavy leather, had hard toecaps, and came high above a player's ankles.|$|E

5|$|Born in Townhill, near Dunfermline, Liddell was {{the eldest}} of coal miner James and wife Montgomery's six children. During his childhood, Liddell {{experienced}} austerity and poverty, with his family often having to subsist on bread, kail, and salt porridge. His parents became determined {{that he would not}} become a miner and helped him to decide a future career. He did not originally consider football as a viable profession, eventually choosing accountancy in preference to the civil service and church. His interest in football developed at a young age, which persuaded his parents, despite financial difficulties, to buy him a pair of <b>football</b> <b>boots</b> as a Christmas present when he asked for them aged seven. Liddell's participation in organised football began at age eight when he joined his school team, which had an average age of ten.|$|E

25|$|His many {{transfers}} {{were due}} primarily to his professional full-time career {{and the fact}} that he always remained an amateur, although many clubs wanted to hire him as a professional. He was the epitome of the 'Corinthian gentleman amateur' of his time, being an academic as well as a sportsman. He refused to wear ordinary <b>football</b> <b>boots</b> when playing, preferring walking brogues instead, declaring that boots marred his great sprinting speed.|$|E

50|$|The Copa Mundial (Spanish for World Cup) <b>football</b> <b>boot</b> was {{released}} in 1979. They were designed for the 1982 FIFA World Cup held in Spain. Going through very slight changes since then, the Copa is made in Scheinfeld, near Frankfurt in Germany. It has a kangaroo leather upper. Additional leather supports are provided from the heel, which are intended to improve durability and stability. Since 2001 {{it has been the}} world's best-selling <b>football</b> <b>boot.</b> Many superb sportsmen have worn them throughout the years. It has been used by the likes of Zinedine Zidane, Diego Maradona, Franz Beckenbauer, Jari Litmanen.|$|R
500|$|Most current players wear {{specialist}} <b>football</b> <b>boots,</b> {{which can}} be made either of leather or a synthetic material. Modern boots are cut slightly below the ankles, {{as opposed to the}} high-ankled boots used in former times, and have studs attached to the soles. Studs may be either moulded directly to the sole or be detachable, normally by means of a screw thread. Modern boots such as the Adidas Predator, originally designed by former Liverpool player Craig Johnston, feature increasingly intricate, scientifically aided designs and features such as air pockets in the soles and rubber [...] "blades" [...] on the sole rather than studs. The blades {{have been the subject of}} controversy as several top managers have blamed them for injuries both to opposition players and to the wearers themselves.|$|E
500|$|While {{most players}} wear studded <b>football</b> <b>boots</b> ("soccer shoes" [...] or [...] "cleats" [...] in U.S. English), the Laws do not specify {{that these are}} required. Shirts must have sleeves (both short and long sleeves are accepted), and goalkeepers must wear shirts which are easily {{distinguishable}} from all other players and the match officials. Thermal undershorts may be worn, but must be the same colour as the shorts themselves. Shin pads must be covered entirely by the stockings, be made of rubber, plastic or a similar material, and [...] "provide a reasonable degree of protection". The only other restriction on equipment defined in the Laws of the Game is the requirement that a player [...] "must not use equipment or wear anything that is dangerous to himself or another player".|$|E
500|$|The first written {{evidence}} of a clothing item specifically dedicated to football comes in 1526 from the Great Wardrobe of King Henry VIII of England, which included {{a reference to a}} pair of <b>football</b> <b>boots.</b> The earliest evidence of coloured shirts used to identify football teams comes from early English public school football games, for example an image of Winchester College football from before 1840 is entitled [...] "The commoners have red and the college boys blue jerseys" [...] and such colours are mentioned again in a Bell's Life in London article of 1858. House sporting colours are mentioned in Rugby football (rule XXI) as early as 1845: [...] "No player may wear cap or jersey without leave from the head of his house". In 1848 it was noted at Rugby that [...] "considerable improvement has taken place in the last few years, in the appearance of a match... in the use of peculiar dress consisting of velvet caps and jerseys" ...|$|E
5000|$|... 1970s: The 1970s and the 1980s {{saw many}} great {{advances}} {{and changes in}} the <b>football</b> <b>boot</b> design. The 1970s saw technological advances produce lighter boots and a variety of colours. In this decade, <b>football</b> <b>boot</b> sponsorship deals really took off. Adidas made huge strides out in front as the market leader. At the end of the decade, in 1979, it cemented its status by releasing what has gone on to become the best selling boot of all time; the iconic and timeless Copa Mundial. During this time period, some of the most common types of natural leather came into production: kangaroo leather, calfskin and full-grain/cow leather.|$|R

500|$|When {{running along}} Blackpool's beach, at 7 am, {{no matter the}} weather, Matthews wore shoes that {{contained}} lead, {{so that when he}} changed into his <b>football</b> <b>boots,</b> his feet felt light, giving himself the impression that he could run faster. Having trained to a level of fitness few other players would reach, by the mid-1950s he was able to cut back on his intense training as his level of fitness was by then ingrained in his body. He never smoked; instead, he was very conscious of every item of food and drink he consumed, and he maintained a rigid daily training regime from childhood up until his old age. In an interview with the FA he said, [...] "I had some very good advice and started to eat more salads and fruit, and every Monday I had no food. Just one day, on a Monday, but I felt better." [...] The only time he knowingly consumed alcohol was when drinking champagne out of the FA Cup in 1953.|$|E
500|$|... "He {{was very}} withdrawn, almost surly," [...] Cairns recalled, [...] "but he became {{animated}} {{on the football}} field". Ramsey was selected to play for Becontree Heath School {{when he was only}} seven years old, playing at inside-left alongside boys as old as fourteen; his nine-year-old brother Len was at inside-right. Alf's selection for the school team prompted the purchase of his first pair of <b>football</b> <b>boots.</b> Two years later, aged nine, he became captain of the school team. By this point he had switched to playing at centre-half—the key position of the [...] "WM" [...] formation then favoured in British football, between the full-backs and the forwards. His main strength was generally perceived to be his extremely accurate passing; his chief shortcoming was a lack of pace, for which Ramsey compensated by learning to read the game and position himself well. Ramsey played for teams representing the schools of Dagenham and Essex County respectively, and trialled unsuccessfully for the London schools team while at Becontree. While he was at school, his brother Albert took him to see his first Football League match, watching their favourite team, West Ham United, play against Arsenal. This was the only senior match Alf would attend before playing in them himself. He later wrote that his main recollection of it was the performance of one of the Arsenal forwards, the Scotland international Alex James.|$|E
