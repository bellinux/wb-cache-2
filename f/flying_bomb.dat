In a match against the British Civil Defence Services at Lord's in July, Miller reached his century just as a V-1 <b>flying</b> <b>bomb</b> landed nearby. In a match against an , Miller scored 85 in 100 minutes. He then took match figures of 6/28 against the West of England at Bristol.|$|E
5|$|Portsmouth Harbour was a vital {{military}} embarkation {{point for}} the D-Day landings on 6June 1944. Southwick House, just {{to the north of}} the city, was the headquarters of the Supreme Allied Commander, US General Dwight D. Eisenhower. On 15July 1944 an experimental V-1 <b>flying</b> <b>bomb</b> hit Newcomen Road, killing 15 people.|$|E
5|$|Night train {{services}} stopped {{running from}} Victoria on 4 September 1939 after World War II was declared, {{and other services}} were terminated following the German invasion of France in May 1940. Though the station was bombed several times in 1940 and 1941, {{there was not enough}} damage to prevent operations. A plane crashed into {{the eastern side of the}} station on 15 September 1940 and a <b>flying</b> <b>bomb</b> caused partial damage on 27 June 1944.|$|E

50|$|Intelligence reports {{detailing}} {{the threat posed}} by Germany's <b>flying</b> <b>bombs</b> resulted in the instigation of Operation Totter, whereby ROC posts would fire ‘Snowflake’ illuminating rocket flares in order to alert RAF fighters to the presence of V-1 <b>flying</b> <b>bombs.</b> Observers at the coastal post of Dymchurch identified the very first of these weapons and within seconds of their report the defences were in action.|$|R
5|$|To {{preserve}} the secrecy of the weapon, its use was initially permitted only over water, where a dud round could {{not fall into}} enemy hands. In late 1943, the Army obtained permission {{for it to be}} used over land. It proved particularly effective against the V-1 <b>flying</b> <b>bomb</b> over England, and later Antwerp in 1944. The use of a version fired from howitzers against ground targets was authorized in response to the German Ardennes Offensive in December 1944, with deadly effect. By the end of 1944, VT fuzes were coming off the production lines at the rate of 40,000 per day.|$|E
5|$|During the Second World War Cockcroft became Assistant Director of Scientific Research in the Ministry of Supply, {{working on}} radar. He {{was also a}} member of the {{committee}} formed to handle issues arising from the Frisch–Peierls memorandum, which calculated that an atomic bomb could be technically feasible, and of the MAUD Committee which succeeded it. In 1940, as part of the Tizard Mission, he shared British technology with his counterparts in the United States. Later in the war, the fruits of the Tizard Mission came back to Britain in the form of the SCR-584 radar set and the proximity fuze, which were used to defeat the V-1 <b>flying</b> <b>bomb.</b> In May 1944, he became director of the Montreal Laboratory, and oversaw the development of the ZEEP and NRX reactors, and the creation of the Chalk River Laboratories.|$|E
5|$|On 13 June 1944 the V-1 <b>flying</b> <b>bomb</b> {{offensive}} {{began and}} Cunningham was tasked with assisting with their interception. He also coordinated his efforts with No. 100 Group RAF, which {{were engaged in}} intruder operations over occupied Europe. Cunningham was concerned at using Mosquitoes for intercepting V-1s because {{of the dangers of}} the bomb exploding and damaging the attacking fighter. One of his former commanding officers and current Group Captain Edward Crew—an ace with 15 enemy aircraft and 31 V-1s shot down—was forced to bail out when the nose of his Mosquito was split open. The operations did last long and by August 1944 the Mosquitoes were back on bomber support missions.|$|E

5|$|Operation Teardrop was a United States Navy {{operation}} of World War II conducted during April and May 1945 to sink German U-boats approaching the United States East Coast that {{were believed to}} be armed with V-1 <b>flying</b> <b>bombs.</b> Germany had threatened in propaganda to attack New York with V-1 <b>flying</b> <b>bombs</b> and V-2 missiles. After the war the Allies determined that the submarines had not been carrying either.|$|R

5|$|Posted to Britain in April 1944, Barr went ashore at Omaha Beach {{two days}} after D-Day {{as part of an}} air support control unit. During the {{campaign}} in Normandy, he flew rocket-armed Hawker Typhoons on operations against V-1 <b>flying</b> <b>bomb</b> launch sites. After his return to Australia on 11September, Barr was promoted to acting wing commander and appointed chief instructor at No.2 Operational Training Unit in Mildura, Victoria, taking over from Bobby Gibbes. He also went to New Guinea and flew some ground-attack missions in the Kittyhawk to gain experience in the South West Pacific theatre. Following the end of hostilities in August 1945, Barr was treated for recurring fever and underwent two operations on his limbs in No.6 RAAF Hospital, Heidelberg. He was discharged from the Air Force on 8October.|$|E
5|$|Soon {{after his}} return, Cockcroft was {{appointed}} Chief Superintendent of the Air Defence Research Development Establishment (ADRDE) at Christchurch, Hampshire. His {{focus was on}} the use of radar for shooting down enemy aircraft. The GL Mk. III radar was developed as a target tracking and predicting radar, but by 1942 the SCR-584 radar developed for the same purpose in the United States became available, and Cockcroft recommended that it be acquired under Lend-Lease. On his own initiative, he acquired SCR-584 sets for testing, and trials conducted on the Isle of Sheppey in October 1943 conclusively demonstrated that SCR-584 was superior. This made Cockcroft very unpopular at the Ministry of Supply, but he had intelligence that the Germans were planning to deploy the V-1 <b>flying</b> <b>bomb.</b> On 1 January 1944, Lieutenant-General Sir Ronald Weeks sent Washington an urgent request for 134 SCR-584 sets.|$|E
5|$|Australians also {{continued}} {{to be involved in}} Allied air attacks aimed at disrupting movement of German troops and supplies to Normandy during July and August. As well as supporting the ground forces in Normandy and continuing to bomb V-1 <b>flying</b> <b>bomb</b> launch facilities in northern France, Bomber Command attacked railway facilities in France during July and August, and {{at least one of the}} Australian heavy bomber squadrons participated in 15 of the 25 raids conducted against these targets. No.464 Squadron also flew more than 350 sorties during July and 400 in August against transport infrastructure in France and convoys of German vehicles. These operations, which were generally conducted at night, cost the unit three aircraft. The only interruption to No.464 Squadron's attacks on transportation came on the night of 14/15 July, when four aircraft piloted by highly experienced airmen conducted a successful precision strike on the Gestapo barracks at Bonneuil-Matours. Australian aircrew assigned to other 2TAF medium bomber and fighter-bomber units also participated in attacks on bridges and railways throughout July.|$|E

5|$|By August the {{division}} was {{still waiting to}} be deployed, but now plans envisioned using {{them as part of}} a larger force. Operation Transfigure involved {{the division}}, the 52nd (Lowland) Infantry Division, the US 101st Airborne Division, and the 1st Polish Parachute Brigade landing at Rambouillet St Arnoult, to close the gap between Orléans and Paris. Operation Axehead, using the same force, was to seize the bridges over the River Seine in support of 21st Army Group. Operation Boxer, with the same force, was to seize Boulogne and assault V1 <b>flying</b> <b>bomb</b> sites. Near the end of the month, Operation Linnet, with the same units as before, was formulated to seize crossings over the Escaut. Operation Infatuate, drawn up in early September, involved the entire I Airborne Corps landing in Belgium to trap the retreating German armies in the Scheldt estuary, as well as aiming to threaten Antwerp.|$|E
5|$|Hangar 4 {{is one of}} Duxford's {{historic}} hangars, and now houses {{an exhibition}} exploring Duxford's history as an operational RAF airfield from the First World War to the Cold War. The early period is represented by a Bristol Fighter, a type operated by Duxford's No.2 Flying Training School from 1920. The latter period is represented by a Hawker Hunter which flew at Duxford with No. 65 Squadron RAF, a Gloster Javelin, the type which made the last operational flight at Duxford in 1961, and by a Hungarian Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-21, a common Warsaw Pact jet fighter. Britain's air defence during the Second World War is particularly emphasised, with exhibits representing the Battle of Britain, the Blitz and the V-1 <b>flying</b> <b>bomb</b> offensive from 1944. Notable aircraft include a Messerschmitt Bf-109E which was flown during the Battle of Britain until forced down in Sussex due to engine failure. It is displayed {{as part of a}} tableau showing the crashed aircraft under guard. One unusual aircraft on display is the Cierva C.30A autogyro, which was used by 74 (Signals) Wing, based at Duxford, to test the calibration of coastal radar units.|$|E
