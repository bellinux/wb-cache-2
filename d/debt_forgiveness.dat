40|$|This {{paper offers}} a brief primer on the {{economics}} of debt reduction for developing countries. It begins by considering the case of unilateral <b>debt</b> forgiveness; such <b>forgiveness</b> {{is only in the}} mutual interest of creditors and debtors if the country is {{on the wrong side of}} fhe "debt Laffer curve". Current empirical estimafes suggest that problem debtors are in a very flat region of the debt Laffer curve where large changes in face value of debf have only small effcts in expected payments. The paper then considers a variety of market-based debt reduction schemes. It shows that the widespread belief that the markt offers a cheap way to reduce debt is incorrect; unless new market instruments can be made credibly senior to existing debt, debt reductions that impose only small costs to creditors would be very expensive if achieved through buy back.

40|$|A {{letter report}} {{issued by the}} Government Accountability Office with an {{abstract}} that begins "To assist {{the growing number of}} taxpayers facing foreclosure or mortgage restructuring, the Mortgage <b>Forgiveness</b> <b>Debt</b> Relief Act of 2007, and its 3 -year extension as part of the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008, allows taxpayers to generally exclude from taxable income forgiven mortgage debt used to buy, build, or substantially improve a principal residence. Joint Committee on Taxation (JCT) estimates originally suggested that the exclusion of forgiven mortgage debt from taxable income may result in about $ 968 million in federal revenue losses from fiscal year (FY) 2008 through FY 2013 and more recent estimates suggest that the revenue losses could be closer to $ 1. 9 billion. The Department of Treasury estimates suggest that the exclusion may result in federal revenue losses of about $ 1. 4 billion from FY 2008 through FY 2013. Some taxpayers with forgiven mortgage debts may be bankrupt or insolvent; however, others are not and therefore may have the ability to pay taxes on forgiven mortgage debts. The briefing slides summarize our assessment of the Internal Revenue Service's (IRS) administration of this tax provision. In response to your request, our objectives were to identify 1. the number of taxpayers who have reported the exclusion of forgiven mortgage debt since the program's inception and the dollar amount excluded; 2. the challenges, if any, IRS faces in administering the exclusion and evaluate how effectively IRS is addressing the challenges; and 3. the challenges, if any, taxpayers could face in understanding whether forgiven mortgage debt can be excluded from taxable income and evaluate how to address these challenges. ...|$|R

40|$|Of Dollars and Sense {{proposes a}} new context for reading {{dramatic}} depictions of forgiveness in early American novels {{by examining the}} relationships among religious sermons, popular fiction, and bankruptcy law. Between the Panic of 1797 and the Panic of 1837, the events which frame this project, the United States experienced three unprecedented cultural events: {{the passage of the}} first, and highly controversial, federal bankruptcy law in 1800; the Second Great Awakening; {{and the rise of the}} American novel. My dissertation explores the ways in which early American authors responded to the phenomenon of bankruptcy by dramatizing religiously inflected scenes of forgiveness in their work. The project provides a new understanding of how deeply the early American novel was invested in economic affairs, and in efforts to humanize what many perceived to be a ruthless system of early capitalism. Chapter one offers an historical survey of the interrelations of religious and economic conceptions of <b>debt</b> and its <b>forgiveness</b> in Western culture more broadly, providing a close examination of the cultural changes affecting such understandings in the American early republic [...] particularly the transformation of the concept of debt as a spiritual state into a purely economic one. As indebtedness became a problem understood in purely economic terms, a new discourse about bankruptcy reframed the discussion by attempting to talk about economic and communal life in terms of morality. Chapter Two examines the Panic of 1797 and two of the most popular novels of the period: Susannah Rowson 2 ̆ 7 s Charlotte Temple (1794), and Hannah Webster Foster 2 ̆ 7 s The Coquette (1797). Reading these novels against a wave of religious sermons on forgiveness, I argue that by constructing novels replete with scenes of both economic and interpersonal forgiveness, Rowson and Foster provide literary responses to two of the central questions in the bankruptcy debate: to whom should the law apply, and under what conditions? Chapter three examines the Panic of 1819 and traces efforts to blend the discourse of spiritual rebirth with the political discourse on bankruptcy. As the Second Great Awakening spread, James Fenimore Cooper was literally writing his way out of his own impending bankruptcy. In The Last of the Mohicans, Cooper uses the structure of the frontier romance itself to both reveal and to attack endless, fruitless, vengeful and ultimately murderous methods of 2 ̆ 2 exchange 2 ̆ 2 that have brought on both the Panic and the destruction of Cooper 2 ̆ 7 s personal family fortune. Chapter Four examines the Panic of 1837 and the Bankruptcy Act of 1841. The depression that precipitated the Act produced an entirely new genre of fiction called 2 ̆ 2 panic fiction 2 ̆ 2 including novels by Hannah Lee, Eliza Follen, and Frederick Jackson. These texts provide very explicit warnings against economic speculation, excessive materialism, and other risky economic practices, while at the same time advocating for the passage of a federal bankruptcy law that would bring both predictability and forgiveness into an arena that these authors, and the much of the public, viewed as corrupt and immoral...|$|R
