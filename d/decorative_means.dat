5|$|In China, {{silk-worm}} farming {{was originally}} restricted to women, and many women {{were employed in}} the silk-making industry. Even though some saw {{the development of a}} luxury product as useless, silk provoked such a craze among high society that the rules in the Li Ji were used to limit its use {{to the members of the}} imperial family. For approximately a millennium, the right to wear silk was reserved for the emperor and the highest dignitaries. Silk was, at the time, a sign of great wealth, because of its shimmering appearance. This appearance was due to silk's prism-like shape/structure, which refracted light from every angle. After some time, silk gradually extended to other classes of Chinese society. Silk began to be used for <b>decorative</b> <b>means</b> and also in less luxurious ways: musical instruments, fishing, and bow making. Peasants did not have the right to wear silk until the Qing dynasty (1644–1911).|$|E

50|$|The {{decoration}} had specific {{meanings and}} can not be read as merely decorative; thus laurels, military shields and horns-of-plenty were placed in the houses of military personnel. In a similar vein, Greek and Roman myths were depicted elsewhere to represent abstract humanist ideals, so that the <b>decorative</b> became a <b>means</b> to express and disseminate Renaissance ideals.|$|R
40|$|Dan Rees {{engages with}} a {{tradition}} of conceptual art making, in which familiar tropes and genres – monochromes, abstracts, ready-mades – are quietly unhinged and recuperated as strategies for production. The exhibition’s central series of Artex Paintings revive a decorative ceiling pattern, popular in British working class homes during the 1970 s. Creating this type of plasterwork, once a skilled manual job, has now been rendered all but redundant as the material fell out of fashion during the late 1980 s. Rees’ methodology is driven through both {{a recognition of the}} steady disappearance of the working class over recent decades and the overwriting of much of its history, as much of the disappearance of artex as a <b>decorative</b> <b>mean</b> itself. Within Rees’ paintings, distinctive shell-like patterns are combed through energetically coloured fields. Incidental manifestations within the fluid oil register against the formal exercise of combing, which both obliterates and transforms the painted surface beneath. Devoid of saturated images or commercial slogans, the impersonal forms of Rees’ Trivision Billboards punctuate the exhibition. With their industrial and austere presence, they simulate or disguise themselves as minimalist sculptures. Placed variously on the walls and floors of the gallery spaces, their repetition suggests how they might be ordered in manifold sizes and formations. However, while minimalist objects traditionally asked to be considered as materials without reference to an outside reality, Rees undermines this logic by presenting a mechanism intended to broadcast information. Similarly, the Artex Paintings could be understood as a deliberate subversion of abstract expressionism’s themes, in which gestural spontaneity has been rendered via the methodical repetitions of a builder’s tool. In Rees’ continued examination of reproduction and repetition, the work enters the format of a series, removing it from wry conceptual exercise. While the abstract works of the Artex Paintings and the minimalism of the billboards do not project the artist’s ideology directly, this is more clearly revealed in Rees’ video work Road Back To Relevance. Produced in collaboration with an advertising strategist and designer, the slide-show questions of how various modes of social engagement can remain relevant today by charting the course of a specific solidarity campaign, started in the 1980 s between Wales and Nicaragua. While the visual tone of this work might suggest a need for such solidarity campaigns to modernise in order to reach a wider audience, the conclusion appears to be the opposite. Rather, the work points to the relevance of maintaining an inclusive and personal approach towards creating new connections between people, one that goes beyond issues of technology and dispersion. Dan Rees (born 1982, UK) lives and works in Berlin. Solo exhibitions include Stimulate Surprise at Tanya Leighton Gallery, Berlin (2015); Kelp at MOSTYN, Wales and at The National Museum of Wales, Cardiff (2013); Gravel Master at The Goss-Michael Foundation, Dallas (2013); Philanthropy at Jonathan Viner, London (2011); French Cricket at Tanya Leighton, Berlin (2010); They Don't Make Them Like This Anymore at T 293, Naples (2009) and Alan Brooks and Dan Rees at MOT International, London (2008) ...|$|R
40|$|As {{an artist}} who {{operates}} {{in the realm of}} the subjective, I use techniques of image appropriation as an external means to negotiate my internal world. In the treatment of sourced images, specifically through fracturing, disrupting and subverting, I re-enact a formal fracture of identity. A key narrative within the exploration of this subjective identification is the inherent push-and-pull of my relationship with my mother. A tension of opposites reverberates throughout the practical research: object and subject, self and other, male and female, straight and gay, surface and meaning; in a capacity that can be subversive, anxious, delicate and harmonious. The psychoanalytic theory of Jacques Lacan and Melanie Klein provides a useful model in which to demystify these tensions and provide a lateral basis for my approach to the aesthetic. I will probe further the issue of the mother in the context of feminist theory by Joan Copjec, and compare my approach to this theme with other artists. The monstrous orchid, a botanic hybrid of the late Victorian era, offers the perfect metaphor through which to explore some of the issues that connect my subjectivity to the practical research. I examine the significance of Oscar Wilde and Aubrey Beardsley for their championing of the <b>decorative</b> as a <b>means</b> to communicate the subversive. The research explores examples in Victorian and contemporary art that approach the subversive through autobiography and artifice, referencing my own past when self was surface. I highlight in the theoretical research the important role of the mask in connecting the internal with the external. Three important concepts help qualify this connection: Julia Kristeva's notion of the abject, Judith Butler's views on gender and performativity and Laura Mulvey's articulation of the gaze. I will investigate the technical dimension to my approach through multiple frameworks. This includes a semiotic discussion on symbolism in Picasso and the potential for image to act as language and narrative in a way that can function independent of the subjective. In addition to the exploration of the principle is detournement, a 1950 s strategy I will situate my work against. Recognising that I work within a space of queer aesthetics, I also define my position through an examination of theories of camp in the written exegesis. I compare the ideas of Susan Sontag with more updated definitions of camp, uncovering the secret subversive language of polari and highlight the symbolic and technical potential of the closet in the context of Eve Kosofsky Sedgwick's gender theory...|$|R
