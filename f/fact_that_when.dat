5|$|It's good to {{know people}} didn't see it coming. That's a big concern when you {{have this kind of}} story line and you are leading to that kind of reveal. You don't want people to be expecting it, {{especially}} in the Walking Dead. I pride myself in the <b>fact</b> <b>that,</b> <b>when</b> you pick up an issue of the comic, you don't know what's going to happen at any time. So any time we can work that into the show and maintain that in a television environment, it's very exciting for me. I’m glad people are being caught off guard.|$|E
5|$|Roxas' {{personality}} changes significantly {{across the}} series {{due to the}} <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>when</b> first introduced, he appears with fake memories that make him believe he is a common teenager, and {{spends most of his}} time with his friends. After learning that he is Sora's Nobody, and remembering his past, Roxas gives up his existence so that Sora can continue to exist, but still expresses happiness for his fate. During his time in the Organization, Roxas develops a calm personality as a result of having no memories of a previous life, unlike other Nobodies.|$|E
5|$|In 1751, Caroline's {{daughter}} Princess Amelia became ranger of Richmond Park {{after the}} death of Robert Walpole. Immediately afterwards, the Princess caused major public uproar by closing the park to the public, only allowing few close friends and those with special permits to enter. This continued until 1758, when a local brewer, John Lewis, took the gatekeeper, who stopped him from entering the park, to court. The court ruled in favour of Lewis, citing the <b>fact</b> <b>that,</b> <b>when</b> Charles I enclosed the park in the 17th century, he allowed the public right of way in the park. Princess Amelia was forced to lift the restrictions.|$|E
5000|$|It is {{recommended}} to use manufacturer's alignment target values {{to set up}} the machine train to a defined non-zero alignment, due to the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> later, <b>when</b> the machine is at operation temperature, the alignment condition is perfect ...|$|R
60|$|It {{may seem}} strange, but {{such is the}} <b>fact,</b> <b>that</b> even <b>when</b> thus {{surrounded}} by danger my curiosity {{was so great that}} I asked him, even before he had time to explain how he hoped to effect our rescue, where he had been so long.|$|R
50|$|A {{party to}} {{a civil suit}} {{generally}} must clearly state all relevant allegations of <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> {{form the basis of}} a claim. The requisite level of precision and particularity of these allegations varies, depending on the rules of civil procedure and jurisdiction. Parties who face uncertainties regarding facts and circumstances attendant to their side in a dispute may sometimes invoke alternative pleading. In this situation, a party may plead separate sets of <b>facts</b> <b>that</b> (<b>when</b> considered together) may be contradictory or mutually exclusive. This (seemingly) logically-inconsistent presentation of facts may be necessary as a safeguard against contingencies (such as res judicata) that would otherwise preclude presenting a claim or defense that depends on a particular interpretation of the underlying facts.|$|R
5|$|In Scandinavian folklore, {{a diverse}} array of human-like supernatural beings are attested which might {{be thought of as}} elves and which might partly {{originate}} in medieval Scandinavian beliefs. However, the characteristics and names of these beings has varied widely across time and space, and they cannot be neatly categorised. These beings are sometimes known by words descended directly from Old Norse álfr. However, in the modern languages, these traditional terms have tended to be replaced with other terms. Things are further complicated by the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>when</b> referring to the elves of Old Norse mythology, scholars have adopted new forms based directly on the Old Norse word álfr. The following table summarises the situation in the main modern standard languages of Scandinavia.|$|E
25|$|Deliberate, {{productive}} {{struggle with}} mathematical ideas {{refers to the}} <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>when</b> students exert effort with important mathematical ideas, even if this struggle initially involves confusion and errors, {{the end result is}} greater learning. This {{has been shown to be}} true whether the struggle is due to challenging, well-implemented teaching, or due to faulty teaching the students must struggle to make sense of.|$|E
25|$|Then in December Rolla was {{commissioned}} under Lieutenant Joseph Acott. On 10 February 1807 she sailed to Rio Grande with an army commissary officer aboard to procure provisions from the Portuguese. While Rollo was at Montevideo she suffered from desertions. This was {{a consequence of}} the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>when</b> Popham had drawn on the other vessels in his fleet to man her, their captains sent over their worst men.|$|E
60|$|The <b>fact</b> was, <b>that</b> <b>when</b> {{the five}} hundred pounds {{had come into}} my pocket, a thought had come into my head which had been often there before; and it {{appeared}} to me that Wemmick was a good person to advise with concerning such thought.|$|R

25|$|We {{should all}} {{be aware of the}} <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>when</b> r{{evolutionary}} — not evolutionary — changes come, things can get even worse. The intelligentsia should be aware of this. And it is the intelligentsia specifically that should keep this in mind and prevent society from radical steps and revolutions of all kinds. We’ve had enough of it. We’ve seen so many revolutions and wars. We need decades of calm and harmonious development.|$|E
25|$|The primary defect {{associated}} with iminoglycinuria is a homozygous (recessive) mutation of the SLC36A2 (PAT2) gene. One of several membrane transport proteins in the {{solute carrier family}} of amino acid transporters, PAT2 is the high-affinity renal transporter of glycine, proline and hydroxyproline found to be defective in both alleles when iminoglycinuria is present in an individual. This {{is in contrast to}} the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>when</b> only one PAT2 allele is defective, hyperglycinuria will be present instead of iminoglycinuria. These findings delineate iminoglycinuria as the homozygous form of hyperglycinuria, with the former having a higher degree of urinary excretion of glycine and imino acids correlating to mutations in both alleles.|$|E
25|$|A vector may be {{described}} as a list of numbers in terms of a basis, but as a geometrical object a vector retains its own identity regardless of how one chooses to describe it in a basis. This persistence of identity is reflected in the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>when</b> a vector is written in one basis, and then the basis is changed, the components of the vector transform according to a change of basis formula. Such a transformation law is known as a covariant transformation. The covariant derivative is required to transform, under a change in coordinates, {{in the same way as}} a basis does: the covariant derivative must change by a covariant transformation (hence the name).|$|E

60|$|Their {{isolation}} was rendered {{more complete}} by the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> Ruth, <b>when</b> she had ornamented New York society, had made few real friends. Most {{of the girls}} she had known bored her. They were gushing creatures {{with a passion for}} sharing and imparting secrets, and Ruth's cool reserve had alienated her from them.|$|R
25|$|This {{variation}} of the patch clamp method {{is very similar to}} the whole-cell configuration. The main difference lies in the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>when</b> the experimenter forms the gigaohm seal, suction is not used to rupture the patch membrane. Instead, the electrode solution contains small amounts of an antifungal or antibiotic agent, such as amphothericin-B, nystatin, or gramicidin, which diffuses into the membrane patch and forms small pores in the membrane, providing electrical access to the cell interior. When comparing the whole-cell and perforated patch methods, one can think of the whole-cell patch as an open door, in which there is complete exchange between molecules in the pipette solution and the cytoplasm. The perforated patch can be likened to a screen door that only allows the exchange of certain molecules from the pipette solution to the cytoplasm of the cell.|$|E
25|$|In 2011, {{a retired}} Air Force officer, Major Wesley T. Carter, filed a {{complaint}} with the Air Force Inspector General alleging that the Air Force knew that UC-123Ks used for spraying Agent Orange in Vietnam remained contaminated and that the Air Force had failed to properly inform subsequent flight crews of the risks following their transfer to the Air Force Reserve at the end of the Vietnam War. In his complaint, Major Carter contends that the Air Force has known since 1994 that the aircraft were contaminated with the defoliant; he cites the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>when</b> a former C-123 was being prepared for a permanent static display that workers had to use HAZMAT suits and respirators. Additionally, it is asserted that when the aircraft was tested by the Air Force, it contained high levels of the known carcinogen polychlorinated dibenzodioxin, studies since confirmed by the Oregon Health Sciences University and Columbia University's Mailman School of Public Health.|$|E
25|$|A horreum (plural: horrea) was a type {{of public}} {{warehouse}} used during the ancient Roman period. Although the Latin term {{is often used to}} refer to granaries, Roman horrea were used to store many other types of consumables; the giant Horrea Galbae in Rome were used not only to store grain but also olive oil, wine, foodstuffs, clothing and even marble. By the end of the imperial period, the city of Rome had nearly 300 horrea to supply its demands. The biggest were enormous, even by modern standards; the Horrea Galbae contained 140 rooms on the ground floor alone, covering an area of some 225,000 square feet (21,000 m²). The amount of storage space available in the public horrea can be judged by the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>when</b> the emperor Septimius Severus died in 211 AD, he is said to have left the city's horrea stocked with enough food to supply Rome's million-strong population for seven years. Smaller (though similar) horrea were a standard feature of Roman towns, cities and forts throughout the empire; well-preserved examples of military horrea have been excavated on Hadrian's Wall in England, notably at the forts of Housesteads, Corbridge and South Shields.|$|E

5000|$|Another notable <b>fact</b> was <b>that</b> <b>when</b> Yoshi hatched, {{the dinosaur}} {{was not born}} with his red shell, as {{revealed}} when Luigi {{told the story of}} Yoshi's birth in the final episode, [...] "Mama Luigi". Yoshi also ate several enemies after he was found, but unlike in the game, Yoshi remained small.|$|R
5000|$|The <b>facts</b> are <b>that</b> <b>when</b> Bramante went to Milan in 1480, {{where he}} was {{employed}} on creating the dome for the church of Santa Maria delle Grazie. [...] "By 1490, centralized structures not unlike those of Bramante's St. Peter's or Santa Maria della Consolazione at Todi had appeared amongst Leonardo's sketches." ...|$|R
500|$|In The Meaning of Witchcraft, Gardner {{also notes}} the term Wicas {{resemblance}} to the Old English word wicca, stating that [...] "It is a curious <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>when</b> the witches became English-speaking they adopted their Saxon name 'Wica'." [...] In his published writings, Gardner propounds the idea that his Pagan Witchcraft religion dated {{back at least to}} the Anglo-Saxon period, when Old English was the dominant language.|$|E
500|$|The Elves {{are also}} called the [...] "Firstborn" [...] (Q. Minnónar) or the [...] "Elder Kindred" [...] (as opposed to Men, the Secondborn) as they were [...] "awakened" [...] before Men by Eru Ilúvatar (the creator). The Elves named {{themselves}} Quendi ("the Speakers"), in honour of the <b>fact</b> <b>that,</b> <b>when</b> they were created, {{they were the only}} living beings able to speak. The Dúnedain called them Nimîr ("the Beautiful"), while their usual name in Sindarin was Eledhrim.|$|E
500|$|Hemodynamic {{techniques}} {{take advantage}} of the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>when</b> an area of the brain works at a task, blood is sent to supply that area with oxygen (in {{what is known as the}} Blood Oxygen Level-Dependent, or BOLD, response). [...] Such techniques include PET and fMRI. [...] These techniques provide high spatial resolution, allowing researchers to pinpoint the location of activity within the brain; temporal resolution (or information about the timing of brain activity), on the other hand, is poor, since the BOLD response happens much more slowly than language processing. [...] In addition to demonstrating which parts of the brain may subserve specific language tasks or computations, hemodynamic methods have also been used to demonstrate how the structure of the brain's language architecture and the distribution of language-related activation may change over time, as a function of linguistic exposure.|$|E

60|$|That the cat did {{not turn}} and rend Tarzan is {{something}} of a miracle which may possibly be accounted for by the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> twice <b>when</b> it turned growling upon the ape-man he had rapped it sharply upon its sensitive nose, inculcating in its mind thereby a most wholesome fear of the cudgel and the ape-beasts behind it.|$|R

500|$|Executive {{producers}} J.H. Wyman and Jeff Pickner {{were both}} impressed with Torv's {{take on the}} role, with Wyman stating that it [...] "just transcended all our expectations", while Pinkner noted that Nimoy himself was [...] "the most proud and most impressed" [...] with the outcome. Actor Joshua Jackson found her performance [...] "so creepy". He explained, [...] "In the episodes, you see I can barely look at her. I think it ended up being {{a good way to}} play Peter’s reaction to Olivia, but it was born out of the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>when</b> that voice came out of her, I was like: ‘Oh, that’s just wrong!'" [...] Pinkner confirmed in an interview with TVline that Bell's appearance would last for [...] "a couple" [...] episodes, and also warned that [...] "cohabitation is not as benign as William assumes it is", a reference to problems Bell would soon have in Olivia's body. The possessed state of Olivia has led viewers to refer to her as [...] "Bellivia".|$|E
500|$|... "My part is done," [...] Rhodes {{wrote to}} Maund, soon after {{reaching}} Cape Town; [...] "the charter is granted supporting Rudd Concession and granting us the interior... We {{have the whole}} thing recognised by the Queen and even if eventually we had any difficulty with king [...] the Home people would now always recognise us in possession of the minerals they quite understand that savage potentates frequently repudiate." [...] A few weeks later, he wrote to Maund again: with the royal charter in place, [...] "whatever [...] does now will not affect the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>when</b> there is a white occupation of the country our concession will come into force provided the English and not Boers get the country". On 29 October 1889, nearly {{a year to the}} day after the signing of the Rudd Concession, Rhodes's chartered company, the British South Africa Company, was officially granted its royal charter by Queen Victoria. The concession's legitimacy was now safeguarded by the charter and, by extension, the British Crown, making it practically unassailable.|$|E
500|$|In 2004, the African American Historical and Cultural Society Museum in San Francisco {{assembled}} a Queen Califia exhibit, curated by John William Templeton, featuring works by {{artists such as}} TheArthur Wright and James Gayles; artistic interpretations of Calafia. The show displayed a 1936 treatment of Lucille Lloyd's [...] "California Allegory" [...] triptych, with Queen Califia as the central figure. Templeton said that [...] "Califia {{is a part of}} California history, and she also reinforces the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>when</b> Cortes named this place California, he had 300 black people with him." [...] Templeton pointed out that Columbus had a black navigator and that Africans were seen by Europeans as being culturally advanced in the 15th century. William E. Hoskins, director of the museum, said that very few people know the story of Queen Califia. He said, [...] "One of the things we're trying to do is let people have the additional insight and appreciation for the contributions of African Americans to this wonderful country and more specifically to the state of California", adding that [...] "the Queen Califia exhibit is particularly poignant." ...|$|E
50|$|A key missing <b>fact</b> is <b>that</b> <b>when</b> {{after being}} helped {{the first time}} (before the police arrived) was that after the initial help, Nizah {{was found in the}} street after a taxi refused her service.
