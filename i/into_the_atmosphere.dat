5|$|In late December 2014, NASA's MAVEN {{spacecraft}} detected {{evidence of}} widespread auroras in Mars's northern hemisphere and descended to approximately 20–30 degrees North latitude of Mars's equator. The particles causing the aurora penetrated into the Martian atmosphere, creating auroras below 100km above the surface, Earth's auroras range from 100km to 500km above the surface. Magnetic {{fields in the}} solar wind drape over Mars, <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>atmosphere,</b> and the charged particles follow the solar wind magnetic field lines <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>atmosphere,</b> causing auroras to occur outside the magnetic umbrellas.|$|E

40|$|Solutions are {{presented}} for the aerothermal heating {{environment for the}} forebody heatshield of candidate Galileo probe. Entry <b>into</b> both <b>the</b> nominal and cool-heavy model atmospheres were considered. Solutions were obtained for the candidate heavy probe with a weight of 310 kg and a lighter probe with a weight of 290 kg. In the flowfield analysis, a finite difference procedure was employed to obtain benchmark predictions of pressure, radiative and convective heating rates, and the steady-state wall blowing rates. Calculated heating rates for entry <b>into</b> <b>the</b> cool-heavy model <b>atmosphere</b> were about 60 percent higher than those predicted for <b>the</b> entry <b>into</b> <b>the</b> nominal <b>atmosphere.</b> <b>The</b> total mass lost for entry <b>into</b> <b>the</b> cool-heavy model <b>atmosphere</b> was about 146 kg and the mass lost for entry <b>into</b> <b>the</b> nominal model <b>atmosphere</b> was about 101 kg...|$|R
5|$|A {{hypothesis}} for {{the high}} metal content in SMR dwarf stars is that material enriched in heavy elements fell <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>atmosphere</b> from a protoplanetary disk. This would pollute the star's external layers, resulting in a higher than normal metallicity. The lack of a deep convection zone {{would mean that the}} outer layers would retain higher abundance ratios of these heavy elements.|$|E
5|$|A {{major problem}} in sending space probes to Jupiter is that the planet has no solid surface on which to land, {{as there is a}} smooth {{transition}} between the planet's atmosphere and its fluid interior.

5|$|Callisto's leading {{hemisphere}} is less reflective {{than its}} trailing hemisphere, which could indicate {{that one of}} its sides has a higher surface temperature. On this darker, warmer side, sublimation rates of its icy surface would also be higher, causing more water vapor to be released <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>atmosphere.</b> This process would ultimately produce more hydrogen, which might explain the aforementioned variance in Callisto's atmospheric hydrogen levels.|$|E

5|$|Loading an {{oil tanker}} {{consists}} primarily of pumping cargo into the ship's tanks. As oil enters the tank, the vapors inside the tank must be somehow expelled. Depending on local regulations, the vapors can be expelled <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>atmosphere</b> or discharged {{back to the}} pumping station {{by way of a}} vapor recovery line. It is also common for the ship to move water ballast during the loading of cargo to maintain proper trim.|$|E
5|$|Physical and {{chemical}} characteristics of volcanic ash are primarily {{controlled by the}} style of volcanic eruption. Volcanoes display a range of eruption styles which are controlled by magma chemistry, crystal content, temperature and dissolved gases of the erupting magma and can be classified using the volcanic explosivity index (VEI). Effusive eruptions (VEI 1) of basaltic composition produce <105 m3 of ejecta, whereas extremely explosive eruptions (VEI 5+) of rhyolitic and dacitic composition can inject large quantities (>109 m3) of ejecta <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>atmosphere.</b> Another parameter controlling the amount of ash produced is {{the duration of the}} eruption: the longer the eruption is sustained, the more ash will be produced. For example, {{the second phase of the}} 2010 eruptions of Eyjafjallajökull was classified as VEI 4 despite a modest 8 km high eruption column, but the eruption continued for a month, which allowed a large volume of ash to be ejected <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>atmosphere.</b>|$|E
5|$|Pinellas County lies on a {{peninsula}} between Tampa Bay and the Gulf of Mexico, {{and much}} of the city of Tampa lies on a smaller peninsula jutting out into Tampa Bay.

The H atoms may be lost into space, while relatively fewer O atoms escape, mainly due to non-thermal processes.
