The star {{at the end of the}} <b>dipper</b> handle is Polaris. Polaris can also be found by following a line through the two stars—Alpha and Beta Ursae Majoris—that form the end of the 'bowl' of the Big <b>Dipper,</b> for 30 degrees (three upright fists at arms' length) across the night sky. The four stars constituting the bowl of the Little <b>Dipper</b> are of second, third, fourth, and fifth magnitudes, and provide an easy guide to determining what magnitude stars are visible, useful for city dwellers or testing one's eyesight.|$|E

40|$|Four dipping {{categories}} {{have been}} described, {{based on the}} night-day blood pressure ratio from 24 -h ambulatory blood pressure recordings: extreme <b>dippers</b> (night-day blood pressure ratio 1. 0). The main {{purpose of this article}} is to discuss the prognostic significance of these four dipping categories in hypertension, mainly based on a large meta-analysis of individual patient data. In hypertensive patients without cardiovascular disease at baseline and with statistical adjustment for confounders and 24 -h blood pressure, mortality was lower in extreme <b>dippers</b> than in <b>dippers,</b> whereas the incidence of cardiovascular events was higher in reverse <b>dippers.</b> The worst prognosis for reverse <b>dippers</b> was also observed in hypertensive patients with major cardiovascular disease at baseline. Higher incidences of cardiovascular events and mortality were also found in reverse <b>dippers</b> in comparison with <b>dippers</b> in a comprehensive meta-analysis of population-based studies but outcome was not significantly different between extreme <b>dippers</b> and <b>dippers.</b> Based on these findings, there appears to be little doubt that reverse dipping is associated with a worse prognosis. Some studies suggest that prognosis is similar in nondippers and extreme <b>dippers</b> in comparison with <b>dippers,</b> but other studies suggest a somewhat worse prognosis in nondippers, or a better or worse prognosis in extreme <b>dippers.</b> status: publishe...|$|R
30|$|Follow-up of {{clinical}} severity according to BP changes by NIHSS is as follows: the reverse <b>dippers</b> and extreme <b>dippers</b> had worse functional outcome after 3 [*]months (measured by mRS). This agreed with Kario et al. [29], {{who found that}} the fatal stroke incidence was significantly higher in reverse <b>dippers.</b> These results suggest that nocturnal extreme <b>dippers</b> are more liable to ischaemic strokes due to the associated cerebral hypoperfusion during the night.|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVES: We aim {{to assess}} the impact of early nocturnal blood {{pressure}} (BP) variation in the functional outcome of patients after an acute ischemic stroke. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We included consecutive stroke patients treated with intravenous thrombolysis (IVrtPA) in a tertiary stroke center. BP measurements were performed at regular intervals throughout day and night during the first 48 h after stroke onset, and subjects were divided into four dipping categories (extreme <b>dippers,</b> <b>dippers,</b> non-dippers, and reverse <b>dippers).</b> Recanalization was assessed by transcranial color-coded Doppler and/or angiographic CT. Hemorrhagic transformation was evaluated at 24 h follow-up CT scan. Functional outcome was evaluated at 3 months after stroke using the modified Rankin Scale. RESULTS: A total of 304 patients were included, mean age 72. 80 ± 11. 10 years. After 24 h of systolic BP monitoring, 30. 59 % were classified as reverse <b>dippers,</b> 39. 14 % as non-dippers, 19. 10 % as <b>dippers,</b> and 11. 18 % as extreme <b>dippers.</b> Multivariate analysis did not show an independent association of any dipping class with 3 -month functional outcome. Hemorrhagic transformation was not uniform between dipping classes: 25. 81 % for reverse <b>dippers,</b> 14. 29 % for non-dippers, 15. 52 % for <b>dippers,</b> and 5. 88 % for extreme <b>dippers,</b> P = 0. 033. CONCLUSIONS: Nocturnal BP dipping pattern is not associated with functional outcome at 3 months in acute stroke patients treated with IVrtPA. Hemorrhagic transformation was more frequent in reverse <b>dippers.</b> info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersio...|$|R
5|$|The Giant <b>Dipper</b> {{currently}} operates {{with two}} trains with six cars per train. Riders are arranged two across in two rows {{for a total}} of 24 riders per train. The trains were built by Dana Morgan from D.H. Morgan Manufacturing. When the Giant <b>Dipper</b> opened, it ran with three trains, each with ten cars. Over time, the trains have been redesigned several times with changes to the restraint system. However, they are almost unchanged since they opened. The trains have changed colors several times since the ride opened.|$|E
5|$|Andean cocks-of-the-rocks {{influence}} the environment around them. It {{was found that}} a white-capped <b>dipper</b> renovated an abandoned cock-of-the-rock nest to lay its eggs in. Cock-of-the-rocks also change the surrounding flora through seed dispersal. Seeds that the birds ingest often are found deposited around lek and nesting sites. This favours the germination and growth of those seeds. The diversity {{of these types of}} seeds {{has been found to be}} increased at lek and nests and decreased throughout the surrounding forest.|$|E
5|$|Since {{the first}} modern {{measurements}} of the precise cardinal orientations of the pyramids by Flinders Petrie, various astronomical methods have been proposed for the original establishment of these orientations. It was recently proposed that this was done by observing the positions of two stars in the Plough / Big <b>Dipper</b> which was known to Egyptians as the thigh. It is thought that a vertical alignment between these two stars checked with a plumb bob was used to ascertain where north lay. The deviations from true north using this model reflect the accepted dates of construction.|$|E
40|$|Background: It is {{well known}} that nondipping pattern of {{arterial}} hypertension has a harmful effect on target organs such as the brain, heart, and kidneys. However, it remains uncertain whether abnormal dipping patterns of nocturnal blood pressure (BP), such as extreme and re-verse dipping, influence vascular function. Methods: This study comprised consecutive 2800 individuals (1554 men and 1246 women). All were non-diabetic and had uncomplicated, untreated essential sus-tained hypertension based on office measurements. After a 2 -week wash-out period, 24 -h ambulatory BP recordings were obtained and patients were classified by their noc-turnal systolic BP fall (132 extreme <b>dippers</b> with 20 % nocturnal systolic BP fall; 1235 <b>dippers</b> with 10 % but 20 % fall; 1146 nondippers with 0 % but 10 % fall; and 287 reverse <b>dippers</b> with 0 % fall). Microalbumin, ACR (albumin/creatinine ratio), and microglobulin values were measured in all groups. Results: Extreme <b>dippers</b> did not differ from <b>dippers</b> with regard to microalbumin, microglobulin excretion, or ACR. On the contrary, reverse <b>dippers</b> had significantly (P. 0001) higher values, compared with nondippers, for microalbumin (49. 5 v 37. 2 mg/dL), microglobulin (10. 33 v 8. 71 mg/dL), ACR (104. 9 v 65. 2), and percentages of abnormal values for these parameters.

30|$|The mean daytime and night-time BP was calculated, and {{the values}} were {{analysed}} to detect the diurnal variation and whether there is nocturnal fall of BP or not. According to the percentage fall in the mean BP at night compared with that during the day, patients were classified as <b>dippers</b> (fall 10 – 20 %), extreme <b>dippers</b> (>[*] 20 %), non-dippers (<[*] 10 %) or reverse <b>dippers</b> (the mean nocturnal BP exceeded the mean daytime BP) [13].|$|R
5|$|Sports {{facilities}} also {{benefited from}} the influx of state funding. The Big <b>Dipper</b> Ice Arena, a converted airplane hangar moved from Tanacross in 1969, went through a $5 million renovation in 1981 that allowed it to host the Arctic Winter Games the next year.

40|$|Introduction: As all {{published}} {{measures of}} dependence for users of smokeless tobacco (<b>dippers)</b> have poor reliability, {{in the present}} work the Hooked on Nicotine Checklist (HONC) and the Autonomy Over Smoking Scale (AUTOS) were evaluated for use with this population. <b>Dippers</b> and smokers were also compared in relation to dependence, the pleasure derived from using tobacco and the latency to the onset of withdrawal. Methods: In 2010, an anonymous self-completed paper survey was administered to 1541 students of mixed race and ethnicity in grades 9 - 12 (mean age 15. 9 years) in a Florida high school where students used cigarettes and smokeless tobacco. Results: The reliability (Cronbach 2 ̆ 7 s alpha) for the HONC was 0. 90 for smokers (n= 139) and 0. 91 for <b>dippers</b> (n= 85), and for the AUTOS was 0. 94 for smokers and <b>dippers.</b> <b>Dippers</b> and smokers {{did not differ significantly}} in relation to scores on the HONC, AUTOS, latency to withdrawal onset or pleasure derived from smoking.

5|$|According to the Shenboo Atlas of 1933, in the 1930s {{most people}} lived within the {{perimeter}} of the Xi'an Wall but still {{there were a lot of}} unoccupied open areas. Among the visitors who came to see the Xian Wall were American captain (later general) Stilwell in 1922 and the Czech sinologist Jaroslav Průšek (1906–1980) in 1933. In 1983, the administration of the Xi'an municipality carried out more renovations and additions to the wall. At that time, the Yangmacheng tower, the Zhalou sluice tower, the Kuixinglou <b>dipper</b> tower, the Jiaolou corner tower and the Dilou defense tower were all refurbished; the crumbling parts of the rampart were changed into gates; and the moat was restored. In May 2005, all of Xi'an's ramparts were inter-connected.|$|E
5|$|Fish in the Willamette basin include 31 native species, {{among them}} cutthroat, bull, and rainbow trout, {{several species of}} salmon, sucker, minnow, sculpin, and lamprey, as well as sturgeon, stickleback, and others. Among the 29 {{non-native}} species in the basin, there are brook, brown, and lake trout, largemouth and smallmouth bass, walleye, carp, bluegill, and others. In addition to fish, the basin supports 18 species of amphibians, such as the Pacific giant salamander. Beaver and river otter are among 69 mammal species living in the watershed, also frequented by 154 bird species, such as the American <b>dipper,</b> osprey, and harlequin duck. Garter snakes are among the 15 species of reptiles found in the basin.|$|E

5|$|Many long-distance {{migrants}} {{appear to}} be genetically programmed to respond to changing day length. Species that move short distances, however, may not need such a timing mechanism, instead moving in response to local weather conditions. Thus mountain and moorland breeders, such as wallcreeper Tichodroma muraria and white-throated <b>dipper</b> Cinclus cinclus, may move only altitudinally to escape the cold higher ground. Other species such as merlin Falco columbarius and Eurasian skylark Alauda arvensis move further, to the coast or towards the south. Species like the chaffinch are much less migratory in Britain than those of continental Europe, mostly not moving more than 5km in their lives.|$|E

40|$|Our {{objective}} {{was to assess the}} prognostic significance of the night-time dipping pattern and the night-day blood pressure (BP) ratio for mortality and cardiovascular events in hypertensive patients without major cardiovascular disease at baseline. We performed a meta-analysis on individual data of 3468 patients from four prospective studies performed in Europe. Age of the subjects averaged 61 +/- 13 years; 45 % were men and 61 % were under antihypertensive treatment at the time of ambulatory BP monitoring. The night-day BP ratio and 24 -h BP averaged, respectively, 0. 907 +/- 0. 085 / 0. 866 +/- 0. 095 and 138. 1 +/- 16. 4 / 82. 3 +/- 11. 0 mmHg. Total follow-up time amounted to 23 164 patient-years. We used multivariable Cox regression analysis to assess the outcome of reverse <b>dippers,</b> non-dippers and extreme <b>dippers</b> vs <b>dippers,</b> and to assess the hazard ratios associated with 1 standard deviation higher night-day BP ratio. In comparison with <b>dippers,</b> and with adjustment for confounders and 24 -h BP, the incidence of cardiovascular events was worse in reverse <b>dippers</b> (P <= 0. 05), whereas mortality was lower in extreme <b>dippers</b> (P <= 0. 01); outcome was similar in non-dippers and <b>dippers.</b> The systolic night-day BP ratio independently predicted all-cause mortality and cardiovascular events (P <= 0. 001), which persisted after additional adjustment for 24 -h BP (P <= 0. 05); appropriate interaction terms indicated that the results were similar in men and women, in younger and older patients and in treated and untreated patients. In conclusion, the dipping pattern and the night-day BP ratio significantly and independently predict mortality and cardiovascular events in hypertensive patients without history of major cardiovascular disease, even after adjustment for 24 -h BP...|$|R
