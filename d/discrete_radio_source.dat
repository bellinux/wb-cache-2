40|$|We report {{extensive}} VLA and ATCA {{observations of}} the two diffuse <b>radio</b> <b>sources</b> in the cluster of galaxies Abell 548 b, which confirm their classification as relics. The two relics (named A and B) show similar flux density, extent, shape, polarization and spectral index and are located at projected distances of about 430 and 500 kpc from the cluster center, {{on the same side}} of the cluster's X-ray peak. On the basis of spectral indices of <b>discrete</b> <b>radio</b> <b>sources</b> embedded within the diffuse features, we have attempted to distinguish emission peaks of the diffuse sources from unrelated sources. We have found that both relics, in particular the B-relic, show possible fine structure, when observed at high resolution. Another diffuse source (named C) is detected close in projection to the cluster center. High-resolution images show that it contains two <b>discrete</b> <b>radio</b> <b>sources</b> and a diffuse component, which might be a candidate for a small relic source.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} a personal {{view of the}} discovery of radio jets in celestial <b>radio</b> <b>sources.</b> The existence of narrow, collimated optical features in distant objects has been known about since the early 20 th century; however, the advent of radio astronomy in the 1940 s and 1950 s revealed the existence {{of a large number of}} <b>discrete</b> <b>radio</b> <b>sources.</b> The realization that many of these objects were not primarily stellar or local to our own galaxy, but rather extragalactic, followed the determination of accurate radio positions, enabling identifications with optical objects. High-resolution radio interferometers found that they were often compact, and with a double lobed structure, implying outflow from a central object. Shortly afterwards, accurate techniques for the measurement of polarization were developed. However it was not until the advent of synthesis instruments in the 1970 s that radio images of the sources were produced, and the existence of radio jets firmly established and their polarization characteristics found...|$|R

40|$|We {{present the}} results of a search for new {{candidate}} radio su­pernova remnants (SNRs) in the nearby starburst irregular galaxies NGC 4214 and NGC 4395 using archived radio observations made with the Very Large Array (VLA) at the wavelengths of 3. 5 cm, 6 cm and 20 cm for NGC 4214 and 6 cm and 20 cm for NGC 4395. These observations were analyzed as part of our ongoing search for candidate radio SNRs in nearby galaxies: the goal of this search is to prepare a large sample of candidate radio SNRs for the purpose of a robust statistical study of the properties of these sources. Based on our analysis, we have confirmed the nonthermal nature of the <b>discrete</b> <b>radio</b> <b>sources</b> α and β in NGC 4214 and classify these <b>sources</b> as candidate <b>radio</b> SNRs based on their positional coincidences with HII regions in that galaxy. We have measured the flux densities of the two candidate radio SNRs at each wavelength and calculated corresponding spectral indices: we have also measured flux densities of two other <b>discrete</b> <b>radio</b> <b>sources</b> in these galaxies - ρ in NGC 4214 and # 3 in NGC 4395 which we suspect to be additional candidate radio SNRs based on their positional coincidences with other HII regions in these galaxies. However, the radio data presently available for these sources can­not confirm such a classification and additional observations are needed. We have also calculated the radio luminosities Lradio at the wavelength of 20 cm for these two candidate radio SNRs as well as the corresponding values for the minimum total energy Emin required to power these <b>radio</b> <b>sources</b> via synchrotron emission and the corresponding magnetic field strength Bmin. We have compared our mean calculated values for these properties with the mean values for populations of candidate radio SNRs in other starburst galaxies: while the values for Lradio and Bmin are roughly comparable to the values seen in other starburst galaxies, the mean value for Emin is higher than the mean value of any other starburst galaxy. Finally, we include these two candidate radio SNRs in a discussion of the Σ − D relation for extragalactic candidate radio SNRs and find that these sources are located on the shallower end of the master Σ − D relation for all extragalactic SNRs as derived by Urošević et al. (2005). ...|$|R
40|$|Context. The XMM-Newton {{survey of}} the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC) {{revealed}} 3053 X-ray sources with the majority expected to be active galactic nuclei (AGN) behind the SMC. However, the high stellar density in this field often does not allow assigning unique optical counterparts and hinders source classification. On the other hand, the association of X-ray point <b>sources</b> with <b>radio</b> emission {{can be used to}} select background AGN with high confidence, and to constrain other object classes like pulsar wind nebula. Aims. To classify X-ray and <b>radio</b> <b>sources,</b> we use clear correlations of X-ray sources found in the XMM-Newton survey with radio-continuum sources detected with ATCA and MOST. Methods. Deep radio-continuum images were searched for correlations with X-ray sources of the XMM-Newton SMC-survey point-source catalogue as well as galaxy clusters seen with extended X-ray emission. Results. Eighty eight <b>discrete</b> <b>radio</b> <b>sources</b> were found in common with the X-ray point-source catalogue in addition to six correlations with extended X-ray sources.

Each of the [O III] 4959, 5007 doublets and Hbeta can be well modelled by two Gaussians and the line ratio, [O III] 5007 /Hbeta ~ 7, is typical of Seyfert 2 galaxies.

The instrument is a 2 -element interferometer operating at 33 GHz with a ~ 3 GHz bandwidth. It is installed on the high and dry Teide Observatory site on Tenerife where successful beam-switching observations have been made at this frequency. Two realizations of the interferometer have been tested with element separations of 11. 9 lambda and 16. 7 lambda. The resulting angular resolution of ~ 2 deg was chosen to explore the amplitude of CMB structure on the large angular scale side of the Doppler (acoustic) peak. It is found that observations are unaffected by water vapour for more than 70 per cent {{of the time when}} the sensitivity is limited by the receiver noise alone. Observations over several months are expected to give an rms noise level of ~ 10 - 20 micro K covering ~ 100 resolution elements.

40|$|Abstract. We have searched 92 {{unidentified}} {{sources from}} the FIRST and NVSS radio catalogs for pulsations at 610 MHz. The selected sources are bright, have no identifications, are unresolved and have significant linear polarization. Our search was sensitive to sub-millisecond pulsations from pulsars {{with a large}} range of dispersion measures. We have detected no radio pulsations from these sources and conclude that {{they are unlikely to}} be a population of previously undetected pulsars. The FIRST and NVSS surveys are recent 1400 MHz VLA radio surveys of the Northern sky.

40|$|Restricted Access. The Australia Telescope {{antenna array}} {{has been used}} in an ultracompact {{configuration}} to image an ~ 8 arcmin diameter field with an angular resolution of about 2 arcmin and an rms brightness sensitivity of about 36 microK. Interferometer spacings which responded to an independent and higher range of spatial frequencies were used to model and subtract the confusion due to the <b>discrete</b> <b>radio</b> <b>sources</b> in the field with smaller angular sizes. As a result, the sensitivity in the imaging was reduced well below the telescope confusion limit. The residual image was examined for fluctuations above the instrument thermal noise that could be due to any arcmin-scale anisotropy in the cosmic microwave background. No excess fluctuations were detected, and we derive a 95 per cent confidence upper limit of 22 microJy beam^- 1 ^ on the rms flux density fluctuations in the background sky at 8. 7 GHz with an angular scale of 2 arcmin.

40|$|According to {{the cosmological}} principle, the Universe should appear isotropic, without any {{preferred}} directions, to an observer whom we may {{consider to be}} fixed in the co-moving co-ordinate system of the expanding Universe. Such an observer is stationary {{with respect to the}} average distribution of the matter in the Universe and the sky brightness at any frequency should appear uniform in all directions to such an observer. However a peculiar motion of such an observer, due to a combined effect of Doppler boosting and aberration, will introduce a dipole anisotropy in the observed sky brightness; in reverse an observed dipole anisotropy in the sky brightness could be used to infer the peculiar velocity of the observer with respect to the average Universe. We determine the peculiar velocity of the solar system relative to the frame of distant <b>radio</b> <b>sources,</b> by studying the anisotropy in the sky brightness from <b>discrete</b> <b>radio</b> <b>sources,</b> i. e., an integrated emission from discrete sources per unit solid angle. Our results give a direction of the velocity vector in agreement with the Cosmic Microwave Background Radiation (CMBR) value, but the magnitude (∼ 1600 ± 400 km/s) is ∼ 4 times the CMBR value (369 ± 1 km/s) at a statistically significant (∼ 3 σ) level. A genuine difference between the two dipoles would imply anisotropic Universe, with the anisotropy changing with the epoch. This would violate the cosmological principle where the isotropy of the Universe is assumed for all epochs, and on which the whole modern cosmology is based upon.

Inspired by the innovative and highly-successful E-W and N-S solar grating arrays that he constructed at Potts Hill (Sydney) in the early 1950 s, Christiansen sited the Chris Cross at the Division’s Fleurs field station near Sydney, and from 1957 to 1988 it provided two-dimensional maps of solar radio emission at 1423 MHz. In 1960 an 18 m parabolic antenna was installed adjacent to the Chris Cross array, and when used with the Chris Cross formed the Southern Hemisphere's first high-resolution compound interferometer. A survey of <b>discrete</b> <b>radio</b> <b>sources</b> was carried out with this radio telescope.

At 1720 MHz we detect six features above the 5 -sigma limit set by noise, four in emission and two in absorption. Three of the emission features appear closely associated with known <b>discrete</b> continuum <b>radio</b> <b>sources,</b> {{and one of the}} absorption features is precisely coincident with the discrete continuum source 44. 01 + 59. 6.

We re-observed the sample using the Australia Telescope Compact Array (ATCA) in full polarization, with 6 GHz of densely sampled frequency coverage spanning 1. 3 to 10 GHz. We have devised a general polarization modelling technique that allows us to identify multiple polarized emission components in a source, and to characterize their properties. We detect Faraday complex behaviour in almost every source in our sample. Several sources exhibit particularly remarkable polarization behaviour. By comparing our new and archival data, we have identified temporal variability in the broadband integrated polarization spectra of some sources. In a number of cases, the characteristics of the polarized emission components, including the range of Faraday depths over which they emit, their temporal variability, spectral index, and the linear extent of the source, allow us to argue that the spectropolarimetric data encodes information about the magnetoionic environment of active galactic nuclei themselves. Furthermore, the data place direct constraints on the geometry and magnetoionic structure of this material. We discuss the consequences of restricted frequency bands on the detection and interpretation of polarization structures, and implications for upcoming spectropolarimetric surveys.

In this paper we analyze the impact that the SKA will have on Galactic studies, starting from the immense legacy value of the all-sky survey proposed by the continuum SWG but also presenting some areas of Galactic Science that particularly benefit from SKA observations both surveys and pointed. The planned all-sky survey will be characterized by unique spatial resolution, sensitivity and survey speed, providing us with a wide-field atlas of the Galactic continuum emission. Synergies with existing, current and planned radio Galactic Plane surveys will be discussed.

Coherent emission events like Cyclotron Maser in the magnetospheres of different classes of stars can be detected. Pointed, deep observations will allow new insights into the physics of the coronae and plasma processes in active stellar systems and single stars, enabling the detection of flaring activity in larger stellar population for a better comprehension of the mechanism of energy release in the atmospheres of stars with different masses and age.
