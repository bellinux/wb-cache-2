500|$|Newton {{undertook}} {{the first}} of his fifty-two operational sorties on 1January 1943, under the leadership of his commanding officer, Squadron Leader Keith Hampshire. During February, Newton flew low-level missions through monsoon conditions and hazardous mountain terrain, attacking Japanese forces ranged against Allied troops in the Morobe province. In early March, he took part in the Battle of the Bismarck Sea, one of the key engagements in the South West Pacific theatre, bombing and strafing Lae airfield to prevent its force of enemy fighters taking off to intercept Allied aircraft attacking the Japanese fleet. Newton gained a reputation for driving straight at his targets without <b>evasive</b> <b>manoeuvre,</b> and always leaving them in flames; this earned him the nickname [...] "The Firebug". The Japanese gunners, however, reportedly knew him as [...] "Blue Cap", from his habit of wearing an old blue cricket cap on operations. In spite of the hazards of the air war in New Guinea, he was quoted as saying, [...] "The troops on the ground should get two medals each, before any airman gets one".|$|E
2500|$|The {{tail section}} of the {{aircraft}} was redesigned as well. The rudder was slightly reduced in area and the symmetrical fin section changed to an airfoil shape, producing a sideways lift force that swung the tail slightly to the left. This helped increase {{the effectiveness of the}} rudder, and reduced the need for application of right rudder on takeoff to counteract torque effects from the engine and propeller. The conspicuous bracing struts were removed from the horizontal tailplanes which were relocated to slightly below and forward of their original positions. A semi-retractable tailwheel was fitted and the main undercarriage legs were raked forward by six degrees to improve the ground handling. An unexpected structural flaw of the wing and tail section was revealed when the first F-1s were rushed into service; some aircraft crashed or nearly crashed, with either the wing surface wrinkling or fracturing, or by the tail structure failing. In one such accident, the commander of JG 2 [...] "Richthofen", Wilhelm Balthasar, lost his life when he was attacked by a Spitfire during a test flight. While making an <b>evasive</b> <b>manoeuvre,</b> the wings broke away and Balthasar was killed when his aircraft hit the ground. Slightly thicker wing skins and reinforced spars dealt with the wing problems. Tests were also carried out to find out why the tails had failed, and it was found that at certain engine settings a high-frequency oscillation in the tailplane spar was overlapped by harmonic vibrations from the engine; the combined effect being enough to cause structural failure at the rear fuselage/fin attachment point. Initially, two external stiffening plates were screwed onto the outer fuselage on each side, and later the entire structure was reinforced.|$|E

40|$|We {{investigated}} after {{effects of}} automation in take-over scenarios in a high-end moving-base driving simulator. Drivers performed <b>evasive</b> <b>manoeuvres</b> encountering a blocked lane in highway driving. We compared {{the performance of}} drivers 1) during manual driving, 2) after automated driving with {{eyes on the road}} while performing the cognitively demanding n-back task, and 3) after automated driving with eyes off the road performing the visually demanding SuRT task. Both minimum time to collision (TTC) and minimum clearance towards the obstacle disclosed a substantial number of near miss events and are regarded as valuable surrogate safety metrics in <b>evasive</b> <b>manoeuvres.</b> TTC proved highly sensitive to the applied definition of colliding paths, and we prefer robust solutions using lane position while disregarding heading. The extended time to collision (ETTC) which takes into account acceleration was close to the more robust conventional TTC. In line with other publications, the initial steering or braking intervention was delayed after using automation compared to manual driving. This resulted in lower TTC values and stronger steering and braking actions. Using automation, effects of cognitive distraction were similar to visual distraction for the intervention time with effects on the surrogate safety metric TTC being larger with visual distraction. However the precision of the <b>evasive</b> <b>manoeuvres</b> was hardly affected with a similar clearance towards the obstacle, similar overshoots and similar excursions to the hard shoulder. Further research is needed to validate and complement the current simulator based results with human behaviour in real world driving conditions. Experiments with real vehicles can disclose possible systematic differences in behaviour, and naturalistic data can serve to validate surrogate safety measures like TTC and obstacle clearance in <b>evasive</b> <b>manoeuvres.</b> </p...|$|R

50|$|The Spanish ships couldn't {{maintain}} the battle {{order for a}} long time. Many of them cut spring ropes and left the line without order. Three Spanish frigates were burnt due to a French fireship attack. Two Spanish galleys were destroyed by artillery fire with Admiral de Villaroel killed. When Spanish resistance {{on the right side}} of the line collapsed, the French attacked the left side and centre consisting of the Dutch ships mostly with all their force. The Spanish flagship, 70-gun Nuestra Señora del Pilar, was attacked by four French fireships, caught fire and exploded with 200 sailors and both Admirals, de Ibarra and de La Cerda, killed. The majority of Dutch losses could be attributed to another successful French fireship attack on 68-gun Steenbergen which collided with two other Dutch ships, 50-gun Vrijheid and 36-gun Leiden, in a failed <b>evasive</b> <b>manoeuvre.</b> All three Dutch ships caught fire and exploded, though most of their crews escaped successfully. Rear Admiral van Middelandt was killed on board Steenbergen. The Dutch continued to resist though. Vice Admiral den Haen was killed by a cannonball while commanding his flagship, 76-gun Gouda. With all Dutch and Spanish admirals killed, a flag officer of late de Ruyter, Captain Callenburgh of 76-gun Eendracht, assumed general command. One of Spanish coastal batteries exploded and the town caught fire. The Dutch and Spanish were in a dire position, though the French lost all their fireships by this time and Vivonne ordered a return to Messina.|$|E

Attacked by three Messerschmitt Bf 109 fighters he dived his twin engine bomber in an <b>evasive</b> <b>manoeuvre</b> and at high speed clipped the top of a tree but managed to retain control. Quickly caught by the three Luftwaffe fighters his own aircraft was machine gunned although he did manage to escape and back at base 237 bullet holes were counted. Ten days later the squadron returned to England its airmen exhausted. The squadrons of Bristol Blenheim and Fairey Battle light bombers had been almost wiped out in ten days, the majority of their airmen killed in action.Very shortly after their return Hayter was assigned to fly a military officer into one of the last remaining airfields accessible to British forces in France, he carried plans for the evacuation of troops from that region and his mission was vital. Hayter managed to land avoiding multiple bomb craters, took cover in a ditch as the airfield was attacked and once the officer had delivered his package, he brought him back to England. a feat earning him a Mention in Despatches.On 24 June 1940 he was transferred temporarily to RAF Coastal Command in Scotland but about 4 weeks later while awaiting permission to take off his Bristol Blenheim was struck by a Vickers Wellington which crippled his observer and destroyed his aircraft. He was promoted to flying officer on 6 November 1940. His attachment was uneventful after that and over the winter of 1940/41 he converted to fly the Vickers Wellington heavy bomber on which he returned to operational flying in raids on 18 March 1941 against an oil terminal in the Netherlands and 27 March 1941 against the German target Cologne before bombing Berlin on 9 April 1941.|$|E

40|$|The {{present report}} {{describes}} the conceptual {{design of a}} system supporting <b>evasive</b> flight <b>manoeuvres</b> to prevent encounters of hazardous small scale atmospheric phenomena. These <b>evasive</b> <b>manoeuvres</b> may be performed manually by the pilot or automatically by the flight control system. In both cases situational awareness of the pilots is a key issue. The system is intended as a safety net i. e. primarily to improve the existing level of safety. Although its principles can be readily applied to further phenomena such as local turbulence fields, emphasis is on wake vortices and the system is named "Wake Encounter Advisory and Avoidance" (WEAA) accordingly. The motivation for an avoidance system is explained and airspace and operational restraints are described. Further requirements are given for sensor measurements and a safe operation of such an evasion system. Based on these requirements a functional system architecture is developed and the inputs, outputs and functions of the subsystems are specified. This architecture is compatibe with but not tailored to current airliner flight guidance and control systems. The report gives a general overview of the intended system design; its functional elements will be investigated in more detail in dedicated studies and eventually a feasibility demonstration and a benefit analysis of the whole system are planned. This report has been elaborated in the DLR project "Wetter & Fliegen" (weather and flying) to describe the initial findings of work package F 2. 7 "Taktische Ausweichmanöver" (Tactical <b>evasive</b> <b>manoeuvres).</b> Work partially builds on results achieved in the 6 th FP EC project FLYSAFE...|$|R

40|$|Abstract To {{understand}} {{performance of}} evasive and interceptive actions {{it is important}} to know how people decide when to initiate a movement—initiating at the ‘right ’ moment is often essential for successful perfor-mance.

Candidate quantities include time-to-collision (TTC), distance, and rate of image expansion (ROE), all of which have received empirical support. We studied initiation of an <b>evasive</b> <b>manoeuvre</b> in a computer-simulated steering task in which the observer was required to steer through a stationary visual environment and avoid colliding with an obstacle in their path. The results could not be explained by hypotheses which propose that <b>evasive</b> <b>manoeuvre</b> initiation is based on a fixed criterion value of TTC or distance.

40|$|The {{current study}} aims to obtain {{knowledge}} {{about the nature of}} the processes involved in Hazard Perception, using measurement techniques to separate and independently quantify these suspected sub-processes: Sensation, Situation Awareness (recognition, location and projection) and Decision-Making. It applies Signal Detection Theory analysis to Hazard Perception and Prediction Tasks. To enable the calculation of Signal Detection Theory parameters, video-recorded hazardous vs. quasi-hazardous situations were presented to the participants. In the hazardous situations it is necessary to perform an evasive action, for instance, braking or swerving abruptly, while the quasi-hazardous situations do not require the driver to make any <b>evasive</b> <b>manoeuvre,</b> merely to carry on driving at the same speed and following the same trajectory. A first Multiple Choice Hazard Perception and Prediction test was created to measure participants’ performance in a What Happens Next? Task. The sample comprised 143 participants, 47 females and 94 males. Groups of non-offender drivers (learner, novice and experienced) and offender drivers (novice and experienced) were recruited. The Multiple Choice Hazard Perception and Prediction test succeeded in finding differences between drivers according to their driving experience. In fact, differences exist with regard to the level of hazard discrimination (d’ prime) by drivers with different experience (learner, novice and experienced drivers) and profile (offenders and non-offenders) and these differences emerge from Signal Detection Theory analysis. In addition, it was found that experienced drivers show higher Situation Awareness than learner or novice drivers. On the other hand, although offenders do worse than non-offenders on the hazard identification question, they do just as well when their Situation Awareness is probed (in fact, they are as aware as non-offenders of what the obstacles on the road are, where they are and what will happen next). Nevertheless, when considering the answers participants provided about their degree of cautiousness, experienced drivers were more cautious than novice drivers, and non-offender drivers were more cautious than offender drivers. That is, a greater number of experienced and non-offender drivers chose the answer “I would make an <b>evasive</b> <b>manoeuvre</b> such as braking gradually”...|$|E

The study is performed by modelling the causation factor for a ship-to-ship collision scenario. The assessment is provided in terms of the probability distribution of the time required to the officer on the watch (OOW) to complete a foreseen procedure aimed at avoiding a collision with another ship. The time needed to identify and agree the <b>evasive</b> <b>manoeuvre</b> with the second ship is evaluated for the two layouts, considering also a probabilistic occurrence of disturbances distracting and delaying the OOW during the procedure. Bayesian networks are employed to model the scenario. A general increment of the reactivity of the OOW in the integrated bridge is seen, represented by a shorter time to complete the procedure and by a reduced probability of being interrupted. The overall effect is an increase in the time available to put into practice the manoeuvre itself and, eventually, to avoid the collision...|$|E
