25|$|Many {{potential}} uses of MOFs exist beyond hydrogen storage, such as <b>gas</b> <b>purification,</b> gas separation, {{gas storage}} (other than hydrogen), and heterogeneous catalysis. MOFs are promising for <b>gas</b> <b>purification</b> because of strong chemisorption {{that takes place}} between electron-rich, odor-generating molecules (such as amines, phosphines, oxygenates, alcohols, water, or sulfur-containing molecules) and the framework, allowing the desired gas {{to pass through the}} MOF. Gas separation can be performed with MOFs because they can allow certain molecules to pass through their pores based on size and kinetic diameter. This is particularly important for separating out carbon dioxide. Regarding gas storage, MOFs can store molecules such as carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, methane, and oxygen due to their high adsorption enthalpies (similar to hydrogen). In principle, these same MOFs could also be used for catalysis because of their shape and size selectivity and their accessible bulk volume. Also, because of their very porous architecture, mass transport in the pores is not hindered. MOF Technologies Limited a company based in Belfast, United Kingdom are the largest manufacturing company for MOFs.|$|E

This paper deals with damaging of the O-element pipe designed to remove sulphur from the flue gases, i. e. damaging of the pipe during flue <b>gases</b> <b>purification.</b> This purification is conducted by spraying the water into the O-shaped pipe where the flue gases flow. Thus the sulphur binds itself onto the water and gets removed from the flue gas. Injection of cold water into hot flue gases, however, causes high stress {{on the inside of the}} pipe, which can gradually damage the O-element pipe. In this paper initial injection of water into hot pipe all the way to stabilization of temperature fields will be analyzed and the most dangerous places which shall be considered for fatigue will be determined...|$|R

The process is realized in a three-zone column. In the upper zone a physical absorption in gas-liquid drops system is realized and the big convective transfer in the gas phase leads to a decrease of the mass transfer resistances in this phase. In the middle zone a chemical absorption in liquid-gas bubbles system takes place and the big convective transfer in the liquid phase leads to a decrease of the mass transfer resistances in this phase. The large volume of the liquid in the middle zone causes an increase of the chemical reaction time {{and as a result}} a further decrease of the mass transfer resistances in the liquid phases is realized. The third zone is the column tank, where the chemical reaction takes place only...|$|R
40|$|A {{growing demand}} for {{efficient}} air quality management calls {{for the development of}} technologies capable of meeting the stringent requirements now being applied in areas of chemical, biological and medical activities. Currently, filtration is the most effective process available for removal of fine particles from carrier <b>gases.</b> <b>Purification</b> of gaseous pollutants is associated with adsorption, absorption and incineration. In this paper we discuss a new technique for highly efficient simultaneous purification of gaseous and particulate pollutants from carrier gases, and investigate the utilization of Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) imaging {{for the study of the}} dynamic processes associated with gas-liquid flow in porous media. Our technique involves the passage of contaminated carrier gases through a porous medium submerged into a liquid, leading to the formation of narrow and tortuous pathways through the medium. The wet walls of these pathways result in outstanding purification of gaseous, liquid and solid alien additives. NMR imaging was successfully used to map the gas pathways inside the porous medium submerged into the liquid layer. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R

40|$|Many {{compounds}} {{of organic}} hydrocarbons (VOC) and several metals {{can be detected}} in gaseous emissions from biological treatment of MSW. Inventory analysis was done by {{a wide range of}} sampling and analytical methods (screening GC, HPLC, ICP). According to an evaluation scheme laid down in the federal Technical Instruction on Air (TA Luft), organic compounds are divided into three categories depending on their environmental hazard. About 1 - 2 % of the VOC are either carcinogenic/mutagenic or particularly toxic, about 40 % show medium toxicity, and about 60 % show low toxicity. Only a minor part of these substances is contained in waste; the majority of the organic components including methan derive from biogenic sources. 14 harmfull elements were detected in the waste gas.
