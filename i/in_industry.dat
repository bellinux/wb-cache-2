Thus, greater public firm presence <b>in</b> an <b>industry</b> should reduce uncertainty <b>in</b> that <b>industry.</b> Following the theoretical prediction of investment under uncertainty, we hypothesize and find that private firms are more responsive to their investment opportunities when they operate <b>in</b> <b>industries</b> with greater public firm presence. Further, we find that the effect of public firm presence is greater <b>in</b> <b>industries</b> with better information quality and <b>in</b> <b>industries</b> characterized by a greater degree of investment irreversibility. Our results suggest that public firms generate positive externalities by reducing industry uncertainty and facilitating more efficient private firm investment.

5|$|In {{response}} to the Great Depression, successive governments pursued a strategy designed to transform Argentina into a country self-sufficient <b>in</b> <b>industry</b> as well as agriculture. The strategy of growth was based on import substitution in which tariffs and quotas for final goods were raised. The import-substitution process had progressively been adopted since the late 19th century, but the Great Depression intensified it. The government's encouragement of industrial growth diverted investment from agriculture, and agricultural production fell dramatically.|$|E
