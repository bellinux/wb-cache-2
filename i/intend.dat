3000|$|The second {{objection}} to the cancellability of explicatures relies {{on the fact that}} explicatures are <b>intended</b> by the speaker and recognized as <b>intended</b> by the hearer. Since an intention implemented in an act of utterance cannot be unimplemented, there is no way out for the speaker who is committed to the proposition explicitly communicated by her utterance (see Burton-Roberts 2010 : 138). Consider once again (8 a) where the speaker conveys the explicature that Karen is ready to leave for the airport. Given that this explicature is <b>intended</b> by the speaker and recognized as <b>intended</b> by the hearer, it cannot be cancelled without giving rise to contradiction; <b>intending</b> to convey X and <b>intending</b> to convey not-X results in a contradiction. Either the speaker <b>intends</b> to convey X or she <b>intends</b> to convey not-X, but not both. 7 [...]...|$|R

40|$|How do {{developers}} and designers {{of a new}} technology make sense of <b>intended</b> users? The critical groundwork for user-centred technology development begins not by involving actual users' exposure to the technological artefact but much earlier, with designers' and developers' vision of future users. Thus, anticipating <b>intended</b> users is critical to technology uptake. We conceptualise the anticipation of <b>intended</b> users {{as a form of}} prospective sensemaking in technology development. Employing a narrative analytical approach and drawing on four key communities in the development of Grid computing, we reconstruct how each community anticipated the <b>intended</b> Grid user. Based on our findings, we conceptualise user anticipation in Terms of two key dimensions, namely the <b>intended</b> possibility to inscribe user needs into the technological artefact as well as the <b>intended</b> scope of the application domain. In turn, these dimensions allow us to develop an initial typology of <b>intended</b> user concepts that in turn might provide a key building block towards a generic typology of <b>intended</b> users...|$|R

Plutarch writes that Spartacus merely wished to escape northwards into Cisalpine Gaul and disperse his men back to their homes.|$|E
