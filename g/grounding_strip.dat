40|$|A {{new version}} of {{coplanar}} waveguide (CPW) with electrically narrow <b>ground</b> <b>strips</b> 14 has been developed for microwave integrated circuits. This transmission line, referred to by Finite Ground Coplanar (FGC) waveguide, has several advantages over conventional coplanar waveguide. Since the <b>ground</b> <b>strips</b> are narrow, parasitic resonances that develop when the CPW is placed on a carrier or in a package are eliminated. In addition, the narrow <b>ground</b> <b>strips</b> permit the integration of lumped and distributed circuit elements in the <b>ground</b> <b>strips</b> {{as well as in}} the center strip to reduce the circuit size and improve its performance. Finally, the coupling between adjacent FGC transmission lines is lower than the coupling between CPW lines for the same spacing between the lines. All of these attributes of FGC are presented in this paper...|$|R

The antenna {{consists of an}} inverted L-shaped feeding <b>strip,</b> a shorter <b>grounded</b> <b>strip,</b> and a longer <b>grounded</b> <b>strip</b> which is connected with four inductors by using a single-pole four-throw RF switch.

40|$|Abstract—The etching error causes serious {{frequency}} drift of a microstrip stepped-impedance resonator (SIR). This paper proposes a novel microstrip quarter-wave SIR structure, which is insensitive to fabrication tolerances. Inserting several <b>ground</b> <b>strips</b> in the low-impedance {{section of the}} resonator keeps the impedance ratio almost constant in spite of inaccurate fabrication. As an additional benefit, the resonator size would be miniaturized because the characteristic impedance of the microstrip line in the low-impedance section is mainly controlled by the signal strips and the inserted <b>ground</b> <b>strips</b> in a coplanar manner. The concepts and characteristics of this modified resonator structure are discussed in detail. The filters constructed by the conventional microstrip SIR were also designed and fabricated at the same frequency band to compare with the proposed ones. Measured results show that each proposed filter has compact size, wide stopband, and high tolerance to fabrication errors. Two four-pole cross-coupled filters were designed and fabricated to demonstrate the feasibility.
