To address this problem, two-dimensional (2 D) computational models were developed using the finite element analysis (FEA) software DEFORM and validated with experiments.

30|$|In most welding processes, the {{materials}} are generally joined by reducing the resistance to deformation by supplying the required amount {{of energy in the}} form of heat. However, the heat supplied tends to create conditions that cause microstructural changes such as recrystallisation, grain orientation growth, and coarsening or dissolution of the strengthening precipitates. Such microstructural changes occur at different temperatures for different materials and are dependent upon the chemical composition of {{the materials}} involved. Therefore, depending upon the chemical composition of the material, the processing conditions can be termed either ‘very hot’ or ‘very cold’ processing (Schneider et al. 2006). Friction-stir welding is still susceptible to flaw formation because it lacks the potential for imbalances between the distinct processing zones. Defects such as non-bonding or void formation can occur at very cold welding conditions, due to insufficient material flow, and flaws such as <b>flash</b> <b>formation,</b> collapse of the nugget within the stir zone and deterioration in the strength properties of the joint can occur at very hot conditions, due to excessive material flow (Annette 2007). In addition to these flow related defects, other geometry related defects also exist, such as lack of penetration and lack of joining, which mainly occur due to operator errors.|$|E

40|$|Climate and {{orography}} in the Mediterranean region tend {{to promote}} intense rainfalls, particularly in autumn. Storms often hit steep catchments and flood quickness only let {{a very short}} time lapse for forecasts. Peak flow intensity depends on the great variability of rainfalls and catchment characteristics. As a matter of facts, observation networks are not adapted to these small space-time scales and event severity often affects data reliability when they exist thus the notion of ungauged catchment emerges. Regionalization in hydrology seeks to determine hydrological variables at locations where these data lack. This work contributes to pose the bases of a methodology adapted to transpose parameterizations of a flash flood dedicated distributed hydrologic model from gauged catchments to ungauged ones, and for a large study area. The MARINE distributed hydrologic model is used (Roux et al. 2011), its originality lies in the automatically differentiated adjoint model able to perform calibrations and spatial-temporal sensitivity analysis, in order to improve understanding in flash flood generating mechanisms and real time data assimilation for hydrometeorological forecasts. The first step for MARINE model regionalization is sensitivity analysis which addresses the question of physical process understanding. A large panel of hydrologic behaviours is explored. General catchment behaviours are highlighted for the study area (Garambois, Larnier, et al. 2013). Selected flood events and a multiple events calibration technique help to extract catchment parameter sets. Those parameterizations are tested on validation events and ensemble predictions are performed for a recent flood event. A variance decomposition method leads to parameter temporal sensitivity analysis. It enables better understanding in catching dynamics of physical processes involved in <b>flash</b> floods <b>formation</b> (Garambois, Roux, et al. 2013). Parameterizations are then transferred from gauged catchments with hydrologic similarity to ungauged ones with a view to develop real time flood forecasting...|$|R
40|$|AbstractWe {{have studied}} the {{electron}} and proton transfer at the manganese-depleted catalytic site of water oxidation {{in the presence of}} the electron donor 1, 5 -diphenylcarbazide (DPC). On the basis of measurements of flash-induced fluorescence yield, electrochromic bandshifts and pH transients into the aqueous medium, we have been led to the following conclusions: (1) The electron donor DPC was involved in a two sequential photostep process just like Mn 2 + in photoactivation. After a first flash, the product of the reaction of DPC with the first Photosystem II charge separation was unstable (half-decay around 1 s at pH 6. 5) until converted into a stable one by a second <b>flash.</b> The <b>formation</b> of the unstable intermediate was rather favored at alkaline pH. Its concentration increased progressively with pH to reach a maximum at pH 7. 2 – 7. 4. Nevertheless, consumption of this intermediate required a proton binding, since its regeneration after the second flash needed a latency dark time inversely proportional to proton concentration. (2) Each step of the process was accompanied by proton exchange with the medium. At acidic pH, the odd flashes in a series induced acidification, whereas on even flashes occurred alkalinization. The pattern of proton release/uptake varied extremely as a function of pH, between 4 H+ and − 2 H+/e−, with opposite changes at acidic and basic pH. At neutral pH, 1 H+/e− was assumed to be released at each step. On the basis of these results and data already in the literature, the molecular details of the pH-dependent part of the deprotonation are discussed in terms of electrostatic interactions between the polarized catalytic center and bound H+ and OH− ions. The described two-photostep process is proposed to reflect the two-electron water oxidation to an hydrogen peroxide intermediate...|$|R
40|$|Friction stir welding (FSW) {{has been}} at the {{forefront}} for welding aluminum alloys for both aerospace and automotive applications. Achieving good weld strength devoid of defects is very important for industrial applications of this process. The process parameters play a pivotal role in achieving a good weld joint. Understanding the differences in welding defects and preventing them cannot be explained only by experimentation. Thus, {{there is a need for}} developing a numerical model to explain the physics of the FSW process and explain the effect of process parameters on the defect formation mechanism. ^ The finite element (FE) model developed in this thesis helps not only in understanding the dynamics of the friction stir welding process; but also gives a bird’s eye view during the formation of the weld under different processing conditions. Based on the observations made using the FE model, a methodology has been proposed to counter the defects formed during FSW; by accurately adjusting the process parameters. ^ The finite element model is first validated with the experimental data and then is used to understand the formation of defects like cavities, groove-like defects, tunnel defects and excess <b>flash</b> <b>formation</b> during the FSW process.

40|$|The {{material}} {{flow in the}} combined extrusion/forging process is an important phenomenon which controls the mechanical and metallurgical properties of any manufactured component. Collet chuck holder is a tool holding device used in different types of CNC milling machines. The chuck holder is described by a flange at the middle {{to fit into the}} machine, taper portion which is conical shaped area present at the bottom which enters the spindle for changing holder and collet pocket which fits the collet for holding the cutting tool. For manufacturing the tool holder an enormous amount of material is being wasted by the machining process which is almost equal to the volume of the product. Some manufacturer use casting, subsequently by machining to get the final shape. Both the used processes have their limitations as discussed earlier. To secure our material resources and to get better mechanical properties it is proposed to adopt the combined extrusion/forging and/or multi-stage processes for the production of different types of collet chuck holders. In general, it is found challenging to predict the metal flow by 3 D combined extrusion/forging process of complicated sections, collet chuck holder in particular, due to its complexity nature of analysis. From experiments it is observed that the complete process to get the first three components can be assumed to compose of four stages and fourth one of two stages with regard to forward/backward extrusion, forging, die corner filling, and <b>flash</b> <b>formation.</b> The mechanical, microscopic, micro hardness and residual stress analyses are performed for all the four components manufactured under different frictional conditions and ram velocities.

The identity of the purified plastocyanins was verified by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry. The formation of a complex between authentic or mutant spinach plastocyanin and isolated photosystem I and the electron transfer has been studied from the biphasic reduction kinetics of P 700 + after excitation with laser <b>flashes.</b> The <b>formation</b> of the complex was abolished by the bulky hydrophobic group of Leu at the respective position of G 10 or A 90 which are part of the conserved flat hydrophobic surface around the copper ligand H 87. The rate of electron transfer decreased by both mutations to < 20 % of that found with wildtype plastocyanin. We conclude that the conserved flat surface of plastocyanin represents one of two crucial structural elements for both the docking at photosystem I and the efficient electron transfer via H 87 to P 700 +. The Y 83 L mutant exhibited faster electron transfer to P 700 + than did authentic plastocyanin. This proves that Y 83 is not involved in electron transfer to P 700 and suggests that electron transfer from cytochrome f and to P 700 follows different routes in the plastocyanin molecule.

We study the outflows and jets from these systems to understand the contributions the circumstellar and circumbinary discs have on the efficiency and morphology of the outflow. In the single star and tight binary case we obtain {{a single pair of}} jets launched from the system, while in the wide binary case two pairs of jets are observed. This implies that in the tight binary case the contribution of the circumbinary disc on the outflow is greater than that in the wide binary case. We also find that the single star case is the most efficient at transporting mass, linear and angular momentum from the system, while the wide binary case is less efficient (∼ 50 %, ∼ 33 %, ∼ 42 % of the respective quantities in the single star case). The tight binary's efficiency falls between the other two cases (∼ 71 %, ∼ 66 %, ∼ 87 % of the respective quantities in the single star case). By studying the magnetic field structure we deduce that the outflows in the single star and tight binary star case are magnetocentrifugally driven, whereas in the wide binary star case the outflows are driven by a magnetic pressure gradient.

40|$|We {{implemented}} sink {{particles in}} the adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) hydrodynamics code FLASH. Sink particles are created in regions of local gravitational collapse, and their trajectories and accretion can be followed over many dynamical times. We perform {{a series of tests}} including the time integration of circular and elliptical orbits, the collapse of a Bonnor-Ebert sphere and a rotating, fragmenting cloud core. We compare the collapse of a highly unstable singular isothermal sphere to the theory by Shu (1977), and show that the sink particle accretion rate is in excellent agreement with the theoretical prediction. To model eccentric orbits and close encounters of sink particles accurately, we show that a very small timestep is often required, for which we implemented subcycling of the N-body system. We emphasize that a sole density threshold for sink particle creation is insufficient in supersonic flows, if the density threshold is below the opacity limit. In that case, the density can exceed the threshold in strong shocks that do not necessarily lead to local collapse. Additional checks for bound state, gravitational potential minimum, Jeans instability and converging flows are absolutely necessary for a meaningful creation of sink particles. We apply our new sink particle module for <b>FLASH</b> to the <b>formation</b> of a stellar cluster, and compare to a smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) code with sink particles. Our comparison shows encouraging agreement of gas properties, indicated by column density distributions and radial profiles, and of sink particle formation times and positions.

40|$|Creep {{degradation}} of steam carrying {{vessels in the}} power generation industry is a concern {{that needs to be}} constantly monitored. The Weldcore® process has been earmarked as a potential method of creep sampling which will allow for thick-walled sections to be analysed. A component of the process involves plugging the resultant hole after removing a creep sample using a novel welding technique called friction hydro pillar processing. At the commencement of this study, insufficient data was available to warrant safe industrial application of the process. This research was conducted to evaluate the performance of 10 CrMo 910 friction hydro pillar process welds. The effects of downward force, stud taper angle, hole taper angle and hole base diameter on process response, defect population, static properties and dynamic performance were evaluated. The variation of downward force showed that higher forces produce significantly smaller defects and higher fatigue life. The occurrence of defects was linked to process parameters and geometry thereby identifying the correct parameters for safe use in the power generation industry. <b>Flash</b> <b>formation</b> was identified as an early indicator of weld defects and can assist with quality control in industrial applications. Methods of standardising the plunge depth and forge force were developed to identify the correct magnitudes for different geometries, without the need for testing. Defects were shown to populate specific regions of the weld and produce variations in fatigue life. Crack initiation sites were detected which will aid in identifying areas of focus in further research and development. Temperature measurements were linked to the occurrence of defects and crack initiation sites and have been identified as a method of identifying defective welds. The effects of process parameters and stud and hole taper angles on energy inputs and near interface temperatures were statistically evaluated. Downward force was shown to have the largest effect on energy input rates, total energy input and temperatures at the 11. 5 mm and 20. 5 mm positions. Smaller hole and stud taper angles produced lower energy inputs and were identified as more energy efficient than the larger taper angles. A regression model was also developed to predict the fatigue life of welds and can assist with critical process related decision making. A range of hole base diameters were identified which produced welds with low defect populations and fatigue performance {{similar to that of the}} parent plate. Larger hole base diameters were shown to produce significant defects along the hole bottom fillet, in the weld nugget and along the bond line. Temperature measurements of the larger diameter welds showed a delay in response and are attributed to a delayed contact of plasticised stud material with the sidewall. Welds with hole base diameters larger than 11 mm produced unrepeatable and defective welds, and also required higher energy inputs making smaller diameters more desirable. Analysis of all welds in this study revealed that clearance and interfacial pressures characterise the quality of friction hydro pillar process welds, therefore models were developed to aid in critical decision making with respect to downward force and geometry.

40|$|The {{influence}} of microstructure on the corrosion behaviour of magnesium alloys {{has been investigated}} using advanced microscopy approaches including optical microscopy, SEM, TEM and SKPFM {{with a focus on}} the effect of melt-conditioned twin roll casting (MCTRC) and friction stir welding (FSW) on the resultant microstructure of magnesium alloys. The microstructure characterization revealed that intense shearing, generated through the advanced shear technology, resulted in grain refinement and a uniform distribution of the β-phase and reduced micro-porosity in the MCTRC Mg-Al alloys, of which were attributed to the enhanced heterogeneous nucleation, which resulted in a highly refined grain structure. The TRC Mg-Al alloys displayed a coarse grained microstructure, with a random distribution of grain sizes. Deformation features like twinning, localized shear, microporosity and centre-line segregation were some of the commonly observed defects in the TRC alloys. The general microstructure of the AZ series Mg-Al alloys was composed of α-Mg grains, the β-phase, rosette-shaped Al 8 Mn 5 intermetallic particles and β-precipitates. The MCTRC Mg-Al alloys showed improved corrosion resistance owing to the reduced grain size and the β-phase network acting as a corrosion barrier, thereby retarding the corrosion process. The TRC Mg-Al alloys exhibited higher susceptibility to galvanic corrosion due to the coarse and random distribution of grain sizes, and segregation. The corrosion testing results showed different corrosion morphologies, including filiform-like and spherical channel-like along with overall general corrosion. However, galvanic corrosion, initiating at localized sites due to Al 8 Mn 5 intermetallic particles and the Si/Fe impurities accounted for a major deterioration in the performance of the Mg-Al alloys. The polarization curves revealed no evidence of passivation, suggesting that the alloy surface was continuously attacked. SKPFM results indicated that the micro-constituents, namely Al 8 Mn 5 intermetallic particles and the β-phase exhibited higher nobility relative to the α-Mg matrix, suggesting formation of micro-galvanic couples at localized sites leading to the initiation of galvanic corrosion. The AM 60 and AZ 91 Mg-Al alloys, subjected to FSW, revealed that the traverse speed had a direct influence on the weld zone microstructure, where the size of the friction stir/weld nugget zone decreased with increase in the traverse speed and the increase in the rate of deformation, led to widening of the friction stir zone, below the shoulder. The weld microstructure displayed a prominent friction stir zone, with an ultrafine grain structure of an average grain size ranging from 2 - 10 μm. The localized increase in temperatures, in the TMAZ, due to the lower tool rotation rates and traverse speeds, which rise above the eutectic melting point (430 °C), showed evidence of partial melting followed by re-solidification of the β-phase and evidence of liquation below the shoulder regions in the TMAZ. The morphology of the β-phase clearly revealed solute segregation, inconsistent with the β-phase observed in the parent alloy microstructure. The polarization curves obtained from the weld zones in the FSW AM 60 alloy showed an improved corrosion resistance compared with the parent metal zone. SKPFM results revealed that the α-Mg matrix in the friction stir zone showed higher surface potential values compared with the parent alloy microstructure, due to the dissolution of the β-phase, suggesting higher nobility. However, the polarization behaviour of the AZ 91 alloys did not show {{a significant difference in the}} corrosion resistance in the weld zones due to the higher volume fraction of the β-phase in the AZ 91 alloys. The immersion testing results revealed higher susceptibility to corrosion in the transition zone due to the <b>flash</b> <b>formation</b> and the banded microstructure leading to failure of the weld zone.

40|$|The area of {{research}} dealing with joining of dissimilar metals {{has been active in}} recent time. Although fusion and non-fusion techniques of joining have been effectively used for manufacturing components, a comprehensive scientific understanding of the process is lacking. This void exists both in fusion and non-fusion welding methods. The present investigation addresses some of these aspects. The investigation consists of two sections - Part A and Part B. Part A is on Friction welding and Part B deals with Fusion welding using laser. Each section has two chapters each. Following an introductory chapter, basic aspects of friction welding is presented in chapter 2. Chapter 3 deals with the work on friction welding of Fe-Cu couple. Fe-Cu couple is a system with positive heat of mixing. After a brief introduction on various non-equilibrium processes that can occur in this system, experimental details and results are presented. Using the results an attempt is made to understand the <b>flash</b> <b>formation,</b> formation of pores at the interface and the formation of chemically altered zone. It is observed that a chemically altered layer forms predominantly on the Cu side of the interface. It consists of Fe entrapped as fragments/fine crystals and as solid solution in Cu matrix. This zone has higher thickness at the edges than at the center. The mechanism of formation of this interfacial layer which is central to the joining process is related to the fracture and transport of fragments during plastic deformation. Fe forms solid solution in copper under non-equilibrium conditions promoted by shear energy. Using the concept of ballistic mixing, the formation of solid solution is explored. Using nano-indentation experiments mechanical properties of the weldment is estimated and an attempt is made to correlate mechanical properties with the amount of second element present in that location. The chapter 4 in part A deals with the friction welding of Ni-Ti couple. Ni-Ti system has negative heat of mixing and it forms a number of intermetallics. After a brief introduction to the chapter, various experimental techniques and strategies followed to carry out the experiments are explained. Following these, the results are presented. It is observed that TiNi 3 formed at initial stage. Theories based on effective heat of formation and surface energy also predict the nucleation of TiNi 3. With the continuation of frictional processes, the formation of TiNi and Ti 2 Ni phases were also observed. Formation of Ti 2 Ni was shown to greatly accelerate due to shear process. In this system two complementary processes like ballistic mixing and thermal assisted diffusion accelerate Ti 2 Ni formation. From mechanical tests it is found that Ti 2 Ni layer in the weldment is weak and hence formation of Ti 2 Ni in the weldment is detrimental. In chapter 5 an introduction to fusion welding of dissimilar metals is presented as background materials for the subsequent chapters. Chapter 6 deals with nature of segregation of Ag during laser welding of Fe-Ni couple. Ag is used as a tracer to probe fluid flow in the Fe-Ni couple during laser welding. Ag is immiscible both in Fe and Ni whereas Fe and Ni form a complete solution at an elevated temperature and in liquid state. Besides the experimental work, numerical simulation of the weld pool were carried out using homogeneous mixture model using SIMPLER algorithm. Experiments and simulations indicate that fluid flow is asymmetrical and in the deep penetration welding strong convection in the pool drives the tracer {{to the top of the}} pool. Overall distribution of the tracer is due to the combined effect of convection and diffusion. In shallow welding there exists a boundary region where tracer does not penetrate. In chapter 7 the results of instrumented indentation experiments on laser welded Fe-Cu weldment has been presented. It was earlier reported that during laser welding of Fe-Cu couple, a variety of microstructures evolves at various locations in the weldment and hardness of the weldment were found to be very high. Here an attempt has been made to explore in details the origin of such a high hardness. The chapter starts with a description of various microstructures that are observed in this weldment followed by the various procedures used for extracting data from instrumented indentation tests. It is followed by the presentation of the experimental results. It is found that rule of mixture along with Hall-Petch strengthening explains the observed increase in hardness of the weldment. The fine scale microstructure consisting of alternate Fe rich and Cu rich layers increases the hardness of the weldment. On copper side of the weldment, composition and scale of microstructure fluctuates and so also the hardness. Finally in chapter 8 overall conclusions of the various chapters in the thesis have been summarised...|$|E
40|$|Many new {{rotary files}} {{systems have been}} introduced, however, limited {{research}} has been conducted related to the surface irregularities of these files and if these have any effects on the files themselves. Hence, the aim {{of the present study was}} to analyze surface irregularities of the ProTaper® Universal rotary files (PTU) and the ProTaper Next? rotary files (PTN) before and after instrumentation in curved canals. The main objective was to investigate the nature of these irregularities and how they might influence the use and fracture of rotary files during root-canal treatments. The files were examined pre-operatively using a stereomicroscope and scanning electron microscopy(SEM) to analyze surface imperfections and the presence of particles. Mesial roots of forty extracted mandibular molars were selected. Each instrument was used to prepare one of the mesial canals. The files were then rinsed with alcohol, and autoclaved and analyzed again. Of the 80 files used in this study, five files fractured, five files unwound and seven files were curved or bent and they all belonged to the PTU group. Irregularities and debris could be visualized with the SEM on both unused PTU and PTN files. Most of the debris was found associated with deeper milling grooves and defects on the surface of the metal. Surface analysis of the files that were used and sterilized were performed and the SEM images demonstrated organic debris, metal <b>flash,</b> and crack <b>formation</b> and initiation of fractures for both file types. All files showed machining grooves, metal flash, debris, and defects on cutting edges. These irregularities appear to be critical in the accumulation of debris and initiation of fatigue and crack propagation within the NiTi alloy. The accumulation of debris could be a concern due to the potential exchange of organic debris between patients...|$|R
40|$|Star {{formation}} {{is such a}} complex process that accurate numerical tools are needed to quantitatively examine the mass distribution and accretion of fragments in collapsing, turbulent, magnetized gas clouds. To enable a numerical treatment of this regime, we implemented sink particles in the adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) hydrodynamics code FLASH. Sink particles are created in regions of local gravitational collapse, and their trajectories and accretion can be followed over many dynamical times. We perform {{a series of tests}} including the time integration of circular and elliptical orbits, the collapse of a Bonnor-Ebert sphere, and a rotating, fragmenting cloud core. We compare the collapse of a highly unstable singular isothermal sphere to the theory by Shu and show that the sink particle accretion rate is in excellent agreement with the theoretical prediction. To model eccentric orbits and close encounters of sink particles accurately, we show that a very small time step is often required, for which we implemented subcycling of the N-body system. We emphasize that a sole density threshold for sink particle creation is insufficient in supersonic flows, if the density threshold is below the opacity limit. In that case, the density can exceed the threshold in strong shocks that do not necessarily lead to local collapse. Additional checks for bound state, gravitational potential minimum, Jeans instability, and converging flows are absolutely necessary for meaningful creation of sink particles. We apply our new sink particle module for <b>FLASH</b> to the <b>formation</b> of a stellar cluster, and compare to a smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) code with sink particles. Our comparison shows encouraging agreement of gas properties, indicated by column density distributions and radial profiles, and of sink particle formation times and positions. We find excellent agreement in the number of sink particles formed, and in their accretion and mass distributions...|$|R
