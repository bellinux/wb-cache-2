5|$|During the battle, the {{servants}} {{fend off the}} villagers. Gaston attacks the Beast in his tower, who is too depressed to fight back, but regains his will upon seeing Belle return. He spares Gaston's life before reuniting with Belle. However, Gaston stabs the Beast, but he loses <b>his</b> <b>footing</b> and falls to his death. The Beast dies before the last petal falls. When Belle tearfully professes her love to him, the curse is broken, repairing the castle and restoring the Beast's and servants' human forms. The Prince and Belle host a ball for the kingdom, where they dance happily.|$|E
5|$|Lampard {{then put}} Chelsea 3–2 ahead, but Hargreaves {{levelled}} {{things up with}} a shot into the top corner. Ashley Cole was the next up, and Van der Sar got a strong hand to the ball but could not keep it out. Nani then {{knew he had to}} score to keep United in it, and he did, leaving it up to John Terry to win the cup for Chelsea; however, Terry lost <b>his</b> <b>footing</b> when planting his standing foot by the ball, and, even though Van der Sar was sent the wrong way, Terry's mis-hit effort struck the outside of the right post and went wide.|$|E
5|$|The Union {{increased}} its pace with Andrew Wenger playing wide {{on the left}} where he repeatedly got past Yedlin {{to get to the}} byline or cut back to shoot. Maidana and Le Toux strengthened Philadelphia's position by combining {{on the other side of}} the field to penetrate Seattle's defense. Wenger connected with Le Toux who took a shot, but Seattle goalkeeper Stefan Frei was quick enough to make the stop. In the 38th minute, Maidana was fouled by Leonardo González wide right of the penalty area. Maidana's resulting free kick curled towards the back post where Brad Evans lost <b>his</b> <b>footing</b> and Edu glanced the ball with his forehead to put it in the back of the net. The home team kept control of the first half and continued creating scoring opportunities.|$|E

5|$|Phil's mother Peggy (Barbara Windsor) {{is accused}} by Janine Butcher (Charlie Brooks) of {{attempting}} to frame her for the murder. As Janine prepares to flee Walford, Peggy finds Roxy and Ronnie fighting. She tells the girls that she too was present the night Archie was killed, arriving to find him injured but alive, however left without calling for medical help. Outside, Bradley and Stacey are {{about to take a}} taxi to St Pancras railway station when Bradley realises he has forgotten their passports. He tells Stacey to wait and hurries back home to collect them, but is spotted by the police. A chase ensues, and Bradley climbs onto the roof of The Queen Victoria public house in an attempt to escape. He shouts for Stacey to run before losing <b>his</b> <b>footing</b> and falling from the roof. He dies from his injuries as a distressed Stacey reaches him and the residents look on in horror. Stacey is comforted by Max, and confesses that she is the one who killed Archie.|$|E
5|$|Rainfall reached 1inch (25mm) in {{portions}} of western Connecticut and Massachusetts. Strong surf from Isabel caused {{a man to}} drown after losing <b>his</b> <b>footing</b> along the beach near Narragansett, Rhode Island, and being swept out to sea. Officials in Connecticut contacted a water company in Watertown and a grocer in Cheshire for donations to assist the residents affected in North Carolina. A few days after Isabel moved ashore, the officials sent a tractor trailer truck with 2,000gallons (7570l) of water and 25,000pounds (11,340kg) of ice to North Carolina. In Vermont, the strong pressure gradient produced a peak wind gust of 55mph (89km/h) in Pleasant Valley, causing sporadic downed trees and power lines throughout the state. In Richmond, trees fell on and damaged threetrucks, and in Salisbury a falling tree damaged a car. Damage in the state totaled about $100,000 (2003USD, $117,000 in 2008USD). Rainfall reached 1inch (25mm) in various portions of New Hampshire and Maine.|$|E
5|$|A throw-in by Hagi led to Şükür {{attempting}} to reach Erdem, {{who was in}} the penalty area, but was tackled and match play continued, which saw Arsenal attack on the counter under Parlour, whose volley shot went wide. Overmars then had an opportunity, after being given the ball by Henry, but the shot was off target. In the 70th minute, Korkmaz exchanged passes with Erdem, but his effort was successfully blocked by Tony Adams. Three minutes later, Parlour attempted a bending cross for Henry, but Taffarel read it easily. A well-played pass by Nwankwo Kanu ensured the ball reached Henry on the left area, who proceeded to give it to Overmars in the penalty area – however, Overmars's shot fell flat, but still enough for Taffarel to make a save. With four minutes of normal time remaining, the Turks came close to a winning goal, when Şükür collected the ball from the centre and entered Arsenal's area, but lost <b>his</b> <b>footing</b> before he could make an effort on goal, allowing Seaman to pick up the ball for a goal kick. Two minutes of extra time were added on, just when a free-kick was awarded to Galatasaray. Şükür took the shot, but the ball headed wide around the wall. It proved to be the final event in normal time, as the match entered extra time.|$|E

5|$|The 1992 Winter Olympics in Albertville, France {{was viewed}} as the {{potential}} {{start of a new}} era in Australian winter sports, with hopes that a maiden medal would result. Australia's short track relay team went into the 1992 Olympics as world champions, but crashed in the semi-finals. The Australians were in third place when Richard Nizielski lost <b>his</b> <b>footing</b> and knocked over teammate John Kah during a changeover; they finished fourth and failed to reach the final. In the individual speed skating events, Australia scored only four top 20 finishes from 12 starts, with none higher than 12th, and only one placing in the top half. Kirstie Marshall {{was in the process of}} winning the 1992 World Cup series, and was one of the favourites for the women's aerial skiing, which was a demonstration event, but she crash-landed and finished seventh. Lee managed two top 20 finishes in alpine skiing events, and finished in the top half of the competitors in four events; most of the Australians remained in the bottom half in all of their events. Despite the disappointments of the near-misses, Australia increased their investment in the Winter Olympics, purchasing a training base called Sonnpark in Austria in 1993.|$|E
25|$|While many Sigma Alpha Epsilon Chapters today {{claim that}} Noble Leslie DeVotie {{was the first}} person to die in the Civil War, this is in dispute. DeVotie lost <b>his</b> <b>footing</b> while {{boarding}} a steamer at Fort Morgan, Alabama, on February 12, 1861, hit his head and drowned. His body washed ashore three days later. Because Alabama had already seceded from the Union in January of that year, DeVotie is viewed by many to be the first casualty of the war. He is recognized as such by the state of Alabama.|$|E
25|$|Ed Smith {{took over}} the mantle from Owais Shah as Middlesex Crusaders' most useful batsman in the Twenty20 Cup, as he {{recorded}} three sixes in a 59-ball 85 and lifted Middlesex to 189 for 8 against Kent Spitfires at Beckenham. In reply, Kent lost wickets regularly, and Justin Kemp - normally a quick scorer - could not find <b>his</b> <b>footing</b> and only made 23 not out off 19 balls, as Kent could only scamper 169 for 5 in their allotted 20 overs, 21 runs short of the target.|$|E

25|$|Mount Hood {{was one of}} {{the first}} {{mountains}} Rusk saw when he and his family came from Illinois; however, he did not get to climb it until much later, in 1922. This climb he made solo up the Cooper Spur route. Once he got to the top, he spent a long time with the fire lookout, Charles A. Phelps, who regaled him of many his adventures as the lookout. On the way back down, Rusk had one of his few climbing accidents, losing <b>his</b> <b>footing</b> and sliding quickly down the slope for a short distance.|$|E
25|$|The final {{resolution}} of the case was triggered by a chance discovery. In early 1986, English tourist David Brett fell to his death from Uluru during an evening climb. Because of the vast size of the rock and the scrubby nature of the surrounding terrain, it was eight days before Brett's remains were discovered, lying below the bluff where he had lost <b>his</b> <b>footing</b> and in an area full of dingo lairs. As police searched the area, looking for missing bones {{that might have been}} carried off by dingoes, they discovered a small item of clothing. It was quickly identified as the crucial missing piece of evidence from the Chamberlain case, Azaria's missing matinee jacket.|$|E
25|$|At the castle, the {{servants}} {{are able to}} keep the lynch mob at bay, but Gaston breaks through and finds the Beast in his tower. He engages in a fight with him, mercilessly beating and taunting him ("Battle"). The Beast has lost the will to live at Belle's departure. As Gaston moves in for the killing blow, Belle arrives. The Beast immediately turns on Gaston and is prepared to kill him, but spares his life after seeing the fear in his eyes. The Beast and Belle are reunited, but this reunion is cut short as Gaston fatally stabs the Beast. This act of violence causes Gaston to lose <b>his</b> <b>footing</b> and he falls to his death.|$|E

25|$|Under rainy {{and muddy}} conditions, the Falcons' pass-happy run-and-shoot offense turned {{the ball over}} six times, with Miller, who had {{problems}} all game with <b>his</b> <b>footing,</b> throwing four interceptions and getting sacked four times. The Redskins held the ball for over 36 minutes, scoring two touchdowns in a span of 3:11 in the second quarter. Washington scored first by driving 81 yards to score on running back Ricky Ervins' 17-yard rushing touchdown. Then, Redskins defensive lineman Charles Mann forced a fumble from Pat Chaffey that was recovered by Jumpy Geathers, giving the Redskins a first down on the Falcons 39-yard line. Following two runs by Earnest Byner for 11 yards, Rypien completed a 26-yard pass to Ricky Sanders on the 2, and Gerald Riggs ran {{the ball into the}} end zone on the next play.|$|E
25|$|The legend {{associated}} with the Bealach a' Choin Ghlais {{is part of the}} same story that surrounds the naming of the nearby Gulf of Corryvreckan (English: the speckled cauldron). This is where the Norse Prince Breacan of Lochlann is said to have drowned when his boat sank there, so giving his name to this great whirlpool. The prince's dog managed to swim to land and went in search of his master. Failing to find him on Jura or Scarba he tried to leap across the strait to Lunga, but missed <b>his</b> <b>footing</b> on Eilean a' Bhealaich which sits {{in the middle of the}} channel between the two islands. He slipped into the raging current and drowned as well, giving his own name in turn to the strait where he fell - the 'pass of the grey dog'.|$|E
25|$|On {{the romantic}} front, he dated newly {{divorced}} Ginger Rogers. The romance soon cooled, however, and by chance Stewart encountered Margaret Sullavan again. Stewart found <b>his</b> <b>footing</b> in Hollywood {{thanks largely to}} Sullavan, who campaigned for Stewart to be her leading man in the 1936 romantic comedy Next Time We Love. She rehearsed extensively with him, having a noticeable effect on his confidence. She encouraged Stewart to feel comfortable with his unique mannerisms and boyish charm and use them naturally as his own style. Stewart was enjoying Hollywood life and had no regrets about giving up the stage, as he worked {{six days a week}} in the MGM factory. In 1936, he acquired big-time agent Leland Hayward, who would eventually marry Sullavan. Hayward started to chart Stewart's career, deciding that the best path for him was through loan-outs to other studios.|$|E

25|$|Meanwhile, Sam rescues Frodo {{from the}} tower of Cirith Ungol. They set out across Mordor. Aragorn leads an army of men from Gondor and Rohan to march on the Black Gate to {{distract}} Sauron from his true danger. His army is vastly outnumbered by the great might of Sauron. Frodo and Sam reach {{the edge of the}} Cracks of Doom, but Frodo cannot resist the Ring any longer. He claims it for himself and puts it on his finger. Gollum suddenly reappears. He struggles with Frodo and bites off Frodo's finger with the Ring still on it. Celebrating wildly, Gollum loses <b>his</b> <b>footing</b> and falls into the Fire, taking the Ring with him. When the Ring is destroyed, Sauron loses his power forever. The Nazgûl perish, and his armies are thrown into such disarray that Aragorn's forces emerge victorious.|$|E
25|$|During the 1964 Hama riot, Assad {{voted to}} {{suppress}} the uprising violently if needed. The decision {{to suppress the}} Hama riot led to a schism in the Military Committee between Umran and Jadid. Umran opposed force, instead wanting the Ba'ath Party to create a coalition with other pan-Arab forces. Jadid desired a strong one-party state, {{similar to those in}} the communist countries of Europe. Assad, as junior partner, kept quiet at first but eventually allied himself with Jadid. Why Assad chose to side with him has been widely discussed; he probably shared Jadid's radical ideological outlook. Having lost <b>his</b> <b>footing</b> on the Military Committee, Umran aligned himself with Aflaq and the National Command; he told them that the Military Committee was planning to seize power in the party by ousting them. Because of Umran's defection, Rifaat al-Assad (Assad's brother) succeeded Umran as commander of a secret military force tasked with protecting Military Committee loyalists.|$|E
25|$|At {{least three}} {{accounts}} exist {{of the following}} events: one given by the FBI, one by {{other people in the}} area, and one by local law enforcement. The accounts agree that, after obtaining some food at a local pool hall owned by his friend Charles Joy, Floyd hitched a ride in an East Liverpool neighborhood on October 22, 1934. He was spotted by the team of lawmen, at which point he broke from the vehicle and fled towards a treeline. Local retired officer Chester Smith fired first, hitting Floyd in the right arm, knocking him to the ground. At this point, the three accounts diverge; the FBI agents later attempted to claim all the credit, denying local law enforcement were even present at the shooting. According to the local police account, Floyd regained <b>his</b> <b>footing</b> and continued to run, at which point the entire team opened fire, knocking him to the ground. Floyd died from his wounds shortly thereafter.|$|E
