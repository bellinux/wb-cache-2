5|$|The {{gear and}} <b>dial</b> {{in the bottom}} left of the game screen {{is related to the}} Kotarou's Rewrite ability. The <b>dial</b> moves forward {{whenever}} this ability is used, and the outcome of certain scenes is determined by how much the <b>dial</b> has moved. Throughout most of the game, the text is presented in a dialog box on the lower portion of the game screen, but this is changed for the Terra scenario, where the text is overlaid across the entire screen.|$|E
5|$|A {{clock is}} {{documented}} in this tower since 1405, {{when a new}} bell was installed. The city accounts of 1438 mention the repair of the clockworks. The first mention of a <b>dial</b> is in 1443, and the first known image of the, much smaller first astrolabium <b>dial</b> (in the diary a cobbler journeyman from Ulm) is dated 1534. The jacquemart (bellstriker) is also documented in the same 1534 source.|$|E
5|$|Almost every {{episode of}} Dexter's Laboratory {{is divided into}} three {{different}} stories/segments, each one being approximately 8 minutes in length. Occasionally, the middle segment centered on characters from the Dexter's Laboratory universe other than Dexter and his family. Two of these segments were shown primarily during the first season: <b>Dial</b> M for Monkey and The Justice Friends. <b>Dial</b> M for Monkey was the middle segment for the first six episodes of season one, and The Justice Friends took its place {{for the rest of the}} season.|$|E
50|$|International direct <b>dialing</b> (IDD) or {{international}} subscriber <b>dialling</b> (ISD) is placing an international telephone call that is <b>dialed</b> directly by a telephone subscriber, {{rather than by}} an telephone operator. The term international subscriber <b>dialling</b> {{was used in the}} United Kingdom and Australia until the terminology was changed to international direct <b>dialling.</b> Since the late 20th century, most international calls are <b>dialed</b> directly.|$|R
50|$|Vertical declining <b>dials</b> are sundials that {{indicate}} local apparent time. Vertical south <b>dials</b> are a special case: as are vertical north, vertical east and vertical west <b>dials.</b> The word declining {{means that the}} wall is offset from one of these 4 cardinal points. There are <b>dials</b> that are not vertical, and these are called reclining <b>dials.</b>|$|R
50|$|Direct {{distance}} <b>dialing</b> (DDD) is a {{telecommunication service}} feature {{in which a}} caller may, without operator assistance, call any other user outside the local calling area. Direct <b>dialing</b> by subscribers typically requires extra digits to be <b>dialed</b> as prefixes than for <b>dialing</b> within the local area or within an area code. DDD also extends {{beyond the boundaries of}} national public telephone network, in which case it is called international direct <b>dialing</b> or international direct distance <b>dialing</b> (IDDD).|$|R
5|$|Around the planisphere {{moves the}} rete, a {{web-like}} metal cutout representing the zodiac, which {{also features a}} Julian calendar <b>dial.</b> Above the rete, a display indicates {{the day of the}} week. Because leap days are not supported by the clockwork, the calendar hand has to be reset manually each leap year on 29 February. A moon <b>dial</b> circles the inner ring of the zodiac, displaying the moon phase. The principal hand of the clock indicates the time of day on the outer ring of 24 golden Roman numerals, which run twice from I to XII. It features two suns, the smaller one indicating the date on the retes calendar <b>dial.</b> The larger one circles the zodiac at one revolution per year and also rotates across the planisphere once per day. Its crossing of the horizon and dawn lines twice per day allows the timing of sunrise, dawn, dusk and sunset.|$|E

5|$|The <b>Dial</b> M for Monkey shorts feature Dexter's pet {{laboratory}} monkey named Monkey (vocal effects {{provided by}} Frank Welker), whom Dexter believes is an ordinary monkey and nothing more. However, Monkey secretly has superpowers and fights evil as the superhero Monkey. Monkey {{is joined by}} his partner Agent Honeydew (voiced by Kath Soucie) of Global Security, her director the Commander General (voiced by Robert Ridgely in Season 1, Earl Boen in Season 2), {{and a team of}} assembled superheroes. <b>Dial</b> M for Monkey was created by Genndy Tartakovsky, Craig McCracken, and Paul Rudish.|$|E
50|$|Within the {{telecommunication}} industry, a NAD will {{be connected}} to a user's telephone. When the user <b>dials</b> a number, the NAD will 'listen' to the <b>dialled</b> digits and reroute the call through a network that will provide the best rates for the destination of the call. The NAD {{is often referred to}} as a <b>dialler,</b> predictive <b>dialler</b> or least cost routing <b>dialler.</b>|$|R
50|$|When <b>dialled</b> {{within the}} Netherlands, the {{domestic}} trunk access code 0 must be <b>dialled</b> before the telephone number, extending the <b>dialling</b> sequence to 10 digits.|$|R
50|$|Under an overlay plan, {{permissive}} <b>dialing</b> {{refers to}} the ability to continue to connect calls via 7-digit <b>dialing</b> while also making 10-digit <b>dialing</b> valid. Again, the affected area must not introduce any new ambiguous telephone exchanges. At the end of the period, 10-digit <b>dialing</b> becomes mandatory.|$|R
5|$|The P90 uses an {{internal}} hammer striking mechanism and a trigger mechanism with a three-position rotary <b>dial</b> fire control selector, {{located at the}} foot of the trigger. The <b>dial</b> has three settings: S– safe, 1– semi-automatic fire, and A– fully automatic fire. When set on A, the P90's fire selector provides a two-stage trigger operation similar to that of the Steyr AUG assault rifle—pulling the trigger back slightly produces semi-automatic fire, and pulling the trigger fully to the rear produces fully automatic fire.|$|E
5|$|Alabama had 17 {{returning}} starters {{from the previous}} season, including ten on defense and seven on offense. The most notable departures {{from the previous year}} were defensive end Marcell Dareus, left tackle James Carpenter, tight end Preston <b>Dial,</b> quarterback Greg McElroy, wide receiver Julio Jones and running back Mark Ingram Jr.|$|E
5|$|Hard Truths: The Art of Thornton <b>Dial,</b> {{on display}} from February to September 2011, {{includes}} over 70 large-scale artworks {{and is the}} largest assemblage of Thornton Dial's work ever mounted. The exhibition contextualizes <b>Dial</b> as a relevant, contemporary artist rather than a folk artist or outsider artist as many have portrayed him in the past. The pieces on view in Hard Truths cover a range {{of social and political}} themes, many of which address rural life in the south and the treatment of African Americans. After departing Indianapolis, the exhibition is scheduled to travel to New Orleans, Charlotte, North Carolina and Atlanta.|$|E
5000|$|Note: {{the tone}} signal after <b>dialing</b> [...] "8" [...] is {{compulsory}} on old analog (with pulse mode <b>dialing)</b> exchanges and optional on digital (tone mode <b>dialing)</b> exchanges.|$|R
50|$|Natural {{predictive}} <b>dialing</b> has {{the benefits}} {{of all of the}} above <b>dialing</b> modes. With natural predictive <b>dialing,</b> call progress analysis (CPA) occurs in parallel with the agent connection, as opposed to the agent being connected after the CPA has determined that a live person is on the phone. This results in {{the benefits of}} CPA automation as in predictive <b>dialing</b> while also allowing an agent to always be available as in power <b>dialing.</b> The primary disadvantage to natural predictive <b>dialing</b> is that it is patented and is only available through a single vendor.|$|R
50|$|Some countries, such as Uruguay, have merged variable-length area {{codes and}} {{telephone}} numbers into fixed-length numbers that {{must always be}} <b>dialed</b> independently of location. In such closed <b>dialing</b> plans, also having a closed numbering plan, the area code is formally not distinguished in the telephone number. In the UK, area codes were first known as subscriber trunk <b>dialling</b> (STD) codes. Depending on local <b>dialing</b> plans, they are often necessary only when <b>dialed</b> from outside the code area or from mobile phones. In North America ten-digit <b>dialing</b> is required in areas with overlay plans.|$|R
5|$|The clock has its {{original}} medieval face. As well as showing {{the time on}} a 24-hour <b>dial,</b> it reflects {{the motion of the}} Sun and Moon, the phases of the Moon, and the time since the last new Moon. The astronomical <b>dial</b> represents a geocentric or pre-Copernican view of the universe, with the Sun and Moon revolving round a central fixed Earth, like that of the clock at Ottery St Mary. The quarters are chimed by a quarter jack {{in the form of a}} small automaton known as Jack Blandifers, who hits two bells with hammers and two with his heels. At the striking of the clock, jousting knights appear above the clock face.|$|E
5|$|There are 16 {{broadcast}} {{radio stations in}} the city covering a variety of genres and interests, all on the FM <b>dial.</b> Ten of these stations are English and six are French.|$|E
5|$|Although {{licensed}} to Oakland, {{a community in}} Western Bergen County, radio station WVNJ operating at 1160kHz on the AM <b>dial</b> maintains its studios at 1086 Teaneck Road. WFDU FM-89.1 operates from studios at Fairleigh Dickinson University, {{and there was a}} defunct AM Carrier Current version of WFDU on 640 through some time in the 1980s.|$|E
5000|$|... it {{can cause}} {{problems}} for computer telephone line modems, which are unable to recognise the interrupted <b>dialling</b> tone as a <b>dialling</b> tone and which will thus refuse to make outgoing calls, reporting being unable to detect a <b>dialling</b> tone (although many modems allow [...] "blind dialling", without trying to detect a <b>dialling</b> tone); ...|$|R
50|$|Prior to the {{introduction}} of Subscriber Trunk <b>Dialling,</b> most Group Switching Centres housed operators in an Auto Manual Centre (AMC) who were able to place any calls for subscribers in the local area that could not be directly <b>dialled.</b> Operators continued to be used after {{the introduction}} of Subscriber Trunk <b>Dialling</b> albeit on a reducing basis as direct <b>dialled</b> routings became increasingly available until universal direct <b>dialling</b> between U.K subscribers became available in 1979 via the Trunk Transit Network.|$|R
50|$|When {{placing a}} phone call from Trinidad and Tobago, also known as HNPA (home {{numbering}} plan area) <b>dialling,</b> callers simply use seven-digit <b>dialling</b> (i.e. <b>dialling</b> the last seven digits of the phone number).|$|R
5|$|At Vauxhall, Sir Samuel Morland built a fine room, anno 1667, {{the inside}} all of looking-glass, and fountains very {{pleasant}} to behold, {{which is much}} visited by strangers: it {{stands in the middle}} of the garden, covered with Cornish slate, on the point of which he placed a punchinello, very well carved, which held a <b>dial,</b> but the winds have demolished it.|$|E
5|$|More {{than a dozen}} houses, pubs {{and other}} {{buildings}} have been granted listed status in Navenby. Houses of specific interest include Grade II listed <b>Dial</b> House in North Lane, which has a priest hole, and the Old Rectory in North Lane, which was built of Ashlar stone in 1859 by H A Darbyshire, a London architect.|$|E
5|$|Prior to {{the bomb}} run {{the pilot was}} {{directed}} to fly the aircraft in several different directions in sequence, preferably about 120 degrees apart. On each leg, the bomb aimer used the reticle to measure the drift angle, either by rotating the wind direction <b>dial</b> on the computor to get the sight head to the right angle, or by unlocking the azimuth control from the computor and turning the sight manually. The drift angle was whatever angle the sight head was pointing when objects on the ground could {{be seen to be}} moving along the line on the sight. Once measured, the angle of the aircraft and the angle of the drift (measured either from the <b>dial</b> on the computor or the scale on the sight) were recorded. Using the Mk. III Navigation Computor, the RAF's version of the modern E6B, the three sets of angles were entered on the wind calculator face. This normally resulted in a small triangular area forming where the three lines came close to meeting, and the centre of this triangle revealed the wind speed and direction. This value was then entered into the computor.|$|E
5000|$|Mandatory ten-digit local <b>dialing</b> of {{existing}} 304 numbers took effect on February 28, 2009. (Calls within 304 <b>dialed</b> with just seven digits became extinct; a recorded message informed {{them of the}} new <b>dialing</b> procedure.) ...|$|R
50|$|A {{telephone}} number in Belgium is {{a sequence of}} nine or ten digits <b>dialed</b> on a telephone {{to make a call}} on the Belgian telephone network. Belgium is under a closed telephone <b>dialing</b> plan, meaning that the full national number must be <b>dialed</b> for all calls, but it retains the trunk code, '0', for all national <b>dialling.</b>|$|R
50|$|The <b>dialing</b> code 495 was {{introduced}} on 1 December 2005 to replace 095, {{in order to}} make it possible to adopt the ITU convention of 0 and 00 <b>dialing</b> prefixes for local and international <b>dialing</b> respectively. The old '095' <b>dialing</b> code, along with 19 other Russian area codes starting with '0', expired on 31 January 2006.|$|R
5|$|The clock <b>dial</b> {{has been}} dated {{to either the}} {{building}} phases of 1405 or 1467-83, or to {{the installation of the}} Brunner clockwork in 1527-30. Ueli Bellwald notes that the planisphere uses a southern projection, as was characteristic for 15th-century astronomical clocks; all later such clocks use a northern projection. This would seem to confirm the dating of the clock to the 1405 or 1467/83 renovations.|$|E
5|$|The <b>dial</b> of the Zytglogge's {{astronomical clock}} is {{built in the}} form of an astrolabe. It is backed by a stereographically {{projected}} planisphere divided into three zones: the black night sky, the deep blue zone of dawn and the light blue day sky. The skies are crisscrossed with the golden lines of the horizon, dawn, the tropics and the temporal hours, which divide the time of daylight into twelve hours whose length varies with the time of year.|$|E
5|$|The {{third season}} DVD {{contains}} {{a number of}} deleted scenes from this episode, including Karen pulling a prank on Jim by setting his <b>dial</b> tone to call Hong Kong, Andy comparing his jumping skills to Michael Jordan to Jim, Michael asking Pam how she is holding up since the wedding broke off, and Jan being furious at Michael.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>dialing</b> {{pattern for}} Hot-Choice {{subscribers}} is different. After <b>dialing</b> [...] "8", the subscriber {{waits for a}} tone and then <b>dials</b> the operator code (OC) either for a long distance call or an international call.|$|R
50|$|Originally, local calls {{within an}} area code {{could be placed}} by <b>dialing</b> NXX-XXXX, omitting the area code, known as 7-digit <b>dialing.</b> Only calling a {{destination}} in a different area code required <b>dialing</b> the destination area code, known as ten-digit <b>dialing,</b> but due {{to the need for}} additional telephone numbers in many regions, seven digit <b>dialing</b> is becoming rare in the United States. With the rapid growth of telephony in the late 20th century, large metropolitan areas saw the introduction of overlay codes in the mid and late 1990s. With two or more area codes becoming available in the same vicinity, mandatory ten-digit <b>dialing</b> rules were instituted, requiring the area code to be <b>dialed</b> for all calls. The trunk code 1 remains optional for local calls in some of these areas.|$|R
50|$|Seven-digit <b>dialing</b> is a {{telephone}} <b>dialing</b> procedure customary {{in the territories}} of the North American Numbering Plan, for <b>dialing</b> telephone numbers in the local calling area. It is also sometimes known as local format or network format.|$|R
