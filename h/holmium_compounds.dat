40|$|The novel carbidonitridosilicates Ho 2 [Si 4 N 6 C] and Tb 2 [Si 4 N 6 C] were {{obtained}} by {{the reaction of the}} respective lanthanoid metal with carbon and Si(NH) 2 in a radiofrequency furnace at the temperature of 1700 °C. According to the single-crystal structure analysis of Ho 2 [Si 4 N 6 C] (P 21 /c, Z = 4, a = 593. 14 (1), b = 989. 74 (1), c = 1188. 59 (2) pm, β = 119. 58 (4) °, R 1 = 0. 0355, wR 2 = 0. 0879, 2187 F 2 values, 119 parameters) the compound contains a condensed network of corner-sharing star like [C(SiN 3) 4] units. The holmium ions are situated in channels along [100]. The UV–VIS absorption spectrum of Ho 2 [Si 4 N 6 C] shows the typical Ho 3 + absorption bands. The spectroscopic results show that the 4 f states remain almost unaffected by the coordination sphere and thus it is impossible to distinguish between the two crystallographic sites of Ho 3 + in the UV–VIS spectrum. Magnetic susceptibility measurements of Tb 2 [Si 4 N 6 C] and Ho 2 [Si 4 N 6 C] show Curie–Weiss behaviour above 150 K with experimental magnetic moments of 9. 57 (6) μB/Tb and 10. 27 (4) μB/Ho. The Weiss constants are − 15 (1) K and − 11 (1) K for the terbium and <b>holmium</b> <b>compounds,</b> respectively. Down to 2 K no magnetic ordering could be detected. The magnetization curves at 2 K show an increase of the magnetization with increasing flux density, indicating partial parallel spin alignments. At 5 T the magnetizations reach values of 4. 15 (5) μB/Tb and 4. 75 (5) μB/Ho, respectively. ...|$|E
40|$|Molecular Mo[subscript] 6 S[subscript] 8 L[subscript] 6 cluster {{complexes}} {{have been}} explored as potential intermediates to the Chevrel phases. An improved method of preparing the initial cluster compound, Na[subscript] 2 yMo[subscript] 6 S[subscript] 8 + y(py) [subscript] x, {{was discovered by}} reacting Mo[subscript] 6 Cl[subscript] 12 with higher stoichiometries of sodium hydrosulfide and sodium butoxide in butanol/pyridine. This compound can subsequently undergo ligand exchange reactions to form a variety of cluster complexes.;Single-crystal structure determinations are reported for the pyridine (py), piperidine (pip), and pyrrolidine (pyrr) complexes: triclinic Mo[subscript] 6 S[subscript] 8 (py) [subscript] 6 · 1. 65 py, cubic Mo[subscript] 6 S[subscript] 8 (py) [subscript] 6 · 2 py, Mo[subscript] 6 S[subscript] 8 (pip) [subscript] 6 · 7 pip, and Mo[subscript] 6 S[subscript] 8 (pyrr) [subscript] 6 · 1 pyrr. Solubility of the piperidine complex allowed for two-dimensional NMR studies and the structure supports coordination via equatorial positions of the piperidine ring. Raman and XPS spectra give characteristic bands which reflect {{the presence of the}} Mo[subscript] 6 S[subscript] 8 cluster unit. The nitrogen-donor complexes exhibit the weakest Mo-L bonding; consequently, these complexes were the best materials for deligation studies.;Deligation of the cluster complexes was explored under a variety of reaction conditions. Direct heating under dynamic vacuum led to incomplete deligation. Reactions with tin and lead metal resulted {{in the formation of the}} corresponding Chevrel phase compounds along with MoS[subscript] 2. Thermolysis reactions in the presence of flowing ammonia gas resulted in further deligation than was evidenced for reactions explored in vacuo. Solution reactions with strong acids were studied in an attempt to protonate the ligands and thus make them better leaving groups. Preliminary observations indicate only limited success in this area.;A new preparative route has been developed for ternary molybdenum sulfides. Cation exchange reactions with Na[subscript] 2 yMo[subscript] 6 S[subscript] 8 + y(MeOH) [subscript] x were used to form the cobalt, tin, lead, and <b>holmium</b> <b>compounds.</b> Raman and XPS spectra support the presence of the Mo[subscript] 6 S[subscript] 8 cluster unit. High temperature heating of the tin molybdenum sulfide under flowing hydrogen gas produced the tin Chevrel phase. Preliminary hydrodesulfurization studies on the sodium and cobalt compounds showed that these materials possess larger surface areas and thiophene conversion percentages than Chevrel phases; however, these ternary molybdenum sulfides exhibit a lower HDS rate...|$|E

40|$|The {{magnetic}} {{order of}} the lanthanoid and cobalt moments in the hexagonal Zr 2 Fe 12 P 7 type phosphides Ln 2 Co 12 P 7 Ln Pr, Nd, Ho and Lu has been investigated by SQUID magnetization measurements and by neutron powder diffraction. The cobalt sublattices order ferromagnetically below the Curie temperatures of 136 2, 140 2, 152 2 and 150 2 K in the praseodymium, neodymium, <b>holmium</b> and lutetium <b>compounds,</b> respectively. The cobalt atoms with tetrahedral and square pyramidal phosphorus coordination carry magnetic moments of 0. 3 1 and 0. 9 1 mu B respectively, and they are aligned parallel to the hexagonal axis. Below the second transition temperature T t 15 1 K the praseodymium moments order ferromagnetically with an antiferromagnetic component relative to the cobalt sublattice and with an angle off thee axis. In contrast, the neodymium and holmium moments do not order at a well defined transition temperature, instead the order is induced gradually by the ferromagnetic cobalt sublattice. In both compounds it sets in at about 65 K. The neodymium moments are antiparallel and the holmium moments are parallel to the cobalt moments, resulting in ferri and ferromagnetism, respectively. The magnetic structures of the three compounds are confirmed by temperature and field dependent SQUID magnetization measurements of powders; for Pr 2 Co 12 P 7 and Nd 2 Co 12 P 7 these measurements were also carried out with oriented single crystals. The experimentally obtained values for the magnetic moments amount to only between 44 and 77 of the theoretical values and this is rationalized by partial disorder. C 1997 Elsevier Science S.
