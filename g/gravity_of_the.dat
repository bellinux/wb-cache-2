30|$|The {{standard}} short-term allowable {{lateral resistance}} {{according to the}} current Japanese design standard for timber structures [9] of nailed plywood–timber joints with Todomatsu timber and Karamatsu plywood is 66  % of 667  N, which is two-thirds <b>of</b> <b>the</b> control static maximum load. In this design standard, the allowable lateral resistance is conservatively given for the lower limit specific <b>gravities</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> materials. Because <b>the</b> specific <b>gravities</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> materials {{used in this study}} were higher than the lower limit values, the short-term allowable lateral resistance was adjusted to the actual specific gravities. The resultant short-term allowable resistance was 494  N, 74  % of 667  N [9]. As a result, one-third, two-thirds and three-thirds <b>of</b> <b>the</b> control maximum load corresponded to 0.68, 1.36 and 2.03 times the short-term allowable lateral resistance adjusted to <b>the</b> actual specific <b>gravities</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> materials. In this study, the rounded average maximum load was adopted as the control value with no conservative estimation. This was due to the consideration that an underestimation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> input forces would result in an overestimation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> dynamic resistance.|$|R

5|$|Comets can loosely {{be divided}} into two categories: short-period and long-period—the latter being thought to {{originate}} in the Oort cloud. The two major categories of short-period comets are Jupiter-family comets (JFCs) and Halley-type comets. Halley-type comets, which are named after their prototype, Halley's Comet, are thought to have originated in the Oort cloud but to have been drawn into the inner Solar System by the <b>gravity</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> giant planets, whereas the JFCs are thought to have originated in the scattered disc. The centaurs are thought to be a dynamically intermediate stage between the scattered disc and the Jupiter family.|$|E

Due to the low centre of <b>gravity</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> vehicle, an 18-inch (450mm) ramp had to be implemented on the road tarmac at Millbrook Proving Grounds and Adam Kirley, the stunt driver who performed the stunt, had to use an air cannon located behind the driver's seat to propel the car into a roll at the precise moment of impact.

At 19:45 the barrage stopped, and the U.S. technicians returned to their positions.|$|E

5|$|During {{the later}} {{reign of the}} second emperor of the Sui dynasty, Yang, the dynasty's {{authority}} began to wane. The main reason was the immense material and human cost of the protracted and fruitless attempts to conquer the Korean kingdom of Goguryeo. Coupled with natural disasters, the conscription of more and more men for {{the war and the}} hoarding of scarce grain reserves for the army's needs increased provincial discontent. As a result, from 611 on, rural revolts broke out across the empire, and with the Emperor's prestige and legitimacy diminished by military failure, ambitious provincial magnates were encouraged to challenge his rule. Yang nevertheless continued to be fixated on the Korean campaigns, and only as unrest spread within the empire and the powerful Eastern Turks turned hostile, did he realize the <b>gravity</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> situation: in 616, he abandoned the north and withdrew to Jiangdu, where he remained until his assassination in 618.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{successful}} use of superheating on other Drummond classes, Robert Urie experimentally fitted a superheated boiler to No.126 in December 1920, {{together with an}} extended smokebox and larger cylinders. The additional weight of the new boiler raised the centre of <b>gravity</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> locomotive, thereby adding to problems of instability on faster main line trains, whilst simultaneously preventing its use on many branch lines. As a result, no further examples were fitted, and No.126 was eventually broken up for spare parts in 1937. In 1931 No. 672 was experimentally fitted with the Strowger-Hudd Automatic Warning System, but the equipment was not adopted by the Southern Railway and the equipment later removed.|$|E

5|$|Over {{the course}} of the Solar System's evolution, comets were ejected out of the inner Solar System by the <b>gravity</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> giant planets, and sent {{thousands}} of AU outward to form the Oort cloud, a spherical outer swarm of cometary nuclei at the farthest extent of the Sun's gravitational pull. Eventually, after about 800 million years, the gravitational disruption caused by galactic tides, passing stars and giant molecular clouds began to deplete the cloud, sending comets into the inner Solar System. The evolution of the outer Solar System also appears to have been influenced by space weathering from the solar wind, micrometeorites, and the neutral components of the interstellar medium.|$|E
5|$|Owing to {{the present}} state of {{continental}} drift, the Northern Hemisphere is now fairly equally divided between land and sea (a ratio of about 2:3) but the South is overwhelmingly oceanic (1:4.7). Salinity in the open ocean is generally in a narrow band around 3.5% by mass, although this can vary in more landlocked waters, near the mouths of large rivers, or at great depths. About 85% of the solids in the open sea are sodium chloride. Deep-sea currents are produced by differences in salinity and temperature. Surface currents are formed by the friction of waves produced by the wind and by tides, the changes in local sea level produced by the <b>gravity</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Moon and Sun. The direction of all of these is governed by surface and submarine land masses and by the rotation of the Earth (the Coriolis effect).|$|E
5|$|The {{orbits of}} the Halley-type comets {{suggest that they}} were {{originally}} long-period comets whose orbits were perturbed by the <b>gravity</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> giant planets and directed into the inner Solar System. If Halley was once a long-period comet, {{it is likely to}} have originated in the Oort Cloud, a sphere of cometary bodies that has an inner edge of 20,000–50,000 AU. Conversely the Jupiter-family comets are generally believed to originate in the Kuiper belt, a flat disc of icy debris between 30 AU (Neptune's orbit) and 50 AU from the Sun (in the scattered disc). Another point of origin for the Halley-type comets was proposed in 2008, when a trans-Neptunian object with a retrograde orbit similar to Halley's was discovered, , whose orbit takes it from just outside that of Uranus to twice the distance of Pluto. It may be a member of a new population of small Solar System bodies that serves as the source of Halley-type comets.|$|E
