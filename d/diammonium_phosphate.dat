5|$|Stations in Paradip and Bhubaneswar each {{recorded}} sustained {{winds of}} 150km/h (90mph) before their instruments failed. Winds of 175km/h (110mph) were measured in Puri as the cyclone {{passed to the}} north. The strong winds damaged electric lines and uprooted trees over 50years old in Puri and Kendrapada. Downed power lines across the state cut off communications between Odisha {{and the rest of}} the world for over 24hours and caused widespread power outages. According to the Southern Electricity Supply Corporation, damage to the power grid caused by the cyclone totaled ₹330million (US$4.4million). Stalling over land, the Odisha cyclone dropped torrential rainfall, with 24-hour rainfall rates at times exceeding 20cm (7.9in); Paradip documented 53cm (20.9in) over one 24-hour period. Over the course of the storm's passage, total rainfall amounts over 60cm (23.6in) occurred over a large swath of Odisha. The highest recorded rainfall total was documented in Oupada, which measured 95.5cm (37.60in) of rain over a three-day period. Flooding caused by the storm was estimated to have killed approximately 2,000people. The heavy rains flattened thatched huts and damaged roads and other infrastructure. Within the seven worst affected districts, over 70%of homes were destroyed; most of these were thatched homes, though 10–15%of non-thatch roofed homes were also destroyed. Approximately 11,000schools were either significantly damaged or destroyed. All major district roads in the area were either washed out or blocked by felled trees. In Bhubaneswar, 60%of trees were flattened by the winds and rain; aerial surveys revealed that the entire city was submerged by floodwaters. Adjacent areas were nearly stripped of all tree cover. Until 8November, the city remained without power. The inundation induced by the far-reaching storm surge and heavy rain kept Konark submerged in knee-deep water for six days after landfall. Over the course of four days, the excessive rainfall caused the flooding of the Baitarani, Brahmani, Budhabalanga, Kharasua, and Salandi rivers, resulting in 20,005flood embankment breaches and the damaging of 6headworks. Thousands of people suffered chemical burns after the flooding mixed industrial chemicals into bathing ponds. Oswal Chemicals and Fertilisers, which maintained the world's largest <b>diammonium</b> <b>phosphate</b> plant, reported severe damage to the facility. In the five Odishan districts most affected, all electric water pumps were disabled, though hand pumps remained operable.|$|E

25|$|Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) is {{generally}} {{thought to be}} a metabolic by-product of yeast fermentation in nitrogen limited environments. It is formed when yeast ferments via the sulfate reduction pathway. Fermenting wine is often supplemented with <b>diammonium</b> <b>phosphate</b> (DAP) as a nitrogen source to prevent H2S formation. The sensory threshold for hydrogen sulfide is 8-10 μg/L, with levels above this imparting a distinct rotten egg aroma to the wine. Hydrogen sulfide can further react with wine compounds to form mercaptans and disulfides.|$|E
25|$|Yeast assimilable {{nitrogen}} or YAN is {{the combination}} of Free Amino Nitrogen (FAN), ammonia (NH3) and ammonium (NH4+) that is available for the wine yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae to use during fermentation. Outside of the fermentable sugars glucose and fructose, nitrogen {{is the most important}} nutrient needed to carry out a successful fermentation that doesn't end prior to the intended point of dryness or sees the development of off-odors and related wine faults.

Visiting Ethiopia in 1994, Jimmy Carter won Prime Minister Meles Zenawi's {{support for}} a {{campaign}} seeking to aid farmers, using the fertilizer <b>diammonium</b> <b>phosphate</b> and Borlaug's methods. The following season, Ethiopia recorded the largest harvests of major crops in history, with a 32% increase in production, and a 15% increase in average yield over the previous season.

25|$|Many {{of these}} {{nutrients}} {{are available in}} the must and skins of the grapes themselves but sometimes are supplemented by winemakers with additions such as <b>diammonium</b> <b>phosphate</b> (DAP), freeze-dried micro-nutrients (such as Go-Ferm and Ferm-K) and even the remnant of dead or extracted yeast cells such that the fermenting yeast can break down to mine for available nitrogen and nutrients. One historical winemaking tradition that is still practiced in some Italian wine regions is the ripasso method of adding the leftover pomace from the pressing of other wines into a newly fermenting batch of wine as an additional food source for the yeast.|$|E
25|$|Sodium {{bicarbonate}} {{can be used}} {{to extinguish}} small grease or electrical fires by being thrown over the fire, as heating of sodium bicarbonate releases carbon dioxide. However, it should not be applied to fires in deep fryers; the sudden release of gas may cause the grease to splatter. Sodium bicarbonate is used in BC dry chemical fire extinguishers {{as an alternative to the}} more corrosive <b>diammonium</b> <b>phosphate</b> in ABC extinguishers. The alkaline nature of sodium bicarbonate makes it the only dry chemical agent, besides Purple-K, that was used in large-scale fire suppression systems installed in commercial kitchens. Because it can act as an alkali, the agent has a mild saponification effect on hot grease, which forms a smothering, soapy foam.|$|E

25|$|While arginine, {{glutamine}} {{and other}} amino acids are rapidly consumed often {{very early in}} fermentation, proline is not consumed by yeast at all during the normal, anaerobic conditions of fermentations. This is {{because one of the}} enzymes required for its use is an oxidase (requiring molecular oxygen) and the other is repressed by the presence of ammonium (another source of assimilable nitrogen needed by yeast) in the must. However, well aerated starter cultures that contain must which hasn't had any <b>diammonium</b> <b>phosphate</b> added it to it will usually see some utilization of proline before the anaerobic conditions of fermentation kick in. When winemakers measure FAN, they need to be aware if their assay is including proline since this will make their YAN measurement higher. Chardonnay and Cabernet Sauvignon are two Vitis vinifera varieties that are known to have very high proline levels while Riesling and Sauvignon blanc usually have very low levels.|$|E
25|$|Starting in 2007, {{the prices}} of {{fertilizers}} of all kinds increased dramatically, peaking around the summer of 2008 (see graphs by the International Fertilizer Industry Association). Prices approximately tripled for ammonia, urea, <b>diammonium</b> <b>phosphate,</b> muriate of potash (KCl), and sulfuric acid (used for making phosphate fertilizer), and then fell just as dramatically {{in the latter part}} of 2008. Some prices doubled within the six months before April 2008. Part of the cause for these price rises was the rise in the price of oil, since the most fertilizers require petroleum or natural gas to manufacture. Although the main fossil fuel input for fertilizer comes from natural gas to generate hydrogen for the Haber–Bosch process (see: Ammonia production), natural gas has its own supply problems similar to those for oil. Because natural gas can substitute for petroleum in some uses (for example, natural gas liquids and electricity generation), increasing prices for petroleum lead to increasing prices for natural gas, and thus for fertilizer.|$|E
