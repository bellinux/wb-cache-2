Comprehensive thermodynamic studies on the corrected adsorption volume were conducted by applying physical chemistry, interface chemistry, coal petrology and coal chemical engineering knowledge. Adsorptivity was evaluated from three aspects, including specific surface area, adsorption capacity on per surface area, and interaction between CO molecule and coal surface. The results show that the adsorption of inertinite is better than that of vitrainite. The change rule in free energy of coal surface under different balance conditions shows that the surface free energy of coal samples with higher vitrinite content is greater than that with higher <b>inertinite</b> <b>content.</b> This explais the main reason why the inertinite has a better adsorption. The isosteric heat of coal samples with higher <b>inertinite</b> <b>content</b> is greater than that with higher vitrinite content and the interaction between CO molecular and coal morphology in coal samples with higher inertinite is greater than that with higher vitrinite...|$|E

Core material has therefore been analysed to characterize depositional environment and source potential of the Lower Quartzarenite Member (LQM). Geochemical data from the Höflein condensate are used to establish a source–condensate correlation. The LQM was deposited in a flood basin with transitions to a delta-plain environment. Coal originated in frequently flooded mires and evolved within an oxygenated and acidic environment. It is inferred from geochemical data that organic matter from aquatic macrophytes and gymnosperms contributed to coal formation. Wildfires were abundant and oxidation of plant remains occurred frequently. This resulted in the formation of dull coal with very high <b>inertinite</b> <b>contents.</b> Bituminous shales were formed in deeper waters under dysoxic conditions. Apart from abundant algae and micro-organisms, it is concluded that there was an increased contribution of higher land plants relative to macrophytes to the biomass of the shales.

30|$|It is {{possible}} to estimate the sedimentation conditions in the original peat bog {{in connection with the}} temperature conditions. The high content of collotelinite (up to 59  vol.%, Table  3) with a discernible cellular structure of plant tissues indicates a humid environment and woody plant vegetation, whereas the higher content of collodetrinite (up to 13  vol.%, Table  3) indicates the subsequent intensive degradation of this woody plant vegetation or the decomposition of a higher amount of herbaceous vegetation. The observed increased liptinite and <b>inertinite</b> <b>contents</b> in durite, trimacerite and carbargilite (see Supplementary material, point 6, Figs VII–X) implies a more intensive decomposition of the organic matter in an arid and oxidizing environment. The ranges of the selected plant species in the Central and Western Bohemian Basins are reported by Pešek (2004) and Opluštil et al. (2016); the plants are described by Kvaček and Straková (1997) and Turek et al. (1998). Intensive degradation of vegetation and decomposition of organic matter under given sedimentation conditions suggests a relatively easy conversion of organic matter to coal, but there is nothing to indicate high temperatures during conversion.|$|R

These phenomena appear to decrease {{as a function}} of aromaticity and evidently, <b>inertinite</b> <b>content</b> in the order: inertinite-rich sample[*]>[*]parent sample[*]>[*]vitrinite-rich sample. In particular, radical mobility and exchange interactions appear to be greatest in a Witbank coal dominated by fusinite, semifusinite, and inertodetrinite; and reduced in a sample with a greater proportion of collotelinite and collodetrinite. These observations are consistent with the widely accepted view that the compositional differences between inertinite and vitrinite macerals derive mainly from genetic, depositional environment-specific variations. Metamorphosis of inertinite-forming precursors before diagenesis and/or incorporation into a peat-forming environment has been suggested by Austen et al. (1966) and Silbernagel et al. (1984 b).|$|E
30|$|The high <b>inertinite</b> <b>content</b> in {{the coals}} of the Main Karoo Basin of South Africa, has {{historically}} been attributed to aerial oxidation and incomplete degradation of plant matter {{as a result of}} a cold climate (Falcon 1986 a, 1989; Hagelskamp and Snyman 1988; Snyman 1989; Cadle et al. 1993; Van Niekerk et al. 2008; O’Keefe et al. 2013). At the same time, others contend that the inertinite component of the coals of the Main Karoo Basin is a product of charring of plant matter (Glasspool 2003 a, b; Jasper et al. 2013; Moroeng et al. 2018). Given the complexity associated with coal formation, and consequent chemical and physical characteristics, it seems unlikely that inertinite genesis was the same in all the coal-forming regions of the world, or even, within a singular peat-forming environment (Austen et al. 1966; Diessel 1992; Moore et al. 1996; Moore and Shearer 1997; Taylor et al. 1998; ICCP 2001; Hower et al. 2011 b; Richardson et al. 2012; Jasper et al. 2013), what some commonly refer to as multiple origin pathways (Hower et al. 2011 a, 2013; O’Keefe and Hower 2011; O’Keefe et al. 2013; Moroeng et al. 2018).|$|E

The three coals {{are similar in}} rank, but two are inertinite-rich coals and the third has high vitrinite content. The microstructural characteristics of the parent coals and their resultant chars were determined using XRD, FTIR, Raman and petrographic analysis. The microstructural changes {{that occurred in the}} organic (maceral) and the inorganic (mineral) fractions of the selected coals were evaluated. The change in the carbon structure was correlated to the proportions of inertinite and vitrinite macerals in the coals. High vitrinite content resulted in an increase in the order of the disordered carbon structure after gasification and this lead greater graphitised ordered carbon structures. While a high <b>inertinite</b> <b>content</b> resulted in low or no structural transformation of the chemical structure. The transformation of inorganic mineral constituents of the coal was correlated to the amount of inerntinite present in the selected coals. Higher proportions of inertinite macerals and inertinitic chars resulted in higher proportions of melted minerals. This correlation could be well related to the fact that inertinites are known to burn at higher temperatures than vitrinites and for a longer time...|$|E
40|$|The high final total {{moisture}} content of fine coal after mining and processing {{is one of}} the major reasons that this resource is not extensively used in subsequent power generation, combustion, or other conversion processes. Some coal products, like export coal, may be subjected to a variety of environmental conditions during transport and storage, such as temperature and humidity. To understand the mechanisms by which moisture is attracted and held on and within fine coal particles, further information is needed regarding the processes occurring at the coal surface. In order to determine the correlation between physical coal properties and its moisture adsorption and desorption characteristics, a series of sorption experiments were conducted on various coal samples under climatically controlled conditions. Equilibrium moisture data was collected while changing the temperature and humidity. This data was correlated to coal properties such as particle size, porosity, maceral composition, and mineral content. All the coals that were studied were medium-rank bituminous coals.

Inertinite {{has been shown to}} have higher carbon and lower hydrogen contents, as well as higher aromaticity than other maceral groups at the bituminous coal rank (Dyrkacz et al. 1984; Falcon 1986 b; White et al. 1989; Maroto-Valer et al. 1994, 1998 a; Davidson 2004; Van Niekerk et al. 2008; Van Niekerk and Mathews 2010; Moroeng et al. 2017). As a result, free radicals formed during coalification are better preserved (Retcofsky et al. 1968; Levine et al. 1982). Radical properties have been used to understand the origin and chemistry of organic matter globally, including coal and its constituent macerals (Austen et al. 1966; Retcofsky et al. 1968, 1981; Grandy and Petrakis 1979; Petrakis and Grandy 1981; Silbernagel et al. 1984 a, b, 1986; Kwan and Yen 1979; Fowler et al. 1987; Krevelen 1993, and references therein; Więckowski et al. 2000; Binet et al. 2002; Ikoma et al. 2002; Davidson 2004; Liu et al. 2014; Zhou et al. 2017).

In this study, the relationship between maceral composition and coal permeability in Tazareh and Parvadeh mines has been studied. Accordingly, a laboratory studies to investigate the relationship between coal composition and coal permeability was done. In coal samples, with MFORR equipment the permeability test was done. With microscopic analysis, the maceral contents of coal such as Inertinite and Vitrinite have been measured. Accordingly, many coal samples of Parvadeh and Tazareh coal mines have the pyrite as the dominant mineral matter. Parvadeh coal samples has the average percentage of Vitrinite equal 81. 34 % and 10. 52 % Inertinite. Also, in the Tazareh coal samples in Eastern Alborz coal mines, the average percentage of Vitrinite is 69. 31 % and inertinite is 22. 47 %.

Vitrinite reflectance values are also similar, although the coals at Corbett Creek are situated about 300 m shallower, which points to a rank excursion from Hilt's burial law curves at Corbett Creek. Coals from both areas are within the “oil window”. The Medicine River Seam in the Fenn area has higher total <b>inertinite</b> <b>content</b> and greater proportions of inertodetrinite and detrovitrinite, suggesting that peat deposition occurred in swamps and marshes and were prone to periodic flooding. At Corbett Creek, the Mannville coal seams are characterized by greater concentrations of telo-inertinite, which contributes to coal meso-porosity and the potential for free gas storage in the open cell lumens, and to an increased gas flow along lithotype boundaries (horizontal permeability).

The coal reflectogram has been used to characterize the chemical properties of coal and its resultant char structure. In this study, six Australian coals varying in rank were separated using density separation technique to obtain vitrinite and inertinite rich fractions. Chars were obtained from these density fraction samples in a Drop Tube Furnace (DTF) at 1673 K. The reactivity of the chars was measured non-isothermally in a Thermal Gravimetric Analysis (TGA) in the temperature range of 573 - 1073 K. The results suggested that with the increase in the coal rank, the maximum reactivity of chars derived from vitrinite rich fractions decreases, while the reactivity of chars derived from inertinite rich fractions decreases with the increase in the <b>inertinite</b> <b>content</b> in samples and has no obvious relationship with rank. The kinetic parameters were derived using data from non-isothermal TGA after accounting for changing in surface area with conversion. The frequency factor is found to decrease with increasing coal FMR, defined as the summation of each reflectance value multiplied by its frequency, for a constant activation energy (E = 146 kJ/mol). This suggests that the behavior of a maceral is characterized primarily by its reflectance distribution instead of the type of its parent coal...|$|E

The biotic changes {{have been attributed to}} extreme greenhouse warming across the Triassic– Jurassic (T–J) boundary caused by massive release of carbon dioxide and/or methane related to extensive volcanism in the Central Atlantic Magmatic Province (CAMP), resulting in a more humid climate with increased storminess and lightning activity. Lightning strikes are considered the primary source of wildfires, producing charcoal, microscopically recognized as inertinite macerals. The presence of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) of pyrolytic origin and allochthonous charcoal in siliciclastic T–J boundary strata has suggested widespread wildfire activity at the time. We have investigated largely autochthonous coal and coaly beds across the T–J boundary in Sweden and Denmark. These beds consist of predominantly organic material from the in situ vegetation in the mires, and as the coaly beds represent a substantial period of time they are excellent environmental archives.

It is anticipated that this would also assist in optimising gasifier operations for the gasification of fine high ash coals for power generation. The research was conducted by correlating the gasification performance of the selected coals and their derived chars against a range of chemical, physical and optical characteristics including mineral and maceral (and specifically <b>inertinite)</b> <b>contents</b> after testing in a pilot scale fluidised bed gasifier. Of specific interest were the changes in chemical microstructures during {{the transformation of the}} various coal macerals to their relevant chars following gasification. Raman spectroscopy and XRD analyses were used to examine the chemical carbon structures and the minerals associated in the coal. The relationship between the organic components and their gasified products (macerals-to-char) and the inorganic components to their gasified products (mineralsto- ash) including their physical structure and behaviour was determined by petrographic analysis. A higher loss of coal reactivity was obtained from vitrinites-rich coals due to a higher degree of structural transformation of carbon in the coal. Inertinite-rich coals experienced a lower loss of coal reactivity and lower degree of structural transformation even with longer residence time. The structural transformation of the macerals is due to realignment of the carbon molecules leading to substantial swelling (enhanced plasticity) in some macerals. Further modification was found to be due to proximity to melted minerals. Furthermore, the gasification performance of low grade coals can be optimised by varying the oxygen content used for coal gasification...|$|R

The principal aim of this thesis is to investigate whether column flotation {{can be used to}} recover saleable, particularly low-ash quality, coal from South African coal fines which are presently discarded. Samples of thickener underflow fines from the Durnacol, Kleinkopje and Greenside Collieries were used in laboratory column testwork. In addition, on-line column trials were performed at the Kleinkopje Colliery. The effects of co 1 umn operating parameters were established using both one-variable-at-a-time testing and fractional factorial design experiments. An investigation into coal slurry conditioning using oil and oil-water dispersions was also undertaken. The results of laboratory and plant column testwork showed {{that it was possible to}} recover the desired quality products from all three of the coal fines samples investigated. For all the coals tested, better grades were obtained at any given yield from column cell flotation than with conventional (batch) froth flotation. The test results also demonstrated that the column cell is best suited to recovering and upgrading the finer (< 75 μm) size fractions. Column performance was found to be strongly affected by the petrographic composition of the coal fines feed, i. e. by coal TYPE. Coals with high vitrinite and, conversely, low <b>inertinite</b> <b>contents</b> were found to be the most easily floatable. Depending on the coal TYPE, the rate of mass transport in either the pulp or froth phase was found to be rate limiting; this in turn dictated which operating parameters affected product yields and grades.

Considerable scope for improvement in coal conditioning lies in better choice of collector and "promotor" reagents as well as in designing more energetically efficient conditioning vessels...|$|R

To better understand this phenomenon, a systematical investigation of water imbibition and drainage was conducted experimentally using high rank coals collected from Qinshui Basin of China. The results show the shapes of the T- 2 spectrum for water imbibition and drainage experiments generally distribute with the bimodal pattern with a higher left peak around 1 ms and a lower right peak around 50 - 100 ms. The cumulative imbibition water content ranges from 3. 09 to 6. 54 vol% under the 0 MPa saturated hydraulic pressure at vacuumed state, which is accounting for 58. 30 - 91. 07 % of total imbibition water content, and grows exponentially with the increasing of saturated hydraulic pressure. The cumulative drainage water content ranges from 0. 53 to 1. 71 vol%, and residual water content varies from 3. 47 to 6. 73 vol%, which latter is accounting for 72. 1 - 88. 46 % of the total imbibition water content. The imbibition and drainage water contents increase with the total pore volume increasing. The well-developed macropores and mesopores increase the drainage water content and rate, while the micropores mainly contribute to the residual water content. The cumulative imbibition water content is positively related to <b>inertinite</b> <b>content</b> but negatively related to ratio of vitrinite to inertinite and ash yield, whereas it is just the opposite for drainage water content and rate.

Despite the apparent fiery nature of much contemporary vegetation, terrestrial fossil evidence would suggest {{we live in}} a time of low fire activity relative to the deep past. The <b>inertinite</b> <b>content</b> of coal, fossil charcoal, is strikingly low from the Eocene to the Pleistocene and no charcoalified mesofossils have been reported for the Cenozoic. Marine cores have been analysed for charcoal in the North Pacific, the north and south Atlantic off Africa, and the south China sea. These tell a different story with the oldest records indicating low levels of fire activity from the Eocene but a surge of fire from the late Miocene (~ 7 Ma). Phylogenetic studies of woody plants adapted to frequent savanna fires show them beginning to appear from the Late Miocene with peak origins in the late Pliocene in both South American and African lineages. Phylogenetic studies indicate ancient origins (60 Ma+) for clades characteristic of flammable sclerophyll vegetation from Australia and the Cape region of South Africa. However, as for savannas, there was a surge of speciation from the Late Miocene associated with the retreat of closed fire-intolerant forests. The wide geographic spread of increased fire activity in the last few million years suggests a global cause. However none of the potential global factors (oxygen, rainfall seasonality, CO 2, novel flammable growth forms) provides an adequate explanation as yet. The global patterns and processes of fire and flammable vegetation in the Cenozoic, especially since the Late Miocene, deserve much more attention to better understand fire in the earth system...|$|E

The exploration degree, particularly in situ gas content estimation of low-rank CBM reservoirs in China, is extremely low. Meanwhile, adsorption characteristics of low-rank coal reservoirs have not been revealed comprehensively. In this study, methane isothermal adsorption experiments of 30 low-rank coal samples collected from typical low-rank coal-bearing basins and coalfields in China were performed under different temperatures and moisture-equilibrated conditions. The {{results showed that the}} Langmuir volume, which was found to be relatively low when the <b>inertinite</b> <b>content</b> was above 50 % and relatively high when the vitrinite content was above 50 %, was positively correlated with the maximum vitrinite reflectance and generally decreased with the increase of the equilibrium moisture content. The adsorbed gas content decreased as the temperature increased, while the relationship between methane adsorption decrement and pressure was described by logarithmic form. The in situ adsorbed gas content of low-rank coal reservoirs increased slightly or almost unchanged with the increase of the burial depth. These characteristics were quite different from those of middle- or high-rank coal reservoirs, and the calculation method for estimation of the in situ absorbed gas content was validated to be correct based on a comparative analysis between the calculated results and actual test results.

40|$|AbstractMultiple sets {{of thick}} coal beds {{characterized}} by simple structure and shallow burial depth {{were developed in}} the Early and Middle Jurassic strata of the Ordos Basin, northwestern China. The huge reserves of this high quality coal have a high commercial value. We studied the coal’s petrologic characteristics and its maceral distribution to determine the maceral’s contribution to generation of oil and gas. The {{results show that the}} Jurassic coals in the Ordos Basin have special petrological features because of the Basin’s unique depositional environment which was mainly a series of high-stand swamps in the upper fluvial system. These petrographic features are a result of the development of typical inland lakes where some sand bodies were formed by migrating rivers. After burial, the peat continued to undergo oxidizing conditions, this process generated extensive higher <b>inertinite</b> <b>contents</b> in the coals and the vitrinite components were altered to semi-vitrinite. The macroscopic petrographic types of these Jurassic coals are mainly semi-dull coal, dull coal, semilustrous and lustrous coal. The proportions of semi-dull coal and dull coal are higher in the basin margins, especially in the area near the northern margin. The numbers of semilustrous and lustrous coals increase southwards and towards the central basin. This situation indicates that different coal-forming swamp environments have major controlling effects on the coal components. Another observation is that in the Ordos’ coal sequences, especially in the lower part, some sandstone beds are thick, up to 20  m with a coarse grain size. The higher fusinite content in the macerals accompanies a higher semi-vitrinite content with more complete and regular plant cell structure. The fusinite structure is clear and well preserved. After burial, the lithology of the roof and floor rocks can continue to affect the evolution of coal petrology. The sand bodies in the roof and floor exhibit good physical conditions so that pore water can maintain a long-term state of oxidation, circulation and connection to the coal. So coal components remain in an oxidation environment for a long time. Conversely, in the basin center, lacustrine facies developed and peat was rapidly covered by mudstone after burial and subsequent coal beds rapidly entered a reducing environment. As a result, abundant gelatification occurred and the vitrinite content increased. Exinite often accumulated in a specific position in the coal bed. Although the average exinite content is not high on the whole, it does significantly contribute to the total hydrocarbon generation. The exinite content has been underestimated, especially the amorphous bituminous fluid and its importance is emphasized here. The reason is that the fluid flows easily into fusinite which has strong rigidity, or flows into some fissures, where it is commonly neglected...|$|R
40|$|South Africa {{remains the}} 5 th largest {{producer}} and 4 th {{largest exporter of}} coal in the world. It is also the largest supplier of coal to the European Union. This fact is significant as the European Union has recently supported the environmental lobby that threatens the combined full scale use of coal in Europe and other first world countries. This promotes the development of clean coal technologies in order to counter the ever increasing number of environmental constraints threatening the export market. One critical development in clean coal technologies is coal beneficiation, which allows the reduction of ash and inert content. Permian coals from South Africa have characteristically high ash and <b>inertinite</b> <b>contents</b> and therefore require further beneficiation. The Witbank coalfield No. 4 seam is no exception. It {{can be described as}} being more inert and having a higher mineral content compared to the No. 2 seam in the same coalfield also mined for export purposes. With the increase in environmental legislation and the push towards “clean coal” this raises a concern in terms of the performance and marketability of export coal produced from the No. 4 seam. This seam will in the future be economically significant and is still a great source for export steam coal. Due to the nature and composition of the No. 4 seam, coal beneficiation is essential to reduce the mineral and inert content to be in line with export quality specification levels. Washability characteristics of the No. 4 seam coal indicate that the No. 4 seam is difficult to beneficiate. Until recently the main clean-ability parameters evaluated in South African export coals as per customer specification included mainly heating value, moisture and ash reduction with little to no work being done on trace element concentration reduction. This paper focuses on the partitioning of the trace elements within the seam in relation to the organic and inorganic affinity of the trace elements and possible methods of trace element reduction by removal using coal beneficiation techniques. The techniques investigated include reduction by washing using dense medium beneficiation and flotation. In each evaluation the focus was on trace-element-tomineral and trace-element-to-organic matter relationship and hence setting the basis for liberation analysis to evaluate reducibility. By the evaluation of the coal mineralogy, petrography and trace element relationships, methods of optimum trace element reduction can be established. With the focus on marketing it was shown that carbon loss need not be sacrificed in the reduction of specific trace elements in the No. 4 seam and that the trace element distribution itself allows for beneficiation whilst maintaining acceptable yields. Processes and possible beneficiation techniques for optimum trace element reduction and marketability {{in the case of the}} No. 4 seam are proposed...|$|R

The macroscopic petrographic types of these Jurassic coals are mainly semi-dull coal, dull coal, semilustrous and lustrous coal. The proportions of semi-dull coal and dull coal are higher in the basin margins, especially in the area near the northern margin. The numbers of semilustrous and lustrous coals increase southwards and towards the central basin. This situation indicates that different coal-forming swamp environments have major controlling effects on the coal components. Another observation is that in the Ordos’ coal sequences, especially in the lower part, some sandstone beds are thick, up to 20  m with a coarse grain size. The higher fusinite content in the macerals accompanies a higher semi-vitrinite content with more complete and regular plant cell structure. The fusinite structure is clear and well preserved. After burial, the lithology of the roof and floor rocks can continue to affect the evolution of coal petrology. The sand bodies in the roof and floor exhibit good physical conditions so that pore water can maintain a long-term state of oxidation, circulation and connection to the coal. So coal components remain in an oxidation environment for a long time. Conversely, in the basin center, lacustrine facies developed and peat was rapidly covered by mudstone after burial and subsequent coal beds rapidly entered a reducing environment. As a result, abundant gelatification occurred and the vitrinite content increased. Exinite often accumulated in a specific position in the coal bed. Although the average exinite content is not high on the whole, it does significantly contribute to the total hydrocarbon generation. The exinite content has been underestimated, especially the amorphous bituminous fluid and its importance is emphasized here. The reason is that the fluid flows easily into fusinite which has strong rigidity, or flows into some fissures, where it is commonly neglected...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe Betsie Shale Member is a {{relatively}} thick and continuous unit {{that serves as a}} marker bed across the central Appalachian basin, in part because it includes an organic-rich shale unit at its base that is observable in drill logs. Deposited during a marine transgression, the Betsie Shale Member has been correlated to units in both Wales and Germany and has been proposed to mark the boundary between the Lower and Middle Pennsylvanian Series within North America. This investigation assigns a new Re–Os date {{to the base of the}} Betsie and examines the palynoflora and maceral composition of the underlying Matewan coal bed in the context of that date. The Matewan coal bed contains abundant lycopsid tree spores along its base with assemblage diversity and <b>inertinite</b> <b>content</b> increasing upsection, as sulfur content and ash yield decrease. Taken together, these palynologic and organic petrographic results suggest a submerged paleomire that transitioned to an exposed peat surface. Notably, separating the lower and upper benches of the Matewan is a parting with very high sulfur content (28 wt. %), perhaps representing an early marine pulse prior to the full on transgression responsible for depositing the Betsie. Results from Re–Os geochronology date the base of the Betsie at 323 ± 7. 8 Ma, consistent with previously determined age constraints as well as the palynoflora assemblage presented herein. The Betsie Shale Member is also highly enriched in Re (ranging from 319. 7 to 1213 ng/g), with high 187 Re/ 188 Os values ranging from 3644 to 5737 likely resultant from varying redox conditions between the pore water and overlying water column during deposition and early condensing of the section...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe Mannville coals in the Fenn area, Alberta Plains, have {{desorbed}} {{gas content}} averaging 8. 57 cm 3 /g (275 scf/t), {{which is similar}} to the same coals in the Corbett Creek area, almost 400 km away. Vitrinite reflectance values are also similar, although the coals at Corbett Creek are situated about 300 m shallower, which points to a rank excursion from Hilt's burial law curves at Corbett Creek. Coals from both areas are within the “oil window”. The Medicine River Seam in the Fenn area has higher total <b>inertinite</b> <b>content</b> and greater proportions of inertodetrinite and detrovitrinite, suggesting that peat deposition occurred in swamps and marshes and were prone to periodic flooding. At Corbett Creek, the Mannville coal seams are characterized by greater concentrations of telo-inertinite, which contributes to coal meso-porosity and the potential for free gas storage in the open cell lumens, and to an increased gas flow along lithotype boundaries (horizontal permeability). Non-fluorescing vitrinite was present mostly in the upper Medicine River Seam, which was deposited in a regressive environment. The lower Medicine River Seam, which formed during a marine transgressive phase, contained greater amounts of fluorescing vitrinite. The Mannville coals in the Fenn area are moderately under-pressured in relation to those at Corbett Creek, which may have an impact on gas retention capacity. The difference in absolute coal permeability (1 - 3. 5 mD at Fenn versus 3 - 4 mD at Corbett Creek), which is likely the result of higher in-situ stresses in the deeper Mannville coals at Fenn, has had an effect on both gas and water production rates from these coals. However, the largest impact on gas production volumes has been made by the application of horizontal drilling technology, initially at Fenn, and more recently by multiple horizontal wells drilled at Corbett Creek...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe {{character}} of the coal in Tomago and Greta coal measures are similar to other coals from the Sydney Coal Basin, with variation from vitrinite-rich to inertinite-rich coal. A type III organic matter (OM) linked to continental higher plants and a perhydrous type III similar to type II were found by Rock-Eval analysis. The coexistence of inertinite with algae (Botryococcus) in the Greta coals explains the high HI in the perhydrous type. The Gangamopteris flora that is reported in the Greta coal measures, grew after plants in a taiga like the recent birch forests in Russia (Retallack, 1980). The Glossopteris flora that is reported in the Tomago coal measures, grew in a swamp forest. Based upon the botanic zonation, this flora was located in the cold temperate biome that was located in Gondwanaland, except for Antarctica {{which was in the}} glacial biome. Diterpane analysis results reveal alternation of wet and dry periods existed during the deposition of Lewis coals in the Greta coal measures during the Kungurian, and an increase of dryness is noted from Upper Donaldson to Beresfield in the Tomago coal measures during the Capitanian. Based on analysis of aromatics and diterpanes, the same periods of dryness and wetness alternate during the coal deposition in the Sydney Coal Basin. These climatic changes correspond to high frequency cycles (< 100 ka, Goldhammer et al., 1994). The presence of aromatics linked with combustion in the studied samples confirms the hypothesis of fire in peat land to explain high <b>inertinite</b> <b>content.</b> A low to medium biodegradation by bacteria was observed for saturates and aromatics from the studied samples as noted previously in the Sydney and Bowen Basins. This biodegradation concerns short chain n-alkanes, naphtalenes and phenanthrenes and does not alter the paleoenvironmental and paleodimatic interpretation.

40|$|Anthracites are the {{preferred}} reductant for utilization in the ilmenite smelting industry mainly {{due to the}} higher fixed carbon units, lower sulphur contents and relatively lower impurities found in the mineral matter content. The {{primary purpose of the}} reductant used in the process is to affect reduction of iron oxide forms and titanium oxide forms to yield a product of a low Mn pig iron (LMPI) and a slag containing titanium dioxide and iron oxide. Industrial test work on various anthracites were undertaken to obtain a better understanding of reductant performance and their effect on process efficiency. The tests were designed to establish reductant efficiency per reductant type as a function of its petrographic characteristics, its influence on a mass and energy balance scale as applied to furnace energy algorithms and its contribution to the smelter Value In Use (VIU) total cost model. Good correlations were found to exist between the vitrinite content and reductant efficiency. Lower reductant efficiencies are associated with higher vitrinite contents. The mechanism of reductant loss, expressed as carbon efficiency, seems {{to be related to the}} shattering of anthracite when exposed to furnace freeboard conditions at approximately 1600 °C in the presence of inherent and surface moisture associated with the reductant. The d 50 particle sizes between the reductants were found to be very similar due to a deliberate size processing step prior to the reductant utilization. Although no good correlation was found between d 50 and reductant efficiency, a fair correlation exists between the - 1 mm particles and reductant efficiency. A finer size fraction has a higher propensity to escape from the offgas and report to losses. A reduction in dissolved carbon in the metal for a decrease in TiO 2 percentage in the slag was found to occur in all likelihood as a result of a combination of carbon losses occurring due to decrepitation and reporting to dust losses or insufficient carbon units added initially. A strong linear dependence exists between reductant ratio percentage and TiO 2 percentages in the slag. A strong linear dependence exists between theoretical energy requirements for varying reductant percentages. It was found that the reductant requirements are strongly dependent on reductant fixed carbon and reductant efficiency. The carbon percentage in the metal is generally an order of magnitude higher than calculated equilibrium carbon percentage in the metal, indicating that non equilibrium conditions prevail in the metal bath. Higher carbon content and lower vitrinite content anthracites performed better on overall Value In Use model due to the following reasons:  Higher carbon efficiencies associated with lower vitrinite or rather higher <b>inertinite</b> <b>contents</b> lead to the use of lower proportions of reductants to obtain the desired chemistry in the product.  Higher carbon efficiencies were also found to require less energy to obtain final product.  Lower energy inputs lead to increasing the overall raw material feed input and ultimately increasing the final product output.  Lower treatment costs of low manganese pig iron occurred due to lower portions of reductant, less impurities (sulphur) as a result of lower mineral matter in the reductant and higher excess carbon in the low manganese pig iron product...|$|R
30|$|Heidaigou coal is a {{low-rank}} {{bituminous coal}} {{with a high}} ash content. The sulfur content is low and dominated by pyritic sulfur. The Al 2 O 3 content is high while SiO 2 is relatively low in the ash. This results a high ash fusion temperature. The mine {{is located at the}} north edge of the carboniferous-permian coal accumulation basin in Northern China. The vitrinite content is lower than the average of the area while the <b>inertinite</b> and liptinite <b>contents</b> are higher (Han 1996). The dominant vitrinite macerals are telocollinite and desmocollinite. A small amount of telinite is also present. The liptinite group is mainly represented by sporinite, which disperses in the desmocollinite and in the matrix of the inertinite in the bedding direction. Fragmental fusinite usually mixes with semifusinite. The main microlithotypes are vitrite, trimacerite and durite while a small amount of clarite, inertrite and vitrinertite are present. Vitrite is usually uniform while trimacerite is fragmental or of lineation shape. Durite is composed of an inertinite matrix and a clastic texture.|$|R
30|$|The studied coals samples (K 1 –K 11, Table  3) are high-volatile {{bituminous}} in rank, with variable mineralization {{and high}} vitrinite, variable inertinite and low liptinite contents, while the reflectance Rr varies between 0.65 % and 0.69 %. The {{collection of samples}} comprises three samples of unaltered coal (K 1 –K 3), four samples of altered coal (K 4 –K 7) and four samples of altered coal with mylonite structures and microbreccia (K 8 –K 11). Unaltered coals show as their typical features a dominant content of vitrinite, high <b>content</b> of <b>inertinite</b> and low <b>content</b> of minerals (carbonates). The alteration of the coal organic mass is manifested by the weaker intensity of the fluorescence of liptinite macerals (Stach et al. 1982; Pickel et al. 2017). For further consideration, {{it is important that}} the thermal alteration significantly increases the Rr values, on the contrary, the low thermal and oxidative alteration changes the Rr only slightly (Klika and Krausová 1993; Klika 1999; Klika and Osovský 1999), but changes in the reflectance of collotelinite should also be considered. Samples K 8 –K 11 show mylonite structures as well as microbreccia, which are typical symptoms of microtectonics and thermal and oxidative alteration (Klika and Krausová 1993; Gayer et al. 1996; Sýkorová et al. 1996) due to hydrothermal fluids.|$|R
40|$|Thirteen Late Permian subbituminous coal seams (numbered 68 - 94) were sampled {{from the}} Kuznetsk Basin, Russia. The coals formed in {{extensive}} long-lived peat- forming (mire) environments on floodplains {{as part of}} a fluvial system (Davies et aI., 2010). Fossil plants (permineralised, charcoalified or impressions) show characteristics consistent with cordaitaleans, which ~ere the dominant peat-forming plants in Angara during the Permian. Crushed coal samples show temporal variation in inertinite (charcoal content) from 7. 1 % - 50. 2 %, with a high overall mean of 28. 3 %. More detailed petrographic work was carried out on five in situ coal pillars (seams 78, 88 and 91) where inertinite distribution was used to interpret palaeowildfire occurrence and type as well as providing an approach to calculating fire return intervals (FR!) in deep time. In situ pillars are essential for this type of research as they retain the original spatial and temporal variation in inertinite distribution. Inertinite is present in all lithotype units (up to 61 % mineral matter free basis). The coal pillars show comparable wildfire histories despite differences in environments of deposition. In addition, FR! may have been more frequent in the Permian than in modem peat-forming environments. Quantitative reflectance of macroscopic and microscopic (inertodetrinite) charcoal in coal pillars has revealed that both size fractions are within the temperature range of modem low temperature surface fires. However, a small amount of the charcoal reflectance values are > 4 %Ro and may in fact represent charcoal derived from high temperature crown fires. This demonstrates the importance of reflectance measurements of both macro- and microscopic charcoal in interpretation of palaeowildfire type. Despite inertinite contents of up to 61 % in these Permian coals, neither <b>inertinite</b> <b>content</b> nor distribution strongly affects the characterisation (proximate and ultimate) properties of the coal as a whole. However, coals with high inertinite contents (> 30 %) do produce denser chars and show poorer burnout during pilot-scale Drop Tube Furnace (DTF) combustion experiments.

40|$|Za izračunavanje emisije ugljikova dioksida zbog izgaranja ugljena, emisijski faktor CO 2 važan je ulazni parametar. Referentni emisijski faktori prema Uputama Međuvladinog tijela za klimatske promjene iz 2006. godine (engl. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, IPCC) specificirani su prema stupnju pougljenja (coal rank), ali se pri izradi nacionalnog izvješća o stakleničkim plinovima preporučuje primjena nacionalnih emisijskih faktora. Sadržaj ugljika najvažnije je svojstvo ugljena i pokazatelj je stupnja pougljenja (karbonizacije). Međutim mnoga svojstva ugljena vrlo su specifična (npr. sadržaj sumpora, pepela, vlage i macerala) te emisijski faktori CO 2 ugljena ne ovise samo o stupnju pougljenja već i o njegovu geografskom porijeklu. U preliminarnom istraživanju, temeljem podataka dobivenih analizom goriva, izračunati su emisijski faktori CO 2 za ugljene i treset s područja Livna, BiH: 147, 9 t TJ− 1 za treset, 109, 5 t TJ− 1 za lignit i 98, 7 t TJ− 1 za smeđi ugljen, što odgovara sljedećim donjim ogrjevnim vrijednostima (Hd) : 3, 6 MJ kg− 1, 11, 5 MJ kg− 1 i 20, 6 MJ kg− 1. Razlika u ogrjevnoj vrijednosti može se djelomično objasniti različitim udjelom ukupne vlage u ispitivanim uzorcima. Usporedba izračunatih emisijskih faktora s referentnim vrijednostima, pokazala je najveća odstupanja kod treseta (39, 5 %), potom kod lignita (8, 2 %) i smeđeg ugljena (4, 3 %). Emission {{factors are}} used in {{greenhouse}} gas inventories to estimate emissions from coal combustion. In the absence of direct measures, emissions factors are frequently used as a quick, low cost way to estimate emissions values. Coal combustion {{has been a major}} contributor to the CO 2 flux into the atmosphere. Nearly all of the fuel carbon (99 %) in coal is converted to CO 2 during the combustion process. The carbon content is the most important coal parameter which is the measure of the degree of coalification (coal rank). Coalification is the alteration of vegetation to form peat, succeeded by the transformation of peat through lignite, sub-bituminous, bituminous to anthracite coal. During the geochemical or metamorphic stage, the progressive changes that occur within the coal are an increase in the carbon content and a decrease in the hydrogen and oxygen content resulting in a loss of volatiles. Heterogeneous composition of coal causes variation in CO 2 emission from different coals. The IPCC (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change) has produced guidelines on how to produce emission inventories which includes emission factors. Although 2006 IPCC Guidelines provided the default values specified according to the rank of the coal, the application of country-specific emission factors was recommended when estimating the national greenhouse gas emissions. This paper discusses the differences between country-specific emission factors and default IPCC CO 2 emission factors, EF(CO 2), for coals. Also, this study estimated EF(CO 2) for two different types of coals and peat from B&H, on the basis fuel analyses. Carbon emission factors for coal mainly depend on the carbon content of the fuel and vary with both rank and geographic origin, which supports the idea of provincial variation of carbon emission factors. Also, various other factors, such as content of sulphur, minerals and macerals play an important role and influence EF(CO 2) from coal. Carbonate minerals (calcite and siderite) directly contribute CO 2 when they decompose during coal combustion. Variations in the maceral content can also influence CO 2 emissions; high <b>inertinite</b> <b>contents</b> increase CO 2 emissions. Sulphur in coal reduces EF(CO 2). Fuel analysis is very important when estimating greenhouse gas emissions and emission factors. In this preliminary study, {{based on the results of}} the fuel analysis, CO 2 emission factors for coals and peat from Livno, B&H have been calculated. EF(CO 2) is defined as the amount of carbon dioxide emission per unit net calorific values of the fuel. Net calorific value (the lower heating value) corresponds to the heat produced by combustion where total water in the combustion products exists as water vapour. The EF(CO 2) obtained for sub-bituminous coal, lignite and peat were: 98. 7, 109. 5, and 147. 9 t TJ− 1, respectively, which correspond to the following net calorific values: 20. 6, 11. 5 and 3. 6 MJ kg− 1. The heating value is generally known to increase with the increase in carbon content (this parameter is connected with the degree of coalification, coal age). The other indispensable parameters are hydrogen, which has a positive effect on the net calorific value, and oxygen and water which impact the net calorific value negatively. The differences in net calorific values can be explained in part by the difference of total moisture content among the different fuel types. The CO 2 emission factors calculated in this study were compared with those of IPCC. A significant difference was observed for peat (39. 5 %), followed by lignite (8. 2 %) and sub-bituminous coal (4. 3 %) ...|$|R
40|$|Highveld parent coal {{was crushed}} into three size fractions, namely: 5 mm– 75 mm, 5 mm– 53 mm, and 5 – 37. 5 mm. The crushed samples were {{subjected}} as feed coals to heating in a packed-bed reactor {{to investigate the}} influence of particle size reduction on char formation and reactivity. Coal petrography was utilized to assess the maceral and char formation distribution of the feed coal samples and their packed-bed combustion unit’s products. The maceral distribution of the feed coal fractions differed from the typical run-of-mine Highveld coal petrographic composition; the smallest size fractions (53 mm and 37. 5 mm) having the highest vitrinite content. Maceral distribution was further divided into total reactive maceral particles, total inert maceral particles, and total inertinite particles. The 53 mm and 37. 5 mm feed coal samples had the highest total reactive maceral particle content. Inert char particles dominated in the packed-bed combustion unit samples due to high <b>inertinite</b> maceral group <b>content</b> of the Highveld coals. Unexpectedly, the 53 mm feed coal sample had higher content of total reactive maceral particles and lower content of total inert maceral particles; whereas the 37. 5 mm feed coal sample had high content of reactive maceral particles and high content of total inert maceral particles. This variation in maceral group content lead to the 53 mm feed coal sample being more reactive (producing more devolatilized and porous chars and thus reacting faster with reactant gases) than the 37. 5 mm feed coal sample. This was due to inert maceral particles restricting the 37. 5 mm feed coal sample from fully softening and reacting with reactant gas. This was also this was attributed to variation in volatile propagation of the three particle sizes. This confirms that a feed coal with smaller particle sizes results in different reactivity, char formation, and better heat transfer during combustion than the feed coal with large particle size range. Another important factor that {{plays a role in}} combustion is maceral association; it was observed that maceral distribution has a great influence on the char formation and its reactivity more than coal particle size.
