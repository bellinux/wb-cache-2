Kitty Hawk, although remote, was closer to Dayton than other places Chanute had suggested, including California and Florida. The spot also gave them privacy <b>from</b> <b>reporters,</b> who had turned the 1896 Chanute experiments at Lake Michigan into something of a circus. Chanute visited them in camp each season from 1901 to 1903 and saw gliding experiments, but not the powered flights.|$|E

Dewey, Vandenberg and Taft had large public headquarters, but Willkie's campaign was run from clandestine rooms at the Benjamin Franklin Hotel. Root's Willkie Clubs and other supporters bombarded the delegates with telegrams urging support for their candidate, to the annoyance of some. Key convention officials were Willkie supporters; these included House Minority Leader Joe Martin, Massachusetts' favorite son and permanent chairman of the convention. When the head of the Committee on Arrangements, Ralph Williams (deemed likely to support Taft) died just before the convention, he was succeeded by the vice chairman, Sam Pryor, a firm Willkie backer.

To promote the book, Trump held a January 5 press conference at Trump Tower, which aired on C-SPAN. [...] He signed books and answered questions <b>from</b> <b>reporters,</b> once asserting, [...] "I {{may be too}} honest to be a politician." [...] Trump's book, consisting of 286 pages, covers Trump's political positions and policy proposals, including strict anti-crime measures, increased pressure on China, fair trade, border control, increased military spending, support for public capital punishment, and the implementation of single-payer health care. [...] It advocates eliminating soft money contributions to political parties and full disclosure of campaign donations to political candidates, but calls {{for the removal of}} limits on the amount of donations, arguing, [...] "f you want to give your life savings to Al Gore, that should be between you, Al Gore and your psychiatrist." [...] In addition, it raises concerns about terrorism, proposing the creation of a national lottery to raise funds for anti-terrorism programs, and offers a choice to North Korea to disarm or face military strikes. [...] The America We Deserve also includes praise for former boxer Muhammad Ali, Teamsters leader James P. Hoffa, as well as Trump's future political opponents Florida governor Jeb Bush and New York governor George Pataki, among others. It cites friendships with baseball player Sammy Sosa and entertainer Sean Combs as making Trump more understanding of racial diversity. Trump later backpedaled his book's praise of Combs after Combs was charged with violating gun laws following a shooting at a New York nightclub. [...] Trump said he did not [...] "know [...] really well." [...] The book condemns Congressman Jerrold Nadler as a [...] "hack" [...] for opposing Trump's development of waterfront real estate in Manhattan, and describes Senator Bob Smith as [...] "the dumbest guy in the U.S. Senate" [...] after he grilled Trump's sister Maryanne Trump Barry on abortion when she testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee in 1999 upon her nomination to the Third Circuit Court of Appeals.

[...] It also notes the hypocrisy of both an unnamed Senator and an unnamed conservative columnist who each engaged in extramarital affairs at Trump's hotels and resorts while they attacked President Clinton for the Lewinsky scandal. [...] In a scathing review, New York Magazine described the book as inadvertently satirical. Booklist pondered whether Trump was [...] "the only man ever to run for president in order to promote a book."
