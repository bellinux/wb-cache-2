50|$|Yangi Xiaonan criticised {{two points}} of Li's {{opinion on the}} issues of the NPCSC's power of interpretation. The CFA, in {{accepting}} the NPCSC's authority to interpret the Basic Law, stated that it arose from Article 67(4) of the 1982 Constitution of the People's Republic of China. However, the CFA also stated that the NPCSC interpretation, being of <b>judicial</b> <b>character,</b> had a retrospective effect and was thus applicable from 1 July 1997. Yang sees these two assertions as inherently contradictory: if the NPCSC's power of interpretation arises {{in the way that the}} CFA claims it does from the PRC constitution, then such interpretations should be of legislative rather than <b>judicial</b> <b>character,</b> and thus are non-retrospective. He also pointed out that Basic Law 158(3) explicitly states that NPCSC interpretations do not affect judgments previously rendered.|$|R

2500|$|The plaintiffs {{argument}} involved two propositions, that judicial {{power could}} only be exercised [...] by a Chapter III Court, and that the removal and detention of people was <b>exclusively</b> a <b>judicial</b> power. [...] That the federal judicial power {{could only be}} exercised by a court followed the 1915 decision of the High Court in New South Wales v Commonwealth (The Wheat Case), that {{the structure of the}} Constitution required the strict insulation of judicial power such that only a court established under Chapter III of the constitution can exercise the judicial power of the Commonwealth. The reasoning in the Wheat Case was taken further in Waterside Workers' Federation of Australia v J W Alexander Ltd where a majority of judges, Griffith CJ, Barton, Isaacs, Powers and Rich JJ, held that the power to enforce awards, being convictions for offences and the imposition of penalties and punishments, were matters appertaining <b>exclusively</b> to <b>judicial</b> power. The High Court reinforced the doctrine in the Boilermakers' Case, holding that only a Chapter III Court could exercise judicial powers and that a Chapter III Court was only permitted to exercise judicial power. It had previously been held however that the territories were not a part of that federal judicial power.|$|R

The concept of detention as an <b>exclusively</b> <b>judicial</b> function was clearly articulated by only three judges out of seven, Brennan, Deane and Dawson, and although in later cases that central concept was generally agreed with, their list of exceptions was not.

But I am not presently persuaded that legislation authorizing detention in circumstances involving no breach of the criminal law and travelling beyond presently accepted categories is necessarily and inevitably offensive to Ch.III."The respondents also noted that Gaudron made similar comments in the Stolen Generations case, which also considered non-judicial detention in the context of Aboriginal children who were forcibly removed from their parents' care. For this reason and others, they argued that the power to detain people for the purposes of criminal trial and punishment (as opposed to detention generally) was clearly a judicial function, but there is no general rule and other powers to detain may not offend Chapter III.|$|R
40|$|The {{topic of}} this thesis is the {{discretion}} of the International Court of Justice (ICJ) in its advisory proceedings. It gives an analysis of the possibility for the ICJ to decline to give an advisory opinion. This discretion is guided by the Court's character as a principal organ of the UN, and the Court's <b>judicial</b> <b>character</b> when giving the advisory opinions. The discretionary power of the Court is, in particular, analysed in view of the recent case concerning the Legal Consequences of the Construction of a Wall in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, given by the ICJ on July 9, 2004 (the Wall opinion). The thesis gives an introduction to the history and fuction of the ICJ. It also contains a summary of the Wall opinion and the arguments put forward in this case when contending that the Court should exercise its discretion and refuse to give an opinion. These arguments are discussed and analysed in view of relevant statements and previous practice of the Court. In addition, the theis looks at the effect of advisory opinions and possibilities of extending the jurisdiction of the ICJ...|$|R
40|$|This {{contribution}} {{examines the}} treatment of preliminary questions of competence and propriety in the Legal Consequences of the Construction of a Wall in the Occupied Palestinian Territory opinion. These aspects rises some important problems which concern the relationships among the principal organs of the United Nations: a) between General Assembly and Security Council as to {{the validity of the}} request according to article 12 of the Charter (and hence as to the competence of the Court to issue the opinion); and b) between the International Court of Justice and the Security Council as to the propriety of the exercise by the Court of its consultative function on a question which is also relevant for the Security Council's responsibility to maintain international peace and security. While some commentators note that the principle that the ICJ must participate {{in the work of the}} Organisation might sometimes conflict with its <b>judicial</b> <b>character,</b> the author argues that "the delivery of the advisory opinion by the court should be positively valued in the perspective of enhancing the main role of the ICJ's advisory function in clarifying the law and providing guidance for future action by the UN organs...|$|R

The act gave the Governor General in Council the power to make rules [...] for the purpose of securing the public safety and the defence of British India and as to the powers and duties of public servants and other persons in furtherance of that purpose... Considerable pressure for the passage of the act was from Michael O'Dwyer particularly in light of the Ghadr threat. Answering to Sir Surendranath Bannerjee in the legislative assembly, Craddock denied any necessity or propriety for the government to constitute an advisory board of <b>judicial</b> <b>character</b> that would deal with the applications of the act. In this regard the law differed from the Defence of the Realm act. Craddock explained to the assembly that the lack of judicial oversight and advice were acceptable since the restrictive measures in the act were [...] "preventive and not punitive in measures".|$|R
500|$|Garrow's first {{judicial}} appointment came in 1814, when he {{was made}} Chief Justice of Chester. This was opposed by Sir Samuel Romilly, who argued that the positions of Chief Justice and Attorney General were incompatible, saying [...] "to appoint a gentleman holding a lucrative office at the sole pleasure of the Crown to a high judicial situation, was extremely inconsistent with that independence of the <b>judicial</b> <b>character</b> which it {{was so important to}} preserve inviolate". On 6 May 1817, Garrow was made a Baron of the Exchequer and Serjeant-at-Law, succeeding Richard Richards, and resigning his seat in Parliament and his position as Attorney General. He was not a particularly distinguished judge in the Exchequer, mainly {{due to a lack of}} knowledge of the finer points of law. Practising on the Assize Circuits, however, was a different matter; dealing with his more familiar criminal law rather than the commercial law of the Exchequer, Garrow performed far better. Braby indicates that he regularly amazed both barristers and defendants with his knowledge of the intricacies of crime. Garrow retired on 22 February 1832, replaced by John Gurney, and was made a Privy Councillor on retirement as a measure of the Government's respect for him. He died at home on 14 September 1840, aged 80.|$|R

5000|$|There {{is little}} {{information}} about Benedikt Rejt from historical sources. The dates {{of birth and}} death are unclear {{as well as the}} place of origin or early life activity (Mencl guesses the River Inn, probably Burghausen). All the knowledge of his life comes from a few documents, especially those of a <b>judicial</b> <b>character.</b> From these sources it is obvious that Benedikt Rejt was a renowned architect and baumeister (magister operis, [...] "master builder") whose opinion was highly valued at court, where he was called to review work of other contemporary architects. As early as 1489 (when he was asked to review the work of Matěj Rejsek), he was considered an authority in the field of architecture. This fact supports the surmise that he had created some of the masterpieces built before that year with unclear authorship. In addition, Prague, Most, Kutná Hora, and Annaberg (the latter two were silver-mining centres at that time) were among the richest cities of Central Europe, and it is likely that only the best architects were invited to work there. After 1500 he was often referred to as Master Benedikt and a Prague architect and stonemason hired by the Crown. There is also a theory that Benedikt Rejt can be identified with Benedykt Sandomierski, who rebuilt Piotrków Trybunalski Castle (1519) and other buildings in Poland (Borowska 2004).|$|R

Nothing exceeded the violence of some of the managers, except their impotence. They were bewildered by their passions, and by their want of knowledge or want of consideration of the subject. The more they advanced, the further they found themselves from their object.--All things ran into confusion. The ministers quarrelled among themselves. They disclaimed one another. They suspended violence, and shrunk from treaty. The inquiry was almost at its last gasp; when some active persons of the Company were given to understand that this hostile proceeding was only set up in terrorem; that government was far from an intention of seizing upon the possessions of the Company. Administration, they said, was sensible, that the idea was in every light full of absurdity; and that such a seizure was not more out of their power, than remote from their wishes; and therefore, if the Company would come in a liberal manner to the House, they certainly could not fail of putting a speedy end to this disagreeable business, and of opening a way to an advantageous treaty.|$|R
40|$|The {{subject of}} this thesis is "sokeright", that is, {{the meaning of the}} phrase "sake and soke", and the rights and {{obligations}} associated with it. "Sake and soke" is a modernized form of Old English sacu and socn and may be literally defined as a "cause" and a "seeking' These words were used in a variety of contexts in the sources; sacu could be a cause of dispute that involves war or personal animosity, socn could be a seeking of the fyrd, a seeking for information, a seeking of a lord for commendation or protection, a seeking of a church for sanctuary or for ordinary reasons of piety. Both words, however, are especially applicable to legal matters; sacu was the common word for a lawsuit, - a cause of dispute which has been brought before a court, and socn was a seeking, or more grammatically, a "suit of court", either to plead a case as a litigant, or to judge it as a doomsman. The phrase sacu and socn was a mnemonic legal formula, and dates from the oral tradition of the law. Its <b>judicial</b> <b>character</b> led to its inclusion in pre-Conquest writs, which were frequently addressed to courts of law. The phrase is very rarely found in charters however, and it was evidently out of place there, not merely because it'was an English phrase when convention demanded that charters be written in Latin, but also because charters were documents of a more private kind...|$|R

It is expressly said in that body of regulations to which I allude, that the office and situation of a judge of the Dewanny Courts of Adawlut is to be filled by the junior servants of the Company; and as the judicial emolument is not substantially equal to that of other situations, the office of a judge is to be taken, as it were, in transitu, as a passage to other offices not of a judicial nature.

This system of Mr. Hastings's government is such a one, I believe, as the British nation in particular will disown; for I will venture to say, that, if there is any one thing which distinguishes this nation eminently above another, it is, that in its offices at home, both judicial and in the state, there is less suspicion of pecuniary corruption attaching to them than to any similar offices in any part of the globe, or that have existed at any time: so that he who would set up a system of corruption, and attempt to justify it upon the principle of utility, that man is staining not only the nature and character of office, but that which is the peculiar glory of the official and <b>judicial</b> <b>character</b> of this country; and therefore, in this House, which is eminently the guardian of the purity of all the offices of this kingdom, he ought to be called eminently and peculiarly to account.
