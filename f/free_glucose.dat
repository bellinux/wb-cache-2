Muscle cells lack this enzyme, so myofibers use glucose-6-phosphate in their own metabolic pathways such as glycolysis.

25|$|Carbohydrates make {{up about}} 50% of the dry weight of green coffee beans. The {{carbohydrate}} fraction of green coffee is dominated by polysaccharides, such as arabinogalactan, galactomannan, and cellulose, contributing to the tasteless flavor of green coffee. Arabinogalactan makes up to 17% of dry weight of green coffee beans, with a molecular weight of 90 kDa to 200 kDa. It is composed of beta-1-3-linked galactan main chains, with frequent members of arabinose (pentose) and galactose (hexose) residues at the side chains comprising immunomodulating properties by stimulating the cellular defense system (Th-1 response) of the body. Mature brown to yellow coffee beans contain fewer residues of galactose and arabinose at the side chain of the polysaccharides, making the green coffee bean more resistant to physical breakdown and less soluble in water. The molecular weight of the arabinogalactan in coffee is higher than in most other plants, improving the cellular defense system of the digestive tract compared to arabinogalactan with lower molecular weight. Free monosaccharides are present in mature brown to yellow-green coffee beans. The free part of monosaccharides contains sucrose (gluco-fructose) up to 9000mg/100g of arabica green coffee bean, a lower amount in robustas, i.e. 4500mg/100g. In arabica green coffee beans, the content of <b>free</b> <b>glucose</b> was 30 to 38mg/100g, free fructose 23 to 30mg/100g; free galactose 35mg/100g and mannitol 50mg/100g dried coffee beans, respectively. Mannitol is a powerful scavenger for hydroxyl radicals, which are generated during the peroxidation of lipids in biological membranes.|$|E

40|$|Canine vein strips were mounted for {{isometric}} tension recording. Anoxia did {{not affect}} basal tension of saphenous and pulmonary strips mounted in standard Krebs Ringer solution or after 30 min of incubation in <b>glucose</b> <b>free</b> solution. Anoxia depressed the strength of spontaneous contractions of mesenteric veins; in <b>glucose</b> <b>free</b> solution (30 min), anoxia relaxed the strips. Veins placed in <b>glucose</b> <b>free</b> solution for more than 60 min contracted with anoxia; this contraction was not inhibited by iproveratril. When the vein strips were contracted by norepinephrine or KCl, anoxia depressed the contractions, most in mesenteric and least in saphenous preparations; this depression was greater {{in the absence of}} glucose. When oxygen was present, the absence of glucose had little effect on the response to vasoactive agents. Contractions with acetylcholine were depressed by anoxia in mesenteric and pulmonary strips but were augmented in saphenous veins; the latter potentiation was inhibited by iproveratril and by incubation in <b>glucose</b> <b>free</b> solution. Thus, especially in the saphenous vein, anaerobic glycolysis can provide most of the energy requirements, and intracellular substrates are available for oxidative metabolism. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

25|$|Plasma glucose {{is said to}} be {{maintained}} when there is an equal rate of glucose appearance (entry into the blood) and glucose disposal (removal from the blood). In the healthy individual, the rates of appearance and disposal are essentially equal during exercise of moderate intensity and duration; however, prolonged exercise or sufficiently intense exercise can result in an imbalance leaning towards a higher rate of disposal than appearance, at which point glucose levels fall producing the onset of fatigue. Rate of glucose appearance is dictated by the amount of glucose being absorbed at the gut as well as liver (hepatic) glucose output. Although glucose absorption from the gut is not typically a source of glucose appearance during exercise, the liver is capable of catabolizing stored glycogen (glycogenolysis) as well as synthesizing new glucose from specific reduced carbon molecules (glycerol, pyruvate, and lactate) in a process called gluconeogenesis. The ability of the liver to release glucose into the blood from glycogenolysis is unique, since skeletal muscle, the other major glycogen reservoir, is incapable of doing so. Unlike skeletal muscle, liver cells contain the enzyme glycogen phosphatase, which removes a phosphate group from glucose-6-P to release <b>free</b> <b>glucose.</b> In order for glucose to exit a cell membrane, the removal of this phosphate group is essential. Although gluconeogenesis is an important component of hepatic glucose output, it alone can not sustain exercise. For this reason, when glycogen stores are depleted during exercise, glucose levels fall and fatigue sets in. Glucose disposal, {{the other side of the}} equation, is controlled by uptake of glucose at the working skeletal muscles. During exercise, despite decreased insulin concentrations, muscle increases GLUT4 translocation of and glucose uptake. The mechanism for increased GLUT4 translocation is an area of ongoing research.|$|E

5000|$|Flagellates are {{a feature}} of all termite {{families}} except Termitidae, the so-called [...] "higher termites". They are found exclusively in the hindgut, especially the paunch, an enlarged section of the hindgut with an [...] interior {{that serves as a}} fermenter. In R. flavipes, wood eaten by the termite is first broken up with the mandibles, treated with host endoglucanases from the salivary glands, ground up into small particles in the gizzard, and then treated with additional host cellulases in the midgut, <b>freeing</b> <b>glucose</b> for immediate absorption. It then passes into the paunch, where flagellates take up the partly-digested wood particles through endocytosis. The flagellates break lignocellulose (xylan or cellulose) down into simple sugars, which they ferment for their own energy needs, producing CO2, H2, and short-chain fatty acids such as acetate as waste products. The short-chain fatty acids (which are also produced by homoacetogenic gut bacteria from CO2 and H2) can be directly absorbed by the termite host. The vast majority of digestion takes place in the paunch: almost all xylanase activity, just over one quarter of the endoglucanase activity, and almost two thirds of the exoglucanase activity in the R. flavipes digestive system is localised in the hindgut and attributed to gut flagellates.|$|R

40|$|In {{the yeast}} Saccharomyces cerevisiae a novel control exerted by TPS 1 (=GGS 1 =FDP 1 =BYP 1 =CIF 1 = GLC 6 = TSS 1) -encoded trehalose- 6 -phosphate synthase, is {{essential}} for restriction of glucose influx into glycolysis apparently by inhibiting hexokinase activity in vivo. We show that up to 50 -fold overexpression of hexokinase does not noticeably affect growth on glucose or fructose in wild-type cells. However, it causes higher levels of glucose- 6 -phosphate, fructose- 6 -phosphate and also faster accumulation of fructose-l, 6 -bisphosphate during the initiation of fermentation. The levels of ATP and Pi correlated inversely with the higher sugar phosphate levels. In the first minutes after glucose addition, the metabolite pattern observed was intermediate between those of the tps 1 Delta mutant and the wild-type strain. Apparently, during the start-up of fermentation hexokinase is more rate-limiting {{in the first section}} of glycolysis than phosphofructokinase. We have developed a method to measure the <b>free</b> intracellular <b>glucose</b> level which is based on the simultaneous addition of D-glucose and an equal concentration of radiolabelled L-glucose. Since the latter is not transported, the <b>free</b> intracellular <b>glucose</b> level can be calculated as the difference between the total D-glucose measured (intracellular+ periplasmic/extracellular) and the total L-glucose measured (periplasmic/extracellular). The intracellular-glucose level rose in 5 min after addition of 100 mM-glucose to 0. 5 - 2 mM in the wild-type strain, +/- 10 mM in a hxk 1 Delta hxk 2 Delta glk 1 Delta and 2 - 3 mM in a tps 1 Delta strain.

Overexpression of hexokinase PII never produced a strong effect on the rate of ethanol production and glucose consumption.

Afterwards, the Tps 1 -dependent control system is apparently able to restrict properly up to 50 -fold higher hexokinase activity. (C) 1998 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. status: publishe...|$|R
