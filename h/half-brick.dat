25|$|It is {{constructed}} with interior partitions of brick with stone window sills and lintels at the cells. It is built with a standing seam gable roof. There is a wooden platform on brick piers {{at the rear}} door and the metal frame walls are mortared. The gable roof was replaced in 1978. The chimney tops were repaired in 1982. The exterior walls are of local brick with <b>half-brick</b> vent holes into the crawl space below the first floor level. The second and third floor has outer east and west windows. The cell windows have lintels and sills cut from local sandstone. The center hall and first floor windows have wood sills and lintels. The first floor and center windows of {{the second and third}} floor north sides have 6/6 double hanging windows. The center north side entrance is a four-raised panel door surrounded by a four-light transom. The gable ends are void of any window openings as is the south facade.|$|E

50|$|The stupas are {{all made}} of brick, with several {{different}} designs. The bottom row (19 stupas) {{and the large}} stupa at the top have a zigzag ratha-shaped base, whereas the remaining 88 stupas all have an octagonal base. Rows 1 and 12 (20 stupas), rows 2-6 (23 stupas), row 7 (9 stupas), and rows 8-11 (56 stupas) each have slightly different shapes of hemispherical domed stupa body. Whole bricks are used for the stupa base, and <b>half-bricks</b> are used for {{the body of the}} stupa.|$|R
40|$|There is an {{increasing}} demand for earth construction {{in the world today}} but there is no consensus on the procedure to be used to measure the compressive strength of earth bricks. The study presented in this paper aims to propose a test procedure specific to earth bricks that would give the most realistic value of compressive strength while remaining as simple as possible. This study focused on four different bricks and consisted of measuring the compressive strength of these specimens by varying several parameters: specimen size, orientation, use of Teflon capping or not, and tests on dry sawn specimens, on <b>half-bricks</b> or on entire bricks. The results of the study show that the best compromise to achieve a simple and representative compressive strength test for earth bricks is to transform the bricks as little as possible before the test and thus to test entire bricks...|$|R

Stuart Law, the former Australian Test player, called it [...] "a <b>half-brick</b> on a stick". The bat was used by Anuraag in the 2010 version of the IPL.

2500|$|Two pickets, David Jones and Joe Green, {{were killed}} in {{separate}} incidents, and three teenagers (Darren Holmes, aged 15, and Paul Holmes and Paul Womersley, both aged 14) died picking coal from a colliery waste heap in the winter. [...] The NUM names its memorial lectures after the pickets. [...] Jones's death raised tensions between strikers and those who continued to work. [...] On 15 March 1984, he {{was hit in the}} chest by a <b>half-brick</b> thrown by a youth who opposed the strike when he confronted him for vandalising his car, but the post-mortem ruled that this had not caused his death and it was {{more likely to have been}} caused by being pressed against the pit gates earlier in the day. [...] News of his death led to hundreds of pickets staying in Ollerton town centre overnight. [...] At the request of Nottinghamshire Police, Scargill appeared and called for calm in the wake of the tragedy. [...] Several working miners in Ollerton reported that their gardens and cars had been vandalised during the night. [...] Ollerton Colliery closed for a few days as a mark of respect for Jones.|$|E
50|$|The baths contain four {{chambers}} whose structural {{features are}} made up of a number of columns. The main hall, which has a central dome, consists of six arches supported on columns with capitals, which are of different designs; four pillars are small and built with <b>half-bricks,</b> three pillars made of stone are polished, and one pillar is a stand-alone built in bricks. There are four capitals above the pillars, of which three are of Visigothic design, while one is of Roman design. Vestibules are part of the main hall which, when in use, were screened to provide privacy to the bathers. Each of the four chambers has natural lighting provided by star-shaped openings in the roof. The room with the heated water, located at {{the northern part of the}} baths, has a large arched entry. The plunge bath is located at the southern end. Also noted are underground ducts which convey hot air from the boiler chamber.|$|R
50|$|The BUF arrived via {{a convoy}} of coaches during the {{afternoon}} of 10 September 1933, bringing in 200-300 members from Tyneside, Manchester and Lancashire. They parked on the southern side of the River Tees in Thornaby-on-Tees, then part of North Yorkshire. They then went to Stockton High Street, to the Market Cross area and attempted to hold a rally led by Captain Vincent Collier. However, they were attacked by up to 2,000 anti-fascist protesters who had hidden themselves in the side streets around the High Street, who then began heckling and spitting at Collier. Although there was little police presence at the start, the police later ordered the BUF to leave the High Street, so they went to Silver Street to protect themselves, but this ended up trapping them. Both sides then armed themselves with staves, sticks and pickaxe handles. The anti-fascists also used various missiles including stones, <b>half-bricks</b> and potatoes with razor blades inserted into them.|$|R
60|$|I still {{remember}} with infinite gratitude the great-uncle to whom I owe my bricks. He {{must have been}} one of those rare adults who have not forgotten the chagrins and dreams of childhood. He was a prosperous west of England builder; including my father he had three nephews, and for each of them he caused a box of bricks to be made by an out-of-work carpenter, not the insufficient supply of the toyshop, you understand, but a really adequate quantity of bricks made out of oak and shaped and smoothed, bricks about five inches by two and a half by one, and <b>half-bricks</b> and quarter-bricks to correspond. There were hundreds of them, many hundreds. I could build six towers as high as myself with them, and there seemed quite enough for every engineering project I could undertake. I could build whole towns with streets and houses and churches and citadels; I could bridge every gap in the oilcloth and make causeways over crumpled spaces (which I feigned to be morasses), and on a keel of whole bricks it was possible to construct ships to push over the high seas to the remotest port in the room. And a disciplined population, that rose at last by sedulous begging on birthdays and all convenient occasions to well over two hundred, of lead sailors and soldiers, horse, foot and artillery, inhabited this world.|$|R
60|$|One day a smart little groom rode {{into the}} court where Tom lived. Tom was just hiding behind a wall, to heave half a brick at his horse's legs, {{as is the}} custom of that country when they welcome strangers; but the groom saw him, and halloed to him to know where Mr. Grimes, the chimney-sweep, lived. Now, Mr. Grimes was Tom's own master, and Tom {{was a good man}} of business, and always civil to customers, so he put the <b>half-brick</b> down quietly behind the wall, and {{proceeded}} to take orders.|$|E

No more Manchester Department for ten days! Out of Manchester, a Man. The draper Hoopdriver, the Hand, had {{vanished}} from existence. Instead was a gentleman, a man of pleasure, with a five-pound note, two sovereigns, and some silver at various convenient points of his person. At any rate as good as a Dook, if not precisely in the peerage. Involuntarily at the thought of his funds Hoopdriver's right hand left the handle and sought his breast pocket, to be immediately recalled by a violent swoop of the machine towards the cemetery. Whirroo! Just missed that <b>half-brick!</b> Mischievous brutes there were in the world to put such a thing in the road. Some blooming 'Arry or other! Ought to prosecute a few of these roughs, and the rest would know better. That must be the buckle of the wallet was rattling on the mud-guard. How cheerfully the wheels buzzed! ...|$|E
60|$|Amanda had {{revealed}} an unexpected gift for nicknames and pretty fancies. She named herself the Leopard, the spotless Leopard; in some obscure way she intimated that the colour was black, {{but that was}} never to be admitted openly, there {{was supposed to be}} some lurking traces of a rusty brown but the word was spotless and the implication white, a dazzling white, she would play a thousand variations on the theme; in moments of despondency she was only a black cat, a common lean black cat, and sacks and <b>half-bricks</b> almost too good for her. But Benham was always a Cheetah. That had come to her as a revelation from heaven. But so clearly he was a Cheetah. He was a Hunting Leopard; the only beast that has an up-cast face and dreams and looks at you with absent-minded eyes like a man. She laced their journeys with a fantastic monologue telling in the third person what the Leopard and the Cheetah were thinking and seeing and doing. And so they walked up mountains and over passes and swam in the warm clear water of romantic lakes and loved each other mightily always, in chestnut woods and olive orchards and flower-starred alps and pine forests and awning-covered boats, and by sunset and moonlight and starshine; and out of these agreeable solitudes they came brown and dusty, striding side by side into sunlit entertaining fruit-piled market-places and envious hotels. For days and weeks together it did not seem to Benham that there was anything that mattered in life but Amanda and the elemental joys of living. And then the Research Magnificent began to stir in him again. He perceived that Italy was not India, that the clue to the questions he must answer lay in the crowded new towns that they avoided, in the packed bookshops and the talk of men, and not in the picturesque and flowery solitudes to which their lovemaking carried them.|$|R
60|$|The great ball {{in honour of}} Lord Belpher's coming-of-age was at its height. The {{reporter}} of the Belpher Intelligencer and Farmers' Guide, who {{was present}} in his official capacity, and had been allowed by butler Keggs to take a peep at the scene through a side-door, justly observed in {{his account of the}} proceedings next day that the 'tout ensemble was fairylike', and described the company as 'a galaxy of fair women and brave men'. The floor was crowded with all that was best and noblest in the county; so that a <b>half-brick,</b> hurled at any given moment, must infallibly have spilt blue blood. Peers stepped on the toes of knights; honorables bumped into the spines of baronets. Probably the only titled person in the whole of the surrounding country who was not playing his part in the glittering scene was Lord Marshmoreton; who, on discovering that his private study had been converted into a cloakroom, had retired to bed with a pipe and a copy of Roses Red and Roses White, by Emily Ann Mackintosh (Popgood, Crooly & Co.), which he was to discover--after he was between the sheets, and {{it was too late to}} repair the error--was not, as he had supposed, a treatise on his favourite hobby, but a novel of stearine sentimentality dealing with the adventures of a pure young English girl and an artist named Claude.|$|E
6000|$|Royal {{love affairs}} {{in those days}} were {{conducted}} on the correspondence system. A monarch, hearing good reports of a neighbouring princess, would despatch messengers with gifts to her Court, beseeching an interview. The Princess would name a date, and a formal meeting would take place; after which everything usually buzzed along pretty smoothly. But {{in the case of}} King Merolchazzar's courtship of the Princess of the Outer Isles there had been a regrettable hitch. She had acknowledged the gifts, saying that they were just what she had wanted and how had he guessed, and had added that, as regarded a meeting, she would let him know later. Since that day no word had come from her, and a gloomy spirit prevailed in the capital. At the Courtiers' Club, the meeting-place of the aristocracy of Oom, five to one in pazazas was freely offered against Merolchazzar's chances, but found no takers; while in the taverns of the common people, where less conservative odds were always to be had, you could get a snappy hundred to eight. [...] "For in good sooth," [...] writes a chronicler of the time on a <b>half-brick</b> and a couple of paving-stones which have survived to this day, [...] "it did indeed begin to appear as though our beloved monarch, the son of the sun and the nephew of the moon, had been handed the bitter fruit of the citron." ...|$|E
