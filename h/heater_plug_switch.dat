5000|$|Victor {{extended}} their {{range of a}} 25 cwt and a 2-ton vehicle {{by the addition of}} a 12 cwt model in 1936. All of their vehicles were designed to have a top speed of 20 mph. The electric motor was mounted just behind the front wheels, and drove the rear wheels through a propellor shaft and bevel rear axle. The front wheels were fitted with independent suspension, to reduce pitching, and the buyer could specify whether they wanted steering to be by a tiller or a wheel. [...] In 1945 Victor announced that it had developed a battery-electric vehicle which did not need a separate charger, but could be plugged into any standard <b>heater</b> <b>plug.</b> This principle had been tried to good effect in Europe. Other innovations included the concept of a standard battery, which could be fitted to eight different vehicles with payloads ranging from 10 cwt to 80 cwt. A single battery would be fitted to the smallest vehicle, and four to the largest. They also announced a scheme by which batteries could be hired, rather than bought outright.|$|R

25|$|Throughout the 1950s {{there was}} an {{increasing}} demand for a diesel-engined Land Rover. Diesel technology had improved, making small-capacity high-speed engines practical. Diesel power had also become prominent in industrial and agricultural uses throughout the world, and fleet users of Land Rovers were often in the situation where their Land Rovers were the only petrol-engined vehicles in their fleet, making spares, servicing and fuel supply more complex. The Rover Motor Company was in talks with Standard-Triumph in 1954, {{with the possibility of}} a merger. Standard were Britain's pioneers of road-going small diesel engines with the 20C engine fitted to Ferguson tractors and the Standard Vanguard car (Britain's first diesel car). Rover engineers were able to study Standard's diesel designs as part of these. The merger was called off, but Rover had gained vital experience and knowledge in developing small diesel engines. The result was a wet-liner 4-cylinder engine. Fuel injection equipment was from CAV, and the engine used Ricardo's Comet swirl chambers, but with Rover-developed dimples to produce quieter and smoother running. <b>Heater</b> <b>plugs</b> were fitted to each combustion chamber to improve starting. The engine was launched in the Land Rover in 1957. The vehicle had to have an extra 2inches let into the chassis in the engine bay to enable the new engine to fit. The engine's power output and speed range was close enough to the existing petrol engine to allow the same transmission unit to be used on all vehicles.|$|R

40|$|Sulfuric acid {{is present}} in most coal flue gases because a {{percentage}} of the SO 2 produced (typically 0. 5 to 1. 5 %) is further oxidized in the boiler to SO 3, which combines with flue gas moisture to form vapor-phase or condensed sulfuric acid.

50|$|Electronic computers, {{using either}} relays or valves, {{began to appear}} in the early 1940s. The {{electromechanical}} Zuse Z3, completed in 1941, was the world's first programmable computer, and by modern standards one of the first machines that could be considered a complete computing machine. Colossus, developed during the Second World War to decrypt German messages was the first electronic digital computer. Although it was programmable, it was not general-purpose, being designed to perform only a single task. It also lacked the ability to store its program in memory; programming was carried out using <b>plugs</b> and <b>switches</b> to alter the internal wiring. The first recognisably modern electronic digital stored-program computer was the Manchester Small-Scale Experimental Machine (SSEM), which ran its first program on 21 June 1948.|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} of this project has been to demonstrate the use of alkaline reagents injected into the furnace of coal-fired boilers {{as a means of}} controlling sulfuric acid emissions. The project was co-funded by the U. S. DOE National Energy Technology Laboratory under Cooperative Agreement DE-FC 26 - 99 FT 40718, along with EPRI, the American Electric Power Company (AEP), FirstEnergy Corporation, the Tennessee Valley Authority, and Carmeuse North America. Sulfuric acid controls are becoming of increased interest for coal-fired power generating units for a number of reasons. In particular, sulfuric acid can cause plant operation problems such as air <b>heater</b> <b>plugging</b> and fouling, back-end corrosion, and plume opacity. These issues will likely be exacerbated with the retrofit of selective catalytic reduction (SCR) for NOX control, as SCR catalysts are known to further oxidize a portion of the flue gas SO{sub 2 } to SO{sub 3 }. The project tested the effectiveness of furnace injection of four different magnesium-based or dolomitic alkaline sorbents on full-scale utility boilers. These reagents were tested during one- to two-week tests conducted on two FirstEnergy Bruce Mansfield Plant (BMP) units. One of the sorbents tested was a magnesium hydroxide slurry byproduct from a modified Thiosorbic{reg_sign} Lime wet flue gas desulfurization process. The other three sorbents are available commercially and include dolomite, pressure-hydrated dolomitic lime, and commercially available magnesium hydroxide. The dolomite reagent was injected as a dry powder through out-of-service burners. The other three reagents were injected as slurries through air-atomizing nozzles inserted through the front wall of the upper furnace. After completing the four one- to two-week tests, the most promising sorbents were selected for longer-term (approximately 25 -day) full-scale tests on two different units. The longer-term tests were conducted to confirm sorbent effectiveness over extended operation on two different boilers, and to determine balance-of-plant impacts. The first long-term test was conducted on FirstEnergy's BMP Unit 3, and the second was conducted on AEP's Gavin Plant, Unit 1. The Gavin Plant test provided an opportunity to evaluate the effects of sorbent injected into the furnace on SO{sub 3 } formed across an operating SCR reactor. A final task in the project was to compare projected costs for furnace injection of magnesium hydroxide slurries to estimated costs for other potential sulfuric acid control technologies. Estimates were developed for reagent and utility costs, and capital costs, for furnace injection of magnesium hydroxide slurries and seven other sulfuric acid control technologies. The estimates were based on retrofit application to a model coal-fired plant...|$|R
50|$|A switch is {{a device}} in a {{computer}} network that electrically and logically connects together other devices. Multiple data cables are <b>plugged</b> into a <b>switch</b> to enable communication between different networked devices.

40|$|The {{objective}} of this project is to demonstrate the use of alkaline reagents injected into the furnace of coal-fired boilers {{as a means of}} controlling sulfuric acid emissions. Sulfuric acid controls are becoming of increasing interest to utilities with coal-fired units for a number of reasons. Sulfuric acid is a Toxic Release Inventory species, a precursor to acid aerosol/condensable emissions, and can cause a variety of plant operation problems such as air <b>heater</b> <b>plugging</b> and fouling, back-end corrosion, and plume opacity. These issues will likely be exacerbated with the retrofit of SCR for NO{sub x} control on some coal-fired plants, as SCR catalysts are known to further oxidize a portion of the flue gas SO{sub 2 } to SO{sub 3 }. The project is testing the effectiveness of furnace injection of four different calcium- and/or magnesium-based alkaline sorbents on full-scale utility boilers. These reagents have been tested during four one- to two-week tests conducted on two First Energy Bruce Mansfield Plant units. One of the sorbents tested was a magnesium hydroxide slurry produced from a wet flue gas desulfurization system waste stream, from a system that employs a Thiosorbic{reg_sign} Lime scrubbing process. The other three sorbents are available commercially and include dolomite, pressure-hydrated dolomitic lime, and commercial magnesium hydroxide. The dolomite reagent was injected as a dry powder through out-of-service burners, while the other three reagents were injected as slurries through air-atomizing nozzles into the front wall of upper furnace, either across from the nose of the furnace or across from the pendant superheater tubes. After completing the four one- to two-week tests, the most promising sorbents were selected for longer-term (approximately 25 -day) full-scale tests. The longer-term tests are being conducted to confirm the effectiveness of the sorbents tested over extended operation and to determine balance-of-plant impacts. This reports presents the results of the short-term tests; the long-term test results will be reported in a later document. The short-term test results showed that three of the four reagents tested, dolomite powder, commercial magnesium hydroxide slurry, and byproduct magnesium hydroxide slurry, were able to achieve 90 % or greater removal of sulfuric acid compared to baseline levels. The molar ratio of alkali to flue gas sulfuric acid content (under baseline conditions) required to achieve 90 % sulfuric acid removal was lowest for the byproduct magnesium hydroxide slurry. However, this result may be confounded because this {{was the only one of}} the three slurries tested with injection near the top of the furnace across from the pendant superheater platens. Injection at the higher level was demonstrated to be advantageous for this reagent over injection lower in the furnace, where the other slurries were tested...|$|R
