5|$|Fender fielded mainly at slip. He possessed quick {{reactions}} and could {{move quickly to}} catch balls hit some distance from him. His technique was unorthodox; <b>he</b> <b>crouched</b> low when waiting for the ball with one leg stretched behind him, like a sprinter ready to begin a race. Good catching was vital in a Surrey side which possessed weak bowling, making his contributions even more important, and critics regarded {{him as one of}} the best slip fielders in England.|$|E
500|$|Remarkably, Terry Sawchuk played {{goal for}} most of his career not wearing a mask; <b>he</b> <b>crouched</b> very low such that his {{shoulders}} nearly touched his knees. This stance became known as the [...] "gorilla crouch". [...] During his career, Sawchuk relied on his ability to see the puck under the players' bodies, his outstanding mobility, and reflexes, to win four Vezina Trophies. [...] By 1955, he was regarded as the greatest goaltender to ever play the game. [...] Sawchuk's career was cut short when he died in 1970 from injuries suffered in a drunken incident with teammate Ron Stewart. [...] The Hall of Fame waived its waiting period, immediately inducting Sawchuk as the NHL's all-time record holder in wins (447) and shutouts (103). [...] Sawchuk's style of play was a precursor to the modern goaltending butterfly style.|$|E
500|$|Silver's final {{recordings}} {{with the}} Jazz Messengers were in May 1956. Later that year, he left Blakey after {{one and a}} half years, {{in part because of the}} heroin use prevalent in the band, which Silver did not want to be involved in. Soon after leaving, Silver formed his own long-term quintet, after receiving offers of work from club owners who had heard his albums. The first line-up was Mobley (tenor saxophone), Farmer (trumpet), Watkins (bass), and Louis Hayes (drums). The quintet, with various line-ups, continued to record, helping Silver to build his reputation. He wrote almost all of the material they played, and, in concert, he [...] "won over the crowds through his affable personality and all-action approach. <b>He</b> <b>crouched</b> over the piano as the sweat poured out, with his forelock brushing the keys and his feet pounding." ...|$|E
60|$|ANDROCLES. Oh, don't ask me, don't ask me. Something too dreadful. Oh! (<b>He</b> <b>crouches</b> by her {{and hides}} {{his face in}} her robe, sobbing).|$|R
50|$|Tapia {{has been}} noted for {{altering}} his batting stance during at-bats. He generally stands at the plate with an upright stance except when there are two strikes against him, at which point <b>he</b> <b>crouches</b> deeply, dropping his eye level approximately six inches.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{think it}} was the sails that caused it," [...] I argued. [...] "I've noticed that he is very afraid of them. When they flap, <b>he</b> <b>crouches</b> down in terror and starts to run. You noticed how he ran with his head turned back?" ...|$|R
2500|$|The {{next day}} saw sports {{commentators}} and articles who {{reported on the}} [...] "bizarre end" [...] {{of the game in}} Tempe. Some even stated that Stave's knee did not touch the ground or that <b>he</b> <b>crouched.</b> This was later countered by other sports commentators, notably columnist Dennis Dodd of CBS Sports that the NCAA handbook states that one simply has to assimilate a kneeling motion.|$|E
2500|$|Flight {{attendant}} Claude Burgniard {{described the}} firefight as [...] "the apocalypse". Christophe Morin, a flight attendant, recalled that the GIGN ordered {{passengers and crew}} to get down {{as low as possible}} with their hands over their heads, hide, and then to not move. Morin described the situation as [...] "violent". He recalled putting his overcoat over his head so he would not see the tracer bullets and other occurrences during the raid. Morin said that he tried to help a female passenger next to him escape, but she was too large and Morin was unable to move her, so the two held hands. Pilot Bernard Delhemme said that he was in [...] "a rather bad spot", so <b>he</b> <b>crouched</b> and made himself [...] "as small as possible." [...] His mind made him believe that his body could stop bullets.|$|E
2500|$|The first {{concerns}} a raider from Galloway, who {{set out to}} steal a horse. His mother warned him against theft on the land of St Bega, but her son was scornful and moving his hands to the private parts of his buttocks he tauntingly said, [...] "what can that little old woman do to me?" [...] As he escaped on the horse, arrows were fired after him as <b>he</b> <b>crouched</b> low, and the inevitable happened. The third concerns Godard of Millom, whose men would not remove their horses from the monks' pasture to which they had strayed. When the men came to saddle the horses, they found the hooves almost severed, and in penance Godard gave the field to the Monks. The seventh miracle tells of three men of Workington, who were imprisoned in Egremont Castle for killing {{a man in a}} drunken brawl, but having confessed their sins to St Bega, were rescued by her and found sanctuary at St Bees. The ninth miracle tells of two sick brothers who, after seeing a vision at Tynmouth, travelled to St Bees in a cart, and were healed; leaving the cart as thanks.|$|E
6000|$|Be silent, he is but {{a phantom}} now [...] And he can neither touch, nor hear, nor see; [...] The longing and the cries have drawn him hither. [...] He heard no sound, heard no {{articulate}} sound; [...] They could but banish rest, and make him dream, [...] And in that dream, as do all dreaming shades [...] Before they are accustomed to their freedom, [...] He has taken his familiar form, and yet [...] <b>He</b> <b>crouches</b> there not knowing where he is [...] Or at whose side <b>he</b> is <b>crouched.</b>|$|R
50|$|Blanka {{fights in}} a self-taught, animalistic style. In {{several of his}} special moves he rolls into a ball, {{launching}} himself at an opponent. In Blanka's signature attack, <b>he</b> <b>crouches</b> and emits an electric current shocking anything it touches. Although Blanka growls in combat, except for Street Fighter Alpha 3 he uses words in cutscenes.|$|R
50|$|In the Lake District, Clive faces a {{difficult}} moral decision himself. He chooses {{to walk away}} from a potentially dangerous situation he could have helped with, because his elusive melody, the crucial notes, have arisen and he has to get them down. Instead of helping, <b>he</b> <b>crouches</b> unseen besides a rock and writes his music.|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>crouched</b> {{down and}} turned up the bells of the little blue flowers.|$|E
60|$|The two Germans {{regarded}} him as <b>he</b> <b>crouched</b> there. Death {{for a moment}} seemed near.|$|E

60|$|Opening his eyes, <b>he</b> saw <b>crouching</b> by {{his side}} about as villainous a looking tramp as one would care to meet.|$|R
6000|$|... "I--I'm scared, sir--s-s-scared stiff. It's that yellow s-s-s-streak in me; I--I--can't help it, sir." [...] Then <b>he</b> collapsed, <b>crouching</b> lifelessly {{close to}} the sand.|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>crouched</b> {{down before}} the hearth. There was no warmth in that fast-blackening ember, {{but it still}} glowed like a dark-red flower. And while it lived <b>he</b> <b>crouched</b> there, {{as though it were}} that to which he was saying good-bye. And on the door he heard the girl's ghostly knocking. And beside him--a ghost among the ghostly presences--she stood. Slowly the glow blackened, till the last spark had faded out.|$|E
60|$|And {{again she}} looked at him, long and steadily, as <b>he</b> <b>crouched</b> in the chair before her, and then slowly left the room.|$|E

5000|$|The show {{opens with}} Nick Stokes driving down The Strip at night, {{listening}} to Bob Neuwirth's Lucky Too on the radio. He pulls {{over at a}} car park and a uniformed officer leads him to the [...] "body": a set of intestines coiled in an alley. When the officer walks off to be sick, Nick wanders down the alley and spots a styrofoam coffee cup, already in an evidence bag. As <b>he</b> <b>crouches</b> down to photograph it, he is snatched from behind and a cloth is clamped over his face.|$|R
60|$|And {{taking the}} candle {{he began to}} clamber down. When {{he got to the}} bottom <b>he</b> <b>crouched</b> over his leg and felt the bandage.|$|E
60|$|His breath came quicker, {{his voice}} grew hoarser, and <b>he</b> <b>crouched</b> lower. All his body except his rigid arms quivered with a {{wonderful}} muscular convulsion.|$|E

He springs off into vacuum.) ...|$|R
60|$|It was now {{intensely}} {{cold and}} {{the wind was blowing}} almost a gale. He was glad when he reached something of a hollow, where <b>he</b> could <b>crouch</b> down and regain his breath.|$|R
50|$|Riken is a straight-faced and stoic second {{lieutenant}} in the imperial army. He is chosen {{to be a human}} representative in the Ministry of Spirit Affairs and is paired with Susukihotaru. When he overhears that she is afraid of him because of his height, <b>he</b> <b>crouches</b> down and asks her if he is still scary. After this, their relationship greatly improved. He cares for Susukihotaru greatly, and she senses this when she injures his hand while she is possessed by a sword. He describes himself as a man of few words and does not have a problem with Susukihotaru reading his emotions.|$|R
6000|$|... "And now," [...] {{thought the}} crushed man, as <b>he</b> <b>crouched</b> on his {{mattress}} in the hold, [...] "he is gone,--snatched away before my eyes, suddenly and for ever!" ...|$|E

5000|$|Cervantes {{utilizes}} his two swords {{in combat}} {{to execute a}} variety of moves that take advantage of both weapons, many of which involve impaling his enemy or firing the pistol from the short sword for a long-range attack. Perhaps his most recognizable move is the [...] "Flying Dutchman", in which <b>he</b> <b>crouches</b> and delivers multiple stabs to the enemy's midsection with extreme speed. This attack has been featured in several games {{as one of his}} signature techniques. In Soul Calibur II, many of his weapons are named after the rivers of Hades, such as Lethe, Phlegethon and Styx.|$|R
5000|$|This type of {{performance}} still continues at Richmond, Yorkshire, at Christmas. Three men dressed in hunting pink lead a horse [...] "made from the stuffed {{skin of a}} horse's head on a pole" [...] {{and the man who}} plays it hidden under a horse-blanket. The men sing the Poor Old Horse song and the horse snapped its jaws {{at the end of each}} verse. The custom as now performed in Richmond Market Place around midday on Christmas Eve involves the horse's [...] "death and resurrection" [...] (<b>he</b> <b>crouches</b> down and then rises up when a hunting horn is blown).|$|R
