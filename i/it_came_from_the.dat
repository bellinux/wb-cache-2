5|$|Most of the gumfields were in Northland, Coromandel and Auckland, {{the site}} of the {{original}} kauri forests. Initially, the gum was readily accessible, commonly found lying on the ground. Captain Cook reported the presence of resinous lumps on the beach at Mercury Bay, Coromandel, in 1769, although he suspected <b>it</b> <b>came</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> mangroves, and missionary Samuel Marsden spoke of their presence in Northland in 1819.|$|E
5000|$|There {{are several}} etymologies {{suggested}} {{for the name}} [...] "Odra". One is that <b>it</b> <b>comes</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Croatian word [...] "oderati" [...] (to cut through). The other is that <b>it</b> <b>comes</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Indo-European root *wodr (water).|$|R
5000|$|There {{are several}} {{suggested}} etymologies {{for the name}} [...] "Karašica". It's not explainable in Croatian. One is that <b>it</b> <b>comes</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Turkish words [...] "kara su" [...] (black stream). Second is that <b>it</b> <b>comes</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Latin word [...] "Carassius", denoting several species of freshwater fish. Perhaps the most likely one is that <b>it</b> <b>comes</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Indo-European root *(s)ker, meaning [...] "to cut", in the sense [...] "the river that cuts through the valley".|$|R
5000|$|In Hungarian {{the town}} is known as Valpó and in German as Walpach. In antiquity, it was called Iovalum. [...] There are several {{suggested}} etymologies. One is that <b>it</b> <b>comes</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Latin root *Iov-, meaning [...] "divine". However, the ending can't be explained by Latin. One explanation is that <b>it</b> <b>comes</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Indo-European words *yow and *h2elut, so that it means [...] "magical beer." [...] The other, more likely, is that <b>it</b> <b>comes</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Indo-European roots *yow and *h2elom, so that it means [...] "magical herb", whatever plant that signified. Perhaps the simplest explanation is that <b>it</b> <b>comes</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Indo-European word *wel, meaning [...] "valley", whatever [...] "Io-" [...] meant.|$|R

25|$|The {{earliest}} {{theory of}} Linear Pottery culture origin is that <b>it</b> <b>came</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Starčevo-Körös culture of Serbia and Hungary. Supporting {{this view is}} the fact that the LBK appeared earliest about 5600–5400 BC on the middle Danube in the Starčevo range. Presumably, the expansion northwards of early Starčevo-Körös produced a local variant reaching the upper Tisza that may have well been created by contact with native epi-Paleolithic people. This small group began a new tradition of pottery, substituting engravings for the paintings of the Balkanic cultures.|$|E

A recovery team retrieved the mostly intact ejection seat. Researchers claim that it is most likely the pilot's seat and remarkably similar to the seat at the snowmobile clubhouse in Greenville. It is the third seat recovered from the crash and preserved for public viewing. The other is in a Bangor museum.|$|E
25|$|There {{are several}} myths {{on the origin}} of the name Dhaka. One is that the name came {{following}} the establishment of Dhakeshwari temple by Raja Ballal Sena in the 12th century and Dhakeswari is the name of a Goddess. While others say that Dhakeshwari stands the meaning of Goddess of Dhaka; so the temple must have been named after the region. Another myths says that the Dhak (a membranophone instrument) is used as part of the Durga Puja festival in this temple and hence the name Dhaka. Yet another one says <b>it</b> <b>came</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> plant named Dhak (Butea monosperma) which was widely found in that area.|$|E
25|$|Hecatæus {{depicted}} {{the origin of}} the Nile River at the southern circumference ocean. His view of the Nile seems to have been that <b>it</b> <b>came</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> southern circumference ocean. This assumption helped Hecatæus solve the mystery of the annual flooding of the Nile. He believed that the waves of the ocean were a primary cause of this occurrence. It is worth mentioning that a similar map based upon one designed by Hecataeus was intended to aid political decision-making. According to Herodotus, it was engraved upon a bronze tablet and was carried to Sparta by Aristagoras during the revolt of the Ionian cities against Persian rule from 499 to 494 BC.|$|E

25|$|The attack {{began on}} the morning of 8 April, with mortar fire on the Bukovik and Meterize city districts, {{as well as on the}} Bosniak-held defence {{positions}} on the Debelo Brdo hill. <b>It</b> <b>came</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> artillery positions in Karakaj, from the Bosnian side before Meterize, and from the Serbian side of the River Drina (Mali Zvornik). First shots were fired in the Meterize suburb. This attack was mainly carried out by the heavy equipment of the JNA (artillery and tanks). There are also reports of Arkanovci snipers firing from Mali Zvornik on the opposite river bank, and of snipers aiming at residents from positions on highrise buildings in Zvornik itself. The Bosniak position on Debelo Brdo, however, fell on that same day and was occupied.|$|E
25|$|Inspector Davies and Poirot meet back at Fernley. The call to Dr. Sheppard {{has been}} traced. It {{was made from}} the local railway station, {{a few minutes before}} the late-night express train for Liverpool left. He has also found out that the woman in the lodge house saw Ralph Paton enter the grounds at 9.25pm. The {{fingerprints}} on the dagger are yet to be tested but Poirot has a theory that they will find only the dead man's prints on the handle. The missing letter from Mrs Ferrars is also a puzzle and Poirot summons Parker and asks him to state what is different about the study compared to when he helped break in the previous evening. Parker tells him of the differences – including the fact that the armchair was pulled out from its normal position and turned at a strange angle, something that catches Poirot's attention. Raymond is questioned about any strangers seen in the past week – the only one he can recall was a young representative from a firm of Dictaphone manufacturers called Curtis and Trout – Sir Roger was considering buying one of their machines. Poirot reveals that he found a scrap of starched material in the summerhouse and theorises that <b>it</b> <b>came</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> dress of Bourne who is {{the only person in the}} house who has no alibi. Mr Hammond, the family solicitor, arrives and reveals that the dead man's will leaves the majority of Sir Roger's estate to Ralph – another motive for the murder. It is also revealed that cash to the sum of one hundred pounds is missing from Sir Roger's room. Ralph though remains the principle suspect and Poirot tells the assembled group that he knows they are all individually hiding something from him and that he means to find the truth.|$|E

She was thus a self-publisher.|$|E
