25|$|The fight {{took place}} at MGM Grand Garden Arena. From round one, Mayweather tagged Ortiz repeatedly. Mayweather seemed in control through the first three rounds (judges scores: 30–27, 30–27, 29–28 for Mayweather), but in the fourth round, Ortiz found success, landing a few shots and {{stinging}} Mayweather before bulling him into the corner. Out of frustration, Ortiz rammed Mayweather {{in the face with}} an intentional headbutt. Referee, Joe Cortez, called timeout and docked Ortiz a point for the foul. As the fight resumed, Ortiz approached Mayweather {{in the center of the}} ring and tried to apologize and even hugged Mayweather. After apologizing, Ortiz had his hands down, and Mayweather unloaded a left hook and a <b>flush</b> <b>right</b> hand to Ortiz's chin. Ortiz dropped and was unable to beat Cortez's count as the crowd of 14,687 were furious at the ruined fight.|$|E

2500|$|Cortez motioned {{the fighters}} back {{together}} {{to resume the}} fight, without putting them in a neutral corner. Both fighters touched gloves, and Ortiz gave Mayweather another hug. At that moment, Cortez was {{not looking at the}} fighters. As Ortiz let go, Mayweather took advantage of Ortiz not having his hands up and unloaded a left hook which wobbled Ortiz. Ortiz then looked at the referee, and Mayweather connected with a <b>flush</b> <b>right</b> hand to Ortiz's face. Ortiz fell to the canvas, and was unable to beat Cortez's count as the crowd of 14,687 jeered Mayweather. After the fight Ortiz claimed that he was merely obeying the referee's instructions when he was [...] "blindsided" [...] by Mayweather, who defended his actions by saying that [...] "In the ring, you have to protect yourself at all times".|$|E

50|$|Charlo {{scored a}} sensational one-punch {{knockout}} of Chicago's Chris Chatman {{in the third}} round. Chatman's only previous loss was a six-round decision to 2008 U.S. Olympian Demetrius Andrade in 2009, but he {{was no match for}} Charlo, who controlled his awkward opponent for most of the fight.

50|$|Amonsot, to {{the dismay}} of the crowd, was embarrassed in front of his {{hometown}} fans, losing in just 47-seconds into {{the first round of the}} bout. Amonsot was caught <b>flush</b> by a <b>right</b> hook from Butar-Butar, sending him down. He tried to get up, but was counted out after he went down again, obviously disorientated from the punch that caught him right on the chin.|$|R
30|$|Permeability {{changes were}} {{measured}} by Evan's blue dye (EBD) leakage {{from the blood}} into the airways. EBD (20  mg/kg) was administered by femoral vein injection 1  h {{before the end of}} the experiments. One hour later, the mice were bled by cardiac puncture, and the pulmonary vasculature was <b>flushed</b> by <b>right</b> ventricle puncture. The pulmonary vessels were perfused with normal saline to remove EBD from the vascular spaces. The lungs were removed en bloc and dried at 60 °C for 24  h. EBD was extracted in formamide at 37 °C for 24  h and quantitated by its fluorescence intensity. The extravasated EBD concentration in lung homogenate was calculated against a standard curve.|$|R
50|$|Pickett then faced Ivan Menjivar on 16 December 2010 at WEC 53. Both fighters {{proved to}} be very evenly matched; Pickett edging the first stanza with {{slightly}} crisper striking & well timed counter takedowns (during Menjivar's spinning backfist attempts), but in the second he was visibly staggered by a stream of strikes from his opponent which he battled through by securing a takedown. In the third, the two continued the fashion of tenaciously exchanging strikes throughout the fight, with Pickett scoring a flash knockdown with a <b>flush</b> overhand <b>right.</b> Menjivar showed great heart in recovering though, and continued to exchange until the final bell. In the end Pickett edged a unanimous decision 29-28.|$|R

5000|$|The overall {{revenues}} {{of the game}} {{have more than doubled}} since the early 1990s. The problem isn't that the game has insufficient popularity or revenues, {{the problem is that the}} game has an imperfect economic system, which often renders any amount of revenue, in the long run, inadequate. You know, they get another source of revenue and they <b>flush</b> it <b>right</b> down the drain. Look what happened when NBC lost baseballin the late 1980s. CBS comes in with this enormous deal for baseball, so the revenues are exponentially increased, but they frittered it all away immediately when the salary structure just immediately exploded right after that. At that time the top paid player made about $2 million a year. Within a couple of years you had dozens and dozens of players making $5 million a year. Bob Costas ...|$|R
50|$|The Flushing River, more {{properly}} and historically known as Flushing Creek, is a waterway that {{flows through the}} northern part of central Queens in New York City (mostly through Flushing Meadows-Corona Park) and empties into the East River. The river runs through a valley that may have been a larger riverbed before the last Ice Age. In the 18th and 19th centuries, it divided the towns of <b>Flushing</b> on its <b>right</b> bank and Newtown on its left; today, it divides Queens into western and eastern halves.|$|R
50|$|Wagnney Fabiano's next bout, {{and first}} IFL Featherwight title defense, came against Shad Lierley on April 4, 2008 at; IFL - New Blood, New Battles 2. In what was dubbed as an archetypal fight between wrestler and Brazilian jiu-jitsu expert, Fabiano won by {{knocking}} out Lierly at 0:37 {{of the first}} round. Fabiano displayed impressive standup skills, utilizing good leg kicks and bodyshots. Near {{the end of the}} round he threw a left jab which Lierly parried partially, but connected a <b>flush</b> <b>right</b> hook to knock out the challenger convincingly and conclude his first title defence. It also become his last and only defence of the IFL Featherwight championship as the company ceased operations on July 31, 2008.|$|E
5000|$|Line {{length is}} {{determined}} by typographic parameters based on a formal grid and template with several goals in mind; balance and function for fit and readability with a sensitivity to aesthetic style in typography. Typographers adjust line length to aid legibility or copy fit. Text can be flush left and ragged right, <b>flush</b> <b>right</b> and ragged left, or justified where all lines are of equal length. In a ragged right setting line lengths vary to create a ragged right edge of lines varying in length. Sometimes this can be visually satisfying. For justified and ragged right settings typographers can adjust line length to avoid unwanted hyphens, rivers of white space, and orphaned words/characters {{at the end of}} lines (e.g.: [...] "The", [...] "I", [...] "He", [...] "We").|$|E
50|$|Thiago never {{signed a}} {{contract}} before his fight against Koscheck, he was only able to acquire a tryout. Thiago made his UFC debut on February 21, 2009, scoring an upset victory over top contender Josh Koscheck at UFC 95. During the fight, commentator Joe Rogan commented that Thiago's striking looked inferior to Koscheck's. However, Thiago won the fight by KO, with a <b>flush</b> <b>right</b> uppercut and a left hook. The referee stopped the fight before Thiago could pounce on him. Koscheck immediately rose and argued {{that he was still}} alert and able to defend himself. Further review of the replay shows Koscheck's eyes roll back as he falls down, giving merit to the stoppage. At the post-fight conference, Dana White confirmed that Thiago had earned Knockout of the Night honors.|$|E

50|$|In {{the third}} round, Corley hit Cotto <b>flush</b> with a <b>right</b> {{hand to the}} chin, and Cotto, who was arguably having the worst round of his career, almost fell. Corley mounted an attack, pinning Cotto against the ropes {{for most of the}} round. Cotto was then {{suddenly}} struck by a low blow himself, and he went to the floor. The referee gave him time to recover, but did not take any points away from Corley. Towards the end of the round, both fighters engaged in an exchange of powerful lefts, with Cotto's barely missing Corley's body, but Corley's getting Cotto on the head and sending him to the ropes again.|$|R

Douglas required assistance to rise to his feet, and since the punch came after the bell it was considered a foul and Douglas was given five minutes to recover. He was not able to continue and Monaco was disqualified as a result.|$|R
