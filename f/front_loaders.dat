50|$|Unlike in a {{conventional}} front loader, the lift arms in these machines are alongside the driver with the pivot points behind the driver's shoulders. Because of the operator's proximity to moving booms, early skid loaders were not as safe as conventional <b>front</b> <b>loaders,</b> particularly during entry and exit of the operator. Modern skid loaders have fully enclosed cabs and other features to protect the operator. Like other <b>front</b> <b>loaders,</b> it can push material from one location to another, carry material in its bucket or load material into a truck or trailer.|$|E
50|$|<b>Front</b> <b>loaders</b> gained {{popularity}} {{during the}} last two decades, especially in urban engineering projects and small earthmoving works. Heavy equipment manufacturers offer a wide range of loader sizes and duties.|$|E
50|$|These {{personnel}} carriers utilize a <b>front</b> <b>loader</b> to perform various loader applications. Also a front basket is typically {{attached to the}} <b>front</b> <b>loader</b> arms {{so that they may}} be lifted. These carriers are typically built to carry 5 or 7 men.|$|R

50|$|A unique rear-loading system {{involves}} a rear loader and a front-loading tractor (usually a Caterpillar <b>front</b> <b>loader</b> with a Tink Claw) for yard waste collection (and in some cities, garbage and recycling). The <b>front</b> <b>loader</b> picks up yard waste {{set in the}} street, and then loaded {{into the back of}} a rear loader. This system is used in several cities, including San Jose.|$|R

5000|$|Noise: Front-loaders tend {{to operate}} more quietly than top-loaders because the door seal helps contain noise, {{and because there}} {{is less of a}} {{tendency}} to imbalance. Top-loaders usually need a mechanical transmission, which can generate more noise than the rubber belt or direct drive found in most <b>front</b> <b>loaders.</b>|$|E
50|$|<b>Front</b> <b>loaders</b> {{need to use}} low-sudsing {{detergents}} {{because the}} tumbling action of the drum folds air into the clothes load that can cause over-sudsing and overflows. However, due to efficient use of water and detergent, the sudsing issue with front-loaders can be controlled by simply using less detergent, without lessening cleaning action.|$|E
50|$|Expanding its {{agricultural}} products, in 2003 {{the company}} began production of agricultural trailers and specialist trailers (including the transport of animals, transport of timber) with a capacity from 2 to 23 ton, and manure spreaders. Pronar also specializes {{in the production of}} municipal products (communal tractors, utility trailers, sweepers, snow plows, <b>front</b> <b>loaders</b> complete with alternative facilities).|$|E

50|$|<b>Front</b> <b>loaders</b> are {{commonly}} used to remove snow especially from sidewalks, parking lots, and other areas too small for using snowplows and other heavy equipment. They are sometimes used as snowplows with a snowplow attachment but commonly have a bucket or snowbasket, which {{can also be used}} to load snow into the rear compartment of a snowplow or dump truck.|$|E
5000|$|Due to {{extremely}} heavy call volume, {{the city}} of Hoboken was supported by its neighboring communities, by an ALS [...] "strike team" [...] consisting of five ambulances deployed from Pennsylvania, and by elements of the 2nd Battalion 113th Infantry New Jersey Army National Guard. The Corps was initially forced to use <b>front</b> <b>loaders</b> to evacuate patients from flooded areas, and later used Army National Guard cargo trucks to transport patients to waiting ambulances.|$|E
50|$|Gescha {{entered the}} realm of {{diecasting}} zamac around this time. The company began to specialize {{in a variety of}} cast metal heavy equipment vehicles like road graders, <b>front</b> <b>loaders,</b> bulldozers, etc. This began a new trend that exploded during the 1980s and 1990s, the making of sophisticated diecast vehicles as promotional items for heavy equipment manufacturers. Gescha appears to have blazed this trail as a new model toy specialty niche, with the newly established NZG Models close at its heels.|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} the {{development}} of a tractor <b>front</b> <b>loader</b> scale which measures payload continuously, independent of the center of gravity of the payload, and unaffected of the position and movements of the loader. To achieve this, a mathematic model of a common <b>front</b> <b>loader</b> is simplified which makes it possible to identify its parameters by a repeatable and automatic procedure. By measuring accelerations as well as cylinder forces, the payload is determined continuously during the working process. Finally, a prototype was build and the scale was tested on a tractor...|$|R
50|$|Recently, Bobcat's {{patent on}} its <b>front</b> <b>loader</b> {{connection}} (inspired by these earlier systems) has expired, and compact tractors {{are now being}} outfitted with quick-connect attachments for their front-end loaders.|$|R
50|$|The {{match that}} {{followed}} was the Buried Alive match between The Undertaker and Mr. McMahon. Undertaker punched McMahon, resulting in McMahon bleeding. Undertaker hit McMahon {{in the head}} with one of the shovels. After Undertaker assaulted McMahon, he carried him to the grave site. McMahon hit the Undertaker with a shovel, which resulted in Undertaker falling to the grave site, but he pulled McMahon into it. Undertaker climbed to a <b>front</b> <b>loader</b> but an explosion knocked him out. Kane interfered, attacked Undertaker and threw him into the grave. McMahon operated the <b>front</b> <b>loader</b> and dumped all the dirt from it to win the match.|$|R
50|$|Large loaders, {{such as the}} Kawasaki 95ZV-2, John Deere 844K, Caterpillar 950H, Volvo L120E, Case 921E, or Hitachi ZW310 {{usually have}} only a front bucket and are called <b>Front</b> <b>Loaders,</b> whereas small loader {{tractors}} are often also equipped with a small backhoe and are called backhoe loaders or loader backhoes or JCBs, after the company that first claimed to have invented them. Other companies like CASE in America and Whitlock in the UK had been manufacturing Excavator Loaders well before JCB.|$|E
50|$|In road transport, an {{oversize}} load (or overweight load) is a load that exceeds the standard or ordinary legal size and/or weight limits for a specified portion of road, highway or other transport infrastructure, such as air freight or water freight. There are also {{load per axle}} limits. However, a load that exceeds the per-axle limits, but not the overall weight limits, is considered overweight. Examples of oversize/overweight loads include construction machines (cranes, <b>front</b> <b>loaders,</b> backhoes, etc.), pre-built homes, containers, construction elements (bridge beams, generators, windmill propellers, rocket stages, industrial equipment).|$|E
50|$|Compared to top-loading washers, {{clothing}} can {{be packed}} more tightly in a front loader, {{up to the}} full drum volume if using a cottons wash cycle. This is because wet cloth usually fits into a smaller space than dry cloth, and <b>front</b> <b>loaders</b> are able to self-regulate the water needed to achieve correct washing and rinsing. Extreme overloading of front-loading washers pushes fabrics towards the small gap between the loading door and {{the front of the}} wash basket, potentially resulting in fabrics lost between the basket and outer tub, and in severe cases, tearing of clothing and jamming the motion of the basket.|$|E
50|$|<b>Front</b> End <b>Loader</b> are an Australian {{rock band}} which formed in December 1991 with {{founding}} mainstays, Bowden Campbell on guitar and vocals; Davis Claymore on lead vocals and guitar; Richard Corey on bass guitar; and Peter Kostic on drums. <b>Front</b> End <b>Loader</b> have issued five studio albums, <b>Front</b> End <b>Loader</b> (June 1993), Let's Ride!
