40|$|In {{the present}} study we address the {{interactions}} of carboxyl-CdSe/ZnS core/shell quantum dots (QDs), {{as a model of}} water dispersible engineered nanoparticles, and metal resistant bacteria Cupriavidus metallidurans, largely used in metal decontamination. The results demonstrate that QDs with average hydrodynamic size of 12. 9 nm adhere to C. metallidurans. The percentage of bacterial cells displaying QD-fluorescence increased proportionally with contact time and QD concentration in bacterial medium demonstrating the association of QDs with the metal resistant bacteria. No evidence of QD internalization into bacterial cytoplasm was found by transmission electron microscopy with energy dispersive X-ray spectrometry, however QD clusters of sizes between 20 and 50 nm were observed on the bacterial surface and in the bacterial periplasmic compartment; observations consistent with the losses of membrane integrity induced by QDs. The presence of 20 nM QDs induced about 2 -fold increase in Cu and Pb uptake fluxes by C. metallidurans exposed to 500 nM Pb or Cu, respectively. Overall, the results of this work suggest that when present in mixture with Cu and Pb, low levels of QDs originating from possible <b>incidental</b> <b>release</b> or QD disposal could increase metal accumulation in metal resistant bacteriu...|$|E
40|$|With rapid {{advances}} in nanotechnology and nanomaterials, metallic nanoparticles (MNPs) have become {{widely used in}} many different products and industrial processes. Water is an important medium in the transfer and fate of MNPs. Accordingly, {{the potential for the}} inadvertent and <b>incidental</b> <b>release</b> of MNPs into aquatic environments through direct release and waste disposal has increased considerably in China in recent years. Environmental health and human safety are two of the greatest challenges facing the expanding nanomaterial field. However, existing knowledge on MNP toxicity is currently insufficient to carry out a comprehensive risk assessment due to a general lack of data related to the environmental distribution of MNPs within aquatic environments. This study provides a summary of MNP production and consumption trends in China by means of statistical changes in MNP discharge and deposition between 2000 and 2010. China was used as a model for aquatic environmental risks associated with MNP consumption and production. MNP pollution of aquatic environments is discussed as well as the challenges that China will face in the future with increasing nanomaterial consumption and pollution. The study concludes with a discussion on managing MNP exposure of aquatic environments in China and its subsequent risks, if any, which may require greater attention. 2013 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht...|$|E
40|$|To achieve {{sustainable}} water resources, {{new treatment}} technologies are needed {{that can be}} applied to a broad range of undesirable constituents in water over a broad range of water chemistries. In this project, nanomaterials were developed as building blocks for advanced treatment technologies through the controlled material synthesis technique of electrospinning. Electrospun nanofibers are promising materials for nano-integrated systems due to their simple tuning and production, large surface-area-to-volume ratio, and potential substrate integration to prevent <b>incidental</b> <b>release</b> into the environment. In this work, electrospun metal oxide nanofibers were synthesized and optimized for their application in various aspects of water treatment, which include Ag-enriched TiO 2 nanofibers for UV-driven photocatalytic oxidation of organic microcontaminants, Al 2 O 3 -Fe 2 O 3 composite nanofibers for adsorption of heavy metals, and BiVO 4 nanofibers for visible light-activated photocatalytic oxidation. TiO 2 nanofibers were developed and tuned to alter morphological, dimensional and optical properties towards optimal photocatalytic performance of contaminant degradation. Electrospinning synthesis yielded nanofibers with controlled diameter, crystal phase, grain size, and band gap. Photoreactivity studies towards the model pollutant phenol showed that diameter and crystal phase composition were the two major factors in optimizing TiO 2 nanofibers performance. Additionally, the introduction of Ag led to further enhancement of photoreactivity, where optimization of the composite nanofibers was tied predominantly to Ag content. Fe 2 O 3 nanofibers were developed and tuned to alter morphological and dimensional properties towards optimal adsorption of heavy metals. Electrospinning synthesis yielded nanofibers with controlled diameter, crystal phase, grain size, and specific surface area. Chromate adsorption isotherm studies reveal increased sorption capacity with decreased diameter of the Fe 2 O 3 nanofibers, attributed with the increased surface area. With the addition of Al, Al 2 O 3 -Fe 2 O 3 composite nanofibers were produced with even greater sorption capacity due to further enhanced surface area. BiVO 4 nanofibers were developed and tuned to control morphological, dimensional and optical properties towards optimal visible-light activated photocatalytic performance. Electrospinning synthesis yielded nanofibers with controlled diameter, crystal phase, grain size, and band gap. Photoreactivity studies towards phenol showed that reactivity increased with decreased nanofiber diameter. The addition of Ag and Au co-catalysts enhanced photoreactivity of the BiVO 4 nanofibers, outperforming TiO 2 nanomaterials under visible light irradiation...|$|E
500|$|There {{have been}} anecdotal reports of {{alligator}} gar captured {{in various parts}} of India but are believed {{to be the result of}} <b>incidental</b> <b>releases</b> by aquarium hobbyists and the like. [...] In August 2015, an alligator gar was found entangled in cloth inside a well in Dadar where it had been living for quite some time. It was rescued by animal activists and returned to the well unharmed. [...] In June 2016, a 3.5ft Alligator Gar was [...] caught from Subhash Sarovar Lake in Kolkata. Other incidents over the years have been random, ranging anywhere from captures in coastal waters during environmental assessments to captures in private ponds.|$|R
40|$|Cadmium sulfide (CdS) {{nanomaterials}} (such as CdS nanodots or nanorods) {{are widely}} used in optical, electronic, and biological applications. Large-scale production and use of these materials will likely result in accidental and <b>incidental</b> <b>releases,</b> which raise concerns about their potential environmental and human-health impacts. Most studies on toxicity of Cd-containing nanomaterials have focused on nanodots, and the relative toxicity of Cd containing nanorods is not well understood. Here, we compared genotoxicity and cytotoxicity of CdS nanorods (30 - 50 nm diameter, 500 - 1100 nm length) and cubic CdS nanodots (3 - 5 nm) in mice by examining total cadmium accumulation in organs, acute toxicity, DNA damage, spermatozoon viability and abnormality, kidney and liver damage, and oxidative stress. Compared with (smaller) nanodots, nanorods resulted in relatively low bioaccumulation, acute toxicity, and damage to spermatozoa and the tested organs. Differences in toxicity between CdS nanodots and nanorods could not be fully explained by differences in their metal ion (Cd 2 +) release patterns, based on control tests with mice gavaged with dissolved CdCl 2 at equivalent concentrations. This underscores that toxicity of metallic nanomaterials could not be solely predicted based either on their elemental composition or {{on the amount of}} ions released before receptor intake. Particle morphology (including size) may also need to be considered...|$|R
40|$|There are {{approximately}} 3, 000 metal-containing substances on Canada’s Domestic Substances List (DSL). Approximately {{one third of}} these substances were identified for further action by the categorization of the DSL, a priority setting exercise completed in 2006 {{which was based on}} ecological and human health considerations. Subsequently, {{the first phase of the}} Chemicals Management Plan (CMP) was initiated and included activities such as the Challenge initiative to conduct screening assessments on the highest priority chemicals, including a few metal-containing substances. However, to assess the remaining elevated number of metal-containing substances identified as priorities (∼ 1000) in the next phases of the CMP and that by 2020, a process for finding efficiencies was established. For the risk assessment and risk management of metal-containing substances, efficiencies can be achieved by using a moiety-based approach in which all substances that contain a common metal moiety are assessed simultaneously as a group. This approach also allows for consideration of <b>incidental</b> <b>releases</b> of a given metal. Because ecological concerns were identified during the Challenge for cobalt, an early metal-moiety assessment is being undertaken in the second phase of the CMP for this metal. This work has been initiated and the draft screening assessment is expected to be published in November 2013...|$|R

40|$|Mortality {{associated}} with the <b>incidental</b> catch and <b>release</b> by commercial trollers of two size classes of chinook salmon, Oncorhynchus tshawytscha, was assessed. Observed cumulative mortality 4 - 6 days after hooking was 18. 3 percent for sublegal-sizefish « 66 cm FL) and 19. 0 percent for legal-sizefish. Size of fish was not significantly related to mortality; however, when the results were combined with data from a previous experiment, {{there was a significant}} inverse relationship between fish length and mortality. Hooking mortality estimates calculated from tagging experiments and observed relative mortality of legal-and sublegal-size fish held in net pens, were used to derive a range for total hooking mortality of 22. 0 - 26. 4 percent for sublegal-size chinook salmon and 18. 5 - 26. 4 percent for legal-size chinook salmon...|$|R

In 1968 he was winner of the Musical Contest - [...] "CERBUL de AUR" [...] ( [...] "Golden Dear") first edition, {{in the city of}} Brasov, Romania. His song was [...] "Camelias". He imposed himself on the scene where well-known singers were also performing during the festival: Los Machucambos, Hugues Aufray, Caterina Casseli, Edith Pieha, Amália Rodrigues, Rika Zarai, Rita Pavone, Maria Mitiieva, Bobby Solo, Jean Claude Pascal. Second place was Josef Laufer, Czech singer. Third place was another Belgian singer, Kalinka.|$|R
40|$|Recently, an {{oxygenator}} with {{an integrated}} centrifugal blood pump (IP) {{was designed to}} minimize priming volume and to reduce blood foreign surface contact even further. The use of this oxygenator with or without integrated arterial filter was compared with a conventional oxygenator and nonintegrated centrifugal pump. To compare the air removal characteristics 60 patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting were alternately assigned into one of three groups to be perfused with a minimized extracorporeal circuit either with the conventional oxygenator, the oxygenator with IP, or the oxygenator with IP plus integrated arterial filter (IAF). Air entering and leaving the three devices was measured accurately with a bubble counter during cardiopulmonary bypass. No significant differences between all groups were detected, considering air entering the devices. Our major finding was that in both integrated devices groups <b>incidental</b> spontaneous <b>release</b> of air into the arterial line in approximately 40 % of the patients was observed. Here, detectable bolus air (> 500 µm) was shown in the arterial line, whereas in the minimal extracorporeal circulation circuit (MECC) group this phenomenon was not present. We decided to conduct an amendment of the initial design with METC-approval. Ten patients were assigned to be perfused with an oxygenator with IP and IAF. Importantly, the integrated perfusion systems used in these patients were flushed with carbon dioxide (CO 2) prior to priming of the systems. In the group with CO 2 flush no spontaneous air release was observed in all cases and this was {{significantly different from the}} initial study with the group with the integrated device and IAF. This suggests that air spilling may be caused by residual air in the integrated device. In conclusion, integration of a blood pump may cause spontaneous release of large air bubbles (> 500 µm) into the arterial line, despite the presence of an integrated arterial filter. CO 2 flushing of an integrated cardiopulmonary bypass system prior to priming may prevent spontaneous air release and is strongly recommended to secure patient safet...|$|R

40|$|This {{research}} {{addresses the}} potential ecotoxicity of two emerging carbonaceous materials: C 60 and biochar. The {{use of these}} materials is rapidly increasing, {{as well as their}} potential for widespread applications. Thus, information about unintended consequences associated the widespread use, <b>incidental</b> or accidental <b>release,</b> and disposal of these emerging materials is needed. The environmental impacts of C 60, its stable water suspension (nC 60), and biochar are assessed here using bacteria and earthworms as model receptors. The antibacterial activity of nC 60 can be mitigated by the presence of natural organic matter as a soil constituent or dissolved in the water column. Sorption to soil might decrease the bioavailability of nC 60 and thus its toxicity to bacteria. Aqueous organic matter also may mitigate nC 60 toxicity. Pristine C 60 showed toxicity to the earthworm's reproduction and was rapidly bioaccumulated by earthworms, although to a lower extent than smaller phenanthrene molecules that are more hydrophobic; thus, the large molecular size of C 60 hinders its bioaccumulation. Less bioaccumulation occurred at higher C 60 concentration in soil, which is counterintuitive and reflects that higher C 60 concentrations that exceed the soil sorption capacity exist as larger precipitates that are less bioavailable. Earthworms avoided soils amended with high concentrations of dry biochar, and experienced significant weight loss after 28 -day exposure. The avoidance response was likely to avert desiccation rather than to avoid potential toxicants (i. e., PAHs formed during biochar production by pyrolysis) or nutrient scarcity. By wetting the biochar to field capacity before exposing the worms, this adverse effect can be completely mitigated. Overall, this research provides a foundation for ecotoxicity assessment associated with exposure to C 60 or biochar, and establishes a method by which other emerging materials can be evaluated for their potential environmental impacts...|$|R
