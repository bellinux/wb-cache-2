Consequently, details of this story, which emanates almost entirely from European sources, will not be reviewed here except as they concern one scanty observation on the disease in this country {{during the first half of}} the nineteenth century. It is generally agreed that the English physician, or pediatrician, Michael Underwood, was responsible for the first clinical description of poliomyelitis which has been discovered in medical writings. It is found in his Text-book on Diseases of Children. Here a somewhat <b>doubtful</b> <b>account</b> appears in the earlier editions, notably that of 1793, to be amplified and improved in another section of the fourth English edition of 1799, and in subsequent editions. The condition to which Underwood referred in these articles is probably poliomyelitis, but it is not a graphic description of the disease. It implies that the types of paralysis which the author had seen arose from a number of causes, including "teething, or foul bowels, [...] . " Other probable accounts of poliomyelitis can be extracted (though with some difficulty) from the works of Shaw" 5 and Abercrombie ' in England, in 1 823 and 1 828 respectively, but what seems to be a far better description is that of Monteggia" 2 in Italy in 1829. He believed he was dealing with a special kind of paralysis of children initiated by fever of two or three days ' duration. In 1836 (four years before Heine's epochal work) Badham's ' report appeared, in which four cases were accurately described. They occurred during the summer of 1835 in the small community of Worksop, England, and represent the earliest group of recognized epidemic cases. Badham's paper prompted Heine, an orthopedist of Cannstadt, Germany, to report his own experiences with a larger number of cases in a monograph 7 published in 1840. It may suffice to say that he gave an excellent clinical analysis of the disease, pointing out that the symptoms indi...|$|E

When a sale is made on account, revenue is recorded along with account receivable. Because there is an inherent risk that clients might default on payment, accounts receivable have to be recorded at net realizable value. The portion of the account receivable that is estimated to be not collectible is set aside in a contra-asset account called Allowance for <b>doubtful</b> <b>accounts.</b> At the end of each accounting cycle, adjusting entries are made to charge uncollectible receivable as expense. The actual amount of uncollectible receivable is written off as an expense from Allowance for <b>doubtful</b> <b>accounts.</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{granting}} of credit {{is a necessary}} risk of doing business. If companies only accepted cash, sales would be negatively impacted. In a perfect world, all consumers would pay their bills when they become due. However, {{the fact is that}} some consumers do default on debt. Companies are willing to accept default risk because the value of defaults does not exceed the value of the additional sales generated. This creates an issue in regards to the valuation of uncollectible accounts. In order for a company to disclose the true value of its accounts receivable, it must establish an allowance for bad debt. Traditionally, companies estimate their bad debt expense and the related allowance for <b>doubtful</b> <b>account</b> by one of two methods: 1) As a percentage of total credit sales or 2) An aging of accounts receivable (that assesses a higher likely rate of default, the older the account becomes past due). By their very nature, these methods take into account only endogenous variables based on past experiences. For many years, the aforementioned methods of estimating bad debt were the only viable ways of determining the allowance for bad debts. However, with the explosion of technology and the easy availability of information, a more comprehensive method of determining bad debts seems appropriate. Neural network computer systems, which mimic some of the characteristics of the human brain, have been developed and may offer an alternative method for estimating the allowance for bad debt. These systems can predict what events may happen, analyze what did happen, and adjust the factor weights accordingly for the next set of event predictions. Thus, it is noteworthy to explore the use of neural networks to predict what a reasonable allowance for bad debt should be for an entity based on an array of interacting variables. Since, a neural network can incorporate both endogenous and exogenous variables one would expect to use such a system to develop a tool which gives a better estimation of the allowance for bad debt than the traditional approaches. In the current study, the findings indicate that neural networks over the balance of the time are better predictors of a company’s ending allowance for bad debt than regression. On a case by case basis, even when neural networks provide a less accurate estimate than regression, statistical analyses demonstrated the neural networks are a less volatile method and their predictions are less likely to result in a significant difference from actual allowance. Neither approach provides results that are exactly the same as the actual ending balance of the allowance for bad debt amount. Even though regression provides a more accurate estimate 45 percent of the time, this result is mitigated by two items: 1) On average, the absolute difference between actual and predicted is much lower when neural networks are used and 2) The standard deviation derived when using neural networks is only a third of the standard deviation derived from regression when applied to the absolute differences between the actual and predicted allowance...|$|E

At this time, studies were confined primarily to investigation of more efficient methods of performing {{the first step in}} the estimation procedure: determining the age distribution of accounts. In particular, the applicability of statistical sampling techniques was evaluated. A number of retail establishments now use scientific sampling methods to perform {{the first step in the}} estimation of the allowance for <b>doubtful</b> <b>accounts.</b> As a continuation of research, the second phase of the allowance estimation problem was a logical area for investigation. While it did not seem likely that all of the judgment factors involved in the setting of loss expectancy rates could be eliminated, it did appear feasible to develop a scientific approach to determining these rates. Accordingly, research into this problem was initiated. This paper discusses a method which has been developed. In addition, some of the managerial implications of the method are discussed. ...|$|R

2500|$|All {{accounts}} have corresponding {{contra accounts}} {{depending on what}} transaction has taken place e.g., when a vehicle is purchased using cash, the asset account [...] "Vehicles" [...] is debited as the vehicle account increases, and simultaneously the asset account [...] "Bank" [...] is credited due to the payment for the vehicle using cash. Some balance sheet items have corresponding contra accounts, with negative balances, that offset them. Examples are accumulated depreciation against equipment, and allowance for bad debts (also known as allowance for <b>doubtful</b> <b>accounts)</b> against accounts receivable. United States GAAP utilizes the term contra for specific accounts only and doesn't recognize {{the second half of}} a transaction as a contra, thus the term is restricted to accounts that are related. For example, sales returns and allowance and sales discounts are contra revenues with respect to sales, as the balance of each contra (a debit) is the opposite of sales (a credit). To understand the actual value of sales, one must net the contras against sales, which gives rise to the term net sales (meaning net of the contras).|$|R
