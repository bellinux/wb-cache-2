40|$|Disk logging is a {{fundamental}} building block for fault-tolerance system design because it captures a persistent snapshot of critical system state for subsequent recovery {{in the case of}} failures. Logging typically is required to be synchronous with respect to the underlying hardware device to ensure absolute recoverability. Therefore speeding up synchronous <b>disk</b> <b>write</b> is critical to those fault tolerance systems that are based on disk logging. This paper describes a novel track-based disk logging technique that is able to signi cantly reduce the latency of synchronous <b>disk</b> <b>writes</b> to the minimum without compromising data integrity guarantee. As an application of track-based disk logging, we present the design and implementation of a low-write-latency disk system called Trail, which rst buers an incoming synchronous <b>disk</b> <b>write</b> request at a persistent log disk, signals to software the completion of the <b>disk</b> <b>write,</b> and asynchronously performs the write operation on a normal data disk. In the event of system failures, Trail's recovery mechanism guarantees the integrity of those data blocks that are buered at the log disk but not yet committed to the data disk at the time of failure. Through a fully operational Trail prototype, we demonstrate that Trail achieves the best known disk logging performance so far, which is close to data transfer delay plus command processing overhead. A 4 -KByte <b>disk</b> <b>write</b> takes less than 1. 5 msec.

While various studies have investigated the effectiveness of providing error correction, there has been relatively little research incorporating teachers' beliefs, practices, and students' preferences in <b>written</b> <b>error</b> correction. The current study adopted features of an ethnographic research design in order to explore the beliefs and practices of ESL teachers, and investigate the preferences of L 2 students regarding <b>written</b> <b>error</b> correction {{in the context of a}} language institute situated in the Brisbane metropolitan district. In this study, two ESL teachers and two groups of adult intermediate L 2 students were interviewed and observed. The beliefs and practices of the teachers were elicited through interviews and classroom observations. The preferences of L 2 students were elicited through focus group interviews. Responses of the participants were encoded and analysed. Results of the teacher interviews showed that teachers believe that providing <b>written</b> <b>error</b> correction has advantages and disadvantages. Teachers believe that providing <b>written</b> <b>error</b> correction helps students improve their proof-reading skills in order to revise their writing more efficiently. However, results also indicate that providing <b>written</b> <b>error</b> correction is very time consuming. Furthermore, teachers prefer to provide explicit written feedback strategies during the early stages of the language course, and move to a more implicit strategy of providing <b>written</b> <b>error</b> correction in order to facilitate language learning. On the other hand, results of the focus group interviews suggest that students regard their teachers' practice of <b>written</b> <b>error</b> correction as important in helping them locate their errors and revise their writing. However, students also feel that the process of providing <b>written</b> <b>error</b> correction is time consuming.

The instruments utilized {{in this study are}} questionnaires and students’ writing scripts. A guided descriptive essay entitled: “My Family” was administered for the pre-test. The pre-test writing scripts were checked and graded based on explicit <b>written</b> <b>error</b> correction, also known as “direct” or “over” error corrections (Ferris, 2004). Four treatment sessions for one month duration were carried out before the post-test with the same title was administered again. The writing scores of both the pre-test and post-test were graded based on Chia’s (2010) writing scoring rubrics. The scoring rubrics consist of four writing variables: content, organization and development, readability and grammar and mechanics. A paired sample t-test was performed to compare the students’ performance in their pretest and post-test. The findings of this study reveal that the students performed well after <b>written</b> <b>error</b> correction where the total mean score for pre-test is 5. 71 and 8. 17 (sig. 0. 001) for the post-test. The writing variable which benefits most from <b>written</b> <b>error</b> correction is the fourth variable, grammar and mechanics. The pre-test mean for grammar and mechanics is 5. 77 and the post-test mean is 8. 82 (sig. 0. 001). The three section questionnaire used in this study was adapted from Amrheria (2010) and Grami (2005). The data collected from the questionnaires were analysed descriptively. The findings depicted that the students’ opinions were positive (between “agree” and “strongly agree”) towards <b>written</b> <b>error</b> correction with a total of 90. 1 percent (mean: 4. 2).

The {{aim of this study}} was to explore the features of <b>writing</b> <b>errors</b> in Chinese patients with AD and amnestic mild cognitive impairment (a-MCI), as well as to study the relationship between their <b>writing</b> <b>errors</b> and neuropsychological functions. Methods: In this study, we performed an observational study in a group of subjects including 17 AD patients, 14 patients with a-MCI, and 16 elderly healthy controls. We analyzed the <b>writing</b> <b>errors</b> in these subjects and also studied the relationship between their <b>writing</b> <b>errors</b> and neuropsychological functions. Results: Our study showed that in patients whose mother tongue is Chinese, writing ability was comparatively well preserved in the MCI phase but significantly impaired when the disease progressed to the stage of AD. The <b>writing</b> <b>errors</b> showed corresponding increase with the severity of cognition decline, both in the types of errors and rate of occurrence. Analysis of the <b>writing</b> <b>errors</b> showed that word substitution and unintelligible words were the most frequent error types that occurred in all the three study groups. The occurrence rate of unintelligible words was significantly higher in the AD group compared with the a-MCI group (P = 0. 024) and control group (P = 0. 018). In addition, the occurrence rates of word substitution were also significantly higher in AD (P = 0. 013) and a-MCI groups (P = 0. 037) than that of control group. However, errors such as totally no response, visuospatial impairment, paragraph agraphia, ideograph, and perseverative <b>writing</b> <b>errors</b> were only seen in AD group. Besides, we also found a high occurrence rate of visuoconstructional errors (13. 3 %) in our AD group. Conclusions: Our study confirmed that agraphia is an important feature in patients with AD.
