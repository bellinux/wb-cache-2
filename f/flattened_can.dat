40|$|With {{the trend}} towards {{increasing}} number of cores in chip multiprocessors, the on-chip interconnect that connects the cores needs to scale efficiently. In this work, we propose the use of high-radix networks in on-chip interconnection networks and describe how the <b>flattened</b> butterfly topology <b>can</b> be mapped to on-chip networks. By using high-radix routers to reduce {{the diameter of the}} network, the flattened butterfly offers lower latency and energy consumption than conventional on-chip topologies. In addition, by exploiting the two dimensional planar VLSI layout, the on-chip <b>flattened</b> butterfly <b>can</b> exploit the bypass channels such that non-minimal routing can be used with minimal impact on latency and energy consumption. We evaluate the flattened butterfly and compare it to alternate on-chip topologies using synthetic traffic patterns and traces and show that the <b>flattened</b> butterfly <b>can</b> increase throughput by up to 50 % compared to a concentrated mesh and reduce latency by 28 % while reducing the power consumption by 38 % compared to a mesh network. ...|$|R

Finally, we compare the shape of the density spectrum at ion scales to theoretical predictions based on a cascade model for kinetic turbulence. We conclude that the shape of the spectrum, including the ion scale <b>flattening,</b> <b>can</b> be captured by the sum of passive density fluctuations at large scales and kinetic Alfven wave turbulence at small scales...|$|R

40|$|An {{application}} of deuteride moderator for fast reactor cores is proposed for power <b>flattening</b> that <b>can</b> mitigate thermal spikes and alleviate {{the decrease in}} breeding ratio, which sometimes occurs when hydrogen moderator is applied as a moderator. Zirconium deuteride is employed in a form of pin arrays at the inner most rows of radial blanket fuel assemblies, which works as a reflector in order to flatten the radial power distribution in the outer core region of MONJU. The power <b>flattening</b> <b>can</b> be utilized to increase core average burn-up by increasing operational time. The core characteristics have been evaluated with a continuous-energy model Monte Carlo code MVP and the JENDL- 3. 3 cross-section library. The result indicates that the discharged fuel burn-up can be increased by about 7 % relative to that of no moderator in the blanket region due to the power flattening {{when the number of}} deuteride moderator pins is 61. The core characteristics and core safety such as void reactivity, Doppler coefficient, and reactivity insertion that occurred at dissolution of deuteron were evaluated.

40|$|A random-phase {{approximation}} (RPA) {{treatment of}} edge magnetoplasmons (EMP) is presented for strong magnetic fields, low temperatures, and integer filling factors ν. It is valid for negligible dissipation and lateral confining potentials smooth {{on the scale}} of the magnetic length ℓ_ 0 but sufficiently steep that the Landau-level (LL) <b>flattening</b> <b>can</b> be neglected.

40|$|Abstract. For {{functional}} programs, unboxing {{aggregate data}} {{structures such as}} tuples removes memory indirections and frees dead components of the decoupled structures. To explore the consequences of such optimizations in a whole-program compiler, this paper presents a tuple flattening transformation and a framework that allows the formal study and comparison of different flattening schemes. We present our transformation over functional SSA, a simply-typed, monomorphic language and show that the transformation is type-safe. The flattening algorithm defined by our transformation has been incorporated into MLton, a wholeprogram, optimizing compiler for SML. Experimental results indicate that aggressive tuple <b>flattening</b> <b>can</b> lead to substantial improvements in runtime performance, a reduction in code size, {{and a decrease in}} total allocation without a significant increase in compilation time...|$|R

40|$|We report {{numerical}} simulation of pure continuum-based laminar gas micro-flow convection with steep density gradients, which cause, {{for the case}} of heated air, flattening and rate of flattening of axial velocity profile. This flattening {{is similar to the}} characteristics in constant-properties slip flow, and high rate of <b>flattening</b> <b>can</b> cause hydrodynamic undevelopment of flow-the reverse process of hydrodynamic development. By continuity, radially outward velocities and radial convection are induced, which degrades convection performance. The low densities near the wall reduce the axial mass flux near the wall, which also degrades convection performance. In heated-gas micro-flows, these negative effects dominate to dictate the net convection characteristics, which differ considerably from the known characteristics of conventional continuum models. The identification of such microscale effects also has implications in possibly extending the limits of applicability of continuum models to higher Knudsen numbers...|$|R

Precisely, we assume that the fluctuations of the geometric <b>flattening</b> <b>can</b> be modeled by an admissible class of diffusion processes respecting some invariance properties. This model allows us to determine an explicit drift component in the dynamical flattening and the second zonal harmonic whose origin comes from the stochastic term and is responsible for short term effects. Using appropriate numerical scheme, we perform numerical simulations showing the role of the stochastic perturbation on the short term dynamics. Our toy-model exhibits behaviors which look like the experimental one. This suggests to extend our strategy with a more elaborated model for the deterministic part...|$|R

40|$|Model {{checking}} {{is emerging}} as a practical tool for detecting logical errors in early stages of system design. We investigate the model checking of hierarchical (nested) systems, i. e. finite state machines whose states themselves can be other machines. This nesting ability is common in various software design methodologies and is available in several commercial modeling tools. The straightforward way to analyze a hierarchical machine is to flatten it (thus, incurring an exponential blow up) and apply a model checking tool on the resulting ordinary FSM. We show that this <b>flattening</b> <b>can</b> be avoided. We develop algorithms for verifying linear time requirements whose complexity is polynomial {{in the size of}} the hierarchical machine. We address also the verification of branching time requirements and provide efficient algorithms and matching lower bounds. 1 Introduction Finite state machines (FSMs) are widely used in the modeling of systems in various areas.

40|$|Environments of disk-dominated {{galaxies and}} simple disk systems-compared to systems with bulges-provide {{a means to}} explore how {{environment}} relates to galaxy morphology. Our approach focuses on systems with edge-on disks where disk-to-bulge ratios and disk <b>flattening</b> <b>can</b> be unambiguously determined and focuses on simple disks as evolutionary tracers. We study possible physical neighbors around the target disk galaxies and seek statistical relationships between local galaxy density and galaxy morphology. Galaxies consisting of simple stellar disks exist in environments ranging from the relatively the isolated field to moderate density galaxy groups. This distribution overlaps with that of systems with prominent bulges, although galaxies with large bulges are systematically rarer at low densities. The presence of simple disk galaxies in isolation and also in moderate density galaxy groups suggests that simple disks develop naturally in low density regions but have a limited ability to survive significant interactions with other galaxies. Simple disks thus are rare in denser galaxy systems where galaxy transformations are frequently driven by intense initial merging and later strong interactions...|$|R

40|$|A quasi-microscopic {{treatment}} of edge magnetoplasmons (EMP) is presented for very low temperatures and confining potentials smooth {{on the scale}} of the magnetic length ℓ_ 0 but sufficiently steep at the edges such that Landau level (LL) <b>flattening</b> <b>can</b> be discarded. The profile of the unperturbed electron density is sharp and the dissipation taken into account comes only from electron intra-edge and intra-LL transitions due to scattering by acoustic phonons. For wide channels and filling factors ν = 1 and 2, there exist independent EMP modes spatially symmetric and antisymmetric with respect to the edge. Some of these modes, named edge helicons, can propagate nearly undamped even when the dissipation is strong. Their density profile changes qualitatively during propagation and is given by a rotation of a complex vector function. For ν > 2, the Coulomb coupling between the LLs leads to a repulsion of the uncoupled fundamental LL modes: the new modes have very different group velocities and are nearly undamped. The theory accounts well for the experimentally observed plateau structure of the delay times {{as well as for the}} EMP's period and decay rates. Comment: 12 pages, 6 figure...|$|R
40|$|Recent {{progress}} in the heating capability in the large helical device [O. Motojima et al., Phys. Plasmas 6, 1843 (1999) ] has allowed the highest average beta value (4. 1 %) obtained in the helical devices, and enables exploration of magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) stability in this beta region. MHD activities in the periphery are found to become stable spontaneously from the inner region to the outer region when the averaged beta value exceeds a threshold, and then a flattening of the electron temperature profile is observed around the resonant surface. Such a <b>flattening</b> <b>can</b> be formed externally by producing an m/n= 1 / 1 magnetic island, and the complete stabilization of the m/n= 1 / 1 mode is demonstrated by the moderate island width. In addition, attempts to control peripheral plasmas are also performed by using a limiter and a local island divertor utilizing the m/n= 1 / 1 island, to improve plasma confinement and, especially, to stabilize pressure-driven modes in the present study. The stabilization of peripheral MHD modes is obtained with both approaches, and this indicates that these are available {{to the production of}} higher-beta plasmas without edge MHD activities...|$|R
