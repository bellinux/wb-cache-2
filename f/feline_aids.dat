40|$|Anemia of {{inflammatory}} disease (AID) {{is the most}} common anemia in humans and animals but has been investigated in the cat only in a few, mainly experimentally studies. The pathogenesis in AID is multifactorial, resulting from decreased iron availability, a decline in erythrocyte survival time and a decreased response to anemia. The aim of this clinical study was to describe the course of AID, laboratory parameters important for the diagnosis and pathogenesis of AID and the therapy of 26 cats with {{inflammatory disease}}s (abscess [a] n= 13, pyothorax [pt] n= 7, pyometra [pyo] n= 1, mycobacterial infection n= 1, fat necrosis [fn] n= 4). Cats with a positive FeLV/FIV test result, with a neoplasia, nephro- or hepatopathy as well as animals with blood loss anemia were excluded from the study. A complete blood cell count, clinical chemistry, serum concentrations of erythropoietin (EPO), iron and ferritin, the total iron binding capacity (TIBC), the acute-phase-proteins &# 61537; 1 -AGP and haptoglobin, the osmotic fragility (OF) of erythrocytes as well as a direct Coombs test were performed. The hct was monitored over 3 - 51 days (mean 15. 5, median 11). Eleven of 26 cats were anemic on presentation, whereas 12 cats developed anemia during hospitalization. Three other cats did not develop anemia; the hematocrit (Hct) of 2 cats decreased within the reference range (pt, fn) and an increase was noted in one cat (a). The anemia was predominantly mild (47. 9 %) to moderate (39. 1 %), but in some cases (13 %) also severe. The Hct decreased  depending on the timepoint of measurement  from the 2 nd to 7 th day after hospitalization and decreased further throughout a period of 3 - 16 days. In 6 cats the Hct values were within the reference range 2 - 18 days after surgery (a), 18 days after start of the therapy (pt) and 10 - 19 days after surgery (fn). On the other hand 17 of the cats remained anemic over various timespans: up to 29 days (a), up to 16 days (pt), up to 40 days (pyo) or 51 days (mycobacterial infection) and 15 days (fn). In 95. 6 % of patients the anemia was mainly normocytic, whereas a constant microcytic anemia was present in one cat (4, 4 %). A temporary mild macrocytosis occured in 3 cats (13 %). In all patients, anemia was predominantly normochromic with only a few measurements of hypo- or hyperchromic anemia (26. 1 % and 21. 7 %). In 73. 9 % of cases the anemia was non-regenerative, whereas in 6 cats (26. 1 %) a mild regeneration (43, 200 - 84, 450 aggregated reticulocytes/µl) was noticed. Leukocytosis (18. 9 - 150. 0 &# 61620; 109 /l) was observed in 22 of 26 and a left shift in 12 of 19 patients, however the cats without leukocytosis also developed an AID. The acute-phase-protein &# 61537; 1 -AGP was elevated in all examined 19 patients over a period of 7 days prior to 14 days after surgery. Haptoglobin however was elevated in 16 of 19 cats and within the reference range in 3 animals 5, 7 and 14 days after beginning of the therapy. Neither the Hct value nor the number of aggregated reticulocytes showed an inverse correlation with the number of leukocytes, the &# 61537; 1 -AGP or haptoglobin concentration. Conspicuous results were a lowered albumin/globulin-ratio in 92. 3 % of the patients as well as hypoalbuminemia (84. 6 %) and hyperglobulinemia (76. 9 %). These results agree with abnormalities seen in the acute-phase-reaction. As opposed to documentations on serum iron levels for humans and dogs cats rarely (13 %) had lowered serum iron levels. However 47. 8 % of the cats had levels within the lower third of the reference range. As TIBC was often (39. 1 %) lowered or within the lower third of the reference range (47. 8 %) and was never elevated and the ferritin concentration was predominantly (60. 9 %) elevated and never lowered, it seems that these parameters are helpful for the diagnosis of the AID and for the differentiation from an iron deficiency anemia. The positive Coombs test in 2 of 10 examined cats (pt: IgG positive, mycobacterial infection: C 3 b positive), a mild hyperbilirubinemia in 6 of 26 cats (23. 1 %) and an elevated OF of erythrocytes in 2 of 17 animals (11. 8 %) led to the assumption of a shortening of the erythrocyte survival time. In spite of a mild to moderate anemia, EPO concentrations of 30. 8 % of the cats were within the reference range and only slightly elevated in 61. 5 % of the animals. There was no inverse correlation between the EPO concentrations and the parameters of anemia (hct, hemoglobin concentration, number of erythrocytes). Therefore an inadequate EPO production is an important pathomechanism of AID in the cat. Furthermore the bone marrow regeneration response to produced EPO seems to be insufficient, because anemia was non-regenerative in 6 of 8 cats with slightly elevated EPO concentrations. Only one cat (7. 7 %) had high EPO concentrations and had to be euthanized because of its poor condition. A high EPO, as with AID in humans, may be associated with a negative prognosis. A specific therapy of the anemia is usually not necessary because AID in humans and dogs is normally mild. In most animals it was possible to resolve the anemia by treating the underlying disease. However, 3 cats needed 2 - 4 blood transfusions either because of the severity of anemia or for stabilisation before anesthesia. In this study it was shown that feline anemia of inflammatory disease is usually mild to moderate, non-regenerative and normocytic, normochromic. An inflammation, however, may also result in a severe, transfusion-dependent anemia, so that frequent Hct controls are indicated in <b>feline</b> patients with <b>AID.</b> As in humans the pathogenesis of AID seemed to be multifactorial, due to evidence of a shortened erythrocyte survival time, an iron sequestration and an inadequate production of EPO. To this point in time it has not been studied whether EPO, which is used to treat human AID, might be useful in cats with AID...|$|R

40|$|Feline {{immunodeficiency}} virus (FIV), the lentivirus of domestic cats responsible for <b>feline</b> <b>AIDS,</b> establishes a latent infection in peripheral blood CD 4 + T-cells approximately {{eight months after}} experimental inoculation. In this study, cats experimentally infected with the FIV-C strain in the asymptomatic phase demonstrated an estimated viral load of 1 infected cell per approximately 103 CD 4 + T-cells, with about 1 copy of viral DNA per cell. Approximately 1 in 10 proviral copies was capable of transcription in the asymptomatic phase. The latent FIV proviral promoter was associated with deacetylated, methylated histones, {{which is consistent with}} a condensed chromatin structure. In contrast, the transcriptionally active FIV promoter was associated with histone acetylation and demethylation. In addition, RNA polymerase II appeared to be paused on the latent viral promoter, and short promoter-proximal transcripts were detected.

40|$|In {{order to}} map linear B epitopes in feline {{immunodeficiency}} virus (FIV) envelope glycoproteins (Env), a random library of FIV Env polypeptides fused to beta-galactosidase and expressed in Escherichia coli was screened by using sera from experimentally FIV-infected cats. We mapped five antibody-binding domains {{in the surface}} envelope glycoprotein (SU 1 to SU 5) and four in the transmembrane envelope glycoprotein (TM 1 to TM 4). Immunological analysis with 48 serum samples from naturally or experimentally infected cats of diverse origins revealed a broad group reactivity for epitopes SU 2, TM 2, and TM 3, whereas SU 3 appeared as strictly type specific. To study selection pressures acting on the identified immunogenic domains, we analyzed structural constraints and distribution of synonymous and nonsynonymous mutations (amino acids unchanged or changed). Two linear B epitopes (SU 3 and TM 4) appeared to be submitted to positive selection for change, a pattern of evolution predicting their possible involvement in antiviral protection. These experiments provide a pertinent choice of oligopeptides for further analysis of the protective response against FIV envelope glycoproteins, as a model to understand the role of antibody escape in lentiviral persistence and to design <b>feline</b> <b>AIDS</b> vaccines...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Fourteen {{cases of}} {{feline leukemia virus}} (FeLV) -associated {{enteritis}} were immunohistologically examined {{for the expression of}} FeLV proteins gp 70, p 27, and p 15 E in the jejunum, mesenteric lymph nodes, spleen, and bone marrow. Results were compared with those of FeLV-infected cats without intestinal alterations. Other viral infections and specific bacterial, fungal, and parasitic infections were excluded by standard micro-biologic methods, histopathology, immunohistology, and in situ hybridization. In FeLV-associated enteritis, FeLV gp 70 and p 15 E were strongly expressed in intestinal crypt epithelial cells. In contrast, FeLV-positive cats without intestinal alterations showed only faint staining for gp 70 and p 15 E and comparatively strong p 27 expression in these cells. Findings suggest a direct relation between FeLV infection and alterations in intestinal crypt epithelial cells that may be attributed to the envelope proteins gp 70 and p 15 E and/or their precursor protein. Distinct similarities to the intestinal changes in the experimentally induced FeLV–feline AIDS syndrome are obvious, suggesting that naturally occurring <b>feline</b> <b>AIDS</b> variants may be responsible for FeLV-associated enteritis.

40|$|Feline {{immunodeficiency}} virus (FIV) {{is classified as}} a member of the genus Lentivirus (subfamily Lentivirinae) of the Retroviridae family on basis of its morphology, biochemical characteristics, genomic organization, Mg'+ dependent reverse transcriptase, and nucleotide sequence homology with other members of this genus. Lentiviruses cause chronic, lifelong infections in their respective host species, which may be followed by a slowly progressive and degenerative disease. FIV was first isolated from a domestic cat suffering from an immunodeficiency syndrome reminiscent of AIDS in humans. Subsequently it was shown that upon FIV infection, domestic cats may develop an immunodeficiency syndrome, hallmarked by secondary and opportunistic infections. The clinical stages preceding the final stage of <b>feline</b> <b>AIDS,</b> are similar to those observed in humans with HIV infection: the acute stage is followed by the asymptomatic carrier (AC) stage, after which a persistent generalized lymphadenopathy (PGL) gradually leads to the stage of AIDS related complex (ARC). Then the animal develops full blown AIDS. The different stages of F 1 V infection of cats may often not be quite distinct and rapid transitions between the respective stages may be observed (see below). FIV infections occur virtually worldwide in domestic cats and to date three viral clades (A, B, and C) with partially overlapping geographical distributions have been identified on basis of env sequences...|$|E
40|$|Feline {{immunodeficiency}} virus (FIV), the causative agent of an {{acquired immunodeficiency syndrome}} in cats (<b>feline</b> <b>AIDS),</b> is a ubiquitous health threat to the domestic and feral cat population, also triggering disease in wild animals. No registered antiviral compounds are currently available to treat FIV-infected cats. Several human antiviral drugs have been used experimentally in cats, but not without the development of serious adverse effects. Here {{we report on the}} treatment of six naturally FIV-infected cats, suffering from moderate to severe disease, with the antiretroviral compound (R) - 9 -(2 -phosphonylmethoxypropyl) - 2, 6 -diaminopurine ([R]-PMPDAP), a close analogue of tenofovir, a widely prescribed anti-HIV drug in human medicine. An improvement in the average Karnofsky score (pretreatment 33. 2 ± 9. 4 %, post-treatment 65 ± 12. 3 %), some laboratory parameters (ie, serum amyloid A and gammaglobulins) and a decrease of FIV viral load in plasma were noted in most cats. The role of concurrent medication in ameliorating the Karnofsky score, as well as the possible development of haematological side effects, are discussed. Side effects, when noted, appeared mild and reversible upon cessation of treatment. Although strong conclusions cannot be drawn owing to the small number of patients and lack of a placebo-treated control group, the activity of (R) -PMPDAP, as observed here, warrants further investigation. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|The <b>feline</b> <b>AIDS</b> {{model for}} HIV- 1 {{treatment}} {{failed in the}} 1990 s, due to structural features resembling protease inhibitor (PI) resistant HIV- 1 variants. Widespread drug-resistance to PIs now invokes the possibility of rescuing feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) {{as a model for}} PI treatment. We analyzed the susceptibility of FIV to second generation PIs, lopinavir (LPV), atazanavir (ATV), and the structurally unrelated non-peptidic PI tipranavir (TPV). We found that FIV protease resembles HIV- 1 PR drug resistance mutations thus limiting binding of LPV, ATV but not TPV. All three PIs were found to inhibit FIV replication in a concentration-dependent manner, but only TPV showed an EC 50 in a similar order of magnitude as in HIV- 1 based assays. TPV inhibited FIV synergistically with ritonavir. Inhibition of protease activity was confirmed by western blot analysis. Molecular docking showed that the structure of FIV PR allows interactions with TPV which are energetically favorable as compared to drug resistant HIV- 1 PR. The calculated hydrogen bond network was similar to that found in HIV- 1 protease/TPV complexes and involved atoms in the protein backbone. In conclusion, TPV is the first FDA-approved non-NRTI HIV- 1 drug to show anti-FIV properties. The TPV response by FIV may 1) support the idea of using FIV as a small animal model for PI-resistant HIV- 1, thus expanding access to animal AIDS models; and 2) pave the way for the development of novel broad-based inhibitors for treatment of drug resistant HIV- 1...|$|E
40|$|During type 1 human {{immunodeficiency}} virus infection, not only can dendritic cells (DCs) prime T cells against the virus, {{but they can also}} infect them in trans. <b>Feline</b> <b>AIDS</b> is caused by feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) and is considered a model for the human illness because the two diseases have many features in common. Little is known about the interaction of feline DCs with FIV; therefore, this study attempts to tackle such an issue. Infection of feline monocyte-derived DCs (MDDCs) was attempted by spinoculation with FIV strains Petaluma (FIV-Pet) and M 2. FIV-Pet was released rapidly in the supernatants of both infected MDDCs and activated T cells after spinoculation. It is shown that FIV-Pet was produced by MDDCs by monitoring viral content in the supernatants of infected MDDCs, by intracellular staining for p 25 and by showing its cytopathic effect. Although activated T cells were better substrates for FIV replication, leading to prolonged viral shedding, both immature MDDCs and MDDCs matured with lipopolysaccharide supported virus production, mostly during the first 2 days after infection. At later times, FIV induced syncytium formation by MDDCs. Concerning the FIV receptors, MDDCs were shown to be CD 134 -negative and CXCR 4 -positive, a phenotype compatible with permissiveness to FIV-Pet. These results also suggest that maturation is not hampered by FIV infection and that virus exposure itself does not induce MDDC maturation. It is also shown that infected MDDCs; can infect activated PBMCs efficiently in trans. It is concluded that MDDCs can be infected by FIV, although infection does not appear to influence their functionality...|$|E

Genital transmission of FIV was monitored in recipient cats {{by the appearance of}} viral antibodies to FIV Gag proteins and by virus isolation of blood leukocytes as measured by FIV reverse transcriptase activity and FIV-specific PCR. Microbicidal activity was considered effective when the treated cats did not show evidence of FIV infection for up to 18 weeks postchallenge. An aggregate analysis of 46 specific-pathogen-free cats revealed that a single dose of the infected cell inoculum efficiently transmitted FIV infection when delivered into the vagina (100 %) or rectum (66 %). Pretreatment of the vagina or rectum with 2 % WHI- 07 alone or in combination with 0. 25 % VDDTC significantly (P = 0. 004) protected cats from genital transmission by the highly infectious inoculum (7 million FIVBangston-infected feline T cells).

40|$|Human {{immunodeficiency}} virus infection {{is characterized by}} a progressive {{decline in the number of}} peripheral blood CD 4 (+) T lymphocytes, which finally leads to AIDS. This T-cell decline correlates with the degree of in vitro-induced lymphocyte apoptosis. However, such a correlation has not yet been described in <b>feline</b> <b>AIDS,</b> caused by feline {{immunodeficiency virus}} (FIV) infection. We therefore investigated the intensity of in vitro-induced apoptosis in peripheral blood lymphocytes from cats experimentally infected with a Swiss isolate of FIV for 1 year and for 6 years and from a number of long-term FIV-infected cats which were coinfected with feline leukemia virus. Purified peripheral blood lymphocytes were either cultured overnight under nonstimulating conditions or stimulated with phytohemagglutinin and interleukin- 2 for 60 h. Under stimulating conditions, the isolates from the infected cats showed significantly higher relative counts of apoptotic cells than did those from noninfected controls (1 -year-infected cats, P = 0. 01; 6 -year-infected cats, P = 0. 006). The frequency of in vitro-induced apoptosis was inversely correlated with the CD 4 (+) cell count (P = 0. 002), bright CD 8 (+) cell count (P = 0. 009), and CD 4 /CD 8 ratio (P = 0. 01) and directly correlated with the percentage of bright major histocompatibility complex class II-positive peripheral blood lymphocytes (P = 0. 004). However, we found no correlation between in vitro-induced apoptosis and the viral load in serum samples. Coinfection with feline leukemia virus enhanced the degree of in vitro-induced apoptosis compared with that in FIV monoinfected cats. We concluded that the degree of in vitro-induced apoptosis was closely related to FIV-mediated T-cell depletion and lymphocyte activation and could be used as an additional marker for disease progression in FIV infection...|$|E
40|$|Feline {{immunodeficiency}} virus (FIV) is a lentivirus related to human {{immunodeficiency virus}} (HIV) that causes <b>feline</b> <b>AIDS</b> in the domestic cat (Felis catus). Serological surveys indicate that at least 25 other species of cat possess antibodies that cross-react with domestic cat FIV. Most infected nondomestic cat species are without major symptoms of disease. Long-term studies of FIV genome variation and pathogenesis reveal patterns consistent with coadaptation of virus and host in free-ranging FIV-Ple–infected African lions (Panthera leo) and FIV-Pco–infected pumas (Puma concolor) populations. This report examined correlates of immunodeficiency in wild and captive lions and pumas by quantifying CD 5 +, CD 4 +, and CD 8 + T-cell subsets. Free-ranging FIV-Ple–infected lions had immunofluorescence flow cytometry (IFC) profiles marked by a dramatic decline in CD 4 + subsets, a reduction of the CD 4 +/CD 8 + ratio, reduction of CD 8 + β high cells, and expansion of the CD 8 + β low subset relative to uninfected lions. An overall significant depletion in CD 5 + T-cells in seropositive lions was linked with a compensatory increase in total CD 5 − lymphocytes.

40|$|Feline {{immunodeficiency}} virus (FIV) is a naturally occurring lentivirus of domestic cats, {{and is the}} causative agent of <b>feline</b> <b>AIDS.</b> Similar to human {{immunodeficiency virus}} (HIV), the pathogenesis of FIV involves infection of lymphocytes and macrophages, and results in chronic progressive immune system collapse and death. Neuropathologic correlates of FIV infection {{have not yet been}} elucidated, and may be relevant to understanding HIV-associated neurologic disease (neuroAIDS). As in HIV, FIV strains have been shown to express differential tendencies towards development of clinical neuroAIDS. To interrogate viral genetic determinants that might contribute to neuropathogenicity, cats were exposed to two well-characterized FIV strains with divergent clinical phenotypes and a chimeric strain as follows: FIV (PPR, relatively apathogenic but associated with neurologic manifestations), FIV (C 36, immunopathogenic but without associated neurologic disease), and Pcenv (a chimeric virus consisting of a PPR backbone with substituted C 36 env region). A sham inoculum control group was also included. Peripheral nerve conduction velocity, CNS imaging studies, viral loads and hematologic analysis were performed over a 12 month period. At termination of the study (350 days post-inoculation), brain sections were obtained from four anatomic locations known to be involved in human and primate lentiviral neuroAIDS. Histological and immunohistochemical evaluation with seven markers of inflammation revealed that Pcenv infection resulted in mild inflammation of the CNS, microglial activation, neuronal degeneration and apoptosis, while C 36 and PPR strains induced minimal neuropathologic changes. Conduction velocity aberrations were noted peripherally in all three groups at 63 weeks post-infection. Pcenv viral load in this study was intermediate to the parental strains (C 36 demonstrating the highest viral load and PPR the lowest). These results collectively suggest that (i) 32 ̆ 7 C 36 genomic elements contribute to viral replication characteristics, and (ii) 52 ̆ 7 PPR genomic elements contribute to CNS manifestations.

40|$|Feline {{immunodeficiency}} virus (FIV) {{is an important}} pathogen of domestic cats which in some cases can lead to <b>feline</b> <b>AIDS.</b> It shares many similarities with its human counterpart and is studied to understand correlates of immune-protection and mechanisms of disease progression in cats, both to improve the welfare of infected cats and as an animal model for the pathogenesis of HIV infection in humans. FIV is believed to evolve {{during the course of}} infection {{as a result of the}} error prone nature of reverse transcriptase and recombination between viral variants, but relatively little is known about this process in naturally occurring infection. Ultimately, it remains unknown why some infected cats remain healthy while others progress to AIDS rapidly. The studies reported in this thesis addressed this lack of knowledge by examining sequential blood samples obtained during the course of natural FIV infection in a population of 44 privately owned domestic cats. Employing Bayesian coalescent framework, it was demonstrated that the FIV env gene is relatively stable genetically. Although not necessary a prerequisite, this is likely to explain why many naturally infected cats can remain healthy and do not progress to AIDS. By determining the cell tropism of isolated viral variants, it was shown that sick cats were more likely to harbour viruses of the “late” phenotype than healthy animals, similar to the co-receptor switch observed during the progression of HIV infection. Intra-host diversity analyses highlighted a likely role for the leader region of the env gene in viral pathogenesis. Furthermore, recombination was demonstrated to be abundant in natural infection, indicating a requirement for the current phylogenetic classification of FIV to be revised. By assessing the strength and breadth of neutralising antibodies (NAbs), it was shown that NAbs did not appear to influence the course of natural FIV infection, arguing against a role in controlling infection and disease progression. Following an examination of samples collected from a group of privately owned Australian vaccinates, it was shown that the Fel-O-Vax FIV vaccine did not induce cross-reactive neutralising antibodies. Furthermore, in the country where commercial FIV vaccine is licenced, we identified and characterised the virus strain which was likely able to establish infection in vaccinated cat and raised concerns of vaccine’s efficacy. Overall this study broadens our understanding of natural FIV infection, and highlights that much can be learned, not from the similarities but rather by studying the differences between the feline and human lentiviruses. Such comparative studies are likely to contribute to design of highly desirable, safe and fully efficacious lentiviral vaccines. ...|$|E
