The focus of this article is on transformers applied in the transmission of energy, usually called power transformers. Due to very versatile requirements and restrictions in the numerous applications, ranging from a subsea transformer to a wind turbine transformer, a small distribution transformer to a large phase shifter transformer, it is very difcult to organise a structured overview of the transformer types. Also, diﬀerent companies supply diﬀerent markets and each have their own classifcation of the transformers, which makes the transformer family even more difcult to organise. This paper will attempt to provide a relatively common point of view on most of those transformers types...|$|R
25|$|Various {{air quality}} {{measures}} are undertaken {{before and after}} the Olympics Games. Research studies demonstrate that the primary method to reduce concentrations of air pollutants is traffic control, including barring heavy vehicles from the roads. For the Beijing Olympics, vehicles not meeting the Euro 1 emission standards were also banned from the roads, and the odd-even rule was implemented in the Beijing administrative area. Additional air quality improvement measures include replacing coal with natural gas, suspending construction and/or imposing strict dust control on construction sites, closing or relocating the polluting <b>industrial</b> <b>plants,</b> <b>building</b> long subway lines, using cleaner fluid in power plants, and reducing the activity by some of the polluting factories. These were several air quality improvement measures implemented by the Beijing government. There, levels of primary and secondary pollutants were reduced, and good air quality was recorded during the Beijing Olympics on most of the days.|$|R

50|$|In March 1944, {{the region}} was liberated by the Russians, before briefly {{returning}} to German control, during which many Jews were murdered by the panicking Nazis. After being liberated a second time by the 1st Ukrainian Front on March 24, survivors {{and some of those}} deported returned to Zalishchyky. While the Nazi forces had been defeated, conditions hardly improved. While Moscow lauded the liberation of the city, even naming a battle division after the city, Communist control soon proved to be worse than Nazi occupation inn many ways. Starting less than a day after liberation, denizens of Zalishchyky were arrested by SMERSH and presumably murdered by operatives of the NKVD. In October, more than 800 citizens from Zalishchyky were forcibly drafted by the Soviets to fight in the Baltic Offensive, less than 20 survived. After the war, the town was largely repaired, as <b>industrial</b> <b>plants,</b> <b>buildings,</b> and roads were rebuilt and recommissioned. In addition, canneries were widely re-established, leading to the opening of bakeries, dairy plants, corn-calibrating plants, as well as factories which produced textiles and other consumer goods. Much of these industries lasted until the fall of the Soviet Union, after which they collapsed due to newly-independent Ukraine's weak newborn economy.|$|R
40|$|The paper {{proposes a}} {{characterization}} of risks and a service-oriented prototype to face risky situations in work environments, {{such as in}} <b>industrial</b> <b>plants</b> or <b>building</b> construction areas. A risk is the overture of emergencies that produce human and/or material damages. Therefore, it is particularly critical to identify and manage risks to avoid their evolution into emergencies. In this paper, we outline the technological features of a risk environment and propose a risk model and a service-based simulation prototype aimed to improve safety in work environments. We discuss engineering issues concerning risk modeling and management. Furthermore, we propose a risk management system solution and its related implemented prototype composed of services able to detect and also {{to prevent the occurrence}} of risk conditions...|$|R
50|$|Since 2001, a {{nationwide}} program on energy audits for medium and large consuming facilities was initiated. This was a project {{financed by the}} Global Environment Facility (GEF), managed by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), and called “Lebanon Cross Sectoral Energy Efficiency and Removal of Barriers to ESCO Operation”. The initial period 2002-2004 saw delays in project implementation; consequently, the project was essentially restarted with a new project team in 2005 and was operational {{until the end of}} 2009.The project was mainly targeting the high combined consumption of energy in <b>industrial</b> <b>plants</b> and <b>buildings,</b> where the potential for energy savings is important and promising. In 2006, LCEC aimed and worked on creating a market for ESCOs (Energy Service Companies that offer energy efficiency improvement services) where the end user can request a specialized ESCO to conduct an energy audit.|$|R
40|$|Abstract:- The {{buildings}} {{fire safety}} is currently an important subject for researchers and practitioners due to probable incidents {{that can happen}} inside <b>industrial</b> <b>plants,</b> large public <b>buildings</b> or transport facilities: fires, explosions, toxic releases, etc. Even minor events can seriously endanger life, goods and environment. Particularly, fire spreading in large buildings represents a major threat that can be investigated using computer simulation to reduce its severe consequences. The cellular automata based method {{presented in this paper}} represents a fast and interactive tool designed for fire spreading investigation in large buildings.

40|$|There {{are many}} {{advantages}} associated with adding capacitors to industrial & commercial electric systems, including reduced utility bills, greater system capacity, improved voltage regulation, and reduced losses. This paper focuses on estimating the financial {{benefit of the}} loss reduction or energy savings associated with capacitor installations, not the more frequently discussed reduction in power factor penalty. The paper discusses the principal factors involved in estimating {{the amount of energy}} savings and assessing the dollar value of these savings. A step-by-step method for estimating the savings is suggested; some tables and curves of typical equipment and system data are provided to assist with the calculation. While the fundamentals are the same for electrical suppliers (utilities) and users, this discussion emphasizes those aspects most important in <b>industrial</b> <b>plants</b> and commercial <b>buildings...</b>|$|R
40|$|Measurements of gas {{dispersion}} {{from ground}} source were {{performed in a}} boundary layer wind tunnel in VZLU Prague.

These measurements will serve for verification of a new gas dispersion software being developed in VZLU. The dispersion model is intended for use by firemen and ambulance services {{in the case of}} an accident for immediate estimation of the area with dangerous gas concentration. The dispersion model will use precalculated results for chosen areas in the Czech Republic with <b>industrial</b> <b>plants</b> and residential <b>building</b> in the neighborhood.
