5|$|The Federal Bridge Gross Weight Formula, {{also known}} as Bridge <b>Formula</b> <b>B</b> or the Federal Bridge Formula, is a {{mathematical}} formula in use in the United States by truck drivers and Department of Transportation (DOT) officials to determine the appropriate maximum gross weight for a commercial motor vehicle (CMV) based on axle number and spacing. The formula is part of federal weight and size regulations regarding interstate commercial traffic (intrastate traffic is subject to state limits). The formula is necessary to prevent heavy vehicles from damaging roads and bridges. CMVs are most often tractor-trailers or buses, but the formula is of most interest to truck drivers due to the heavy loads their vehicles often carry.|$|E

We show that the partial surjective weak pigeonhole principle for ∏ 1 <b>b</b> <b>formulas</b> implies that for each k there is a string of length 22 nk which is hard to block-recognize by circuits of size nk. These principles in turn imply the partial surjective principle for ∑ 1 <b>b</b> <b>formulas.</b> We show that the surjective weak pigeonhole principle for B(∑ 1 <b>b)</b> <b>formulas</b> in S 21 implies our hard-string principle which in turn implies the surjective weak pigeonhole principle for ∑ 1 <b>b</b> <b>formulas.</b> We introduce a class of predicates corresponding to poly-log length iterates of polynomial time computable predicates and show that over S 21, the multifunction weak pigeonhole principle for such predicates is equivalent to an “iterative” circuit block-recognition principle. A consequence of this is that if S 21 proves this principle then RSA is vulnerable to polynomial time attacks...|$|R
