When hearing loss <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>result</b> <b>of</b> injury or damage to the outer ear or middle ear, it is known as conductive hearing loss. When deafness <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>result</b> <b>of</b> injury or damage to the inner ear, vestibulochoclear nerve, or brain, it is known as sensorineural hearing loss.|$|E
5|$|Ages for star {{clusters}} {{can be estimated}} by comparing the Hertzsprung–Russell diagram for the cluster with theoretical models of stellar evolution. Using this technique, ages for the Pleiades of between 75 and 150 million years have been estimated. The wide spread in estimated ages <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>result</b> <b>of</b> uncertainties in stellar evolution models, which include factors such as convective overshoot, in which a convective zone within a star penetrates an otherwise non-convective zone, resulting in higher apparent ages.|$|E

5|$|Anthropologists {{speculate}} that the functional significance of long head hair may be adornment, a by-product of secondary natural selection once other androgenic/somatic hair (body hair) had largely been lost. Another possibility is that long head hair <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>result</b> <b>of</b> Fisherian runaway sexual selection, where long lustrous hair is a visible marker for a healthy individual. For some groups or individuals, however, short hair is the selected trait.|$|E
5|$|Apart {{from being}} the {{national}} capital, Copenhagen also serves as the cultural hub of Denmark and wider Scandinavia. Since the late 1990s, it has undergone a transformation from a modest Scandinavian capital into a metropolitan city of international appeal {{in the same league}} as Barcelona and Amsterdam. This <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>result</b> <b>of</b> huge investments in infrastructure and culture as well as the work of successful new Danish architects, designers and chefs. Copenhagen Fashion Week, the largest fashion event in Northern Europe, takes place every year in February and August.|$|E
5|$|Background {{selection}} {{is the opposite}} of a selective sweep. If a specific site experiences strong and persistent purifying selection, linked variation tends to be weeded out along with it, producing a region in the genome of low overall variability. Because background selection <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>result</b> <b>of</b> deleterious new mutations, which can occur randomly in any haplotype, it does not produce clear blocks of linkage disequilibrium, although with low recombination it can still lead to slightly negative linkage disequilibrium overall.|$|E

This {{diversity}} <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>result</b> <b>of</b> its fast replication cycle, with the generation of about 1010 virions every day, coupled with a high mutation rate of approximately 3 x 10−5 per nucleotide base per cycle of replication and recombinogenic properties of reverse transcriptase.|$|E

The grieving parents are {{approached}} by an out-of-town lawyer, Mitchell Stephens, who is haunted by his dysfunctional relationship with his drug-addict daughter. Stephens persuades the reluctant parents and bus driver Dolores Driscoll to file a class action lawsuit against the town and bus company for damages, arguing that the accident <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>result</b> <b>of</b> negligence in constructing the barrier or the bus.|$|E

In the Earth, these internal heat sources drive mantle convection, which in turn causes volcanism through plate tectonics.|$|E

5|$|Morchella importuna is {{a species}} of fungus in the family Morchellaceae {{described}} from North America in 2012. It occurs in gardens, woodchip beds, and other urban settings of northern California and the Pacific Northwest region of the United States and Canada. The fungus has also been reported from Turkey, Spain, France, Switzerland, Canada and China, although it is unknown whether this <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>result</b> <b>of</b> accidental introductions.

5|$|Newton's Third Law <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>result</b> <b>of</b> {{applying}} symmetry {{to situations}} where forces {{can be attributed}} to the presence of different objects.

5|$|Pinkham Notch (elevation 2032ft. / 619 m) is a {{mountain}} {{pass in the}} White Mountains of north-central New Hampshire, United States. The notch <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>result</b> <b>of</b> extensive erosion by the Laurentide ice sheet during the Wisconsinian ice age. Pinkham Notch was eroded into a glacial U-shaped valley whose walls are formed by the Presidential, Wildcat, and Carter-Moriah ranges. Due to the volatility of the area's climate and rugged character of the terrain, a number of rare or endemic ecosystems have developed throughout the notch.|$|E

Often ssDNA can <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>result</b> <b>of</b> abnormal replication during S phase through the uncoupling of replication enzymes helicase and DNA polymerase.

5|$|Stereochemical {{affinity}}: {{the genetic}} code <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>result</b> <b>of</b> a high affinity between each amino acid and its codon or anti-codon; the latter option implies that pre-tRNA molecules matched their corresponding amino acids by this affinity.

5|$|The {{differences}} between these two deposits can {{be accounted for by}} a few factors, including time of eruption and placement. The material inside the caldera must be younger and erupted from a pool of magma that had larger crystals.
