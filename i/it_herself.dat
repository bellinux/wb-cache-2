5|$|Haydock also {{considered}} a {{theme in the}} film to be {{the inability of the}} church to fulfill individual spiritual needs. This is said to be shown through many of Joan's encounters with the church; as a girl she is scolded for going to confession too often, denied communion and forced to sneak into the church to take <b>it</b> <b>herself,</b> and during her trial, where she is denied confession until The Conscience confesses her instead.|$|E

She hired a friend to conduct feeding operations in her absence, but was back to do <b>it</b> <b>herself</b> three days after surgery.|$|E
5|$|Regardless of {{the causes}} of the Breeders' hiatus, by early 1995 Deal {{believed}} her next album would be a solo one, and at first intended to play all instruments on <b>it</b> <b>herself.</b> Back at her home in Dayton, Ohio, she practiced the drums and initially prepared six songs for recording. Around the same time, she produced some tracks for Guided by Voices at Easley Studios in Memphis, Tennessee. While there, Deal used a portion of the studio time to record demos for some of her new songs. As an attempt to distract her sister from her drug problems, Deal recruited Kelley to play on three songs at this initial recording session. Kelley's involvement changed Deal's mind about playing all the instruments herself, and she began to conceptualize the album as a band project.|$|E

5|$|Seekers {{has also}} been {{published}} in original English-language manga form. The books are drawn by Bettina Kurkoski, who also drew The Rise of Scourge. The first one, Toklo's Story, was released on February 9, 2010, the same day The Last Wilderness was released. The second, featuring Kallik, called Kallik's Adventure was released on February 8, 2011. The third {{one was going to}} be called Lusa's Tale, But Tokyopop, the graphic novel company, decided not to make any more books for the USA.

5|$|A year later, in October 1889, Eddy {{closed the}} Massachusetts Metaphysical College; {{according}} to Bates and Dittemore, {{the state attorney}} was investigating colleges that were fraudulently graduating medical students. She also foreclosed the mortgage on the land in Boston the church had purchased, then purchased <b>it</b> <b>herself</b> for $5,000 through a middle man, though it was worth considerably more. She told the church they could have the land for their building on condition they formally dissolve the church; this was apparently intended to quash internal rebellions that had been bothering her. The following year she dissolved the National Christian Science Association. Wilson writes that the dissolutions allowed her to create a central church controlled by a five-person board of directors that answered only to her, which gave the church a stability that helped it survive her death.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the final}} {{primaries}} on June 3, 2008, Obama had gained enough delegates {{to become the}} presumptive nominee. In a speech before her supporters on June 7, Clinton ended her campaign and endorsed Obama. By campaign's end, Clinton had won 1,640pledged delegates to Obama's 1,763; {{at the time of}} the clinching, Clinton had 286superdelegates to Obama's 395, with those numbers widening to 256 versus 438 once Obama was acknowledged the winner. Clinton and Obama each received over 17million votes during the nomination process with both breaking the previous record. Clinton was the first woman to run in the primary or caucus of every state and she eclipsed, by a very wide margin, Congresswoman Shirley Chisholm's 1972 marks for most votes garnered and delegates won by a woman. Clinton gave a passionate speech supporting Obama at the 2008 Democratic National Convention and campaigned frequently for him in fall 2008, which concluded with his victory over McCain in the general election on November 4. Clinton's campaign ended up severely in debt; she owed millions of dollars to outside vendors and wrote off the $13million that she lent <b>it</b> <b>herself.</b> The debt was eventually paid off by the beginning of 2013.|$|E

5|$|In 1946, Young {{joined the}} newly created Argonne National Laboratory in 1946 as Director of Technical Information, {{the first woman to}} be {{appointed}} a division head. She would remain at Argonne until she retired in 1964. In 1956, she became the first woman to be appointed chair of the Chicago Section of the American Chemical Society. She was involved in setting up its Distinguished Service Award, and later received <b>it</b> <b>herself</b> in 1975. She was also a fellow of the American Institute of Chemists, the American Association for the Advancement of Science and the Atomic Scientists of Chicago. She was a charter member of the American Nuclear Society and the president of Iota Sigma Pi, a national honor society for women in chemistry. In 1959, the Chicago Tribune named her as one of the city's most distinguished women in business or the professions, and the Argonne National Laboratory established the Hoylande D. Young lecture series in her honor in 1963.|$|E

25|$|After the war, Essinger hired Dr. Fridolin Friedmann to be {{headmaster}} of the school, but {{his tenure}} was brief, caused by her interference with his work.

In 1948, her eyesight failing badly, unable to manage <b>it</b> <b>herself</b> and, according to some, unable to conceive of anyone else running the school, Essinger closed Bunce Court School.|$|E

25|$|An {{ice cream}} maker is a machine {{used to make}} small {{quantities}} of ice cream at home. The machine may stir the mixture by hand-cranking or with an electric motor, and may chill the ice cream by using a freezing mixture, by pre-cooling the machine in a freezer, or by the machine itself refrigerating the mixture. An ice cream maker must freeze the mixture, and must simultaneously stir or churn it to prevent the formation of ice crystals and aerate it to produce smooth and creamy ice cream. In 1843, New England housewife Nancy Johnson invented the hand-cranked ice cream churn. She patented her invention but lacked the resources to make and market <b>it</b> <b>herself.</b> Johnson sold the patent for $200 to a Philadelphia kitchen wholesaler who, by 1847, made enough ice cream makers to satisfy the high demand. From 1847 to 1877, more than 70 improvements to ice cream makers were patented.|$|E
