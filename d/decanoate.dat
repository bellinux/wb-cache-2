25|$|The drug is {{well and}} rapidly absorbed {{with a high}} {{bioavailability}} when injected intramuscularly. The Tmax is 20 minutes in healthy individuals and 33.8 minutes in patients with schizophrenia. The mean T1/2 is 20.7 hours. The <b>decanoate</b> injectable formulation is for intramuscular administration only and {{is not intended to}} be used intravenously. The plasma concentrations of haloperidol <b>decanoate</b> reach a peak at about six days after the injection, falling thereafter, with an approximate half-life of three weeks.|$|E
25|$|Although {{it is not}} {{commonly}} used, methyltestosterone {{is one of the}} few AAS {{that remains}} available for medical use in the United States. The others are testosterone (and esters), nandrolone <b>decanoate,</b> oxandrolone, oxymetholone, and fluoxymesterone.|$|E
25|$|MHC may {{be related}} to mate choice in some human populations, a theory that found support by studies by Ober and colleagues in 1997, as well as by Chaix and colleagues in 2008. However, the latter {{findings}} have been controversial. If it exists, the phenomenon might be mediated by olfaction, as MHC phenotype appears strongly involved in the strength and pleasantness of perceived odour of compounds from sweat. Fatty acid esters—such as methyl undecanoate, methyl <b>decanoate,</b> methyl nonanoate, methyl octanoate, and methyl hexanoate—show strong connection to MHC.|$|E
25|$|The most {{commonly}} used AAS in medicine are testosterone and its various esters (but {{most commonly}} testosterone undecanoate, testosterone enanthate, testosterone cypionate, and testosterone propionate), nandrolone esters (most commonly nandrolone <b>decanoate</b> and nandrolone phenylpropionate), stanozolol, and metandienone (methandrostenolone). Others also available and used commonly but {{to a lesser extent}} include methyltestosterone, oxandrolone, mesterolone, and oxymetholone, as well as drostanolone propionate, metenolone (methylandrostenolone), and fluoxymesterone. Dihydrotestosterone (DHT; androstanolone, stanolone) and its esters are also notable, although they are not widely used in medicine. Boldenone undecylenate and trenbolone acetate are used in veterinary medicine.|$|E
25|$|Non-17α-alkylated {{testosterone}} derivatives such as testosterone itself, DHT, and nandrolone {{all have}} poor oral bioavailability due to extensive first-pass hepatic metabolism and hence are not orally active. A notable {{exception to this}} are AAS that are androgen precursors or prohormones, including dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), androstenediol, androstenedione, boldione (androstadienedione), bolandiol (norandrostenediol), bolandione (norandrostenedione), dienedione, mentabolan (MENT dione, trestione), and methoxydienone (methoxygonadiene) (although these are relatively weak AAS). AAS that are not orally active are used almost exclusively {{in the form of}} esters administered by intramuscular injection, which act as depots and function as long-acting prodrugs. Examples include testosterone, as testosterone cypionate, testosterone enanthate, and testosterone propionate, and nandrolone, as nandrolone phenylpropionate and nandrolone <b>decanoate,</b> among many others (see here for a full list of testosterone and nandrolone esters). An exception is the very long-chain ester testosterone undecanoate, which is orally active, albeit with only very low oral bioavailability (approximately 3%). In contrast to most other AAS, 17α-alkylated testosterone derivatives show resistance to metabolism due to steric hindrance and are orally active, though they may be esterified and administered via intramuscular injection as well.|$|E
25|$|Synthetic anabolic–androgenic steroids (AAS), like {{nandrolone}} (as an ester like nandrolone <b>decanoate</b> or nandrolone phenylpropionate), are agonists of the {{androgen receptor}} (AR) similarly to testosterone {{but are not}} usually used in HRT for transgender men or for androgen replacement therapy (ART) in cisgender men. However, {{they can be used}} in place of testosterone with similar effects, and can have certain advantages like less or no local potentiation in so-called androgenic tissues that express 5α-reductase like the skin and hair follicles (which results in a reduced rate of skin and hair-related side effects like acne, oily skin, seborrhea, excessive body hair growth, and, in particular, male-pattern baldness), although this can also be disadvantageous in a few aspects of masculinization (specifically facial hair growth, body hair growth, and clitoral enlargement). Although many AAS are not potentiated in androgenic tissues, they have similar effects to testosterone in other tissues like bone, muscle, fat, and the voice box. Also, many AAS, like nandrolone esters, are aromatized into estrogens to a greatly reduced extent relative to testosterone or not at all, and for this reason, are associated with reduced or no estrogenic effects (e.g., gynecomastia). AAS that are 17α-alkylated like methyltestosterone, oxandrolone, and stanozolol are orally active but carry a high risk of liver damage, whereas AAS that are not 17α-alkylated, like nandrolone esters, must be administered by intramuscular injection (via which they act as long-lasting depots similarly to testosterone esters) but have no more risk of liver damage than does testosterone.|$|E

50|$|Zuclopenthixol <b>decanoate</b> induces a {{transient}} dose-dependent sedation. However, {{if the patient}} is switched to maintenance treatment with zuclopenthixol <b>decanoate</b> from oral zuclopenthixol or from i.m. zuclopenthixol acetate the sedation will be no problem. Tolerance to the unspecific sedative effect develops rapidly.|$|E
50|$|<b>Decanoate</b> ester prodrugs {{of various}} {{pharmaceuticals}} are available. Since decanoic acid is a fatty acid, forming a salt or ester {{with a drug}} will increase its lipophilicity and its affinity for fatty tissue. Since distribution of a drug from fatty tissue is usually slow, one may develop a long-acting injectable form of a drug (called a Depot injection) by using its <b>decanoate</b> form. Some examples of drugs available as a <b>decanoate</b> ester include nandrolone, fluphenazine, bromperidol, and haloperidol.|$|E
50|$|As a {{long acting}} injection, {{zuclopenthixol}} <b>decanoate</b> {{comes in a}} 200 mg and 500 mg ampoule. Doses can vary from 50 mg weekly to the maximum licensed dose of 600 mg weekly. In general, the lowest effective dose to prevent relapse is preferred. The interval may be shorter as a patient starts on the medication before extending to 3 weekly intervals subsequently. The dose should be reviewed and reduced if side effects occur, though {{in the short term}} an anticholinergic medication benztropine may be helpful for tremor and stiffness, while diazepam may be helpful for akathisia. 100 mg of zuclopenthixol <b>decanoate</b> is roughly equivalent to 20 mg of flupentixol <b>decanoate</b> or 12.5 mg of fluphenazine <b>decanoate.</b>|$|E

50|$|Some of the high-potency {{antipsychotics}} {{have been}} formulated as the <b>decanoate</b> ester (e.g. fluphenazine <b>decanoate)</b> {{to allow for}} a slow release of the active drug when given as a deep, intramuscular injection.

Depot injections can also be used for involuntary community treatment patients to ensure compliance with a community treatment order when the patient would refuse to take daily oral medication.

50|$|A depot {{injection}} is an injection, usually subcutaneous, intradermal, or intramuscular, that deposits a drug in a localized mass, {{called a}} depot, {{from which it}} is gradually absorbed by surrounding tissue.

Depot injections may be available as certain forms of a drug, such as <b>decanoate</b> salts or esters. Examples of depot injections include Depo Provera and haloperidol <b>decanoate.</b> Prostate cancer patients receiving hormone therapy usually get depot injections as a treatment or therapy.

Naltrexone may be administered in a monthly depot injection to control opiod abuse; in this case, the depot injection improves compliance by replacing daily pill administration.|$|E
