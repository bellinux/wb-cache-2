25|$|The {{traditional}} and sometimes treacherous relationships continued between the villages and bands with {{the independence of}} Mexico in 1821. By 1835 Mexico had placed a bounty on Apache scalps (see scalping) but certain villages were still trading with some bands. When Juan José Compà, {{the leader of the}} Copper Mines Mimbreño Apaches, was killed for bounty money in 1837, Mangas Coloradas (Red Sleeves) or Dasoda-hae (He <b>just</b> <b>sits</b> <b>there)</b> became the principal chief and war leader; in the same 1837 Soldado Fiero (aka Fuerte), leader of the Warm Springs Mimbreño Apaches, was killed by Mexican soldiers near Janos, and his son Cuchillo Negro (Black Knife) became the principal chief and war leader. They (being now Mangas Coloradas the first chief and Cuchillo Negro the second chief of the whole Tchihende or Mimbreño people) conducted a series of retaliatory raids against the Mexicans. By 1856, authorities in horse-rich Durango would claim that Indian raids (mostly Comanche and Apache) in their state had taken nearly 6,000 lives, abducted 748 people, and forced the abandonment of 358 settlements over the previous 20 years.|$|E

6000|$|In the German {{school the}} method is {{somewhat}} different. One hour every day {{is devoted to the}} same language. The idea is not to give the lad time between each lesson to forget what he learned at the last; the idea is for him to get on. There is no comic foreigner provided for his amusement. The desired language is taught by a German school-master who knows it inside and out as thoroughly as he knows his own. Maybe this system does not provide the German youth with that perfection of foreign accent for which the British tourist is in every land remarkable, but it has other advantages. The boy does not call his master [...] "froggy," [...] or [...] "sausage," [...] nor prepare for the French or English hour any exhibition of homely wit whatever. He <b>just</b> <b>sits</b> <b>there,</b> and for his own sake tries to learn that foreign tongue with as little trouble to everybody concerned as possible. When he has left school he can talk, not about penknives and gardeners and aunts merely, but about European politics, history, Shakespeare, or the musical glasses, according to the turn the conversation may take.|$|E

5000|$|Regarding its typography, Bissett noted, [...] "I {{like the}} prose to have rhythm, style and energy. Boyracers was {{supposed}} to feel like pop music. Adam Spark {{was supposed to}} feel like the speech of a hyperactive child. Death of a Ladies’ Man was supposed to feel like being on cocaine. In all three I was going for flash and kinetics. I’ve never really been capable of writing prose that <b>just</b> <b>sits</b> <b>there</b> on the page, functionally telling the story." ...|$|E
5000|$|The {{project is}} an {{abstraction}} {{of the interaction}} between a human and his/her data. As Bob van Luijt states on chds.io: [...] "A human being is able to contextualize data, and it’s the context that gives data its value. But a computer merely observes my data, based on algorithms that try to give context. That context makes sense sometimes, but often it doesn’t make sense at all.

50|$|And the big scene {{between her}} and her ex-lover, I had started on a song for him because it's his scene. And Hal Prince, who {{directed}} it, said he thought that the second act needed a song for her, and this was the scene to do it in. And so he directed the scene {{in such a way that}} even though the dramatic thrust comes from the man's monologue, and she <b>just</b> <b>sits</b> <b>there</b> and reacts, he directed it so you could feel the weight going to her reaction rather than his action.|$|E
50|$|Biggs's {{variant of}} the chip fire game is one where a vertex q is allowed to go into debt. In other words, it is allowed to be a {{negative}} integer unlike all the other vertices. This vertex q is called the bank. The bank does not fire. It <b>just</b> <b>sits</b> <b>there</b> collecting chips. Eventually, q will accumulate so many chips that no other vertex can fire which will make the configuration stable. Once the configuration is stable, vertex q can fire chips to neighbouring vertices to jump start the 'economy'. The bank can only fire {{if and only if}} the current configuration is stable.|$|E

5000|$|The song added a {{new term}} to the American lexicon: [...] "Whistling 'Dixie'" [...] is a slang {{expression}} meaning [...] "engaging in unrealistically rosy fantasizing."

[...] indicates that the addressee is serious about the matter at hand.|$|R
5000|$|In a 1973 {{interview}} with Music Star, guitarist Dave Hill recalled {{the making of}} the song's video after in relation to his fear of heights: [...] "We were making a special film for Top of the Pops at a power station. I was wearing a silver suit so they decided to film me walking along an overhead ledge as though I was a spaceman who'd just landed. It was very high up and I suddenly looked down at the ground. That was a mistake because I just froze. I had this terror of falling and I just froze completely, like a cat does when it gets stuck up a tree. You know, you watch that cat and you know it could get down the same way it came up - but the cat's too frightened, and it <b>just</b> <b>sits</b> <b>there</b> till somebody rescues it." ...|$|E

Then there’s the kind where the badness expands and metastasizes, taking on a jaw-dropping life of its own, pushing through to ever-higher levels of garishness. The Book of Henry ... is of the latter, you’ve-got-to-see-it-to-disbelieve-it variety." [...] The Guardian's Peter Bradshaw, in a critical review, said that, [...] "in its pure misjudged ickiness, bad-acting ropiness, and its quirksy, smirksy passive-aggressive tweeness, this insidiously terrible film could hardly get any more skin-crawling." [...] Writing for Vulture, Emily Yoshida opined, [...] "It does not suffice to call The Book of Henry bad; it’s nonfunctional, so poorly conceived {{from the ground up}} as to slip out of the grasp of the usual standards one applies to narrative film. It might be admirable if it wasn’t such torture to watch." ...|$|E
5000|$|His {{final game}} at Michigan State was a 10-10 tie with Notre Dame at Spartan Stadium on November 19, 1966. It was hyped as [...] "The Game of the Century" [...] because both teams were undefeated, untied and ranked atop the {{national}} polls entering the contest (Notre Dame was #1 at 8-0-0, Michigan State #2 at 9-0-0). Early {{in the first}} quarter, Smith tackled Fighting Irish starting quarterback Terry Hanratty, who suffered a separated left shoulder on the play. Hanratty was replaced {{for the remainder of}} the match by Coley O'Brien. Smith, who admitted that Hanratty's injury actually backfired on the Spartans, stated, [...] "That didn't help us any. It just let them put in that O'Brien who's slippery and faster and gave us more trouble. The other guy <b>just</b> <b>sits</b> <b>there</b> and waits, and that's what we wanted." [...] Michigan State finished second behind Notre Dame in the final voting for the national championship.|$|E

5000|$|Austen {{describes}} Mr. Rushworth as [...] "a heavy young man, {{with not}} more than common sense". Mr. Rushworth is perceived by all the characters, {{with the exception of}} his mother, as a fool. He is described by Joseph Donohue Jr. as a [...] "wealthy simpleton". Sir Thomas notes that he has no eye for business. He doesn't know how to act in society or what the appropriate action is for most situations.

After that Brian was placed under arrest and sent to a mental hospital, while Bruce is sent to live with his aunt and mother's sister, Susan Drake. When he grew older, Bruce attended Science High School. Due to his extremely high intelligence level {{and the fact that he}} had for all practical purposes turned off his emotions years ago, he had no friends at the school and was subjected to harassment.

50|$|Don't <b>Just</b> <b>Sit</b> <b>There</b> is a {{television}} show on Nickelodeon that first aired in 1988 and lasted for three seasons. The show was a talk show mixed with a comedy sketches.

The basic concept of the show was to give kids ideas for different things they could do rather than just sitting and watching TV, hence the title. Out of Order was the house band on the series, they would later get to sing on the show as well as participate in sketches.|$|R
