5|$|The {{bank has}} gained <b>its</b> <b>funding</b> from {{different}} sources, {{and the main}} contributors have shifted over time.

The organization believed the flooding of the Yukon Flats would cause critical damage to Alaska waterfowl and promoted the alternative Susitna Hydroelectric Project to supply Alaska's electric needs. This was followed in early 1961 by an Alaska Sportsmen's Council resolution that criticized the Corps of Engineers for reducing <b>its</b> <b>funding</b> for studies {{of the impact of}} the project on fish and game stocks.

Another private operator, Aqua Express, had already ceased operations of a passenger-only service from Kingston to Seattle after a few months in 2005 due to poor ridership and increasing fuel costs.|$|E
