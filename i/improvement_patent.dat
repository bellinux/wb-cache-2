IRP released the Voice-Matic series of 4×1 and 8×1 automatic mixers using [...] "Dynamic Threshold Sensing" [...] that weighed {{a combination of}} the amplitude and history of the signal to determine channel access. The master output was attenuated at the rate of 3dB for every doubling of NOM. This master output reduction was the solution used by Yamaha Pro Audio two decades later in their DME series of digital signal processing (DSP) products, incorporating an automixer function which was otherwise an 8- or 16-channel noise gate.|$|E

Ineffective liability laws further the distribution of unreliable and insecure software.

5000|$|Originally, most {{of their}} {{machines}} were rebuilt Linotypes. By 1917, however, Intertype was producing three models of its own machine. Most of the original patents for the Linotype had expired and so the basic works of the Intertype were essentially the same, though incorporating at least 51 <b>improvement</b> <b>patents.</b> The standard Intertype could cast type up to thirty points and they also offered a [...] "Composing Stick Attachment" [...] that allowed their caster {{to be used to}} cast headlines up to 60 points.|$|R

5000|$|NSMS {{technology}} was patented {{as early as}} 1949, [...] with many <b>improvements</b> <b>patented</b> since that date. Some recent US practitioners believe that NSMS was first developed in 1980, by major aircraft engine OEMs (and the US Air Force). [...] It may be envisioned as a replacement technology to rotating strain gauges, however it is currently used as an essential complement to strain gauges. The technology is widely used for turbo-machinery development and high cycle fatigue (HCF) troubleshooting. Due to the direct blade observation, external mounting and inherent serviceability of the sensors, NSMS has been used since at least 2006 as a long term health monitoring method. [...] More recently, multiple practitioners are becoming active in this application of the technology.|$|R

50|$|Semi-automatic pistols {{were just}} {{beginning}} to appear when Colonel Fosbery (1832-1907) devised a revolver that cocked the hammer and rotated the cylinder by sliding the action, cylinder and barrel assembly back on the frame. The prototype was a modified Colt Single Action Army revolver. Fosbery patented his invention 16 August 1895 and further <b>improvements</b> were <b>patented</b> in June and October 1896.|$|R
2500|$|In 1914, {{just before}} the start of the First World War, Gabilondo created a sturdy self-loading pistol based on the Browning Model 1903 and {{chambered}} for the 7.65mm Browning/.32 ACP cartridge. Unusually for the time, the magazine capacity was nine shots instead of the usual six or seven. The pistol was intended for export to the Americas, and despite the small calibre was designed with military and police sales in mind. Other Spanish manufacturers had copied the Browning since around 1905. These copies were less sophisticated than the original, but one was very similar to the eventual Ruby design, the [...] "Victoria" [...] made by Esperanza y Unceta. This was a six-shot model incorporating <b>improvements</b> <b>patented</b> by Pedro Careaga in 1911, and Esperanza y Unceta in 1912. These are believed to have covered the frame-mounted safety (instead of a grip safety on the original Browning), and the substitution of an internal striker for a hammer.|$|R
5000|$|The United States Department of Commerce {{opposed the}} bill [...] "in its entirety" [...] {{due to the}} {{provisions}} limiting damages for infringement and stated that if those sections were not revised, [...] "the resulting harm to a reasonably well-functioning U.S. intellectual property system would outweigh all the bill's useful reforms."

5000|$|The first jungle gym {{was invented}} in 1920 and {{patented}} by lawyer Sebastian Hinton in Chicago. It was sold under the trademarked name Junglegym. The term [...] "monkey bars" [...] appears {{at least as far}} back as the 1930s, though Hinton's initial patent of 1920 appeals to the [...] "monkey instinct" [...] in claiming the benefits of climbing as exercise and play for children, and his <b>improvement</b> <b>patents</b> later that year refer to monkeys shaking the bars of a cage, children swinging on a [...] "monkey runway", and the game of [...] "monkey tag". Hinton's father, a mathematician, had built a similar structure from bamboo when Hinton was a child; his father's goal was to enable children to achieve an intuitive understanding of 3-dimensional space through a game in which numbers for the x, y, and z axes were called out and each child tried to be the first to grasp the indicated junction. Thus the abstraction of Cartesian coordinates could be grasped as a name of a tangible point in space.|$|R

50|$|During the First World War {{the firm}} {{supplied}} the Allies {{with an estimated}} 150,000 Ruby-type self-loading pistols. Ironically, the company had first introduced this design in 1911 as the Victoria, a pistol based on the Browning M1903 with <b>improvements</b> <b>patented</b> by Pedro Careaga in 1911, and by the Esperanza y Unceta company in 1912. These patents may have covered the dual-purpose frame-mounted safety (instead of a grip safety), and the method of machining the serrations on the slide using a lathe. The Victoria was in turn copied by Gabilondo y Urresti in 1914, the only real improvement being to increase the magazine capacity to 9 shots and fit a military style lanyard ring. In 1915 Gabilondo sent examples of the pistols to the French government, and after testing was completed in May 1915, the French decided to accept the Ruby as the Pistolet Automatique, Type Ruby. Substantial contracts were awarded to Gabilondo and eight partner companies, and eventually desperation led to over 40 Spanish arms makers, including Esperanza y Unceta receiving contracts totaling at least 710,000 and perhaps as high as 950,000 pistols. Esperanza y Unceta marked their Ruby-types Model 1914, Model 1915, Model 1916, Astra, Brunswig, and Victoria. They were also stamped with the French military identification mark EU on the frame and {{on the base of}} the magazine.|$|R
40|$|AbstractAmine based CO 2 {{scrubbing}} processes {{have been}} patented since 1930 {{but very few}} process improvements have been reported prior to the oil crisis of 1975 - 1980, {{which led to the}} requirement for more energy efficient processes. Nevertheless most of these patents are solvent oriented. With CO 2 capture technology development, a sharp increase of process <b>improvement</b> <b>patents</b> and scientific articles can be witnessed since 2004 in parallel with the development of new solvents. In this work, a thorough review of patent database and open literature has been carried out in order to be as exhaustive as possible. The individual process modifications and patents are analyzed and then generalised into “elementary” modification groups. These elementary modifications are then sorted into main categories related to their effect on the process. In total, 20 elementary modifications have been sorted into three main categories: absorption enhancement (increasing rich loading or reducing absorption driving force difference along column height), thermal integration (minimizing the rejected heat of process and excessive thermal driving force) and heat pump effect (increasing heat quality with electricity). Figure 1 summarizes these modifications and shows an illustrative flow scheme for each of them. In the final paper, their mean of action will be described and discussed in relation to their induced complexity, flexibility, cost and expected performances...|$|R
