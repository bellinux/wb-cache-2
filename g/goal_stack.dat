The approach we propose is to simulate the evolution of an artificial economy of computer programs. The economy is constructed based on two simple principles so as to assign credit to the individual programs for collaborating on problem solutions. We find empirically that, starting from programs that are random computer code, we are able to evolve systems that solve hard problems. In particular our economy as learned to solve almost all random Blocks World problems with <b>goal</b> <b>stacks</b> 200 blocks high.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a LISP 1. 5 program {{and parts of}} a protocol analysis that model aspects of the behavior on one adult subject (S) solving a set of Guilford's block visualization problems. The model derives from {{a detailed analysis of}} S's thinking aloud protocol on four of these problems. Two problem spaces are postulated to account for S's internal representation of the task. Nine operators, evoked by a production system cum <b>goal</b> <b>stack,</b> are used to describe his encoding and problem solving. The program lags the protocol analysis: It respects the two problem spaces but incorporates only five of the nine operators, and these are evoked by hand. The principal problem-solving operators in the image space, Process Block and Tally, both programmed, are described, and the behavior they generate is put in correspondence with, and serves as a set of psychological hypotheses for, S's behavior. Their plausibility rests primarily on the closeness of simulation to S's performance, while their generality has scarcely been tested...|$|E
40|$|Most {{parallel}} {{planners are}} sensitive to the order in which goals and activity preconditions are specified. A &quot;wrong &quot; ordering can easily cause a solution to be missed. Permuting goals and preconditions on failure in hopes of finding a soluble order is in general computationally unacceptable. Plan splicing is a solution to this problem. Splicing is a violent conflict resolution procedure which involves the cutting of assertion dependencies, recursive demotion or excision of selected activities around the cut, and reinsertion of deachieved goals back {{into the middle of the}} planner's <b>goal</b> <b>stack</b> so that they can be replanned later to mend the plan around the splice. In a temporal planner, after an excision it is further necessary to relieve the &quot;temporal stress &quot; induced on surviving activities by the activities which were excised. This is an important capability for two reasons: first, because the order of achievement can of course not always be known in advance, and secondly because it is desirable to be able to present goals in priority order...|$|E

40|$|ZD is a {{framework}} for constructing libraries of reusable software components. The approach is a formal one, in that the semantics of the representation is based on proofs of program correctness. The correctness of combinations of library components is the central issue of this paper. Modular correctness proving approaches exist and are computationally optimal. Unfortunately, these approaches are too inflexible to configure novel combinations from library components. In the ZD framework, we resolve this problem with a method called proviso proving and propagating. 1 Introduction Programs are plans that describe how certain goals are achieved using other plans. For example, the formal specification of a Stack describes the goals: Items are put on the Stack with the function push; the function pop returns the last item put on the Stack.

40|$|Solar module {{efficiencies}} above 14 % are the avowed aim of thin-film silicon technology. To {{achieve this}} ambitious <b>goal,</b> <b>stacks</b> of layers with properties customized for their purpose like absorption, reflection and conduction are required. To fulfill these demands a precise understanding {{and control of}} the utilized deposition processes is necessary. A variety of in-situ measurement methods are available to determine structure and optical properties of the growing films as well as the composition of the gas phase during deposition. These techniques help to improve the understanding of the complex interplay between gas phase processes and the properties of growing films during chemical vapor deposition. We combine in-situ measurement techniques that allow the determination of material properties during growth, like transmission measurements or in-situ Raman spectroscopy with measurements of the gas phase like optical emission spectroscopy and Fourier-transform-infrared spectroscopy. Accordingly, the knowledge about the silicon deposition process is increased and a precise control of the material growth is enabled. We will present results on the optimization of the plasma deposition of microcrystalline silicon through information obtained in-situ. Using in-situ Raman spectroscopy the crystalline volume fraction and the film temperature are measured. Combining these measurements with optical emission spectroscopy the reaction of the film growth to changes of the plasma composition is observed in-situ. Transmission measurements additionally are applied to provide online information about the absorbance and the reflective index of the growing films. Hence, it is possible to deposit thin silicon films with properties tailored for their application in solar cell devices...|$|R

40|$|Means-ends {{behavior}} {{arises when}} goals (the ends) {{need to be}} suspended to achieve subgoals (the means) and then resumed again. One traditional explanation of such behavior is that cognition stores <b>goals</b> on a <b>stack</b> (the task-goal stack, or TGS). However, the TGS lacks face validity, and the authors propose the memory-as-goal-store (or MAGS) approach instead. A MAGS model explains means-ends performance better than a published TGS model implemented in the same cognitive architecture (ACT-R). Experimental data are presented that contradict even weak predictions of the TGS and support the MAGS view. For example, pending goals intrude more often than chance {{as a function of}} active maintenance. The computational processes of the MAGS model are specific enough to make fine-grained predictions and general enough to explain memory for goals in diverse contexts...|$|R

In order to breed cowpea varieties with larger seeds we introgressed a rare haplotype associated with large seeds at the Css- 1 locus from an African buff seed type cultivar, IT 82 E- 18 (18. 5 g/ 100 seeds), into a blackeye seed type cultivar, CB 27 (22 g/ 100 seed). Four RILs derived from these two parents were chosen for marker-assisted breeding based on SNP genotyping with a <b>goal</b> of <b>stacking</b> large seed haplotypes into a CB 27 background. Foreground and background selection were performed during two cycles of backcrossing based on genome-wide SNP markers. The average seed size of introgression lines homozygous for haplotypes associated with large seeds was 28. 7 g/ 100 seed and 24. 8 g/ 100 seed for cycles 1 and 2, respectively. One cycle 1 introgression line with desirable seed quality was selfed for two generations to make families with very large seeds (28 - 35 g/ 100 seeds). Field-based performance trials helped identify breeding lines that not only have large seeds but are also desirable in terms of yield, maturity, and plant architecture when compared to industry standards. A principal component {{analysis was used to}} explore the relationships between the parents relative to a core set of landraces and improved varieties based on high-density SNP data. The geographic distribution of haplotypes at the Css- 1 locus suggest the haplotype associated with large seeds is unique to accessions collected from Southeastern Africa. Therefore this QTL has a strong potential to develop larger seeded varieties for other growing regions which is demonstrated in this work using a California pedigree...|$|R

If coupled to a CO 2 -free electricity and a low cost heat source, this process is liable to a high efficiency.

To reach such <b>goals,</b> a low-weight <b>stack</b> has been designed, keeping the advantages of the high performing and robust stack previously validated in terms of performance, durability, and cyclability [1], but aiming at reducing the cost by the use of thin interconnects. This low-weight stack has demonstrated at the scale of a 3 -cell stack a good performance of - 1. 0 [*]A[*]cm- 2 at 1. 3 [*]V at 800 [*]°C. Before performing the durability test, preliminary studies at the cell level have been carried out to highlight the effect of two major operating parameters that are the current density and the steam conversion (SC) ratio, those studies being carried out at one temperature, 800 [*]°C. Based on these results, optimized operating parameters have been defined to perform the durability test on the stack, that is - 0. 5 [*]A[*]cm- 2 and a SC ratio of 25 %. Degradation rates around 3 - 4 % 1, 000 [*]h- 1 have been measured. The thermal cyclability of this stack has also been demonstrated with one thermal cycle.

This mission will bridge the huge sensitivity gap between the COMPTEL and OSSE experiments on the Compton Gamma Ray Observatory, the SPI and IBIS instruments on INTEGRAL and the visionary ACT mission. It will, among other things, serve to compile a much larger catalog of sources in this energy range, perform far deeper searches for supernovae, better measure the galactic continuum emission as well as identify {{the components of the}} cosmic diffuse emission. The large field of view will allow MEGA to continuously monitor the sky for transient and variable sources.
