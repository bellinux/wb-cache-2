25|$|During {{the late}} 1970s, {{proposals}} for a modified Hamilton-class cutter with less range or the RN Type 21 frigate with similar anti-submarine capability to a Leander {{but with a}} smaller crew and with less AW, AA and AD. Both these proposals and others for full combat Dutch and FFG-7 frigates were rejected by the Muldoon government {{and in the early}} 1980s a number of retired naval officers and political scientists like Helen Clark and Robert Miles were seriously debating and writing papers and articles, suggesting options such as RN OPVs, the Castle-class and the USCG's WMEC Bear-class. The navy was interested in some of these ideas, but only for the option proposed by the 1978 Defence Review of acquiring 2 OPV vessels to patrol the expanded EEZ and free the Leanders for other uses and for replacement of the inadequate and worn out Lake-class patrol vessels. After the election of the Lange Labour government, thinking on alternatives to frigates for the RNZN had moved towards purpose-built designs rather like the Irish Navy's Eithne patrol corvette, a sort of 1,800-ton high endurance corvette with Leander-like helicopter hangar and pad or small Meko 100–140 designs rather different from those built for Argentina. After the nuclear ships crisis and other events, the acquisition of some Anzac frigates was virtually certain, because the key Labour MP Jim Anderton, either accepted the Anzac ships as a necessary increased self-defence capability with the securing of a nuclear <b>free</b> <b>policy</b> or tacitly agreed not to oppose it like Helen Clark.|$|E
2500|$|During the Cold War, Greenland had a {{strategic}} importance, controlling {{parts of the}} passage between the Soviet Arctic harbours and the Atlantic, {{as well as being}} a good base for observing any use of intercontinental ballistic missiles, typically planned to pass over the Arctic. The United States therefore had a geopolitical interest in Greenland, and in 1946, the United States offered to buy Greenland from Denmark for $100,000,000 but Denmark did not agree to sell. In 1951, the Kauffman treaty was replaced by another one. The Thule Air Base at Thule (now Qaanaaq) in the northwest was made a permanent air force base. In 1953, some Inuit families were forced by Denmark to move from their homes to provide space for extension of the base. For this reason, the base {{has been a source of}} friction between the Danish government and the Greenlandic people. Tensions mounted when, on January 21, 1968, there was a nuclear accident— a B-52 Stratofortress carrying four hydrogen bombs crashed near the base, contaminating the area with radioactive debris. [...] Although most of the contaminated ice was cleaned up, controversy currently surrounds recently declassified information indicating that one of the bombs was not accounted for. [...] A 1995 Danish parliamentary scandal, dubbed Thulegate, highlighted that nuclear weapons were routinely present in Greenland's airspace in the years leading up to the accident, and that Denmark had tacitly given the go-ahead for this activity despite its official nuclear <b>free</b> <b>policy.</b>|$|E

40|$|Objective: The tobacco {{industry}} realized {{early on that}} it had to fight the accumulating evidence regarding the danger of second hand smoke and smoke <b>free</b> <b>policies</b> because both lead to a decrease in the social acceptability of smoking. Several studies were carried out independently of each other to assess {{the extent to which the}} {{tobacco industry}} has interfered in the evidence for and implementation of smoke <b>free</b> <b>policies</b> in different parts of the world. The studies identify industry strategies which have been used to successfully prevent or delay the regulation of second hand smoke around the globe. Methods: Systematic research was carried out of the tobacco industry documents available on the internet made available as a result of litigation in the US. Standard, widely-accepted document search strategies were used to acquire reliable data within the tobacco collections in addition to secondary source materials (media reports, scientific papers, governmental reports etc.). Results: The studies indicate that the tobacco industry has fought smoke <b>free</b> <b>policies</b> around the globe using various common strategies in addition to strategies that tune into regional distinctions. The tobacco industry formed regional environmental tobacco smoke (ETS) consultants programs in order to generate controversy on the issue of second hand smoke (SHS) in Europe, Asia and Latin America. Through its well-organized network of consultants, the tobacco industry avoided regulation of SHS in most of the world. This tobacco industry success frequently translates into a failure to curb the large health and economic burden of second hand smoke to the day...|$|R

Ward has made several analogies between 1980s New Zealanders and the medieval characters in the film. He has said that [...] "Many New Zealanders going overseas for the first time are trusting and almost medieval in their outlook" [...] and has also compared the medievals' attempts to fend off the plague with New Zealand's nuclear <b>free</b> <b>policy</b> (alluded to in the nuclear submarine scene) and its consequences, particularly the Rainbow Warrior bombing. In both cases a small community attempts to determine its own fate {{in the face of a}} larger power. Ward also felt that there were more general similarities between the 14th and 20th centuries, in particular large-scale war and (in the context of 1980s fears about AIDS) terrifying disease. However he has also said that too much can be made of the film's paralleling of the bubonic plague and AIDS.|$|E

It hosts over 200 clubs ranging from The Thinkers (philosophy) club, to the Photography Club. The sheer number of clubs at the school is due to Stuyvesant's relatively <b>free</b> <b>policy</b> of [...] "student rule".

One example of this policy is the Stuyvesant Model UN club, {{which is one of the}} largest clubs in the school.

The club also hosts StuyMUNC, an annual conference organized and run almost entirely by the students. Stuyvesant also has a Junior State of America program (a political debate club). The Stuyvesant Theater Community puts on three student-run productions a year (a fall musical, a winter drama, and a spring comedy) as well as a one-act festival and several smaller studio productions. Key Club International's branch at Stuyvesant was founded in 1990. With over 350 members, it is one of the largest clubs in the school.|$|E

40|$|The {{implementation}} of smoke free policies in inpatient psychiatric facilities, including patient adherence, mental health nursing staff support and provision of nicotine dependence treatment to patients {{has been reported}} to be poor. The extent to which the quality of smoke <b>free</b> <b>policy</b> implementation is associated with patient views of a policy is unknown. We conducted a cross-sectional survey of 181 patients (53. 6 %; n = 97 smokers and 46. 4 %; n = 84 non-smokers) in an Australian inpatient psychiatric facility with a total smoke-free policy. Smokers’ adherence to the policy was poor (83. 5 % smoked). Only half (53. 6 %) perceived staff to be supportive of the policy. Most smokers used nicotine replacement therapy (75. 3 %); although few received optimal nicotine dependence treatment (19. 6 %). Overall, 45. 9 % of patients viewed the smoke <b>free</b> <b>policy</b> in the unit as positive (29. 9 % smokers; 64. 3 % non-smokers). For smokers, adhering to the ban, perceiving staff to be supportive, and reporting that the nicotine replacement therapy reduced cravings to smoke were associated with a more positive view towards the smoke <b>free</b> <b>policy.</b> These findings support the importance of patient adherence, mental health nursing staff support and adequate provision of nicotine dependence treatment in strengthening smoke <b>free</b> <b>policy</b> implementation in inpatient psychiatric settings...|$|E
40|$|Background: Baseline {{data were}} {{collected}} to inform the adoption, implementation and institutionalisation phases of a completely smoke free campus policy at a large Western Australian university with a diverse student and staff community. Methods: An online survey was randomly emailed to staff and students to measure the attitudes towards and the acceptability and enforcement of the policy prior to implementation. In total, 969 respondents completed the survey. Results: General attitudes towards smoking were negative. While smokers, ex-smokers and non-smokers were supportive of smoke <b>free</b> <b>policy</b> on campus, 65. 7 % of respondents felt the campus should be completely smoke free. Respondents indicated a smoke <b>free</b> <b>policy</b> should be stringently enforced. The majority of respondents {{reported that they had}} been exposed to second-hand smoke on campus (n[*]=[*] 768; 79. 5 %). Conclusion: Theory of Organisational Change provides a useful framework to support the implementation of the completely smoke <b>free</b> <b>policy</b> in the University setting. The implementation process needs to consider the broad range of issues associated with implementing a completely smoke <b>free</b> <b>policy</b> and address issues such as safety of smokers, ensuring smokers are not marginalised and ensuring a comprehensive program is implemented. These baseline findings can be used to advocate for the implementation of a comprehensive range of strategies that recognise the addictive nature of tobacco smoking and address attitude and behaviour change, environmental adaptations and effective implementation of the policy. Administration should consider smokers and non-smokers when policy is implemented...|$|E

40|$|Purpose: To {{examine the}} attitudes and {{perceptions}} of faculty, staff and students concerning tobacco policies at a university campus in a tobacco producing state. Methods: A questionnaire was administered to faculty, staff and students to assess knowledge, attitudes and beliefs related to smoking and exposure to second-hand smoke on campus. A 3 -wave e-mailing was used to send the questionnaire. Results: A total of 2, 914 individuals responded to the questionnaire. Majority (60 %) of the participants believed a smoke <b>free</b> <b>policy</b> would be a positive move and could possibly {{improve the quality of}} life for the campus community, while not negatively affecting student enrollment status. Conclusion: Implementing a smoke <b>free</b> <b>policy</b> in university campuses in North America could be acceptable to faculty, staff and students and is unlikely to reduce students enrolment.

40|$|This is a report. Within the <b>FREE</b> <b>policy</b> {{papers on}} {{football}} governance, papers # 1 and # 2 {{focused on the}} demand for further regulation of football from supporters and concluded that supporters have an acute understanding {{of the problems with}} current football governance, and are highly critical of the way the sport is governed at the top level. Various suggestions were made to address the problems highlighted including reform, government intervention and increased supporter involvement. Policy papers # 3 and # 4 explore the issue of increased supporter involvement in football governance further. Policy recommendations in the area strongly focus on the role of supporter trusts and the work of Supporters Direct. However, one of the findings in our conversations with supporters {{is that there is a}} variety of avenues through which they would like to be involved with football.
