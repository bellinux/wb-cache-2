5000|$|Another direct outcome {{from the}} [...] "cheap" [...] credit abroad guided the banks {{to engage in}} {{imprudent}} lending supported by its parent banks. As the interest rate has been free-falling <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Baltic</b> states, <b>the</b> real interest rate on deposit has been dwindling. Throughout the housing bubble period <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Baltic</b> states, <b>the</b> deposit to loans ratio continued to widened - far higher than the entire Euro Area. For that reason, banks <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Baltic</b> states have to borrow abroad heavily denominated in Euros before passing the currency risk to potential customers. As such move was unsustainable; many banks <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Baltic</b> states found themselves [...] "trapped" [...] with high debts denominated <b>in</b> euros. When <b>the</b> housing price <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Baltic</b> states crashed, banks <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Baltic</b> States were unable to re-pay their debts due to high non-performing loans and lacked of liquidity to sufficiently cover their debts to the parent banks.|$|R

25|$|A {{very small}} {{minority}} of Baltic Germans refused again to be resettled and remained <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Baltics</b> past March 1941.

25|$|This {{shattering}} {{defeat in}} 1709 {{did not end}} the war, although it decided it. Denmark and Saxony joined the war again and Augustus the Strong, through the politics of Boris Kurakin, regained the Polish throne. Peter continued his campaigns <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Baltics,</b> and eventually he built up a powerful navy. In 1710 the Russian forces captured Riga, {{at the time the}} most populated city in the Swedish realm, and Tallinn, evicting the Swedes from the Baltic provinces, now integrated in the Russian Empire by the capitulation of Estonia and Livonia.|$|E
25|$|The resettled Germans fled {{west with}} the {{retreating}} German army in 1944. No precise numbers or lists {{are available for}} them. However, several thousand Baltic Germans remained <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Baltics</b> after 1944, but they were subject to widespread discrimination (and possible deportation to Siberia until 1953) by the Soviet authorities ruling Estonia and Latvia. As a result of this, many hid or lied about their Baltic German origins. Most of those who stayed past 1944 were children of mixed ethnic marriages or themselves married to ethnic Estonians, Latvians or Russians and their descendants no longer consider themselves German.|$|E

25|$|Pietism {{spread from}} Germany to Switzerland {{and the rest}} of German-speaking Europe, Scandinavia and the Baltics (where it was heavily influential, leaving a permament mark on the region's {{dominant}} Lutheranism, with figures like Hans Nielsen Hauge in Norway, Carl Olof Rosenius in Sweden, Katarina Asplund in Finland, and Barbara von Krüdener <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Baltics),</b> {{and the rest of}} Europe. It was further taken to North America, primarily by German and Scandinavian immigrants. There, it influenced Protestants of other ethnic backgrounds, taking part in the 18th century foundation of Evangelicalism, a vibrant movement within Protestantism that today has some 300 million followers.|$|E
25|$|Baltic German {{history and}} {{presence}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Baltics</b> {{came to an}} end in late 1939, following the signing of the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact and the subsequent Nazi-Soviet population transfers. Almost all the Baltic Germans were resettled by Nazi Germany under the Heim ins Reich program into the newly formed Reichsgaue Wartheland and Danzig-West Prussia (on the territory of the occupied Second Polish Republic). In 1945, most ethnic Germans were expelled from these lands by the Soviet army. Resettlement was planned for the territory remaining to Germany under terms of the border changes promulgated at the Potsdam Conference, i.e. west of the Oder–Neisse line, or elsewhere in the world.|$|E

25|$|Between 1629 and 1643 the European {{situation}} presented infinite possibilities {{to politicians}} {{with a taste}} for adventure. However, Christian was incapable of a consistent diplomatic policy. He would neither conciliate Sweden, henceforth his most dangerous enemy, nor guard himself against her by a definite system of counter-alliances. Christian contacted the Roman Catholic part of the Thirty Years' War, and offered to broker a deal with Sweden. However, his mediating was highly skewed in favour of the Holy Roman Emperor, and was a transparent attempt of minimising the influence Swedish influence <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Baltics.</b> His Scandinavian policy was so irritating and vexatious that Swedish statesmen advocated for a war with Denmark, to keep Christian from interfering in the peace negotiations with the Holy Roman Emperor, and in May 1643, Christian faced another war against Sweden. The increased Sound Dues had alienated the Dutch, who turned to support Sweden.|$|E
25|$|The {{war against}} the Baltische Landeswehr broke out on the {{southern}} front in Latvia on 5 June 1919. The Latvian democrats led by Kārlis Ulmanis had declared independence like in Estonia, but were soon pushed back to Liepāja by Soviet forces, where the German VI Reserve Corps finally stopped their advance. This German force, led by general Rüdiger von der Goltz, consisted of the Baltische Landeswehr formed from Baltic Germans, the Guards Reserve Division of former Imperial German Army soldiers who had stayed in Latvia, and the Freikorps Iron Division of volunteers motivated by prospects of acquiring properties <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Baltics.</b> This was possible because the terms of their armistice with the Western Allies obliged the Germans to maintain their armies in the East to counter the Bolshevist threat. The VI Reserve Corps also included the 1st Independent Latvian Battalion led by Oskars Kalpaks, which consisted of ethnic Latvians loyal to the Provisional Government of Latvia.|$|E
25|$|The Soviet Union {{denied the}} {{existence}} of the secret protocols to the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact, even though they were widely published by western scholars after surfacing during the Nuremberg Trials. Soviet propaganda also maintained that there was no occupation and that all three Baltic states voluntarily joined the Union – the People's Parliaments expressed people's will when they petitioned the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union to be admitted into the Union. The Baltic states claimed that they were forcefully and illegally incorporated into the Soviet Union. Popular opinion was that the secret protocols proved that the occupation was illegal. Such an interpretation of the Pact had major implications in the Baltic public policy. If Baltic diplomats could link the Pact and the occupation, they could claim that the Soviet rule in the republics had no legal basis and therefore all Soviet laws were null and void since 1940. Such a position would automatically terminate the debate over reforming Baltic sovereignty or establishing autonomy within the Soviet Union – the states never de jure belonged to the union in the first place. This would open the possibility of restoring legal continuity of the independent states that existed in the interwar period. Claiming all Soviet laws had no legal power <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Baltics</b> would also cancel the need to follow the Constitution of the Soviet Union and other formal secession procedures.|$|E

5000|$|Following the {{liberalization}} of financial services <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Baltic</b> states, banks from the Nordic region were competing for market shares <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Baltic</b> states. Thus, this fuelled in capital inflows and credit expansion into <b>the</b> <b>Baltic</b> states. <b>In</b> Latvia, <b>the</b> foreign-owned banks captured more than 60% of financial sectors, while in Lithuania and Estonia exceeded more than 90%. Due to ample global liquidity, the parent banks from the Nordic region were able to offer very low interest rates to <b>the</b> <b>Baltic</b> populations. A significant consequence from the [...] "cheap" [...] credit from the parent banks led to historical low interest rate loan (especially mortgage loans) <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Baltic</b> States. Coupled with overly-optimistic attitudes on the integration with the European Union, investors’ risk appetite on property speculation were higher. Eventually, this led to housing bubble <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Baltic</b> states.|$|R
