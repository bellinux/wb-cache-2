5|$|The one militia man {{killed in}} battle, Thomas Jefferson Short, was later buried {{somewhere on the}} site where the battle occurred. The battle was <b>devastating</b> <b>for</b> Black Hawk and his band, despite the fact that much of his band escaped across the Wisconsin River; {{casualty}} estimates were as high as 70 dead Sauk and Fox, including those killed in action and those drowned. Even so, at least one source called the battle, along with Stillman's Run, one of Black Hawk's major military triumphs.|$|E
5|$|Tragedy {{struck the}} Longstreet family in January 1862. A scarlet fever {{epidemic}} in Richmond, Virginia claimed {{the lives of}} his one-year-old daughter Mary Anne, his four-year-old son James, and eleven-year-old Augustus ("Gus"), all within a week. His 13-year-old son Garland almost succumbed. The losses were <b>devastating</b> <b>for</b> Longstreet and he became withdrawn, both personally and socially. In 1861 his headquarters were noted for parties, drinking, and poker games. After he returned from the funeral the headquarters social life became for a time more somber. He rarely drank, and he became a devout Episcopalian.|$|E
5|$|By {{the end of}} August the North Korean {{troops had}} been pushed beyond their limits {{and many of the}} {{original}} units were at far reduced strength and effectiveness. Logistic problems racked the North Korean Army, and shortages of food, weapons, equipment and replacement soldiers proved <b>devastating</b> <b>for</b> the North Korean units. By late August, the UN command had more combat soldiers in Korea than the North Koreans did, and UN superiority over the air and sea meant the North Koreans were at a disadvantage which was growing daily. North Korean tank losses had been in the hundreds, and they had fewer than 100 tanks {{by the time of the}} Pusan Perimeter fight, to the Americans' 600 tanks. By the end of August the North Koreans' only remaining advantage was their initiative. However, the North Korean force retained high morale and enough supply to allow for a large-scale offensive.|$|E

50|$|It {{is named}} Vastato because {{the area where}} it was built was outside {{the walls of the}} city, in an area where houses had been {{demolished}} (<b>devastated)</b> <b>for</b> defensive reasons. In Latin, vastinium referred to a safety belt within the protective bastions.|$|R
5|$|Following the {{engagement}} at Wisconsin Heights, the militia {{decided to wait}} until the following day to pursue Black Hawk. They heard, but did not understand, Neapope's speech during the night, and to their surprise, when morning arrived their enemy had disappeared. The battle, though militarily <b>devastating</b> <b>for</b> the British Band, had allowed much of the group to escape to temporary safety across the Wisconsin River. The reprieve was short-lived for many – a group of Fox women and children who attempted to escape down the Wisconsin following the battle were captured by U.S.-allied tribes or shot by soldiers further downstream. During the night, while the non-combatants escaped in canoes, Black Hawk and the remaining warriors crossed the river near present-day Prairie du Sac, Wisconsin. The band fled west over rugged terrain toward the banks of the Mississippi River, with a week's head start on the militia.|$|E
5|$|Skanderbeg {{expected}} a reaction so {{he moved with}} 15,000 of his own men to defeat Ali Pasha's army. The two met in the Plain of Torvioll where they camped opposite of each other. The following day, 29 June, Ali {{came out of his}} camp and saw that Skanderbeg had positioned his forces {{at the bottom of a}} hill. Expecting a quick victory, Ali ordered all of his forces down the hill to attack and defeat Skanderbeg's army. Skanderbeg expected such a maneuver and had prepared his own stratagem. Once the opposing forces were engaged and the necessary positioning was achieved, Skanderbeg ordered his forces hidden in the forests behind the Turkish army to strike their rear. The result was <b>devastating</b> <b>for</b> the Ottomans, whose entire army was routed and its commander nearly killed.|$|E
5|$|Leaders of Indonesian {{intelligence}} influential with Suharto {{had initially}} envisaged that invasion, subdual of Fretilin resistance, and integration with Indonesia would be quick and relatively painless. The ensuing Indonesian campaigns up through 1976 were <b>devastating</b> <b>for</b> the East Timorese, an enormous drain on Indonesian resources, were severely damaging to Indonesia internationally, and ultimately a failure. The wanton, wholesale killings by the TNI near the coastal regions {{during the opening}} months of the invasion had driven {{a large portion of}} the population and most of the remaining Falintil into the central regions. This proved counterproductive as it left Indonesian troops fighting against an enemy which was well equipped and had access to agricultural resources and population. The civilian population came to see the Falintil as a buffer against the excesses of the Indonesian forces, which led to heightened support for the resistance. From 1975 to 1977, the Fretilin protected at least 40% of the population who had fled the coastal regions, in inhospitable conditions, with the active support of rallied communities. Schwarz suggests the fact that Indonesian military's power base remained barely dented by the mid-1970s intelligence miscalculations and ongoing failures, was a measure of the military's dominance of Indonesian affairs.|$|E

5|$|At its heyday, the Commonwealth {{comprised}} the territories of present-day Poland, and {{large parts of}} Ukraine, Belarus, Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia, and Russia. It was engaged in the struggles along most of its borders, with only the Western border with the lands of the Holy Roman Empire being relatively peaceful. In its first decades, major conflicts included the Livonian campaign of Stephen Báthory, the interventions in Moldavia, the Danzig rebellion, and the War against Sigismund. Early 17th century saw {{a number of the}} Polish–Swedish wars, the Polish–Ottoman Wars, and the Polish–Russian Wars (Dymitriads, the Smolensk War). The Commonwealth also suffered from a number of Cossacks uprisings, culminating in the devastating Chmielnicki Uprising of 1648. That period also saw some of the Commonwealth's most talented military commanders: Stanisław Żółkiewski (1547-1620), Jan Karol Chodkiewicz (1560-1621), Stanisław Koniecpolski (1593-1646) and Stefan Czarniecki (1599-1665). The Commonwealth managed to hold its weight in most of those conflicts, and scored a number of major victories on all fronts, such as the battle of Kircholm, the battle of Klushino, and had briefly garrisoned Moscow. However, the Chmielnicki Uprising, together with the Russo-Polish War and the Swedish Deluge, all taking place around the same period of the 1650s, proved <b>devastating</b> <b>for</b> the country, resulting in a loss of most of Ukraine to Russia in the Treaty of Andrusovo in 1667. In 1683 the Commonwealth scored its last major victory that resounded on the European scene, the relief of Vienna by king John III Sobieski. During the 18th century, European powers (most frequently consisting of Russia, Sweden, Prussia and Saxony) fought several wars for the control of the territories of the former Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, particularly during the Great Northern War. By the end of the 18th century a series of internal conflicts and wars with foreign enemies (the War of the Bar Confederation) led to the dissolution of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth and the partitioning of most of its dependent territories among other European powers. The final attempts to preserve independence of the Commonwealth, including the political reforms of the Great Sejm, eventually failed on the military front, with the Commonwealth defeats in the Polish–Russian War of 1792 and the Kościuszko Uprising of 1794, ultimately ending in Poland's final partition and the final dissolution of the remains of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth.|$|E

This epidemic was also particularly <b>devastating</b> <b>for</b> the population's ability to recover, since it disproportionately affected infants and young men.

25|$|The {{relative}} {{peace was}} broken in 1264 when Muslims {{in the territories}} recently conquered by Castile and Aragon ("Mudéjars") rebelled, with support from Ibn al-Ahmar I as well as volunteers from North Africa who crossed over through Ibn al-Ahmar's territories. Initially the rebellion went well: Murcia, Jerez, Utrera, Lebrija, Arcos and Medina Sidonia were taken into Muslim control. However, counter-attacks by James I of Aragon and Alfonso X retook these territories, and Alfonso even invaded Granada's territory in 1265. Ibn al-Ahmar soon sued for peace, and the resulting settlement was <b>devastating</b> <b>for</b> the rebelling Muslims: Muslims of Andalusia suffered mass expulsions and their home towns settled by the Christians.|$|E
