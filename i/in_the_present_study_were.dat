30|$|From the above, we can {{conclude}} <b>the</b> following: (1) <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>present</b> <b>study,</b> {{we found no}} false negatives.

(2) PRMC has the ability to find candidates for further work up. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>present</b> <b>study,</b> 40  % of patients with an abnormal PRMC test ended up having PCD as final clinical diagnosis. This number will of course depend greatly upon the group of patients being investigated. (3) PRMC has a high rate of conclusive results (90  % <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>present</b> <b>study).</b> (4) <b>In</b> addition, our results indicate {{that there might be a}} need for reference material for children.|$|R
