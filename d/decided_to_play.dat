However, at that time, the NBA did not accept players until after their college graduating class had been completed. Therefore, Chamberlain was prohibited from joining the NBA for a year, and <b>decided</b> <b>to</b> <b>play</b> for the Harlem Globetrotters in 1958 for a sum of $50,000 (equal to about $ today).|$|E

5|$|The final was {{followed}} by a play-off match for 2nd place between Marshall and Heathcote. The players could not fix another date for the match and <b>decided</b> <b>to</b> <b>play</b> it straight away. By agreement, the match was limited to best-of-three sets. Marshall, playing his second match of the day, defeated Heathcote in straight sets, in front of a diminished crowd, and won the silver prize of seven guineas.|$|E
5|$|Ideal batting {{conditions}} and clear weather greeted {{the players on}} the second day. After only four overs had been bowled in total the previous afternoon, Edrich was relieved of the new ball, which was given to Barnett, who accompanied Bedser. Both bowlers swung the ball into the right-handed Barnes and away from the left-handed Morris. Not a frontline bowler, Barnett focused on bowling defensively at medium pace, and the Australians wanted to make a safe start, so they <b>decided</b> <b>to</b> <b>play</b> him watchfully. This prompted some commentators to claim Barnett had allowed the Australians to settle into their rhythm by not trying to pressure them.|$|E

He had not played a tournament since February 2014, but he started the 2015 Apia International Sydney with a straight-sets win against Sergiy Stakhovsky. In the second round, his {{opponent}} was world No. 19 and top seed Fabio Fognini. It was a tough test for del Potro, but he proved to be stronger than the Italian. Del Potro was through to the quarterfinals, but lost to Mikhail Kukushkin in two tiebreakers. After his Sydney campaign, he was drawn to play Jerzy Janowicz {{in the first round of}} the 2015 Australian Open, del Potro withdrew due to his wrist injury.

5|$|Following the 1989 Finals, on June 28, 1989, after 20 {{professional}} seasons, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar {{announced his}} retirement. The Lakers still cruised through the Pacific Division, winning their ninth consecutive division crown with a 63–19 record. However, after beating the Rockets {{in the first}} round, they lost four games to one {{in the second round}} of the playoffs to the Suns. Riley announced he was stepping down after the season citing burnout, and was replaced by Mike Dunleavy. Riley's departure received a mixed reaction from the players. They respected his contributions, but some, such as Worthy and Scott, had grown tired of his intense practices and felt he tried to take too much credit for the team's successes. Following the season, 1987 Defensive Player of the Year winner Michael Cooper <b>decided</b> <b>to</b> <b>play</b> in Europe and was waived at his request.|$|E

They also {{made it a point}} to book historical concert halls and theaters such as Radio City Music Hall. Following the conclusion of the North American leg, the band moved on to South America before returning to the United States for another run of shows, officially wrapping up the tour in December 2016.|$|E

The event marked Moon’s first time playing in the WSOP, as well as visiting Las Vegas, Nevada and riding in a commercial plane. Due to the poor economy's impact on the logging business, Moon considered keeping the $10,000 instead of entering the tournament, but <b>decided</b> <b>to</b> <b>play</b> after visiting the Rio All Suite Hotel and Casino and watching World Series games there.|$|E
5|$|Song Reader, {{a project}} Beck {{released}} in December 2012, is 20 songs presented only as sheet music, {{in the hopes}} that enterprising musicians will record their own versions. The idea of Song Reader came about nearly fifteen years prior, shortly after the release of Odelay. When sent a book of transcribed sheet music for that album, Beck <b>decided</b> <b>to</b> <b>play</b> through it and grew interested in the world before recorded sound. He aimed to keep the arrangements as open as possible, to re-create the simplicity of the standards, and became preoccupied with creating only pieces that could fit within the Great American Songbook. In 2013 Beck began playing special Song Reader concerts with a variety of guests and announced he was working on a record of Song Reader material with other musicians as well as possibly a compilation of fan versions.|$|E
5|$|The Heiress {{had been}} a Broadway play before it was a film. Richardson so liked his part that he <b>decided</b> <b>to</b> <b>play</b> it in the West End, with Ashcroft as Sloper's {{daughter}} Catherine. The piece was to open in February 1949 at Richardson's favourite theatre, the Haymarket. Rehearsals were chaotic. Burrell, whom Richardson had asked to direct, was {{not up to the}} task – possibly, Miller speculates, because of nervous exhaustion from the recent traumas at the Old Vic. With only a week to go before the first performance, the producer, Binkie Beaumont, asked him to stand down, and Gielgud was recruited in his place. Matters improved astonishingly; the production was a complete success and ran in London for 644 performances.|$|E

The spy tailed Luan Da as he went forth alone, but only saw the mystic walk along the beach.

Angered by Luan Da's deceit, the spy rushed back to the capital before the mystic to inform Emperor Wu. The emperor, incensed at Luan Da's confidence tricks, <b>decided</b> <b>to</b> <b>play</b> along when the mystic returned to see what lies he would tell.|$|E

Sohail Tanvir played for the Royals after getting the {{permission}} of the Pakistan Cricket Board. Tanvir was not able to play in the 2009 IPL due to tense relations between India and Pakistan after the 2008 Mumbai attacks. However it was later decided to move the 2009 edition to South Africa due to 2009 Indian general election, but till then the Pakistani players were either terminated or suspended by their franchisees due to their unavailability. Kamran Akmal could not play for the Royals in the match because of Sri Lanka's tour of Pakistan. It was also the last competitive game played by Warne at the Lord's Cricket Ground.|$|E
5|$|Alonso {{was born}} {{in the small town of}} Tolosa, Gipuzkoa, Basque Country, into a family known for its footballing prowess. His father, Periko Alonso, won La Liga twice in {{successive}} seasons with Real Sociedad and a third time after he joined Barcelona. He also featured in the national team, winning 21 caps over the course of his career. Xabi Alonso lived in the city of Barcelona for the first six years of his life and moved to San Sebastián (Donostia) thereafter. It was here that his passion for football began as he whiled away his childhood playing at Playa de la Concha (Shell Beach). On the Basque sands, Alonso befriended a fellow resident of Calle Matia, Mikel Arteta, and the two would battle each other in exhibitions of technical ability. He was immersed in football and his father would often bring him and his older brother, Mikel, to CE Sabadell's training ground to practice together. Alonso was influenced by his father's playing, taking more pleasure in passing the ball well than shooting at goal. At an early age, he <b>decided</b> <b>to</b> <b>play</b> as a defensive midfielder, a role which helped him learn how to distribute the ball well. This talent would later prove to be an integral part of his club and international career.|$|E
