40|$|The <b>fire</b> <b>performance</b> {{of heavy}} timber frame {{structures}} is often {{limited by the}} poor <b>fire</b> <b>performance</b> of its connections. Conventional timber connections, dowelled or toothed plate connections typically use steel as a connector material. In a fire, the steel parts rapidly conduct heat into the timber, leading to reduced <b>fire</b> <b>performance.</b> Replacing metallic connectors with alternative non-metallic, low thermal conductivity connector materials can, therefore, lead to improved connection <b>performance</b> in <b>fire.</b> This paper presents an experimental study into the <b>fire</b> <b>performance</b> of metal-free timber connections comprising a hot-pressed plywood flitch plate and glassfibre- reinforced polymer dowels. The thermal behaviour of the connections at elevated temperatures is studied using a standard cone calorimeter apparatus and a novel heat transfer rate inducing system. The latter is a fire testing system developed at the University of Edinburgh. The mechanical behaviour of the connection during severe heating was also studied using an environmental chamber at temperatures up to 610 °C. The results demonstrate that heat transfer in the non-metallic connections is governed by the thermal properties of the timber, resulting in significant enhancements in connection <b>fire</b> <b>performance...</b>|$|R

With {{the aim of}} invesgating {{effect of}} the two polymer phases of ABS on {{improved}} <b>fire</b> <b>performance</b> of ABS filled with magnesium hydroxide, we have prepared ABS filled with surface-treated magnesium hydroxide (MH) via compounding poly(styrene-acrylonitrile) (SAN) and polybutadiene filled with MH {{as well as by}} compounding ABS and MH.

40|$|Load-bearing Light Gauge Steel Frame (LSF) {{walls are}} made of cold-formed steel frames and lined with {{fire-resistant}} gypsum plasterboards, and include cavity insulation based on energy performance requirements. Despite {{the importance of their}} <b>fire</b> <b>performance,</b> the current <b>fire</b> design methods rely mostly on a prescriptive approach, which relies on fire resistance ratings (FRR) provided by the wall manufacturers {{due to the lack of}} knowledge of the various parameters affecting the <b>fire</b> <b>performance</b> of LSF walls. This paper identifies the parameters affecting the <b>fire</b> <b>performance</b> of LSF walls, and presents a detailed review of the <b>fire</b> <b>performance</b> of LSF walls as a function of these parameters, based on recent research studies. It discusses the effects of elevated temperature thermal properties, plasterboard fall-off, cavity insulation, wall configuration, and stud section shapes on the thermal performance of LSF walls, and presents a detailed study of the temperature distribution patterns across the stud cross-sections. Negative effects of plasterboard joints are also demonstrated using fire test results. Elevated temperature mechanical properties of steel, time–temperature profiles of walls, stud section shapes and their sizes were found to be affecting the structural performance of LSF walls in fire, and their effects are discussed. The importance of using accurate elevated temperature mechanical properties in determining the FRR of LSF walls is also demonstrated. A good understanding of the identified parameters on the <b>fire</b> <b>performance</b> of LSF walls can lead to the use of a performance-based fire design method, and development of LSF walls with enhanced <b>fire</b> <b>performance...</b>|$|R

30|$|While {{fire test}} regimes {{consider}} {{exposure to the}} standard and experimental fires, testing is generally limited to single-element tests. This involves fire testing of a connection or element in isolation {{from the rest of}} the structure. Single-element fire tests are generally simple tests used to better understand <b>fire</b> <b>performance</b> a single structural element, assembly or connection type. They are useful for a general understanding of that element in isolation. However, they are limited in that they do not capture the <b>fire</b> <b>performance</b> of a structural system assembly, or frame action, as would occur in completed buildings. System-level fire testing of frames and assemblies has the potential to achieve greater understanding of the <b>fire</b> <b>performance</b> of structural systems exposed to high temperatures.|$|R

40|$|Cavity walls {{containing}} combustible insulation {{present an}} increased risk for fire propagation in a confined, concealed space. Damage to the building resulting from ignition of combustible insulation can be extensive; especially so, {{in the absence of}} horizontal and vertical fire-stops. Current codes and standards assess <b>fire</b> <b>performance</b> of exterior wall assemblies subjected to external ignition sources. However, test methods do not address the potential fire hazard resulting from ignition of combustible insulation within the wall cavity. A <b>fire</b> <b>performance</b> test has been developed that evaluates the fire propagation behavior of combustible insulation in a configuration that is representative of the actual installation. The test utilizes a full scale cavity wall assembly and offers <b>fire</b> <b>performance</b> evaluation of insulation of any thickness for either a 51 [*]mm or 102 [*]mm wide air space. A propane sand burner was selected as the ignition source; in addition to being reliable and repeatable, its heat output was carefully calibrated to be representative of potential ignition scenarios that may occur within a cavity wall. During the 15 minute <b>fire</b> <b>performance</b> test, the sample is continuously subjected to the propane sand burner exposure fire. An acceptable sample will produce a peak chemical heat release rate less than 100 [*]kW and a maximum visible flame height less than 1. 8 [*]m. This <b>fire</b> <b>performance</b> test method is being incorporated into FM Approvals Standard for Cavity Walls and Rainscreens, Class Number 4411 [1] and is suitable for incorporation into other codes and standards...|$|R
40|$|Load bearing LSF {{walls are}} {{commonly}} made of cold-formed steel frames, gypsum plasterboards and insulation, and their <b>fire</b> <b>performance</b> {{is an important}} aspect of design. Many experimental and numerical studies have been conducted on the <b>fire</b> <b>performance</b> of LSF walls at the Queensland University of Technology (QUT). These studies have shown that increasing the number or thickness or quality of gypsum plasterboards has improved the fire resistance ratings (FRR) of LSF walls while the use of cavity insulation has reduced their FRR. Therefore new LSF wall systems with external insulation sandwiched between two layers of plasterboards were proposed, which provided higher FRR than cavity insulated walls. There are also other parameters that can improve the <b>fire</b> <b>performance</b> of LSF walls such as the steel type, stud geometry and depth, type of screw fasteners used, joints in the plasterboard and the plasterboard fall off time. This paper presents a review of the <b>fire</b> <b>performance</b> of LSF walls as a function of these parameters based on our research at QUT. Their effects on both the thermal and structural performance of LSF walls are discussed in detail and suitable improvements are recommended, for example, improved plasterboard joint types...|$|R
