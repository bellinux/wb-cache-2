5|$|According to MCC {{guidelines}} for umpires, factors {{to consider when}} giving an lbw decision include the angle at which the ball was travelling and whether the ball was swinging through the air. He must also account for {{the height of the}} ball at impact and how far from the wicket the batsman was standing; from this information he must determine if the ball would have passed over the stumps or struck them. The MCC guidance states that it is <b>easier</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> a decision when the ball strikes the batsman without pitching, but that the difficulty increases when the ball has bounced and more so when there is a shorter time between the ball pitching and striking the batsman.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} {{each school}} day, the player will be given the option to {{navigate}} to various locations within the game's setting. Each choosable location is accompanied by an image of a heroine in order to allow the choices to be <b>easier</b> <b>to</b> <b>make.</b> Throughout gameplay, the player is given multiple options to choose from. Text progression pauses at these points, and depending on the choices that the player makes, the affection rate of the heroine associated with the event will either increase, decrease, or remain the same. This mechanism determines which direction of the plot the player will progress into, but influences the story only during Konomi's and Karin's plot lines.|$|E
5|$|Because of his father's background, Thakkar's {{early years}} in India were spent around actors. During these initial years, Thakkar worked with his father for some time in Mumbai, {{contributing}} to a 1971 Films Division of India documentary, and playing parts in television and radio shows. Thakkar also worked as a voice-over artist for television advertisements. At the same time, Thakkar's interest in mathematics and science remained predominant. Later on, {{he moved to the}} United States as he believed it was <b>easier</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> visual effects movies in Hollywood. Currently, Thakkar stays with his wife and family in Virginia.|$|E

5|$|In {{the latter}} {{parts of the}} game's development, the largest {{challenge}} was to coordinate Guasti's and his collaborators' work; when Guasti started working as a programmer, he learned about project management, and applied it to AM2R, but still found it challenging to have deadlines and keep people motivated, as everyone {{was working on the}} game for free in their spare time. In late 2014, the project was ported to the newer version GameMaker: Studio, which enabled improved loading times and performance, but required the complete rewriting of some features and changes to the designs of some levels. This move also made bugs faster to fix and new builds <b>easier</b> <b>to</b> <b>make,</b> leaving the development progress in a more expedient and productive state. Later in the same year, the developers worked on improving the visuals, giving the fourth area a new graphics tile set intended to give it more personality.|$|E
5|$|Non-dental {{sources of}} pain often cause {{multiple}} teeth to hurt {{and have an}} epicenter that is either above or below the jaws. For instance, cardiac pain (which can make the bottom teeth hurt) usually radiates up from the chest and neck, and sinusitis (which can make the back top teeth hurt) is worsened by bending over. As all of these conditions may mimic toothache, {{it is possible that}} dental treatment, such as fillings, root canal treatment, or tooth extraction may be carried out unnecessarily by dentists in an attempt to relieve the individual's pain, and as a result the correct diagnosis is delayed. A hallmark {{is that there is no}} obvious dental cause, and signs and symptoms elsewhere in the body may be present. As migraines are typically present for many years, the diagnosis is <b>easier</b> <b>to</b> <b>make.</b> Often the character of the pain is the differentiator between dental and non-dental pain.|$|E
5|$|The episode {{starts in}} a {{courtroom}} where Lisa is on trial. The Blue-Haired Lawyer is accusing her of bringing devastation upon Springfield because of her selfish desire {{to be accepted by}} others. Lisa starts telling everyone in the courtroom about her side of the story. A few months ago, she and her family went to the new mall in town. There, she encountered her schoolmates Sherri and Terri and asked them if she could spend some time with them at the mall. The two twins said no to Lisa, which made her realize that she has no real friends. Later, Lisa went on Homer's computer and discovered that it is <b>easier</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> friends online than in real life, and thus she started a social networking website called SpringFace to get friends. The site became instantly popular among all the citizens of Springfield and Lisa made over a thousand friends {{in a short period of}} time. However, Lisa soon noticed that these friends only talked to her on SpringFace and not in real life. She also discovered that the website grew too big to control, with people becoming so addicted to it that they even used it while driving their cars. This caused chaos in the town after numerous car crashes and deaths.|$|E

These snips are commonly used on vinyl or aluminium siding.|$|E

They are also used to align pieces of wood when joined edge-to-edge in making wider panels. It is important {{to use the same}} face when cutting the slots, so the boards are perfectly flush.|$|E
25|$|The grating {{fabrication}} {{challenge was}} eased {{by the discovery}} of a phase moiré effect which provides an all-phase-grating interferometer that works with compact sources, called the polychromatic far-field interferometer (see figure on the right). Phase gratings are <b>easier</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> when compared with the source and analyzer gratings mentioned above, since the grating depth required to cause phase shift is much less than what is needed to absorb x-rays. Phase gratings of 200 - 400 nanometer periods have been used to improve phase sensitivity in table-top PFI imagers. In PFI a phase grating is used to convert the fine interference fringes into a broad intensity pattern at a distal plane, based on the phase moiré effect. Besides higher sensitivity, another incentive for smaller grating periods is that the lateral coherence of the source needs to be at least one grating period.|$|E

25|$|The main {{motives for}} leaving Israel are usually {{connected}} with the emigrants' desire for improved living standards, or to search for work opportunities and professional advancement, for higher education. Polls amongst emigrants {{have shown that the}} political situation and security threats in Israel are not among the main factors in emigration. Emigration is also common amongst new immigrants who did not successfully integrate into Israeli society especially if they were unable to master the Hebrew language or were unable to join the labor force, or who already made one major residence change in their lives and therefore found an additional change <b>easier</b> <b>to</b> <b>make.</b> Some of the immigrants move to a third country, almost always in the West, and some of them return to the country of their origin, a phenomenon which increases when the conditions in the country of origin improve, as occurred in the former USSR {{in the first decade of}} the 21st century.|$|E

500|$|Congregants in {{prosperity}} {{churches are}} encouraged to speak positive statements about {{aspects of their lives}} that they wish to see improved.

Prosperity churches also encourage people to [...] "live without limits" [...] and cultivate optimism about their lives. T. D. Jakes, pastor of The Potter's House non-denominational mega-church, has argued in favor of prosperity, rejecting what he sees as the demonization of success.
