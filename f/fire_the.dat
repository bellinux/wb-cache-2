5|$|An {{estimated}} 35,000 {{people were}} forced to evacuate during the <b>fire.</b> <b>The</b> Red Cross had shelters for evacuees at the Multi-Activity Court located in the UCSB Recreational Center. From May 5 to May 9, 2009, evacuees were also sheltered at San Marcos High School in Goleta.|$|E
5|$|Besieged {{forces would}} {{sometimes}} launch sorties {{in an attempt}} to <b>fire</b> <b>the</b> attackers' camps or equipment. When Hugh Capet besieged Laon in 986–987, his troops became drunk one night, and Duke Charles's men sallied forth and torched the camp, forcing Hugh to abandon the siege.|$|E

5|$|In the 1990s, {{a series}} of Historical Public Exposure Studies were {{conducted}} to assess past releases and public exposures. For example, the figure at right illustrates the calculated lifetime cancer risk to a laborer from the 1957 Rocky Flats <b>fire.</b> <b>The</b> key shows the cancer risk due to exposure during the 1957 event per million persons. This figure means that an outdoor laborer in the reddest part of Arvada would have roughly a two-in-a-million risk of contracting cancer (0.000002) from being outside during the 1957 <b>fire.</b> <b>The</b> original, complete figure - {{as well as many}} others showing the risks of past exposures - can be viewed in the Summary of Findings from the Historical Public Exposure Studies.|$|E

40|$|The ferrite memory arrays {{are made}} from pre-formed metal {{conductors}} for the ferrite arrays. The conductors are made by forming a thin sheet of a metallizing paste of metal alloy powder, drying the paste layer, bisque <b>firing</b> <b>the</b> dried sheet at a first temperature, and then punching the conductors from <b>the</b> <b>fired</b> sheet. During <b>the</b> bisque <b>firing,</b> <b>the</b> conductor sheet shrinks to 58 percent of its pre-fired volume and the alloy particles sinter together.

5|$|The {{landings}} were overwhelmingly successful. On Delta and Alpha beaches, German {{resistance was}} low. The Osttruppen surrendered quickly, {{and the biggest}} threat to the Allies were the mines. A single German gun as well as a mortar position were silenced by destroyer <b>fire.</b> <b>The</b> Allied units in this sector were able to secure a bridgehead and quickly linked up with the paratroopers, capturing Saint-Tropez as well LeMuy. The most serious fighting was on Camel Beach near the town of Saint-Raphaël. This beach was secured by several well-emplaced coastal guns as well as flak batteries. Through heavy German <b>fire</b> <b>the</b> Allies attempted to land at the shore. However, at sector Red of the Camel Beach landing zone the Allies were not able to succeed. A bombing run of 90Allied B-24 bombers was called in against a German strongpoint here. Even with the assistance of naval <b>fire,</b> <b>the</b> Allies were not able to bring the landing ships close to the shore. They decided to avoid Camel Red and land only at the sectors of Camel Blue and Camel Green, which was successful.|$|E
