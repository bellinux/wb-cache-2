40|$|Different elastolytic <b>enzymes</b> were <b>isolated</b> from rat aorta and platelets, {{as well as}} from {{granulocyte}} and pancreatic extracts. The active fractions were purified to electrophoretic apparent homogeneity by precipitation with ammonium sulfate, sequential batch fractionation on DEAE-Sephadex A- 50, {{and finally}} by isoelectric focusing (IF) on Sephadex G- 75 Superfine. The molecular weight and the isoelectric point of the <b>isolated</b> <b>enzymes</b> were estimated by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and by analytical IF, respectively. All the enzymes have elastolytic activity as well as activity toward Suc-(Ala) 3 -NA.

40|$|Enzymes {{are able}} to perform {{reactions}} under mild conditions, e. g., pH and temperature, with remarkable chemo-, regio-, and stereoselectivity. Because of this feature, the number of biocatalysts used in organic synthesis has rapidly increased during the last decades, especially {{for the production of}} chiral compounds. The present review highlights biotechnological processes for the production of chiral alcohols by reducing prochiral ketones. These reactions can be catalyzed by either <b>isolated</b> <b>enzymes</b> or whole cells that exhibit ketone-reducing activity. The use of <b>isolated</b> <b>enzymes</b> is often preferred because of a higher volumetric productivity and the absence of side reactions. Both types of catalysts have also deficiencies limiting their use in synthesis of chiral alcohols. Because reductase-catalyzed reactions are dependent on cofactors, one major task in process development is to provide an effective method for regeneration of the consumed cofactors. In this paper, strategies for cofactor regeneration in biocatalytic ketone reduction are reviewed. Furthermore, different processes carried out on laboratory and industrial scales using <b>isolated</b> <b>enzymes</b> are presented. Attention is turned to process parameters, e. g., conversion, yield, enantiomeric excess, and process strategies, e. g., the application of biphasic systems or methods of in situ (co) product recovery. The biocatalytic production of chiral alcohols utilizing whole cells is presented in part II of this review...|$|R
5000|$|The first {{cause is}} <b>isolated</b> <b>enzyme</b> deficiency. The enzyme {{glycerol}} kinase is encoded by the X-chromosome in humans. It {{acts as a}} catalyst in the phosphorylation of glycerol to glycerol-3-phosphate which {{plays a key role}} in formation of triacylglycerol (TAG) and fat storage. There is no genotype-phenotype correlation in isolated GKD and it can be either symptomatic or asymptomatic. Symptomatic means that GKD shows symptoms when it persists in the body and asymptomatic means that the no symptoms appear in the body. In this deficiency the genotype is not associated with the phenotype. The presence of certain mutations in genes has no relation with the phenotype i.e. any resulting physical traits or abnormality.|$|E
50|$|Cardiolipin (CL) {{is a kind}} of diphosphatidylglycerol lipid. Two {{phosphatidic acid}} {{moieties}} connect with a glycerol backbone in the center to form a dimeric structure. So it has four alkyl groups and potentially carries two negative charges. As there are four distinct alkyl chains in cardiolipin, the potential for complexity of this molecule species is enormous. However, in most animal tissues, cardiolipin contains 18-carbon fatty alkyl chains with 2 unsaturated bonds on each of them. It has been proposed that the (18:2)4 acyl chain configuration is an important structural requirement for the high affinity of CL to inner membrane proteins in mammalian mitochondria. However, studies with <b>isolated</b> <b>enzyme</b> preparations indicate that its importance may vary depending on the protein examined.|$|E
5000|$|DNA Polymerase I was {{the first}} DNA-Directed DNA {{polymerase}} to be isolated from E. coli. Several studies involving this <b>isolated</b> <b>enzyme</b> indicated that DNA pol I was most likely involved in repair replication and was not the main replicative polymerase. [...] In order {{to better understand the}} in vivo role of DNA pol I, E. coli mutants deficient in this enzyme (termed Pol A1−) were generated in 1969 by De Lucia and Cairns. As characterized, this new mutant strain was more sensitive to ultraviolet light, corroborating the hypothesis that DNA pol II was involved in repair replication. The mutant grew {{at the same rate as}} the wild type, indicating the presence of another enzyme responsible for DNA replication. The isolation and characterization of this new polymerase involved in semiconservative DNA replication followed, in parallel studies conducted by several labs. The new polymerase was termed DNA polymerase II, and was believed to be the main replicative enzyme of E. coli for a time. DNA pol II was first crystallized by Anderson et. Al in 1994.|$|E

In this study, a novel type of biocatalyst, Neu 5 Ac aldolase presented on the surface of Bacillus subtilis spores, was used for the production of Neu 5 Ac. Under optimal conditions, Neu 5 Ac at a high concentration (54. 7 g liter− 1) and a high yield (90. 2 %) was obtained under a 5 -fold excess of pyruvate over N-acetyl-d-mannosamine. The novel biocatalyst system, which is able to express and immobilize the target enzyme simultaneously on the surface of B. subtilis spores, represents a suitable alternative for value-added chemical production...|$|R
50|$|Industrial enzymes are {{enzymes that}} are commercially {{used in a}} variety of {{industries}} such as pharmaceuticals, chemical production, biofuels, food & beverage, and consumer products. Due to advancements in recent years, biocatalysis through <b>isolated</b> <b>enzymes</b> is considered more economical than use of whole cells. Enzymes may be used as a unit operation within a process to generate a desired product, or may be the product of interest. Industrial biological catalysis through enzymes has experienced rapid growth in recent years due to their ability to operate at mild conditions, and exceptional chiral and positional specificity, things that traditional chemical processes lack. <b>Isolated</b> <b>enzymes</b> are typically used in hydrolytic and isomerization reactions.

5000|$|The {{polymerase}} is a monomeric protein {{with two}} distinct functional domains. Site-directed mutagenesis experiments support {{the proposition that}} this protein displays a structural and functional similarity to the Klenow fragment of the Escherichia coli Polymerase I enzyme; it comprises a C-terminal polymerase domain and a spatially separated N-terminal domain with a 3'-5' exonuclease activity.The <b>isolated</b> <b>enzyme</b> has no intrinsic helicase activity, but may carry out an equivalent function by way of its strong binding to single stranded DNA, particularly in preference to double stranded nucleic acid. This is the property of this enzyme that makes is favorably applicable to Multiple Displacement Amplification. The enzyme facilitates the [...] "debranching" [...] of double stranded DNA. Deoxyribonucleoside triphoshate cleavage that occurs {{as part of the}} polymerisation process probably supplies the energy required for this unwinding mechanism. The continuous nature of strand synthesis (compared to the asymmetric synthesis seen in other organisms) probably contributes to this enhanced processivity.Proofreading activity conferred by the exonuclease domain was demonstrated by showing the preferential excision of a mismatched nucleotide from the 3' terminus of the newly synthesised strand. [...] The exonuclease activity of the enzyme is, like its polymerisation activity, highly processive and can degrade single stranded oligonucleotides without dissociation. Co-operation or a 'delicate competition' between these two functional domains is essential, so as to ensure accurate elongation at an optimal rate. The exonuclease activity of the enzyme does impede its polymerisation capacity; inactivation of the exonuclease activity by site-directed mutagenesis meant that a 350 fold lower dNTP concentration was required to achieve the same rates of primer elongation seen in the wild type enzyme.|$|E
