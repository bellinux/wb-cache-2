40|$|In this paper, a {{variable}} threshold voice activity detector (VAD) is developed {{to control the}} operation of a two-sensor adaptive noise canceller (ANC). The VAD prohibits the reference input of the ANC from containing some strength of actual speech signal during adaptation periods. The novelty of this approach resides in using the residual output from the noise canceller to control the decisions made by the VAD. Thresholds of full-band energy and zero-crossing features are adjusted according to the residual output of the adaptive filter. Performance evaluation of the proposed approach is quoted in terms of {{signal to noise ratio}} improvements as well mean square error (MSE) convergence of the ANC. The new approach showed an <b>improved</b> <b>noise</b> <b>cancellation</b> performance when tested under several types of environmental noise. Furthermore, the computational power of the adaptive process is reduced since the output of the adaptive filter is efficiently calculated only during non-speech periods...|$|E

40|$|Abstract—In this paper, two new noise {{reduction}} algorithms are presented which are robust to the mismatch problem commonly {{exist between the}} ideal array look direction and actual speaker’s Direction-Of-Arrival (DOA). Deriving a set of leakage constraints and incorporating them into the state-of-the-art Generalized Sidelobe Canceller (GSC) algorithm leads to two new {{noise reduction}} algorithms, namely Constrained Least Mean-Squares Generalized Side-lobe Canceller (CLMS-GSC) and Con-strained Recursive Least-Squares Generalized Sidelobe Canceller (CRLS-GSC). Conducting several simulations, it is demonstrated that the proposed algorithms will flatten the array mainlobe and as a result, can significantly <b>improve</b> <b>noise</b> <b>cancellation</b> of the beamformer {{in the presence of}} DOA mismatch. Simulation results indicate that the proposed algorithms successfully attenuate the closely-placed interferers as well as they are robust to small changes in desired source DOA.

40|$|In {{providing}} acceptable navigational solutions, Location-Based Services (LBS) in land navigation rely {{mostly on}} integration of Global Positioning System (GPS) and Inertial Navigation System (INS) measurements for accuracy and robustness. The GPS/INS integrated system can provide better land-navigation solutions {{than the ones}} any standalone system can provide. Low-cost Inertial Measurement Units (IMUs), based on Microelectromechanical Systems (MEMS) technology, revolutionized the land-navigation system {{by virtue of their}} low-cost miniaturization and widespread availability. However, their accuracy is strongly affected by their inherent systematic and stochastic errors, which depend mainly on environmental conditions. The environmental noise and nonlinearities prevent obtaining optimal localization estimates in Land Vehicular Navigation (LVN) while using traditional Kalman Filters (KF). The main goal {{of this paper is to}} effectively eliminate stochastic errors of MEMS-based IMUs. The proposed solution is divided into two main components: (1) <b>improving</b> <b>noise</b> <b>cancellation,</b> using advanced stochastic error models in MEMS-based IMUs based on combined Autoregressive Processes (ARP) and first-order Gauss-Markov Process (1 GMP), and (2) modeling the low-cost GPS/INS integration, using a hybrid Fuzzy Inference System (FIS) and Second-Order Extended Kalman Filter (SOEKF).

40|$|Background The spatiotemporal {{coupling}} of brainwaves {{is commonly}} quantified using the amplitude or phase of signals measured by electro- or magnetoencephalography (EEG/MEG). To enhance the temporal resolution for coupling delays down to millisecond level, a new power correlation (PC) method is proposed and tested. New method The cross-correlations of any two brainwave powers at two locations are calculated sequentially through a measurement using the convolution theorem. For noise suppression, the cross-correlation series is moving-average filtered, preserving the millisecond {{resolution in the}} cross-correlations, but with reduced noise. The coupling delays are determined from the delays of the cross-correlation peaks. Results Simulations showed that the new method detects reliably power cross-correlations with millisecond accuracy. Moreover, in MEG measurements on three healthy volunteers, the method showed average alpha–alpha coupling delays of around 0 – 20 ms between the occipital areas of two hemispheres. Lower-frequency brainwaves vs. alpha waves tended to have a larger lag; higher-frequency waves vs. alpha waves showed delays with large deviations. Comparison with existing methods The use of signal power instead of its square root (amplitude) in the cross-correlations <b>improves</b> <b>noise</b> <b>cancellation.</b> Compared to signal phase, the signal power analysis time delays do not have periodic ambiguity. In addition, the novel method allows fast calculation of cross-correlations. Conclusions The PC method conveys novel information about brainwave dynamics. The method may be extended from sensor-space to source-space analysis, and can be applied also for electroencephalography (EEG) and local field potentials (LFP) ...|$|R
30|$|Considering the {{similarities}} in the wavelet domain where the data and noise can be efficiently discriminated, 3 D bilateral filtering of the approximation coefficients in a modified neighborhood eliminates the higher magnitude noise components carried into the approximation subbands. Utilizing a group of a square and a line as neighbor to replace the original cubic neighbor for weight estimation improves the computation accuracy. Noticing {{the fact that the}} wavelet subband coefficients of different orientations have different properties of energy clustering, a WNS thresholding has been proposed to threshold the noisy coefficients in the detailed subbands. Exploiting the interscale dependencies among the detailed coefficients tends to improve the performance of wavelet thresholding, and thus, it also enhances the denoising efficiency for MR images with spatially varying noise. In summary, the utilization of neighborhood similarities using wavelet domain bilateral filter and Neighshrink <b>improves</b> the <b>noise</b> <b>cancellation</b> efficiency and preserves the structural information effectively.|$|R
40|$|Algorithms for {{separation}} of heart sounds from background lung sound noises are vital for accurate diagnosis of heart diseases. In this paper, an <b>improved</b> adaptive <b>noise</b> <b>cancellation</b> technique based on the Least Mean Square (LMS) algorithm is used to separate heart sounds from lung sounds. The step size parameter in the LMS algorithm is optimally chosen using a hybrid Nelder-Mead (H-NM) optimization algorithm. The NM algorithm is initialized with a good initial solution by using computationally cheap random search to compute a rough estimate of the global minimum. Initialization of the NM algorithm with a good initial guess avoided convergence to shallow local minima and improved {{the quality of the}} final solution. The effects of using two state-of-the-arts biologically inspired heuristic optimization algorithms instead of the H-NM algorithm and three variants of the standard LMS algorithm are investigated. The correlation coefficient between the ideal and filtered heart sound signal and running time-complexity of different algorithms are taken as the metric for comparison of different heart sound separation approaches. Simulation results indicate that the approach presented in this paper performs significantly better than a variety of alternate approaches on heart sound separation problems...|$|R

40|$|Graph filters play a {{key role}} in {{processing}} the graph spectra of signals supported on the vertices of a graph. However, despite their widespread use, graph filters have been analyzed only in the deterministic setting, ignoring the impact of stochastic- ity in both the graph topology as well as the signal itself. To bridge this gap, we examine the statistical behavior of the two key filter types, finite impulse response (FIR) and autoregressive moving average (ARMA) graph filters, when operating on random time- varying graph signals (or random graph processes) over random time-varying graphs. Our analysis shows that (i) in expectation, the filters behave as the same deterministic filters operating on a deterministic graph, being the expected graph, having as input signal a deterministic signal, being the expected signal, and (ii) there are meaningful upper bounds for the variance of the filter output. We conclude the paper by proposing two novel ways of exploiting randomness to <b>improve</b> (joint graph-time) <b>noise</b> <b>cancellation,</b> as well as to reduce the computational complexity of graph filtering. As demonstrated by numerical results, these methods outperform the disjoint average and denoise algorithm, and yield a (up to) four times complexity redution, with very little difference from the optimal solution...|$|R

(2) These thresholds are self-adjusting. Based on two judgement standards [...] -signal noise rate (impersonal standard) and the articulation of the speech (subjective standard), we did comparison experiments between FBT and ST. Although FBT’s signal noise rate inferior to the ST’s, FBT’s waveform distortion is less than ST’s and FBT’s articulation of the speech is remarkable superior to the ST’s.
