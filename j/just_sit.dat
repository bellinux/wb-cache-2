Where it gets really complex—and you can't be a slacker—is you have to inventorize all these tiny sounds and constantly be trying to fit all of these moving parts together and see what sticks—and it's a lot of repetitive, careful-listening kind of work." ...|$|E

In the Pomoravlje region, this magic was assisted by ala’s herbs, picked in levees and the places on a field where a plow turns around during plowing. These locations were considered unclean because ale visited them. In folk spells of eastern Serbia, a particular ala could be addressed by a female personal name: Smiljana, Kalina, Magdalena, Dobrica, Dragija, Zagorka, etc. An expression for addressing an ala– Maate paletinke– is of uncertain meaning.

Volk noted:"I had all these stories growing up. He [...] was my hero, so I always wanted to go to Michigan. ... And I didn't like Woody [...] anyway.

500|$|Greil Marcus {{highlighted}} {{the importance of}} disregarding one's initial reading of the song. [...] "The first impression is that Bob Dylan is setting up the usual private scene: 'I'll sit here and watch the river flow.' Well, that's certainly a boring idea. It's the implicit message of just about everything James Taylor has ever written". He went on to describe how Dylan explores the difficulty of retaining privacy while making public art; the singer is {{coming to terms with}} unwanted attention inherent in stardom, without giving up his connection to his fans. Marcus argued that the reason the single was not a hit in the US was because [...] "the time has passed when people are interested in hearing Bob Dylan say he'll <b>just</b> <b>sit</b> there and watch the river flow... even though that's not quite what he's saying". For Marcus, [...] "Watching the River Flow" [...] is a compelling work, but the subtlety of the song may have prevented it from reaching a wide audience.|$|E

500|$|Fall Out Boy {{began writing}} {{material}} for a possible successor shortly {{after the release of}} the 2007 album, Infinity on High. In March 2008, the band attempted to enter the Guinness Book of World Records for being the only musical act to perform in all seven continents in nine months, planning to perform in Antarctica for an audience of scientists. However, the group was unable to make the flight from Punta Arenas, Chile to Antarctica due to poor weather. Despite this unsuccessful attempt, the group felt energized from the experience and became inspired to write more music. This led to more material to sift through when the band decided to enter the studio. Fall Out Boy spent time during June 2008 formulating ideas at Avron's home, where [...] "three to four" [...] song ideas were developed. Lead vocalist/guitarist Patrick Stump and bassist/lyricist Pete Wentz began turning these ideas into songs over the following month. Wentz explained that the process was the same as usual: [...] "I'll go over to Patrick's house and he'll kind of <b>just</b> <b>sit</b> there and play songs, and I'll be like, 'Ah, that one's awesome!'" ...|$|E

500|$|Although What You Were Hoping For? was {{acclaimed}} by critics, {{it received}} some backlash from Hunt's fanbase and listeners, who were ambivalent about its stylistic departure from his previous work.

I'm a man that grows, progresses and matures, I want to grow [...] {{with the people who}} want to go with me on that journey ...

[...] What You Were Hoping For? peaked at number 19 on the Billboard Top Heatseekers Albums, which is a weekly music chart that ranks top-selling albums by new or developing acts, defined as those who have never appeared in the top 100 of the Billboard 200 or in the top 10 of Billboards component charts.

500|$|When Windsor {{took over}} the role in 1994, she was unhappy with the way Peggy was being scripted. She has commented, [...] "a few things weren't quite right about Peggy at the beginning. On a purely {{superficial}} level, the wig didn't fit right. And the clothes weren't right either. They appeared too downmarket. I was particularly worried about how the character was viewed by the producer and writers. I saw her as much ballsier than they did. I think they envisioned Peggy as this rather sad, vulnerable lady who spent all her time worrying about her children." [...] However, early in 1995, EastEnders acquired a new executive producer, Corinne Hollingworth, who shared Windsor's vision of Peggy. It was Hollingworth who decided that Peggy would be a central character, the new landlady of The Queen Victoria public house, one of the soap's main focal points. Hollingworth stated that Peggy was [...] "not {{going to be allowed}} to <b>just</b> <b>sit</b> in some flat polishing her nails". Windsor has said: [...] "It was like a dream.
