Hence, in more northern temperate areas, browsing and grazing is more common early in spring and later becomes more restricted. Knowing when plants are ripe for <b>eating</b> <b>is</b> a learned behaviour. Berries may be foraged in bushes or at the tops of trees, and bears try to maximize the number of berries consumed versus foliage. In autumn, some bear species forage large amounts of naturally fermented fruits, which affects their behaviour. Smaller bears climb trees to obtain mast (edible reproductive parts, such as acorns). Such masts can be {{very important to the}} diets of these species, and mast failures may result in long-range movements by bears looking for alternative food sources. Brown bears, with their powerful digging abilities, commonly eat roots. The panda's diet is over 99% bamboo, of 30 different species. Its strong jaws are adapted for crushing the tough stems of these plants, though they prefer to eat the more nutritious leaves. Bromeliads can make up to 50% of the diet of the spectacled bear, which also has strong jaws to bite them open.|$|E

25|$|These {{explanations}} are complementary rather than mutually exclusive—all instances of behaviour require an explanation {{at each of}} these four levels. For example, the function of <b>eating</b> <b>is</b> to acquire nutrients (which ultimately aids survival and reproduction), but the immediate cause of <b>eating</b> <b>is</b> hunger (causation). Hunger and eating are evolutionarily ancient and are found in many species (evolutionary history), and develop early within an organism's lifespan (development). It is easy to confuse such questions—for example, to argue that people eat because they're hungry and not to acquire nutrients—without realizing that the reason people experience hunger is because it causes them to acquire nutrients.|$|E
25|$|Research {{in applied}} {{psychology}} has investigated practices of meat eating {{in relation to}} morality, emotions, cognition, and personality characteristics. Psychological research suggests meat <b>eating</b> <b>is</b> correlated with masculinity, support for social hierarchy, and reduced openness to experience. Research into the consumer psychology of meat is relevant both to meat industry marketing and to advocates of reduced meat consumption.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{the present}} study was to examine the {{relations}} between restrained, emotional, and external eating and total energy intake, and total fat and carbohydrate intake controlling for body mass index and physical activity. The sample consisted of 475 female students. Energy intake was measured over a 1 -month period using the self-report Food Frequency Questionnaire and <b>eating</b> styles <b>were</b> assessed with the Dutch Eating Behaviour Questionnaire. Structural equation modelling was used to analyze the data. The results showed that restrained <b>eating</b> <b>was</b> consistently negatively related to energy intake and fat and carbohydrate intake, whereas external <b>eating</b> <b>was</b> positively related to all dependent variables. Emotional <b>eating</b> <b>was</b> not related to energy intake or fat and carbohydrate intake. Thus, restrained eaters seem to restrict their energy intake, while external <b>eating</b> <b>was</b> found to be associated with higher levels of energy intake, especially of fat intake...|$|R

25|$|On this {{question}} Mahayana and Vajrayana traditions {{vary depending on}} their interpretation of their scriptures. In some Mahayana sutras, meat <b>eating</b> <b>is</b> strongly discouraged and it is stated that the Buddha did not eat meat. In particular, East Asian Sangha members take on the Bodhisattva Precepts originating in the Brahmajala Sutra, which has a vow of vegetarianism {{as part of the}} Triple Platform Ordination, where they receive the three sets of vows: śrāmaṇera/śrāmaṇerī (novitiate), monastic, and then Bodhisattva Precepts, whereas the Tibetan lineages transmit a tradition of Bodhisattva Precepts from Asanga's Yogacarabhumi-sastra, which does not include a vow of vegetarianism. In some areas such as China, Korea and Vietnam the Sangha practices strict vegetarianism, while in other areas such as Japan or Tibet, they do not.|$|E
25|$|The Vedic {{household}} was patriarchal and patrilineal. The {{institution of}} marriage was important and different types of marriages— monogamy, polygyny and polyandry are mentioned in the Rig Veda. Both women sages and female gods were known to Vedic Aryans. However, hymns attributable to female sages are few and female gods were {{not as important as}} male ones. Women could choose their husbands and could remarry if their husbands died or disappeared. While the wife enjoyed a respectable position, she was subordinate to her husband. People consumed milk, milk products, grains, fruits, and vegetables. Meat <b>eating</b> <b>is</b> mentioned, however, cows are labelled aghnya (not to be killed). Clothes of cotton, wool and animal skin were worn. Soma and sura were popular drinks in the Rig Vedic society, of which soma was sanctified by religion. Flute (vana), lute (vina), harp, cymbals, and drums were the musical instruments played and a heptatonic scale was used. Dancing, dramas, chariot racing, and gambling were other popular pastimes.|$|E
25|$|In {{some regions}} of India, fasts of {{religious}} nature are {{an occasion for}} a change in normal diet, and a total absence from cooking or <b>eating</b> <b>is</b> held as elective while a normal diet for a fasting day is a light feast consisting of different foods from usual, amongst which sweet potato is one of the prime sources of sustenance. Sweet potato– shakarkand, शक्करकंद– is eaten otherwise, too, and a popular variety of preparation in most parts is roasted slow over kitchen coals at night and eaten with some dressing—primarily salt, possibly yogurt—while the easier way in the south is simply boiling or pressure cooking before peeling, cubing and seasoning for a vegetable dish as part of the meal. In Indian state of Tamil Nadu, it is known as 'Sakkara valli Kilangu'. It is boiled and consumed as evening snack. In some parts of India, fresh sweet potato is chipped, dried and then ground into flour; this is then mixed with wheat flour and baked into chapattis (bread). Between 15 and 20 percent of sweet potato harvest is converted by some Indian communities into pickles and snack chips. A part of the tuber harvest is used in India as cattle fodder.|$|E

50|$|The Khmer {{language}} {{reflects a}} somewhat different classification of Khmer society based on a more traditional model and characterized by differing linguistic usages (see Languages, this ch.). This classification divided Cambodian society into three broad categories: royalty and nobility, clergy, and laity. The Khmer language had—and {{to a lesser extent}} still has—partially different lexicons for each of these groups. For example, nham (to <b>eat)</b> <b>was</b> used when speaking of oneself or to those on a lower social level; pisa (to <b>eat)</b> <b>was</b> used when speaking politely of someone else; chhan (to <b>eat)</b> <b>was</b> used of Buddhist clergy, and saoy (to <b>eat)</b> <b>was</b> used of royalty. The Khmer Rouge attempted {{to do away with the}} different lexicons and to establish a single one for all; for example, they tried to substitute a single, rural word, hop (to eat), for all of the above words.|$|R

500|$|The {{ritual of}} Tawaf {{involves}} walking seven times counterclockwise around the Kaaba. Upon arriving at Al-Masjid Al-Ḥarām ( [...] , The Sacred Mosque), pilgrims perform an arrival tawaf either {{as part of}} Umrah or as a welcome tawaf. During tawaf, pilgrims also include Hateem – an area at {{the north side of}} the Kaaba – inside their path. Each circuit starts with the kissing or touching of the Black Stone (Hajar al- Aswad). If kissing the stone is not possible because of the crowds, they may simply point towards the stone with their hand on each circuit. <b>Eating</b> <b>is</b> not permitted but the drinking of water is allowed, because of the risk of dehydration. Men are encouraged to perform the first three circuits at a hurried pace, known as Ramal, and the following four at a more leisurely pace.|$|E
500|$|The Reformed confessions {{teach that}} Christ's true {{body and blood}} are really present in the Lord's Supper. Regarding what is {{received}} in the Supper, the Reformed tradition does not disagree with the position of Catholicism or Lutheranism. Reformed confessions teach that partakers of the Supper, {{in the words of}} the Belgic Confession, partake of [...] "the proper and natural body and the proper blood of Christ". However, they deny the explanations for this eating and drinking made by Lutherans and Catholics. Against Catholics, Reformed confessions teach that the bread and wine of the Supper do not become the blood and body of Christ, as in the Catholic view of transubstantiation. Against Lutherans, Reformed confessions do not teach that partakers of the Supper physically eat Christ's body and drink his blood with their mouths (...) [...] While Reformed confessions teach that in the Supper Christ is received in both his divine and human natures, the manner of <b>eating</b> <b>is</b> believed to be spiritual (...) [...] The body and blood of Christ remain fleshly substance, but they are communicated to the partaker in a spiritual manner.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—This paper {{contributes}} {{to the field of}} Environmental Awareness Training (EAT) evaluation in terms of military activities. Environmental management of military activities is a growing concern for defence forces worldwide and the importance of <b>EAT</b> <b>is</b> becoming widely recognized. As one of Australia’s largest landowners, the Australian Defence Force (ADF) is extremely mindful of its duty as a joint environmental manager. It has an integrated Environmental Management System (EMS) to assist environmental management and <b>EAT</b> <b>is</b> {{an essential part of the}} ADF EMS model. This paper examines how <b>EAT</b> <b>was</b> conducted during the exercise Talisman Saber in 2009 (TS 09) and evaluates its effectiveness, using Shoalwater Bay Training Area (SWBTA), one of the most significant military training areas and a significant protected area in Australia, as a case study. A questionnaire survey conducted showed, overall, that <b>EAT</b> <b>was</b> effective from the perspective of a sample of participants. Recommendations are made for the ADF to refine EAT for future exercises. Keywords—Australian Defence Force, effectiveness evaluation...|$|R

2500|$|The rice or {{the soup}} is eaten {{by picking up}} the bowl with the left hand and using chopsticks (hashi) with the right, or vice versa if one is left-handed.

Bowls may be lifted to the mouth, but should not be touched by the mouth except when drinking soup. The Japanese customarily slurp noodle soup dishes like ramen, udon, and soba. When slurping noodles quickly, the soup clings to the noodles, making the dish more flavourful.|$|E
