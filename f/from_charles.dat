5|$|In 1924 {{the family}} moved to Mount Vernon, New York, a popular Jewish area of Westchester County. Nevelson was upset with the move, which removed her from city life and her artistic environment. During the winter of 1932–1933 she {{separated}} <b>from</b> <b>Charles,</b> unwilling to becoming the socialite wife he expected her to be. She never sought financial support <b>from</b> <b>Charles,</b> and in 1941 the couple divorced.|$|E

The present Dukes of Buccleuch, Richmond, Grafton and St Albans descend <b>from</b> <b>Charles</b> in unbroken male line. Diana, Princess of Wales, was descended from two of Charles's illegitimate sons: the Dukes of Grafton and Richmond. Diana's son, Prince William, Duke of Cambridge, second in line to the British throne, {{is likely to be}} the first British monarch descended <b>from</b> <b>Charles</b> II.|$|E

5|$|In the English Civil War, Thomas Bushell held Lundy for King Charles I, {{rebuilding}} Marisco Castle and garrisoning {{the island}} {{at his own}} expense. He {{was a friend of}} Francis Bacon, a strong supporter of the Royalist cause and an expert on mining and coining. It was the last Royalist territory held {{between the first and second}} civil wars. After receiving permission <b>from</b> <b>Charles</b> I, Bushell surrendered the island on 24 February 1647 to Richard Fiennes, representing General Fairfax. In 1656, the island was acquired by Lord Saye and Sele.|$|E
5|$|On 15 May 2011, West Ham's relegation to the Championship was {{confirmed}} after a comeback from Wigan at the DW Stadium. With West Ham leading 0–2 at half-time through two Demba Ba goals, Wigan battled back to win 3–2 {{thanks to an}} added-time strike <b>from</b> <b>Charles</b> N'Zogbia. Following the loss, West Ham announced the sacking of manager Avram Grant just one season into his tenure. On 1 June 2011, Sam Allardyce was appointed as manager as Grant's replacement.|$|E
5|$|On 21 September 1668, the Royal Charter of 27 March 1668 {{led to the}} {{transfer}} of Bombay <b>from</b> <b>Charles</b> II to the British East India Company for an annual rent of £10 (equivalent retail price index of £1,226 in 2007). The islands were {{handed over to the}} Company on 23 September 1668. Upon {{the transfer}}, Bombay was made subordinate to the Company's settlement in Surat. During 1668–87, the Governors of Bombay, who were also presidents of Surat Council, spent most of their time in Surat. During this time, Bombay was administered by a Deputy Governor.|$|E

5|$|On 22 October, Gosiewski was {{defeated}} by Swedish forces in the Battle of Filipów and turned to Lithuania. Also on 22 October, besieged Dorpat surrendered to Alexis, while the Russian siege of Swedish-held Riga was lifted. John II Casimir meanwhile took Bromberg (Bydgoszcz) and Konitz in Royal Prussia, and from 15 November 1656 until February 1657 stayed in Danzig, where a Swedish siege had to be lifted due to Dutch intervention, just 55 kilometers away <b>from</b> <b>Charles</b> X Gustav's quarters in Elbing.|$|E
5|$|The crash is {{the deadliest}} air {{disaster}} in France since the 1981 crash of Inex-Adria Aviopromet Flight 1308 in which 180 people died, and the third-deadliest in France behind Flight 1308 and Turkish Airlines Flight 981. This {{was the first}} major crash of a civil airliner in France since the crash of Air France Flight 4590 on takeoff <b>from</b> <b>Charles</b> de Gaulle Airport in 2000. It was also the third highest death toll of any accident involving an Airbus A320 after Indonesia AirAsia Flight 8501 and TAM Airlines Flight 3054.|$|E
5|$|Wong got an {{approval}} <b>from</b> <b>Charles</b> Brooke to {{look for}} a new settlement in the Rajang basin. In April 1900, Wong travelled 13 days up the Rajang River before he decided to choose Sibu as the new settlement for his Foochow clansmen, because the area near Rajang delta would be suitable for growing crops. An agreement was signed on 9 July 1900 between Wong Nai Siong and the Brooke government in Kuching to allow Chinese settlers into the area.|$|E

5|$|Abby {{is in love}} again, {{but then}} finds out that Charles is the front {{for a group of}} thugs wanting to build a marina at Lotus Point for drug trafficking. Abby pretends {{to go along with the}} {{marriage}} and accepts a two million dollar wedding gift <b>from</b> <b>Charles.</b> After the ceremony she has the marriage annulled, but keeps the money. After this, Abby marries Greg Sumner. It isn't love, but rather a political marriage. Abby forms another company, Morikame, in order to buy Lotus Point. When her former partners find out and threaten to have her arrested for fraud, she donates Lotus Point to the government as a wildlife preserve. Abby goes after a political appointment that Greg wants, and leaves Knots Landing to be a trade representative in Japan. Abby later forms another illegal company with Nigel Treadwell, and tries to take over the Sumner Group, but her plan fails. She moves back into her old house on the cul-de-sac.|$|E
5|$|After {{the death}} of Cromwell in 1658, Monck {{remained}} aloof from the political manoeuvring in London {{that led to the}} brief establishment of a regime under the protector's son Richard Cromwell and after its fall the subsequent contest for power between the army leaders. When this proved incapable of producing a stable government in 1659 Monk opened negotiations with Charles II and began a slow march south with his army. After reaching London he restored the English Long Parliament that had existed {{at the beginning of the}} civil wars. This body, having received some assurances <b>from</b> <b>Charles</b> II, voted for a restoration of the monarchy in England and then dissolved itself. This created a de facto restoration of the monarchy in Scotland, but without any safeguards as to the constitutional position in the country. Scottish notables were in a weak position in negotiations with the crown as to what the settlement would be.|$|E
5|$|Although {{it gained}} recruits, the rising began {{to suffer from}} {{internal}} divisions, particularly between the Highlanders who made {{up the bulk of}} the forces and the Lowland nobles and officers who were their commanders. In early 1654, nine months into the revolt, Middleton, a Lowland officer and a veteran of the Battle of Worcester, arrived with a commission to command <b>from</b> <b>Charles</b> II. Despite objections from his followers, Glencairn surrendered control over his forces, which had now reached 3,500 foot and 1,500 horse. That evening Sir George Munro, Middleton's aide insulted Glencairn's forces and the result was a duel in which Munro was wounded. Glencairn was arrested. He would eventually be released and retire from the conflict. A series of other disputes and duels undermined the leadership of the campaign {{for the remainder of the}} rising.|$|E

5|$|Before their {{collaboration}} on the Diary, {{the brothers}} each pursued successful careers on the stage. George originated {{nine of the}} principal comedian roles in the Gilbert and Sullivan operas over 12 years from 1877 to 1889. He also established a national reputation as a piano sketch entertainer and wrote {{a large number of}} songs and comic pieces. Before embarking on his stage career, Weedon had worked as an artist and illustrator. The Diary was the brothers' only mature collaboration. Most of its humour derives <b>from</b> <b>Charles</b> Pooter's unconscious and unwarranted sense of his own importance, and the frequency with which this delusion is punctured by gaffes and minor social humiliations. In an era of rising expectations within the lower-middle classes, the daily routines and modest ambitions described in the Diary were instantly recognised by its contemporary readers, and provided later generations with a glimpse of the past that it became fashionable to imitate.|$|E
5|$|Conversely, Anthony Camp {{challenges}} {{the belief that}} Sophia had a child and provides a detailed summary of the available evidence. In his book Royal Babylon: the Alarming History of European Royalty, author Karl Shaw writes {{of the possibility that}} the Duke raped his sister, citing evidence <b>from</b> <b>Charles</b> Greville's diaries, as well as other factors. Historian Gillian Gill believes that Sophia secretly gave birth to the child and that this is the reason Sophia never married. Alison Weir and others, however, write of a possible marriage between Sophia and Garth the same year as the child's birth, but {{there is no evidence to}} back this assertion other than the presence of a wedding ring in a portrait of an aged Sophia.|$|E
5|$|In 1932, Starkey secured funding <b>from</b> <b>Charles</b> Marston and Henry Wellcome {{to start}} an {{expedition}} apart from the Petries, which Olga joined. The Wellcome-Marston expedition was {{to focus on the}} excavation of the ancient city of Lachish, a stronghold mentioned in the Bible. Over the next six years, the team made some important finds, including the Lachish letters, but the work was interrupted by the murder of Starkey, while he was en route to the opening of the Rockefeller Museum in Jerusalem. The remaining team finished during the 1938/9 season, then closed the site. Olga wrote the final report.|$|E

5|$|In the north, the Royal Prussian nobles {{concluded}} a defensive {{alliance with the}} Electorate of Brandenburg on 12 November in the Treaty of Rinsk, permitting Brandenburgian garrisons. Danzig (Gdansk), Thorn (Torun) and Elbing (Elblag) had not participated in the treaty, with Thorn and Elbing surrendering to Sweden. In the Treaty of Königsberg on 17 January 1656, Frederick William, Elector of Brandenburg and Duke of Prussia, took the Duchy of Prussia, formerly a Polish fief, as a fief <b>from</b> <b>Charles</b> X Gustav. The Brandenburgian garrisons in Royal Prussia were withdrawn, and when Marienburg (Malbork) surrendered in March, Danzig remained the only town not under Swedish control.|$|E
5|$|John Tyler {{was born}} on March 29, 1790, and like his future running mate William Henry Harrison, he hailed <b>from</b> <b>Charles</b> City County, Virginia and was descended from aristocratic and {{politically}} entrenched families. The Tyler family traced its lineage to colonial Williamsburg in the 17th century. John Tyler Sr., commonly known as Judge Tyler, was a friend and college roommate of Thomas Jefferson and served in the Virginia House of Delegates alongside Benjamin Harrison V, father of William. The elder Tyler served four years as Speaker of the House of Delegates before becoming a state court judge. He subsequently served as governor and as a judge on the U.S. District Court at Richmond. His wife, Mary Marot (Armistead), {{was the daughter of}} a prominent plantation owner, Robert Booth Armistead. She died of a stroke when her son John was seven years old.|$|E
5|$|Lacking artistic {{stimulation}} in Morgantown, Lazzell {{journeyed to}} Provincetown, Massachusetts, in 1915. Already an artists' colony, Provincetown was {{a mecca for}} European artists escaping World War I. Stella Johnson and Jessie Fremont Herring, two of Lazzell's companions from her tour in Italy, were already in Provincetown and Lazzell stayed with Johnson's mother. Lazzell took a morning outdoor painting class that summer <b>from</b> <b>Charles</b> Webster Hawthorne at his Cape Cod School of Art where she was exposed to Fauvist color and technique.
