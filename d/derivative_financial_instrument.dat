40|$|Until {{reporting}} periods ending on or after 31 December 1997, disclosure of financial instruments was unregulated in Australia. This thesis examines moti. v ati. n g factors for Australian firms' voluntary derivative instrument disclosures during the unregulated reporting regime spanning 1992 - 1997. It proposes that managers' disclosure strategies are {{a consequence of}} explicit and implicit contractual arrangements aimed at protecting and enhancing individuals'and firms' financial reporting reputations and maximising firm value. Aims Financial statement preparers' preferences can be revealed through voluntary reporting practices andlor lobbying activity. By investigating firms' voluntary disclosure practices in response to proposed accounting regulation and professional requirements, this study contributes to understanding costlbenefit tradeoffs with respect to information disclosures. Specifically, the thesis examines two dimensions of voluntary derivative instrument disclosures. The first dimension focuses on predicting {{the degree to which}} Australian firms comply with the disclosure requirements contained in an exposure draA (ED 65) and an Industry Statement issued by Australian accounting standard setting bodies and the Australian Society of Corporate Treasurers (ASCT) respectively. The thesis examines disclosures longitudinally, transcending' {{reporting periods}} where the disclosures are purely voluntary to periods where coercive pressure is exerted on firms for transparency in relation to their derivative instrument activities. It tests whether changes in derivative disclosures across the different reporting regimes are significantly associated with changes in disclosure pronouncements. The thesis then tests for systematic differences in the characteristics of high and low disclosure firms. The tests use variables grounded in costly contracting theory as well as variables developed using a legitimacy framework. This extends the extant literature by: (a) simultaneouslayp piying these alternate frameworks; and (b) applying legitimacy theory to a financial reporting issue, as distinct from a social or environmental issue. Specifically, the research questions addressed in this study are: (1) Why, and to what degree, do Australian entities voluntarily comply with the <b>derivative</b> <b>financial</b> <b>instrument</b> disclosure requirements contained in ED 65 and the ASCT Industry Statement? (2) Are there any systematic differences in the characteristics of entities with high disclosure compliance versus low disclosure compliance in relation to derivative financial instruments? Scope The thesis studies the voluntary disclosure responses of Australian financial statement preparers to <b>derivative</b> <b>financial</b> <b>instrument</b> disclosure requirements proposed by ED 65 and the ASCT Industry Statement. Given that regulation governing derivative instrument disclosures did not become effective until reporting dates on or after 31 December 1997, this thesis studies voluntary disclosures in firms' 1992 - 1997 annual reports. Using a self-constructed disclosure index, firms are assigned an integer score determined by the presencelabsence in their annual report of a range of <b>derivative</b> <b>financial</b> <b>instrument</b> information. The information score relates to policy, risk, and net market value disclosures. Conclusions A change in the number and quality of derivative financial disclosures during 1992 - 1997 reporting periods is evident. Early 1990 s <b>derivative</b> <b>financial</b> <b>instrument</b> disclosures {{are more likely to be}} by large firms or firms in the extractive industry. The disclosures increase significantly in 1995, coinciding with the period when the ASCT Industry Statement and exposure draft are issued. This suggests that managers reassess <b>derivative</b> <b>financial</b> <b>instrument</b> disclosure strategies in line with the increased probability of mandated disclosure requirements and the pressure on financial statement preparers to he professionally responsible. Firms subject to public scrutiny and firms with professional affiliations with the body issuing the industry statement and the Group of 100 companies are particularly responsive to the demand for derivative instrument activity transparency. Apart from firm leverage, variables grounded in costly contracting theory are generally not significant predictors of <b>derivative</b> <b>financial</b> <b>instrument</b> disclosures. This study is significant in that the results highlight the potential for professional organisations, other than the accounting profession, to influence the content of financial information contained in annual reports. This is an important consideration for accounting regulators. It indicates the need of regulators to respond in a timely manner to financial accounting issues in order to maintain their credibility and legitimacy. Whilst other interpretations may be possible, the findings also highlight the importance managers attach to firms' <b>derivative</b> <b>financial</b> <b>instrument</b> disclosures as a means of personal and corporate reputation and legitimacy maintenance and enhancement. Furthermore, the study introduces firm attributes that are new to financial accounting disclosure choice studies and in doing so demonstrates the benefits of simultaneously applying alternative paradigms to voluntary reporting issues...|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{investigate}} managers' responses to <b>derivative</b> <b>financial</b> <b>instrument</b> disclosure requirements proposed by the Australian accounting standard setting bodies and the Australian Society of Corporate Treasurers (ASCT). Confronted with societal pressures to make derivative activities more transparent, managers responded in a manner that can be explained by legitimacy and institutional theories and the maintenance of the managers' and their firms' financial reporting reputations. Discretionary reporting is predicted to be positively related to the magnitude of reputation costs confronting managers and firms. While the desire for legitimacy is unobservable, financial reporting reputation is proxied by the following attributes-ASCT, auditor, and Group of 100 (G 100) affiliations. With the exception of auditor affiliation, results from the analysis are consistent with the hypotheses. Alternative explanations of the results may be possible. However, the consistency and significance of the results implies that legitimacy and institutional theories provide a plausible explanation as to what impulse prompted managers' responses. (The plausible explanations provided are morally based [Louch (1966). Explanation and human action. Berkeley: University of California Press].) We are grateful to an anonymous referee for this insight into our explanation). Further research to investigate managers' reporting incentives is recommended...|$|E
40|$|Long-term {{sale and}} {{purchase}} contracts of electrical energy are usually contracts for the purchase, {{in whole or}} in part, of the output from the plants specified in the supply contract for a consideration adjusted to the effective production cost or to the right of use of a given plant against payment of prearranged amounts, independently of the fair value of the units of product purchased. The lack of specific provisions in the Ias/Ifrs Standards on accounting electrical energy supply contracts in the balance-sheet, together with peculiar features of the electricity (e. g. the impossibility to physically store the "good" to be sold) and the considerable complex legal structure of such sale and purchase agreements, leave a degree of uncertainty in determining the most appropriate modalities to account the supply transactions at stake in order to ensure their “faithful representation” in the balance-sheets of the counterparts. Therefore, the aim {{of this paper is to}} provide a contribution to the topic of accounting long-term electrical energy sale and purchase contracts in Ias/Ifrs balance-sheets according to the aforementioned principle of faithful representation, thus eventually lifting the “veil” of the legal form of the contract in favour of the economic substance of the transaction. To this end it shall have to be ascertained – based on the typical features of this kind of contracts – whether a specific amount of electrical energy is bought/sold for an industrial use exclusively, so that such transactions will be accounted as a normal purchase/sale, or is implementing financial trading strategies, as in such hypothesis the contract is to be accounted as a <b>derivative</b> <b>financial</b> <b>instrument</b> according to Ifrs 9 “Financial Instruments”/Ias 39 “Financial Instruments: recognition and measurement”, i. e. at its fair value and specifying gains and losses for the period in the income statement...|$|E
40|$|I propose {{creation}} of a venture bank, able to multiply the capital of a venture capital firm by up to 47 times, without requiring access to the Federal Reserve or other central bank apart from settlement. This concept rests on insuring loans to expand Tier 1 and 2 capital. Profitability depends on overall portfolio performance, availability of default insurance notes, cost of default insurance, and the multiple of original capital (MOC) adopted by the venture bank. If the form that uses interbank funds is used, then it also depends on the interbank funds rates. I propose a new <b>derivative</b> <b>financial</b> <b>instrument,</b> the Default Insurance Note (DIN), to insure loans to venture investments. A DIN {{is similar to a}} credit default swap (CDS) but with a host of unique features. The features and operation of these new derivative instruments are outlined along with audit requirements. This instrument would be traded on open-outcry exchanges with special rules to ensure orderly operation of the market. It is the {{creation of}} public markets for DINs that makes possible the use of public market pricing to indirectly establish a market capitalization for the underlying venture-bank investment, which is the key to achieving regulatory acceptance of the fully-insured version of this proposal. That fully-insured version insulates the venture-bank from losses in most situations, and multiplies profitability quite dramatically in all scenarios. Ten year returns above 10 are attainable. I show that both where the DIN is a minor fraction of investment, and where the DIN insures 100 % of invested funds for the duration, in the normal range of returns the DIN underwriting business is profitable.
