5|$|Michael Scott (Steve Carell) {{comes in}} to work {{prepared}} to pit the office staff against the warehouse {{in a game of}} basketball, with the losers <b>having</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> on Saturday. Michael picks Jim Halpert (John Krasinski), Ryan Howard (B. J. Novak), and Stanley Hudson (Leslie David Baker), the last of whom he believes possesses significant basketball skills based on a racial stereotype. In addition, he also reluctantly picks Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson) and Phyllis Lapin (Phyllis Smith), but refuses to pick Oscar Martinez (Oscar Nunez) or Kevin Malone (Brian Baumgartner).|$|E
5|$|Originally, {{the game}} was {{supposed}} to be developed for the PlayStation 3, but due to the long wait for the PS3, {{the game was}} developed for the PlayStation 2 instead. From the outset, the games director Hideo Kojima wished to drastically change the setting from previous games. He stated that the jungle setting is what both his development team, and the Metal Gear fans, wanted. However, he acknowledged that the elements of a jungle environment, such as the weather, landscape and wildlife, were features that would present problems during the game's development. Whereas in previous installments the player starts out close to, or even within, the enemy base, Kojima wished Snake Eater to be more realistic, with Snake starting out miles from civilization and <b>having</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> his way to the enemy encampment.|$|E
5|$|The mission did {{fail and}} the {{internal}} settlement talks were resurrected, resulting in a deal on 4 March 1978. A transitional joint Council of Ministers was set up, with Van der Byl <b>having</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> with Dr Elliott Gabellah as his co-Minister of Foreign Affairs. The Patriotic Front took no notice of this accord and the guerrilla war continued; Lord Richard Cecil, a close family friend working as a photo-journalist, was killed by guerrillas on 20 April 1978 after Van der Byl had ensured he had full access to military areas denied to other reporters.|$|E

5|$|The prisoners {{realised}} that if {{they managed}} to fully counterfeit the dollars, their lives {{would no longer be}} safeguarded by the work they were undertaking, so they slowed their progress as much as they could. The journalist Lawrence Malkin, who wrote a history of Operation Bernhard, writes that prisoners considered this to have the tacit approval of Krüger, who would face front-line duty if Operation Bernhard ended. In August 1944 Salomon Smolianoff, a convicted forger, was added to the production team at Sachsenhausen to aid the counterfeiting of US dollars, although he also assisted in quality control for the pound notes. The Jewish prisoners working on the operation at the time complained to Krüger at <b>having</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> with a criminal, so he was given his own room to sleep in.|$|E
5|$|Most {{shooting}} {{was done at}} the Arthur Ranch in the San Francisco Valley, which was used as Aunt Elizabeth's estate for interior and exterior scenes. Beginning at the Arthur Ranch shoot, Grant and Hepburn often ad-libbed their dialogue and frequently delayed production by making each other laugh. The scene where Grant frantically asks Hepburn where his bone is was shot from 10 am until well after 4 pm because of the stars' laughing fits. After one month of shooting Hawks was seven days behind schedule. During the filming, Hawks would refer to four {{different versions of the}} film's script and make frequent changes to scenes and dialogue. His leisurely attitude on set and shutting down production to see a horse race contributed to the time it took to film, and he took twelve days to shoot the Westlake jail scene instead of the scheduled five. Hawks later facetiously blamed the setbacks on his two stars' laughing fits and <b>having</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> with two animal actors.|$|E
5|$|The mall {{also added}} new burdens to city services, with {{building}} inspectors <b>having</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> overtime to inspect each store area {{as it was}} completed. While mall security was issued citation books so they could issue parking tickets directly, the city police still had to work double shifts to cover the traffic during the mall's opening weekend. Overall, the mall increased traffic on the Earl Rudder Freeway, and city traffic engineers noted it would cause more traffic backup. Traffic signals {{were added to the}} mall's main entrance, while long-term plans were made to both expand the freeway and add additional interchanges along Harvey. Traffic studies were implemented to study the traffic after the mall's opening to developed additional plans to mitigate issues. There were concerns that the mall would be the final blow to the downtown area of neighboring city Bryan, Texas, which was already suffering reduced business after the opening of smaller Manor East Mall and the Townshire shopping center, both within Bryan. Bryan city officials noted an immediate decrease in revenue due to Sears moving from Bryan to College Station, taking $50–100,000 of sales taxes with it. However, as a whole the city was hopeful that the mall would have benefits to the city in the form of increased city growth as a whole. The city planners felt it would only be a passing fad for local rural and lower-income families, who would still return to downtown Bryan due to its proximity.|$|E

25|$|In 1967, Alvis {{was awarded}} the {{contract}} to produce 30 CVR(T) prototypes.

In May 1970, the CVR(T) was accepted into British Army service; a contract was agreed for 275 Scorpions and 288 Scimitars. The first production Scorpion being completed in 1971, initial delivery to the British Army was in January 1972.|$|E
25|$|Oil {{paintings}} initially {{became a}} popular method for producing altarpieces and soon replaced tempera for this purpose. The {{ease with which}} large paintings could be created meant {{that not only did}} very large altar paintings proliferate, taking the place of polyptychs made of small panels, but because they were of relatively light weight, such pictures could be used on ceilings, by setting them into wooden frames and without the trouble of the artist <b>having</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> laboriously on a scaffold. Famous Venetian painters, Titian, Tintoretto and Veronese produced many such pictures. Peter Paul Rubens painted a Passion of Christ in a number of large canvases.|$|E

25|$|Upon {{arriving}} in Paris, Brodovitch {{wanted to be}} a painter. A Russian white émigré in Paris, Brodovitch found himself poor and <b>having</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> {{for the first time in}} his life. He took a job painting houses, while his wife Nina worked as a seamstress. They lived in a cheap, small apartment in the area of Montparnasse, among other Russian artists who had settled in Paris at the end of the 19th century. This group of artists, including Archipenko, Chagall, and Nathan Altman, would meet at the inexpensive Académie Vassilieff, which offered painting and sculpting classes without an instructor. His connections with these young Russian artists led to more artistic work as a painter of backdrops for Diaghilev's Ballets Russes.|$|E
25|$|In March 2012, it was {{reported}} that the project had been affected by the delay in the delivery of the main gearboxes for the carrier. The supplier, Elecon, attributed it to <b>having</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> around a number of technical complexities due to the length of the propulsion shafts. Other issues resulting in delays included an accident with a diesel generator and an issue with its alignment. In August 2011, the Defence Ministry reported to the Lok Sabha that 75% of the construction work for the hull of the lead carrier had been completed and the carrier would be first launched in December 2011, following which further works would be completed until commissioning. On 29 December 2011, the completed hull of the carrier was first floated out of its dry dock at CSL, with its displacement at over 14,000 tonnes. Interior works and fittings on the hull would be carried out until the second half of 2012, when it would again be dry-docked for integration with its propulsion and power generation systems.|$|E
25|$|Many of the arrivals {{were noted}} Torah {{scholars}} whose communities felt {{honored to be}} represented in Eretz Yisrael and sent them ma'amodos (stipends) on a regular basis. The kollel network that was established many years prior in Jewish communities around the globe, to financially and charitably take care of one another while under the civic authority and care of the foreign governments {{of the countries in}} which Jews lived, also facilitated the use of halukkah charity and allowed religious Jews to study Torah without <b>having</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> for a living. Money for this purpose was raised in Jewish communities around the world for distribution among the various kollelim that were correspondingly established (by country or community of origin) in the Old Yishuv, especially in Jerusalem. From the thirteenth through the turn-of-the 20th century, Jewish communities living in the Old Yishuv dispatched travelling emissaries (shlihim or Meshullahim) to raise money in the diaspora for sustenance. The funds they raised were known as Halukah and were collected around the world by these envoys of the religious community, who subsequently assisted in the transference of Diaspora funds to Eretz Yisrael under the larger umbrella of welfare and financial aid.|$|E

While author Bruce Spizer has suggested that Lennon was keen to [...] "spare" [...] the band from <b>having</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> on Harrison's songs, Sulpy and Schweighardt consider that Lennon's enthusiasm was because such a solo project would allow him and Ono to continue their own recording activities [...] "without causing friction within The Beatles".|$|E
