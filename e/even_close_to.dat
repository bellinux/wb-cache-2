25|$|In 1968 {{a meeting}} of fusion {{researchers}} took place in Novosibirsk, where, to everyone's astonishment, the Soviet hosts introduced their work on their tokamak designs which had performance numbers that no other experiment was <b>even</b> <b>close</b> <b>to</b> matching. The latest of their designs, the T-3, was producing electron energies of 1000eV, compared to about 10eV in ZETA. This corresponded to a plasma temperature of about 10 million K. Although the Soviet team was highly respected, the results were so good that there was serious concern their indirect temperature measurements might be unreliable and they had fallen prey to a measurement problem {{like the one that}} had occurred with ZETA. Spitzer, once again, expressed his scepticism rather strongly, sparking off an acrimonious debate with Artsimovitch.|$|E

He had known the members of Blink-182 for over two decades, as the group had previously performed shows with Goldfinger.

Barthel assigned a three-digit numeric code to each glyph or to each group of similar-looking glyphs that he believed to be allographs (variants). In the case of allography, the bare numeric code was assigned to what Barthel {{believed to be the}} basic form (Grundtypus), while variants were specified by alphabetic suffixes. Altogether he assigned 600 numeric codes. The hundreds place is a digit from 0 to 7, and categorizes the head, or overall form if there is no head: 0 and 1 for geometric shapes and inanimate objects; 2 for figures with [...] "ears"; 3 and 4 for figures with open mouths (they are differentiated by their legs/tails); 5 for figures with miscellaneous heads; 6 for figures with beaks; and 7 for fish, arthropods, etc. The digits in tens and units places were allocated similarly, so that, for example, glyphs 206, 306, 406, 506, and 606 all have a downward-pointing wing or arm on the left, and a raised four-fingered hand on the right: ...|$|E
500|$|Although Barry Lyndon found a great {{audience}} in France, {{it was a}} box office failure, grossing just $9.5 million in the American market, not <b>even</b> <b>close</b> <b>to</b> the $30 million Warner Bros. needed to generate a profit. The pace and length of Barry Lyndon at three hours put off many American critics and audiences, but the film was nominated for seven Academy Awards and won four, including Best Art Direction, Best Cinematography, Best Costume Design, and Best Musical Score, {{more than any other}} Kubrick film. As with most of Kubrick's films, Barry Lyndons reputation has grown through the years and it is now considered to be one of his best, particularly among filmmakers and critics. Numerous polls, such as The Village Voice (1999), Sight & Sound (2002), and Time (2005), have rated it {{as one of the greatest}} films ever made. As of August 2015, it has as 96% rating on Rotten Tomatoes, based on 52 reviews. Roger Ebert referred to it as [...] "one of the most beautiful films ever made", [...] "certainly in every frame a Kubrick film: technically awesome, emotionally distant, remorseless in its doubt of human goodness." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{development}} of a sequel to ARMA commenced afterward. The team decided to reuse some of its assets of Game 2 for ARMA 2, and did not hold unrealistic ambitions for the game. A Xbox 360 version was planned but was later scrapped after the team thought that its power was inferior to that of personal computers. During this period, Codemasters announced , a game falling into competition with Bohemia's own ARMA titles, as it was marketed as the true successor to Cold War Crisis. Španěl was not happy with how Dragon Rising is being marketed as {{a return to the}} Operation Flashpoint series despite being created without the involvement of Bohemia. The team became anxious, but found relief after viewing gameplay footage Dragon Rising, which they considered to be subpar and [...] " [...] not come <b>even</b> <b>close</b> <b>to</b> what they promised". ARMA 2 was released in mid-2009 to high critical praise and high sales. The development team soon began work on an expansion titled , though Codemasters took legal actions to force Bohemia to change its name due to its similarity with Operation Flashpoint. In early 2010s, the company continued to develop expansions for ARMA 2, and released smaller titles such as Take On Helicopters.|$|E

500|$|Ben Williams from New York {{magazine}} {{described the}} song as sounding both throbbing {{as well as}} wistful. Christian John Wikane from PopMatters called the song a propulsive track. Alan Braidwood of the BBC, noted of the track: [...] "full-on dance, dark, disco, fun, big" [...] and compared it to other Madonna songs like [...] "Vogue", [...] "Deeper and Deeper" [...] and [...] "Ray of Light". Tom Bishop from the BBC commented that Madonna has either reinvigorated her career or she is [...] "merely throwing one final dance party for her long-term fans before settling down to record more sedate material". Jason Shawhan from About.com commented that the song has [...] "way too much Abba in it for its own good." [...] He went on to elaborate that [...] "he only reason I can think of {{for this to be}} chosen as the first single was the Motorola ad campaign. It's not a bad song by far, it has pep and a sense of fun, but it's not <b>even</b> <b>close</b> <b>to</b> being one of the best songs on the record". Bill Lamb of About.com said that the ABBA sample sounded completely effortless like much of Madonna's best dance music. He further elaborated that what [...] "'Hung Up' amounts to is a big gushy love note to Madonna's core fans, those club kids who pack the floor every time they hear the pounding beats of a Madonna classic and the dj's who can't get enough of spinning her records. 'Hung Up' will send those fans into ecstasy, and it sounds good on the radio, too". Thomas Inskeep of Stylus Magazine declared that [...] "Hung Up" [...] and the next single [...] "Sorry" [...] might not have the same sleaze as Madonna's older songs like [...] "Physical Attraction" [...] or [...] "Burning Up", but have the same modus operandi of being designed for [...] "sweaty up-all-night dancing". Rob Harvilla from The Village Voice called the song a triumphant jazz exercise.|$|E
500|$|McCann {{notes that}} Grant {{typically}} played [...] "wealthy privileged characters who {{never seemed to}} have any need to work {{in order to maintain}} their glamorous and hedonistic lifestyle. He became a star whose characters were good looking, quick witted, funny and athletic, a star whose characters seemed to win the hearts of women without even trying". Martin Stirling, commenting in the biography Cary Grant: In Name Only, thought that Grant had an acting range which was [...] "greater than any of his contemporaries, but understood why a number of critics underrated him as an actor. He believes that Grant was always at his [...] "physical and verbal best in situations that bordered on farce". Charles Champlin, commenting in Donald Deschner's The Complete Films of Cary Grant (1973) similarly identifies a paradox in Grant's screen persona, in his unusual ability to [...] "mix polish and pratfalls in successive scenes". He remarks that Grant was [...] "refreshingly able to play the near-fool, the fey idiot, without compromising his masculinity or surrendering to camp for its own sake. His ability to play off against his own image as the strong and handsome romantic hero-figure is, as a matter of fact, probably unique among superstars. Nobody else comes <b>even</b> <b>close</b> <b>to</b> mind who could similarly toy with his own dignity without losing it". Wansell further notes that Grant could, [...] "with the arch of an eyebrow or the merest hint of a smile, question his own image", managing to [...] "blend irony and romance in a way that few other stars have ever done, by slyly never appearing to take himself too seriously, and mixing his own unique mixture of naïveté and worldliness". Stanley Donen, a director who had worked with Grant, stated that his real [...] "magic" [...] came from his attention to minute details and always seeming real, which came from [...] "enormous amounts of work" [...] rather than being God-given. Grant remarked of his career: [...] "I guess to a certain extent I did eventually become the characters I was playing. I played at being someone I wanted to be until I became that person, Or he became me". He would later profess that the real Cary Grant was more like his scruffy, unshaven fisherman in Father Goose than the [...] "well-tailored charmer" [...] of Charade.|$|E
