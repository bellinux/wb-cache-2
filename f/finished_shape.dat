5000|$|The six-piece burr, {{also called}} [...] "Puzzle Knot" [...] or [...] "Chinese Cross", {{is the most}} {{well-known}} and presumably {{the oldest of the}} burr puzzles. This is actually a family of puzzles, all sharing the same <b>finished</b> <b>shape</b> and basic shape of the pieces. The earliest US patent for a puzzle of this kind dates back to 1917.|$|E

50|$|Clovis {{points are}} thin, fluted {{projectile}} points created using bifacial percussion flaking (that is, each face is flaked on both edges alternatively with a percussor). To <b>finish</b> <b>shaping</b> and sharpening the points {{they are sometimes}} pressure flaked along the outer edges.|$|R
50|$|With {{this method}} {{the time frame}} is longer than the other methods. A chair design might take 8 to 10 years to reach {{maturity}} Some of Axel Erlandson trees's took as long as 40 years to assume their <b>finished</b> <b>shapes.</b>|$|R
50|$|Electrical {{steel is}} usually {{manufactured}} in cold-rolled strips less than 2 mm thick. These strips are cut to shape to make laminations which are stacked {{together to form}} the laminated cores of transformers, and the stator and rotor of electric motors. Laminations may be cut to their <b>finished</b> <b>shape</b> by a punch and die or, in smaller quantities, may be cut by a laser, or by wire EDM.|$|E
50|$|Drop Forged - a {{piece of}} red-hot iron or steel placed within an {{impression}} and then struck with the matching impression mounted on a heavy top hammer or ram. Typically the work piece is struck through successive impressions to squeeze the material to <b>finished</b> <b>shape.</b> Adjustable wrenches are drop forged. Nice detailing like on a cast iron piece, but not brittle. Makes a good strong tool, heavy gear, or cam shaft.|$|E
5000|$|Thermoforming is a {{manufacturing}} process where a plastic sheet is heated to a pliable forming temperature, formed {{to a specific}} shape in a mold, and trimmed to create a usable product. The sheet, or [...] "film" [...] when referring to thinner gauges and certain material types, is heated in an oven to a high-enough temperature that permits it to be stretched into or onto a mold and cooled to a <b>finished</b> <b>shape.</b> Its simplified version is vacuum forming.|$|E
500|$|The {{processing}} of titanium metal occurs in four major steps: reduction of titanium ore into [...] "sponge", a porous form; melting of sponge, or sponge plus a master alloy {{to form an}} ingot; primary fabrication, where an ingot is converted into general mill products such as billet, bar, plate, sheet, strip, and tube; and secondary fabrication of <b>finished</b> <b>shapes</b> from mill products.|$|R

5000|$|As {{a result}} of the {{outbreak}} of the Peloponnesian War between Athens and Sparta in 431 BC, the Propylaea was never completed. Not only are the eastern wings missing, the wall surfaces were not trimmed to their <b>finished</b> <b>shapes,</b> and so-called lifting bosses remain on many blocks. (Lifting bosses have long been called such but are now recognized to have been for another purpose, though that other purpose is not agreed. See A. Trevor Hodge, [...] "Bosses Reappraised," [...] Omni Pede Stare: Saggi Architettonici e circumvesuviani in memoriuam Jos de Waele, Mols & Moormann, eds.) ...|$|R
50|$|Most shapers today design {{surfboards}} using {{computer programs}} to generate data {{that can be}} supplied to a computer cutting facility which will mill the raw foam blank within 90% of the <b>finished</b> <b>shape,</b> leaving the shaper to fine-tune the blank to its final state before glassing. This method allows the shaper {{to have a very}} exacting and reproducible design which can be easily fine-tuned and adjusted. Wooden surfboards are making a comeback as an eco-friendly alternative, requiring ultra-light boatbuilding skills.|$|E
50|$|A spoke {{is one of}} some {{number of}} rods {{radiating}} {{from the center of}} a wheel (the hub where the axle connects), connecting the hub with the round traction surface. The term originally referred to portions of a log which had been split lengthwise into four or six sections. The radial members of a wagon wheel were made by carving a spoke (from a log) into their <b>finished</b> <b>shape.</b> A spokeshave is a tool originally developed for this purpose. Eventually, the term spoke was more commonly applied to the finished product of the wheelwright's work, than to the materials used.|$|E
5000|$|The term [...] "burr" [...] {{is first}} {{mentioned}} in a 1928 book by Edwin Wyatt, but the text implies {{that it was}} commonly used before. The term is attributed to the <b>finished</b> <b>shape</b> {{of many of these}} puzzles, resembling a seed burr.The origin of burr puzzles is unknown. The first known record appears in a 1698 engraving used as a title page of Chambers's Cyclopaedia. Later records can be found in German catalogs from the late 18th century and early 19th century. There are claims of the burr being a Chinese invention, like other classic puzzles such as the Tangram. In India these wooden problems are called edaakoodam.|$|E
50|$|In the Cenozoic (66 to 1.8 mya), the {{processes}} that raised the Peñalara massif and divided it into the blocks we find today began to work again. Erosion of the rocky massif filled the basins with sediment. Glacial action in the Quaternary (1.8 mya to present) <b>finished</b> <b>shaping</b> the Peñalara cirque and {{the walls of the}} mountainous axis. The cirques were covered by a mantle of ice up to 300 m thick. Later, the confluence of the rivers gave the final touch to the landscape. The dominant rock in the park is granite, which is very hard and erosion-resistant.|$|R
25|$|Routing is a shaping process used {{to produce}} <b>finished</b> edges and <b>shapes.</b> Some {{materials}} that prove difficult to shape with other processes, such as fiber-glass, Kevlar, and graphite, can be <b>shaped</b> and <b>finished</b> neatly via various routing techniques. Apart from <b>finished</b> edges and <b>shaping,</b> cutaways, holes, and contours can also be shaped using routers.|$|R
5000|$|A {{very dark}} grey Limestone was quarried just outside Kilkenny City {{at a place}} known as [...] "The Black Quarry", due to the colour of the final product. Large {{rough-hewn}} blocks were transported on horse-drawn drays to the River Nore a short distance away, then onto small river floats or barges and brought about 3 kilometers down-river to Milmount where it was worked. A weir on the river provided water to drive reciprocating, cross-cut type, saws to cut the larger blocks into the <b>finished</b> <b>shapes</b> required for the market. The saws were actually steel bands, about four meters long. Sand {{was used as an}} abrasive cutting agent.|$|R
5000|$|When {{mechanical}} hammers were developed, {{forge welding}} {{could be accomplished}} by heating the metal, and then placing it between the mechanized hammer and the anvil. Originally powered by waterwheels, modern mechanical-hammers can also be operated by compressed air, electricity, steam, gas engines, and many other ways. Another method is forge welding with a die, whereas the pieces of metal are heated and then forced into a die which both provides the pressure for the weld and keeps the joint at the <b>finished</b> <b>shape.</b> Roll welding is another forge welding process, where the heated metals are overlapped and passed through rollers at high pressures to create the weld.|$|E
50|$|Electric {{discharges}} can convey substantial {{energy to}} the electrodes {{at the ends of}} the discharge. A spark gap is used in internal combustion engines to ignite the fuel/air mixture on every power stroke. Spark gaps are also used to switch heavy currents in a Marx generator and to protect electrical apparatus. In electric discharge machining, multiple tiny electric arcs are used to erode a conductive workpiece to a <b>finished</b> <b>shape.</b> Arc welding is used to assemble heavy steel structures, where the base metal is heated to melting by the heat of the arc. An electric arc furnace sustains arc currents {{of tens of thousands of}} amperes and is used for steelmaking and production of alloys and other products.|$|E
50|$|The punch is {{attached}} to a mechanical or hydraulic press. These machines reciprocate in a cycle 20 to 60 times per minute. A cold slug is placed below the punch and over the die. The punch makes contact with the slug forcing it around the circumference of the punch and into the die. The metal slug deforms to fit the punch on the inside and the die on the outside. Lubricants are added to aid the machine for an easier punch-out. It only takes one impact for the <b>finished</b> <b>shape</b> to form from the slug. Once the slug has been contoured to the desired shape, a counter-punch ejector removes the work piece from within the die.|$|E

50|$|Various alloys {{of steel}} {{can be made}} which offer {{a wide range of}} {{physical}} and chemical properties desirable for blades. For example, surgical scalpels are often made of stainless steel so that they remain free of rust and largely chemically inert; tool steels are hard and impact resistant (and often expensive as retaining toughness and hardness requires expensive alloying materials, and, being hard, they are difficult to make into their <b>finished</b> <b>shape)</b> and some are designed to resist changes to their physical properties at high temperatures. Steels can be further heat treated to emphasize their toughness (important for impact blades), or hardness, which is a major factor in how well they will retain an edge in use and in how easy they will be to resharpen (harder metals require more effort to sharpen).|$|E
50|$|Molinukai are Lithuanian ocarinas, made in {{the shape}} of a tube or a toy figure. The tube-shaped {{whistles}} are made of clay mixed with sand. The clay is kneaded and rolled, and rolled around a small stick. The stick is removed, one end of the tube is squeezed shut, while the other end is flattened and the blowing hole is made with a thin splinter. A whistle hole and two to four finger holes are {{made in the}} top. Toy shapes are made in the same way as tubes, but the hollow is carved in a <b>finished</b> <b>shape.</b> The molinukai are carved and then fired in an oven. The sound of a molinukas is soft, and the timbre is delicate. Musical possibilities are determined by the number of finger holes. Melodies are improvised. At times, sutartinės were played with these whistles. The molinukai were toys used by herders and children.|$|E
40|$|The primary {{objective}} of the machining sequence prior to ceramic sintering is to produce a contour similar to the <b>finished</b> <b>shape</b> and a surface rim zone free from damage {{so that it is}} only functional faces which need to be refinished. Although this strategy has been in industrial use in many applications, where green machining constitutes an important step in the production of the majority of ceramic parts, there is, however, considerable development potential with regard to the economic process. The reason for this is mainly that the available results are predominantly based on empirical research within companies. Furthermore, the machining behaviour of ceramic green bodies is greatly dependent on the respective company specific and extremely complex material characteristics...|$|E

40|$|The use of strain-isolated ceramic coated {{material}} {{to produce an}} AGT 1500 combustor scroll-shaped transition duct which requires no air for film cooling is investigated. The scroll receives the exhaust of the can-style combustor liner and turns it into the annular inlet of the high pressure gas producer turbine nozzle. Strain-isolation of plasma sprayed thermal barrier coating is achieved by placing a compliant pad between the structural base metal and the ceramic coating. The compliant pad is brazed to the metal structure. In order to achieve a good braze bond, the strain-isolating compliant pad and base metal must be closely matched in shape and tightly fixtured for joining. The complex geometry of the AGT 1500 scroll makes it impractical to attack pads to the supporting structure in its <b>finished</b> <b>shape.</b> Instead the pads are brazed to flat stock and post-formed into scroll sections. While test samples were successfully post-formed, plasma sprayed, and subjected to cyclic heating, the forming of full scale parts by normal methods resulted in tearing of the Hastelloy-X base metal because of embrittlement by the braze material. Several solutions were explored which finally resulted in the successful forming of full scale scroll parts...|$|E
40|$|Abstract — Spoke {{is one of}} some {{number of}} rods {{radiating}} {{from the center of}} a wheel connecting the hub with the round traction surface. The term originally referred to portions of a log which had been split lengthwise into four or six sections. The radial members of a wagon wheel were made by carving a spoke into their <b>finished</b> <b>shape.</b> Eventually, the term spoke was more commonly applied to the finished product of the wheelwright's work, than to the materials he used. The radial, lateral, and tangential stiffness of spokes motorcycle wheels depends upon the rim’s bending inertia, torsion inertia, the spoke sizes, and the spoke geometry. The spokes of three rear bicycle wheels of different spoke patterns were instrumented with strain gauges in order to investigate the effect of the spoke pattern on the spoke strain and fatigue resistance properties of the wheels. Spoke strains due to radial loads Spoked bicycle wheels are efficient, highly evolved, structural systems. A useful analogy for a bicycle wheel supporting vertical loads is that of a circular beam on a pre stressed elastic foundation, fixed at the center and loaded radially at the circumference. Analytical and numerical studies show that spoke strains due to radial loads and in service conditions are insensitive to the spoke pattern. Small variations in the spoke strains between the wheels in the road tests can be attributed to variations in the loads, but do not significantly affect the fatigue life of the wheels...|$|E
40|$|Includes bibliographical references. The {{so-called}} 'hard-boiled' {{detective story}} {{is probably one}} of the most successful formulaic fictive patterns to be developed this century; and has been translated very effectively into popular film and television drama. Its founding fathers are normally deemed to be Dashiell Hammett, Raymond Chandler and Ross Macdonald. A study of their works should provide a valuable insight into the structure of their patterns and how they are made to work to the public's satisfaction. After all, the one indisputable and verifiable matter in the whole business is that these sort of texts appeal to great numbers of people who read them because they enjoy reading them. Some of the interesting questions thus revolve around the issue of why these fictions are so well liked. However, a study of literary formulas assumes the necessity of demonstrating what those particular formulas are. There are three predominating structures which, to my mind, build this kind of fiction into its <b>finished</b> <b>shape.</b> Firstly, there are the comfort factors which offer the reader a sense of security. Secondly, there is their sense of moral fantasy which allows the reader to escape from the confines of their everyday lives. And thirdly, in the best of these works, there is some element of the new and/or the unconventional, often in the form of social and political criticism encapsulated within the safe formulas of the text. This adds the necessary spice to the life of the construct...|$|E
40|$|We studied {{fluid flow}} at the stem-cement {{interface}} of bonded and debonded, polished and rough model femoral components. In a first series of experiments, fluid flow along {{the interface between}} bone cement and well-fixed model femoral components, differing in surface <b>finish,</b> and in <b>shape,</b> was measured. Fluid migration along the bone-cement interface of rough stems (Ra 3 microm) was greater than that on polished stems (p < 0. 001). This was true of cylindrical and conical tapered stems. On stems with the same surface <b>finish,</b> <b>shape</b> did not influence fluid migration. In a second series of experiments, fluid flow along the stem-cement interface of 5 highly polished and 10 rough-finished (5 of Ra approximately 1. 5 microm and 5 of Ra approximately 3 microm), debonded, tapered circular stems was measured. None of the rough stems could prevent fluid flow along the stem-cement interface. Polished tapered stems sealed the interface and, after 48 hrs of continuous pressure, no fluid flow was observed. This difference {{in the ability to}} seal the stem-cement interface between rough and polished stems was significant (p < 0. 001). The difference in fluid migration along the stem-cement interface of rough and polished stems which we observed offers a plausible explanation of the occurrence of osteolysis distal to the articulation of cemented THR in the presence of cement mantle defects. It may also explain why osteolysis is uncommon with polished double-tapered stems...|$|R
