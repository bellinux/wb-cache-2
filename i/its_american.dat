5|$|Beginning in 1558, {{with the}} {{invention}} of the patio process to extract silver from ore using mercury, mercury became an essential resource in the economy of Spain and <b>its</b> <b>American</b> colonies. Mercury was used to extract silver from the lucrative mines in New Spain and Peru. Initially, the Spanish Crown's mines in Almadén in Southern Spain supplied all the mercury for the colonies. Mercury deposits were discovered in the New World, and more than 100,000 tons of mercury were mined from the region of Huancavelica, Peru, over the course of three centuries following the discovery of deposits there in 1563. The patio process and later pan amalgamation process continued to create great demand for mercury to treat silver ores until the late 19th century.|$|E
5|$|By {{the spring}} of 1794, France was in turmoil {{following}} {{the failure of the}} harvest, which threatened the country with starvation.

To ensure the security of this convoy, the French Navy dispatched most of its Atlantic Fleet to sea during May 1794, operating in a series of large squadrons, independent cruisers and one major fleet under Villaret de Joyeuse. On 5 May, two French ships operating independently, the 36-gun frigate Atalante under Captain Charles Linois and the corvette Levrette, spied a British convoy sailing south-west, three days out from Cork, and closed to investigate.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{conditions}} set out by Tikhon's decree for this temporary autonomy not being met, the American diocese of the Russian church declared self-governance in 1924, against the protests of the patriarchate, {{with which it}} had communication and which was capable of governance had <b>its</b> <b>American</b> branch been willing. The refusal of the American branch {{to submit to the}} patriarchate thus based itself officially on a document whose conditions it had not met.
