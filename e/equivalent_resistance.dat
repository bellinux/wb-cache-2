However, the health conditions of the batteries are crucial for {{the reliability of the}} overall system. In this paper, the <b>equivalent</b> DC <b>resistances</b> of Lithium ion battery cells of various health conditions during charging under different temperatures have been collected and the relationships between <b>equivalent</b> DC <b>resistance,</b> health condition and working temperature have been identified. The <b>equivalent</b> DC <b>resistance</b> can easily be obtained during the charging period of a battery by switching off the charging current periodically for a very short duration of time.

5000|$|Alternatively, {{you can use}} voltage {{division}} to determine node voltages without having to calculate the current directly. By this method, the voltage drop across any resistor is V*Rn/Req where V is the total voltage, Req is the total (<b>equivalent)</b> <b>resistance,</b> and Rn is {{the resistance of the}} resistor in question. The voltage of a node referenced to ground is still the sum of the drops across all the resistors, but it's now easier to consider all these resistors as a single <b>equivalent</b> <b>resistance</b> RT, which is simply the sum of all the resistances between the node and ground, so the node voltage is given by V*RT/Req.|$|E
