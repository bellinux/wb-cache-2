40|$|Dry direct-seeded rice (DSR) {{faces with}} complex weed {{problems}} particularly when farmers missed pre-emergence herbicide applications. Thus, {{an effective and}} strategic weed control in DSR is often required with available options of post-emergence herbicides. In such situations, tank mixtures of herbicides may provide broad spectrum weed control in DSR. Field experiments were conducted in the wet seasons of 2013 and 2014 to study weed control in response to tank mixtures of herbicides currently applied in DSR in South Asia. Results revealed that the tank mixtures of the currently available herbicides (azimsulfuron plus bispyribac or <b>fenoxaprop,</b> bispyribac plus <b>fenoxaprop,</b> and azimsulfuron plus bispyribac plus <b>fenoxaprop</b> all applied as post-emergence) rarely resulted in antagonistic effects. Highest weed control efficiency (~ 98 %) was recorded with the tank mixture of azimsulfuron plus bispyribac plus <b>fenoxaprop</b> during both the years. This treatment also produced highest grain yield (7. 2 tha- 1 in 2013 and 7. 9 tha- 1 in 2014), which {{was similar to the}} grain yield in the plots treated with the tank mix of azimsulfuron plus <b>fenoxaprop,</b> pendimethalin (applied as pre-emergence) followed by (fb) bispyribac, pendimethalin fb <b>fenoxaprop,</b> as well as pendimethalin fb azimsulfuron. Plots treated with the post-emergence application of single herbicide (i. e., azimsulfuron, bispyribac, or <b>fenoxaprop)</b> had lower grain yield (3. 0 - 5. 2 tha- 1 in 2013 to 3. 5 - 6. 1 tha- 1 in 2014) than all the sequential herbicide treatments and tank mixtures (azimsulfuron plus <b>fenoxaprop</b> and azimsulfuron plus bispyribac), owing to a broad spectrum weed control. The study suggested that if farmers missed the pre-emergence application of herbicides (e. g., pendimethalin) due to erratic rains or due to other reasons, good weed control and high yield can still be obtained with tank mix applications of azimsulfuron plus <b>fenoxaprop</b> or azimsulfuron plus bispyribac plus <b>fenoxaprop</b> in DSR...|$|E
40|$|Dry-seeded rice {{has been}} {{introduced}} {{as an alternative to}} puddled hand-transplanted rice in the north Indian states of Punjab and Haryana. In dry-seeded rice, weed flora tends to be more diverse and weeds emerge in several flushes during the crop growth cycle and substantial yield reductions due to weed competition are quite common. The efficacy and compatibility of tank mixtures of different herbicides for the control of diverse weed flora in dry-seeded rice was evaluated in field experiments during the summer seasons of 2012 and 2013. The tank mixture of <b>fenoxaprop</b> with ethoxysulfuron improved the control of Echinochloa crus-galli and Echinochloa colona by 43 - 69 % as compared to <b>fenoxaprop</b> alone while the tank-mix of azimsulfuron with <b>fenoxaprop</b> was antagonistic and reduced the control of Leptochloa chinensis by 86 % as compared to <b>fenoxaprop</b> alone. Addition of azimsulfuron or ethoxysulfuron to bispyribac did not improve the control of grass weeds as compared to bispyribac alone. Weed control with the mixture of bispyribac and <b>fenoxaprop</b> varied over the two years. In 2012, bispyribac and <b>fenoxaprop</b> mixture was antagonistic for the control of Dactyloctenum aegyptium, Acrachne racemose, and L. chinensis but in 2013, there was no apparent antagonism and the addition of bispyribac to <b>fenoxaprop</b> reduced grass weed biomass as compared to <b>fenoxaprop</b> alone. In 2013, there was a strong negative correlation (r = - 0. 95, P < 0. 001) between weed dry matter at 45 days after sowing and rice grain yield. According to the linear regression, rice crop is likely to produce no grain yield when weed dry matter exceeds 400 g m. Over the two seasons, fenoxaprop-ethoxysulfuron tank-mix produced similar grain yields (5. 6 - 6. 2 t ha) to the weed-free check (5. 6 - 7. 1 t ha). At the farmer fields, rice grain yield in the plots treated with pendimethalin followed by post-emergence bispyribac or a tank-mix of <b>fenoxaprop</b> + ethoxysulfuron ranged from 6. 2 to 7. 7 t ha as compared to 5. 3 - 5. 6 t ha in the plots treated with pendimethalin alone. The tank mixture of <b>fenoxaprop</b> with bispyribac needs further evaluation as this mixture has the potential to effectively control aerobic and aquatic grasses in dry-seeded rice.

First survey of pesticide use on agricultural watershed was performed with farmers, Regional Commissioner for Agricultural Development, and pesticide dealers. Then, sediment contamination by pesticides and response of benthic communities (bacteria and free-living marine nematode) were investigated. The analysis of 22 active organochlorine pesticides in sediments was performed according to quick, easy, cheap, effective, rugged, and safe (QuEChERS) method, biodiversity of indigenous bacterial community sediment was determined by terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (T-RFLP), and free-living marine nematodes were counted. The results of the field survey showed that iodosulfuron, mesosulfuron, 2, 4 -dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2, 4 D), glyphosate, and <b>fenoxaprops</b> were the most used herbicides, tebuconazole and epoxiconazole the most used fungicides, and deltamethrin the most used insecticide. Sixteen organochlorine pesticide compounds among the 22 examined were detected in sediments up to 2  ppm in Ichkeul Lake, endrin, dieldrin, and hexachlorocyclohexane being the most detected molecules. The most pesticide-contaminated site in the lake presented the higher density of nematode, but when considering all sites, no clear correlation with organochlorine pesticide (OCP) content could be established. The bacterial community structure in the most contaminated site in the lake was characterized by the terminal restriction fragments (T-RFs) 97, 146, 258, 285, and 335 while the most contaminated site in the lagoon was characterized by the T-RFs 54, 263, 315, 403, and 428. Interestingly, T-RFs 38 and 143 were found in the most contaminated sites of both lake and lagoon ecosystems, indicating that they were resistant to OCPs and able to cope with environmental fluctuation of salinity. In contrast, the T-RFs 63, 100, 118, and 381 in the lake and the T-RFs 40, 60, 80, 158, 300, 321, and 357 in the lagoon were sensitive to OCPs. This study highlighted that the intensive use of pesticides in agriculture, through transfer to aquatic ecosystem, may disturb the benthic ecosystem functioning of the protected area.

40|$|This study {{investigated}} {{the effects of the}} herbicide from the graminicide group <b>fenoxaprop,</b> on oat plants under a normal and reduced water supply. The study was done in vegetative experimental conditions.

At the decreased level of water supply in the oat plants, activity of antioxidant enzymes – superoxide dismutase, and catalase increased. The <b>fenoxaprop</b> action did not lead to a substantial increase in superoxide anion radical and hydrogen peroxide content, which had been observed under the action of the herbicide when normal levels of water were supplied to the plants. It was concluded, that the phytotoxic action of the herbicides from the graminicide group mediated the formation of reactive oxygen species and reduction of phytotoxicity on the background effect on plants of various stressors.

These safener-induced changes closely mirrored those determined in two independent black-grass populations that had acquired multiple herbicide resistance (MHR) in the field. In addition to enhanced glutathione metabolism, both safener treatment and MHR resulted in elevated levels of flavonoids in the foliage of black-grass plants, notably flavone-C-glycosides and anthocyanins.

40|$|Poa trivialis is a {{perennial}} grass weed {{commonly found in}} perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne) racetrack swards throughout New Zealand. Its presence is undesirable as it does not tolerate high wear and is susceptible to dying out over the summer. Two pot trials at Massey University and one field trial carried out at the Awapuni racecourse were conducted during winter and spring 1995 to test the relative susceptibility of Poa trivialis and perennial ryegrass {{to a wide range}} of herbicides. A bioassay was also conducted to determine whether herbicide residues from the field trial could affect the germination of perennial ryegrass seed sown soon after treatment. Results showed that none of the chemicals at their chosen respective rates could completely remove Poa trivialis from a racetrack sward in the spring without some damage being caused to perennial ryegrass. Propyzamide and <b>fenoxaprop</b> at rates of 0. 2 and 0. 15 kg/ha respectively showed the most potential of the chemicals, severely damaging Poa trivialis (causing 50 to 75 % reductions) with no adverse effect on perennial ryegrass 8 weeks after spraying. Propyzamide can also provide some control of Poa annua. <b>Fenoxaprop</b> was not improved by increasing the application rate or adding an oil. The performance of <b>fenoxaprop</b> was substantially reduced when applied with either MCPA or a picloram/triclopyr mix. Dalapon and asulam showed good potential to control Poa trivialis but at the high rates tested caused variable or harmful effects to perennial ryegrass. Ethofumesate and chlorpropham applied at rates of 2. 0 and 2. 5 kg/ha respectively gave inadequate control of Poa trivialis. None of the above herbicides, when used in the field trial resulted in residues which reduced the germination of perennial ryegrass seed sown 3 weeks after spraying. Herbicides tested in the pot trials which showed poor control of Poa trivialis were atrazine, dicamba, isoproturon/diflufenican, linuron, mecoprop, methabenzthiazuron, metsulfuron, pendimethalin, prometryne, thifensulfuron-methyl, triclopyr, and trinexapac-ethyl.

40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{research}} was to determine the relative importance of glutathione S-transferase (GST) mediated herbicide and fungicide detoxification in wheat plants and to functionally characterise GSTs cloned from phytopathogenic fungi. Wheat seedlings treated with and without safeners were used for in vivo and in vitro pesticide metabolism studies with the herbicide fenoxaprop-P-ethyl and the fungicide fluquinconazole, which are both known to undergo glutathione conjugation. Fenoxaprop-P-ethyl underwent rapid detoxification by this route and the rates of metabolism were enhanced in safener treated wheat. In contrast, fluquinconazole was poorly metabolised with only a small proportion detoxified by glutathlonylation irrespective {{of whether or not the}} plants were safener treated. Subsequent studies confirmed that whereas <b>fenoxaprop</b> was a substrate for wheat GSTs, fluquinconazole was not. Similarly, when a diverse range of systemic and contact fungicides was tested, none were found to undergo conjugation mediated by wheat GSTs, even though several compounds underwent conjugation with glutathione in alkaline conditions. Metabolite profiling by HPLC-MS established that the alternative thiol present in wheat, hydroxymethyl glutathione, was used in addition to glutathione in <b>fenoxaprop</b> detoxification. The S-conjugates were then further metabolised by peptidases and glucosyl- and malonyl transferases to yield polar derivatives such as the cysteinyl-malonyl-glucosyl derivative. This rapid processing was in contrast to that determined in herbicide-susceptible and herbicide-resistant black-grass, where the glutathione derivative was the major metabolite of <b>fenoxaprop.</b> Using an informatics approach, GSTs in IVIagnaporthe griseae and Phytoptithora infestans were identified cloned and then expressed in E. coli, with the pure enzymes assayed for glutathione-dependent activities. MgGSTX 1 of Magnaporthe griseae was found to be a member of a novel class of GSTs (termed xi class) and was shown to function as a thioltransferase, with a specific activity of 50. 4 ± 3. 4 nKat mg (^- 1) protein. Unusually, the catalytic mechanism of thiol transfer was insensitive to the alkylating agent iodoacetamide, indicating that free cysteines were not involved in catalysis. MgGSTX 1 did not conjugate any of the experimental xenobiotics tested with GSH. The theta class GST P/GSTT 1 cloned from P. infestans exhibited glutathione peroxidase activity and readily detoxified fungitoxic oxylipins produced by potato as antimicrobial defence by potato through the action of lipoxygenases.

The sole application of postemergence herbicides reduced weed density by only 44 – 54 % and weed biomass by 51 – 61 %, whereas oxadiazon alone reduced weed density and biomass by 96 – 100 %. All herbicide treatments and manual weeding significantly affected tiller number, biomass, crop growth rate, agronomic indices, yield-contributing parameters (panicle density and filled grains), and yield (biological and grain) of rice. The highest grain yield was obtained in the manually weeded plots (5. 9 – 6. 1 t ha− 1) and the plots treated with oxadiazon alone (5. 4 – 5. 6 t ha− 1) and oxadiazon followed by postemergence herbicides (5. 2 – 5. 8 t ha− 1). The lowest paddy yield (0. 22 t ha− 1) was achieved in the nontreated plots followed by the plots treated with the sole application of bispyribac-sodium and <b>fenoxaprop</b> + ethoxysulfuron. The results suggest that oxadiazon is the best broad-spectrum and economically effective herbicide when applied alone or in combination with other effective postemergence herbicides with different modes of action, depending on the weed species present in the field...|$|E
40|$|Rice {{is one of}} {{the staple}} food crops of India, and Karnataka {{is one of the}} major rice-producing states. The primary method of rice {{establishment}} in Karnataka is transplanting, but farmers are opting to shift to direct-seeding of rice. Weed management is critical for realizing optimal yield of direct-seeded rice (DSR). The objective of this review was to synthesize the published literature on weeds and weed management in rice in Karnataka, identify improved weed-management technologies for delivery to farmers, and suggest research needs. Some 98 weed species are reported to be associated with rice in Karnataka. Weed control to date in Karnataka has mostly been based on herbicides. Hand-weeding was found to be effective in all methods of rice establishment. However, it is time-consuming, tedious, and costly because labor is becoming scarce and unavailable, and labor wages are higher. Several PRE and POST herbicides that were effective in other Asian countries were also found to be effective in managing weeds in rice established by different methods in Karnataka. Bensulfuron plus pretilachlor and pyrazosulfuron in aerobic rice and pendimethalin, thiobencarb, bispyribac-sodium, cyhalofop, <b>fenoxaprop</b> plus chlorimuron plus metsulfuron, and <b>fenoxaprop</b> plus ethoxysulfuron in dry-DSR were found effective in managing weeds. In wet-DSR, butachlor plus safener and pretilachlor plus safener were effective. Thiobencarb, pendimethalin, pretilachlor, azimsulfuron plus metsulfuron, bispyribac-sodium, butachlor, cinosulfuron, oxadiazon, and quinclorac were found promising for weed management in transplanted rice. Integration of herbicides with hand-weeding or intercultivation was found to be effective in rice established by different methods. Options that were found economical in managing weeds varied across the different rice-establishment methods. The need for developing location-specific, sustainable, integrated weed management and extension of available technologies for the farming community in Karnataka is emphasized...|$|E

The objectives {{of this research}} were to provide a ‘snapshot’ of herbicide-resistant Echinochloa spp. in rice producing counties, determine how much resistance has spread across the state, and understand the effectiveness of 4 -hydroxyphenylpyruvate dioxygenase (HPPD) -inhibiting herbicides for control of glyphosate-resistant (GR) Palmer amaranth relative to commercial standards currently labeled in soybean. To assess the prevalence of Echinochloa spp. resistance, 82 samples were collected from 23 rice producing counties in 2010. The samples were tested for resistance to commonly used rice herbicides: propanil, quinclorac, imazethapyr, <b>fenoxaprop,</b> clomazone, and glyphosate. Of the 82 samples collected, 29 were resistant to propanil, 13 were resistant to quinclorac and 9 samples were resistant to both propanil and quinclorac. Accessions were also treated with 0. 5 x the labeled field rate for glufosinate and isoxaflutole to determine background variation in sensitivity among populations to these herbicides as Echinochloa is among the major weeds in crops where these herbicides are used. No resistance to imazethapyr, clomazone, <b>fenoxaprop,</b> or glyphosate was observed; likewise all accessions were sensitive to glufosinate or isoxaflutole. One strategy for controlling herbicide-resistant weeds {{is the use of}} transgenic crops. The expected release of soybean in 2016 and cotton in 2020 with resistance to HPPD-inhibiting herbicides provide alternative mechanisms-of-action to control weeds. Experiments were conducted in 2010 and 2011 to determine the efficacy of HPPD-inhibiting herbicides as a preemergence (PRE) option for Echinochloa spp. and Palmer amaranth control and as a postemergence (POST) option with and without glyphosate or glufosinate. The PRE applied HPPD-inhibiting herbicides do not carry the residual control as the current industry standards; however they are still capable of providing 4 weeks of control of Palmer amaranth and Echinochloa spp [...] For both years in the POST trials, all treatments, except glyphosate alone, provided 3 ̆e 90...|$|E

A field study was conducted in the wet season of 2012 and dry season of 2013 to evaluate the performance of five rice establishment methods and four weed control treatments on weed management, and rice yield. Grass weeds were higher in dry-seeded rice (DSR) as compared to PTR and nonpuddled transplanted rice (NPTR). The highest total weed density (225 - 256 plantsm- 2) and total weed biomass (315 - 501 gm- 2) were recorded in DSR while the lowest (102 - 129 plantsm- 2 and 75 - 387 gm- 2) in PTR.

The surveyed regions encompassed four different cropping systems including rice–wheat, maize–wheat, cotton–wheat and mixed cropping. Dose–response assay was conducted for confirmation of resistance. Efficacy of herbicide mixtures including clodinafop–propargyl, metribuzin, pinoxaden and sulfosulfuron at a range of doses was investigated to manage littleseed canarygrass. Results revealed that all populations were resistant to <b>fenoxaprop</b> except PM-BWL- 2. The higher level resistance (6. 5) was found in populations collected from rice–wheat cropping system. The tested herbicide mixtures at 75 % and 100 % of the recommended dose of each mixture component provided the effective control of resistant littleseed canarygrass. Mixtures at 50 % provided more than 80 % control and reduced growth and seed production potential of surviving plants. The confirmation of ACCase inhibitor resistance as the first case of herbicide resistance in Pakistan, leads us to discourage use of ACCase inhibitor herbicides alone.
