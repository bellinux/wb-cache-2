5|$|A team of {{researchers}} discover remains of a crashed spaceship in the Arctic Circle, finding several humanoids with cybernetic implants <b>frozen</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> wreckage. Two bodies are taken to a nearby compound to be studied. The scientists marvel at the nanoprobes that begin to repair the long dead aliens. Suddenly one of the seemingly dead subjects attacks the scientists, assimilating them. Using scavenged wreckage to enhance the transport, they then escape into space, upgrading it with a faster than standard warp drive and weapons.|$|E
5|$|The use of fungi {{by humans}} {{dates back to}} prehistory; Ötzi the Iceman, a well-preserved mummy of a 5,300-year-old Neolithic man found <b>frozen</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Austrian Alps, carried two species of polypore {{mushrooms}} {{that may have been}} used as tinder (Fomes fomentarius), or for medicinal purposes (Piptoporus betulinus). Ancient peoples have used fungi as food sources–often unknowingly–for millennia, in the preparation of leavened bread and fermented juices. Some of the oldest written records contain references to the destruction of crops that were probably caused by pathogenic fungi.|$|E

40|$|Research PaperLinear {{approximate}} almost ideal demand {{system was}} employed to estimate demand for Thai <b>frozen</b> shrimp <b>in</b> <b>the</b> United States of America, the main importing country for Thai frozen shrimp. Import demands for the same products from Bangladesh, China, Ecuador, India, Indonesia, Mexico, and Vietnam were simultaneously estimated to compare with the import demands from Thailand. Three major frozen shrimp imports including large shell-on, medium shell-on and peeled frozen shrimp were included in this study. Results of the estimated demand functions indicated that the competitors of Thai large shell-on <b>frozen</b> shrimp <b>in</b> <b>the</b> United States market were India and Ecuador. For medium shell-on frozen shrimp, Thailand had to compete with India, Indonesia, Vietnam, Ecuador and Bangladesh. Competitors for Thai peeled <b>frozen</b> shrimp <b>in</b> <b>the</b> United States were Bangladesh, Indonesia, India, Vietnam and Ecuador. Owned price elasticites and income elasticites of demand for Thai <b>frozen</b> shrimp <b>in</b> <b>the</b> United States market were relatively higher that those of the competitors. To maintain Thai frozen shrimp market share <b>in</b> <b>the</b> United States market, product quality should be the key issue...|$|R

5|$|The {{idea for}} the {{expedition}} had arisen after items from the American vessel Jeannette, which had sunk off the north coast of Siberia in 1881, were discovered three years later off the south-west coast of Greenland. The wreckage had obviously been carried across the polar ocean, perhaps across the pole itself. Based on this and other debris recovered from the Greenland coast, the meteorologist Henrik Mohn developed a theory of transpolar drift, which led Nansen {{to believe that a}} specially designed ship could be <b>frozen</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> pack ice and follow the same track as the Jeannette wreckage, thus reaching the vicinity of the pole.|$|E
5|$|There are varying {{accounts}} {{about how}} much danger the production encountered during the 1932–33 winter season. The Hollywood Reporter said in October 1932 that the Nanuk {{was caught in the}} ice off Alaska and sled dog teams had to be used to rescue the film crew. However, crew on the film noted that the Nanuk wintered in Grantley Harbor at Teller. A press release by MGM in November 1932 claimed that the Nanuk reported via radio that it was <b>frozen</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> sea ice and drifting with 35 people aboard, unable to continue shooting until the spring. A report by the New York Times in February 1933 also claimed the Nanuk was locked in sea ice between Teller and Barrow. Peter Freuchen also relates that the Nanuk was blown off course by heavy winds several times.|$|E

25|$|Traces of the Copper Age (Chalcolithic era) in Austria were {{identified}} in the Carpathian Basin hoard at Stollhof, Hohe Wand, Lower Austria.

25|$|When one is {{considering}} allylic strain, {{one needs to}} consider the possible conformers and the possible stereoelectronic demand of the reaction. For example, in the conformation of (Z)-4-methylpent-2-ene, the molecule isn't <b>frozen</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> favored conformer but rotates in the dihedral angle around 30° at <1kcal/mol cost. In stereoselective reactions, there are 2 effects of allylic strain on the reaction which is the sterics effect and the electronic effects. The sterics effect is where the largest group prefer to be the farthest from the alkene. The electronic effect is where the orbitals of the subsituents prefer to align anti or outside of the orbitals depending on the reaction.|$|E

25|$|The {{bearers of}} the Pazyryk culture were horse-riding {{pastoral}} nomads of the steppe, and some may have accumulated great wealth through horse trading with merchants in Persia, India and China. This wealth {{is evident in}} the wide array of finds from the Pazyryk tombs, which include many rare examples of organic objects such as felt hangings, Chinese silk, the earliest known pile carpet, horses decked out in elaborate trappings, and wooden furniture and other household goods. These finds were preserved when water seeped into the tombs in antiquity and froze, encasing the burial goods in ice, which remained <b>frozen</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> permafrost until the time of their excavation.|$|E

25|$|After Gaggi's release, Montiglio {{had become}} a drug addict and fled New York for fear of {{punishment}} from the Gambino family. The FBI dismantled DeMeo's auto theft ring and sent two crew members to prison. In 1980, a third crew member, Vito Arena, became a government witness. In 1982, Arena began testifying about crimes committed by Gaggi and the DeMeo crew. As the investigation intensified, Castellano became concerned about DeMeo cooperating with authorities if he were arrested. On January 10, 1983, DeMeo's body was found nearly <b>frozen</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> trunk of his car.

25|$|During {{the last}} glacial period, {{enough of the}} earth's water became <b>frozen</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> great ice sheets {{covering}} North America and Europe to cause a drop in sea levels.

Other land bridges around the world have emerged and disappeared in the same way. Around 14,000 years ago, mainland Australia was linked to both New Guinea and Tasmania, the British Isles became an extension of continental Europe via the dry beds of the English Channel and North Sea, and the dry bed of the South China Sea linked Sumatra, Java, and Borneo to Indochina.|$|E

The British troops then streamed across the frozen river to attack the town of Ogdensburg, where they destroyed the military barracks and four American ships <b>frozen</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> ice, and returned to Prescott with significant amounts of food, ammunition, cannon and prisoners. This winter raid was in direct response to prior raids on Gananoque and Elizabethtown (present-day Brockville, Ontario) by Captain Benjamin Forsyth and soldiers of the U.S. 1st Rifle Regiment, who in February 1813 were based in Ogdensburg.|$|E
