50|$|Transformers couple by {{magnetic}} flux. The {{primary and}} secondary windings of a transformer are not connected to each other (an autotransformer has a conductive connection between its windings and so does not provide isolation). The voltage difference that may safely be applied between windings without risk of breakdown (the <b>isolation</b> <b>voltage)</b> is specified in kilovolts by an industry standard. The same applies to transductors. While transformers are usually used to change voltages, isolation transformers with a 1:1 ratio are used in safety applications.|$|E
50|$|The {{physical}} layout of an opto-isolator depends {{primarily on the}} desired <b>isolation</b> <b>voltage.</b> Devices rated {{for less than a}} few kV have planar (or sandwich) construction. The sensor die is mounted directly on the lead frame of its package (usually, a six-pin or a four-pin dual in-line package). The sensor is covered with a sheet of glass or clear plastic, which is topped with the LED die. The LED beam fires downward. To minimize losses of light, the useful absorption spectrum of the sensor must match the output spectrum of the LED, which almost invariably lies in the near infrared. The optical channel is made as thin as possible for a desired breakdown voltage. For example, to be rated for short-term voltages of 3.75 kV and transients of 1 kV/μs, the clear polyimide sheet in the Avago ASSR-300 series is only 0.08 mm thick. Breakdown voltages of planar assemblies depend on the thickness of the transparent sheet and the configuration of bonding wires that connect the dies with external pins. Real in-circuit <b>isolation</b> <b>voltage</b> is further reduced by creepage over the PCB and the surface of the package. Safe design rules require a minimal clearance of 25 mm/kV for bare metal conductors or 8.3 mm/kV for coated conductors.|$|E

30|$|Generation, {{transmission}} and {{distribution of electrical energy}} are the most important factors in modern energy systems and transformers provide the most important role in these systems. Transformers which carry out many fundamental tasks such as galvanic <b>isolation,</b> <b>voltage</b> transformation, noise decoupling are widely used in electric power systems. It is well-known that classic (50 / 60  Hz) transformers have many positive features such as high efficiency, low cost and high reliability (Ronan et al. 2002; Yang et al. 2015; Zhao et al. 2013; Wang et al. 2007; Hwang et al. 2013). However, these conventional transformers have many undesirable drawbacks. These drawbacks include: (1) Conventional transformers have large size and weight because of their copper windings and iron core. (2) Conventional transformers are a passive component between the high and low voltages. Therefore, when voltage sags and swells occur at the input side, the output side is affected by these conditions. Harmonics in the output currents affect the input currents of transformers. In this case, harmonics can spread to the grid or can increase losses in the primary winding. Therefore, transformers have poor voltage regulation and low harmonic isolation. (3) Mineral oils used in transformers can be harmful when exposed to the environment in case of any fault in the transformer.|$|E

40|$|The {{reliability}} of power electronic devices is {{significantly related to}} the material properties of the applied substrates which carry the semiconductor chip and the electric interconnections. The most common solution to fulfill the stringent requirements of these devices, with respect to high <b>isolation</b> <b>voltage,</b> good thermal conductivity, high temperature cycling reliability and low cost, is to use ceramic substrates with copper layers on both sides. However, the currently increasing reliability standards in power electronics lead to a situation where common DCB substrates reach their limits in meeting these higher requirements. In previous years, ceramic substrates with aluminum instead of the copper metallization layers (Direct Aluminum Bonding, DAB) were introduced. For DAB substrates, a higher reliability especially for temperature cycling tests was found. In this study, results of Finite Element simulations of DAB substrates are presented. For the DAB samples, signi ficantly lower mechanical stresses inside the ceramic were found in comparison to DCB substrates with the same thermal loading situation, thus explaining the improvements in reliability. In addition, the DAB bonding contacts between the aluminum metallization and the alumina were assessed by Scanning Acoustic Microscopy (SAM) and microstructure analysis on cross sections by Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) and Energy Dispersive x-ray spectroscopy (EDS). The results indicate good adhesion between the metal layer and the ceramic due to the found interface microstructure and the lack of defects. Thus, Direct Bonded Aluminium (DAB) substrates provide a promising alternative solution to realize more reliable substrates for power electronic devices, in particular to consider the increasing requirements from automotive and avionic industry...|$|E

40|$|In many power {{electronic}} applications galvanic isolated IGBT/MOSFET drivers are advantageously used. The main reasons are safety issues, driving high voltage power semiconductors with blocking voltages of typically 600 V or above and avoiding or minimizing unwanted ground current loops. The last can disturb the driver or the whole {{power electronic}} system. In this paper a new method for achieving galvanic <b>isolation</b> in high <b>voltage</b> drivers based on {{printed circuit board}} (PCB) integrated capacitive coupling elements will be described. The suggested coupling element consists {{of a pair of}} plate capacitors by using copper layers and prepregs of a PCB. First, the influence of the isolation barrier coupling capacitance, {{which is one of the}} main important parameters of a galvanic isolated d river, is illustrated by a simple model of the capacitive current loop. As a result it is stated that the coupling capacitance should be lower than 5 pF to achieve high dU/dt levels of at least 100 kV/μs with the modeled driver circuit. Hereby and taking into account the isolation characteristics of the commonly used FR 4 PCB material, an integrated capacitive coupling element is designed. With 360 μm isolation distance, and a plate surface of approximately 8 mm², a capacitance of about 1 pF is achieved. A comparison of the developed capacitive coupling element with a comparable inductive coupling element (transformer) shows that the former has advantages due to a much lower current consumption and less dependency on parasitic inductancies. Therefore using galvanic isolat ed drivers in system integrated power electronics means achieving very small solutions. On the other side high <b>isolation</b> <b>voltages</b> on PCBs require wide creepage and clearance distances, especially at higher humidity levels. For solving this conflict a special layout is suggested, were the both sides behind the isolation barrier of the driver are placed on different sides on the PCB by using blind and buried vias. In addition a method for transmitting the switching signal over the isolation barrier is suggested. The well known Manchester coding is applied to use the advantages of phase modulated signals. Reducing the complexity for decoding the switching signal, it is suggested to transmit the carrier frequency by a second capacitive coupling element. Hereby, coder as well as decode r could be realized by a simple exclusive logic or gate. To verify the new isolation method a half bridge driver was built up. With that a bidirectional buck-boost DC/DC converter, operating at a DC link voltage of 300 V, was successfully controlled. Moreover measurements with a standardized burst generator show, that failure free operation of the driver are possible up to high dU/dt levels...|$|R
