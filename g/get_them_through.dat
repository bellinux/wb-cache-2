There was some aspect of service parochialism, and Parsons believed that involvement in the Manhattan Project would be important {{for the future of the}} Navy, but it was also due to the difficulty of getting highly skilled people from any source in wartime. Parsons simply found it easiest to <b>get</b> <b>them</b> <b>through</b> Navy channels. Lieutenant Commander Norris Bradbury said that he did not wish to join Project Y, but was soon on his way to Los Alamos anyway.

On March 19, 1945, Hitler issued his Nero Decree, ordering a scorched earth policy in both Germany and the occupied territories.

Hitler gave Speer 24 hours to reconsider his position, and when the two met the following day, Speer answered, [...] "I stand unconditionally behind you." [...] However, he demanded the exclusive power to implement the Nero Decree, and Hitler signed an order to that effect. Using this order, Speer worked to persuade generals and Gauleiters to circumvent the Nero Decree and avoid needless sacrifice of personnel and destruction of industry that would be needed after the war.|$|E

[...] Eisenbeis further complained that [...] "in the first arc of Sword Art Online, Asuna was a strong fighter and one of the leaders who thousands depended on to <b>get</b> <b>them</b> <b>through</b> the death game alive. In the second arc, she was powerless, locked in a literal bird cage and molested by her captor while waiting for her hero to rescue her.

Meanwhile, Reid had great trouble in passing his land and income tax bills. When he did <b>get</b> <b>them</b> <b>through</b> the Assembly the Council threw them out. [...] Reid obtained a dissolution, was victorious at the polls, and heavily defeated Parkes for the new single-member electoral district of Sydney-King. [...] He eventually succeeded in passing his acts, which were moderate, but was strenuously opposed by the Council, and it was only the fear that the chamber might be swamped with new appointments that eventually wore down the opposition. Reid was also successful in bringing in reforms in the keeping of public accounts and in the civil service generally. Other acts dealt with the control of inland waters, and much needed legislation relating to public health, factories, and mining, was also passed. In five years he achieved more than any of his predecessors.|$|E
