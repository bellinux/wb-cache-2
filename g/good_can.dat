5|$|Any {{point that}} lies {{either on the}} {{production}} possibilities curve or {{to the left of}} it is said to be an attainable point: it can be produced with currently available resources. Points that lie {{to the right of the}} production possibilities curve are said to be unattainable because they cannot be produced using currently available resources. Points that lie strictly to the left of the curve are said to be inefficient, because existing resources would allow for production of more of at least one good without sacrificing the production of any other good. An efficient point is one that lies on the production possibilities curve. At any such point, more of one <b>good</b> <b>can</b> be produced only by producing less of the other.|$|E

25|$|The story {{states that}} the young John Lambton was a rebellious {{character}} who missed church one Sunday to go fishing in the River Wear. In many versions of the story, while walking to the river, or setting up his equipment, John receives warnings from an old man (or a witch – depending on who tells the story) that no <b>good</b> <b>can</b> come from missing church.|$|E

25|$|Another example {{involves}} the production possibilities frontier, which specifies what combinations {{of various types}} of goods can be produced by a society with certain amounts of various resources. The frontier specifies the trade-offs that the society is faced with — if the society is fully utilizing its resources, more of one <b>good</b> <b>can</b> be produced only {{at the expense of}} producing less of another good. A society must then use some process to choose among the possibilities on the frontier.|$|E
25|$|Also, the {{decision}} {{as to whether or not}} the mate is <b>good</b> <b>can</b> be made with the emotional boundary of the shadchan who, if so desired by the couple, can call and talk to either side in the beginning stages of the dating to iron out issues that can crop up during the dating process. Usually as the couple see more of each other the shadchan backs away and lets the couple manage it themselves. It's expected that the couple keep the shadchan up-to-date on how the shidduch is going at regular intervals.|$|E
25|$|A {{final step}} {{can be taken}} in {{relating}} the composite good to a unit of account such as money by setting {{the price of the}} composite good to 1. Since the prices of all other goods are known, the composite <b>good</b> <b>can</b> be converted into any combination of bundles that represent the optimal choice other than the first good. This final step clarifies the relation of the model to the real world where many goods can be stated in terms of money value. In John R. Hicks's classic Value and Capital (1939), a composite good was used to generalize mathematically from consumer demand equilibrium for an individual in the 2-good case to market equilibrium via supply and demand in the n-good case.|$|E
5000|$|Say's law {{states that}} [...] "The more goods {{which there is}} demand that are produced, the more those <b>goods</b> (supply) <b>can</b> {{constitute}} a demand for other goods". Keynes summarized this [...] "law" [...] as asserting that [...] "supply creates its own demand", though this interpretation has been criticized. The consumer's desire to trade causes the potential consumer to become a producer to create <b>goods</b> that <b>can</b> be exchanged for the goods of others, goods are directly or indirectly exchanged for other <b>goods.</b> Because <b>goods</b> <b>can</b> only {{be paid for by}} other <b>goods,</b> no demand <b>can</b> exist without prior production. Following Say's law, overproduction (in the economy as a whole, specific <b>goods</b> <b>can</b> still be overproduced) is only possible in a limited sense.|$|R

25|$|The {{starting}} point of the scholarly controversy is the disputed meaning of the Greek concept of ousia. This is an ordinary Greek word and literally means 'being.' In philosophical contexts, it is usually translated by 'Being' or 'Essence.' Plato's Republic says that the Good is 'not ousia' but is rather 'beyond ousia' and surpasses it as an origin and in power. If this passage implies only that the essence or nature of the Good is beyond Being (but not the Good itself), or if the passage is just interpreted loosely, then the Form of the <b>Good</b> <b>can</b> retain its place inside {{the realm of the}} Forms, i.e., the realm of things with real Being. In this case the Good is not absolutely transcendent: it does not transcend Being and somehow exist above it. The Good would therefore have a place in the hierarchy of real Beings. According to this interpretation, the Good is not an issue for the two principles of the unwritten doctrines but only for the Theory of Forms. On the other hand, if the passage in the Republic is read literally and 'ousia' means 'Being,' then the phrase 'beyond Being' implies the Good actually transcends Being. According to this interpretation, Plato considered the Good to be absolutely transcendent and it must be integrated into the realm of the two principles.|$|E

500|$|The {{ice cream}} sparked {{debate in the}} Los Angeles Times, when food writer Noelle Carter {{described}} bacon ice cream as perfection but the health section put up {{a photograph of a}} heart bypass and the headline [...] "Bacon ice cream. No <b>good</b> <b>can</b> come of it". The Delaware [...] "Udder Delight" [...] ice cream maker, Chip Hearn, who made bacon ice cream appears to have done so partly as a gimmick to get people into his shop, since he allows customers to taste any flavour in the store. He felt that his flavours differentiated him from the many other parlours on the shore and many people come in to try bacon ice cream only to buy something else.|$|E
500|$|In the PPF, {{all points}} on the curve are points of maximum [...] {{productive}} efficiency (no more output of any <b>good</b> <b>can</b> be achieved from the given inputs without sacrificing output of some good); all points inside the frontier (such as A) can be produced but are productively inefficient; all points outside the curve (such as X) cannot be produced with the given, existing resources. Not all {{points on the}} curve are Pareto efficient, however; only in the case where the marginal rate of transformation is equal to all consumers' marginal rate of substitution and hence equal to the ratio of prices will it be impossible to find any trade that will make no consumer worse off.|$|E
500|$|The {{slope of}} the production–possibility {{frontier}} (PPF) at any given point is called the marginal rate of transformation (MRT). The slope defines {{the rate at which}} production of one <b>good</b> <b>can</b> be redirected (by reallocation of productive resources) into production of the other. It is also called the (marginal) [...] "opportunity cost" [...] of a commodity, that is, it is the opportunity cost of X in terms of Y at the margin. It measures how much of good Y is given up for one more unit of good X or vice versa. The shape of a PPF is commonly drawn as concave to the origin to represent increasing opportunity cost with increased output of a good. Thus, MRT increases in absolute size as one moves from the top left of the PPF to the bottom right of the PPF.|$|E
