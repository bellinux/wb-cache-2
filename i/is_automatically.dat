A player ejected for three major penalties in a game, or for use of weapons, cannot be replaced for five minutes.

5|$|Before public release, {{work units}} go through several quality {{assurance}} steps to keep problematic ones from becoming fully available. These testing stages include internal, beta, and advanced, before a final full release across Folding@home. Folding@home's work units are normally processed only once, {{except in the}} rare event that errors occur during processing. If this occurs for three different users, the unit <b>is</b> <b>automatically</b> pulled from distribution.

ISSF rules now require the use of these systems in top-level competitions. They are generally used in other international competitions as well, and in some countries they are even common in national competitions.|$|E

5|$|In {{commemoration}} of Pancake Day in the United Kingdom, a novelty pancake machine {{was built by}} The Happy Egg Company in February 2013 that involved a complex series of steps to automatically produce pancakes from scratch. The machine {{involves the use of}} a freshly laid egg from a hen that rolls onto a turntable, which then moves the egg to an area where it <b>is</b> <b>automatically</b> cracked and mixed with other ingredients. After this point, the mixture is poured into a griddle, flipped to cook the other side, and then flipped onto a plate.|$|E
5|$|Magic, {{like many}} other games, {{combines}} chance and skill. One frequent complaint about the game involves {{the notion that there}} is too much luck involved, especially concerning possessing too many or too few lands. Early in the game especially, too many or too few lands could ruin a player's chance at victory without the player having made a mistake. This in-game statistical variance can be minimized by proper deck construction, as an appropriate land count can reduce mana problems. In Duels of the Planeswalkers 2012, the land count <b>is</b> <b>automatically</b> adjusted to 40% of the total deck size.|$|E
5|$|Subtropical {{cyclones}} with hurricane-force {{winds of}} greater than 33m/s, (119km/h, 64knots, or 74mph) are not officially {{recognized by the}} National Hurricane Center. Once a subtropical storm intensifies enough to have hurricane-force winds, then it <b>is</b> <b>automatically</b> assumed to have become a fully tropical hurricane. Despite this however, {{prior to the start}} of modern policies two systems in the Atlantic hurricane database attained hurricane-force winds as a subtropical cyclone; a subtropical storm in 1968, and a subtropical storm in 1979.|$|E

The champion also receives membership on the PGA Tour for the following five years and invitations to The Players Championship for five years. The prize of the tournament is the Wanamaker Trophy, which the champion keeps until the following year's competition. The PGA Championship was originally a match play event; however, in 1958 it was changed to a stroke play event.|$|E
5|$|The {{sales tax}} rate, {{as defined in}} the {{legislation}} for the first year, is 23% of the total payment including the tax ($23 of every $100 spent in total—calculated similar to income taxes). This would be equivalent to a 30% traditional U.S. sales tax ($23 on top of every $77 spent—$100 total, or $30 on top of every $100 spent—$130 total). After {{the first year of}} implementation, this rate <b>is</b> <b>automatically</b> adjusted annually using a predefined formula reflecting actual federal receipts in the previous fiscal year.|$|E
5|$|There {{are certain}} {{architectural}} styles {{present in the}} game; architectural styles determine the appearance of in-game buildings. Each civilization <b>is</b> <b>automatically</b> assigned its architectural style. These three architectural styles are the Western European, which consists of classical styled wooden buildings and is shared by the British, French and Dutch; the Eastern European, which consists of wooden and straw structures and is shared by the Germans and Russians, and the Mediterranean, which consists of buildings made of stucco cement and dry brick, which is shared by the Spanish, Portuguese and Ottomans.|$|E

5|$|Evolve {{features}} {{a total of}} 20 different human characters split into four classes, each class containing 5 characters. Each class has different skills and abilities, and players are required to cooperate {{with each other in}} a match. Players unlock new characters as they progress through the game, e.g. the fourth Assault character will be unlocked if the player has upgraded the previous three Assault characters. The Hunters class features first-person gameplay. The ammunition of their weapons <b>is</b> <b>automatically</b> refilled when not in use, and iron sights are used in- game. Evolve does not allow multiple players to play as the same class in a match. Gameplay variations are also present within the characters in the same class.|$|E
5|$|FairTax proponents {{argue that}} the {{proposal}} would provide tax burden visibility and reduce compliance and efficiency costs by 90%, returning {{a large share of}} money to the productive economy. The Beacon Hill Institute concluded that the FairTax would save $346.51 billion in administrative costs and would be a much more efficient taxation system. Bill Archer, former head of the House Ways and Means Committee, asked Princeton University Econometrics to survey 500 European and Asian companies regarding the effect on their business decisions if the United States enacted the FairTax. 400 of those companies stated they would build their next plant in the United States, and 100 companies said they would move their corporate headquarters to the United States. Supporters {{argue that the}} U.S. has the highest combined statutory corporate income tax rate among OECD countries along with being the only country with no border adjustment element in its tax system. Proponents state that because the FairTax eliminates corporate income taxes and <b>is</b> <b>automatically</b> border adjustable, the competitive tax advantage of foreign producers would be eliminated, immediately boosting U.S. competitiveness overseas and at home.|$|E
5|$|Four magical {{disciplines}} are acquired, {{including the}} Fire of Ares, the Ice of Poseidon, the Lightning of Zeus, and the Soul of Hades, which, {{depending on the}} magic equipped, imbues the Blades of Chaos with that elemental property. For example, the Soul of Hades imbues the Blades with purple flames and can unleash souls of the Underworld to briefly attack enemies. The Ice of Poseidon also enables Kratos to breathe underwater, a necessary ability as substantial time is spent there. The Rage ability called Rage of the Gods that was featured in previous games is included, but in this game, its meter is filled by landing attacks on enemies and the ability <b>is</b> <b>automatically</b> activated once the meter has reached maximum capacity. It remains activated until Kratos is attacked or stops attacking {{for an extended period}} of time, after which the meter must be refilled. The Rage ability is also affected by the magic equipped, allowing Kratos to use different Rage attacks, such as the lightning-based Rage of Zeus.|$|E
