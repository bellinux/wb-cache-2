5|$|An eighth, fragmentary {{specimen}} {{was discovered}} in 1990, not in Solnhofen limestone, but in somewhat younger sediments at Daiting, Suevia.

5|$|Bum Phillips {{was fired}} {{three days after}} Houston's loss in the wild-card game, and {{defensive}} coordinator Ed Biles was given the head coaching job.

Also for the first time, Campbell did not claim the rushing yards title, as he finished fifth in yards with 1,376 and seventh in touchdowns with 10. The highlight of the season was back-to-back rushing performances of over 180 yards, against the Bengals in Week 5 and the Seahawks in Week 6. His 39 carries against the Seahawks set an Oilers single-game record. Campbell was invited to his fourth Pro Bowl, but failed to make an All-Pro roster. A players' strike in 1982 shortened the season to nine games and the Oilers finished with a 1–8 record. Campbell had just two touchdowns and 538 rushing yards, an average of 59.8 yards per game—far below his average of 104.1 per game over the previous four seasons.|$|E
