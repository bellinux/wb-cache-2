A key concern of any large-scale distributed system is the validation of <b>global</b> <b>properties,</b> which cannot be evaluated on a single node. Thus, it is necessary to gather data from distributed nodes and to aggregate these data into a global view. This turns out to be very challenging because of the system's dynamism that imposes very frequent changes in local values that affect <b>global</b> <b>properties.</b> This implies that the global view has to be frequently updated to ensure an accurate validation of <b>global</b> <b>properties.</b> In this paper, we present a model-based approach to define a dynamic oracle for checking <b>global</b> <b>properties.</b> Our objective is to abstract relevant aspects of such systems into models. These models are updated at runtime, by monitoring the corresponding distributed system.

2500|$|Grünbaum and Shephard {{distinguish}} {{the description of}} these tilings as Archimedean as referring only to the local property of the arrangement of tiles around each vertex being the same, and that as uniform as referring to the <b>global</b> <b>property</b> of vertex-transitivity.

2500|$|In general topological spaces, {{however, the}} {{different}} notions of compactness are not equivalent, {{and the most}} useful notion of compactnessoriginally called bicompactnessis defined using covers consisting of open sets (see Open cover definition below). That this form of compactness holds for closed and bounded subsets of Euclidean space {{is known as the}} Heine–Borel theorem. Compactness, when defined in this manner, often allows one to take information that is known locallyin a neighbourhood of each point of the spaceand to extend it to information that holds globally throughout the space. [...] An example of this phenomenon is Dirichlet's theorem, to which it was originally applied by Heine, that a continuous function on a compact interval is uniformly continuous; here, continuity is a local property of the function, and uniform continuity the corresponding <b>global</b> <b>property.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Continuity {{itself is}} a local {{property}} of a function—that is, a function f is continuous, or not, at a particular point, and this can be determined by looking only at {{the values of the}} function in an (arbitrarily small) neighbourhood of that point. [...] When we speak of a function being continuous on an interval, we mean only that it is continuous at each point of the interval. [...] In contrast, uniform continuity is a <b>global</b> <b>property</b> of f, {{in the sense that the}} standard definition refers to pairs of points rather than individual points. [...] On the other hand, it is possible to give a definition that is local in terms of the natural extension f* (the characteristics of which at nonstandard points are determined by the global properties of f), although it is not possible to give a local definition of uniform continuity for an arbitrary hyperreal-valued function, see below.|$|E

40|$|Human {{observers}} {{are able to}} rapidly and accurately categorize natural scenes, but the representation mediating this feat is still unknown. Here we propose a framework of rapid scene categorization that does not segment a scene into objects and instead uses a vocabulary of <b>global,</b> ecological <b>properties</b> that describe spatial and functional aspects of scene space (such as navigability or mean depth). In Chapter 1, four experiments explore the human sensitivity to <b>global</b> <b>properties</b> for rapid scene categorization, {{as well as the}} computational sufficiency of these properties for predicting scene categories. Chapter 2 explores the time course of scene understanding, finding that <b>global</b> <b>properties</b> can be perceived with less image exposure than the computation of a scene's basic-level category. Finally, in Chapter 3, I explore aftereffects to adaptation to <b>global</b> <b>properties,</b> showing that repeated exposure to many <b>global</b> <b>properties</b> produces robust high-level aftereffects, thus providing evidence for the neural coding of these properties. Altogether, these results provide support for the hypothesis that rapid categorization of natural scenes may not be mediated primarily though objects and parts, but also through <b>global</b> <b>properties</b> of structure and affordance. by Michelle R.

40|$|Abstract. Systems of {{autonomous}} agents providing automated services over the Web are fast becoming a reality. Often these agent systems {{are constructed using}} procedural architectures that {{provide a framework for}} connecting agent components that perform specific tasks. The agent designer codes the tasks necessary to perform a service and uses the framework to connect the tasks into an integrated agent structure. This bottom up approach does not provide an easy mechanism for confirming <b>global</b> <b>properties</b> of constructed agent systems. In this paper we propose a declarative methodology based on logic programming for modeling such procedurally constructed agents and specifying their <b>global</b> <b>properties</b> as temporal logic formulas. This methodology allows us to bring to bear a body of work for using logic programming based model checking to verify certain <b>global</b> <b>properties</b> of procedurally constructed Multi-Agent Systems. ...|$|R
