In the last two decades, Berrios has reported case studies in 1990 and 1991 along with Keshavan et al. in 1992. Berrios concluded that confirmed diagnoses of deafness, ear disease, brain disease, advanced age and drug use are all important factors in the development of musical hallucinations. After analyzing 46 cases, Berrios found a female predominance of 80% in women over the age of 60. The study concluded that musical hallucinations {{were more likely to be}} seen in elderly women affected by deafness or brain disease than in individuals with no psychiatric illness at all.|$|R
40|$|Information {{technologies}} (ITs) {{have now}} entered the everyday workflow {{in a variety}} of healthcare providers with a certain degree of independence. This independence may be the cause of difficulty in interoperability between information systems and it can be overcome through the implementation and adoption of standards. Here we present the case of the Lombardy Region, in Italy, that has been able, in the last 10 years, to set up the Regional Social and Healthcare Information System, connecting all the healthcare providers within the region, and providing full access to clinical and health-related documents independently from the healthcare organization that generated the document itself. This goal, in a region with almost 10 millions citizens, was achieved through a twofold approach: first, the political and operative push towards the adoption of the Health Level 7 (HL 7) standard within single hospitals and, second, providing a technological infrastructure for data sharing based on interoperability specifications recognized at the regional level for messages transmitted from healthcare providers to the central domain. The adoption of such regional interoperability specifications enabled the communication among heterogeneous systems placed in different hospitals in Lombardy. Integrating the Healthcare Enterprise (IHE) integration profiles which refer to HL 7 standards are adopted within hospitals for message exchange and for the definition of integration scenarios. The IHE patient administration management (PAM) profile with its different workflows is adopted for patient management, whereas the Scheduled Workflow (SWF), the Laboratory Testing Workflow (LTW), and the Ambulatory Testing Workflow (ATW) are adopted for order management. At present, the system manages 4, 700, 000 pharmacological e-prescriptions, and 1, 700, 000 e-prescriptions for laboratory exams per month. It produces, monthly, 490, 000 laboratory <b>medical</b> <b>reports,</b> 180, 000 radiology <b>medical</b> <b>reports,</b> 180, 000 <b>first</b> aid <b>medical</b> <b>reports,</b> and 58, 000 discharge summaries. Hence, despite there being still work in progress, the Lombardy Region healthcare system is a fully interoperable social healthcare system connecting patients, healthcare providers, healthcare organizations, and healthcare professionals in a large and heterogeneous territory through the implementation of international health standards...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Narrative <b>medical</b> <b>reports</b> {{do not use}} {{standardized}} terminology {{and often}} bring insufficient information for statistical processing and medical decision making. Objectives of the paper are to propose a method for measuring diversity in <b>medical</b> <b>reports</b> written in any language, to compare diversities in narrative and structured <b>medical</b> <b>reports</b> and to map attributes and terms to selected classification systems. Methods A new method based on a general concept of f-diversity is proposed for measuring diversity of <b>medical</b> <b>reports</b> in any language. The method is based on categorized attributes recorded in narrative or structured <b>medical</b> <b>reports</b> and on international classification systems. Values of categories are expressed by terms. Using SNOMED CT and ICD 10 we are mapping attributes and terms to predefined codes. We use f-diversities of Gini-Simpson and Number of Categories types to compare diversities of narrative and structured <b>medical</b> <b>reports.</b> The comparison is based on attributes selected from the Minimal Data Model for Cardiology (MDMC). Results We compared diversities of 110 Czech narrative <b>medical</b> <b>reports</b> and 1119 Czech structured <b>medical</b> <b>reports.</b> Selected categorized attributes of MDMC had mostly different numbers of categories and used different terms in narrative and structured reports. We found more than 60 % of MDMC attributes in SNOMED CT. We showed that attributes in narrative <b>medical</b> <b>reports</b> had greater diversity than the same attributes in structured <b>medical</b> <b>reports.</b> Further, we replaced each value of category (term) used for attributes in narrative <b>medical</b> <b>reports</b> by the closest term and the category used in MDMC for structured <b>medical</b> <b>reports.</b> We found that relative Gini-Simpson diversities in structured <b>medical</b> <b>reports</b> were significantly smaller than those in narrative <b>medical</b> <b>reports</b> except the "Allergy" attribute. Conclusions Terminology in narrative <b>medical</b> <b>reports</b> is not standardized. Therefore {{it is nearly impossible}} to map values of attributes (terms) to codes of known classification systems. A high diversity in narrative <b>medical</b> <b>reports</b> terminology leads to more difficult computer processing than in structured <b>medical</b> <b>reports</b> and some information may be lost during this process. Setting a standardized terminology would help healthcare providers to have complete and easily accessible information about patients that would result in better healthcare. </p...|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} of the dissertation thesis has been the information-lexical analysis of Czech <b>medical</b> <b>reports</b> and the usability of international classification systems in the Czech healthcare environment. The analysis of <b>medical</b> <b>reports</b> {{has been based on}} the attributes of the Minimal Data Model for Cardiology (MDMC). Narrative <b>medical</b> <b>reports</b> and structured <b>medical</b> <b>reports</b> from the ADAMEK software application have been used.

40|$|We {{examined}} the effects of odorant inhalation on the sleep–wake states in rats. Odorants used in the experiment were clove, jasmine, lavender, lemon, peppermint, pine, rose, sandalwood, valerian, and ylang-ylang. Valerian and rose inhalation significantly prolonged the pentobarbital-induced sleeping time, whereas lemon inhalation significantly shortened it. The effect of valerian inhalation was markedly noticeable. In the anosmic rats, a significant effect of odorants on the pentobarbital sleep time was not seen. Electroencephalographic studies on natural sleep revealed that rose inhalation did not exert any significant effect on sleep, but a significant shortening in sleep latency and a significant prolonging in total sleep time were observed with valerian inhalation, whereas a significant prolonging in sleep latency was observed with lemon inhalation. Such effects of valerian and lemon inhalation were not admitted in anosmic rats. c-Aminobutyric acid (GABA) transaminase assay indicates that valerian inhalation decreases the activity of the enzyme and enhances GABA activity. Although valerian has been reported to exert a good effect for sleep as a medicine for internal use, the present study is the <b>first</b> <b>medical</b> <b>report</b> suggesting that the inhalation of valerian may enhance the sleep. On the other hand, the present results may suggest the possibility that lemon inhalation may cause a worsening of insomnia symptoms.

Anorexia nervosa is a restrictive eating disorder in which the individual refuses to maintain a normal body weight and focuses on decreasing energy intake, commonly through food avoidance, and increasing energy expenditure, through excessive activity or exercise. The <b>first</b> <b>medical</b> <b>report</b> of AN dates back the seventeenth century; however, AN was not given considerable clinical attention until the twentieth century. The prevalence of AN continues to increase, most significantly among adolescent females. AN now exists as a medically recognized disorder, but no uniform method of treatment {{has been found to be}} successful. This paper will examine the efficacy of yoga as a component of therapy for treatment of anorexia nervosa in female adolescents. To do so, research articles, clinical studies, and literature on eating disorders [...] specifically anorexia nervosa [...] and yoga-including the philosophy and foundations of yoga in addition to the application of yoga practice- were reviewed and analyzed. The application of yoga as therapy for anorexia nervosa has been most widely studied in its effectiveness as a form of mindful-based therapy to treat psychological symptoms, specifically eating-disordered thoughts, of AN. Currently, the evidence of the application of yoga as therapy for AN reports successful results in treatment of the disorder. Future studies providing further evidence of physiological benefits of yoga in treating AN will help to gamer support from the members of the medical community who are directly involved in the treatment of AN patients. Further evidence of the success of the use of yoga in treatment of AN may lead to a widespread application of yoga as a component of therapy for AN and increased success of recovery from the disorder...|$|E
