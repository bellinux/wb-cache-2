25|$|The Soviet Union {{regarded}} chess as {{a symbol}} of Communist superiority, and hence the Soviet chess world was extremely politicized. As Botvinnik was the first world-class player produced by the Soviet Union, everything he said or <b>did</b> (<b>or</b> did not say or do) had political repercussions, and there were rumors that Soviet opponents were given hints that they should not beat him.|$|E
25|$|A {{crisis of}} {{political}} loyalties could disrupt {{the fabric of}} colonial America women's social worlds: whether a man <b>did</b> <b>or</b> did not renounce his allegiance to the King could dissolve ties of class, family, and friendship, isolating women from former connections. A woman's loyalty to her husband, once a private commitment, could become a political act, especially for women in America committed to men who remained loyal to the King. Legal divorce, usually rare, was granted to Patriot women whose husbands supported the King.|$|E
25|$|Reaction to Obama's {{speech was}} swift and {{widespread}} in the United States.

25|$|For example, the Chicago City Railway, also {{designed}} by Eppelsheimer, opened in Chicago in 1882 {{and went on}} to become the largest and most profitable cable car system. As with many cities, the problem in flat Chicago was not one of incline, but of transportation capacity. This caused a different approach to the combination of grip car and trailer. Rather than using a grip car and single trailer, as many cities <b>did,</b> <b>or</b> combining the grip and trailer into a single car, like San Francisco's California Cars, Chicago used grip cars to pull trains of up to three trailers.|$|E

25|$|Soon {{after it}} was {{discovered}} and recognized as the principle of meat smoking, wood-tar creosote became used {{as a replacement for}} the process. Several methods were used to apply the creosote. One was to dip the meat in pyroligneous acid or a water of diluted creosote, as Reichenbach <b>did,</b> <b>or</b> brush it over with them, and within one hour the meat would have the same quality of that of traditionally smoked preparations. Sometimes the creosote was diluted in vinegar rather than water, as vinegar was also used as a preservative. Another was to place the meat in a closed box, and place with it a few drops of creosote in a small bottle. Because of the volatility of the creosote, the atmosphere was filled with a vapour containing it, and it would cover the flesh.|$|E
25|$|No famous surgeon, {{not even}} John Hunter (1728–1793), {{was likely to}} have founded his {{practice}} deeper in science than Paget <b>did,</b> <b>or</b> waited longer for his work {{to come back to}} him. In physiology, he had mastered the chief English, French, German, Dutch and Italian literature of the subject, and by incessant study and microscope work had put himself level with the most advanced knowledge of his time, so that it was said of him by Robert Owen, in 1851, that he had his choice, either to be the first physiologist in Europe, or to have the first surgical practice in London, with a baronetcy. His physiological lectures at St Bartholomew's Hospital were the chief cause of the rise in the fortunes of its school, which in 1843 had gone down to a low point.|$|E
25|$|In Islam, {{there are}} four sources from which Muslim {{scholars}} extract religious law or rulings, and upon which they base their fatwa. The first is the Quran, which is the holy book of Islam, and which Muslims believe is the direct and literal word of God, revealed to Prophet Mohammad. The second source is the Sunnah, which incorporates anything that the Prophet Mohammad said, <b>did</b> <b>or</b> approved of. The third source is the consensus of the scholars, meaning that if the scholars of a previous generation have all agreed on a certain issue, then this consensus is regarded as representing Islam. Finally, if no scripture is found regarding a specific question from the three first sources, then an Islamic scholar performs {{what is known as}} ijtihad. This means that they use their own logic and reasoning {{to come up with the}} best answer according to the best of their ability.|$|E

25|$|Bart Ehrman, Robert Eisenman {{and others}} {{critical}} of traditional Christian views, {{in assessing the}} problems involved in conducting historical Jesus research, say the Gospels are full of discrepancies, were written decades after Jesus' death, by authors who had not witnessed any events in Jesus' life. They go on to say the Gospels were authored not by eyewitnesses who were contemporary with the events that they narrate but rather by {{people who did not}} know Jesus, see anything he <b>did,</b> <b>or</b> hear anything he taught, and that the authors did not even share a language with Jesus. The accounts they produced are not disinterested; they are narratives produced by Christians who actually believed in Jesus, and were not immune from slanting the stories in light of their biases. Ehrman points out that the texts are widely inconsistent, full of discrepancies and contradictions in both details and larger portraits of who Jesus was.|$|E
25|$|The Whalers {{went on to}} {{face the}} Boston Bruins {{in the first round}} of the playoffs. In Game 4, the Whalers were in front of their home crowd with a two games to one series lead and a 5–2 lead in the game {{entering}} the third period. Bruins starting goaltender Reggie Lemelin was struggling throughout the series and was replaced by backup Andy Moog in the third period. At the same time, Peter Sidorkiewicz began struggling in goal for the Whalers, and the Bruins scored four unanswered goals in the third period, winning the game 6–5. Sidorkiewicz struggled for the rest of the series and Moog was spectacular for the Bruins. Without Liut, the Whalers had to either stick with Sidorkiewicz, which they <b>did,</b> <b>or</b> use the unproven rookie, Kay Whitmore, in goal. Goaltending turned out to be one of the big differences in this series and the Bruins won it in seven games. The Bruins went on to dispose of the Canadiens in five games, then sweep the Capitals in the Wales Conference Finals before losing in the Stanley Cup finals to the Edmonton Oilers.|$|E
25|$|On another {{modeling}} shoot, Erica has {{an accident}} and suffers injuries to her back. With the help of Dr. Jonathan Kinder, she becomes addicted to the medication she takes for her injury. Dimitri tries to warn her about Jonathan, but she will not listen, thus putting a strain on their marriage again. While {{under the influence of}} the increasingly higher doses of drugs Jonathan gives her, Erica has sex with him. Her dependence on her supplier grows until she finally has to admit she has an addiction and checks herself into the Betty Ford Center. Once she is out, Erica and Dimitri start finding their way back to each other. This does not sit well with Jonathan. The doctor drugs Erica and tricks Dimitri into thinking they are still sleeping together. After seeing his wife in bed with another man, Dimitri files for divorce and finds comfort with an equally as devastated Maria Santos Grey. Erica has no idea what Jonathan <b>did</b> <b>or</b> why Dimitri is angry with her. Dimitri shuts her out and refuses to explain why he divorced her. Erica does not find out what happened until she and her new friends Janet Green and Skye Chandler (each of whom was wronged by Kinder) corner Jonathan and he confesses. He gets the upper hand on the women and is about to assault Erica when Dimitri comes to her rescue. Jonathan is sent to prison.|$|E

An irate Hamid was replaced by back-up 'keeper Joe Willis, who would carve his name into the team's annals and the hearts of United fans forever. Cooper beat Willis on the spot kick, beat referee Geiger ordered a retake because of encroachment by two Red Bulls players. Willis confidently dove left and blocked Cooper's second attempt. United was forced to play short-handed for a short time, but a reckless tackle against Pontius by the Red Bulls' Rafa Marquez earned a second yellow card and ejection. Shortly before stoppage time, D.C. went ahead, as a deft pass by defender Robbie Russell found Nick DeLeon. who slipped the ball over the sliding New York goalkeeper for {{what seemed to be}} the series winning goal. However, the Red Bulls had an excellent opportunity to force extra-time as they lined up a free kick {{on the edge of the}} penalty area during stoppage time. Despite having one of the greatest players in the history of the sport, Thierry Henry, who was also one of the great set-piece takers, the Red Bulls players decided to let Miller take the kick, and he sent it over the net.
