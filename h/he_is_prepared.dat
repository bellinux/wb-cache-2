25|$|Catherine Ending: In this ending, Vincent has Mutton summon Catherine {{so he can}} ask her to be his wife. In the bad ending, Catherine refuses. In {{the good}} ending, Catherine accepts when Vincent says <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>prepared</b> for what {{he may have to}} sacrifice. The two live {{together}} in Hell despite the objections of Nergal, the King of Hell and Catherine's father. In the true ending, Vincent overthrows Nergal, becoming the King of Hell and ruler of a harem of succubi with Catherine as his queen.|$|E
25|$|Cauchy {{makes some}} general remarks about {{functions}} in Chapter I, Section 1 of his Analyse algébrique (1821). From {{what he says}} there, {{it is clear that}} he normally regards a function as being defined by an analytic expression (if it is explicit) or by an equation or a system of equations (if it is implicit); where he differs from his predecessors is that <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>prepared</b> to consider the possibility that a function may be defined only for a restricted range of the independent variable.|$|E

25|$|In The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church), {{the largest}} Latter Day Saint denomination, the Melchizedek priesthood {{is one of}} two {{governing}} priesthoods, which is typically given {{as a matter of course}} to worthy male members 18 years and older. No exact rule exists about how much time a man must be a member first; he may receive this priesthood as soon as local church leaders feel <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>prepared.</b> Ordination is based on the recipient's age and worthiness and does not require any specific training or aptitude. A candidate for this ordination is interviewed and often counseled to study the 84th, 107th, and 121st sections of the Doctrine and Covenants to begin to understand the oath and covenant of the priesthood, the covenant a person makes with God when he receives the Melchizedek priesthood. The candidate is also usually asked to stand in a gathering of the members of the church to be publicly accepted as being worthy of ordination. For male Latter-day Saints, receiving the Melchizedek priesthood is considered to be a saving ordinance of the gospel.|$|E

500|$|Throughout the Raffles stories patriotism runs as an {{intermittent}} theme—to such {{an extent}} that the writer William Vivian Butler describes him as a [...] "super-patriot". In the course of the short story [...] "A Jubilee Present" [...] Raffles, celebrating Queen Victoria's diamond jubilee, steals a gold cup from the British Museum and sends it to the queen, telling Manders that [...] "we have been ruled over for sixty years by infinitely the finest monarch in the world". In [...] "The Knees of the Gods", Raffles volunteers for service in the Second Boer War, changing his name and hair colour—he jokes to Manders that <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>prepared</b> to [...] "dye for his country"—and he later confesses his true identity to his superiors in order to unmask a spy.|$|E

500|$|The {{second act}} takes place a week later, when the movie's cast are {{attending}} a decadent party at Gloria's house. Wally and Chicky have conspired {{to use the}} phony engagement of Betty and Wally to win Zeffie's approval of the real relationship between Betty and Chicky. They think she will find Wally so unacceptable that Chicky will seem good in comparison. Meanwhile, Gloria also wants to prove Wally is an unfit match for Betty, by seducing him {{to prove that he}} is unfaithful. She lures Wally to her bedroom suite on the pretense of renewing their relationship, without intending to follow through. She plans to tease him until Zeffie finds them there, but <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>prepared</b> for her plan and will not accept any delay; the act ends with him telling her that she must fulfill her [...] "marriage debt" [...] to him.|$|E

Diana suspects that Paul is not being genuine, but Paul insists that he is and describes Rebecca as [...] "collateral damage." [...] Paul believes that sleeping with Diana is the only option {{he has got to}} keep her on side. Dennis added that Paul feels guilty when he takes off his wedding ring and terrible about betraying Rebecca. Badler said that the situation is an [...] "ego thing" [...] for Diana and afterwards she makes it clear that her plans to destroy Paul have not changed. Badler said she enjoyed working with Stefan Dennis and said he is [...] "fantastic" [...] and that she felt comfortable with him. She said [...] "I kind of felt like it was a well-played tennis match – every time you zing him something, he zings it right back. He's right there for you, so I absolutely loved working with him.|$|E

Jim is under the jinx and says nothing, Kelly putting a customer on hold when she is called by Dwight and forgetting to return, Dwight taking notes during the conference, Pam showing the camera the flyer that Michael made up for the conference, and Lee and Gino, the workers at Vance Refrigeration, discarding a joint in the parking lot.|$|E

2500|$|Members of the Rastafari {{movement}} accused Tatchell {{of racism}} and extremism, saying, [...] "He has gone over way over the top. It's simply racist to put Hitler and Sizzla {{in the same bracket}} and just shows how far <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>prepared</b> to go." [...] Tatchell denies equating Sizzla with Hitler.|$|E
2500|$|Cope regrets that he {{has allowed}} Amy to believe that <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>prepared</b> to marry her, having only tried to respond with tact when she pressed him. He has [...] "a {{crushing}} sense of his predicament"(196) and asks her to tell no one. In a letter, Arthur tells Cope he must end the engagement promptly: [...] "This thing can't go on, {{and you know it}} as well as I do. Nip it. Nip it now. Don't think that our intimacy is to end in any such fashion as this, for it isn't..."(197) ...|$|E
2500|$|I {{must confess}} I've still {{yet to be}} {{convinced}} that Cose is ready for test cricket. Last summer he earned his test place, and confirmed it with his century in Melbourne. But since then a question mark has arisen over his dedication to cricket, and also over his ability to play on wickets which are doing a bit. And he is definitely suspect outside his off stump. I'd like to see Gary work harder at his game. He appears to be overweight and I wonder how hard <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>prepared</b> to work at his batting at this stage.|$|E

2500|$|Arlott spoke passionately {{against the}} motion stating that [...] "It is {{political}} commitment and political belief {{that can make}} a man think that his opponent's views are so obnoxious that he will abstain from playing any game with him as a protest against what the other man believes. Any man's political commitment, if it is deep enough, is his very personal philosophy and it governs his whole way of life, it governs his belief, and it certainly governs the people with whom <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>prepared</b> to mix." [...] The motion was duly defeated by 334–160. Despite their opposing positions over the issue, Arlott was drinking with Wooller in the Cambridge Union Bar shortly after the debate had finished.|$|E
2500|$|In {{his next}} column, Sheldrake again {{attacked}} Rose for following [...] "materialism", {{and argued that}} quantum physics had [...] "overturned" [...] materialism, and suggested that [...] "memories {{may turn out to}} depend on morphic resonance rather than memory traces". [...] Philosopher Alan Malachowski of the University of East Anglia, responding to what he called Sheldrake's [...] "latest muddled diatribe", defended materialism, argued that Sheldrake dismissed Rose's explanation with an [...] "absurd rhetorical comparison", asserted that quantum physics was compatible with materialism and argued that [...] "being roughly right about great many things has given [...] the confidence to be far more open minded than <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>prepared</b> to give them credit for".|$|E
2500|$|In {{the third}} innings, the batting team may score quickly {{to set a}} large target to the opposition. This {{scenario}} usually occurs {{on the fourth day}}'s play. [...] The batting captain decides how many overs <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>prepared</b> to allow the opposition to chase his total in their fourth innings. He usually declares his team's innings at a predetermined time on the fourth day so that they can bowl at least 20 overs on that day and 90 overs on the last day. A good number of overs to bowl at the opposition team in the fourth innings is essential because usually on the fourth and fifth days of a Test match conditions are good for bowling (especially slow bowling), with the pitch having experienced a fair degree of wear and tear. Thus, to make the target as difficult as possible, the batting side speeds up the run rate (runs per over) till the captain declares.|$|E
