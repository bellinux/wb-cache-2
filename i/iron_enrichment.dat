The extrapolation of experimental findings to the larger scales required for carbon sequestration by ocean iron fertilization (OIF) leaves many uncertainties, to answer which, longer duration (i. e. months) and larger scale observations (100 to 200 km length-scale) are required.

40|$|International audienceContext: The κ-mechanism {{that drives}} {{pulsations}} in hot subdwarf stars is {{closely linked to}} the action of diffusive processes, including radiative levitation, which modulate the local contents of heavy elements in the stellar envelope. Iron, in particular, is important for its dominant contribution to the Z-bump feature in the envelope opacity, although other iron-peak elements, such as nickel for instance, may also play a significant role. Aims: Our main goal is to evaluate the potential of nonadiabatic asteroseismology for studying diffusive phenomena in these stars. In this exploratory work, we consider iron as a test case to establish the principle of the method. Methods: From model experiments, we explore the behavior of the pulsation engine under assumed local <b>iron</b> <b>enrichments</b> in the Z-bump layers, and we show how this may be related, through the period range of unstable modes, to some observed properties, i. e., the range of periods effectively detected, characterizing hot pulsating subdwarf stars. This connects nonadiabatic physics with observables. Results: We demonstrate that the strength of the pulsation engine is predominently controled by the amount of heavy metals (iron in our experiments) present at the Z-bump location, the chemical composition {{in other parts of the}} star being irrelevant to the process. We also show that this property can be used to probe directly the amount of metals present in this particular region, irrespective of the physical process involved to produce such abundances. In particular, we show that limits on the abundances needed for the onset of pulsations can be estimated. These can even be derived for individual stars based on their observed pulsation period range, as illustrated with two well-studied pulsating sdB stars: PG 1325 + 101 and Feige 48. Conclusions: We conclude by emphasizing the strong potential of nonadiabatic asteroseismology for hot subdwarf stars, which may hold the key for better understanding diffusive and competing mixing processes in stellar envelopes...|$|R
40|$|A {{model for}} the {{formation}} and evolution of the earth's core, which provides an adequate energy source for maintaining the geodynamo, is proposed. A modified inhomogeneous accretion model is proposed which leads to initial <b>iron</b> and refractory <b>enrichment</b> {{at the center of}} the planet. The probable heat source for melting of the core is the decay of Al- 26. The refractory material is emplaced irregularly in the lowermost mantle with uranium and thorium serving as a long-lived heat source. Fluid motions in the core are driven by the differential heating from above and the resulting cyclonic motions may be the source of the geodynamo...|$|R
50|$|A {{coking plant}} was ready in 1986, closing in 1998. Between 1981 and 1986, other units that {{came on board}} were the {{electric}} steel mill, the rolling mill for mid-sized products, the depot for raw materials and the <b>iron</b> ore <b>enrichment</b> facility. A 13 km-long canal was dug, complete with a port for use solely by the works. Its location in the Danube's immediate vicinity allowed for ore to be transported in and finished products out, {{as well as its}} waters {{to be used in the}} technical process. The blast furnace, the steel mill with converters and the rolling mill for heavy products and railway tracks were due to start production soon after the 1989 Revolution and fall of the regime halted work on them. By that year, the works were 90% ready, with $1.8 billion having been spent on them. There were 6,500 employees, their number set to rise to 15,000 once the project was complete. There were plans for producing cast iron, mid-sized products, products for the automobile industry and metal ties, with 30% of output for domestic use and the rest for export.|$|R
