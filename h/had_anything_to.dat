5|$|Gabriel Fauré {{composed}} his Requiem in D minor, Op. 48, between 1887 and 1890. The choral-orchestral {{setting of}} the shortened Catholic Mass for the Dead in Latin is the best-known of his large works. Its focus is on eternal rest and consolation. Fauré's reasons for composing the work are unclear, but {{do not appear to}} have <b>had</b> <b>anything</b> <b>to</b> do with the death of his parents in the mid-1880s. He composed the work in the late 1880s and revised it in the 1890s, finishing it in 1900.|$|E
5|$|While {{proud to}} be the first French World Champion, Prost, annoyed that French journalists were proclaiming it as a win for France, pointed out in {{interviews}} that other than himself, nothing about the car (the MP4/2B) <b>had</b> <b>anything</b> <b>to</b> do with France. The team was British (having been founded by a New Zealander), the tyres were American Goodyears, the TAG-Porsche engine was German, the chassis itself was built by Hercules Aerospace in the USA, and was sponsored by an American tobacco company (Marlboro) and the Saudi Arabian owned company Techniques d'Avant Garde (TAG).|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Todd Packer (David Koechner) {{visits the}} office and announces {{that he wants to}} make amends for his past behavior. He makes rude remarks masked as apologies and hands out store-bought cupcakes. Pam Halpert (Jenna Fischer) argues that they should not eat the cupcakes, to spite Packer. She remains adamant on this point even after Packer leaves, but once Pam goes home the {{remaining}} employees eat the cupcakes. Packer reveals to the documentary crew that he spiked the cupcakes with drugs, supposedly as revenge for getting him fired (though none of the employees present save Nellie <b>had</b> <b>anything</b> <b>to</b> do with his being fired). He then visits Jim Halpert (John Krasinski) and Darryl Philbin (Craig Robinson) at Athlead in Philadelphia, pulling the same trick on them. In the morning, Pam returns to {{the office and}} announces she is going to eat her cupcake, only to find everyone else reeling from the aftereffects of Packer's deed.|$|E

5|$|With hostility towards reform growing, {{the poor}} results, and Kosygin's reformist stance, {{led to a}} popular {{backlash}} against him. Kosygin lost most of the privileges he had enjoyed before the reform, but Brezhnev {{was never able to}} remove him from the office of Chairman of the Council of Ministers, despite his weakened position. In the aftermath of his failed reform, Kosygin spent {{the rest of his life}} improving the economic administration through the modification of targets; he implemented various programmes to improve food security and ensure the future intensification of production. There is no proof to back up the claim that the reform itself contributed to the high growth seen in the late-1960s, and that its cancellation <b>had</b> <b>anything</b> <b>to</b> do with the stagnating growth of the economy which began in the 1970s.|$|E
5|$|Halotus, as the Emperor's {{official}} taster, {{would probably}} have {{had a role in}} the plot, deceiving Claudius into believing the food was safe to consume. He is a prime suspect because he would have had access to everything eaten by the Emperor on the night of his death. It has been suggested that Halotus may have been the murderer but was working under orders of Agrippina. While it is uncertain whether Halotus would have <b>had</b> <b>anything</b> <b>to</b> gain from the death of the Emperor, Agrippina's political and personal advantage gained by the death of her husband was evident; with Claudius dead, Nero, Agrippina's biological son, would be able to claim the throne. It was also known that the animosity between Agrippina and Claudius had grown during the months preceding the homicide. Other notable suspects included Locusta, a professional poisoner, and Xenophon, Claudius' royal physician, who, in line with the suggestion that the poison was not immediately fatal, is said to have carried an ailing Claudius out of the banquet, taken him to his room and forced a poisoned feather into his mouth on the pretence of encouraging him to regurgitate. Others say Xenophon used poisoned gruel.|$|E
25|$|Lesbian {{separatism}} {{became popular}} in the 1970s as some lesbians doubted whether mainstream society or even the LGBT movement <b>had</b> <b>anything</b> <b>to</b> offer them.|$|E

"But since then," [...] he gravely interposed, anticipating what I {{meant to}} say, [...] "I have {{reflected}} that your <b>having</b> <b>anything</b> <b>to</b> ask me, and my <b>having</b> <b>anything</b> <b>to</b> tell you, are different considerations, Esther.

25|$|Goode never rode in the Hummer, and is {{not known}} to have <b>had</b> <b>anything</b> <b>to</b> do with it, but he was widely portrayed as having both owned and {{operated}} the vehicle. He was lampooned on The Daily Show for the story.|$|E
25|$|On November 16, 2012, United States {{federal judge}} John Gleeson {{sentenced him to}} life imprisonment. When asked if he <b>had</b> <b>anything</b> <b>to</b> say, Medunjanin responded by reciting several verses from the Quran before {{launching}} into a critique of US foreign policy.|$|E
25|$|In {{retaliation}} for the attack, {{a few days later}} Frémont's party massacred a village of Klamath people along the Williamson River in the Klamath Lake massacre. The entire village was razed and at least 14 men, women and children were killed. There was no evidence that the village in question <b>had</b> <b>anything</b> <b>to</b> do with the previous attack.|$|E

25|$|The {{three goals}} of his {{movement}} were anti-foreignism, anti-imperialism, and anti-religion. Bai led the anti-religious movement, against superstition. Huang Shaoxiong, also a Kuomintang {{member of the}} New Guangxi Clique, supported Bai's campaign, and Huang was a non-Muslim, the anti religious campaign was agreed upon by all Guangxi Kuomintang members, so it may have not <b>had</b> <b>anything</b> <b>to</b> do with Bai's beliefs.|$|E
25|$|In 1961, Carlos Fonseca {{looked back}} to the {{historical}} figure of Sandino, and along with two other people (one of whom {{was believed to be}} Casimiro Sotelo, who was later assassinated), founded the Sandinista National Liberation Front (FSLN). After the 1972 earthquake and Somoza's apparent corruption, the ranks of the Sandinistas were flooded with young disaffected Nicaraguans who no longer <b>had</b> <b>anything</b> <b>to</b> lose.|$|E
25|$|During her {{badminton}} career, Gutta {{began dating}} fellow badminton player Chetan Anand. The couple married on 17 July 2005 and got divorced on 29 June 2011. The divorce gathered huge and unwanted media attention and speculations about {{an affair with}} ex-cricketer Mohammad Azharuddin also came up, but was never confirmed {{due to lack of}} any proof of the news and constant denials from Jwala herself. Jwala confirmed filing the divorce but denied that it <b>had</b> <b>anything</b> <b>to</b> do with Azharuddin.|$|E

25|$|The Dalai Lama {{denied that}} his {{government}} <b>had</b> <b>anything</b> <b>to</b> {{do with the}} Olympic protests {{and said that he}} did not advocate a boycott of the games. He called on demonstrators to refrain from any violence, and gave interviews clarifying that his goals were not currently to seek independence from China. The Dalai Lama threatened to resign over TPUM disobedience to the official policy of non-violence and genuine Tibetan autonomy. In the end, international pressure finally led PRC representatives to renew unofficial talks with their Dharmsala counterparts.|$|E
25|$|By December 16, Gacy was {{becoming}} affable with the surveillance detectives, regularly {{inviting them to}} join him for meals in various restaurants and occasionally for drinks in bars or his home. He repeatedly denied that he <b>had</b> <b>anything</b> <b>to</b> do with Piest's disappearance and accused the officers of harassing {{him because of his}} political connections or because of his use of recreational drugs. Knowing these officers were unlikely to arrest him on anything trivial, he openly taunted them by flouting traffic laws and succeeded in losing his pursuers on more than one occasion.|$|E
25|$|Bagri {{would later}} state before his later trial {{that he knew}} was {{probably}} a suspect by October 1985 but insisted he would have faced charges {{if there were any}} evidence he <b>had</b> <b>anything</b> <b>to</b> do with the bombing. It was established by November that it was a man with a Sikh name who probably checked the bag in Vancouver that caused the crash. Parmar was not seen in Canada sometime after late 1986, as authorities believed him to be living in Pakistan where he continued operations against India.|$|E

25|$|My {{grandfather}} Thorgny {{could well}} remember the Uppsala king Eirik Eymundson, {{and used to}} say of him {{that when he was}} in his best years he went out every summer on expeditions to different countries, and conquered for himself Finland, Kirjalaland, Courland, Esthonia, and the eastern countries all around; and at the present day the earth-bulwarks, ramparts, and other great works which he made are to be seen. And, more over, he was not so proud that he would not listen to people who <b>had</b> <b>anything</b> <b>to</b> say to him.|$|E
25|$|Wittgenstein and Hitler {{were born}} just six days apart, though Hitler had to re-sit his {{mathematics}} exam before being allowed into a higher class, while Wittgenstein was moved forward by one, so {{they ended up}} two grades apart at the Realschule. Monk estimates they were both at the school during the 1904–1905 school year, but {{says there is no}} evidence they <b>had</b> <b>anything</b> <b>to</b> do with each other. Several commentators have argued that a school photograph of Hitler may show Wittgenstein in the lower left corner, but Hamann says the photograph stems from 1900 or 1901, before Wittgenstein's time.|$|E
25|$|Francis of Assisi {{was born}} in late 1181 or early 1182, one of several {{children}} of Pietro di Bernardone, a prosperous silk merchant, and his wife Pica de Bourlemont, about whom little is known except {{that she was a}} noblewoman originally from Provence. Pietro was in France on business when Francis {{was born in}} Assisi, and Pica had him baptized as Giovanni. Upon his return to Assisi, Pietro took to calling his son Francesco ("the Frenchman"), possibly in honor of his commercial success and enthusiasm for all things French. Since the child was renamed in infancy, the change can hardly have <b>had</b> <b>anything</b> <b>to</b> do with his aptitude for learning French, as some have thought.|$|E
