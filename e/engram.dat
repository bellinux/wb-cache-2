5|$|The New York Giants are a National Football League (NFL) {{franchise}} {{founded in}} the 1925 season, the NFL's sixth. Eleven years later, the league introduced the NFL draft after team owners voted on it in 1935. The intention of the draft {{was to make the}} NFL more competitive, as a few stronger teams, including the Giants, had an advantage in signing young players because they were able to offer higher salaries and an opportunity to compete for championships. Since that first draft, the Giants have selected 74 players in the first round. The team's first-round pick in the inaugural NFL draft was Art Lewis, a tackle from Ohio University; he was the 9th overall selection. In the most recent draft, held in 2017, the Giants chose Mississippi tight end Evan <b>Engram.</b>|$|E
25|$|Despite his racism, Lashley {{has done}} some {{important}} work in neuropsychology and influenced his students to reach even greater heights. His works and theories that follow are summarized in his book Brain Mechanisms and Intelligence. Lashley's theory of the <b>Engram</b> was the driving force {{for much of his}} research. An <b>engram</b> was believed {{to be a part of}} the brain where a specific memory was stored. He continued to use the training/ablation method that Franz had taught him. He would train a rat to learn a maze and then use systematic lesions and removed sections of cortical tissue to see if the rat forgot what it had learned.|$|E
40|$|A left-handed patient {{suddenly}} {{developed a}} right hemiparesis, mirror-reading, and mirror-writing. Although he could discriminate {{between right and}} left on himself, he demonstrated right/left spatial disorientation. We propose that his right/left spatial disorientation was induced by a scanning defect. It has been demonstrated that mirror-image <b>engrams</b> are normally available. We believe that {{a reversal of the}} learned left-to-right scanning process with the availability of mirror <b>engrams</b> induced mirror-reading. Similarly, reversal of the normal left-to-right writing pattern, with the availability of mirror <b>engrams,</b> induced mirror-writing...|$|R
40|$|Nervous systems use {{excitatory}} cell assemblies {{to encode}} and represent sensory percepts. Similarly, synaptically connected cell assemblies or "engrams" {{are thought to}} represent memories of past experience. Multiple lines of recent evidence indicate that brain systems create and use inhibitory replicas of excitatory representations for important cognitive functions. Such matched "inhibitory engrams" can form through homeostatic potentiation of inhibition onto postsynaptic cells that show increased levels of excitation. Inhibitory <b>engrams</b> can reduce behavioral responses to familiar stimuli, thereby resulting in behavioral habituation. In addition, by preventing inappropriate activation of excitatory memory <b>engrams,</b> inhibitory <b>engrams</b> can make memories quiescent, stored in a latent form that is available for context-relevant activation. In neural networks with balanced excitatory and inhibitory <b>engrams,</b> the release of innate responses and recall of associative memories can occur through focused disinhibition. Understanding mechanisms that regulate the formation and expression of inhibitory <b>engrams</b> in vivo may help not only to explain key features of cognition but also to provide insight into transdiagnostic traits associated with psychiatric conditions such as autism, schizophrenia, and posttraumatic stress disorder...|$|R
50|$|The {{existence}} of <b>engrams</b> is posited by some scientific theories {{to explain the}} persistence of memory and how memories are stored in the brain.

25|$|This {{draft is}} {{considered}} one of the best draft classes ever for the position of wide receiver. Keyshawn Johnson, Terry Glenn, Eddie Kennison, Marvin Harrison, Eric Moulds, Bobby <b>Engram,</b> Terrell Owens, Muhsin Muhammad, Amani Toomer, Jermaine Lewis, and Joe Horn have all achieved success in the pros, with all except Kennison, <b>Engram,</b> and Toomer having reached the Pro Bowl at least once, and a total of 26 Pro Bowl appearances for the group. In addition to the class having had several successful receivers, none of the five wide receivers drafted in the first round have been busts, as all of them spent at least a reasonable amount of time as starters in the NFL. Combined, 1996 wide receivers (through the end of the 2006 season) have totalled 7,646 receptions for 105,866 yards, eclipsing any other class by more than 1,000 receptions and 10,000 yards.|$|E

25|$|Penn State overcame a {{sluggish}} first half {{to preserve their}} perfect record over the Hoosiers with a 34–7 victory. The Nittany Lions overcame three Daryll Clark turnovers, who threw for 240 yards and two touchdowns. Receiver Deon Butler had five receptions for 56 yards and a touchdown, becoming Penn State's career receptions leader with 172, passing Bobby <b>Engram</b> (167). Derrick Williams accumulated 164 all-purpose yards, the second-highest total of his career. Williams ran for a career-high 61 yards on four carries, including a career-long 36-yard touchdown run in the fourth quarter. His 39-yard touchdown catch was his longest career reception.|$|E
50|$|In Scientology, an auditor uses an E-meter (a {{galvanic}} skin response detector) {{to locate}} <b>engrams</b> in the parishioner which are then erased, using Dianetics. Scientology promotes such treatments to clear <b>engrams</b> believed to limit the individual's spiritual ability, to halt the decline of his spiritual awareness, and to increase his survival potential.|$|R
5000|$|Scientology {{presents}} {{two major}} {{divisions of the}} mind. The reactive mind is thought to record all pain and emotional trauma, while the analytical mind is a rational mechanism that serves consciousness. The reactive mind stores mental images which are not readily available to the analytical (conscious) mind; these {{are referred to as}} <b>engrams.</b> <b>Engrams</b> are painful and debilitating; as they accumulate, people move further away from their true identity. To avoid this fate is Scientology's basic goal. Some <b>engrams</b> are taught by Hubbard to happen by accident while others are inflicted by “thetans who have gone bad and want power,” as described by the Los Angeles Times. These <b>engrams</b> are named Implants in the doctrine of Scientology. Hubbard said, “Implants result in all varieties of illness, apathy, degradation, neurosis and insanity and are the principal cause of these in man.” ...|$|R
50|$|Semon argued {{not only}} that {{information}} is encoded into memory {{and that there are}} 'memory traces' (<b>engrams)</b> or after-effects of stimulation that conserve the changes in the nervous system, he also contended that these changes in the brain (that is, <b>engrams)</b> are inherited. Semon's mneme-theory fell into disrepute largely because in a Lamarckian fashion it proposed that memory units are passed from one generation to another.|$|R
25|$|Injuries {{plagued the}} team from the very outset, with {{receivers}} Deion Branch and Bobby <b>Engram</b> both missing the first three games and Nate Burleson suffering a season-ending knee injury in the first game, a 34-10 loss to the Buffalo Bills. Quarterback Matt Hasselbeck was also hounded by a back injury, which forced him off the field {{for a total of}} nine games, contributing to a six-game losing streak {{during the second half of}} the season. Although the Seahawks won two of their last three games, including a 13-3 victory over the New York Jets in Holmgren's last home game at Qwest Field, the team would finish third in the NFC West and end up with a record of 4-12, the worst the franchise had seen since 1992.|$|E
25|$|Derrick Williams was {{a multidimensional}} threat: taking several direct snaps from {{a variant of}} the Wildcat formation, rushing for 53 yards and a {{touchdown}} on twelve carries, and completing his first career pass (23 yards to tight end Mickey Shuler). Running back Evan Royster picked up 90 yards and a touchdown on a career-high twenty-six carries, becoming the 12th Nittany Lion to rush for 1,000 yards in a season. Receiver Deon Butler had three catches, moving him into a tie with Bobby <b>Engram</b> for the career receptions leader at Penn State (167). Kevin Kelly set the Big Ten record for career field goals with his 24-yarder in the first quarter, topping Mike Nugent's previous record of 72. Kelly has kicked field goals in a school-record 30 consecutive games.|$|E
25|$|Seattle went three-and-out {{on their}} next drive, and Chatman {{returned}} Rouen's punt 21 {{yards to the}} Seahawks 49-yard line. Favre once again led the Packers on another long scoring drive, moving the ball 49 yards in 12 plays and consuming 6:51 off the clock. Green finished the drive with another 1-yard touchdown run, and Longwell's extra point gave the Packers a 27–20 lead with 2:39 left in regulation. But Hasslbeck responded by completing three of five passes for 59 yards, including a 34-yard pass to <b>Engram,</b> {{on the way to}} Alexander's third 1-yard touchdown run to tie the game. Favre's 27-yard completion to Walker on the Packers ensuing drive gave them a chance to win, but Longwell missed a 47-yard field goal attempt on the last play of regulation, and it went into overtime.|$|E
50|$|Spock {{questions}} Daystrom on {{his computer}} design. Daystrom reveals that he has programmed human <b>engrams</b> into M-5. Pressed further, Daystrom admits the <b>engrams</b> he used were his own, meaning M-5 thinks similarly to Daystrom himself. Displaying increased stress and anger, Daystrom appears unstable. M-5 now shows similar instability. An attempt by the Enterprise crew to isolate M-5 from the ship fails, as they are duped by a decoy.|$|R
40|$|Investigations and {{theories}} concerning interrelationships of motoric experiences, perceptual-motor skills, and learning are reviewed, {{with emphasis on}} early <b>engramming</b> of form and space concepts. Covered are studies on haptic perception of form, the matching of perceptual data and motor information, Kephart's perceptual-mctor theory, and supportiag data for this theory from phsiological investigations. Such supporting data includes research {{on the concept of}} motor <b>engrams,</b> defined in physiological terms as a structural change in the nervous system effected by an experience. For visually handicapped children, the concept of motoric <b>engrams</b> is seen as an essential learning modality for motor orientation and spatial perception. Four motor generalizations significant in the education of blind children are delineated: balance and posture, contact, locomotion, and receipt and propulsion, Concluded is the importance of establishing spatial orientation intrinsically through gross motor movements in early childhood (gross motor <b>engramming</b> as a learning modality for interacting with one's environment). All children are seen to need gross motoric engrains as foundations for spatial-perceptual development, vith the blind urgently needing motoric environmental interaction as a readiness base for mobi_ity.

25|$|The {{ability to}} learn rules is {{dependent}} on nonsynaptic plasticity. One study sought to teach rats to discriminate between various odors, and it took several days {{to teach them to}} distinguish between a first pair of smells. However, after learning this, the rat was able to learn to distinguish between different odors much faster. Changes in excitability of the pyramidal neurons in these rats were observed for three days after training. These changes faded eventually, suggesting that the neurons were involved in learning the rules, not in storing memory. Daoudal and Debanne attempted to determine if the same learning rules and induction mechanisms defined for synaptic plasticity also applied to nonsynaptic plasticity affecting ion channels. They determined that nonsynaptic and synaptic plasticity share common learning rules and induction pathways, e.g., NMDA receptor dependent long-term potentiation (LTP) and long-term depression (LTD). They also showed that nonsynaptic and synaptic plasticity synergistically form a coherent <b>engram</b> to store memory traces.|$|E
25|$|After {{forcing a}} punt, the Seahawks scored on their opening drive, with Hasselbeck {{completing}} two passes to Koren Robinson for 25 yards and Shaun Alexander rushing for 22 {{on the way}} to a 30-yard field goal by Josh Brown. In the second quarter, Tom Rouen's 38-yard punt gave the Packers the ball at midfield. Green Bay quarterback Brett Favre then completed a 29-yard pass to fullback William Henderson to set up a 31-yard field goal from Ryan Longwell. Seattle struck back with a 51-yard drive, featuring a 28-yard reception by Bobby <b>Engram,</b> and scored another Brown field goal to retake the lead. But on the first play of the Packers ensuing drive, Favre completed a 44-yard pass to Javon Walker. Then after a 13-yard run from Ahman Green, Favre threw a 23-yard touchdown pass to tight end Bubba Franks. Seattle was forced to punt from their own 7 on their next drive, and receiver Antonio Chatman returned the ball six yards to the Seahawks 39-yard line. Two plays later, Favre's 23-yard completion to Donald Driver set up Longwell's 27-yard field goal with 41 seconds left in the half, giving the Packers a 13–6 lead.|$|E

60|$|The {{argument}} from {{the connection of}} brain-lesions with loss of memory is not so strong as it looks, though it has also, some weight. What {{we know is that}} memory, and mnemic phenomena generally, can be disturbed or destroyed by changes in the brain. This certainly proves that the brain plays an essential part in the causation of memory, but does not prove that a certain state of the brain is, by itself, a sufficient condition for the existence of memory. Yet it is this last that has to be proved. The theory of the <b>engram,</b> or any similar theory, has to maintain that, given a body and brain in a suitable state, a man will have a certain memory, without the need of any further conditions. What is known, however, is only that he will not have memories if his body and brain are not in a suitable state. That is to say, the appropriate state of body and brain is proved to be necessary for memory, but not to be sufficient. So far, therefore, as our definite knowledge goes, memory may require for its causation a past occurrence as well as a certain present state of the brain.|$|E
