5|$|Summer Glau as River Tam– smuggled {{onto the}} ship by her brother. She {{is a highly}} intelligent, {{compassionate}} and intuitive child prodigy. Experiments and invasive brain surgery at an Alliance secret facility left her delusional, paranoid, and at times violent, though her uncanny ability to seemingly sense things before they happen leaves questions as to where the delusions end and reality begins for her. The experiments seemed to <b>have</b> <b>made</b> <b>her</b> a psychic. The experiments also gave her a seemingly innate ability in hand-to-hand combat, and she is capable of killing or incapacitating several opponents with ease. She gets frequent fits of anxiety and experiences post-traumatic flashbacks of her time in the Alliance facility. Her mental instability and uncanny abilities, paired with several erratic and violent acts, are a recurring source of fear and doubt among the crew, especially with Jayne, whom she once slashed with a knife. Jayne very frequently requests that River and Simon {{be taken off the}} ship.|$|E
5|$|Liechtenstein won {{its first}} Olympic medals: two bronzes by Willi Frommelt and Hanni Wenzel in the alpine skiing slalom events. East German athletes {{achieved}} gold medal sweeps in luge and bobsleigh, {{which accounted for}} five of the country's seven Olympic titles. Alpine skier Rosi Mittermaier won the women's downhill and slalom events to give West Germany's two gold medals in these Games. She came close to winning a third in the giant slalom, which would <b>have</b> <b>made</b> <b>her</b> {{the first woman to}} win all three Olympic alpine skiing events. Cross-country skier Helena Takalo contributed three of Finland's seven medals by reaching podium place finishes in all of the women's events. Two Dutch speed skaters were responsible for five of their country's six medals: Piet Kleine won the men's 10,000 metres and came second in the 5,000 metres, while Hans van Helden secured bronze medals in the same events and also in the 1,500 metres. Before these Games, Great Britain's last Winter Olympic medal had been a gold at the 1964 Games, also held in Innsbruck. Twelve years later in the same city, the British team won again a single gold medal, this time by figure skater John Curry in the men's singles with a still-standing record total score. The two bronze medals won by Swedish athletes were not enough to prevent this team's performance from becoming the weakest ever in the nation's Winter Olympic history.|$|E

25|$|Leonora Christina's fate, and {{especially}} her memoir, <b>have</b> <b>made</b> <b>her</b> a national cultural heroine in Scandinavia. She {{has sometimes been}} portrayed as of saintly stature, both poets and prelates hailing her as the ideal Danish woman: loyal, patient, resolute, and resourceful. Kristian Zahrtmann (1843-1917) has memorialized her story {{in a series of}} 18 monumental paintings, the first of which was shown in 1871. These were published as illustrations to her book in an 1890 edition, and released as individual prints in a 1907 edition.|$|E
25|$|Atia of the Julii is a {{character}} from the HBO/BBC/RAI original television series Rome, played by Polly Walker from 2005 to 2007. The niece of Julius Caesar and mother of Octavian/Augustus and Octavia, she is depicted as a cheerfully amoral and opportunistic manipulator whose family connections and sexual liaisons <b>have</b> <b>made</b> <b>her</b> a highly influential figure in Roman society. Atia is loosely based on the historical figure Atia Balba Caesonia. Rome Historical Consultant Jonathan Stamp {{has said that the}} character was based on more well-known Roman women of the period, like Clodia.|$|E

She was renamed Trepang on 24 September 1942, and her keel was laid down on 25 June 1943. She was launched on 23 March 1944 sponsored by Mrs. R. M. Davenport, {{the wife of the}} submarine's prospective commanding officer, and commissioned on 22 May 1944 with Commander Roy Milton Davenport—already a three-time Navy Cross winner—in command.|$|E
25|$|This {{incident}} {{was a sign}} of Elizabeth's strong and distinctive personality. This difficult experience seems to <b>have</b> <b>made</b> <b>her,</b> {{for the first time in}} her young life, fully aware of the serious, even deadly, nature of her succession rights to the throne. When she made her first public appearance at court 18 months later, just turning 17, she dressed in a simple, somber manner with plain and unadorned hair. This contrasted sharply with the showy splendor of the other ladies present, as if she was trying to live down the scandal of her association with Thomas.|$|E
25|$|Voigt {{has made}} a number of {{recordings}} which include two solo compact discs. She is on the live recording of the Vienna State Opera's production of Wagner's Tristan und Isolde for Deutsche Grammophon (2003). In a 2001 interview with Associated Press, however, Voigt expressed that she was unlucky with recording because of unexpected cancellations and postponements. The opportunities of cooperation with high profile musicians could <b>have</b> <b>made</b> <b>her</b> a major prima donna more quickly. She had a chance to work with Italian tenor Luciano Pavarotti in a televised production of Verdi's La forza del destino in 1997. However, the performance did not take place since Pavarotti had not learned the role of Alvaro and another opera was substituted. Later the same year, Voigt was cast to sing for a new recording of Tristan und Isolde under the direction of Sir Georg Solti. Before it proceeded, Solti suddenly died of a heart attack.|$|E

25|$|After this, Lind rejoined George Edwardes's {{management}} to star at Daly's Theatre {{in a series}} of hit musicals: A Gaiety Girl (1894, as Alma Somerset), Go-Bang (1894, as Di Dalrymple), An Artist's Model (1895, as Daisy Vane), The Geisha (1896, as Molly Seamore), and A Greek Slave (1898, as Iris). Lind received excellent reviews for her roles in these musicals, emphasising the grace of her dancing, her comic acting, her enunciation and her abilities at mimicry and imitation. Lind continued to appear at benefits, including ones for Edmund Payne and Nellie Farren, and in her own music hall shows, singing her repertoire from her famous roles. She sang in the music halls for only a few months. In 1899, Lind is believed to <b>have</b> <b>made</b> <b>her</b> only appearance at the Palace Theatre, London, in a programme celebrating Charles Morton's 80th birthday. That same year, she again performed the princess in the pantomime Puss in Boots, this time at the Garrick Theatre.|$|E
25|$|For {{the second}} half of the season, Rebecca Mader was cast as the major villain, Zelena, The Wicked Witch of the West. Alexandra Metz was cast as Rapunzel, who will be rescued by Prince Charming. Rose McGowan will return as a young Cora for the season's eighteenth episode, while the {{introduction}} of a young King Leopold as a Prince played by Eric Lange, and the return of Princess Eva (played by Eva Bourne) will also be featured. Charles Mesure was cast as Blackbeard in January 2014, to appear in one episode as an enemy of Captain Hook. In February 2014, a casting call was opened for an actress in her mid to late twenties to recur as Glinda the Good Witch, who is described as elegant, warm and benevolent, as well as wise, clever and shrewd. However, years of isolation <b>have</b> <b>made</b> <b>her</b> lonely and cautious — though at her core, she is a steadfastly filled with optimism. It was later announced that Sunny Mabrey was cast as the character.|$|E

25|$|In 1616, Samuel More accused {{his wife}} of {{adultery}} and, {{at the direction of}} his father, Richard, devised a plan to rid himself of Katherine and the children. The adultery was supposedly committed with Jacob Blakeway, a young man near in age to Katherine who lived close by and whose family had been More tenants for several generations. In 1608, Jacob Blakeway and his father Edward, a yeoman had renewed a lease on a parcel of land owned by Katherine More's father, Jasper More of Larden Hall. The manor of Larden Hall was about half a mile from Brockton where the Blakeway family lived. By a deed dated 20 April 1616, Samuel cut the entail on the Larden estate to prevent any of the children from inheriting. During the long court battle, Samuel would deny that he was the father of the children borne by his wife, Katherine, and stated them to be children of the adulterous relationship. Katherine did not deny her relationship with Jacob Blakeway, stating there was a former betrothal contract with him, and therefore he was her true husband. This would <b>have</b> <b>made</b> <b>her</b> marriage to Samuel invalid. Samuel quotes her words in his declaration, though she could not sufficiently prove by witnesses yet it was all one before god as she sayed. At that time any of the usual witnesses would have been dead.|$|E
25|$|The {{second season}} had {{fourteen}} roles receiving star billing, out of whom eleven {{were part of}} the first season's main cast. The season sees the promotion of three former guest stars, who begin acting as series regulars from the season's first episode. The series is narrated by Brenda Strong, {{from the point of view}} of the deceased Mary Alice Young, as she observes, from a unique perspective, the lives of the Wisteria Lane residents and her former best friends. Susan Mayer, portrayed by Teri Hatcher, is divorcée and single mother, who, in her continuous search for a romantic commitment, ends up in bed with her former husband. Felicity Huffman portrayed Lynette Scavo, who starts neglecting her responsibilities as a mother, after the realization of her undeniable talent for advertising results in her going back to work after a six-year absence. Marcia Cross portrayed Bree Van de Kamp, whose flawless life is shaken after she starts dealing with the aftermath of her husband's death, while trying to overcome her guilt for having dated the man who killed him. Former model Gabrielle Solis, portrayed by Eva Longoria, who suffers a miscarriage just as she starts accepting upcoming motherhood. Nicollette Sheridan portrayed Edie Britt, whose commitment issues and numerous one night stands <b>have</b> <b>made</b> <b>her</b> an iconic character. Ricardo Antonio Chavira played Gabrielle's husband, Carlos Solis, who has to cope with the revelation of his wife's affair with their gardener, while trying to get out of jail. Mark Moses continues his role of widower Paul Young, who tries to cover up the murder of his adoptive son's biological mother. Zach Young, portrayed by Cody Kasch, finally learns about his true identity, but refuses to be a part of his father's life, whereas Julie Mayer, Susan's daughter portrayed by Andrea Bowen, deals with her parents' unexpected reconciliation. James Denton portrayed Mike Delfino, who has to deal with both his break-up with Susan Mayer, and his recently discovered biological son. Previously a recurring character throughout the last episodes of the previous season, Betty Applewhite, portrayed by Alfre Woodard, was conceived as a new resident of Wisteria Lane, whose mysterious arc is the season's main storyline. Also promoted from guest stars to series regulars were Doug Savant and Richard Burgi, who portrayed Tom Scavo and Karl Mayer, respectively.|$|E
