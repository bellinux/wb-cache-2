40|$|Illicit <b>drug</b> <b>traffic</b> is {{a serious}} problem in many {{countries}} because of its tremendous adverse social, economic and political impacts. Illicit <b>drug</b> <b>traffic</b> is international in nature. A drug illicitly produced in one country often ends up in another country, changing hands many times in different countries. This international nature of illicit <b>drug</b> <b>traffic</b> warrants effective and concerted international action to fight it. Since the harms of drug abuse and the problems of illicit <b>drug</b> <b>traffic</b> {{came to the attention of}} the international community in the early part of this century, efforts have been exerted to establish and improve an international legal framework to provide principles and guidelines for effective national and international action in the control of drugs and the fight against illicit <b>drug</b> <b>traffic.</b> Several multilateral <b>drug</b> treaties have been concluded to that end. Since these treaties are not self-executing, they must be fully implemented by national Governments to produce the desired effects. This study examines Australia's implementation of the multilateral drug treaties to which it is a Party. The focus will be placed on three aspects, which are: extradition of illicit drug related offenders; mutual legal assistance in the fight against the traffic; and other forms of international cooperation. Current trends in worldwide illicit <b>drug</b> <b>traffic</b> having impacts on Australia are also briefly discussed to indicate directions for Australia's future action in the fight against illicit <b>drug</b> <b>traffic...</b>|$|R

5|$|Hugo Spadafora was a {{physician}} and political activist who had first clashed with Noriega {{when they were both}} members of Torrijo's government.

Spadafora amassed evidence of corruption within the government by using his position as an ally of Torrijos to question Noriega's allies, including Rodriquez and Carlton. This included a lengthy conversation with Carlton in mid-1985 after his drug operations had collapsed due to conflicts over a missing shipment, and he had received negative publicity in the Panamanian press.

The <b>drug</b> <b>trafficking</b> charges threatened Noriega's support among his own constituency of middle class individuals who had benefited under his and Torrijos' government.|$|E
