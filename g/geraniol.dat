25|$|Genetic {{engineering}} algae {{has been}} used to increase lipid production or growth rates. Current research in genetic engineering includes either the introduction or removal of enzymes. In 2007 Oswald et al. introduced a monoterpene synthase from sweet basil into Saccharomyces cerevisiae, a strain of yeast. This particular monoterpene synthase causes the de novo synthesis of large amounts of <b>geraniol,</b> while also secreting it into the medium. <b>Geraniol</b> is a primary component in rose oil, palmarosa oil, and citronella oil as well as essential oils, making it a viable source of triacylglycerides for biodiesel production.|$|E
25|$|The Monotropoideae are {{adapted for}} {{pollination}} by bumble bees (Bombus), including specialized buzz pollination {{in a few}} genera. In some genera (such as Monotropa), some degree of self-pollination has been observed in addition to bumble bee pollination. Hummingbirds have also been observed visiting Sarcodes, though it is also primarily bumble bee-pollinated. Several floral scent compounds of Monotropastrum humile, linalool, α-terpineol, and <b>geraniol,</b> have been demonstrated to be bumble bee attractants.|$|E

2500|$|Unlike other vinous spirits, {{nomenclature}} singani is {{made only}} from the alexandria varietal and is single batch, never blended. [...] Because of singani producers’ methods learned over centuries, the extreme climate at high altitude, the mountain soil and other factors of terroir, singani has a distinct flavor profile. [...] The profile is achieved without barrel aging, much like tequila. [...] The coded regulatory organoleptic properties of singani are, aspect: clear, clean, brilliant; [...] color: colorless; [...] aroma: terpenol profile of alexandria muscat predominates (primarily <b>geraniol,</b> linalool, and nerol); [...] taste (mouthfeel): fine, soft, smooth, with balanced structure.|$|E
2500|$|Despite {{the vast}} {{diversity}} in the Muscat family, one common trait {{that can be seen}} in most all Muscat members is the characteristic floral, [...] "grapey" [...] aroma note that is caused by the high concentration of monoterpenes in the grapes. More than 40 different monoterpenes have been discovered in Muscat grapes (as well as in other aromatic varieties like Riesling and Gewürztraminer); these include citronellol, <b>geraniol,</b> linalool and nerol. This characteristic [...] "musk" [...] aroma can be best observed in light bodied, low alcohol wines such as Moscato Asti which have not had their bouquet heavily influenced by other winemaking techniques like oak aging, autolysis with yeast, malolactic fermentation or fortification.|$|E
2500|$|The biosynthetic {{pathway to}} {{paclitaxel}} {{has been investigated}} and consists of approximately 20 enzymatic steps. The complete scheme is still unavailable. The segments that are known {{are very different from}} the synthetic pathways tried thus far (Scheme 1). The starting compound is geranylgeranyl diphosphate 2 [...] which is a dimer of <b>geraniol</b> 1. [...] This compound already contains all the required 20 carbon atoms for the paclitaxel skeleton. More ring closing through intermediate 3 (taxadiene) leads to taxusin 4. The two main reasons why this type of synthesis is not feasible in the laboratory is that nature does a much better job controlling stereochemistry and a much better job activating a hydrocarbon skeleton with oxygen substituents for which cytochrome P450 is responsible in some of the oxygenations. Intermediate 5 is called 10-deacetylbaccatin III.|$|E
2500|$|Like most Muscat varieties, Muscat of Alexandria {{is notable}} {{for being a}} {{desirable}} raisin and table grape. This {{is due in part}} to the grape's high tolerance of heat and drought conditions. While it is used in wine production (most notably on the island of Pantelleria between Sicily and Tunisia, where it makes a passito style dessert wine under the name of [...] "Zibibbo"), the grape lags far behind the reputation of Muscat blanc à Petits Grains. This is partly because Muscat of Alexandria is very vigorous and prone to produce high yields that can be easily overcropped as well as a more assertive aroma profile due to a higher concentration of the monoterpene <b>geraniol,</b> which produces a geranium scent, and lower concentration of nerol which a more fresh, sweet rose aroma.|$|E
2500|$|Other {{than being}} grown for their beauty, {{species such as}} P.graveolens are {{important}} in the perfume industry and are cultivated and distilled for their scents. Although scented pelargoniums exist which have smells of citrus, mint, pine, spices or various fruits, the varieties with rose scents are most commercially important. Pelargonium distillates and absolutes, commonly known as [...] "scented geranium oil" [...] are sometimes used to supplement or adulterate expensive rose oils. The oils of the scented pelargoniums contain citronellol, <b>geraniol,</b> eugenol, alpha pinene and many other compounds. The edible leaves and flowers are also used as a flavouring in desserts, cakes, jellies and teas. Scented-leafed pelargoniums {{can be used to}} flavor jellies, cakes, butters, ice cream, iced tea and other dishes, The rose-, lemon- and peppermint-scents are most commonly used. Also used are those with hints of peach, cinnamon and orange. Commonly used lemon-scented culinary species include P.crispum and P.citronellum. Rose-scenteds include P.graveolens and members of the P.graveolens cultivar group. Other species and cultivars with culinary use include the lime-scented P.‘Lime’, the lemon balm-scented P.‘Lemon Balm’, the strawberry-lemon-scented P.‘Lady Scarborough’ and the peppermint-scented P.tomentosum.|$|E

5000|$|Harpagoside is {{characterized}} as an iridoid glycoside, {{which is a}} product of the mevalonate pathway present in the metabolism of eukaryotes, archaea and some bacteria. The iridane skeleton found in iridoids is monoterpenoid in origin and contains a cyclopentane ring fused to a six-membered oxygen heterocycle. The iridoid system arises from <b>geraniol,</b> which itself is synthesized from geranyl pyrophosphate (GPP) by <b>geraniol</b> diphosphate synthase (E1). A p450 type enzyme, <b>geraniol</b> 10-hydroxylase (E2), then hydroxylates <b>geraniol</b> at the 10 position to form 10-hydroxygeraniol. The diol then undergoes two oxidation steps catalyzed by 10-hydroxygeraniol oxidoreductase (E3) to form the dialdehyde,10-oxogernial. NADPH catalyzed monoterpene cyclase (E4) then forms three possible irododial isomers. Instead of further oxidation to the iridotrial, which is the branchpoint precursor to secologanin and downstream alkaloids, the keto form equilibrates into a hemiacetal and isomerizes to form 8-epi-iridodial. Carboxylation followed by glycosylation leads to the glycoside. Subsequent decarboxylation and three p450-type oxidations leads to harpagide. Cinnamoyl esterification at the 3-hydroxyl position leads to the natural product harpagoside.|$|E

50|$|Potassium sorbate is {{effective}} {{for the control}} of fungal growth, including yeast, especially for sweet wines in bottle.
