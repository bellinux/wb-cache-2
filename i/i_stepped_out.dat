500|$|On October 2, detectives put Bundy in {{a lineup}} before DaRonch, who {{immediately}} {{identified him as}} [...] "Officer Roseland". Witnesses from Bountiful picked him from the same lineup as the stranger lurking about the high school auditorium. There was insufficient evidence linking him to Debra Kent (whose body was never found), but {{more than enough to}} charge him with aggravated kidnapping and attempted criminal assault in the DaRonch case. He was freed on $15,000 bail, paid by his parents, and spent most of the time between indictment and trial in Seattle, living in Kloepfer's house. Seattle police had insufficient evidence to charge him in the Pacific Northwest murders, but kept him under close surveillance. [...] "When Ted and <b>I</b> <b>stepped</b> <b>out</b> on the porch to go somewhere," [...] Kloepfer wrote, [...] "so many unmarked police cars started up that it sounded like the beginning of the Indy 500." ...|$|E

In the copy of Gone with the Wind that Johnny gave him before dying, Ponyboy finds a note from Johnny {{describing}} how he will die proudly after saving the kids from the fire. Johnny also urges Ponyboy to [...] "stay gold". Ponyboy decides to write his English assignment about the recent events, and begins his essay with the opening line of the novel: [...] "When <b>I</b> <b>stepped</b> <b>out</b> into the bright sunlight from {{the darkness of the}} movie house, I had only two things on my mind: Paul Newman and a ride home..." ...|$|E
2500|$|For a {{long time}} before it was formalised, it had been known by doctors and {{midwives}} that mouth to mouth resuscitation could be useful in bringing a lifeless newborn around. In 1946, during the middle of a polio outbreak, an anesthesiologist, James Elam, applied this principle to an older child in an emergency situation. Elam described the event in his own words as [...] "I was browsing around to get acquainted with the ward when along the corridor came a gurney racing - a nurse pulling it and two orderlies pushing it, and the kid on it was blue. [...] I went into total reflex behaviour. [...] <b>I</b> <b>stepped</b> <b>out</b> {{in the middle of the}} corridor, stopped the gurney, grabbed the sheet, wiped the copious mucous off his mouth and face, … sealed my lips around his nose and inflated his lungs. [...] In four breaths he was pink." ...|$|E

2500|$|In France, Bunin found himself, for {{the first}} time, {{at the center of}} public attention. On 10 November 1933, the Paris {{newspapers}} came out with huge headlines: [...] "Bunin— the Nobel Prize laureate" [...] giving the whole of the Russian community in France cause for celebration. [...] "You see, up until then we, émigrés, felt like we were at the bottom there. Then all of a sudden our writer received an internationally acclaimed prize! And not for some political scribblings, but for real prose! After having been asked to write a first page column for the Paris Revival newspaper, <b>I</b> <b>stepped</b> <b>out</b> {{in the middle of the}} night onto the Place d'Italie and toured the local bistros on my way home, drinking in each and every one of them to the health of Ivan Bunin!" [...] fellow Russian writer Boris Zaitsev wrote. Back in the USSR the reaction was negative: Bunin's triumph was explained there as [...] "an imperialist intrigue." ...|$|E

60|$|I {{disengaged}} {{myself from}} Sally, who was clinging to my hands, and <b>I</b> <b>stepped</b> forward <b>out</b> of the corner. Steele had been running. Why did he hold his coat like that? I sensed action, {{and the cold}} thrill animated me.|$|R
