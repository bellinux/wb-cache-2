Experimental research has shown that on ridge functions, hierarchically organised strategies can significantly outperform strategies that rely on mutative selfadaptation. This paper presents a first theoretical analysis of the behaviour of a hierarchically organised evolution strategy. Quantitative results are derived for the parabolic ridge that describe the dependence on the length of the <b>isolation</b> <b>periods</b> of the mutation strength and the progress rate. The issue of choosing an appropriate length of the <b>isolation</b> <b>periods</b> is discussed and comparisons with recent results for cumulative step length adaptation are drawn...|$|R
40|$|Liquid {{storage tanks}} are {{critical}} components of industrial facilities since damage to such structures may cause spreading of hazardous material and environmental pollution. Tanks exhibit mainly two different seismic behaviors {{one of which}} is the long period movements due to sloshing of the liquid and the other is the impulsive vibrations generated {{as a result of the}} fluid structure interaction phenomena at higher frequencies. The overall base shear is the combination of these two loads. The seismic base isolation aims to control the impulsive load as it has appreciable amount of contribution to the base shear values. Among various types, the curved surface sliding bearings (FPS) are commonly used in liquid tanks since provide <b>isolation</b> <b>periods</b> which is independent of the tank weight (liquid height). In this paper a parametric analysis has been performed to investigate the efficiency of FPS bearings. The numerical model is based on the Haroun and Housner's simplified lumped parameter model in which the sloshing and fluid-tank interactions are modeled by convective and impulsive masses, respectively. The effectiveness of the isolation system was investigated under a series of ground motions, <b>isolation</b> <b>periods</b> and tank aspect (slenderness) ratios. Results indicated that depending on the characteristics of the ground motion, the response of the isolated tank can be reduced in appreciable amounts as compared to the conventionally constructed one. On the other hand, some detrimental effects were also observed in lower <b>isolation</b> <b>periods</b> (Tb= 2 s) particularly in medium slender tanks under near fault ground motions. This undesirable situation was avoided by using higher <b>isolation</b> <b>periods</b> (Tb = 3 s) without much affecting the bearing displacements...|$|R

5000|$|Wrestlers use mats {{which are}} {{abrasive}} {{and the potential}} for a true contagion (Latin contagion-, contagio, from contingere to have contact with) is very real. The herpes simplex virus, type I, is very infectious and large outbreaks have been documented. A major epidemic threatened the 2007 Minnesota high school wrestling season, but was largely contained by instituting an eight-day <b>isolation</b> <b>period</b> during which time competition was suspended.

40|$|Bidirectional power {{converters}} {{are considered to}} be key elements in interfacing the low voltage dc microgrid with an ac grid. However to date there has been no clear procedure to determine the maximum permissible fault <b>isolation</b> <b>periods</b> of the power converter components against the dc faults. To tackle this problem, this paper presents an electro-thermal analysis of the main elements of a converter: ac inductors, dc capacitors and semiconductors. In doing this, the paper provides a methodology for quantifying fault protection requirements for power converter components in future dc microgrids. The analysis is performed through simulations during normal and fault conditions of a low voltage dc microgrid. The paper develops dynamic electro-thermal models of components based on the design and detailed specification from manufacturer datasheets. The simulations show the impact of different protection system operating speeds on the required converter rating for the studied conditions. This is then translated into actual cost of converter equipment. In this manner, the results can be used to determine the required fault protection operating requirements, coordinated with cost penalties for uprating the converter components...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{examines}} the rocking response {{and stability of}} rigid blocks standing free on an isolated base supported: (a) on linear viscoelastic bearings, (b) on single concave and (c) on double concave spherical sliding bearings. The investigation concludes that seismic isolation is beneficial to improve the stability only of small blocks. This happens because while seismic isolation increase the ‘static’ value of the minimum overturning acceleration, this value remains nearly constant as we move to larger blocks or higher frequency pulses; therefore, seismic isolation removes appreciably from the dynamics of rocking blocks the beneficial property of increasing stability as their size increases or as the excitation pulse period decreases. This remarkable result suggests that free- standing ancient classical columns exhibit superior stability as they are built (standing free on a rigid foundation) rather than if they were seismically isolated even with isolation system with long <b>isolation</b> <b>periods.</b> The study further confirms this finding by examining the seismic response of the columns from the peristyle of two ancient Greek temples when subjected to historic record...|$|R

During the initial operation, Burger contracted a hospital bug, which resulted in bacterial meningitis. At one stage during the <b>isolation</b> <b>period,</b> Burger's condition became so serious that there were genuine fears for his life. After his situation had improved, he then had to endure a series of operations to remove the cyst completely. In total, Burger would spend six weeks in hospital and a further eight weeks recovering indoors. Burger resumed training at the end of July, but was reluctant to set a definite return date:To give a timeline is quite difficult... I certainly don't want to over-commit.

40|$|The {{evolution}} of influenza A virus {{is linked to}} a non-fixed evolutionary landscape driven by tight co-evolutionary interactions between hosts and influenza strains. Herd-immunity, cross-immunity and age-structure are among the factors shown to support the coexistence of multiple strain oscillations. In this study, we incorporate two influenza strains and allow for levels of cross-immunity supported by previous studies. Three specific pairs of strain interactions are considered. Some of the strain definitions can be extended to n interacting strains if strains are properly defined. This framework allows for a biologically interpretable approach since appropriate levels of cross-immunity as suggested by each strain definition can be applied. We show that strong cross-immunity along with reasonable <b>periods</b> of host <b>isolation</b> lead to periodic epidemic outbreaks (sustained oscillations). We establish the system's stability {{in the absence of}} infection via the basic reproductive number (Ro). The presence of two boundary endemic equilibria is found analytically. For <b>isolation</b> <b>periods</b> and cross-immunity levels pertaining to the influenza virus, our system supports the existence of sustained oscillations.

In Experiment 1, postpartum female rats given 1 hour of maternal experience were infused following the experience with either a high or low dose of an OT antagonist into the NA shell and tested for maternal behavior after a 10 -day pup <b>isolation</b> <b>period.</b> Females receiving a high dose of the antagonist showed a significantly longer latency to exhibit full maternal behavior after the pup <b>isolation</b> <b>period</b> compared to females that received vehicle or a high dose of antagonist in a control region. In Experiment 2, postpartum female rats were infused with either a high or low dose of OT into the NA shell after a 15 -minute maternal experience and tested for maternal behavior after a 10 -day pup <b>isolation</b> <b>period.</b> There {{were no significant differences}} between the females infused with OT and females treated with a vehicle infused into the NA shell or with OT infused into the control region. One possible reason for a lack of facilitation is a floor effect, since females in the control groups displayed a rapid maternal response after the pup <b>isolation</b> <b>period.</b> These findings suggest that OT receptors, likely in combination with other neurotransmitters, in the NA shell play a role in the consolidation of maternal memory.

First, encounters between familiar opponents are influenced by the outcome of the familiarization fight for about 2 weeks. Second, the level of aggression and the outcome of an encounter are affected over different time frames. Third, individuals that are isolated before an encounter can be disadvantaged.
