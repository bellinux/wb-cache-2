50|$|Prior to the {{creation}} of PPA, port administration in the Philippines was merged with the traditional function of revenue collection of the Bureau of Customs (BOC). Port and harbor maintenance was the responsibility of the Bureau of Public Works (BPW). In the early 1970s, there were already 591 natiot planning, development, operations and regulation at the national level. Around this time, the Bureau of Customs had proposed to the Reorganization Committee and to Congress {{the creation}} of a separate government agency to integrate the functions of port operations, cargo handling and port development and maintenance to enable the Bureau to concentrate on tax and customs duties collection. Moreover, manage the country's ports. Hence, the Philippine Ports Authority was created under Presidential Decree No. 505 which was subsequently amended by P.D. No. 857 in December 1975. The latter decree broadened the scope and functions of the PPA to facilitate the implementation of an integrated program for the planning, development, <b>financing,</b> <b>operation</b> and maintenance of ports or port districts for the entire country. In 1978, the charter was further amended by Executive Order No. 513 the salient features of which were the granting of police authority to the PPA, the creation of a National Ports Advisory Council (NPAC) to strengthen cooperation {{between the government and the}} private sector, and the empowering of the Authority to exact reasonable administrative fines for specific violations of its rules and regulations. By virtue of its charter, the PPA was attached to what was then the Department of Public Works and Highways's responsibility. The executive order also granted PPA financial autonomy.|$|E

40|$|China is top FDI {{destination}} for Korean Textile firms. This paper, using survey data for 41 Korean textile firms invested in China, measured their performance and analysed its determinants. Regression {{results show that}} localization of the business management, level of wages, the investment-to-employee ratio, ratio of raw materials sourced from Korea, and export ratio of the parent company have positive relations with the firm's performance. On the contrary, domestic sales (i. e. sales within China) ratio is not significantly related with the performance. This survey also reveals some difficulties which Korean-invested textile firms in China usually face in the operation stages of investment. The biggest trouble is the rapid rise of production cost, and many firms feel growing competition from local competitors and have difficulties with entering local market. They also suffer from lack of skilled workers and high ratio of labor turnover. Besides, they have trouble <b>financing</b> <b>operation</b> funds in China. Meanwhile, {{according to the survey}} result, the ratio of local procurement of raw materials continues to rise rapidly, being expected to amount 77 percent within the next few years. This indicates that the export induction effect of FDI would be in a sharp decline, possibly resulting in enlargement of Korean textile industry's trade deficit with China...|$|E

40|$|Banks in {{developing}} countries are too much liquidity, result of the poor sectoral allocation of resources, caused by their inefficiency {{in the production of}} information and in the management of risk. The economies of developing countries are, also, in a context of financial repression where the rates are capped at low levels paying evil savings and do not favor the formation of capital. The great importance of liquidity at the strict sense M 1 in the monetary mass (80 % according to Goldsmith, 1969) in the economies of developing countries and the lack of substitutability between physical capital and financial capital established by McKinnon (1973) brings him to advocate for these economies the principle of money as a relay to capital. The alternative posed by Islamic banks, effective in the production of information (Alim B., 2011) and in the risk management (Khan M., 1986; Alim B., 2011) favorable to a better sectoral policy, faced to a peculiar asymmetric risk upstream of the <b>financing</b> <b>operation.</b> The purpose of the study is to show that this risk, mainly financial, has such effect to reduce or even eliminate the utility of depositors and may constitute a barrier to the principle of money as a relay to capital. If Islamic banking is recommendable because adapted to the financing of emerging economies, it should be defined for this system the management mechanisms of this type of risk with evident impact...|$|E
30|$|Actually, {{different}} {{models have been}} developed to implement PPP projects in the field of transportation engineering. Based on the involvement of the private sector and risk allocation between the public and private sector, the models can be classified into 12 types and grouped further into 4 categories, including operations and maintenance, concession (public ownership of the facilities), concession (private ownership of the facilities) and full privatization (Percoco 2014). The private sector can get involved in a transport PPP project at different phases such as the very beginning of design, construction, <b>financing,</b> <b>operation</b> or maintenance, even through the whole project lifecycle. Some PPP models such as Build-Operate-Transfer (BOT) and Build-Own-Operate (BOO) focus on the construction quality of the transport projects. The Sines Container Terminal in Portugal and the Valencia Cruise Terminal in Spain were constructed under this sort of PPP model (Roumboutsos et al. 2013). Some models such as operating concession tend to involve the private sector during the operation phase aiming to improve the service quality. Many PPP projects in the area of public urban transportation like the Line 4 Subway project in Beijing are representatives of this sort (De Jong et al. 2010). Besides, some models such as full/partial privatization or design-build-finance-operate (DBFO) are adopted {{as a result of the}} lack of public finance in order to provide transport service in an earlier stage. The M 6 Tollway in the UK implemented using the DBFO is one example of this sort (U.S. Department of Transportation 2007). Therefore, various PPP models have been extensively applied in the construction of transport infrastructure. But the strategy, which infrastructure should adopt PPP model, remains an unresolved problem.|$|E
40|$|The {{concept of}} {{profit and loss}} sharing (PLS) is the main idea for Islamic banking and <b>{{financing}}</b> <b>operation.</b> PLS-based financing is the most recommended tool {{to be used in}} structuring the Islamic banks’ credit instrument. The Shari’ah validity of PLS-based financing is accepted by all scholars and researchers. However, the utilization of this concept within the Islamic banks’ financial operation is very limited. Islamic banks prefer to use non-PLS based financing (trade and lease based) due to the fixed and guaranteed return. PLS-based financing is less preferable to the Islamic banks, because uncertain return in PLS-based financing causes high credit risk. This argument contradicts with the theory of PLS which claims that PLS-based financing is able to minimize the credit risk and improve the bank’s performance. The theory of PLS has not been empirically justified in the earlier studies, rather there are some general discussion on the credit risk of Islamic financing. In order to fulfill the gap between theory and practice of Islamic banks, this thesis aims to investigate the issue of credit risk in Islamic banks. By considering the PLS-based financing as Islamic bank’s Shari’ah credit instrument, three issues are raised in this thesis. First, the credit risk associated with Islamic banks’ credit instruments. Second, the relationship between Shari’ah credit instrument and credit risk. Third, the impact of Shari’ah credit instrument on the performance of Islamic bank. To empirically justify the raised issues, this research has selected 40 Islamic banks from 12 different countries. The variance-covariance of Value-at-Risk (VaR) technique has been used to examine the credit risk associated with the credit instruments of Islamic banks. The result indicates that Islamic banks face more bad debt loss in the non-PLS based financing. It also shows that Islamic banks face more credit risk in the non-PLS credit instrument. Furthermore, the Generalized Method of Moments (GMM) is employed to investigate the effect of Shari’ah credit instrument on the credit risk and performance of Islamic banks. The result shows that Shari’ah credit instrument is negatively related with Islamic banks’ credit risk and positively related with the performance. The findings of this research offer several policy implications. The results have pointed out the capability of PLS based financing in minimizing credit risk and improving performance of Islamic banks. The findings are consistent with the theory of PLS which requires labor, risk and skills for the financing activities and helps to reduce the credit risk and improve the performance of financial institutions. The result of this research {{can be used as a}} reference for the Islamic banks to adopt PLS based financing instead of non-PLS based financing in order to gain both financial benefits and satisfaction of Allah SWT...|$|E
