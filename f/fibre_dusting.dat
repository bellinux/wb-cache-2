40|$|For {{many years}} it has been {{accepted}} that fibre dimensions {{are the most important}} factor in the development of asbestos related disease with long fibres being more dangerous than short for all types of asbestos. This information has been derived from in vitro experiments and injection or implantation experiments since the kilogramme quantities of specially prepared dusts that are necessary for long term inhalation have not been available. The present study has taken advantage of the availability of a sample of amosite produced so that almost all fibres were less than 5 micron in length. The effects of this dust were compared to dust prepared from raw amosite that contained a very high proportion of long fibres. Previous data from studies with UICC amosite, which was intermediate in length, were also available for comparison. At the end of 12 months of dust inhalation, significantly more short fibre amosite was present in the lung tissue compared to the long but while the long <b>fibre</b> <b>dust</b> caused the development of widespread pulmonary fibrosis, no fibrosis at all was found in animals treated with short fibre. One third of animals treated with long <b>fibre</b> <b>dust</b> developed pulmonary tumours or mesotheliomas but no pulmonary neoplasms were found in animals treated with short <b>fibre</b> <b>dust.</b> Following intraperitoneal injection, the long fibre amosite produced mesotheliomas in 95 % of animals with a mean induction period of approximately 500 days. With short <b>fibre</b> <b>dust,</b> only a single mesothelioma developed after 837 days. In previous inhalation studies with UICC amosite, relatively little pulmonary fibrosis had developed and only two benign pulmonary tumours. This would suggest that to produce a significant carcinogenic response in rat lung tissue amosite fibres must be longer than those in the UICC preparation. Following the injection of UICC amosite, however, mesotheliomas developed in the same proportion of animals and with the same mean induction period as with long <b>fibre</b> <b>dust.</b> From this it would appear that while very short fibres exhibit little carcinogenicity to either lung or mesothelial tissues, mesotheliomas can be produced by dust preparations consisting of shorter fibres than are needed to produce tumours...|$|R
50|$|A further method {{exists for}} the {{determination}} of asbestos, fibreglass, synthetic mineral fibre and ceramic mineral <b>fibre</b> <b>dust</b> in air. This is the membrane filter method (MFM) and requires {{the collection of the}} dust on a grided filter for estimation of exposure by the counting of 'conforming' fibres in 100 fields through a microscope.

40|$|Measurements {{were made}} of the {{asbestos}} <b>fibre</b> and <b>dust</b> content of samples from 96 surgically excised lungs; 42 necropsies on patients with lung cancer, 11 necropsies on patients with non-pulmonary malignancies, and 59 necropsies on patients without any malignant disease. The patients' ages ranged from 45 to 74 years {{at the time of}} study. None of the patients had asbestosis.

The present data suggest that asbestos fibre counts below 100, 000 per gram of dried lung are not related to specific asbestos disease, although in the surgical cases who were closely questioned on their residential and occupational histories most of those with fibre counts above 30, 000 per gram dried lung had had occasions of definite or very likely asbestos exposure...|$|R

Except for one untreated group and 3 vehicle control groups, the animals were injected intraperitoneally (i. p.) once or repeatedly with dust suspensions and then examined, after lifetime observation up to 30 months, for tumours in the abdominal cavity. 1 granular dust (silicon carbide), 2 asbestos dusts (crocidolite, tremolite) and 11 vitreous <b>fibre</b> <b>dust</b> samples were administered. 5 of the vitreous fibre types were fine fibre fractions from 4 commercial insulation wools and 1 experimental wool, the others were prepared by milling glass microfibres, which have, per se, a small diameter range. The dosage per rat differed {{over a wide range}} in accordance with experience from earlier studies. The lowest dose was 0. 04 x 10 (9) crocidolite fibres in 0. 5 mg dust, and the highest amounted to 20 x 10 (9) glass fibres in 1000 mg divided into 40 weekly injections. Two mesotheliomas were found in a total of 395 rats treated with saline or granular silicon carbide (250 or 1000 mg). Eleven <b>fibre</b> <b>dusts</b> produced dose-dependent mesotheliomas at rates of up to 97 %, but the calculated fibre number > 5 micrometers in length required for inducing a 25 % tumour risk differed between the fibre samples tested in the relation of 1 to about 1000. UICC-like crocidolite heads the ranking order; the glass fibre B- 01, which possesses a low durability in the body, ends it together with a rather thin sample of glass fibre type B- 09.

40|$|A {{series of}} mineral dusts were {{injected}} into the pleural cavities of mice {{in order to test}} their relative fibrogenicity. It was found that long <b>fibre</b> <b>dust</b> specimens produced widespread cellular granulomata which formed firm adhesions between the lungs, diaphragm and chest wall. These granulomata were gradually replaced by fibrous tissue and in old animals the dust was often found embedded in masses of acellular collagen. When the same mineral samples were more finely ground and sieved so that no long fibres remained in the dust, the resulting granulomata were much smaller and did not form adhesions. The small granulomata did, however, fibrose eventually and the dust was embedded in small nodules of collagen. Non-fibrous mineral rocks when finely ground and sieved also produced small non-adherent granulomata. The actual size of these granulomata depended on the number of cells attracted to the dust and this did vary with the different samples tested. The final degree of fibrosis within the granulomata was very closely correlated with the initial cellularity of the lesions. Those that were very cellular produced considerable amounts of collagen while little was produced if the initial granulomata had contained few cells...|$|R

In August 1957, Turner's revealed that they were dumping 15,000lb (6.8 tonnes) of asbestos dust recovered from ventilation filters alone each week.

In this study of airway disease among workers exposed to asbestos and man made mineral fibres, 215 of 246 construction insulators 50 years old or less and currently working in the Montreal area were examined. Spirometry was completed successfully in 214 workers without known asbestosis and 207 underwent methacholine bronchoprovocation testing. Airway responsiveness was expressed as PC 15, the concentration of methacholine causing a 15 % fall in the forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV 1). Exposure to asbestos and synthetic mineral <b>fibre</b> <b>dust</b> was estimated from the total hours of work in the trade since first employment. After the effect of age, height, and pack years of smoking had been taken into account, no relation was found between hours of work and any indices obtained from the forced expiratory manoeuvre (FEV 1 /FVC, MMF). After the effect of airway calibre (FEV 1 /FVC), age, and pack years of cigarette consumption had been taken into account, airway responsiveness decreased as the total hours of work in the trade increased. These findings suggest that workers with greater levels of airway responsiveness are more sensitive to exposure in a dusty workplace and in consequence are less likely to continue.

METHODS: Forced vital capacity (FVC), forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV 1), forced expiratory ratio (FEV 1 /FVC x 100), forced expiratory flow (FEF), forced mid expiratory flow (FMF), peak expiratory flow (PEF), and respiratory symptoms (cough, phlegm, breathlessness, wheezing, and nasal symptoms) were recorded in 145 non-smoking workers (77 male, 68 female) exposed to wood dust in a furniture factory in Umtata, Republic of Transkei, and 152 non-smoking control subjects (77 male, 75 female) from a bottling factory with a clean environment. RESULTS: After adjustment for age and standing height the forced expiratory indices were significantly lower in the exposed male workers than in the control subjects. FEF and PEF in the exposed men were 81. 3 % and 89. 4 % of predicted values and were lower than other indices. FVC in exposed men showed a significant inverse correlation with exposure (expressed in {{number of years of}} employment). The FVC was reduced by 26 ml per year of employment. The proportion of men with an FEV 1 /FVC below 70 was higher in exposed workers than in control subjects and higher in the exposed workers with more years of employment.

To enhance the usage of abundant agrowaste generated in Malaysia a study was conducted in view of exploring the possibility of utilizing it effectively for the conversion to fermentable sugars. Agrowaste is rich of lignoselulolytic material which can serve as good substrate in solid state fermentation to produce the fermentable sugar. In this study, solid state fermentation was carried out through the flask system in lab skill. We evaluated the production of fermentable sugars by various fungal cultures namely A. niger USM AI 1, A. niger II, Trichoderma sp., A. niger F 4 and Phanerochaete chrysosporium via solid state fermentation system. Nine different types of lignocellulolytic materials paddy husks, coconut <b>fibre,</b> wood <b>dust,</b> coconut meal, palm kernel cake, sugarcane baggase, tapioca meal, oil palm trunk and oil palm frond were examined. The highest productivity, 57 mg of fermentable sugars per gram substrate was obtained when A. niger USM AI 1 was grown on tapioca meal and the biomass of fungus showed about 1. 7 mg glucosamine/g substrate. However, about 30. 0 mg of fermentable sugars per gram of substrate was obtained when A. niger USM AI 1 was grown on oil palm frond and the biomass of fungus showed 1. 2 mg glucosamine/g substrate.

Whether occupational exposure to other agents, such as inorganic dust or chemicals, also increases the risk for infectious pneumonia is not clear. The aim {{of the present study was}} to elucidate whether occupational exposure to respiratory pollutants and irritants increases the risk for infectious pneumonia. Design Prospective cohort study. Setting Swedish male construction workers. Participants 320 143 male construction workers exposed to inorganic dust (asbestos, man-made mineral <b>fibres,</b> <b>dust</b> from cement, concrete and quartz), wood dust, metal fumes and chemicals (organic solvents, diisocyanates and epoxi resins) or unexposed. Main outcome measures The cohort was followed from 1971 to 2003 and the main outcome measures were mortality to infectious pneumonia, lobar pneumonia or pneumococcal pneumonia. RRs were obtained by the person-years method and from Poisson regression models, adjusting for baseline values of age and smoking habits. Results Among men aged 20 e 64 years there was increased mortality from infectious pneumonias among construction workers exposed to metal fumes (RR 2. 31, 95 % CI 1. 35 to 3. 95), inorganic dust (RR 1. 87, 95 % CI 1. 22 to 2. 87) and chemicals (RR 1. 91, 95 % CI 1. 37 to 3. 22). The mortality was also increased from both lobar pneumonia and pneumococcal pneumonia. Among men aged 65 e 84 years the occupational exposure to inorganic dust and chemicals was associated with slightly increased mortality from infectious pneumonia. Among groups with mutually exclusive exposures there was increased mortality from infectious pneumonias among construction workers exposed to inorganic dust, but not among those exposed to wood dust or chemicals. There were no cases among workers exposed only to metal fumes. Conclusions Our findings indicate that exposure to inorganic dust increases the mortality from infectious pneumonias, especially lobar pneumonia and pneumococcal pneumonia.

Textile <b>dust</b> <b>fibre,</b> a waste generated from textile mechanical recycling has the prospect to be utilised as secondary raw material for producing novel material: textile paper suitable for packaging and other applications. A comparative Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) of carrier bags made from one ton of virgin paper, recycled paper and novel textile paper (~ 22584 paper bags with grammage of 100 g/m 2 and same dimensions for all 3 types of bags) showed that textile paper bag is more environmentally friendly in terms of carbon footprint. The largest environmental contributors were energy consumed in the pulping and paper making processes, followed by the use of adhesives and printing ink in the conversion process of paper to papercarrier bags. A comparative Techno-economic Assessment (TEA) was carried out for the operating cost of producing the three selected carrier bag types. The analysis conveyed that textile paper bags are more economically attractive, mainly due to the partial substitution of paper fibre with low-cost textile <b>dust</b> <b>fibre.</b> Furthermore, a simple tool was developed with an attempt to assess and compare materials suitability for the circular economy considering life cycle thinking and business perspectives. Assessment of textile paper using the Circular material assessment tool indicated that there is still scope for improvement on the following circularity characteristics of circular material: scarcity of raw material, local supply of resources, clean and non-toxic resources.

For 73 jobs and for each pollutant the amount and frequency of exposure were assessed on a four-level scale by different time periods. The JEM shows 73 % sensitivity and 83 % specificity. Although exposure assessment was semi-quantitative, the JEM allows computing of individual cumulative exposure score for each pollutant across time. Despite the predominant natural uranium compounds exposure, the amount of exposure to other pollutants such as TCE and other chlorinated products, asbestos, and fibres, is important at the plant.

Lung function was assessed by measuring forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV 1) and forced vital capacity (FVC). Exposure to cotton dust was measured in the work area and personal breathing zones, and retrospective exposure to cotton dust over a working life was estimated with accurate work history and best available hygiene data. RESULTS [...] 3. 5 % of all operatives had byssinosis, 55 (5. 3 %) chronic bronchitis, 36 (3. 5 %) work related persistent cough, 55 (5. 3 %) non-byssinotic work related chest tightness, and 56 (5. 3 %) work related wheeze. A total of 212 static work area dust samples (range 0. 04 - 3. 23 mg/m 3) and 213 personal breathing zone samples (range 0. 14 - 24. 95 mg/m 3) were collected. Percentage of predicted FEV 1 was reduced in current smokers (mean 89. 5, 95 % confidence interval (95 % CI) 88 - 91) in comparison with non-smokers (93. 1, 90. 5 - 94. 1) and FVC was reduced in operatives currently working with man made fibre (95. 3, 93. 8 - 96. 9) in comparison with cotton (97. 8, 96. 6 - 99. 0). Regression analysis identified smoking (P < 0. 01), increasing age (P < 0. 01), increasing time worked in the waste room (P < 0. 01), and male sex (P < 0. 05) as being associated with a lower FEV 1 and FVC. Current and retrospective cotton dust exposures did not appear as predictor variables in the regression analysis although in a univariate analysis, FEV 1 was reduced in those operatives exposed to high dust concentrations assessed by personal and work area sampling. DISCUSSION [...] This study has documented loss of lung function in association with exposure to cotton dust. Those operatives with work related symptoms had significantly lower FEV 1 and FVC than asymptomatic workers. Although lung function seemed {{to be affected by}} high dust exposures when operatives were stratified into high and low exposure groups, regression analysis did not identify current dust concentrations as an independent factor influencing loss. Smoking habit was found to explain most of the measured change in FEV 1 and FVC. It is likely that smoking and dust exposure interact to cause loss of lung function in cotton textile workers...|$|R
40|$|A {{study was}} carried out in order to {{investigate}} the indoor exposure to permethrin, in rooms containing wool textile floor coverings. In 80 private homes with wool rugs and wool wall-to-wall carpets, the concentration of permethrin was monitored in wool <b>fibres,</b> in house <b>dust</b> and on airborne particles. The concentrations of permethrin in wool fibres varied from < 1 to 245 mg permethrin/kg wool fibre. The permethrin concentrations in house dust ranged from < 1 to 659 mg/kg. Permethrin was found in very low concentrations on airborne particles. Independent on the permethrin concen trations in house dust, in most cases the concentrations varied between < 1 and 6 ng/m 3. The observed statistical correlations indicate that the indoor air permethrin level may be caused by a small fraction of wool fibres which are suspended in the air...|$|R
40|$|Several {{experiments}} {{have been conducted}} by using Fly Ash and some similar materials, such as lime, sand, gypsum, quarry <b>dust,</b> <b>Fibre</b> Glass for Bricks-making, which generally aims to get a high-strength brick, and safe for the environment. Fly Ash classified as a B- 3 waste is a coal combustion residue generated from burning coal in Steam power plant. Because Fly Ash contains SiO 2, Al 2 O 3,P 2 O 5 and Fe 2 O 3, the levels are quite high; {{the nature of its}} cement characteristic (pozzolonic) is very good for the use of construction industry. In this paper Fal-G brick production process, uses of rap-trap bond in Fal-G brick masonry prism test study and from the economic point of view it turns out the use of hollow block Fal-G can saveconstruction costs 20 to 30 %.

30|$|Bacillus sp. is gram-positive {{bacteria}} with a {{high level}} of extra cellular enzyme production capacity which has attracted its application in many industries. Cellulase and xylanase enzyme production by several Bacillus species has been reported by several workers (Heck et al. 2002; Bhalla et al. 2013; Sharma et al. 2015). Several cellulases with optimum activity at 40  °C have been identified, while the enzymatic hydrolysis at ≤[*] 50  °C exhibit slower hydrolysis rates and often incomplete. This problem can be overcome by thermostable enzymes isolated from thermophilic microbes growing at 50 – 80  °C. In this study, five cellulase cum xylanase producing thermophilic bacterial isolates namely B. tequilensis (VCB 1, VCB 2 and VSDB 4) and B. licheniformis (KBFB 2 and KBFB 3) were isolated from different cellulose and hemicelluloses rich substrates, banana <b>fibre,</b> saw <b>dust</b> and corn cob and selected based on preliminary plate assay. Maximum endo and exoglucanase activity were obtained in B. licheniformis KBFB 3 (4.81  IU ml− 1) and B. tequilensis VSDB 4 (0.061  IU ml− 1) isolated respectively from banana fibre and sawdust enriched sample, but low in B. tequilensis VCB 2, isolated from corncob enrichment. Optimal cellulase activities at pH 6 after incubation at 40 °C were reported in Bacillus circulans and Bacillus subtilis (Otajevwo and Aluyi 2011). Thermostable endoglucanase activity was reported in Bacillus amyloliquefaciens DL- 3 which could maintain 40 % of its activity at broad pHs ranging from pH 4.0 to pH 9.0 after 20  h incubation at 50  °C (Lee et al. 2008; Sharma et al. 2015).|$|R
40|$|Tobacco smoke {{contains}} many toxic, carcinogenic and mutagenic chemicals, {{as well as}} stable and unstable free radicals and reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the particulate and the gas phase {{with the potential for}} biological oxidative damage. Epidemiological evidence established that smoking {{is one of the most}} important extrinsic factor of premature morbidity and mortality. The objective of this study was to investigate oxidative and carcinogenic mechanisms of tobacco and synergistic action with other respirable particles in the respiratory system of smokers. Electron Paramagnetic Resonance (EPR) and spin- trapping techniques were used to study stable free radicals in the cigarette tar, and unstable superoxide anion (O 2 ·-) and hydroxyl (HO·) radicals in the smoke Results showed that the semiquinone radical system has the potential for redox recycling and oxidative action. Further, results proved that aqueous cigarette tar (ACT) solutions can generate adducts with DNA nucleobases, particularly the mutagenic 8 -hydroxy- 2 ’-deoxyguanosine (a biomarker for carcinogenesis). Also, we observed synergistic effects in the generation of HO·, through the Fenton reaction, with environmental respirable particles (asbestos <b>fibres,</b> coal <b>dust,</b> etc.) and ambient particulate matter (PM), such as PM 10, PM 2. 5 and diesel exhaust particles (DEP). The highest synergistic effects was observed with the asbestos fibres (freshly grounded), PM 2. 5 and DEP. Finally, we discuss results from our previous study of conventional cellulose acetate filters and “bio-filters” with hemoglobin impregnated activated carbon, which showed that these filters do not substantially alter the free radical content of smoke in the particulate and in the gaseous phase...|$|R
