30|$|SLAC is an osteoarthropathy of the carpus {{secondary}} to altered stress around an unstable scaphoid. In SLAC, there is ligamentous <b>instability</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>wrist</b> including {{disruption of the}} scapholunate ligament, which causes scapholunate dissociation, scapholunate diastasis, rotary subluxation of the scaphoid and DISI. Changes in alignment of the carpus, particularly changes in position of the scaphoid, result in inordinate stress and load to be placed predominantly on the radioscaphoid and capitolunate joints.|$|E

50|$|The most {{commonly}} associated injury {{is to the}} ulnar styloid process. Styloid fractures can occur either to <b>the</b> very tip <b>of</b> <b>the</b> styloid or at the base. Because the triangular fibrocartilage (TFCC) attaches to <b>the</b> base <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ulna styloid, displaced fractures can result in <b>instability</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> distal radio-ulnar joint. Carpal bone fractures such as those to the scaphoid have been described, whereas <b>instability</b> or dislocations <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>wrist</b> are seen with certain types of distal radius and ulna fractures. Injuries to the elbow, humerus and shoulder are also common after a FOOSH (fall on outstretched hand). Swelling and displacement can cause compression on the median nerve across <b>the</b> <b>wrist,</b> an acute carpal tunnel syndrome.

40|$|Most {{techniques}} <b>of</b> fusion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>wrist</b> joint, whether performed {{through a}} dorsal approach 1, 2, 6 or a medial one tend to involve almost <b>the</b> entire <b>wrist</b> complex extending from <b>the</b> distal end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> radius across the carpus. While such diffuse procedures are indicated in <b>the</b> presence <b>of</b> generalized disease <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>wrist,</b> <b>the</b> n-iced does arise {{for a more}} localized method which conserves part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> joint. It is <b>the</b> purpose <b>of</b> this paper to describe a fusion confined to <b>the</b> radioscaphoid compon-ient <b>of</b> <b>the</b> join-it (Figs. 1 an-id 2). The wrist-joint complex consists <b>of</b> <b>the</b> radiocarpal, mid-carpal, intercarpal, carpometacarpal, an-id intermetacarpal joints. Flexion an-id extension {{take place at the}} radiocarpal, mid-carpal, an-id carpometacarpal joints. The total average range of flexion an-id extension is about 140 degrees and of this range about 40 degrees takes place at the mid-carpal and carpomctacarpal joints. In-itercarpal and in-itermctacarpal movement is important in grip. The inferior radio-ulnar join-it is essential for pronation and supination. A localized radioscaphoid fusion, consequently, has the following advantages: (a) a small but useful residual range of flexion and exten-ison, (b) side to side move-ment, (c) preservation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> grip, and (d) unimpaired movements of pronation and supination.
