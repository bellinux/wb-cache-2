5000|$|The enzymes {{produced}} by X-linked genes AWAT1 and AWAT2 {{have been shown}} to esterify long chain alcohols to produce wax esters and is most predominantly expressed in skin. [...] Both enzymes have dissimilar substrate specificities: AWAT1 prefers <b>decyl</b> <b>alcohol</b> (C10) and AWAT2 prefers C16 and C18 alcohols while using oleoyl-CoA as the acyl donor. However, when using acetyl alcohol as the acyl acceptor, AWAT1 prefers saturated acyl groups, while AWAT2 shows activity with all four acyl-CoAs and performs two times better with unsaturated acyl-CoAs than with saturated ones. Along with the murine wax ester synthase, AWAT1 and AWAT2 are likely the most significant contributors in wax ester production in mammals.|$|E
40|$|Does hydrophobe {{branching}} make a surfactant {{more or less}} hydrophilic? Dr Ingegard Johansson of Akzo Nobel Surface Chemistry {{explains the}} complex chemistry behind some new products The hydrophobic-hydrophilic question came up in oursearch for new and efficient hydrophobic raw materialsfor surfactants. It was known that branching with defined branches like the Guerbet type gives good environmental prop-erties, such as lower aquatic toxicity and easy biodegradation, and one would also expect it to lead to low foaming and good cleaning performance. However, a detailed structure-perform-ance knowledge was lacking. We carried out an investigation which filled in that gap and, with further fine-tuning, {{gave rise to a}} couple of new members of the Akzo Nobel product portfolio. An automatic titration technique was also developed for the characterisation of the surfactants and surfactant blends. Physico-chemical studies A series of non-ionic surfactants was synthesised, based on dif-ferent straight-chain or Guerbet-branched decyl alcohols. The hydrophilic part was ethylene oxide (EO) or glucose. For the EO derivatives, the total amount of EO varied, as did the distribu-tion, i. e. both broad and narrow. The glucosides were made with only one degree of polymerisation. Many of their physico-chemical properties were determined and some results are given here. More detail was given in a paper at CESIO 2004 in Berlin. 1 As shown in Figure 1, the Critical Micelle Concentration (CMC) of the surfactants depends both on their branching and the type of distribution.

40|$|Fatty {{acids and}} other {{surface active agents}} were used to clarify the {{relationship}} of surface activity to the inhibition of lactic streptococci. There was complete inhibition of lactic streptococci in media where surface activity exceeded a critical level. The effectiveness of inhibition by fatty acids, nonionic surface active agents, anionic surface active agents, <b>decyl</b> <b>alcohol,</b> growth medium, and temperature variation was {{directly related to the}} surface activity. The surface active agents created an unfavorable environment at most concentrations, rather than acting as a specific inhibitory substance to which the organisms were capable of adapting and thereafter resuming normal growth. The variety of chemical compounds and conditions that produce a common physical effect indicate the inhibition involves physical phenomena at the bacterium:menstruum interface. Results indicate that surfactants are important in the inhibition of lactic streptococci...|$|E

40|$|Key words: {{allergic}} contact dermatitis; occupational; plastics. Di-isodecyl phthalate (DIDP) is a plasticizer used in {{the production}} of plastic and plastic coating to increase flexibility. It is a mixture of compounds derived from the esterification of phthalic acid and isomeric <b>decyl</b> <b>alcohols.</b> In a facility producing durable vinyl-coated cover material on a dyed backing paper base, we found 2 workers with a positive patch test reaction to DIDP. DIDP was used as a carrier for 10, 10 ’-oxybisphenoxarsine (CAS 58 - 36 - 6), a biocide used in products to protect the vinyl-coated materials from decay by mould, mildew, and bacteria. Case 1 A 53 -year-old male reported an itching dermatitis with papules, scaling and erythema on both forearms, marking the border of the gloves used during his work as an operator. No signs of dermatitis were seen elsewhere on his body. There were no signs of atopy in his medical history. The complaints started without any change in exposure of the skin. Treatment by the general practitioner with a topical steroid helped in periods of exacerbation of the skin complaints. During holidays, the skin problems diminished. Over time, the period needed for relapse after work resumption shortened from weeks to days. Case 2 A 61 -year-old male with atopic dermatitis reported suffering skin complaints of red, itchy bumps on both arms, his trunk and his legs for over 6 years. Erythematous papules on the forearms, legs and trunk were seen on dermatological inspection...|$|R
40|$|The {{ability of}} {{nonionic}} surfactants to solubilize the pesticide alachlor was studied. Two homologue series, octylphenol ethoxylates (Triton X- 114, Triton X- 100 and Triton X- 102) and ethoxylated <b>decyl</b> <b>alcohols</b> (Neodol 91 - 5 E, Neodol 91 - 6 E and Neodol 91 - 8 E) were used at concentrations 3 {{critical micelle concentration}} (CMC) and 6 CMC. The rate of solubilization of a sufficient quantity of alachlor (for saturation) in aqueous solution containing the micelles of nonionic surfactant was recorded. The experimental data were fitted to a first-order kinetic model. The rate constant, saturation concentration and enhancement factor were estimated for each surfactant system. The effect of surfactant structure, CMC concentration, pesticide structure and its physicochemical properties {{on the effectiveness of}} solubilization was determined. In terms of solubilization capability, the nonionic surfactants of each homologue series can be ranked as follows: Neodol 91 - 8 E > Neodol 91 - 6 E > Neodol 91 - 5 E and Triton X- 102 > Triton X- 100 > Triton X- 114. The more hydrophilic Neodol series was proved more efficient in alachlor solubilization than Triton series. The enhancement factor values ranged from 1. 064 to 1. 995 at 3 CMC and 1. 320 to 2. 919 at 6 CMC. The results will be used mainly for micellar-enhanced ultratiltration since the extent of solubilization is a critical factor. (c) 2006 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R

For example ethoxylated derivatives of normal <b>decyl</b> <b>alcohol</b> EDDn, belonging to nonionic surfactants showed that at room temperature and low degrees of ethoxylation n acoustic spectra can be described in terms of the relaxation theory. It is shown that within the experimental error of the acoustic spectrum of EDDn, in the studied range of frequencies and temperature, are composed of two prime areas of acoustic dispersion. The results of calculations of relaxation and thermodynamic parameters of fast and ultrafast processes of restructuring EDDn can be used in the development of combined technologies of enhanced oil recovery using surfactant solutions and various physical fields and factors...|$|E
40|$|Evaporation of solute in aqueous {{solutions}} of long chain alcohols and acids {{may cause}} important errors in {{measures of the}} surface tensions of these solutions. The work {{described in the present}} paper has shown that, even in a closed vessel, the vapour pressure of the solute is not uniform and particularly with the pendant drop method, the heavy vapours do not remain near the drop, where the surface tension is measured. The du Nouy ring method and the pendant drop method have been improved to avoid evaporation.

PLA (poly D,L-lactide) and PLGA (poly D,L-lactide-co-glycolide) based nanoparticles were prepared and the effect of APG on particle size, entrapment efficiency and biological activity was evaluated. At a concentration as low as 0. 05 % w/v, APG provided an excellent stabilization effect, resulting in nanoparticles with better encapsulation efficiency and particle size well below 450 nm. The effective concentration of APG was found to be much less (10 -fold) as compared to PVA. Moreover, APG also showed low residual content as compared to PVA. In-vitro and in-vivo biological activity evaluation confirmed that encapsulated peptide was compatible with APG. These preliminary results suggest that APGs can be used as alternate surfactants for nanoparticle preparation...|$|R

40|$|The surface {{tensions}} of aqueous solutions of long-chain alcohols and acids {{measured by}} the usual techniques are shown to be high by a significant amount owing to solute evaporation during the measurement. If the ring or vertical plate method is used, only measurements in a closed vessel give equilibrium values; if the hanging drop is used, the heavy vapors do not remain near the drop, and it is therefore essential to form the drop {{very close to the}} surface of the solution which is saturating the surrounding air. Improvements in normal procedures, designed to eliminate the evaporational error, are described. Various anomalies, for example, the "bag effect" found by Addison and Hutchinson with <b>decyl</b> <b>alcohol</b> solutions, and the minimum in the time curves of surface tension observed by Ward and Ottman with capric acid solutions, are shown to be consistent with an evaporational effect. New surface tension-concentration curves for aqueous solutions of some alcohols and acids are given in the present paper. The corresponding adsorption values have been deduced from the Gibbs equation. © 1959. SCOPUS: ar. jinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|E
