These tax expenditures went predominantly to higher-income Americans. The bottom three income quintiles received about 10% of all credits, while the top quintile received about 60%.

40|$|For {{more than}} 150 years, many economists have assumed public {{subsidies}} {{on higher education}} to have a regressive <b>distributional</b> <b>effect.</b> The German debate on this issue is kept alive by many empirical studies. Most of them confirm the thesis of a p̈erverse distribution of income(̈Milton Friedman). Nevertheless, a methodological analysis of these studies unveils some problems. As the following paper tries to show, the empirical studies on the <b>distributional</b> <b>effect</b> of public higher education funding {{are not able to}} confirm the prima-facia plausibility of the thesis mentioned above. Therefore, an alternative approach to ascertaining the incidence in the long run of public subsidies on higher education seems to be necessary. higher education funding, tax incidence, redistribution of income...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{empirical evidence}} on the <b>distributional</b> <b>effect</b> of public higher education through analysis of a cross-sectional view of West Germany in 1997. In contrast to a widely held hypothesis in economics, our findings do not show evidence for a regressive effect. The use of a net-transfer calculation clearly indicates a progressive <b>distributional</b> <b>effect</b> of the benefits from subsidization at least when viewed in the cross-sectional perspective. The decisive factors are (1) the general social stratification within and among the adjusted income deciles and (2) the incidence of the granted benefits. Complementary to the existing widespread literature in this field, we propose the BCa bootstrap procedure in order to perform statisctical inference. ...|$|R

The aim of this {{research}} is to develop an analysis dissintegrated of the <b>distributional</b> <b>effect</b> of the current VAT in Spain, that is to say, this paper assesses the capacity of redistribution of the tax treatment of each expenditure category. It proposes different approaches for the analysis of the redistributive impact differential of each expenditure concept, and it desires to advocate the method of total decomposition of isolated contribution to the global <b>distributional</b> <b>effect</b> of the VAT. In this sense, this study shows the possibilities to identify the guidelines for possible fiscal adjustments of the Value Added Tax to contribute positively to the objectives of social justice, and its respective consequences on the population's welfare. ...|$|R

The trade shock increased inequality of individual earnings. At the household level, however, about 40 % of this <b>distributional</b> <b>effect</b> is reduced by a simple insurance effect that occurs if partners within married and unmarried couples are differently affected by the trade shock. The insurance effect is substantial since the trade shock had a large variation across industries and 80 % of individuals within couples are employed in different industries. Our analysis also reveals that many workers who individually benefit from the trade shock turn into 'losers' at the household level {{because they have a}} partner who experiences a strong negative impact. All in all, this paper suggests that a household level perspective is essential {{in order to understand the}} exact distributional consequences of globalization...|$|R

We found evidence that improved maize adoption has stronger impact on welfare of female-headed households and poorer households. ...|$|R

Exact conditions for the following insights are derived. The <b>distributional</b> <b>effect</b> of offshoring (high-) low-skill-intensive tasks is similar to (unskilled-) skill-biased technology changes, while offshoring medium-skill-intensive tasks induces wage polarization. Offshoring improves cost-efficiency through international task reallocation and puts a downward pressure on all wages through domestic skill-task reallocation. If elasticities of task substitution are low (high), the downward pressure on wages in neighbouring skill segments is low (high) with a net effect of higher (lower) wages and employment...|$|R

50|$|Subsidies {{may also}} lead to perverse or {{unintended}} economic effects. They would result in inefficient resource allocation if imposed on a competitive market or where market imperfections do not justify a subsidy, by diverting economic resources away from areas where their marginal productivity would be higher. Generalised subsidies waste resources; further, they may have perverse <b>distributional</b> <b>effects</b> endowing greater benefits on the better off people. For example, a price control may lead to lower production and shortages and thus generate black markets resulting in profits to operators in such markets and economic rents to privileged people {{who have access to}} the distribution of the good concerned at the controlled price.|$|E

A briefing from the UK Women’s Budget Group on the cumulative <b>distributional</b> <b>effects</b> of cuts in public spending and tax changes on household income by gendered types over the period 2010-20 identified significant, and disproportionate, negative impacts of the government’s plans on women and low-income households (in which women predominate) despite claims that the burden would be shared equally.|$|E
5000|$|Dr. Carl Milsted, {{senior editor}} of the Free Liberal, {{suggested}} that the FairTax would be a significant tax break for high-net-worth individuals, so it should be combined with a wealth tax. He claims that such a system would allow a lower tax rate on consumption, while maintaining current levels of taxation on high-net-worth individuals. Randall Burns, the EconomicsModerator of the Kucinich Volunteer Forum, had previously suggested that fairtax could be paired with an asset tax that could be adjusted to assure that asset distribution after the switch to Fairtax wouldn't be more concentrated than under the existing system. [...] Economist Laurence Kotlikoff of Boston University states that the FairTax would be a tax on wealth, unlike the current system that taxes income. The Beacon Hill Institute at Suffolk University concluded in a 2007 study on <b>distributional</b> <b>effects</b> that [...] "the FairTax benefits households and individuals in the lower expenditure categories, while imposing a higher burden on those in the higher expenditure brackets" [...] and that it [...] "would benefit the average individual in almost all expenditures deciles." [...] Further, research by Arduin, Laffer & Moore Econometrics shows that consumption would increase by 2.4% {{in the first year of}} the FairTax. The increase in consumption would be fueled by the 1.7% increase in disposable (after-tax) personal income that occurs once the FairTax was enacted. By the 10th year, disposable income would increase by 11.8% resulting in a corresponding increase in consumption of 11.7% over what it would be if the current tax system remained in place, and these results are based on the assumption that businesses use only the tax savings achieved from no longer having to pay the employer share of payroll taxes (for more details, see Promotion of economic growth).|$|E
