50|$|The {{steamboat}} Comet, {{whose name}} {{was said to have}} been “misleading”, was built in Seattle in 1871 by Capt. Simon F. Randolph (d.1909). Comet was constructed in an unusual fashion. Randolph built the vessel upside down by picking a flat area of <b>ground,</b> <b>marking</b> out the shape of the boat on the ground, and driving in posts at regular intervals to act as ribs. He then connected the ribs with crossbeams, bent planks around the posts and over the crossbeams, and had the hull complete, although upside down.|$|E

50|$|Research {{published}} in the 25 March 2004 edition of Geophysical Research Letters, which used images taken by the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), aboard NASA's Terra and Aqua satellites, indicated that storms move across the Bodélé Depression at about 47 km/h (29 mi/h) - two times faster than previously believed. The research also found that winds have to whip across the region at a minimum of 36 km/h (22 mi/h), to kick up a dust storm.

50|$|Since it is a cuckoo bumblebee, Bombus sylvestris {{does not}} {{construct}} its own nest; rather, it usurps the nests of other bumblebees. Its major host is Bombus pratorum, but Bombus jonellus and Bombus monticola are also visited. When patrolling for young queens {{with which to}} mate, the males fly in circuits about 1 m above <b>ground,</b> <b>marking</b> objects with their pheromones to attract the queens. The bumblebee often visits thistles and bramble. The queen also feeds on flowers such as sallow, deadnettles, dandelion, bay, horse chestnut, lavender, and others. The males, on the contrary, visits clovers, green alkanets, hound's-tongues, knapweeds, and many others.|$|E
50|$|Higher Common Ground is a cricket {{ground in}} Royal Tunbridge Wells, Kent.

The following season, Kent played Sussex at the <b>ground,</b> <b>marking</b> their first first-class match there. From 1845 to 1884, Kent played 28 first-class matches at the ground, with their final match there coming against Somerset, which was also the final first-class match at the ground. A number of others teams also played first-class cricket at the ground, these included: A combined Kent and Sussex team in 1853 against an All-England Eleven; the South 5 times between 1854 and 1883; and a United Eleven against the touring Australians in 1882. From 1844 to 1884, the ground held a combined total of 36 first-class matches.|$|E

Mosher's HighWaterLine went past low-income housing developments, luxury apartment buildings, power stations, nursing homes and hospitals.

5000|$|The {{bridge was}} erected during the German occupation, under the {{directions}} of the occupying forces. It {{was part of}} the so-called Montzen line designed to provide an alternative relatively unimpeded rail route for the speedy transfer of supplies to the western front across the high <b>ground</b> <b>marking</b> the pre-war border between Germany and Belgium. The existing mainline route, a short distance to the east, via Herbesthal, was becoming increasingly congested through sheer volume of traffic. The old frontier crossing at Herbesthal railway station itself was the channel through which more than 70,000 Belgian forced labourers passed, and it also became the unintended home and nursing centre for thousands of stranded war casualties. Work on the Geul Valley bridge started early in 1915 and was completed in October 1916, although the full [...] "Montzen line" [...] rail route opened for through traffic only in 1917. The companies involved in the construction were, principally, Dyckerhoff & Widmann, MAN Werk Gustavsburg Grün & Bilfinger and [...] Under the wartime conditions of the time, forced labourers from Belgium, Germany, Italy, Hungary, Croatia and Russia were used for the work along with Russian prisoners of war, many of whom were at that time interned in the nearby [...] "Val de Vie" [...] camp.|$|E
50|$|The line {{started from}} a Bristol-facing {{junction}} with sidings on the Clifton Extension Railway (which ran from Narroways Hill Junction and Kingswood Junction in north Bristol {{to the port}} of Avonmouth). This junction was located 30 chains 600 metres east of Avonmouth Docks joint station. The stub of the line at its southern end appears as a siding on an Ordnance Survey map of 1949. It crossed several streets on the level in the expanding suburb before setting out across the fields of Avonmouth farm {{in the direction of}} a facility variously described as a Bristol Corporation electricity sub-station and as a generating station, and terminating on the western side of this facility in what is now a widened St Andrew’s Road. It was about 58 chain m long. There is some doubt about whether it was ever extended further. Almost no trace of the line remains in 2015. Gaps between buildings in Portview Road, Davis Street and Avonmouth Road could be discerned by the knowledgeable and interpreted as the course of the line, but building has taken place in some gaps, and the only ones remaining are on both sides of Davis Street (west of numbers 28 and 31) and opposite the Miles Arms hotel in Avonmouth Road. The fields north of the village across which it went have all been built over with warehousing and other commercial development as Avonmouth has expanded, but the disturbed <b>ground</b> <b>marking</b> its course can clearly be followed in post-WW2 aerial photography, cutting across fields still showing the ridge-and-furrow pattern of pre-modern arable farming. The electricity station or sub-station which was its destination is still in existence but derelict.|$|E

We confirmed the existence of <b>ground</b> <b>marking</b> in Lasius niger and demonstrated its influence on the aggregative behaviour of ants: {{the place of the}} gathering is leading by the existence of a <b>ground</b> <b>marking</b> which favours clustering by increasing the rate of the process but does not change the aggregation level.

This marking, presuming to have a long duration, could represent an external memory which could play an important role in various situations such as the choice of new nest or the reorganisation of ants after a disturbance.

40|$|Current {{research}} {{develops a}} vision-based surveillance system concept suitable for airport ramp area operations. The surveillance approach consists of computer vision algorithms operating on video streams from surveillance cameras for detecting aircraft in images and localizing them. Rough {{order of magnitude}} {{estimates of the number}} of cameras required to cover the ramp area at a sample airport (Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport) were obtained. Two sets of algorithms with complimentary features were developed to detect an aircraft in a given image. The first set of algorithms was based on background subtraction, a popular computer-vision approach, for change detection in video streams. The second set was a supervised-learning approach based on a model learned from a database of images. The Histogram of Oriented Gradient (HOG) feature was used for classification with Support Vector Machines (SVMs). Then, an algorithm for matching aircraft in two different images was developed based on an approximate aircraft localization algorithm. Finally, stereo-vision algorithms were used for 3 D-localization of the aircraft. A 1 : 400 scale model of a realistic airport consisting of a terminal building, jet bridges, <b>ground</b> <b>marking,</b> aircraft, and ground vehicles was used for testing the various algorithms. Aircraft detection was demonstrated using static and moving aircraft images, single and multiple aircraft images, and occluded aircraft images.
