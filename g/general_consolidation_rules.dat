40|$|In this paper, we {{analyze the}} {{relationship}} between interest rates on government bonds (GB) and fiscal <b>consolidation</b> <b>rule</b> by using an overlapping generation model with endogenous and stochastic growth settings. Our key findings are summarized as follows. First, interest rates of GB may be declining as public debt accumulates relative to private capital, {{as opposed to the}} conventional view that buildup of public debt accompanies a rise in interest rates. Second, fiscal <b>consolidation</b> <b>rule</b> {{plays a key role in}} determining interest rates in equilibrium. Third, the economy may exhibit discrete changes with interest rates diverging, implying that our observation of relatively low GB interest rates does not assure the continuation of that trend in the future. Fourth, a preventive tax increase to contain public debt at sustainable levels will not gain the political support of existing generations, whose life span is limited. Citizens prefer to shift the ultimate burden of public debt to future generations.

40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} {{the impact of}} deflation and inflation on the real interest rates of GBs using an overlapping generations model with {{the relationship between the}} real interest rate of GBs and the fiscal <b>consolidation</b> <b>rule.</b> We find that deflation may lower the real interest rate of GBs to the same level of public debt to capital, even if the fiscal <b>consolidation</b> <b>rule</b> is the same, as opposed to the conventional view that the real interest rate of GBs is determined independent of deflation if the Fisher equation holds. Our results are consistent with how the real interest rates of Japanese GBs react in periods of deflation. This paper also addresses the impact of fiscal inflation (i. e., monetizing all parts of the GB’s default using monetary policy). We calculate the expected fiscal inflation when the default rate in the event of fiscal consolidation is raised. The fiscal inflation may be extremely high if the extent of the required tax increase in fiscal consolidation is low. Initial inflation accelerates the expected fiscal inflation, but initial deflation suppresses it.

In this paper, we solve this problem by using existing servers, which are heterogeneous and diversely preferred by IT managers. Five practical <b>consolidation</b> <b>rules</b> are introduced, and a decision model is proposed to optimally allocate source services to physical target servers while maximizing the average resource utilization and preference value.

40|$|Consolidation is {{encountered}} in various areas of soil mechanics. The phenomenon {{needs to be}} analyzed for instance {{in the design of}} footings, pile foundations, and em-bankments. The development of finite element methods has lead to the advancement of the solution of consolidation, especially when dealing with complex geometry and boundary conditions. This thesis proposes a finite element formulation based on the displacement-pressure (u/p) interpolation because u/p formulations are known to give optimal approximations in analysis of almost incompressible media. We use a 9 / 4 -c element for its proven stability. Both the linear elastic and elasto-plastic response of soil behaviour are analyzed. To predict the plastic response, the Drucker-Prager and Mohr-Coulomb models are used.

I describe the rules for compiling consolidated financial statements according to the Czech legal norms as well as International Financial Reporting Standards. Some of the International Financial Reporting Standards which relate to the consolidated financial statements are described in more detail and compared in some respects with Czech legal norms.

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to {{establish}} whether jurisprudence of the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJ) on corporate tax leads to a more level playing field and increased tax neutrality within the European Internal Market. It uses two rulings as case studies to demonstrate how the jurisprudence of the Court does not necessarily lead to increased neutrality or a more level playing field. The first ruling in Lankhorst-Hohorst regards the compatibility of thin capitalisation with free movement provisions; the second in Marks & Spencer concerns the compatibility of <b>rules</b> on group <b>consolidation</b> with those same provisions. An economic analysis demonstrates that, depending on the reaction of Member States to the ruling, differences in capital costs faced by firms operating in the European Internal Market may increase, whilst GDP and welfare may decrease. Consideration of actual legislative amendments introduced to thin capitalisation rules by Member States following Lankhorst-Hohorst and to group <b>consolidation</b> <b>rules</b> following Marks & Spencer seem to indicate that it is this negative scenario which has prevailed.
