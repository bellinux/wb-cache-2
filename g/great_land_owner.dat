40|$|The {{administrative}} {{agencies and}} {{policies of the}} Prussian people education were established gradually under the regime of Friedrich Wilhelm I and {{in the beginning of}} the regime of Friedrich II (about in 1700 - 1750) If we study the Prussian people education from the view-point of administrative and political history, it seems that the Prussian people education spread keeping pacew with the development of administrative and political works on it. But many facts showed that the Prussian people education did not spread keeping pace with the development of administrative and political works on it, because there were many contradictions between the development of administrative and political works on it, and the spread of people education on the formative stage of absolutism. The Prussian absolutism formed his central political power permitting, to the great feudal land owners, "die Gutsherren," many feudal privileges, "Grundherrschaft" "Leibherrschaft" and "Patrimonial-gerichtsbarkeit" etc. These feudal privileges formed the so-called "gutsherrlich-bauerliches Verhaltnis" between the great land owners and peasantry under their governing which is, at the same time, the feudal productive relations, the feudal governing system and the feudal community in each "Gutsherren" domains. The great land owners, "die Gutsherren," had many chances to restrict the school attendance of children of people under their governing and they had no interests in school attendance of their children, because, when the children became more intellectual, they wanted to escape from the "Gutsherren" governing. Generally speaking, on the formative stage of absolutism, the people education in the "Gutsherren" domains did not spread keeping pace with the development of administrative and political works on it. While the people education did spread in the kings domains in East Prussian and Littauen even on the formative stage of absolutism, there, the king himself was, at the same time, the <b>great</b> <b>land</b> <b>owner,</b> so he could freely relax the "gutsherrlich-bauerliches Verhaltnis" to enable the children of people under his governing to attend school. These facts show that the relaxation of the gutsherrlich-baerliches Verhal tnis" is necessary for the spread of people education. But, generallys peaking, there were no necessary conditiens on the formative stage of absolutism all over the kingdom. These necessary conditions will be made on the mature stage of absolutism all over the kingdom and, then, the people education will spread widely, with the thoughts of national educaiton rising gradually...|$|E

50|$|Thanks to the {{originality}} {{with which}} Bourguiba, Sfar, Guiga and El Materi addressed the problems, La Voix du Tunisien became {{a very popular}} newspaper.

The Poles, subjected within the territories under the Russian and Prussian administrations to still stricter controls and increased persecution, sought to preserve their identity in non-violent ways. After the Uprising, Congress Poland was downgraded in official usage from the [...] "Kingdom of Poland" [...] to the [...] "Vistula Land" [...] and was more fully integrated into Russia proper, but not entirely obliterated. The Russian and German languages were imposed in all public communication, and the Catholic Church was not spared from severe repression; public education was increasingly subjected to Russification and Germanization measures. Illiteracy was reduced, most effectively in the Prussian partition, but education in Polish was preserved mostly through unofficial efforts. The Prussian government pursued German colonization, including the purchase of Polish-owned land. On the other hand, the region of Galicia in western Ukraine and southern Poland experienced a gradual relaxation of authoritarian policies and even a Polish cultural revival.
