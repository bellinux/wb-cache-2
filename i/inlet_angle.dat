Both on- and off-design conditions are studied. For bowed vanes, the bowed angle varies from 10 degrees to 40 degrees and the normalized bowed height ranges from 0. 1 to 0. 3. Results are included for Nusselt number distributions on the endwall, the energy losses, the yaw angles, and near-wall flow structures. For the convenience of comparison, the straight vane is also studied as a baseline. It is found that the bowed vanes can effectively reduce the endwall heat transfer. Among the tested parameters, a bowed angle of 40 degrees and a normalized bowed height of 0. 3 provide the best-controlled heat transfer for both the on- and off-design conditions. However, the bowed vanes have different effects on the energy losses and the yaw angles depending on the operating conditions. For the on-design condition with the <b>inlet</b> <b>angle</b> of 30 degrees (the incidence angle is 0 degrees) and the off-design condition with the <b>inlet</b> <b>angle</b> of 0 degrees, the bowed vanes do not significantly increase the energy losses and yaw angles, whereas for the off-design condition with the <b>inlet</b> <b>angle</b> of - 30 degrees, significant changes are observed...|$|E

40|$|Three ways {{in which}} {{secondary}} flow can be generated in a straight compressor cascade have been investigated. 1. Wakeflow. The inlet flow {{is characterized by a}} constant <b>inlet</b> <b>angle</b> and a varying stagnation pressure over the span. 2. Skewed flow. The inlet flow is characterized by a constant stagnation pressure and a varying <b>inlet</b> <b>angle</b> over the span. 3. Skewed wakeflow. The inlet flow is characterized by a variation of both stagnation pressure and <b>inlet</b> <b>angle</b> over the span. For a certain combination of <b>inlet</b> <b>angle</b> and stagnation pressure distribution (presented in a formula) in the skewed wakeflow case no secondary flow is generated behind the cascade. The kinetic energy of the secondary flow was found to be very small in all three cases. The secondary flow itself did not create any losses but the blades stalled in the skewed flow layer and in the skewed wakeflow layer causing great losses. The stream pressure and the tangential blade force were lower in the disturbed flow region. A small perturbation theory (for a non-viscous, incompressible fluid) had been developed to describe analytically the secondary flow. Formulae readily adaptable for numerical calculations of flow deviation angles, kinetic energy of the secondary flow, and tangential blade force are presented. Good and satisfactory correlation of theory and experiment was found. Applied to compressor design the results imply: The secondary flow is very small and may occur as an overturning or an underturning of the flow at the casings depending on the actual design. The kinetic energy of the secondary flow may be neglected when considering the losses. The ends of the blades stall in the skewed boundary layer at the casings causing losses. This could be reduced by twisting the blade ends to account for the increased incidence angle. The stream pressure varies in spanwise direction through the boundary layer on the casings.

40|$|Ultrafiltration (UF) {{is one of}} {{the many}} {{technologies}} used in the treatment of process and wastewaters. Tubular UF membrane modules are used to treat fiber suspensions for effluent control and chemical recovery in the pulp and paper industry. However, the treatment of pulp suspensions with modules containing tubes having an inside diameter of less than 2. 54 cm is typically problematic. Severe blockage occurs at the inlet of the tubes due to the accumulation of pulp fibers within the header. In the present study, the commercial computational fluid dynamics package, CFD-ACE+ was used to simulate the hydrodynamics within the header of a simplified system. The hydrodynamics were simplified by approximating the two-phase pulp suspension with a single-phase Newtonian fluid. The main flow structures within various header geometries were analyzed. Header geometry was varied by chamfering the inlet of a tube at four specific angles. These four angles, referred to as <b>inlet</b> <b>angles,</b> were 0 ∘, 30 ∘, 45 ∘, and 55 ∘. The hydrodynamic features within the different header configurations were compared. A central eddy in the shape of a torus of varying cross section was observed at lower <b>inlet</b> <b>angles.</b> The eddy was less discernable at larger <b>inlet</b> <b>angles.</b> The eddy intensity within the header was identified as the key hydrodynamic structure affecting fiber accumulation.

For the application of micro-thermophotovoltaic (MTPV) system, a high and uniform temperature distribution along {{the walls of the}} micro combustor is desired. In this paper, a three-dimensional numerical simulation has been conducted on a new-designed parallel plate micro combustor with two nozzles. The flow field and the combustion process in the micro combustor, and the temperature distribution on the wall as well as the combustion efficiency were obtained. The effects of various parameters such as the <b>inlet</b> <b>angle</b> and the fuel volumetric flow rate on the performance of the micro combustor were studied. It was observed that a swirl formed {{in the center of the}} combustor and the radius of the swirl increased with the increase of the inlet rate, and the best working condition was achieved at the <b>inlet</b> <b>angle</b> θ= 20 °.

40|$|PaperPg. 189 - 194. This paper {{describes}} {{the relationships of}} inlet velocity distribution, incipient cavitation and suction performance of centrifugal pumps. It also discusses, in particular, the aspects of cavitation as related to inlet reverse flow (internal recirculation). There are many ways of improving the suction performance of centrifugal pumps. Enlarging the inlet diameter or <b>inlet</b> <b>angle</b> {{are two of the}} most commonly used methods. However, this may increase the capacity at which inlet reverse flow begins. Inlet reverse flow normally starts to occur at about half of the shock-free inlet capacity, and this has no relation to the best efficiency flow. Pump total head begins to drop only during advanced cavitation, especially at partial flow operation. When the impeller is designed with a large <b>inlet</b> <b>angle</b> to improve suction performance, there is a possibility of increasing the capacity where inlet reverse flow occurs, which may even be at the best efficiency point. There are still other ways of improving suction performance without increasing the capacity at which inlet reverse flow occurs, e. g. reducing the number of blades, sharpening inlet edges, etc., and these are also referred to in this paper...|$|E
40|$|Engine inlets for subsonic V/STOL {{aircraft}} must operate over a {{wide range}} of conditions without the severe internal flow separation that can cause sudden changes in engine thrust, excessively high fan blade stresses, and possibly core-compressor stall. An experimental investigation was conducted {{to evaluate the effectiveness of}} tangential blowing to maintain attached flow at high <b>inlet</b> <b>angles</b> of attack. The inlet had a relatively thin lip (lip contraction ratio of 1. 46). Two blowing slot locations were investigated: one on the lip and the other in the diffuser. The effect of two slot heights (0. 0508 and 0. 152 cm) and three slot circumferential extents, the largest being 120 deg, also was investigated. The results showed that both lip and diffuser blowing were effective in maintaining attached flow at high angles of attack. However, higher angle-of-attack capability was achieved with lip blowing than with diffuser blowing. This capability was achieved with the largest slot circumferential extent and either of the two slot heights.

A wide range of flow <b>inlet</b> <b>angles</b> are computed, including conditions near the design angle, and at high negative and positive incidence. At all <b>inlet</b> <b>angles</b> the surface pressure distributions are well-predicted by the LES. Near the design angle the computed suction side boundary layer thickness agrees well with experimental data, whilst the pressure side boundary layer is poorly predicted due to the inability of LES to capture natural boundary layer transition on the present grid. A good estimation of the loss is computed near the design angle, whilst at both high positive and negative incidences the loss is less well predicted owing to discrepancies between the computed and experimental boundary layer thickness. At incidences above the design angle a laminar separation bubble forms near {{the leading edge of the}} suction surface, which undergoes a transition to turbulence. Similar behaviour is noted on the pressure surface at negative incidence.
