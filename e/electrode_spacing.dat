5000|$|Although {{periodic}} droplet deformation {{is widely}} studied for its practical industrial applications, its implementation poses significant safety issues and physical limitations {{due to the}} use of electric field. In order to induce periodic droplet deformation using an electric field, an extremely large amplitude electric field must be applied. Research studies using water droplets suspended in silicone oil required root-mean-square values as high as 10^6 V/m [...] Even for a small <b>electrode</b> <b>spacing,</b> this type of field requires electric potentials greater than 500V, which is roughly three times wall voltage in the United States. Practically speaking, this large of an electric field can only be achieved if the <b>electrode</b> <b>spacing</b> is very small (~ O(0.1 mm)) or if a high-voltage amplifier is available.

Intracortical microstimulation (ICMS) of somatosensory cortex is a promising method of delivering this sensory feedback. To date, {{the main focus of}} somatosensory ICMS studies has been to deliver discriminable signals, corresponding to varying intensity, to a single location in cortex. However, multiple independent and simultaneous streams of sensory information will need to be encoded by ICMS to provide functionally relevant feedback for a neuroprosthetic limb (e. g. encoding contact events and pressure on multiple digits). In this study, we evaluated the ability of an awake, behaving non-human primate (Macaca mulatta) to discriminate ICMS stimuli delivered on multiple <b>electrodes</b> <b>spaced</b> within somatosensory cortex. We delivered serial stimulation on single electrodes to evaluate the discriminability of sensations corresponding to ICMS of distinct cortical locations. Additionally, we delivered trains of multichannel stimulation, derived from a tactile sensor, synchronously across multiple electrodes.

40|$|Passive {{air-breathing}} microbial {{fuel cells}} (MFCs) are a promising technology for energy recovery from wastewater and their performance is {{highly dependent on}} characteristics of the separator that isolates the anaerobic anode from the air-breathing cathode. The goal of the present work is to systematically study the separator characteristics {{and its effect on}} the performance of passive air-breathing flat-plate MFCs (FPMFCs). This was performed through characterization of structure, properties, and performance correlations of eight separators in Part 1 of this work. Eight commercial separators were characterized, in non-inoculated and inoculated setups, and were examined in passive air-breathing FPMFCs with different <b>electrode</b> <b>spacing.</b> The results showed a decrease in the peak power density as the oxygen and ethanol mass transfer coefficients in the separators increased, due to the increase of mixed potentials especially at smaller <b>electrode</b> <b>spacing.</b> Increasing the <b>electrode</b> <b>spacing</b> was therefore desirable for the application of diaphragms.

40|$|One of the {{problems}} with tetrapolar impedance measurements is the lack of spatial sensitivity within the measured volume. In this paper we compare the sensitivity of tetrapolar measurements and the focused impedance measurements (FIM) proposed by Rabbani et al (1999 Ann. New York Acad. Sci. 873 408 - 20), which give an improved sensitivity profile. Using a previously validated model of sensitivity based on Geselowitz's lead theory, the sensitivity of FIM using eight, six and four electrodes was investigated. All electrode configurations showed a maximum in the average sensitivity of a plane at a depth of one-third of the drive-receive <b>electrode</b> <b>spacing.</b> No difference was found in the sensitivity value of this maximum between electrode configurations having the same drive-receive <b>electrode</b> <b>spacing.</b> The six-and eight-electrode configurations showed negative sensitivity regions down to half of the drive-receive <b>electrode</b> <b>spacing,</b> whilst the four-electrode measurement showed negative sensitivity regions down to one-third of the drive-receive <b>electrode</b> <b>spacing.</b> The single peak in sensitivity beneath the centre of the electrode configuration became dominant at 0. 56, 1. 4 and 0. 14 of the receive <b>electrode</b> <b>spacing</b> for the eight-, six- and four-electrode configurations respectively.
