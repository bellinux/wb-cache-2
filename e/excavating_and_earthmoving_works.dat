50|$|Roller-compacted concrete, {{sometimes}} called rollcrete, is a low-cement-content stiff concrete placed using techniques borrowed from <b>earthmoving</b> <b>and</b> paving <b>work.</b> The concrete {{is placed on}} the surface to be covered, and is compacted in place using large heavy rollers typically used in earthwork. The concrete mix achieves a high density and cures over time into a strong monolithic block. Roller-compacted concrete is typically used for concrete pavement, but has also been used to build concrete dams, as the low cement content causes less heat to be generated while curing than typical for conventionally placed massive concrete pours.|$|R
