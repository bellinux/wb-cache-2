25|$|When I {{became a}} member of the law firm of Steger, Thurmond and Rayburn, Messrs. Thurmond and Steger were {{representing}} the Santa Fe Railroad Company, receiving pay monthly. When the first check came after I entered the firm, Mr. Thurmond brought to my desk one-third of the amount of the check, explaining what it was for. I said to him that I was a member of the Legislature, representing the people of Fannin County, and that my experience had taught me that men who represent the people should be as far removed as possible from concerns whose interests he was liable to be called on to legislate concerning, and that on that ground I would not accept a dollar of the railroad's money, though I was legally entitled to it. <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>did</b> take a dollar of it. I have been guided by the principle in all my dealings.|$|E
25|$|It was Neil's {{last season}} {{and it was a}} shame that his amazing career should end in an uncharacteristic {{outburst}} of bad temper against Ted Dexter. <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>did</b> {{get to the bottom of}} the row but perhaps it was just because he and Ted were total opposites as people. All I know is that his press comments on Ted lost him a lot of friends. These attacks upset the MCC players more than anything else that happened on that tour, and for Neil to retire from the game on this sour note was disappointing for those who had played with an against him, and for the public who had enjoyed his performances. For all this, you couldn't help admiring some of Neil's knocks, including his sixth Test century against England. He was nearly always exciting to watch because he was the sort of batsman who was supremely capable of winning or saving a match. He was also good to bowl to because he gave you a chance; he played shots and he took risks. And his fielding was quite brilliant; in this series, it was easily the best on either side. He stopped some wonderful shots in the covers and took some terrific catches. It was just sad to see such a talented man consumed by such bitterness.|$|E
25|$|<b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>did</b> {{know exactly}} what was meant by the term 'The Beats', but let's say that the {{original}} meeting, association, comradeship of Allen , myself, Michael , Lawrence , Philip Whalen, who's not here, Lew Welch, who's dead, Gregory , for me, to a somewhat lesser extent (I never knew Gregory {{as well as the}} others) did embody a criticism and a vision which we shared in various ways, and then went our own ways for many years. Where we began to come really close together again, in the late '60s, and gradually working toward this point, it seems to me, was when Allen began to take a deep interest in Oriental thought and then in Buddhism which added another dimension to our levels of agreement; and later through Allen's influence, Lawrence began to draw toward that; and from another angle, Michael and I after the lapse of some years of contact, found our heads very much in the same place, and it's very curious and interesting now; and Lawrence went off in a very political direction for a while, which none of us had any objection with, except that wasn't my main focus. It's very interesting that we find ourselves so much on the same ground again, after having explored divergent paths; and find ourselves united on this position of powerful environmental concern, critique of the future of the individual state, and an essentially shared poetics, and only half-stated but in the background very powerfully there, a basic agreement on some Buddhist type psychological views of human nature and human possibilities.|$|E

500|$|Producer Todd Phillips {{described}} {{the film as}} an experiment, after executive producer Alex Heineman provided a basic concept, with the production team sharing tales of memorable parties that they had either attended or heard about. Writer Michael Bacall developed these stories into an outline scenario in one night {{with the goal of}} creating the [...] "gnarliest high school party of all time". The remainder of the story was fleshed out in the following weeks. Bacall and Drake were told to [...] "go crazy" [...] with the script, although Bacall confessed [...] "I was a nerd in high school so <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>did</b> anything like what's in the movie". Bacall worked on the script generally at nights between simultaneously working on the scripts for 21 Jump Street and Scott Pilgrim vs. the World.|$|E

500|$|Love {{possesses}} a contralto vocal range, and her vocal style {{has been described}} as [...] "raw and distinctive". According to Love, she never wanted to be a singer, but rather aspired to be a skilled guitarist: [...] "I'm such a lazy bastard though that <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>did</b> that", she said. [...] "I was always the only person with the nerve to sing, and so I got stuck with it". She has been regularly noted by critics for her husky vocals as well as her [...] "banshee" [...] screaming abilities. Her vocals have been compared to those of Johnny Rotten, and David Fricke of Rolling Stone described them as [...] "lung-busting" [...] and [...] "a corrosive, lunatic wail". Upon the release of Hole's 2010 album, Nobody's Daughter, Amanda Petrusich of Pitchfork compared Love's raspy, unpolished vocals to those of Bob Dylan.|$|E

[...] The single nonetheless hit number one in Canada, number three on the US country charts, and number 29 on the Billboard Hot 100. When It All Goes South (2001) followed in 2001. [...] "If <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>did</b> another CD, this is the one I will always point to as the one that I was happy with the most," [...] said Owen {{at the time of its}} release.

500|$|After {{her time}} with her new friends at the retreat, Sarah Savage was optimistic. [...] "I left the retreat with a {{different}} outlook on life, I could feel my confidence growing, slowly."

500|$|As an adolescent, Olga {{received}} frequent reminders {{from her}} mother to be an example for the other children and to be patient with her younger sisters and with her nurses. On January 11, 1909, Alexandra admonished thirteen-year-old Olga for rudeness and bad behavior. She told the teenager that she must be polite to the servants, who looked after her well and did their best for her, and she should not make her nurse [...] "nervous" [...] when she was tired and not feeling well. Olga responded on January 12, 1909 that she would try to do better but it wasn't easy because her nurse became angry and cross with her for no good reason. However, Ersberg, one of the maids, told her niece that the servants sometimes {{had good reason to}} be cross with Olga because the eldest grand duchess could be spoiled, capricious, and lazy. On January 24, 1909, Alexandra scolded the active teenager, who once signed another of her letters with the nickname [...] "Unmounted Cossack", again: [...] "You are growing very big — don't be so wild and kick about and show your legs, it is not pretty. <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>did</b> so when your age or when I was smaller and younger even." ...|$|E

500|$|Initially Cudi {{stated that}} he would [...] "lay low until his album drops to avoid {{unnecessary}} hype." [...] Despite this statement, he went on a tour with rapper Asher Roth between July and August 2009. He performed all of the albums singles at Maryland's The Ulalume Music Festival in October 2009. In 2009, the rapper also toured with singer Lady Gaga as an opening act during {{the first leg of}} her The Monster Ball Tour in North America, where he performed the track [...] "Make Her Say". Less than a month later, and after an altercation with an audience member in Vancouver, it was announced that due to time conflicts, Cudi chose to leave the tour. An official statement from him read, [...] "Kid Cudi has decided to take an early leave of absence from Lady Gaga's Monster Ball tour, in order to balance his schedule surrounding the recording of his next album and acting commitments. Cudi does not want to disappoint his fans and will move forward with his individual show dates in December and throughout the month of January."

500|$|The {{album was}} {{originally}} {{set to be}} distributed under the title Cop Killer, named for {{the song of the}} same name, which criticizes violent police officers. During the production of the album, Warner Bros. executives were aware of the potential controversy that the album and song could cause, but supported it. At a Time-Warner shareholders' meeting, actor Charlton Heston stood and read lyrics from the song [...] "KKK Bitch" [...] to an astonished audience and demanded that the company take action. Sire responded by changing the title to Body Count, but did not remove the song. In an article for the Washington Post, Tipper Gore condemned Ice-T for songs like [...] "Cop Killer," [...] writing that [...] "Cultural economics were a poor excuse for the South's continuation of slavery. Ice-T's financial success cannot excuse the vileness of his message [...] Hitler's anti-Semitism sold in Nazi Germany. That didn't make it right." [...] The Dallas Police Association and the Combined Law Enforcement Association of Texas launched a campaign to force Warner Bros. Records to withdraw the album. CLEAT called for a boycott of all products by Time-Warner in order to secure the removal of the song and album from stores. Within a week, they were joined by police organizations across the United States. Ice-T asserted that the song was written {{from the point of view}} of a fictional character, and told reporters that [...] "I ain't never killed no cop. I felt like it a lot of times. But <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>did</b> it. If you believe that I'm a cop killer, you believe David Bowie is an astronaut," [...] in reference to Bowie's song [...] "Space Oddity".|$|E
