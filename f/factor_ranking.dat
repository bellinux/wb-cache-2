40|$|Austrian {{journals}} in the Journal Citation Reports - a bibliometric analysis (translation of the title). The {{aim of this}} bibliometric analysis was to examine how many journals from {{the social sciences and}} the sciences published in Austria {{can be found in the}} Journal Citation Reports (JCR). The respective journals were further evaluated as to which academic discipline they pertain, the respective publisher(s), whether they are freely accessible (open access) and in which quartile they can be found in the impact <b>factor</b> <b>ranking.</b> The analysis made it apparent that there are fewer Austrian {{journals in}}cluded in the JCR than in comparable countries. While 551 journals of the Science Edition of the JCR were from Switzerland in 2011, the corresponding number for Austria is only 34. Even Slowenia published more journals (10) in the Social Science Edition in 2011 than Austria (7). Furthermore, most Austrian journals are ranked in the lower quartile of the impact <b>factor</b> <b>ranking.</b> Austrian journals only perform well in the plant sciences. Still, if the impact <b>factor</b> <b>ranking</b> is to be taken as a measure of quality of a journal, Austrian journals overall perform rather poorly. In the sciences half of the journals are published by Springer, while there is no such dominance of any particular publisher in the social sciences. Only few of the journals are open access, one in the social sciences and two in the sciences. This article has been written and the underlying analysis have been performed during a course on bibliometrics, which is part of the post-graduate programme on Library and Information Studies. Therefore, this contribution also aims at demonstrating that such bibliometric analyses are even possible in library education. This should encourage librarians to engage more strongly with similar studies in the discourse not only with colleagues but maybe even in the relevant scientific community...|$|E

To this purpose, we consider fatigue-limit models and random fatigue-limit models that are specially designed to allow {{the treatment of the}} run-outs (right-censored data). We first fit the models to the data by maximum likelihood methods and estimate the quantiles of the life distribution of the alloy specimen.

40|$|While workers' {{safety risk}} {{tolerances}} have {{been regarded as}} a main reason for their unsafe behaviors, {{little is known about}} why different people have different risk tolerances even when confronting the same situation. The aim of this research is to identify the critical factors and paths that influence workers' safety risk tolerance and to explore how they contribute to accident causal model from a system thinking perceptive. A number of methods were carried out to analyze the data collected through interviews and questionnaire surveys. In the first and second steps of the research, factor identification, <b>factor</b> <b>ranking</b> and factor analysis were carried out, and the results show that workers' safety risk tolerance can be influenced by four groups of factors, namely: (1) personal subjective perception; (2) work knowledge and experiences; (3) work characteristics; and (4) safety management. In the third step of the research, hypothetical influencing path model was developed and tested by using structural equation modeling (SEM). It is found that the effects of external factors (safety management and work characteristics) on risk tolerance are larger than that of internal factors (personal subjective perception and work knowledge & experiences). Specifically, safety management contributes the most to workers' safety risk tolerance through its direct effect and indirect effect; while personal subjective perception comes the second and can act as an intermedia for work characteristics.

We present an analysis of different publication venues across the related fields of Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning and Natural Computing amongst others [3], based upon Google Scholar Metrics and journal impact factors. A positive correlation is found between the h 5 -index (2007 - 2011) and impact factors (2010), and an overall ranking of the different venues finds that a number of top conferences in these fields have h 5 -index values equivalent, and in some cases superior to, the fields leading journals.

To ensure that the publications are of acceptable quality, publications found in lesser known journals based on their low impact factor (Franke, et al., 1990) were excluded, after which full texts were obtained by downloading soft copies. Much as journal impact factor is not an absolute measure of the quality of an academic paper, an article with a high impact factor suggests that it has been cited by many researchers, who themselves are prime consumers of the articles (Saha et al., 2003). Rosenstreitch & Wooliscroft, (Rosenstreich and Wooliscroft 2012) critiqued the use of journal impact factor for marketing related researches but their aversion was in relation to “the time lag before citation of marketing articles” and not the relevance of journal impact <b>factor</b> <b>ranking.</b> Faced with the constraints of time and resources, we are of the view that articles from high impact factor journals would be representative of the general academic discourse on CSR in Ghana. Additionally, the use of high impact factor journal solves a criterion challenge as to which articles to include and which to exclude in a more systematic manner. We are also of the opinion that the arguments that might be presented by low impact factor journals, are not likely to be missed, if the review is based largely on high impact factor journals which invariably are the most cited articles.|$|E
40|$|Purpose. The paper proposes: 1) {{determination}} and formulation {{of factors that}} influence the choice of rational method for joining re-bars of vertical support members of reinforced concrete frame; 2) determination of factor parameters; 3) ranging of factors by the expert evaluation (Delphi) method. Methodology. In order to achieve research objectives, {{it is necessary to}} carry out analysis of existent rebar connection methods, determination of factors and parameter variation limits for each of the methods. Performing <b>factor</b> <b>ranking</b> by the expert evaluation method. Findings. The results of the questioning materials of 14 experts in the area of monolithic construction allowed setting the following: when choosing the rational re-bars connections, the most significant values are the factors that define the time parameters: possibility of carcassing, time of joining the re-bars, length of rebar cage, prior operation run time, operation time of main lifting equipment. Herewith the factors that define the rebar cage parameters have a direct relation to the work performance time, as they determine the amount of bar connections in the course of building erection over wide range. Economic factors – rebar connection cost and quality control cost – have the less value. It is obvious that in the conditions of considerable construction expenses it is advantageous for an investor to increase the rebar joining cost for the work growth rate. Structural and technological factors have the least value: origin of eccentric load transmission between re-bars, possibility of use of the thermally work-hardened re-bars of А 500 and higher grades, work category for implementation of works, necessity to use the scaffold and appurtenances for re-enforcement of constructions. The reason is analogical: a contractor is ready to go to complication of technology with the purpose of reduction of the facility erection terms. As the calculated Pearson’s matching criterion χ 2 = 47. 24 is higher than the tabular one (22. 36203), then the obtained concordance coefficient W= 0. 26 is not casual value, and that is why the obtained results make sense and can be used in further researches.
