5|$|Midazolam, {{when taken}} during the third {{trimester}} of pregnancy, may cause risk to the neonate, including benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome, with possible symptoms including hypotonia, apnoeic spells, cyanosis, and impaired metabolic responses to cold stress. Symptoms of hypotonia and the neonatal benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>reported</b> <b>to</b> persist from hours to months after birth. Other neonatal withdrawal symptoms include hyperexcitability, tremor, and gastrointestinal upset (diarrhea or vomiting). Breastfeeding by mothers using midazolam is not recommended.|$|E

5|$|Amanita muscaria {{contains}} several biologically active agents, {{at least}} one of which, muscimol, is known to be psychoactive. Ibotenic acid, a neurotoxin, serves as a prodrug to muscimol, with approximately 10–20% converting to muscimol after ingestion. An active dose in adults is approximately 6mg muscimol or 30 to 60mg ibotenic acid; this is typically about the amount found in one cap of Amanita muscaria. The amount and ratio of chemical compounds per mushroom varies widely from region to region and season to season, which can further confuse the issue. Spring and summer mushrooms <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>reported</b> <b>to</b> contain up to 10 times more ibotenic acid and muscimol than autumn fruitings.|$|E
5|$|Amanita regalis is a {{rare species}} {{typically}} found growing {{on the ground in}} mountainous forests, both deciduous and coniferous. It is a mycorrhizal fungus, and exists in a symbiotic relationship with certain tree species. The system of fine below-ground threads, the mycelium, envelopes the roots of the trees and supplies them with needed minerals, trace elements and water from the soil, while the tree, in turn, supplies the fungus with food from its own supply, which it produces through photosynthesis. A.regalis has been shown experimentally to form mycorrhiza with birch, Scots pine, Mountain pine, and Norway spruce. Fruit bodies <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>reported</b> <b>to</b> grow in fairy rings.|$|E

5|$|Boletus caucasicus, {{found in}} {{southern}} Europe, has yellow flesh in the cap tissue immediately above the tube layer, {{in contrast to}} the reddish colour of the same flesh found in S.luridus. Another European species, Rubroboletus rhodoxanthus, has characteristic pinkish tones in the cap. The Chinese species Neoboletus sinensis, originally described as a form of S.luridus, can be most reliably distinguished from the latter by its larger spores, which <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>reported</b> <b>to</b> be as large as 12–17 by 5.5–7μm. Fruit bodies closely resembling S.luridus have been recorded in Australia, though renamed Boletus barragensis as they differ in spore size and preference for trees of the family Myrtaceae.|$|E
5|$|Given with {{chloroquine}} or quinine, clindamycin {{is effective}} and well tolerated in treating Plasmodium falciparum malaria; the latter combination is particularly useful for children, {{and is the}} treatment of choice for pregnant women who become infected in areas where resistance to chloroquine is common. Clindamycin {{should not be used}} as an antimalarial by itself, although it appears to be very effective as such, because of its slow action. Patient-derived isolates of Plasmodium falciparum from the Peruvian Amazon <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>reported</b> <b>to</b> be resistant to clindamycin as evidenced by in vitro drug susceptibility testing.|$|E
5|$|HSP {{can develop}} after infections with streptococci (β-haemolytic, Lancefield group A), {{hepatitis}} B, herpes simplex virus, parvovirus B19, Coxsackievirus, adenovirus, Helicobacter pylori, measles, mumps, rubella, Mycoplasma and numerous others. Drugs linked to HSP, usually as an idiosyncratic reaction, include the antibiotics vancomycin and cefuroxime, ACE inhibitors enalapril and captopril, anti-inflammatory agent diclofenac, {{as well as}} ranitidine and streptokinase. Several diseases <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>reported</b> <b>to</b> be associated with HSP, often without a causative link. Only in about 35% of cases can HSP be traced {{to any of these}} causes.|$|E

5|$|In {{laboratory}} experiments, octopuses can {{be readily}} trained to distinguish between different shapes and patterns. They <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>reported</b> <b>to</b> practise observational learning, although the validity of these findings is contested. Octopuses have also been observed {{in what has been}} described as play: repeatedly releasing bottles or toys into a circular current in their aquariums and then catching them. Octopuses often break out of their aquariums and sometimes into others in search of food. They have even boarded fishing boats and opened holds to eat crabs. The veined octopus collects discarded coconut shells, then uses them to build a shelter, an example of tool use.|$|E
5|$|Oil {{from the}} flowers was used against catarrhs, colics and, in Germany, earaches, frostbite, eczema and other {{external}} conditions. Topical application of various V.thapsus-based preparations was recommended {{for the treatment}} of warts, boils, carbuncles, hemorrhoids, and chilblains, amongst others. Recent studies have found that great mullein contains glycyrrhizin compounds with bactericide and potential anti-tumoral action. These compounds are concentrated in the flowers. The German Commission E sanctioned medicinal use of the plant for catarrhs. It was also part of the National Formulary in the United States and United Kingdom. The plant's leaves, in addition to the seeds, <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>reported</b> <b>to</b> contain rotenone, although quantities are unknown.|$|E
5|$|The ant is notorious in Tasmania, {{where most}} {{fatalities}} have been recorded. In 2005, {{over a quarter}} of all jack jumper sting incidents were sustained in Tasmania; excessive in comparison to its 2006 population of only 476,000 people. Jack jumper stings are the single most common cause of anaphylaxis in patients at the Royal Hobart Hospital. The ant has also been a major cause of anaphylaxis outside Tasmania, notably around Adelaide and the outskirts of Melbourne, while cases in New South Wales and Western Australia have been more distributed. One in 50 adults <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>reported</b> <b>to</b> suffer anaphylaxis due to the jack jumper or other Myrmecia ants.|$|E

5|$|A {{study in}} 2000 {{found that the}} genetic {{distance}} between jackdaws {{and the other members}} of Corvus was greater than that within the rest of the genus. This led Pamela Rasmussen to reinstate the genus name Coloeus, created by Johann Kaup in 1829, in her Birds of South Asia (2005), a treatment also used in a 1982 systematic list in German by Hans Edmund Wolters. A study of corvid phylogeny undertaken in 2007 compared DNA sequences in the mitochondrial control region of several corvids. It found that the western jackdaw, and the closely related Daurian jackdaw (C.dauuricus) of eastern Russia and China, were basal to the core Corvus clade. The names Coloeusmonedula and Coloeusdauuricus have since been adopted by the International Ornithological Congress in their official list. The two species of jackdaw <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>reported</b> <b>to</b> hybridise in the Altai Mountains, southern Siberia, and Mongolia. Analysis of the mitochondrial DNA of specimens of the two species from their core ranges show them to be genetically distinct.|$|E
5|$|Adverse {{effects from}} {{medications}} {{are reported in}} 10 to 90% of people, depending on how and from whom the data is collected. Most adverse effects are dose-related and mild. Some examples include mood changes, sleepiness, or an unsteadiness in gait. Certain medications have side effects that {{are not related to}} dose such as rashes, liver toxicity, or suppression of the bone marrow. Up to a quarter of people stop treatment due to adverse effects. Some medications are associated with birth defects when used in pregnancy. Many of the common used medications, such as valproate, phenytoin, carbamazepine, phenobarbitol, and gabapentin <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>reported</b> <b>to</b> cause increased risk of birth defects, especially when used during the first trimester. Despite this, treatment is often continued once effective, because the risk of untreated epilepsy is believed to be greater than the risk of the medications. Among the antiepileptic medications, levetiracetam and lamotrigine seem to carry the lowest risk of causing birth defects.|$|E
5|$|All {{nihonium}} isotopes {{are extremely}} unstable and radioactive; however, the heavier nihonium isotopes are {{more stable than}} the lighter. The most stable known nihonium isotope, 286Nh, is also the heaviest confirmed nihonium isotope; it has a half-life of 8seconds. The isotope 285Nh and the unconfirmed 290Nh <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>reported</b> <b>to</b> also have half-lives of over a second. The isotopes 284Nh and 283Nh have half-lives of 1 and 0.1seconds respectively. The remaining two isotopes have half-lives between 0.1 and 100milliseconds: 282Nh has a half-life of 70milliseconds, and 278Nh, the lightest known nihonium isotope, is also the shortest-lived known nihonium isotope, with a half-life of just 1.4milliseconds. It is predicted that even heavier undiscovered nihonium isotopes could be much more stable: for example, 287Nh is predicted to have a half-life of around 20minutes, close to two orders of magnitude more than that of 286Nh.|$|E
