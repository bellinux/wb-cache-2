Brazil was granted 108 patents by the USPTO between 2004 and 2008 and 189 between 2009 and 2013. Although Brazil has registered strong growth in this field, compared to other emerging economies, it seems to be relatively less focused on international patenting than on publications.

[...] However, an <b>economy</b> <b>may</b> achieve productive efficiency without necessarily being allocatively efficient.

30|$|This is {{relevant}} for {{the prediction of}} structural change in today’s highly developed countries (e.g., the USA), where today’s structural change is relatively slow, the services employment share is relatively great, and the agricultural and manufacturing shares are relatively small. Model 2 a states that these <b>economies</b> <b>may</b> experience strong structural change in future and, in particular, they may re-industrialize. 7 Since Model 2 a allows for even stronger (limit) structural change than Model 1 b does, it implies that the future structural change (i.e., {{the changes in the}} manufacturing and services shares) in developed <b>economies</b> <b>may</b> be stronger than the structural change that they experienced over the last 150  years (cf.

500|$|By the 1980s new Keynesian economists became {{dissatisfied}} with these early nominal wage contract models since they predicted that real wages would be countercyclical (real wages would rise {{when the economy}} fell), while empirical evidence showed that real wages tended to be independent of economic cycles or even slightly procyclical. These contract models also did not make sense from a microeconomic standpoint since it was unclear why firms would use long-term contracts if they led to inefficiencies. Instead of looking for rigidities in the labor market, new Keynesians shifted {{their attention to the}} goods market and the sticky prices that resulted from [...] "menu cost" [...] models of price change. The term refers to the literal cost to a restaurant of printing new menus when it wants to change prices; however, economists also use it to refer to more general costs associated with changing prices, including the expense of evaluating whether to make the change. Since firms must spend money to change prices, they do not always adjust them to the point where markets clear, and this lack of price adjustments can explain why the <b>economy</b> <b>may</b> be in disequilibrium. Studies using data from the United States Consumer Price Index confirmed that prices do tend to be sticky. A good's price typically changes about every four to six months or, if sales are excluded, every eight to eleven months.|$|E

The analysis employs a stochastic production frontier function and allows agglomeration economies to enter as inputs and/or as factors reducing inefficiency. Results re-confirm that {{the effects of}} agglomeration economies are industry specific. In our study, the machineries industry benefits from MAR type agglomeration economies and the textiles industry benefits from Jacob’s type agglomeration <b>economies.</b> Agglomeration <b>economies</b> <b>may</b> exercise a twin effect on firms’ productive efficiency. First, {{as in the case of}} the machineries industry in our study, MAR agglomeration <b>economies</b> <b>may</b> act as a new input and affect the kernel of the production frontier. Second, agglomeration <b>economies</b> <b>may</b> act as a factor reducing technical inefficiency with non-neutral effects with labour and capital as in the case of both the machineries and the textiles industries in our study. Finally, it is indicated that agglomeration economies establish a type of â€œpath dependenceâ€ for firms. Firms that make significant use of agglomeration economies survive to the next period at higher percentages in comparison to other firms in the same industry. At the same time, entrants are favoured by MAR type agglomeration economies while incumbents are favoured by Jacob’s type agglomeration economies. ...|$|R

[...] In 2004 the Comoros' real GDP growth was a low 1.9% and real GDP per capita continued to decline.

30|$|In general, we {{show that}} the {{empirical}} regularities (‘stylized facts’) of structural change do not necessarily imply that the structural change in today’s developed economies is near to its end: Some of our models imply that the developed <b>economies</b> <b>may</b> re-industrialize significantly or may be characterized by limit fluctuations of sectoral employment shares in future.|$|R
30|$|Increasing returns {{related to}} {{knowledge}} creation {{have important implications}} for economic growth (Cortright 2001). First of all, opportunities for growth are almost unlimited. <b>Economies</b> <b>may</b> develop by steady improvement of knowledge on how to produce more and better with smaller amounts of physical resources. There are nevertheless some challenges associated with increasing returns. Due to the fact that social benefits and private costs of new knowledge diverge, the right price signals may be absent. Lack of a full excludability of knowledge causes that knowledge providers earn less than the social value of knowledge that they produce which in consequence results in under-investment in knowledge. Property rights are a popular remedy for this drawback, but at the same time, they may hinder further development of technology. Knowledge-based <b>economies</b> <b>may</b> also lead to monopolistic competition where competition is based not on cutting prices but on augmenting product characteristics.|$|R
2500|$|If MNT were realized, some {{resources}} {{would remain}} limited, because unique physical objects are limited (a {{plot of land}} in the real Jerusalem, mining rights to the larger near-earth asteroids) or because they depend on the goodwill of a particular person (the love of a famous person, a live audience in a musical concert). Demand will always exceed supply for some things, and a political <b>economy</b> <b>may</b> continue to exist in any case. Whether the interest in these limited resources would diminish with the advent of virtual reality, where they could be easily substituted, is yet unclear. One reason why it might not is a hypothetical preference for [...] "the real thing", although such an opinion could easily be mollified if virtual reality were to develop to a certain level of quality.|$|E
2500|$|Macdonald and Sirianni (1996) use {{the term}} [...] "emotional proletariat" [...] to {{describe}} service jobs in which [...] "workers exercise emotional labor wherein {{they are required to}} display friendliness and deference to customers." [...] Because of deference, these occupations tend to be stereotyped as female jobs, independent of the actual number of women working the job. According to Macdonald and Sirianni (1996), because deference is a characteristic demanded of all those in disadvantaged structural positions, especially women, when deference is made a job requirement, women are likely to be overrepresented in these jobs. Macdonald and Sirianni (1996) claim that [...] "n no other area of wage labor are the personal characteristics of the workers so strongly associated with the nature of the work." [...] Thus, according to Macdonald and Sirianna (1996), although all workers employed within the service <b>economy</b> <b>may</b> have a difﬁcult time maintaining their dignity and self-identity due to the demands of emotional labor, such an issue may be especially problematic for women workers.|$|E

For my part, I cannot pretend to speak upon it with clearness or with decision; but certainly this arrangement would be more than sufficient for Wales. My original thought was, to suppress five of the eight judges; and to leave the chief-justice of Chester, with the two senior judges; and, to facilitate the business, to throw the twelve counties into six districts, holding the sessions alternately in the counties of which each district shall be composed.

And when some chieftain, famous in political warfare, adventures into the region of letters or of science, in full confidence that the methods which have brought fame and honour in his own province will answer there, he is apt to forget that he will be judged by these people, on whom rhetorical artifices have long ceased to take effect; and to whom mere dexterity in putting together cleverly ambiguous phrases, and even the great art of offensive misrepresentation, are unspeakably wearisome. And, if that weariness finds its expression in sarcasm, the offender really has no right to cry out. Assuredly ridicule is no test of truth, but it is the righteous meed of some kinds of error.

There is, however, among these separate departments one which can not be passed over in silence, being of a more comprehensive and commanding character {{than any of the other}} branches into which the social science may admit of being divided. Like them, it is directly conversant with the causes of only one class of social facts, but a class which exercises, immediately or remotely, a paramount influence over the test. I allude to what may be termed Political Ethology, or the theory of the causes which determine the type of character belonging to a people or to an age. Of all the subordinate branches of the social science, this is the most completely in its infancy. The causes of national character are scarcely at all understood, and the effect of institutions or social arrangements upon the character of the people is generally that portion of their effects which is least attended to, and least comprehended. Nor is this wonderful, when we consider the infant state of the science of Ethology itself, from whence the laws must be drawn, of which the truths of political ethology can be but results and exemplifications.|$|E
