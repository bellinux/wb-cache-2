5000|$|Phenotypic Integration is {{the term}} used to {{describe}} when multiple functionally-related traits are correlated with each other. [...] Complex phenotypes often require multiple traits working together in order to function properly. Phenotypic integration is significant because it provides an explanation as to how phenotypes are sustained by relationships between traits. Every aspect of an organism is created so that the role it plays overall is performed harmoniously with all its other parts. Every organism's phenotype is integrated, organized, and a functional whole. Integration is also associated with functional modules. Modules are complex character units that are tightly associated, such as a flower. It is hypothesized that organisms with high correlations between traits in a module have the most efficient functions. The fitness of a particular value for one phenotypic trait frequently depends {{on the value of}} the other phenotypic traits, making it important for those traits evolve together. One trait can have a direct effect on fitness, and {{it has been shown that}} the correlations among traits can also change fitness, causing these correlations to be adaptive, rather than solely <b>genetic.</b> <b>Integration</b> can be involved in multiple aspects of life, not just at the genetic level, but during development, or simply at a functional level. Integration can be caused by genetic, developmental, environmental, or physiological relationships among characters. Environmental conditions can alter or cause integration, i.e. they may be plastic. Correlational selection, a form of natural selection can also produce integration. At the genetic level, integration can be caused by pleiotropy, close linkage, or linkage disequilibrium among unlinked genes. At the developmental level it can be due to cell-cell signaling such as in the development of the ectopic eyes in Drosophila. It is believed that the patterns of genetic covariance helped distinguish certain species. [...] It can create variation among certain phenotypes, and can facilitate efficiency. This is significant because integration may play a huge role in phenotypic evolution. Phenotypic integration and its evolution can not only create large amounts of variety among phenotypes which can cause variation among species. For example, the color patterns on Garter snakes range widely and are caused by the covariance among multiple phenotypes.|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Most genetic {{studies of}} {{population}} differentiation {{are based on}} gene-pool frequencies. Population differences for gene associations that show up as deviations from Hardy-Weinberg proportions (homologous association) or gametic disequilibria (non-homologous association) are disregarded. Thus {{little is known about}} patterns of population differentiation at higher levels of <b>genetic</b> <b>integration</b> nor the causal forces. Results To fill this gap, a conceptual approach to the description and analysis of patterns of genetic differentiation at arbitrary levels of <b>genetic</b> <b>integration</b> (single or multiple loci, varying degrees of ploidy) is introduced. Measurement of differentiation is based on the measure Δ of genetic distance between populations, which is in turn based on an elementary genic difference between individuals at any given level of <b>genetic</b> <b>integration.</b> It is proven that Δ does not decrease when the level of <b>genetic</b> <b>integration</b> is increased, with equality if the gene associations at the higher level follow the same function in both populations (e. g. equal inbreeding coefficients, no association between loci). The pattern of differentiation is described using the matrix of pairwise genetic distances Δ and the differentiation snail based on the symmetric population differentiation Δ SD. A measure of covariation compares patterns between levels. To show the significance of the observed differentiation among possible gene associations, a special permutation analysis is proposed. Applying this approach to published genetic data on oak, the differentiation is found to increase considerably from lower to higher levels of integration, revealing variation in the forms of gene association among populations. Conclusion This new approach to the analysis of genetic differentiation among populations demonstrates that the consideration of gene associations within populations adds a new quality to studies on population differentiation that is overlooked when viewing only gene-pools. </p...|$|E

Integrase-mediated recombination resulted in proper targeting of parasite proteins to intra-erythrocytic compartments, including the apicoplast, a plastid-like organelle.

40|$|SYNOPSIS. The {{different}} forms of morphological integration, develop-mental, functional, genetic, and evolutionary are defined and their theo-retical relationships explored. Quantitative genetic models predict that the co-selection of traits involved in a common function will lead to pleio-tropic effects at the loci affecting them while functionally-unrelated traits {{will be affected by}} separate sets of loci (Wagner, 1996). The patterns of genetic variation produced by these pleiotropic mutations and stabilizing selection for functionally and developmentally interacting traits results in their specific co-inheritance relative to other traits. This in turn leads to their co-ordinated response to selection. Therefore, functional and devel-opmental integration lead to <b>genetic</b> <b>integration</b> which, in turn leads to evolutionary integration.

Recent endeavors in the development of selective Ad vectors that target cells or tissues of interest and spare the alteration of all others have focused on the modification of the virus broad natural tropism.

The archaebacterium, a thermoacidophil resembling extant Thermoplasma, generated hydrogen sulfide to protect the eubacterium, a heterotrophic swimmer comparable to Spirochaeta or Hollandina that oxidized sulfide to sulfur. Selection pressure for speed swimming and oxygen avoidance led to an ancient analogue of the extant cosmopolitan bacterial consortium "Thiodendron latens.

40|$|ABSTRACT In {{species with}} {{separate}} sexes, antagonistic selection on {{males and females}} (intralocus sexual conflict) {{can result in a}} gender load that can be resolved through the evolution of sexual dimorphism. We present data on intralocus sexual conflict over immune defense in a natural population of free-ranging lizards (Uta stansburiana) and discuss the resolution of this conflict. Intralocus sexual conflict arises from correlational selection between immune defense and orange throat coloration in these lizards. Males with orange throats and high antibody responses had enhanced survival, but the same trait combination reduced female fitness. This sexual antagonism persisted across the life-cycle and was concordant between the juvenile and adult life stages. The opposing selective pressure on males and females is ameliorated by a negative intersexual genetic correlation (rm,f =- 0. 86) for immune defense. Throat coloration was also genetically correlated with immune defense, but the sign of this genetic correlation differed between the sexes. This resulted in sex-specific signaling of immunological condition. We also found evidence for a sex-specific maternal effect on sons with potential to additionally reduce the gender load.

40|$|The {{results of}} genetic fine {{structure}} experiments, {{performed on the}} amiA locus of Pneumococcus are summarized. The peculiar feature of transformation genetics is that a given donor marker mutation transforms with an efficiency characteristic of the mutated site. In spite of this difficulty, mapping procedures have been devised and quantitative recombination studies performed. It is concluded from these studies that transformation, in this locus, is the consequence of frequent, and essentially random exchanges occurring between donor DNA and the chromosomal DNA of the recipient cell. The average length of uninterrupted donor DNA polynucleotide strand which could be inserted into the chromosome of a transformed cell is estimated, from genetic data, to be probably not greater than 3 · 105 daltons (for a double-stranded insertion). It is proposed, {{on the basis of}} genetic evidence, that following essentially random exchanges between donor DNA and recipient chromosome, a revision process, specific for certain types of mutated sites, occurs. The revision process appears to remove preferentially donor DNA sequences from the primary recombinant structure, and allow repair along the chromosomal template, leading to low efficiency in the <b>genetic</b> <b>integration</b> of these sites.
