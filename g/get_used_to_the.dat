5|$|During {{the two-week}} hiatus between games four and five, the Canadians visited Sweden and played two {{exhibition}} games versus the Swedish national team. The Team Canada management {{had arranged for}} the visit to Sweden to <b>get</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> bigger ice surfaces in Europe, and stopping in Sweden would provide some rest for Team Canada before resuming the series in Moscow. The games took place on September 16 and September 17 at the Johanneshovs Isstadion arena in Stockholm. Canada won game one 4–1; the second game was a 4–4 tie. The first exhibition game introduced Canada to the two West German referees, Josef Kompalla and Franz Baader. These two referees would figure prominently in games six and eight of the Canada-Russia series.|$|E
5|$|With funding {{provided}} by the Fitch and the Jamaica Tourist Board, training was conducted in Canada and Austria {{in preparation for the}} 1988 Winter Olympics. Sepp Haidacher was recruited as a coach, and the team began to be featured in North American media with a comical angle. An agreement was reached with the Fédération International de Bobsleigh et de Tobogganing in order to allow for entrance in both the four-man and the two-man events at the Games. Once in Calgary, the team conducted test runs on a frozen lake in order to <b>get</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> conditions, but Allen fell and was injured. Chris Stokes, who was only in Canada in order to support his brother Dudley, was added to the four-man team three days before the first run having never been in a bobsleigh before.|$|E

The contest between the San Diego Chargers and the New Orleans Saints was played at Wembley Stadium in London on October 26, with New Orleans winning 37–32. The Chargers played at Buffalo the week beforehand on October 19 so they could immediately travel to London afterward in order to <b>get</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> time difference.|$|E
25|$|Personality {{differences}} between Barry and Colin causes friction in their relationship. Having been imprisoned in 1983 for motor theft, Barry gets involved in crime again in 1986 under Nick Cotton's (John Altman) influence. This goes against Colin's morals {{and he is}} invariably left to clean up Barry's blunders. When Dot Cotton (June Brown) discovers Colin and Barry are in a relationship, she worries they will infect her with AIDS. Her rumours evoke hostility from {{some members of the}} community but gradually, they <b>get</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> idea of having gay neighbours and Barry is relieved when his older brother, Graham (Gary Webster), gives his blessing too.|$|E

25|$|Alam {{was picked}} {{to play against}} England in 2010 and {{wanted to make the}} most of his {{opportunity}} to get picked for the two upcoming tours and then be selected for the 2011 Cricket World Cup. He also stated that he had played a little bit of club cricket in England to help him <b>get</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> english conditions and to train for the tour. Alam scored well in the first two matches but his major break came in the third One-Day International when he increased his top score to 64. He then retained his place for the ODI series against South Africa in the UAE. After scoring 123 runs in the 5 match series, he was subsequently dropped from the ODI team and later that year, lost his place in the T20 team after the tour to New Zealand.|$|E
25|$|Zoey came to {{live with}} the Mileses shortly after she was born. Zoey's mother, a captive-bred {{orangutan}} named Lucky, didn't know how to care for her new baby, having never seen it done in the wild. As a result, little Zoey had to be placed in the care of Mrs. Miles, a primatologist at the zoo, and the only character with the time and patience to be Zoey's foster parent. Molly tries her hardest to <b>get</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> new family member, even making Zoey her current-events project for school, but after having her homework destroyed and her mother's time taken up by the baby orangutan she gives up and begins desperately wanting things to be normal again. After Zoey ingests a bottle of shampoo and has to be rushed to the hospital, Molly learns what it truly means to be a big sister and to care about Zoey, no matter how much trouble she causes.|$|E
25|$|There are {{a number}} of reasons for low sales outside Japan. One main reason is that it takes some time for the {{customers}} to <b>get</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> idea of a washlet. Sales in Japan were also slow when the device was introduced in 1980, but after some acclimatization, sales improved significantly starting in 1985. Around 1990, 10% of Japanese households had a washlet, and this number increased greatly to over 50% in 2002. Toto expects a corresponding improvement in foreign sales within the next few years. Another reason is the lack of a power supply near the toilet. While virtually all Japanese washrooms have an electric outlet behind the toilet, many foreign bathrooms do not have a nearby outlet. In Australia, New Zealand, Ireland, the UK, and many other countries, high current electrical outlets installed in close proximity to water, or where persons may be wet, are prohibited by legally enforced codes due to health and safety reasons. Finally the outlet of the toilet (for S-type toilets) is max. 10 ~ 15cm from back wall but Japanese toilets need it to be at least 30cm so a S-type European toilet cannot be replaced easily with a Japanese toilet. They are also much more expensive than traditional Western toilets. Finally, in Europe, there is the competition of the traditional Western bidet; conversely, North Americans are not accustomed to any sort of bidet.|$|E
50|$|Nativ numbers fell 30% {{with the}} North American {{recession}} in 2008-2009 {{along with other}} gap year programs, but recovered in 2009-2010 from 80 to 95 students. David Keren of United Synagogue Youth said that people were <b>getting</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> financial crisis and that Nativ conducted aggressive marketing.|$|R

500|$|Critics {{had mixed}} {{feelings}} about the Naga Epic, with many believing the price was too high. Rich Brown of CNet said the mouse does not warrant the high price tag and awarded it an overall rating of 7.3/10. The reviewers at PC Magazine thought the Epic was expensive, but commended the mouse's attractiveness and wireless feature. Mathew McCurley of Engadget commended the long-lasting battery and the wireless capability of the mouse and stated that [...] "if you're interested in trying something new, give it a shot." [...] He said that {{it takes time to}} <b>get</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> design and feel.|$|E
500|$|The {{scene in}} which Jeffrey Spender visited his mother, Cassandra Spender, was shot in Los Angeles. Those members of The X-Files crew who had moved with the show from Vancouver to Los Angeles still had {{problems}} adjusting to the changes when filming an episode. They were forced to adjust {{to changes in the}} sunlight, since Vancouver had this [...] "dark and gray feel" [...] compared to California's sunny atmosphere. Kim Manners said that it was difficult to <b>get</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> new area of filming. This episode marks the first time new stock footage was used for the J.

500|$|In the {{beginning}} {{it took me a}} little while to <b>get</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> new idea of the sound, not having any screaming vocals and stuff like that.

There's always going to be some haters, but you can't be loved by everyone. Opeth has always been about not repeating ourself. A lot of people don't think Heritage is metal but I think it's metal to go somewhere people don't expect. It doesn't mean we're not embracing the past sound of Opeth.|$|E
500|$|Vaughn Watson of The Providence Journal hailed [...] "Speechless" [...] as Invincibles [...] "best song, {{and one of}} Jackson's finest of any album". He {{added that}} with the song, the {{musician}} acknowledged the pain that accompanies isolation. In a review of Invincible, The Wichita Eagle stated that [...] "Speechless", [...] "Don't Walk Away" [...] and [...] "Cry" [...] were among the [...] "sincere ballads" [...] in which Jackson was exemplary. Ada Anderson of The Ball State Daily News expressed the view that [...] "Speechless" [...] would become a popular song, and writers for the South Florida Sun-Sentinel stated that the ballad would take time to <b>get</b> <b>used</b> <b>to.</b> <b>The</b> Dayton Daily News Ron Rollins described the track as a [...] "pretty love song". Music critic Kevin C. Johnson thought that [...] "Speechless" [...] was [...] "one of [...] typical, whispery ballads that swells as it moves along". A journalist for The Olympian stated that the song was [...] "gorgeous".|$|E
500|$|The US tour {{started on}} 20 November at the Cow Palace in San Francisco. The group were nervous about playing Quadrophenia after the British tour, {{especially}} Moon. Before the show, {{he was offered}} some tranquillisers from a fan. Just after the show started, the fan collapsed and was hospitalised. Moon's playing, meanwhile, became incredibly erratic, particularly during Quadrophenia where {{he did not seem}} to be able to keep time with the backing tapes. Towards the end of the show, during [...] "Won't Get Fooled Again", he passed out over his drumkit. After a 20-minute wait, Moon reappeared onstage, but after a few bars of [...] "Magic Bus", collapsed again, and was immediately taken to hospital. Scot Halpin, an audience member, convinced promoter Bill Graham to let him play drums, and the group closed the show with him. Moon had a day to recover, and by the next show at the Los Angeles Forum, was playing to his usual strength. The group began to <b>get</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> backing tapes, and the remainder of gigs for the US tour were successful.|$|E

500|$|DJ Hero has {{received}} positive reviews from the gaming press, who consider the title as a fresh restart {{of the music}} genre given {{the large number of}} titles based on guitar play. The turntable peripheral was considered to be well designed {{to meet the needs of}} the game. The unit's weight, size, and shape, and ability to cater to both left- and right-handed players was commended. Many reviewers noted a need to alter the action of the crossfader, either by having better physical feedback to the player to indicate the center of the knob's track, or by reducing the width of the track to better handle the rapid crossfade maneuvers. Reviewers also noted that there was a certain weight to the turntable portion of the controller which made scratching imprecise, particularly with the inner blue button where only minimal torque can be applied. The learning curve of the game across the various mixes was highly commended by reviewers for helping players to <b>get</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> new controller. When progressing from [...] "Medium" [...] to [...] "Hard" [...] and [...] "Expert" [...] levels and encountering more complex mixes, reviewers thought the game felt transformed, bringing a difficult but more rewarding experience to the player as they begin emulating every part of a real DJ's motions. Johnny Minkley of Eurogamer considered that while the learning curve is steep, with the [...] "Easy" [...] difficulty being [...] "less thrilling and engaging" [...] compared to Guitar Hero, the game was [...] "structured fabulously to nudge you gradually closer to the summit" [...] with each successive career set and difficulty mode. Cam Shae of IGN Australia felt that the changes in [...] "Hard" [...] mode over [...] "Medium" [...] were somewhat excessive, introducing both more crossfade effects and button-pressing, and felt these could have been introduced separately in [...] "Hard" [...] and [...] "Expert" [...] modes. [...] Richard Li of 1UP.com noted that the inability to fail a song is both [...] "a bane and a boon"; newer players would not feel frustration at trying to <b>get</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> controller and would be able to quickly unlock all the sets in the game's career mode, but without knowing where they failed, they would not have an idea of where they need to hone their skills to improve their performance at the game. The omission of a practice mode was noted by Daemon Hatfield of IGN, believing it would help in some of the more complex mixes by the DJ celebrities. Reviewers believed that the small faults in DJ Hero can be easily fixed for potential sequels.|$|E
500|$|Mouton's first {{competitive}} {{run in the}} Quattro in Monte Carlo ended {{before it}} had even begun. She withdrew from the event before the start due to apparent engine problems. The team later discovered that dirt had got into the fuel system. At the Rally Portugal, she started her long partnership with the Italian co-driver Fabrizia Pons. Mouton won seven stages and took a career-best fourth place, despite suffering from electronic problems. This ended criticism of Audi for signing a female driver. After a retirement due to a broken camshaft in the Tour de Corse, Mouton set several fastest times at the Acropolis Rally in Greece. While Mikkola was leading and Mouton fifth, the stewards excluded the Quattros citing homologation infractions. Although Audi protested, the stewards upheld the decision. In her debut in the high-speed 1000 Lakes Rally in Finland, Mouton {{found it hard to}} <b>get</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> rhythm changes. She recorded a few top-ten stage times and finished 13th. She was satisfied with her performance, and the local newspaper Keskisuomalainen described her debut as successful. At the Rallye Sanremo in Italy, a mixed surface event with tarmac and gravel, Mouton took the lead when the local star Michele Cinotto crashed and held off Henri Toivonen and Ari Vatanen to take the victory. This marked the first time a female driver had won a world championship event in rallying. Mouton's male rivals were left speechless. Earlier during the weekend, Vatanen had been confident: [...] "Never can nor will I lose to a woman." [...] Mouton recalled her debut win in a 2008 interview for RallySport Magazine: ...|$|E
500|$|Kubrick was {{notorious for}} {{demanding}} multiple takes during filming to perfect his art, and his relentless approach was often extremely demanding for his actors. Jack Nicholson remarked that Kubrick would often demand up to fifty takes of a scene. Nicole Kidman {{explains that the}} large number of takes he often required stopped actors from consciously thinking about technique, thereby helping them enter a [...] "deeper place". Kubrick's high take ratio was considered by some critics as [...] "irrational", although he firmly believed that actors were at their best during the filming, as opposed to rehearsals, due to the sense of intense excitement that it generates. Kubrick explained: [...] "Actors are essentially emotion-producing instruments, and some are always tuned and ready while others will reach a fantastic pitch on one take and never equal it again, no matter how hard they try"... "When you make a movie, it takes a few days just to <b>get</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> crew, because it is like getting undressed in front of fifty people. Once you're accustomed to them, the presence of even one other person on set is discordant and tends to produce self-consciousness in the actors, and certainly in itself". He also told biographer Michel Clement: [...] "It's invariably because the actors don't know their lines, or don't know them well enough. An actor can only do one thing at a time, and when he learned his lines only well enough to say them while he's thinking about them, he will always have trouble as soon as he has to work on the emotions of the scene or find camera marks. In a strong emotional scene, it is always best to be able to shoot in complete takes to allow the actor a continuity of emotion, and it is rare for most actors to reach their peak more than once or twice. There are, occasionally, scenes which benefit from extra takes, but even then, I'm not sure that the early takes aren't just glorified rehearsals with the adding adrenaline of film running through the camera." ...|$|E
