This confinement was favorable and essential to form a strong inverse electric field at the P 3 HT/PEO+LiCF 3 SO 3 interface during pulse width, which was related to de-doping of the semiconducting layer. Input frequency modulated timing of doping, de-doping, and re-doping to result in synaptic-like frequency selectivity, i.e., depression at low frequency stimulation and potentiation at high stimulation.

50|$|Dissimilar {{metals and}} alloys have {{different}} electrode potentials, and when two or more come into contact in an electrolyte, one metal acts as anode and the other as cathode. If the electrolyte contains only metal ions that are not easily reduced (such as Na+, Ca2+, K+, Mg2+, or Zn2+), the cathode reaction is reduction of dissolved H+ to H2 or O2 to OH−. The electropotential difference between the reactions at the two electrodes {{is the driving force}} for an accelerated attack on the anode metal, which dissolves into the electrolyte. This leads to the metal at the anode corroding more quickly than it otherwise would and corrosion at the cathode being inhibited. The presence of an electrolyte and an electrical conducting path between the metals is essential for galvanic corrosion to occur. The electrolyte provides a means for <b>ion</b> <b>migration</b> whereby ions move to prevent charge build-up that would otherwise stop the reaction.|$|E
50|$|In electrochemistry, {{concentration}} polarization denotes {{the part of}} the polarization of an electrolytic cell resulting from changes in the electrolyte concentration due to the passage of current through the electrode/solution interface. Here polarization is understood as the shift of the Electrochemical potential difference across the cell from its equilibrium value. When the term is used in this sense, it is equivalent to “concentration overpotential”. The cause of the changes in concentration (emergence of concentration gradients in the solution adjacent to the electrode surface) is the difference in the rate of electrochemical reaction at the electrode and the rate of <b>ion</b> <b>migration</b> in the solution from/to the surface. When a chemical species participating in an electrochemical electrode reaction is in short supply, the concentration of this species at the surface decreases causing diffusion, which is added to the migration transport towards the surface {{in order to maintain the}} balance of consumption and delivery of that species.|$|E
50|$|Several {{resonator}} configurations are possible, {{in addition}} to the classical way of directly attaching leads to the crystal. E.g. the BVA resonator (Boîtier à Vieillissement Amélioré, Enclosure with Improved Aging), developed in 1976; the parts that influence the vibrations are machined from a single crystal (which reduces the mounting stress), and the electrodes are deposited not on the resonator itself but on the inner sides of two condenser discs made of adjacent slices of the quartz from the same bar, forming a three-layer sandwich with no stress between the electrodes and the vibrating element. The gap between the electrodes and the resonator act as two small series capacitors, making the crystal less sensitive to circuit influences. The architecture eliminates the effects of the surface contacts between the electrodes, the constraints in the mounting connections, and the issues related to <b>ion</b> <b>migration</b> from the electrodes into the lattice of the vibrating element. The resulting configuration is rugged, resistant to shock and vibration, resistant to acceleration and ionizing radiation, and has improved aging characteristics. AT cut is usually used, though SC cut variants exist as well. BVA resonators are often used in spacecraft applications.|$|E

40|$|The {{anomalous}} hysteresis {{is reported}} in photo current density-voltage (J-V) curves of perovskite solar cells. The origins responsible for hysteresis are primarily attributed to ferroelectricity, trapping/de-trapping, and <b>ions</b> <b>migration.</b> Meanwhile, a switchable photovoltaic effect is disclosed in lateral structure perovskite solar cells, where a p-i-n structure is formed after poling the device with a reverse bias. Considering the normal sandwiched structure of perovskite solar cells, i. e. the intrinsic perovskite layer {{is situated in}} an electric field built by p-type (Spiro-OMeTAD) and n-type (TiO 2) layers, the poling process also works in such devices. The <b>migration</b> of <b>ions</b> will induce a new electric field with opposite direction as inherent built-in electric field.

The anomalous hysteresis observed on J-V curves is explained based on the insight of <b>ions</b> <b>migrations</b> under bias voltage. The external applied voltage presents significant influence on the stability of solar cells.

5000|$|Ionic polymer-metal {{composites}} (IPMCs) are synthetic composite nanomaterials {{that display}} artificial muscle behavior under an applied voltage or electric field. IPMCs {{are composed of}} an ionic polymer like Nafion or Flemion whose surfaces are chemically plated or physically coated with conductors such as platinum or gold. Under an applied voltage (1-5 V for typical 10mmx40mmx0.2mm samples), <b>ion</b> <b>migration</b> and redistribution due to the imposed voltage across a strip of IPMCs result in a bending deformation. If the plated electrodes are arranged in a non-symmetric configuration, the imposed voltage can induce all kinds of deformations such as twisting, rolling, torsioning, turning,twirling, whirling and non-symmetric bending deformation. Alternatively, if such deformations are physically applied to an IPMC strips they generate an output voltage signal (few millivolts for typical small samples) as sensors and energy harvesters. IPMCs are a type of electroactive polymer. They work very well in a liquid environment {{as well as in}} air. They have a force density of about 40 in a cantilever configuration, meaning that they can generate a tip force of almost 40 times their own weight in a cantilever mode. IPMCs in actuation,sensing and energy harvesting have a very broad bandwidth to kilo HZ and higher. IPMCs were first introduced in 1998 by Shahinpoor, Bar-Cohen, Xue, Simpson and Smith (see references below) but the original idea of ionic polymer actuators and sensors goes back to 1992-93 by Adolf, Shahinpoor, Segalman, Witkowski, Osada, Okuzaki, Hori, Doi, Matsumoto, Hirose, Oguro, Takenaka, Asaka and Kawami as depicted below: ...|$|E
