In rural water systems managed by private operators in 2004 the water tariffs per <b>jerrycan</b> of 20 liters varied between 14 and 25 Rwandan Franc (RWF), equivalent to about 2.5 to 4.5 US cents per gerrycan or US$1.25 – 2.25 per cubic meter, according to the Utilities Regulatory Agency.|$|E
25|$|Various {{low-cost}} options {{can be made}} {{to facilitate}} hand washing where tap-water and/or soap is not available e.g. pouring water from a hanging <b>jerrycan</b> or gourd with suitable holes and/or using ash if needed in developing countries (see Substance section too).|$|E
25|$|Hand washing, {{also known}} as hand hygiene, is the act of {{cleaning}} one's hands {{for the purpose of}} removing soil, dirt, and microorganisms. This may be done with or without the use of water, other liquids, or soap. In situations where tap water and soap is not available other options include pouring water from a hanging <b>jerrycan</b> or gourd or using ash instead of water.|$|E

25|$|In {{fiscal year}} 2006–2007, the NWSC tariff for {{domestic}} use was US$0.64 per cubic metre. Taken {{from a public}} standpipe, the tariff was US$0.42 per cubic metre or less than US$0.01 per <b>jerrycan.</b> The average commercial tariff was US$1.00 per cubic metre. For commercial users, a rising block tariff structure was used. A customer who {{was connected to the}} sewerage system would pay an additional charge of 75-100 percent. Although water is cheapest at standpipes, UN-Water reports that in this case users usually have to pay the costs of operating a stand tap and thus in the end pay more. A cross subsidy arrangement enables NWSC to keep in operation systems that do not cover operation and maintenance costs.|$|E
500|$|Most {{resources}} in the game are scarce except for gasoline, which is needed for driving. The player can collect one <b>jerrycan</b> at a time, storing {{it in the back}} of the Magnum Opus, and can find collectibles (history relics) throughout the game. The relics are primarily photos and notes of the wasteland before the apocalypse. Food and water are vital to Max's survival; the player can collect them in the wasteland and use them to replenish their health. Max can also eat small animals, such as rodents, and maggots from decomposing corpses, to replenish his health, and areas where he can find food and supplies have crows flying around them. The player can venture into the Big Nothing, an uncharted, volatile area of the wasteland with dangerous sandstorms and no food or water in which rare parts for the Magnum Opus can be found. According to Avalanche, due to the [...] "Big Nothing", the game's map is infinite. A dynamic day-night cycle, a weather system and a variety of environmental hazards are included in the game, whose terrain is affected by weather and natural disasters.|$|E

50|$|The 2006 Atlas Creek {{pipeline}} explosion was {{a disaster}} that occurred on 12 May 2006 at Atlas Creek Island (sometimes called Isanki Island), near Lagos, Nigeria, when a pressurised petrol pipeline that had been ruptured by thieves exploded, killing 150 people. The Nigerian Red Cross said that vandals had originally drilled holes into the pipe to steal fuel, and that local people had then come down with <b>jerrycans</b> to fill them with fuel.

Protected from [...] "legal responsibility" [...] in the country ("a seed-bed {{at the bottom of}} a hole in Dobruja"), the creature raises an entire badger colony: some he eats raw, with lemon; the others, once they have turned sixteen, he rapes [...] "without the smallest qualm of conscience." [...] The seed-bed is where Ismaïl also interviews job applicants, received on the condition that they hatch him [...] "four eggs each". The process is supported by his [...] "chamberlain" [...] Turnavitu, who exchanges love letters with the applicants. Ismaïl's actual residence is kept a secret, but it is presumed that he lives, sequestered from [...] "the corruption of electoral mores", in an attic above the home of his grotesquely disfigured father, only to emerge in a ball gown for the yearly celebration of plaster. He then offers his body to the workers, in hopes of thus resolving [...] "the labor issue". Whereas Ismaïl has once worked as an air fan for [...] "dirty Greek coffee houses" [...] in the Lipscani quarter, Turnavitu has a past in [...] "politics": he was for long the government-appointed air fan at the fire precinct kitchen. Ismaïl has spared Turnavitu a life of near constant rotation, remunerating his services: the seed-bed interviews, the ritualized apologizes to the leashed badgers, the praise of Ismaïl's fashion sense, and the swabbing of canola over Ismaïl's gowns. Their relationship breaks down as Turnavitu, returning from the Balearic Islands in the form of a <b>jerrycan,</b> passes the common cold to Ismaïl's badgers. Sacked from his job, he contemplates suicide ("not before seeing to the extraction of four canines in his mouth"), and hurls himself into a pyre made up of Ismaïl's dresses; the patron falls into depression and [...] "decrepitude", retreating to his seed-bed for the rest of his own life.|$|E
