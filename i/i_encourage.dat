500|$|Nabil Elderkin {{directed}} the music video for the song. In a behind-the-scenes video, Mars explained, [...] "The {{concept of the}} video is my struggle, to tell this girl I'd do anything for her, so I'm going as far as dragging a piano {{to get to her}} just so I can sing my heart out." [...] Mars, sarcastically, replied to rumors related to the use of special effects: [...] "A lot of people think this is a camera trick, but that is a heavy piano. Luckily, I’ve been doing about, you know, 800 to 967 push-ups every day, so it’s not a big deal, I can handle it." [...] Regardless, this achievement, Mars was cautious: [...] "The actions in this video serve as a metaphor, and should not be taken literally. I am aware of the power of visual media, and <b>I</b> <b>encourage</b> everyone who watches this video to understand that it is an artistic interpretation of the song, and not something to imitate".|$|E

60|$|Harris said <b>I</b> <b>encouraged</b> him. <b>I</b> didn’t <b>encourage</b> him. A dog {{like that}} don’t want any encouragement. It’s the natural, {{original}} sin that is born in him {{that makes him}} do things like that.|$|R

2500|$|Heller opposed President Donald Trump's 2017 {{executive}} order {{to impose a}} temporary ban on entry to the U.S. to citizens of seven Muslim-majority countries, saying: [...] "I agree that better vetting and border protection measures are necessary to our current immigration system. That’s why I support the thorough vetting of individuals entering our country. However, I am deeply troubled {{by the appearance of}} a religious ban. The use of an overly broad {{executive order}} {{is not the way to}} strengthen national security. <b>I</b> <b>encourage</b> the Administration to partner with Congress to find a solution." ...|$|E

She also participates in charitable events {{to help raise}} funds for various organizations. She has performed to help raise funds for the [...] "N.C. Children's PROMISE" [...] to benefit the Children's Hospital on Nov. 12, 2006, to help refurbish the Hurricane Katrina-damaged NFL Youth Education Towns Boys & Girls Club of New Orleans on December 16, 2006, visited St. Jude Children's Research Hospital on January 12, 2007, and visited Pennington Elementary School on February 1, 2007. [...] "When you're able {{to give back to}} your communities and organizations like St. Jude, it's a great thing," [...] Pickler said. [...] "It's been a great experience, and <b>I</b> <b>encourage</b> anyone and everyone to help." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{film was}} labeled [...] "crude and tasteless" [...] {{by members of}} Japanese {{parliament}} and other government officials after the film was screened for them before its general release. The film created a debate over government action on media violence. At one point, director Kinji Fukasaku allegedly gave a press statement directed at {{the age group of}} the film's characters, saying [...] "you can sneak in, and <b>I</b> <b>encourage</b> you to do so." [...] Many conservative politicians used the film to blame popular culture for a youth crime wave. Ilya Garger of TIME magazine said that Battle Royale received [...] "free publicity" [...] and received [...] "box-office success usually reserved for cartoons and TV-drama spin-offs." [...] The Japanese reaction to the film in the early 2000s has been compared to the British outrage over A Clockwork Orange in the early 1970s. Critics note the relation of Battle Royale to the increasingly extreme trend in Asian cinema and its similarity to reality television.|$|E

2500|$|In November 2013, he {{was named}} GQs [...] "Rapper of the Year," [...] and was {{featured}} {{on the cover of}} the magazine's [...] "Men of the Year" [...] issue. During the interview, he stated that he would begin recording his second major-label studio album in January 2014. Following the issue's release, TDE's CEO Anthony [...] "Top Dawg" [...] Tiffith pulled Kendrick Lamar from performing at GQs party that accompanies the issue, calling out writer Steve Marsh's profile, [...] "Kendrick Lamar: Rapper of the Year," [...] for its [...] "racial overtones." [...] GQ editor-in-chief Jim Nelson responded with the following statement: [...] "Kendrick Lamar is one of the most talented new musicians to arrive on the scene in years. That's the reason we chose to celebrate him, wrote an incredibly positive article declaring him the next King of Rap, and gave him our highest honor: putting him on the cover of our Men of the Year issue. I'm not sure how you can spin that into a bad thing, and <b>I</b> <b>encourage</b> anyone interested to read the story and see for themselves." ...|$|E

60|$|He {{talks of}} going into Parliament, for Percy is of too {{energetic}} a nature to rest content with a life of perfect idleness. Lady Desborough, Ada, and <b>I</b> <b>encourage</b> him in the idea, and, of course, prophesy great things of him.|$|E
6000|$|And {{you will}} make a {{beautiful}} grand lady, quiescent and [...] dignified as a grand lady ought to be. At any rate it [...] would be impossible that I should remain here. Tom is bad [...] enough, but {{to be told that}} <b>I</b> <b>encourage</b> him is more than I [...] can bear.|$|E

"My {{wife has}} no rival in the zenana. <b>I</b> <b>encourage</b> {{her to go}} about, as our mother did, {{to look after the}} affairs of the house, to sit at table with me, and to be my companion, and not a mere plaything.

I doubt he will not succeed, for I do not much approve his manner; but the scheme is Mr. Secretary St. John's and mine, and would have done well enough in good hands. I recommended him to a printer,(19) whom I sent for, and settled the matter between them this evening. Harrison has just left me, and I am tired with correcting his trash.|$|E

6000|$|... "Don't despond," [...] said Carton, very gently; [...] "don't grieve. <b>I</b> <b>encouraged</b> Doctor Manette in this idea, because I {{felt that}} it might one day be consolatory to her.

6000|$|The {{chief officer}} of the Russia (a capital fellow) was at the Reading last night, and Dolby {{specially}} charged him with the care of you and yours.

Dolby has insane projects of getting over here to meet you; so amiably hopeful and obviously impracticable, that <b>I</b> <b>encourage</b> him to the utmost. The regular little captain of the Russia, Cook, is just now changed into the Cuba, whence arise disputes of seniority, etc. I wish he had been with you, for I liked him very much when I was his passenger.

For myself <b>I</b> <b>encourage</b> it. It's that that makes my music what it is. It's that that inspires me. I composed that Naga dance I just played over to you, Elma. But not all out of my own head. I couldn't have invented it. It comes down in our blood, my dear, to you and me alike. We both inherit it from a common ancestress." ...|$|E
60|$|Letter Writing.--When eligible, <b>I</b> <b>encourage</b> {{the men to}} write, and myself, {{when called}} upon, write all sorts of letters for them (including love letters, very tender ones.)

M. de F., of the 17th Connecticut, company H, has just come up (February 17th) from Windmill point, and is {{received}} in ward H, Armory-square. He is an intelligent looking man, has a foreign accent, black-eyed and hair'd, a Hebraic appearance. Wants a telegraphic message sent to his wife, New Canaan, Conn.
