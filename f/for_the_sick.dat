5|$|Germany invaded Poland in {{the early}} morning of 1 September 1939. The British Cabinet met late that morning and issued a warning to Germany that unless it withdrew from Polish {{territory}} Britain would carry out its obligations to Poland. When the House of Commons met at 6:00pm, Chamberlain and Labour deputy leader Arthur Greenwood (deputising <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>sick</b> Clement Attlee) entered the chamber to loud cheers. Chamberlain spoke emotionally, laying the blame for the conflict on Hitler.|$|E
5|$|Prayer {{features}} {{prominently in}} services. Services may feature moments where special prayer is offered, often with laypersons leading the prayer {{and the rest}} of the congregation audibly participating. During these corporate prayers, some may pray in tongues. While not in every service, the pastor will pray <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>sick.</b> This prayer may include the pastor anointing the sick with olive oil and with the assistance of church elders along with pastoral associates laying hands on the one seeking healing.|$|E
5|$|Although Æthelwig {{was known}} for his loyalty to King William, he had an uncle who held land at Witton who died {{fighting}} for King Harold Godwinson, probably at the Battle of Stamford Bridge. While abbot, even after the Conquest, Æthelwig continued to build and ornament his abbey in the Anglo-Saxon style, not the Norman Romanesque which was being used in many of the other churches and abbeys. Besides his administrative and legal duties, Æthelwig {{was known for}} his care <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>sick</b> and the poor, as well as lepers. After the Harrying of the North by King William in 1069–1070, Æthelwig offered shelter to refugees from the ravaged areas. The Chronicon states that Æthelwig offered aid to the refugees because of his charitable nature, but it is possible that it was also part of his royal duties in western England.|$|E

5|$|During the Sun Dance, {{which is}} practiced by many Plains Indian tribes, the eagle is {{represented}} in several ways. The eagle nest {{is represented by the}} fork of the lodge where the dance is held. A whistle made from the wing bone of an eagle is used {{during the course of the}} dance. Also during the dance, a medicine man may direct his fan, which is made of eagle feathers, to people who seek to be healed. The medicine man touches the fan to the center pole and then to the patient, in order to transmit power from the pole to the patient. The fan is then held up toward the sky, so that the eagle may carry the prayers <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>sick</b> to the Creator.|$|E
5|$|In late 1775, Benjamin Church, the Director General, {{assigned}} McKnight to the Putnam House building, {{one of six}} hospitals of the army's Hospital Department in Cambridge, Massachusetts.

The Continental Army lost the battle, and the British took Fort Washington and Fort Lee, which pushed Washington's ragged army south toward New Jersey in December 1776, which {{set the stage for the}} Battle of Trenton.|$|E
5|$|Of its seven sacraments the Eucharist is the {{principal}} one, celebrated liturgically in the Mass. The church teaches that through consecration by a priest the sacrificial bread and wine become the body and blood of Christ. Virgin Mary is venerated in the Catholic Church as Mother of God and Queen of Heaven, honoured in dogmas and devotions. Its teaching includes sanctification through faith and evangelisation of the Gospel and Catholic social teaching, which emphasises support <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>sick,</b> the poor, and the afflicted through the corporal and spiritual works of mercy. The Catholic Church is the largest non-government provider of {{education and health care}} in the world.|$|E

5|$|Oswaldo Payá {{was born}} on 29 February 1952 in Cerro, Havana. The fifth of seven children, he was brought up as a Roman Catholic and {{attended}} a Marist Brothers school in Havana. Payá was the only student at the school who refused to join the Communist League following the Cuban Revolution. The school was later closed. In 1969, {{he was sentenced to}} three years of hard labor on Isla de Pinos when he refused to transport political prisoners during his mandatory military service. While there, he discovered a locked Catholic church, Nuestra Señora de Dolores, that received permission from the Bishop of Havana to reopen as a mission, giving religious talks and caring <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>sick.</b>|$|E
5|$|The Russo-Japanese War {{had caused}} rising dissent {{throughout}} the Russian Empire, including its Polish provinces. On 26 January 1905 about 6,000 workers in Łódź {{took part in}} a large strike. Next day, a general strike was declared, and the day after that, 70,000 workers were on strike. They demanded an 8-hour work day and support <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>sick.</b> Some worker demonstrations were joined by the students, who demanded an end to the policy of Russification. Another large strike occurred during the Labor Day on 1 May. It affected close to half of the city's industry. On 3 May, the anniversary of the Polish May Constitution, another demonstration with patriotic undertones took place. On 30 May, Łódź's industrialists asked the Russian governor-general for help.|$|E
5|$|The {{origins of}} the Knights Hospitaller are unclear, but the order {{probably}} emerged around the 1070s in Jerusalem. It started as a religious order which cared <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>sick,</b> and later looked after pilgrims to the Holy Land. After {{the success of the}} First Crusade in capturing Jerusalem in 1099, many crusaders donated their new property in the Levant to the Hospital of St John. Early donations were in the newly formed Kingdom of Jerusalem, but over time the order extended its holdings to the Crusader states of the County of Tripoli and the Principality of Antioch. Evidence suggests that in the 1130s the order became militarized when Fulk, King of Jerusalem, granted the newly built castle at Beth Gibelin to the order in 1136. A papal bull from between 1139 and 1143 may indicate the order hiring people to defend pilgrims. There were also other military orders, such as the Knights Templar, which offered protection to pilgrims.|$|E

5|$|A typical early 19th-century casual ward was {{a single}} large room {{furnished}} {{with some kind of}} bedding and perhaps a bucket {{in the middle of the}} floor for sanitation. The bedding on offer could be very basic: the Poor Law authorities in Richmond in the mid-1840s provided only straw and rags, although beds were available <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>sick.</b> In return for their night's accommodation vagrants might be expected to undertake a certain amount of work before leaving the next day, such as at Guisborough, where men were required to break stones for three hours and women to pick oakum, two hours before breakfast and one after. Until the passage of the Casual Poor Act 1882 vagrants could discharge themselves before 11 am on the day following their admission, but from 1883 onwards they were required to be detained until 9 am on the second day. Those who were admitted to the workhouse again within one month were required to be detained until the fourth day after their admission.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the most}} common {{constituents}} of a medieval meal, either as part of a banquet or as a small snack, were sops, pieces of bread with which a liquid like wine, soup, broth, or sauce could be soaked up and eaten. Another common sight at the medieval dinner table was the frumenty, a thick wheat porridge often boiled in a meat broth and seasoned with spices. Porridges were also made of every type of grain and could be served as desserts or dishes <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>sick,</b> if boiled in milk (or almond milk) and sweetened with sugar. Pies filled with meats, eggs, vegetables, or fruit were common throughout Europe, as were turnovers, fritters, doughnuts, and many similar pastries. By the Late Middle Ages biscuits (cookies in the U.S.) and especially wafers, eaten for dessert, had become high-prestige foods and came in many varieties. Grain, either as bread crumbs or flour, was also the most common thickener of soups and stews, alone or in combination with almond milk.|$|E
5|$|Singing was {{sporadic}} and in {{a cappella}} or occasionally there would be singing in tongues. There were periods of extended silence. Attenders were occasionally slain in the Spirit. Visitors gave their testimony, and members read aloud testimonies that {{were sent to the}} mission by mail. There was prayer for the gift of tongues. There was prayer in tongues <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>sick,</b> for missionaries, and whatever requests were given by attenders or mailed in. There was spontaneous preaching and altar calls for salvation, sanctification and baptism of the Holy Spirit. Lawrence Catley, whose family attended the revival, said that in most services preaching consisted of Seymour opening a Bible and worshippers coming forward to preach or testify as they were led by the Holy Spirit. Many people would continually shout throughout the meetings. The members of the mission never took an offering, but there was a receptacle near the door for anyone that wanted to support the revival. The core membership of the Azusa Street Mission was never much more than 50–60 individuals with hundreds and thousands of people visiting or staying temporarily over the years.|$|E

25|$|There is {{debate between}} {{scholars}} {{as to why}} these institutions were started by the church.
