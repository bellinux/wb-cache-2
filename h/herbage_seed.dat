40|$|Trifolium repens L. (white clover) is an {{important}} component of New Zealand’s pastoral and <b>herbage</b> <b>seed</b> industries. It has delicate shallow roots vulnerable to drought and pest attack. T. uniflorum is a wild species, adapted to dry environments, with deep woody roots but poor vegetative growth and only 1 - 3 florets per head. Hybridization was done to incorporate the drought tolerance and root characteristics of T. uniflorum into white clover. The primary hybrids (F 1 and BC 1 F 1) showed poor seed production. The project aimed to analyse this problem and improve seed production by further hybridization and selection. The hybrids expressed high variation for almost all seed production traits. Heads per plant, florets per head and seeds per floret were important determinants with moderate to high heritabilities. The derived traits seeds per head, florets per plant and seeds per plant expressed low-moderate to moderate heritabilities. Flowering pattern showed high heritability. No negative correlations between seed production and root traits were found. Whereas nodes per stolon favoured head production, stolon production had a negative effect on nodes per stolon. No negative associations between head production, persistence and foliage production of the hybrids were observed. No cytoplasmic influences were evident. The hybrids showed, higher self fertility and a wider gap between potential and actual seed yield than white clover. The BC 1 F 1 generation produced low numbers of heads per plant and seeds per floret. Intercrossing coupled with recurrent selection improved variation, fertility and realization of potential seed yield. The second backcrossed and intercrossed generations had high seeds per floret and plant. Backcrossing of selected hybrids effectively recovered the white clover phenotype and created new variation. The BC 2 F 1 and BC 3 F 1 generations expressed the better head production ability of T. uniflorum combined with the bigger head size of white clover. Seed production capability of the hybrids was successfully restored. More genetic variation was created in the hybrids for future breeding and selection endeavours...|$|E

40|$|The {{simultaneous}} {{selection for}} yield of <b>herbage</b> and <b>seed</b> in Setaria sphacelata (Schumach.) Stapf and Hubbard ex Moss was studied, {{and the amount}} of variation present for each of these traits in relation to various plant characteristics was assessed in a spaced plant population and its open-pollinated progeny. When comparing tillers at a similar stage of growth, a high in vitro digestibility was found for those tillers that originated from early-heading plants characterized by short length, light weight and narrow leaves. Comparisons of whole plants at 3 periods of regrowth revealed a negative correlation between in vitro digestibility and dry-matter yield. The variation found for in vitro digestibility was not repeated under sward conditions. Plants with a high yield of clean seed were early-heading and large-sized. Of the three seed components studied, number of heads had the largest influence on seed yield. A high yield of clean seed did not necessarily mean a high yield of germinating seeds. Simultaneous selection for <b>herbage</b> and <b>seed</b> yield could be carried out through selection for seed yield only, because of the high genotypic correlation between the two traits and the higher response expected from selection for seed yield. Selection indices should take into account time of head emergence and fresh weight of the plant at seed harvest time when selection was carried out after flowering. For selection before flowering, the index should include number, length and weight of tillers. The testing of plants in a monoculture at wide spacing and in a sward of another species were compared. When comparing lax, prostrate and erect growth habits, the erect-growing plant type proved to be the most productive and to have the highest competitive ability under the management applied.

Presentation and interpretation of simulation results can be significantly enhanced through the linking of models with software that allows spatial visualization. Many users of crop simulation models, however, are located in institutions in developing countries where resources are particularly limited. Computer software to perform a variety of spatial analyses was written, which can be run on modest hardware without the need for costly third-party software. The software is an integral part of the Decision Support System for Agrotechnology Transfer (DSSAT), a comprehensive crop simulation model and data system, but can also be run in a stand-alone mode. Users can run spatial simulation experiments and then analyze the results using (i) a geostatistical module to interpolate maps and produce probability surfaces from a network of data points and (ii) a utility that calculates agronomic and economic output statistics from model simulations and maps the results as polygons. The suite of modules, which runs on an IBM-compatible personal computer, interfaces with some widely used third-party GIS software, and the mapping facility enables users to export and import images to a number of common file formats.

40|$|The {{place of}} {{grassland}}s {{in the economy}} of New Zealand is paramount. Consequently grassland seeds must and do {{play a vital role}} in the agricultural industry. Increasing land values and soaring costs make it imperative that our farms are sown with seed of the highest quality. On many farms seed production is only considered as secondary to the production of meat and milk. It is only in seasons when stock feed is abundant that many areas are closed for the production of seed. It would be to the advantage of the seed industry if grass seed production was viewed more as a primary consideration with stock grazing being employed to assist in the management of the seed crop rather than the present 'catch' crop system employed on many farms. This system would also help to reduce the large annual fluctuation in national seed production. <b>Herbage</b> <b>seed</b> production in this country amounts to about 18, 000 tons annually although fluctuations in this figure do occur (1967 20, 370 tons, 1968 17, 430 tons, 1969 18, 770 tons, 1970 14, 880 tons). In 1970 seed exports represented a total value of over $ 7 million, of which approximately $ 0. 7 million was obtained from the export of perennial ryegrass seed. In recent years a number of grassland workers have carried out studies on various aspects of seed development and production. Despite this, however, much work still remains to be done before the physiological processes underlying seed production are fully understood. Some of these workers have found it necessary to study the position and contribution of individual tillers to seed production. In comparison, studies of the factors influencing anthesis, fertilisation and seed maturation have been somewhat neglected. The production of a large number of head-producing tillers, each bearing large numbers of florets is obviously not enough. A high percentage of these florets must undergo anthesis, be effectively fertilised and ultimately develop to maximum seed weight and germination capacity if the potential yield of the crop is to be fully realised. This suggests that seed yield might be considerably increased if the conditions required at each of these stages were more fully understood. During the late summer, autumn and winter tillers grow vegetatively and it is not until the spring that those tillers destined to produce heads actually begin reproductive development. It is at this time that the first contribution to total seed yield occurs, viz. the number of reproductive tillers per unit area. Ear development continues until shortly before ear emergence at which point the number of florets per head is fixed. Subsequently, anthesis, pollination and fertilisation follow to determine the seed-set component of total yield. Finally the seeds develop and mature to determine the final yield component-seed weight...|$|E

In a choice 60;cafeteria 61; and no choice feeding trial, geese consumed 30 % less herbage containing the selected endophyte than the endophyte-free ryegrass <b>herbage.</b> In a <b>seed</b> feeding trial, the geese did not discriminate on first exposure between the endophyte-free seed and that containing the selected endophytes. However, on day two there was an 80 % rejection of the seed containing the selected ryegrass/endophyte compared to the endophyte-free seed. The same rejection of 80 % was observed after a 3 -month endophyte-free feeding period, suggesting the rejection was a long-term, learned response or post-digestion feedback. The authors suggest continued research into this area will be of benefit in producing a living deterrent to birds by habitat modification. Learned-behavior response has been well documented in the past as the way forward. Farming grass/endophyte associations may add to mankind’s armory of bird-control methodology...|$|R
40|$|This project {{evaluated}} {{the integration of}} goats into sheep and cattle grazing systems as a permanent herbaceous weed control tool. Foraging behaviour of goats grazing pasture with no access to browse was monitored in Experiment 1. A selection index {{was used to determine}} degrees of effort for selection or avoidance of plant species. Although most of the grazing time was spent on herbage species, no effort was made to select them, whereas moderate to strong efforts were made to select weeds. Selection index varied with season of the year. Goats preferred taller vegetation and grazed above 10 cm from the ground whenever possible, though they took 70 % of their bites from below the top of the sward, regardless of organ selected. Experiment 2 consisted of feeding known numbers of weed and <b>herbage</b> <b>seeds</b> to goats and recovering them to assess destruction and viability. On average, 92 % of the viable seeds were destroyed, with up to 72 hours for complete excretion. The effects of goat and cattle grazing on the structure and competitiveness of swards against weed invasions were studied in Experiment 3. A pasture competitiveness index (PCI) was calculated using structural attributes of a sward resulting from goat and cattle grazing alone and in combinations, under hard and lax grazing severities. The sward was denser, leafier, more uniform, and covered the soil more thoroughly (greater PCI) with increasing participation of goats in the treatments, especially because of severe treading damage caused by cattle contrasting with no damage from goats. The PCI explained 93 % of the variation in weed seedling density. The effect of pasture surrounding thistle rosettes on their consumption by goats was investigated in Experiment 4. Thistle rosettes that were exposed by clipping the adjacent sward were severely defoliated by goats, while rosettes surrounded by the sward were only nibbled or not eaten at all. Grazing management, economics, and drawbacks of using goats for herbaceous weed control are discussed. Integration of goats into grazing systems can result in a more desirable botanical composition, more uniform and competitive sward, reduced weed control costs, greater herbage utilisation, and better pasture quality...|$|R

40|$|The most {{economically}} important virus infecting {{subterranean clover}} within pastures in Australia is subterranean clover mottle virus (SCMoV) which is transmitted by trampling and grazing of stock, on mower blades, on {{the wheels of}} vehicles and through seed. SCMoV was originally discovered in 1979 in plots of subterranean clover at Karridale in south-west Australia. Subsequently, infection was shown to be common in high rainfall pastures in Western Australia, Tasmania, South Australia, New South Wales and Victoria. It was also found naturally infecting some other cultivated annual clovers, and wild annual clovers, such as cluster clover. Diseased clover plants show obvious symptoms consisting of leaf mottling, leaf distortion, decreased leaf size and plant stunting.

In addition, {{an attempt was made}} to describe more fully phenotypic variation in a Ruzi grass population, an aspect which may provide information useful for a future plant breeding programme in this species. Phenotypic variation in Ruzi grass was investigated under plastic house conditions where minimum and maximum temperatures were set at 20 C and 30 C respectively. The seed used was from a commercial seedlot obtained from Thailand. Single plant measurements were made during the vegetative stage (herbage production and tiller development, growth form, plant height, canopy width, leaf width, leaf hairiness, ligule colour, and stem colour) and during the reproductive stage (date of first flower initiation, tiller numbers at harvest, and development of inflorescences). Erect and semi-erect plants had significantly higher herbage production than prostrate plants but failed to show significant differences in tiller numbers. Seed yield was unaffected by plant growth form. Other parameters such as ligule colour, stem colour, leaf width and hairiness also showed considerable variation from plant to plant. However there was little evidence they were linked to any particular plant growth form. Management practices for <b>herbage</b> and <b>seed</b> production, particularly in terms of defoliation, time of closing and nitrogen fertilizer application were studied in miniature swards in a plastic house at 20 C and 30 C (night and day temperature). These swards were established in wooden bins each with 49 seedlings at a 15 cm square spacing. In a complete randomised block design, the treatments comprised a combination of cutting frequencies viz. at 20, 35, 50 and 65 cm height and cutting intensities viz, 4 and 12 cm stubble height, with 3 replications. This experiment was designed to determine the most appropriate defoliation management practice for Ruzi grass "pasture", and to provide a reasoned justification for the defoliation strategy adopted in subsequent studies. Differences in cutting intensity between 4 cm (hard) and 12 cm (lax) had no significant effect on total plant dry matter, but under lax cutting plants produced significantly greater leaf dry matter and a higher leaf:stem ratio. Despite this, herbage quality was not significantly different mainly due to the longer cutting interval under hard cutting conditions resulting in plants producing bigger leaves and a significantly higher LAI compared with lax cutting. Although plants in the longer cutting frequency treatment had a significantly higher LAI than with more frequent cutting, the greater proportion of stem had a major effect in lowering herbage quality. The overall assessment of the data from the defoliation treatments concluded that the most appropriate defoliation management for a Ruzi sward was 12 - 35 cm i. e. cutting when the canopy reached a height of 35 cm down to 12 cm. This was the defoliation strategy subsequently employed in studies on the management of Ruzi swards for <b>herbage</b> and <b>seed</b> production. The effects of nitrogen and "closing date" (cessation of cutting) on <b>herbage</b> and <b>seed</b> production of Ruzi grass, were examined under three nitrogen levels viz. 50, 150 and 250 kg N/ha and three closing dates viz. early (24 th March 1997), medium (7 th April 1997) and late (21 st April 1997) with 3 replications in a complete randomised block design. The experiment was conducted in "miniature swards" as previously described. Herbage dry matter production prior to closing increased progressively with increasing levels of nitrogen supply. This nitrogen effect continued to produce significantly higher herbage production (250 kg N/ha) even after seed harvest, but {{there were no significant differences}} between 50 and 150 kg N/ha. Different closing dates did not cause similar effects to nitrogen application, simply because plant growth rate declined with the approach of the reproductive stage. This was particularly evident in medium and late closing treatments. However, as expected, the earlier the closing date the higher the amount of herbage dry matter yield obtained after seed harvest. This was mainly contributed by both new vegetative and old reproductive tillers. Nitrogen application up to 150 kg/ha increased seed yield mainly by increasing total and harvested ripe inflorescence density, total floret numbers, and seed numbers. However nitrogen had no effect on percentage seed set or seed weight. Early and medium closing dates produced significantly greater seed yields than the late closing date mainly through an effect on total and harvested ripe inflorescence density, seed numbers, seed weight. Closing date had no effect on percentage seed set, but early closing resulted in greater inflorescence size (floret numbers/inflorescence). The interaction of nitrogen level and closing date suggested that higher nitrogen supply (150 kg N/ha) and early closing increased the percentage of pure germinating seed, suggesting that this is the most appropriate management for enhancing seed quality and yield. The final experiment in this study was established to determine the effects of different levels of water stress applied at different stages of reproductive development on seed yield, yield components and seed quality in Ruzi grass. Individual plants were grown in 10 litre pots filled with potting mixture. Three levels of water stress were imposed (control (nil), mild and severe) at three different reproductive development stages (floral initiation, ear emergence and full flowering). The response of plants to different levels of water application were clearly shown in terms of physiological and morphological changes particularly when these applications were continued throughout the entire reproductive development stage. Although the higher the amount of water applied the greater the dry matter produced, in terms of reproductive development, there was relatively little difference between non stressed and mild stressed plants. Under severe stress, however, although plants developed inflorescences, they were unable to exsert to full ear emergence. Generally, the stage of plant development and level of water stress applied had a bearing on plant dry matter, seed yield and seed yield components...|$|R
40|$|To obtain {{detailed}} information of sowing density and defoliation intensity under more controlled conditions on <b>herbage</b> production and <b>seed</b> yield, Paraggio medic was grown on raised-beds located outdoors at the Waite Agricultural Research Institute. A split split randomised block design was used. Treatments comprised three sowing rates (densities) : Low (3 kg/ha), Medium (15 kg/ha) and High (75 kg/ha) (based on pure germinating seed which gave 75, 375 and 1875 seedlings/m 2 respectively); four defoliation intensities: Con-trol (undefoliated), Low (6 cm from ground level), Medium (4 cm) and High (2 cm) to simulate different grazing pressures and two defoliation systems of continuous (defolia-tion from June 1) and deferred (defoliation from June 29). The total combination for experimental blocks was:Main plots, defoliation systems (2) x Sub plots. sowing densities (3) x Sub-sub plots defoliation intensities (4) x Blocks (4) = 96 micro plots. The continuous defoliation system produced significantly higher (P< 0. 05) available forage {{as well as}} total pasture production (P< 0. 05) than the deferred. High sowing rate increased (P< 0. 01) for-age availability and total pasture production. Medium and high defoliation intensities significantly (P< 0. 01) reduced available forage and total pasture production in the de-ferred defoliation system. Seed production was adversely affected by defoliation intensity...|$|R
40|$|The aims of {{this study}} were to develop a genetic linkage map of {{perennial}} ryegrass, identify quantitative trait loci (QTL) for <b>herbage</b> and <b>seed</b> production traits, and to identify DNA markers associated with QTL for use in marker-assisted selection (MAS). Major traits identified for herbage production were leaf elongation rate (LER), leaf lamina length (LL), tiller number (TN) and tiller weight (TW), and for increased seed production were seed yield per head (SdYH), reproductive tiller number (RT), reproductive tillers with matured heads (TMH), florets per head (FH), spikelets per head (SH), florets per spikelet (FS), floret site utilization (FSU) and seed weight (TSW). A genetic linkage map spanning 582 centimorgans (cM) was constructed with EST-SSR (simple sequence repeat markers derived from expressed sequence tags) and used to identify QTL for herbage dry weight (DW) and seed yield per plant (SdYP), and their key component traits. Significant genotype by environment effects were encountered for herbage yield, with fewer QTL identified in spring than in autumn. For some traits, ranking of genotypes differed greatly between seasons and different QTL were identified. QTL for DW were identified on linkage groups (Lg) 1 and 6. The QTL on Lg 6 co-located with QTL for TN, while that on Lg 1 co-located with LER and LL. Markers at Lg 1 QTL (qDW- 03 - 1. 1) may be more useful for increasing herbage production by MAS because selection for high LER and long LL has been suggested to increase herbage production in perennial ryegrass. QTL for SdYP were identified on Lg 2 and Lg 6. The QTL on Lg 6 co-located with QTL for SdYH, FSU and TSW, while that on Lg 2 co-located with FH, SH and FS. For seed production, markers at Lg 6 QTL (qSdYP- 03 - 6) may be very useful because this QTL co-located with QTL for SdYH, FSU and TSW, and SdYH has been identified previously as a key selection criterion for increasing seed yield. Marker-trait validation confirmed markers pps 0495 and pps 0698 identified by QTL analysis to be potentially useful for selecting for fast leaf appearance and long LL, respectively, in perennial ryegrass...|$|R
40|$|Subterranean clover (Trifolium subterraneum) is an {{important}} component of Mediterranean dryland pasture ecosystems, such as in the south-west of Western Australia, where it is utilised as a winter annual pasture that provides nitrogen as well as disease breaks for rotational crops. Necrotrophic soil-borne fungal pathogens dominate Mediterranean ecosystems because of the ease of survival of these pathogens on infested residues over the dry summer period, and because of low levels of microbial competition in the impoverished and nutrient-defi cient soils characteristic of these regions that predisposes plants to root diseases. In addition to <b>herbage</b> and <b>seed</b> yield losses from soil-borne fungal and nematode pathogens, changes in botanical composition, in the number of regenerating plants, their persistence, and factors affecting feed quality are signifi cantly affected. Further, where the causal organisms of the diseases on subterranean clover are also common on other rotational crops, the impact of these soilborne pathogens appears far wider in Mediterranean ecosystems than previously considered. Under these conditions, soil-borne pathogens pose a serious threat to the productivity of this self-seeding pasture legume, to the extent that reseeding may become necessary. Pathogens such as Phytophthora clandestina, various Pythium species particularly Pythium irregulare, Aphanomyces sp., Rhizoctonia solani, one or more Fusarium species, Phoma medicaginis and Cylindrocarpon didymium are of concern, as are the nematode parasites from the genera Meloidogyne, Heterodera, Pratylenchus, Trichodorus and Radopholus. In this ecosystem, root pathogens operate together as disease complexes and the challenge therefore has been to source host genotypes with resistance to multiple pathogens. In addition to plant nutrition, environmental factors, in particular rainfall (soil moisture) and soil temperature, have a marked effect on both the disease severity caused by individual pathogens and on the interactions that occur between the different root pathogens. Approaches to disease control in this region include a range of management strategies. Cultural control strategies, including manipulation of grazing and rotations, offer some benefi ts. Manipulation of soil fertility also offers scope as this can enhance root physiology related to host resistance, overall plant growth and vigour, and also to improve the effective biological buffering against the pathogens. Fungicide treatments and manipulation of management practices may have a place in an integrated control system incorporating cultivars with useful resistance to root diseases. Clearly, host resistance offers the most cost-effective, long-term control, especially as resistance to several of these soil-borne pathogens has been identifi ed. The Mediterranean Basin, which is the centre of origin of this pasture legume, {{has proved to be a}} productive source of resistance to soil-borne necrotrophic pathogens and is likely to be a source of new subterranean clover cultivars...|$|R
