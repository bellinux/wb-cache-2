5000|$|As mentioned, {{positive}} resist {{exposure to}} radiation changes the chemical structure such that it becomes a liquid or more soluble. These changes in chemical structure are often rooted in the cleavage of specific linkers in the polymer. Once irradiated the [...] "decomposed" [...] polymers can be washed away using a <b>developer</b> <b>solvent</b> leaving behind the polymer that was not exposed to light. This type of technology allows the production of very fine stencils for applications such as microelectronics. [...] In order to have these types of qualities, positive resist utilize polymers with labile linkers in their back bone that can be cleaved upon irradiation or using a photo-generated acid to hydrolyze bonds in the polymer. A polymer that decomposes upon irradiation to a liquid, or more soluble product {{is referred to as}} a positive tone resist. Common functional groups that can be hydrolyzed by photo-generated acid catalyst include polycarbonates and polyesters.|$|E
40|$|Exposure of {{polymethylmethacrylate}} (PMMA) during {{electron beam}} lithography (EBL) produces small polymer fragments that dissolve rapidly during the development process. The resist dissolution behavior varies greatly depending {{on the nature of}} the <b>developer</b> (<b>solvent)</b> and therefore influences the selection of the EBL parameters, such as dose (sensitivity). A molecular scale examination of the development process is necessary to elucidate the resist-developer interaction mechanisms. In this work, the authors investigate the interaction of short PMMA chains (containing up to 10 MMA units) with common developer components methyl isobutyl ketone (MIBK) and isopropyl alcohol (IPA). For this purpose, the authors conduct molecular dynamics simulations using the Accelrys Materials Studio package. The simulation results were used to characterize the mixtures in the spirit of the Flory-Huggins theory of polymers and also to extract the diffusivities. The authors found that the behavior of PMMA fragments differed considerably in MIBK as compared with IPA. PMMA fragments containing more than three monomers exhibit stronger attractive interaction with MIBK. For all fragment sizes simulated, the diffusivity of PMMA fragments is 60 - 160 higher in MIBK as well. Similarly, the authors observed differences in the gyration radii. The authors conclude that the kinetic factor seems to be more significant as compared to affinity factor when accounting for differences in exposure sensitivities due to developer selection.

40|$|The {{swelling}} {{behavior of}} SU- 8 is studied. It {{is well known}} that negative resist swells under the influence of common processing liquids, <b>developers,</b> <b>solvents,</b> etc. However, when SU- 8 is used as a construction material for plating molds, or for permanent structures, for instance in microfluidics or as active mechanical components in the MEM structure, a more quantitative investigation is needed. In this paper, the volume change is measured when the SU- 8 epoxy is submersed in common processing liquids. An analytical model is derived to link the diffusion mechanism to the mechanical response of the SU- 8 material. Using the obtained model, the diffusion constants are calculated from the mechanical displacement measurements. Also, the derived model can be used for the prediction of the mechanical behavior of SU- 8 structures in the future. The swelling behavior is also correlated with the internal stresses that exist in the SU- 8 film. This helps to understand crack formation and delamination of SU- 8 patterns during processing. The results show that the built-in stress in the SU- 8 epoxy is strongly dependent on the ambient or submersion liquid and that this effect in itself is strongly dependent on the softbake procedure of the polymer. The built-in stress in SU- 8 was found to be maximum when submersed in propylene glycol methyl ether acetate and in isopropyl alcohol, both liquids that are used during the development, and found to be very low in water. status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|Silver halide {{solvents}} {{are commonly}} used in the first developer of a reversal process to obtain brighter highlights and a higher effective speed. An investigation was carried out {{to determine the effect}} of a low and high level of solvent on the sensitometric char acteristics as well as the covering power, granularity, modulation transfer function (MTF) and the information storage capacity of Plus-X reversal film 7276. The investigation was designed such that the only variable in the systems studied was the first developer. D- 67, i. e., D- 19 containing two grams liter^- 1 of potassium thiocyanate, was chosen as the high <b>solvent</b> first <b>developer.</b> D- 19 with twenty-five grams liter^- 1 of sodium sulfite, designated D 19 - 25 in this investigation, was the low <b>solvent</b> first <b>developer.</b> Four systems were studied: 1) negative images developed in a low <b>solvent</b> <b>developer</b> (D 19 - 25) 2) positive images developed in D- 19 using a low <b>solvent</b> first <b>developer</b> (D 19 - 25) 3) negative images developed in a high <b>solvent</b> <b>developer</b> (D- 6 7) 4) positive images developed in D- 19 using a high <b>solvent</b> first <b>developer</b> (D- 67) The information storage capacity for each system was calculated from the signal to noise ratio across the spatial frequency range of zero cycles mm^- 1 to twenty-five cycles mm^- 1. The signal to noise ratio was determined from the gamma value of the D-log H curves, the MTF and the Wiener spectrum ordinate value derived from the granularity. Comparisons between the systems were made for each parameter as well as the information storage capacity. The comparisons were made two different ways: 1) at equal densities and 2) at equal exposures. No significant differences attributable to the solvent were found in the granularity, MTF and the information storage capacity when the ccmparisons were made at density levels of 0. 50, 1. 00 and 1. 50 above base plus fog. Differences were seen in the covering power of each system. Slower speed and dark highlights, as evidenced in the positive D-log H curves, were obtained using D 19 - 25 as the first developer. In creasing the exposure to compensate for the lower speed would not correct the dim highlights. This indicated that perhaps a more viable comparison could be made at equal exposure levels. Differences were observed in the covering power, granularity and information storage capacity when the comparisons were made at equal exposure levels. The covering power did not appear to influence the information storage capacity results since the trends were not the same. The covering power of the D- 67 negative system was lower than the D 19 - 25 negative system due to solution-physical development effects. The covering power of the positive systems were not different. The covering power values obtained for the positive systems were about forty- five percent higher than the covering power values. The granularity affected the information storage capacity re sults the most. As the granularity increased across the exposure range the amount of information detected decreased. Larger dif ferences were observed between the positive systems than the negative systems. Positive images developed in D- 67 showed cleaner highlights, i. e., a lower D_min. level on the D-log H curve, a higher effective speed, about a ten percent decrease in granularity and an increase of about eighteen percent in the information storage capacity. Processing in a high <b>solvent</b> first <b>developer</b> provided a distinct advantage over development in a low <b>solvent</b> <b>developer</b> in terms of the parameters investigated in this study...|$|R
40|$|Chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) and {{methylchloroform}} (MCF) {{have been}} widely used in the electronics industry for many decades. However, the growing concern regarding their ozone depletion properties has demanded possible ban on these chemicals and consequently brought forth the search for environmentally friendly alternatives. This paper describes the strategy, alternative approaches and the successful implementation of a novel process for making fine line multilayer circuit boards employing MCF free process. In printed circuit board technology, MCF has been widely utilized as a solvent for developing radiation sensitive materials useful in creating fine line circuitry patterns. This solvent was used as a <b>developer</b> for <b>solvent</b> based photoresists. The aqueous resist compatible with extremely alkaline media is not available in the market. The necessity to eliminate the use of MCF provided thus the impetus to finding an alternative suitable solvent. The new solvents must meet specific manufacturing and environmental requirements with respect to flammability, toxicity, ability to recycle, simplicity of composition and compatibility with a spectrum of photoresists and subsequent processes. After evaluating numerous alternative solvents, a process based on a cyclic ester was developed as a substitute for MCF. Low boiling solvent such as methanol, acetone, methyl ethyl ketone, were not considered for manufacturing process either due to flammability, toxicity or high emission rate. Cyclic ester having high boiling point, high flash point and listed as combustible were evaluated for flammability. Fire test results indicated that these cyclic esters under atomized conditions (spray process) change the physical state of the solvent and thus become flammable and normally ignite in the presence of ignition source and sufficient oxygen. This novel ester based process has been successfully implemented in both IBM-Endicott NY, USA and IBM-Sindelfingen, Germany manufacturing sites resulting in the elimination of MCF as a developer in photolithographic processes in manufxturing of thermal conduction module (TCM) raw boards...|$|R

Final consumer should be assured when buying food about actual temperature and thermal history of the selected food product {{and this is why}} it should be indicated on the packed or prepacked item. The chromogenic temperature indicator for cold food chain was prepared from suitable active material packed in the properly structured holder. When temperature rises above the defined storage temperature, the active material changes colour and physical state (solid/liquid). Simultaneously, special packaging structure enables irreversible recording of the time exposed to the elevated temperature. The active material was made of thermochromic composite, consisting of dye, <b>developer</b> and <b>solvent.</b> It changes colour at its melting point, being coloured below and discoloured above it. The temperature is called activation temperature of the composite. Its value was adjusted by appropriate solvent and additives used for preparation of the composite, to reach the desired value. The temperature dependent colour change of the composite was determined by colorimetric measurements. The conditions for best observation of the change by naked eye were also examined. The structure of the active material’s holder was analyzed for best displaying of the time spend at high temperature (above the activation temperature). Functioning of the indicator was examined with growth of pathogens as a function of migration of the active material at temperature above the required storage temperature of the food. It was found out that the described chromogenic temperature indicator for cold food chain shows the thermal history of food storage by colour-, phase- and migration changes of the active composite material and consequently would be reliable as indicator in cold food chain to indicate temperature abuse and would disclose potential growth of psychrophilic microorganisms...|$|R
40|$|We {{report in}} this paper that typical <b>solvent</b> <b>developers</b> for PMMA {{can be used to}} develop PMGI (polydimethyl glutarimide) with a {{contrast}} much higher than that reported using base developers. Three developers were studied: methyl isobutyl ketone (MIBK), 2 -ethoxyethanol (cellosolve), and methyl ethyl ketone (MEK). MIBK developer results in the highest contrast of 6. 7 which is comparable to that of PMMA, followed by MEK (4. 0) and then by cellosolve (2. 6). The sensitivity is around 1000 5 C/cm 2, roughly four times that of PMMA and almost independent of the developers. Higher resist baking temperature leads to higher contrast for MEK and cellosolve, whereas for MIBK the optimum baking temperature is 200 0 C. Both MIBK and MEK (but not cellosolve) developers can resolve 50 nm pitch grating with slight line distortion which is similar to that achievable by PMMA. Using a single step development, a double layer of PMMA and PMGI could be employed to facilitate the liftoff process or to fabricate a T-shaped gate structure, while a multilayer stack can be used to produce 3 D metal structures by electroplating.

Parylene-C and -F on silicon and glass substrates as well as 50 μm thick PTFE were irradiated to different fluences (1 × 1013 - 1 × 10161 × 1013 - 1 × 1016 1 MeV 16 O+ ions cm− 2) through aperture masks under high vacuum and a low pressure (< 10 − 3 mbar) oxygen atmosphere.

40|$|Atomic radii {{and charges}} {{are two major}} {{parameters}} used in implicit solvent electrostatics and energy calculations. The optimization problem for charges and radii is under-determined, leading to uncertainty in the values of these parameters and in the results of solvation energy calculations using these parameters. This paper presents a new method for quantifying this uncertainty in implicit solvation calculations of small molecules using surrogate models based on generalized polynomial chaos (gPC) expansions. There are relatively few atom types used to specify radii parameters in implicit solvation calculations; therefore, surrogate models for these low-dimensional spaces could be constructed using least-squares fitting. However, {{there are many more}} types of atomic charges; therefore, construction of surrogate models for the charge parameter space requires compressed sensing combined with an iterative rotation method to enhance problem sparsity. We demonstrate the application of the method by presenting results for the uncertainties in small molecule solvation energies based on these approaches. The method presented in this paper is a promising approach for efficiently quantifying uncertainty {{in a wide range of}} force field parameterization problems, including those beyond continuum solvation calculations. The intent of this study is to provide a way for <b>developers</b> of implicit <b>solvent</b> model parameter sets to understand the sensitivity of their target properties (solvation energy) on underlying choices for solute radius and charge parameters...|$|R
30|$|Here we {{have chosen}} the resist {{combination}} as ZEP- 520 A (from Zeon Corp.) with sensitivity ~ 50 μC/cm 2 for the top layer, and poly(dimethylglutarimide) (PMGI, from MicroChem Corp.) with sensitivity ~ 1, 000 μC/cm 2 for the bottom layer. In addition to the large difference in sensitivity, ZEP- 520 A can be dissolved by anisole for metal liftoff, which does not attack the bottom PMGI layer. PMGI is not a typical EBL resist. Instead, {{it is commonly used}} as a liftoff resist in a bi-layer stack with PMGI as the bottom layer [5], because its chemistry is “orthogonal” to that of common EBL resist like ZEP- 520 A (and PMMA): on the one hand, it is resistant to most solvents that dissolve ZEP- 520 A, which is essential for spin-coating the bi-layer resist stack; on the other hand, it is dissolved (etched laterally when underneath ZEP- 520 A) by base solutions consisting of KOH or tetramethylammonium hydroxide (TMAH), which does not attack the top ZEP- 520 A layer. As the dissolution rate by a base solution increases drastically when PMGI is exposed to electrons, it is effectively an EBL resist with sensitivity of 50 – 100 μC/cm 2 [6, 7]. However, its sensitivity drops considerably to ~ 1, 000 μC/cm 2 when using <b>solvent</b> <b>developers</b> such as methyl ethyl ketone (MEK) and methyl isobutyl ketone (MIBK) [8], making it a suitable choice for the current bi-layer resist process. The rather low sensitivity of PMGI does not increase the e-beam writing time significantly because the exposure area of the pillars is much less than that of the trenches.|$|R
40|$|New epoxy based sol - gel organic {{inorganic}} materials, showing lithographic resist-like properties {{without the}} addition of any photocatalysts, are presented. To obtain a material sensitive to radiation, specific sol - gel syntheses based on an organically modified alkoxide containing an epoxy ring, 3 -glycidoxypropyltrimethoxysilane (GPTMS), have been developed. The synthesis and the patternability of hybrid materials have been obtained controlling the inorganic crosslinking degree and with an almost total absence of organic polymerization. Two examples of directly patternable hybrid films, called GB and GGe, have been synthesized using acidic (GGe) and basic (GB) conditions and obtaining different compositions. After electron beam lithography (EBL) or x-ray synchrotron radiation lithography (XRL) the polymerization of the organic component of the sol - gel film occurs, generating a hardening of the structure after post-exposure baking. The exposed polymerized material becomes insoluble, determining a negative resist-like behaviour of the film: the lithographic process of nanopatterning results from {{the dissolution of the}} unexposed areas in proper <b>solvents</b> (<b>developers).</b> Spatial resolution of the order of 200 nm is reported and a contrast of 2. 2 is achieved. The novelty of this work is that epoxy based materials, which have enhanced thermomechanical stability with respect to the more usual acrylic based resins, are directly nanopatterned for the first time by electron beam (EB) and/or x-ray beam radiation exposure without the aid of catalysts for polymerization. In contrast to common resists that are sacrificial layers of the fabrication process, direct patternable sol - gel hybrids constitute the final material of the devices.

30|$|Nano-transfer {{printing}} (nTP) is {{a promising}} technique to directly produce patterns of metallic films at the nano-scale on {{different kinds of}} substrates without the need of conventional lithographic methods. Here, the pattern is initially defined on a stamp as a 3 D-relief structure. After metal deposition on the entire stamp area, its relief is brought into intimate contact with the target substrate. If the adhesion of the metal film towards the substrate is stronger than towards the stamp, the film will adhere on the target substrate upon release of the stamp [1, 2]. Consequently, nano-scale metal structures can be easily defined in a purely additive process. As this process does not necessarily involve high temperatures, nor any form of chemistry (e.g., organic <b>solvents,</b> <b>developer</b> solutions, etc.), it is especially interesting for applications where harsh conditions should be avoided (e.g., organic electronics) [3]. Note, that in a nTP process, while the stamp itself needs to be structured {{with some sort of}} high-end, cost-intensive lithographic methods (e.g., e-beam lithography), as it then serves as a template for multiple transfer processes, the initial effort is capitalized more efficiently. The quality of this transfer printing process depends mainly {{on the quality of the}} stamp, the difference in adhesion between stamp/metal and substrate/metal, and the metal film itself [4, 5]. Silicon stamps, where the structure is defined by partially etching a silicon wafer to produce a 3 D-relief structure have proven to be suitable for nTP. The silicon surface can be modified by a self-assembled monolayer (most prominently perfluorooctyltrichlorosilane [PFOTS]) to reduce its surface free energy which significantly reduces the adhesion of metals [6]. We previously demonstrated the fabrication of arrays of nano-scale tunneling diodes using nTP with structured silicon stamps [7].|$|R
30|$|After {{additional}} solvent development, {{the contrast}} curve (Figure  1 b) shows a mixed behavior, {{rather than a}} simple positive or negative tone behavior. At very low exposure doses, since the unexposed resist is soluble in pentyl acetate developer whereas electron beam exposure decomposed the resist to generate less soluble decomposition product, the resist exhibited a negative tone. At higher doses, on the one hand, the resist was increasingly decomposed and vaporized with increasing doses, {{which led to the}} tendency of positive tone; on the other hand, as the degree of decomposition increased, the decomposition product became less soluble in the <b>solvent</b> <b>developer,</b> resulting in the tendency of negative tone after solvent development. As a consequence of those two competing trends, there exists a turning point exposure dose (approximately 1, 200 μC/cm 2) that gave a maximum remaining thickness. Such an exposure behavior can lead to complex structure as shown in Figure  2 b, which is due to proximity exposure at the surrounding area beyond the directly exposed area. In fact, such kind of mixed exposure property is well {{known for a long time}} for PMMA that displays a positive tone at low doses and becomes a negative tone at approximately 10 times higher doses [21], which was also employed to generate complex structures [22]. Though less known, another popular resist ZEP- 520 A actually also exhibits a mixed tone behavior just like PMMA [23]. However, unlike PMMA and ZEP for which the negative tone behavior appears only after roughly 10 times higher doses, for nitrocellulose, the negative tone behavior proceeds the positive tone, and the dose ranges for the two tones have a large overlap and thus they are not clearly separated.|$|R
40|$|The primary {{objective}} of the work described in this thesis was to devise a red-sensitive photoresist imaging process {{for use in the}} replication of diffraction optics. In the introduction the chemistry of conventional photopolymer systems and photoresists used for holographic recording and the fabrication of diffraction gratings and diffracting optical elements is reviewed. The limitations of commercially available photoresist systems, particularly for applications requiring the use of red light are discussed. A polymer system has been investigated which could be imaged by photochemically generated free radicals, followed by a simple aqueous development procedure as required by the original specification. The polymer chosen for study was a copolymer of methyl methacrylate, methacrylic acid and 2 -hydroxyethyl methacrylate. This was derivatized using methacryloyl chloride or methacrylic anhydride in order to introduce cross-linkable units to the polymer backbone. Polymers have been characterized by a number of techniques and the effect of varying composition on aqueous base solubility has been thoroughly studied. Various methods of derivatization have been employed. The ease of imaging {{has been found to be}} very sensitive to both the composition of the polymer and the extent of functionalization. High quality images have been obtained from this polymer using an organic <b>solvent</b> <b>developer.</b> Imaging experiments have been carried out on thin films of the photopolymer coated on glass using phenylazotriphenylmethane (PATM) as photoinitiator. Good images of 100 lines permillimetre (1 mm - 1) have been recorded by contact printing. Interferometry has been used to demonstrate that interference patterns having 600 and 1200 1 mm - 1 can be recorded using this polymer with PATM as initiator, exposed to an argon ion laser operating at 458 nm. A number of two component photoredox initiator systems have been investigated, the light absorbing species of such systems being a dye such as methylene blue or certain cyanine dyes. The second component of these initiators may be an aryl sulphinate salt, a 1, 3 -diketone or some alkyl sulphides. The red light-initiated phatopolymerization of acrylamide has been demonstrated using some of these initiators and a low resolution photopolymer image has been recorded using Azure A and perinaphth- 1, 3 -indandione as the photoinitiator system.

30|$|The in situ {{feedback}} {{is provided by}} self-developing resist, for which the exposed test pattern shows up and can be examined right after exposure by SEM at high magnification. This {{is in contrast to}} conventional resist that requires ex situ development using <b>solvent</b> or aqueous <b>developer.</b> Self-developing electron or ion beam resists had been extensively studied in the 1980 s. For instance, metal halides such as AlF 3 are decomposed to form volatile fluorine gas upon electron beam exposure; thus, they behave as a positive self-developing resist [5 – 9]. Similarly, nitrocellulose is decomposed upon exposure to electron or ion beam; thus, it is also a positive self-developing resist [10 – 13]. However, those self-developing resists are nearly forgotten by the EBL community after their discovery. We believe this is because the metal halide resists suffer from extremely low sensitivity and inability to expose arbitrary structure other than very thin line and dot patterns since the decomposition product metallic Al cannot migrate far away from the directly exposed area, whereas nitrocellulose resist always leave behind a thick non-volatile residual layer. In fact, nitrocellulose was mostly used as an ion beam resist for which the residual layer is thinner because physical bombardment by ion beam can help remove the non-volatile species [14]. Though metal halides offer extremely high resolution, the film is found to be degraded by humidity after long (several weeks) exposure to air. More recently, ice and frozen carbon dioxide were shown to behave as an electron beam resist without the need of a development step [15 – 18]. However, they both require significant modification of the EBL system to maintain a low temperature, which greatly limits their application. Lastly, PMMA and ZEP resist have also demonstrated self-developing behavior, yet the resist thickness reduction due to over-exposure at approximately 15 times normal clearance dose was less than 30 % of the original film thickness if without ex situ post-exposure thermal annealing [19]. Therefore, here, we have chosen nitrocellulose for the purpose of in situ feedback. As expected, it behaves like a positive resist since e-beam exposure can also generate secondary electrons to decompose the resist, as ion beam does, and the amount of residual layer is significant. However, a thick residual layer, though undesirable since it lowers SEM imaging contrast, is acceptable for the purpose of in situ feedback. Interestingly, nitrocellulose was also found to be developable using a <b>solvent</b> <b>developer</b> to give a mixed positive and negative tone behavior.|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe US Department of Energy (DOE) {{established}} the National Carbon Capture Center (NCCC) {{as part of}} its strategy to address the need for cost-effective CO 2 capture technologies. The focus of the NCCC is to conduct research and development to advance emerging CO 2 control technologies to commercial scale for effective integration into coal- based Integraged Gasification Combined Cycle (IGCC) and combustion processes. To achieve this goal, the NCCC provides a test-bed for government, industrial, and university projects to conduct meaningful tests in an industrial setting. The NCCC test plan includes both post-combustion and pre-combustion CO 2 capture development. A flexible post- combustion test facility, Post-combustion Carbo Plant E. C. Gaston, in Wilsonville, Alabama. The facility, which is managed by Southern Company Services, provides a platform for testing technologies at a wide-range of sizes and process conditions on coal-derived flue gas. Since completing commissioning and baseline testing in early 2011, several technologies have been tested. The PC 4 facility includes multiple slipstreams with a range of flue gas throughputs to allow the evaluation of post- combustion CO 2 capture technologies. It provides the capability to test modules from technology developers and to test solvents in an absorber/regenerator unit, the pilot solvent test unit (PSTU). In 2011, PSTU baseline tests were completed, using a reference solvent, monoethanol amine (MEA) to characterize its performance and verify the reliability of the data generated. The PSTU was later operated to test a potential commercial solvent developed by Babcock & Wilcox. Aker Carbon Solutions installed a mobile test unit at the site to test its commercial solvent, and Membrane Technology & Research installed and commissioned its 0. 05 -MW polymeric CO 2 -separation membrane, which will continue to be tested throughout 2012. Also in 2012, several other <b>developers</b> will test <b>solvents</b> in the PSTU and enzyme-based solvent systems in the bench scale area on coal-derived flue gas. Collaboration with additional developers for future test plans is on-going. The NCCC also generates coal derived syngas which is available for testing technologies related to pre-combustion CO 2 capture. Several slipstreams are in place with a range of syngas throughputs. Technologies tested in 2011 include water gas shift catalysts, high-temperature mercury and CO 2 sorbents, a hydrocarbon removal system, physical and chemical solvents for CO 2 absorption, a polymeric CO 2 -separation membrane, and three hydrogen- separation membranes (carbon molecular sieve, polymeric, and palladium based). Several of these technologies will be tested further in 2012, and membranes and <b>solvents</b> from other <b>developers</b> will also be tested. Result from NCCC's testing have indicated the facility's usefulness in accelerating the commercialization of advanced CO 2 capture technologies.
