5|$|During the {{build-up}} to the 1978 FIFA World Cup, MacLeod fuelled {{the hopes}} of the nation by stating that Scotland would come home with a medal. As the squad left for the finals in Argentina, they were given an enthusiastic send-off as they were paraded around a packed Hampden Park. Thousands more fans lined the route to Prestwick Airport as the team set off for South America. Scotland's first game was against Peru in Córdoba. Two spectacular goals by Teófilo Cubillas meant that {{the result was a}} 3–1 loss. The second game was a very disappointing 1–1 draw against Iran. The disconsolate mood of the nation was reflected by footage of Ally MacLeod in the dugout with <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>hands.</b>|$|E
5|$|Before his trial, Tony {{attempts}} suicide. Whitney {{tries to}} visit but is refused, and Bianca {{sees it as}} a form of manipulation. Tony repeatedly attempts to contact Whitney by phone, but after {{the first day of the}} trial, he flushes the SIM card down the toilet in his cell. When Whitney's brother Ryan Malloy (Neil McDermott) tries to attack Tony in court, Whitney says she will refuse to testify, claiming her witness statement was a lie and she was forced to say it. Bianca explains to Whitney that Tony will be set free and that he will target other children. Tony's barrister, Mrs Taylor (Jacqueline Defferary), cross-examines Whitney, trying to imply that she pursued him for several years, saying she refused to take 'no' for an answer and lied about the accusations. Tony shouts out that he is innocent but Whitney says she trusted him and he abused her, revealing the truth about the relationship. After leaving the courtroom, Whitney gives her barrister, Vivien Easley QC (Geraldine Alexander), a mobile phone with messages from Tony on it. A week later Tony is found guilty of all charges and sentenced to 13 years in custody. He smirks as the verdict is being read out but is taken away with <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>hands.</b>|$|E
500|$|At {{the end of}} the night, {{the four}} Beatles and some of their guests overdubbed an {{extended}} humming sound to close the song – an idea that they later discarded. According to Beatles historian Mark Lewisohn, the tapes from this 10 February orchestral session reveal the guests breaking into loud applause following the second orchestral passage. Among the EMI staff attending the event, one recalled how Ron Richards, the Hollies' producer, was stunned by the music he had heard; in Lewisohn's description, Richards [...] " [...] with <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>hands,</b> saying 'I just can't believe it … I give up.'" [...] Martin later offered his own opinion of the orchestral session: [...] "part of me said 'We're being a bit self-indulgent here.' The other part of me said 'It's bloody marvellous!'" ...|$|E

500|$|On January 28, 1970, a {{third and}} final Band of Gypsys {{appearance}} took place; they performed during a music festival at Madison Square Garden benefiting the anti-Vietnam War Moratorium Committee titled the [...] "Winter Festival for Peace". American blues guitarist Johnny Winter was backstage before the concert; he recalled: [...] " [...] came in with his head down, {{sat on the couch}} alone, and put <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>hands...</b> He didn't move until {{it was time for the}} show." [...] Minutes after taking the stage he snapped a vulgar response at a woman who had shouted a request for [...] "Foxy Lady". He then began playing [...] "Earth Blues" [...] before telling the audience: [...] "That's what happens when earth fucks with space". Moments later, he briefly sat down on the drum riser before leaving the stage. Both Miles and Redding later stated that Jeffery had given Hendrix LSD before the performance. Miles believed that Jeffery gave Hendrix the drugs in an effort to sabotage the current band and bring about the return of the original Experience lineup. Jeffery fired Miles after the show and Cox quit, ending the Band of Gypsys.|$|E
500|$|Although he did {{not have}} to face top-class fast bowling in Test matches, he was {{successful}} against English fast bowlers such as Harold Larwood in county cricket, and he established his ascendancy over O'Reilly, the world's best bowler at the time. On one occasion, O'Reilly held <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> when he saw Leyland come out to bat, and was heard to say: [...] "Oh, it's that bloody Yorkshireman again!" [...] In later years, O'Reilly vigorously denied that Leyland held the upper hand, responding to such suggestions by saying [...] "You just check how many times I got him out!" [...] The cricket historian David Frith points out that [...] "the answer is nine times in 16 Tests, but with decreasing frequency. In their Test encounters Leyland made 1,412 runs at an average of 56." [...] Robertson-Glasgow noted that Leyland was almost anonymous in good batting conditions under little pressure; he came to life in more difficult circumstances: [...] "His element was foul weather. He would disappear into the haze of Bramall Lane, where a sterner sort of game was being played under the name of cricket, and entrench himself among the sawdust and smoke and off-breaks and appeals, and do his raw, tough work in silence." ...|$|E
500|$|The Australians then {{proceeded}} to play Yorkshire at Bradford, on a damp pitch that suited slower bowling; rain delayed {{the start of the}} match until midway through the first afternoon. Bradman rested himself and returned to London while Hassett led the team. Yorkshire elected to bat and were bowled out in difficult batting conditions for 71, despite Australia losing all rounder Sam Loxton with a hamstring injury. Australia replied with 101 without Loxton, who was unable to bat. Hassett came in at 1/24 and was immediately out for a duck. Australia then bowled out the hosts in the second innings for 89. Chasing 60 for victory, Hassett elected to not ask for the pitch to be rolled. Former Australian Test batsman Jack Fingleton said that Hassett [...] "might have made an initial mistake in not having the pitch rolled because whenever there was rain about in England the heavy roller seemed to knock any nonsense [...] out of the pitch". Australia lost quick wickets and Hassett came in with the score at 2/5. Keith Miller was then out at 3/13 after attempting to hit a six, while Hassett was nervous after his first innings duck. Ron Hamence joined Hassett and they took the score to 20 before the former was run out attempting a quick single. Without further addition to the score, Hassett attempted a pull shot and top edged it so high that five players had the time to converge and any of these could have caught the ball. The catch was eventually taken directly in front of Hassett, leaving Australia at 5/20. To make matters worse, Loxton was still too injured to bat, so Australia effectively only had four wickets in hand and faced its first loss to an English county since 1912. Neil Harvey had scored a solitary run when he was dropped at short leg. Colin McCool fell at 6/31, and Harvey and new partner Don Tallon were both given lives before the tourists scraped home by four wickets. It was the closest Australia came to defeat for the whole tour, and Hassett was very relieved, playing <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> and muttering [...] "Why me? Why is it always me?" [...] in a reference to his encountering rain-affected wickets as captain.|$|E

2500|$|On 16 September 1989, Yeltsin toured a {{medium-sized}} grocery store (Randall's) in Texas Leon Aron, quoting a Yeltsin associate, {{wrote in his}} 2000 biography, Yeltsin, A Revolutionary Life (St. Martin's Press): [...] "For a long time, on the plane to Miami, he sat motionless, <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>hands.</b> 'What have they done to our poor people?' {{he said after a}} long silence." [...] He added, [...] "On his return to Moscow, Yeltsin would confess the pain he had felt after the Houston excursion: the ‘pain for all of us, for our country so rich, so talented and so exhausted by incessant experiments.’” ...|$|E
2500|$|According to road manager Don Opperman: [...] "The way I {{remember}} it, the 'ooos' and the 'boos' {{were mixed}} together, but Stevie was pretty disappointed. Stevie [...] just handed me his guitar {{and walked off}} stage, and I'm like, 'Are you coming back?' There was a doorway back there; the audience couldn't see the guys, but I could. He {{went back to the}} dressing room with <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>hands.</b> I went back there finally, {{and that was the end}} of the show." [...] According to Vaughan: [...] "It wasn't the whole crowd [...] It was just a few people sitting right up front. The room there was built for acoustic jazz. When five or six people boo, wow. It sounds like the whole world hates you. They thought we were too loud, but shoot, I had four army blankets folded over my amp, and the volume level was on 2. I'm used to playin' on 10!" [...] The performance was filmed and later released on DVD in September 2004.|$|E
2500|$|The present Saint Thuriau {{church in}} Landivisiau was built between 1864 and 1865 {{replacing}} the earlier 16th-century building {{but the old}} church's porch and bell-tower were retained, fortunately so as they are both magnificent. The porch was dismantled and then re-erected in 1728 by Jean Perrot and Sébastien Roussel. The entrance to the porch comprises a semi-circular arch, with side buttresses and above the arch a pointed gable culminates in an elaborate lanteron. Inside the porch are statues of the apostles, and a two-door entrance to the church has further decorated arches, with further statues on the wall {{as well as a}} tympanum. Unusually for porches in churches in the Élorn valley, the porch is accessed using ten steps. As at Pencran, Bastien Prigent created a series of piédroits and voussures depicting biblical and other scenes as decoration of the arch over the porch's entrance (the blocks of stone at the part of the arch near to ground level are the piédroits and the remaining wedge-shaped stones used in constructing an arch form the voussoirs. [...] Above the biblical scenes in the arch's piédroits are depictions of the four Evangelists and their attributes, with Saints Luke and John positioned on the left and Mark and Matthew positioned on the right and finally a [...] "heavenly choir" [...] of thirty one winged angels are shown floating in the clouds and praying, singing, playing various instruments or holding censers. Above the entrance arch is a gable in the Gothic style and on this the sculptors placed a statue depicting a female saint reading a book and another female saint higher up has her hands crossed against her chest. [...] The gable is also decorated with two lions supporting the blason of François de Tournemine. [...] Above the gable there is an ornate lanteron with three niches. The central niche contains a statue of Saint Thuriau to whom the church is dedicated. [...] The two buttresses supporting the arch have niches containing statues of the four Evangelists each seated at a desk with their attributes at their side. The buttresses also hold a statue of the Virgin of the Annunciation and another depicting Saint Anne with the Virgin Mary. All these statues are by Bastien Prigent. [...] The inside of the porch is vaulted and is decorated with the blason of the Danycan family and Henry Prigent added statues of [...] "Christ the Saviour" [...] and the twelve apostles in niches each with an elaborate canopy. The heads of these apostles were damaged during the turmoil of the French revolution and bear signs of restoration and some of the attributes were destroyed which makes identification difficult. The arches around the two doors giving access to the church are in turn richly decorated with garlands of thistles ("chardon") and grapes and a series of statuettes in niches, these depicting Saint Yves, Saint Peter holding a book and a key, Saint Salomon the Breton king wearing armour, holding a sword and the royal crown, Saint Miliau carrying <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>hands,</b> Saint Thivisiau, a bishop, Saint Côme holding a vase containing medications, Saint Damien (Côme and Damien were brothers and both doctors martyred under Diocletian), and another bishop giving a blessing. On the left side angels hold a cartouche reading [...] "ANNO.DOMINI.1554" [...] and on the right the cartouche reads [...] "LAN.MIL.VCC.L1111.FVST.FONDE.CESTE.PORTAL.ET.ESTOIENT.LORS.FABRIQVES.Y.MART(I)N.J.ABGRALL". Above the doors a tympanun depicts angels holding phylacteries on either side of a statue of Jesus Christ. The phylactery held by the three angels on the left side reads [...] "MEMENTO.MEI/O.MATER.DEI/PAX VOBIS" [...] and that held by three angels on the right reads [...] "DOMVS MEA/SALVATOR MVNDI/ LETVS MARIA". There is an elaborate stoup on the wall between the two entrance doors.|$|E
