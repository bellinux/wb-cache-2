Furthermore, the National Food Authority allocated 200sacks of rice to Pangasinan. The National <b>Disaster</b> <b>Risk</b> Reduction and Management Council assisted in relief operations by allocating ₱10million (US$200,000) and 800bags of rice for such efforts. In addition, one of eight regional Filipino health offices distributed roughly ₱600,000 (US$10,000) worth of various medicines to Dagupan and Urdaneta, Pangasinan. According to the National Disaster Coordinating Council, ₱15.7million (US$300,000) worth in relief operations was allocated.|$|E
5|$|Japan has 108 active volcanoes. During {{the twentieth}} century several new volcanoes emerged, {{including}} Shōwa-shinzan on Hokkaido and Myōjin-shō off the Bayonnaise Rocks in the Pacific. Destructive earthquakes, often resulting in tsunami, occur several times each century. The 1923 Tokyo earthquake killed over 140,000 people. More recent major quakes are the 1995 Great Hanshin earthquake and the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake, a 9.1-magnitude quake which hit Japan on March 11, 2011, and triggered a large tsunami. Japan is substantially prone to earthquakes, tsunami and volcanoes due to its location along the Pacific Ring of Fire.

Residents living in {{extremely}} low-lying areas near the rivers {{or one of the}} 1,400 creeks and streams experience occasional floods, such as those caused when the remnants of Hurricane Ivan hit rainfall records in 2004.

In October1959, a special parliamentary session enacted several measures coordinated by various government ministries and provided subsidiaries to persons effected by Vera and other natural disasters in Japan from August and September of that year. A long lasting legislation prompted by Vera's effects was the 1961passage of the Disaster Countermeasures Basic Act, {{widely regarded as the}} [...] "cornerstone of legislation on <b>disaster</b> <b>risk</b> reduction in Japan."
