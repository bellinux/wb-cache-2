40|$|The outlook {{to apply}} the highly {{energetic}} biogas from anaerobic digestion into fuel cells {{will result in a}} significantly higher electrical efficiency and can contribute to an increase of renewable energy production. The practical bottleneck is the <b>fuel</b> <b>cell</b> <b>poisoning</b> caused by several gaseous trace compounds like hydrogen sulfide and ammonia. Hence artificial neural networks were developed to predict these trace compounds. The experiments concluded that ammonia in biogas can indeed be present up to 93 ppm. Hydrogen sulfide and ammonia concentrations in biogas were modelled successfully using the MATLAB Neural Network Toolbox. A script was developed which made it easy to search for the best neural network models' input/output-parameters, settings and architectures. The models were predicting the trace compounds, even under dynamical conditions. The resulted determination coefficients (R 2) were for hydrogen sulfide 0. 91 and ammonia 0. 83. Several model predictive control tool strategies were introduced which showed the potential to foresee, control, reduce or even avoid the presence of the trace compounds...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT Bacteria, fungi and {{protozoa}} inhabiting the rumen – {{the largest}} {{chamber of the}} ruminants’ stomach, release large quantities of hydrogen during the fermentation of carbohydrates. The hydrogen is used by coexisting methanogens to produce methane in energy-yielding processes. This work shows, for the first time, a fundamental possibility of using a hydrogen-rich fermentation gas produced by selected rumen ciliates to feed a low-temperature hydrogen fuel cell. A biohydrogen fuel cell (BHFC) was constructed consisting of (i) a bioreactor, in which a hydrogen-rich gas was produced from glucose by rumen ciliates, mainly of the Isotrichidae family, deprived of intra- and extracellular bacteria, methanogens, and fungi, and (ii) a chemical fuel cell of the polymer-electrolyte type (PEFC). The fuel cell {{was used as a}} tester of the technical applicability of the fermentation gas produced by the rumen ciliates for power generation. The average estimated hydrogen yield was ca. 1. 15 mol H 2 per mol of fermented glucose. The BHFC performance was equal to the performance of the PEFC running on pure hydrogen. No <b>fuel</b> <b>cell</b> <b>poisoning</b> effects were detected. A maximum power density of 1. 66 kW/m 2 (PEFC geometric area) was obtained at room temperature.

40|$|The main {{objectives}} {{of this project}} were to investigate {{the effect of a}} series of potential impurities on <b>fuel</b> <b>cell</b> operation and on the particular components of the <b>fuel</b> <b>cell</b> MEA, to propose (where possible) mechanism(s) by which these impurities affected <b>fuel</b> <b>cell</b> performance, and to suggest strategies for minimizing these impurity effects. The negative effect on Pt/C was to decrease hydrogen surface coverage and hydrogen activation at <b>fuel</b> <b>cell</b> conditions. The negative effect on Nafion components was to decrease proton conductivity, primarily by replacing/reacting with the protons on the Bronsted acid sites of the Nafion. Even though already well known as <b>fuel</b> <b>cell</b> <b>poisons,</b> the effects of CO and NH 3 were studied in great detail early on in the project in order to develop methodology for evaluating poisoning effects in general, to help establish reproducibility of results among a number of laboratories in the U. S. investigating impurity effects, and to help establish lower limit standards for impurities during hydrogen production for <b>fuel</b> <b>cell</b> utilization. New methodologies developed included (1) a means to measure hydrogen surface concentration on the Pt catalyst (HDSAP) before and after exposure to impurities, (2) a way to predict conductivity of a Nafion membranes exposed to impurities using a characteristic acid catalyzed reaction (methanol esterification of acetic acid), and, more importantly, (3) application of the latter technique to predict conductivity on Nafion in the catalyst layer of the MEA. H 2 -D 2 exchange was found to be suitable for predicting hydrogen activation of Pt catalysts. The Nafion (ca. 30 wt%) on the Pt/C catalyst resides primarily on the external surface of the C support where it blocks significant numbers of micropores, but only partially blocks the pore openings of the meso- and macro-pores wherein lie the small Pt particles (crystallites). For this reason, even with 30 wt% Nafion on the Pt/C, few Pt sites are blocked and, hence, are accessible for hydrogen activation. Of the impurities studied, CO, NH 3, perchloroethylene (also known as tetrachloroethylene), tetrahydrofuran, diborane, and metal cations had significant negative effects on the components in a <b>fuel</b> <b>cell.</b> While CO has no effect on the Nafion, it significantly poisons the Pt catalyst by adsorbing and blocking hydrogen activation. The effect can be reversed with time once the flow of CO is stopped. NH 3 has no effect on the Pt catalyst at <b>fuel</b> <b>cell</b> conditions; it <b>poisons</b> the proton sites on Nafion (by forming NH 4 + cations), decreasing drastically the proton conductivity of Nafion. This poisoning can slowly be reversed once the flow of NH 3 is stopped. Perchloroethylene has a major effect on <b>fuel</b> <b>cell</b> performance. Since it has little/no effect on Nafion conductivity, its poisoning effect is on the Pt catalyst. However, this effect takes place primarily for the Pt catalyst at the cathode, since the presence of oxygen is very important for this poisoning effect. Tetrahydrofuran was shown not to impact Nafion conductivity; however, it does affect <b>fuel</b> <b>cell</b> performance. Therefore, its primary effect is on the Pt catalyst. The effect of THF on <b>fuel</b> <b>cell</b> performance is reversible. Diborane also can significant affect <b>fuel</b> <b>cell</b> performance. This effect is reversible once diborane is removed from the inlet streams. H 2 O 2 is not an impurity usually present in the hydrogen or oxygen streams to a <b>fuel</b> <b>cell.</b> However, it is generated during <b>fuel</b> <b>cell</b> operation. The presence of Fe cations in the Nafion due to system corrosion and/or arising from MEA production act to catalyze the severe degradation of the Nafion by H 2 O 2. Finally, the presence of metal cation impurities (Na+, Ca 2 +, Fe 3 +) in Nafion from MEA preparation or from corrosion significantly impacts its proton conductivity due to replacement of proton sites. This effect is not reversible. Hydrocarbons, such as ethylene, might be expected to affect Pt or Nafion but do not at a typical <b>fuel</b> <b>cell</b> temperature of 80 oC. In the presence of large quantities of hydrogen on the anode side, ethylene is converted to ethane which is very nonreactive. More surprisingly, even more reactive hydrocarbons such as formic acid and acetaldehyde do not appear to react enough with the strong Bronsted acid sites on Nafion at such low temperatures to affect Nafion conductivity properties. These results clearly identify a number of impurities which can have a detrimental impact on <b>fuel</b> <b>cell</b> performance, although some are reversible. Obviously, <b>fuel</b> <b>cells</b> exposed to impurities/poisons which are reversible can recover their original performance capabilities once the impurity flow is stopped. Impurities with irreversible effects should be either minimized in the feed streams, if possible, or new catalytic materials or ion conductors will need to be used to minimize their impact...|$|R

In this research, a highly active aqueous catalytic system containing Ru(III) chloride and meta-trisulfonated triphenylphosphine (mTPPTS) as a ligand was applied for FA dehydrogenation in a continuous mode. CO concentration (8 – 70 ppm) in the resulting H 2 + CO 2 gas stream was measured using a wide range of reactor operating conditions. The CO concentration was found to be independent on the reactor temperature but increased with increasing FA feed. It was concluded that unwanted CO concentration in the H 2 + CO 2 gas stream was dependent on the current FA concentration in the reactor which was in turn dependent on the reaction design. Next, preferential oxidation (PROX) on a Pt/Al 2 O 3 catalyst was applied to remove CO traces from the H 2 + CO 2 stream.

40|$|To {{prevent the}} {{catalysts}} in <b>fuel</b> <b>cell</b> systems from <b>poisoning</b> by Sulfur containing substances the fuel {{to be used}} must be desulfurized {{to a maximum of}} 10 ppm of sulfur. Thereby. damage to the catalysts in the <b>fuel</b> <b>cell</b> and the reformer can be avoided. Diesel fuel for road vehicles within the EU is already desulfurized at the refinery. However. jet fuel is permitted to have up to 3000 ppm of sulfur. Since the hydrodesulfurization process used in refineries is not suitable for mobile applications, the aim of the present work was to develop an alternative desulfurization process for jet fuel and to determine its technical feasibility. To this end, many processes were assessed with respect to their application in <b>fuel</b> <b>cell</b> based auxiliary power units (APUs). Among them, hydrodesulfurization with pre-saturation was selected for detailed investigations. Laboratory tests revealed that also syngas operation is possible without any performance loss in comparison to operation with hydrogen. Pure hydrogen is not available in a <b>fuel</b> <b>cell</b> system based on reforming of jet fuel. The effects of reaction temperature. operating pressure and liquid hourly space velocity (LHSV) were investigated. Different jet fuel qualities with up to 3000 ppm of sulfur were desulfurized to a level of 15 - 22 ppm. Finally, the technical applicability of hydrodesulfurization with pre-saturation was demonstrated in a pilot plant with an electrical power of 5 kW, going beyond the laboratory scale. In a 200 -h experiment, a commercial jet fuel with 712 ppm of sulfur was desulfurized to a maximum sulfur content of 10 ppm. Besides this, H 2 S separation by stripping with air {{turned out to be a}} suitable method for APU applications.

40|$|<b>Fuel</b> <b>cell</b> {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{promising}} clean energy and alternative energy technologies due to its advantages of low emissions and high efficiency. One application of the <b>fuel</b> <b>cell</b> technology is onboard auxiliary power units (APUs) for power generation in aircrafts, ships, and automobiles. In order to supply hydrogen or syngas for the <b>fuel</b> <b>cell</b> APUs, onboard <b>fuel</b> processing technology was proposed to convert hydrocarbon fuels into syngas through reforming reactions. Two major tasks need to be completed in onboard fuel processing technology. Firstly sulfur compounds have to be removed from hydrocarbon fuels because sulfur can cause reforming catalyst deactivation and <b>fuel</b> <b>cell</b> electrodes <b>poisoning</b> problems. Secondly hydrogen and carbon monoxide shall be produced by reforming of hydrocarbon fuels at a high energy conversion efficiency. This dissertation focused on onboard fuel processing of Jet-A fuel to produce hydrogen and syngas for solid oxide <b>fuel</b> <b>cell</b> (SOFC) APUs. Jet-A fuel was studied because it is the logistic fuel commonly used for civilian airplanes and military heavy duty trucks. Ultra-deep adsorptive desulfurization of Jet-A fuel from over 1, 000 ppmw to below 50 ppmw, and autothermal reforming of n-dodecane as a Jet-A fuel surrogate as well as the real desulfurized Jet-A fuel to produce syngas have been systematically investigated in the present study. For the adsorptive desulfurization of Jet-A fuel, a novel NiO-CeO₂/A 1 ₂O₃-SiO₂ adsorbent was proposed and prepared in-house for experimental tests. The sulfur adsorption kinetic characteristic and isotherm at equilibrium were studied in batch tests, and the dynamic desulfurization performance of the adsorbent was investigated in fixed bed tests. Fixed bed tests operation conditions including liquid hourly space velocity (LHSV), adsorbent particle size, and fixed bed dimensions were optimized to achieve the highest adsorbent sulfur adsorption capacity. For the reforming of Jet-A fuel, autothermal reforming (ATR) method was employed and a bimetallic NiO-Rh catalyst was synthesized for the ATR reactions. A lab-scale 2. 5 kWt autothermal reforming system including the reformer and balance-of-plant was designed, fabricated, integrated and tested. The reforming system performances at various operation conditions were compared.

40|$|This year`s meeting {{highlights}} {{the fact that}} <b>fuel</b> <b>cells</b> for both stationary and transportation applications have reached the dawn of commercialization. Sales of stationary <b>fuel</b> <b>cells</b> have grown steadily over the past 2 years. Phosphoric acid <b>fuel</b> <b>cell</b> buses have been demonstrated in urban areas. Proton-exchange membrane <b>fuel</b> <b>cells</b> {{are on the verge}} of revolutionizing the transportation industry. These activities and many more are discussed during this seminar, which provides a forum for people from the international <b>fuel</b> <b>cell</b> community engaged in a wide spectrum of <b>fuel</b> <b>cell</b> activities. Discussions addressing R&D of <b>fuel</b> <b>cell</b> technologies, manufacturing and marketing of <b>fuel</b> <b>cells,</b> and experiences of <b>fuel</b> <b>cell</b> users took place through oral and poster presentations. For the first time, the seminar included commercial exhibits, further evidence that commercial <b>fuel</b> <b>cell</b> technology has arrived. A total of 205 papers is included in this volume...|$|R
30|$|Based on {{operating}} temperatures, PEM <b>fuel</b> <b>cells</b> may {{be divided}} into two categories: low-temperature PEM <b>fuel</b> <b>cells</b> and high-temperature PEM <b>fuel</b> <b>cells.</b> Low-temperature PEM <b>fuel</b> <b>cells</b> have a low operating temperature below 100  °C, whereas high-temperature PEM <b>fuel</b> <b>cells</b> work at temperatures above 100  °C, typically in the range from 120 to 180  °C [2]. The heat and mass transport phenomena and material properties of low-temperature and high-temperature PEM <b>fuel</b> <b>cells</b> have some significant differences. A low-temperature PEM <b>fuel</b> <b>cell</b> typically needs and produces liquid water to keep the membrane hydrated, which incurs complicated heat and mass transport processes [3]. A high-temperature PEM <b>fuel</b> <b>cell</b> does not have liquid water in operation, which thus has different water transport mechanism compared to low-temperature PEM <b>fuel</b> <b>cells.</b>|$|R

40|$|A <b>fuel</b> <b>cell</b> is an {{electrochemical}} device that continuously converts the chemical {{energy of a}} fuel directly into electrical energy. It consists of an electrolyte, an anode, and a cathode. Various types of <b>fuel</b> <b>cells</b> are available, such as direct methanol <b>fuel</b> <b>cells,</b> alkaline <b>fuel</b> <b>cells,</b> proton-exchange-membrane <b>fuel</b> <b>cells,</b> phosphoric acid <b>fuel</b> <b>cells,</b> molten carbonate <b>fuel</b> <b>cells,</b> and solid oxide <b>fuel</b> <b>cells</b> (SOFCs). The salient features of an SOFC are all solid construction and high-temperature electrochemical-reaction-based operation, resulting in clean, efficient power generation {{from a variety of}} fuels. SOFCs are being developed for a broad range of applications, such as portable electronic devices, automobiles, power generation, and aeronautics...|$|R
