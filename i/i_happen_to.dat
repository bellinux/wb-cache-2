500|$|Ice-T {{introduced}} the band at Lollapalooza in 1991, devoting {{half of his}} set to his hip hop songs, and half to Body Count songs, increasing his appeal with both alternative rock fans and middle-class teenagers. Many considered the Body Count performances to be {{the highlight of the}} tour. The group made its first album appearance on Ice-T's 1991 solo album O.G. Original Gangster. The song [...] "Body Count" [...] was preceded by a staged interview in which the performer referred to the group as a [...] "black hardcore band," [...] stating that [...] "as far as I'm concerned, music is music. I don't look at it as rock, R & B, or all that kind of stuff. I just look at it as music. [...] I do what I like and <b>I</b> <b>happen</b> <b>to</b> like rock 'n' roll, and I feel sorry for anybody who only listens to one form of music." ...|$|E
500|$|While commenting {{in regards}} to the lyrical content of the song on Australian talk show, Rove, Gaga said that she was unrepentant about her [...] "disco stick" [...] metaphor, though it led to a banning of the music video on Network Ten in Australia. She added that the metaphor was not meant to be subtle and was clear what the lyrics {{constituted}} off. [...] "If anything, <b>I</b> <b>happen</b> <b>to</b> think people are frivolously hard on me", Gaga generalized. She went on to relegate [...] "lot of youth-oriented pop music" [...] as much racier than hers with their sexually provocative lyrics, but Gaga felt that the whole context of her visuals alongside the music was what made people react. [...] "It's the music in relation to the visual, in relation to the way I move and the way I articulate the lyrics. But if I wanted to make music to make people sing 'la di da' that would be very boring," [...] she concluded.|$|E

500|$|Another media {{incident}} started {{during the}} New Hampshire primary September 27, 2003, when Clark {{was asked by}} space shuttle astronaut Jay C. Buckey what his vision for the space program was after the Space Shuttle Columbia disaster. Clark responded {{he was a great}} believer in the exploration of space but wanted a vision well beyond that of a new shuttle or space plane. [...] "I would like to see mankind get off this planet. I'd like to know what's out there beyond the solar system." [...] Clark thought such a vision could probably require a lifetime of research and development in various fields of science and technology. Then {{at the end of his}} remarks, Clark dropped a bombshell when he said [...] "I still believe in [...] But I can't believe that in all of human history we'll never ever be able to go beyond the speed of light to reach where we want to go. <b>I</b> <b>happen</b> <b>to</b> believe that mankind can do it. I've argued with physicists about it. I've argued with best friends about it. I just have to believe it. It's my only faith-based initiative." [...] These comments prompted a series of derisive headlines, such as [...] "Beam Us Up, General Clark" [...] in The New York Times, [...] "Clark is Light-Years Ahead of the Competition" [...] in The Washington Post, [...] "General Relativity (Retired)" [...] on the U.S. News & World Report website, and [...] "Clark Campaigns at Light Speed" [...] in Wired magazine.|$|E

Raised in an academic environment, two of his four siblings also became professors. Thorne's parents were members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (Mormons) and raised Thorne in the LDS faith, though he now describes himself as atheist.

[...] In November of that year, Blair further stated that, [...] "So far as our objective, it is disarmament, not régime change – that is our objective.

A single documented statement, however, may become the basis of a wide range of generalized non-sequiturs. The fact that a North Carolina slaveholder had an Arabic-speaking Muslim slave of unusual mathematical ability may be offered as evidence that all slaves brought to America were Moslem, Arabic-speaking, and learned. Similarly, historical facts may be indiscriminately mingled with myths and countermyths. (The Black Muslims in America, pp. 120–121) ...|$|E
2500|$|Principal {{photography}} {{began in}} June 2006 {{on a ranch}} in Marfa, Texas, and took three months. Other location shooting took place in Los Angeles. Anderson tried to shoot the script in sequence {{with most of the}} sets on the ranch. Two weeks in, Anderson replaced the actor playing Eli Sunday with Paul Dano, who had originally only been cast in the much smaller role of Paul Sunday, the brother who tipped off Plainview about the oil on the Sunday ranch. A profile of Day-Lewis in The New York Times Magazine suggested that the original actor, Kel O'Neill, had been intimidated by Day-Lewis's intensity and habit of staying in character on and off the set. Both Anderson and Day-Lewis deny this claim, and Day-Lewis stated, [...] "I absolutely don't believe that it was because he was intimidated by me. <b>I</b> <b>happen</b> <b>to</b> believe that—and I hope I'm right." ...|$|E
2500|$|Fronto {{never became}} Marcus' {{full-time}} teacher, and continued {{his career as}} an advocate. One notorious case brought him into conflict with Herodes. Fronto had been retained as defense counsel by Tiberius Claudius Demostratus, a prominent Athenian. Herodes Atticus was chief prosecutor. Because of Herodes' fraught relationship {{with the city of}} Athens, the defense's strategy would probably include attacks on his character. Marcus pleaded with Fronto, first with [...] "advice", then as a [...] "favor", not to attack Herodes; he had already asked Herodes to refrain from making the first blows. Fronto replied that he was surprised to discover Marcus counted Herodes as a friend (perhaps Herodes was not yet Marcus' tutor), but allowed that Marcus might be correct, and agreed that the case should not be made into a spectacle. He nonetheless affirmed his intent {{to make use of the}} material available: [...] "I warn you that I won't even use in a disproportionate way the opportunity that I have in my case, for the charges are frightful and must be spoken of as frightful. Those in particular which refer to the beating and robbing I will describe in such a way that they savour of gall and bile. If <b>I</b> <b>happen</b> <b>to</b> call him an uneducated little Greek it will not mean war to the death." [...] Marcus was satisfied with Fronto's response.|$|E

2500|$|Following the {{production}} of series one, Davies took Clarke and Coduri out for dinner to discuss their contracts for the second series. Davies reveals that Clarke was excited about Mickey's development in the second series, particularly having the chance to carry a large gun and be an action hero. Clarke noted that he was [...] "amazed" [...] by the scripts for the second series, as he felt Mickey had at times been written as a [...] "buffoon". He felt that the character had gotten [...] "progressively braver" [...] throughout the series and that as an actor he found it fulfilling that people had gone from disliking the character to saying [...] "how they love this guy now". Mickey's character arc sees him join the Doctor and Rose as a companion, becoming in turn the shows first ethnic minority companion. Billie Piper explained that this upsets Rose initially because she [...] "likes to keep her life separate" [...] and [...] "wants The Doctor to herself because she's selfish like that". Tennant stated that through his actions, Mickey [...] "earns his spot on board the TARDIS". Clarke stated that he didn't {{want to focus on}} his status as the show's first ethnic minority companion, stating [...] "the fact that <b>I</b> <b>happen</b> <b>to</b> be a black actor is beside the point, I'm an actor first". However, he felt that it provided a positive effect in that young fans of ethnic origin would no longer have to be a monster or alien when role-playing characters from the series.|$|E
2500|$|In November 2013, Schoolboy Q {{expressed}} he {{felt there}} were no more gangsta rappers. In an interview, Schoolboy Q discussed his status as a gangsta rapper: [...] "I'm not one of them rappers that's scared to put a title on their name," [...] Schoolboy Q said during an interview with MTV." [...] Conscious rappers never like to be called conscious rappers and a lyrical rapper never like to be a party rapper. I'm a gangsta rapper, that's who I am. <b>I</b> <b>happen</b> <b>to</b> make fun records at the same time, that's what I do. I joke, I bag on niggas, my personality is like that, but I am a gangsta rapper and that's what I'm gonna bring to the table." [...] During the interview, Schoolboy Q then added that gangsta rappers are nowhere to be found today: [...] "There's no more gangsta rappers. It's just trap music now. So I wanna get that old feeling back that I do naturally. I'm not necessarily trying to bring gangsta rap back. I'm just trying to let you know it's still here and I'm a part of it. I feel like I'm the only one out of the coast that's doing this gangsta rap shit the way that it used to be done...how niggas used to put detail in their music, not just going to the club and turning up." [...] Schoolboy Q said {{that he is going to}} bring that style in Oxymoron: [...] "I'm just telling my story and what I grew up around and what I seen and what I did and I wanna put that in the light instead of everybody just smiling. Like Eminem said, 'Whatever happened to wildin' out and being violent? / Whatever happened to catchin a good-ol' fashioned passionate ass-whoopin' and getting your shoes coat and your hat tooken?' [...] "I'm one of them niggas," [...] Schoolboy Q continued. [...] "Whatever happened to that? I don't want niggas to get beat up or no shit like that, but at the end of the day, that is a part of life and I like that type of music. That's what pushed West Coast music to where it was at like when Dre, Snoop and all them...Dogg Pound.
