These latter four kinds of leaves do not differ in texture in a manner which could make them disagreeable to worms; they all have a strong taste, but so have the four first mentioned kinds of leaves; and the wide difference in the result must be attributed to a preference by the worms for one taste over another.|$|E

He {{swallowed}} it in the excitement of the moment. Did he like it or did he not? His mind was curiously careless. He would try another bit. It really wasn't bad--it was good. He forgot his troubles {{in the interest of the}} immediate moment. Playing with death it was. He took another bite, and then deliberately finished a mouthful. A curious, tingling sensation began in his finger-tips and toes. His pulse began to move faster. The blood in his ears sounded like a mill-race. [...] "Try bi' more," [...] said Mr. Coombes. He turned and looked about him, and found his feet unsteady. He saw, and struggled towards, a little patch of purple a dozen yards away. [...] "Jol' goo' stuff," [...] said Mr. Coombes.

60|$|It is {{probably}} {{this lack of}} taste on K'dunk's part that accounts for the astonishing variety in his food. Nothing {{in the shape of}} an insect seemed to come amiss to him. Flies, wasps, crickets, caterpillars, doodle-bugs, and beetles of every description were all treated alike to the same red flash of his tongue and the blinking gulp. A half-dozen boys and girls, who were watching the queer pet with me, were put to their wits' end to find something that he would not eat. One boy, who picked huckleberries, brought in three or four of the disagreeable little bugs, known without a name by every country boy, that have the skunk habit of emitting overpowering odors when disturbed, thinking that he had found a poser for our pet; but K'dunk gobbled them up {{as if they had been}} set before him as a relish to tickle his appetite. Another brought potato bugs; but these too were fish for K'dunk's net. Then a third boy, who had charge of a kitchen garden, went away wagging his head and saying that he had just picked something that no living thing would eat. When he came back he had a <b>horse-radish</b> bottle that swarmed with squash-bugs, twenty or thirty of the vile-smelling things, which he dumped out on the ground and stirred up with a stick.|$|E
6000|$|It may be {{presumed that}} all animals which feed on various {{substances}} possess {{the sense of}} taste, and this is certainly the case with worms. Cabbage-leaves are much liked by worms; {{and it appears that}} they can distinguish between different varieties; but this may perhaps be owing to differences in their texture. On eleven occasions pieces of the fresh leaves of a common green variety and of the red variety used for pickling were given them, and they preferred the green, the red being either wholly neglected or much less gnawed. On two other occasions, however, they seemed to prefer the red. Half-decayed leaves of the red variety and fresh leaves of the green were attacked about equally. When leaves of the cabbage, <b>horse-radish</b> (a favourite food) and of the onion were given together, the latter were always, and manifestly preferred. Leaves of the cabbage, lime-tree, Ampelopsis, parsnip (Pastinaca), and celery (Apium) were likewise given together; and those of the celery were first eaten. But when leaves of cabbage, turnip, beet, celery, wild cherry and carrots were given together, the two latter kinds, especially those of the carrot, were preferred to all the others, including those of celery. It was also manifest after many trials that wild cherry leaves were greatly preferred to those of the lime-tree and hazel (Corylus). [...] According to Mr. Bridgman the half-decayed leaves of Phlox verna are particularly liked by worms. {16} ...|$|E
6000|$|This was {{the secret}} of his tender, unassuming ministrations. He had none of that {{shrinking}} timidity, that fear of intrusion, that uneasiness {{in the presence of}} the tragic and the pitiful, which so often numb and oppress those who would willingly give themselves and their best to the needy and suffering, but whose intellect misgives them. He was that formidable phenomenon, a dreamer of action. But he possessed a sovran good sense. Food and rest and clean clothes were his scrupulous preparation for his visits. He always assumed as cheerful an appearance as possible. Armed with bright new five-cent and ten-cent bills (the wounded, he found, were often [...] "broke," [...] and the sight of a little money [...] "helped their spirits"), with books and stationery and tobacco, for one a twist of good strong green tea, for another a good home-made rice-pudding, or a jar of sparkling but innocent blackberry and cherry syrup, a small bottle of <b>horse-radish</b> pickle, or a large handsome apple, he would [...] "make friends."

60|$|At {{first sight}} {{it might seem}} as though there were hardly enough of such pungent and fiery things in {{existence}} to make it worth while {{for us to be}} provided with a special mechanism for guarding against them. That is true enough, no doubt, as regards our modern civilised life; though, even now, it is perhaps just as well that our children should have an internal monitor (other than conscience) to dissuade them immediately from indiscriminate indulgence in photographic chemicals, the contents of stray medicine bottles, and the best dried West India chilies. But in an earlier period of progress, and especially in tropical countries (where the Darwinians have now decided the human race made its first début upon this or any other stage), things were very different indeed. Pungent and poisonous plants and fruits abounded on every side. We have all of us in our youth been taken in by some too cruelly waggish companion, who insisted upon making us eat the bright, glossy leaves of the common English arum, which without look pretty and juicy enough, but within are full of the concentrated essence of pungency and profanity. Well, there are hundreds of such plants, even in cold climates, to tempt the eyes and poison the veins of unsuspecting cattle or childish humanity. There is buttercup, so horribly acrid that cows carefully avoid it in their closest cropped pastures; and yet your cow is not usually a too dainty animal. There is aconite, the deadly poison with which Dr. Lamson removed his troublesome relatives. There is baneberry, whose very name sufficiently describes its dangerous nature. There are <b>horse-radish,</b> and stinging rocket, and biting wall-pepper, and still smarter water-pepper, and worm-wood, and nightshade, and spurge, and hemlock, and half a dozen other equally unpleasant weeds. All of these have acquired their pungent and poisonous properties, just as nettles have acquired their sting, and thistles their thorns, in order to prevent animals from browsing upon them and destroying them. And the animals in turn have acquired a very delicate sense of pungency on purpose to warn them beforehand of the existence of such dangerous and undesirable qualities in the plants which they might otherwise be tempted incautiously to swallow.|$|E

40|$|The {{research}} study {{is aimed at}} evaluation of natural plant antibiotics utilization among college students (554) with different subject study (Pre-school and elementary education, Biology, Regional Tourism, Horticulture, Physical education) from 3 countries - Slovak Republic, Czech Republic and Hungary. The attention {{has been focused on}} natural antibiotics in plants - vegetables (garlic, onion and horse radish) and the frequency of their consumption among college students. From the research results there is evident that majority of students had basic knowledge about natural plant antibiotics (85 % of respondents) and they utilize them in everyday life (60. 3 %). The prevailing number of students utilizes synthetic antibiotics only rarely - once a year (33. 4 %) or never (37. 5 %). From achieved results about exact plants (garlic, onion and horse radish) consumption, the majority of respondents consume garlic once a week (42. 2 %); on the daily base the highest usage was noticed in the group of Slovak students with the subject of Physical education (32. 1 %) that could be considered as statistically different in comparison with the rest of groups. On the contrary, the lowest garlic consumption was noticed for students of biology (23. 5 %) and only small amount of students (3. 6 %) claimed that they have never included garlic into their diet. As for the onion, the majority of respondents (42. 10 %) also consume this commodity once a week; everyday consumption was noticed again especially between Slovak students with the subject of Physical education (32. 1 %) and Horticulture (31. 1 %). The results of these groups significantly differed from results of other groups. Third studied vegetable, <b>horse-radish,</b> it has never been consumed by Slovak students of Pre-school and elementary education in Slovak language (47. 9 %) that has been significantly distinguishable from another groups.
