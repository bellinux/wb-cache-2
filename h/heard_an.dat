5|$|Foliot {{attended}} the Second Lateran Council, called by Pope Innocent II. It opened on 4April 1139, and among other matters <b>heard</b> <b>an</b> appeal from the Empress Matilda concerning her {{claim to the}} throne of England. Matilda was the daughter and only surviving legitimate child of King Henry I, but following her father's death in late 1135 her cousin Stephen, the son of Henry's sister, had seized the crown. By 1139 Matilda had gathered supporters and was contesting Stephen's right to the throne.|$|E
5|$|On {{the night}} of 12 May, U-6 headed out to try to {{intercept}} shipping between Santa Maria di Leuca and Valona. Linienschiffsleutnant Hugo von Falkhausen, U-6s commander since November 1915, attempted to pass underneath two drifters that formed {{a part of the}} Otranto Barrage. While submerged, von Falkhausen <b>heard</b> <b>an</b> unexplained noise on the hull of the boat, which was likely the sound of U-6 fouling one of the anti-submarine nets deployed from the drifter Calistoga. The drifter's skipper was alerted to the submarine's presence when one of the indicator buoys had fired. Calistoga launched signal flares that attracted the attention of two nearby drifters Dulcie Doris and Evening Star II. In the meantime, von Falkhausen surfaced U-6 to try to cut loose the buoy being dragged behind his boat. When the hatch was opened, the crew discovered the boat entangled in the net.|$|E

40|$|In an {{eye-tracking}} study, {{we examined}} how fine-grained phonetic detail, such as segment duration, influences the lexical competition process during spoken word recognition. Dutch listeners' eye movements to pictures of four objects were monitored as they heard sentences {{in which a}} stop-initial target word (e. g., pijp "pipe") was preceded by an [s]. The participants made more fixations to pictures of cluster-initial words (e. g., spijker "nail") when they <b>heard</b> <b>a</b> long [s] (mean duration, 103 msec) than when they <b>heard</b> <b>a</b> short [s] (mean duration, 73 msec). Conversely, the participants made more fixations to pictures of the stop-initial words when they <b>heard</b> <b>a</b> short [s] than when they <b>heard</b> <b>a</b> long [s]. Lexical competition between stop- and cluster-initial words, therefore, is modulated by segment duration differences of only 30 msec...|$|R

The print had been in circulation since 1928, starting off with a film distributor, then passed to a private collector, an art foundation and finally the Museo del Cine. The print was investigated by the museum curator, Argentinian film collector, curator-historian and TV presenter Fernando Martín Peña, after he <b>heard</b> <b>an</b> anecdote from a cinema club manager, expressing surprise at the length of a print of Metropolis he had viewed.|$|E
25|$|Upon {{a review}} of the case, the Court of Appeal will make a {{determination}} on the question and may then alter the sentence passed, pass a sentence, or give such judgment or make such order as it deems fit. The Court of Appeal exercises a similar power to determine questions of law reserved for its decision by the High Court or the Public Prosecutor after the High Court has <b>heard</b> <b>an</b> appeal from a State Court or has exercised its revisionary jurisdiction. Any question of law on which there is a conflict of judicial authority is deemed to be a question of public interest.|$|E
25|$|During the inquest, {{evidence}} {{confirmed that}} the video tapes had been changed by a station supervisor in three video recorders monitoring the station CCTV, at 3:09am {{on the morning of}} the shooting. These machines emit an audible noise if they are not receiving an audio/video signal, but there was no indication the supervisor <b>heard</b> <b>an</b> alarm. Three days later the equipment was tested and it was found that a cable transmitting the CCTV images to the video recorders had been damaged or cut, possibly during refurbishment work (the cable may have been severed when a workman stepped on it); the following day a communications expert {{confirmed that the}} alarm was sounding as a result of this loss of signal.|$|E

25|$|In 1852, in {{his famous}} paper on the change of {{wavelength}} of light, he described the phenomenon of fluorescence, as exhibited by fluorspar and uranium glass, materials which he viewed as having the power to convert invisible ultra-violet radiation into radiation of longer wavelengths that are visible. The Stokes shift, which describes this conversion, is named in Stokes' honour. A mechanical model, illustrating the dynamical principle of Stokes's explanation was shown. The offshoot of this, Stokes line, {{is the basis of}} Raman scattering. In 1883, during a lecture at the Royal Institution, Lord Kelvin said he had <b>heard</b> <b>an</b> account of it from Stokes many years before, and had repeatedly but vainly begged him to publish it.|$|E
25|$|Following the divisional {{court hearing}} into Lutfur Rahman {{application}} to dismiss and the petitioners {{application for a}}n adjournment of their application for a protective costs order, Supperstone J sitting on his own <b>heard</b> <b>an</b> application by the petitioners to move the trial outside of Tower Hamlets for fear of intimidation by supporters of Rahman. This request {{was rejected by the}} court which held the prospect of large number of attendees and the associated potential for public rowdiness was not enough to justify ignoring the long-standing provision within primary legislation requiring trials to be held in the local government area for which the election was held, in this case the London Borough of Tower Hamlets.|$|E
25|$|The Avro York was a {{military}} trooping flight for the British Air Ministry from Stansted Airport in the United Kingdom to Jamaica with six crew and 33 passengers, including both soldiers and families. The aircraft had stopped at Lajes Field in the Azores and departed at 23:25 on 1 February 1953 for Gander Airport in Newfoundland. The aircraft transmitted Positional Operational Meteorological Reports at approximately one-hour intervals from 00:10 to 04:25 on 2 February. At 04:10 the aircraft position was given as 44°32'N 41°38'W. At 05:31 Gander <b>heard</b> <b>an</b> Urgency signal from the aircraft giving a position a minute before the message as 46°15'N 46°31'W.

Counsel for Rahman argued for the dismissal {{on the grounds that}} the petition's many allegations of electoral offences was stated without sufficient details as to the basis of the allegations. In rejecting the application for dismissal, the court referenced among other things Saghir & Ors v Najib & Ors and Hussein & Ors v Khan & Ors in support of the petitioners' position that election court have at least since the mid-nineteenth century allowed further details to be provided on request, instead of dismissing an election petition outright, an action the divisional court then undertook by ordering for more details to be provided by the petitioners in response to request previously made by both respondents individually.|$|E
25|$|The {{attack was}} {{witnessed}} by numerous people. One of two Belgian {{officers in the}} garden of a house in Kanombe, the district in which the airport is located, saw and heard the first missile climb into the sky, saw a red flash in the sky and <b>heard</b> <b>an</b> aircraft engine stopping, followed by another missile. He immediately called Major de Saint-Quentin, part of the French team attached to the Rwandan para-commando battalion Commandos de recherche et d'action en profondeur, who advised him to organize protection for his Belgian comrades. Similarly, another Belgian officer stationed in an unused airport control tower saw the lights of an approaching aircraft, a light traveling upward from the ground and the aircraft lights going out. This was followed by a second light rising from the same place as the first and the plane turning into a falling ball of fire. This officer immediately radioed his company commander, who confirmed with the operational control tower that the plane was the presidential aircraft.|$|E
