40|$|Middle East {{respiratory}} syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) is {{a recently}} reported virus that {{is associated with}} severe, life threatening and rapidly spreading primarily respiratory illness called the Middle East respiratory syndrome. MERS-CoV possesses a unique positive-sense single-stranded RNA and can undergo rapid mutation in the viral genome. This results in antigenic switching and genetic variation, finally leading to the emergence of novel and new MERS-CoV subtypes which are uncontrollable by vaccines. Researchers are also finding difficulties to sort out therapeutic intervention strategies for MERS-CoV. This virus can spread from <b>human</b> <b>to</b> <b>human,</b> but <b>transmission</b> from dromedary camels <b>to</b> <b>humans</b> plays a crucial epidemiological significance. Dromedary camel acts as “gene mixing vessels” for MERS-CoV and these virus particles undergo rapid change in them. Viral receptors called dipeptidyl peptidase- 4 are important receptors for attachment and spread of MERS-CoV in humans. The current method of laboratory confirmation is through real-time polymerase chain reaction on bronchoalveolar lavage, sputum and tracheal aspirates.

50|$|Human tanapox {{has been}} mostly {{documented}} in Kenya and Zaire, {{but it is}} believed to occur much more widely throughout tropical Africa.

During the Kenyan epidemics of 1957 and 1962, cases of tanapox were reported more frequently among persons who worked or played close to the river. As a result of this, researchers concluded that tanapox is most likely a zoonosis. However, neither the reservoir host nor the mode of transmission from wild animal to human is known.

HEV is mainly transmitted by the fecal–oral route in endemic areas through drinking of contaminated water. However, zoonotic <b>transmission</b> from animal reservoirs <b>to</b> <b>humans</b> has also been suggested. Three additional routes of HEV transmission have been proposed <b>to</b> occur: blood borne, <b>human</b> <b>to</b> <b>human,</b> and vertical <b>transmission</b> from mother to child. Acute HEV {{infection is}} usually diagnosed by detecting specific anti-HEV antibodies. However, {{the performance of the}} available assays in different settings is not optimal. Analysis of HEV ribonucleic acid in biologic specimens such as stools, serum, and liver biopsy by using nucleic acid amplification techniques is also employed. Nonetheless, additional consensus regarding the best technologies suitable for serosurveys and diagnosis of acute HEV infection is also needed. This review article summarizes the current status of HEV infection end epidemiology with particular emphasis in transmission, diagnosis, and clinical management.

50|$|Humans {{in close}} contact with buffaloes are {{susceptible}} to buffalopox, and with the cessation of the smallpox vaccine in 1980; humans do not develop an antibody titer against the Poxviridae, and have become even more susceptible to viruses like buffalopox. In humans the virus causes lesions that are mainly confined to the hands, forehead, face, buttocks, and legs, and occasionally lymphadenopathy. <b>Human</b> <b>to</b> <b>human</b> <b>transmission</b> has not been reported. Milking of infected animals {{is one of the major}} modes of spread.

50|$|Infected birds pass on H5N1 {{through their}} saliva, nasal secretions, and feces.

Because migratory birds are among the carriers of the H5N1 virus it may spread to {{all parts of the}} world. Past outbreaks of avian flu have often originated in crowded conditions in southeast and east Asia, where humans, pigs, and poultry live in close quarters. In these conditions a virus is more likely to mutate into a form that more easily infects humans.

5000|$|If, in fact, HFV is not {{pathogenic}} {{in humans}} {{and is a}} retrovirus, it is an ideal vector for gene therapy. Another important feature of the virus is that the Gag, Pol, and Env proteins are synthesized independently; {{this is important because}} it means that each protein can be provided in trans on three different plasmids to create a stable packaging cell line. Having this would possibly reduce the need for a replication-competent helper virus. [...] Other advantages are <b>human</b> <b>to</b> <b>human</b> <b>transmission</b> has never been reported, it has a safer spectrum of insertional mutagenesis than other retroviruses, and since there are two promoters in the genome, {{it may be possible to}} make a vector that expresses the foreign genes under the control of both promoters.

50|$|The {{species is}} keratinophilic {{and is known}} for causing {{diseases}} on human skin. The genus Microsporum contains a number of pathogens to both humans and animals. The diseases it causes is classified as Tinea or ringworm, with an adjective prescribing to the afflicted body part. Infection usually occurs as Tinea capitis with suppuration and kerion formation. Pus formation can also occur from palpitated hair follicles. The species is ectothrix in terms of hair infection and can infect more than {{one part of the}} scalp at a time. The fungus produces hyphal growth at the scalp, and produces fronds (perforating organs) that invade the hair perpendicularly at the cortex {{near the edge of the}} cuticles. This can cause hair to be easily removed and dislodged from the scalp. Additionally, individuals with thick dark hair have a tendency to have a more severe inflammatory response. Tinea corporis, as well; this is characterized as an intense inflammatory response resembling a bacterial infection, thus surgical intervention is not needed because inflammation is due to the fungus alone. Also, Tinea pedis, or athletes foot is common, while Tinea unguium is rare. Additionally Tinea manuum, of the thighs may occur as nodular granulomatous perifolliculitis, has been noted with infection of the thighs. Favus, (a severe form of Tinea capitis) is rarely seen to be caused by this fungus. However the most common cause in humans seems to be Tinea capitis and Tinea corporis. As such clinical manifestations are localized to localization of contact. Transmission from animals to humans is supported; especially in those constrained to agricultural work. Handlers of laboratory animals, including guinea pigs, cats, and rabbits can also be at risk of contracting the fungi if the animals were predisposed to a certain area. The fungus infects animals that associate themselves with soil on a repeated basis. So as such animals like cattle are commonly affected but horses, rodents, monkeys and dogs have a tendency to acquire it. Entry of the fungus or contraction of one or more of these diseases is caused by deposition on human skin, and contact with soil is usually the primary cause of infection. Quantitatively, animal or humans must acquire at least ten fungal spores on a keratin rich surface in order to acquire an infection. Additionally of the mating types, the positive strain is more pathogenic then the negative strain. Identification is usually classified on the appearance of the fungus on the host via a sample culture. Both M. gypseum and M. fulvum have been commonly isolated from patients with human infections of the disease. <b>Human</b> <b>to</b> <b>human</b> <b>transmission</b> is known to occur.|$|E

Between April and July the cryptosporidiosis rate was positively related to maximum river flow in the current month. Between August and November cryptosporidiosis was also positively linked to maximum river flows in the current month but only after accounting for the previous month’s temperature, precipitation and monthly cryptosporidiosis rate.
