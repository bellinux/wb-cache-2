500|$|Ratner {{collaborated with}} Penn and Kinberg in rearranging the plot {{structure}} of the film. Originally, the Golden Gate Bridge sequence {{was in the middle}} of the film, where the moved bridge was used by Magneto to free mutants being held prisoners on Alcatraz, and the climax was set in [...] Washington, D.C.. Ratner felt too many recent action films, such as Planet of the Apes and X2 itself, had their ending in Washington, and the Golden Gate sequence [...] "would be the biggest sequence <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>entire</b> career", and suggested to instead put the Worthington laboratory in Alcatraz, along with [...] "creating a face for the cure", which became the character of Jimmy/Leech. Kinberg agreed, as he previously argued with Penn about [...] "blowing so many things early in the movie".|$|E
500|$|On [...] "What Is Life", Spector {{provided}} {{what music}} critic David Fricke terms [...] "echo-drenched theater", {{in the form}} of reverb-heavy brass, soaring strings (arranged by John Barham) and [...] "a choir of multitracked Harrisons". The vocals and Barham's contribution, along with a brief slide-guitar commentary from Harrison over the final verse, were overdubbed at Trident Studios, most likely during late August through September. Dated 19 August, Spector's written comments on Harrison's early mix of the song had suggested a [...] "proper background voice" [...] was still needed; like sound engineer Ken Scott, Spector would be impressed with the result, saying, [...] "He was a great harmoniser... he could do all the [...] parts himself" [...] and rating Harrison [...] "one of the most commercial musicians and songwriters and quintessential players I've ever known <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>entire</b> career".|$|E

500|$|The title California is {{representative}} of the band's home state, and was picked after the band members realized that they had written multiple songs relating to its cities and culture. The title was also inspired by the season and Feldmann's studio: [...] "It was a perfect California winter, and it was sunny and hot every single day. John's studio, it's basically indoor-outdoor with palm trees everywhere." [...] Though he refrained from dubbing it a concept album, Skiba considered the songs linked thematically: [...] "big and bright and huge and dark and twisted, everything that California is." [...] "The title of this album {{was one of the most}} difficult things I've done <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>entire</b> life," [...] said Hoppus. Alternate titles for the album included No Future, which was dropped because it seemed too negative, and the joke titles OB-GYN Kenobi, Nude Erection, and No Hard Feelings. D*Face also reported that the titles Los Angeles and Riot were nearly used.|$|E
500|$|John Janick, the {{chairman}} and CEO of Interscope Geffen A Records, told Stefani that he was unsure of her songs [...] "connect with people", encouraging her to create an [...] "artistic record" [...] and to skip radio altogether.

She called it [...] "the most personal song" [...] she'd ever written and appreciated Janick's decision commenting: [...] "That's never happened <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>entire</b> career." [...] After writing [...] "Truth", she was inspired to title the album with something similar. By the time several personal themed tracks were completed, Stefani began creating songs dealing with her newfound relationship with Shelton; [...] "Make Me Like You" [...] details [...] "the early stage of their romance", while the title track suggests what the public might think of their romance, with lyrics such as: [...] "They’re all gonna say I’m rebounding, so rebound all over me".|$|E

He helped his team progress through the qualifying rounds of the UEFA Cup, and according to Reuters' correspondent, [...] "capped a brilliant individual performance with two goals" [...] as well as providing the cross for Milan Purović as Red Star beat Roma 3–1 in the third match of the group stage. His first goal, a header, appeared to have been scored from an offside position, but for the second, in the 86th minute, he dispossessed Philippe Mexès, evaded two more opponents, and bent the ball into the top corner from [...] with his weaker left foot. He said afterwards, [...] "I've never scored a goal like that <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>entire</b> career.

That is not journalism, and those who engage in it are not journalists. They should stop pretending to be. The news organizations they work for should stop pretending, too. ... I've been <b>in</b> journalism <b>my</b> <b>entire</b> adult life, and have often defended it against fellow conservatives who claim the news business is fundamentally corrupt.

500|$|Some reviewers {{felt that}} the story and {{dialogue}} were weak, while the visuals were spectacular. Kenneth Turan's review in the Los Angeles Times was particularly scathing. Dismissing the emotive elements, he stated, [...] "What really brings on the tears is Cameron's insistence that writing this kind of movie is within his abilities. Not only is it not, {{it is not even}} close.", and later claimed that the only reason that the film won Oscars was because of its box office total. Barbara Shulgasser of The San Francisco Examiner gave Titanic one star out of four, citing a friend as saying, [...] "The number of times in this unbelievably badly written script that the two [...] refer to each other by name was an indication of just how dramatically the script lacked anything more interesting for the actors to say." [...] Also, filmmaker Robert Altman called it [...] "the most dreadful piece of work I've ever seen <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>entire</b> life". In his 2012 study of the lives of the passengers on the Titanic, historian Richard Davenport-Hines said, [...] "Cameron's film diabolized rich Americans and educated English, anathematizing their emotional restraint, good tailoring, punctilious manners and grammatical training, while it made romantic heroes of the poor Irish and the unlettered".|$|E
500|$|Lansbury was {{defensive}} about Jessica Fletcher, having creative input over the character's costumes, makeup and hair, and rejecting pressure from network executives {{to put her}} in a relationship, believing that the character should remain a strong single female. When she believed that a scriptwriter had made Jessica do or say things that did not fit with the character's personality, Lansbury ensured that the script was changed. She saw Jessica as a role model for older female viewers, praising her [...] "enormous, universal appeal – that was an accomplishment I never expected <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>entire</b> life." [...] Lansbury biographers Rob Edelman and Audrey E. Kupferberg described the series as [...] "a television landmark" [...] in the U.S. for having an older female character as the protagonist, thereby paving the way for later series like The Golden Girls. Lansbury herself noted that [...] "I think it's the first time a show has really been aimed at the middle aged audience", and although it was most popular among senior citizens, it gradually gained a younger audience; by 1991, a third of viewers were under fifty. It gained continually high ratings throughout most of its run, outdoing rivals in its time slot such as Steven Spielberg's Amazing Stories on NBC. In February 1987, a spin-off was produced, The Law & Harry McGraw, although it was short-lived.|$|E

Azaria made his first appearance as Sir Lancelot, the French Taunter, and four other characters in Spamalot, the musical version of Monty Python and the Holy Grail, which opened in Chicago in December 2004, {{before moving to the}} Shubert Theatre on Broadway. The show met with critical acclaim, receiving fourteen Tony Award nominations in 2005, with Azaria being nominated for Best Performance by a Leading Actor in a Musical. Reuniting with The Birdcage director Mike Nichols, and being a huge Monty Python fan, he saw it as an opportunity he could not pass up, describing it as [...] "so much fun that I haven't realized how tiring it is", and [...] "the most fun that I've ever had <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>entire</b> life". He took a break from the show in June 2005, with Alan Tudyk filling in for him, to work on Huff, but returned in December 2005. In late 2007 he starred in Aaron Sorkin's The Farnsworth Invention, playing RCA head David Sarnoff. In 2016, he starred in the world premiere of Dry Powder opposite Claire Danes, John Krasinski, and Sanjit De Silva, directed by Thomas Kail, at the off-Broadway Public Theater in New York City.|$|E
