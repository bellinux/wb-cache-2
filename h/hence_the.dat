5|$|Ammianus' {{narrative}} {{makes clear}} that Chnodomar ordered an unusually strong levy. <b>Hence</b> <b>the</b> presence at Strasbourg of all eight contemporary Alamanni kings and of the non-Alammanni allies.|$|E
5|$|An annular eclipse {{occurs when}} the Sun and Moon are exactly {{in line with the}} Earth, but the {{apparent}} size of the Moon is smaller than that of the Sun. <b>Hence</b> <b>the</b> Sun appears as a very bright ring, or annulus, surrounding the dark disk of the Moon.|$|E
5|$|Boron-doped {{diamonds}} transmit light down to ~250nm {{and absorb}} some red and infrared light (<b>hence</b> <b>the</b> blue color); they may phosphoresce blue after exposure to shortwave ultraviolet light. Apart from optical absorption, boron acceptors {{have been detected}} by electron paramagnetic resonance.|$|E
6000|$|<b>Hence</b> came <b>the</b> despots darling dream, [...] a Church to {{rule and}} sway <b>the</b> State; <b>Hence</b> sprang <b>the</b> train of countless griefs [...] in priestly sway and rule innate.|$|R
5000|$|Released in 1993, {{the fifth}} album was Cash In Chaos: World Tour. At this point Knott {{announced}} that he was changing the name of LSU to 'Cash in Chaos' (<b>henced</b> <b>the</b> mixed band name for this release).|$|R
3000|$|..., {{more time}} is {{allocated}} to the sensors for EH which as a result will increase the harvested energy and <b>hence</b> increase <b>the</b> transmit power of sensors. But for the users, less time is allocated for transmitting and <b>hence</b> reduce <b>the</b> SE.|$|R
5|$|Each tissue {{compartment}} {{is assumed}} to fully saturate/desaturate in 6 half-times. This means desaturation of the slowest (120 min) compartment takes 12 hours – <b>hence</b> <b>the</b> 12-hour surface interval before a dive is not considered repetitive with these tables.|$|E
5|$|Even {{though this}} is the franchise's first Super Bowl victory, it is their 10th league {{championship}} <b>hence</b> <b>the</b> number 10 after the Super Bowl I line.|$|E
5|$|<b>Hence</b> <b>the</b> atomic nuclei, {{which are}} much heavier than an electron, {{contribute}} negligibly to the scattered X-rays.|$|E
25|$|Phenytoin, reduces {{phenytoin}} excretion, <b>hence</b> increasing <b>the</b> {{potential for}} toxicity.|$|R
5000|$|... <b>hence</b> for <b>the</b> inverse {{iteration}} method similar result sounds as: ...|$|R
30|$|<b>Hence,</b> using <b>the</b> {{induction}} method, {{we arrive}} at the following result.|$|R
5|$|<b>Hence,</b> <b>the</b> Pyramid Texts of {{the pyramid}} of Unas {{incorporate}} instructions for ritual actions and words to be spoken, suggesting that they were precisely those performed and recited during {{the cult of the}} king in his mortuary temple.|$|E
5|$|<b>Hence,</b> <b>the</b> court {{reasoned}} that Hemi's {{decision not to}} do business with New York indicated that it should have foreseen being brought to court in Illinois for selling cigarettes to Illinois residents.|$|E
5|$|Liquid {{nitrogen}} readily evaporates to form gaseous nitrogen, and <b>hence</b> <b>the</b> precautions {{associated with}} gaseous nitrogen {{also apply to}} liquid nitrogen. For example, oxygen sensors are sometimes used as a safety precaution when working with liquid nitrogen to alert workers of gas spills into a confined space.|$|E
50|$|Selangor River {{sources from}} this area, <b>hence</b> giving <b>the</b> district's name.|$|R
50|$|Results are immediate. <b>Hence</b> on <b>the</b> spot {{decisions}} can be made.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Hence,</b> in <b>the</b> energy norm, the {{inequality}} in Céa's lemma becomes ...|$|R
5|$|Once again, {{this is a}} simplification. Periodic {{motions of}} the Moon and {{apparent}} periodic motions of the Sun (actually of Earth in its orbit) cause short-term small-amplitude periodic oscillations of Earth's axis, and <b>hence</b> <b>the</b> celestial equator, known as nutation.|$|E
5|$|Reptation is a snake-like {{movement}} (<b>hence</b> <b>the</b> name) involving sequential {{motion of}} cluster sub-units (see figure 11(c)).|$|E
5|$|Room of Mars: is {{characterized}} by works by Rubens: the allegories representing the Consequences of War (<b>hence</b> <b>the</b> name of the room) and the Four Philosophers (among them Rubens portrayed himself, on the left). On the vault is a fresco by Pietro da Cortona, Triumph of the Medici.|$|E
25|$|Quinidine, reduces urinary {{excretion}} of quinidine, <b>hence</b> increasing <b>the</b> {{potential for}} toxicity.|$|R
60|$|<b>Hence,</b> if <b>the</b> {{original}} Set were true, {{this would}} also be true.|$|R
30|$|<b>Hence,</b> from <b>the</b> above {{fact and}} (3.5)-(3.9), the desired result (3.4) follows.|$|R
5|$|Ship {{collisions}} frequently {{occur in}} Tsushima Strait {{and result in}} damaging all of whales, passengers, and vessels, <b>hence</b> <b>the</b> Japanese Coast Guard has started visual recordings of large cetaceans in Tsushima Strait to inform operating vessels in the areas.|$|E
5|$|Similarly, in the Rubinstein {{variation}} 3...Ng4 4.Bf4 with 4...Nc6 5.Nf3 Bb4+ 6.Nc3, after 6...Bxc3+ 7.bxc3 White is {{saddled with}} doubled pawns in c3 and c4 that limit {{the scope of}} his bishop pair. <b>Hence</b> <b>the</b> push c4–c5 {{can be used to}} free the light-squared bishop and disrupt Black's position.|$|E
5|$|The inaugural H–O–R–S–E Competition was {{sponsored}} by American auto insurance company GEICO and <b>hence</b> <b>the</b> word G–E–I–C–O was used in replacement of H–O–R–S–E. Three NBA players, Kevin Durant, Joe Johnson and O. J. Mayo were selected {{to compete in the}} H–O–R–S–E competition.|$|E
30|$|Case 1 : Words have {{multiple}} meanings, <b>hence</b> diversifies <b>the</b> information extraction.|$|R
5000|$|Quinidine, reduces urinary {{excretion}} of quinidine, <b>hence</b> increasing <b>the</b> {{potential for}} toxicity.|$|R

5|$|The {{supernova}} classification type {{is closely}} tied to the type of star {{at the time of the}} collapse. The occurrence of each type of supernova depends dramatically on the metallicity, and <b>hence</b> <b>the</b> age of the host galaxy.|$|E
5|$|Adam Henry Carter is {{a fictional}} {{character}} from the BBC espionage television series Spooks, which follows {{the exploits of}} Section D, a counter-terrorism division of MI5. He is portrayed by British actor Rupert Penry-Jones. The character is a former MI6 officer who takes charge as the chief of Section D, and <b>hence</b> <b>the</b> head protagonist following the departure of Tom Quinn in series three.|$|E
5|$|An {{estimated}} 76% of Russia’s exports {{depend on}} resources extracted (or manufactured) in Siberia. In order to transport goods from East Asia to Europe, {{they must be}} transported through Siberia by rail. <b>Hence,</b> <b>the</b> region {{plays an important role}} in trade. However, it remains less developed than Russia’s western regions and modernisation plans are ongoing.|$|E

50|$|The name Bhao {{is said to}} mean {{those who}} inspire fear in the local Dogri language, which is spoken in Jammu. According to tribal legends, when the tribe settled in Jammu, it {{inspired}} fear among its enemies, and <b>hence</b> got <b>the</b> name but others say the Bhao were free booters or looters and <b>hence</b> earned <b>the</b> title.|$|R
