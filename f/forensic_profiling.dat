2500|$|Familial DNA searching (sometimes {{referred}} to as [...] "familial DNA" [...] or [...] "familial DNA database searching") is the practice of creating new investigative leads in cases where DNA evidence found {{at the scene of}} a crime (<b>forensic</b> <b>profile)</b> strongly resembles that of an existing DNA profile (offender profile) in a state DNA database but there is not an exact match. After all other leads have been exhausted, investigators may use specially developed software to compare the <b>forensic</b> <b>profile</b> to all profiles taken from a state's DNA database to generate a list of those offenders already in the database {{who are most likely to}} be a very close relative of the individual whose DNA is in the <b>forensic</b> <b>profile.</b> To eliminate the majority of this list when the forensic DNA is a man's, crime lab technicians conduct Y-STR analysis. Using standard investigative techniques, authorities are then able to build a family tree. The family tree is populated from information gathered from public records and criminal justice records. Investigators rule out family members' involvement in the crime by finding excluding factors such as sex, living out of state or being incarcerated when the crime was committed. They may also use other leads from the case, such as witness or victim statements, to identify a suspect. Once a suspect has been identified, investigators seek to legally obtain a DNA sample from the suspect. This suspect DNA profile is then compared to the sample found at the crime scene to definitively identify the suspect as the source of the crime scene DNA.|$|R

40|$|Current {{familial}} searching {{strategies are}} developed primarily based on autosomal STR loci, {{since most of}} the offender <b>profiles</b> in the <b>forensic</b> DNA databases do not contain Y-STR or mitochondrial DNA data. There are generally two familial searching methods, Identity-by-State (IBS) based methods or kinship index (KI) based methods. The KI based method is an analytically superior method because the allele frequency information is considered as opposed to solely allele counting. However, multiple KIs should be calculated if the unknown <b>forensic</b> <b>profile</b> may be attributed to multiple possible relevant populations. An important practical issue is the KI threshold to select for limiting the list of candidates from a search. There are generally three strategies of setting the KI threshold for familial searching: (1) SWGDAM recommendation 6; (2) minimum KI$KI threshold; and (3) maximum KI$KI threshold. These strategies were evaluated and compared by using both simulation data and empirical data. The minimum KI will tend to be closer to the KI appropriate for the population of which the <b>forensic</b> <b>profile</b> belongs. The minimum KI$KI threshold performs better than the maximum KI$KI threshold. The SWGDAM strategy may be too stringent for familial searching with large databases (e. g., 1 million or more profiles), because its KI thresholds depend on the database size and the KI thresholds of large databases have a higher probability to exclude true relatives than smaller databases. Minimum KI$KI threshold strategy is a better option, as it provides the flexibility to adjust the KI threshold according to a pre-determined number of candidates or false positive/negative rates.
