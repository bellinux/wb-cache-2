40|$|A {{theoretical}} {{study of}} the performance of finite oil journal bearings is made, considering the surface roughness effect. The total load supporting ability under such a condition derives from the hydrodynamic as well as asperity contact pressure. These two components of load are calculated separately. The average Reynolds equation for partially lubricated surfaces is used to evaluate hydrodynamic pressure. An analytical expression for average film thickness is obtained and introduced to modify the average Reynolds equation. The resulting differential equation is then solved numerically by finite difference methods for mean hydrodynamic pressure, which in turn gives the <b>hydrodynamic</b> <b>load.</b> Assuming the surface height distribution as Gaussian, the asperity contact pressure is found. The effect of surface roughness parameter, surface pattern, eccentricity ratio, and length to diameter ratio on <b>hydrodynamic</b> <b>load</b> and on side leakage is investigated. It is shown that <b>hydrodynamic</b> <b>load</b> increases with increasing surface roughness when both journal and bearing surfaces have identical roughness structures or when the journal only has a rough surface.

Using Splash 3 D, a three-dimensional numerical model is developed for performing the force evaluation of the OWT.

In contrast to wind turbines, tidal technology has not yet reached maturity and new designs are required in order to take into account cavitation, leading edge roughness, and the high energy density of flowing water. In particular, reinforced blade structures are required to deal with the high <b>hydrodynamic</b> <b>loads</b> experienced by tidal turbines.

40|$|Although {{occurring}} infrequent, {{the emergency}} landing of aircraft on water constitutes a crucial facet within aviation safety and, hence, it engages aircraft manufacturers within design and certification processes. Currently employed methods to analyze ditching comprise experimental testing, comparison with already ditching-certified aircraft designs, and semi-analytical {{as well as}} uncoupled numerical simulations. Since these means comprise several drawbacks and limitations, there is the motivation to employ advanced, coupled numerical methods to enhance the analysis capabilities of the structural behavior under ditching loads. Moreover, there is no fundamental understanding of the occurring hydrodynamic phenomena, the detailed fluid-structure interaction and the dynamic structural response in ditching. The subject {{is of particular interest}} as aforementioned methods do not consider effects due to structural deformations, which limits their validity. It is claimed by the author that structural deformations significantly affect the <b>hydrodynamic</b> <b>loads</b> acting during a ditching, as they modify the boundary conditions the fluid is facing; therefore, they should be taken into account for an accurate assessment of the structural behavior through coupled simulation approaches. In this context, the present thesis investigates the structural behavior under representative impact conditions by means of an evaluation of experimental data as well as numerical simulations. In particular, it is investigated how and to what extent structural deformations affect the <b>hydrodynamic</b> <b>loading</b> during water impact at high horizontal velocity. For that purpose, first {{the state of the art}} of methods for ditching analysis is reviewed with particular focus on advanced numerical simulation approaches. A more detailed insight is given into the coupled approach of Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) and Finite Element (FE) method, as it is adopted in this thesis. Comprehensive experimental data of novel, unique guided ditching experiments conducted by CNR-INSEAN during the research project SMAES are evaluated. Based thereon fundamental knowledge about determining factors and key physical effects involved in the <b>hydrodynamic</b> <b>loading</b> and the corresponding structural response under ditching conditions is established. Starting with a characterization of the hydrodynamics, the structural behavior, and their interaction, the effects of impact conditions combination of pitch angle and horizontal impact velocity), panel curvature, and structural deformations on <b>hydrodynamic</b> <b>loads,</b> resulting forces, and local strains are described. Most interestingly, <b>hydrodynamic</b> <b>loads</b> are found to increase considerably as soon as structural deformations occur, which supports the above thesis. The assessment of the results of this evaluation establishes the basis for the subsequent development and validation of the numerical model. Based on these findings, a numerical simulation model of the guided ditching experiments is developed adopting the coupled SPH-FE approach. Particular focus is put on enhancements of the fluid modeling, which previously did not permit such simulations at high forward velocity. Due to the application of state-of-the-art numerical techniques, the developed simulation model is robust and efficient, which for the first time enables profound numerical analyses. Finally, results of comprehensive parameter studies are presented. These permit validating the developed SPH-FE simulation model based on extensive comparison with experimental data for a broad range of test cases. The regarded parameters are horizontal impact velocity, pitch angle, lateral panel curvature, and panel type (combination of material and thickness). Panels made of aluminum and composite materials with thicknesses between 15 and 0. 8 mm are considered. Subsequently, the validated simulation model is employed to explore and to assess in detail the structural response of highly deformable structures under <b>hydrodynamic</b> <b>loading.</b> The mechanisms that were experimentally identified to affect the <b>hydrodynamic</b> <b>loading</b> of deformable structures are further investigated in order to assess their importance. Consequently, the findings of this numerical investigation corroborate the thesis that structural deformations should be taken into account in the analysis of the structural behavior through coupled simulation approaches.

One potential {{way to meet}} this challenge {{is to reduce the}} uncertainty in wave modeling and hydrodynamic loads calculation for offshore wind support structures design. The thesis covers two aspects for calculating loads acting on a offshore wind support structure: an improved <b>hydrodynamic</b> <b>load</b> model and a modified higher order wave model. In studying <b>hydrodynamic</b> <b>load</b> model, FNV and Rainey s methods, both intended to explain third order phenomena observed on offshore slender structure, are compared and analyzed to solve the surface piercing problem, critical for a slender structure at an extreme sea state. Rainey s new equation is preferred over FNV. Second order irregular wave model, a simple higher order stochastic wave model, enables it to include non-linear contributions from waves. Analysis focuses on how the modified wave model affects wave surface elevation, wave power spectrum and wave kinematics. With improved <b>hydrodynamic</b> <b>load</b> model and wave model introduced, there are in total six methods available to calculate the loads acting on a slender offshore wind support structure. The proposed six methods are invstigated by comparing load statistics and corresponding power spectrum of shear force and bending moment at foundation base. The implementation of non-linear models increases foundation shear and bending moment by 3 % to 34 %For a floating type support structure, the analysis concentrates on dynamic response of structure, including spar hull and mooring lines. With the assistance of numerical tool RIFLEX, the non-linear dynamic problem is solved in time domain by displaying dis- placements and forces at targeted section, mooring lines and cylinder hull. It is observed that the low frequency components exerts a reduction effect on maximum axial force on mooring lines, while higher order frequency effects are absent. Based a simple long term extrapolation, environmental contour line method, the reduction effect is predicted to be 10 % at the mooring line for a 50 -year sea state. When it comes to fatigue analysis, sec- ond order irregular wave model only slightly differs damage level at cylinder hull around surface piercing point, but greatly reduce cycle nubmers on mooring lines. ...|$|E
