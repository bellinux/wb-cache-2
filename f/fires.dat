5|$|The <b>fires</b> in Yellowstone left {{a mosaic}} of areas greatly {{affected}} and others less so. Inside fire perimeters, large expanses of forest were completely untouched. There were three major types of burning. From an aesthetic viewpoint, the most destructive <b>fires</b> were the canopy crown <b>fires</b> that in many places obliterated entire forests. Crown <b>fires</b> accounted for about 41percent of all the area that burned. Mixed <b>fires</b> burned both the canopy and vegetation on the ground, or burned {{one or the other}} as they spread through the forest. Ground <b>fires</b> spread slowly along the ground, consuming smaller plants and dead plant material; some ground <b>fires</b> burned for longer duration and intensity, contributing to the loss of many trees whose canopies were never directly burned.|$|E
5|$|About thirty-five {{natural forest}} <b>fires</b> are ignited {{each year by}} lightning, while another six to ten are started by people— in most cases by accident. Yellowstone National Park has three fire lookout towers, each staffed by trained fire fighters. The easiest one to reach is atop Mount Washburn, which has interpretive {{exhibits}} and an observation deck open to the public. The park also monitors fire from the air and relies on visitor reports of smoke and/or flames. Fire towers are staffed almost continuously from late June to mid-September— the primary fire season. <b>Fires</b> burn with the greatest intensity {{in the late afternoon}} and evening. Few <b>fires</b> burn more than , {{and the vast majority of}} <b>fires</b> reach only a little over an acre (0.5ha) before they burn themselves out. Fire management focuses on monitoring dead and down wood quantities, soil and tree moisture, and the weather, to determine those areas most vulnerable to fire should one ignite. Current policy is to suppress all human caused <b>fires</b> and to evaluate natural <b>fires,</b> examining the benefit or detriment they may pose on the ecosystem. If a fire is considered to be an immediate threat to people and structures, or will burn out of control, then fire suppression is performed.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of {{research}} conducted after the <b>fires,</b> a new fire management plan for Yellowstone was implemented in 1992. The plan observed stricter guidelines for managing natural <b>fires,</b> increased the staffing levels of fire monitors and related occupations, and allocated greater funding for fire management. By 2004, further amendments to the wildland fire management plan were added. According to the 2004 plan, natural wildfires are allowed to burn, so long as parameters regarding fire size, weather, and potential danger are not exceeded. Those <b>fires</b> that do exceed the standards, {{as well as all}} human-caused <b>fires,</b> are to be suppressed. These changes are primarily updates of the 1972 fire management plan and continue to emphasize the role of fire in maintaining a natural ecosystem, but apply stricter guidelines and lower levels of tolerance.|$|E

5|$|Contrary {{to media}} reports and {{speculation}} at the time, the <b>fires</b> killed very few park animals— surveys indicated {{that only about}} 345 elk (of an estimated 40,000–50,000), 36 mule deer, 12 moose, 6 black bears, and 9 bison had perished. Of 21 grizzlies that were radio-collared and had home ranges where the <b>fires</b> happened, only one was {{believed to have been}} lost. Grizzlies were observed in burned areas more often than unburned areas the following year, feeding on the proliferation of roots and foliage as well as on ants which thrived due to all the dead wood. Moose had been declining in the northern sections of the park since the 1960s, but the decline became more obvious after the <b>fires.</b> Unlike elk, which are primarily grazers and tend to eat grasses, moose {{are more likely to be}} browsers, consuming primarily woody food sources, particularly willow and subalpine fir, which were temporarily reduced by the <b>fires.</b> All ungulates experienced a high initial mortality the winter after the <b>fires,</b> but this has been attributed to a severe winter more than the <b>fires</b> themselves. However, moose populations, unlike other ungulates, have not rebounded in subsequent years. Rodents likely experienced the highest mortality of all mammals due not only to heat and smoke they could not easily escape, but also because of the reduction in forest cover, allowing would-be predators less difficulty in spotting them.|$|E

5|$|Forest <b>fires</b> {{were viewed}} {{for many decades}} {{as a threat to}} {{protected}} areas such as forests and parks. As a better understanding of fire ecology developed after the 1960s, forest <b>fires</b> were understood to be a natural part of the ecosystem. The earlier policies of suppression resulted in the accumulation of dead and decaying trees and plants, which would normally have been reduced had <b>fires</b> been allowed to burn. Many species of plants and animals actually need wildfires to help replenish the soil with nutrients and to open up areas that allow grasses and smaller plants to thrive.|$|E
5|$|Foresters and ecologists {{argue that}} large {{controlled}} burns in Yellowstone {{prior to the}} <b>fires</b> would not have greatly reduced the area that was consumed in 1988. Controlled burns would quickly become uncontrolled if {{they were allowed to}} burn with the intensity that many tree and plant communities need for proper regeneration. Consequently, natural <b>fires,</b> rather than controlled burns, are the park's primary maintenance tool. Since the late 1970s, some 300 natural <b>fires</b> have been allowed to burn themselves out. In rare circumstances, natural <b>fires</b> are supplemented by controlled burns that are deliberately started to remove dead timber under conditions which allow fire fighters an opportunity to carefully control where and how much wood fuel is consumed.|$|E

5|$|Glacier National Park has a fire {{management}} plan which ensures that human-caused <b>fires</b> are generally suppressed.

5|$|In {{an effort}} to {{minimize}} the chances of out of control <b>fires</b> and threats to people and structures, park employees {{do more than just}} monitor the potential for fire. Controlled burns are prescribed <b>fires</b> which are deliberately started to remove dead timber under conditions which allow fire fighters an opportunity to carefully control where and how much wood is consumed. Natural <b>fires</b> are sometimes considered prescribed <b>fires</b> if they are left to burn. In Yellowstone, unlike some other parks, there have been very few <b>fires</b> deliberately started by employees as prescribed burns. However, over the last 30 years, over 300 natural <b>fires</b> have been allowed to burn naturally. In addition, fire fighters remove dead and down wood and other hazards from areas where they will be a potential fire threat to lives and property, reducing the chances of fire danger in these areas. Fire monitors also regulate fire through educational services to the public and have been known to temporarily ban campfires from campgrounds during periods of high fire danger. The common notion in early United States land management policies was that all forest <b>fires</b> were bad. Fire was seen as a purely destructive force and there was little understanding that it {{was an integral part of}} the ecosystem. Consequently, until the 1970s, when a better understanding of wildfire was developed, all <b>fires</b> were suppressed. This led to an increase in dead and dying forests, which would later provide the fuel load for <b>fires</b> that would be much harder, and in some cases, impossible to control. Fire Management Plans were implemented, detailing that natural <b>fires</b> should be allowed to burn if they posed no immediate threat to lives and property.|$|E
5|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the <b>fires,</b> erosion was a particular concern, especially as the rains were heavy the following year. Helicopters dropped millions of gallons of water on the <b>fires,</b> and water retrieval from a few small creeks actually dropped the water level temporarily. Stream flow was also affected by water-pumping operations. The more than a million gallons of diammonium phosphate-based fire-retardant material polluted some streams, but this too was transient and had no long term ill effects on water quality. Fire fighting foams used on wildfires differ from those used for other situations such as fuel <b>fires.</b> They are very low in toxicity and were believed to have completely dispersed by the spring of 1989.|$|E
