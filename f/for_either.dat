5|$|In {{his debut}} season in 2004, Hunt was {{approached}} {{to play at}} international level for New Zealand in the ANZAC Test match. Although {{he was born in}} New Zealand, he had played all of his rugby league in Queensland, Australia.

However, Hunt pledged his allegiance to Queensland, and therefore Australia, but was not selected <b>for</b> <b>either</b> country that season. Hunt became a possibility for the Australian squad for the 2004 Tri-Nations, but Bennett, who was the Australian coach, decided not to select him due to his inexperience. In 2006, media speculation suggested that Hunt intended to change his allegiance and play for the New Zealand team, but Hunt put the speculation to rest by confirming that he would play for Australia.|$|E
