30|$|Discussion The {{results of}} our study {{reported}} a relatively satisfactory compliance rate compared to the literature data. But {{in order to reduce}} prescription errors and to preserve the existing molecules, it is important to improve practice by developing a local guide or protocols, through working groups in consultation with the emergency’s team and the <b>infectiology</b> specialist team of our general hospital. However, a specialized advice did not increase prescription delays of antibiotics.|$|E
30|$|Discussion: The {{high rate}} of {{compliant}} prescriptions {{can be explained by}} the broad indications of carbapenems in the ICU, especially in patients with septic shock. The increase mortality of patients with a compliant prescription is probably due to the severity of the infections. In order to achieve 100 % compliance, we could suggested regularly updating the knowledge of carbapenems prescriptions, collaborating with bacteriology and <b>infectiology</b> teams, and establishing a computerized or paper prescription with feedback control.|$|E

40|$|Flaviviruses {{constitute}} a genus of viruses that contains important {{human and animal}} pathogens. Most flaviviruses are maintained in the nature in an infectious cycle that includes transmission between wild animals, which act as their natural host, and insects (mosquitoes and ticks) that act as their vector. These vectors can transmit the virus to other animals or to humans, causing zoonoses. A characteristic shared by {{a wide variety of}} flaviviruses is that they can infect cells from the host nervous system, thus inducing severe neurological diseases, which often include encephalitis. Global climate warming together with changes in land use are helping to change the distribution patterns of some flaviviruses, which are currently being detected in new zones, causing infectious outbreaks that affect both human and animals.

Over recent years, {{it has become}} increasingly evident that the complex network of soluble cytokines, growth factors, proteases, and components of the extracellular matrix collaboratively interact within the tumor microenvironment, sustaining and driving cancer cell proliferation, invasion, and early metastasis. More recently, the tumor microenvironment has also been appreciated to mediate therapeutic resistance in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, thus opening numerous avenues for novel therapeutic explorations. Inert and soluble components of the tumor stroma have been targeted in order to break down the extracellular matrix scaffold, relieve vessel compression, and increase drug delivery to hypovascular tumors. Moreover, targeting of antiapoptotic, immunosuppressive, and pro-proliferative effects of the tumor stroma provides novel vantage points of attack. This review focuses on current and future developments in pancreatic cancer medicine, with a particular emphasis on biophysical and biochemical approaches that target the tumor microenvironment.

In addition, the importance of known non-pharmacologic reasons for nonadherence is unclear. Methods: We performed a cross-sectional, noninterventional, multicenter study to identify current reasons for nonadherence. Patients were categorized by physicians into the following adherence groups: good, unstable, or poor adherence. Co-variables of interest included age, sex, time since HIV diagnosis, ART duration, current ART regimen, HIV transmission route, comorbidity, HIV- 1 RNA viral load (VL), and CD 4 cell count. Patients self-reported the number of missed doses and provided their specific reasons for nonadherent behavior. Statistical analyses were performed using Fisher’s extended exact test, Kruskal–Wallis test, and logistic regression models. Results: Our study assessed 215 participants with good (n= 162), unstable (n= 36), and poor adherence (n= 17). Compared to patients with good adherence, patients with unstable and poor adherence reported more often to have missed at least one dose {{during the last week}} (good 11 % vs unstable 47 % vs poor 63 %, p< 0. 001). Physicians’ adherence assessment was concordant with patients’ self-reports of missed doses during the last week (no vs one or more) in 81 % cases. Similarly, we found a strong association of physicians’ assessment with viral suppression. Logistic regression analysis showed that “reduced adherence” – defined as unstable or poor – was significantly associated with patients < 30  years old, intravenous drug use, history of acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS), and psychiatric disorders (p< 0. 05). Univariate analyses showed that specific reasons, such as questioning the efficacy/dosing of ART, HIV stigma, interactive toxicity beliefs regarding alcohol and/or party drugs, and dissatisfaction with regimen complexity, correlated with unstable or poor adherence (p< 0. 05). Conclusion: Identification of factors associated with poor adherence helps in identifying patients with a higher risk for nonadherence. Reasons for nonadherence should be directly addressed in every patient, because they are common and constitute possible adherence intervention points.

40|$|Eike Binz, Ulrich M Lauer Department of Internal Medicine, Division of Hepatology, Gastroenterology, <b>Infectiology,</b> Medical University Hospital, Tuebingen, Germany Abstract: Oncolytic virotherapy {{has made}} {{significant}} progress in recent years, however, widespread approval of virotherapeutics is still limited. Primarily, {{this is due to}} the fact that currently available virotherapeutics are mostly tested in monotherapeutic clinical trials exclusively (ie, not in combination with other therapies) and so far have achieved only small and often clinically insignificant responses. Given that the predominantly immunotherapeutic mechanism of virotherapeutics is somewhat time-dependent and rapidly growing tumors therefore exhibit only minor chances of being captured in time, scenarios with combination partners are postulated to be more effective. Combinatory settings would help to achieve a rapid stabilization or even reduction of onset tumor masses while providing enough time (numerous months) for achieving immuno(viro) therapeutic success. For this reason, combination strategies of virotherapy with highly genotoxic regimens, such as chemotherapy, are of major interest. A number of clinical trials bringing the concepts of chemotherapy and virotherapy together have previously been undertaken, but optimal scheduling of chemovirotherapy (maximizing the anti-tumor effect while minimizing the risk of overlapping toxicity) still constitutes a major challenge. Therefore, an overview of published as well as ongoing Phase I–III trials should improve our understanding of current challenges and future developments in this field.

40|$|Using eye {{samples of}} nine 9 -week-old {{experimentally}} West Nile virus (WNV) –infected red-legged partridges (Alectoris rufa), time course of lesions and WNV antigen appearance in ocular structures were examined. In addition, eye samples of 6 red-legged partridges and 3 common pheasants (Phasianus colchicus) naturally infected with Bagaza virus (BAGV) {{were used to}} study lesions and flavivirus antigen distribution in relation to apparent blindness in the former. The rapid onset of microscopic lesions and early presence of viral antigen {{in the eye of}} experimentally WNV-infected partridges, prior to the central nervous system involvement, suggested hematogenous spread of the virus into the eye. BAGV-infected partridges had a more pronunced inflammatory reaction and more widespread flavivirus antigen distribution in the retina compared with pheasants and experimentally fatally WNV-infected partridges. Our results suggest that flavivirus replication and development of lesions in ocular structures of gallinaceous game birds vary with the specific virus and host species involved.

40|$|West Nile virus (WNV) is a neurovirulent single {{stranded}} RNA mosquito-borne flavivirus, {{whose main}} natural hosts are birds, {{but it also}} infects humans and horses. Nowadays, no human vaccine is commercially available and clinical treatment is only supportive. Recently, {{it has been shown}} that RNA transcripts, mimicking structural domains in the non-coding regions (NCRs) of the foot-and mouth disease virus (FMDV) induce a potent IFN response and antiviral activity in transfected cultured cells, and also reduced mice susceptibility to FMDV. By using different transcripts combinations, administration schedules, and infecting routes and doses, we have demonstrated that these FMDV RNA transcripts protect suckling and adult mice against lethal challenge with WNV. The protective activity induced by the transcripts was systemic and dependent on the infection route and dose. These results confirm the antiviral potential of these synthetic RNAs for fighting viruses of different families relevant for human and animal health. Â© 2012 Rodríguez-Pulido et al.

Contact animals were also {{used to assess the}} viral transmission among birds. Severe neurological signs and mortality rates of 67 % (H 7 N 1 /HP) and 92 % (H 5 N 1 /HP) were observed. Although histopathological findings were present in both HPAIV-infected groups, H 5 N 1 /HP-quail displayed a broader viral antigen distribution and extent of microscopic lesions. Neither clinical nor pathological involvement was observed in LPAIV-infected quail. Consistent long-term viral shedding and effective transmission to naive quail was demonstrated for the three studied AIV. Drinking water arose as a possible transmission route and feathers as a potential origin of HPAIV dissemination.

40|$|Sepsis {{remains a}} {{persistent}} problem on intensive care units {{all over the}} world. Understanding the complex mechanisms of sepsis is the precondition for establishing new therapeutic approaches in this field. Therefore, animal models are required {{that are able to}} closely mimic the human disease and also sufficiently deal with scientific questions. The Colon Ascendens Stent Peritonitis (CASP) is a highly standardized model for polymicrobial abdominal sepsis in rodents. In this model, a small stent is surgically inserted into the ascending colon of mice or rats leading to a continuous leakage of intestinal bacteria into the peritoneal cavity. The procedure results in peritonitis, systemic bacteraemia, organ infection by gut bacteria, and systemic but also local release of several pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines. The lethality of CASP can be controlled by the diameter of the inserted stent. A variant of this model, the so-called CASP with intervention (CASPI), raises opportunity to remove the septic focus by a second operation according to common procedures in clinical practice. CASP is an easily learnable and highly reproducible model that closely mimics the clinical course of abdominal sepsis.

Two groups of 12 PIT-tagged Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) were i. p infected with Infectious Salmon Anaemia Virus (ISAV) or culture medium and placed in 1 m 3 tanks. Blood samples were collected at 0, 4, 8, 12, 16, 21 and 25 days post infection. The viral load, immune and stress response were determined in individual fish by real-time quantitative PCR (QPCR) on the blood cells, as well as the haematocrit used as an indicator of haemolysis, a clinical consequence of ISAV infection. "In-tank" anaesthesia was used {{in order to reduce the}} stress related to chase and netting prior to sampling. The data were analysed using a statistical approach which is novel with respect to its use in fish immunology. The repeated blood collection procedure did not induce stress response as measured by HSP 70 and HSP 90 gene expression in the un-infected animals. A strong increase in viraemia as well as a significant induction of Mx and gammaIP gene expression were observed in the infected group. Interleukin 10 was found induced at the later stage of the infection whereas no induction of CD 8 or gamma IFN could be detected. These results and the advantages of this approach are discussed.
