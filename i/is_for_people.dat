25|$|In Spain {{and in most}} Spanish-{{speaking}} countries, {{the custom}} <b>is</b> <b>for</b> <b>people</b> to have two surnames. Usually the first surname comes from {{the father and the}} second from the mother, but it could be the other way round. When speaking or in informal situations only the first one is used, although both are needed for legal purpose.

For example, if José García Torres and María Acosta Gómez had a child named Pablo, then his full name would be Pablo García Acosta. One family member's relationship to another can often be identified by the various combinations and permutations of surnames.|$|E
