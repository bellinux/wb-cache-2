"The {{notion of}} the cistron ... must be {{replaced}} by that of a transcription unit containing regions which will be lost from the mature messenger - which <b>I</b> <b>suggest</b> <b>we</b> call introns (for intragenic regions) - alternating with regions which will be expressed - exons."

40|$|Here, <b>I</b> <b>suggest</b> <b>we</b> must invest our {{scientific}} {{resources in}} brain research.

5000|$|For {{this year}} <b>I</b> <b>suggest</b> <b>we</b> give the {{questions}} of drill, skills, art, music, the teaching of languages, mathematics and other symbols, physical, aesthetic, moral and religious training and development, a rest, and that we concentrate on the inquiry: What are we telling young people directly about {{the world in which}} they are to live? ...|$|R
50|$|During the Russian revolution, {{political}} dictatorship was used, {{everything else}} can be discarded, the only aim was {{the success of}} the revolution... its success was due to the party (Communist Party of the Soviet Union) being on top of the state. <b>I</b> <b>suggest...</b> <b>we</b> should reorganise, by putting the party (Kuomintang) on top of the state (ROC).|$|R
5000|$|The term exon {{derives from}} the {{expressed}} region and was coined by American biochemist Walter Gilbert in 1978: [...] "The notion of the cistron… must be replaced by that of a transcription unit containing regions which will be lost from the mature messengerwhich <b>I</b> <b>suggest</b> <b>we</b> call introns (for intragenic regions)alternating with regions which will be expressedexons." ...|$|R
5000|$|Eric Fry recalled: “The {{airport is}} {{actually}} {{located on the}} plateau at {{the west end of}} Terrington Basin but it is only five miles inland from the narrows between Goose Bay and Terrington Basin. Having a Gander air base in Newfoundland <b>I</b> <b>suggested</b> <b>we</b> call the Labrador site Goose Bay airport and the suggestion was accepted.” ...|$|R
40|$|<b>I</b> <b>suggest</b> <b>we</b> treat causality, not matter, as the {{fundamental}} constituent of reality. I introduce {{a unit of}} causality named toma and outline how the resulting framework leads naturally to general relativity, quantum electrodynamics and quantum chromodynamics. This novel framework {{is the first to}} show how to derive GR, QED and QCD from first principles and as such holds promise for being a Grand Unified Theory...|$|R
40|$|Interpretation {{in science}} has gained little {{attention}} in the past because philosophers of science believed that interpretation belongs to the context of discovery or must be associated with meaning. But scientists often speak about interpretation when they report their findings. Elsewhere I have argue in favour of a pragmatic-rhetorical theory of explanation, {{and it is in}} light of this theory that <b>I</b> <b>suggest</b> <b>we</b> can understand interpretation in the natural sciences...|$|R
5000|$|In July 2015, Christensen {{suggested}} on {{his website}} that Australia should consider corporal punishment for drug traffickers, writing that [...] "It's {{time to do}} things differently, and <b>I</b> <b>suggest</b> <b>we</b> {{take a look at}} how they address the problem in Singapore. Their use of corporal punishment seems to be a highly effective deterrent." [...] In November 2015, Christensen again called for the bringing back of the death penalty.|$|R

40|$|Thisarticle {{critically}} {{examines the}} normative, liberal assumptions that most frequently underlie scholarly, activist, and policy calls for reconciliation in Bosnia and Herzegovina. Rather than measuring how reconciliation is progressing, <b>I</b> <b>suggest</b> <b>we</b> ask ourselves whose reconciliation is being desired here: by whom, for whom, and for what? Which importantalternative questions remain unasked and which latent answers are ignored ordownplayed in the process? Particular {{attention is paid}} {{to the ways in which}} liberal reconciliation discourse tends to depoliticize questions of justice...|$|R
40|$|This article draws {{connections}} between Systems Intelligence and New Value Creation {{suggesting that the}} two {{have a lot in}} common. By using variety of examples I will show how these perspectives can benefit from each other. Much of human interactions are strongly affected by commercial systems, which gives rise to new value creation in the sense discussed in this article. In order to create more enriching and meaningful lives, <b>I</b> <b>suggest</b> <b>we</b> need both systems intelligence and new value creation brilliance...|$|R
5000|$|About {{the album}} title, bassist Markus Grosskopf {{explained}} in 2003 that [...] "It's {{based on that}} English saying, pulling a rabbit out of the hat. Pulling this rabbit album out of this hat reference to recent line up changes wasn't that easy this time. That gave us the idea of just calling the album Rabbit Don't Come Easy. Laughs It's {{not to be taken}} too seriously. We were joking that statement around, and then <b>I</b> <b>suggested</b> <b>we</b> actually call the album that".|$|R
5000|$|The {{album is}} Eno's sixth for Warp, and was {{recorded}} following {{the announcement of}} his first collaboration with Karl Hyde. Eno was quoted saying, [...] "when Someday World was finished I {{felt like we were}} still on a roll and I wasn't ready to stop working and get into 'promotional mode' for that record. So <b>I</b> <b>suggested</b> <b>we</b> immediately start on another album, a different one, where we extended some of the ideas we'd started, and attempted some of the ideas we hadn't." ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: We have {{experienced}} the reality of globalization, both in its positive and negative attributes. A global future is unavoidable. From examples drawn from the trade in services, <b>I</b> <b>suggest</b> that <b>we</b> need a global ethic {{to deal with the}} ethical problems faced by modern business. Further, <b>I</b> <b>suggest</b> that <b>we</b> work towards developing such a global ethic by drawing on the experiences of East and West to find the best practice. Underpinning such a global ethic must be spiritualities which have one common factor: a global vision which is wide enough to include all people and their issues and their hopes. This requires leadership in business beyond simply local issues...|$|R
500|$|In The Scotsman, Graham Leicester {{writes that}} the [...] "overblown rhetoric invites a sceptical reaction. But <b>I</b> <b>suggest</b> <b>we</b> just accept this {{extraordinary}} compliment graciously." [...] It was likely influenced by Thomas Cahill's How the Irish Saved Civilization {{and the result of}} a marketing strategy. Several reviewers found that Herman was successful in proving that Scots did have a disproportionate impact on modernity. Herman continued this type of theme with his next book, To Rule the Waves: How the British Navy Shaped the Modern World, published in 2004.|$|R
40|$|Instead of {{interpreting}} Berkeley {{in terms of}} the standard way of relating him to Descartes, Malebranche, and Locke, <b>I</b> <b>suggest</b> <b>we</b> consider relating him to other figures (e. g., Stoics, Ramists, Suarez, Spinoza, Leibniz). This allows us to integrate his published and unpublished work, and reveals how his philosophic and non-philosophic work are much more aligned with one another. I indicate how his (1) theory of powers, (2) "bundle theory" of the mind, and (3) doctrine of "innate ideas" are understood in a way significantly different from that found in the standard account...|$|R
40|$|This paper explores a {{connection}} between underdetermination and the identity conditions for theories: Must we provide the latter before enquiring into the former? Quine proposes that we call two theories identical if they are equivalent under a reconstrual of predicates, but this may mishandle important cases. Another proposal is to defer to the particular judgements of actual scientists. Consideration of an historical episode [...] - the alleged equivalence of wave and matrix mechanics [...] - shows that this second proposal also fails. Nevertheless, <b>I</b> <b>suggest,</b> <b>we</b> may enquire into underdetermination without a better candidate...|$|R

5000|$|Bashur also {{recalled}} {{that he said}} to Clements during the debate prep: [...] "Why don't we get under White's skin? Let's get him off stride. When you {{get any kind of}} question about the budget, segue into that we've got to live within our means and cut waste." [...] <b>I</b> <b>suggested</b> that Clements say, [...] "To cut waste, I'll sell the jet." [...] <b>I</b> <b>suggested</b> <b>we</b> itemize what is in the jet. You could say, [...] "And I'll sell that $500 gold-platted ashtray, and I'll sell that $35,000 carpet, and I'll sell"-fifteen items. I wrote them all out.

At the same time, Gudinski came back from the U.K. He had signed the {{publishing}} of 90 percent of the punk explosion and we decided to start a touring company.

5000|$|Roth's {{work began}} {{appearing}} in Marvel Comics, {{then known as}} Atlas Comics, in 1953. Atlas editor Stan Lee has described being impressed with Roth's portfolio, particularly his drawings of women, [...] "So I took his samples to show then-publisher Martin Goodman. <b>I</b> <b>suggested</b> <b>we</b> should use Werner, even create a comic for him. Which we did, {{and that was how}} Lorna, the Jungle Girl was born." [...] Roth drew the first dozen issues of Lorna. He drew a number of other features for Atlas, including most of the stories of the Apache Kid. He later drew romance stories for DC Comics.|$|R

60|$|Finally, <b>I</b> <b>suggested</b> that <b>we</b> {{experiment}} {{with it and}} see what it would do, so Perry built a fire, after placing the powder at a safe distance, and then touched a glow-ing ember to a minute particle of the deadly explosive. It extinguished the ember.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: My {{starting}} point for this article is the increasing pace of academic life. As the other articles in this special section evidence, the Slow movement, which seeks to challenge our contemporary obsession with speed, is being taken up by many in order to intervene into "fast academia". However, in this article, <b>I</b> <b>suggest</b> <b>we</b> should pause and question {{what kind of a}} solution this offers to the current crisis of speed. Working auto/biographically and using examples drawn from popular culture, I argue that Slow is both classed and gendered, re/producing wider patterns of inclusion and exclusion. Specifically, <b>I</b> <b>suggest</b> that Slow naturalises a particular relationship to self which requires not just stability of employment but an individualist way of being, constituting selve...|$|R
