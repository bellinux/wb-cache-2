5|$|Adolf Hitler, {{after an}} {{unsuccessful}} attempt {{to overthrow the}} German government in 1923, eventually became the Chancellor of Germany in 1933. He abolished democracy, espousing a radical, racially motivated revision of the world order, and soon began a massive rearmament campaign. Meanwhile, France, to secure its alliance, allowed Italy a free hand <b>in</b> <b>Ethiopia,</b> which Italy desired as a colonial possession. The situation was aggravated in early 1935 when the Territory of the Saar Basin was legally reunited with Germany and Hitler repudiated the Treaty of Versailles, accelerated his rearmament programme, and introduced conscription.|$|E
5|$|At first, Prester John was {{imagined}} {{to reside}} in India; tales of the Nestorian Christians' evangelistic success there and of Thomas the Apostle's subcontinental travels as documented in works like the Acts of Thomas probably provided the first seeds of the legend. After {{the coming of the}} Mongols to the Western world, accounts placed the king in Central Asia, and eventually Portuguese explorers convinced themselves that they had found him <b>in</b> <b>Ethiopia.</b>|$|E
5|$|Ethiopia: <b>In</b> <b>Ethiopia,</b> {{where the}} size of the {{elephant}} population has decreased by 90% since the 1980s, officials issued a National Ivory Action Plan to address poaching and ivory trafficking.

5|$|<b>In</b> <b>Ethiopia,</b> {{there are}} several {{varieties}} of sheep landrace. Attempts {{have been made to}} classify the sheep based on factors such as tail shape and wool type, and H. Epstein made an attempt at classifying them this way by dividing the breeds into 14 types based on those two factors. However, in 2002, further genetic analysis revealed that there are only four distinct varieties of Ethiopian sheep: short-fat-tailed, long-fat-tailed, fat-rumped, and thin-tailed.|$|E

Instead, she had paid people smugglers to take her to Libya, where she was imprisoned for a period.|$|E

A total of 6,454 Italian troops were taken prisoner, including Gazzera, eight other generals and 3,500 askari, along with the seizure of 20 artillery pieces, 200 machine guns, 250 trucks and 500 mules. With Gazzera's surrender, Gondar became the only area <b>in</b> <b>Ethiopia</b> that remained under Italian control. The market in Saïo was reopened three days after hostilities had ceased and Belgian engineers repaired the Saïo-Gambela road.|$|E

In 1945, the Ethiopian government began negotiations with both Transcontinental Air Transport and Western Air Express (later merged into TWA). On 8 September 1945, TWA signed an agreement with the American historian and foreign affairs advisor to Ethiopia John H. Spencer to establish a commercial aviation company <b>in</b> <b>Ethiopia.</b>|$|E
