500|$|The Witness {{remained}} in development, missing the planned 2013 release while Blow {{and his team}} continued to improve and fine-tune the game. In September 2015, Blow announced that the game's release was set for January 26, 2016, simultaneously for PlayStation 4 and Microsoft Windows, with the iOS version to follow shortly thereafter. Though the ESRB rated the title for the Xbox One {{just prior to the}} game's release, Blow clarified that they presently <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>plans</b> for release on that platform, only acquiring the ESRB rating for that console platform {{at the same time as}} the other confirmed versions to avoid having to redo this step prior to release in the future. About a week before its release, Blow announced that the game would be priced at , an amount he said [...] "fairly reflective of what the game is". The value was met with some criticism as a high price for an indie game. Game journalists believe the price is justified given the estimated 100-hour playtime Blow has stated, as well as comparing it to a similar puzzle game, The Talos Principle (2014), that was also released for the same price. To help promote the game, the development team created three [...] "long screenshot" [...] videos, inspired by the experimental film Koyaanisqatsi, that slowly panned across the island and its features without additional commentary.|$|E
500|$|The ending {{sequence}} with Pam and Jim in {{the hospital}} was filmed at the North Hollywood Medical Center using the Sacred Heart Hospital set from Scrubs. Although the good news Jim and Pam learn {{in the hospital}} was never specifically stated, episode writer Jen Celotta confirmed that the news was that Pam was pregnant; the script included an off-hand question from a nurse to Pam about whether she was pregnant so that viewers would make the connection later. Celotta said {{the idea of the}} pregnancy came as the writers were working on this specific episode, although she felt the show had always been heading in that direction. The series producers considered filming the scene with audible dialogue, but they thought the scene was more powerful without audio and felt actors John Krasinski and Jenna Fischer [...] "are such great actors and have the ability to convey so much without hearing their dialogue." [...] Celotta said the show's producers <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>plans</b> to release the scene with audio. While filming Jim Halpert's emotional reaction to the pregnancy news, Krasinski and director Ken Kwapis discussed the fact that Jim has been surrounded by this camera crew for the last five years, so he would be glad to share this moment with them. The moment when Jim looked directly at the camera, in particular, was meant to convey the idea that he was celebrating the news with the crew. The script did not call for tears, but Krasinski cried naturally as part of his performance.|$|E
500|$|Before {{the renewal}} of the fifth season, Abrams stated some {{skepticism}} for a renewal opportunity, but hoped {{that if it was}} cancelled, that it may be picked up by another network. On the other hand, Abrams considered that if Fox did pick up the show for a fifth season, [...] "the next year would be the great ending for the show". Similarly, Fox's Reilly remained cautious about a renewal, noting that while the show {{is one of the top}} shows in the Friday night slot, [...] "it's an expensive show. We lose a lot of money on the show." [...] Reilly further reiterated the dedication of the fans of the show for helping it to its fourth season and continued success. When asked about whether the writers would have enough notice to write the fourth-season finale as a series finale if necessary, Reilly stated, [...] "That's a Peter Roth issue" [...] (chief executive of Warner Bros. Television). To which Roth responded, [...] "We <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>plans</b> to give viewers closure this season because we expect the series to continue". In late January 2012, Fox and Warner Bros. Television were working on negotiating a lower licensing cost for the show to allow a fifth season to occur; this would not only help Fox reduce its losses on the show, but would also bring the total number of episodes above 100, giving Warner Bros. a better opportunity to syndicate reruns of the show. Before the announcement of the fifth season, Wyman and Pinkner stated that they would have created a series finale for the end of the fourth season should the show be cancelled; Wyman stated [...] "We want to take care of the fans. We want them to see where it would have gone, but we also know the show has been a commitment and we want everyone to be satisfied with it." ...|$|E
