50|$|<b>Electro{{chemiluminescence}}</b> or electrogenerated chemiluminescence (ECL) {{is a kind}} of luminescence {{produced during}} electrochemical reactions in solutions. In electrogenerated chemiluminescence, electrochemically generated intermediates undergo a highly exergonic reaction to produce an electronically excited state that then emits light upon relaxation to a lower-level state. This wavelength of the emitted photon of light corresponds to the energy gap between these two states. ECL excitation can be caused by energetic electron transfer (redox) reactions of electrogenerated species. Such luminescence excitation is a form of chemiluminescence where one/all reactants are produced electrochemically on the electrodes.|$|E
5000|$|Modifications to this {{foundation}} {{can also}} be fabricated into the basic design structure. One {{example of this is}} the addition of <b>electrochemiluminescence</b> detectors within the indium tin oxide layer (the ground electrode in a closed system) which aid in the detection of luminophores in droplets. In general, different materials may also be used to replace basic components of a DMF system {{such as the use of}} PDMS instead of glass for the substrate. Liquid materials can  be added, such as oil or another substance, to a closed system to prevent evaporation of materials and decrease surface contamination. Also, DMF systems can be compatible with ionic liquid droplets with the use of an oil in a closed device or with the use of a catena (a suspended wire) over an open DMF device.|$|E
50|$|A {{challenge}} in optical detection {{is the need}} for integrating detectors and photodiodes in a miniaturized portable format on the bio-MEMS. Optical detection includes fluorescence-based techniques, chemiluminescence-based techniques, and surface plasmon resonance (SPR). Fluorescence-based optical techniques use markers that emit light at specific wavelengths and the presence or enhancement/reduction (e.g. fluorescence resonance energy transfer) in optical signal indicates a reaction has occurred. Fluorescence-based detection has been used in microarrays and PCR on a chip devices. Chemiluminescence is light generation by energy release from a chemical reaction. Bioluminescence and <b>electrochemiluminescence</b> are subtypes of chemiluminescence. Surface plasmon resonance sensors can be thin-film refractometers or gratings that measure the resonance behaviour of surface plasmon on metal or dielectric surfaces. The resonance changes when biomolecules are captured or adsorbed on the sensor surface and depends on the concentration of the analyte as well as its properties. Surface plasmon resonance has been used in food quality and safety analysis, medical diagnostics, and environmental monitoring.|$|E

40|$|Systematic {{evolution}} of ligands by expo-nential enrichment (SELEX) {{was used to}} de-velop DNA ligands (aptamers) to cholera whole toxin and staphylococcal enterotoxin B (SEB). Affinity selection of aptamers was accomplished by conjugating the biotoxins to tosyl-activated magnetic beads. The use of magnetic beads reduces the volumes needed to perform aptamer selection, thus obviating alcohol precipitation and allowing direct PCR amplification from the bead surface. Following five rounds of SELEX, 5 ′-biotiny-lated aptamers were bound to streptavidin-coated magnetic beads and used {{for the detection of}} ruthenium trisbypyridine [Ru(bpy) 32 +]-labeled cholera toxin and SEB by an <b>electrochemiluminescence</b> methodolo-gy. A comparison of control (double-strand-ed) aptamer binding was made with ap-tamers that were heat denatured at 96 °C (single-stranded) and allowed to cool (con-form) in the presence of biotoxin-conjugated magnetic beads.
