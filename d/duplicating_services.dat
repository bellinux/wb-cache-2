This led to {{discussion on the}} establishment of a coast guard. The Military Fisheries Surveillance represented one of very few exceptions in which military force could be used against Norwegian civilians. Several organizational models were discarded, including a civilian agency, a continuation of an integrated model and a virtual coast guard made up of units from various branches. Instead the coast guard was organized as a separate unit under the navy. An important argument was to avoid <b>duplicating</b> <b>services,</b> such as an operative headquarters and naval bases.

50|$|The {{discovery}} of major gold deposits in 1923 {{led to a}} gold rush in the Abitibi region, attracting settlers (exclusively men {{during the first six}} years) to the area in 1928. In 1935, the Canadian Malartic Gold Mines began operation, employing {{people from all over the}} province, Canada, and several east European countries. Together with Eastern Malartic and Malartic Goldfields that began operating in 1937 and 1939 respectively, these three became Quebec's largest gold mines. But newly arriving workers were not permitted to settle near the mines and would build a squatter camp on Crown land about 4 km north of Malartic, that became the community of Roc d'Or. The two settlements grew concurrently, <b>duplicating</b> <b>services.</b> But the parishes (Saint-Martin-de-Tours in 1928), railway station, and post office (1936) were established near the mines in Malartic.|$|E

They decided to merge the two governments and formed a joint council since they were working with similar visions. The merged organization held joint council meetings and planning sessions. They had one executive director, one accountant, and a city clerk. All administrative positions were moved into one building and they streamlined costs by not <b>duplicating</b> <b>services.</b> At that time, there was limited funding available to municipal governments and there were more opportunities for monies through BIA funds and tribal government. In 2009, the goals began to change and {{it was decided to}} separate the two governments, with the goal of making the city and traditional governments financially solvent again.|$|E

30|$|In addition, {{service time}} is delayed {{to keep the}} {{previous}} power status of electronic devices because the native ISM-based system should control device’s status after checking whether the device is the same one. The energy management model should {{solve the problem of}} the <b>duplicated</b> <b>service</b> to reduce the delay time and to prevent unnecessary on/off wasting. To remove <b>duplicated</b> <b>service,</b> the energy management model using ISM is applied by the HHMM. The duplication is removed by knowing house construction and location of existing electronic devices. To minimize the wasting of energy, we propose the energy management model using user activity patterns and HHMM. First, we describe a 3 -level HHMM energy management model. Next, we present an adapted ISM-based energy management model using HHMM. Lastly, the proposed simulator using ISM-based energy management model is presented.|$|R

40|$|Interorganizational {{coordination}} {{is crucial}} among human services providers responsible {{for responding to}} both personal and widespread crises. Too often, however, agencies providing disaster relief, shelter, and connection to other social service systems operate in information silos. Moreover, organizations that assist the same people may be <b>duplicating</b> <b>services</b> or ineffectively providing services to those in need. In the past, {{there has been no}} easy way for human service organizations to share information about clients, resources, and services. Over the last decade, distinct initiatives have begun to standardize data collection, storage, and transmission standards within human service domains. This paper describes several human services standards currently in use or under development in the United States and discusses how each support distinct, yet related, human service information management during disasters. The paper concludes with a call for the development of an overarching human services data interoperability standard...|$|E
