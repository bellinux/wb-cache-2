I literally sat on the steps of my studio and cried. This is a guy who's a friend of mine, who we all love and admire. We didn't want to see it come crashing down." ...|$|E
500|$|During {{the season}} Charlotte's storylines had mixed reactions. Jensen thought Charlotte and Faraday's {{mission to the}} Tempest in [...] "The Other Woman" [...] felt [...] "forced". Dan Compora from Airlock Alpha liked Charlotte and Juliet's fight scene in this episode. BuddyTV's Oscar Dahl thought the whole plot at the Tempest was [...] "filler" [...] and {{wondered}} {{if it had been}} added <b>just</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> Charlotte and Faraday something to do. After Charlotte speaks Korean in [...] "Something Nice Back Home", James Poniewozik from Time became curious about her past because she is [...] "the member of the four freighties whom we know the least about, and the most secretive and sinister-seeming of the bunch". Chris Carabott was also intrigued after this scene, which he called [...] "one of the more unexpected scenes".|$|E
500|$|In December 2009, Gaga {{revealed}} that {{she planned to}} cancel {{the concept of the}} original shows of The Monster Ball Tour and start afresh. She felt that the revamp of the show was needed as the original tour was constructed in a very short span of time. Gaga recalled that after West and she split up for this tour, she was unsure if she could get a show together in time, but nevertheless wanted to promote The Fame Monster. Hence she was able to put together [...] "something that, in truth, I never would have done if I had a longer amount of time". The revamp of the tour was planned from the arena shows in the United Kingdom from February 2010. [...] "My team thinks I'm completely psychotic. But I don't fucking care what they think. [...] Well, <b>just</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> you an idea, the stage is about four {{times the size of the}} one we're on now and conceptually, it's completely different. One thing that has been lost over the past 10-15 years, in pop music, is the idea of showbiz. And this is definitely going to bring that back", clarified Gaga. According to James Montgomery of MTV, the show recalled the film musicals The Wizard of Oz (1939) and West Side Story (1961), the science-fiction film Metropolis (1927), and the television mini-series Angels in America (2003).|$|E

500|$|The {{song was}} {{originally}} {{set to be}} on Drake's debut album, Thank Me Later, but after Drake forwent the song, he insisted that Songz include it on Ready. Songz stated in an interview what fan reception to the track mostly had been that he should put a verse in on [...] "Successful", but Songz told BallerStatus, [...] "I was like, 'That's my homie's song.' Then initially, Drake {{came up to me}} with the idea like 'Nah dog. That's your song. I'm not putting it on my album. So it's going to be a waste. So it's {{going to be a big}} record with no one to go retrieve it.' So we put the verse on there <b>just</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> me a little more presence on the record for it to be on my album." [...] In an interview with MTV News, Drake explained how the song came about, stating, [...] "It has this pocket, and there was no melody yet. I remember [...] kind of making the joint, and then he hit this sound, which is the chords that are in there. It was so eerie. Like it was haunting, almost. I was like, 'Yo, that's it. You need to use that.' He started playing this patch, and just every note that he played fell into place. I had this beat sitting here that I love so much, and I didn't know what to do with it..." ...|$|E
500|$|Cuse and Lindelof {{admitted}} they took some {{inspiration from the}} final episode of , [...] "", where Captain Picard jumps between three time frames. The Lost writers compared Minkowski's role to Q, as [...] "someone who is undergoing and understands the same events as our protagonist". Faraday, on the other hand, was the expert that always appears in time travel fiction—as Lindelof put it, [...] "He's our Doc Brown here, who basically is gonna tell the protagonist to go and find him in the past". Whereas the average Lost episode took two weeks to plan and write, [...] "The Constant" [...] took five because the writers experienced difficulty when determining its effect on future stories. Popular Mechanics analyzed the possibility of time travel using Losts rules. [...] Michio Kaku claimed that [...] "the show's producers did their homework". [...] According to Kaku, [...] "there's no law of physics preventing this kind of time travel—just a lack of know-how… {{it would take a}} very advanced civilization to really do this". [...] Cuse stated that [...] "we [...] try to use enough science to give a sense of credibility". [...] "The Constant" [...] was the first episode set on the Kahana, but the writers decided to avoid using the new setting <b>just</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> new information—Lindelof has declared that [...] "you would have mindless exposition unless the characters were {{in a constant state of}} crisis". According to Lindelof, Desmond's confusion prevents the characters who arrived from the island from asking questions to the freighter's crew.|$|E
500|$|When {{the film}} was released, the {{distributor}} did not promote it heavily, and most reviewers disliked it. Because {{the film was}} X-rated, The New York Times refused to run the film's advertisement. [...] This was a somewhat awkward situation, as the ad included a positive review from The New York Times. According to Swenson, [...] "it didn't have a big following, ... {{but it is still}} in video stores." [...] The film played for about two weeks in New York City. Jerry Beck wrote a review in which he called the film [...] "raunchier than Ralph Bakshi's films." [...] He {{went on to say that}} the humor of the film [...] "is good, but the design and drawing is downright awful. It seems to be sort of a cross between Jules Feiffer and Gahan Wilson, if that can be imagined." [...] Beck also stated that the film was [...] "very similar to R. Crumb's Mr. Natural and Flakey Foont. There is no reason that the duck should be a duck. Every character in the film is human, and he just seems to be a duck <b>just</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> the film a catchy title. There are some highly imaginative animated ideas here, but the film's entertainment value is at a minimum." [...] Beck later called the film [...] "one of the most overlooked animated features of the 1970s, a glorious experimental mess of a film, which, from today’s vantage point, looks incredibly creative and daring, and something current Hollywood studios would never attempt." ...|$|E

500|$|... "Life's a Glitch, Then You Die" [...] {{was written}} and {{conceived}} by Hauge. In DVD commentary for the episode, Hauge stated that, when writing the segment, {{he knew it}} would not age well. [...] "I was aware of it at the time, that it wouldn't last forever" [...] he said, [...] "But I wanted to capture that moment." [...] According to director Michels, the rocket which transported the [...] "best and brightest" [...] of the population was drawn to resemble a popsicle. The Simpsons staff had a lot of trouble finding a guest star for the second rocket, and the only person who agreed to participate was American actor Tom Arnold. In the episode, Arnold is depicted as an annoying, [...] "not-so-great" [...] celebrity. Although he was mostly in on the joke, Arnold did [...] "bust [...] chops" [...] a little bit when recording his lines. [...] "He would say a line and then they'd yell cut and he'd look over at me and take a shot at me" [...] Hauge said. Still, Hauge found Arnold's performance [...] "fantastic" [...] and Scully said that he was a [...] "good sport". The segment also features television personality Dick Clark as himself. A few months after the episode aired, Hauge discussed the segment with Clark in a Fox studio. According to Hauge, Clark said that the episode gave the [...] "biggest response" [...] he had ever gotten from anything he had ever done. [...] "After the career that he had in television for so long, <b>just</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> him a highlight was a highlight for me" [...] Hauge said in the episode's DVD commentary.|$|E
500|$|On April 26, 2016, Deadline {{reported}} that Aml Ameen abruptly left production {{a couple of}} episodes into filming of the second season over a conflict with Lana Wachowski that started during the table read for the season and progressively got worse. Both the Deadline article and Ameen's co-star on Sense8, Tuppence Middleton, suggested the conflict was over [...] When asked about it, Straczynski commented he was not there {{to know what happened}} between Ameen and Lana but he respects the choices of both. Subsequent to Ameen's departure, the role of Capheus was recast to Toby Onwumere after a seven-day auditioning process. Onwumere watched a few episodes of the show to prepare for his audition, as he had not seen it before. The actor said about his approach to the character: [...] "My duty [...] not to emulate exactly what [...] has done, ... but <b>just</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> it my own spin, and kind of do my own thing, and just give this character the same essence, but ... maybe a different life and a different take on it." [...] Earlier in April, Kick Gurry, who had played parts in the Wachowskis' Speed Racer and Jupiter Ascending in the past, revealed he had been cast in the second season, after Lana called to inform him that they had a written a role specifically for him. In May, Deadline reported Ben Cole had been cast as Todd, a sensate who would rather be [...] "normal". In September, Sylvester McCoy reportedly revealed he filmed three or four episodes of the second season of a Netflix show, later identified to be Sense8, and has signed to appear in further seasons if he is wanted. Martin Wuttke, who had minor roles in Cloud Atlas, also joined the cast in the second season.|$|E
2500|$|Sometimes a {{referrer}} {{system is}} implemented. A referrer {{is someone who}} introduced or otherwise [...] "helped someone" [...] with the decision to join the site (likewise, how a HTTP referrer is the site who linked one to another site). Usually, referrers are other forum members and members are usually rewarded for referrals. The referrer system is also sometimes implemented so that, if a visitor visits the forum though a link such as referrerid=300, the user with the id number (in this example, 300) would receive referral credit if the visitor registers. The purpose is commonly <b>just</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> credit (sometimes rewards are implied) to those who help the community grow.|$|E

2500|$|Critics {{questioned}} {{the portrayal of}} Jess' girlishness early on. Phillip Maciak of Slant Magazine initially expected New Girl as one of 2011's many new female-centric shows to [...] "be an exemplar of this new age of empowerment, but found instead that [...] "New Girl presents us with a narratively scattered, male fantasy of a show about a cooing woman-child in a polka-dot skirt who literally can't say the word 'penis' without giggling." [...] Meriwether stated {{it was not the}} show's goal to create a symbol and, pointing to gender double-standards, rejected opinions that Jess was emblematic of all women. She [...] "was really just writing about myself, and so my main goal is <b>just</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> Zooey, really fun, interesting things to do every week, and then just be really honest with myself about the character and present an interesting, funny female character on television." [...] Critics felt the first-season episode [...] "Jess & Julia" [...] was a meta reference to Jess' girliness and the initial [...] "adorkable" [...] ad campaign for New Girl, but Meriwether stated the episode was more a response to a controversial New York magazine cover story about Deschanel's personality and her views on women's issues.|$|E
