40|$|This {{presentation}} highlights {{issues relating}} to the digital capture printing of 2 D and 3 D artefacts and accurate colour reproduction of 3 D objects. There are a range of opportunities and technologies for the scanning and printing of two-dimensional and threedimensional artefacts. A successful approach of Polynomial Texture Mapping (PTM) technique, to create a Reflectance Transformation Image (RTI) is being used for the conservation and heritage of artworks as these methods are non invasive or non destructive of fragile artefacts. This approach captures surface detail of twodimensional artworks using a multidimensional approach that by using a hemispherical <b>dome</b> comprising 64 <b>lamps</b> to create an entire surface topography. The benefits of this approach are to provide a highly detailed visualization of the surface of materials and objects...|$|R

A 4-door 98 fastback appeared for one year only in 1950 and was called the Town Sedan, selling only 1,778 units.

Sales of the 98 Holiday nearly tripled to 8263, approaching the 11,989 sold of the Club coupe. Given the rapidly growing popularity of the 2-door Holiday hardtop, 1950 was the last year for the pillared Club coupe. Total sales set yet another record of 106,220.|$|R
