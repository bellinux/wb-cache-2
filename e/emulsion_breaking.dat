40|$|This thesis {{investigates the}} role of {{dispersed}} phase concentration on the drop deformation and breakup process of oil-in-water emulsions under flow. This work is motivated by two earlier studies: one by Mason & Bibette [4], on concentrated viscoelastic emulsions, which became monodisperse under {{the application of a}} simple shear flow, and a second, by Aronson [5], where a similar emulsion became monodisperse in a complex mixing flow. In {{the first part of the}} thesis, we study the effect of changing surfactant concentration, dispersed phase concentration and flow rate on the Aronson emulsion and two other oil-in-water emulsions. We find that emulsions in a mixing flow only become monodisperse around the close packing oil concentration of 70 %. Increasing mixer speed and surfactant concentration decreases the polydispersity. Final mean drop sizes follow the same trend as the polydispersity. Qualitatively similar results are obtained by subjecting the emulsions to a simple shear flow. In the second part of the thesis, we directly visualize drop breakup in a concentrated emulsion. We used a model emulsion of castor oil in aqueous maltose in a simple shear flow, over an oil concentration range of 2 [...] 75 %. Above 20 % oil concentration, we observe qualitative changes in the deformation process. Instead of deforming into well-defined cylindrical threads, drops deform into convoluted shapes, with fluid accumulating unevenly along the drop length. The end-pinching instability is also suppressed with increasing concentration. The time to breakup for the drops becomes increasingly independent of initial drop size with increasing concentration until at around the close packing volume fraction, all the drops in the <b>emulsion</b> <b>break</b> together...|$|R

40|$|The aim {{of these}} studies has been to {{investigate}} what {{information that can be}} obtained on gel-emulsions with nuclear magnetic resonance, NMR, as the investigating tool. The gel-emulsions are important in many technical applications such as in food products, in cosmetic and pharmaceutical formulations, and in emulsion explosives, {{just to name a few}} applications. We have worked with the NMR diffusometry technique as developed by Stejskal, Tanner and Callaghan, and have loaded the gel-emulsion water phase with simple molecules acting as model drugs, as well as ordinary drugs such as lidocaine to clarify the usefulness of this technique. In porous materials the NMR diffusometry technique measures the mean square displacement, which gives information on structure and obstruction effects. This technique can also measure the <b>emulsion</b> <b>break</b> down process. To measure the diffusion on very short time scales, as in small emulsion droplets, we have used a novel technique with modulated field gradient spin echo pulse trains. We have also applied the chemical shift imaging technique of molecular transport in gel-emulsions. With this technique we can monitor the spatial distribution of solutes as a function of time. In the interpretation of data from the application of these techniques one often uses the short gradient pulse limit approximation, but the quality of the information is a matter of some uncertainty. We have provided some insight on this problem. The NMR diffusometry technique measures diffusion in a time-window from a few 100 µs up to several seconds, and the root mean square displacement in the µm range, and have many advantages as; it is rapid, does not require any isotopic labelling or addition of disturbing probes, only small amounts of sample is needed, and it is a non-destructive method (the same sample can be repeatedly studied) ...|$|R

The extraction of Hg from samples was carried out by extraction induced by <b>emulsion</b> <b>breaking</b> (EIEB), which is based on the formation and breaking of water-in-oil emulsion between the oil samples and an extractant solution containing an emulsifying agent (surfactant) and nitric acid.

In these studies it was proven that the volume of sample and the concentration of HCl added to the sample extracts had significant influence on Hg response.

In the method, a water-in-oil emulsion was prepared by mixing the oil sample with an acid solution (HNO 3) of Triton X- 114 to allow the intense contact between the sample and the extractant acid solution. Afterwards, the emulsion was broken by heating and the acid aqueous phase deposited {{in the bottom of}} the flask was collected for the determination of the metals of interest. The method was optimized by studying the influence of several parameters such as the concentration of HNO 3 and the emulsifier agent (Triton X- 100 and Triton X- 114) in the extractant solution. The best results were verified when the procedure was performed with 5 mL of the sample and 1 mL of the extractant solution containing 15 %m/v of Triton X- 114 and 2. 8 molL− 1 of HNO 3. Also, the fastest <b>emulsion</b> <b>breaking</b> was verified when the emulsions were heated at 90 °C. In these conditions, the emulsions were broken in approximately 10 min. The quantification of Cr and Mn in the extracts was carried out by external calibration with aqueous standard solutions, which simplified the procedure.
