25|$|<b>Floaters</b> {{can occur}} when eyes age and in rare cases, <b>floaters</b> {{may be a}} sign of retinal {{detachment}} or a retinal tear.|$|E
25|$|Eye <b>floaters</b> – ocular {{mechanical}} stress created by LASIK {{have the potential}} to damage the vitreous, retina, and macula causing <b>floaters</b> as a result.|$|E
25|$|While {{surgeries}} {{do exist}} to correct for severe cases of <b>floaters,</b> {{there are currently}} no medications (including eye drops) that can correct for this vitreous deterioration. <b>Floaters</b> are often caused by the normal aging process and will usually disappear as the brain learns to ignore them. Looking up/down and left/right will cause the <b>floaters</b> to leave the direct field of vision as the vitreous humour swirls around due to the sudden movement. If <b>floaters</b> significantly increase in numbers and/or severely affect vision, {{then one of the}} below surgeries may be necessary.|$|E
5000|$|Additional {{valuation}} of an inverse <b>floater</b> {{can be determined}} {{by looking at the}} security's coupon leverage. To illustrate, suppose the creator of the <b>floater</b> and inverse <b>floater</b> divides the underlying collateral up into 100 bonds, 20 inverse an 80 <b>floater</b> bonds.The leverage in this structure is 4:1 of <b>floater</b> to inverse bonds. As such the following relationship must hold: ...|$|R
40|$|This essay studies three exotic floaters: capped <b>floater,</b> {{average rate}} <b>floater</b> and one-way <b>floater.</b> We first study the product {{structure}} and economics of capped <b>floater</b> and valuate fair level of yield enhancement of capped <b>floater</b> assuming the underlying interest rate process follows the one-factor no-arbitrage Hull-White (HW) model. Comparative-static analysis of interest spread of capped money market account (MMA) is conducted. We then propose {{a new twist}} to a LIBOR-in-arrears swap: average rate <b>floater</b> whose coupon rate {{is based on the}} average of several fixings. We describe the characteristics and the benefits of average rate <b>floater</b> and apply the technique of valuing a LIBOR-in-arrears swap to valuate this <b>floater.</b> Finally, we discuss the origin and rationales of one-way <b>floater</b> and use the Monte Carlo simulations to estimate the magnitude of the interest spread of one-way <b>floater</b> employing the Brace-Gatarek-Musiela (BGM) interest rate model. All models in this essay have been calibrated using the data of Hong Kong’s capital markets...|$|R

25|$|The {{number of}} <b>floaters</b> treated during a {{treatment}} session {{depends on the}} type of <b>floater(s)</b> and the laser energy required to treat the <b>floater(s)</b> (that is, to convert the floater material into a gas). During treatment, the ophthalmologist will monitor the level of laser energy used for each shot, as well as the total amount of energy delivered to the eye. In order to ensure safe, effective treatment with minimal patient discomfort, if these energy levels fall outside a predetermined range then any remaining <b>floaters</b> will need to be treated in a subsequent treatment session.|$|E
25|$|<b>Floaters</b> {{are able}} to catch and refract light in ways that {{somewhat}} blur vision temporarily until the floater moves to a different area. Often they trick persons who are troubled by <b>floaters</b> into thinking they see {{something out of the}} corner of their eye that really is not there. Most persons come to terms with the problem, after a time, and learn to ignore their <b>floaters.</b> For persons with severe <b>floaters</b> it is nearly impossible to completely ignore the large masses that constantly stay within almost direct view.|$|E
25|$|Despite {{implementation}} of Stage 1 {{of the management}} plan, {{a record number of}} <b>floaters</b> (2,395) used the Smith River in 1989. This was an increase of 63.8 percent over the 1988 level (1,462 <b>floaters).</b>|$|E
50|$|After {{each player}} {{receives}} five cards, the next card {{is taken to}} be a <b>floater.</b> Players other than the dealer must bet 1 chip {{to look at the}} <b>floater.</b> Players can make bids with or without the <b>floater</b> (without is a higher bid than with).|$|R
40|$|When a <b>floater</b> {{such as a}} ship or an {{offshore}} structure is damaged in the sea, {{it is necessary to}} determine whether the <b>floater</b> will sink in water or not. If the <b>floater</b> will sink, the time to sink should be estimated to make an emergency plan. In addition, causes of the flooding should be investigated carefully. For this purpose, a method for performing intermediate flooding and sinking simulation of the damaged <b>floater</b> in time domain is proposed in this study. Overall process of the proposed method consists of several steps. In the first step, data of the damaged <b>floater</b> such as hull form and compartments are prepared. In the second step, physical characteristics of the <b>floater</b> such as the increased weight considering incoming water, the center of gravity, the changed buoyancy, and the center of buoyancy are calculated at every time step. In the third step, the quasi-static equilibrium position of the <b>floater</b> is calculated. The second and third steps are repeated until the <b>floater</b> reaches to sink or to be in equilibrium. As a result, the final condition of the <b>floater</b> can be determined. To check the feasibility of the proposed method, it is applied to a simple box problem. Finally, it is applied to intermediate flooding simulation of a barge-type damaged <b>floater.</b> Two cases having damaged holes of different locations are selected. As a result, it was confirmed that the <b>floater</b> can be in equilibrium or sink according to the damaged position. The time to be in equilibrium or the time to sink was estimated...|$|R
50|$|The <b>floater</b> coupon is {{allocated}} to the premium fixed rate tranche principal, in the example the $75mm '8 off 6', giving the <b>floater</b> tranche of '$75mm 8% cap + 40 LIBOR SEQ floater'.

25|$|In {{the event}} of an {{appearance}} of sudden flashes of light or <b>floaters,</b> an eye doctor needs to be consulted immediately. A shower of <b>floaters</b> or any loss of vision, too, is a medical emergency.|$|E
25|$|There {{are various}} causes for the {{appearance}} of <b>floaters,</b> of which the most common are described here. Simply stated, any damage to the eye that causes material to enter the vitreous humour can result in <b>floaters.</b>|$|E
25|$|Sometimes the {{appearance}} of <b>floaters</b> has to be attributed to dark specks in the tear film of the eye. Technically, these are not <b>floaters,</b> but they do look the same {{from the viewpoint of}} the patient. Persons with blepharitis or a dysfunctional meibomian gland are especially prone to this cause, but ocular allergies can also cause the problem. To differentiate between material in the vitreous humour of the eye and debris in the tear film, one can look at the effect of blinking: debris in the tear film will move quickly with a blink, while <b>floaters</b> are largely unresponsive to it. Tear film debris is diagnosed by eliminating the possibility of true <b>floaters</b> and macular degeneration.|$|E
5000|$|The pie <b>floater</b> (also {{known as}} a <b>floater</b> and a pea <b>floater),</b> is an Australian dish {{particularly}} common in Adelaide and, to a lesser degree, Sydney. It commonly consists of a traditional Australian-style meat pie, usually sitting, but sometimes submerged (sometimes upside down) {{in a bowl of}} thick pea soup made from Blue boiler peas [...] It is usually garnished with tomato sauce, and the consumer may also add mint sauce, salt, pepper and/or malt vinegar to personal preference. The pie <b>floater</b> is usually purchased in the street from pie-carts as a late evening meal.|$|R
40|$|In this work, {{we develop}} a frequency-domain {{model for the}} novel Ocean Grazer (OG) wave energy {{converter}} (WEC), with the intention to study the hydrodynamic behavior of its array of <b>floater</b> elements individually connected to power take-off (PTO) systems. To investigate these hydrodynamic interactions, we lean on the boundary element method (BEM) open-source code NEMOH, in order to solve the scattering and radiation problem. The interconnection between the <b>floater</b> elements is realized through hinges, which add extra constraint equations to the multibody problem. In particular, we illustrate this with a <b>floater</b> array consisting of ten hinged <b>floater</b> elements in open sea conditions, which we verify by comparing it with our previously developed time-domain model. Accordingly, the hydrodynamic behavior of the <b>floater</b> array is quantified by the response amplitude operator (RAO) of the <b>floater</b> elements and the extracted energy. The present work will be instrumental in the synthesis of advanced control algorithms for the OG-WEC...|$|R
50|$|<b>Floater</b> {{experimented with}} {{acoustic}} in-store performances throughout the late 1990s, {{but around the}} time of their New Year's Eve show in 2000/2001 at the Aladdin Theater, <b>Floater</b> began including entire acoustic sets in their performances. A part of the Aladdin show would be released on their second live album, Live at the Aladdin. <b>Floater</b> subsequently released Alter, their fifth full-length album in July 2002. The album was noted as a first step in altering their sound; however, the shift in sound was markedly less than expected. <b>Floater's</b> sound shifted from a focus on heavy riffs to a well-rounded and eclectic sound.|$|R
25|$|Aggressive {{marketing}} campaigns are currently promoting {{the use of}} laser vitreolysis {{for the treatment of}} <b>floaters.</b> No strong evidence currently exists for the treatment of <b>floaters</b> with laser vitreolysis. Currently, the strongest available evidence comparing these two treatment modalities are retrospective case series.|$|E
25|$|Patients with retinal tears may {{experience}} <b>floaters</b> if {{red blood cells}} are released from leaky blood vessels, and those with uveitis or vitritis, as in toxoplasmosis, {{may experience}} multiple <b>floaters</b> and decreased vision due to the accumulation of white blood cells in the vitreous humour.|$|E
25|$|The {{most common}} cause of <b>floaters</b> is {{shrinkage}} of the vitreous humour. This gel-like substance consists of 99% water and 1% solid elements. The solid portion consists of a network of collagen and hyaluronic acid, with the latter retaining water molecules. Depolymerization of this network makes the hyaluronic acid release its trapped water, thereby liquefying the gel. The collagen breaks down into fibrils, which ultimately are the <b>floaters</b> that plague the patient. <b>Floaters</b> caused in this way tend to be few in number and of a linear form.|$|E

25|$|Increasing {{background}} illumination or using a pinhole to effectively decrease pupil diameter may allow {{a person to}} obtain {{a better view of}} his or her own <b>floaters.</b> The head may be tilted in such a way that one of the <b>floaters</b> drifts towards the central axis of the eye. In the sharpened image the fibrous elements are more conspicuous.|$|E
25|$|The {{presence}} of retinal tears with new onset of <b>floaters</b> was surprisingly high (14%; 95% confidence interval, 12–16%) {{as reported in}} a meta-analysis published {{as part of the}} Rational Clinical Examination Series in the Journal of the American Medical Association. Patients with new onset flashes and/or <b>floaters,</b> especially when associated with visual loss or restriction in the visual field, should seek more urgent ophthalmologic evaluation.|$|E
25|$|<b>Floaters</b> {{present at}} birth usually remain lifelong, while those that appear later may {{disappear}} within weeks or months. They are not uncommon, {{and do not}} cause serious problems for most persons; they represent {{one of the most}} common presentations to hospital eye services. A survey of optometrists in 2002 suggested that an average of 14 patients per month per optometrist presented with symptoms of <b>floaters</b> in the UK. However, <b>floaters</b> are more than a nuisance and a distraction to those with severe cases, especially if the spots seem to constantly drift through the field of vision. The shapes are shadows projected onto the retina by tiny structures of protein or other cell debris discarded over the years and trapped in the vitreous humour. <b>Floaters</b> can even be seen when the eyes are closed on especially bright days, when sufficient light penetrates the eyelids to cast the shadows. It is not, however, only elderly persons who are troubled by floaters; they can also become a problem to younger people, especially if they are myopic. They are also common after cataract operations or after trauma.|$|E

Peter Cornett does vocals on his second <b>Floater</b> song, Invisible, featuring Dave Amador on trumpet.|$|R
50|$|By this time, <b>Floater</b> hired Alex Steininger {{as their}} new manager. The band set its sights on {{achieving}} national recognition. <b>Floater</b> released its eighth studio album, Wake in 2010 {{and paid for}} it {{out of their own}} pockets. The album received both positive and negative reviews from both the Willamette Week and The Portland Mercury. Already, Steininger's influence can be felt as <b>Floater</b> has made appearances on PDXposed and OPB's Live Wire program.|$|R
25|$|Inflammatory {{eye disease}} can develop {{early in the}} disease course and lead to {{permanent}} vision loss in 20 percent of cases. Ocular involvement {{can be in the}} form of posterior uveitis, anterior uveitis, or retinal vasculitis. Anterior uveitis presents with painful eyes, conjuctival redness, hypopyon, and decreased visual acuity, while posterior uveitis presents with painless decreased visual acuity and visual field <b>floaters.</b> A rare form of ocular (eye) involvement in this syndrome is retinal vasculitis which presents with painless decrease of vision with the possibility of <b>floaters</b> or visual field defects.|$|E

5000|$|The {{construction}} of a floater/inverse {{can be seen in}} two stages. The first stage is to synthetically raise the effective coupon to the target <b>floater</b> cap, {{in the same way as}} done for the PO/Premium fixed rate pair. As an example using $100mm 6% collateral, targeting an 8% cap, we generate $25mm of PO and $75mm of '8 off 6'. The next stage is to cut up the premium coupon into a <b>floater</b> and inverse coupon, where the <b>floater</b> is a linear function of the index, with unit slope and a given offset or spread. In the example, the 8% coupon of the '8 off 6' is cut into a <b>floater</b> coupon of: ...|$|R
40|$|Floating {{males are}} usually {{thought of as}} nonbreeders. However, some {{floating}} individuals are able to reproduce through extra-pair copulations. <b>Floater</b> reproductive success can impact breeders’ sex ratio, reproductive variance, multiple paternity and inbreeding, particularly in small populations. Changes in reproductive variance alter the rate of genetic drift and loss of genetic diversity. Therefore, genetic management of threatened species requires an understanding of <b>floater</b> reproduction and determinants of floating behaviour to effectively conserve species. Here, we used a pedigreed, free-living population of the endangered New Zealand hihi (Notiomystis cincta) to assess variance in male reproductive success and test the genetic (inbreeding and heritability) and conditional (age and size) factors that influence <b>floater</b> behaviour and reproduction. <b>Floater</b> reproduction is common in this species. However, <b>floater</b> individuals have lower reproductive success and variance in reproductive success than territorial males (total and extra-pair fledglings), so their relative impact on the population's reproductive performance is low. Whether an individual becomes a <b>floater,</b> and if so then how successful they are, is determined mainly by individual age (young and old) and to lesser extents male size (small) and inbreeding level (inbred). Floating males have a small, but important role in population reproduction and persistence of threatened populations...|$|R
