5|$|The Public Faroese Health School (Faroese: Heilsuskúli Føroya) in Suðuroy is a {{vocational}} school offering {{two types of}} education. The health care assistant education (Heilsuhjálpari) takes fifteen months. Following graduation, pupils can choose to leave the school and work in home care and retirement homes. Alternatively they can continue with another 22 months and become an assistant nurse (heilsurøktari). The assistant nurse can work in various places, mostly in retirement homes or hospitals. The graduates <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Health</b> School are mainly women. In 2012 almost 90% of the School's graduates were women.|$|E
5|$|Beginning in the 1960s, {{scientists}} with the U.S. Public Health Service published reports about radioactivity released from Hanford, {{and there were}} protests <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>health</b> departments of Oregon and Washington. In response to {{an article in the}} Spokane Spokesman Review in September 1985, the Department of Energy announced to declassify environmental records and, in February 1986, released 19,000pages of previously unavailable historical documents about Hanford's operations. The Washington State Department of Health collaborated with the citizen-led Hanford Health Information Network (HHIN) to publicize data about the health effects of Hanford's operations. HHIN reports concluded that residents who lived downwind from Hanford or who used the Columbia River downstream were exposed to elevated doses of radiation that placed them at increased risk for various cancers and other diseases. A mass tort lawsuit brought by two thousand Hanford downwinders against the federal government has been in the court system for many years. Two of six plaintiffs who went to trial in 2005 were awarded $500,000 in damages.|$|E
5|$|In 2004, the Brighton Marine Palace Pier Company (owned by the Noble Organisation), {{admitted}} {{an offence}} of breaching public safety under the Health and Safety at Work Act {{and had to}} pay fines and costs of £37,000 after a fairground ride was operated with part of its track missing. A representative <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Health</b> and Safety Executive said that inadequate procedures were {{to blame for the}} fact that nothing had been done to alert staff or passengers that the ride would be dangerous to use. The pier management came into criticism from Brighton and Hove City Council, who thought they were relying too much on fairground rides, some of which were being built too high.|$|E

5|$|The Enforcers and Inspectors start hunting Makishima, who aims {{to destroy}} the society created by the Sibyl System. To do this he causes riots {{in the city to}} draw the police away <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Health</b> and Welfare Ministry's Nona Tower facility, where Sibyl is located. Akane and Kogami stop Makishima's forces while Enforcer Shūsei Kagari follows one of Makishima's allies to the tower where Bureau Chief Joshu Kasei kills Makishima's ally and Kagari to keep the true form of Sibyl a secret. Kasei tells Makishima that Sibyl is a hivemind of {{similarly}} asymptomatic individuals and wishes him to join the system but Makishima escapes. Realizing the truth behind Makishima's escape, Kogami leaves the group to kill him. Akane is later directly contacted by the Sibyl system, which orders her to capture Makishima alive. She agrees to do this on the condition that they withdraw the execution order for Kogami. Learning that Makishima plans to commit bioterrorism to weaken Japan's economy and bring the system down, the Criminal Investigation Division searches for both Makishima and Kogami. There, Makishima tries killing Ginoza but Masaoka sacrifices his life to save him. Despite Akane's efforts, Kogami kills Makishima and the former's erstwhile comrades never see him again.|$|E

25|$|In {{response}} to the questions raised by {{the large amount of}} funding he took <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>health</b> care industry, Baucus declared a moratorium as of July 1, 2009 on taking more special interest money from health care political action committees. Baucus, however, refused to return as part of his moratorium any of the millions of dollars he has received from health care industry interests before July 1, 2009, or to rule out a resumption of taking the same or greater health care industry contributions in the future. His policy on not taking health care industry money reportedly still allowed him to accept money from lobbyists or corporate executives, who, according to The Washington Post, continued to make donations after July 1, 2009. A watchdog group found that in July 2009 Baucus accepted additional money <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>health</b> care industry in violation of his own self-defined moratorium terms, reportedly leading Baucus to return those monies.|$|E

25|$|Baucus {{has been}} criticized for his ties to the health {{insurance}} and pharmaceutical industries, {{and was one of the}} largest beneficiaries in the Senate of campaign contributions from these industries. From 2003-08, Baucus received $3,973,485 <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>health</b> sector, including $852,813 from pharmaceutical companies, $851,141 from health professionals, $784,185 from the insurance industry and $465,750 from HMOs/health services, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. A 2006 study by Public Citizen found that between 1999 and 2005 Baucus, along with former Senate majority leader Bill Frist, took in the most special-interest money of any senator.|$|E
25|$|The Congressional Budget Office's last {{estimate}} {{predicted that}} if both bills were passed {{into law in}} 2010, the net reduction in federal deficits would be $143 billion over the 2010–2019 period {{as a result of}} the proposed changes in direct spending and revenues. That figure comprises $124 billion in net reductions deriving <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>health</b> care and revenue provisions and $19 billion in net reductions deriving from the education provisions. The health care and revenue provisions consist in part of several new taxes, fees on health-related industries, and cuts in government spending on healthcare programs like Medicare Advantage.|$|E
25|$|When {{damage is}} inflicted upon characters, it is deducted from their Hit Points, which are {{calculated}} with the Strength stat (prior to GURPS 4th Edition, Hit Points were derived <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Health</b> stat). Like most other RPGs, {{a loss of}} hit points indicates physical harm being inflicted upon a character, which can potentially lead to death. GURPS calculates shock penalties when someone is hit, representing the impact it causes and the rush of pain that interferes with concentration. Different weapons can cause different 'types' of damage, ranging from crushing (a club or mace), impaling (a spear or arrow), cutting (most swords and axes), piercing (bullets), and so on.|$|E

25|$|A {{statistical}} analysis {{of the impact of}} political contributions on individual senators' support for the public insurance option conducted by Nate Silver has suggested that Baucus was an unlikely supporter of the public option in the first place. Based on Baucus's political ideology and the per capita health care spending in Montana, Silver's model projects that there would be only a 30.6% probability of Baucus supporting a public insurance option even if he had received no relevant campaign contributions. Silver calculates that the impact on Baucus of the significant campaign contributions that he has received <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>health</b> care industry further reduces the probability of his supporting a public insurance option from 30.6% to 0.6%.|$|E
25|$|Carmel Jackson (also Roberts) is {{a fictional}} {{character}} from the BBC soap opera EastEnders, played by Judith Jacob from 5 June 1986 to 24 August 1989.
