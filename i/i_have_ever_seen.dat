25|$|At Brisbane, on a wicket {{that was}} the worst that <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>ever</b> <b>seen,</b> the Yorkshireman was superb. The head-high bouncer was safely ignored. The chest-high {{deliveries}} of both the pace men and the spinners were played safely to the ground, {{out of the way of}} the many grasping hands in the leg-trap, and Hutton's display was a perfect lesson in the art of batsmanship...that will long remain in my memory, being by far the best innings <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>ever</b> <b>seen</b> played.|$|E
25|$|The {{movie is}} 126 minutes long, and I {{would guess that}} at least 100 of those minutes, maybe more, are {{concerned}} specifically and graphically with {{the details of the}} torture and death of Jesus. This is the most violent film <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>ever</b> <b>seen.</b>|$|E
25|$|Its {{purpose is}} to plant the seeds of devilment and trouble-breeding {{in the days to}} come in the mind and heart of every American Negro.... It is the dirtiest, filthiest, lousiest, most obscene piece of writing that <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>ever</b> <b>seen</b> in print. I would hate to have a son or {{daughter}} of mine permitted to read it; it is so filthy and so dirty. But it comes from a Negro, and you cannot expect any better from a person of his type.|$|E

25|$|Bing Crosby {{served as}} an honorary {{director}} of the festival from 1949 to 1951. Charles Laughton visited in 1961, saying “I have just seen the four best productions of Shakespeare that <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>ever</b> <b>seen</b> in my life.” Laughton begged to play King Lear, but died in 1962 before he could fulfill the dream. Hollywood gossip columnist Hedda Hopper visited in 1962, attending two plays. Stacy Keach was a cast member in 1962 and 1963. Duke Ellington and his orchestra presented a benefit concert in 1966 that brought many luminaries to Ashland.|$|E
25|$|I {{regret to}} say {{that none of us}} {{approved}} of the marriage at that time. Mother thought Jack was too young, and Lottie and I felt that Olive, being in musical comedy, belonged to an alien world. Ollie had all the rich, eligible men of the social world at her feet. She had been deluged with proposals from her own world of the theater as well. Which was not at all surprising. The beauty of Olive Thomas is legendary. The girl had the loveliest violet-blue eyes <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>ever</b> <b>seen.</b> They were fringed with long dark lashes that seemed darker because of the delicate translucent pallor of her skin. I could understand why Florenz Ziegfeld never forgave Jack for taking her away from the Follies. She and Jack were madly in love with one another but I always thought of them as a couple of children playing together.|$|E
25|$|He was a {{tall and}} bulky person with a {{prominent}} stomach and invariably played with a clean shaven head without any hat or cap {{or any kind of}} head gear. He always wore very loose pants and after batting for a while or keeping wicket for sometime his shirt will be hanging out of the trousers and somebody must tuck it in, now and then. He had a rather ugly and uncouth stance at the wicket as he held his bat very low and bent his body forward so much that his head was practically in line with the top of the wickets. Those who watched him from the on side could only see his prominent hind portion of the body sticking up while the head, bat and the rest of Dilawar Hussain were hardly visible. However, he had a very sound defense and so {{it was very difficult to}} get him out. He was the most selfish batsman that <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>ever</b> <b>seen.</b>|$|E

25|$|I got my {{stopwatch}} {{going again}} {{to check the}} length of each man's turn at the front. Generally in a race of the Baracchi type, the changes are very rapid, with stints {{of no more than}} 300 yards. Altig was at the front when I started the check — and he was still there a minute later. Something must be wrong. Altig wasn't even swinging aside to invite Anquetil through... Suddenly, on a flat road, Anquetil lost contact and a gap of three lengths appeared between the two partners. There followed one of the most sensational things <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>ever</b> <b>seen</b> in any form of cycle racing during my 35 years' association with the sport — something which I consider as great a physical performance as a world hour record or a classic road race win. Altig was riding at 30mph at the front — and had been doing so for 15 minutes. When Anquetil lost contact, he had to ease the pace, wait for his partner to go by, push him powerfully in the back, sprint to the front again after losing 10 yards in the process, and again settle down to a 30mph stint at the front. Altig did this not just once but dozens of times.|$|E
500|$|Kenny also {{provided}} {{the voice of}} Gary, SpongeBob's meowing sea snail, and the narrator in the episode. According to him, [...] "It was always Steve's intention that the narrator be a nod to his beloved Jacques Cousteau." [...] Kenny described Cousteau's voice as [...] "very dispassionate, very removed, very flatline, even when he’s describing something miraculous and beautiful." [...] At first, {{they found that the}} narrator [...] "just sounds bored," [...] so they decided that he [...] "has to sound a little fun and playful." [...] Kenny said, [...] "'Eet ees the most amazing thing <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>ever</b> <b>seen</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>ever</b> <b>seen</b> in my life.' We found that after a while we had to make the narrator a little more playful than that." ...|$|E
500|$|Heisman {{also said}} of Strupper [...] "Were I {{compelled}} to risk {{my head on}} what one absolutely unaided gridster might accomplish, football under arm and facing eleven ferocious opponents, I would rather choose and chance this man on how he might come through the gauntlet than any ball carrier <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>ever</b> <b>seen</b> in action." ...|$|E

500|$|Some critics {{maintain}} that Ken Russell's The Devils (1971) {{was influenced by}} Reeves's film, with one writer calling Russell's movie [...] "the apex of the 'historical' witch-persecution films started by Witchfinder General." [...] However, Russell has noted that he hated Reeves's film, describing it as [...] "one of the worst movies <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>ever</b> <b>seen</b> and certainly the most nauseous." ...|$|E
500|$|Princeton coach Bill Roper {{watched the}} Michigan-Minnesota {{game as a}} guest of Fielding Yost. [...] After the game, Roper had high praise for Kipke: [...] "Kipke is the {{greatest}} punter <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>ever</b> <b>seen...</b> I have never seen such deadly accuracy... It was impossible for the Minnesota quarterback to handle Kipke's kicks. [...] Most of them went out of bounds some fifty yards from the line of scrimmage." ...|$|E
500|$|Jaws: The Revenge {{received}} negative {{reviews from}} film critics. While {{production of the}} other three films in the series took around two years for each film, Jaws: The Revenge was made in less than nine months. According to associate producer and production manager Frank Baur during the sequel's filming, [...] "This (Revenge) will be the fastest <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>ever</b> <b>seen</b> a major film planned and executed in all of my 35 years as a production manager." ...|$|E

500|$|Delivering {{lectures and}} giving interviews, Goldman enthusiastically {{supported}} the Spanish anarcho-syndicalists. She wrote regularly for Spain and the World, a biweekly newspaper {{focusing on the}} civil war. In May 1937, however, Communist-led forces attacked anarchist strongholds and broke up agrarian collectives. Newspapers in England and elsewhere accepted the timeline of events offered by the Second Spanish Republic at face value. British journalist George Orwell, present for the crackdown, wrote: [...] "he accounts of the Barcelona riots in May...beat everything <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>ever</b> <b>seen</b> for lying." ...|$|E
500|$|Coach Yost added: [...] "Schultz {{is without}} doubt the best {{center in the}} country. [...] In fact, Schulz is the best {{man in the middle}} of the line <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>ever</b> <b>seen</b> in all my {{football}} experience". [...] In naming Schulz to his All-America team, Walter Camp said: [...] "He is well over six feet in height, yet a fast, powerful man who gets well over the field and makes more tackles in a game than any other man on his team. [...] In addition he is an accurate passer and feeds the ball well to his backs either for kicks or runs".|$|E
500|$|Construction {{was carried}} out by Messrs Brameld and Smith of Manchester and {{development}} was completed in late 1909. The stadium hosted its inaugural game on 19 February 1910, with United playing host to Liverpool. However, the home side were unable to provide their fans with a win to mark the occasion, as Liverpool won 4–3. A journalist at the game reported the stadium as [...] "the most handsomest , the most spacious and the most remarkable arena <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>ever</b> <b>seen.</b> As a football ground it is unrivalled in the world, it is an honour to Manchester and the home of a team who can do wonders when they are so disposed".|$|E

500|$|The {{trial began}} before Mr Justice McCardie on 4 March 1930, with Hastings for the company, and Stuart Bevan and Norman Birkett for the syndicate. The first witness called was Coen himself, who Hastings later {{described}} as [...] "the best witness without exception that <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>ever</b> <b>seen</b> in the witness-box". He was interviewed over seven days by Hastings, then Bevan and then Birkett. Eight {{days into the}} trial {{the matter of the}} certificate came up, and Oppenheimer was unable to provide an explanation. As a result, the jury found against the syndicate - they were ordered to pay back all of the company's costs, and all of its losses.|$|E
500|$|Corpsmen {{picked up}} Kuhl {{and brought him}} to a ward tent, where it was {{discovered}} he had a temperature of and was later diagnosed with malarial parasites. Speaking later of the incident, Kuhl noted [...] "at the time it happened, [...] was pretty well worn out...I think he was suffering a little battle fatigue himself." [...] Kuhl wrote to his parents about the incident, but asked them to [...] "just forget about it." [...] That night, Patton recorded the incident in his diary: [...] " [...] the only errant coward <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>ever</b> <b>seen</b> in this Army. Companies should deal with such men, and if they shirk their duty, they should be tried for cowardice and shot." ...|$|E
500|$|In 1963 the Doubleday {{publishing}} company asked Haley {{to write a}} book about the life of MalcolmX. American writer and literary critic Harold Bloom writes, [...] "When Haley approached Malcolm with the idea, Malcolm gave him a startled look ..." [...] Haley recalls, [...] "It was one of the few times <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>ever</b> <b>seen</b> him uncertain." [...] After MalcolmX was granted permission from Elijah Muhammad, he and Haley commenced work on the Autobiography, a process which began as two-and three-hour interview sessions at Haley's studio in Greenwich Village. Bloom writes, [...] "Malcolm was critical of Haley's middle-class status, as well as his Christian beliefs and twenty years of service in the U.S. Military." ...|$|E
