The reader will understand that the preservation of the boat at all, in white water, was owing to the circumstance that the rocks all around it lay so near the surface of the sea as to prevent the possibility of agitating the element very seriously, and to {{the fact that she was}} near the lee side of the reef. Had the breakers been of the magnitude of those which are seen where the <b>deep</b> <b>rolling</b> billows of the ocean first meet the weather side of shoals or rocks, a craft of that size, and so loaded, could not possibly have passed the first line of white water without filling.

Places like those in which Mulford had waded on the reef, while it was calm, would now have proved fatal to the strongest frame, since human powers were insufficient long to withstand the force of such waves as did glance over even these shallows.|$|E

6000|$|Quitting Portland, it was {{necessary}} to make rather a round turn on leaving the breakwater, as right ahead on the starboard bow was a small light-ship, looking like the skeleton of a vessel, and marking the presence of a dangerous shoal, known by the most appropriate and significant name of [...] "The Shambles." [...] Inside this lay a long and turbid ridge of angry water, where the Race of Portland ran, and where a <b>deep</b> <b>rolling</b> swell, like the Bay of Biscay on a reduced scale, kept tumbling and breaking into spray like drifts of snow against the high, gaunt cliffs. It, however, required no actual watching of the low green mounds of water, which seemed butting against the coast, to convince all on board that the Great Eastern was at sea. To the infinite relief and comfort of all the passengers, the vessel began to yield to reason, and to behave as much like another ship as she could consistently with her size. It would be too much to say she rolled at this time; for when the Great Eastern rolls, if ever she does roll, travellers may depend upon her accomplishing something in that peculiar style of ocean navigation quite in proportion to her bulk; but one thing is certain-- that she went from side to side sufficiently to show that she was susceptible of the motion of the water, and that if ever she steams across a beam sea, she is likely to move to it with a will, though slowly and easily.|$|E
60|$|You {{will want}} to know how the {{situation}} is viewed at this moment in India itself, by those who are responsible for the Government of India. This view is not a new view at all. It is that the situation is not gravely dangerous, but it requires serious and urgent attention. That seems for the moment to be the verdict. Extremists are few, but they are active; their field is wide, their nets are far spread. Anybody who has read history knows that the Extremist often beats the Moderate by his fire, his heated energy, his concentration, by his very narrowness. So be it; we remember it; we watch it all, with that lesson of historic experience full in our minds. Yet we still hold that it would be the height of political folly for us at this moment to refuse to do all we can, with prudence and energy, to rally the Moderates to the cause of the Government, simply because the policy will not satisfy the Extremists. Let us, if we can, rally the Moderates, and if we are told that the policy will not satisfy the Extremists, so be it. Our line will remain the same. It is the height of folly to refuse to rally sensible people, because we do not satisfy Extremists. I am detaining you unmercifully, but I doubt whether--and do not think I say it because it happens to be my department--of all the questions that are to be discussed perhaps for years to come, any question can be in all its actual foundations, and all its prospective bearings, more important than the question of India. There are many aspects of it which it is not possible for me to go into, as, for example, some of its Military aspects. I repeat my doubt whether there is any question more commanding at this moment, and for many a day to come, than the one which I am impressing upon you to-night. Is all that is called unrest in India mere froth? Or is it a <b>deep</b> <b>rolling</b> flood? Is it the result of natural order and wholesome growth in this vast community? Is it natural effervescence, or is it deadly fermentation? Is India with all its heterogeneous populations--is it moving slowly and steadily to new and undreamt of unity? It is the vagueness of the discontent, which is not universal--it is the vagueness that makes it harder to understand, harder to deal with. Some of them are angry with me. Why? Because I {{have not been able to}} give them the moon. I have got no moon, and if I had I would not part with it. I will give the moon, when I know who lives there, and what kind of conditions prevail there.|$|E
60|$|He {{was a very}} {{handsome}} man, about six feet high, with large light grey eyes, a straight nose, and a well cut chin. His lips were thin, but his teeth were perfect,--only {{that they had been}} supplied by a dentist. His grey hair encircled his head, coming round upon his forehead in little wavy curls, in a manner that had conquered the hearts of spinsters by the dozen in the cathedral. It was whispered, indeed, that married ladies would sometimes succumb, and rave about the beauty, and the dignity, and the white hands, and the <b>deep</b> <b>rolling</b> voice of the Rev. Henry Fitzackerley Chamberlaine. Indeed, his voice was very fine when it would be heard from the far-off end of the choir during the communion service, altogether trumping the exertion of the other second-rate clergyman who would be associated with him at the altar. And he had, too, great gifts of preaching, which he would exercise once a week during thirteen weeks of the year. He never exceeded twenty-five minutes; every word was audible throughout the whole choir, and there was a grace about it that was better than any doctrine. When he was to be heard the cathedral was always full, and he was perhaps justified in regarding himself as one of the ecclesiastical stars of the day. Many applications were made to him to preach here and there, but he always refused. Stories were told of how he had declined to preach before the Queen at St. James's, averring that if Her Majesty would please to visit Salisbury, every accommodation should be provided for her. As to preaching at Whitehall, Westminster, and St. Paul's, it was not doubted that he had over and over again declared that his appointed place was in his own stall, and that he did not consider that he was called to holding forth in the market-place. He was usually abroad during the early autumn months, and would make sundry prolonged visits to friends; but his only home was his prebendal residence in the Close. It was not much of a house to look at from the outside, being built with the plainest possible construction of brick; but within it was very pleasant. All that curtains, and carpets, and armchairs, and books, and ornaments could do, had been done lavishly, and the cellar was known to be the best in the city. He always used post-horses, but he had his own carriage. He never talked very much, but when he did speak people listened to him. His appetite was excellent, but he was a feeder not very easy to please; it was understood well by the ladies of Salisbury that if Mr. Chamberlaine was expected to dinner, something special must be done in the way of entertainment. He was always exceedingly well dressed. What he did with his hours nobody knew, but {{he was supposed to be}} a man well educated at all points. That he was such a judge of all works of art, that not another like him was to be found in Wiltshire, nobody doubted. It was considered that he was almost as big as the bishop, and not a soul in Salisbury would have thought of comparing the dean to him. But the dean had seven children, and Mr. Chamberlaine was quite unencumbered.|$|E
40|$|Abstract—In {{the present}} study, {{response}} surface methodology {{has been used}} to optimize turn-assisted <b>deep</b> cold <b>rolling</b> process of AISI 4140 steel. A regression model is developed to predict surface hardness and surface roughness using response surface methodology and central composite design. In the development of predictive model, <b>deep</b> cold <b>rolling</b> force, ball diameter, initial roughness of the workpiece, and number of tool passes are considered as model variables. The rolling force and the ball diameter are the significant factors on the surface hardness and ball diameter and numbers of tool passes are found to be significant for surface roughness. The predicted surface hardness and surface roughness values and the subsequent verification experiments under the optimal operating conditions confirmed the validity of the predicted model. The absolute average error between the experimental and predicted values at the optimal combination of parameter settings for surface hardness and surface roughness is calculated as 0. 16 % and 1. 58 % respectively. Using the optimal processing parameters, the surface hardness is improved from 225 to 306 HV, which resulted in an increase in the near surface hardness by about 36 % and the surface roughness is improved from 4. 84 µm to 0. 252 µm, which resulted in decrease in the surface roughness by about 95 %. The depth of compression is found to be more than 300 µm from the microstructure analysis and this is in correlation with the results obtained from the microhardness measurements. Taylor hobson talysurf tester, micro vickers hardness tester, optical microscopy and X-ray diffractometer are used to characterize the modified surface layer.

5000|$|<b>Deep</b> <b>rolling</b> is {{a method}} of cold work {{deformation}} and burnishing of internal combustion engine crankshaft journal fillets to increase durability and design safety factors. Compressive residual stresses can be measured {{below the surface of}} a deep-rolled fillet. Other types of fillets on shafts or tubes can also benefit from this method. Cast iron crankshafts will experience the most improvement potentially doubling their fatigue life. Typically the crankshaft is machined with under-cut fillets as opposed to tangential radiused for ease of manufacture, although all types can be deep-rolled. Most automakers are currently utilizing this crankshaft technology including: General Motors LLC, Ford Motor Company, and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles (FCA) The North American based Hegenscheidt-MFD Corporation in Sterling Heights, MI, was established in 1966.

5000|$|The {{cold work}} {{produced}} from {{this process is}} typically minimal, similar to the cold work produced by laser peening, only a few percent, but a great deal less than shot peening, gravity peening or, <b>deep</b> <b>rolling.</b> Cold work is particularly important because the higher the cold work at {{the surface of a}} component, the more vulnerable to elevated temperatures and mechanical overload that component will be and the easier the beneficial surface residual compression will relax, rendering the treatment pointless. In other words, a component that has been highly cold worked will not hold the compression if it comes into contact with extreme heat, like an engine, and will be just as vulnerable as it was to start. Therefore, LPB and laser peening stand out in the surface enhancement industry because they are both thermally stable at high temperatures. The reason LPB produces such low percentages of cold work is because of the aforementioned closed-loop process control. Conventional shot peening processes have some guesswork involved and are not exact at all, causing the procedure to have to be performed multiple times on one component. For example, shot peening, in order to make sure every spot on the component is treated, typically specifies coverage of between 200% (2T) and 400% (4T). This means that at 200% coverage (2T), 5 or more impacts occur at 84% of locations and at 400% coverage (4T), it is significantly more. The problem is that one area will be hit several times while the area next to it is hit fewer times, leaving uneven compression at the surface. This uneven compression results in the whole process being easily [...] "undone", as was mentioned above. LPB requires only one pass with the tool and leaves a deep, even, beneficial compressive stress.|$|E
