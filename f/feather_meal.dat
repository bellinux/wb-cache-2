Four diets each were formulated for the starter and finisher phases. Diet A was the control while, B and C contained 30 g/kg diet of BOM or HBFM each, and D had a combination of 15 : 15 g/kg of BOM: HBFM. The formulation was {{at the expense of}} fishmeal, which was 30 g/kg in the control diet. The starter and finisher diets contained 230 g and 210 g crude protein/kg, respectively and supplied 3000 Kcal/kg of metabolizable energy for the two phases. 180 day-old Anak 2000 broilers were randomly divided into 12 groups of 15 birds each. Each diet was fed to three groups of the chicks in a fully randomize manner. Results showed that the retention of dry matter, crude protein, crude fiber, calcium and phosphorus were not significantly (P> 0. 05) affected in both the starter and finisher phases. The retention of ether extract was significantly (P 0. 05) affected. The abdominal fat pad was significantly (P 0. 05) influenced by the combined effect of the by-products.

40|$|Two {{experiments}} {{were carried out}} (pre-starter and starter phases) to evaluate the effect of <b>feather</b> and blood <b>meal</b> on performance, organ development and digestibility and retention of nutrients in broilers. In the first experiment, it was used 280 birds and in experiment 2, it was used 240 birds. The experimental diets were formulated with four levels of <b>feather</b> and blood <b>meal</b> (0 %, 2 %, 4 % and 6 %) all of them isonutritive and isoenergetic. A metabolic assay was developed on the 4 th and 7 th days of age in experiment 1 and on the 14 th and 17 th days of age in experiment 2. In these periods, one bird per experimental unit was sacrificed for determination of morphometry of the digestive organs. In experiment 1, {{in which it was}} evaluated the pre-starter phase, there was a negative linear effect of the levels of <b>feather</b> and blood <b>meal</b> on weight gain and intake in 1 - 21 day of age period. By using <b>feather</b> and blood <b>meal</b> in the diet, it was observed a linear effect on digestibility coefficient of dry matter, nitrogen and ether extract; there was a quadratic effect on retention of dry matter and nitrogen and linear effect on the retention of ether extract. However, performance of birds in the starter phase (experiment 2) was not affected by levels of <b>feather</b> and blood <b>meal</b> used in the diet. Coefficient of digestibility of dry matter and ether extract and retention of ether extract were affected. In both phases, mortality and morphometric data of digestive organs were not influenced by the levels of meal in the diet. Formulation of diets with up to 6 % <b>feather</b> and blood <b>meal</b> for chickens in the pre-starter phase (from 1 to 7 days) is not a good alternative because it worsens performance of birds. However, from the initial phase (from 8 to 21 days), the use of <b>feather</b> and blood <b>meal</b> in the diet is viable. <b>Feather</b> and blood <b>meal</b> can be used at levels 3. 0 or 4. 0 % for broilers in the pre-starter and starter phase...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT The {{digestibility}} {{of animal}} by-product protein {{was measured using}} a direct color-imetric assay of protein in feed and excreta samples. Excreta samples were generated by using a modification of the true metabolizable energy procedure (Sibbald, 1979). Dried excreta and feed samples were extracted with, 5 N NaOH for 2 hr at 45 C in an orbital incubator, and the solubilized protein was quantitated directly using Coomassie brilliant blue dye-binding. Digestibility of meat and bone meal protein by this method ranged between 70. 3 and 96. 0 %. The digestibility of <b>feather</b> <b>meals</b> ranged between 79. 0 and 86. 1 %.

30|$|The {{amino acid}} {{composition}} of the obtained hydrolysates soluble fraction, was a not only {{a result of the}} hydrolytic action of microbial enzymes on the keratinous substrate, but also of the enrichment of the hydrolysate with bacterial cell components. The predominant occurrence of glutamine and aspartic acid was in accordance with the feather hydrolysate produced by K. rosea (Bertsch and Coello 2005). However there were significant differences in the content of valine and leucine, typically most abundant in <b>feather</b> <b>meals,</b> but also histidine, methionine and phenylalanine (Adejumo et al. 2016). High concentration of the latter might be a result of the predominant chymotrypsin-like specificity of proteases, typical for many known keratinases (Brandelli et al. 2010). Nonetheless, according to Bertsch and Coello (2005), fermentation of feathers within a culture of K. rosea was advantageous in order to improve the amino acid balance of the keratin hydrolysate, but also to improve the overall digestibility of the product.|$|R

40|$|Aqua feed {{manufacture}} requires flexible formulations {{and effective}} methods to screen suitable feed ingredients. In vitro digestion may {{assist in the}} characterization and quality control of protein in feedstuffs for fish species once standardized species-specific digestive enzyme extracts are available. This study aimed to develop a species-specific in vitro enzymatic method to assess protein digestion in fish under the pH-stat concept. Two carnivorous (rainbow trout, Oncorhynchus mykiss, and cobia, Rachycentron canadum) and one omnivorous (Nile tilapia, Oreochromis niloticus) fish species were used as models. Crude digestive enzyme extracts were recovered from stomach and pyloric caeca or intestine of individuals of different weight groups, feeding status, and farming systems. The hydrolytic capacity of the species-specific enzyme extracts was standardized on purified protein substrates and measured as degree of protein hydrolysis (DH) in the pH-stat assay. A group of twenty-four feed ingredients, including fish meals and by-products {{of plant and animal}} origin, was assessed for DH using the recovered enzymes from stomach and pyloric caeca/intestine. Ingredients were hydrolyzed with fish (i) stomach extract, (ii) pyloric caeca/intestine extract or (iii) stomach enzymes followed by pyloric caeca/intestine extract. Among plant by-products, cotton seed meal presented the highest DH with stomach plus pyloric caeca/intestine enzymes, followed by soy protein concentrate and soybean meals. Blood meals were the land animal by-product with higher DH outputs compared to poultry by-product <b>meals</b> and <b>feather</b> <b>meals.</b> No significant difference was observed among the DHs of fish meals. The significance of measuring the DH with stomach enzyme extract is still not well understood but, overall, the pre-hydrolysis of feedstuffs with stomach enzymes increased pyloric caeca/intestine DH value. For cage and pond farmed Nile tilapia, ingredient DHs followed the same trend, describing a significant correlation and a high determination coefficient regression. Routine use of the method may yet depend on the prompt availability of more practical sources of enzymes. The determination of the degree of protein hydrolysis by the in vitro pH-stat with species-specific enzymes has shown to be a precise method that may be a useful tool to rank feed ingredients, and also an accessory method in the quality control of feedstuffs...|$|R

Non-oxidant processes pyrolysis based were conducted both at laboratory and pilot scale aiming for product complete neutralization with respect to pathogen germs, bio-degradation and medium-long term storage risk. The results of the study represent alternatives to currently used disposal solutions mainly based on incineration. For the experimental analysis three main waste types were considered: primary stage processing meat industry (feathers), second stage processing meat industry (bones). Noticeable quantities of organic residues such as <b>feather,</b> bone <b>meal,</b> blood and offal waste are generated by poultry processing industries. These residues making up about 25 % to 37 % of initial product body weight are a considerable waste of the meat processing industry, due to high specific volume, being produced about million tons per year world-wide. Disposal of chicken meat processing industry is a major concern and accumulation of important waste quantities results in environmental pollution of soil, water and air with direct impact on human health. Depending on processing costs the industry sector uses the incineration (usually provided by specialized companies) or the production of meat and bone meal. To limit the risk of disease transmission via feed and food chain the recovery of organic materials for animal feed is banned. The incineration {{presents the}} major disadvantage of important energy consumption due high water content of the product together with polluting emissions and low efficiency if energy recovery is used.

There were five treatments in <b>feather</b> <b>meal</b> preparation: CFM (non-enzymatically treated <b>feather</b> <b>meal),</b> K 6 FM (K 6 keratinase treated <b>feather</b> <b>meal),</b> K 82 FM (K 82 keratinase treated <b>feather</b> <b>meal),</b> K 6 :K 82 FM [K 6 and K 82 keratinase (5 : 1) treated feather meal] and CMFM (commercial enzyme treated <b>feather</b> <b>meal).</b> The pepsin digestibility of CFM (70  %) and CMFM (68  %) {{was significantly higher than}} K 6 FM (60  %), K 82 FM (61  %) and K 6 :K 82 FM (63  %). Total amino acid content of K 82 FM (89.65 / 100  g) was the highest compared with the other treatments. The nutrient digestibility of the feather meals was determined for broiler chicks between 21 and 27  days old. The apparent nitrogen retention of K 82 FM (85.82  %) and K 6 FM (77.31  %) was significantly higher than K 6 :K 82 FM (55.42  %), CMFM (45.70  %) and CFM (48.16  %). The apparent metabolisable energy (AMEn) was not significantly different between the <b>feather</b> <b>meal</b> treatments, although K 82 FM, K 6 FM and K 6 :K 82 FM showed AMEn higher than CMFM and CFM. The results indicated that both K 6 and K 82 keratinase had a positive effect on the protein quality of the <b>feather</b> <b>meal</b> produced by the enzymatic–hydrothermal method.|$|E
40|$|Agricultural {{production}} has {{kept pace with}} the population growth (FAO, 2012). One major input for a productive agriculture are fertilizers. Despite their effect on yield and quality, they also have considerable effects on the environment leading to emission of greenhouse gases, acidification, eutrophication and use of scare resources (Ruttan, 2002; Kitzes et al., 2007). However, unlike other agricultural inputs, fertilizers cannot be substituted {{and a reduction in}} the fertilizer use can lead to major yield decreases or a production shifting to less suitable areas. By considering the above mentioned statements this thesis aims to expand the knowledge of the environmental impact of fertilizers in general and innovation supply chain thinking, knowledge exchange and innovation adoption within the fertilizer supply chain in particular with the main research question: To what extended can the environmental impact of fertilizers be improved by accelerate the adoption and diffusion of (eco) -innovations within the fertilizer supply chain? To answer this question, the thesis was divided into two main theoretical perspectives. The first part focuses on the environmental impact of mineral fertilizers and relevant alternatives. The second part focuses on innovation adoption and diffusion. In these thesis LCA calculations of different fertilizer types (e. g. urea, ammonium nitrate) and production types (single nutrient fertilizers, bulk blends or complex fertilizers) try to examine the amount of emissions during fertilizer production, transportation and application. With literature data of emissions during the fertilizer production, completed with data from expert interviews along the fertilizer supply chain a holistic LCA calculation was conducted. The results showed that especially urea should be used with special care in temperate climate zone and produced with best production technologies. Additionally, the production and application of phosphorus should always be part of agricultural LCA studies, because this plant nutrient also can have effects on the results in the impact categories use of scare resources and salt water eutrophication. With an optimized fertilization strategy, the environmental burden can be reduced by up to 15 %. Chapter 3 focuses on greenhouse gas emissions. The carbon footprint, used with special care and an accurate developed framework, can be a good tool to estimate these greenhouse gas emissions (Finkbeiner, 2009; Hillier et al., 2009; Pandey et al., 2011). By calculating the carbon footprint with a basic LCA approach a scientific accepted method was used. The carbon footprint of different mineral fertilizers (urea, ammonium nitrate, calcium ammonium nitrate and urea ammonium nitrate), stabilized nitrogen fertilizers (using different inhibitors), secondary raw materials (<b>feather</b> <b>meals,</b> blood-and-bone-meals and leguminous crops meals) and a combined irrigation and fertilization were compared in order to find a more sustainable solution. Here especially the uses of a double inhibitor to delay the nitrogen transformation in the soils can {{have an effect on the}} carbon footprint results. The second part of this thesis concentrates on the fertilizer supply chain and the adoption of eco-innovations. Eco-innovations are one option to reduce the environmental impact of fertilizers without compromising on fertilizer productivity. Although numerous eco-innovations in the domain of fertilizers are available, they have no sufficient adoption rate. Here a systematic literature review combined with the types of eco-innovations within an expanded technology acceptance model (TAM) was used to estimate the main drivers. The study distinguishes between disruptive and continuous as well as process, product and other types of innovations to get a better understanding for specific situations. The distinction between the types of innovations was made, because it was assumed that the nature of the specific innovation influences the adoption. The results lead to the assumption that disruptive innovations are mostly pushed by a high quality support and a well-functioning information flow; continuous innovations are more pushed by a good access to credits and an informative environment. Chapter 5 tries to explaining the low adoption of eco-innovation in the German fertilizer supply chain in particular. Expert interviews along the fertilizer supply chain (researcher, producer, traders) and a detailed questionnaire with closed and open questions were used to estimate the necessity to change. Furthermore, the knowledge of different eco-innovations was used to evaluate the knowledge sharing of the fertilizer supply chain. Findings suggest that drivers for eco-innovations are perceived differently by the various actors in the fertilizer supply chain. The overall knowledge on eco-innovations decreases downstream the chain...|$|R
40|$|Avian {{influenza}} viruses are {{now widely}} recognized as important threats to agricultural biosecurity and public health, and as the potential source for pandemic human influenza viruses. Human infections with avian influenza viruses have been reported from Asia (H 5 N 1, H 5 N 2, H 9 N 2), Africa (H 5 N 1, H 10 N 7), Europe (H 7 N 7, H 7 N 3, H 7 N 2), and North America (H 7 N 3, H 7 N 2, H 11 N 9). Direct and indirect public health risks from avian influenzas are not restricted to the highly pathogenic H 5 N 1 "bird flu" virus, and include low pathogenic as well as high pathogenic strains of other avian influenza virus subtypes, e. g., H 1 N 1, H 7 N 2, H 7 N 3, H 7 N 7, and H 9 N 2. Research {{has shown that the}} 1918 Spanish Flu pandemic was caused by an H 1 N 1 influenza virus of avian origins, and during the past decade, fatal human disease and human-to-human transmission has been confirmed among persons infected with H 5 N 1 and H 7 N 7 avian influenza viruses. Our ability to accurately assess and map the potential economic and public health risks associated with avian influenza outbreaks is currently constrained by uncertainties regarding key aspects of the ecology and epidemiology of avian influenza viruses in birds and humans, and the mechanisms by which highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses are transmitted between and among wild birds, domestic poultry, mammals, and humans. Key factors needing further investigation from a risk management perspective include identification of the driving forces behind the emergence and persistence of highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses within poultry populations, and a comprehensive understanding of the mechanisms regulating transmission of highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses between industrial poultry farms and backyard poultry flocks. More information is needed regarding the extent to which migratory bird populations to contribute to the transnational and transcontinental spread of highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses, and the potential for wild bird populations to serve as reservoirs for highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses. There are still uncertainties regarding the epidemiological and ecological mechanisms that regulate "spill-over" and "spill-back" transmission of highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses between poultry and wild bird populations, and the interspecies transmission of avian influenza from infected birds to humans and other species of mammals. Further investigations are needed {{to evaluate the effectiveness of}} poultry vaccination programs for the control and eradication of avian influenza in poultry populations at the national and regional level, and the effect of long term poultry vaccination programs on human public health risks from avian influenza viruses. There is a need to determine risk factors associated with the extent of direct human involvement in the spread and proliferation of avian influenza viruses through commercial supply chain and transportation networks, and specific risk factors associated with domestic and international trade in live poultry, captive wild birds, poultry food products, (meat, eggs), poultry by-products (<b>feathers,</b> poultry <b>meal),</b> poultry manure, and poultry litter. Addressing these issues will greatly enhance our ability to implement economically and ecologically sustainable programs for the control of avian influenza outbreaks in wild and domesticated birds, increase our capability for promoting the protection of wild bird populations from disease and disruption, and help improve food security and public health in countries worldwide...|$|R

O objetivo do presente estudo foi investigar o uso de atrativos alimentares em dietas formuladas exclusivamente à base de proteína de origem vegetal (PV), e seus efeitos no desempenho, composição corporal e digestibilidade das dietas pelo carnívoro black bass, Micropterus salmoides, condicionados a aceitar ração seca. Novecentos juvenis (26, 54 ± 1, 53 g) foram estocados em 60 aquários de polietileno de 90 L (15 peixes/aquário), em delineamento experimental totalmente ao acaso (n= 3), e alimentados {{ad libitum}} em duas refeições diárias (07 h 00 m e 17 h 00 m), durante 13 dias, com uma dieta basal (100 % PV) contendo seis níveis de proteína solúvel de peixe  PSP (0, 5, 1, 0, 1, 5, 2, 0, 2, 5 e 3, 0 %); Fisharom ®  FA (0, 02, 0, 04, 0, 06, 0, 08, 0, 10 e 0, 12 %); silagem de peixe  SP (1, 0, 2, 0, 3, 0, 4, 0, 5, 0 e 6, 0 %); um controle positivo (10 % de farinha de peixe) e um controle negativo (dieta basal sem atrativos). Os peixes alimentados com a dieta contendo FA 0, 02 % apresentaram melhor taxa de crescimento, ganho de peso e conversão alimentar, mas não apresentaram diferenças dos demais tratamentos (P> 0, 05). Os peixes alimentados com dietas contendo SP como atrativo apresentaram os piores resultados de desempenho. Em uma segunda etapa, foi avaliado o desempenho e a composição corporal de 560 juvenis (3, 06 ± 0, 20 g) estocados em gaiolas de 60 L, dentro de caixas de polietileno de 1. 000 L, instaladas em laboratório com um sistema fechado de recirculação de água com temperatura (27 o C ± 1, 07 o C) e fotoperíodo (14 L: 10 E) controlados, em um delineamento experimental totalmente ao acaso (n= 4), e alimentados ad libitum em duas refeições diárias (07 h 00 m e 17 h 00 m), durante 43 dias, com 7 dietas isonitrogenadas (40 % de PB) e isocalóricas (3. 500 kcal/kg), contendo níveis decrescentes de proteína de origem vegetal: 100 PV: 00 PA; 100 PV + 0, 02 % Fisharon ®; 80 PV: 20 PA; 60 PV: 40 PA; 40 PV: 60 PA; 50 PV: 50 PA (sem farinha de peixe); e uma dieta controle (ração comercial). A inclusão de farinha de peixe e farinha de penas foi limitada em 7 %; a inclusão de farinha de vísceras e farinha de carne em 15 %. DL-metionina (98 %) e L-lisina (80 %) foram adicionadas automaticamente através de matriz de aplicativo de formulação de ração. Em uma terceira etapa, foi avaliada a digestibilidade das rações utilizadas no experimento anterior. Para tanto, 1. 960 juvenis (14, 0 ± 1, 0 cm) foram confinados em gaiolas de polipropileno e alimentados durante 40 dias, no período diurno, com as sete dietas do experimento anterior acrescidas de 0, 5 % de óxido de cromio. No período noturno as gaiolas eram transferidas para aquários cilíndrico-cônicos de 200 L, onde as fezes eram coletadas por sedimentação em recipiente refrigerado. O farelo de soja pode ser utilizado como substituto parcial de fontes protéicas e origem animal em rações formuladas para o black bass; a farinha de vísceras pode ser considerada uma boa opção como fonte protéica de origem animal em rações. Os melhores resultados de desempenho foram relacionados aos tratamentos controle e 50 PV: 50 PA. A necessidade do uso da farinha de peixe na formulação de dietas para espécies carnívoras é no mínimo questionável e a determinação da digestibilidade das rações, visando maior precisão em formulações de custo mínimo para peixes carnívoros, deve ser prática corrente na indústria da alimentação de peixes. Commercial farming of carnivorous fish demands {{the use of}} a complex group of practices of production and feeding management, the reduction of the environmental impact of the feeds and the minimization of {{the use of a}}nimal protein sources in the diets. The present study investigated the use of feed stimulants in diets formulated exclusively out of plant protein, and their effects in growth performance, body composition and digestibility of the feeds for the carnivore largemouth bass, Micropterus salmoides, conditioned to accept dry feed. Nine hundred juvenile largemouth bass (26. 54 ± 1. 53 g) were stocked in 60, 90 -L polyethylene aquaria (15 fish/aquarium), in a totally randomized experimental design (n= 3). Fish were fed ad libitum two daily meals (0700 and 1700), for 13 days, with a basal diet (100 % plant protein) containing increasing levels of fish soluble protein  FSP (0. 5, 1. 0, 1. 5, 2. 0, 2. 5, and 3. 0 %); Fisharom TM  FA (0. 02, 0. 04, 0. 06, 0. 08, 0. 10 and 0. 12 %); fish silage  FS (1. 0, 2. 0, 3. 0, 4. 0, 5. 0 and 6. 0 %); a positive control (10 % of fish meal) and a negative control (basal diet without stimulants). Fish fed the diet containing 0. 02 %FA presented better growth rate, weight gain and feed conversion rate, but did not differ from the other treatments (P> 0, 05). Fish fed diets containing FS as stimulant presented the poorest performance. Next, the effect of different levels of dietary plant protein in the performance and body composition of the species was evaluated. Five hundred and sixty juvenile largemouth bass (3. 06 ± 0. 20 g) were stocked in 60 -L cages, inside 1, 000 -L polyethylene tanks, installed at a laboratory with closed water-recirculating system and controled temperature (27 o C ± 1. 07 o C) and photoperiod (14 L: 10 D). Fish were fed ad libitum two daily meals (0700 and 1700), for 43 days, with 7 isonitrogenous (40 % of PB) and isoenergetic (3, 500 kcal/kg) diets, containing decreasing levels of plant protein: 100 PP: 00 AP; 100 PP + 0. 02 % Fisharom®; 80 PP: 20 AP; 60 PP: 40 AP; 40 PP: 60 AP; 50 PP: 50 AP (without fish meal); and a control diet (commercial feed). Inclusion of fish <b>meal</b> and <b>feathers</b> <b>meal</b> was limited to 7 %; the inclusion of poultry by-product meal and meat and bone meal to 15 %. DL methionine (98 %) and L-lysine (80 %) were added automatically through feed formulation software matrix. Trial was set up in a totally randomized experimental design (n= 4). Finally, digestibility of the diets used in the experiment 2 was studied. One thousand, nine hundred and eighty juvenile largemouth bass (14. 0 ± 1. 0 cm) conditioned to accept artificial, dry feed were confined in polypropilene cages and fed, for 40 days, in day time, with the seven experimental diets added of 0. 5 % of cromic oxide. In the night, cages were transferred to cylindrical-conical bottomed, 200 -L aquaria, where feces were collected by sedimentation into refrigerated containers. Data were submitted to the ANOVA and Tukeys test of comparison of means through statistical software package SAS (P= 0. 05). Soybean meal can be used as partial substitute of animal protein in diets for largemouth bass; the poultry by-product meal shows as a good option as animal protein source in these rations. Best performances were related to the control treatments and 50 PP: 50 AP; the need for the use of fishmeal in the formulation of diets for carnivorous species is, at least, questionable. Results of the digestibility trials demonstrated the importance of determining the digestibility of the rations, if precision in the formulation of least-cost feeds for carnivorous fish is the ultimate goal...|$|R
