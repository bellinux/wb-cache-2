40|$|Background & AimsGastroparesis is a {{complication}} of diabetes characterized by delayed <b>emptying</b> <b>of</b> <b>stomach</b> contents {{and accompanied by}} early satiety, nausea, vomiting, and pain. No safe and reliable treatments are available. Interleukin 10 (IL 10) activates the M 2 cytoprotective phenotype of macrophages and induces expression of heme oxygenase 1 (HO 1) protein. We investigated whether IL 10 administration could improve gastric emptying and reverse the associated cellular and electrical abnormalities in diabetic mice. MethodsNonobese diabetic mice with delayed gastric emptying were given either IL 10 (0. 1 – 1 μg, twice/day) or vehicle (controls). Stomach tissues were isolated, and sharp microelectrode recordings were made of the electrical activity in the gastric muscle layers. Changes to interstitial cells of Cajal (ICC), reduced {{nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate}} diaphorase, and levels and distribution of HO 1 protein were determined by histochemical and imaging analyses of the same tissues. ResultsGastric emptying remained delayed in vehicle-treated diabetic mice but returned to normal in mice given IL 10 (n = 10 mice; P <. 05). In mice given IL 10, normalization of gastric emptying was associated with a membrane potential difference between the proximal and distal stomach, and lower irregularity and higher frequency of slow-wave activity, particularly in the distal stomach. Levels of HO 1 protein were higher in stomach tissues from mice given IL 10, and ICC networks were more organized, better connected, and more evenly distributed compared with controls.

40|$|Metodopramide hastens <b>emptying</b> <b>of</b> the <b>stomach.</b> Since it may {{be given}} to {{patients}} before operation, the sedative and toxic effects of 10 - and 20 -mg doses given Lm. were studied in patients and student volunteers. Saline and diazepam 10 mg were used as placebo and reference drugs. Neither dose of metodopramide had as good a sedative effect as diazepam 10 mg. Restlessness occurred in {{a small number of}} patients but there were no other side effects apart from dryness of the mouth. Metodopramide (Maxolon) is a very interesting compound which has been in clinical use for a few years. It hastens <b>emptying</b> <b>of</b> the <b>stomach</b> and aids propulsion through the upper gastrointestinal tract (Margieson, Sorby and Williams, 1966; Eisner, 1971), as well as abolishing irregular peristaltic activity (Johnson, 1973). Thus, {{it is not surprising that}} it has been used in radiology of the gastro-intestinal tract (Kred, 1970; 1973), to aid <b>emptying</b> <b>of</b> the <b>stomach</b> prior to operation in obstetrical (Howard and Sharp, 1973) and surgical emergenc...|$|R

40|$|Energy {{balance is}} {{relevant}} to diverse issues in ecology, physiology, and evolution. To determine whether lizards are generally in positive energy balance, we synthesized a massive data set on the proportion of individual lizards (N = 18223) with empty stomachs (127 species), representing nine families distributed on four continents, primarily in temperate zone deserts {{but also in the}} neotropics. The average percentage <b>of</b> individuals with <b>empty</b> <b>stomachs</b> is low (13. 2 %) across all species, even among desert lizards, suggesting that most lizards are in positive energy balance. Nevertheless, species vary substantially in this regard (among all species, 0 % to 66 % <b>of</b> individuals have <b>empty</b> <b>stomachs).</b> Several patterns are detectable among species with unusually high frequencies <b>of</b> <b>empty</b> <b>stomachs.</b> In particular, nocturnal lizards “run on empty” more often on average than do diurnal species (24. 1 % vs. 10. 5 %); and this pattern holds even for nocturnal vs. diurnal geckos (21. 2 % vs. 7. 2 %, respectively). Several (but not all) top predators have a higher frequency <b>of</b> <b>empty</b> <b>stomachs</b> than do species that feed at lower trophic levels. Diet breadth and body size appear unrelated to frequency <b>of</b> <b>empty</b> <b>stomachs.</b> Widely foraging species sometimes have a high frequency <b>of</b> <b>empty</b> <b>stomachs</b> relative to sit-and-wait species, but patterns vary among continents and appear to be confounded by phylogeny and trophic level. Ant-eating specialists have uniformly low frequencies <b>of</b> <b>empty</b> <b>stomachs.</b> Diurnal termite specialists also have low frequencies <b>of</b> <b>empty</b> <b>stomachs,</b> but nocturnal ones have high frequencies. Lizards from certain families (Gekkonidae [including Pygopodidae], Gymnophthlamidae, and Varanidae) {{are more likely to have}} empty stomachs than are those of other families (Agamidae, Iguanidae, Lacertidae, Scincidae, and Teiidae) ...|$|R
25|$|Treatment <b>of</b> {{overdose}} includes <b>emptying</b> <b>of</b> the <b>stomach</b> via induced vomiting or by gastric lavage. Careful {{monitoring and}} supportive treatment, monitoring of renal and liver function, and maintaining adequate hydration is {{recommended by the}} manufacturer.

50|$|Gastroparesis (delayed gastric emptying) {{may occur}} and {{is due to}} {{metabolic}} causes (e.g. poorly controlled diabetes mellitus), decreased gastric motility (e.g. due to head injury) or pyloric obstruction (e.g. pyloric stenosis). Delayed gastric emptying usually only affects the <b>emptying</b> <b>of</b> the <b>stomach</b> <b>of</b> high-cellulose foods such as vegetables. Gastric <b>emptying</b> <b>of</b> clear fluids such as water or black coffee is only affected in highly progressed delayed gastric emptying.|$|R
50|$|Ingesting a {{great deal}} of alcohol in {{a short amount of time}} causes alcohol to quickly enter the bloodstream. Mixing alcohol with normal soft drinks, rather than diet drinks delays the dizzying effects of alcohol because the sugary mixture slows the <b>emptying</b> <b>of</b> the <b>stomach,</b> so that {{drunkenness}} occurs less rapidly.|$|R
50|$|Metoclopramide is a {{medication}} used mostly for stomach and esophageal problems. It {{is commonly used}} to treat and prevent nausea and vomiting, to help with <b>emptying</b> <b>of</b> the <b>stomach</b> in people with delayed stomach emptying, and to help with gastroesophageal reflux disease. It {{is also used to}} treat migraine headaches.|$|R
50|$|Gastroparesis is {{a medical}} {{condition}} characterised by delayed <b>emptying</b> <b>of</b> the <b>stomach</b> {{when there is no}} mechanical gastric outlet obstruction. Its cause is most commonly idiopathic, a diabetic complication or a result of abdominal surgery. The condition causes nausea, vomiting, fullness after eating, early satiety (feeling full before the meal is finished), abdominal pain and bloating.|$|R
40|$|The {{effects of}} {{metoclopramide}} on gastric emptying and gastric secretion have been assessed in man using the double sampling test meal.

40|$|Many authors {{state that}} cod (Gadus morhua) do not feed during the {{spawning}} period. However, this {{more or less}} established fact has rarely been investigated in the field. Here, the content <b>of</b> <b>stomachs</b> from Northeast Arctic cod (NEAC) and Norwegian coastal cod (NCC) sampled from the spawning ground in Lofoten were examined over a 10 -year period (1996 – 2006). The occurrence of food in the <b>stomachs</b> <b>of</b> spawning cod, <b>stomach</b> fullness, diet composition, and variation in these variables between NEAC and NCC, year, and sex were analysed and compared. The analysis shows that cod do feed, {{even when they are}} in a spawning state. NCC had a lower proportion <b>of</b> <b>empty</b> <b>stomachs</b> and the stomachs were fuller than those from NEAC. Females had a lower proportion <b>of</b> <b>empty</b> <b>stomachs</b> than males and their stomachs were in general fuller. Herring (Clupea harengus) dominated the diet of cod. However, cod consumption of herring on the spawning grounds seems to be a minor source of mortality on herring. Although spawning cod do feed, the proportion <b>of</b> <b>empty</b> <b>stomachs</b> was higher and stomach fullness was lower than in <b>stomachs</b> <b>of</b> NEAC from the Barents Sea...|$|R

50|$|The {{best ways}} to avoid the spins are to {{continuously}} keep monitoring one's alcohol intake, which involves limiting one's intake to a reasonable level and to eat before drinking, which allows alcohol to be metabolized more efficiently and steadily and will keep one's blood sugar levels more even. Certain foods, such as crackers and cheese, have the right levels of carbohydrates, fat, and protein to help further slow the <b>emptying</b> <b>of</b> one's <b>stomach.</b>|$|R

50|$|Reassurance in a calm, safe {{environment}} is beneficial. Agitation {{can be safely}} addressed with benzodiazepines such as lorazepam or diazepam. Neuroleptics such as haloperidol are recommended against because they may have adverse effects. LSD is rapidly absorbed, so activated charcoal and <b>emptying</b> <b>of</b> the <b>stomach</b> will be <b>of</b> little benefit, unless done within 30-60 minutes of ingesting an overdose of LSD. Sedation or physical restraint is rarely required, and excessive restraint may cause complications such as hyperthermia (over-heating) or rhabdomyolysis.|$|R
50|$|The {{duodenum}} also {{regulates the}} rate <b>of</b> <b>emptying</b> <b>of</b> the <b>stomach</b> via hormonal pathways. Secretin and cholecystokinin are released from {{cells in the}} duodenal epithelium in response to acidic and fatty stimuli present there when the pylorus opens and releases gastric chyme into the duodenum for further digestion. These cause the liver and gall bladder to release bile, and the pancreas to release bicarbonate and digestive enzymes such as trypsin, lipase and amylase into the duodenum as they are needed.|$|R
40|$|We {{investigated}} the feeding {{of the dominant}} small pelagic fish—herring Clupea harengus membras and three-spined stickleback Gasterosteus aculeatus—in the Gulf of Riga (Baltic Sea) in the summers of 1999 – 2014. The share <b>of</b> <b>empty</b> <b>stomachs,</b> stomach fullness and taxonomic composition of fish diet was analysed. On average, large herring had the highest (19 %) and small herring the lowest (6 %) share <b>of</b> <b>empty</b> <b>stomachs.</b> Small (< 1 mm) cladoceran Bosmina spp. {{was the most important}} prey for three-spined stickleback; preying on small (< 1. 5 mm) copepod Eurytemora affinis was the most efficient for small herring, while Bosmina spp. and E. affinis were equally important for the large herring, followed by the large (mean body length < 2. 0 mm) non-indigenous cladoceran Cercopagis pengoi. The number of prey taxa per stomach exhibited significant differences between the fish groups studied; the highest mean value was recorded for small herring and the lowest for three-spined stickleback (2. 1 and 1. 4 taxa, respectively). Although present, the fish group-specific spatial dynamics in feeding parameters (share <b>of</b> <b>empty</b> <b>stomachs</b> and feeding intensity) were weak compared to the observed interannual variation...|$|R
25|$|There {{is limited}} {{information}} on overdose with ofloxacin. Current advise {{for the management}} of an acute overdose <b>of</b> ofloxacin is <b>emptying</b> <b>of</b> the <b>stomach,</b> along with close observation, and making sure that the patient is appropriately hydrated. Hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis is of only limited effectiveness. Overdose may result in central nervous system toxicity, cardiovascular toxicity, tendon/articular toxicity, and hepatic toxicity as well as renal failure and seizure. Seizures have however, been reported to occur at therapeutic dosage as well as severe psychiatric reactions.|$|R
40|$|Transit {{times were}} {{evaluated}} in 23 obese subjects before and 1, 4 and 12 months after biliopancreatic by-pass. A {{modified version of}} the method of Hinton et al. was used to determine <b>emptying</b> <b>of</b> the <b>stomach</b> and partial and total transit times. <b>Emptying</b> <b>of</b> the <b>stomach</b> was normal preoperatively. After surgery, it was almost immediate, except in two subjects with stomitis. Both transit times were virtually unchanged. Since the segment between the stomach and the ileocaecal valve is only half as long as in the normal subject, the results show that the by-pass leads to a slowing of transit that concerns the small intestine only, is quickly established, and does not change in the course of time. Evaluation of the altered anatomical and functional situation, and the absence of a correlation between the long-term behaviour of transit times on one hand and of lipid malabsorption and weight loss on the other-hand, suggest that a slower transit time must not be regarded as a compensation mechanism, except insofar as it restricts the degree of malabsorption set up immediately after surgery. Preliminary studies of enterohormonal changes following the by-pass indicate that increased glucagon and decreased motiline values are mainly responsible for slower transit times...|$|R

30|$|The L-arginine could induce {{synthesis}} of NO from {{nitric oxide synthase}} [16]. The results showed that L-arginine has promoted increasing <b>of</b> NO in <b>stomach</b> <b>of</b> normal mice, so model of FD was made successfully for 5 days post-i.p. with L-arginine and that reported by literature [16]. Lower dose of injection with oMWCNTs (100 μg/mouse) did not induce changes of NO and ChAT in stomach, but obvious effect has been observed post-i.v. with 500 or 800 μg/mouse (p < 0.01, Figures 5, 6). The higher content Ach could facilitate contraction of gastrointestinal smooth muscle, and lower content NO could inhibit relaxation of gastrointestinal smooth muscle [16, 21]. Therefore, the <b>emptying</b> force <b>of</b> <b>stomach</b> has been improved post-i.v. with higher dose of oMWCNTs. This implied that the gastric emptying could be enforced significantly after i.v. with higher dose of oMWCNTs (500, 800 μg/mouse).|$|R
5|$|In 2005, the US Food and Drug Administration {{approved}} the drug exenatide (marketed as Byetta) {{for the management}} of type 2 diabetes. It is a synthetic version of a protein, exendin-4, derived from the Gila monster's saliva. In a three-year study with people with type 2 diabetes, exenatide led to healthy sustained glucose levels and progressive weight loss. The effectiveness is because the lizard protein is about 50% identical to glucagon-like peptide-1 analog (GLP-1), a hormone released from the human digestive tract that helps to regulate insulin and glucagon. The lizard protein remains effective much longer than the human hormone, helping diabetics keep their blood sugar levels under control. Exenatide slows the <b>emptying</b> <b>of</b> the <b>stomach</b> and causes a decrease in appetite, contributing to weight loss.|$|R
