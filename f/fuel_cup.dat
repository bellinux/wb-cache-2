40|$|The General Electric Reliable and Affordable Controls effort {{under the}} NASA Advanced Subsonic Technology (AST) Program has designed, fabricated, and tested {{advanced}} controls {{hardware and software}} to reduce emissions and improve engine safety and reliability. The original effort consisted of four elements: 1) a Hydraulic Multiplexer; 2) Active Combustor Control; 3) a Variable Displacement Vane Pump (VDVP); and 4) Intelligent Engine Control. The VDVP and Intelligent Engine Control elements were cancelled due to funding constraints and are reported here only to the state they progressed. The Hydraulic Multiplexing element developed and tested a prototype which improves reliability by combining the functionality of up to 16 solenoids and servo-valves into one component with a single electrically powered force motor. The Active Combustor Control element developed intelligent staging and control strategies for low emission combustors. This included development and tests of a Controlled Pressure Fuel Nozzle for fuel sequencing, a Fuel Multiplexer for individual <b>fuel</b> <b>cup</b> metering, and model-based control logic. Both the Hydraulic Multiplexer and Controlled Pressure Fuel Nozzle system were cleared for engine test. The Fuel Multiplexer was cleared for combustor rig test which must be followed by an engine test to achieve full maturation...|$|E
40|$|Fuel samples, 90 UC - 10 ZrC, and {{chemically}} vapor deposited tungsten <b>fuel</b> <b>cups</b> were fabricated for {{the study}} of the long term dimensional stability and compatibility of the carbide-tungsten fuel-cladding systems under irradiation. These fuel samples and <b>fuel</b> <b>cups</b> were assembled into the fuel pins of two capsules, designated as V- 2 E and V- 2 F, for irradiation in NASA Plum Brook Reactor Facility at a fission power density of 172 watts/c. c. and a miximum cladding temperature of 1823 K. Fabrication methods and characteristics of the fuel samples and <b>fuel</b> <b>cups</b> prepared are described...|$|R

50|$|Interstate 90 Business is a {{business}} loop of Interstate 90 in Moorcroft. It runs from diamond interchanges at exit 153 and at exit 154. The route also carries the concurrency with US 14 until it reaches Yellowstone Avenue and US 16 until it reaches the Cenex/Coffee <b>Cup</b> <b>Fuel</b> Stop. The {{western edge of the}} business loop also serves as the eastern terminus of Wyoming Highway 51.|$|R
50|$|Although {{the engine}} formula {{remained}} the same, maximum race lengths {{were reduced to}} 300 kilometres or two hours (whichever came first), {{and the use of}} commercial petrol became compulsory, in place of specialized alcohol-based racing <b>fuels.</b> The International <b>Cup</b> for F1 Manufacturers was awarded for the first time, but Ferrari's Mike Hawthorn won the Drivers' Championship from Stirling Moss, despite the latter having won four of the ten grand prix to Hawthorn's one.|$|R
5|$|Balzac's {{work habits}} are legendary, he wrote from 1 am to 8 am {{every night and}} {{sometimes}} even longer. Balzac could write very rapidly; some of his novels, written with a quill, were composed at a pace equal to thirty words per minute on a modern typewriter. His preferred method was to eat a light meal at five or six in the afternoon, then sleep until midnight. He then rose and wrote for many hours, <b>fueled</b> by innumerable <b>cups</b> of black coffee. He would often work for fifteen hours or more at a stretch; {{he claimed to have}} once worked for 48 hours with only three hours of rest in the middle.|$|R
2500|$|Another seriously {{modified}} Sport {{appeared in}} 1926 when Farman fitted a F 65 with a new, monoplane parasol wing. [...] This rectangular plan wing, with {{a span of}} [...] and a chord of [...] was built out {{a portion of the}} wing of a Goliath airliner. [...] The original Sport centre section struts were retained but new streamlined lift struts, two on each side, took the forces from the high wing to the lower fuselage longerons. [...] Because of the low aspect ratio of its wing (2.6) the new machine acquired the nickname the Flying Postcard. [...] Formally, it remained a Sport. [...] It was designed for, and entered into, the Zenith <b>Cup</b> <b>fuel</b> consumption competition of 1926. Farman did win this Cup, though not with the Sport but with their F.91.|$|R

5000|$|A {{variety of}} {{businesses}} {{have been built}} and operated at the location for many years, including the currently named [...] "Coffee <b>Cup</b> <b>Fuel</b> Stop" [...] (also known as the Maverick Junction Truck Stop). Another long-term business {{is one of the}} locations of Big Bat's, a chain of convenience stores owned and operated by the Pourier family of Pine Ridge, South Dakota, a Franco-Oglala Lakota family. Other businesses are located around the junction, including light industrial operations such as sand and gravel pits, rental storage, and ready-mix operations. The South Dakota Department of Transportation has a maintenance shop at the Junction. A motel and a restaurant (other than the one at the truck stop) were located at the Junction from the 1970s to the mid-1990s when it was partially burned and then demolished. In recent years, the construction of the Heartland Expressway has spurred new businesses to locate at the Junction, including a campground and construction companies.|$|R
