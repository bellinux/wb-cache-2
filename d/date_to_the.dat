5|$|Two {{distinct}} architectural styles <b>date</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> last {{period of}} the site's occupation in the Late Classic. One uses well-carved stone blocks for construction and is possibly earlier than the second style, which is believed to <b>date</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Terminal Classic and uses thin, flat stones.|$|E
5|$|A {{blast furnace}} {{converts}} raw iron ore into pig iron, {{which can be}} remelted in a cupola furnace to produce cast iron. The earliest specimens of cast iron found in China <b>date</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> 5th century BC during the late Spring and Autumn period, yet the oldest discovered blast furnaces <b>date</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> 3rd century BCE and the majority <b>date</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> period after Emperor Wu of Han (r. 141–87 BCE) established a government monopoly over the iron industry in 117 BCE (most of the discovered iron works sites built before this date were merely foundries which recast iron that had been smelt elsewhere). Iron ore smelted in blast furnaces during the Han was rarely if ever cast directly into permanent molds; instead, the pig iron scraps were remelted in the cupola furnace to make cast iron. Cupola furnaces utilized a cold blast traveling through tuyere pipes from the bottom and over the top where the charge of charcoal and pig iron was introduced. The air traveling through the tuyere pipes thus became a hot blast once it reached {{the bottom of the}} furnace.|$|E
5|$|Although the Cylinder clearly post-dates Cyrus the Great's {{conquest of}} Babylon in 539 BC, {{the date of}} its {{creation}} is unclear. It is commonly said to <b>date</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> early part of Cyrus's reign over Babylon, some time after 539 BC. The British Museum puts the Cylinder's date of origin at between 539–530 BC.|$|E
50|$|The {{earliest}} {{parts of}} the church are Medieval in date. The aisles have original doorways <b>dating</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> 13th century. <b>The</b> chancel <b>dates</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> 14th century. <b>The</b> square tower <b>dates</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> 15th century. The church was restored from 1864 to 1866.|$|R

5|$|Archaeological {{evidence}} of Native American settlements dates {{back as far}} as 3000 BC; the Jeffers Petroglyphs site in southwest Minnesota contains carvings thought to <b>date</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Late Archaic Period (3000 BC to 1000 BC). Around 700 BC, burial mounds were first created, and the practice continued until the arrival of Europeans, when 10,000 such mounds dotted the state.|$|E
5|$|Belt hook: The belt hook was a {{fastener}} used in China. Belt hooks <b>date</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> 7th century BC in China, and {{were made with}} bronze, iron, gold, and jade. Texts claim that the belt hook arrived in China from Central Asia during the Warring States period, but archaeological evidence of belt hooks in China predate the Warring States Period.|$|E
5|$|Blast furnace: Although {{cast iron}} tools and weapons {{have been found}} in China dating to the 5th century BC, the {{earliest}} discovered Chinese blast furnaces, which produced pig iron that could be remelted and refined as cast iron in the cupola furnace, <b>date</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> 3rd and 2nd centuries BC, while the vast majority of early blast furnace sites discovered <b>date</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Han Dynasty (202 BC– 220 AD) period immediately following 117 BC with the establishment of state monopolies over the salt and iron industries during the reign of Emperor Wu of Han (r. 141– 87 BC); most ironwork sites discovered dating before 117 BC acted merely as foundries which made castings for iron that had been smelted in blast furnaces elsewhere in remote areas far from population centres.|$|E
50|$|The {{camp was}} {{excavated}} in 1912. Pottery <b>dating</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> second century was found, along with pottery <b>dating</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> late third or early fourth century.|$|R

2500|$|Saint Andrew's church <b>dates</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> early medieval period, {{with much}} of <b>the</b> {{structure}} <b>dating</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> 13th century, with parts of the nave {{as early as the}} 11th or 12th century. The tower was constructed in <b>the</b> 16th/17th century, <b>to</b> a similar design to that found in nearby Aylesby, Wootton and [...] Healing. The structure was restored in the 1880s and 1920.

50|$|Whilst <b>the</b> pillar itself <b>dates</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> 9th century, {{the mound}} {{is thought to}} be {{significantly}} older, possibly prehistoric. Certainly the mound can be <b>dated</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Bronze Age.|$|R

5|$|Others {{are less}} sure: the Olmec-style sculptures may simply imply a common {{iconography}} of {{power on the}} Pacific and Gulf coasts. In any case, Takalik Abaj was certainly a place of importance for Olmecs. The Olmec-style sculptures at Takalik Abaj all <b>date</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Middle Preclassic. Except for Monuments1 and 64, the majority were not found in their original locations.|$|E
5|$|Prior to {{the fires}} of 1996 to 2003, archaeologists had {{surveyed}} approximately {{ninety percent of the}} park. Dense undergrowth and tree cover kept many ancient sites hidden from view, but after the Chapin V, Bircher and Pony fires, 593 previously undiscovered sites were revealed– most of them <b>date</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Basketmaker III and Pueblo I periods. Also uncovered during the fires were extensive water containment features, including 1,189 check dams, 344 terraces, and five reservoirs that <b>date</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Pueblo II and III periods. In February 2008, the Colorado Historical Society decided to invest a part of its $7million budget into a culturally modified trees project in the National Park.|$|E
