Primary teeth start to <b>form</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> development of the embryo between the sixth and eighth weeks, and permanent teeth begin to <b>form</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> twentieth week.

5|$|A radical {{strategy}} for avoiding predators which may otherwise kill {{a large majority}} of the emerging young of a population is to emerge very rarely, at irregular intervals. This strategy is seen in dramatic <b>form</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> periodical cicadas, which emerge at intervals of 13 or 17 years. Predators with a life-cycle of one or a few years are unable to reproduce rapidly enough in response to such an emergence, so predator satiation is a likely evolutionary explanation for the cicadas' unusual life-cycle, though not the only one. Predators may still feast on the emerging cicadas, but are unable to consume more than a fraction of the brief surfeit of prey.|$|E
