5|$|In 2005, the {{diameter}} of Eris {{was measured to be}} , using images from the <b>Hubble</b> <b>Space</b> <b>Telescope</b> (HST). The size of an object is determined from its absolute magnitude (H) and the albedo (the amount of light it reflects). At a distance of 97AU, an object with a diameter of 3,000km would have an angular size of 40milliarcseconds, which is directly measurable with the <b>Hubble</b> <b>Space</b> <b>Telescope.</b> Although resolving such small objects is at the very limit of its capabilities, sophisticated image processing techniques such as deconvolution can be used to measure such angular sizes fairly accurately.|$|E
5|$|In August 2011, NASA {{accepted}} the donation of two space telescopes from the National Reconnaissance Office. Despite being stored unused, the instruments {{are superior to}} the <b>Hubble</b> <b>Space</b> <b>Telescope.</b>|$|E

5|$|Astrometric {{observations}} {{made with}} the <b>Hubble</b> <b>Space</b> <b>Telescope</b> suggest that the outer planet 55 Cancri d is inclined at 53° {{with respect to the}} plane of the sky. The inner planets b and e are inclined at 85°. The inclination of f is unknown.|$|E
5|$|In December 2013, the <b>Hubble</b> <b>Space</b> <b>Telescope</b> {{detected}} {{water vapor}} plumes above the {{south polar region}} of Europa, one of Jupiter's Galilean moons. It is thought that Europa's lineae might be venting this water vapor into space, caused by similar processes also occurring on Enceladus.|$|E
5|$|In February 2016, it was {{announced}} that NASA <b>Hubble</b> <b>Space</b> <b>Telescope</b> had detected hydrogen and helium (and suggestions of hydrogen cyanide), but no water vapor, in the atmosphere of 55Cancrie, the first time the atmosphere of a super-earth exoplanet was analyzed successfully.|$|E

5|$|Atomic {{hydrogen}} {{has also}} been detected in Callisto's atmosphere via recent analysis of 2001 <b>Hubble</b> <b>Space</b> <b>Telescope</b> data. Spectral images taken on 15 and 24 December 2001 were re-examined, revealing a faint signal of scattered light that indicates a hydrogen geocorona. The amount of hydrogen present in Callisto's atmosphere varies depending {{on the stage of}} its orbit.|$|E
5|$|Because of the {{distance}} of Neptune from Earth, its angular diameter only ranges from 2.2 to 2.4arcseconds, {{the smallest of the}} Solar System planets. Its small apparent size makes it challenging to study it visually. Most telescopic data was fairly limited until the advent of the <b>Hubble</b> <b>Space</b> <b>Telescope</b> and large ground-based telescopes with adaptive optics (AO).|$|E
5|$|STS-125 was {{the only}} visit to the <b>Hubble</b> <b>Space</b> <b>Telescope</b> for Atlantis; the {{telescope}} had been previously serviced twice by Discovery and once each by Columbia and Endeavour. The mission was the 30th flight of Space Shuttle Atlantis and also the first by Atlantis in over 14 years not to visit a space station, the last one being STS-66.|$|E

5|$|The <b>Hubble</b> <b>Space</b> <b>Telescope</b> (HST) has {{adequate}} {{angular resolution}} {{to separate the}} light from the moons from that of Haumea.

5|$|The <b>Hubble</b> <b>Space</b> <b>Telescope,</b> which {{cannot be}} pointed {{directly}} at the Sun, used the Moon as a mirror to study the light that had passed through the atmosphere of Venus {{in order to determine}} its composition.

5|$|A {{limitation}} of the radial velocity method used to discover the planet is that only a lower limit on the mass can be obtained. Further astrometric observations with the <b>Hubble</b> <b>Space</b> <b>Telescope</b> on the outer planet 55 Cancri d suggest that planet is inclined at 53° to {{the plane of the}} sky; but innermost b and e are inclined at 85°.
