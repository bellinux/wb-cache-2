Previous numerical results have shown that if the right hand side is smooth then convergence is rapid, with 6 <b>decimal</b> <b>accuracy</b> achievable using 8 – 10 basis elements. Practical problems in aerodynamics dictate that this equation be solved for discontinuous data.

The use of distributed generation, the connection of non-linear loads and the presence of some unexpected system faults are the main causes of frequency variations. In addition, power quality includes frequency as a most important index. This paper deals with digital measurement of power frequency i. e. 50 Hz using microcontroller based system.

40|$|Lookback {{option is}} a {{well-known}} path-dependent option where its payoff depends on the historical extremum prices. The thesis focuses on the binomial pricing of the American floating strike lookback put options with payoff at time t (if exercise) characterized by _k= 0, [...] ., t S_k - S_t, where S_t denotes {{the price of the}} underlying stock at time t. Build upon the idea of RBCVReiner Babbs Cheuk and Vorst (RBCV, 1992) who proposed a transformed binomial lattice model for efficient pricing of this class of option, this thesis extends and enhances their binomial recursive algorithm by exploiting the additional combinatorial properties of the lattice structure. The proposed algorithm is not only computational efficient but it also significantly reduces the memory constraint. As a result, the proposed algorithm is more than 1000 times faster than the original RBCV algorithm and it can compute a binomial lattice with one million time steps in less than two seconds. This algorithm enables us to extrapolate the limiting (American) option value up to 4 or 5 <b>decimal</b> <b>accuracy</b> in real time...|$|E

These equations set logical patterns and can be explained in terms of easy to understand three dimensional geometric pictures.

Additionally, the charge of the leptons, e = 1. 602, 177, 33 (10 − 19) C, can now be understood as arising from the curvature of certain energy structures for these particles, when formulated in terms of vectors.
