25|$|In 1876 the Declaration of Independence was {{displayed}} at the Centennial Exhibition in Philadelphia. On March 3, 1877, it was returned to the library where it was kept on view until 1894 when it was <b>hermetically</b> <b>sealed</b> in a locked steel cabinet in the library along with the original signed copy of the Constitution. The documents were not shown to anyone without {{the approval of the}} Secretary of State.|$|E
25|$|A further {{impediment}} to {{reliability of the}} early devices was the diffusion of water vapour from the body fluids through the epoxy resin encapsulation affecting the electronic circuitry. This phenomenon was overcome by encasing the pacemaker generator in a <b>hermetically</b> <b>sealed</b> metal case, initially by Telectronics of Australia in 1969 followed by Cardiac Pacemakers Inc of Minneapolis in 1972. This technology, using titanium as the encasing metal, became the standard by the mid-1970s.|$|E
50|$|In {{parts of}} sub-Saharan Africa markets sell used plastic {{containers}} {{that can be}} used for hermetic storage. One needs to make sure the containers can <b>hermetically</b> <b>seal</b> or the containers will only provide a minimal protection to the grain inside.|$|R
50|$|Pyrite {{oxidation}} {{is sufficiently}} exothermic that underground coal mines in high-sulfur coal seams have occasionally had {{serious problems with}} spontaneous combustion in the mined-out areas of the mine.

50|$|In the Sauerbruch chamber the patient's head is elided, {{sticking}} out of the glass-chamber. The surgical team works inside the chamber that <b>hermetically</b> <b>seals</b> the body of the patient. To start the operation on the thorax a vacuum of 1/10 Bar is generated in the chamber, preventing the patient's lungs from collapsing upon opening the thorax.|$|R
25|$|For x-ray, {{gamma ray}} and {{electron}} irradiation, shielding is required when the foods are being irradiated. This {{is done to}} protect workers and the environment outside of the chamber from radiation exposure. Typically permanent or movable shields are used. In some gamma irradiators the radioactive source is under water at all times, and the <b>hermetically</b> <b>sealed</b> product is lowered into the water. The water acts as the shield in this application. Because of the lower penetration depth of electron irradiation, treatment to entire industrial pallets or totes is not possible.|$|E
25|$|In 1872, Russian Alexander Lodygin invented an {{incandescent}} light bulb and obtained a Russian patent in 1874. He used as a burner two carbon rods of diminished section in a glass receiver, <b>hermetically</b> <b>sealed,</b> and filled with nitrogen, electrically arranged so that the current could be passed to the second carbon when the first had been consumed. Later {{he lived in the}} US, changed his name to Alexander de Lodyguine and applied and obtained patents for incandescent lamps having chromium, iridium, rhodium, ruthenium, osmium, molybdenum and tungsten filaments, and a bulb using a molybdenum filament was demonstrated at the world fair of 1900 in Paris.|$|E
25|$|This {{trade-off}} {{does not}} apply to vacuum insulated glass (VIG), or evacuated glazing, as heat loss due to convection is eliminated, leaving radiation losses and conduction through the edge seal. These VIG units have most of the air removed from the space between the panes, leaving a nearly-complete vacuum. VIG units which are currently on the market are <b>hermetically</b> <b>sealed</b> along their perimeter with solder glass, that is, a glass frit having a reduced melting point. Such a glass seal is rigid, and will experience increasing stress with increasing temperature differential across the unit. This stress may prevent vacuum glazing from being used when the temperature differential is too great. One manufacturer provides a recommendation of 35°C.|$|E

The key requirements and the design innovations implemented to meet them are described...|$|R
30|$|Elsewhere {{there has}} been {{significant}} work {{on the use of}} surface treatments to stabilise the temporal stability of the electron emission [205, 226]. As discussed previously, such low work function adlayers do indeed increase the emission current density, though they also, depending on the adlayer material and means of deposition, <b>hermetically</b> <b>seal</b> the CNTs – which act as a high aspect support structure – thereby increasing the emitters stability [225].|$|R
2500|$|Although low to {{moderate}} air flow {{is important for}} producing a good-quality aged raw pu'er, it is generally agreed by most collectors and connoisseurs that raw pu'er tea cakes older than 30 years should not be further exposed to [...] "open" [...] air since it {{would result in the}} loss of flavors or degradation in mouthfeel. The tea should instead be preserved by wrapping or <b>hermetically</b> <b>sealing</b> it in plastic wrapping or ideally glass.|$|R
25|$|The Space Pen, {{also known}} as the Zero Gravity Pen, is a pen that uses {{pressurized}} ink cartridges and is claimed to write in zero gravity, upside down, underwater, over wet and greasy paper, at any angle, and in extreme temperature ranges. The ballpoint is made from tungsten carbide and is precisely fitted in order to avoid leaks. A sliding float separates the ink from the pressurized gas. The thixotropic ink in the <b>hermetically</b> <b>sealed</b> and pressurized reservoir is claimed to write for three times longer than a standard ballpoint pen. In 1965, the space pen was invented and patented by Paul C. Fisher. After two years of testing at NASA, the space pen was first used during the Apollo 7 mission in 1968.|$|E
25|$|Supercapacitors are {{constructed}} with two metal foils (current collectors), each coated with an electrode material such as activated carbon, which {{serve as the}} power connection between the electrode material and the external terminals of the capacitor. Specifically to the electrode material {{is a very large}} surface area. In this example the activated carbon is electrochemically etched, so that the surface of the material is about a factor 100,000 larger than the smooth surface. The electrodes are kept apart by an ion-permeable membrane (separator) used as an insulator to protect the electrodes against short circuits. This construction is subsequently rolled or folded into a cylindrical or rectangular shape and can be stacked in an aluminum can or an adaptable rectangular housing. Then the cell is impregnated with a liquid or viscous electrolyte of organic or aqueous type. The electrolyte, an ionic conductor, enters the pores of the electrodes and serves as the conductive connection between the electrodes across the separator. Finally the housing is <b>hermetically</b> <b>sealed</b> to ensure stable behavior over the specified lifetime.|$|E

50|$|In Tuscany, the mezzadria peasants were {{involved}} in wine production, {{but most of the}} wine produced went to the landlord. As they were left with little to drink, they would make a kind of wine by mixing the stems, seeds, and pomace left over from the wine production with large quantities of water, bringing it to a boil, <b>hermetically</b> <b>sealing</b> it in a terracotta vase, and letting it ferment for several days. This resulted in a slightly effervescent drink, which was consumed as it was.|$|R
50|$|All {{cranberry}} juice products {{are required to}} be packed in aseptic, <b>hermetically</b> <b>seal</b> containers (plastic bottles, cans, cartons) in accordance with good manufacturing practices of their country. The typical container size used are 11.5 or 64 fluid ounce, and each must be filled with the product by at least 90 percent. Cranberry juice products should also not be packaged more than 90 days prior to their delivery, unless specified in the order. Ocean Spray and Fruit d'Or {{cranberry juice}} products have a frozen shelf life of 24 months and 36 months, respectively.|$|R
500|$|Two days later, Nebe and Widmann {{carried out}} another killing experiment: five {{psychiatric}} patients from Mogilev {{were placed in}} a <b>hermetically</b> <b>sealed</b> room, with pipes leading to the outside. At first, exhausts from a passenger vehicle were vented into the room, so that the carbon monoxide would kill those inside. However, this method failed to kill the patients, so a truck was added; the patients were dead within 15 minutes. Nebe and Widmann concluded, that killing with explosives was impractical, while gassing [...] "held promise", as vehicles were readily available, and {{could be used as}} needed.|$|E
500|$|After {{delivering}} Cavador to Viktoria, Garrett steals a Servant mask {{to learn}} about a Mechanist technology called a [...] "Cultivator". Meanwhile, Karras hides inside the Mechanist cathedral in preparation for his plan. Garrett and Viktoria learn {{that it is the}} Cultivators inside Servant masks which emit red vapor, or [...] "rust gas". Karras had provided Servants to nobles with gardens in order to set off an apocalyptic chain reaction. Viktoria plans to lure the Servants into the <b>hermetically</b> <b>sealed</b> Mechanist cathedral before Karras activates their masks, but Garrett believes this to be too dangerous and leaves. Viktoria goes to the cathedral alone and dies while filling it with plants, and Garrett completes her plan, killing Karras in the rust gas. Afterward, Garrett is approached by a Keeper who explains that Karras' scheme and Viktoria's death had been prophesied. Garrett demands to know the rest of the Keepers' prophecies as the game ends.|$|E

Harvey's books, explaining 20th-century civilization, as well as a world globe, a bible, encyclopedias, and newspapers, were to be placed inside two vaults and <b>hermetically</b> <b>sealed</b> in glass. Harvey also wanted to place in this large room: [...] "numerous small items now used in domestic and industrial life, from the size of a needle and safety pin up to a Victrola." [...] It was estimated that the construction would use 16,000 bags of cement, 30,000ft³ (850m³) of sand, 58,000ft³ (1,642m³) of gravel, and tons of corrugated steel reinforcement. The Portland Cement Association donated the service of one of its experts, who pronounced that the Pyramid would not deteriorate or suffer from erosion and would last for over a million years. To prevent water in the valley from interfering with the foundation and to shore up the low knoll to support the heavy Pyramid, Harvey constructed a [...] long retaining wall of stone and concrete.|$|E
50|$|The 1985-1987 upgrade of the {{detector}} {{was aimed at}} two aspects: full calorimeter coverage and better electron identification at lower transverse momenta. The first aspect was addressed by replacing the end-caps with new calorimeters that covered the regions 6°-40° {{with respect to the}} beam direction, thereby <b>hermetically</b> <b>sealing</b> {{the detector}}. The end-cap calorimeters consisted of lead/scintillator samplings for the electromagnetic part, and iron/scintillator for the hadronic part. The performance and granularity of the new calorimeters were set to match the central calorimeter, which was of importance for the triggering system.|$|R
