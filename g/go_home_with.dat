25|$|During {{this time}} Johnson {{established}} {{what would be}} a relatively long-term relationship with Estella Coleman, a woman about 15 years his senior and the mother of the blues musician Robert Lockwood, Jr. Johnson reportedly cultivated a woman to look after him in each town he played in. He reputedly asked homely young women living in the country with their families whether he could <b>go</b> <b>home</b> <b>with</b> them, and in most cases he was accepted, until a boyfriend arrived or Johnson was ready to move on.|$|E
25|$|Just {{before their}} vows are exchanged, Robin's water breaks {{and she goes}} into labor. After having a {{complicated}} delivery, Robin delivers their daughter, Emma Grace Scorpio Drake. While there is an HIV scare involving a nick on baby Emma's ear, her tests come back negative. As soon as they receive the good news, Robin falls into a coma and is diagnosed with Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). Robin regains consciousness {{a couple of days}} later to see Patrick holding Emma on the foot of the hospital bed. After she regains consciousness, Anna convinces her to keep fighting because Emma needs her mother. Robin & Patrick <b>go</b> <b>home</b> <b>with</b> the baby after she recovers. Once they get home, Robin becomes depressed believing Emma only cries with her. On Thanksgiving, Robin and Patrick set another wedding date for just after Christmas, not wanting their wedding to interfere with their daughter's first Christmas.|$|E
25|$|By this time, referee J. C. Louderback and his officiating {{crew had}} {{realized}} their mistake, and conferred for nearly 20 minutes to decide their course of action. During the delay, {{radio and television}} announcers also noticed that Colorado had scored {{with the help of}} an additional play. Louderback was shown on the phone. After a lengthy consultation, the referees announced their decision: the touchdown counted, giving Colorado a 33-31 lead. They also decided that the Buffs would have to attempt the extra point. The rules do not require the extra point try if time has expired and the result will not affect the outcome of the game. However, since Colorado only led by two, Missouri could have potentially blocked the try and returned it for two points to tie the game, the try was required. Not wanting to take this chance, Johnson took the snap and went to a knee, allowing the Buffaloes to <b>go</b> <b>home</b> <b>with</b> a controversial win.|$|E

25|$|Thirty-five {{men were}} sent from Ranger to Drake {{to take charge}} and assess the damage; and {{the next three days}} were spent making repairs, while moving slowly north-westward between Ireland and Scotland. A cargo brig which came too close was captured, and used as extra accommodations. On the other hand, six Irish {{fisherman}} who had been captured on the first Carrickfergus expedition were allowed, along with three sick Irish sailors, to take a boat and <b>go</b> <b>home,</b> <b>with</b> a present of sails from Drake, and some money from Jones. On their return they reported the concern Jones was showing for Lieut. Dobbs, who remained gravely ill. Meanwhile, the Royal Navy had sent out some proper warships in pursuit. Despite Drake lameness, they never {{caught a glimpse of the}} slowly escaping Americans. The only real trouble Jones had was with his Lieutenant, Thomas Simpson, who had command of the Drake and at one point on the voyage sailed out of sight.|$|E
25|$|Alfie throws Kat {{out of the}} pub and Derek persuades her to <b>go</b> <b>home</b> <b>with</b> him, {{believing they}} can stay a couple but she insists she loves Alfie. Kat discovers that Derek has saved all her {{messages}} and is determined to play Alfie the last voicemail she left, in which she told Derek to leave her alone. Derek persuades her to let him do it, but he plays a different message and claims Kat has been pursuing him. Alfie punches Derek and gives him his wedding ring. Derek then tells Kat that Alfie is not interested and hands her the ring. On Christmas Day, Alfie tells Kat that he has moved on from her. Kat attends a Branning family dinner with Derek. She discovers Derek played Alfie the wrong message and has now deleted them all, so slaps him. Derek has a huge argument with Max and Jack and they force {{him out of the}} house with the help of Derek's son Joey Branning (David Witts), while Kat watches on. He then suffers a heart attack on the street as everyone walks away, and dies. Kat and Alfie eventually divorce but reunite when his new wife, Roxy, realises he still loves Kat.|$|E
25|$|On February 4, Real Madrid {{started the}} month with a 0–1 away win over Getafe. The lone goal, a header, was scored by Sergio Ramos {{in the first}} half. On February 12, Madrid {{extended}} their lead in La Liga to ten points after winning 4–2 at home to Levante, while Barcelona had lost the day before to Osasuna in Pamplona. Levante opened the scoring with a header from Gustavo Cabral. The turning point came after a red card to Vicente Iborra, giving away a penalty which was scored by Cristiano Ronaldo. Ronaldo then added two more goals, including a sumptuous third, before Levante pulled another back through Arouna Koné. Karim Benzema then curled home a fourth for Real to finish the scoring. On February 18, Real Madrid continued their good form in La Liga by beating Racing de Santander at the Bernabéu 4–0. Benzema netted a brace and Ronaldo and Ángel Di María each scored one goal in the comfortable win. Racing played {{over half of the}} game with only ten men after Domingo Cisma received a second yellow card for his second handball of the game and was sent off. On February 21, Real Madrid drew 1–1 with CSKA Moscow {{in the first part of}} their Round of 16 games in Champions League. The game, played in snowy conditions in Moscow, was led by Madrid for the majority of the game with a goal from Ronaldo, but a last-minute equalizer by Pontus Wernbloom denied the victory for the visitors. On February 26, Real Madrid defeated city rival Rayo Vallecano at the Campo de Fútbol de Vallecas by a score of 0–1. The only goal of the game, a back-heel effort by Cristiano Ronaldo, was eventually enough for the visitors to <b>go</b> <b>home</b> <b>with</b> the three points in their pocket.|$|E

500|$|If Judge Landis was {{suspicious}} of an attorney's line of questioning, he {{would begin to}} wrinkle his nose, and once told a witness, [...] "Now let's stop fooling around and tell exactly what did happen, without reciting your life's history." [...] When an elderly defendant {{told him that he}} would not be able to live to complete a five-year sentence, Landis scowled at him and asked, [...] "Well, you can try, can't you?" [...] When a young man stood before him for sentencing after admitting to stealing jewels from a parcel, the defendant's wife stood near him, infant daughter in her arms, and Landis mused what to do about the situation. After a dramatic pause, Landis ordered the young man to take his wife and daughter and <b>go</b> <b>home</b> <b>with</b> them, expressing his unwillingness to have the girl be the daughter of a convict. According to sportswriter Ed Fitzgerald in SPORT magazine, [...] "omen wept unashamed and the entire courtroom burst into spontaneous, prolonged applause." ...|$|E
500|$|The series {{then changed}} to two episodes, each of thirty minutes on Tuesdays and Thursdays, per week in 1988 (from July 1988 onwards, the series also began being {{broadcast}} {{all year round}} without a summer break), increasing to three a week beginning in 1993, with the third episode being broadcast on Fridays. In 1998, The Bill returned to hour-long episodes, which later became twice-weekly, with the Friday episode being dropped, {{at which point the}} series adopted a much more serialised approach. When Paul Marquess took over as executive producer in 2002, as part of a drive for ratings, the series was revamped, bringing in a more soap opera type feel to many of its stories. Many veteran characters were written out, leading to the Sun Hill fire during 2002. Marquess stated that the clearout was necessary to introduce [...] "plausible, powerful new characters". As part of the new serial format, much more of the characters' personal lives were explored, however, as Marquess put it, the viewers still [...] "don't <b>go</b> <b>home</b> <b>with</b> them". The change also allowed The Bill to become more reflective of modern policing with the introduction of officers from ethnic minorities, most notably the new superintendent, Adam Okaro. It also allowed coverage of the relationship of homosexual Sergeant Craig Gilmore and PC Luke Ashton, a storyline which Marquess was determined to explore before rival Merseybeat.|$|E

2500|$|At sixteen Clairmont was a lively, voluptuous brunette {{with a good}} {{singing voice}} and a hunger for recognition. Her home life had become {{increasingly}} tense as her stepfather William Godwin sank deeper into debt and her mother's relations with Godwin's daughter Mary became more strained. Clairmont aided her stepsister's clandestine meetings with Percy Bysshe Shelley, who had professed a belief in free love and soon left his own wife and two small children to be with Mary. When Mary ran away with Shelley in July 1814, Clairmont went with them. Clairmont's mother traced the group to an inn in Calais but couldn't make Clairmont <b>go</b> <b>home</b> <b>with</b> her. Godwin needed the financial assistance that the aristocratic Shelley could provide.|$|E
2500|$|There were {{numerous}} famous watering {{holes in the}} area contributing to the nightlife, including the Corner Grocery Bar, Toad Hall, the Pendulum, the Midnight Sun, Twin Peaks, and the Elephant Walk. A typical daytime street scene of the period is perhaps best illustrated by mentioning the male belly dancers who could be found holding forth in good weather {{at the corner of}} 18th and Castro on [...] "Hibernia Beach", in front of the financial institution from which it drew its name. Then at night, after the bars closed at 2 AM, the men remaining at that hour often would line up along the sidewalk of 18th Street to indicate that they were still available to <b>go</b> <b>home</b> <b>with</b> someone (aka The Meat Rack).|$|E
2500|$|D'Arcy {{asked him}} to explain {{the format of the}} show, saying: [...] "The key to a good format is you can explain it in one or two sentences.

[...] Tarrant replied with: [...] "The Colour of Money[...] [...] [...] [...]there are 20 cash machines, all with different amounts in them ranging up to a total of more than £25,000. You choose 10 colours and they have different amounts in them. If all 10 add up to the total of money you want, then you win. If the money is not enough, then you lose out and there's no in between. It's either £80,000 or £90,000 or whatever, or you <b>go</b> <b>home</b> <b>with</b> el zippo."

2500|$|A {{final twist}} in Steven's story was his {{involvement}} in a seemingly unrelated plotline that had been running simultaneously to Steven's personal dilemma, the disappearance of his half sister Lucy (Melissa Suffield). In episodes that aired in May 2008, {{it was revealed that}} Steven had been hiding his runaway sister in a caravan, poisoning her mind against Ian and persuading her to flee the country. Explaining his character's motives, Sidwell said, [...] "It’s all about Ian again. Steven wants all Ian’s love and attention and he feels Lucy is getting in the way. She’s the one who gets most of Ian’s time and energy and he thinks getting her out of the picture will leave Ian all for him [...] He’s been brainwashing her into thinking Ian doesn’t care if she never goes home again [...] His real plan is to keep her out of Ian’s life for good [...] He craves Ian’s full attention and is willing {{to do whatever it takes}} to make that happen. He doesn’t exactly plan to be evil but he is dangerous." [...] In the end Steven's plan was discovered by his grandmother Pat, leading Steven to attempt to suffocate her to death before she revealed the truth to Ian. An EastEnders source told Digital Spy: [...] "Steven hits rock bottom when Pat finds out that he's been hiding Lucy for all these weeks while his family have been frantically searching for her [...] when Pat realises that Steven knows where Lucy is, he takes drastic steps to prevent his beloved nan from revealing all to Ian. He goes from confused to psycho in a matter of minutes, grabbing a pillow and pushing it onto her face." [...] Sidwell added, [...] "Steven is deadly! He is willing to do whatever it takes to get what he wants [...] including murder." [...] The murder attempt was stopped by Ian, and after discovering the truth from Pat, Ian chased Steven to London's St. Pancras Station (where he was intending to put Lucy on the Eurostar to Paris) and convinced Lucy to return home. Sidwell commented, [...] "Steven is such a good manipulator he thinks Lucy will side with him. He’s shocked when she doesn’t and when she agrees to <b>go</b> <b>home</b> <b>with</b> Ian." [...] In Steven's final scenes, Ian rejects Steven as his son once again, telling him [...] "I never give up on my family. But you're not my family, are you? You're your mother's son and you're Simon's son, and that really used to hurt. Now I thank God I never produced anything as sick and twisted as you." [...] Steven then departed from Walford after Ian vowed to kill him if he ever saw him again.|$|E
