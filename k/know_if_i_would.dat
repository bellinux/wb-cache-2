On August 30, 2016, when appearing on Good Morning America, {{he said that he}} was unsure if he would claim the incident, which fulfills the requirements of [...] "armed robbery" [...] under Brazilian law, as a robbery saying [...] "I don't <b>know</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> consider it as a robbery, or extortion, or us just paying up for the poster being ripped." ...|$|E
500|$|Ram Charan {{decided not}} to debut in Bollywood with Magadheeras Hindi remake, as he {{believed}} the film might not be recreated well. In an interview with The Times of India, Charan said, [...] "When I met Anil Kapoor some time back, he told me I will ask Boney Kapoor to remake Magadheera with you in Hindi. But I said I don't <b>know</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> {{want to do the}} remake. Magadheera is a lovely film which can't be recreated." [...] The film was remade in Bengali as [...] in 2014; it was directed by Raj Chakraborty with Dev and Mimi Chakraborty playing the lead roles. The 2014 Kannada film Brahma, according to its director R. Chandru, was inspired by Magadheera but was not a remake.|$|E
500|$|Tim Burton {{first saw}} Stephen Sondheim's 1979 stage musical, , as a CalArts student in London in 1980. Burton {{recalled}} his experience {{of seeing the}} show, saying, [...] "I was still a student, I didn't <b>know</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> be making movies or working in a restaurant, I {{had no idea what}} I would be doing. I just wandered into the theatre and it just blew me away because I'd never really seen anything that had the mixture of all those elements. I actually went three nights in a row because I loved it so much." [...] Although not a fan of the musical genre, Burton was struck by how cinematic the musical was, and repeatedly attended subsequent performances. He described it as a silent film with music, and was [...] "dazzled both by the music and its sense of the macabre." [...] When his directing career took off in the late 1980s, Burton approached Sondheim with a view to making a cinematic adaptation, but nothing came of it. In Sondheim's words, [...] " [...] went off and did other things." ...|$|E

In 2000, following John Bercow MP's resignation from the front bench and the defection of Shaun Woodward MP to Labour, Massow too left the Conservative Party to join the Labour Party, where he was welcomed by Mo Mowlam. However Massow later returned to the Conservatives, subsequently claiming that the brief defection to Labour had a particular motivation: [...] "I <b>knew</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> switched it <b>would</b> be front page news. <b>I</b> thought it <b>would</b> help the party focus on repealing Section 28. I had one meeting with Labour, that's all. I {{never wanted to be}} a candidate." ...|$|R
500|$|In a {{surprising}} choice, former Maryland assistant coach and Citadel head coach Bobby Ross, {{who was not}} a big name at the time, was selected as head coach in 1982. In contrast to Claiborne's style, Ross implemented a high-powered offense. He replaced the I-veer triple option with an NFL-style offense that emphasized dropback passes, bootlegs, and play action passes. This change in tactics and strategy enabled starting quarterback Boomer Esiason the opportunity to excel to a degree not seen under Claiborne the season prior. Esiason said, [...] "Ross has an uncanny knack of putting players in a position to not only succeed, but to overachieve [...] [...] [...] If he didn't show up at Maryland, I don't know what would have happened to me. I don't <b>know</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> have turned into the player I was and played in the NFL." [...] In the following years, several Maryland quarterbacks went on to careers in the National Football League (NFL), and the school was nicknamed [...] "Quarterback U" [...] as a result.|$|E
500|$|Sobers {{told the}} media that he had played in Rhodesia as he felt {{it would be good}} for cricket, {{particularly}} after the cancellation of the South African tour of England, and that politics had not entered his mind. He told interviewers that he had had no problems whatsoever in Rhodesia, that sport in Rhodesia appeared to him to be integrated and that he intended to accept Smith's invitation to return there in the future to play more cricket. Reporting Bacher's suggestion of playing in South Africa, Sobers said that he probably would not do so: [...] "I don't <b>know</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> want to get involved in that," [...] he said, [...] "but it does show that South African cricketers are willing to play with and against players of any colour, race or creed." [...] Sobers said that the white South African members of the Rest of the World squad in England had functioned well as part of the multiracial team, and that he hoped for a similar Rest of the World series in the Caribbean as he believed West Indian cricket fans would enjoy seeing the South African players. He expressed confusion regarding the calls for him to be stripped of his captaincy. [...] "I am a professional cricketer and a sportsman, not a politician," [...] he said. [...] "I went to play cricket. I don't see why this should affect my position as captain of the West Indies team." ...|$|E
500|$|Some {{have speculated}} that Clark's {{inexperience}} at giving [...] "soundbite" [...] answers hurt him in the media during his primary campaign. The day after he launched his campaign, for example, {{he was asked if}} he would have voted for the Iraq War Resolution, which granted President Bush the power to wage the Iraq War, a large issue in the 2004 campaign. Clark said, [...] "At the time, I probably would have voted for it, but I think that's too simple a question," [...] then [...] "I don't <b>know</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> have or not. I've said it both ways because when you get into this, what happens is you have to put yourself in a position—on balance, I probably would have voted for it." [...] Finally, Clark's press secretary clarified his position as [...] "you said you would have voted for the resolution as leverage for a UN-based solution." [...] After this series of responses, although Clark opposed the war, The New York Times ran a story with the headline [...] "Clark Says He Would Have Voted for War". Clark was repeatedly portrayed as unsure on this critical issue by his opponents throughout the primary season. He was forced to continue to clarify his position and at the second primary debate he said, [...] "I think it's really embarrassing that a group of candidates up here are working on changing the leadership in this country and can't get their own story straight... I would have never voted for war. The war was an unnecessary war, it was an elective war, and it's been a huge strategic mistake for this country." ...|$|E

An astronomer is never laughed at for readin' his books o' geometry an' suchlike day an' night--even to the injury of his health--but what is an astronomer's business to him compared with the concerns of my soul to me?

Now, lads, if these things that so many millions believe in, and that you all profess to believe in, are lies, then you may well {{laugh at me}} for enquirin' into them; but if they be true, why, I think the devils themselves must be laughing at you for not enquirin' into them!" ...|$|R

The eleven men were shot at very close range with automatic rifles, which included Armalites, an M1 carbine and an M1 Garand. A total of 136 rounds were fired {{in less than a}} minute. The men were shot at waist-height and fell to the ground; some fell on top of each other, either dead or wounded. When the initial burst of gunfire stopped, the gunmen re-loaded their weapons. The order was given to [...] "Finish them off", and another burst of gunfire was fired into the heaped bodies of the workmen. One of the gunmen also walked amongst the dying men and shot them each {{in the head with a}} pistol as they lay on the ground. Ten of them died at the scene: John Bryans (46), Robert Chambers (19), Reginald Chapman (25), Walter Chapman (23), Robert Freeburn (50), Joseph Lemmon (46), John McConville (20), James McWhirter (58), Robert Walker (46) and Kenneth Worton (24). Alan Black (then 32) was the only one who survived. He had been shot eighteen times and one of the bullets had grazed his head.

Of his summer house and studio, Murtić said [...] "It is really nice here, I enjoy the silence and concentration that is irreplaceable...
