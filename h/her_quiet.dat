5|$|Dilbeck's {{personal}} interest in Erin persists, and she is invited to perform privately for him. He asks her to become his lover and later his wife, despite his staff's concerns that she knows too much. A debate occurs as to whether to kill Erin or simply keep <b>her</b> <b>quiet</b> by threatening to take away her daughter. However, Erin and a police officer Al Garcia (Armand Assante) begin to suspect the congressman's guilt in the murders, and Erin concocts a plan to bring the congressman to justice. She tricks him into confessing on tape, and he is soon after arrested. Thus, Erin regains full custody of Angela, quits stripping, and gets back her job in the FBI. Darrell returns to prison after he is convicted of his crimes.|$|E
25|$|Her {{religion}} prevented {{her from}} being crowned, as Roman Catholics {{were forbidden to}} take part in Anglican services. She initially faced hardships due to the language barrier, the king's infidelities and the political conflicts between Roman Catholics and Anglicans. Over time, <b>her</b> <b>quiet</b> decorum, loyalty and genuine affection for Charles changed the public's perception of her.|$|E

All prepare to leave, but Jamie stays behind after hearing the noise of a phone ringing. As he walks back, he discovers Rosie. Jamie questions Rosie, who insists she did not hear anything.

Rosie starts screaming, but Jamie punches her to keep <b>her</b> <b>quiet,</b> knocking her unconscious.|$|E

25|$|Marie Louise's son William married Anne, Princess Royal, eldest {{daughter}} of George II of Great Britain, on 25 March 1734 at St. James' Palace in London. Upon {{return of the}} wedding party to the Netherlands, William had written his mother, warning her that Anne was allowed precedence over Marie Louise because she was his wife and a king's daughter. This warning was hardly needed, as Marie Louise had eagerly exited Prinsenhof as soon as her son came of age, opting {{to live in an}} elegant but unpretentious house in Harlingen. She had long displayed her disinterest in royal technicalities and the royal lifestyle. She welcomed her son and his new wife upon their arrival, but then returned to <b>her</b> <b>quiet</b> house, taking no part in their ceremonious entry.|$|E
25|$|Anne {{obtained}} a second post as governess {{to the children}} of the Reverend Edmund Robinson and his wife Lydia, at Thorp Green Hall, a comfortable country house near York. Anne was employed at Thorp Green Hall from 1840 to 1845. The house appeared as Horton Lodge in her novel Agnes Grey. Anne had four pupils: Lydia, aged 15, Elizabeth, aged 13, Mary, aged 12, and Edmund, aged 8. Initially, she encountered similar problems as she had experienced at Blake Hall. Anne missed her home and family, commenting in a diary paper in 1841 that she did not like her situation and wished to leave it. <b>Her</b> <b>quiet,</b> gentle disposition did not help. However, despite her outwardly placid appearance, Anne was determined and with experience, made a success of her position, becoming well liked by her employers. Her charges, the Robinson girls, became lifelong friends.|$|E
25|$|Researchers {{concluded}} that, if Genie vocalized or {{made any}} other noise, her father beat {{her with a}} large plank he kept in her room. To keep <b>her</b> <b>quiet</b> he bared his teeth and barked and growled at her like a wild dog, and grew his fingernails out to scratch her. If he suspected her of doing something {{he did not like}} he made these noises outside the door, and beat her if he believed she had continued to do it, instilling an intense and persistent fear of cats and dogs in Genie. No one definitively discerned the exact reason for his dog-like behavior, although at least one scientist speculated he may have viewed himself as a guard dog and was acting out the role. As a result, Genie learned to make as little sound as possible and to otherwise give no outward expressions. Genie developed a tendency to masturbate in socially inappropriate contexts, which led doctors to seriously consider the possibility that Genie's father subjected her to sexual abuse or forced her brother to do so, although they never uncovered any definite evidence.|$|E

Her Persona is Lucia. Noto stated that the film brings with it the theme of comradery amongst friends working together for a common cause and cited the battle scenes as being [...] "powerful". Noto was also interested in the interaction between Fuka and Natsuki although she did not elaborate further on this.|$|E
500|$|Sarah Conlon won huge admiration in Ireland for <b>her</b> <b>quiet</b> {{dignity and}} refusal to feel bitterness. During {{the years that}} her husband and son were in jail, she sent weekly parcels of cigarettes, sweets, and Irish {{newspaper}} clippings to them, and saved up her prison visits for the two weeks of her annual holiday. Her regular letters to them always ended the same way: [...] "Pray for them ones who told lies against you... It's them who needs help as well as yourself." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{attempts}} of Mary Shelley's son and daughter-in-law to [...] "Victorianise" [...] her memory by censoring biographical documents {{contributed to a}} perception of Mary Shelley as a more conventional, less reformist figure than her works suggest. Her own timid omissions from Percy Shelley's works and <b>her</b> <b>quiet</b> avoidance of public controversy in her later years added to this impression. Commentary by Hogg, Trelawny, and other admirers of Percy Shelley also tended to downplay Mary Shelley's radicalism. Trelawny's Records of Shelley, Byron, and the Author (1878) praised Percy Shelley {{at the expense of}} Mary, questioning her intelligence and even her authorship of Frankenstein. Lady Shelley, Percy Florence's wife, responded in part by presenting a severely edited collection of letters she had inherited, published privately as Shelley and Mary in 1882.|$|E

500|$|In 1964, de Havilland {{appeared}} {{in her last}} two leading roles in feature filmsboth psychological thrillers. In Walter Grauman's Lady in a Cage, she played a wealthy poet who gets trapped in her mansion's elevator and faces the threat of three terrorizing hooligans in her own home. Critics responded negatively to the graphic violence and cruelty shown on screen. A.H. Weiler of The New York Times called it a [...] "sordid, if suspenseful, exercise in aimless brutality". That same year, deHavilland {{appeared in}} Robert Aldrich's Hush… Hush, Sweet Charlotte with her close friend Bette Davis. After Joan Crawford left the picture due to illness, Davis had Aldrich fly to Switzerland to persuade a reluctant deHavilland to accept the role of Miriam Deering, a cruel, conniving character hidden behind the charming façade of a polite and cultured lady. <b>Her</b> <b>quiet,</b> restrained performance provided a counterbalance to Davis. Film historian Tony Thomas described her performance as [...] "a subtle piece of acting" [...] that was [...] "a vital contribution {{to the effectiveness of}} the film". The film was well received and earned seven Academy Award nominations.|$|E
2500|$|She {{starred in}} the {{independent}} drama In America, directed by Jim Sheridan and released in 2003. The film, about an immigrant Irish family's struggle {{to start a new}} life in New York, saw her play Sarah Sullivan, the mother. In America met widespread critical acclaim, with Terry Lawson of Detroit Free Press calling the film [...] "an achingly intimate and beautifully observed account of the immigrant experience". Roger Ebert felt that Morton [...] "reveals the power of her silences, <b>her</b> <b>quiet</b> [...] her presence", while A.O. Scott, of The New York Times, found the [...] "blunt, inarticulate force of her feeling [...] at the center of the drama". Her performance earned her nominations for the Academy Award, the Independent Spirit Award, and the Broadcast Film Critics Association Award in the category of Best Actress.|$|E
2500|$|In 1852 Helen Macfarlane married Francis Proust and in 1853 {{gave birth}} to a {{daughter}} who they named Consuela Pauline Roland Proust (Consuela after the heroine of the George Sands novel, and Pauline Roland after the noted French socialist feminist thinker 1805–52). In 1853 the family took a ship to Natal, South Africa to join Helen's brothers, who had emigrated there. Tragedy struck. Helen arrived in South Africa without her husband. Francis Proust was sick and had to leave the ship before it had even left British waters; he died shortly afterwards. On top of that Helen's eight-month-old daughter, Consuela, was also taken ill and died only days after her arrival in South Africa. Helen, widowed and bereaved, decided to return. At some point after her return to England, in 1854, Helen met Church of England Reverend John Wilkinson Edwards, himself recently widowed with a family of 11 children and in 1856 she accepted his offer of marriage. Helen Macfarlane, the first translator of the Communist Manifesto, became a vicar's wife, at St. Michaels Church, Baddiley in the sleepy, leafy Cheshire parish, just outside Nantwich. Helen {{gave birth to}} two boys, Herbert and Walter. [...] She didn't enjoy <b>her</b> <b>quiet</b> life for very long however. In 1860, at the age of only 41, she fell ill with bronchitus and died. She is buried in the churchyard of St. Michaels. The inscription on the gravestone reads: “Sacred to the memory of Helen, wife of the Rev. John W Edwards, who fell asleep in Jesus, March the 29th 1860, aged 41 years. So he giveth his beloved sleep’.” ...|$|E
