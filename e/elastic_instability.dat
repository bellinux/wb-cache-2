Specifically, the pressure kernel from the generalized pressure Poisson equation is used to demonstrate the role of <b>elastic</b> <b>instabilities</b> in inducing and sustaining a turbulent-like flow. Additionally, dynamic mode decomposition is applied to statistically steady viscoelastic flows at different Reynolds number to identify the relative contributions of <b>elastic</b> and inertial <b>instabilities.</b> It is shown that <b>elastic</b> <b>instabilities</b> can be triggered through long-range interactions from disturbances in the free-stream, similarly to by-pass transition, and are then sufficient to self-sustain. When the Reynolds number is increased, the relative contribution of inertial instabilities becomes more important, and the flow demonstrates features that are characteristic to Newtonian turbulent flows (e. g., streaks, quasi-streamwise vortices), although at lower intensity...|$|R

If there is a mismatch between the lattice sizes of the growing film and the supporting crystal, elastic energy will be accumulated in the growing film. At some critical height, the free energy of the film can be lowered if the film breaks into isolated islands, where the tension can be relaxed laterally. The critical height depends on the Young's modulus, mismatch size, and surface tension.|$|E

40|$|Wave {{propagation}} in elastomeric materials undergoing large deformations {{is relevant}} in numerous application areas, including nondestructive {{testing of materials}} and ultrasound techniques, where finite deformations and corresponding stress states can influence wave propagation and hence interpretation of data. In the case of periodically structured hyperelastic solids, the effect of deformation on the propagation of acoustic waves can be even more dramatic. In fact, transformations in the periodic patterns have been observed upon application of load due to microstructural <b>elastic</b> <b>instabilities,</b> providing opportunities for transformative phononic crystals which can switch band-gap structure in a sudden, but controlled manner. Here both analytical and numerical techniques are presented for assessing the influence of finite deformations on the propagation of elastic waves in both monolithic as well as periodically structured elastomeric materials. Both <b>elastic</b> <b>instabilities</b> and propagation of acoustic waves are strongly influenced by geometric pattern, material properties and loading conditions, giving different opportunities for tuning and manipulating the location and presence of instabilities and phononic band gap...|$|R
40|$|Strain-based {{theory on}} <b>elastic</b> <b>instabilities</b> is being widely {{employed}} for studying onset of plasticity, phase transition or melting in crystals. And size effects, observed in nano-materials or solids under dynamic loadings, needs {{to account for}} contributions from strain gradient. However, the strain gradient based higher order elastic theories on the <b>elastic</b> <b>instabilities</b> are not well established to enable one to predict high order instabilities of solids directly at atom level. In present work, a general continuum theory for higher order <b>elastic</b> <b>instabilities</b> is established and justified by developing an equivalent description at atom level. Our results show that mechanical instability of solids, triggered by either strain or strain gradient, is determined by a simple stability condition consisting of strain or strain gradient related elastic constants. With the atom-level description of the higher order elasticity, the strain-gradient elastic constants could be directly obtained by a molecular statics procedure and then serve as inputs of the stability condition. In this way, mechanical instabilities of three metals, i. e., copper, aluminum and iron, are predicted. Alternatively, ramp compression technique by nonequilibrium molecular dynamics (NEMD) simulations is employed to study the higher order instabilities of the three metals. The predicted critical strains at onset of instabilities agree well with {{the results from the}} NEMD simulations for all the metals. Since the only inputs for the established higher order elastic theory are the same as atomic simulations, i. e., atomic potentials and structures of solids, the established theory is completely equivalent to empirical-potential based atomic simulations methods, at least, for crystals.

5000|$|... great {{attention}} is paid to the design of compressed parts and connections. The overall proportions of an optimised structure, without taking buckling into account, are significantly altered when the compressed bars need to be shortened to take account of <b>elastic</b> <b>instability.</b> It becomes sensitive to the scale effect, leading to an extension of the overall proportion and increasing the weight of the structure. Inversely, a shortening of the overall proportions is necessary when the volume of the connections needs to be considered, since the influence of this volume reduces when the bars are lengthened. This shows the advantage of accurately designing not only the compressed parts, but also the connections, in order to avoid these flaws. One of Niki de Saint-Phalle’s light sculptures are therefore preferable to Giacometti’s slender but heavy structures ! ...|$|E
5000|$|For {{the large}} {{majority}} of compressed elements, it is possible to limit the reduction of the working stress to 25% by taking into account <b>elastic</b> <b>instability,</b> providing that the designer focuses on ensuring an efficient geometric design from as early as the initial sketches. This means that the increase in their volume indicator can also be limited to 25% [...] The volume of the elements subject to pure traction is also only very rarely limited to the product of the net distance over which a force is applied by a section strained at the permissible stress. In other words, their real volume indicator is thus also higher than the one which results from the calculation of W. A bar under traction can be welded at its extremities; no extra material apart from the negligible welding material is added, but the rigidity introduce parasitic moments which absorb some of the permissible stress.|$|E
5000|$|In some cases, {{most notably}} the Si/Ge system, {{nanoscale}} dislocation-free islands can be formed during SK growth by introducing undulations into the near surface layers of the substrate. These regions of local curvature serve to elastically deform both the substrate and island, relieving accumulated strain and bringing the wetting layer and island lattice constant closer to its bulk value. This <b>elastic</b> <b>instability</b> at [...] {{is known as the}} Grinfeld instability (formerly Asaro-Tiller-Grinfeld; ATG). The resulting islands are coherent and defect-free, garnering them significant interest for use in nanoscale electronic and optoelectronic devices. Such applications are discussed briefly later. A schematic of the resulting epitaxial structure is shown in figure 3 which highlights the induced radius of curvature at the substrate surface and in the island. Finally, {{it should be noted that}} strain stabilization indicative of coherent SK growth decreases with decreasing inter-island separation. At large areal island densities (smaller spacing), curvature effects from neighboring clusters will cause dislocation loops to form leading to defected island creation.|$|E

40|$|Using {{the inverse}} {{dimensional}} expansion method we study the <b>elastic</b> <b>instability</b> of black rings found recently {{in numerical analysis}} of fully nonlinear dynamical evolutions. In our analysis we should perform 1 /D^ 1 / 2 expansions, not usual 1 /D expansions, of the Einstein equations to capture this <b>elastic</b> <b>instability</b> of D dimensional black rings. By solving the Einstein equations at large D we obtain the effective equations for black rings, and the perturbation analysis of the large D effective equations with 1 /D^ 1 / 2 expansions yields the formula for quasinormal mode frequencies. From this formula, we find that black rings actually suffer from both elastic and Gregory-Laflamme like instabilities. These instabilities are coupled and appear {{at the same time}} as observed in numerical analysis. The <b>elastic</b> <b>instability</b> does disappear at the infinite limit of a ring radius, which implies that the (boosted) black string is stable to elastic perturbations. Furthermore we observe that the Gregory-Laflamme like instability becomes more efficient than the <b>elastic</b> <b>instability</b> even for certain thin black rings in enough higher dimensions.

40|$|Surface <b>elastic</b> <b>instabilities,</b> such as {{wrinkling}} and creasing, {{could enable}} a convenient strategy to impart reversible patterned topography to a surface. Here {{we focus on}} the classic system of a stiff layer on a soft substrate, which famously produces parallel harmonic wrinkles at modest uniaxial compression that period-double repeatedly at higher compressions and ultimately evolve into deep folds and creases. By introducing micron-scale planar Bravais lattice holes to spatially pattern the substrate, we can guide these instabilities into a wide variety of different patterns, including wrinkling in parallel bands and star shape bands, and radically reduce the threshold compression. We are able to understand our experimental patterns and thresholds by considering a simple plane-strain model for the patterned substrate-deformation, decorated by wrinkling on the stiff surface layer. Our experiments also show localized wrinkle-crease transitions at modest compression, yielding a hierarchical surface with different generations of instability mixed together. By varying the geometrical inputs, we demonstrate control over the stepwise evolution of surface morphologies. These results demonstrate considerable control over both the patterns and threshold of the surface <b>elastic</b> <b>instabilities,</b> and have relevance to many emerging applications of morphing surfaces, including in wearable/flexible electronics, bio-medical systems and optical devices...|$|R

40|$|International audienceWe {{determine}} both experimentally and numerically {{the onset}} of <b>elastic</b> flow <b>instabilities</b> in viscoelastic polymer solutions with different levels of shear thinning. Previous experiments realized in microfluidic serpentine channels using dilute polymeric solutions showed that {{the onset of}} <b>elastic</b> <b>instabilities</b> strongly depends on the channel curvature. The scaling dependence is well captured by the general instability scaling criterion proposed by Pakdel and McKinley [Phys. Rev. Lett., 1996, 76, 2459 : 1 – 4]. We determine here the influence of fluid shear thinning on the onset of such purely-elastic flow instabilities. By testing a set of polyethylene oxide solutions of high molecular weight at different polymer concentrations in microfluidic serpentine channels we observe that shear thinning has a stabilizing effect on the microfluidic flow. Three-dimensional numerical simulations performed using the White–Metzner model predict similar trends, which are not captured by a simple scaling analysis using the Pakdel–McKinley criterion...|$|R
40|$|Independent {{studies have}} shown that both the constant-stress and the <b>elastic</b> <b>instability</b> models {{describe}} the form of a plant 2 ̆ 7 s central stem. Teleologically, the constant stress model states that a stem tapers to equalize stress produced by wind pressure along the stem. The <b>elastic</b> <b>instability</b> model states that stems and branches taper to maintain similar elasticity throughout the tree and that total tree height is limited to about one-quarter of the height at which the stem would buckle under its own weight. We investigated the ability of these two models to describe the central stems of both mature and sapling Pinus contorta var. latifolia Engelm. We also tested whether these two models are active in petiole formation by systematically defoliating Trifolium pratense L. The constant stress model adequately described stem taper in both age classes of P. contorta and the petiole form in T. pratense regardless of defoliation treatment. The <b>elastic</b> <b>instability</b> model was valid only for the mature P. contorta and for the control and perhaps for the moderately defoliated T. pratense. The constant stress model appears to be valid for both P. contorta and T. pratense while the <b>elastic</b> <b>instability</b> model is valid only for larger plants...|$|E
40|$|Under {{mechanical}} loading, crystalline solids deform elastically, {{and subsequently}} yield and fail via plastic deformation. Thus crystalline materials experience two mechanical regimes: elasticity and plasticity. Here, we provide numerical and theoretical {{evidence to show}} that metal nanoplates exhibit an intermediate mechanical regime that occurs between elasticity and plasticity, which we call the <b>elastic</b> <b>instability</b> regime. The <b>elastic</b> <b>instability</b> regime begins with a decrease in stress, during which the nanoplates fail via global, and not local, deformation mechanisms that are distinctly different from traditional dislocation-mediated plasticity. Because the nanoplates fail via <b>elastic</b> <b>instability,</b> the governing strength criterion is the ideal strength, rather than the yield strength, and as a result, we observe a unique “smaller is weaker” trend. We develop a simple surface-stress-based analytic model to predict the ideal strength of the metal nanoplates, which accurately reproduces the smaller is weaker behavior observed in the atomistic simulations...|$|E

40|$|We have {{investigated}} the role of elasticity in the stability of air{fluid interfaces during fluid displacement flows. Our investigations of the stability of coating flows with an eccentric cylinder geometry for both a viscous Newtonian fluid and ideal elastic Boger fluids are {{discussed in terms of}} three classes of phenomena. To begin, we have documented several new features in traditional ngering <b>instabilities</b> in <b>elastic</b> displacement flows. These include a very strong elastic destabilization of forward roll coating: a destabilization which can be correlated directly with the elasticity of the coating fluid and which appears to be present {{even in the absence of}} diverging channel walls. Moreover, elastic eects are shown to create a novel saw-toothed cusped pattern in the eccentric cylinder roll-and-plate geometry. Secondly, we have found that purely <b>elastic</b> bulk flow <b>instabilities</b> in the neighbourhood of air{fluid interfaces can cause surface deformations if the secondary flow is of sucient strength. Finally, flows created by the displacement of less viscous air by a more viscous elastic fluid are found to display a new class of purely <b>elastic</b> <b>instabilities</b> which appear to be independent of traditional viscous ngering <b>instabilities</b> and <b>elastic</b> bulk flow <b>instabilities.</b> Thus interfaces which are stable for Newtonian fluids are unstable via purely elastic mechanisms. We have found that indeed elasticity has a dramatic eect on the stability of interfaces, not only changing the critical conditions, but also changing the manifestation of traditional ngering instabilities, and causing new purely <b>elastic</b> interfacial <b>instabilities.</b> 1...|$|R
