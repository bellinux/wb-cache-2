40|$|Gaming {{among young}} people with disabilities is often {{understood}} within a habilitation frame, as if video and computer games primarily should <b>help</b> <b>to</b> <b>exercise</b> and ‘improve’. Little is known about how these games are used within a private frame, and how young people with disabilities operate their gaming as concrete persons rather than as treatment-receiving clients. Through the use of stories, descriptions, and demonstrations from Swedish youth and young adults with disabilities (muscle diseases, cerebral palsy, and Asperger’s syndrome), we explore these gamers’ practical maneuvers, verbal accounts, and biographical-narrative concerns in relation to digital games. As they strive to bypass or overcome digital inaccessibility, various challenges {{find their way into}} their gaming practices, not only to complicate, distract, or disturb them but also to give them extra meaning. Gamer–game identifications turn multifaceted, with disabilities serving as paths both around and into the games’ ‘magical circles’. We suggest partly new concepts – beyond a habilitation frame – to capture how young people struggle to take ownership of gaming and disability: engrossment maintenance, vicarious gamers and biographical as well as situational refuge...|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to analyze the {{spatially}} varying impacts of some classical regressors on per capita household income in Spanish provinces. The authors model this distribution following both a traditional global regression and a local analysis with Geographically Weighted Regression (GWR). Several specifications are compared, being the adaptive bisquare weighting function the more efficient in terms of goodness-of-fit. We test for global and local spatial instability using some F-tests and other statistical measures. We find some evidence of spatial instability in the distribution of this variable in relation to some explanatory variables, which cannot be totally solved by spatial dependence specifications. GWR has revealed as a better specification to model per capita household income. It highlights some facets of the relationship completely hidden in the global results and forces us to ask about questions we would otherwise not have asked. Moreover, the application of GWR can also be of <b>help</b> <b>to</b> further <b>exercises</b> of micro-data spatial prediction. ...|$|R
40|$|SummaryThe «new health consciousness» {{that emerged}} in the {{developing}} countries in the 70 s and 80 s, has contributed <b>to</b> consider <b>exercise</b> as an element of health promotion. But it can establish simplistic relationships between exercise and health, particularly critical for professionals who develop promotion programmes. In this paper, five problematic aspects linked, <b>to</b> <b>exercise</b> and health relationships both in children and youngsters, are discussed and should be taken into account when promoting health programmes. We refer to: 1) the problematic role of exercise in health promotion and in physical education curriculum as an area of privileged action in children and youngsters; 2) the automatic relationship between fitness and health, when the former addresses to high levels of performance and the later is linked to moderate, regular and frequent exercise; 3) problems of fitness tests as a measure of health-related physical activity; 4) the assumption that any kind of physical activity is health-related; and 5) the quantity of exercise necessary for health as a practical problem. From the discussion different proposals are offered in order <b>to</b> develop health-related <b>exercise</b> promotion programmes such as to consider the risks of doing physical activity as a criteria to seled exercises; to emphasize the qualitative instead of quantitative aspects of practice; to reconceptualize fitness and sport towards a health focus; to include a broad range of activities which offer the oportunity to every child and youngster to participate; to reduce the importance of testing in evaluation programmes; and other educational considerations which can <b>help</b> <b>to</b> maintain <b>exercise</b> practice beyond the schooling period...|$|R
