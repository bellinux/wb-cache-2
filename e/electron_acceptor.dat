5|$|Polyphenols, {{which often}} have {{antioxidant}} properties in vitro, {{are not necessarily}} antioxidants in vivo due to extensive metabolism. In many polyphenols, the catechol group acts as <b>electron</b> <b>acceptor</b> and is therefore responsible for the antioxidant activity. However, this catechol group undergoes extensive metabolism upon uptake in the human body, for example by catechol-O-methyl transferase, and is therefore {{no longer able to}} act as <b>electron</b> <b>acceptor.</b> Many polyphenols may have non-antioxidant roles in minute concentrations that affect cell-to-cell signaling, receptor sensitivity, inflammatory enzyme activity or gene regulation.|$|E
5|$|Bacteria {{are further}} divided into lithotrophs that use {{inorganic}} electron donors and organotrophs that use organic compounds as electron donors. Chemotrophic organisms use the respective electron donors for energy conservation (by aerobic/anaerobic respiration or fermentation) and biosynthetic reactions (e.g., carbon dioxide fixation), whereas phototrophic organisms use them only for biosynthetic purposes. Respiratory organisms use chemical compounds {{as a source}} of energy by taking electrons from the reduced substrate and transferring them to a terminal <b>electron</b> <b>acceptor</b> in a redox reaction. This reaction releases energy {{that can be used to}} synthesise ATP and drive metabolism. In aerobic organisms, oxygen is used as the <b>electron</b> <b>acceptor.</b> In anaerobic organisms other inorganic compounds, such as nitrate, sulfate or carbon dioxide are used as electron acceptors. This leads to the ecologically important processes of denitrification, sulfate reduction, and acetogenesis, respectively.|$|E
5|$|Manganese {{phosphating}} is {{used for}} rust and corrosion prevention on steel. Ionized manganese is used industrially as pigments of various colors, which depend on the oxidation state of the ions. The permanganates of alkali and alkaline earth metals are powerful oxidizers. Manganese dioxide is used as the cathode (<b>electron</b> <b>acceptor)</b> material in zinc-carbon and alkaline batteries.|$|E
50|$|Methanogenesis is {{the final}} step in the decay of organic matter. During the decay process, <b>electron</b> <b>acceptors</b> (such as oxygen, ferric iron, sulfate, and nitrate) become depleted, while {{hydrogen}} (H2) and carbon dioxide accumulate. Light organics produced by fermentation also accumulate. During advanced stages of organic decay, all <b>electron</b> <b>acceptors</b> become depleted except carbon dioxide. Carbon dioxide {{is a product of}} most catabolic processes, so it is not depleted like other potential <b>electron</b> <b>acceptors.</b>|$|R
30|$|The {{metabolism}} of G. sulfurreducens {{was investigated}} by constraint-based modelling [159]. In contrast to Escherichia coli, which primarily produces energy and biosynthetic precursors through sugar fermentation, Geobacter completely oxidises acetate and other electron donors via the TCA cycle [160, 161], {{which makes it}} necessary to transfer electrons to terminal <b>electron</b> <b>acceptors</b> for regeneration of cytoplasmic and intramembrane <b>electron</b> <b>acceptors</b> and ATP synthesis. In G. sulfurreducens, this is accomplished by electron transfer to extracellular <b>electron</b> <b>acceptors,</b> i.e. Fe(III) oxides [162].|$|R
5000|$|Oxidative {{biodegradation}} necessitates <b>electron</b> <b>acceptors</b> that microbes use to [...] "respire" [...] {{the electrons}} removed from target contaminants. This transfer of electrons releases energy to drive microbial life functions. Under aerobic conditions, molecular oxygen {{is used for}} this purpose. When oxygen is not present, {{a variety of other}} molecules can serve as <b>electron</b> <b>acceptors.</b> Oxygen is preferentially utilized over the anaerobic <b>electron</b> <b>acceptors</b> because using oxygen gives more energy and, as an added benefit, results in faster contaminants oxidation rates. Unfortunately, the available oxygen is often not sufficient for the contaminants in highly contaminated areas, and as a result the anaerobic <b>electron</b> <b>acceptors</b> must be utilized. Reactive barriers containing oxygen-releasing compounds have been used successfully to stimulate aerobic biodegradation of monoaromatic hydrocarbons.|$|R
5|$|Manganese(IV) oxide {{was used}} in the {{original}} type of dry cell battery as an <b>electron</b> <b>acceptor</b> from zinc, and is the blackish material in carbon–zinc type flashlight cells. The manganese dioxide is reduced to the manganese oxide-hydroxide MnO(OH) during discharging, preventing the formation of hydrogen at the anode of the battery.|$|E
5|$|Molecular oxygen is {{an ideal}} {{terminal}} <b>electron</b> <b>acceptor</b> {{because it is a}} strong oxidizing agent. The reduction of oxygen does involve potentially harmful intermediates. Although the transfer of four electrons and four protons reduces oxygen to water, which is harmless, transfer of one or two electrons produces superoxide or peroxide anions, which are dangerously reactive.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to this metabolic diversity, prokaryotes also possess a range of isozymes– different enzymes that catalyze the same reaction. For example, in E. coli, {{there are two different}} types of ubiquinol oxidase using oxygen as an <b>electron</b> <b>acceptor.</b> Under highly aerobic conditions, the cell uses an oxidase with a low affinity for oxygen that can transport two protons per electron. However, if levels of oxygen fall, they switch to an oxidase that transfers only one proton per electron, but has a high affinity for oxygen.|$|E

50|$|Geobacter {{nanowires}} are modified pili, {{which are}} used to establish connections to terminal <b>electron</b> <b>acceptors.</b> Species of the genus Geobacter use nanowires to transfer electrons to extracellular <b>electron</b> <b>acceptors</b> (such as Fe(III) oxides). This function was discovered through the examination of mutants, whose pili could attach to the iron, but would not reduce it.|$|R
5|$|Archaea {{exhibit a}} great variety of {{chemical}} reactions in their metabolism and use many sources of energy. These reactions are classified into nutritional groups, depending on energy and carbon sources. Some archaea obtain energy from inorganic compounds such as sulfur or ammonia (they are lithotrophs). These include nitrifiers, methanogens and anaerobic methane oxidisers. In these reactions one compound passes electrons to another (in a redox reaction), releasing energy to fuel the cell's activities. One compound acts as an electron donor and one as an <b>electron</b> <b>acceptor.</b> The energy released is used to generate adenosine triphosphate (ATP) through chemiosmosis, the same basic process that happens in the mitochondrion of eukaryotic cells.|$|E
5|$|Lithotrophic {{bacteria}} can use inorganic compounds {{as a source}} of energy. Common inorganic electron donors are hydrogen, carbon monoxide, ammonia (leading to nitrification), ferrous iron and other reduced metal ions, and several reduced sulfur compounds. In unusual circumstances, the gas methane can be used by methanotrophic bacteria as both a source of electrons and a substrate for carbon anabolism. In both aerobic phototrophy and chemolithotrophy, oxygen is used as a terminal <b>electron</b> <b>acceptor,</b> whereas under anaerobic conditions inorganic compounds are used instead. Most lithotrophic organisms are autotrophic, whereas organotrophic organisms are heterotrophic.|$|E
5|$|Some Euryarchaeota are methanogens (archaea {{that produce}} methane {{as a result}} of metabolism) living in {{anaerobic}} environments, such as swamps. This form of metabolism evolved early, and it is even possible that the first free-living organism was a methanogen. A common reaction involves the use of carbon dioxide as an <b>electron</b> <b>acceptor</b> to oxidize hydrogen. Methanogenesis involves a range of coenzymes that are unique to these archaea, such as coenzyme M and methanofuran. Other organic compounds such as alcohols, acetic acid or formic acid are used as alternative electron acceptors by methanogens. These reactions are common in gut-dwelling archaea. Acetic acid is also broken down into methane and carbon dioxide directly, by acetotrophic archaea. These acetotrophs are archaea in the order Methanosarcinales, and are {{a major part of the}} communities of microorganisms that produce biogas.|$|E
40|$|Traditionally, {{ferritin}} {{has been}} considered a photocatalyst capable of photo-oxidizing organic molecules and transferring electrons to external <b>electron</b> <b>acceptors</b> when irradiated by UV-visible light. We have designed new approaches to resolve the uncertainties regarding its photocatalytical mechanism. Experiments with an Fe(II) chelator, an electrochromic indicator, and recombinant ferritin proteins indicate that the excited electrons at the conduction band of the ferritin core do not cross the protein shell. Instead, irradiation causes the electrons to reduce the ferrihydrite core to produce Fe(II) ions. These Fe(II) ions exit the protein shell to reduce <b>electron</b> <b>acceptors.</b> In the absence of <b>electron</b> <b>acceptors</b> or chelators, Fe(II) re-enters ferritin...|$|R

25|$|An MFC-type BOD sensor {{can provide}} {{real-time}} BOD values. Oxygen and nitrate are preferred <b>electron</b> <b>acceptors</b> over the electrode, reducing current generation from an MFC. MFC BOD sensors underestimate BOD {{values in the}} presence of these <b>electron</b> <b>acceptors.</b> This can be avoided by inhibiting aerobic and nitrate respiration in the MFC using terminal oxidase inhibitors such as cyanide and azide.

40|$|Bibliography: pages [44]- 47. Proteus mirabilis strain PM 5006 {{can grow}} anaerobically on {{oxidizable}} substrates such as glycerol or fermentable substrates such as glucose using {{a number of}} <b>electron</b> <b>acceptors.</b> It was found that dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) / trimethylamine-N-oxide (TMAO) / nicotinamide-N-oxide (NAMO), and nitrate (N 0 ₃) can serve as <b>electron</b> <b>acceptors.</b> Cell-free extracts of P. mirabilis were found to reduce these compounds to dimethyl sulfide (DMS), trimethylamine (TMA) / nicotinamide (NAM), and nitrite (NO₂) / {{in the presence of}} various electron donors such as NADH, formate, lactate, reduced benzyl viologen and sodium dithionite. In order to determine whether the same or different terminal reductase(s) are involved in the reduction of these compounds, the plasmid pJB 4 JI (cointegrate pPH 1 ::Mu::Tn 5), harbored in E. coli 1830, was conjugated into P. mirabilis and transconjugants selected for kanamycin resistance. The Kanamycin-resistant mutants were subsequently screened for their inability to grow anaerobically on glycerol/DMSO medium. When these mutants were tested for anaerobic growth on glycerol medium containing TMAO, NAMO and N 0 ₃ as <b>electron</b> <b>acceptors,</b> it was found that there were two groups. Group I mutants were unable to grow using DMSO, TMAO and NAMO as <b>electron</b> <b>acceptors</b> while their growth was unaffected on NO₃. In contrast, group II mutants were unable to grow on all the <b>electron</b> <b>acceptors</b> including NO₃. Enzyme assays with dithionite-reduced benzyl viologen as electron donor showed that group I mutants were unable to reduce the various <b>electron</b> <b>acceptors</b> except NO₃. The group II mutants lost the ability to reduce all the <b>electron</b> <b>acceptors</b> including NO₃. On the basis of these results we conclude that the same terminal reductase is involved in the reduction of DMSO, TMAO, and NAMO (group I). On the other hand, the group II mutants also lost the NO₃ reductase activity. Thus, group II mutants must be defective in the synthesis or insertion of molybdenum cofactor (MOCO) which is in agreement with previous studies. M. S. (Master of Science...|$|R

25|$|The sulfide ion (S2−) {{is present}} in some anoxic sediments {{as a result of}} {{bacterial}} activity. In environments containing little or no oxygen gas (O2) but large amounts of sulfate ion (SO42−), sulfate-reducing bacteria use sulfate in their metabolism as an <b>electron</b> <b>acceptor.</b> This process creates sulfide as a product according to Equation 1.|$|E
30|$|For {{heterofermentative}} {{lactic acid}} bacteria (LAB), external <b>electron</b> <b>acceptors</b> {{can be used as}} alternate routes to reproduce NAD+. The presence or absence of <b>electron</b> <b>acceptors</b> determine whether ethanol (and no more ATP) or acetic acid (and 1 additional ATP) is produced from a glucose molecule (Chen and McFeeters 1986; Condon 1987; McFeeters and Chen 1986; Talarico et al. 1990; Veiga-da-Cunha and Foster 1992). For example, when glycerol exists, the regeneration of NAD+ for glucose metabolism can be achieved through the conversion of glycerol to 1, 3 -PDO using glycerol as the electron receptor (Saxena et al. 2009; Veiga-da-Cunha and Foster 1992). The presence of external <b>electron</b> <b>acceptors,</b> therefore, affects the energy metabolism and end-product profiles, as well as further fermentation applications of LAB.|$|R

30|$|Since {{the rate}} of cytoplasmic proton {{consumption}} is {{lower than that of}} proton production during the reduction of extracellular <b>electron</b> <b>acceptors</b> such as Fe(III), the energy consumption with extracellular <b>electron</b> <b>acceptors</b> is lower compared to that associated with intracellular acceptors [159]. The use of extracellular electron shuttles makes the Geobacter species circumvent the metabolic cost of producing the electron shuttles and consequently more energetically competitive than shuttle-producing Fe(III) reducers in sub-surface environments [159].|$|R

25|$|While aerobic organisms during {{respiration}} use oxygen as {{a terminal}} <b>electron</b> <b>acceptor,</b> anaerobic organisms use other electron acceptors.

30|$|Integration of CNTs or graphenes in OSC photoactive layers {{typically}} {{involves the}} dispersion of CNTs or graphenes in electron-donating polymers. In these OSC designs, CNTs and graphenes act as <b>electron</b> <b>acceptors</b> {{and replace the}} conventional <b>electron</b> <b>acceptors</b> such as 6, 6 -phenyl-C 61 -butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) or 6, 6 -phenyl-C 71 -butyric acid methyl ester (PC 71 BM). In OSCs, photons are absorbed in the photoactive layer and generate excitons (bound electron–hole pairs). These excitons diffuse into the photoactive layer with an exciton diffusion length of 5 – 20  nm [16], and dissociation of excitons occurs at the donor/acceptor interface. Then, separated holes and electrons are transported to the charge transport layer or electrodes via the <b>electron</b> donor or <b>acceptor</b> phase, respectively [17 – 20]. CNTs and graphenes can also provide exciton dissociation sites and charge pathways in the photoactive layer, and the higher conductivities and mobilities of CNTs and graphenes are greater than those characteristic of conventional <b>electron</b> <b>acceptors.</b>|$|R
