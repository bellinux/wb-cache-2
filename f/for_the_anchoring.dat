50|$|When {{hydrophobic}} mismatch occurs, WALPs {{are known}} to tilt in the bilayer. The extent of this tilt is affected {{up to a certain}} point by an entropy contribution that arises from the helix's presence in the bilayer and then by more specific helix-lipid interactions. When charged residues are substituted <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>anchoring</b> residues, these charged amino acids prefer a higher position, farther from the interior of the lipid bilayer, in order to maintain their energetically favorable interaction with water. This interaction thus promotes a smaller angle of tilt.|$|E
50|$|The {{molecular}} mechanism {{behind this}} process {{lies in the}} expression and repression of bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs). BMPs are a wide family of proteins that perform many functions throughout the growing embryo, including stimulating the growth of cartilage and bone. In order {{to allow for the}} growth of precursor neural tissues, as opposed to precursor bone or cartilage tissues, BMP expression is decreased in the neural plate, specifically along the medial line, where the neural groove will soon form.The proteins produced from the genes Noggin and Chordin inhibit these BMPs, and subsequently allow neural commitment genes, like SOX, to be expressed. These genes encode transcription factors, which alter the genomic expression of these cells, furthering them along the path of neural cell commitment.This process of BMP inhibition allows <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>anchoring</b> of the medial hinge point cells, providing the neural folds with the foundation necessary for folding and closure to occur. Noggin and Chordin have other roles in the neurulation process, including stimulating the neural crest cells to emigrate from the newly formed neural tube. The Sonic hedgehog gene also plays a role in attenuating BMP expression, forming the medial hinge point while inhibiting the formation of the dorsolateral hinge points, and in ensuring the proper closure of the neural folds.The prechordal plate, notochord, and non-neural ectoderm are believed to be important inducer tissues which release these chemical signals, in order to trigger neural plate folding.|$|E

Close to the nematic-isotropic transition, another dielectric effect, related to the order-electricity, must also be considered. This effect can justify the functional form proposed in order to interpret the experimental data giving the surface torque vs. tilt angle near the nematic isotropic transition...|$|E
