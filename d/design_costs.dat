25|$|The {{contract}} for two ships {{was awarded to}} the Finnish state-owned shipbuilding company Valmet and was, at the time, the largest single contract made by a Finnish industrial company at FIM 700 million (US$200 million). Although Valmet had been developing its own barge handling system, {{it was agreed that}} the proven American Seabee concept would be adopted instead of the shipyard's own design due to the relatively short timescale before delivery. The Soviets purchased two sets of drawings from the American owners for US$1 million. However, a number of changes were made to the original design, and as a result the <b>design</b> <b>costs</b> accounted for some 25 percent of the man-hours spent on the project. The work included extensive model testing, which resulted in the adoption of a bulbous bow that alone increased the ships' service speed by 0.5 knots.|$|E
25|$|The Moodies {{were also}} among the pioneers {{of the idea that}} a {{successful}} rock band could promote itself through their own label, following the Beatles' creation of Apple Records. After their On the Threshold of a Dream album (1969), they created Threshold Records, prompted in part by disputes with London/Deram over album <b>design</b> <b>costs</b> (their gatefold record jackets and expensive cover art were not popular with company executives). The idea was for Threshold to produce new albums and deliver them to London/Decca who would act as distributor. The group attempted to build Threshold into a major label by developing new talent—most notably the UK hard rock band Trapeze and the Portland, Oregon, classical-acoustic sextet Providence—but these efforts were unsuccessful and the Moodies eventually returned to more traditional recording contracts. However, they helped lay groundwork for other major acts to set up similar personal labels and distribution deals, including the Rolling Stones' own label and Led Zeppelin's Swan Song, and all of the Moodies' studio releases from 1969 to 1999 bore the Threshold logo on at least one of their format versions.|$|E

In the current study, <b>design</b> <b>cost</b> modeling relationships between textile processes and element design details were developed.

The fundamental advantage of a <b>design</b> <b>cost</b> model is to insure that the element <b>design</b> is <b>cost</b> effective for the intended process.

Two methods of analyzing <b>design</b> detail/process <b>cost</b> relationships developed for the <b>design</b> <b>cost</b> model were pursued in the current study.

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfillment}} of the requirements for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. The level of achieved accuracy in <b>design</b> <b>cost</b> estimating is generally accepted by researchers as being less than desirable. Low accuracy {{has been attributed to}} the nature of historical cost data, estimating method and the expertise of the estimator. Previous researchers have suggested that the adoption of resource based estimating by designers could eliminate data and method-related problems. The work in this thesis has shown that this will not solve the problem of inaccuracy in estimating. A major problem in assessing accuracy in <b>design</b> <b>cost</b> estimating has been the absence of a generally agreed definition of the'true cost' of a construction project. Hitherto, studies of accuracy in <b>design</b> <b>cost</b> estimating have relied solely on the assessment of errors using the low bid as a datum. <b>Design</b> <b>cost</b> estimators do not always focus on predicting the low bid. Rather, they may focus on the lowest, second lowest, third lowest or any other bid, mean/median of bids, or sometimes, on just being'within the collection'. This has resulted in designers and researchers having different views on the level of achieved accuracy in estimating. To resolve this problem, an analysis package, ACCEST (ACCuracy in ESTimating), was developed to facilitate 'fair' assessment of accuracy in <b>design</b> <b>cost</b> estimates. Tests - using cost data from 7 offices, the ACCEST package and the OPEN ACCESS II package on an IBM PS/ 2 - have shown that error in <b>design</b> <b>cost</b> estimating (averaging 3. 6...|$|R

There are several {{different kinds of}} ships, including the basic Fighter, a Scout with longer range but weaker weapons, a Colony Ship used to found new colonies, Satellites which are cheap but cannot move from the world at which they are built, and in recent versions a few others as well, such as the Tanker and Dreadnought. Each ship has a ranking in each of five technologies: range (determining how far a ship can fly before refueling), speed (determining how quickly ships reach their destinations and who shoots first in a battle), weapons, shields, and [...] "miniaturization". Higher-tech ships cost more money and metal, {{with the exception of}} ships with high [...] "miniaturization" [...] which take far more money but less metal. Miniaturization is much less effective when applied to Colony Ships, compared to other types of ships. Ships cannot be upgraded, although old ships can be scrapped to retrieve a portion of their metal. When a ship is destroyed in battle, a smaller portion can also be recovered.

Design optimization {{based on the}} enumera-tion of process corners has been widely used, but can suffer from inefficiency and overdesign. In this paper we propose to formulate the analog and RF design with variability prob-lem as a special type of robust optimization problem, namely robust geometric programming. The statistical variations in both the process parameters and design variables are cap-tured by a pre-specified confidence ellipsoid. Using such op-timization with ellipsoidal uncertainty approach, robust de-sign can be obtained with guaranteed yield bound and lower <b>design</b> <b>cost,</b> and most importantly, the problem size grows linearly with number of uncertain parameters. Numerical examples demonstrate the efficiency and reveal the trade-off between the <b>design</b> <b>cost</b> versus the yield requirement.
