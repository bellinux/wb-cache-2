The structure's pedestal consists of two major stylized blocks of white marble, topped by a sculpture of a cloth draped urn. Carved into the façade of the smaller top block of the memorial is a high relief that represents either Fame or an angel placing a laurel wreath upon the head of a dying soldier clasping his sword. Below, on the façade of the larger block, is the inscription: [...] "The Daughters of Old Hampshire Erect This Tribute of Affection to Her Heroic Sons Who Fell in Defence of Southern Rights." [...] The other three sides of the memorial contain the engraved names of 125 Hampshire County men who died for the Confederate cause. A number representing the total fallen Confederates was not included in the memorial as it was not precisely known at the time of the monument's construction. The memorial's <b>foundation</b> <b>block</b> bears the date of its erection, [...] "1867".|$|E

The church has a closed {{building}} {{used during the}} winter (winter church) and a thatching roofed building used in the summer season (summer church). The winter church has seats for 50 people and the summer church can receive up to 300 people.

50|$|The <b>Foundation</b> <b>Block</b> of Ellisbridge {{was later}} {{moved to the}} Sanskar Kendra.

40|$|The diploma thesis {{deals with}} design and {{assessment}} of steel arched bridge with the semi through bridge deck placed on the third-class road. This steel structure is drawn up to bridge water barrier – the river Olše in Návsí. The distance between axes lay on abutments is 48, 5 meters. The bridge´s supporting structure consists of two steel arches angled towards each other and fastened to the <b>foundation</b> <b>blocks.</b> The supporting beam of the bridge deck {{is tied to the}} arch by tie-rods. The tie-rods are designed to the V-shaped system...|$|R
50|$|Shortly thereafter, a {{landslide}} took place and destroyed the constructed retaining walls. The landslide contained an estimated 100,000 square metres of mud - a mass equivalent to 200 Boeing 747 jets. The soil rammed onto the <b>foundation</b> of <b>Block</b> 1, incrementally pushing it forward. After of that constant pressure, the <b>foundations</b> of <b>Block</b> 1 snapped and in December 1993, residents {{began to see}} cracks forming and widening on the road around the Highland Towers, a forewarning of collapse. Unfortunately, there was no further investigation before Block 1 collapsed on 11 December 1993.|$|R
5000|$|In August 1906, {{the upper}} part of the tower above the columns was changed from white to black to provide a more {{conspicuous}} day beacon. In 1915, $35,000 was requested to disassemble and move the tower and dwellings to the site of Bald Head Lighthouse, as it was believed that shoreline erosion would soon endanger the structures. Apparently the erosion ceased because the funding request was not repeated and the keepers dwellings still stand today on their original location near the concrete <b>foundation</b> <b>blocks</b> that once supported the lighthouse.|$|R
50|$|The steel {{structure}} of the approaching spans of each bank were assembled {{on the ground and}} then placed, using a crane, on the piers. The steel bases of the arches (the distance from the arch’s basement to the deck’s intersection) were then placed in one single operation with a crane (33m in cantilever) and embedded into the <b>foundation</b> <b>block.</b> Having positioned the two pieces of the arches on one bank, they were joined at the top by means of a steel brace placed with a crane. Consequently, the crane placed the {{steel structure}} of the deck from pier to the arch-deck section.|$|E
50|$|In 1902 the {{foundation}} of St Thomas' Anglican Church was laid on the hill above the town. It is notable for its stained glass windows. The Bunyip Parish of St. Thomas' was originally part of the Gippsland Forest mission in 1879 and early services were held in Kraft's Hall. On 15 October 1902, Mrs. W.A. A'Beckett Snr. of Brighton laid the <b>foundation</b> <b>block</b> for the new church which was designed by architect Frederick L. Klingender. This church was built on land donated by the A'Beckett family and cost over £377 and the opening was conducted by the Right Rev. Bishop Arthur Pain, the first Bishop of the Diocese on 28 December 1902.|$|E
50|$|On May 30, 1893. a three-ton Berea {{sandstone}} <b>foundation</b> <b>block</b> was put {{in place}} by Colonel John Frazee. The main portion of the building is four stories high, and the most notable feature is the five-story tower on the northeast corner of the building. The tower has '3 x 5' foundation blocks, the main entrance corners and the front window lintels are all of solid rough-hewn sandstone. The main entry arch rests on top of polished granite columns that rise from each cornerstone. Positioned above is a black iron drop-gate, and a gothic barrier between the front steps and the colossal oak doors. There were also pointed iron rods bolted to the scarlet brick walls that make up the window protectors on the first floor. The effect is a splendid mix of color and texture in materials. The overall design effectively conveys that this is an urban fortress.|$|E

50|$|In 1897, the <b>foundation</b> <b>blocks</b> for St Anthony's Primary School, Umuezukwe, was laid. The {{school was}} {{eventually}} completed in 1908. Following government take over {{of the management}} of the School from the church, it was renamed Umuezukwe Primary School, a public institution. Analysis of survey conducted on 16 April 2014 for combined Pre-primary and Primary Schools showed the school was understaffed and in need of modern and adequate classrooms to support effective teaching and learning. Specifically, the survey found that the school had 345 learners served by 5 teachers and 9 classrooms. That is, 185 male students and 160 female students.|$|R
