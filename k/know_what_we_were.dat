500|$|In 1918 Northcliffe asked Beach Thomas {{to travel}} to the US. According to Beach Thomas, the {{rationale}} was that [...] "he didn't know what the Americans were doing, and they did not <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> thinking". He met with influential people such as Henry Ford, Roosevelt and Woodrow Wilson during this visit.|$|E
500|$|Black Francis {{recalled}} {{that he wrote}} [...] "Here Comes Your Man" [...] around {{the time he was}} age 14 or 15. Years later after the Pixies were formed, producer Paul Kolderie noted the group didn't want to record [...] "Here Comes Your Man" [...] for its demo [...] "The Purple Tape". The group referred to it as [...] "the Tom Petty song", according to Kolderie. Producer Gary Smith said, [...] "There was some reluctance to do 'Here Comes Your Man' because it was too pop, there was something too straight about it." [...] When 4AD label head Ivo Watts-Russell handpicked the track listing for the group's debut release Come on Pilgrim, he intentionally left out [...] "Here Comes Your Man". Watts-Russell stated that he liked the song, but [...] "it felt just too obviously commercial and I didn't <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> doing with [...] ". Watts-Russell also felt it was too reminiscent of Mink DeVille's [...] "Spanish Stroll". For a post-Surfer Rosa single, 4AD rejected another recording of the song; they later chose [...] "Gigantic", with [...] "River Euphrates" [...] on the B-side.|$|E
2500|$|The band {{decided to}} change its name to Revocation in 2006; Davidson commented: [...] "I think, looking a little deeper into it, we {{made a lot of}} {{mistakes}} with Cryptic Warning. We were younger and didn't really <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> doing, so Revocation was us starting fresh with a clean slate and revoking our past mistakes." [...] With a direction change, Revocation promptly recorded a three-song demo titled Summon the Spawn, and in 2008 they went back into the studio to record their first full-length album, Empire of the Obscene. The full length was self-released, and the band financed its own tour, attracting the interest of several record labels. Revocation subsequently signed to Relapse Records.|$|E

2500|$|... "We had to {{go through}} torture to perfect the process of putting it on", Stanley {{admitted}} in 1996. [...] "I can remember plenty of times when I blinded myself with black eye make-up...In the beginning, the white was a zinc oxide cream which you can buy in any pharmacy. We didn't <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> doing; we just wanted white faces...and the zinc oxide beating spraying ourselves with white paint. We eventually worked our way up to what's called 'clown white.' The two best brands are made by Stein's and Max Factor... At first, the black was Maybelline waterproof eyeliner, but it would crack because it's only meant to draw a line around your eye, not a whole star. Now we use black grease sticks, which are a more solid form of greasepaint. The silver that Peter and Ace use is made by Stein's, and it comes in bottles in either metallic gold or metallic silver...The only time we have problems is in situations of extreme heat. I remember doing a show when it was so hot and humid that the make-up literally ran off our faces. Between songs we'd run {{to the side of the}} stage to slap on more clown white!" ...|$|E

60|$|Our {{greatest}} trouble, that evening, {{was to make}} a fire. The wood, {{of which}} there was a good deal lying about under the trees, was now all wet and would not burn. However, we managed to get up a fire in the stove, but I did not <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> going to do in the morning. We should have stored away some wood under shelter.|$|E

'Why {{he wanted}} us to stop from church, asked me to let off the poor little coon; and when I said we couldn't, because we were in the choir, wanted to <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> paid, then why we did it at all; and so it turned out that he thinks churches only meant for women and psalm-singing niggers and Methodists, and has never been inside one in his life, never saw the sense of it, wanted to know why I went.' ...|$|E

6000|$|As our sheets {{were all}} flying forward, and {{remained}} {{so for a}} few minutes, it gave me leisure to look about. I soon saw both proas, and glad enough was I to perceive {{that they had not}} approached materially nearer. Mr. Kite observed this also, and remarked that our movements had been so prompt as [...] "to take the rascals aback." [...] He meant, they did not exactly <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> at, and had not kept away with us.|$|E
60|$|Ghak {{had entered}} the {{apartment}} some time before we concluded our conversation, and now he wanted to <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> so excited about. Perry thought we had best not tell him too much, and so I only explained that I had a plan for escape. When I had outlined it to him, he seemed about as horror-struck as Perry had been; but for a different reason. The Hairy One only considered the horrible fate that would be ours were we discovered; but at last I prevailed upon him to accept my plan as the only feasible one, and when I had assured him that I would take all the responsibility for it were we captured, he accorded a reluctant assent.|$|E

Lilolilo of himself could make any woman reckless. I was twice reckless, for I had cold, grey Nahala to spur me on. I knew. I had never a doubt. Never a hope. Divorces in those days were undreamed. The wife of George Castner could never be queen of Hawaii, even if Uncle Robert's prophesied {{revolutions}} were delayed, and if Lilolilo himself became king. But I never thought of the throne. What I wanted {{would have been the}} queendom of being Lilolilo's wife and mate. But I made no mistake. What was impossible was impossible, and I dreamed no false dream.|$|E

60|$|It is {{too much}} to suppose that the combatants will ever drop the obvious old bone. But it is not too much to imagine that some men might {{acknowledge}} the bone to be merely a pretext, and hollow casus belli. If we really could <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> fighting for, if we if we could deeply believe in what we were fighting for, then the struggle might have dignity, beauty, satisfaction for us. If it were a profound struggle for something that was coming to life in us, a struggle that we were convinced would bring us to a new freedom, a new life, then it would be a creative activity, a creative activity in which death is a climax in the progression towards new being. And this is tragedy.|$|E
60|$|On {{the other}} hand, we were as miserable as nature could well make us to be, for we were upon a voyage and no voyage, we were bound somewhere and nowhere; for though {{we knew what}} we {{intended}} to do, we did really not <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> doing. We went forward and forward by a northerly course, and as we advanced the heat increased, which began to be intolerable to us, {{who were on the}} water, without any covering from heat or wet; besides, we were now in the month of October, or thereabouts, in a southern latitude; and as we went every day nearer the sun, the sun came also every day nearer to us, till at last we found ourselves in the latitude of 20 degrees; and having passed the tropic about five or six days before that, in a few days more the sun would be in the zenith, just over our heads.|$|E
6000|$|My dear Severn--Your note {{gave me some}} pain, not on my own account, but on yours. Of course I {{should never}} suffer any petty vanity of mine to hinder you in any wise; and {{therefore}} I should say [...] "put the miniature in the exhibition" [...] if only myself was to be hurt. But, will it not hurt you? What good can it do to any future picture. Even a large picture is lost in that canting place--what {{a drop of water}} in the ocean is a Miniature. Those who might chance to see it for the most part if they had ever heard of either of us and <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> and of what years would laugh at the puff of the one and the vanity of the other.
