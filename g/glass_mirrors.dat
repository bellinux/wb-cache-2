25|$|A silver <b>glass</b> <b>mirror</b> is an {{ordinary}} mirror, coated {{on its back}} surface with silver, which produces images by reflection. This kind of <b>glass</b> <b>mirror</b> is produced by coating a silver, copper film and two or more layers of waterproof paint on the back surface of float glass, which perfectly resists acid and moisture. A silver <b>glass</b> <b>mirror</b> provides clear and actual images, is quite durable, and is widely used for furniture, bathroom and other decorative purposes.|$|R
25|$|A safety <b>glass</b> <b>mirror</b> {{is made by}} {{adhering}} {{a special}} protective film to the back surface of a silver <b>glass</b> <b>mirror,</b> which prevents injuries in case the mirror is broken. This kind of mirror is used for furniture, doors, glass walls, commercial shelves, or public areas.|$|R
5000|$|Most astronomical {{reflecting}} telescope use <b>glass</b> <b>mirror</b> components made of borosilicate glass {{because of its}} low coefficient of thermal expansion.

25|$|Glass was a {{desirable}} material for mirrors. Because {{the surface of}} glass is naturally smooth, it produces reflections with very little blur. In addition, glass is very hard and scratch resistant. However, glass by itself has little reflectivity, so people began coating it with metals to increase the reflectivity. Metal-coated <b>glass</b> <b>mirrors</b> are said by the Roman scholar Pliny the Elder to have been invented in Sidon (modern-day Lebanon) {{in the first century}} AD, although no archeological evidence of them date from before the third century. According to Pliny, the people of Sidon developed a technique for creating crude mirrors by coating blown glass with molten lead. <b>Glass</b> <b>mirrors</b> backed with gold leaf are mentioned by Pliny in his Natural History, written in about 77 AD. Because there were few ways to make a smooth piece of glass with a uniform thickness, these ancient glass-mirrors were made by blowing a glass bubble, and then cutting off a small, circular section, producing mirrors that were either concave or convex. These circular mirrors were typically small, from only a fraction of an inch to as much as eight inches in diameter. These small mirrors produced distorted images, yet were prized objects of high value. These ancient <b>glass</b> <b>mirrors</b> were very thin, thus very fragile, because the glass needed to be extremely thin to prevent cracking when coated with a hot, molten metal. Due to the poor quality, high cost, and small size of these ancient <b>glass</b> <b>mirrors,</b> solid metal-mirrors primarily of steel were usually preferred until the late nineteenth century.|$|E

25|$|Factories {{were needed}} to produce {{affordable}} wooden household furniture for the southern market. The first furniture company, the High Point Furniture Manufacturing Company, was formed in 1889. Subsequently, from 1890-1900, 38 new furniture factories opened in the state, with 13 of those in High Point. The Southern Railway line was formed in 1894, and High Point was shipping eight fully loaded freight cars of furniture each day by 1898. By {{the turn of the}} century, High Point had become the leading furniture center in the South, with over 40 furniture companies located within the city and the surrounding area. Meanwhile, other manufacturers set up local factories to provide related products like veneers, plate <b>glass,</b> <b>mirrors,</b> paint, and locks to furniture companies.|$|E

25|$|A {{silkscreen}} printed <b>glass</b> <b>mirror</b> {{is produced}} using inorganic color ink that prints patterns through a special screen onto glass. Various colors, patterns, and glass shapes are available. Such a <b>glass</b> <b>mirror</b> is durable and more moisture resistant than ordinary printed glass and can serve for over 20 years. This type of glass {{is widely used}} for decorative purposes (e.g., on mirrors, table tops, doors, windows, kitchen chop boards, etc.).|$|R
25|$|The {{problems}} of making metal-coated, <b>glass</b> <b>mirrors</b> {{was due to}} the difficulties in making glass that was very clear, as most ancient glass was tinted green with iron. This was overcome when people began mixing soda, limestone, potash, manganese, and fern ashes with the glass. There was also no way for the ancients to make flat panes of glass with uniform thicknesses. The earliest methods for producing glass panes began in France, when people began blowing glass bubbles, and then spinning them rapidly to flatten them out into plates from which pieces could be cut. However, these pieces were still not uniform in thickness, so produced distorted images as well. A better method was to blow a cylinder of glass, cut off the ends, slice it down the center, and unroll it onto a flat hearth. This method produced the first mirror-quality glass panes, but it was very difficult and resulted in a lot of breakage. Even windows were primarily made of oiled paper or stained glass, until the mid-nineteenth century, due to the high cost of making clear, flat panes of glass.|$|E
25|$|A Scheffler cooker (named {{after its}} inventor, Wolfgang Scheffler) uses a large ideally {{paraboloidal}} reflector which is rotated around an axis that is {{parallel with the}} earth's using a mechanical mechanism, turning at 15 degrees per hour {{to compensate for the}} earth's rotation. The axis passes through the reflector's centre of mass, allowing the reflector to be turned easily. The cooking vessel is located at the focus which is on the axis of rotation, so the mirror concentrates sunlight onto it all day. The mirror has to be occasionally tilted about a perpendicular axis to compensate for the seasonal variation in the sun's declination. This perpendicular axis does not pass through the cooking vessel. Therefore, if the reflector were a rigid paraboloid, its focus would not remain stationary at the cooking vessel as the reflector tilts. To keep the focus stationary, the reflector's shape has to vary. It remains paraboloidal, but its focal length and other parameters change as it tilts. The Scheffler reflector is therefore flexible, and can be bent to adjust its shape. It is often made up {{of a large number of}} small plane sections, such as <b>glass</b> <b>mirrors,</b> joined together by flexible plastic. A framework that supports the reflector includes a mechanism that can be used to tilt it and also bend it appropriately. The mirror is never exactly paraboloidal, but it is always close enough for cooking purposes.|$|E

[...] The day before the video's premiere, a teaser trailer was uploaded onto video sharing site YouTube, which combines many clips from the full video. The music video was uploaded on video website VEVO on June5,2010 at 11:30amET. VEVO stylized their logo with the E reversed, similar to Eminem's logo. On June7, the television premiere took place on MTV and VH1, and the former featured a primetime encore the day after.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis work was to carry out initial studies on Scania’s {{possibility}} to have plastic rearview <b>mirror</b> <b>glasses</b> as that for example may reduce costs and problems for Scania’s customers and enable another design of the mirror assembly. It was performed by studying the legislative and Scania demands regarding rearview mirrors to write a test program, find and order plastic mirrors, and then perform the tests and evaluate the mirrors {{to see if they}} seem good enough for Scania’s trucks. A Scania technical regulation for rearview <b>mirror</b> <b>glass</b> was also written.   The tested mirrors were a Scania <b>glass</b> <b>mirror</b> as reference, a PC mirror from Sabic, a PC and a PMMA mirror from Specchidea, a mirror from SMR automotive, an ABS mirror from Ficocipa/Renault, an ABS mirror from Ford and a PC plastic from Bayer and they were tested for scratch resistance, temperature variations, impact resistance, corrosion and chemical resistance in that order. If a sample did not pass a certain test, it was not subjected to the next one.   Of all samples it was only the SMR mirror and the reference <b>glass</b> <b>mirror</b> that passed the first test (scratch resistance). The others became too scratched and were not tested further. The SMR and the <b>glass</b> <b>mirror</b> also withstood all the following tests very good, the SMR mirror was the best one of the tested mirrors. Probably the SMR mirror was the best one because many of the other mirrors did not seem to have been made for outdoor conditions and because it seemed to be the most modern mirror with a good abrasion resistant coating.   It was concluded that there is a future for plastic <b>mirror</b> <b>glasses,</b> that {{it would be interesting to}} do more tests on the mirrors, for example a UV test and a distortion test, and to test more mirrors as a new generation of plastic <b>mirror</b> <b>glass</b> seem to be underway.

2500|$|During {{the period}} 1850–1900, reflectors {{suffered}} from problems with speculum metal mirrors, and {{a considerable number}} of [...] "Great Refractors" [...] were built from 60cm to 1 metre aperture, culminating in the Yerkes Observatory refractor in 1897; however, starting from the early 1900s a series of ever-larger reflectors with <b>glass</b> <b>mirrors</b> were built, including the Mount Wilson 60-inch, the 100-inch (2.5 metre) Hooker Telescope (1917) and the 200-inch (5 metre) Hale telescope (1948); essentially all major research telescopes since 1900 have been reflectors. A number of 4-metre class (160 inch) telescopes were built on superior higher altitude sites including Hawaii and the Chilean desert in the 1975–1985 era. The development of the computer-controlled alt-azimuth mount in the 1970s and active optics in the 1980s enabled a new generation of even larger telescopes, starting with the 10-metre (400 inch) Keck telescopes in 1993/1996, and a number of 8-metre telescopes including the ESO Very Large Telescope, Gemini Observatory and Subaru Telescope.|$|E

2500|$|The {{method of}} making flat panes of clear glass from blown {{cylinders}} began in Germany and evolved through the Middle Ages, until being perfected by the Venetians {{in the sixteenth}} century. The Venetians began using lead glass for its crystal-clarity and its easier workability. Some time during the early Renaissance, European manufacturers perfected a superior method of coating glass with a tin-mercury amalgam, producing an amorphous coating with better reflectivity than crystalline metals and causing little thermal shock to the glass. The exact date and location of the discovery is unknown, but in the sixteenth century, Venice, a city famed for its glass-making expertise, became a center of mirror production using this new technique. <b>Glass</b> <b>mirrors</b> from this period were extremely expensive luxuries. For example, in the late seventeenth century, the Countess de Fiesque {{was reported to have}} traded an entire wheat farm for a mirror, considering it a bargain. These Venetian mirrors were limited in size to a maximum area of around [...] square, until modern glass panes began to be produced during the Industrial Revolution. The Saint-Gobain factory, founded by royal initiative in France, was an important manufacturer, and Bohemian and German glass, often rather cheaper, was also important.|$|E
