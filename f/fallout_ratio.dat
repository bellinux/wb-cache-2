40|$|This article {{examines}} the interdependence between the operational planning level of development {{and the effectiveness of}} the production process. The operational planning level of development has been measured by the scale of six intensity levels (1 – 6) to evaluate each of the eight targeted tasks (planning raw and materials, work planning, planning tools and equipment, capacity planning, termination of production, scheduling by work centres, drafting and launching of work documentation and various records terms and performance), while the effectiveness of the production process has been measured by the following indicators: productivity, stock turnover rate, capacity utilisation rate, delivery time and <b>fallout</b> <b>ratio.</b> The results have shown that enterprises with higher operational planning level of development present better effectiveness of the production process in comparison to enterprises with less operational planning level of development...|$|E
40|$|International audienceSoils {{have been}} sampled in the {{vicinity}} of the TomskeSeversk facility (Siberia, Russia) that allows us to measure radioactive contaminations due to atmospheric and aquatic releases. Indeed soils exhibit large inventories of man-made fission products including 137 Cs (ranging from 33, 000 to 68, 500 Bq m! 2) and actinides such as plutonium (i. e. 239 þ 240 Pu from 420 to 5900 Bq m! 2) or 241 Am (160 e 1220 Bq m! 2). Among all sampling sites, the bank of the Romashka channel exhibits the highest radioisotope concentrations. At this site, some short half-life gamma emitters were detected as well indicating recent aquatic discharge in the channel. In comparison, soils that underwent atmospheric depositions like peat and forest soils exhibit lower activities of actinides and 137 Cs. Soil activities are too high to be related solely to global fallout and thus the source of plutonium must be discharges from the Siberian Chemical Combine (SCC) plant. This is confirmed by plutonium isotopic ratios measured by ICP-MS; the low 241 Pu/ 239 Pu and 240 Pu/ 239 Pu atomic ratios with respect to global <b>fallout</b> <b>ratio</b> or civil nuclear fuel are consistent with weapons grade signatures. Up to now, the influence of TomskeSeversk plutonium discharges was speculated in the Ob River and its estuary. Isotopic data from the present study show that plutonium measured in SCC probably constitutes a significant source of plutonium in the aquatic environment, together with plutonium from global fallout and other contaminated sites including Tomsk, Mayak (Russia) and Semipalatinsk (Republic of Kazakhstan). It is estimated that the proportion of plutonium from SCC source can reach 45 % for 239 Pu and 60 % for 241 Pu in the sediments...|$|E
40|$|Artificial {{radionuclides}} {{enter the}} Mediterranean Sea mainly through atmospheric deposition following {{nuclear weapons tests}} and the Chernobyl accident, but also through the river discharge of nuclear facility effluents. Previous studies of artificial radionuclides impact of the Mediterranean Sea have focussed on shallow, coastal sediments. However, deep sea sediments {{have the potential to}} store and accumulate pollutants, including artificial radionuclides. Deep sea marine sediment cores were collected from Mediterranean Sea abyssal plains (depth > 2000 m) and analysed for 239, 240 Pu and 137 Cs to elucidate the concentrations, inventories and sources of these radionuclides in the deepest areas of the Mediterranean. The activity — depth profiles of 210 Pb, together with 14 C dating, indicate that sediment mixing redistributes the artificial radionuclides within the first 2. 5 cm of the sedimentary column. The excess 210 Pb inventory was used to normalize 239, 240 Pu and 137 Cs inventories for variable sediment fluxes. The 239, 240 Pu/ 210 Pbxs ratio was uniform across the entire sea, with a mean value of 1. 24 × 10 − 3, indicating homogeneous fallout of 239, 240 Pu. The 137 Cs/ 210 Pbxs ratio showed differences between the eastern (0. 049) and western basins (0. 030), clearly significant impact of deep sea sediments from the Chernobyl accident. The inventory ratios of 239, 240 Pu/ 137 Cs were 0. 041 and 0. 025 in the western and eastern basins respectively, greater than the <b>fallout</b> <b>ratio,</b> 0. 021, showing more efficient scavenging of 239, 240 Pu in the water column and major sedimentation of 137 Cs in the eastern basin. Although areas with water depths of > 2000 m constitute around 40 % of the entire Mediterranean basin, the sediments in these regions only contained 2. 7 % of the 239, 240 Pu and 0. 95 % of the 137 Cs deposited across the Sea in 2000. These data show that the accumulation of artificial radionuclides in deep Mediterranean environments is much lower than predicted by other studies from the analysis of continental shelf sediments...|$|E
40|$|Environmental samples (soil, {{sediment}} {{and lake}} water) in the Thule area (NW Greenland) {{have been studied}} to assess the contamination of radionuclides originating from a nuclear weapons accident (the Thule accident in 1968). Four lakes were chosen at different distances {{from the point of}} impact with the Thule air base community situated in between. The sedimentation rates in the lakes varied from 0. 4 mm a(- 1) (5 a a(- 1) to 1. 6 mm a(- 1) (82 mg cm(- 2) a(- 1)). With these sedimentation rates, {{it is not possible to}} resolve the Pu- 239,Pu- 240 global fallout peak from a possible Pu- 239,Pu- 240 "accident" peak in the sediment depth profiles. However, the Pu- 239,Pu- 240 /Cs- 137 and the Pu- 238 /Pu- 239,Pu- 240 ratios agreed well with global <b>fallout</b> <b>ratios,</b> indicating that plutonium originating from the accident had not reached these lakes. This also indicates that the Thule air base community has probably only been exposed to radionuclides from the accident to a very limited extent. A limited study showed that Pb- 210 could not be used as a normalizing nuclide to explain the transport of transuranic elements from the catchment area to the lake, i. e. Pb- 210 has a different transport mechanism from that of the transuranic elements studied in this investigation...|$|R
40|$|Vegetation {{studies in}} aged {{plutonium}} fallout areas at the Nevada Test Site and Tonopah Test Range showed {{variations in the}} $sup 239 $-$sup 240 $Pu and $sup 241 $Am contamination levels attributable to differences in the amounts of resuspendable particulate material superficially entrapped upon plant foliage. There was reasonable agreement between the mean activity levels in vegetation and soil samples collected across different activity strata defined by Fidler survey instrument within each <b>fallout</b> area. The <b>ratio</b> of vegetation Pu to soil Pu tended to increase moving out from higher to lower activity strata, which might reflect the increasing proportion of finer particulate material initially deposited in fallout debris at greater distance from ground zero. The Pu/Am ratio was reasonably constant for vegetation samples collected from a given <b>fallout</b> area. This <b>ratio,</b> however, varied among separate test events primarily {{as the result of}} differences in the ingrowth of $sup 241 $Am within the aged source materials. Inventory estimates indicate that standing vegetation contributes a rather insignificant portion of the total contaminant remaining in these aged fallout areas. (auth...|$|R
40|$|Waters {{from the}} Skagerrak Sea {{entering}} {{the system of}} fjords inside Farsund in {{the southern tip of}} Norway (including Lyngsdal, Hellvik and Framvaren fjords) contain plutonium derived from European nuclear fuel reprocessing facilities in the United Kingdom and France, as shown by the 238 Pu/ 239, 240 Pu activity ratios measured for water samples from Hellvik and Framvaren fjords. The shallow sills interconnecting this series of fjords, however, severely restrict water exchange. Thus, at the northernmost Framvaren fjord (connected to Hellvik fjord by a 500 -m channel of 2 m depth), the 238 Pu/ 239, 240 Pu signature for Pu derived from fuel reprocessing is found only in the surface layer (upper 20 m) while global <b>fallout</b> Pu <b>ratios</b> are observed in the permanently anoxic zone of this fjord. Plutonium oxidation state measurements in waters collected from Hellvikkand Framvaren fjords show that water exchange occurs between these two basins by a process of interleaving, with subsequent reduction of oxidized Pu species as these reach the anoxic zone. Plutonium serves as a useful tracer for water exchange between these fjords and the Skagerrak Sea...|$|R
40|$|AbstractFallout {{radionuclides}} {{have been}} used successfully worldwide as tracers for soil erosion, but relatively few studies exploit the full potential of plutonium (Pu) isotopes. Hence, this study aims to explore the suitability of the plutonium isotopes 239 Pu and 240 Pu as a method to assess soil erosion magnitude by comparison to more established fallout radionuclides such as 137 Cs and 210 Pbex. As test area an erosion affected headwater catchment of the Lake Soyang (South Korea) was selected. All three fallout radionuclides confirmed high erosion rates for agricultural sites (> 25 tha− 1 yr− 1). Pu isotopes further allowed determining {{the origin of the}} fallout. Both 240 Pu/ 239 Pu atomic ratios and 239 + 240 Pu/ 137 Cs activity ratios were close to the global <b>fallout</b> <b>ratio.</b> However, the depth profile of the 239 + 240 Pu/ 137 Cs activity ratios in undisturbed sites showed lower ratios in the top soil increments, which might be due to higher migration rates of 239 + 240 Pu. The activity ratios further indicated preferential transport of 137 Cs from eroded sites (higher ratio compared to the global fallout) to the depositional sites (smaller ratio). As such the 239 + 240 Pu/ 137 Cs activity ratio offered a new approach to parameterize a particle size correction factor that can be applied when both 137 Cs and 239 + 240 Pu have the same fallout source. Implementing this particle size correction factor in the conversion of 137 Cs inventories resulted in comparable estimates of soil loss for 137 Cs and 239 + 240 Pu. The comparison among the different fallout radionuclides highlights the suitability of 239 + 240 Pu through less preferential transport compared to 137 Cs and the possibility to gain information regarding the origin of the fallout. In conclusion, 239 + 240 Pu is a promising soil erosion tracer, however, since the behaviour i. e. vertical migration in the soil and lateral transport during water erosion was shown to differ from that of 137 Cs, there is a clear need for a wider agro-environmental testing...|$|E

40|$|A high-precision mass {{spectrometry}} method {{has been developed}} to measure 240 Pu/ 239 Pu at low concentrations in environmental samples. A reproducibility of 0. 5 pg has been achieved using a highly sensitive and precise multi-collector ICP-mass spectrometer (Micromass IsoProbe). The research has involved applying the developed methods {{to a number of}} environmental studies. Application I: A chronology for 240 Pu/ 239 Pu is presented. This chronology over the period 1945 - 1980 is derived from grass samples from the IACR Rothamsted Archive at Harpenden (Hertfordshire, UK) and an Alpine ice core from Dome du Gouter, Mont Blanc, French Alps. Activity concentrations for 137 Cs and 239, 240 Pu and the 238 U/ 235 U atomic ratio were also determined in the same samples. The activity concentrations clearly reflect the yearly yields of atmospheric testing. A higher abundance of 235 U can be linked to nuclear testing between 1950 - 1963. A higher abundance of 238 U is found in the period 1970 - 80 in the grass, but not in the ice. The 240 Pu/ 239 Pu ratio is compared with Polar ice core and stratospheric data that have appeared in the literature. It is particularly notable that the UK herbage samples clearly identify fallout from the early U. S. tests in the Nevada desert (1952 and 1953) and that 1954 - 68 samples show isotope <b>ratios</b> reflecting stratospheric <b>fallout.</b> <b>Ratios</b> for the 1970 s cannot be uniquely attributed to a single source. Complementary measurements of the 240 Pu/ 239 Pu have been carried out on stratospheric air filters from Sweden and ground-level air filters from Germany. Application IIA: Plutonium isotopes have been measured in a sediment core from the Wyre saltmarsh. Radionuclide contamination in this area is much higher than in many other UK sites because of its incorporation of discharges from the BNFL Sellafield. A model for the transport of radiolabelled sediment from the Sellafield area is also presented. Application IIB: Plutonium isotopic ratios in a mudflat core from Poole Harbour reflect the pattern that is expected from weapons fallout in the pre- 1970 period. The post- 1970 sediment shows an additional source that is considered to be the discharges from AEA Winfrith. Application III: Radioactive contamination of the environment by Pu and U as a result of operations at the AWE sites at Aldermaston and Burghfield has been investigated. Isotope ratio results show that contamination of the environment around the sites is patchy and its concentration very small. It {{is interesting to note that}} measurable contamination is not expected from the annual discharge records when a dispersion model is applied...|$|R
40|$|When {{elements}} are simultaneously added to lakes, experimentally or by accident, their ratios {{in the water}} phase and in bottom sediments can change with time due to differential partitioning between solution and suspended particles or sediments. A number of equations are developed to show the change of ratio with time in water and sediments assuming simultaneous pulse inputs followed by a range of combinations of loss processes from solution (i. e. hydraulic losses, sorption to particles followed by settling, and diffusion into the sediments). The pattern of events is discussed both for pulse events with specific limiting assumptions and for combined continuous and pulse inputs. The models show that elemental ratios in sediments are generally less sensitive indicators of differential partitioning than are elemental ratios in water. For lakes with long residence times, the long-term elemental ratio in the sediments does not differ from that in the initial spike to the water column, but for short residence times, it is directly dependent on the ratio of either partition or diffusion coefficients. The models are used to interpret Ru : Cs ratios measured {{in the water and}} sediments of Esthwaite Water subsequent to the pulse input of Chernobyl <b>fallout.</b> The <b>ratios</b> can be explained by assuming nuclides were lost either by flushing and sorption or by flushing, sorption, and diffusion. The process combination of flushing and diffusion is incompatible with the observed constant ratios...|$|R
40|$|Rates of Zn and Pb {{fallout from}} {{atmospheric}} particulates > 10 - 20 μm in diameter have been measured by passive sampling during {{development of the}} McArthur River Zn/Pb mine from 1993 to 1997. Although short-term variability at a given location is high due {{to a combination of}} natural factors and limitations imposed by the sampling technique, long-term fallout rates of Pb increased significantly in 1995 following commencement of local mining operations. Recently fallout rates have decreased and are {{at the lower end of}} the range found in other Australian mining and inner-city locations. The measurement of Pb isotope ratios by ICP-MS in samples of fallout and soil has provided unequivocal evidence that ore-derived Pb has become the dominant Pb source in fallout up to 8. 6 km from the mine. The isotope data has provided sensitive and reliable discrimination between ore-derived Pb and local soil-derived Pb. In areas with several potential sources of <b>fallout,</b> Pb isotope <b>ratios</b> determined by ICP-MS may provide a source-specific and cost-effective monitoring tool...|$|R
40|$|Crops could {{accumulate}} {{trace metals}} by soil-root transfer and foliar uptake from atmospheric fallout, and an accurate assessment of pollution sources {{is a prerequisite}} for preventing heavy metal pollution in agricultural products. In this study, we examined Pb isotope rates to trace the sources of Pb in wheat grain grown in suburbs. Results showed that, even in zones with scarcely any air pollution spots, atmospheric fallout was still a considerable source of Pb accumulation in wheat. The concentration of Pb in wheat grain has poor correlation with that in farm soil. The Pb concentration in wheat grains with dust in bran coat was significantly higher than that in wheat grains, which indicates that Pb may accumulate by foliar uptake. The Pb isotope rate has obvious differences between the soil and atmospheric <b>fallout,</b> and scatter <b>ratio</b> is significantly closer between the wheat grain and atmospheric fallout. Atmospheric fallout is a more significant source of Pb concentration in wheat grains than in soil. As far as we know, this is the first study on the main sources of lead in grain crop (wheat) samples with isotope. This study aims to improve our understanding of the translocation of foliar-absorbed metals to nonexposed parts of plants...|$|R

Finland {{was one of the most}} heavily affected countries by the radioactive fallout outside the former Soviet Union. We analyzed the relation of the estimated external radiation exposure from the fallout to cancer incidence in Finland in 1988 – 2007. The study cohort comprised all ∼ 3. 8 million Finns who had lived in the same dwelling for 12 months following the accident (May 1986 –April 1987). Radiation exposure was estimated using data from an extensive mobile dose rate survey. Cancer incidence data were obtained for the cohort divided into four exposure categories (the lowest with the first-year committed dose < 0. 1 mSv and the highest ≥ 0. 5 mSv) allowing for a latency of 5 years for leukemia and thyroid cancer, and 10 years for other cancers. Of the eight predefined cancer sites regarded as radiation-related from earlier studies, only colon cancer among women showed an association with exposure from <b>fallout</b> [excess rate <b>ratio</b> per increment in exposure category 0. 06, 95 % confidence interval (CI) 0. 02 – 0. 11]. No such effect was observed for men, or other cancer sites. Our analysis of a large cohort over two decades did not reveal an increase in cancer incidence following the Chernobyl accident, with the possible exception of colon cancer among women. The largely null findings are consistent with extrapolation from previous studies suggesting that the effect is likely to remain too small to be empirically detectable and of little public health impact...|$|R

The depth distributions of 90 Sr, 137 Cs and 239, 240 Pu in sediment cores were investigated with 210. the aid of Pb-derived sediment accumulation and mixing rates in the deep basins of the East Sea Sea of Japan. Five box core samples were {{collected from}} the northern Yamato Ridge, Korea Plateau, Ulleung and Japan Basins below 1000 -m depth. Sediment inventories of 137 Cs and 239, 240 Pu are inversely correlated with water depth and linearly correlated with sediment accumulation rates. The inventories of these nuclides are linearly correlated with the accumulation rates of organic carbon in sediments. The 238 Pur 239, 240 Pu activity ratios in sediments are 0. 036 " 0. 009 suggesting that most of the Pu to the study area is derived from the global <b>fallout.</b> The activity <b>ratios</b> of 239, 240 Pur 137 Cs, and 90 Srr 137 Cs in bottom sediments are much lower than those of global fallout due to the differences of particle af®nity and biological uptake of these nuclides.
