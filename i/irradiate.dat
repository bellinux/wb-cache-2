40|$|AbstractFor {{the present}} study, the cotton fabric and dye {{solution}} were <b>irradiated</b> to UV radiation for different times. Dyeing was performed using un-irradiated and <b>irradiated</b> cotton with un-irradiated and <b>irradiated</b> reactive blue dye. Different dyeing parameters such as temperature, pH and time were optimized using <b>irradiated</b> dye and <b>irradiated</b> cotton. The data of colour report {{were obtained from}} un-irradiated and <b>irradiated</b> cotton dyed with reactive blue dye using spectra flash (SF 650). Colourfastness properties show that UV radiation of both cotton and dye powder has improved the grading of fastness from fair to good.

5|$|Even though alpha {{radiation}} cannot penetrate the skin, ingested or inhaled plutonium does <b>irradiate</b> internal organs. Alpha particles generated by inhaled plutonium {{have been found}} to cause lung cancer in a cohort of European nuclear workers. The skeleton, where plutonium accumulates, and the liver, where it collects and becomes concentrated, are at risk. Plutonium is not absorbed into the body efficiently when ingested; only 0.04% of plutonium oxide is absorbed after ingestion. Plutonium absorbed by the body is excreted very slowly, with a biological half-life of 200 years. Plutonium passes only slowly through cell membranes and intestinal boundaries, so absorption by ingestion and incorporation into bone structure proceeds very slowly.|$|E

40|$|We {{examined}} {{the use of}} both biochemical and anatomical techniques to detect <b>irradiated</b> larvae and pupae of the Tephritid fruit fly Bactrocera tryoni (Froggatt). Electrophoretic protein profiles for control and <b>irradiated</b> larvae were similar, irrespective of {{the age at which}} irradiation occurred. Protein profiles for control and <b>irradiated</b> pupae were also similar for the first 2 d of pupation. A new protein band was detected in control pupae 3 d after pupation began. This band was not observed in any <b>irradiated</b> pupae. However, because pupae cannot be aged morphologically, the absence of this protein band cannot be used to distinguish between <b>irradiated</b> and non-irradiated pupae of unknown age. Dissections of pupae indicated that the new protein band was not present because <b>irradiated</b> pupae died during the first days of pupation. No <b>irradiated</b> pupae survived to emergence. Electrophoretic techniques did not identify consistently either <b>irradiated</b> larvae or pupae of B. tryoni. The corrected size of the supraesophageal ganglion in <b>irradiated</b> mature larvae was significantly small than in untreated larvae, ragardless of the age at which irradiation occurred. This reduction was ~ 64 % in samples treated as eggs (26 h), first (72 h), and second (96 h) instars and 24 % in third instars. A significant reduction in size of supraesophageal ganglion of mature third instars from all irradiation treatments suggests that this character may be successfully used to detect B. tryoni <b>irradiated</b> at quarantine dose rates. <b>Irradiated</b> samples had a significantly longer larval and pupation period, possibly because of the inability of <b>irradiated</b> larvae to feed normally. We also observed a significant increase in larval mortality with decreasing age at irradiation...|$|R

By comparing the spectra, including the effects of high electric fields, and by using results for annealed samples, it is possible to determine which of the traps reported in electron <b>irradiated</b> GaAs, most of which are believed to be arsenic interstitial-vacancy pairs, are present in the proton <b>irradiated</b> material. The traps identified in proton <b>irradiated</b> GaAs inculde most of those found in electron <b>irradiated</b> material, either after irradiation or after irradiation and annealing.

Two traps were found in proton <b>irradiated</b> material which have not been obser ved in electron <b>irradiated</b> GaAs. One of these is nearly as abundant as the prominent E 3 center observed in electron <b>irradiated</b> GaAs and is probably also not a simple pair.

Following the 28 days liver and kidney function tests, changes in body weight, organ weight/body weight ratio (ow/bw), histopathological study and AgNPs distribution in liver, kidney, lung, testes were taken as a criteria for evaluation of the toxicity in normal and <b>irradiated</b> rats.

40|$|To {{determine}} {{the effect of}} irradiation on the oxidative quality changes during the storage, pork loin and turkey breast muscles were <b>irradiated</b> using an electron beam. Irradiation accelerated lipid oxidation, increased redness, and produced several sulfur (S) -volatiles that were responsible for the characteristic irradiation off-odor. This quality deterioration by irradiation was dependent on packaging conditions. Lipid oxidation was more problematic when meat was aerobically stored, whereas the production of S-volatiles was greater in vacuum-packaged <b>irradiated</b> raw meats. But when meat was freezer-stored, aerobic packaging was more susceptible to the production of both oxidation-dependent and S-volatiles. Irradiation made the color of meats redder and the redness was more distinct and stable under vacuum conditions. In <b>irradiated</b> meat, the production of carbon monoxide (CO), which can bind to myoglobin as a sixth ligand, was proportional to the irradiation dose. Oxidation-reduction potential was also decreased by irradiation indicating that more reducing conditions were supplied to heme pigments. Thus, it can be concluded that the increased a*-values in <b>irradiated</b> meat was caused by heme pigment-CO ligand formation. The absorption spectra of meat drip also showed that the peak wavelengths of <b>irradiated</b> meat were {{similar to those of the}} CO-myoglobin. Therefore, we suggest that CO-myoglobin be a major heme pigment responsible for the red or pink color in <b>irradiated</b> meats. These color changes and the mechanisms in <b>irradiated</b> raw meat were similar in <b>irradiated</b> precooked meat. A few strategies to reduce the oxidative quality deterioration of <b>irradiated</b> meats were studied. Addition of an antioxidant (sesamol, gallate, Trolox, or alpha-tocopherol) or their combination was effective in reducing the S-volatiles in vacuum-packaged <b>irradiated</b> meats or in controlling lipid oxidation in aerobically packaged <b>irradiated</b> ones. A modified packaging concept (double-packaging; combined use of vacuum and aerobic packaging) was also effective in eliminating S-volatiles and minimizing lipid oxidation during the storage. Especially, gallate + alpha-tocopherol along with double-packaging reduced effectively the red color of <b>irradiated</b> raw and cooked meats. These beneficial effects of double-packaging and antioxidant were more critical in <b>irradiated</b> cooked meat, and it was a very effective method to control the oxidative quality changes of <b>irradiated</b> meats...|$|R
