40|$|ABSTRACT: In this study, the {{stacking}} {{phase shift}} {{effect on the}} stress distribution was investigated for <b>eight-harness</b> <b>satin</b> weave textile composites. Simply stacked two-layer configurations with phase shifts were modeled by unit cells and repeating boundary conditions were applied at the outer surfaces. Detailed stresses were calculated by macro-element post-processing. Results were assessed to investigate the variation of stress distributions according to the manner how the adjacent tows were arranged. The changes in the failure initiation at the matrix and tows were also examined...|$|E
40|$|An {{experimental}} {{study was conducted}} to investigate the mechanical behavior of a T 650 - 35 /AMB 21 <b>eight-harness</b> <b>satin</b> weave polymer composite system. Emphasis was placed on the development and refinement of techniques used in elevated temperature uniaxial PMC testing. Issues such as specimen design, gripping, strain measurement, and temperature control and measurement were addressed. Quasi-static tensile and fatigue properties (R(sub sigma) = 0. 1) were examined at room and elevated temperatures. Stiffness degradation and strain accumulation during fatigue cycling were recorded to monitor damage progression and provide insight for future analytical modeling efforts. Accomplishments included an untabbed dog-bone specimen design which consistently failed in the gage section, accurate temperature control and assessment, and continuous in-situ strain measurement capability during fatigue loading at elevated temperatures. Finally, strain accumulation and stiffness degradation during fatigue cycling appeared to be good indicators of damage progression...|$|E
40|$|The {{present study}} explores {{the effects of}} {{exposure}} in a laboratory combustor on microstructural stability and property retention of an all-oxide fiber-reinforced ceramic composite. The material consists of a porous mullite–alumina matrix and Nextel 720 fibers in an <b>eight-harness</b> <b>satin</b> weave. To assess the effects of matrix strength, two matrix conditions are used, distinguished from one another {{by the amount of}} alumina added through precursor impregnation and pyrolysis (1. 8 % and 4. 8 %). In both cases, the dominant damage mode upon exposure involves interply delamination along the panel midplane. However, significant reductions in the rate and extent of cracking are obtained in the material with higher alumina content: a result of the higher delamination resistance. Mechanical tests performed on exposed specimens reveal a slight (10 – 20 %) reduction in tensile strength along the fiber direction and a comparable increase in shear strength. These trends suggest some sintering of the matrix upon exposure. Examinations of fracture surfaces provide additional supporting evidence. Implications for long-term performance and strategies for imparting improvement in microstructural stability and delamination resistance are discussed...|$|E
40|$|Composite {{manufacturing}} {{using the}} current prepregging technology of impregnating liquid resin into three-dimensionally reinforced textile preforms {{can be a}} costly and difficult operation. Alternatively, using polymer in the solid form, grinding it into a powder, and then depositing it onto a carbon fiber tow prior to making a textile preform is a viable method {{for the production of}} complex textile shapes. The powder-coated towpreg yarn is stable, needs no refrigeration, contains no solvents and is easy to process into various woven and braided preforms for later consolidation into composite structures. NASA's Advanced Composites Technology (ACT) program has provided an avenue for developing the technology by which advanced resins and their powder-coated preforms may be used in aircraft structures. Two-dimensional braiding and weaving studies using powder-coated towpreg have been conducted to determine the effect of resin content, towpreg size and twist on textile composite properties. Studies have been made to customize the towpreg to reduce friction and bulk factor. Processing parameters have been determined for three epoxy resin systems on <b>eight-harness</b> <b>satin</b> fabric, and on more advanced 3 -D preform architectures for the downselected resin system. Processing effects and the resultant mechanical properties of these textile composites will be presented and compared...|$|E
40|$|The {{performance}} of a coated silicon carbide/carbon composite under isothermal and thermal fatigue conditions was investigated. The material studied is known as Ceracarb™ which consists of <b>eight-harness</b> <b>satin</b> weave Nicalon® silicon carbide cloth reinforcement, a carbonaceous matrix, and a silicon carbide composite coating. This advanced composite is being considered for replacing the nickel based superalloy Rene 2 ̆ 741, as the exhaust nozzle components on military afterburning turbine engines. Thermal fatigue experiments, performed in the laboratory using a thermal cycling test system, were intended to roughly simulate the thermal excursions of an afterburning exhaust nozzle. Several thermal profiles were used to characterize the role of temperature, number of cycles, temperature range, and time at temperature, on the room temperature residual tensile strength of the material. The same thermal profiles were also conducted on test specimens of Rene 2 ̆ 741 in order to compare its durability in the laboratory simulation test set-up to the composite. Both materials showed no loss in strength from the as-received condition following thermal testing. However, the Rene 2 ̆ 741 showed evidence of microstructural instability at the maximum test temperature of 1093 °C (2000 °F) which did affect the toughness of the material. While {{the results from this}} study showed that both materials retained strength when thermally exposed in the laboratory under no loads, thermal testing under load may provide a more realistic view of how the materials perform in the afterburning exhaust nozzle application...|$|E
40|$|The {{quasi-static}} uniaxial compressive {{response of}} E-glass/epoxy-Nomex™ sandwich panels containing circular through-holes was studied experimentally. Specimens with four and <b>eight-harness</b> <b>satin</b> weave fabric face-sheets were tested. In both materials the principal failure mechanism consisted of linear damage zones (LDZs) {{emanating from the}} hole edge. LDZs are macroscopically similar to fiber-bridged cracks in tension, and propagated in a stable manner. Cross-sectioning indicated that the LDZ wake was characterized by fiber-kinking in all warp tows, and weft tow cracking. Strain gauges were used to measure local deformation as the LDZ propagated across {{the width of the}} specimen; a strain-softening behavior was observed in the LDZ wake. A damage zone model (DZM) was applied in order to determine its validity and mechanistic basis. This was assessed by examining its ability to predict three experimentally observed phenomena: the notched strength, local strain distribution, and LDZ growth characteristics. Two models were created in order to interrogate the DZM. The damage growth model was used to determine the ability of the DZM to predict the LDZ growth behavior and notched strength. A finite element model was implemented to predict the local strain distribution. In both cases discrete nonlinear springs acting in the wake of an equivalent crack were used to model the LDZ. This approach provided a good correlation with whichever set of measurements was used to calibrate it. Extension of the model to the other phenomena resulted in weaker correlations with the data, suggesting that further work is required to develop a true mechanism-based model...|$|E
40|$|Considerable {{efforts have}} been {{underway}} to develop multidisciplinary technologies for aeroshell structures that will significantly increase the allowable working temperature for the aeroshell components, and enable the system to operate at higher temperatures while sustaining performance and durability. As part of these efforts, high temperature polymer matrix composites and fabrication technologies are being developed for the primary load bearing structure (heat shield) of the spacecraft. New high-temperature resins and composite material manufacturing techniques are available that {{have the potential to}} significantly improve current aeroshell design. In order to qualify a polymer matrix composite (PMC) material as a candidate aeroshell structural material, its performance must be evaluated under realistic environments. Thus, verification testing of lightweight PMC's at aeroshell entry temperatures is needed to ensure that they will perform successfully in high-temperature environments. Towards this end, a test program was developed to characterize the mechanical properties of two candidate material systems, T 650 - 35 /AFR-PE- 4 and T 650 - 35 /RP 46. The two candidate high-temperature polyimide resins, AFR-PE- 4 and RP 46, were developed at the Air Force Research Laboratory and NASA Langley Research Center, respectively. This paper presents experimental methods, strength, and stiffness data of the T 650 - 35 /AFR-PE- 4 material as a function of elevated temperatures. The properties determined during the research test program herein, included tensile strength, tensile stiffness, Poisson s ratio, compressive strength, compressive stiffness, shear modulus, and shear strength. Unidirectional laminates, a cross-ply laminate and two <b>eight-harness</b> <b>satin</b> (8 HS) -weave laminates (4 -ply and 10 -ply) were tested according to ASTM standard methods at room and elevated temperatures (23, 316, and 343 C). All of the relevant test methods and data reduction schemes are outlined along with mechanical data. These data contribute to a database of material properties for high-temperature polyimide composites that will be used to identify the material characteristics of potential candidate materials for aeroshell structure applications...|$|E
