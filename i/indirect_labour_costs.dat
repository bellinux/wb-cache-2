Economic efficiencies arise through the integration of direct and indirect labour tasks and the alignment of the organisational structure with the occupational logic of communities of practice among technicians.

Construction workers, however, are treated largely as secondary citizens, deprived of means to protect their dignity. They form one of the biggest groups that comprise the urban underclass. Often having migrated from rural areas or neighbouring countries, they work for buildings that they would never dream of living or working in. Given the current development of globalisation, {{the construction}} site is increasingly becoming a site where informal labour meets global capital. In both developed and developing countries, there is increasing competitive pressure on individual construction firms to cut off direct and <b>indirect</b> <b>labour</b> <b>costs</b> by using migrant labour and keeping labour as informal as possible. Still, construction firms in developed countries look for new markets in developing countries. Construction TNCs create, demolish and recreate instant global supply chains at the sites.

The findings show differences in both sets of firms. Firms with lower than average costs have reduced their employee levels over the past three years, which is reflected in their reduced direct <b>labour</b> <b>costs,</b> arguably as a result of increased contracting out of activities. The lower than average costs translate into the ability to offer competitive pricing and increased market share.

40|$|This article showcases ongoing {{work within}} ONS {{to develop a}} new unit <b>labour</b> <b>costs</b> {{indicator}} for the UK by building upon the existing unit wage costs series. It begins by examining the concept of unit wage costs, describing what the series aims to measure and explaining some of the conceptual difficulties when estimating data in practice. The first issue concerns the series used to measure the <b>labour</b> <b>costs</b> of employees; wages and salaries are currently used instead of the more comprehensive compensation of employees (CoE) series. Secondly, the <b>labour</b> <b>costs</b> of the self-employed are not satisfactorily estimated by the current method.

50|$|But the {{production}} of any commodity generally requires both labour and some previously produced means of production (or capital goods), like tools and materials. The amount of labour so required is called the direct labour input into the commodity. Yet the required capital goods have in their turn been produced (in the past) by labour and other capital goods; and so on for these other capital goods, and so on. The sum of all the amounts of labour, that were direct inputs into this backwards-stretching series of capital goods produced in the past, is called the <b>indirect</b> <b>labour</b> input into the commodity. Putting together the direct and <b>indirect</b> <b>labour</b> inputs, one finally gets the total labour input into the commodity, which may also be called the total embodied labour in it, or its direct and <b>indirect</b> <b>labour</b> contents.|$|R
