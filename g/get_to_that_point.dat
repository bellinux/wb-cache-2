The trio parted ways with their record label, Interscope in 2012, later self-releasing an extended play, Dogs Eating Dogs, that holiday season. Plans for a seventh Blink-182 album were delayed numerous times, reportedly due to guitarist Tom DeLonge's involvement in his other group, Angels & Airwaves, as well as other projects. In the interim, the band mounted an anniversary tour for its self-titled fifth album, and headlined the Reading and Leeds festivals. By the time DeLonge spoke to Rock Sound in November 2014, there was still little work completed on the album: [...] "We're just <b>getting</b> <b>to</b> <b>that</b> <b>point</b> of starting... there's no timeline at the moment." [...] By the time a record deal was finalized one month later, DeLonge backed out of recording and performing commitments by email—which led bassist Mark Hoppus and drummer Travis Barker to seek legal separation from him in what Hoppus described as a [...] "friendly divorce" [...] from DeLonge.|$|R

The win qualified them to represent their league in a game that was being referred to for the first time as the Super Bowl (and referred to retroactively as Super Bowl III). They were pitted against the champions of the NFL, the Baltimore Colts. At the time, the AFL was considered to be inferior to the NFL, and most considered the Jets to be considerable underdogs and treated them as such. That would change three nights before the game while Namath was being honored by the Miami Touchdown Club as its Player of the Year.
