40|$|Establishing the {{magnitude}} and frequency of floods within upland catchments {{on the basis of}} short-term gauged runoff records is crucially dependent upon {{the extent to which the}} record is truly representative. In the case of the River Dee, upstream of Crathie in Aberdeenshire, gauged discharge records are limited in length. Although the middle Dee has been gauged since 1929, the gauge within the upper catchment has only ten years of record. Thus, reliable estimates of the return intervals of extreme floods for this part of the Dee can only be obtained by using a variety of historical sources to extend the <b>flood</b> <b>series.</b> Long-term rainfall records, where available, provide a valuable independent check on the reconstructed <b>flood</b> <b>series.</b> Such rainfall records, when analysed in terms of {{the magnitude}}, frequency and duration of major events, should, in general terms, correspond with the <b>flood</b> <b>series.</b> In this paper, the recurrence interval of extreme rainfalls of varying magnitude and duration in upper Deeside is estimated by extreme value analysis of the annual maximum series. The frequency of rainfall events above varying thresholds is also assessed. The existence of climatic fluctuations giving highly variable recurrence intervals for rainfall events of the same magnitude is demonstrated. Finally, the seasonality of frequent flood-producing storms is analysed. Patterns observed within the rainfall record are compared with those previously established within the historic <b>flood</b> <b>series</b> to substantiate and augment the flood record. ...|$|E

40|$|The {{standard}} assumption in {{flood frequency}} analysis is that annual peak flows are independent events. Hydrologists pay {{little attention to}} the serial correlation of flood peak series in flood frequency analysis because standard statistical tests for independence usually do not reject the null hypothesis of serial independence at the 90 % or 95 % confidence level for most rivers. This study was undertaken to investigate the validity of this assumption with regard to Canadian rivers by statistically analyzing the short-term and long-term dependence of annual peak flows. Ninety stationary <b>flood</b> <b>series</b> of Canadian rivers were tested by eleven tests for short-term dependence and one test for long-term dependence. The results show that about 18 %(at 5 % level) - 28 %(at 10 % level) <b>flood</b> <b>series</b> passed the short-term dependence tests but failed the long-term dependence test. The presence of long term serial correlation in <b>flood</b> <b>series</b> is evident and can not be disregarded in flood risk analysis. [...] Modeling annual flow series by considering the effect of both short-term and long-term dependence was then discussed. This study considered two newly developed models: harmonic analysis of cumulative departures, and the mixed-noise model. These two models were further developed and a comparison between them was made. Finally, the effect of long-term dependence on flood risk analysis is evaluated using Monte Carlo simulations. It was found that neglecting serial correlation could cause considerable uncertainty in the estimated flood risk...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: Prerequisites for {{deriving}} satisfactory {{estimates of}} design floods are the objective detection and modification of outliers/inliers at desired levels of significance and a versatile technique of flood frequency analysis. Objective detection and modification of outliers/inliers {{has been accomplished}} by developing statistics for outliers/inliers at both {{the high and low}} end of the flood spectrum. An inlier at the high end is defined as a variate (gener ated or observed) which is lower than indicated by the trend {{of the rest of the}} data, and an inlier at the low end is higher than indicated by the rest of the data. The tests developed in this study can be used to check for outliers/inliers at different levels of significance, such as 0. 01, 0. 05, 0. 1, 0. 2, 0. 3, and 0. 4.

40|$|This {{study was}} {{designed}} to examine the adjustments of stream channel morphology to urbanization along Paint Branch Creek and its tributaries (Upper Paint Branch and Little Paint Branch Creek). The hypothesis being tested is that the channels have adjusted to accommodate the increased bankfull discharges caused by progressive urbanization of the watershed. My project consisted of two parts, the first part was to use USGS streamflow data to evaluate the increase in the mean of the annual <b>flood</b> <b>series</b> and the bankfull (Q 1. 5) discharge in the Anacostia River compared with nearby non-urban reference streams. The second part of the project involved measuring current channel morphology (channel cross sections, gradient, and grain size and calculating channel width, depth, and area) at sites along the Paint Branch Stream System that were measured ten years ago. Both the 1995 and 2006 morphological data were compared with channel morphology relationships determined from a regional reference data set of non-urbanized streams (Prestegaard et al., 2001) to determine channel changes from the non-urban to urban conditions.

For the purpose of flood risk management, this study estimated the average recurrence interval (ARI) and peak flows associated with the ARI based on the distributions of annual peak flow. The flood frequency analysis was performed for <b>flood</b> <b>series</b> data of Segamat River, at Sg. Segamat gauging station (Site 2528414) for the years 1960 – 2011. Five distribution models, namely Generalized Pareto, Generalized Extreme Value, Log-Pearson 3, Log-Normal (3 P) and Weibull (3 P) were tested for the 52 years <b>flood</b> <b>series</b> data. The goodness of fit test (GOF) of Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) was used to evaluate and estimate the bestfitted distribution.

40|$|International audienceThe {{management}} of flood risk {{seems to be}} facing a daunting paradox. Despite increasingly effective risk knowledge tools and the efforts of international institutions to place risk reduction {{at the top of}} the agenda, the cost of disasters continues to increase. It is also increasingly difficult to avoid the urbanization or development of potential flood zones. The fundamental issue involves determining the conditions necessary for efficient prevention by focusing on adaptability to risk, which implies coping with the risk of flooding rather than directly fighting against it or simply ignoring it. This second volume of the <b>Floods</b> <b>series</b> of books explores existing policies and tools which mitigate the impact of flooding: the construction of protective structures, the reduction of vulnerability, land use planning, the improvement of crisis management, etc. The closing chapters focus on the question of adaptation through post-flood reconstruction, integrating disaster risk reduction measures, e. g. through resilient urbanism...|$|R

The upper Hanjiang {{is also one of}} the most flood-prone rivers in China. This paper explores the process of extreme floods by using multivariate analysis to characterize flood and precipitation event data in combination, for historical data and simulated data from global climate models. The results suggested that the generalized extreme value and Gamma models better simulated the extreme precipitation and flood volume sequence than the generalized Pareto model for the annual maximum series, while the generalized Pareto distribution model was the best-fit model for peaks over threshold series. For the two-dimensional joint distributions of precipitation and flood volume, the Frank Copula was preferred in simulation of the annual maximum <b>flood</b> <b>series</b> whereas the Gumbel Copula was the most appropriate function to simulate the points over threshold <b>flood</b> <b>series.</b> We concluded that, compared with the traditional univariate approach, multivariate statistical analysis produced flood estimates that were more physically based and statistically sound and carried lower risk for flood design purposes...|$|E

40|$|Flood sediments characterise the {{alluvial}} record, {{though the}} series of floods these deposits record is a complex one because of variable deposition in different alluvial subenvironments. To date, flood sequences in the UK have been analysed using upland boulder berms, vertically accreting fills in contracting channels, cutoff fills and flood basin deposits. These cover different timespans ranging from c. 100 ? 300 yr (berms and channel fills) to a limited set of the most extreme of Holocene events. Collation of future site data may allow record splicing to generate longer or more continuous series. Other sequences are potentially available from alternative depositional environments, including lateral accretion deposits, slackwater sediments in bedrock channels and palaeochannels. However, these have not produced UK results as yet, and there are reasons for them being less useful in this environment than {{has proved to be}} the case elsewhere. Finally, a new approach to overbank sedimentation sequences is presented. Analysing such deposits in much greater detail than hitherto gives <b>flood</b> <b>series</b> on a millennial timescale, and it is suggested that the prevalence of such sediments on UK floodplains may allow longer and more complete <b>flood</b> <b>series</b> data to be obtained than has otherwise been possible.

40|$|Abstract. The {{theory of}} record-breaking {{processes}} offers {{a framework for}} understanding extreme events which is nearly independent {{of the theory of}} extremes. The mathematical theory of record-breaking processes is applied to the problem of identifying nonstationarity in hydrological records. A record flood event is simply an event which exceeds all previous events. The probability distribution and first four moments of the number of record events in an n-year period, R, are derived for a serially independent process. The variance of estimates of the mean, standard deviation, and coefficient of variation R is also derived. In addition, approximate confidence intervals are derived for the mean number of record-breaking events in a region with spatially correlated <b>flood</b> <b>series.</b> Using these results, in combination with 1571 flood records in the United States, we document that the average number of record breaking flood events over n-year periods ranging from [10, 80] behaved as if the annual <b>flood</b> <b>series</b> were serially independent for all regions of the United States. However, when spatial correlation of the flood records is ignored, {{as is the case in}} many previous studies, it appears as if flood records are not serially independent in the western and Midwestern regions of the United States. These results emphasize the importance of accounting for the spatial correlation structure of hydrologic records when performing regional hypothesis tests. 1...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{considers}} several {{models for}} representing {{the distribution of}} the annual maximum flood at a site when the annual maximum <b>flood</b> <b>series</b> corresponds to the maximum of two distinct annual <b>flood</b> <b>series.</b> A joint model, that incorporates correlation between the two series, is theoretically correct. However, in most cases, a simpler mixture model essentially does as well. The simple mixture model, which assumes independence between the two distinct series, is a special case for the joint model; it provided a good description of {{the distribution of the}} annual maxima above some critical probability, when in our case the risk due to rainfall floods dominated. That critical probability is determined by the distribution of each population, and also the correlation between them. A method recommended by William Kirby uses only the events recorded in the annual maximum series to develop conditional flood risk models for both processes; the resulting flood risk model for the annual maximum series is a weighted function of the two. When compared to use of a single 3 -parameter lognormal model, the Kirby Method usually provide more precise estimates of flood quantiles. Overall, for many cases and for extreme quantiles, both the just-rainfall model that models only rainfall, and the mixture model that assumes rainfall and snowmelt maxima are independent, provide flood quantile estimates that are as accurate as use of the full Joint model...|$|E
