5|$|Planescape: Torment is {{primarily}} story-driven and combat is not prominently featured. The protagonist, known as The Nameless One, is an immortal {{who has lived}} many lives but has <b>forgotten</b> <b>all</b> about them, even forgetting his own name. The game focuses on his journey through the city of Sigil and other planes to reclaim his memories of these previous lives. Several characters in the game may join The Nameless One on his journey, {{and most of these}} characters have encountered him in the past or have been influenced by his actions in some way.|$|E

A man dressed in a black, hooded coat appears and directs Sora towards a massive {{fortress}} called Castle Oblivion. Upon entering, the travelers realize that they have <b>forgotten</b> <b>all</b> of their abilities. The hooded man explains that the deeper {{they go into the}} castle, the more memories they will lose, but they will also uncover new memories in the process. He creates a deck of cards made from Sora's and his friends' memories, and tells them that everything they encounter in this castle will be based on their memories.|$|E
25|$|In the {{subsequent}} case of Chng Wei Meng v. Public Prosecutor (2002), the appellant was given, pursuant to section 42A of the Road Traffic Act ("RTA"), {{a written warning}} stating {{that he might be}} disqualified from driving if he failed to attend court for a traffic offence. An oral warning to the same effect was also given to the appellant. Before the appellant was arrested under section 43(4) of the RTA for driving while under disqualification, he was disqualified from driving after failing to attend court. The appellant appealed against his conviction, claiming inter alia {{that there had been a}} breach of natural justice because the written warning and the requirements of section 42A(1)(d) of the RTA were discrepant, since the section provided that he would be disqualified from driving for failure to attend court. The appellant also submitted that he had not been served a disqualification notice. Chief Justice Yong Pung How dismissed the appeal. He stated that in order for the notice to be vitiated by non-compliance with section 42A, the non-compliance had to be fundamental, substantive and material in nature. However, this was not so on the facts of the case. In addition, to establish a breach of natural justice, the applicant had to prove that he had suffered substantial prejudice or injustice as a result of the non-compliance with section 42A since there is no such thing in law as a technical breach of natural justice. However, on the facts there had been little prejudice caused to the appellant since he had read the notice and knew the consequences of not attending court, but had promptly <b>forgotten</b> <b>all</b> about it.|$|E

500|$|After escaping, Kamo {{met up with}} Lenin in Paris, and was distressed to {{hear that}} a [...] "rupture had occurred" [...] between Lenin, Bogdanov, and Krasin. Kamo told Lenin about his arrest and how he had {{simulated}} insanity while in prison. [...] After leaving Paris, Kamo eventually met up with Krasin and planned another armed robbery. Kamo was caught before the robbery took place and was put on trial in Tiflis in 1913 for his exploits including the Tiflis bank robbery. This time, Kamo did not feign insanity while imprisoned, but he did pretend that he had <b>forgotten</b> <b>all</b> that happened {{to him when he}} was previously [...] "insane". The trial was brief and Kamo was given four death sentences.|$|E

The troop special was immediately accepted by Gretna Junction, so Tinsley pulled [...] "off" [...] his Up home signal to allow the troop train to run forward.|$|E

Their fear of death threatens to make everything they do feel meaningless, and it also sends them running after God—looking for some reassurance that there is something beyond the familiar, everyday world with 'its signals and buildings and cars and bricks.'"

2500|$|Lawrence biographer Sheridan Morley interviewed du Maurier for his 1981 book Gertrude Lawrence. Du Maurier {{was quoted}} as saying she called Lawrence by the {{nickname}} [...] "Cinders," [...] short for Cinderella. Either while negotiating to appear in September Tide or rehearsing it, Lawrence stayed in [...] "a flat in London somewhere," [...] according to what du Maurier told Morley decades later. Boiling water in her tea kettle for a visitor was stressful for Lawrence. Du Maurier also told the biographer that she had <b>forgotten</b> <b>all</b> the dialogue she had written for September Tide and that shortly before her interview with Morley she had [...] "been searching my shelves for a copy of the play. ... I cannot remember how Cinders looked, what she wore, far less what she said." [...] Du Maurier's contribution to the Morley biography of Lawrence consists of little more than that.|$|E

The Queen tells Hamlet, the altar awaits him, here is his betrothed. Hamlet looks away, without replying. The Queen persists. Hamlet thinks of Polonius' perfidy (Hamlet: Sur moi tombent les cieux avant que cet hymen funeste s'accomplisse! [...] "May the heavens fall upon me before such an ill-fated {{marriage}} can be solemnized!"). Ophélie asks what he means. He responds: Non! Allez dans un cloître, allez, Ophélie. [...] "No!

Ophélie despairs (Ophélie: Cet amor promis à genoux [...] "The love that on your knees you swore"). She returns her ring to him (Theme of Hamlet's Love), and Hamlet weeps. The Queen turns to Ophélie saying he weeps, he remembers, he loves you. Hamlet cries out again (Hamlet: Non! Allez dans un cloître, allez, Ophélie [...] "No! Go to a nunnery, go, Ophélie"). Each continues to express conflicting feelings in an extended ensemble. Ophélie leaves, hiding her tears.|$|E
