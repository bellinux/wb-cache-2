5|$|The {{necessary}} certificates {{were granted}} on 10 April, {{and the first}} trial run was made the following day. Ordinary service started on 25 April, though without the <b>dining</b> <b>car.</b> The initial price was NOK 422, and travel time was 5 hours 45 minutes. The trains have four cars, of which three are regular open seating, and one is a <b>dining</b> <b>car.</b> From 15 June, full service was introduced. The company stated that the service {{was meant to be}} more luxurious than with SJ, including wider seating (three instead of four abreast) and a wooden interior. The company markets the service as all first-class seating. The trains also had Wi-Fi. After the full service was introduced, the price increased to NOK 593. By July, Ofotbanen had still not found a locomotive for the second train, and was still operating only a single round service. Passenger numbers were at 35 per departure, not close to the capacity of 84, or the necessary annual 100,000 needed to make a profit.|$|E
5|$|As {{the cars}} arrived in 1978 and 1979 Amtrak {{employed}} them on short-haul routes radiating from Chicago. The first coaches entered regular service on February 26, 1979, running from Chicago to Milwaukee. The coaches, {{led by an}} EMD F40PH locomotive, displaced the regular Turboliner equipment. The equipment continued to operate on the run for several weeks. The Illini and Shawnee trains received Superliner coaches soon after; the first Superliner <b>dining</b> <b>car</b> ran on the Shawnee as a lounge.|$|E
5|$|By {{the early}} 1950s, the B had {{combined}} through cars for the Capitol Limited, the Columbian (#25), and the Ambassador (#19) into one train between New York and Washington. Beyond Washington, the three trains then operated separately, with several additional Washington-to-Chicago Pullman sleeping cars {{added to the}} Capitol Limited, along with a twin-unit <b>dining</b> <b>car,</b> two Strata-Dome dome cars, club car, and a flat-end observation car.|$|E
25|$|The railway's {{operations}} were advanced by {{standards of the}} time, having comfortable carriages, <b>dining</b> <b>cars,</b> electric lighting, and telephone communication between stations. By comparison, the government-operated network did not introduce <b>dining</b> <b>cars</b> until 1902.|$|R

50|$|ACF {{produced}} {{three types}} of domes for the Union Pacific: coaches, <b>dining</b> <b>cars,</b> and observation <b>cars.</b> The ten <b>dining</b> <b>cars</b> were unique: the only dome <b>dining</b> <b>cars</b> (aside from GM's Train of Tomorrow) ever built for a United States railroad. The cars featured seating on both levels: 18 in the upper level in booths and 18 in the lower level at tables. Also located on the lower level was a kitchen, pantry, and private dining room with seating for 10. A dumbwaiter connected the two levels.|$|R
5|$|George Harrison met his wife-to-be, Patricia Boyd, {{on the set}} {{when she}} made a brief (uncredited) {{appearance}} {{as one of the}} schoolgirls on the train. His initial overtures to her were spurned because she had a boyfriend at the time but he persisted and they were married within 18 months. The girl with Boyd in the <b>dining</b> <b>car</b> scene is Prudence Bury. Phil Collins, within a few years a band member of Genesis, was an uncredited schoolboy extra in the concert audience.|$|E
5|$|The Capitol Limited {{received}} streamlined heavyweight {{sleeping and}} dining cars in 1938. A typical consist included the following: baggage-dormitory, 8-section 1-drawing room 1-compartment sleeping car, <b>dining</b> <b>car,</b> {{three to four}} 8-section 5-double bedroom sleeping cars, 14-section sleeping car, two 12-section 1-drawing room sleeping cars, and a sleeper-buffet-lounge with a drawing room and three compartments. In 1941 these cars were augmented by several lightweight 10-roomette 5-bedroom sleeping cars.|$|E
5|$|Pullman-Standard {{built the}} {{entirety}} of the equipment pool for the 1938 lightweight re-equipping, with the exception of two dining cars which were rebuilt in the Pennsylvania's Altoona shops. The equipment delivered included eight 18-roomette sleeping cars; two sleeper-bar-lounges; four 4-compartment, 2-drawing room, 4-double bedroom sleeping cars; two 13-double bedroom sleeping cars; and two View series sleeper-buffet-lounge-observation cars. The <b>dining</b> <b>car</b> seated 24 at tables (in both 1x1 and 2x2 configurations) and featured a small bar at one end with seating for two. The sleeper-bar-lounge included a secretary's room, barber shop, shower-bath, and a bar/lounge with both booth and chair seating.|$|E

5|$|Service on the Lake Shore Limited {{consists}} of reserved coach seating and Viewliner sleepers, {{as well as}} amenities like a <b>dining</b> <b>car</b> service. As the Erie station is not equipped with a ticket office, nor Amtrak's Quik-Trak ticket machines, all tickets from the station have to be pre-paid. The station is, however, equipped with a waiting room and public restrooms. The Erie Metropolitan Transit Authority's Route 20A, the downtown circulator, provides service between the station and downtown Erie. The bus only operates, however, at the scheduled arrival time of the eastbound Lake Shore Limited.|$|E
5|$|The Union Express is a {{passenger}} train service between the Norwegian and Swedish capitals of Oslo and Stockholm. The service was a cooperation between Ofotbanen and the Swedish company Scandinavian Railway. In competition with SJ, it operates one daily round trip, in 5 hours 45 minutes, between Oslo and Stockholm, using renovated stock from the 1960s. While {{more expensive than}} SJ, the service aims at being more luxurious. One of the four cars is a traditional <b>dining</b> <b>car,</b> and the company markets the product as a first-class only service. Each train has a capacity of 84 riders, and provides perks such as Wi-Fi and 2+1 seating. The service has not operated since 7 October 2008, due to the bankruptcy in Ofotbanen, and SJ no longer being willing to rent out locomotives to the company.|$|E

50|$|One {{change was}} the {{elimination}} of the <b>dining</b> <b>cars</b> in the 1960s, replaced by Automat cars that offered food from vending machines instead of made-to-order meals in the <b>dining</b> <b>cars,</b> cutting the cost of the train's dining crew. This continued until 1971 when Amtrak took over and extended the route north to Portland and Seattle.|$|R

25|$|The U76/U70 {{tram line}} between the German cities of Düsseldorf and Krefeld offers a Bistrowagen (<b>dining</b> <b>car</b> in German), where {{passengers}} can order drinks and snacks. This practise comes from the early 20th Century, when interurban trams conveyed a <b>dining</b> <b>car.</b> Despite the introduction of modern tram units, 4 trams still have a Bistrowagen and operate every weekday.|$|E
25|$|The {{biggest threat}} {{to the lives of}} the tsar and his family, however, came not from terrorists, but from a {{derailment}} of the imperial train in the fall of 1888. Maria and her family had been at lunch in the <b>dining</b> <b>car</b> when the train jumped the tracks and slid down an embankment, causing the roof of the <b>dining</b> <b>car</b> to nearly cave in on them.|$|E

50|$|On the {{specialised}} coaching side, {{this second}} phase of design was represented mainly by <b>dining</b> <b>cars</b> of which 36 were built which made amends for the relative lack of new <b>dining</b> <b>cars</b> {{during the first six}} years of the LMS. Like the 57 ft vestibule thirds mentioned earlier, these diners were steel panelled with painted simulated beading.|$|R

25|$|The train's {{speed at}} the time of {{derailment}} was an estimated 65–70km/h. The F 1200 locomotive was the first to derail, sliding down the embankment until it came to rest on its right side on the road below. The cars between the locomotive and the <b>dining</b> <b>car</b> were completely destroyed while the <b>dining</b> <b>car</b> partially slid down the embankment towards the road, ending up at a 45° angle on the slope between the embankment and the road. The last two cars remained standing on the tracks.|$|E
25|$|These {{cars are}} often pulled in {{addition}} to the <b>dining</b> <b>car,</b> and on very long trains {{in addition to}} one or more snack or café cars.|$|E

25|$|The train {{originally}} offered just 52 first-class sleeping berths and 96 second-class sleeping berths. However, {{the train}} was limited to 144 passengers, as this was the number that could be serviced by three sittings in the 48-seat <b>dining</b> <b>car.</b>|$|E
