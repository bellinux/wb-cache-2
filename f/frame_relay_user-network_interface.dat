When <b>Frame</b> <b>Relay</b> detects an error, it simply drops the offending packet. <b>Frame</b> <b>Relay</b> uses the concept of shared access and relies on a technique referred to as [...] "best-effort", whereby error-correction practically does not exist and practically no guarantee of reliable data delivery occurs. <b>Frame</b> <b>Relay</b> provides an industry-standard encapsulation, utilizing the strengths of high-speed, packet-switched technology able to service multiple virtual circuits and protocols between connected devices, such as two routers.Although <b>Frame</b> <b>Relay</b> became very popular in North America, it was never very popular in Europe.

40|$|<b>Frame</b> <b>relay</b> {{networks}} {{reduce the}} cost of transmission lines and equipment and improve network performance and response time. Designed for transmission lines with a low error rate, <b>frame</b> <b>relay</b> networks provide minimal internal checking, and consequently, error detection and recovery is implemented in the attached user systems. The <b>Frame</b> <b>Relay</b> Bearer Service was developed specifically as a data service to handle highvolume, bursty traffic by means of high-speed packet transmission, minimal network delay, and efficient use of network bandwidth. The frame protocol supports the data transfer phase of the Service; the <b>frame</b> <b>relay</b> header and the local management interface are sources of congestion avoidance mechanisms. Current implementations include the StrataCom IPX FastPacket digital networking system, which provides the <b>frame</b> <b>relay</b> network, and Digital's DECNIS 500 / 600 and DEC WANrouter 100 / 500 software for attaching user equipment. Today's communications networks are built using high-speed digital trunks that inherently provide high throughput, minimal delay, and a very low error rate. Such transmission networks supply highly reliable service without the overhead of error control functions. <b>Frame</b> <b>relay</b> is a packet-mode transmission network service that exploits these network characteristics by minimizing the amount of error detection and recovery performed inside the network. This paper explains the nature of the <b>Frame</b> <b>Relay</b> Bearer Service (FRBS) and provides details of the interface defined for attaching user equipment. The implications for higher-layer protocols in the user equipment are also considered. Following this tutorial, the paper introduces some current implementations. As an example of equipment used to construct a <b>frame</b> <b>relay</b> network, the technology deployed by the StrataCom integrated packet exchange (IPX) FastPacket range of equipment is described.
