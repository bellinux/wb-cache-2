5|$|Burton next {{argued that}} his {{prosecution}} violated the Double Jeopardy Clause. Specifically, Burton argued that his acquittal {{on the third}} count in the first trial barred <b>his</b> <b>conviction</b> on the third and seventh counts in the second trial.

After <b>his</b> <b>conviction</b> was finally affirmed, a {{resolution}} to expel Burton from the Senate was referred to the United States Senate Committee on Privileges and Elections on May 22, 1906.

5|$|Kylsart appealed <b>his</b> <b>conviction</b> on count 3 and was bailed {{pending the}} appeal.
