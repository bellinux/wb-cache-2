25|$|According to this theory, {{the onset}} of the {{southwest}} monsoon is driven by the shift of the subtropical westerly jet north from over the plains of India toward the Tibetan Plateau. This shift is due to the intense heating of the plateau during the summer months. The northward shift is not a slow and gradual process, as expected for most changes in weather pattern. The primary cause {{is believed to be the}} height of the Himalayas. As the Tibetan Plateau <b>heats</b> <b>up,</b> the low <b>pressure</b> created over it pulls the westerly jet north. Because of the lofty Himalayas, the westerly jet's movement is inhibited. But with continuous dropping pressure, sufficient force is created for the movement of the westerly jet across the Himalayas after a significant period. As such, the shift of the jet is sudden and abrupt, causing the bursting of southwest monsoon rains onto the Indian plains. The reverse shift happens for the northeast monsoon.|$|R
50|$|Sunshine <b>heats</b> <b>up</b> both {{water in}} rivers and land surface. However, water needs {{much more time}} to <b>heating</b> <b>up</b> than land does and {{atmosphere}} air is not heated by solar rays because it is diathermanous. It is <b>heat</b> coming <b>up</b> from soil and river waters, which in turn <b>heat</b> <b>up</b> the atmosphere. Therefore, difference of temperature between land and rivers is at its maximum at 10 a.m. (more or less). At that time, the land surface reflects heat to the atmosphere, making air ascend and condense, forming clouds, while water is still <b>heating</b> <b>up</b> and, thus, there is not outcoming heat to the atmosphere.|$|R

40|$|A new {{technique}} for {{the realization of}} complex three dimensional 3 D structures in polymer materials is presented. The described process can be applied for the fabrication of 3 D structured foils {{as well as for}} 3 D structured polymer parts using a replica molding process. In the first step, the foil is structured by Hot Embossing. This structured foil is then blown into a structured mold by pressure at high temperature, using a thermoforming process. The thermoforming process is realized in an especially designed tool, where different mold inserts can be applied. In the thermoforming process this tool, containing the mold insert and the structured foil is <b>heated</b> <b>up</b> and a <b>pressure</b> is applied which assures, that the foil covers the structured mold insert. Due to parameter optimization, high pattern fidelity can be achieved. As structures a porefield with a pore diameter of 500 nm and lines and spaces with a width of 1. 6 lm were used. Besides a Moth Eye structure with a period of 280 nm and a blazed grating with a period of 1 lm and a blazed angle of 15 were imprinted and blown into the structured mold. The results show, that this process can be used to fabricate 3 D structured foils with good structure fidelity. Besides the structured foils, additional poly dimethylsiloxane PDMS replications can be made out of this foils. These PDMS replications are used as stamps in a replica molding process. A micro fluidic system containing hydrophobic and hydrophilic channels was created using this proces...|$|R
