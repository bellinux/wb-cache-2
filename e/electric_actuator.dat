40|$|The {{oil and gas}} {{equipment}} and <b>electric</b> <b>actuators</b> in particular frequently perform in various operational modes and under dynamic environmental conditions. These factors affect equipment reliability measures in a vague, uncertain way. To eliminate the ambiguity, reliability model parameters could be defined as fuzzy numbers. We suggest a technique that allows constructing fundamental fuzzy-valued performance reliability measures based on an analysis of <b>electric</b> <b>actuators</b> failure data {{in accordance with the}} amount of work, completed before the failure, instead of failure time. Also, this paper provides a computation example of fuzzy-valued reliability and hazard rate functions, assuming Kumaraswamy complementary Weibull geometric distribution as a lifetime (reliability) model for <b>electric</b> <b>actuators...</b>|$|R

Because of their shape, when the latches are in the proper position, pressure on the door does not place torque on the latches that could cause them to open, and actually further seats them on the pins. Normally the latches are opened and closed by a screw jack powered by an <b>electric</b> <b>actuator</b> motor.|$|E

40|$|Currently, the {{situation}} of the powernet in cars is characterized by the increasing power demand for additional comfort features and the ongoing process to gain fuel efficiency by the replacement of mechanically driven <b>actuators</b> through <b>electric</b> <b>actuators.</b> Examples are a heated steering wheel or a electric power steering. Furthermore, new features like an electric valve train or x-by-wire systems with <b>electric</b> <b>actuators</b> need a high budget powernet, capable of high dynamic loads. By increasing the voltage from 14 V to 42 V, the conditions for the use of e. g. an integrated starter generator, which can also be used for recuperation, are set. This article is not meant to question the new 42 V standard, the intention {{of this article is to}} inform about the possible emergence of arcing between two electric conductors or contacts, the safety risk and possible passive arcing avoidance mechanism, focused on low-and mid-power arcs...|$|R
5000|$|A {{spring is}} used to provide defined {{behavior}} {{in the case of}} loss of power. This is important in safety related incidents and is sometimes the driving factor in specifications. An example of loss of power is when the air compressor (the main source of compressed air that provides the fluid for the actuator to move) shuts down. If there is a spring inside of the actuator, it will force the valve open or closed and will keep it in that position while power is restored. An actuator may be specified [...] "fail open" [...] or [...] "fail close" [...] to describe its behavior. In the case of an <b>electric</b> <b>actuator,</b> losing power will keep the valve stationary unless there is a back up power supply.|$|E

5000|$|The Magnum SOHC version, code ECH, {{develops}} [...] SAE (111 kW) at 6500 rpm, and 135 lb·ft (184 N·m) {{of torque}} at 4800 rpm. Chief differences between this version and the A588 include a cast aluminum SOHC cylinder head that more easily passes exhaust gases than the base engine, a camshaft that is optimized for higher engine speeds, a factory welded exhaust short-tube header {{instead of a}} cast exhaust manifold, and a two-piece intake manifold. This manifold features unequal-length intake runners that are switched by an <b>electric</b> <b>actuator</b> that controls butterfly-type valves in the shorter intake runners. The longer runners are always open, and provide a mild supercharging effect due to their length between 3000 rpm and 4800 rpm. The shorter runners, open from 4800 rpm to redline at wide-open throttle, also provide a tuned resonance effect due to their length. The shorter runners are also opened at wide-open throttle below 3000 rpm to provide an intake path to each cylinder that is as free-flowing as possible.|$|E
40|$|Experts {{all over}} the world agree on the {{potential}} of legged locomotion for difficult terrain. As of now, there are several point on which legged machines have significantly lower performance than than wheeled or tracked ones. First of all, they have a higher number of actuators which makes them heavier. This is related to the mentioned ”low payload to weight ratio” with is also related to the fact that any additional weight has to be supported by the legs. This (active) supporting of mass, together with the additional movement in the legs compared to wheels and tracks also results in higher energy consumption. This energy consumption is further increased {{due to the fact that}} energy is lost at every impact (say foot touch-down), which also increases the mechanical stress on the entire structure. In this work a novel, integral approach is presented which minimises the use of <b>electric</b> <b>actuators</b> and enables absorption and re-use of energy involved at impact. By do- ing this, the number and size of <b>electric</b> <b>actuators</b> is reduced, which reduces the weight. Furthermore, by offer- ing intrinsically passive gravity compensation, the pay- load capabilities is potentially increased. By minimising the energy flow trough <b>electric</b> <b>actuators,</b> one of the most significant energetic losses is minimised. Our approach uses a single spring to couple two degrees of freedom and therefore energy exchange between two CPA (Controlled Passive Actuation) actuated degrees of freedom...|$|R
40|$|The thesis {{examines}} a way {{in which}} the performance of the robot <b>electric</b> <b>actuators</b> can be precisely and accurately force controlled where {{there is a need for}} maintaining a stable specified contact force with an external environment. It describes the advantages of the proposed research, which eliminates the need for any external sensors and solely depends on the precise torque control of electric motors. The aim of the research is thus the development of a software based control system and then a proposal for possible inclusion of this control philosophy in existing range of automated manufacturing techniques. The primary aim of the research is to introduce force controlled behaviour in the <b>electric</b> <b>actuators</b> when the robot interacts with the environment, by measuring and controlling the contact forces between them. A software control system is developed and implemented on a robot gantry manipulator to follow two dimensional contours without the explicit geometrical knowledge of those contours. The torque signatures from the <b>electric</b> <b>actuators</b> are monitored and maintained within a desired force band. The secondary aim is the optimal design of the software controller structure. Experiments are performed and the mathematical model is validated against conventional Proportional Integral Derivative (PID) control. Fuzzy control is introduced in the software architecture to incorporate a sophisticated control. Investigation is carried out with the combination of PID and Fuzzy logic which depend on the geometrical complexity of the external environment to achieve the expected results...|$|R

Power steering can also be engineered to provide some artificial feedback of forces acting on the steered wheels.|$|R
