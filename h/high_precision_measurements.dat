A few of the issues speaker and driver designers must confront are distortion, radiation lobing, phase effects, off-axis response, and crossover artifacts. Designers can use an anechoic chamber to ensure the speaker can be measured independently of room effects, or any of several electronic techniques that, to some extent, substitute for such chambers. Some developers eschew anechoic chambers in favor of specific standardized room setups intended to simulate real-life listening conditions.|$|E

40|$|The {{performance}} of polymer electrolyte fuel cells {{is influenced by}} moisture control in their gas diffusion layer (GDL).

We have previously proposed that measurement of the effective oxygen diffusivity in a GDL containing moisture can be achieved using a galvanic cell oxygen absorber and demonstrated this to be an effective technique for the measurement of microporous media.

In this study, <b>high</b> <b>precision</b> <b>measurement</b> of the oxygen diffusivity in a GDL was developed further by analysis of the major error factors and modification of the measurement apparatus configuration.

It is often said that an interferometer achieves {{the effect of a}} telescope the size of the distance between the apertures; this is only true in the limited sense of angular resolution.

5000|$|The {{final results}} were inconclusive, for {{triangulation}} was {{inferior to the}} precision of astronomical measurements, but the survey {{paved the way for}} all future work in terms of <b>high</b> <b>precision</b> <b>measurements</b> of length and angle, together with the techniques of calculating on an ellipsoidal surface. In his final report, published posthumously, Roy once again pressed for the extension of the survey to the rest of Britain. His successors would oblige. As Master of the Board of Ordnance (from 1782), Charles Lennox, 3rd Duke of Richmond, viewed Roy's work with great interest, At the same time he was acutely aware that Britain, lacking a national survey, was falling behind the standards of many other European countries. Moreover, the renewed threat of French invasion made him alarmed at the lack of accurate maps, particularly of the southern counties. The catalyst for action was the sudden availability of a new improved Ramsden theodolite which had been intended for the East India Company. The purchase of this instrument on 21 June 1791 by the Board is taken as the inauguration of the Ordnance Survey. The very next day Richmond appointed Isaac Dalby as its first employee, with a brief to extend Roy's survey. In the following month Richmond appointed William Mudge and Edward Williams, the latter as the first superintendent of the survey.|$|E
