40|$|Abstract: The {{effect of}} uniform {{vertical}} magnetic {{field on the}} onset of surface tension driven convection in a relatively <b>hotter</b> <b>or</b> cooler layer of electrically conducting liquid is considered. A Fourier series method is used to obtain the characteristic value equation for the Marangoni number M. When instability sets in as stationary convection it is established numerically that both the critical Marangoni number and wave number increase with intensity of the magnetic field, irrespective of whether the liquid layer is relatively <b>hotter</b> <b>or</b> cooler. The asymptotic behavior of the critical Marangoni number for large values of the Chandrasekhar number is also obtained...|$|R

5|$|Different {{climatic factors}} {{influence}} {{the climate of}} Buenos Aires. The semi–permanent South Atlantic High influences its climate throughout the year by bringing in moist winds from the northeast, which bring most of the precipitation to {{the city in the}} form of frontal systems during winter or storms produced by cyclogenesis in autumn and winter. The hot temperatures and high insolation in the summer months form a low pressure system called the Chaco Low over northern Argentina, generating a pressure gradient that brings moist easterly winds to the city – because of this, summer is the rainiest season. In contrast, this low pressure system weakens in the winter, which combined with strong southerly winds results in a drier season due to weaker easterly winds. Being located in the Pampas, Buenos Aires has variable weather due to the passage of contrasting air mass – the cold, dry Pampero from the south and warm, humid tropical air from the north. The coastal location results in a strong maritime influence, causing extreme temperatures (<b>hot</b> <b>or</b> cold) to be rare.|$|E
