Growing up, I admired the kind of beautiful glamorous woman—from Brigitte Bardot to Grace Kelly—who doesn't seem to be around much anymore. I think it's time {{for that kind of}} glamor to come back. In pop music generally, people have one image. You get pigeonholed. I'm lucky {{enough to be able to}} change and still be accepted. If you think about it, that's what they do in the movies; play a part, change characters, looks and attitudes. <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> it to entertain myself." ...|$|E
2500|$|Morrison {{has stated}} that he was {{uncertain}} whether his Superman and the version featured in All Star Batman & Robin are the same due to the dramatic time {{differences between the two}} books: [...] "I don’t know if it would have worked. For me, <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> see it all taking place in the same world even though they seem like very different characters. Frank Miller is doing Batman {{at the beginning of his}} career and I am doing Superman at the very end of his life, in the years beyond All Star Batman. But it could be the same character as far as I am concerned. That’s where they may have ended up." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] said Jimmy, reflectively, [...] "if it's the {{one that}} was Barbara last time, <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>I</b> <b>do.</b> You have been finding out the rest of it since you met her at the ranch? She was up yonder ten minutes ago." ...|$|E
6000|$|Lemuel {{knew that}} his hour had come, if ever it were to come, and he said hoarsely: [...] "I <b>guess</b> if <b>I</b> made you take cold that day, it wasn't all <b>I</b> <b>did.</b> <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> worse than that." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, I'm all right," [...] she replied. [...] "And you've come to--your wound's healed; but you've been sick. Fever, <b>I</b> <b>guess.</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> all <b>I</b> could." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "She wouldn't {{go in the}} parlour, {{but come}} right out here in her fine clothes. I told her I didn't think she belonged in a kitchen--but <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> her an injustice," [...] said Euphrasia, slowly.|$|R
6000|$|ANNA--[Deeply {{moved and}} troubled--forcing a {{trembling}} laugh.] So {{you told him}} that, Mat? No wonder he was mad. [Forcing out the words.] Well, maybe it's true, Mat. Maybe I do. I been thinking and thinking--I didn't want to, Mat, I'll own up to that--I tried to cut it out--but--[She laughs helplessly.] I guess I can't help it anyhow. So <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>I</b> <b>do,</b> Mat. [Then with a sudden joyous defiance.] Sure I do! What's the use of kidding myself different? Sure I love you, Mat! ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{must be that}} I do, though I {{never had}} such a thought. Wheat is so wonderful. No one can guess who does not know it!... The clean, plump grain, the sowing on fallow ground, the long wait, the first tender green, and the change day by day to the deep waving fields of gold--then the harvest, hot, noisy, smoky, full of dust and chaff, and the great combine-harvesters with thirty-four horses. Oh! <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> love it all.... I worked in a Spokane flour-mill, too, just to learn how flour is made. There {{is nothing in the}} world so white, so clean, so pure as flour made from the wheat of these hills!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Why, dog-gone it, Miss Mason, you're right--in a way. I've built {{hundreds}} of houses up there, and I remember I was proud and {{glad to see}} them go up. I'm proud now, when I remember them. And there was Ophir--the most God-forsaken moose-pasture of a creek you ever laid eyes on. I made that into the big Ophir. Why, I ran the water in there from the Rinkabilly, eighty miles away. They all said I couldn't, but I did it, and I did it by myself. The dam and the flume cost me four million. But {{you should have seen}} that Ophir--power plants, electric lights, and {{hundreds of}} men on the pay-roll, working night and day. <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> get an inkling of what you mean by making a thing. I made Ophir, and by God, she was a sure hummer--I beg your pardon. I didn't mean to cuss. But that Ophir!--I sure am proud of her now, just as the last time I laid eyes on her." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That's true." [...] Mrs. Lander brightened and warmed again. [...] "I <b>guess</b> it's all right. <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>I</b> <b>done</b> right, and <b>I</b> {{got to be}} satisfied. I presume I {{could get}} the consul to make me a will any time." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That was {{the major}} motif," [...] he hurriedly explained, [...] "the big underrunning motif, the cosmic and {{universal}} thing. I {{tried to make it}} keep time with the story itself, which was only superficial after all. I was on the right scent, but <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> it badly. <b>I</b> <b>did</b> not succeed in suggesting what I was driving at. But I'll learn in time." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Guess I do!" [...] was the snorted-out reply. [...] "They {{came around}} to my place yesterday, and stole my apples and pears, and talked sassy to my darter an' the hired man. I saw 'em, but they ran, away before I could git my hands on 'em. I vowed I take 'em down a peg when I met 'em, an' <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>I</b> <b>done</b> it," [...] added the old farmer, with evident satisfaction.|$|R
5000|$|None of {{the teens}} showed any remorse or {{apologized for the}} murder. Paul Sweeney, the victim's father, {{addressed}} Domenic Coia, saying, [...] "Look at me, Domenic, with your evil eyes". Domenic Coia responded, [...] "I never thought I had evil eyes, but <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>I</b> <b>do.</b> And I'm cool." [...] The judge, in denying defense counsel's motion for a sentence that could allow for parole, said: [...] "There is a level of inhumanity that exists in these facts. This was a totally depraved act." ...|$|E

5000|$|... "Well, {{throughout}} my career I {{have turned to}} mythological figures, who went away from conformity and the collected {{to make up their}} own mind about stuff, to put it {{in a bit of a}} mundane way. It's more of a scenario and also very much an escape from conformity and the collected. Nietzsche has been a huge influence on me, in particular during the years that I've been doing my solo stuff. He was a hermit, he wrote about hermits and <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> this in a kind of hermit-like way myself. I am here in my hermit’s cave, a studio, doing my stuff alone. On different levels it just reflects aspects of the album itself and probably aspects of how I see things and how I work." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes,"--he {{took it from}} her--"the biggest {{that has}} been thrown into the arena for quite a while. <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>I</b> can <b>do</b> with it for that." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "So I callated," [...] he cried, {{still holding}} Wetherell's {{hand in a}} mild, but persuasive grip. [...] "So <b>I</b> callated. <b>Guess</b> <b>I</b> <b>done</b> you an injustice, Will." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, {{that was}} what <b>I</b> was thinking. <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>I</b> sha'n't <b>do</b> it, though. <b>I</b> sh'd neva have the courage." [...] Clementina laughed and then fell rather seriously silent again.|$|R
5000|$|Henderson {{adopted an}} exaggerated crouch as his batting stance, which reduced his strike zone without sacrificing much power. Sportswriter Jim Murray {{described}} Henderson's strike zone as being [...] "smaller than Hitler's heart". In 1982, {{he described his}} approach to Sports Illustrated: I found that if I squatted down real low at the plate... I could see the ball better. I also knew it threw the pitcher off. I found that I could put my weight on my back foot and still turn my hips on the swing. I'm down so low I don't {{have much of a}} strike zone. Sometimes, walking so much even gets me mad. Last year Ed Ott of the Angels got so frustrated because the umpire was calling balls that would've been strikes on anybody else that he stood up and shouted at me, [...] "Stand up and hit like a man." [...] <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> that to people.|$|E
5000|$|In December 1985, Madonna {{starred in}} the film Shanghai Surprise, where she toned down her appearance, {{inspired}} again by Marilyn Monroe. Madonna held the look for the [...] "Live to Tell" [...] video. In it her make-up was pale and subtle, her shoulder-length hair was wavy and golden blond, and her clothes consisted of a simple 1930s-style floral dress. In an interview with music critic Stephen Holden from The New York Times, she commented about her new look:"After a while I got sick of wearing tons of jewelry—I wanted to clean myself off. I see my new look as very innocent and feminine and unadorned. It makes me feel good. Growing up, I admired the kind of beautiful glamorous woman—from Brigitte Bardot to Grace Kelly—who doesn't seem to be around much anymore. I think it's time {{for that kind of}} glamor to come back.

5000|$|Updike {{had meant}} to call the novel, [...] "in honor of its amplitude," [...] Couples and Houses and Days. To an interviewer's {{question}} about the difficulty of writing scenes about sex, Updike replied: [...] "They were no harder than landscapes {{and a little more}} interesting. It's wonderful the way people in bed talk, the sense of voices and the sense of warmth, so that as a writer you become kind of warm also. The book is, of course, not about sex as such: It's about sex as the emergent religion, as the only thing left." [...] And in the Paris Review [...] "Art of Fiction" [...] interview series, he discussed the disappearance of his novel's hero into the story's happy ending:There's also a way, though, I should say in which, with the destruction of the church, with the removal of Piet's guilt, he becomes insignificant. He becomes merely a name in the last paragraph: he becomes a satisfied person and in a sense dies. In other words, a person who has what he wants, a satisfied person, a content person, ceases to be a person. Unfallen Adam is an ape. Yes, <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> feel that. I feel that to be a person is to be in a situation of tension, is to be in a dialectical situation. A truly adjusted person is not a person at all—just an animal with clothes on or a statistic. So that it's a happy ending, with this 'but' at the end.|$|E

60|$|The Duchess. Thankee, miss. You see, thar's no one {{the boy has}} {{any claim}} on but me, and I ain't the proper person to bring him up. <b>I</b> <b>did</b> allow {{to send him to}} 'Frisco, last year; but when I heerd talk that a schoolma'am was comin' up, and you did, and he sorter tuk to ye natril from the first, <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> well to keep him yer. For, oh, miss, he loves ye so much; and, if you could hear him talk in his purty way, ye wouldn't refuse him anything.|$|R
6000|$|Bolton sighed deeply, and {{continued}} in a strain whose diffusiveness at last became perceptible to Miss Kilburn through her own humiliation. [...] "There's some in every community that's bound to complain, I don't {{care what you}} do to accommodate 'em; and what <b>I</b> <b>done,</b> <b>I</b> <b>done</b> as much to stop their clack as anything, and give him the right sort of a start off, an' <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>I</b> <b>did.</b> But Mis' Bolton she didn't know but what you'd look at it in the light of a libbutty, and I didn't know but what you would think I no business to done it." ...|$|R
40|$|In lieu of an abstract, {{below is}} the essay 2 ̆ 7 s first paragraph. 2 ̆ 2 I guess I can 2 ̆ 7 t {{remember}} {{the time when the}} sands of the earth and the sands of the sky met, toppling over one another. Landwaves undulated before me, rolling out humps for me to bounce on, speckled in green and yellow, and green again. I heard the music of the hills laud my name awaiting my triumphant return. I heard bumblebees like windmills, never wanting any less than to come to my hand and lead me off. Most of all, the sky weighed me down. It weighed on me like magnet sucking and pushing me at the same time. <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> remember the first time {{the weight of the world}} destroyed a little May field all in the name of progress. I remember it well. 2 ̆...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, no, <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>I</b> can <b>do</b> it. But <b>I</b> haven't tramped {{that far}} for sixteen years. Most {{of the sports}} go by boat. But <b>I</b> can <b>do</b> it if you say so--I guess." [...] Joe walked away in sadness.|$|R
6000|$|... "A man {{come along}} an' {{he wanted to}} paint that on there, and I let 'im; and it's my barn anyway. <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>I</b> can <b>do</b> what I'm a min' to with it," [...] he ended defiantly; but his eyes wavered.|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't care," [...] I answered. [...] "I'm feeling sort of lazy today, and I'm {{just going}} to ride down the balloon. It's my balloon and <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>I</b> can <b>do</b> as <b>I</b> please about it. And, anyway, we're almost down now." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, well, <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>I</b> could <b>do</b> that, too, if I had to," [...] {{answered}} the youngest Rover boy quickly. [...] "But the roads {{from here to}} Chicago are pretty good, they tell me, so I don't think we'd have many punctures or blow-outs." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "What {{can they}} be going to do now?" [...] Tom said. [...] "Some fresh piece of homage, <b>I</b> should <b>guess.</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> wish they would leave us alone. It is {{annoying}} enough {{to be treated as}} a god, without being disturbed by these constant worshippings." ...|$|R
5000|$|Neil Storey, Dragon's drummer, died of {{a heroin}} {{overdose}} in September 1976. The group considered disbanding but continued with Kerry Jacobson on drums as their single, [...] "This Time", reached the Kent Music Report top 40 singles chart. Hunter later detailed their performance style, [...] "its hard to describe Dragon because what the songs were and what the band did live on stage were so opposed to each other, it was quite schizo really. We had nice happy songs but mock rape scenes happening on stage, people vomiting into buckets. <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> approach performing in a living theatre way. I {{used to think that}} if people wanted something then give it to them and let them decide if they like it or not." ...|$|R
5000|$|As {{a result}} of Disco Demolition Night, Dahl {{attained}} national recognition and his popularity increased significantly. He established a syndicate and the Steve and Garry show began airing in Detroit and Milwaukee, where it performed well. However, in February 1981, WLUP fired Dahl, citing [...] "continued assaults on community standards". [...] "It {{was going on in}} El Paso and Los Angeles, like, on Monday, and on Friday they fired me," [...] Dahl later said. Meier was offered the opportunity to continue the show by himself, but he refused. I always used to get ticked off when I would get lumped in with Howard Stern as being a shock jock. <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> shock people, but <b>I</b> <b>did</b> it unintentionally. It comes out of who I am. Steve Dahl ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I got {{something}} that can get us into the circus. Maybe someday we can even have a circus of our own. We could be the biggest circus-fellows in the world.

5000|$|... "I {{was a bit}} {{surprised}} to go early {{because there are a}} lot of great players here, but I'm a pretty happy kid right now," [...] Ward said. [...] "I was hoping to go in the first round but you never know what's going to happen. It was a pretty open field and <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> Devils liked me. They flew me to Toronto for a physical test and an interview month and <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> well." [...] Devils general manager Lou Lamoriello was impressed with Ward's potential to be yet another hard-hitting New Jersey blueliner, stating [...] "We liked Ward's potential as far as his upside is concerned," [...] Lamoriello said. [...] "We have guys like Scott Stevens and Ken Daneyko on our team and this young man like them. He's strong now, he's mean, and he's got skills." ...|$|R
