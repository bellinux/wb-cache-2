In the US, their first Christmas album, Christmas Portrait, became a seasonal favorite, and was certified platinum. Richard later said that the album should have been released as Karen's first solo album. It was shortly followed by the television special [...] During the sessions, several non-Christmas songs were recorded such as [...] "Where <b>Do</b> <b>I</b> <b>Go</b> from Here", which was not released until after Karen's death.|$|E
2500|$|She {{absorbed the}} work of John of the Cross, spiritual reading {{uncommon}} at the time, especially for such a young nun. [...] "Oh! what insights I have gained from the works of our holy father, St. John of the Cross! When I was seventeen and eighteen, I had no other spiritual nourishment..." [...] She felt a kinship with this classic writer of the Carmelite Order (though nothing seems to have drawn her to the writing of Teresa of Avila), and with enthusiasm she read his works, The Ascent of Mount Carmel, [...] the Way of Purification, the Spiritual Canticle, [...] the Living Flame of Love. Passages from these writings are woven into everything she herself said and wrote. The fear of God, which she found in certain sisters, paralyzed her. [...] "My nature is such that fear makes me recoil, with LOVE not only <b>do</b> <b>I</b> <b>go</b> forward, I fly." ...|$|E
5000|$|... "Simple" [...] {{forms of}} verbs are those {{appearing}} in constructions not marked for either progressive or perfect aspect (<b>I</b> <b>go,</b> <b>I</b> <b>dont</b> <b>go,</b> <b>I</b> <b>went,</b> <b>I</b> will <b>go,</b> etc., but not Im going or <b>I</b> have <b>gone).</b>|$|R

2500|$|For {{the second}} Christmas season {{following}} Karen's death, Richard constructed a new Carpenters' Christmas album entitled An Old-Fashioned Christmas, using outtakes from Christmas Portrait and recording new material around it. Richard released his first solo album, Time, in 1987, sharing vocals between himself, Dionne Warwick and Dusty Springfield. The track [...] "When Time Was All He Had" [...] was {{a tribute to}} Karen. The same year, Todd Haynes released the short film Superstar: The Karen Carpenter Story, which featured Barbie dolls playing the main cast. Richard objected to music {{being used in the}} film without his consent, and served an injunction in 1990 that prevented it from being shown. On January 1, 1989, the television special The Karen Carpenter Story premiered on CBS, topping the ratings for that week. It included the previously unreleased [...] "You're the One" [...] and [...] "Where <b>Do</b> <b>I</b> <b>Go</b> from Here" [...] in its soundtrack, which were released on the album Lovelines later that year.|$|E
2500|$|In 1922, {{she began}} rehearsing a new play by Sacha Guitry, called Un Sujet de Roman. On {{the night of}} the dress rehearsal, she collapsed, going into a coma for an hour, then awakened with the words, [...] "when <b>do</b> <b>I</b> <b>go</b> on?" [...] She recuperated for several months, with her {{condition}} improving; she began preparing for a new role as Cleopatra in Rodogune by Corneille, and agreed to make a new film by Sasha Guitry called La Voyante, for a payment of 10,000 francs a day. She was too weak to travel, so a room in her house on Boulevard Pereire was set up as a film studio, with scenery, lights, and cameras. However, on 21 March 1923, she collapsed again, and never recovered. She died from uremia on the evening of 26 March 1923. Newspaper reports stated she died [...] "peacefully, without suffering, in the arms of her son". The following day, 30,000 people attended her funeral to pay their respects, and an enormous crowd followed her casket from the Church of Saint-Francoise-de-Sales to Pere Lachaise Cemetery, pausing for a minute of silence outside her theater. The inscription on her tombstone is the name [...] "Bernhardt".|$|E

My fixed desire was to seek and find a good and intelligent woman, whom I could love: a contrast to the fury I left at Thornfield--" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And I," [...] said Mrs. Horncastle, with a quivering lip,--"where <b>do</b> <b>I</b> <b>go</b> {{when you}} have settled this? Back to my past again? Back to my husbandless, childless life?" ...|$|E

6000|$|... "But nothing <b>did.</b> <b>I</b> <b>went</b> {{up to see}} the sunset. I didn't meet a soul." [...] She ended abruptly, for she did {{not wish}} to retrace her sad reverie.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, but {{the point}} is"--his voice became acute--"why <b>did</b> <b>I</b> <b>go</b> making money and let Behrens in? Why {{generally}} and {{in all sorts of}} things does Behrens come in?..." ...|$|R
