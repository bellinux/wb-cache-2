J. W. ]. Loudness perception by human infants and animals can be studied {{under the assumption that}} sounds of equal loudness elicit equal reaction times (RTs). Simple RTs of a harbour porpoise to narrowband frequency-modulated signals were measured using a behavioural method and an RT sensor based on infrared light. Equal latency contours, which connect equal RTs across frequencies, for reference values of 150 - 200 ms (10 ms intervals) were derived from median RTs to 1 s signals with sound pressure levels (SPLs) of 59 - 168 dB re. 1 μPa and centre frequencies of 0. 5, 1, 2, 4, 16, 31. 5, 63, 80 and 125 kHz. The higher the signal level was above the hearing threshold of the harbour porpoise, the quicker the animal responded to the stimulus (median RT 98 - 522 ms). Equal latency contours roughly paralleled the hearing threshold at relatively low sensation levels (higher RTs). The difference in shape between the hearing threshold and the equal latency contours was more pronounced at higher levels (lower RTs); a flattening of the contours occurred for frequencies below 63 kHz. Relationships of the equal latency contour levels with the hearing threshold were used to create smoothed functions assumed to be representative of <b>equal</b> <b>loudness</b> <b>contours.</b> Auditory weighting functions were derived from these smoothed functions that may be used to predict perceived levels and correlated noise effects in the harbour porpoise, at least until actual <b>equal</b> <b>loudness</b> <b>contours</b> become available.

40|$|Although {{their basic}} concept is similar, the current {{standards}} for the calculation of loudness, ANSI S 3. 4 - 2007 and DIN 45631 (1991), produce significantly different results for many kinds of sounds. While their values for pure tones {{can be explained by}} the <b>equal</b> <b>loudness</b> <b>contours</b> of their times, they also show huge discrepancies for broadband sounds. For this reason, extended psychoacoustic experiments were made in order to find target values for the loudness of pink noise at various levels. Furthermore, the performance of the algorithms was investigated by subjective tests on several technical sounds at a large scale of loudness levels. In all cases, the method of adjustment was used. The results suggest that DIN 45631 (1991) predicts loudness very well. Its estimations are within the interquartile range of the subjective evaluations...|$|E

40|$|Summary Methods used to {{quantify}} annoyance due to environmental noise {{are described as}} well as the results of an analysis of vehicle passby recordings. Most methods currently used {{to quantify}} the impact of noise are based on average or maximum A-weighted sound pressure levels. It is known that the loudness of a sound is the primary driver in annoyance; however, it is also known that other sound characteristics, such as the presence of tones, fluctuations, spectral balance and impulsiveness, also impact annoyance. While A-weighted sound pressure levels may be strongly correlated to loudness levels for some sets of sounds, {{the relationship between the two}} can change if the characteristics of the sounds in the set change. Recently developed models of loudness incorporate many characteristics of the human hearing system including changes in response behavior with increased level, frequency masking and temporal masking. The A-weighting is derived from the 40 phon <b>equal</b> <b>loudness</b> <b>contour</b> and is only truly appropriate for analysis of relatively quiet sounds.

40|$|The {{domestic}} cat is {{the primary}} physiological model of loudness coding and recruitment. At present, there are no published descriptions of loudness perception in this species. This study used a reaction time task to characterize loudness perception in six behaviorally trained cats. The psychophysical approach {{was based on the}} assumption that sounds of equal loudness elicit responses of equal latency. The resulting equal latency contours reproduced well-known features of human <b>equal</b> <b>loudness</b> <b>contours.</b> At the completion of normal baseline measures, the cats were exposed to intense sound to investigate the behavioral correlates of loudness recruitment, the abnormally rapid growth of loudness that is commonly associated with hearing loss. Observed recruitment effects were similar in magnitude to those that have been reported in hearing-impaired humans. Linear hearing aid amplification is known to improve speech intelligibility but also exacerbate recruitment in impaired listeners. The effects of speech spectra and amplification on recruitment were explored by measuring the growth of loudness for natural and amplified vowels before and after sound exposure. Vowels produced more recruitment than tones, and the effect was exacerbated by the selective amplification of formant structure. These findings support the adequacy of the domestic cat as a model system for future investigations of the auditory processes that underlie loudness perception, recruitment, and hearing aid design...|$|E

Moreover, the lower frequency components of sound wave {{is the major}} concern for sound wave at this frequency range are the hardest to attenuate. The purpose {{of this research is}} to quantify the propagation and attenuation characteristics of sound wave at audible low frequency range. The project was kicked off by fabricating a new wedges design for the existing anechoic chamber in Makmal Penyelidikan Akustik, Fakulti Kejuruteraan Elektrik, UTMSkudai, Johor. Once the anechoic room was completely refurbished, measurement of reverberation time (RT 60), sound pressure level (SPL) and SPL attenuation per doubling of distance were conducted.

To {{bridge the gap between}} both approaches, this contribution reviews various steps towards a loudness model that predicts categorical loudness (in categorical units, CU) for normal and hearing-impaired listeners for arbitrary sounds. It uses a (modified) classical loudness model for stationary signals to derive the loudness in sone and a nonlinear transformation from sone to CU. This transformation is approximated by a cubic polynomial equation wich is derived from categorical loudness data of 84 normal-hearing subjects. The model parameters are further set to predict the standard isophones that are in good agreement with the <b>equal</b> <b>loudness</b> level <b>contours</b> derived from categorical loudness data. Also, the model predicts the loudness functions near threshold both for normal and hearing-impaired listeners and can be extended to predict duration-dependent loudness perception. Since categorical loudness can be measured more easily and directly than loudness in sone, the current modelling approach can be experimentally tested and can be used in various applications, such as, e. g. hearing aid processing and fitting procedures...|$|R

40|$|Although {{the human}} hearing system is very complex, several models exist that explain {{parts of the}} hearing system.

The perceived frequency balance of music varies with the listening level. This is especially noticeable at low listening levels, where frequencies below 500 Hz seem attenuated.

The center frequencies were 750, 1500, and 3000 Hz and noise bandwidths from 5 to 1620 Hz were used. The level of the reference pure tone was 30, 50, or 70 dB.

This maximum level difference decreased with increasing reference level. A similar effect was found when the level differences were derived from data of an additional categorical loudness scaling experiment.

Subjects were tested 9 – 14 times over one week before an ear plug, producing a nominal attenuation of 21 dB (at both frequencies), was placed in one ear. Subjects wore the plug continuously for a further week, and were tested daily during this period, with the plug in place. After unplugging, subjects were tested less frequently for one final week.

The data indicate that suprathreshold modulation depths and intensity increments, perceived as equivalent across levels, follow a pattern resembling Weber’s law for noise and the “near miss” to Weber’s law for a tone. The effect of a high-pass noise was largely consistent with that observed for AM and increment detection.

40|$|The {{influence}} of different properties of speech-like signals on loudness was investigated by measuring levels at <b>equal</b> <b>loudness</b> in normal-hearing listeners for 22 speech-like stimuli using categorical loudness scaling and an adaptive matching procedure. Eight of the stimuli, {{referred to as}} unprocessed stimuli, had the same speech-like long-term spectrum, but differed in other speech-related properties, ranging from a stationary noise over speech-modulated signals to real intelligible and unintelligible speech. The other stimuli were designed to investigate the {{influence of}} severe modifications of speech-related properties due to spectral filtering, reverberation, compression, and expansion on loudness. In general, results were similar for both measurement methods and revealed only small effects of temporal modulations on loudness perception, and no influence of intelligibility or reverberation. Even severe modifications of the stimuli by highpass-filtering and expansion did not affect levels at <b>equal</b> <b>loudness.</b> Only lowpass-filtering significantly decreased loudness and compression significantly increased loudness. The experimental {{results indicate that the}} long-term spectrum of speech has a major influence on loudness while other properties of speech only have a minor contribution.
