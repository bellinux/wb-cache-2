40|$|Density {{functional}} {{theory is}} used to study {{one of the most}} successful routes to the production of synthetic fuels, the conversion of methanol to gasoline (MTG process) with an acidic zeolite. With our calculations we have determined transition states and adsorption complexes of reactants, intermediates, and products as well as the corresponding activation barriers and adsorption energies of the numerous reactions involved in such a process. Bronsted acid catalyzed methanol dehydration to dimethyl ether is the first step of the MTG process. Two different mechanisms are possible. One proceeds via an associative interaction between two methanol molecules, generating directly dimethyl ether, while the other proceeds via a methoxy surface species intermediate. The presence of water lowers the activation barrier of the last mechanism by more than 50 kJ/mol. Our calculations suggest that ethanol and <b>ethyl</b> <b>methyl</b> <b>ether</b> are the first formed species with a C-C bond. Several different mechanisms for those reactions have been studied. The activation barriers involved in such reactions are of the order of 300 kJ/mol for both ethanol and <b>ethyl</b> <b>methyl</b> <b>ether.</b> Without coadsorbed water, the activation barriers are 60 kJ/mol higher. In a following step ethylene is formed from alcohol or ether. Those reactions are very fast due to a very low activation barrier.

Two different reaction pathways were studied. In the first, methanol adsorption and surface methoxy species formation are the initial elementary steps for this reaction. Subsequent dimethyl ether formation by reaction of methanol with the surface methoxy species takes place. The second path involves the simultaneous adsorption and activation of two methanol molecules with formation of dimethyl ether and water in one step. The latter appears to be the preferred route. Additionally, carbon-carbon bond formation from the activation of methanol or dimethyl ether molecules by the surface methoxy groups was studied.

The idea was to design an anticancer DDS that can utilize both the enhanced permeability and retention-effect (EPR-effect) and the lower extracellular pH values that solid tumors display.

40|$|A {{series of}} {{environmental}} chamber experiments and computer model calculations {{were carried out}} to assess the atmospheric ozone formation potentials of selected organic compounds representative of those emitted from consumer products. This information is needed to reduce the uncertainties of ozone reactivity scales for stationary source emissions. The compounds studied were cyclohexane, cyclohexane, isopropyl alcohol, the three octanol isomers, diethyl <b>ether,</b> <b>methyl</b> <b>ethyl</b> ketone, cyclohexanone, <b>methyl</b> isobutyl ketone, <b>ethyl</b> acetate, <b>methyl</b> isobutyrate, n-butyl acetate, and propylene glycol <b>methyl</b> <b>ether</b> acetate. "Incremental reactivity" experiments were carried out {{to determine the effect}} of each compound on O 3 formation, NO oxidation and integrated OH radical levels when added to irradiations of reactive organic gas (ROG) - NO x mixtures representing simplified polluted urban atmospheres. Differing ROG surrogates and ROG/NO x ratios were employed to test how the impacts of the compounds vary with chemical conditions. In addition, single compound - NO x irradiations were carried out for the various ketones, OH radical rate constants were measured for the octanol isomers and propylene glycol <b>methyl</b> <b>ether</b> acetate, and the yields of the C 8 carbonyl products were determined for each of the octanol isomers. The results of these experiments were used in the development and testing of the SAPRC- 99 mechanism that is documented in detail in a separate report (Carter, 2000). The data obtained, in conjunction with results of industry-funded studies of related compounds, has resulted in significantly reduced uncertainties in estimates of ozone impacts of the wide variety of oxygenated compounds present in consumer product emissions inventories. However, uncertainties still remain, [...] ...|$|R
