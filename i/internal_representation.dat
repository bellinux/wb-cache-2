5|$|More recently, {{research}} at the Duke Lemur Center {{has shown that the}} ring-tailed lemur can organize sequences in memory and retrieve ordered sequences without language. The experimental design demonstrated that the lemurs were using <b>internal</b> <b>representation</b> of the sequence to guide their responses and not simply following a trained sequence, where one item in the sequence cues the selection of the next. But this is not the limit of the ring-tailed lemur's reasoning skills. Another study, performed at the Myakka City Lemur Reserve, suggests that this species along with several other closely related lemur species understand simple arithmetic operations.|$|E

25|$|When {{individuals}} assimilate new information, they incorporate it into {{an already}} existing framework without changing that framework. This may occur when individuals' experiences are aligned with their <b>internal</b> <b>representations</b> of the world, but may also occur as a failure to change a faulty understanding; for example, they may not notice events, may misunderstand input from others, or may decide that an event is a fluke and is therefore unimportant as information about the world. In contrast, when individuals' experiences contradict their <b>internal</b> <b>representations,</b> they may change {{their perceptions of the}} experiences to fit their <b>internal</b> <b>representations.</b>|$|R
30|$|A related {{approach}} is conjoint measurement, in which <b>internal</b> <b>representations</b> are inferred from comparative responses (e.g., Krantz, Luce, Suppes & Tversky, 1971; Tversky, 1967).

25|$|Negative priming is {{believed}} to {{play a crucial role}} in attention and memory retrieval processes. When stimuli are perceived through the senses, all the stimuli are encoded within the brain, where each stimulus has its own <b>internal</b> <b>representation.</b> In this perceiving process, some of the stimuli receive more attention than others. Similarly, only some of them are stored in short-term memory. Negative priming is highly related to the selective nature of attention and memory.|$|E
25|$|A {{null pointer}} is a pointer in a {{computer}} program that does not point to any object or function. In C, the integer constant 0 is converted into the null pointer at compile time when it appears in a pointer context, and so 0 is a standard way {{to refer to the}} null pointer in code. However, the <b>internal</b> <b>representation</b> of the null pointer may be any bit pattern (possibly different values for different data types).|$|E
25|$|Memory is {{required}} in order to process and integrate both melodic and rhythmic aspects of music. Studies suggest that there is a rich interconnection between the right temporal gyrus and frontal cortical areas for working memory in music appreciation. This connection between the temporal and frontal regions of the brain is extremely important since these regions play critical roles in music processing. Changes in the temporal areas of the amusic brain are most likely associated with deficits in pitch perception and other musical characteristics, while changes in the frontal areas are potentially related to deficits in cognitive processing aspects, such as memory, that are needed for musical discrimination tasks. Memory is also concerned with the recognition and <b>internal</b> <b>representation</b> of tunes, which help to identify familiar songs and confer the ability to sing tunes in one's head. The activation of the superior temporal region and left inferior temporal and frontal areas is responsible for the recognition of familiar songs, and the right auditory cortex (a perceptual mechanism) is involved in the <b>internal</b> <b>representation</b> of tunes. These findings suggest that any abnormalities and/or injuries to these regions of the brain could facilitate amusia.|$|E
40|$|Facial {{expressions}} {{have long}} been considered the "universal language of emotion". Yet consistent cultural differences in the recognition of facial expressions contradict such notions (e. g., R. E. Jack, C. Blais, C. Scheepers, P. G. Schyns, & R. Caldara, 2009). Rather, culture—as an intricate system of social concepts and beliefs—could generate different expectations (i. e., <b>internal</b> <b>representations)</b> of facial expression signals. To investigate, they used a powerful psychophysical technique (reverse correlation) to estimate the observer-specific <b>internal</b> <b>representations</b> of the 6 basic facial expressions of emotion (i. e., happy, surprise, fear, disgust, anger, and sad) in two culturally distinct groups (i. e., Western Caucasian [WC] and East Asian [EA]). Using complementary statistical image analyses, cultural specificity was directly revealed in these representations. Specifically, whereas WC <b>internal</b> <b>representations</b> predominantly featured the eyebrows and mouth, EA <b>internal</b> <b>representations</b> showed a preference for expressive information in the eye region. Closer inspection of the EA observer preference revealed a surprising feature: changes of gaze direction, shown primarily among the EA group. For the first time, it is revealed directly that culture can finely shape the <b>internal</b> <b>representations</b> of common facial expressions of emotion, challenging notions of a biologically hardwired "universal language of emotion"...|$|R

40|$|We {{advance a}} {{hypothesis}} that creativity has evolved with evolution of <b>internal</b> <b>representations,</b> possibly from amniotes to primates, and further in human cultural evolution. Representations separated sensing from acting and gave "internal room" for creativity. To see (or perform any sensing), creatures with <b>internal</b> <b>representations</b> had to modify these representations to fit sensor signals. Therefore the knowledge instinct, KI, {{the drive to}} fit representations to the world, had to evolve along with <b>internal</b> <b>representations.</b> Until primates, it remained simple, without language <b>internal</b> <b>representations</b> could not evolve from perceptions to abstract representations, and abstract thoughts were not possible. We consider creative vs. non-creative decision making, and compare KI with Kahneman-Tversky's heuristic thinking.

25|$|The OO {{principle}} {{is that all}} of the functions (and only the functions) that access the <b>internal</b> <b>representation</b> of a type should be encapsulated within the type definition. C++ supports this (via member functions and friend functions), but does not enforce it: the programmer can declare parts or all of the representation of a type to be public, and is allowed to make public entities that {{are not part of the}} representation of the type. Therefore, C++ supports not just OO programming, but other decomposition paradigms, like modular programming.|$|E
25|$|Distractor {{inhibition}} {{model is}} the oldest model that explains the negative priming effect {{as the result of}} selective attention to a target stimulus. When we pay attention to a particular stimulus, we perceive other stimuli surrounding the target as distractors in order to help focus. But when one of those distractors becomes the new target of attention, our response to the target is hampered due to immediate residual inhibition. Selective attention is the ability to respond to a specific object when there are other distractors that also compete for a response. To explain this selective attention, the distractor inhibition model proposes a dual mechanism involving excitation to boost target signal and inhibition to suppress distractors. This inhibition is triggered when there is a mismatch between the internal representations of the target and a distractor. Inhibition of the distractor's <b>internal</b> <b>representation</b> is a way of helping to selectively attend to the target stimulus. This inhibition decays gradually when the stimulus is no longer present to help with the next target. However, if a distractor stimulus is re-encountered as the target, the <b>internal</b> <b>representation</b> of the distractor stimulus may continue to be suppressed because it is too soon for the decay to dissipate already. This {{is referred to as the}} transient residual inhibition. This inhibition also impairs the processing of an appropriate response to the new target stimulus and results in greater reaction time.|$|E
25|$|For example: the floppy {{controller}} circuitry on the Wang PC {{was similar}} to that of the IBM PC but involved enough design differences that PC compatible software attempting to manipulate it directly would fail. Wang's PC emulation hardware would detect I/O and memory operations involving the addresses associated with the floppy controller in the IBM PC and generate an NMI. The NMI handler would immediately be activated (the exception vector having been appropriated during system init to point to ROM routines on the emulation board instead of the NMI routine in the PC BIOS) and would then update an <b>internal</b> <b>representation</b> of the IBM PC floppy controller and manipulate the real controller to reflect its state. Reads were satisfied in a similar way, by forcing an NMI, decoding the machine code indicated by the Instruction Pointer at the time of the fault, and then obtaining the desired info and updating the CPU registers accordingly before resuming the executing program.|$|E

60|$|Two of them {{stand out}} in high relievo beyond the rest. The first {{is a change in}} the <b>internal</b> <b>representation</b> of this country, by {{enlarging}} our number of constituents. The second is an addition to our representatives, by new American members of Parliament. I pass over here all considerations how far such a system will be an improvement of our constitution according to any sound theory. Not that I mean to condemn such speculative inquiries concerning this great object of the national attention. They may tend to clear doubtful points, and possibly may lead, as they have often done, to real improvements. What I object to, is their introduction into a discourse relating to the immediate state of our affairs, and recommending plans of practical government. In this view, I see nothing in them but what is usual with the author; an attempt to raise discontent in the people of England, to balance those discontents which the measures of his friends had already raised in America. What other reason can he have for suggesting, that we are not happy enough to enjoy a sufficient number of voters in England? I believe that most sober thinkers on this subject are rather of opinion, that our fault is on the other side; {{and that it would be}} more in the spirit of our constitution, and more agreeable to the pattern of our best laws, by lessening the number, to add to the weight and independency of our voters. And truly, considering the immense and dangerous charge of elections; the prostitute and daring venality, the corruption of manners, the idleness and profligacy of the lower sort of voters, no prudent man would propose to increase such an evil, if it be, as I fear it is, out of our power to administer to it any remedy. The author proposes nothing further. If he has any improvements that may balance or may lessen this inconvenience, he has thought proper to keep them as usual in his own breast. Since he has been so reserved, I should have wished he had been as cautious with regard to the project itself. First, because he observes justly, that his scheme, however it might improve the platform, can add nothing to the authority of the legislature; much I fear, it will have a contrary operation; for, authority depending on opinion at least as much as on duty, an idea circulated among the people that our constitution is not so perfect as it ought to be, before you are sure of mending it, is a certain method of lessening it in the public opinion. Of this irreverent opinion of Parliament, the author himself complains in one part of his book; and he endeavors to increase it in the other.|$|E

50|$|Against the {{behaviourism}} and the cognitivism of {{the time}} which looked for universal regularities in human psychology, Maze drew on Freud’s theory that attributed primacy and determinism to the biological bases of drives in setting out a framework for individual differences in behavior and cognition, an approach that also was employed to set a foundation for human motivation (Boag, 2008). In regards to the cognitive representationism inherent within ego psychology and object relations theory which implies that <b>internal</b> <b>representations</b> of self must exist as objects, Maze worked to identify logical incoherence in these accounts insofar as the <b>internal</b> <b>representations</b> could only be qualified by the behavior or phenomena they produced. These <b>internal</b> <b>representations</b> then cannot be considered to exist as independent objects at risk of the logical fallacy of reification (Boag, 2007).

40|$|This study {{aimed to}} {{investigate}} teenage mothers’ experiences of motherhood and their <b>internal</b> <b>representations</b> of their infants {{and the relationship}} between them. In addition, this study aimed to investigate whether there was a connection between teenage mothers’ experiences of parenting and their <b>internal</b> <b>representations</b> of their infants {{and the relationship between}} them. Through the use of semi-structured interviews, adapted from the Parent Development Interview and the Working Model of the Child Interview, four teenage mothers from Alexandra were interviewed. The data collected from these interviews was analysed using narrative analysis through the hermeneutic lens of psychoanalytic attachment theory. From the analysis, this study found that teenage mother’s experiences of motherhood were marked by challenge. The two main challenges faced by these young mothers were the tension they experienced between their identities as teenagers and their identities as mothers, and their struggle to provide for their infants and feel like good enough mothers. In addition, this study found that teenage mother’s <b>internal</b> <b>representations</b> of their infants included a representation of both the good baby and the bad baby, but, {{with the exception of one}} mother, their representations tended to remain split and the mothers seemed defended against their representations of the bad baby. In terms of their representations of the relationship between them, this study found that these teenage mothers’ representations of their relationship with their infants was lacking. These representations either consisted of a superficial representation of a good relationship between mother and infant, or no relationship at all. Finally, this study found that teenage mother’s experiences of motherhood and their <b>internal</b> <b>representations</b> of their infants and the relationship between them were connected. A number of factors that were found to influence both their experiences and their <b>internal</b> <b>representations</b> include their own mental states, their memoires of their own childhood and their representations of their caregivers, as well as the levels of social support they received. The study therefore concluded that teenage mothers’ experiences of motherhood and their <b>internal</b> <b>representations</b> of their infants and the relationship between them were connected, however further research is required to establish the causal relationship between these factors...|$|R
