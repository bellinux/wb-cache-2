40|$|Abstract. Safety {{and traffic}} flow of {{production}} facilities also depends upon the reliability of technical security equipment. Gearing in the transmission mechanisms must satisfy the conditions of strength calculation. This calculation consists of checking <b>of</b> the <b>gear</b> teeth on bend and contact. From the stress <b>of</b> <b>gears</b> is show that the basic requirements of the material are high hardness of works surfaces and bending strength. Steels best meet these conditions. Used steel with surface hardness up to 350 HBW, or heat treated steel with hardness of 500 - 650 HBW. The advantage of these materials is the high value of the contact pressure in the tough centre core <b>of</b> the tooth. <b>As</b> a final heat treatment are used surface hardening, cementation and hardening, nitridation and carbo-nitridation. Good properties of heat-treated steels are at the correct thickness of the heat-treated layer of the tooth.

40|$|LTDS and VIBRATEC {{founded the}} Labcom LADAGE (gears {{dynamics}} joint laboratory). One of its {{goals is to}} develop numerical methods and simulation tools for predicting gears dynamics, {{in order to take}} account of multiphysics couplings between internal and external excitations and to follow the evolution of industrial demand towards more and more complex systems. The operation <b>of</b> <b>a</b> combustion engine is such that it generates <b>a</b> cyclic disturbance <b>of</b> the circular motion of the gearbox primary shaft. Coupled with internal excitations, this disturbance can generate losses of contact at the loaded gear pair. Corresponding vibroimpacts regimes are responsible of the gearbox hammering noise. The irregular rotation of the motor is also sufficient for generating loss of contact <b>of</b> unloaded <b>gears,</b> such as idler <b>gears</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> automotive <b>gearbox.</b> Corresponding vibroimpacts regimes are responsible of the gearbox rattle noise. Two different approaches can be retained to describe the nonlinear dynamic behaviour of mechanisms with contact and backlash nonlinearities, depending on the intensity of the vibroimpact pulses and contact duration. Hammering noise For high level pulses, the contact duration of successive vibroimpacts is long. A nonlinear dynamic model is introduced, taking into account both the gear backlash and the contact stiffness nonlinearities. Solving the equations of motion requires the implementation of specific methods dedicated to nonlinear problems. For example, the finite difference method is used in order to obtain the periodic solutions. They are followed up according to a parameter control, thanks to a pseudoarc length continuation method. Indeed, this approach has proven very efficient for studying multifrequency excitations. A direct integration time method is also used in order to compare obtained results. Eigenvalues of the monodromy matrix inform us about their loss of local stability and {{about the nature of the}} bifurcations that occur. This first approach is well suited to characterize the hammering noise <b>of</b> <b>a</b> truck timing multistage <b>gear.</b> <b>A</b> large variety <b>of</b> dynamic behaviours have been identified. In addition to periodic responses, pseudoperiodic and chaotic ones are highlighted. Multiple impacts per period of excitation are observed. These nonlinear responses occur at resonances and instability regions. Then, the adding effect of the engine torque fluctuation is considered. The dynamic behaviour <b>of</b> the two-stage <b>gear</b> train becomes more complex. Vibroimpact regimes are observed over <b>a</b> wide range <b>of</b> operating conditions. Rattle noise A second approach is retained for low level pulses. The contact duration of successive vibroimpacts is very short. They are described in a more simple way, using <b>a</b> coefficient <b>of</b> restitution. The dynamic response of the system is built piecewisely by solving the equations of motion for the free flight periods. New initial conditions are introduced after each impact, derived from the dynamic response just before impact. This second approach is particularly well suited to characterize the rattle noise due to nonlinear dynamic behaviour <b>of</b> idle <b>gears</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> automotive <b>gearbox.</b> In addition to the gearbox design parameters and the engine operating conditions, the dynamic response <b>of</b> idle <b>gears</b> depends on the drag torque applied to the idle gear and the coefficient of restitution. They are identified experimentally through implementation of optical encoders in <b>an</b> actual automotive <b>gearbox</b> and the operation <b>of</b> <b>a</b> specific test bench which replicates the automotive power train. Models of the different drag torque sources are validated from analysis of the free damped response of the drivelines. The coefficient of restitution and its probability density function are measured from further experiments under stationary operating conditions. <b>A</b> nonlinear model <b>of</b> the dynamic response <b>of</b> idle <b>gears</b> is built. The key parameters are the dimensionless backlash, the coefficient <b>of</b> restitution and <b>a</b> dimensionless parameter proposed to describe the rattle excitation level. Periodic, pseudoperiodic and chaotic responses including impacts between active flanks and reverse flanks are observed. Experiments under controlled excitation are performed to validate the assumptions, to confirm the ability of the proposed parameter to describe the rattle noise threshold, and to characterize the dynamic behaviour <b>of</b> the idle <b>gear.</b> Predictions are fitted with the drag torque and coefficient of restitution previously identified. Comparisons with measurements demonstrate the ability of the model to predict gear rattle for any idle gear, any gearbox and any operating condition...|$|R

Micropitting damage is one of failure modes commonly observed in wind turbine gearboxes. This article investigates <b>gear</b> micropitting <b>of</b> high-speed stage <b>gears</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> wind turbine <b>gearbox</b> operating under nominal and varying load and speed conditions. Based on the ISO standard <b>of</b> <b>gear</b> micropitting (ISO/TR 15144 - 1 : 2010) and considering the operating load and speed conditions, a theoretical study is carried out to assess the risk <b>of</b> <b>gear</b> micropitting by determining the contact stress, sliding parameter, local contact temperature and lubricant film thickness along the line <b>of</b> action <b>of</b> <b>gear</b> tooth contact. The non-uniform distributions of temperature and lubricant film thickness over the tooth flank are observed due to the conditions of torque and rotational speed variations and sliding contact along the gear tooth flanks. The lubricant film thickness varies along the tooth flank and is at the lowest when the tip <b>of</b> the driving <b>gear</b> engages with the root <b>of</b> the driven <b>gear.</b> The lubricant film thickness increases {{with the increase of}} rotational speed and decreases as torque and sliding increase. It can be concluded that micropitting is most likely to initiate at the addendum <b>of</b> driving <b>gear</b> and the dedendum <b>of</b> driven <b>gear.</b> The lowest film thickness occurs when the torque is high and the rotational speed is at the lowest which may cause direct tooth surface contact.

40|$|To {{succeed in}} a {{demanding}} and competitive market, great attention {{needs to be}} given to the process of product design. Incorporating optimization into the process enables the designer to find high-quality products according to their simulated performance. However, the actual performance may differ from the simulation results due to <b>a</b> variety <b>of</b> uncertainty factors. Robust optimization is commonly used to search for products that are less affected by the anticipated uncertainties. Changeability can improve the robustness <b>of</b> <b>a</b> product, as it allows the product to be adapted to a new configuration whenever the uncertain conditions change. This ability provides the changeable product with <b>an</b> active form <b>of</b> robustness. Several methodologies exist for engineering design of changeable products, none of which includes optimization. This study presents the Active Robust Optimization (ARO) framework that offers the missing tools for optimizing changeable products. A new optimization problem is formulated, named Active Robust Optimization Problem (AROP). The benefit in designing solutions by solving an AROP lies in the realistic manner adaptation is considered when assessing the solutions' performance. The novel methodology can be applied to optimize any product that can be classified as a changeable product, i. e., it can be adjusted by its user during normal operation. This definition applies to <b>a</b> huge variety <b>of</b> applications, ranging from simple products such as fans and heaters, to complex systems such as production halls and transportation systems. The ARO framework is described in this dissertation and its unique features are studied. Its ability to find robust changeable solutions is examined for different sources of uncertainty, robustness criteria and sampling conditions. Additionally, a framework for Active Robust Multi-objective Optimization is developed. This generalisation of ARO itself presents many challenges, not encountered in previous studies. Novel approaches for evaluating and comparing changeable designs comprising multiple objectives are proposed along with algorithms for solving multi-objective AROPs. The framework and associated methodologies are demonstrated on two applications from different fields in engineering design. The first is an adjustable optical table, and the second is the selection <b>of</b> <b>gears</b> in <b>a</b> <b>gearbox...</b>|$|R
