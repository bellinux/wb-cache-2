PSO is a random/stochastic search algorithm designed to find the global optimum. However, PSO needs many evaluations compared to gradient-based optimization. This means PSO increases the analysis costs of structural optimization. One of the methods to reduce computing costs in stochastic optimization is to use approximation techniques. In this work, surrogate models are used, including the response surface method (RSM) and Kriging. When surrogate models are used, there are some errors between exact values and approximated values. These errors decrease {{the reliability of the}} optimum values and discard the realistic approximation of using surrogate models. In this paper, Bayesian statistics is used to obtain more reliable results. To verify and confirm the efficiency of the proposed method using surrogate models and Bayesian statistics for stochastic structural optimization, two numerical examples are optimized, and the optimization of a <b>hub</b> <b>sleeve</b> is demonstrated as a practical problem...|$|E
