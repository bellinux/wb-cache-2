40|$|The {{preliminary}} {{experience of}} the use of a prototype <b>hyperthermia</b> <b>unit</b> (Astro 200) for tumor regression in Howard University Hospital's Department of Radiotherapy is described. The {{purpose of this study was}} to produce homogeneous heat distribution patterns within a 5 -cm cylinder in the middle of a phantom (ground beef) using radio frequency conducted through electrodes implanted in the medium. Homogeneous heat distribution was achieved by finding the optimal spatial distribution of electrodes within the phantom and by sequencing the radio frequency in the electrodes. Monitored observation revealed a steady state homogeneous temperature of 42. 5 °C within a 4 -cm diameter. There was a temperature difference of 0. 5 °C within 1 cm of the periphery...|$|E
40|$|Project (M. S., Electrical and Electronic Engineering) [...] California State University, Sacramento, 2014. Nowadays, {{there are}} {{multiple}} ways to treat and cure cancer. Scientists are doing {{research in this area}} to eradicate cancer without causing harm to patient???s health. Hyperthermia is a method to cure cancer in which body tissue of the affected area is exposed to high temperatures to damage or kill cancer cells. However, hyperthermia is found to be most effective as an adjuvant to conventional treatment therapies such as radiation and chemotherapy. The major target for the project is to increase the effectiveness of heat generation in a typical <b>hyperthermia</b> <b>unit,</b> using improved reflectors, to potentially avoid radiation to the parts of body that are not infected by cancer cells. Temperature measurements were carried out on hyperthermia equipment itself as well as in conjunction with reflector to compare the relative efficiency of the equipment.

40|$|This study {{investigated}} the effect of dynamic exercise in a hot environment on muscle fibre conduction velocity (MFCV) of the knee extensors during a sustained isometric contraction. Seven trained male cyclists (mean [±SD], age, and V_ O 2 max were 35 ± 9. 9 and 57. 4 ± 6. 6 ml kg 1 min 1) cycled for 50 min at 60 % of peak power output in either: (1) 40 C (HOT); or (2) 19 C (NEUTRO); and (3) remained passive in 40 C (PASS). Post-intervention a 100 s maximal sustained isometric contraction (SMC) of the knee extensors was performed. Rectal temperature increased (p < 0. 01) for both HOT and NEUTRO with PASS unchanged and with HOT rising higher (p < 0. 01) than NEUTRO (38. 6 ± 0. 4 vs. 37. 6 ± 0. 4 C). Muscle temperature increased (p < 0. 01) for all three conditions with HOT rising the highest (p < 0. 01) (40. 3 ± 0. 5 vs. 38. 3 ± 0. 3 and 37. 6 ± 1. 3 C for NEUTRO and PASS, respectively). Lactate showed higher accumulation (p < 0. 01) for HOT than NEUTRO (6. 9 ± 2. 3 vs. 4. 2 ± 2. 1 mmol l 1). During SMC the torque, electromyography root mean squared (RMS) and MFCV all significantly (p < 0. 01) declined. Only in HOT did MFCV decline significantly (p < 0. 01) less than torque and RMS (9. 9 ± 6. 2 % vs. 37. 5 ± 17. 8 % and 37. 6 ± 21. 4 %, respectively). In conclusion, during exercise induced <b>hyperthermia,</b> reduced motor <b>unit</b> recruitment as opposed to slower conducting properties of the muscle fibre appears {{to be responsible for}} the greater reduction in torque output...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to clarify whether heat {{preconditioning}} results in less eccentric exercise-induced muscle damage and muscle soreness, and whether the repeated bout effect is enhanced by heat preconditioning prior to eccentric exercise. Nine untrained male volunteers aged 23 ± 3 years participated in this study. Heat preconditioning included treatment with a microwave <b>hyperthermia</b> <b>unit</b> (150 W, 20 min) that was randomly applied to one of the subject's arms (MW); the other arm was used as a control (CON). One day after heat preconditioning, the subjects performed 24 maximal isokinetic eccentric contractions of the elbow flexors at 30 °·s- 1 (ECC 1). One week after ECC 1, the subjects repeated the procedure (ECC 2). After each bout of exercise, maximal voluntary contraction (MVC), range of motion (ROM) of the elbow joint, upper arm circumference, blood creatine kinase (CK) activity and muscle soreness were measured. The subjects experienced both conditions at an interval of 3 weeks. MVC and ROM in the MW were significantly higher than those in the CON (p < 0. 05) for ECC 1; however, the heat preconditioning had no significant effect on upper arm circumference, blood CK activity, or muscle soreness following ECC 1 and ECC 2. Heat preconditioning may protect human skeletal muscle from eccentric exercise-induced muscle damage after a single bout of eccentric exercise but does not appear to promote the repeated bout effect after a second bout of eccentric exercis...|$|E
