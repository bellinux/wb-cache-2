5|$|A Jonline {{is a short}} line used by scuba divers to <b>fasten</b> {{themselves}} to something. The original purpose was to <b>fasten</b> a diver to a shot line during decompression stops in current. The line is typically around 1m (3 feet) long and equipped with a clip at each end. One clip is fastened to the diver's harness, {{and the other is}} used to <b>fasten</b> the line to the anchor line. In current this relieves the diver from holding on to the anchor line during the decompression stop.|$|E
5|$|The diver ascends {{along the}} shotline, and may use it purely {{as a visual}} reference, or can {{hold on to it}} to {{positively}} control depth, or can climb up it hand over hand. A Jonline may be used to <b>fasten</b> a diver to an anchor line or shot line during a decompression stop.|$|E

40|$|A new rivet <b>fastened</b> {{rectangular}} hollow flange channel beam (RHFCB) {{was proposed}} using an intermittently rivet <b>fastening</b> process {{as an alternative}} to welded beams. The rivet <b>fastened</b> RHFCB allows greater section optimisation and flexibility in designing suitable combinations of web and flange widths and thicknesses for many industrial applications. In the industrial applications of rivet <b>fastened</b> RHFCBs as flooring, roofing or modular building systems, their flanges will be <b>fastened</b> to supports, which will provide increased web crippling capacities. However no research has been conducted to investigate the web crippling capacities of RHFCBs with flanges unfastened and <b>fastened</b> to supports under one-flange load cases. Similarly the current design rules for cold-formed steel sections are not suitable for rivet <b>fastened</b> RHFCBs due to their two hollow flanges. Hence an experimental study was conducted to investigate the web crippling behaviour and capacities of rivet <b>fastened</b> RHFCBs based on the new AISI S 909 standard test method. It included rivet <b>fastened</b> RHFCBs with flanges unfastened and <b>fastened</b> to supports under End One Flange (EOF) and Interior One Flange (IOF) load cases. Tests with flanges <b>fastened</b> to supports showed that web crippling capacities increased by 39 and 5 % for EOF and IOF load cases. Comparisons of experimental web crippling capacity results with predictions using the current AS/NZS 4600 and AISI S 100 design standards showed that web crippling design equations are conservative for rivet <b>fastened</b> RHFCBs with flanges unfastened and <b>fastened</b> to supports under EOF and IOF load cases. Hence new equations are proposed to determine the web crippling capacities of rivet <b>fastened</b> RHFCBs. This paper presents the details of this web crippling experimental study of rivet <b>fastened</b> RHFCB sections and the results...|$|R

5|$|A {{shot line}} is a rope between a float at the surface, and a {{sufficiently}} heavy weight holding the rope approximately vertical. The shot line float should be sufficiently buoyant to support the weight of all divers {{that are likely to}} be using it at the same time. Recreational divers are free to choose lesser buoyancy at their own risk. The shot weight should be sufficient to prevent a diver from lifting it from the bottom by over-inflation of the buoyancy compensator or dry suit, but not sufficient to sink the float if the slack on the {{line is a}}ll taken up. Various configurations of shot line are used to control the amount of slack. The diver ascends along the shotline, and may use it purely as a visual reference, or can hold on to it to positively control depth, or can climb up it hand over hand. A Jonline may be used to <b>fasten</b> a diver to a shotline during a decompression stop.|$|E
5|$|In 1962, {{the issue}} was brought up again, this time as a pontoon bridge. The depth and {{steepness}} of the fjord would {{make it impossible to}} <b>fasten</b> the bridge to the sea bottom. However, a method without lateral anchorage had been developed for the Hobart Bridge in Australia. Another alternative was launched in 1963, involving a submerged floating tunnel through the fjord. It was estimated to cost between NOK 19.5 and 26 million. Norwegian expatriate Leif J. Sverdrup, co-founder of Sverdrup & Parcel of the United States, inspected the fjord in 1965 and was later hired to plan the bridge in cooperation with Oslo-based civil engineering consultants Prosjektering. Municipal engineers started measuring currents in 1966. Prosjektering and Sverdrup & Parcel recommended a pontoon bridge with a movable section to allow passage of ship traffic. In 1967, a new proposal was launched, in which a seaway tunnel would be blasted out in the rock on the Bergen side.|$|E

40|$|The {{intermittently}} rivet <b>fastened</b> Rectangular Hollow Flange Channel Beam (RHFCB) {{is a new}} cold-formed {{hollow section}} proposed {{as an alternative to}} welded hollow flange beams. Many experimental and numerical studies have been carried out in the past to investigate the shear behaviour of lipped channel beams. However, no research has been undertaken on the shear behaviour of rivet <b>fastened</b> RHFCBs. Therefore experimental and numerical studies were undertaken to investigate the shear behaviour and strength of rivet <b>fastened</b> RHFCBs. In this research finite element models of rivet <b>fastened</b> RHFCBs were developed to investigate their nonlinear shear behaviour including their buckling characteristics and ultimate shear strength. This paper presents the details of the finite element models of rivet <b>fastened</b> RHFCBs and the results. Both finite element analysis and experimental results showed that the current design rules are very conservative for the shear design of rivet <b>fastened</b> RHFCBs. Appropriate improvements have been proposed for the design rules of shear strength of rivet <b>fastened</b> RHFCBs within the Direct Strength Method format...|$|R

5|$|The {{contract}} {{for construction of}} the pontoon bridge was awarded in August 1991 to a consortium, Arbeidsfellesskapet Salhus Bru, which consisted of Norwegian Contractors, Aker Entreprenør, Veidekke and Kværner Eureka. The components were built in Moss and Fredrikstad and then shipped to Lonevågen, a branch of Osterfjorden which was suitable to connect the parts. There were problems welding the high-strength low-alloy steel, {{which resulted in the}} work being halted for several days before an agreement was reached between the contractor and the Public Roads Administration. On 26 January 1994, the steel frame which would be used to <b>fasten</b> the pontoon bridge to the cable-stayed bridge, came adrift during transport in Skagerrak, and was severely damaged, causing a delay in the project. As the bridge had the longest laterally unsupported span in the world, the construction was watched by many international delegations.|$|E
5|$|Apart {{from the}} forts, the {{garrison}} itself was heavily expanded {{during the initial}} construction years and became the largest garrison in Sweden, taking an exceptional position in Swedish military history of the 20th century; even {{at the start of}} the 21st century, Boden was the largest garrison city in the Swedish Army. Still, no other fortifications than the forts themselves were finished by 1908, and work now started to fill the holes in between them. It was realised that prepared positions were needed for the mobile batteries, and apart from those, three larger battery positions (sometimes called <b>fästen,</b> strongholds) were also constructed at Leåkersberget, Norra Åberget and Svedjeberget. These works were started in 1911 and were finished during the First World War. The last of the three strongholds was positioned in the mountain itself with embrasures in the mountain side, and Leåkersberget had parts of the battery position inside the mountain, but the gun emplacements outsidethe other positions were concrete fortifications above the ground, some inside a bunker and others behind a parapet.|$|E
5|$|On July 22 the North Koreans attacked. The ROK troops {{resisted}} briefly, but {{withdrew from}} {{their positions on}} either side of F Company without communicating their intentions. The withdrawal had {{been a part of the}} plan for reorganizing the line to incorporate the US troops, but F Company expected them to send a message before doing so, and did not adjust their defenses to compensate. North Korean troops quickly flanked F Company and began attacking it from the rear. This precipitated an unorganized withdrawal. The swollen stream prevented F Company from crossing to the south side and the 2nd Battalion positions. Walking wounded crowded along the stream where an effort to get them across failed. Two officers and two noncommissioned officers tied a pair of twisted telephone wires about their bodies and tried to swim to the other bank and <b>fasten</b> a line, but each in turn was swept downstream where they floundered ashore on the same bank where they had started. Some men drowned trying to cross the swollen river. The covering fire of a platoon of tanks on the south side held off the North Koreans and allowed most of the survivors to eventually escape. F Company lost 37 men: 6 killed, 10 wounded, and 21 missing.|$|E
