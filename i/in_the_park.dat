5|$|The park {{is an area}} of rich highveld and montane {{grassland}} flora. It {{has more}} than sixty grass species and a large variety of bulbs and herbs. Each of these species has its own flowering time, meaning that veld flowers can be seen throughout the summer. The park also has Afromontane forests and high-altitude Austro-Afro alpine grassland, which is scarce in South Africa. The ouhout (Leucosidea sericea), an evergreen species, is the most common tree <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>park.</b> Ouhout is a favourite habitat of beetles and 117 species occur on these trees <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>park.</b> The Lombardi poplars and weeping willows <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>park</b> are introduced species, but are kept because of their cultural and historic connection with the eastern Free State.

40|$|Abstract: Landscape is an {{important}} ingredient of city <b>parks,</b> so <b>the</b> design of seats <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>parks</b> integrated with <b>the</b> city landscape serves as an innovative inspiration {{for the design of}} the specific product. With the research of the landscape design and park seats, this project proposes flower as the developing form of <b>the</b> <b>park</b> seats, with <b>the</b> lily as the final design choice for a new seat <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>parks.</b> <b>The</b> specific structural forms of the seats are designed <b>in</b> accordance with <b>the</b> characteristics of lily, and the materials for the seats are chosen based on <b>the</b> <b>park</b> seats and bionics design. An integration of landscape and bionics in this design brings an innovation for the design of the landscape and seats <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>parks...</b>|$|R
