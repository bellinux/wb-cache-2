25|$|The Boeing <b>Insitu</b> RQ-21 Blackjack, {{formerly}} {{called the}} Integrator, is an American unmanned air vehicle {{designed and built}} by Boeing <b>Insitu</b> to meet a United States Navy requirement for a small tactical unmanned air system (STUAS). It is a twin-boom, single-engine, monoplane, designed {{as a supplement to}} the Boeing Scan Eagle. The Integrator weighs 61kg (135lb) and uses the same launcher and recovery system as the Scan Eagle.|$|E
25|$|A dynamic cone {{penetrometer}} test is an <b>insitu</b> test {{in which a}} weight is manually lifted and dropped on a cone which penetrates the ground. the number of mm per hit are recorded and this is used to estimate certain soil properties. This is a simple test method and usually needs backing up with lab data {{to get a good}} correlation.|$|E
25|$|Initially, it was {{proposed}} to use <b>Insitu</b> concrete flat slabs {{in the basement}} with a composite steel frame above podium level all on a 9m x 9m grid. However, as the top five floors had been prelet to KPMG, construction needed to be accelerated and water tightness on the upper levels needed to be achieved quicker. As a result, the plan was changed and the steel frame was started at basement level. However, the basement floors and column finishes were required to be concrete. A hybrid concrete flat slab and concrete encased steel column solution was used to achieve this as it allows the steelwork to continue for the upper floors with temporary bracing in the lower levels. As the concrete floors for the basement construction catch up, the temporary bracing is removed or built in.|$|E
25|$|LD-49 (also {{referred}} to as L5-49) is a large pyramid {{to the south of}} the plaza and is topped by three temple sanctuaries. The pyramid is the largest structure in the site core and rises about 20meters over the plaza. This pyramid's main stairway (known as Hieroglyphic Stairway2) contains at least eighteen hieroglyphic steps, describing the arrival and life of B'alaj Chan K'awiil. The discovery of eight new hieroglyphic steps in 2001–2002 and their interpretation lead to a complete reevaluation of the early history of the site, throwing light upon the wider Maya politics involved with the break from Tikal, formerly seen as an internal affair. The steps currently <b>insitu</b> are replicas put in place after looters stole a section of Step6 containing four glyphs in January 2003. The original steps were removed to a secure location. Flanking the stairway at the east and west ends are Panel6 and Panel7, both bearing hieroglyphic inscriptions. The well-preserved Panel10 is located part of the way up {{the east side of the}} pyramid. Panel10 was originally a stela at Arroyo dePiedra, it was moved and re-erected here after DosPilas conquered its neighbour.|$|E
2500|$|In September 2013, the Integrator {{was renamed}} the RQ-21A Blackjack. [...] On 28 November 2013, the U.S. Navy awarded Boeing <b>Insitu</b> an $8.8 million {{contract}} for one low-rate production aircraft {{in preparation for}} full-rate production.|$|E
2500|$|On 19 February 2013, <b>Insitu</b> {{completed}} {{the first flight}} of the RQ-21A Block II. [...] It weighs 121lb and flew for 2 hours. [...] It was controlled by a new ground control system meant to integrate dissimilar UAV systems. [...] The Block II has the sensor from the Nighteagle, the night version of the ScanEagle, and is designed to operate in high-temperature environments.|$|E
2500|$|Iran {{has claimed}} it has {{captured}} two RQ-11, one [...] "in Shahrivar 1390 (August 21 – September 19, 2011) {{and the other}} one in Aban (October 22 – November 20, 2012)". It also indicated that [...] "much of the data of these drones has been decoded", but did not indicate whether the drone has been duplicated, as has been done with the RQ-170 and the Boeing <b>Insitu</b> ScanEagle.|$|E
2500|$|The Marines {{are working}} with <b>Insitu</b> to modify the Blackjack {{fuselage}} to carry greater and more various payloads. [...] Enlarging the fuselage would increase its maximum takeoff weight from [...] to [...] and lengthen endurance from 16 hours to 24 hours. [...] New turrets are being explored {{as well as other}} payloads including a synthetic aperture radar to track ground targets, a laser designator to mark targets for precision-guided munitions, and foliage-penetration capabilities for foreign customers operating in lush environments. The Office of Naval Research (ONR) plans to add a sensor to the Blackjack that combines an electro-optical camera, wide area imager, short wave infrared hyperspectral imager, and a high-resolution camera for use as an inspection sensor into a single payload by 2020.|$|E
2500|$|The {{owners of}} MV Maersk Alabama donated the bullet-marked 5-ton {{fiberglass}} lifeboat {{upon which the}} pirates held Captain Phillips hostage to the National Navy UDT-SEAL Museum in Fort Pierce, Florida, in August 2009. The lifeboat had recently been on loan to National Geographic for its [...] "Real Pirates" [...] exhibition at the Nauticus marine science museum in Norfolk, Virginia. The producers of the Captain Phillips film visited the Museum {{in the process of}} re-creating the lifeboat and interiors for the set. An example of the Boeing <b>Insitu</b> ScanEagle used to monitor the crisis is also on display, as is the Mark 11 Mod 0 (SR-25) sniper rifle of the type used by the U.S. Navy SEALS to kill the pirates and free Phillips. The actual ScanEagle used in the mission is on display along with shell casings at the Museum of Flight in Seattle.|$|E
5000|$|The Boeing <b>Insitu</b> ScanEagle is a small, long-endurance, low-altitude {{unmanned}} aerial vehicle (UAV) {{built by}} <b>Insitu,</b> a subsidiary of Boeing, and is used for reconnaissance. [...] The ScanEagle was designed by <b>Insitu</b> based on the <b>Insitu</b> SeaScan, a commercial UAV that was intended for fish-spotting. The ScanEagle continues to receive improvements through upgrades and changes.|$|E
50|$|<b>Insitu</b> {{was founded}} in the early 1990s to develop the Aerosonde concept for {{long-range}} weather reconnaissance. The company derives it name from the process of measuring the atmosphere in situ (in place), as opposed to remotely, by satellite. At {{the end of the}} 1990s the company transitioned to the SeaScan concept for imaging reconnaissance from tuna seiners. With the onset of the Iraq war in 2003, SeaScan turned into ScanEagle, and <b>Insitu</b> focused their efforts on military applications. <b>Insitu</b> was acquired by long-time partner Boeing in 2008. In addition to its Defense business, the company announced the establishment of its commercial business unit, <b>Insitu</b> Commercial, in 2016.|$|E
50|$|ScanEagle is a {{descendant}} of another <b>Insitu</b> UAV, the <b>Insitu</b> SeaScan, which was conceived of as a remote sensor for collecting weather data as well as helping commercial fishermen locate and track schools of tuna. ScanEagle emerged {{as the result of}} a strategic alliance between Boeing and <b>Insitu.</b> The resulting technology has been successful as a portable Unmanned Aerial System (UAS) for autonomous surveillance in the battlefield, and has been deployed since August 2004 in the Iraq War.|$|E
