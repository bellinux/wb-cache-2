5|$|Having ruled {{himself out}} of the race when the news of Macmillan's illness broke, Home angered at least two of his cabinet colleagues by {{changing}} his mind. Macmillan quickly came to the view that Home would be the best choice as his successor, and gave him valuable behind-the-scenes backing. <b>He</b> <b>let</b> <b>it</b> be known that if he recovered {{he would be willing to}} serve as a member of a Home cabinet. He had earlier favoured Hailsham, but changed his mind when he learned from the British ambassador to the US that the Kennedy administration was uneasy at the prospect of Hailsham as Prime Minister, and from his chief whip that Hailsham, seen as a right-winger, would alienate moderate voters.|$|E

25|$|The end of World War II left Laos in {{political}} chaos. The French, {{who had been}} displaced from their protectorate by the Japanese, wanted to resume control of Laos, and sponsored guerrilla forces to regain control. The Japanese had proclaimed Laos independent even as they lost the war. Though King Sisavang Vong thought Laos was too small for independence he had proclaimed {{the end of the}} French protectorate status though he favored the French return. <b>He</b> <b>let</b> <b>it</b> be known he would accept independence if it should occur. Thus there was a nascent movement for independence amid the turmoil.|$|E

25|$|Herod's {{religious}} policies {{gained a}} mixed {{response from the}} Jewish populace. Although Herod considered himself king of the Jews, <b>he</b> <b>let</b> <b>it</b> be known that he also represented the non-Jews living in Judea, building temples for other religions outside of the Jewish areas of his kingdom. Many Jews questioned the authenticity of Herod's Judaism {{on account of his}} Idumean background and his infamous murders of members of his family. However, he generally respected traditional Jewish observances in his public life. For instance, he minted coins without human images to be used in Jewish areas and acknowledged the sanctity of the Second Temple by employing priests {{in the construction of the}} Temple.|$|E
25|$|In {{his later}} life and career, Liao Hua {{actively}} {{participated in the}} Shu campaigns (Zhuge Liang's Northern Expeditions and Jiang Wei's Northern Expeditions) against Wei. One of his most celebrated moments came in Chapter 103, when Sima Yi was retreating from Shangfang Valley. Liao Hua pursued the fleeing general into a dense forest and, being a proficient horseman, was able to catch up and {{get close enough to}} strike him down. However, when Sima Yi swerved around a tree, Liao Hua missed the shot and his sword became lodged into the wood, allowing Sima Yi to escape. During the chase, however, Sima Yi dropped his golden helmet. Liao Hua took the helmet and traveled back to Zhuge Liang who rewarded him with the first grade of merit for his attempt. This event angered Wei Yan who felt Liao Hua was being unfairly praised. Zhuge Liang noticed this but said nothing, leading to a mild distaste for Wei Yan's jealousy. The helmet was henceforth used as a means of mocking and provoking the Wei army. Following Zhuge Liang's death, Liao Hua moved up the ranks under Jiang Wei, eventually receiving the second-in-command military rank of General of Chariots and Cavalry. As Jiang Wei's senior general, Liao Hua was often tasked with the most important of duties, such as leading the vanguard and dueling enemy generals. Despite his steadfast loyalty to Shu, Liao Hua disagreed with Jiang Wei's constant invasions of Wei and his attempts to claim victory through overpowering numbers, believing these tactics to be a drain on resources and morale; <b>he</b> <b>let</b> <b>it</b> be known that he would run the military differently if he were in command, and this led to quarrels between Jiang Wei and himself. When Liu Shan eventually submitted to Wei in Chapter 119, Liao Hua succumbed to grief and died.|$|E
500|$|The {{organizers}} received {{permission from}} Rochussen for their meeting {{since they had}} argued that their grievances were social matters, not [...] "matters of state," [...] and {{that they did not}} form a political threat to the government. However, on 20 May van Hoëvell printed the kind of anti-government rhetoric he had been asked to refrain from in a journal he published. [...] There were also signals at other public events of growing unease among the locally born Dutch population as well as the large Indo-European population, who had held protests of their own and delivered a petition to Rochussen. Taking all these developments in consideration, Rochussen concluded that the meeting in De Harmonie should be considered subversive and a danger to the state; <b>he</b> <b>let</b> <b>it</b> be known that armed troops were ready {{to take control of the}} situation if need be. At 6PM on 22 May, people were flocking to the club house, and by 7PM it was packed. Van Hoëvell was quickly proclaimed to be president of the assembly. Soon after, though, the meeting became unruly and the shouts of a few led to a riot. In an increasingly unruly atmosphere, the protestors ousted van Hoëvell from his presidency as quickly as they had raised him to the position, after which he and others left the building. The protest fizzled out soon afterward.|$|E

2500|$|Dionysius of Alexandria {{stood against}} premillennialism when the chiliastic work, The Refutation of the Allegorizers written by Nepos, a bishop in Egypt became popular in Alexandria. Dionysius argued against Nepos's {{influence}} and convinced the churches {{of the region}} of amillennialism. The church historian, Eusebius, reports this in his Ecclesiastical History. Eusebius also had low regard for the chiliast, Papias, and <b>he</b> <b>let</b> <b>it</b> be known that in his opinion Papias was [...] "a man of small mental capacity" [...] because {{he had taken the}} Apocalypse literally.|$|E

Again, he anticipated that once the adjustments were complete, he would return to his previous form. Woods changed coaches, working with Hank Haney after leaving Harmon.|$|E
2500|$|The name of {{the protagonist}} was {{reminiscent}} of that of Ernie Pyle, a well known real life war correspondent of the era. Unlike Ernie Pyle, Ernie Pike survives the war and is referenced as a veteran in other stories by Pratt. The face of Ernie Pike resembles that of Oesterheld himself. This {{was caused by a}} misunderstanding during the period of designing of the character: when Oesterheld was describing to Pratt the positive traits of the new character, he ended saying [...] "Make him like me!". However, Pratt did not realize that Oesterheld was joking, and used his face. By the time Oesterheld realized the mistake, Pratt's work was already advanced, so <b>he</b> <b>let</b> <b>it</b> stay that way.|$|E

2500|$|Les Demoiselles {{would not}} be {{exhibited}} until 1916, and not widely recognized as a revolutionary achievement until the early 1920s, when André Breton (1896–1966) published the work. Richardson {{goes on to say}} that Henri Matisse was fighting mad upon seeing the Demoiselles at Picasso's studio. <b>He</b> <b>let</b> <b>it</b> be known that he regarded the painting as an attempt to ridicule the modern movement; he was outraged to find his sensational Blue Nude, not to speak of Bonheur de vivre, overtaken by Picasso's [...] "hideous" [...] whores. He vowed to get even and make Picasso beg for mercy. Just as the Bonheur de vivre had fueled Picasso's competitiveness, Les Demoiselles now fueled Matisse's.|$|E
2500|$|Following {{the death}} of Coram, Sir Edward Richards held the {{property}} until the 1640s, when <b>he</b> <b>let</b> <b>it</b> to Dr John Young, dean of Winchester. During the Commonwealth era, when Young was expelled from the deanery, he lived in quiet retirement at Cranbury. His widow occupied the estate in 1650, and later transferred the house to Sir Charles Wyndham, who married her daughter in 1665. Sir Charles, who (like Coram before him) was noted as [...] "a zealous assertor of the tenants' rights", was Member of Parliament for Southampton from 1679 to 1698 and for St Ives in Cornwall from 1698 to 1701. He died in 1706, although his wife survived him until 1720. A small monument was raised for them in Hursley Church.|$|E

Representative Elijah Cummings said that [...] "when Senator Sessions testified under oath that 'I did not have communications with the Russians,' his statement was demonstrably false, yet <b>he</b> <b>let</b> <b>it</b> stand for weeks – and he continued to let it stand even {{as he watched the}} President tell the entire nation he didn't know anything about anyone advising his campaign talking to the Russians". Cummings also called for Sessions's resignation. Senator Franken commented that he believes that Sessions perjured himself in his confirmation hearing.|$|E

2500|$|When Loria took control, <b>he</b> <b>let</b> <b>it</b> {{be known}} that Brochu's low-budget approach—or as he called it, [...] "business as usual"—was over. [...] He promised to rebuild the Expos with [...] "a winning {{attitude}} and winning players" [...] {{in an effort to}} bring the team back to where it had been only six years earlier. To that end, he drafted a new partnership agreement that gave him the right to call for cash investments in exchange for team equity—an option that had been unavailable to Brochu. Most of the minority partners, though, continued to treat their participation as a public-relations gesture and remained uninterested in investing additional money. When Loria issued a cash call in May 2000, the only other partners to increase their contributions were Coutu, Loblaw, and Stephen Bronfman. [...] Rather than contribute more money, the minority partners proposed trading Guererro. [...] Loria instantly vetoed this suggestion.|$|E
2500|$|Lucian Boia {{believes}} that Marghiloman's {{rise to power}} in early 1918 was Ferdinand's compromise with the moderate Germanophiles: [...] " [...] had not turned more German than the Germans, as Carp had done. He had not spoken out against the dynasty, although <b>he</b> <b>let</b> <b>it</b> be understood that the king might reconsider the situation and abdicate. [...] In circumstances where defeat was being acknowledged, Marghiloman {{seemed to be the}} one solution. Carp was too old, too intransigent and too isolated." [...] Moreover, before becoming Premier, Marghiloman had categorically denounced the Pantahuza conspiracy. In Carp's view, Marghiloman's separate peace of 1918 was scandalous, because (he claimed) the territorial demands of Romania's lesser adversaries had taken precedence over Germany's long-term projects. Reputedly, he and Beldiman worked hard to undermine Marghiloman's reputation with the German side. Carp's refusal to participate in the 1918 Parliament was another sign of dissatisfaction. According to his political ally Nenițescu: [...] "Neither Carp nor I shall be taking part in parliamentary procedures. This legislature is a sham. They elected many Liberals and [...] who have fled to Marghiloman's camp." ...|$|E

[...] Mentioning the long journey that it took, Larry expressed that he didn't think that he could do it all over again. [...] "It was too hard," [...] he said. Larry's friend photographer Timothy White expressed, [...] "drugs didn’t belong with Larry and I think Larry knew that and it wasn’t until he got to a point that he really realized that – [...] only at that point could <b>he</b> <b>let</b> <b>it</b> all go.

2500|$|The English Convention Parliament {{was very}} {{divided on the}} issue. The radical Whigs in the Lower House {{proposed}} to elect William as a king (meaning that his power would be derived from the people); the moderates wanted an acclamation of William and Mary together; the Tories wanted to make him regent or only acclaim Mary as queen. On 28 January a {{committee of the whole}} House of Commons promptly decided by acclamation that James had broken [...] "the original contract"; had [...] "abdicated the government"; and had left the throne [...] "vacant". The House of Lords wished to amend this, however, as many were still loyal to James and believed in the Anglican doctrine of non-resistance. The Lords rejected the proposal for a regency in James's name by 51 to 48 on 2 February. The Lords also substituted the word [...] "abdicated" [...] for [...] "deserted" [...] and removed the [...] "vacancy" [...] clause. The Lords voted against proclaiming William and Mary monarchs by 52 to 47. On 4 February the Lords reaffirmed their amendments to the Commons's resolution by 55 to 51 and 54 to 53. On 5 February the Commons voted 282 to 151 for maintaining the original wording of the resolution. The next day, the two Houses entered into a conference but failed to resolve the matter. William in private conversation (with Halifax, Danby, Shrewsbury, Lord Winchester and Lord Mordaunt) {{made it clear that they}} could either accept him as king or deal with the Whigs without his military presence, for then he would leave for the Republic. But <b>he</b> <b>let</b> <b>it</b> be known that he was happy for Mary to be nominal monarch and preference in the succession given to Anne's children over his by a subsequent marriage. Anne declared that she would temporarily waive her right to the crown should Mary die before William, and Mary refused to be made queen without William as king. The Lords on 6 February now accepted the words [...] "abdication" [...] and [...] "vacancy" [...] and Lord Winchester's motion to appoint William and Mary monarchs. Generally there was a great fear that the situation might deteriorate into a civil war.|$|E
