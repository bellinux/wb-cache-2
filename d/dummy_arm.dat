5000|$|The KGB {{told the}} {{executive}} of Wako in Moscow in October, 1980 [...] "I want the robot which builds the screw for large-sized vessels". Wako created {{a connection to}} Toshiba Machine Corp. (東芝機械株式会社) which specialized in working with communist countries and was a <b>dummy</b> <b>arm</b> of Toshiba. It went into talks with the KGB late in December, 1980. The spy agency requested four sets of machine tools of nine axes and four sets of machine tools of five axes. This request violated CoCom regulations on machine tool that limited machine tools to two axes. The Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI) served as the adviser for the violation. When the technical problem was solved, Itochu would work together with Wako and Toshiba Machine. Itochu and Toshiba Machine had long association. Itochu had moved responsibility for the violation to Wako and Toshiba Machine. Itochu occupied the building in Moscow that Armand Hammer of Occidental Petroleum had built. The agreement was signed on April 24, 1981.|$|E
40|$|Introduction: Dolomite AB was {{in need of}} a <b>dummy</b> <b>arm</b> for crutch testing, to {{complement}} their existing test capabilities. Background: A large number of people need crutches on a daily basis. For them it is essential that their crutches do not fail. ISO (the International Organization for Standardization) conducts ongoing work to guarantee the durability and function of e. g. crutches. ISO has recently adopted a new standard for testing if elbow crutches. This has already met resistance, it has been claimed that the tests in it should include loading of the crutch in the frontal plane. Aim: To enable Dolomite to test elbow crutches in accordance with guidelines in ISO/FDIS 11334 - 1. And examine the magnitude of loads on a crutch in the horizontal- sagittal- and frontal plane. This to see if loading of the crutch in the fontal plane should be included in a new ISO-test. Goal: To fabricate a <b>dummy</b> <b>arm</b> for testing of elbow crutches. To gain knowledge of the magnitude of the load a crutch is subject to in the horizontal-, sagittal-, and frontal plane. Method: A <b>dummy</b> <b>arm</b> was made using methods and tools described in DPD (dynamic product development), and conventional fabrication methods. A test equipment was made, which registered the loads on a crutch, in three directions. Eleven persons, constituted the test group, one was excluded. Result: A fully functional <b>dummy</b> <b>arm</b> was manufactured. The average maximum load for the ten test subjects was: 33 kilos downwards, 12 kilos backwards and 2 kilos side wards. Discussion: The choice of materials was influenced by the strength demands, ease of manipulation, access and price. <b>Dummy</b> <b>arm</b> design was mostly a question of durability and function. The test group was made up of persons available when the test was done The crutch loading test indicates that the forces applied to a crutch In the frontal plane are small, compared to forces in the horizontal- and sagittal plane, almost negligible. Conclusion: A fully functional <b>dummy</b> <b>arm</b> was fabricated, no need for a new ISO-test for standard crutches was identified...|$|E

50|$|Republic's flying effects, {{under the}} {{direction}} of Howard and Theodore Lydecker, were performed using a dummy that was slightly larger than life (at 7 feet tall) and made of paper mâché so that it weighed only 15 lbs. The uniform was made of thin silk and cotton jersey. Four pulleys were connected to each shoulder and leg calf, which were then strung on two wires so the dummy moved along them by its own weight. The wires were attached to two opposite objects running across the camera's field of view, and the dummy then slid from one to the other, giving the illusion of flight. This system was originally intended for use in their Superman serial; a prototype dummy was even built but later discarded. The flying pose used for the <b>dummy</b> (<b>arms</b> outstretched and back arched) was based upon a Captain Marvel drawing by comics artist Mac Raboy. If the dummy needed to be seen flying upwards, the cape was convincingly weighted and the dummy was then slid backwards. The film sequence was then optically printed in reverse, completing the flying illusion.|$|R
40|$|Experiments {{were carried}} out on blindfolded human {{subjects}} to study the contribution of proprioceptive inputs from both arms in a forearm position matching task. Blindfolded matching accuracy was compared with accuracy when the subject could see their indicator (matching) arm, when they used a <b>dummy</b> <b>arm</b> for matching, and when they looked at {{a mirror image of}} the matching arm. The position of the mirror had been arranged so that the image of the indicator arm coincided with the position of the reference arm. None of these conditions significantly altered the matching errors. When reference elbow flexors were vibrated at 70 – 80 Hz, the illusion of extension of the vibrated arm reported by blindfolded subjects was significantly reduced by vision of the mirror image of the indicator arm or when using the <b>dummy</b> <b>arm.</b> It was concluded that visual information about the position of the indicator arm, or the apparent position of the reference arm, could reduce the size of the kinaesthetic illusion from vibration, but not abolish it. In a second experiment, subjects indicated, by tracking with their vibrated arm, the illusion of forearm extension evoked by elbow flexor vibration. It was found that the perceived speed of extension could be reduced by moving the indicator into extension and increased by moving it into flexion. These experiments demonstrate the importance for the matching process of the input provided by the indicator arm. Such a conclusion may help to explain some apparent discrepancies between observations made on position sense using one-arm and two-arm tasks. More broadly, this paper provides support for the idea that aspects of proprioceptive inputs from both arms are processed conjointly, as part of a strategy for use of the two hands as a single instrument in certain skilled tasks...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{reports a}} {{clinical}} study {{designed to assess}} myocardial, renal and lung outcomes following cardiac surgery. In a single centre, prospective randomized, placebo intervention-controlled trial the effects of intermittent upper limb ischaemia (remote ischaemic preconditioning (RIPC)) were compared in non-diabetic adult patients undergoing on-pump multi-vessel coronary artery surgery. Patients, investigators, anaesthetists, surgeons and critical care teams were all blind to group allocation. Subjects were randomized(1 : 1) to RIPC(or placebo) stimuli (3 x upper limb (or <b>dummy</b> <b>arm)</b> 5 minute cycles of 200 mmHg cuff inflation/deflation) during sternotomy and conduit procurement. Anaesthesia, perfusion, cardioplegia and surgical techniques were standardized. Groups were well matched on demographic and operative variables. In contrast to prior smaller studies, RIPC did not reduce troponin T (48 hour area under the curve (AUC); 6 hour and peak) release, improve post-operative haemodynamics (cardiac indices; low cardiac output episodes incidence; IABP usage; inotrope and vasoconstrictor use; M mode, 2 D contrastenhanced echocardiography and tissue Doppler imaging) or offer antiarrhythmic benefit (de novo left bundle branch block or Q waves; ventricular tachyarrhythmia incidence). RIPC did not afford renal (peak creatinine, AUC urinary albumin-creatinine ratios, dialysis requirement) or lung protection (intubation times, 6 hour and 12 hour pO 2 /FiO 2 ratios). Case urgency did not influence RIPC effect. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|E
40|$|Background—We {{assessed}} whether remote ischemic preconditioning (RIPC) improves myocardial, renal, {{and lung}} protection after on-pump coronary surgery. Methods and Results—This was a single-center, prospective, randomized (1 : 1), placebo-controlled trial. Patients, investigators, anesthetists, surgeons, and critical care teams were blinded to group allocation. Subjects received RIPC (or placebo) stimuli (3 upper limb (or <b>dummy</b> <b>arm),</b> 5 -minute cycles of 200 mm Hg cuff inflation/deflation) before aortic clamping. Anesthesia, perfusion, cardioplegia, and surgical techniques were standardized. The primary end point was 48 -hour area under the curve (AUC) troponin T (cTnT) release. Secondary end points were 6 -hour and peak cTnT, ECG changes, cardiac index, inotrope and vasoconstrictor use, renal dysfunction, and lung injury. Hospital survival was 99. 4 %. Comparing placebo and RIPC, median (interquartile range) AUC 48 -hour cTnT (ng/mL 1 / 48 h 1); 28 (19, 39) versus 30 (22, 38), 6 -hour cTnT (ng/mL 1); 0. 93 (0. 59, 1. 35) versus 1. 01 (0. 72, 1. 43), peak cTnT (ng/mL 1); 1. 02 (0. 74, 1. 44) versus 1. 04 (0. 78, 1. 51), de novo left bundle-branch block (4 % versus 0 %) and Q waves (5. 3 % versus 5. 5 %), serial cardiac indices, intraaortic balloon pump usage (8. 5 % versus 7. 5 %), inotrope (39 % versus 50 %) and vasoconstrictor usage (66 % versus 64 %) were not different.

But she is not there, having escaped the ghetto earlier. Kittel is furious, and orders the actors to line up with their backs to him. He calls out for the machine gunner, but instead Gens comes onstage carrying a heavy cart filled with jam and bread, deliberately sounding similar to a machine gun to fool the actors into thinking {{they are going to}} be killed. Kittel turns them around, laughing at the success of his joke. He applauds {{their performance}} and offers them the bread and jam. The Dummy sings an uplifting song as the actors enjoy their meal. Kittel moves away from them, cocks his schmeisser, and guns them down, including Gens, in one long round. Srulik remains unharmed, and his Dummy frees itself from his hold; it approached Kittel as an independent person and sings the last verse of the song, before Kittel guns it down too. The bullets that destroy the <b>Dummy</b> wound Srulik's <b>arm</b> as well, and he becomes the old one-armed Narrator from the beginning of the play, saying [...] "Our last performance?

5000|$|The Wing Chun wooden dummy is {{the most}} popular form of wooden dummy. A popular legend says it came about when 108 {{separate}} wooden dummies from the Shaolin Temple were combined into one by the nun Ng Mui to make training more efficient and effective. The Wing Chun wooden <b>dummy</b> uses an <b>arm</b> and leg configuration designed to cultivate fighting skill and chi simultaneously. The Hong Kong wooden dummy is a wall mounted version of the Wing Chun Wooden Dummy that hangs using two wooden slats through the body of the wooden dummy. Older versions of the Wing Chun wooden dummy were originally placed in the ground. The modern design was created by Yip Man in Hong Kong to fit the needs of living in an apartment. The Wing Chun version of the muk yan jong has three arms and one leg, which represents an opponent's body in various positions and the lines of force the body can give out. The wooden slats on which the muk yan jong is mounted has a springiness that is similar to a human opponent's involuntary reaction and allows the user to practice absorbing energy into his/her stance. Due to this springiness, this type of dummy is considered an [...] "alive" [...] dummy. Therefore, the older version of the dummy without mounting is commonly called a [...] "dead" [...] dummy.|$|R
40|$|The project {{focus has}} been {{development}} of guidelines and methods for upper extremity injury reduction in car crashes. The safety of the central body parts improves which indicates {{the need to develop}} methods for avoiding non-life threatening injuries such as fracture of the arms. The purpose of the project was to study the injury mechanisms for the upper extremity in car crashes, and the aim has been to propose methods to reduce the injuries. The project focuses on adult occupants inside the vehicles front seat, and frontal and side impacts. The procedure began with understanding and identifying the injury mechanisms. Studies show that most fractures occur on the forearm (radius and ulna) and on the wrists and hands. To determine which injury mechanisms that were most frequent, data were collected from 29 computer simulations with 29 different crash scenarios. The most common kind of impact was the medial part of the wrist in {{the central part of the}} instrument panel, combined with the impact of the elbow in the center consol. The results of the simulations created a basis for the method of the component test, with focus on the injury mechanism i. e. the forward movement of the arms into the instrument panel. The component test consisted of a test rig, on which was mounted with a measuring arm of a 50 th percentile male <b>dummy.</b> The <b>arm</b> dropped into a block of expanded polypropylene (EPP-block) for observation and study, and with following variable parameters: the impact angle of the surface, velocity and position of the wrist. Then also an instrumented measuring arm from a 5 th percentile female dummy was released into an instrument panel. The project contributes to knowledge about the injury mechanism of the upper extremity in car crashes. The most frequent injury mechanism is a forward movement of the arms resulting in an impact with the interior structure of the car. The most frequent injured region is the distal part of the upper extremity. The project has developed and suggested the first step to a test method for the specific injury mechanism. There is a need of more research on how impact angles and velocity affect the violence on the arm...|$|R
