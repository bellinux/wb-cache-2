"This <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>pretty</b> fancy ... pretty {{distinguished}} group", {{he said of}} the invited guests, {{which included}} members of the House and Senate, two justices of the Supreme Court, Olympic athletes, entrepreneurs, Rabbinical scholars, [...] "and Sandy Koufax".

500|$|Cindy White of IGN called The Consultant [...] "intriguing" [...] and said, [...] "The snappy {{dialogue}} {{seems to}} {{fit right in}} with what we expect from a Joss Whedon-ized Avengers movie." [...] Scott Chitwood of ComingSoon.net said, [...] "Considering a third {{of this is a}} rehash of an old bonus scene and the other 2/3 is Coulson sitting and having a chat, this <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>pretty</b> big disappointment." ...|$|E
500|$|The Globe {{published}} a favorable report of Desbouvrie's efforts, although noting that further testing was needed. [...] The Zoologist republished the Globe report {{with a note}} that Zoologist editors [...] "have no faith in {{the idea that the}} experiment will succeed in his object." [...] The American Magazine dismissed the project with the statement, [...] "The idea of engaging swallows in war <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>pretty</b> one, as, in future, all European wars will have to be conducted in 'swallow time'—when the warm winds blow from the sunny south." ...|$|E
500|$|When Cryer {{was twelve}} years old, {{he decided that he}} wanted to become an actor. When his mother heard this, she thought he should have a backup plan, and joked: [...] "Plumbing <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>pretty</b> good career." [...] Cryer {{attended}} Stagedoor Manor Performing Arts Training Center for several summers as a teenager, and is a 1983 graduate of the Bronx High School of Science. He was classmates with screenwriter and film director Boaz Yakin. To his mother's [...] "great disappointment", Cryer skipped college and went to study acting at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art (RADA) in London, United Kingdom.|$|E
5000|$|Maines: [...] "On {{the other}} hand, he wasn't afraid to get political, and this {{ultimately}} {{turned out to}} <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>pretty</b> serious song. Hopeful and positive, but serious." ...|$|R

500|$|On the {{character}} of Marten, Furth noted that [...] " [...] {{is one of the}} scariest characters that Stephen King has ever created. He moves from book to book, bringing chaos and anarchy with him...He is quite a demonic figure, and as such {{he is one of the}} great anti-heroes of contemporary popular fiction" [...] and that [...] "ourneying into Walter's mind <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>pretty</b> wild experience and at times a little frightening. You have to travel to very dark places". To find Walter's voice, Furth went to John Milton's Paradise Lost, William Blake's Proverbs of Hell, the Biblical Song of Solomon and the writings of Aleister Crowley for inspiration.|$|E
500|$|In 1989, Hillenburg {{enrolled}} in the Experimental Animation Program at CalArts: [...] "Changing careers like that is scary, but {{the irony is that}} animation <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>pretty</b> healthy career right now and science education is more of a struggle," [...] he admitted. He studied under Jules Engel, the founding director of the program, whom he considers his [...] "Art Dad" [...] and mentor. Engel accepted him into the program impressed by The Intertidal Zone. Hillenburg posited further, [...] " [...] also was a painter, so I think he saw my paintings and could easily say, 'Oh, this guy could fit in to this program.' I don't have any [...] animation really." [...] He graduated in 1992, earning a Master of Fine Arts in experimental animation.|$|E
500|$|CBS senior {{journalist}} Danna Walker stated, [...] "There is {{criticism that}} it is only a story because she <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>pretty</b> blonde—and white—and it is criticism that journalists are taking to heart and looking elsewhere for other stories. But it is a big story because it is an American girl who went off on an adventure and didn't come back. It is a huge mystery, it is something people can identify with." [...] Good Morning America anchor Chris Cuomo was unapologetic of his program's extensive coverage of the Holloway case. [...] "I don't believe it's my role to judge what people want to watch… If they say, 'I {{want to know what happened}} to this girl'… I want to help them find out." ...|$|E
5000|$|Entertainment Weekly critic Sarah Caldwell {{gave it a}} {{good but}} mixed review: [...] "'I think {{we can all agree}} that this <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>pretty</b> stupendous episode -- and I’m not just talking about Belle’s wardrobe." ...|$|R

500|$|Quesada sees Peter's {{making a}} [...] "deal with the Devil" [...] as a villain (Mephisto) taking {{advantage}} of someone at his weakest moment. This, he feels, is a better resolution than Peter and Mary Jane getting divorced, which would indicate [...] "they gave up on their love, that their life in love together was so awful, so stressful, so unfulfilling {{that they had to}} raise a red flag and walk away from it. They quit on their marriage and even more tragic, (they) quit on each other. Instead, we had them make a deal with the devil. [...] 'Cause that isn't as bad." [...] Quesada went on to say, [...] "Peter and MJ didn't quit on their love, they sacrificed it to save a life, that to me <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>pretty</b> heroic story." ...|$|E
500|$|Before {{leaving town}} after Congress adjourned in March 1865, Stevens privately urged Lincoln {{to press the}} South hard militarily, though the war was ending. [...] Lincoln replied, [...] "Stevens, this <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>pretty</b> big hog {{we are trying to}} catch and to hold when we catch him. [...] We must take care that he does not slip away from us." [...] Never to see Lincoln again, Stevens left with [...] "a homely metaphor but no real {{certainty}} of having left as much as a thumbprint on Lincoln's policy.” On the evening of April 14, 1865, Lincoln was assassinated by Confederate sympathizer John Wilkes Booth. [...] Stevens did not attend the ceremonies when Lincoln's funeral train stopped in Lancaster; he was said to be ill. Trefousse speculated he may avoided the rites for other reasons. [...] According to Lincoln biographer Carl Sandburg, Stevens stood at a railroad bridge and lifted his hat.|$|E
500|$|Chris and Aidan later {{got back}} together, {{but after a}} few weeks, Chris broke up with Aidan for good. Chris ended the {{relationship}} because Aidan was not being honest about things. Chris learned that Aidan had been keeping Andrew's epilepsy and his own suspension from the hospital a secret. When Aidan then got into a fight and hid it, Chris became [...] "exasperated enough" [...] to end things. Mason said Chris was still in love with Aidan, so it was tough on them both. Aidan later made a [...] "desperate suggestion" [...] that they move in together, but Chris realised {{that it would be a}} bad idea. Mason quipped [...] "Chris <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>pretty</b> happy-go-lucky guy, so I don't think he'll be wallowing in self-pity for long." [...] Mason added that he would miss Morley, as he had enjoyed working with him during the storyline.|$|E
5000|$|Brad Kelly, {{a teacher}} at the school, said [...] "2009 <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>pretty</b> stellar year for him, he has {{probably}} achieved more this year than any other student who has gone through our rugby league program." ...|$|R
5000|$|Jenna Busch of IGN {{gave the}} episode 9 out of 10. Busch said that Leonard's {{cheating}} was [...] "out of character", but enjoyed Sheldon's pranks and summarized that [...] "overall, this <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>pretty</b> fantastic episode".|$|R
5000|$|... “We did a test pair-up {{just to see}} how it fit, {{and what}} came out <b>was</b> <b>a</b> bunch of songs I had written with a whole new depth of sound coming from Pat. It <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>pretty</b> cool day.” ...|$|R
500|$|The Flood {{were added}} {{early in the}} {{development}} of Halo: Combat Evolved, before the game had made its jump from the Macintosh platform to the Xbox. A design for one Flood form appeared as early as 1997. Commenting upon the inception of the Flood, Bungie staff member Chris Butcher noted that [...] "the idea behind the Flood as the forgotten peril that ended a galaxy-spanning empire <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>pretty</b> fundamental tenet of good sci-fi. Yeah, and bad sci-fi too." [...] Another inspiration was Christopher Rowley's The Vang series. The early design for the Flood was done by Bungie artist and writer Robert McLees, who considers himself [...] "the architect" [...] of the Flood; the Flood's roots are reflected in concept art of a [...] "fungal zombie" [...] that McLees did for the earlier Bungie game [...] McLees also did all the early concept art for the Flood.|$|E
500|$|Fincher and Savides {{used the}} {{photographs}} of William Eggleston, Stephen Shore's work from the early Seventies, and actual photos from the Zodiac police files. The two men worked hard to capture {{the look and feel}} of the period as Fincher admitted, [...] "I suppose there could have been more VW bugs but I think what we show <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>pretty</b> good representation of the time. It is not technically perfect. There are some flaws but some are intended." [...] The San Francisco Chronicle was built in the old post office in the Terminal Annex Building in downtown Los Angeles. A building on nearby Spring Street subbed for the Hall of Justice and the San Francisco Police Department. Production began on September 12, 2005. The filmmakers shot for five weeks in the San Francisco Bay Area and the rest of the time in Los Angeles, bringing the film in under budget, wrapping in February 2006. The film took 115 days to shoot.|$|E
500|$|Bandslam was The Washington Post's critic choice, {{having a}} perfect score of 4/4 stars. Bandslam was somehow {{associated}} with High School Musical {{in a couple}} of reviews. However, the reviews concluded the comparisons positively, saying that Bandslam was [...] "actually a lot quirkier than the posters would have you believe." [...] New Jersey's local newspaper, The Star Ledger says that the plot is nicely skewed: [...] "Basically, it's the standard teen picture – girl torn between bad boy and nice guy – with a gender switch." [...] Michael Phillips of The Los Angeles Times praised the film by saying: [...] "Bandslam <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>pretty</b> good movie given that the odds of it having been a pretty bad movie were steep." [...] Critic Andy Webster of The New York Times said that Bandslam may not entirely break new teen-movie ground, but it does offer intriguing glimpses of performers ready to bolt from the Disney stable.|$|E
50|$|The trial wasn't until 1989, and {{it proved}} to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>pretty</b> simple case. Razo was charged with only ten holdups. The {{prosecution}} relied heavily on the videotaped confession in which he described committing the crimes in detail.|$|R
2500|$|Nash {{normally}} bowled medium-fast, {{but at the}} time, {{impressed by}} the success Derek Underwood was enjoying, he was experimenting with spin bowling. He later commented, [...] "Sobers came along and quickly ended my slow-bowling career. It <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>pretty</b> short experiment." ...|$|R
50|$|In the Lancashire Cup, Wigan Highfield {{never managed}} to {{progress}} beyond {{the first round of}} the competition. They forced replays against Oldham in 1922 and Leigh in 1931 but all in all, the competition <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>pretty</b> miserable experience for them.|$|R
500|$|Some of {{the critics}} were divided on Rihanna's {{decision}} to collaborate with Brown again. Toronto Stars Lucas Oleniuk stated that [...] "Nobody's Business" [...] {{is not a bad}} track, [...] "it’s one of the catchiest and freshest-sounding here — but the troubling subtext is as irksome as the irony of titling a song that proudly makes the pair’s business everybody's." [...] Bernard Perusse of Montreal Gazette noted that although it <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>pretty</b> fair R smoker, there is something nauseating and sinister about the song and that is its message. Being more critical towards the collaboration, Randall Roberts of Los Angeles Times wrote that the track represents a sad inversion of the 1965 single [...] "I Got You Babe" [...] by Sonny & Cher, further noting [...] " [...] Instead of singing about connection, true love and wanting to shout it to the world, the song features a convicted abuser and the woman he assaulted asking everyone to shut up and leave them alone." ...|$|E
500|$|Weiss {{also noted}} {{about the death}} of King Tommen Baratheon, [...] "Meanwhile, while the {{explosion}} is happening, Tommen is alone. This fragile, malleable, devastated child, basically, is sitting there without anybody to comfort him, and if she had been there, he wouldn't have gone out that window. She failed him, and she alone failed him here." [...] Benioff continued about portraying the mindset of Cersei Lannister, saying [...] "I think the idea of Cersei without her children <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>pretty</b> terrifying prospect. It was the one thing that really humanized her, you know, her love for her kids. And as much of a monster as she could sometimes be, she was a mother who truly really did love her children, and now those children are gone, and all she's got is power." [...] In a subsequent interview after the episode airing, Weiss stated that Cersei's mindset following the ramifications of this episode will {{play an important role in}} the story for the next season.|$|E
500|$|Some {{brand and}} {{marketing}} experts {{have come out}} {{in support of the}} name change. Nigel Currie, director of sports marketing agency Brand Rapport, stated that [...] "the whole process has been conducted badly with the supporters, but [...] <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>pretty</b> sound idea." [...] Simon Chadwick, professor of Sport Business Strategy and Marketing at the Coventry University Business School, opined that the objective of opening up lucrative new markets for shirt sales, merchandise and broadcast deals shows commercial vision and could bring benefits, but [...] "this needs to be backed up by a proper marketing strategy and investment." [...] He said, [...] "it's no use thinking changing the name or the colour of the shirt will pay instant dividends." [...] David Stern, commissioner of the National Basketball Association in the United States, warned: [...] "I would say a wise owner [...] would view his ownership as something of a public trust, in addition to the profit motive, and you really do want to allow the fans a little bit more input than I think is being allowed, with respect to Hull." ...|$|E
50|$|Shively also complimented the 3D {{rendering}} of the fights and monsters during combat. “I thought this <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>pretty</b> cool aspect, since most mobile MMORPGs feature card systems and you never actually get to see your creatures moving in 3D".|$|R
5000|$|... ‘What a {{case they}} have made for their place at the game’s top table,’ said one report, after the final match of the 2004 edition. ‘If this was the death throes of Pacific islands rugby it <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>pretty</b> {{spectacular}} way to go.’ ...|$|R
5000|$|His {{style has}} been {{described}} as quick-rapping, [...] "machine gun-like delivery". Lil Wyte described his style: [...] "I've always felt like I <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>pretty</b> complex rapper to be from the South - I feel like I put a lot into my music." ...|$|R
