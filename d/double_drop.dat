5000|$|Brakspear's beer is brewed {{using the}} {{traditional}} <b>double</b> <b>drop</b> fermentation method. This involves allowing fermentation {{to start in}} vessels on an upper floor, before 'dropping' into a second vessel below. This leaves tired or dead yeast and unwanted solids ('trub') behind and encourages a healthier fermentation. Refresh UK claimed that Brakspear beers possess a butterscotch flavour due to diacetyl produced through this method and their particular long-lived, multi-strain yeast, thought to have originally come from a defunct London brewery, possibly Mann, Crossman & Paulin.|$|E
50|$|Steps in the brewing process include malting, milling, mashing, lautering, boiling, fermenting, conditioning, filtering, and packaging. There {{are three}} main {{fermentation}} methods, warm, cool and spontaneous. Fermentation may {{take place in}} an open or closed fermenting vessel; a secondary fermentation may also occur in the cask or bottle. There are several additional brewing methods, such as barrel aging, <b>double</b> <b>dropping,</b> and Yorkshire Square.|$|R
