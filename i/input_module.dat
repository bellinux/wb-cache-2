40|$|The rise in {{complexity}} of SOC (System-on-Chip) architectures has brought into focus {{the need for}} better communication models for SOCs.

The theory and practices of wired communication networks is being applied to tackle communication issues in complex SOCs. This {{is referred to as the}} Network on Chip (NOC) model. Routers are one of the most important elements of an on chip network. The underlying architecture of a router is based on a crossbar switch as it offers higher throughput and lower latency due to point-to-point architecture. Homogenous sizes of the <b>input</b> <b>module</b> in the router may not be efficient as some cores may be underutilized while some of them may be overloaded. A heterogeneous size of the <b>input</b> <b>module</b> is preferred for the predicted traffic but bursty in nature.
