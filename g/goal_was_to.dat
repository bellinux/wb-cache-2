To gain the support of the masses, non-Brahmin politicians began propagating an ideology of equality among non-Brahmin castes. Brahmanical priesthood and Sanskritic social class-value hierarchy were blamed for the existence of inequalities among non-Brahmin caste groups.|$|E

5|$|Due to Langmuir's efforts, and the {{research}} of Schaefer at General Electric, the concept of using cloud seeding to weaken hurricanes gathered momentum. Indeed, Schaefer had caused a major snowstorm on December 20, 1946 by seeding a cloud. This caused GE to drop out for legal reasons. Schaefer and Langmuir assisted the U.S. military as advisors for Project Cirrus, the first large study of cloud physics and weather modification.

5|$|During the Great Depression Flanders {{began to}} write about social policy. His major concern was human {{development}} in a technological era. He addressed employing spiritual guidance with a “program of human values” to achieve a good life.

50|$|Mell then {{introduced}} to another friend from Australia, a koala named Lou who recently {{moved into the}} Hills to study. Ciel gave her the egg for him to polish on. One day, the egg that Poco entrusted to Mell started to crack and later hatched into a young dragon girl named Nina. Ciel explained that Nina is from Nordic Countries, and her egg got washed up onto the lake of Merci Hills. She has no idea who her mother was, confusing Mell and her friends about her origin but decided to find who Nina's mother was. Ciel asked Nina if she can handle the mission on {{taking care of the}} egg and she agrees. On each hardships she and her friends endure, they never forgot their mission on polishing the eggs. But each of them has their own goal: Marin's <b>goal</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> have good food, Poco's <b>goal</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> make everyone laugh and smile, Chico's <b>goal</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> find the charming points to her friends, Aro's <b>goal</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> believe into someone, Lou's <b>goal</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> confront each difficulty and obstacle he face, Nina's <b>goal</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> find her mother and Mell's <b>goal</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> connect everyone's hearts.
