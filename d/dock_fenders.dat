40|$|Issue: Ground rubber from tires, buffings, {{and other}} sources is {{commonly}} added into rubber compounds in order to lower costs and to use recyclate. Best Practice: The size of the ground rubber material varies from 6 to 100 mesh. Smaller particles are available but are not commonly used. When ground rubber is added as a filler, three things almost always occur: 1. The viscosity of the rubber compound increases; 2. The tensile strength is lowered; and 3. The dynamic properties are reduced. One of the biggest reasons manufacturers use ground rubber as fillers in virgin compounds is to reduce costs. The ground rubber costs less than the virgin compound and the price reduction is generally {{in proportion to the}} level of ground rubber added. Development continues on surface modification, devulcanization, and treatments and binders to minimize the negative effects on properties and in fact enhance the properties of compounds containing ground rubber. Implementation: Ground rubber is added into the rubber compound using an internal mixer. It is commonly used at levels from 5 - 75 %, depending on the application. Tires and high performance compounds use 3 - 10 %, and mats, <b>dock</b> <b>fenders,</b> bedliners, and similar low dynamic stress products can use from 10 - 75 % ground rubber. The smaller the particle size of the rubber, the less the negative effect on the compound properties. Benefits: The following data shows the effects of a 20 mesh, ambient-ground rubber compounded into an SBR 1502 compound. The ground rubber has been evaluated at 17, 33, and 50 % levels.

40|$|In 2014, 536 {{offshore}} wind turbines were installed on European shelf, connecting {{an average of}} 5. 9 MW to the grid every day. About two thirds of this were installed in the North Sea. This new and emerging market represents an opportunity for Norway {{to make use of}} our knowledge about marine operations in the North Sea from the petroleum industry. In this thesis the op- eration of accessing the wind turbine to transfer personnel and parts is investigated. Due to maintenance and unexpected repair the wind turbine needs to be accessed by technicians about three times per year. Hence, for a wind farm of some size, the access operation is done a signicant amount of times per year. The lack of a sufficient robust and cheap way to do this has proven a costly problem for the industry. Another problem is how to analyse and compare different access concepts. Time domain simulations as widely used in the oshore petroleum industry are time consuming and expensive, as you in principle should find one limiting Hs for all combinations of peak period and wave direction each concept will encounter to do a fair comparison. Therefore, MARINTEK's MingKang Wu in 2014 proposed a efficient way to calculate the limiting signifi- cant wave height for all combinations of peak period and wave direction in the frequency domain. At Dogger Bank location two, the moderate sea states were access is realistic have peak pe- riods in the area of 5 to 9 seconds. Having a small water plane area vessel designed to have low responses in this frequency area, such as a SWATH or a mini semi-submersible might be a good access solution on such a location. There is different strategies on how to access the wind turbine, <b>fender</b> <b>docking</b> is a popular choice today due to its simplicity and lack of vul- nerable expensive parts. Considering its superior velocity to the semi-submersible, a SWATH concept with <b>fender</b> <b>docking</b> was chosen for further analysis. The concept was inspired by the FOB SWATH used by Oddfjell Wind AS and has been created and analysed in VERES. Fur- ther, <b>fender</b> <b>docking</b> with this vessel was analysed with a MATLAB program containing the frequency domain method proposed by Wu (2014) and in the time domain simulation software SIMO. This thesis have three focal points, which this SWATH concept has been used to investigate. Firstly, to explore what parameters that {{should be included in the}} accept criteria for initiating the access operation. It was found that the limiting significant wave height depend on both peak period and direction of wave environment. Hence, it is recommended to step away from the industry standard of considering limiting Hs as a constant value, and consider limiting Hs as a function of peak period and wave direction. The second were to explore the potential of small water plane area solutions. It was found that it is feasible to design a SWATH to maximize its performance in a specic wave environ- ment. The producers of classical work boat catamarans claims that their vessels can access an {{offshore wind}} turbine in Hs up to 1. 5 m without considering Tp nor wave direction. Comparing this with the results from the Matlab program and SIMO, the SWATH concept analysed can not outperform this. One should nevertheless have in mind that as this is not a design thesis, the concept investigated is not optimized and that a optimized vessel surely would outperform the SWATH considered here. As well there is a chance that the limit of 1. 5 m Hs typically given by the manufacturers is somewhat optimistic. It might for instance only be valid in favorable combinations of Tp and wave direction, this belief is supported by wind farm owners reporting of work boats not being able to perform as promised in all sea states. The last focal point were to verify the method proposed by Wu (2014) by time domain simula- tion in SIMO. The method has not been verified, the results obtained by the use of Wu (2014) and time domain simulation in SIMO had large deviations. It was found that the simplification done by Wu that the propeller thrust works in the global x-direction directly in the fender point, at least is one of the reasons why the method underestimate the risk of slip. In the end of chapter three a frequency domain method where the propeller thrust is directed along the local x-axis is proposed. To improve the modelling of fender docking,one should improve the understanding of how the fenders dynamic and static coefficient depend on pressure, temperature,slip velocity and hu- midity. Another improvement would be to investigate whether diffraction effects from the wind turbine needs to be included in the analysis...|$|R

40|$|The Damen Twin Axe Fast Crew Supplier (FCS) 2610 is an {{offshore}} wind farm maintenance vessel that can safely and efficiently transfer mechanics between land and a wind farm. The thesis {{objective is to}} research the operational capability of the FCS by gaining insight into the push docking procedure of the transfer process. To keep the vessels bow steady and in position against the wind turbine tower during push <b>docking,</b> a <b>fender</b> {{is placed on the}} bow. Currently, it is not clear which phenomena play a role in making the fender stick or slip. This makes the fender a bottleneck in the relatively low operation profile, leaving room for improvement. In the push docking procedure condition, the FCS is pushed against the turbine tower using thrust generated by the drive train. The fender provides friction between the vessel and the tower. Disturbances by the environment, like waves, cause the bow to either slip or stick along the tower. An unexpected or long distance slip makes it unable for the mechanics to transfer from the FCS to the turbine tower. The objective of this research firstly is to gain insight in the interaction between the fender and FCS’s motion behaviour and its influences on the friction performance – the obstruction of the sliding motions between the fender and wind turbine. A second objective is to develop a prediction method to define safe transfer operations based on the fender-vessel friction performance in a yearly described sea – the operability. By use of calculations and simulations – in which boat, fender and environment are represented as real life components – two models are built that provides a description of the sea behaviour of the FCS and simulates the slick/slipping process of the fender against the wind turbine. In both models irregular head waves are described by a Jonswap spectrum. Model 1 merely represents the stick condition by using a frequency domain approach, in which the FCSs bow is ‘hinged’ against the turbine tower by springs in horizontal, (transversal) and vertical direction. Model 2 describes both stick and slip condition, describing the vessel motion interaction in the time domain. The fender is described by separate components, combining a ‘negative deflection’ based reaction force, a linear spring system and a (modified) coulomb friction block simulating the stick/slip phenomenon. Both models were validated in stick condition with results from towing tank tests. To define safe transfer possibilities, a condition check method judges the simulation conditions to be either safe or to be unsafe for transfers. With this the yearly ability to perform maintenance – operability – is determined. Based on the results of the sensitivity study, several influential design parameters can be identified. During stick conditions, in vertical direction a less stiff fender, higher static friction coefficient and increased thrust results in an increased operability. During stick and slip conditions, the thrust force has a major influence, higher thrust means an increasing operability. The dynamic friction coefficient is concluded to have less influence. The non-linear model causes the operability to be non-linear. In addition the operability is highly influenced by the simulation parameters (most important the friction slope) and the safety restrictions of the condition checker. These are both unknown but arbitrary chosen for this thesis. Therefore further investigation into these parameters is required to provide an accurate description of the yearly operability.
