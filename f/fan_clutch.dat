50|$|A <b>fan</b> <b>clutch</b> is as {{reliable}} {{as any other}} component on a vehicle, yet sometimes they fail. A common symptom of <b>fan</b> <b>clutch</b> failure is overheating at idle or in heavy traffic. Bad fan clutches can also cause poor performance of the car's air conditioning system because the fan also cools the air conditioner's condenser, which is {{directly in front of}} the radiator. A <b>fan</b> <b>clutch</b> can also fail in a stuck on position where engine power is lost even when the fan is not necessary. This type of failure can also decrease fuel economy.|$|E
50|$|A <b>fan</b> <b>clutch</b> is a {{thermostatic}} {{device that}} exists {{as an integral}} component of certain automotive cooling systems.|$|E
50|$|Another symptom is {{an extra}} (abnormal) {{grinding}} {{sound from the}} engine area, which {{may be caused by}} worn bearings in the <b>fan</b> <b>clutch.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Most <b>fan</b> <b>clutches</b> are viscous or [...] "fluid" [...] couplings, {{combined}} with a bi-metallic sensory system {{similar to that in}} a thermostat. Some clutches are electronically controlled (instead of bi-metallic strip). These provide the potential to control the level of engagement depending on any number of inputs. Common controlling factors might include engine oil temperature, transmission oil temperature, coolant temperature, AC system pressures and ambient air temperature.|$|R

5000|$|The trucks {{sold for}} US$1,500 {{and had a}} {{planetary}} or selective transmission system complete with [...] "lubrication by splash and oil mixed with the gasoline." [...] As with most early models, the seat was over the engine. The wheelbase was 88 in with standard tread and the vehicle had a Holley carburetor with gravity feed and steering wheel control. It also had a Bosch ignition, fixed control, air-cooling with belt-driven <b>fan,</b> cone <b>clutch</b> and double chain drive from countershaft to dead, rectangular section axle and Brown-Lipe steering gear included. The tires were 36 in by 3 in.|$|R

50|$|Gurney's car {{was pressed}} to hard and he retired on the 66th lap {{with a broken}} rear differential. After this, the {{positions}} stabilized a bit, although not until after Baghetti had briefly led the pack to the appreciation of local <b>fans.</b> Bonnier's <b>clutch</b> began slipping and Baghetti also fell back. Mairesse took third on the eightieth lap, and built up a three-second lead over McLaren. Stirling Moss, who was watching from the speaker tower, began betting people that McLaren would take third and he was right: in the first curve of the last lap, McLaren passed Mairesse and he took third by only 0.4 seconds. Bonnier's clutch troubles allowed Baghetti to pass him for fifth place {{near the end of}} the race. Phil Hill had to suffer being lapped before half of the race was over, and had to make a long pit stop with engine troubles and finished twelfth. Rodríguez' Ferrari lost oil pressure, Innes Ireland had a good race until something snapped in the steering, and Masten Gregory's car was overheating and then only ran in fourth gear for the last laps. The fire extinguisher in Roy Salvadori's Bowmaker-Yeoman Lola exploded in his face during practice.|$|R

5000|$|New at Cadillac for 1967 was a {{redesigned}} {{side panel}} contour {{that created a}} longer look and more sculptured appearance. Technical improvements included a revised engine valve train, different carburetor, Mylar printed circuit instrument panel, re-tuned body mounts and a new engine <b>fan</b> with <b>clutch</b> for quieter operation. A squarer cornered radiator grille insert had a cross-hatch pattern that appeared both above the bumper and through a horizontal slot cut into it, with a V-shaped appearance exhibiting a modern approach last used in 1954-1956 models. Rear end styling revisions were highlighted by metal divided taillamps and a painted lower bumper section. The new grille had a forward angle and blades that seemed to emphasize its vertical members. Rectangular parking lamps were housed in the outer ends. This year's new styling was particularly beautifully rendered on the Series 75 which had extra-long rear fenders and an extended [...] "greenhouse" [...] with a formal high-headroom look. Fleetwood wreath and crest emblems decorated the hood and the trunk and there were Fleetwood block letters at {{the right side of}} the deck lid.

40|$|The {{possibility}} to realize adaptive structures {{is of great}} interest in turbomachinery design, owing to the benefits related to enhanced performance and efficiency. To accom- plish this, a challenging approach is the employment of shape memory alloys (SMAs), which can recover seemingly permanent strains by solid phase transformations whereby the so-called shape memory effect (SME) takes place. This paper presents the develop- ment of a heavy-duty automotive cooling axial fan with morphing blades activated by SMA strips that works as actuator elements in the polymeric blade structure. Concerning the fan performance, this new concept differs from a conventional viscous <b>fan</b> <b>clutch</b> solu- tion especially during the nonstationary operating conditions. The blade design was per- formed {{in order to achieve}} the thermal activation of the strips by means of air stream flow. Two polymeric matrices were chosen to be tested in conjunction with a commer- cially available NiTi binary alloy, whose phase transformation temperatures (TTRs) were experimentally evaluated by imposing the actual operating thermal gradient. The SMA strips were then thermomechanically treated to memorize a bent shape and embedded in the polymeric blade. In a specifically designed wind tunnel, the different polymeric matri- ces equipped with the SMA strips were tested to assess the fluid temperature and surface pattern behavior of the blade. Upon heating, they tend to recover the memorized shape and the blade is forced to bend, leading to a camber variation and a trailing edge dis- placement. The recovery behavior of each composite structure (polymeric matrix with the SMA strips) was evaluated through digital image analysis techniques. The differences between the blade shape at the initial condition and at the maximum bending deformation were considered. According to these results, the best coupling of SMA strips and polymeric structure is assessed and its timewise behavior is compared to the traditional timewise behavior of a viscous <b>fan</b> <b>clutch...</b>|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: A magnetorheological fluid (MRF) {{fan drive}} {{prototype}} for automotive truck application is designed and tested for both performance and durability. A dual concentric gap with drum rotor design is chosen {{to meet the}} required torque capacity, packaging, and mass constraints. Finite element magnetostatic modeling is performed to size the electromagnetic circuit and achieve the desired flux density levels in the MR fluid gaps. The clutch is filled with a custom-formulated MR fluid. Performance testing shows excellent speed control and response. The required 40 N-m torque capacity is achieved along with low drag speed, which is a key design characteristic of the <b>fan</b> drive. The <b>clutch</b> successfully passed several 500 h durability tests in a test cell environment. Performance testing indicates that the MRF clutch maintains its required torque capacity with very little increase in drag speed over {{the duration of the}} tests indicating no fluid thickening issues. The total dissipated energy in these tests is about 3. 8 GJ. The total specific dissipated energy for these tests is more than seven times higher than the 107 J/cm 3 upper limit previously suggested in the literature...|$|R
6000|$|I tapped lightly; {{no answer}} came. Someone was talking; {{it sounded like}} a girl's voice. I pushed the door further open and walked in; such was the custom of the house. It was a large room, built over the yard, lighted by one high window, before which was the {{engraving}} desk, shaded under a screen of tissue paper. At the further end of the room stood a large cheval-glass, and in front of this, its back towards me, was a figure that excited my curiosity; so that remaining where I was, partly hidden behind a large easel, I watched it for awhile in silence. Above a heavily flounced blue skirt, which fell in creases on the floor and trailed a couple of yards or so behind, it wore a black low-cut sleeveless bodice--much too big for it--of the fashion early Victorian. A good deal of dark-brown hair, fastened up by hair-pins that stuck out in all directions like quills upon a porcupine, suggesting collapse with every movement, was ornamented by three enormous green feathers, one of which hung limply over the lady's left ear. Three times, while I watched, unnoticed, the lady propped it into a more befitting attitude, and three times, limp and intoxicated-looking, it fell back into its former foolish position. Her long, thin arms, displaying a pair of brilliantly red elbows, pointed to quite a dangerous degree, terminated in hands so very sunburnt as to convey the impression of a pair of remarkably well-fitting gloves. Her right hand grasped and waved with determination a large lace <b>fan,</b> her left <b>clutched</b> fiercely the front of her skirt.

The Rally AMX had the standard [...] I6 using a 3.07:1 rear gear ratio, while the Rally GT came with the high-performance [...] version of this VAM engine and a 3.31:1 rear gear ratio. The heavy duty cooling system consisting of fan shroud and coolant recovery tank was optional on the AMX and standard on the GT, some units of this version came with a <b>clutch</b> <b>fan</b> instead of the regular belt-type. The Rally AMX was the [...] "base model" [...] {{of the line and}} the Rally GT was closer to the European tradition of performance cars with its analog tachometer (instead of the AMX's digital tach), while convenience items such as air conditioning or automatic transmission were not available. The GT model also included a rear spoiler with electric liftgate lock release and eight-spoke steel wheels (which were optional on the AMX). The AMX came with VAM's own design five-spoke wheels with trim rings and blacked-out volcano hubcaps. The marketing effort by VAM's sales department had most GT units be equipped from the factory with all the options originally intended to be extra cost, such as rear defroster, reading dome light, intermittent wipers, and AM FM stereo radio aside from the already mentioned steel wheels and rear spoiler. These items were all optional on the AMX.|$|R
40|$|Upcoming {{emissions}} regulations (Tiers 3, 4 a and 4 b) are imposing {{significantly higher}} heat loads on the cooling system than lesser regulated machines. This work was {{a suite of}} tasks aimed at reducing the parasitic losses of the cooling system, or improving the design process through six distinct tasks: 1. Develop an axial fan that will provide more airflow, with less input power and less noise. The initial plan was to use Genetic Algorithms to do an automated fan design, incorporating forward sweep for low noise. First and second generation concepts could not meet either performance or sound goals. An experienced turbomachinery designer, using a specialized CFD analysis program {{has taken over the}} design and has been able to demonstrate a 5 % flow improvement (vs 10 % goal) and 10 % efficiency improvement (vs 10 % goal) using blade twist only. 2. Fan shroud developments, using an 'aeroshroud' concept developed at Michigan State University. Performance testing at Michigan State University showed the design is capable of meeting the goal of a 10 % increase in flow, but over a very narrow operating range of fan performance. The goal of 10 % increase in fan efficiency was not met. Fan noise was reduced from 0 to 2 dB, vs. a goal of 5 dB at constant airflow. The narrow range of fan operating conditions affected by the aeroshroud makes this concept unattractive for further development at this time 3. Improved axial fan system modeling is needed to accommodate the numbers of cooling systems to be redesigned to meet lower emissions requirements. A CFD fan system modeling guide has been completed and transferred to design engineers. Current, uncontrolled modeling practices produce flow estimates in some cases within 5 % of measured values, and in some cases within 25 % of measured values. The techniques in the modeling guide reduced variability to the goal of + 5 % for the case under study. 4. Demonstrate the performance and design versatility of a high performance fan. A 'swept blade mixed flow' fan was rapid prototyped from cast aluminum for a performance demonstration on a small construction machine. The fan was mounted directly in place of the conventional fan (relatively close to the engine). The goal was to provide equal airflow at constant fan speed, with 75 % of the input power and 5 dB quieter than the conventional fan. The result was a significant loss in flow with the prototype due to its sensitivity to downstream blockage. This sensitivity to downstream blockage affects flow, efficiency, and noise all negatively, and further development was terminated. 5. Develop a high efficiency variable speed fan drive to replace existing slipping <b>clutch</b> style <b>fan</b> drives. The goal for this task was to provide a continuously variable speed fan drive with an efficiency of 95 %+ at max speed, and losses no greater than at max speed as the fan speed would vary throughout its entire speed range. The process developed to quantify the fuel savings potential of a variable speed fan drive has produced a simple tool to predict the fuel savings of a variable speed drive, and has sparked significant interest in the use of variable speed fan drive for Tier 3 emissions compliant machines. The proposed dual ratio slipping <b>clutch</b> variable speed <b>fan</b> drive can provide a more efficient system than a conventional single ratio slipping <b>clutch</b> <b>fan</b> drive, but could not meet the established performance goals of this task, so this task was halted in a gate review {{prior to the start of}} detailed design. 6. Develop a cooling system air filtration device to allow the use of automotive style high performance heat exchangers currently in off road machines. The goal of this task was to provide a radiator air filtration system that could allow high fin density, louvered radiators to operate in a find dust application with the same resistance to fouling as a current production off-road radiator design. Initial sensitivity testing demonstrated that fan speed has a significant impact on the fouling of radiator cores due to fine dusts, so machines equipped with continuously variable speed fan drives would be expected to have more radiator debris fouling problems than a machine with a constant speed fan. Filtration concepts looked at a wide range of filtration technologies, but the combination of pressure drop constraints and the small size of the debris to be filtered made this a futile exercise. The most successful technologies evaluated all incorporate some way to increase the Reynolds number inside the heat exchanger air flow path. A form of an 'air knife' concept has emerged as the most promising technology to pursue...|$|R
