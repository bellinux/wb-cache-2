50|$|<b>Floxuridine</b> (also 5-fluorodeoxyuridine) is an {{oncology}} {{drug that}} belongs to the class known as antimetabolites. Specifically, <b>floxuridine</b> is a pyrimidine analog, classified as a deoxyuridine. The drug is usually administered via an artery, and most often used {{in the treatment of}} colorectal cancer. The quality of life and survival rates of individuals that receive continuous hepatic artery infusion of <b>floxuridine</b> for colorectal cancer metastases is significantly higher than control groups. Fluxuridine can also be prescribed for the treatment of kidney and stomach cancers. In vitro uses of <b>floxuridine</b> include 5-minute treatments of fluorouracil, <b>floxuridine,</b> and mitomycin to increase cell proliferation in Tenon's capsule fibroblasts.|$|E

50|$|<b>Floxuridine</b> is a {{pyrimidine}} analog {{that acts}} as an inhibitor of the S-phase of cell division. This selectively kills rapidly dividing cells. Antimetabolites masquerade as pyrimidine-like molecules which prevents normal pyrimidines from being incorporated into DNA during the S phase of the cell cycle. Fluorouracil (the end-product of catabolism of <b>floxuridine)</b> blocks an enzyme which converts cytosine nucleosides into the deoxy derivative. In addition, DNA synthesis is further inhibited because fluoruracil blocks the incorporation of the thymidine nucleotide into the DNA strand.|$|E

50|$|<b>Floxuridine</b> {{is rapidly}} catabolized to 5-fluorouracil, {{which is the}} active form of the drug. The primary effect is {{interference}} with DNA synthesis {{and to a lesser}} extent, inhibition of RNA formation through the drug's incorporation into RNA, thus leading to the production of fraudulent RNA. Fluorouracil also inhibits uracil riboside phosphorylase, which prevents the utilization of preformed uracil in RNA synthesis. As well, the monophosphate of <b>floxuridine,</b> 5-fluoro-2'-deoxyuridine-5'-phosphate (FUDR-MP) inhibits the enzyme thymidylate synthetase. This leads to the inhibition of methylation of deoxyuridylic acid to thymidylic acid, thus interfering with DNA synthesis.|$|E
50|$|<b>Floxuridine</b> {{primarily}} {{works by}} stopping {{the growth of}} newly born cells. The drug essentially stops DNA from forming in new and rapidly developing cells, which {{is a sign of}} a cancerous cell. Therefore, the <b>floxuridine</b> kills the cancerous cells. For colorectal cancer and hepatic metastases, an average adult should be given an Intra-arterial dosage of 0.1-0.6 mg/kg/day as a continuous infusion, continued until intolerable toxicity is reached (white blood cell count <3,500/mm^3 or platelet count <100,000/mm^3).Lethal dosages for other species are below. LD50 is the lethal dose at which half of organisms exposed to the drug die.|$|E
50|$|<b>Floxuridine</b> first gained FDA {{approval}} in December 1970 under {{the brand name}} FUDR. The drug was initially marketed by Roche, which also {{did a lot of}} the initial work on 5-fluorouracil. The National Cancer Institute was an early developer of the drug. Roche sold its FUDR product line in 2001 to F H Faulding, which became Mayne Pharma.|$|E
40|$|A {{series of}} amino acid {{monoester}} prodrugs of <b>floxuridine</b> was synthesized and evaluated {{for the improvement}} of oral bioavailability and the feasibility of target drug delivery via oligopeptide transporters. All <b>floxuridine</b> 5 Ã¢Â€Â²-amino acid monoester prodrugs exhibited PEPT 1 affinity, with inhibition coefficients of Gly-Sar uptake (IC 50) ranging from 0. 7 Ã¢Â€Â“ 2. 3 mM in Caco- 2 and 2. 0 Ã¢Â€Â“ 4. 8 mM in AsPC- 1 cells, while that of <b>floxuridine</b> was 7. 3 mM and 6. 3 mM, respectively. Caco- 2 membrane permeabilities of <b>floxuridine</b> prodrugs (1. 01 Ã¢Â€Â“ 5. 31 x 10 - 6 cm/sec) and <b>floxuridine</b> (0. 48 x 10 - 6 cm/sec) were much higher than that of 5 -FU (0. 038 x 10 - 6 cm/sec). MDCK cells stably transfected with the human oligopeptide transporter PEPT 1 (MDCK/hPEPT 1) exhibited enhanced cell growth inhibition {{in the presence of the}} prodrugs.

40|$|AbstractA {{liposomal}} {{delivery system}} that coordinates {{the release of}} irinotecan and <b>floxuridine</b> in vivo has been developed. The encapsulation of <b>floxuridine</b> was achieved through passive entrapment while irinotecan was actively loaded using a novel copper gluconate/triethanolamine based procedure. Coordinating the release rates of both drugs was achieved by altering the cholesterol content of distearoylphosphatidylcholine (DSPC) /distearoylphosphatidylglycerol (DSPG) based formulations. The liposomal retention of <b>floxuridine</b> in plasma after intravenous injection was dramatically improved by decreasing the cholesterol content of the formulation below 20 mol%. In the case of irinotecan, the opposite trend was observed where increasing cholesterol content enhanced drug retention. Liposomes composed of DSPC/DSPG/Chol (7 : 2 : 1, mole ratio) containing co-encapsulated irinotecan and <b>floxuridine</b> at a 1 : 1 molar ratio exhibited matched leakage rates for the two agents so that the 1 : 1 ratio was maintained after intravenous administration to mice. The encapsulation of irinotecan was optimal when copper gluconate/triethanolamine (pH 7. 4) {{was used as the}} intraliposomal buffer. The efficiency of irinotecan loading was approximately 80 % with a starting drug to lipid molar ratio of 0. 1 / 1. Leakage of <b>floxuridine</b> from the liposomes during irinotecan loading at 50 °C complicated the ability to readily achieve the target 1 : 1 irinotecan/floxuridine ratio inside the formulation. As a result, a procedure for the simultaneous encapsulation of irinotecan and <b>floxuridine</b> was developed. This co-encapsulation method has the advantage over sequential loading in that extrusion can be performed in the absence of chemotherapeutic agents and the drug/drug ratios in the final formulation can be more precisely controlled...|$|E
40|$|Dipeptide {{monoester}} prodrugs of <b>floxuridine</b> and gemcitabine were synthesized. Their {{chemical stability}} in buffers, enzymatic stability in cell homogenates, permeability in mouse intestinal membrane along with drug concentration in mouse plasma, and anti-proliferative activity in cancer cells were determined and {{compared to their}} parent drugs. <b>Floxuridine</b> prodrug was more enzymatically stable than <b>floxuridine</b> and the degradation from prodrug to parent drug works as the rate-limiting step. On the other hand, gemcitabine prodrug was less enzymatically stable than gemcitabine. Those dipeptide monoester prodrugs exhibited 2. 4 - to 48. 7 -fold higher uptake than their parent drugs in Caco- 2, Panc- 1, and AsPC- 1 cells. <b>Floxuridine</b> and gemcitabine prodrugs showed superior permeability in mouse jejunum to their parent drugs and exhibited the higher drug concentration in plasma after in situ mouse perfusion. Cell proliferation assays in ductal pancreatic cancer cells, AsPC- 1 and Panc- 1, indicated that dipeptide prodrugs of <b>floxuridine</b> and gemcitabine were more potent than their parent drugs. The enhanced potency of nucleoside analogs was attributed to their improved membrane permeability. The prodrug forms of 5 ¢-L-phenylalanyl-l-tyrosyl-floxuridine and 5 ¢-L-phenylalanyl-L-tyrosyl-gemcitabine appeared in mouse plasma after the permeation of intestinal membrane and the first-pass effect, suggesting their potential {{for the development of}} oral dosage form for anti-cancer agents.

Methods: From October 2005 to October 2008, 122 chemonaïve patients with newly diagnosed, inoperable HCC were randomized into a gemcitabine plus oxaliplatin combination regimen group (GO group) or a <b>floxuridine</b> plus oxaliplatin combination regimen group (FO group). The GO group was treated with 1, 600 mg of gemcitabine and 200 mg of oxaliplatin, and the FO group was treated with 1, 000 mg of <b>floxuridine</b> and 200 mg of oxaliplatin. Both groups were treated with glutin and iodolipol as the embolic agent in the transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE). Results: The progression-free survival, the median survival period, and the median time to progress had {{no significant difference between}} the two groups. However, there was a significant difference in the incidence of grade 3 / 4 thrombocytopenia between the two groups (P = 0. 002). Grade 3 / 4 hematologic toxicity was observed only in the GO group. One patient (1. 7 %) with grade 3 / 4 leukopenia and 6 patients (10 %) with grade 3 / 4 thrombocytopenia were observed.

40|$|The {{improvement}} of therapeutic efficacy for cancer agents {{has been a}} big challenge which includes the increase of tumor selectivity and the reduction of adverse effects at non-tumor sites. In order to achieve those goals, prodrug approaches have been extensively investigated. In this report, the potential activation enzymes for 5 ¢-amino acid/dipeptide monoester <b>floxuridine</b> prodrugs in pancreatic cancer cells were selected and the feasibility of enzyme specific activation of prodrugs was evaluated. All prodrugs exhibited the range of 3. 0 – 105. 7 min of half life in Capan- 2 cell homogenate with the presence and the absence of selective enzyme inhibitors. 5 ¢-O-L-Phenylalanyl-L-tyrosyl-floxuridine exhibited longer half life only with the presence of pepstatin A. Human cathepsin B and D selectively hydrolized 5 ¢-O-L-phenylalanyl-L-tyrosylfloxuridine and 5 ¢-O-L-phenylalanyl-L-glycylfloxuridine compared to the other tested prodrugs. The wide range of growth inhibitory effect by <b>floxuridine</b> prodrugs in Capan- 2 cells was observed due to the different affinities of prodrug promoieties to enyzmes. In conclusion, it is feasible to design prodrugs which are activated by specific enzymes. Cathepsin D might be a good candidate as a target enzyme for prodrug activation and 5 ¢-O-L-phenylalanyl-L-tyrosylfloxuridine may be the best candidate among the tested <b>floxuridine</b> prodrugs...|$|E

40|$|Background: Intrahepatic {{continuous}} infusion FUDR induces a 50 % {{response rate}} {{in patients with}} hepatic metastases from colorectal cancer. Lower rates have been observed in pretreated patients. The combination of <b>floxuridine</b> plus leucovorin has obtained over 70 % responses, with high hepatic toxicity. The use of dexamethasone can decrease hepatic toxicity. A randomized study reported an increase in response rate {{and a decrease in}} hepatic toxicity in a group of patients treated with <b>floxuridine</b> plus dexamethasone compared to a group receiving only <b>floxuridine,</b> Moreover, the combination of mitomycin C, carmustine and <b>floxuridine</b> is also effective in pretreated patients. Methods: On such premises, since July 1993 we have treated 39 patients affected by unresectable hepatic metastases from colon carcinoma (26 patients) and rectal carcinoma (13 patients) with the combination continuous infusion of <b>floxuridine</b> (0. 20 mg/kg per day) + leucovorin (7. 5 mg/m(2) /day) + dexamethasone (20 mg on days 1 to 14) and bolus mitomycin C (10 mg/m(2) on day 1) via the hepatic artery. Cycles were administered every four weeks. There were as 28 males and II females, with a median age of 64 years (range, 39 - 75) and a median PS = 0, Twenty-two patients were pretreated with systemic chemotherapy including 5 -fluorouracil plus leucovorin, Total number of cycles was 189, with a median of 6 cycles per patient (range, 1 - 12). Results: Of 39 patients 37 were assessable for response (2 patients were not assessable because they stopped chemotherapy for occlusion of the catheter after the first cycle). There were 3 complete responses (1 in a naive patient and 2 in pretreated patients), 16 partial responses (11 in pretreated patients and 5 in chemonaive patients), 4 minor responses, 4 stable disease and 10 progressive disease. The overall response rate was 51. 3 % (95 CI, 51. 3 - 86. 7 %). Median time to progression was 6 months (range, 1 - 34 +). Overall survival was 18 months (range, 1 - 34 +), Of 39 patients, 36 were assessable for toxicity (WHO) (3 patients died after the first cycle for progression of disease) : diarrhea and nausea-vomiting grade 3 - 4 occurred respectively in 15 (41 %) and 3 patients (8 %); hepatic toxicity was mild.

40|$|With {{more than}} 3 million new cases and 1. 7 million deaths each year, {{cancer is the}} most {{important}} cause of death in Europe after cardiovascular diseases (numbers according to the World Health Organization). Strategies to manage cancer include surgery, radiation therapy, immunotherapy, hormonal therapy, chemotherapy and others. Currently, chemotherapeutic intervention of cancer is largely based on inhibition of tumor cell proliferation by the administration of nucleoside-based drugs (nucleoside analogues; NAs). After intracellular activation (often one or more phosphorylation steps), NAs may act as antimetabolites, interfering with the tumor cell nucleo(s) (t) ide metabolism and DNA/RNA synthesis. Since many cells in adults are quiescent and therefore not in the process of replication, NAs display a certain level of selectivity towards tumor cells. The microenvironment of a tumor encompasses cancer cells and resident or infiltrating non-tumor cells. In addition, several studies have reported a close association of different prokaryotes with tumor tissue in cancer patients, which may be attributed to an increased nutrient availability at the tumor site, bacterial chemotaxis or defective defense mechanisms in cancer cells. A high preferential colonization of tumor tissue with different mycoplasma species (e. g. Mycoplasma hyorhinis), compared with healthy or non-malignant diseased tissue, has been repeatedly reported. Mycoplasmas are characterized by the lack of a cell wall and a strongly reduced genome and are considered to be the smallest self-replicating organisms. Some mycoplasmas (e. g. Mycoplasma pneumoniae and Mycoplasma genitalium) are clearly associated with disease. However, most species cause asymptomatic infections and are considered {{to be part of the}} residential flora of the healthy human body. Mycoplasma-related pathogenesis is therefore mostly observed in immunocompromised individuals. The limited number of genes in mycoplasmas is reflected in their nucleo(s) (t) ide metabolism. Most mycoplasma species share the inability to synthesize purine and pyrimidine nucleotides de novo and therefore rely on the tissue of their host for preformed nucleic acid precursors which are efficiently internalized and metabolized using several transport mechanisms and salvage enzymes, respectively. Therefore we hypothesized that a mycoplasma infection may significantly affect the availability and metabolism of nucleo(s) (t) ides and nucleo(s) (t) ide analogues in the host tumor cells. The cytostatic and antiviral activity of nucleoside-based drugs was indeed dramatically altered in mycoplasma-infected tumor cell cultures due to the expression of catabolic mycoplasma-encoded enzymes. Taking into account the preferential mycoplasma colonization of tumor tissue and the occurrence of secondary mycoplasma infections in immunocompromised individuals (e. g. AIDS patients), chemotherapy of cancer/viral infections with NAs may be suboptimal. In this work, we aimed at a careful investigation of the influence of a mycoplasma infection on the biological potential of nucleo(s) (t) ide-derived drugs. Mycoplasma-encoded nucleoside phosphorylases (NPs) were found to be crucial in the altered activity of purine- and pyrimidine-based NAs. Depending on the nature of the nucleobase that was released from the drug by NP-catalyzed phosphorolysis, an increased or a decreased biological activity was observed in mycoplasma-infected tumor cell cultures. The cytostatic activity of the drugs could be restored by the co-administration of mycoplasma-targeting antibiotics or a specific NP inhibitor. We therefore cloned the thymidine phosphorylase (TP) and purine nucleoside phosphorylase (PNP) genes annotated in the genome of M. hyorhinis and expressed them as recombinant proteins in Escherichia coli. M. hyorhinis TP was found to encode a nucleoside phosphorylase that, in contrast to human TP, does not discriminate between pyrimidine-based 2 -deoxyribosides and ribosides. The kinetic parameters of this enzyme were determined in detail and surprisingly revealed that uridine was the preferred natural substrate followed by thymidine. These results therefore indicate that, even though the mycoplasma-encoded enzyme shows high sequence similarity with both human and Escherichia coli TP, it should be re-annotated as a pyrimidine nucleoside phosphorylase (PyNP-Hyor) rather than as a TP. The expression of similar enzymes has been reported for a few other prokaryotes (e. g. Geobacillus stearthermophilus) and the parasite Giardia lamblia. PyNP-Hyor also efficiently catalyzed the phosphorolysis of therapeutic 5 -halogenated pyrimidine nucleosides (e. g. <b>floxuridine)</b> to their less active nucleobases, explaining the decreased antiviral/cytostatic activity of such compounds in mycoplasma-infected cell cultures. Also, efficient phosphorolysis of clinically approved purine-based NAs (e. g. cladribine and fludarabine) was observed in M. hyorhinis-infected tumor cells resulting in an altered biological activity of the compounds. Depending on the released nucleobase, mycoplasma infection resulted in a decreased cytostatic activity (as observed for cladribine due to the release of the poorly cytostatic 2 -chloroadenine base) or increased cytostatic activity (as observed for fludarabine due to the release of the highly cytostatic 2 -fluoroadenine base). The co-administration of potent PNP inhibitors efficiently restored the activity of the drugs. The recombinantly expressed PNP of M. hyorhinis (PNP-Hyor) was kinetically characterized and found to catalyze the phosphorolysis of all natural purine nucleosides [except for xanthosine; including (2 -deoxy) adenosine], and several of their therapeutic derivatives. Since (2 -deoxy) adenosine and its analogues are generally not accepted as a substrate for human PNP, the presence of mycoplasmas at a tumor site may significantly contribute to a selective phosphorolysisof such drugs. Elimination of mycoplasmas or suppression of their catabolizing enzymes may therefore potentially increase the therapeutic index of purine-based NAs such as cladribine. Alternatively, a rational choice for drugs that are activated upon mycoplasma-mediated phosphorolysis (e. g. fludarabine) may increase therapeutic selectivity. Next, a decreased cytostatic activity of gemcitabine was observed in M. hyorhinis-infected cell cultures. Strong evidence was provided for the expression of a mycoplasma-encoded (2 -deoxy) cytidine deaminase catalyzing the deamination (and therefore inactivation) of gemcitabine in such cultures. In addition, we also observed a PyNP-related inactivation of gemcitabine: its cytostatic activity could be efficiently restored by selective PyNP inhibition and was not compromised in cell cultures infected with a PyNP-deficient mycoplasma strain. These findings were surprising to us since gemcitabine proved not to be a direct substrate for NP-catalyzed phosphorolysis. Several observations suggest that mycoplasma PyNP activity may alter the host cell pyrimidine nucleo(s) (t) ide metabolism (i. e. by decreasing intracellular dTTP and increasing dCTP levels) and therefore may indirectly affect the activity of cellular 2 -deoxycytidine kinase (dCK; the enzyme responsible for the initial activation of gemcitabine). However, it is currently unclear whether dNTP levels are sufficiently different in the mycoplasma-infected tumor cell cultures to have a significant inhibitory effect on dCK. Alternatively, the formation of a tight multi-enzyme complex of catabolic mycoplasma pyrimidine nucleoside salvage enzymes [i. e. PyNP and (2 -deoxy) cytidine deaminase] may also explain our findings. However, this possibility is still very hypothetic and no solid evidence for its occurrence has yet been provided. Due to the compromising role that mycoplasma PyNP may have in the cytostatic activity of thymidine analogues, we explored the possibility to develop a prodrug of <b>floxuridine</b> that is not susceptible to NP-catalyzed inactivation. In collaboration with prof. C. McGuigan (Cardiff University, Cardiff, UK), the phosphoramidate prodrug (ProTide) technology was applied to design novel derivatives of floxuridine- 5 -monophosphate, the active metabolite of <b>floxuridine.</b> We found the naphtyl/benzyl-L-alaninyl phosphate motif (present in prodrug NUC- 3073) instrumental to confer resistance to enzymatic breakdown by human and prokaryotic NPs. Therefore, and in contrast to <b>floxuridine,</b> NUC- 3073 retained its activity in mycoplasma-infected tumor cells remarkably well. Furthermore, this drug successfully delivered the active (phosphorylated) metabolite of <b>floxuridine</b> (5 -fluoro- 2 -deoxyuridine- 5 -monophosphate) into the intact tumor cells, independently of the presence of thymidine kinase (TK) activity. This compound may therefore represent a more resilient alternative for <b>floxuridine</b> and may also prove useful in the treatment of tumors with (acquired or inherent) TK-deficiency. NUC- 3073 is planned to enter phase I clinical trials for the treatment of colorectal cancer in 2014. In a next phase of our research we aimed at the design of a universal inhibitor that concomitantly targets both pyrimidine and purine NPs. Most reported NP inhibitors are nucleoside derivatives with modifications in the nucleobase and therefore show high specific inhibitory activity against one type of NP. Instead, we aimed at the development of derivatives of (2 -deoxy) ribose- 1 -phosphate, the common product of all NP-catalyzed reactions to find a broad-acting NP inhibitor. We found that 3, 5 -dichlorobenzoyl-substituted 2 -deoxy-D-ribose- 1 -phosphate (Cf 2891) inhibited a variety of both mammalian and prokaryotic pyrimidine and purine NPs. Kinetic studies revealed that this compound competes with inorganic phosphate for binding to NPs and, depending on the nature of the inhibited enzyme, a competitive or non-competitive inhibition with regard to the nucleoside binding site was observed. Cf 2891 may therefore serve as a lead molecule for the development of potent broad-substrate NP inhibitors to simultaneously protect pyrimidine- and purine-based NAs from catabolism when administered in combination therapies. The study of mycoplasma-infected tumor cell cultures has allowed us to explore the relationship between mycoplasma infections and the (cytostatic/antiviral) efficiency of therapeutic NAs. Our results suggest that a mycoplasma infection at the tumor site (or a secondary mycoplasma infection in immunocompromised patients) may alter the therapeutic index of such drugs. In vivo studies in mice confirmed that the antitumor activity of gemcitabine and <b>floxuridine</b> is indeed compromised when treating mycoplasma-infected mammary tumors compared with uninfected control tumors. Due to experimental constraints in co-culturing prokaryotes (different from mycoplasmas) along with mammalian cells, it is currently unclear whether our results are also of relevance for other bacterial infections. We demonstrated that a rational choice of (pro) drugs or a combination therapy of NAs with (i) mycoplasma-targeting antibiotics or (ii) specific inhibitors of catabolic mycoplasma-encoded enzymes, may optimize the efficiency of chemotherapeutics in cell culture. Our findings justify that this principle should be further explored and validated in the clinical setting. status: publishe...|$|E

ICC makes up about 10 % of all cholangiocarcinomas. It arises from the peripheral bile ducts within the liver parenchyma, proximal to the secondary biliary radicals. Histologically, the majority of ICCs are adenocarcinomas. Only a minority of patients (15 %) present with resectable disease, with a median survival of less than 3 years. Multidisciplinary management of ICC is complicated by large differences in disease course for individual patients both across and within tumor stages. Risk models and nomograms have been developed to more accurately predict survival of individual patients based on clinical parameters. Predictive risk factors are necessary to improve patient selection for systemic treatments. Molecular differences between tumors, such as in the epidermal growth factor receptor status, are promising, but their clinical applicability should be validated. For patients with locally advanced disease, several treatment strategies are being evaluated. Both hepatic arterial infusion chemotherapy with <b>floxuridine</b> and yttrium- 90 embolization aim to downstage locally advanced ICC. Selected patients have resectable disease after downstaging, and other patients might benefit because of postponing widespread dissemination and biliary obstruction.
