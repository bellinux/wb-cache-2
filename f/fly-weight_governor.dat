40|$|This paper {{detailing}} {{the problem of}} speed fluctuation of IDI engine Rpm i. e. hunting and dipping. It is due to E-RPM adjustment assembly for mechanical centrifugal flyweight governor system. E-RPM adjustment assembly works mainly for high speed adjustment ampidle speed adjustment. In mechanical centrifugal flyweight governor system of IDI engine issue at idle rpm hunting and dipping issue was reported in field. New designs of plunger type stopper cover with compressed coil spring are proposed for E-RPM adjustment assembly for mechanical centrifugal <b>fly-weight</b> <b>governor</b> system. 3 D-Modeling of new design is done on Seimens NX. Kinematic simulation {{was done with the}} help of Altairs Motion-View amp Motion-Solver. Based on the results from MBD the prototype is made and tested in engine. As per the test results from engine testing with new design there is no hunting and dipping problem is reported at idle rpm...|$|E

The EDC replaces the mechanical control governor with an electro-magnetic control device.|$|R
