5|$|A {{break in}} the weather allowed the RAF to finally fly combat {{missions}} against the German forces surrounding Urquhart's men. Hawker Typhoons and Republic P-47 Thunderbolts strafed German positions throughout the day and occasionally dueled with the Luftwaffe over the battlefield. The RAF attempted their final resupply flight from Britain on the Saturday afternoon, but lost eight planes <b>for</b> <b>little</b> gain to the Airborne troops. Some small resupply efforts would be made from Allied airfields in Europe {{over the next two}} days but to little effect.|$|E
5|$|After {{being open}} <b>for</b> <b>little</b> {{more than a}} year, the school failed in February 1737, gaining Johnson a {{reputation}} as a failed schoolmaster. He slowly abandoned his desire to teach to focus more on writing his first major work, the historical tragedy Irene. The play did not earn him the money he had hoped for, though, until Garrick produced it in 1749.|$|E

5|$|After the Americans {{attacked}} the Philippines, Formosa and the Ryukyu Islands beginning on 10 October, the Japanese implemented their {{plan for the}} defense of these areas that required the transfer of most of Air Group 652 to Formosa and Luzon to attack the American forces, with only a few aircraft retained for carrier operations. Most of these aircraft were lost <b>for</b> <b>little</b> gain as the Americans suppressed Japanese defenses in the Philippines, preparatory to the actual invasion.|$|E
5|$|In 1894, after Smith {{returned}} from Germany, she published her second volume Songs <b>for</b> <b>Little</b> Children, Part 2. As in her previous work, {{most of the}} songs were in major keys with the most common being A-flat major and E-flat major. Second, third, fourth and fifth intervals were typical in her voice scores with the piano accompaniment creating interest through varied rhythm patterns. In this volume, most of the compositions were Smith's own work, {{though some of the}} pieces were adaptations of German folk songs.|$|E

5|$|Opinions differ {{as to the}} {{derivation}} of the name. One is the farmstead or {{village of}} a man named Aethelhere, an Old English personal name and the suffix tun, meaning an enclosure, farmstead or manor estate; another is adre, Saxon <b>for</b> <b>little</b> brook with the suffix tun. Either is possible as Atherton is bounded by brooks {{to the west and}} south, and crossed by several others. The western boundary is Hindsford Brook, originally named Goderic Brook after a Saxon saint.|$|E

Between them, the 30 production aircraft had only a total of 945 hours of flight time, only 31.5 hours each. Some aircraft flew only six hours which was enough <b>for</b> <b>little</b> more than their acceptance flight and the flight to their ultimate disposition.|$|E

5|$|The {{immediate}} Allied {{objective was}} Verrières Ridge, a belt of high ground which dominates the route from Caen to Falaise. The ridge was invested by battle-hardened German veterans, {{who had fallen}} back from Caen and entrenched to form a strong defensive position. Over the course of six days, substantial Canadian and British forces made repeated attempts to capture the ridge. Strict German adherence to defensive doctrine, as well as strong and effective counterattacks by Panzer formations, resulted in heavy Allied casualties <b>for</b> <b>little</b> strategic gain.|$|E
