Therefore, a product has been developed {{which can be used}} as an ingredient {{in a wide variety of}} dishes without presoaking or precooking. Dried green peas, chickpeas or lentils were soaked, cooked, homogenized and spray-dried. Proximate analyses were conducted on the pulse powders and compared to an instant mashed potato product. Because the health benefits of pulses may be due in part to their carbohydrate content, a detailed carbohydrate analysis was carried out on the pulse powders. Pulse powders were higher in protein and total dietary fibre and lower in starch than potato flakes. After processing, the pulse powders maintained appreciable amounts of resistant starch (4. 4 %– 5. 2 %).

Cowpea weevil pupae were fairly heat tolerant; to obtain rapid mortality (exposure < 10 min) temperatures of 56 - 58 °C were needed. At frequencies commonly used by industry for RF heating, dielectric loss factors for both adult and larval cowpea weevil was higher than those for legumes, suggesting that cowpea weevils would heat at a faster rate than the product. Previous studies showed that suitable heating uniformity during RF treatments was obtained through the addition of hot air (60 °C) and conveyor belt movement.

After forest had reached around 9 cal ka a quasi-stable altitudinal interval forest taxa continued to change proportions showing that upslope forest migration caused significant internal forest dynamics. Forest stability is not found suggesting that an equilibrium between forest composition and environmental variables was not reached. We hypothesize trees migrated faster upslope than the shrubs causing a temporarily loss of this shrub biome. During most of the Holocene the UFL varied between 3500 and 3700 m indicating warmer temperatures than today.

40|$|The {{timing of}} the last {{deglaciation}} in southern Chile is re-evaluated from a calendar varve chronology (Lago Puyehue, 40 degrees S). The climate shifts are analysed by continuous annual varve-thickness measurements through the similar to 17, 100 cal. year to 10, 800 cal. year BP time window (similar to 3. 5 m sediment core). The varve years {{are determined by the}} alternation of light (phytoplankton-rich) and dark (terrigenous and organic-rich) layers forming graded annual couplets (similar to 0. 2 to 0. 8 mm/year). The varve chronology is constructed by conventional varve-counting methods on thin sections after correction for instantaneous volcanic and/or seismic events detected in the thin sections. The calibrated varve-age model derived from the manual varve counting is constrained by high-resolution grey-scale (GS) semi-automatic counts of the annual light phytoplankton-rich layers (similar to 120 mu m to 300 mu m thick). Due to physical sediment properties the GS constitutes a proxy record for the phytoplankton/terrigenous varve-thickness variations through the sediment record. The varve couplets are thicker/thinner during humid/dry phases and darker/lighter (negative/positive annual grey-scale index) during cold/warm phases. Our results show that at 40 degrees S the last deglaciation took place in two phases between similar to 17, 100 cal. year and similar to 15, 500 cal. year BP. We note a climate instability between similar to 15, 500 cal. year and 13, 300 cal. year BP and a significant dry phase between similar to 15, 000 and 14, 500 cal. year BP. We evidence a cold event in two phases between similar to 13, 300 and 12, 200 cal. year BP interrupted by a dry event between similar to 12, 800 and 12, 600 cal. year BP.

Makinde and Aziz [33] analyzed steady incompressible flow of nanofluids towards stretching sheet with convective boundary condition using Boungiorno model. Moreover, RamReddy et al.

A project, involving a series of postharvest experiments on ‘White Prosperity’ gladiolus, was executed to develop protocols for postharvest handling of gladiolus, with special context to prevailing problems faced by growers and retailers in Pakistan. The results revealed that pulsing with 10 % sucrose for 24 h increased the vase life of gladiolus up to ~ 3 days relative to control (tap water). Harvesting the stems in the morning or evening was better than noon harvest, while the less the number of florets opened at harvest, the better was the postharvest performance of gladiolus. Wet type of storage was better for shorter durations of storage than <b>dry</b> storage. <b>Pulsing</b> with low concentration of nano-silver (NS) for short duration (50 mg L- 1 for one hour) significantly improved the postharvest characteristics of gladiolus, while among silver sources AgNO 3 (20 mg L- 1) performed better than Silver thiosulfate (STS) or NS.
