5|$|Baptism in the Holy Spirit occurs {{elsewhere}} in Acts. The gospel had been proclaimed in Samaria and the apostles Peter and John were sent from Jerusalem. The new believers had been baptized in water, but the Holy Spirit {{had not yet}} fallen on them. The Samaritans received the Holy Spirit when Peter and John laid their hands on them. The Apostle Paul was also <b>filled</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Holy Spirit when Ananias of Damascus laid hands on him, and afterwards Paul was baptized with water.|$|E
5|$|Everybody {{had thought}} St. Paul's Cathedral a safe refuge, with its thick stone walls and natural {{firebreak}} {{in the form}} of a wide, empty surrounding plaza. It had been crammed full of rescued goods and its crypt <b>filled</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> tightly packed stocks of the printers and booksellers in adjoining Paternoster Row. However, an enormous stroke of bad luck meant that the building was covered in wooden scaffolding, undergoing piecemeal restoration by a relatively unknown Christopher Wren. The scaffolding caught fire on Tuesday night.|$|E
5|$|In 2005, {{scientists}} reconstructed an endocast (replica) of an Acrocanthosaurus {{cranial cavity}} using computed tomography (CT scanning) {{to analyze the}} spaces within the holotype braincase (OMNH 10146). In life, much of this space would have been <b>filled</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> meninges and cerebrospinal fluid, {{in addition to the}} brain itself. However, the general features of the brain and cranial nerves could be determined from the endocast and compared to other theropods for which endocasts have been created. While the brain is similar to many theropods, it is most similar to that of allosauroids. It most resembles the brains of Carcharodontosaurus and Giganotosaurus rather than those of Allosaurus or Sinraptor, providing support for the hypothesis that Acrocanthosaurus was a carcharodontosaurid.|$|E

5|$|Within our Solar System, {{interplanetary space}} is <b>filled</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> plasma {{expelled}} via the solar wind, {{extending from the}} Sun's surface out to the heliopause. Furthermore, all the distant stars, and much of interstellar space or intergalactic space is also likely filled with plasma, albeit at very low densities. Astrophysical plasmas are also observed in Accretion disks around stars or compact objects like white dwarfs, neutron stars, or black holes in close binary star systems. Plasma is associated with ejection of material in astrophysical jets, which have been observed with accreting black holes or in active galaxies like M87's jet that possibly extends out to 5,000 light-years.|$|E
5|$|Another tradition, {{related by}} R.C. MacLeod, told of certain events {{which took place}} after an heir to the clan's chiefship was born. The story related how at this time, there was much rejoicing at Dunvegan Castle, and since the infant's nursemaid was anxious {{to join in the}} festivities in the hall below, she left the infant alone in her room. When the baby awoke, crying of cold, no human help could hear him in his secluded room; however, a host of fairies {{appeared}} and wrapped the infant in the Fairy Flag. Meanwhile, the clansmen banqueting below demanded to see the child and the maid was ordered to bring him forth. When she brought out the baby, wrapped in the flag, everyone gazed in wonder at the child and the garb wrapped around him. The room was <b>filled</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> fairies' song which declared that the flag had the power to save the clan three times. When the song ended, and silence fell across the crowded room, the flag was taken from the infant and locked in a chest where it has ever since been preserved.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{importance}} of Syracuse, the sources report scant efforts from the Byzantines to aid the city. Ibn al-Athir reports that a few Byzantine vessels appeared before the city and were defeated without difficulty, but the main Byzantine fleet {{appears to have been}} occupied with ferrying building material for the erection of Emperor Basil I the Macedonian's Nea Ekklesia church in Constantinople. When the fleet eventually sailed, under the command of a certain Adrianos, it was so delayed by contrary winds at Monemvasia that news of the city's fall reached it there. Unchallenged thus in their control of the sea, the Arabs were able to destroy the fortifications (βραχιόλια) protecting the city's two harbours: the incessant bombardment succeeded in collapsing one of the towers of the seaward fortifications, along with the adjoining stretch of walls, forming a breach where the Arabs concentrated their attack. Nevertheless, the patrikios of the city rallied the defenders, and for twenty days they managed to hold the breach against superior numbers, so that the surrounding area was <b>filled</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> dead and wounded.|$|E

5|$|Fool's Gold Loaf is a {{sandwich}} {{made by the}} Colorado Mine Company, a restaurant in Denver, Colorado. The sandwich consists of a single warmed, hollowed-out loaf of bread <b>filled</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> contents of one jar of creamy peanut butter, one jar of grape jelly, and a pound of bacon. The sandwich's connection to Elvis Presley {{is the source of}} its legend and prolonged interest. According to The Life and Cuisine of Elvis Presley, it was the focus of a midnight sandwich run by Elvis Presley and his friends. Taking his private jet from Graceland, Presley and his friends purchased 30 of the sandwiches and spent two hours eating them and drinking Perrier and champagne before flying home. The story became legend and the sandwich became the subject of continued media interest and part of numerous cookbooks, typically focused around Presley's love of food.|$|E
5|$|One {{challenge}} for the production team was how to convey Bella's depression once Edward departs. In the novel, these pages were <b>filled</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> names of the passing months, and in the movie, would be represented as a visual effects shot with a camera circling around Kristen Stewart. The window that {{was used for the}} original film did not quite fit what Weitz was looking for, so the production team created a bay window when recreating the Swan house. The effect was one of the 300 visual effects helmed by Prime Focus led by visual effects supervisor Eric Pascarelli. It required matching two camera shots: one that shot the actress in a chair, and the other shooting the view outside the window as seen from the house built on location. Using a greenscreen, Prime Focus was able to enhance the changing of seasons with computer-generated leaves and falling snow.|$|E
5|$|Picking up {{immediately}} after , in which Link defeats Ganon who turns to stone and {{remains at the}} bottom of a now sealed away Hyrule, Link and Tetra travel over the flooded Hyrule called the Great Sea on board Tetra's pirate ship. Along the way, the pair discover the Ghost Ship and Tetra enters it; however, immediately after entering the Ghost Ship, she screams for help. While Link attempts to follow her, he slips and falls into the ocean. Washed ashore on an island, Link is awakened by Ciela, a fairy. Exploring the island, Link finds the Phantom Hourglass, <b>filled</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Sands of Hours, and meets an old man named Oshus, who wants to help Link find the Ghost Ship and reunite with Tetra. To aid him in his quest, Link enlists the help of Captain Linebeck and his ship, the S.S. Linebeck, which Link, Ciela, and Linebeck use to visit islands across the Great Sea. While Linebeck was initially reluctant to team up with the two, Ciela makes mention of a huge treasure, prompting him to agree to help them.|$|E

5|$|The Fringe team {{is called}} {{to the scene of}} a robbery of a metal depository; the body of one of the thieves, shot by a {{security}} guard, inexplicably floats off the ground, while a second culprit has gotten away. They find that the thief has taken off with a supply of osmium, one of the densest elements, and an autopsy later reveals that the dead thief's body is <b>filled</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> metal. Tracking a security card on the body, they enter a warehouse where they find the second culprit, dead, along with the bodies of several more people, all of them paraplegic. Walter (John Noble) notes that the physical properties of osmium (both gravitational and thermal) have been reversed, and by melting the osmium collected from the first victim using liquid nitrogen, they detect the presence of the rarer element lutetium, typically only present in meteorites.|$|E
5|$|The clip {{starts with}} a bride reaching, on a limousine, the chapel on which she's about to get married. As she is shown walking inside the chapel's doors, Arjona starts to sing while sit on the chairs in the empty chapel. Then, the bride is shown again {{alongside}} the groom in the altar, ready to make the vows, while the chapel is <b>filled</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> invitees. Then, scenes of Arjona playing the piano and singing, and scenes of the ceremony are interpolated, showing the behaviour of the invitees. Later, the invitees are shown involved in discussions and fights while Arjona keeps singing the chorus and verses of the song. As the fights between the invitees increase, the groom rejects the bride and she, stunned, escapes from the chapel. Then, it is shown that all was an illusion from the bride, and they are shown exiting the chapel, married. As of 11 July 2012, the video has reached 14 million views on YouTube.|$|E
5|$|The {{earliest}} {{versions of}} the Varaha legend {{are found in the}} Taittiriya Aranyaka and the Shatapatha Brahmana. They narrate that the universe was <b>filled</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> primordial waters. The earth {{was the size of a}} hand and was trapped in it. The god Prajapati (the creator-god Brahma) in the form of a boar (varaha) plunges into the waters and brings the earth out. He also marries the earth thereafter. The Shatapatha Brahmana calls the boar as Emusha. The epic Ramayana and the Vishnu Purana - considered sometimes as the oldest of the Puranic scriptures - are the first to associate Varaha with Vishnu. Various Puranic scriptures including the Agni Purana, the Bhagavata Purana, the Devi Bhagavata Purana, the Padma Purana, the Varaha Purana, the Vayu Purana and the Vishnu Purana narrate the legend of Varaha with some variations.|$|E

5|$|The {{main problem}} {{encountered}} in deciphering {{the dynamics of}} the Jovian magnetosphere is the transport of heavy cold plasma from the Io torus at 6RJ to the outer magnetosphere at distances of more than 50RJ. The precise mechanism of this process is not known, but it is hypothesized to occur as a result of plasma diffusion due to interchange instability. The process is similar to the Rayleigh-Taylor instability in hydrodynamics. In the case of the Jovian magnetosphere, centrifugal force plays the role of gravity; the heavy liquid is the cold and dense Ionian (i.e. pertaining to Io) plasma, and the light liquid is the hot, much less dense plasma from the outer magnetosphere. The instability leads to an exchange between the outer and inner parts of the magnetosphere of flux tubes filled with plasma. The buoyant empty flux tubes move towards the planet, while pushing the heavy tubes, <b>filled</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Ionian plasma, away from Jupiter. This interchange of flux tubes is a form of magnetospheric turbulence.|$|E

Two drivers outside the top 35 were eligible for two transfer spots in each Duel which allowed them to qualify for the Daytona 500.|$|E
5|$|Visual display was prized. Brilliant {{colors were}} {{obtained}} by the addition of, for example, juices from spinach and the green part of leeks. Yellow came from saffron or egg yolk, while red came from sunflower, and purple came from Crozophora tinctoria or Heliotropium europaeum. Gold and silver leaf were placed on food surfaces and brushed with egg whites. Elaborate and showy dishes were the result, such as tourte parmerienne which was a pastry dish {{made to look like}} a castle with chicken-drumstick turrets coated with gold leaf. One of the grandest showpieces of the time was roast swan or peacock sewn back into its skin with feathers intact, the feet and beak being gilded.
