This study intends to set up an original methodology for sludge residence time distribution (RTD) measurement in a continuous paddle dryer, based on the detection of mineral tracers by X-ray fluorescence. This accurate analytical technique offers a linear response to tracer concentration in dry sludge; the protocol leads to a good repeatability of RTD measurements. Its equivalence to RTD measurement by NaCl conductivity in sludge leachates is assessed. Moreover, it is shown that tracer solubility has no influence on RTD: liquid and solid phases have the same flow pattern. The application of this technique on sludge with different storage duration at 4 °C emphasizes the influence of this parameter on sludge RTD, and thus on paddle dryer performances: the mean residence time in a paddle dryer is almost doubled between 24 and 48 h of storage for identical operating conditions...|$|R

LSCI has attracted attention because {{it is able to}} image blood <b>flow</b> <b>in</b> different <b>kinds</b> of tissue with high spatial and temporal resolutions. Additionally, it is simple and necessitates low-cost devices. However, the physiological information that can be extracted directly from the images is not completely determined yet. In this work, a novel multi-dimensional complete ensemble empirical mode decomposition with adaptive noise (MCEEMDAN) is introduced and applied in LSCI data recorded in three physiological conditions (rest, vascular occlusion and post-occlusive reactive hyperaemia). MCEEMDAN relies on the improved complete ensemble empirical mode decomposition with adaptive noise (CEEMDAN) and our algorithm is specifically designed to analyze multi-dimensional data (such as images). Over the recent multi-dimensional ensemble empirical mode decomposition (MEEMD), MCEEMDAN has the advantage of leading to an exact reconstruction of the original data. The results show that MCEEMDAN leads to intrinsic mode functions and residue that reveal hidden patterns in LSCI data. Moreover, these patterns differ with physiological states.

Wild juveniles of milkfish and plankton samples were collected in a mangrove lagoon at Nabunut Island. Various types of food organisms found in the mangrove plankton samples and food components in the gut of milkfish were then tabulated and compared. The gut content of the fish examined showed a preponderance of detritus, plant debris and fine sand particles. These organic materials without mixture of live food organisms were found in 64. 5 % of the fish collected. Other food ingested consisted of live food organisms but their proportion in the gut was smaller compared to the proportion found in the natural environment. Milkfish juveniles, upon entering depositional environments, prefer to feed on detritus. The pathway of energy <b>flow</b> <b>in</b> the <b>kind</b> of environment is for the food to pass through a detrital chain before being utilized by milkfish.

The experiments were carried out with the modules using a commercial flat NF membrane to investigate the effects of Reynolds number (Re) and flow channel structures on the flux of permeate and Mg 2 + rejection.

40|$|International audienceA falling film micro-absorber (FFM) is used {{to treat}} gas {{effluents}} containing a chlorinated VOC. In such operation, mass transfer can be enhanced by optimizing micro-absorber geometry and operating conditions. Firstly, the influence of gas cavity thickness and gas flow rate on absorption performances, were investigated. Experimental study is performed {{for a range of}} cavity thickness between 2 and 6 mm and gas flow rate between 45 and 390 N mL/min. Results showed a significant improvement of absorption rate when cavity thickness is reduced, especially for low gas velocities. Indeed the global mass transfer coefficient K(G) a can be multiplied by 7 when cavity thickness is divided by a factor of 3. The mass transfer is then intensified and apparatus compactness is enhanced. The modeling of gas/liquid mass transfer (Monnier and Falk, 2011) indicated that mass transport is performed mainly by diffusion. A new simulations showed an important axial dispersion in gas concentrations profile when gas flow rate and gas cavity thickness are relatively high (t(G) = 5 - 6 mm, G(V) > 400 N mL/min). Then, to optimize micro-absorber performances, the integration of gas turbulence promoters must be considered. The second part of this paper concerns the characterization of gas-side mass transfer in the FFM. A dimensionless correlation is developed: Sh(G) = 2. 04 Re(G) (0. 23) Sc(G) (0. 5) (t(G) /Z) (0. 17) When compared to other relations found in literature, this correlation characterizes gas laminar <b>flow</b> <b>in</b> this <b>kind</b> of micro-structured device...|$|R

This analysis is of interest in evaluating the performance of velocity-measurement systems based on the Doppler effect. Specifically, in laser Doppler anemometry (LDA) it is usual to receive bursts with a poor signal-to-noise ratio, yet high accuracy is required for the measurement. In recent years special {{attention has been paid to}} the problem of monitoring the temporal evolution of turbulent <b>flows.</b> <b>In</b> this <b>kind</b> of situation averaging or filtering the data sequences cannot be allowed: in a rapidly changing environment each one of the measurements should rather be performed within a maximum permissible error and the bursts strongly affected by noise removed.

This paper has two parts. In the first an approximate expression for the error committed in LDA is derived and discussed. In the second a mathematical formalism for the exact calculation of the error as a function of the signal-to-noise ratio is obtained, and some universal curves for the expected error are provided.

40|$|A {{numerical}} {{method for}} particle-laden fluids interacting with a deformable solid domain and mobile rigid parts is proposed and implemented {{in a full}} engineering system. The fluid domain is modeled with a lattice Boltzmann representation, the particles and rigid parts are modeled with a discrete element representation, and the deformable solid domain is modeled using a Lagrangian mesh. The main issue of this work, since separately each of these methods is a mature tool, is to develop coupling and model-reduction approaches in order to efficiently simulate coupled problems of this nature, as occur in various geological and engineering applications. The lattice Boltzmann method incorporates a large-eddy simulation technique using the Smagorinsky turbulence model. The discrete element method incorporates spherical and polyhedral particles for stiff contact interactions. A neo-Hookean hyperelastic model {{is used for the}} deformable solid. We provide a detailed description of how to couple the three solvers within a unified algorithm. The technique we propose for rubber modeling/coupling exploits a simplification that prevents having to solve a finite-element problem each time step.

The study was conducted over a two-week period with 163 elementary level university students and their eight instructors of English in eight different speaking classes at Zonguldak Karaelmas University English Language Preparatory School. Designated speaking tasks were class discussion, role-play, language games, interview, information-gap, problem solving, picture narration, and storytelling. Data were collected through the administration of a questionnaire to measure students’ affective responses to tasks after each designated task, a short survey on teachers’ perceptions about each task and interviews with these eight teachers about their perceptions about flow theory, their <b>flow</b> experiences <b>in</b> their lessons {{and the degree to which}} students experience <b>flow</b> <b>in</b> the activities. Student means were used to investigate the motivational potential of tasks. Data were further analyzed using ANOVA tests in order to explore the differences in the experience of flow among the eight different activities. The qualitative and quantitative analyses indicated that <b>flow</b> exists <b>in</b> language classes; however, there is a significant difference among each task. The findings revealed that the class discussion activity produced more flow for both teachers and the students, whereas the information-gap activity resulted in more apathy. Results also showed that there is a significant relationship between the type of the activity and affective engagement in terms of students’ perception of task control, task appeal, focused attention and challenge. Overall the analysis showed that when activities included the four dimensions of flow, the students were more likely to perceive flow. The findings also revealed that teachers could facilitate the flow experience for students by developing tasks that might lead to flow. Lastly, the findings showed that an interactional pattern of group work produced significantly better results. Şentürk, Burcu AkM. S...|$|R

The paper adds to the theoretical understanding of household based linkages and provides a documentation of <b>in</b> <b>kind</b> commodity <b>flows</b> missing <b>in</b> many discussions of such linkages. The purpose of the paper is twofold: First, it sheds light on the phenomenon of <b>in</b> <b>kind</b> transfers of staple crops in the Kenyan context. Secondly, the article assesses the wider reciprocal and livelihood implications for the transferring households. The paper relies on three sets of data with respect to the methodology. It uses quantitative data collected at the household level in 2008, qualitative data collected at the village level in 2002 and 2008 as well as qualitative household level data gathered through in depth interviews with 30 heads of household and farm managers in Western Kenya in June and July of 2006. The survey found that 38 % of the households transferred maize to their relatives. The explanations for <b>in</b> <b>kind</b> transfers are not primarily related to poor price incentives, but the functioning of household support systems across space. <b>In</b> <b>kind</b> transfers therefore at times drain the food resources of the sending households while constituting important sources of food security for receiving households. While the focus in the literature generally is on rural urban linkages, the direction of maize transfers was primarily rural to rural.
