50|$|In {{one theory}} of life {{insurance}}, needs based analysis, life insurance is only needed {{to the extent}} that assets left behind by a person will not be enough to meet the income and capital needs of his or her dependents. In one form of variable universal life insurance, the cost of insurance purchased is based only on the difference between the death benefit and the cash value (defined as the <b>net</b> <b>amount</b> at risk {{from the perspective of the}} insurer). Therefore, the greater the cash value accumulation, the lesser the <b>net</b> <b>amount</b> at risk, and the less insurance that is purchased.|$|R

The <b>net</b> <b>amount</b> of NaPi-IIa {{appears to be the}} result of an endocytotic rate regulated by a complex network of different protein kinases. New approaches demonstrated that NaPi-IIa is part of heteromeric protein complexes, organized by PDZ (postsynaptic protein PSD 95, Drosophila junction protein Disc-large, tight junction protein ZO- 1) proteins. Such complexes are thought to play important roles in the apical positioning and regulated endocytosis of NaPi-IIa and therefore such interactions have to be considered when explaining proximal phosphate ion reabsorption...|$|R

The gross contribution is the total contribution paid, not including any discounts and rebates.

40|$|Many natural {{antioxidant}} extracts {{were reported}} to potentially reduce the acrylamide formation during Maillard reaction. In this work, the effect of pure antioxidant molecules on acrylamide <b>net</b> <b>amount</b> was investigated in an equimolar asparagine-glucose system (10 mM) during heating (200 _C). All experimentations were performed in the newly designed test cell. Cinnamic acid and six phenolic compounds (gallic, ferulic, coumaric, caffeic acids, catechin, and epicatechin), displaying different antioxidant capacity, were added at 5 mM to the model system. The results indicated no reduction effect of the tested compounds on acrylamide <b>net</b> <b>amount.</b> Moreover, {{in the case of}} ferulic acid a slight but significant promoting effect was observed. An increase of antioxidant activity was also noticed during heating of model solution spiked with caffeic acid but the acrylamide level was not affected. (Résumé d'auteur...|$|R
40|$|It {{is known}} that asset {{exchange}} models with symmetric interaction between agents show either a Gibbs/log-normal distribution of assets among the agents or condensation of the entire wealth {{in the hands of}} a single agent, depending upon the rules of exchange. Here we explore the effects of introducing asymmetry in the interaction between agents with different amounts of wealth (i. e., the rich behave differently from the poor). This can be implemented in several ways: e. g., (1) in the <b>net</b> <b>amount</b> of wealth that is transferred from one agent to another during an exchange interaction, or (2) the probability of gaining vs. losing a <b>net</b> <b>amount</b> of wealth from an exchange interaction. We propose that, in general, the introduction of asymmetry leads to Pareto-like power law distribution of wealth. ...|$|R
