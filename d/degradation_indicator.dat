More specifically, ITU-T Recommendation P. 862 (perceptual evaluation of speech quality-PESQ), which provides a perceptual modeling approach with which the subjectively perceived speech quality can be predicted, is used {{as a starting point for}} a degradation decomposition algorithm. This algorithm decomposes the perceived degradation into three different contributions by finding specific degradation indicators that quantify the impact of each type of degradation separately. The first <b>degradation</b> <b>indicator</b> quantifies the impact of additive noise as found in many speech-processing situations, such as when unwanted background noise is sent over a voice connection. The second <b>degradation</b> <b>indicator</b> quantifies the impact of linear timeinvariant frequency response distortions as. for example, introduced by a band-limited telephone system. The last <b>degradation</b> <b>indicator</b> quantifies the impact of the time-varying behavior of the system under test.

40|$|Remaining {{useful life}} (RUL) {{prediction}} can provide early warnings {{of failure and}} has become a key component in the prognostics and health management of systems. Among the existing methods for RUL prediction, the Wiener-process-based method has attracted great attention owing to its favorable properties and flexibility in degradation modeling. However, shortcomings exist in methods of this type; for example, the <b>degradation</b> <b>indicator</b> and the first predicting time (FPT) are selected subjectively, which reduces the prediction accuracy. Toward this end, this paper proposes a new approach for predicting the RUL of rotating machinery based on an optimal degradation indictor. First, a genetic programming algorithm is proposed to construct an optimal <b>degradation</b> <b>indicator</b> using the concept of FPT. Then, a Wiener model based on the obtained optimal <b>degradation</b> <b>indicator</b> is proposed, in which the sensitivities of the dimensionless parameters are utilized to determine the FPT. Finally, the expectation of the predicted RUL is calculated based on the proposed model, and the estimated mean degradation path is explicitly derived. To demonstrate the validity of this model, several experiments on RUL prediction are conducted on rotating machinery. The experimental results indicate that the method can effectively improve the accuracy of RUL prediction...|$|E

40|$|International audienceRecently, new {{objective}} {{speech quality}} evaluation methods, designed and adapted to new high voice quality contexts, have been developed. One interest {{of these methods}} is that they integrate voice quality perceptual dimensions reflecting the effects of frequency-response distortions, discontinuities, noise and/or speech level deviations respectively. This {{makes it possible to}} use these methods also to provide diagnostic information about specific aspects of the transmission systems' quality, as perceived by end-users. In this paper, we present and analyze in depth two of these approaches namely POLQA (Perceived Objective Listening Quality Assessment) and DIAL (Diagnostic Instrumental Assessment of Listening quality), in terms of quality <b>degradation</b> <b>indicators</b> related to the perceptual dimensions these models could embed. The main goal of our work is to find and propose the most robust quality <b>degradation</b> <b>indicators</b> to reliably characterize the impact of degradations relative to the perceptual dimensions described above and to identify the underlying technical causes in super wideband telephone communications [50, 14000] Hz. To do so, the first step of our study was to identify in both models the correspondence between perceptual dimensions and quality <b>degradation</b> <b>indicators.</b> Such indicators could be either present in the model itself or derived from our own investigation of the model.

The information from an asset health inspection {{can be divided into}} two types. (1) Direct indicators which directly determine failures (e. g. the thickness of a brake pad, or the wear in a component) and (2) indirect indicators which are not related to failures directly (e. g. vibration signals or oil analysis results). The direct indicators can provide more precise reference for the maintenance strategy determination.

40|$|Estimating and {{predicting}} degradation {{processes of}} engineering assets {{is crucial for}} reducing the cost and insuring the productivity of enterprises. Assisted by modern condition monitoring (CM) technologies, most asset degradation processes can be revealed by various <b>degradation</b> <b>indicators</b> extracted from CM data. Maintenance strategies developed using these <b>degradation</b> <b>indicators</b> (i. e. condition-based maintenance) are more cost-effective, because unnecessary maintenance activities are avoided when an asset is still in a decent health state. A practical difficulty in condition-based maintenance (CBM) is that <b>degradation</b> <b>indicators</b> extracted from CM data can only partially reveal asset health states in most situations. Underestimating this uncertainty in relationships between <b>degradation</b> <b>indicators</b> and health states can cause excessive false alarms or failures without pre-alarms. The state space model provides an efficient approach to describe a degradation process using these indicators that can only partially reveal health states. However, existing state space models that describe asset degradation processes largely depend on assumptions such as, discrete time, discrete state, linearity, and Gaussianity. The discrete time assumption requires that failures and inspections only happen at fixed intervals. The discrete state assumption entails discretising continuous <b>degradation</b> <b>indicators,</b> which requires expert knowledge and often introduces additional errors. The linear and Gaussian assumptions are not consistent with nonlinear and irreversible degradation processes in most engineering assets. This research proposes a Gamma-based state space model {{that does not have}} discrete time, discrete state, linear and Gaussian assumptions to model partially observable degradation processes. Monte Carlo-based algorithms are developed to estimate model parameters and asset remaining useful lives. In addition, this research also develops a continuous state partially observable semi-Markov decision process (POSMDP) to model a degradation process that follows the Gamma-based state space model and is under various maintenance strategies. Optimal maintenance strategies are obtained by solving the POSMDP. Simulation studies through the MATLAB are performed; case studies using the data from an accelerated life test of a gearbox and a liquefied natural gas industry are also conducted. The results show that the proposed Monte Carlo-based EM algorithm can estimate model parameters accurately. The results also show that the proposed Gamma-based state space model have better fitness result than linear and Gaussian state space models when used to process monotonically increasing degradation data in the accelerated life test of a gear box. Furthermore, both simulation studies and case studies show that the prediction algorithm based on the Gamma-based state space model can identify the mean value and confidence interval of asset remaining useful lives accurately. In addition, the simulation study shows that the proposed maintenance strategy optimisation method based on the POSMDP is more flexible than that assumes a predetermined strategy structure and uses the renewal theory. Moreover, the simulation study also shows that the proposed maintenance optimisation method can obtain more cost-effective strategies than a recently published maintenance strategy optimisation method by optimising the next maintenance activity and the waiting time till the next maintenance activity simultaneously...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to gain further insight into b-carotene thermal {{degradation}} in oils. Multiresponse modeling was applied to experimental highperformance liquid chromatography–diode array detection (HPLC–DAD) data (trans-, 13 -cis-, and 9 -cis-b-carotene concentrations) during the heat treatments (120 – 180 C) of two b-carotene-enriched oils, i. e., palm olein and copra. The test of different reaction schemes showed that b-carotene isomerization reactions were dominant and reversible. The resulting cis isomers and trans-b-carotene simultaneously underwent oxidation and cleavage reactions at the same rate constant. From the kinetic analysis, it appeared that—contrary to oxidation and cleavage reactions—isomerization rate constants did not follow the Arrhenius law. However, the isomerization equilibrium constant increased with temperature, favoring isomer production, particularly 9 -cis-b-carotene.

Different graphical structures based on Markov automata, called topologies, are proposed. We designed a Synthetic Hidden Markov Model based on a real industrial process. This Synthetic Model is intended to produce industrial maintenance observations (or “symbols”), with a corresponding <b>degradation</b> <b>indicator.</b> These time series events are shown as Markov chains, also called “signatures”. The production of symbols is generated by using a Uniform and a Normal distribution. Hence, we implemented these various symbols in proposed topologies using Baum-Welch learning algorithm decoding by Forward Variable and Segmental K-means learning, decoding by Viterbi. Through different measurements on model outputs, these frameworks (a topology with a learning & decoding algorithm and a distribution) are compared {{to determine the best}} part of criteria applied to observations. Assessment results show significant differences between the various frameworks studied. After determining the most relevant framework, we developed an industrial application and compared it with the best model framework found. Finally, we propose a model adjustment to fit the industrial maintenance activities studied. Our aim is to produce the best Synthetic Model framework to be used to improve maintenance policy, worker safety and process reliability in the industrial sector.

40|$|International audienceAs {{electrochemical}} {{power sources}} technologies, namely Li-ion batteries and PEM fuel cells, continue advancing, ways {{to extend their}} lifespan have to be pursued. With prognostics and health management (PHM) approach, several techniques can provide estimation of state of health (SOH) and prediction of remaining useful life (RUL) {{in order to help}} the manufacturers improving performance. Before developing a solution, PHM issues need to be properly defined, in particular in terms of deterioration/ageing indicators used for SOH estimation and RUL prediction. This paper reviews the ageing phenomena of batteries and fuel cells in order to investigate how to define suitable <b>degradation</b> <b>indicators</b> for these devices. Since Li-ion battery' PHM is much more developed, their similarities and differences have thus been studied as an exploration path of how proton exchange membrane fuel cell (PEMFC) could benefit from the battery knowledge and experience feedback. Even if no innovative solutions are emerging, the relevance of the covariates used for PEMFC and batteries ageing indicators are argued, providing a first step to build a suitable PHM approach for electrochemical devices...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{introduces}} a novel set of electric motor degradation cost functions based on energy usage, energy loss and work output, against their continuous operation rated values {{recommended by the}} manufacturer. Unlike conventional electric motor <b>degradation</b> <b>indicators</b> such as the bearing life and insulation life based service factors, these cost functions account for the quantified time in the degradation process. The cost functions are evaluated throughout the operational life of the motor using real-time measurements. Hence, they give a very accurate indication, which may be adapted for online controller tuning. This solid establishment of a degradation cost function also enables the system designer to give the user a choice between performance and degradation minimization. The proposed cost function scheme has experimentally been verified using a hardware-in-the-loop electric powertrain test-rig where standard drive cycles are used to conduct the experiments. The experimental results reveal that the degradation cost functions Cumulative Input Energy Ratio (CIER), Cumulative Loss Ratio (CLR) and Cumulative Work Ratio (CWR) accurately represent the electric motor degradation both qualitatively and quantitatively...|$|R
40|$|Underground {{medium voltage}} XLPE cables {{are at risk}} of failure from water tree {{degradation}} and it is vital that water tree degraded cables be detected in a power system network before they can cause outages. Time domain and frequency domain diagnostic techniques can be used to assess the insulation condition but the interpretation of the results from these measurements, and how they are correlated with <b>degradation</b> <b>indicators</b> such as water tree density and length, is unquestionably difficult. This paper intends to investigate the polarisation and conduction mechanisms within water tree degraded cables, paying particular interest to the effect of space charge accumulation at the water tree tip. It is postulated in this paper that the electric field at the tree-tip will be strong enough, from the contribution of space charge, to induce non-linear effects in the local surrounding, healthy XLPE. It is predicted that this non-linear effect will act to 2 ̆ 7 amplify 2 ̆ 7 the healthy XLPE response to a higher magnitude, resulting in higher losses, polarisation and conduction...|$|R
