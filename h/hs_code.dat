The coprocessor {{is based on an}} innovative algorithm known as the MZ-coder and maintains the original coding efficiency with a multiplication-free, non-stalling, fully pipelined architecture with modest hardware requirements. The coprocessor is tightly coupled to an opensource configurable RISC processor implementing the SPARC V 8 ISA with the RISC CPU executing the rest of the <b>H</b> 264 <b>code.</b> The video coding system has been integrated in a PCI-based SoPC platform and functionality and performance have been verified.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} investigates how language attitudes affect linguistic stratification {{and language}} use among Moroccan youth. The language situation in urban Morocco offers a unique venue for exploring how different linguistic codes, be they exogenous or endogenous, are represented and seek legitimacy and presence in contested and negotiated social domains. This dissertation brings a current understanding of language practices among youth in Morocco {{and contributes to}} a broader understanding of the sociolinguistic situation in Morocco and in the Arab world. Focus group participants use different discursive strategies to contest or rationalize the hegemonic discourse of modernity that shapes and is shaped by their language attitudes that they project toward different languages in Morocco. Studies on language attitudes have traditionally argued for aligning languages through covert and overt prestige, where local languages represent aspects of local culture, while the outward projection of social mobility motivates the acquisition {{and use of the}} transplanted varieties (Labov 1972; Trudgill 1983; Bentahila 1983; Marley 2004). Using a matched guise test, this dissertation broadens the scope of sociolinguistic research to analyze the covert language attitudes that shape the presence of <b>H</b> <b>codes</b> (Standard Arabic and French) and an L code (Moroccan Arabic). This analysis of covert attitudes shows that these languages are not uniformly distributed along the poles of status and solidarity but rather are competing for both. In addition to the investigation of language attitudes using critical discourse analysis and two matched guise tests, this dissertation contributes to the theoretical understanding of sociolinguistic research in Morocco by analyzing an overt language attitudes questionnaire. The main theoretical focus of the questionnaire provides us with an understanding of overt language attitudes, analyzed using diglossia and socioeconomic class stratifications, as well as reported language use, analyzed intergenerationally and by socioeconomic class. In spite of the maintenance of diglossia between local languages, namely Standard Arabic, Moroccan Arabic, and Berber, these results show how French and MA-French codeswitching permeate into lower functional domains, which undermine the presence of local languages. The results of this dissertation show that different data methods produce different results; therefore, the theoretical contribution of this dissertation is that more than one method of data collection must be used in order to validate a theory and more than one method of data analysis must be investigated before making any theoretical claims. The second theoretical contribution of this dissertation is that L codes do not hold exclusive appropriation to L domains. While MA and Berber in L domains are maintained through diglossia, which prevents the <b>H</b> <b>code</b> of SA from entering these domains, French has started to negotiate its presence in these L domains. This dissertation challenges the theoretical assumption that allocates <b>H</b> <b>codes</b> to the projection of overt prestige and L codes solely to solidarity, by testing covert attitudes within a pilot Matched Guise Test between SA and French, two <b>H</b> <b>codes,</b> and then adding the L code of MA to further test the relationship between the L and <b>H</b> <b>codes</b> in terms of status and solidarity. The empirical results of this dissertation challenge the conceptual understanding of language attitudes in Morocco and show a stratified outlook of these attitudes, divided along socioeconomic class lines. Thus, using data from Matched Guise Tests, a language attitudes questionnaire, and a focus group, this study reanalyzes the motivations behind the current attitudinal distribution toward different languages in Morocco, as well as the functional stratification these codes in various social domains...|$|R

This {{is the only}} SITC category that consists of unique, non-reproducible art, which is typically thought of as [...] "fine" [...] art.

5000|$|If not {{traveling}} with the goods, which are shipped, one must use other customs declaration forms, such as: a commercial invoice, or a proforma invoice, or an import declaration form, or an ATA Carnet, or a re-export declaration. Incoterms on these forms define the shipment and customs declaration. For example, the form many require an <b>Hs</b> <b>code</b> (harmonize code), which helps define the type of goods and their associated tax rate, if any. Also, the forms normally require the traveler to note the country of origin of the goods and may sometimes require a certificate of origin. These forms {{can also be used}} when hand carrying goods across a border. Errors on the forms can cause delays or confiscation of the goods. For that reason, importers often use a customs brokerage to clear goods through customs.|$|E
5000|$|For {{products}} {{which require}} Chinese certificates, {{copies of the}} respective documents (CCC, CEL, CFDA, CRCC, HAF 604, etc.) must be enclosed to the exporting goods. Depending on the applicable regulations, the certified products have to be marked and a printing permission has to be obtained. In case that assembled products are certified as a system, it is of importance to send the goods assembled to China. Otherwise {{it is possible that}} the customs officers demand certificates for every single components. Many companies expect a smooth customs clearance process in China because their products are not mandatory for a certification. However, it often occurs that products are detained in customs clearance with a note saying certifications are required. In most cases, the <b>HS</b> <b>Code,</b> product name or a product specification implies a certification obligation so that customs officers expect a certificate. If products are wrongfully detained in customs but the products are not obliged for a certification, the manufacturer still has to cover the costs for storage, destroying the goods or send them back to the country of origin.|$|E
