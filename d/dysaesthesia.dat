40|$|Six of 48 stroke {{patients}} had functionally limiting <b>dysaesthesiae</b> induced by repetitive light touch, joint movement, or neuromuscular electrical stimulation (NMS). Only {{one of these}} six {{patients had}} a thalamic lesion. Quantitative sensory testing showed substantial impairment of pain and temperature sensation in all six patients, whereas light touch, vibration and position sense, and graphaesthesia were normal (three patients) or relatively spared (three patients). By contrast, none of 15 stroke patients in whom NMS did not evoke <b>dysaesthesiae</b> had clinical evidence of dissociated sensory loss. Conscious perception of joint movement and light touch is mediated mainly by the same population of large myelinated fibres activated preferentially by low intensity electrical stimulation. It is suggested that activation of these non-nociceptive, presumably dorsal column, afferents may contribute to <b>dysaesthesiae</b> in some patients with sensory loss after stroke...|$|R

2500|$|The {{search for}} {{biological}} origins of psychological phenomena has long involved {{debates about the}} importance of race, and especially the relationship between race and intelligence. The idea of white supremacy and indeed the modern concept of race itself arose during the process of world conquest by Europeans. Carl von Linnaeus's four-fold classification of humans classifies Europeans as intelligent and severe, Americans as contented and free, Asians as ritualistic, and Africans as lazy and capricious. Race was also used to justify the construction of socially specific mental disorders such as drapetomania and <b>dysaesthesia</b> aethiopica—the behavior of uncooperative African slaves. After the creation of experimental psychology, [...] "ethnical psychology" [...] emerged as a subdiscipline, {{based on the assumption that}} studying primitive races would provide an important link between animal behavior and the psychology of more evolved humans.|$|E
2500|$|The {{imbalance}} in sensation characterized by Dejerine–Roussy syndrome {{can be argued}} through a model addressing a system of inputs and outputs that the brain must constantly process throughout life, suggesting latent plasticity. The right and left hemispheres of the brain both play important roles in the sensory input and output. When a stroke damages one hemisphere, it is proposed that the other hemisphere will cope with the discrepancies in a specific manner. The left hemisphere tends to [...] "gloss over" [...] discrepancies from inputs, eliciting either denial or rationalization defense mechanisms in order to stabilize said discrepancy. In contrast, the right hemisphere does the opposite, and {{will focus on the}} discrepancy, and motivate action to be taken to restore equilibrium. Therefore, damage to the left hemisphere can cause both an indifference to pain and hypersensitivity to pain (<b>dysaesthesia</b> or allodynia), while damage to the right hemisphere can cause denial as a defense mechanism (anosognosia and somatoparaphrenia).|$|E

30|$|Meralgia paraesthetica (Greek: Meros Algos, meaning thigh pain) is {{the name}} of the {{clinical}} syndrome caused by damage to the lateral cutaneous nerve of the thigh. This causes various sensory symptoms over the antero-lateral aspect of the thigh [6]. The diagnosis is easy to make on clinical grounds. The patient complains of varying degrees of pain, burning, numbness, paraesthesiae, and <b>dysaesthesiae</b> over the antero-lateral aspect of the thigh. Rarely, confirmation is needed by nerve conduction studies, which may show a reduction in sensory conduction velocity and/or reduction in amplitude or absence of the response [7]. The condition may resolve on its own [8]. Therefore, reassurance may be the only advice needed, especially if the condition is mild. For more severe cases, other treatments are suggested including local anaesthetic infiltration and nerve block, decompression (neurolysis), and rarely neurectomy [6].|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVES: Previous {{studies of}} {{small numbers of}} {{patients}} have shown that antisulphatide autoantibodies are associated with polyneuropathies having a prominent sensory component. However, clinical and electrodiagnostic features are variable. The range of clinical and electrodiagnostic findings in 19 patients with polyneuropathies and high titre (> 4500) serum IgM antisulphatide antibodies is described, together with testing for serum monoclonal (M) proteins. METHODS: About 20000 serum samples that were referred to the clinical laboratory from 1990 {{to the end of}} 1994 were screened by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for specific high titre antisulphatide antibodies. The clinical and electrodiagnostic data in 23 patients with positive results were reviewed. IgM binding to peripheral nerve structures was also evaluated in these patients. RESULTS: Nineteen patients had predominantly distal, symmetric pansensory loss. Patients with IgM antisulphatide antibodies and no serum M protein usually had clinical syndromes that included: (1) neuropathic pain or <b>dysaesthesiae,</b> (2) no functionally significant weakness, and (3) an axonal neuropathy on electrodiagnostic testing. On immunocytochemical studies serum IgM from the patients without M proteins usually (nine of 10; 90 %) bound to peripheral nerve axons, but never to myelin. Patients with antisulphatide antibodies and a serum M protein, usually IgM, were more likely than patients without a serum M protein, to have syndromes with: (1) no pain or <b>dysaesthesiae,</b> (2) motor abnormalities, and (3) a demyelinating polyneuropathy by electrodiagnostic criteria. In immunocytochemical studies serum IgM most often bound to either peripheral nerve myelin or endoneurial structures. CONCLUSION: Patients with polyneuropathy and high titre serum IgM antisulphatide antibodies can be classified into subgroups according to {{the presence or absence of}} a serum M protein. Patients without an M protein are more likely to have pure sensory syndromes, pain, an axonal neuropathy, and serum IgM binding to axons. Patients with a serum M protein commonly had syndromes with prominent motor involvement, no pain, and a demyelinating neuropathy...|$|R

40|$|SUMMARY Nine {{patients}} in whom subacute myelo-opticoneuropathy (SMON) {{was diagnosed with}} varying degrees of confidence are discussed. The cases were discovered after a retrospective examina-tion of our records for the period 1967 - 71, and a prospective search from March 1972 to date. Sub-acute myelopathy with predominant <b>dysaesthesiae</b> and greater involvement of the pyramidal tracts was seen more often than fully developed SMON.

40|$|Ciguatera is a {{widespread}} ichthyosarcotoxaemia with dramatic and clinically important neurological features. This severe form of fish poisoning may present with either acute or chronic intoxication syndromes and constitutes a global health problem. Ciguatera poisoning is little known in temperate countries as a potentially global problem associated with human ingestion of large carnivorous fish that harbour the bioaccumulated ciguatoxins of the photosynthetic dinoflagellate Gambierdiscus toxicus. This neurotoxin is stored in the viscera of fish that have eaten the dinoflagellate and concentrated it upwards throughout the food chain towards progressively larger species, including humans. Ciguatoxin accumulates in all fish tissues, especially the liver and viscera, of "at risk" species. Both Pacific (P-CTX- 1) and Caribbean (C-CTX- 1) ciguatoxins are heat stable polyether toxins and pose a health risk at concentrations above 0. 1 ppb. The presenting signs of ciguatera are primarily neurotoxic in more than 80 % of cases. Such include the pathognomonic features of postingestion paraesthesiae, <b>dysaesthesiae,</b> and heightened nociperception. Other sensory abnormalities include the subjective features of metallic taste, pruritis, arthralgia, myalgia, and dental pain. Cerebellar dysfunction, sometimes diphasic, and weakness due to both neuropathy and polymyositis may be encountered. Autonomic dysfunction leads to hypotension, bradycardia, and hypersalivation in severe cases. Ciguatoxins are potent, lipophilic sodium channel activator toxins which bind to the voltage sensitive (site 5) sodium channel on the cell membranes of all excitable tissues. Treatment depends on early diagnosis and the early administration of intravenous mannitol. The early identification of the neurological features in sentinel patients {{has the potential to}} reduce the number of secondary cases in cluster outbreaks. ...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the analgesic effect of transcranial direct current stimulation of the motor cortex and techniques of visual illusion, applied isolated or combined, in patients with neuropathic pain following spinal cord injury. In a sham controlled, double-blind, parallel group design, 39 patients were randomized into four groups receiving transcranial direct current stimulation with walking visual illusion or with control illusion and sham stimulation with visual illusion or with control illusion. For transcranial direct current stimulation, the anode was placed over the primary motor cortex. Each patient received ten treatment sessions during two consecutive weeks. Clinical assessment was performed before, after the last day of treatment, after 2 and 4 weeks follow-up and after 12 weeks. Clinical assessment included overall pain intensity perception, Neuropathic Pain Symptom Inventory and Brief Pain Inventory. The combination of transcranial direct current stimulation and visual illusion reduced the intensity of neuropathic pain significantly more than any of the single interventions. Patients receiving transcranial direct current stimulation and visual illusion experienced a significant improvement in all pain subtypes, while patients in the transcranial direct current stimulation group showed improvement in continuous and paroxysmal pain, and those in the visual illusion group improved only in continuous pain and <b>dysaesthesias.</b> At 12 weeks after treatment, the combined treatment group still presented significant improvement on the overall pain intensity perception, whereas no improvements were reported in the other three groups.

40|$|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The {{frequency}} {{of pain and}} cramps is uncertain in anti-myelin associated glycoprotein antibody (anti-MAG) neuropathy. Whether these symptoms may affect function/quality of life is unknown. METHODS: A cross-sectional study of the prevalence, correlates and impact of pain, pain subtypes and cramps, their severity, frequency and anatomical distribution was performed for 55 clinically stable patients with anti-MAG neuropathy. RESULTS: Pain of any type was reported by 80 % of subjects. The most common subtype was paraesthesiae and <b>dysaesthesiae</b> (70 %). Cramps were reported by > 60 % of patients, with lower limb cramps in all and upper limb cramps in about 20 %. Cramps affected daily activities in > 30 % of these subjects, sleep in 60 %, ability to exercise in > 30 %. Total pain score correlated with several Short Form 36 health-related quality of life (SF- 36 HR-QoL) measures (P <  0. 05), with Inflammatory Rasch-built Overall Disability Scale (I-RODS) (P =  0. 006) and 10 -m timed walk (P =  0. 019). An independent association was ascertained with I-RODS (P =  0. 002). Different pain subtypes showed multiple associations with SF- 36 HR-QoL measures and/or functional scales. Upper limb cramps had multiple SF- 36 HR-QoL functional correlates, with an independent association with the Overall Neuropathy Limitation Score (ONLS) (P =  0. 004). Cramp severity correlated with ONLS (P =  0. 04) and I-RODS (P =  0. 028) and inversely with level of physiotherapy input (P =  0. 009). Cramp frequency was associated with tremor score (P =  0. 004) and multiple SF- 36 HR-QoL subsections. CONCLUSIONS: Neuropathic pain and cramps may affect function {{and quality of life}} in anti-MAG neuropathy. Optimizing treatments of these symptoms, including by adequate levels of physiotherapy, may be beneficial in affected patients and requires further research...|$|R
40|$|Excessive perineural {{scarring}} {{may affect}} the result of peripheral nerve surgery. The ability of a novel implant material (ADCON-TIN) to prevent this complication was tested in 38 rats. Four weeks after a bilateral sciatic nerve external neurolysis, a secondary bilateral lysis of the adhesions was performed; ADCON-TIN was locally implanted at one side, while the contralateral side was left untreated. Four or 8 weeks later, perineural adhesions were dissected in 24 animals and graded blindly. Significantly fewer perineural adhesions were found in ADCON-TIN treated nerves compared with controls at both 4 and 8 weeks. Residual implant material or adverse effects were not observed at either time. Histological examination of the neurolysis sites in another 14 animals confirmed these findings at both time intervals. This study shows that ADCON-TIN is effective in inhibiting perineural dhesions, is resorbed within 4 weeks and is well tolerated. Journal of Hand Surgery (British and European Volume, 1997) 22 B: 3 : 331 - 335 Traumatic injuries, chronic inflammation, or simple surgical manipulations of the peripheral nerves are frequently followed by extraneural scar formation with thickening of the epineurium; this phenomenon, if severe, can lead to tethering and compression of periph-eral nerves. Tethering restricts nerve mobility during limb motion, and may lead ultimately to chronic stretch injury, and persistent nerve compression {{has been shown to}} produce nerve oedema, ischaemia nd inflammatory response.
