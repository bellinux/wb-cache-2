50|$|A {{suspension}} bridge works by hanging a roadway from cables or chains under tension. Though a few unstiffened {{suspension bridge}}s exist, a longitudinal stiffening truss or girder is usually added to prevent excessive {{movement of the}} deck. The cables pass over towers and are anchored at both ends. Conventional suspension bridges use massive concrete or rock anchorages to resist the cable’s tension. In self-anchored suspension bridges, however, the cables are fastened to {{both ends of the}} longitudinal girders. These girders are therefore compression struts in addition to stiffening the roadway.Because each of Pittsburgh's Three Sisters appears to be a self-contained unit not dependent on the river banks for anchorage, a debate ensued among engineers whether these structures were cantilevers rather than suspension bridges. While current wisdom holds them to be the latter, the <b>erection</b> <b>procedure</b> shows how each bridge was built in halves toward the center. Temporary diagonal struts between chain and deck provided shear resistance turning each incomplete half into a trussed cantilever arm. These struts 'freed themselves' when the halves were jacked together and connected to form a suspension bridge.|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} an {{analysis}} of the nonlinear static behaviour of cable systems is developed by assuming a full nonlinear structural model of the cables based on elastic catenary results. The work is aimed at the possible application of this kind of structure to practical engineering systems such as among others ski lifts, electrical transmission lines, and cable systems in <b>erection</b> <b>procedures</b> of long-span bridges. The structural model is then implemented in a suitable computer code program able to analyse strong nonlinearities arising from low stress levels in the cables, where the uniqueness of the solution is not assured. Therefore, an appropriate simulation technique is required to capture the static equilibrium con®gurations of the cable systems subjected to a given external action. After a preliminary discussion of the relevant equations governing the behaviour of the structural model, a ®nite element analysis is developed to account for the main inherent features related to convergence and stability of the numerical algorithm used. Then, some illustrative numerical examples are developed by suitably calibrating the input data {{in such a way that}} strong nonlinearities stand out which enable the checking of the validity of the present analysis...|$|R

This method has many advantages compared to on-site manufacturing, for example, the precision during the production process should be much higher than building each wall and floor on site. Furthermore, the quick <b>erection</b> <b>procedure</b> when using prefabricated elements and the possibility to use weather protection {{has the advantage of}} not being dependent on weather conditions, and many other factors.

The elements are flat which make it much easier to transport the elements from the factory to the building site where the building parts are easily mounted with special mounting stud.

40|$|The {{objective}} of this thesis {{was to develop a}} rational and efficient industrialized housing system. We focused on the exploration of the totally factory-built dwelling modules as the most promising strategy for raising productivity {{to keep pace with the}} increased housing demand and for lowering construction costs. Our approach was to minimize the work that would have to be done on the site and increase the factory process, thus eliminating inefficient on-site labor. We recognized transportation regulations and building codes as the major constraints on the design. The presented housing modules are transportable over the highways and meet the requirements of fire-resistive construction type B for residential construction. We limited our investigations into the design of an industrialized housing system to utilize the present technology which is at our disposal. Throughout the project development, the use of standard methods of construction was emphasized to reduce initial investment in the unit fabrication and construction. This study includes the development of prefabricated housing units from initial conception to final <b>erection</b> <b>procedure.</b> The standard dwelling modules or "boxes" are fabricated with steel as the basic structural framework and gypsum as the enclosing material, and completed on the interior and exterior. The resulting two sizes of standard dwelling modules, 13 ' 0 " x 13 ' 0 " x 9 ' 6 " and 13 ' 0 " x 26 ' 0 " x 9 ' 6 ", together with concrete elevator core and staircase units, can be combined and recombined to accommodate various sizes and types of housing for both high and low rise buildings. It was our intention to provide as many variations as possible within the system, to meet the various demands of the housing market. We were aware of the hazards of standardization which we hoped to overcome.

The West 7 th Street Bridge was designed by the Texas Department of Transportation (TxDOT) and {{is believed to be the}} first precast concrete network arch bridge in the world. The bridge consists of a series of prestressed concrete arches that were precast and post-tensioned at a staging area before they were transported to the bridge site and erected. Due to the innovative construction of this bridge, some of the most critical stresses in the life of the arches happened during construction. Therefore, an instrumentation program was conducted to make sure that the arches were not damaged during the fabrication, transport, and <b>erection</b> <b>procedures.</b> The researchers from UT embedded a series of Vibrating Wire Gages (VWGs) in the critical sections of arches and monitored the sensors throughout construction to ensure the safety of the arches.

40|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} causes of the rapid progress of cable-stayed bridges in recent decades is the development of the construction techniques that made their erection possible. Cantilever method and temporary support method are the most common procedures to build such bridges. The temporary support method is the fastest way of building cable-stayed bridges because conventional construction techniques may be used. This fact simplifies the erection task and leads to lower costs. However, when environmental factors or the requirements of the foundations or the sea or river crossing prevent the placement of temporary supports during construction, the cantilever erection method is commonly used. Focus on the research has been mainly devoted to the structural behavior of these structures under construction or service conditions, but the <b>erection</b> <b>procedures</b> and their calculations are not so studied. This paper aims to present practical tools to be used by the designer or the contractor for construction control of the tensioning process of the stays.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} principally {{concerned}} with the shape formation of different forms of space trusses with non-zero Gaussian curvature {{by means of a}} post-tensioning technique. The space truss that is shaped and erected by a post-tensioning procedure, rather than by traditional techniques involving cranes and scaffolding, is called a post-tensioned and shaped space truss. The construction procedure for a post-tensioned and shaped space truss initially involves the assembly of a planar truss with a single-layer of chords, together with out-of-plane web members, at ground level. In proportion to the desired space shape, certain bottom chords are given gaps. The bottom chords comprise shorter tubes and strands that pass through the tubes and through the bottom joints. The initially too-short chords are used to create pre-defined gaps, while the tensioning strands are used to close the gaps. By means of post-tensioning, a planar layout can be deformed and erected to its desired space shape at the same time. In this thesis, the principles of the post-tensioned and shaped space trusses, together with the essential aspects that lead to shape formation and self-erection, are investigated theoretically and are verified by experimental models. In addition to theoretical work, seven domes and one hypar have been constructed by means of a post-tensioning method under laboratory conditions. Also, a pyramidal unit of a full-size practical space truss has been tested. After the shape formation tests, three post-tensioned and shaped domes and one hypar space truss have been loaded to failure in order to observe the ultimate load carrying capacity. The post-tensioned and shaped space trusses have satisfactory ultimate load capacity. The post-tensioning process m a y increase or reduce the ultimate load capacity of posttensioned and shaped space trusses, due to the resulted prestress forces in some critical members. Compared with the simplicity in construction and <b>erection</b> <b>procedure,</b> the post-tensioned and shaped space trusses still have evident advantages in economy, even if the ultimate load capacity is reduced. Furthermore, the ultimate load capacity of a posttensioned and shaped space truss can be improved by stiffening only a few critical members according to the test results...|$|E
40|$|The present {{research}} extends the state-of-the-art {{in understanding the}} important physical phenomena that impact the constructability and behavior of horizontally curved steel I-girder bridges. The steel <b>erection</b> <b>procedure</b> of a horizontally curved and skewed steel I-girder bridge is examined {{through the use of}} a nonlinear finite element model. The behavior of the structure is studied for each stage of steel erection by observations of girder stresses, displacements and reactions. The eccentric application of gravity load resulting from horizontal curvature results in torsional forces being applied to the girder sections of a horizontally curved bridge. Due to the relative torsional flexibility of the steel I-girders, these forces can result in a marked girder rotation quantified in this work as web out-of-plumbness. The {{present research}} quantifies the effect and importance of girder web out-of-plumbness on primary member stress response in steel I-girders, both individually and as part of an assembly. Girder flange stresses and vertical and lateral displacements are presented for single straight and curved beam models and a curved two-girder system model all subject to up to 5 degrees of out-of-plumbness. Through a parametric study the effects of changes to radius or horizontal curvature, girder spacing, cross frame spacing, and web depth on the behavior of the curved two-girder system having initially out-of-plumb webs are investigated. The effects of "inconsistent detailing" - an approach to designing bridge cross frames to mitigate girder web out-of-plumbness - are presented. Specifically, the structural behavior in terms of resulting "locked-in" girder flange stresses and displacements are discussed. The research work reported herein is primarily analytical in nature, employing detailed non linear finite element models to investigate the steel erection and web-plumbness issues associated with horizontally curved steel I-girder bridges. Based on the analytical studies conducted, it is proposed that the effects of web out-of-plumbness need to be specifically considered for the effects on flange stresses in design, as an alternative to the practice of inconsistent detailing. Consideration of these effects during design and conventionally detailing girders and cross frames for the web-plumb position at no-load, in lieu of specifying inconsistent detailing to control web out-of-plumbness, will reduce construction problems that typically result from the practice of inconsistent detailing. However, if inconsistent detailing is employed to mitigate web out-of-plumbness, it must be recognized by bridge designers that this approach has complex effects on "locked-in" stresses and constructability of curved I-girder bridges. These "locked-in" stresses and constructability issues need to be considered by bridge designers and steel erectors, respectively...|$|E

In spite of it, no SFT has been constructed yet in the world, probably due to the total lack of experimental data on the actual behaviour of SFTs under both traffic and environmental actions, such as currents, waves and earthquakes.

40|$|The {{torsional}} rigidity of tub-girder makes them {{ideal for use}} in curved bridges. The use on skewed support applications by bridge designers is limited as the behavior is complex and {{requires the use of}} advanced analysis tools. In consequence, a simplified analysis method to account for the effects of skew on tub-girder twist rotations and internal torques and how these affect the internal component forces was proposed. The combined effects of skew and curvature are studied by examining the results for analysis with different levels of sophistication for 18 representative bridges. The data generated constitutes the first systematic study on a large set of curved and skewed tub-girder bridges using consistent, refined 3 D FEA models to model construction forces and deformations. Comparisons of the simplified analysis method to the refined 3 D FEA analysis display the limitations of the simplified analysis and present potential sources of error. Furthermore, the results from the 3 D FEA helped identify interactions between components and, therefore, an improved simplified procedure was proposed to account for the effects of the resulting increased stresses. In addition, the bridge <b>erection</b> <b>procedures</b> are discussed and specific examples illustrating the calculation of the fit-up forces is presented.
