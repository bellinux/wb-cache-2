Although {{the development of}} public <b>services</b> <b>supply</b> is influenced {{by a variety of}} factors, public administration paradigms can be defined as the basic factor that determines fundamental changes within the entire system. In order to analyse the development of public services, it is important to raise the following question: how does the change of public administration paradigms influence the change of public <b>services</b> <b>supply?</b> The following aim has been raised: to reveal the development of public <b>services</b> <b>supply</b> in the context of public administration paradigms. These objectives have been set: 1. To discuss the concept of a public service and the system of public <b>services</b> <b>supply.</b> 2. To review the change of elements in the public <b>services</b> <b>supply</b> system {{in the context of the}} main public administration paradigms. 3.

40|$|Purpose – The aim of {{this study}} is to better {{understand}} <b>service</b> <b>supply</b> chain management by analysing the professional <b>service</b> <b>supply</b> chain in professional service firms (PSFs) and exploring how the high performance work systems (HPWS) influence professional <b>service</b> <b>supply</b> chain performance. In addition, this study seeks to examine the relationship between professional <b>service</b> <b>supply</b> chain performance and the overall organizational performance. Design/methodology/approach – Analysis of PSF suggests a three-step of professional <b>service</b> <b>supply</b> chain as the clients' requests, partners forming working teams or so-called team formation and utilization, and delivering of solutions or services to clients. Based on extensive literature review, the authors hypothesize that HPWS have a positive impact on the professional <b>service</b> <b>supply</b> chain performance and the team formation and utilization mediates the link. They also hypothesize the positive link between the professional <b>service</b> <b>supply</b> chain performance and the overall organisational firm performance. Employing survey method, data was collected from 93 accounting firms at two time points. In May 2010 (Time 1), a survey including questions on HPWS, team formation and utilization and professional <b>service</b> <b>supply</b> chain performance were sent out to the managing partners and HR directors in accounting firms based in Ireland. Around one year later (Time 2), another survey measuring firm performance was sent out. This data allowed the authors to establish causal pattern in their results. Hierarchical regression analysis was used to analyse data to test hypotheses. Findings – The results indicate the positive link between HPWS and the professional <b>service</b> <b>supply</b> chain performance. The team formation and utilization mediates the above relationship. In addition, professional <b>service</b> <b>supply</b> chain performance was found to be positively linked to the firm performance. Research limitations/implications – The present study is limited in terms of sample size, single industry and self-report data. Future research also needs to examine more mediators or moderators – the mechanisms through which HPWS work on the professional <b>service</b> <b>supply</b> chain. Practical implications – Firms using higher level of HPWS experience better professional <b>service</b> <b>supply</b> chain performance. Human resource management practices that promote employees' ability, motivation and opportunities which allow teams to be formed more effectively to work with clients enhance organizational performance and higher profit levels. Managers able to effectively adopt and implement these teamwork-based HR practices and encourage and support employees' collaboration through such practices enhance the firm's professional <b>service</b> <b>supply</b> chain effectiveness and its organisational performance. Social implications – The authors' study focuses on the <b>service</b> <b>supply</b> chain management operations within the professional service firms. In doing so, their research answers the call by Ellram et al. for more supply chain management research with respect to the service sector. It addresses a significant research gap identified by Rahman and Wu, namely, “relatively little attention has been given to the service suppliers' perspective”. By linking <b>service</b> <b>supply</b> chain management and human resource management, this study also answers a few calls for more research on the interaction of human resource management and <b>supply</b> chain management, <b>service</b> <b>supply</b> chain and human resource management in professional service firms. Originality/value – This is one of the few studies to analyse the professional <b>service</b> <b>supply</b> chain management and assess the human resource management and supply chain management link. Moreover, it is the first study which empirically establishes the link between human resource management and professional <b>service</b> <b>supply</b> chain performance in PSFs...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: Healthcare is a universally used {{service that}} hugely affects economies {{and the quality}} of life. The {{research}} of <b>service</b> <b>supply</b> chains has found {{a significant role in the}} past decade. The main research goal of this paper is to model and simulate the internal <b>service</b> <b>supply</b> chains of a healthcare system to study the effects of different parameters on the outputs and capability measures of the processes. The specific objectives are to analyse medication delivery errors in a community hospital based on the results of the models and to explore the presence of bullwhip effect in the internal <b>service</b> <b>supply</b> chains of the hospital. Design/methodology/approach: System dynamics which is an approach for understanding the behaviour of complex systems, used as a methodology to model two internal <b>service</b> <b>supply</b> chains of the hospital with a sub-model created to simulate medication delivery errors in the hospital. The models are validated using the actual data of the hospital and the results are analyzed based on experimental design techniques. Findings: It is observed that the bullwhip effect may not occur in a hospital’s internal <b>service</b> <b>supply</b> chains. Furthermore the paper points out the conditions for reducing the medication delivery error in a hospital. Research limitations/implications: Because of the community hospital’s data availability the type of <b>service</b> <b>supply</b> chains modelled in this paper, are small <b>service</b> <b>supply</b> chains, representing only the tasks which are done inside the hospital. To better observe the bullwhip effect in healthcare <b>service</b> <b>supply</b> chains, the chains should be modelled more generally.

40|$|Purpose - The {{performance}} of <b>service</b> <b>supply</b> chains {{in terms of}} service levels and cost efficiency depends {{not only on the}} effort of service providers but also on the inputs of sub-contractors and the customer. In this sense, performance-based contracting (PBC) entails increased financial risk for providers. Allocating and managing risk through contractual relationships along the <b>service</b> <b>supply</b> chain is a critical issue, and yet there is scant empirical evidence regarding what factors influence, and how, provider willingness to bear PBC-induced risk. This paper aims to address this gap. Design/methodology/approach - The paper draws on agency theory and two cases of logistics <b>service</b> <b>supply</b> chains, in the food retail and automotive industries respectively, to identify key influencing factors. Data were collected through semi-structured interviews with 30 managers of providers and sub-contractors and review of 35 documents, notably contracts and target letters. Findings - Four influencing factors were found: performance attributability within the <b>service</b> <b>supply</b> chain; relational governance in <b>service</b> <b>supply</b> chain relationships; provider risk and reward balancing; and provider ability to transfer risk to sub-contractors. The propositions developed address how these factors influence provider willingness to bear PBC-induced risk. Research limitations/implications The factors identified are external to the provider mindset and refer to the management of contractual relationships and service delivery interactions along the <b>service</b> <b>supply</b> chain. The paper contributes to agency theory by stressing the risk allocation implications of bi-directional principal-agent relations in <b>service</b> <b>supply</b> chains.

40|$|Purpose An {{implicit}} {{assumption of}} current supply chain integration (SCI) research {{is that the}} results obtained from product supply chains can be directly extrapolated to <b>service</b> <b>supply</b> chains. This paper questions this assumption of equivalence by proposing {{that the effects of}} internal integration (II) and external integration (EI) on operational performance (OP) are contingent on whether a firm operates in a product and <b>service</b> <b>supply</b> chain. Design/methodology/approach Drawing on the contingency theory, a model that specifies and contrasts the interrelationships between II, EI, and OP in product and <b>service</b> <b>supply</b> chains was proposed. Subsequently, measures were developed and survey data were collected from 138 product and 174 service companies in Singapore. The data were then analysed using multi-sampling analysis. Findings The effects of II and EI on OP varied significantly between product and <b>service</b> <b>supply</b> chains. In addition, the relationship between II and OP was found to be partially-mediated by EI in product supply chains whereas a fully-mediated relationship was observed in <b>service</b> <b>supply</b> chains. Research limitations/implications Within the context of SCI, different mediation patterns exist in product and <b>service</b> <b>supply</b> chains. The results suggest adopting a contingency rather than a universalistic approach in the management of firms&# 039; internal and external integrative capabilities to maximise OP. Specifically, managers should adjust their II and EI efforts to achieve congruency with the type of supply chain they serve.

Findings and Originality/value: The study finds out that when ISV get to “positive feedback”, instead of the traditional market equilibrium, compensation contract (linear) can coordinate satisfactorily the SaaS <b>service</b> <b>supply</b> chain. In the point of “positive feedback”, the marginal revenue equals the marginal cost, but it is not the equilibrium of ISV’profit-maximization. Research limitations/implications: There are some limitations in this research. In the linear compensation contracts, the compensation price is fixed value. If in the contract, we can create a change value which is related to the sales volume of service, the coordination efficiency of compensation will be increased. And in the future, the nonlinear compensation contracts should be researched. Practical implications: In the practical implication, it will promote the development of study and practice of SaaS and IT service industry.

Many conventional multi- criteria decision making (MCDM) methods have drawbacks such as inability to capture realistic fuzziness in decision making (human judgment), inadaptability to different levels of measurement, complexity in calculation and requirement of intricate details, which render them unsuitable for the task of environmental performance evaluation of <b>service</b> <b>supply</b> chains. In this paper, a grey based hybrid framework for evaluating the environmental performance of <b>service</b> <b>supply</b> chains is proposed by integrating grey based method with ELECTRE and VIKOR approaches. Two case studies were carried out to understand the effectiveness of criteria and method to evaluate environmental performance of <b>service</b> <b>supply</b> chains in a developing country context...|$|R
