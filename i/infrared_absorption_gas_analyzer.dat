The method we propose is incorporating plasmonic nanostructures with nano-composite material, metalorganic framework, which can selectively preconcentrate certain gas molecules into the nanopores. The preconcentrating property is first demonstrated by applying metal-organic framework to optical fiber based sensor. Then two different metalorganic framework integrated surface enhanced <b>infrared</b> <b>absorption</b> <b>gas</b> sensors fabricated on bulk substrate and nano-membrane are investigated, {{and the high}} enhancement factors demonstrated for the first time. Lastly, an on-chip spectrometer using high resolution plasmonic filter array is proposed and experimentally demonstrated for resolving CO 2 absorption spectrum at 2. 0 μm with 10 12 nm resolution. This filter array spectrometer is simple and low-cost, which can be potentially used for portable gas spectroscopy system...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: The {{scientific}} aim of {{the present}} campaign is to study the whole chain of methane photo-degradation, as initiated by Solar vacuum-ultraviolet irradiation in Titan’s atmosphere. For this purpose, the AMINO experiment on the EXPOSE-R mission has loaded closed cells for gas-phase photochemistry in space conditions. Two different gas mixtures have been exposed, named Titan 1 and Titan 2, involving both N 2 –CH 4 gas mixtures, without and with CO 2, respectively. CO 2 is added {{as a source of}} reactive oxygen in the cells. The cell contents were analysed thanks to <b>infrared</b> <b>absorption</b> spectroscopy, <b>gas</b> chromatography and mass spectrometry. Methane consumption leads to the formation of saturated hydrocarbons, with no detectable influence of CO 2. This successful campaign provides a first benchmark for characterizing the whole methane photochemical system in space conditions. A thin film of tholin-like compounds appears to form on the cell walls of the exposed cells...|$|R

It contains a tunable optical filter of porous silicon that allows {{to measure the}} <b>infrared</b> <b>absorption</b> of a <b>gas</b> mixture at different wavelengths serially with only one single thermopile detector. This method eliminates drift of the sensor without any reference beam. The filter that measures typically 1. 0 x 1. 8 mm(2) is tilted by a microactuator to tune it. This wavelength modulation can replace a modulation of the source. Selective sensing of CO 2 and CO by their absorption bands at 4. 23 mum and 4. 65 mum has been shown...|$|R
40|$|A highly {{sensitive}} method capable of detecting quantities of the boron hydrides, B_ 4 H_(10) and B_ 5 H_(11), {{as small as}} 0. 02 µmole was required {{for the analysis of}} the products of a very low conversion kinetic study of the photolysis of diborane. Various analytical methods have been described in the literature for boron hydrides: <b>infrared</b> <b>absorption,</b> neutron <b>absorption,</b> <b>gas</b> chromatography, low temperature fractionation, and mass spectroscopy. Neutron absorption was used to determine total B^(10) content of individual boron hydrides for use in isotopic exchange studies. Gas chromatography was used successfully for B_ 4 H_(10) and B_ 5 H_ 9, though not for B_ 5 H_(11) because of the latter's instability. Minimum detectable amounts for mixtures were given only for the <b>infrared</b> <b>absorption</b> method, where they were about 0. 5 µmole of B_ 4 H_(10) and B_ 5 H_(11), so that the method was too insensitive for much of our investigation. A method was needed where a minimum detectable amount in the presence of large amounts of B_ 2 H_ 6 was as low as 5 x 10 ^(- 4) mole per cent. It is necessary in certain studies with boron hydrides to proceed to very low per cent conversions to avoid complications due to the reactions of the products...|$|R

40|$|Several {{designs of}} <b>infrared</b> <b>absorption</b> based <b>gas</b> {{detector}} use a Fabry-Perot Interferometer (FPI) to modulate the incident light. In these systems, generally the FPI's fringes are matched with very well defined rotational absorption {{lines of a}} target molecule such as CO 2, CO, N 2 O, CH 4, etc. In order to obtain modulation the cavity length of the FPI is scanned over {{one half of the}} reference wavelength. In this work, we present a simple analytical method based on the Fourier Transform that describes the performance of these systems. Using this method the optimal reflectivity and optical spacing of the FPI can be determined. Furthermore, the modulated signal generated by the system {{as a function of the}} cavity length scan can be calculated by applying the inverse Fourier Transform. Finally, this method describes the underlying reasons why for some filters the background amplitude is severe, and gives guidance on the choice of optimised filters. Our method evaluates the optimal FPI parameters and the modulated signal much faster than the direct numerical computation which is used currently. Simulation results for different molecules in combination with diverse filters shapes are presented, with a comparison to directly computed results...|$|R

40|$|We present {{new models}} which provide {{satisfactory}} and low cost modeling of <b>infrared</b> <b>absorption</b> spectra of <b>gases</b> from low to high pressures. The {{first is a}} line-by-line approach based on simple and empirical corrections of the lorentzian shape which account {{for the effects of}} line-mixing and finite duration of collisions. It leads to satisfactory agreement with experimental infrared spectra in a wide density range. It is degraded for the deduction of a Generalized Narrow-Band Statistical Model (GNBSM) which enables very rapid computation of medium resolution radiative properties. The latter is an extension of the low density (i. e., when lines are much narrower than the considered spectral resolution) approach developed by Goody [1]; it is based on a random representation of line-positions and statistical description of line integrated-intensities and leads to a very simple expression of spectrally averaged <b>absorption</b> properties of <b>gases.</b> It is consistent with previous low density models and requires computer times several orders of magnitude shorter than line-by-line calculations. Comparisons between degraded approaches, line-by-line models, and experimental results demonstrate the accuracy of the present models in cases where previously proposed approaches are very inaccurate...|$|R
40|$|Abstract [...] Allophane {{samples from}} soils, pumice, and stream beds {{have been studied}} by {{electron}} optical, <b>infrared</b> <b>absorption,</b> X-ray fluorescence, <b>gas</b> chromatography, and phosphate adsorption methods. The allophane particles were hollow spherules or polyhedra 35 and 50 / ~ in diameter with molar A 1 /Si ratios close to 2. 0. The thickness of {{the wall of the}} spherules was estimated to be 7]~. For the pumice allophanes, the wall was largely composed of imogolite structural units (OH). 3 A 1203 SiOH. Defects or pores were present in the wall and probably were the sites where phosphate was adsorbed. It is suggested that hese allophanes with molar A 1 /Si ratios close to 2. 0 should be called "proto-imogolite " allophane. Two soil allophanes had a similar structure to the allophane from Stratford pumice, but small amounts of layer silicates, including halloysite, were also present in the soil samples, as indicated by infrared bands at 470, 1030, and 1100 cm- 1. The allophane from the stream bed at Silica Springs had an infrared spectrum similar to feldspathoids, and it did not have the imogolite structure...|$|R

The facility is designed to perform detailed studies of small-scale air-sea interaction. It is optimized for imaging short wind waves, accurate measurements of gas transfer velocities and to deploy infrared imaging techniques. The annular water channel has an outer diameter of 10 m and a width of 0. 65 m. It is 2. 4 m high and can be filled with water up to a height of 1. 2 m, which corresponds to a water volume of approximately 21 m 3. Wind is generated by a rotating paddle wheel up to 15 m/s. The air space is gas tight and the walls are insulated. Experiments can be performed with deionized water, artificial sea water, surfactants, and reactive gases. An air conditioning system controls independently humidity and air temperature. In conjunction with an air flushing system net heat fluxes at the water surface can be adjusted from - 500 to 1000 W/m 2. A water current with a speed up to 0. 5 m/s against the wind direction can be generated separately {{by a set of}} thrusters. Air temperature, water temperature, relative humidity, water current and wind speed are continuously monitored. Standard measurements techniques include a color imaging slope gauge (mean square wave slope and wave spectra), an infrared imaging system (heat transfer velocity), and <b>infrared</b> <b>absorption</b> spectroscopy (<b>gas</b> transfer velocities of He, H 2, N 20, and F 12).

Recently, commercially available instruments based on spectroscopic {{techniques such as}} cavity ring-down spectroscopy (CRDS), off-axis integrated cavity output spectroscopy (OA-ICOS) and Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy have become more widely available and affordable.

We demonstrate that CRDS instruments and likely other spectroscopic techniques are suitable for WMO/GAW stations and allow a smooth continuation of historic CO 2 and CH 4 time series. Moreover, the analysis of the audit results indicates that the spectroscopic techniques have a number of advantages over the traditional methods which will lead to the improved accuracy of atmospheric CO 2 and CH 4 measurements...|$|R
