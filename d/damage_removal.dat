40|$|Abstract- The {{effect of}} process {{parameters}} such as saw <b>damage</b> <b>removal,</b> gas dilution and silane depletion are studied {{to maximize the}} efficiency of silicon a-Si/c-Si heterojuction solar cells. Furthermore, the effect of chemical treatment and annealing are also studied to understand their effect on performance of silicon heterojunction solar cells. A smooth and defect free junction is required to exploit the heterojunction properties of the junction and produce high open circuit voltage. Hence a smooth c-Si surface and the incorporation and migration of hydrogen in the amorphous silicon layers, especially the intrinsic amorphous layer, are very important. The process parameters affecting these properties have been studied and direct relation between the process parameters and the cell performance has been found.

40|$|Different wet {{chemical}} treatments of crystalline Si wafers for {{the preparation of}} heterojunction solar cells are optimized with respect to low reflection losses, low recombination losses and long carrier lifetimes. It is demonstrated that a joint optimization of both saw damage etch and texture etch is necessary to control the pyramid morphology. Best results are reached for intermediate saw <b>damage</b> <b>removals</b> and texture etch times. Wet chemical preconditioning by oxidation in hot water and by using ozone at ambient temperatures is found to yield high quality surfaces with low defect densities.

40|$|Nanostructured {{crystalline}} silicon {{is promising}} for thin-silicon photovoltaic devices because of reduced material usage and wafer quality constraint. This paper presents the optical and photovoltaic characteristics of silicon nanohole (SiNH) arrays fabricated using polystyrene nanosphere lithography and reactive-ion etching (RIE) techniques for large-area processes. A post-RIE <b>damage</b> <b>removal</b> etching is subsequently introduced {{to mitigate the}} surface recombination issues and also suppress the surface reflection due to modifications in the nanohole sidewall profile, resulting in a 19 % increase in the power conversion efficiency. We show that the <b>damage</b> <b>removal</b> etching treatment can effectively recover the carrier lifetime and dark current–voltage characteristics of SiNH solar cells to resemble the planar counterpart without RIE damages. Furthermore, the reflectance spectra exhibit broadband and omnidirectional anti-reflective properties, where an AM 1. 5 G spectrum-weighted reflectance achieves 4. 7 % for SiNH arrays. Finally, a three-dimensional optical modeling has also been established to investigate the dimension and wafer thickness dependence of light absorption. We conclude that the SiNH arrays reveal great potential for efficient light harvesting in thin-silicon photovoltaics with a 95 % material reduction compared to a typical cell thickness of 200 mm.

40|$|Purpose: This paper {{presents}} {{technology of}} multicrystalline silicon solar cells with laser texturization step. The texturing of polycrystalline silicon surface using Nd:YAG laser {{makes it possible}} to increase absorption of the incident solar radiation. Moreover, the additional technological operation consisting in etching in 20 % KOH solution at temperature of 80 ºC introduced into technology of the photovoltaic cells manufactured from laser textured wafers allows for significant improvement in their electrical performance compared to cells produced from the non-textured wafers after saw <b>damage</b> <b>removal.</b> Design/methodology/approach: The topography of laser textured surfaces were investigated using DSM 940 OPTON scanning electron microscope and LSM 5 Pascal ZEISS confocal laser scanning microscope. The reflectance of produced textures was measured by Perkin-Elmer Lambda spectrophotometer with an integrating sphere. Electrical parameters of manufactured solar cells were characterized by measurements of I-V light characteristics under standard AM 1. 5 radiation. Findings: Solar cells manufactured from laser-textured polycrystalline silicon wafers demonstrate worse electrical performance than cells manufactured from the non-textured wafers after saw <b>damage</b> <b>removal</b> as well as wafers textured by etching in alkaline solutions. Etching of textured surface in 20 % KOH solution at temperature of 80 ºC subsequent to laser processing shows to have a greatly increased impact on electrical performance of solar cells. Research limitations/implications: Continued etching to remove laser induced defects cause the texture to flatten out reducing it optical effectiveness. Originality/value: This paper demonstrates, that laser processing is very promising technique for texturing multicrystaline silicon independent on grains crystallographic orientation compared to conventional texturing methods in technology of solar cells...|$|E

40|$|Nucleotide {{excision}} repair {{is a highly}} conserved DNA repair mechanism present in all kingdoms of life. The incision reaction is a critical step for <b>damage</b> <b>removal</b> and is accomplished by the UvrC protein in eubacteria. No structural information is so far available for the 3 ′ incision reaction. Here we report the crystal structure of the N-terminal catalytic domain of UvrC at 1. 5 Å resolution, which catalyzes the 3 ′ incision reaction and shares homology with the catalytic domain of the GIY-YIG family of intron-encoded homing endonucleases. The structure reveals a patch of highly conserved residues surrounding a catalytic magnesium-water cluster, suggesting that the metal binding site is an essential feature of UvrC and all GIY-YIG endonuclease domains. Structural and biochemical data strongly suggest that the N-terminal endonuclease domain of UvrC utilizes a novel one-metal mechanism to cleave the phosphodiester bond...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe surface {{passivation}} {{ability of a}} hydrogenated amorphous silicon (a-Si:H) layer is investigated on industrial-type cleaned p-type (2 Ωcm) FZ and Cz silicon wafers. The cleaning sequence consists of laser/saw <b>damage</b> <b>removal</b> and immersions in aqueous HCl and HF solutions.

40|$|Several {{specific}} processing {{steps as}} part of a total process sequence for manufacturing silicon solar cells were studied. Ion implantation was identified as the preferred process step for impurity doping. Unanalyzed beam ion implantation was shown to have major cost advantages over analyzed beam implantation. Further, high quality cells were fabricated using a high current unanalyzed beam. Mechanically masked plasma patterning of silicon nitride was shown to be capable of forming fine lines on silicon surfaces with spacings between mask and substrate as great as 250 micrometers. Extensive work was performed on advances in plated metallization. The need for the thick electroless palladium layer was eliminated. Further, copper was successfully utilized as a conductor layer utilizing nickel as a barrier to copper diffusion into the silicon.

Based on the solubility test result, no AlF 3 precipitate was detected at both temperatures. Aneto (2012) also conducted core flooding tests and compared the use of retarded mud acid using AlCl 3.

Results of the experiments showed that pure carbon dioxide was effective in restoring flow capacity to the core specimens in several different settings.

40|$|In this paper, {{we examine}} Si and Te ion implant <b>damage</b> <b>removal</b> in GaN as a {{function}} of implantation dose, and implantation and annealing temperature. Transmission electron microscopy shows that amorphous layers, which can result from high-dose implantation, recrystallize between 800 and 1100 °C to very defective polycrystalline material. Lower-dose implants (down to 5 × 1013 cm – 2), which are not amorphous but defective after implantation, also anneal poorly up to 1100 °C, leaving a coarse network of extended defects. Despite such disorder, a high fraction of Te is found to be substitutional in GaN both following implantation and after annealing. Furthermore, although elevated-temperature implants result in less disorder after implantation, this damage is also impossible to anneal out completely by 1100 °C. The implications of this study are that considerably higher annealing temperatures will be needed to remove damage for optimum electrical properties. © 1998 American Institute of Physics...|$|E
