For AOD applications, the Dolomite bricks should have positive Permanent Linear Change (PLC) on re-heating. A positive PLC dolomite brick has higher life and most suitable for joint less refractory lining with no cobble stoning defect. So the development of dolomite bricks having positive PLC during applications is a challenge for refractory manufacturing industry. In the present investigation, <b>dolomite</b> <b>refractory</b> bricks were prepared by varying different additive with an intention to get the positive PLC of the brick. It is well known that Iron Oxide is a good additive for dolomite brick sintering. It has also been reported that monoclinic zirconia (m-ZrO 2) additive improves the BD, CCS and PLC of dolomite brick. In this background, first trial composition was containing a fixed amount of 1 % m-ZrO 2 and different concentration and types of iron oxide. Mill scale containing Fe 2 O 3 was added in two different concentrations 0. 5 %, 1 % and in another trial 0. 25 % of nano Fe 2 O 3 was added. Fe 2 O 3 containing bricks showed a good improvement in BD and CCS due to the better sintering of dolomite grains in presence of liquid formation during sintering by the presence of Fe 2 O 3. The CCS value was in the range 750 - 800 kg/cm 2. However, the PLCvalue was negative in the range of - 0. 2 to - 0. 35 %. Depending on this result, new additive, Chrome Green oxide was then used. It has been found that the PLC tends to be positive with increase in Cr 2 O 3 content. However, in presence of Cr 2 O 3 the m ZrO 2 it was not performing well. Finally m-ZrO 2 was removed and a higher percentage of Cr 2 O 3 additive showed the positive PLC (+ 0. 12 %) of the dolomite brick. The brick showed a CCS value of 650 kg/cm 2. This is in the acceptable limit...|$|E

In 2008, Rhône then sold LWB Refractories for $938 million. to Brazilian manufacturer Magnesita Refratarios S.A. The deal created what {{is now one of}} the world largest refractory manufacturers. Clifford Chance advised Rhône in connection with the combination of RHI AG and Magnesita to create a leading refractory company named RHI Magnesita, established in the Netherlands and listed on the London Stock Exchange, Rhone would remain the controlling shareholder.|$|R
