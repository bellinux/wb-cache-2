500|$|New York Times public editor (ombudsman) Elizabeth Spayd {{wrote in}} 2016 that [...] "Conservatives and even many moderates, see in The Times a blue-state worldview" [...] and accuse it of {{harboring}} a liberal bias. Spayd did not analyze {{the substance of}} the claim, but did opine that the Times is [...] "part of a fracturing media environment that reflects a fractured country. That in turn leads liberals and conservatives toward separate news sources." [...] Times executive editor Dean Baquet stated that he does not believe coverage has a liberal bias, but that: [...] "We have to be really careful that people feel like they can see themselves in The New York Times. <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>us</b> to be perceived as fair and honest to the world, not just a segment of it. It's a really difficult goal. Do we pull it off all the time? No." ...|$|E
500|$|With {{no single}} party having {{achieved}} an overall majority, the 2010 general election {{resulted in the}} first hung parliament since 1974. When {{it became clear that}} no party would achieve the outright majority needed to form the next government, the three main party leaders made public statements offering to discuss the options for putting together an administration with the other parties. Liberal Democrat leader Nick Clegg called on Prime Minister Gordon Brown and Conservative leader David Cameron to act [...] "in the national interest and not out of narrow party political advantage". However, having stated before the election that the party with the most seats should have the initial say on forming a government, Clegg announced his intention to begin talks with the Conservative Party. Speaking outside the Liberal Democrat headquarters he said: [...] "It is now for the Conservative Party to prove that it is capable of seeking to govern in the national interest." [...] Brown said he intended to play his part in securing [...] "a stable, strong and principled government", and indicated his willingness to speak with both Clegg and Cameron on how to achieve this, saying: [...] "What we have seen are no ordinary election results." [...] But shortly after, Cameron held a press conference at which he invited the Liberal Democrats to talks, saying: [...] "I want to make a big, open and comprehensive offer to the Liberal Democrats. <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>us</b> to work together in tackling our country's big and urgent problems - the debt crisis, our deep social problems and our broken political system." ...|$|E
5000|$|The {{first single}} off {{the album was}} [...] "Little Razorblade"; its music video was {{directed}} by Joseph Kahn. Ferrari expressed his original intentions: [...] "I wanted to be shooting dice. <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>us</b> in the jacuzzi with hot girls… like Rick James videos. Something just decadent and ridiculous. <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>us</b> going {{down the street in}} a limousine with a hot tub in the back, having a ball with girls who'd never talk to us unless we had money. 'Cause it's funny." [...] The plot of the finished video did not match the drummer's intentions and he expressed disappointment: [...] "It was just too much. No dude is gonna admit they like this band after seeing that." ...|$|R

2500|$|The Secretary of State for the UK's Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, Owen Paterson, {{described}} his ambition {{for the natural}} environment and how {{the work of the}} Committee fits into this at an NCC event in November 2012: [...] "I do not, however, just want to maintain our natural assets; I want to improve them. <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>us</b> to derive the greatest possible benefit from them, while ensuring that they are available for generations to come. This is what the NCC's innovative work is geared towards".|$|E
2500|$|British {{political}} writer George Monbiot decried Sierra's treatment, citing it as {{an example}} of state persecution and the erosion of civil liberties in the United States, while journalist Amy Goodman characterized it as evidence of [...] "a new McCarthyism". Charles C Haynes, senior scholar at the First Amendment Center, also situated the controversy {{in the context of the}} freedom of expression debate, criticising the school for allowing a [...] "heckler's veto" [...] to censor Sierra and the school district for spending [...] "more than US$75,000 fighting to keep her quiet". A New York University drama project investigating post-9/11 America composed a theater piece, United We Stand, inspired by Sierra's actions. The Thomas Jefferson Center, an organization dedicated to the protection of freedom of expression, highlighted the controversy in 2002 and awarded the Kanawha school board and principal Forest Mann with their annual [...] "Jefferson Muzzle" [...] award. Highlighting a quote by Katie Sierra ("There are many types of anarchy. <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>us</b> to unite as one instead of having some government over top of us.") the center wrote, [...] "While school officials have the authority to prevent disruption of school activities, such authority should not be used as a pretext to stifle expression with which they disagree. Moreover, a high school student who shows an active interest in the important issues of the day and who takes the initiative to form a club to pursue that interest should be commended." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "I can {{understand}} that after all your life looking at the captain as your father, and after {{he and his wife}} being everything to you, you would find it mighty hard to regard me in that way. I don't expect it, and I don't want it. If he is not your father by blood, he is your father in right of bringing you up and caring for you and educating you, and it is quite right and quite proper that you should always regard him so. You can look upon me, lad, just as a foster-father--as the husband of the woman who was for a time your nurse, and who would gladly repair the wrongs he did to you. I just say this, lad, to make things straight between us. <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>us</b> to be friends. I am an old soldier, and you a young one. We are comrades in this expedition. We have taken to each other, and would do each other a good turn if we had a chance. I don't want more than that, lad, and I don't expect you to give more. If I can lend you a helping hand on or off duty, you know I shall do so. So let us shake hands on it, and agree to let the matter drop altogether until this campaign is over. Then we will talk over together what had best be done. A few months longer of this life will do you no harm, and you will make all the better officer for having had two or three years in the ranks. But I will say at once that I think that you are wrong, now you know how the matter stands, in not writing at once to the captain and letting him know the truth. Still there is no harm in its standing over for the present. You must go through the expedition as you are now, and they would be no easier for knowing that you are exposed to danger out here than they are at present when they know nothing of your whereabouts." ...|$|E
