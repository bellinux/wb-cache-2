5|$|In 2003, Slavoj Hašek was awoken by commotion {{from outside}} of his house. Hašek left his house with a shotgun and pursued a thief. After the thief <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> own car and drove it in Hašek's direction, he shot and killed him. Hašek was sentenced to five years {{imprisonment}} with the High Court in Olomouc arguing that the defense could not be legitimate, since the shot went through a side window rather than through the front windshield. Hašek was pardoned by President Klaus shortly thereafter.|$|E
5|$|After a {{disqualification}} in the 500m race, he {{was leading}} the skaters in the 1000m race. During a turn around the final corner, Ohno, Ahn Hyun Soo, Li Jiajun and Mathieu Turcotte all fell {{in a series of}} collisions. The last man standing was Steven Bradbury from Australia, who was trailing behind at the time, and skated through to win the gold medal, becoming the first person from the southern hemisphere to win a gold medal at a Winter Olympics. Ohno quickly <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> feet and crossed the finish line to win silver with Turcotte winning the bronze. Ohno, coincidentally was wearing skates, made by Bradbury's own boot company, Revolutionary Boot Company. Bradbury had given them to Ohno, expecting for Ohno to win wearing them.|$|E
25|$|Fighting at It's Showtime in Amsterdam, Leko beat Badr Hari by {{spinning}} back kick in {{a grudge}} fight. Hari had trash talked Leko {{prior to the}} bout, and there was bad blood going in. Leko finished him in round 1, via spinning back kick to the liver. The fight had lasted little more than 100 seconds, with Badr throwing Leko across the ring from a clinch. Leko <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> feet calmly, and after a teep, landed his trademark spin-kick and it finished the fight. Hari stayed down for several minutes after the fight was waved off, in considerable pain.|$|E

25|$|Karel Kaers, the {{youngest}} man {{to win the}} world road championship, also won the Ronde in 1939– without intending to. For him, it was training for Paris–Roubaix. He drove to the Kwaremont hill near Kluisbergen, parked his car, then rode 40km to the start in Ghent. His plan was to ride round the course with his usual training partner, stop when he <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> car, then drive home. Knowing he wasn't riding the whole distance, Kaers jumped clear of the field– again as training– and rode up the Kwaremont with a minute's lead. But his car wasn't there. He pressed on instead and won the race. His manager had driven the car away to save Kaers from temptation.|$|E
25|$|Weatherly was {{considering}} retirement going into 1964, and he drove {{only a couple}} of races for Moore, until tragedy struck. While racing Moore's No. 8 Mercury at Riverside International Raceway, Weatherly began setting up for Turn 6 when he lost control and struck the concrete barrier, then slid across the racetrack where his car came to a stop. Weatherly was dead when workers <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> car. He died when his car hit the barrier, as his head slid out the window and hit the wall, suffering major head injuries. Moore retired No. 8 and switched to No. 1, and hired Billy Wade, the 1963 NASCAR Rookie of the Year, to drive. Wade had a strong year, winning four consecutive races and finishing fourth in points. Bobby Johns, Johnny Rutherford, and Darel Dieringer also saw time in the car, with Dieringer winning at Augusta Speedway.|$|E
25|$|While {{this was}} happening, Hart took {{advantage}} of a momentary lapse in concentration by Austin, who had just finished attacking Diesel, and threw him over the top rope {{on the far side}} of the ring. As Austin <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> feet, he quickly realized that none of the officials had seen his feet touch the floor as they were too busy with breaking the brawl up on the opposite side of the ring. Austin then got back into the ring and continued in the match as if he had not been eliminated, and almost as soon as he did so he pushed both Undertaker and Vader, who were locked in a battle of their own to try to stay in the match, over the top. By this time, Mankind and Funk had been separated and the officials could focus again on the match, just in time to see Hart eliminate Diesel. Just after he did, though, Austin returned the favor from before and dumped Hart out of the ring. As a result, since as far as the officials were concerned Austin was still a legal participant in the match, he was declared the winner of the Royal Rumble.|$|E

25|$|India, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka jointly {{hosted the}} 10th edition of Cricket World Cup. Kumar Sangakkara led the Sri Lankan side. In group A, Sri Lanka played with Pakistan, Australia, New Zealand, Zimbabwe, Canada and Kenya. They started off their tournament against minnows Canada. They won the toss and elected to bat first. Canada bowled {{well in the}} early overs, but {{did not get a}} wicket, as openers Tharanga and Dilshan reached 50 runs. When the first wicket did fall, it was a run-out when the batsmen had a mix-up with the score at 63, and Tharanga was dismissed. Dilshan <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> half-century, but fell trying to go for a big hit. The Canadians {{restricted}} Sri Lanka to 88/2 with over 19 overs bowled; but the two experienced Sri Lankan batsmen, captain Sangakkara and Jayawardene came together and got a partnership of 50. Both batsmen got the run rate to over 6 and both seemed to be coasting to their centuries, until Sangakkara on 92 gave a simple return catch to John Davison with the score at 267/2. Jayawardene reached his century but fell immediately afterwards. More wickets fell and the game got hot-tempered, with a confrontation between Angelo Mathews and Harvir Baidwan and Sri Lanka finished with 332/7.|$|E

As he <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> home, a crowd of reports awaited Blancornelas, who allowed them to take pictures of him but refused to answer any questions.

500|$|Sitting on {{the bench}} as the game entered the final minute of play, Henderson [...] "had a feeling" [...] that he could score. [...] He {{convinced}} coach Sinden to send him out when Peter Mahovlich left the ice. Rushing into the Soviet zone, Henderson missed a pass from Yvan Cournoyer {{in front of the}} net and was tripped by a Soviet defenceman. [...] As he <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> feet, Phil Esposito recovered the puck and sent it towards Henderson in front of the net. The first shot was stopped by Vladislav Tretiak, but Henderson recovered the rebound and slid it past the fallen goaltender to give Canada a 6–5 lead with only 34 seconds left to play. [...] It was his seventh goal of the tournament, tying him for the series lead with Esposito and Alexander Yakushev. The goal won the game, and the series, for Canada. [...] The team returned home to massive crowds in Montreal and Toronto, and Paul Henderson had become a national hero.|$|E

500|$|Whitlam {{arrived just}} before 1:00p.m. {{and was taken}} to Kerr's office by an aide. He brought with him the formal letter advising a half-Senate election, and after {{the two men were}} seated, {{attempted}} to give it to Kerr. In their accounts of their meeting, both men agree that Kerr then told Whitlam that his commission as Prime Minister was withdrawn under Section64 of the Constitution, and handed him a letter and statement of reasons. Kerr later wrote that at this point Whitlam <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> feet, looked at the office's phones, and stated, [...] "I must {{get in touch with the}} Palace at once." [...] Whitlam, however disputed this, and stated that he asked Kerr whether he had consulted the Palace, to which Kerr replied that he did not need to, and that he had the advice of Barwick. Both accounts agree that Kerr then stated that they would both have to live with this, to which Whitlam replied, [...] "You certainly will." [...] The dismissal concluded with Kerr wishing Whitlam luck in the election, and offering his hand, which the former Prime Minister took.|$|E
500|$|When the {{character}} was announced, he {{was described as}} a hustler who sees everything as an opportunity, and has created several personas since the age of seven to hide his real self. Norwood expanded on this, saying [...] "when he was in school and the register was being read out and it <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> name it would be 'Chubb!' and all the kids in school would start taking the mickey out of it. What he did was create something even more ridiculous to take away from that. He [...] out of himself and took the power away from those that were taking the mickey out of him. [...] For the same reason most kids put on a front, it's to protect himself from the world. He doesn't like his real name so he tried to create something that would get away from that and Fatboy was that creation. The street and the slang stuff is not something that is far away from him, it is still from the area that he lives in. Fatboy was someone he adopted to put a brave face on, to put a mask on himself, to protect Arthur from the world." [...] Before adopting the [...] "Fatboy" [...] persona, he would adopt personas of men he saw on television, and Norwood said Fatboy was [...] "an awkward kind of child". Fatboy comes from a wealthy background, and gets what he wants from his parents, with whom he has a good relationship, but hustles to hide the fact. He often wears clothing brand Ed Hardy, and his speech has, according to Norwood, a [...] "unique rhythm". Norwood is able to make viable changes to the script to make it sound more authentic.|$|E
2500|$|Jeff Gordon {{took the}} lead from Joey Logano on the final restart and sailed to victory lane for the 91st time in his career. Gordon had this to say, [...] "I got a really good restart, and I <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> quarter panel in Turn 1 and I was able to drag him back and it allowed me to get the {{momentum}} and get by him." [...] "I had (Gordon) cleared," [...] Logano said. [...] "I should have pulled {{down in front of}} him. He got next to me, and I couldn't get away." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{ending of}} the fight {{remains one of the}} most {{controversial}} in boxing history. Midway through the first round, Liston threw a left jab and Ali went over it with a fast right, knocking the former champion down. Liston went down on his back. He rolled over, <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> right knee and then fell on his back again. Many in attendance did not see Ali deliver the punch. The fight quickly descended into chaos. Referee Jersey Joe Walcott, a former World Heavyweight Champion himself, had a hard time getting Ali to go to a neutral corner. Ali initially stood over his fallen opponent, gesturing and yelling at him, [...] "Get up and fight, sucker!" [...] "Nobody will believe this!" ...|$|E
2500|$|This {{account of}} his death was given by Sir Robert Pye his son-in-law..."That in the action of Chalgrove Field, his pistol burst and {{shattered}} his hand in a terrible manner. He, however, rode off and <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> quarters but finding the wound mortal he sent for Sir Robert Pye then a colonel in the Parliamentary army - and who had married his eldest daughter - {{and told him that}} he looked on him in some degree accessory to his death as the pistols were present from him. Sir Robert assured him that he bought them in Paris from an eminent maker and proved them himself. It appeared on examining the other pistol that it was loaded to the muzzle with several supernumerary charges, owning to the carelessness of a servant. He was ordered to see that the pistols were loaded every morning which he did but without drawing the former charge." [...] An exhumation of Hampden's body in 1828 showed that there was no damage to the shoulder but his 'right hand was shattered by the bursting of his pistol, and death probably ensued from lockjaw arising out of extensive injury to the nervous system' ...|$|E
2500|$|Once {{the match}} began, Hart and Michaels brought their {{performance}} outside {{the ring and}} into the crowd, while being followed by McMahon and WWF officials. As {{the climax of the}} match approached, the two wrestlers returned to the ring while WWF officials continued to order more personnel to ringside. Hart first became suspicious as to why Vince McMahon was not at the announcers' table to perform commentary, and why the on-screen commissioner Sgt. Slaughter was also standing at ringside with Vince McMahon. Nevertheless, the match continued. As planned, Michaels pushed Hebner in front of him as Hart jumped from the top turnbuckle, sending all three men to the canvas. Michaels and Hart both got up, but Michaels performed a rake on Hart's eye, sending Hart back to the mat. Michaels then proceeded to grab Hart's legs to execute the Sharpshooter maneuver. At this point, the match director was heard shouting instructions into his headset for Hebner to get up, but Hart did not notice anything amiss. Mike Chioda, the referee who was supposed to run in after Hebner went down, began yelling back that Hebner was not supposed to be up yet. Pat Patterson reacted in a similar way, and Owen Hart and Davey Boy Smith, who were waiting for their cues to run in, remained backstage in a state of confusion. Michaels was then seen by many viewers as having glanced at Hebner as he put Hart in the sharpshooter, which some saw as proof that he was in on the scheme. Contrary to their agreed plan, Michaels tightened the hold and refused to offer his own leg to Hart for the latter {{to break out of the}} hold. At that moment, Hebner <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> feet, looked toward timekeeper Mark Yeaton, and shouted, [...] "Ring the bell!" [...] McMahon then elbowed Yeaton hard and yelled, [...] "Ring the fucking bell!" [...] Yeaton rang the bell just as Hart reached forward and grabbed Michaels' leg, which broke the hold and caused Michaels to fall. Michaels' theme music then began playing and the ring announcer declared him the winner and the new WWF World Heavyweight Champion. Hebner had already exited the ring and was on his way out of the arena. After an initial moment of shock, Hart <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> feet, approached the apron where McMahon was standing and spat directly in his face, while Michaels feigned confusion. Michaels was ordered by McMahon to [...] "pick up the damn belt and get the hell out of here!" [...] Michaels left the arena with Brisco and Triple H and the broadcast signal cut off almost immediately after Michaels exited, with the last shot being a tight closeup of the Survivor Series logo above the entranceway. McMahon and most other WWF officials also quickly made their way backstage as an angry Hart smashed cameras, monitors, and ringside equipment. Fans in attendance also began to vent their fury on McMahon and WWF officials; a few even heaped garbage on them and some who were close enough pushed Michaels as he hurried backstage. Owen Hart, Neidhart and Davey Boy came out to the ring and had a conversation with Bret calming him down. Hart proceeded to finger trace [...] "W-C-W" [...] and [...] "I love you" [...] to the cheering fans before returning backstage.|$|E
