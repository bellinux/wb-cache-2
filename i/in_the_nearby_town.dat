5|$|Although {{not very}} much is known about Allen's childhood, the town of Cornwall was {{frontier}} territory in the 1740s.

5|$|At {{the same}} time the Playhouse was built, Coonley agreed to build a {{kindergarten}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>nearby</b> <b>town</b> of Downers Grove, which did not have a public school.

5|$|From {{its heyday}} of the 1850s until the Great Depression in the 1930s, Jeffersonville was the leading center of U.S. {{steamboat}} production, due largely to its excellent harbor, which remained the deepest in the surrounding area. Many individuals {{who lived in the}} district worked at the Howard Shipyards, that became Jeffboat <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>nearby</b> <b>town</b> of Port Fulton, which was eventually annexed into Jeffersonville. The town gained its first railroad in 1852, connecting to Columbus, Indiana, and {{with the opening of the}} Fourteenth Street Bridge in 1870, became a railroad center. The city became an important distribution center during the Civil War for the Union Army, because three railroads connected to Jeffersonville and because the Ohio River served as a defensive barrier against invasion from Confederate attack, it was deemed a safer location than the more vulnerable city of Louisville, Kentucky located on the southern side of the river.|$|E
