30|$|Consistent {{with recent}} {{information}} asymmetry literature, information-sharing bureaus are measured by assessing public <b>credit</b> bureaus and <b>private</b> <b>credit</b> registries (Triki and Gajigo 2014; Asongu et al. 2016). Asongu et al. (2016) have documented six distinguishing characteristics between public <b>credit</b> bureaus and <b>private</b> <b>credit</b> registries, notably: purpose, coverage, status, ownership, data sources used, and access. First, whereas <b>private</b> <b>credit</b> registries {{are made up}} of public institutions that are constituted within the framework of supervising the banking sector, public credit bureaus are created in response to the need and demand for information on borrowers in the banking market. Hence, data from <b>private</b> <b>credit</b> registries, usually employed to examine the creditworthiness of clients, could also be acknowledged as a collateral benefit or by-product of <b>private</b> <b>credit</b> registries. Second, while the coverage engendered by <b>private</b> <b>credit</b> registries is restricted in terms of information (or data) type and history provided, public credit bureaus extend beyond the scope of large corporations and include small and medium size enterprises (SMEs) that are characterized by richer data and longer histories. Third, whereas public credit bureaus are fundamentally established for profit making, <b>private</b> <b>credit</b> registries are not primarily focused on profits. Fourth, on the issue of ownership, whereas public credit registries belong to governments and/or central banks, the ownership of <b>private</b> <b>credit</b> bureaus revolve outside highlighted establishments (central banks and governments) to include lenders, lenders’ associates, and independent third parties. Fifth, while the data used by <b>private</b> <b>credit</b> registries are sourced from non-bank and bank financial establishments, data from public <b>credit</b> bureaus entails <b>private</b> <b>credit</b> registries, tax authorities, courts and utilities, to sources employed by <b>private</b> <b>credit</b> registries for information. Sixth, access to <b>private</b> <b>credit</b> registries (public credit bureaus) is restricted to providers of information (open to all lender types).|$|R

Therefore, this study investigates the implication of government investment on construction, <b>private</b> <b>credit</b> expansion and imports from India, on the rupee reserves through a four-dimensional SVAR approach. The results indicate that in the immediate term, it is the government construction expenditure, <b>private</b> <b>credit</b> growth and imports from India that deteriorates the rupee reserves.

40|$|International trade {{relies on}} trade finance (credit or insurance) by {{financial}} institutions. Data limitations, however, {{have made it}} difficult to quantify the impact of changes in the supply of trade finance on trade. This paper is the first to establish a causal link between the supply of <b>private</b> <b>credit</b> insurance and exports. I overcome endogeneity issues by using a unique bilateral data set which covers the activities from 1992 to 2006 of one of the world's leading <b>private</b> <b>credit</b> insurers. This database enables me to use the insurer's claim ratio - a primary determinant of the supply of credit insurance - as an instrument for insured exports. Subsequently, applying the method of instrumental variables and a variety of trade models, I consistently find a positive and statistically significant effect of <b>private</b> <b>credit</b> insurance on exports. The estimates are economically relevant and suggest that, depending on the decline in the supply of <b>private</b> <b>credit</b> insurance during the 2008 - 09 international trade collapse, the reduction in private insurance exposure explains about 5 to 9 percent of the drop in world exports and 10 to 20 percent of the drop in European exports. trade finance; <b>private</b> <b>credit</b> insurance; international trade; trade credit...|$|R

40|$|One of {{the most}} widely used {{indicators}} of financial development in the empirical literature is the <b>Private</b> <b>Credit</b> to GDP ratio. A key shortcoming of this measure {{is that it does not}} distinguish between the share of credit extended to households vis-a-vis firms. It is our contention that this distinction is crucial to analyze the effects of financial development on the trade balance: Changes in the composition of <b>private</b> <b>credit</b> should have an impact on the foreign trade deficit. Our empirical findings show that: 1) <b>Private</b> <b>credit</b> to households is negatively and significantly correlated with net exports; 2) <b>Private</b> <b>credit</b> to firms is not significantly correlated with net exports; and 3) The allocation of credit matters; a higher proportion of firm credit is positively and significantly correlated with net exports. A key implication of these results is that, whenever there is a sizeable trade deficit or a high risk of a currency crisis, policy makers should limit the growth of household credit while, at the same time, encourage further allocation of funds to firms. ...|$|R

The third result indicates unidirectional causation from <b>private</b> sector <b>credit</b> to the exchange rate. The reverse is not true. This implies that exchange rates do not necessarily affect <b>private</b> sector <b>credit.</b> Indeed, results from the normalized cointegrating equation reveal that exchange rates are not significant in the long-run <b>private</b> sector <b>credit</b> equation. Similarly, short-run dynamics in the VEC model show that the coefficient of the ECT in the exchange rate equation is not significant although it bears the expected negative sign. The fourth result reveals bi-directional causation between core CPI and <b>private</b> sector <b>credit,</b> implying that inflation affects <b>private</b> sector <b>credit</b> and that the reverse is also true.|$|R

We use estimation results obtained for a panel of small open OECD economies (out-of-sample sample) to derive the equilibrium credit level for a panel of transition economies (in-sample panel). We opt for this (out-of-sample) approach because the coefficient estimates for transition economies are fairly unstable. We show that there is a large amount of uncertainty to determine the equilibrium level of <b>private</b> <b>credit.</b> Yet our results indicate that a number of countries are very close or even above the estimated equilibrium levels, whereas others are still well below the equilibrium level...|$|R

And the possibility of credit risk caused by <b>private</b> <b>credit</b> is mainly coming from portfolio inflows rather than direct inflows. Finally, portfolio inflows strengthen the positive relationship between credit excess and credit risk in Asian countries, and this trend is seen more in these after the global financial crisis.

We find that access-to-finance obstacles and <b>private</b> <b>credit</b> increase the dispersion of distortions. Public credit has a very small effect. For firms that do not face financial obstacles, public credit increases the dispersion of distortions; for firms that face financial obstacles, it slightly decreases dispersion.

Quantitatively, however, financial variables explain a very small part of the dispersion of factor market and size distortions...|$|R
