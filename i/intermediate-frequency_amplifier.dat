50|$|The TR-1 was a {{superheterodyne}} receiver made with four n-p-n transistors and one diode. It contained a single transistor converter stage, {{followed by two}} <b>intermediate-frequency</b> <b>amplifier</b> stages. After detection, a single-transistor stage amplified the sound frequency. All amplifier stages used common emitter amplifiers. Stages were transformer coupled, with tuned transformers for the intermediate frequency amplifiers and a miniature audio transformer for the loudspeaker. The intermediate frequency transformers were paired with capacitors, and hand tuned to the intermediate frequency (262 kHz) using movable cores.|$|E
40|$|Electrical shock {{excitation}} of the input circuits of the <b>intermediate-frequency</b> <b>amplifier</b> of a radar system is discussed. The deleterious effects of shock from the trailing {{edge of a}} strong pulse are discussed. Fidelity of reproduction of {{the trailing edge of}} a high-amplitude pulse is shown {{to be related to the}} frequency at which the amplifier input circuit is resonant. The pulse fall time is shown to be an important factor in the choice of an intermediate frequency. Although the report is written with reference to a marine navigational radar having high definition at short range, it may be of value in the design of other radar systems where shock effects following a high-amplitude pulse cannot be tolerated.

5000|$|One of the {{applications}} of the resonant transformer is for the CCFL inverter. Another application of the resonant transformer is to couple between stages of a superheterodyne receiver, where the selectivity of the receiver is provided by tuned transformers in the <b>intermediate-frequency</b> <b>amplifiers.</b> [...] The Tesla coil is a resonant transformer circuit used to generate very high voltages, {{and is able to}} provide much higher current than high voltage electrostatic machines such as the Van de Graaff generator.　Resonant energy transfer is adopted as induction current collector of SCMaglev and AGV as application of large electric power transfer. The operating principle is behind proposed short range (up to 2 metre) wireless electricity systems such as WiTricity or Rezence and systems that have already been deployed, such as Qi power transfer, passive RFID tags and contactless smart cards.|$|R
40|$|Master of ScienceDepartment of Electrical and Computer EngineeringWilliam KuhnFrom 2004 to 2008, Kansas State University's Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE) department, {{along with}} the NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory and Peregrine Semiconductor, {{researched}} design techniques for producing a low-power, 400 MHz micro-transceiver suitable for future use on Mars scout missions. In 2012, Dr. Kuhn's Digital Radio Hardware Design class, ECE 765, adapted the K-State circuit designs from this research project to investigate the possibility of producing a 2. 4 GHz micro-transceiver in Peregrine Semiconductor’s newer 0. 25 [mu]m Silicon on Sapphire process. This report expands upon the work completed in the Digital Radio Hardware Design (ECE 765) course. The schematics and layout of the subsections of the receiver portion of the micro-transceiver chip, consisting of a transmit/receive switch, low-noise <b>amplifier,</b> mixer, <b>intermediate-frequency</b> <b>amplifiers,</b> and an analog-to-digital converter are described. Circuits designed to date require a total of 15 mW to operate. This report is intended {{as a guide for}} future students who will take over this project, make modifications, adapt the transmit portion of the micro-transceiver from previous work, and finish layout before fabrication of a full 2. 4 GHz prototype chip...|$|R
40|$|Wide-band <b>intermediate-frequency</b> (IF) <b>amplifiers</b> {{are needed}} when the data rates of {{communication}} systems increase. A single wide-band IF amplifier {{can also be}} used for a radio band with several narrow-band channels of varying strengths. High linearity is then required if intermodulation products are not to disturb weak channels. We have previously reported a highly linear wide-band IF amplifier in a complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor process. Using a similar topology, an npn-only bipolar amplifier with even higher linearity is now presented. The amplifier is fully differential and operates with a 5 V supply, At 20 MHz, 5 Vpp over a 1 kΩ load, the measured total harmonic distortion is just 9. 068 %...|$|R
40|$|TELIS (TErahertz and submm LImb Sounder) is a {{cooperation}} between European institutes, DLR, RAL, and SRON, {{to build a}} three-channel balloon-borne heterodyne spectrometer for atmospheric research. Many atmospheric trace gases have their rotational transitions in the sub millimeter and THz range, yielding a very rich spectrum. Limb sounding results in very accurate vertical profiles. All three TELIS receivers will operate simultaneously. The 500 GHz channel is developed by RAL and will produce vertical profiles of BrO, ClO, O 3, and N 2 O. The 1. 8 THz channel is developed by DLR and will mainly target the OH radical, and will also measure HO 2, HCl, NO, NO 2, O 3, H 2 O, O 2, and HOCl. Finally the 550 - 650 GHz channel is developed by SRON and IREE and will measure profiles of ClO, BrO, O 3, HCl, HOCl, H 2 O, and its 3 isotopologues, HO 2, NO, N 2 O, HNO 3, CH 3 Cl, and HCN. TELIS will fly on the MIPAS-B 2 gondola. The two instruments together will yield the most complete set of stratospheric constituents. The qualification flight is foreseen {{in the winter of}} 2006 / 2007. The TELIS instrument serves as a test bed for many novel cryogenic heterodyne technology: novel low-noise cryogenic heterodyne mixer detectors, novel low-noise cryogenic <b>intermediate-frequency</b> <b>amplifiers,</b> novel back-end spectrometer. In the presentation these technologies will be discussed and compared with ‘standard’ technology as applied in the Microwave Limb Sounder (MLS) on EOS-Aura, launched in 2004. Emphasis will be on the science and technology of the channel developed by SRON. It contains a Superconducting Integrated Receiver (SIR), which combines on a 4 x 4 mm 2 chip the low-noise Superconductor-isolator-Superconductor (SIS) mixer and its quasi-optical antenna, a superconducting phase-locked Flux Flow Oscillator (FFO) acting as Local Oscillator (LO) and SIS Harmonic Mixer (HM) for FFO phase locking. Latest test results and retrieval simulations will be presented. ...|$|R
40|$|We present {{measurement}} results {{for a new}} type of integrated terahertz receiver, as an extension to previous work by the authors. The receiver we developed integrates quasi-optically coupled phonon-cooled NbN hot electron bolometric (HEB) mixers in close proximity with InP monolithic microwave integrated circuit (MMIC) <b>intermediate-frequency</b> (IF) <b>amplifiers.</b> We have measured antenna radiation pattern, receiver noise temperature, and bandwidth, as well as short-term stability of the integrated receivers. The measurements were performed at 1. 6 and 2. 5 THz over a very broadband IF frequency range. We have been able to extend the effective bandwidth of these receivers up to 5 GHz, the widest reported for any integrated configuration operating above 1 THz. The suitability of the HEB/MMIC approach for imaging applications has been confirmed through the development of a prototype system for near-range scanning. The results presented here are very promising for the future development of heterodyne focal plane arrays for space-based receivers, medical applications, and surveillance...|$|R
