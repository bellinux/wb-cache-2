5|$|Fine needle {{aspiration}} (FNA) {{can be used}} to biopsy bone lesions, {{once found}} on an X-ray or other scan. Such tests can be vital in diagnosis and can also prevent unnecessary treatment and <b>invasive</b> <b>surgery.</b> Conversely, FNA biopsy of tumors of the parathyroid gland is not recommended for diagnosing parathyroid carcinoma and may in fact be harmful, as the needle can puncture the tumor, leading to dissemination and the possible spread of cancerous cells.|$|E
5|$|In clitoridectomy, the {{clitoris}} may {{be removed}} {{as part of}} a radical vulvectomy to treat cancer such as vulvar intraepithelial neoplasia; however, modern treatments favor more conservative approaches, as <b>invasive</b> <b>surgery</b> can have psychosexual consequences. Clitoridectomy more often involves parts of the clitoris being partially or completely removed during FGM, which may be additionally known as female circumcision or female genital cutting (FGC). Removing the glans of the clitoris {{does not mean that the}} whole structure is lost, since the clitoris reaches deep into the genitals.|$|E

5000|$|Minimally {{invasive}} {{procedures are}} a more common alternative {{due to the}} decreased risk of damaging significant muscle tissue. The difference between invasive and minimally <b>invasive</b> spinal <b>surgeries</b> is that minimally invasive procedures involves {{a series of small}} incisions. Minimally invasive procedures can be performed anywhere along the spine, and have been used to treat various abnormalities. The percutaneous pedicle screw fixation technique allows for a procedure that presents minimal risk to the patient. Fluoroscopic image guided navigation through these portals allows for surgeons to perform more efficient procedures. Minimally invasive procedures often yield a much faster recovery time than fully <b>invasive</b> <b>surgeries,</b> making them more appealing to patients. Laminectomies have always been the gold standard when treating lumbar spinal stenosis, but recently, less <b>invasive</b> <b>surgeries</b> have emerged as a safer alternative treatment that helps maintain the postoperative structural integrity of the spine.|$|R
5|$|The Combine are {{frequently}} shown as harsh rulers over {{the citizens of}} Earth, suppressing dissent with brutality, policing using violence and using <b>invasive</b> <b>surgery</b> to transform humans into either soldiers or slaves. Throughout the games, the player primarily battles with transformed humans as well as synthetic and mechanical enemies that {{are the product of}} Combine technology. The atmosphere generated by the dystopian Combine state has been praised by reviewers, although the artificial intelligence of the transhuman Combine characters was thought to be inferior to that of other characters in Half-Life 2. In addition to their role within the Half-Life series, the Combine have been adapted for machinima productions and one Combine character type has been made into plush toys by Valve.|$|E
5|$|The {{procedure}} requested, for {{an investigation}} into the hemodynamic changes in a patient with chronic venous insufficiency, which results in chronic venous disease, is quite different from an examination request made for suspected deep vein thrombosis. For a DVT investigation {{there is a need for}} guidance as to what to look for and to the intended treatment. An investigation performed with the intention of treating the patient by vein stripping or laser therapy for example is very different from the examination performed with the intention of executing a CHIVA. This French originated procedure is also spelt out as conservative hemodynamic treatment for chronic venous insufficiency. A CHIVA is an ultrasound guided, minimally <b>invasive</b> <b>surgery</b> strategic for the treatment of varicose veins, performed under local anaesthetic.|$|E
25|$|In the 2000s {{minimally}} <b>invasive</b> <b>surgery</b> {{became more}} prevalent. Considerable enthusiasm {{has been built}} around robotic surgery (also known as robotic-assisted surgery), {{despite a lack of}} data suggesting it has significant benefits that justify its cost.|$|E

25|$|The Ravitch {{technique}} is an <b>invasive</b> <b>surgery</b> that {{was introduced in}} 1949 and developed in the 1950s. It involves creating an incision along the chest through which the cartilage is removed and the sternum detached. A small bar is inserted underneath the sternum to hold {{it up in the}} desired position. The bar is left implanted until the cartilage grows back, typically about six months. The bar is subsequently removed in a simple out-patient procedure; this {{technique is}} thus a two-stage procedure.|$|E
25|$|Thousands of men, {{women and}} {{children}} interned at prisoner of war camps were subjected to vivisection, often without anesthesia and usually ending {{with the death of}} the victim. Vivisections were performed on prisoners after infecting them with various diseases. Researchers performed <b>invasive</b> <b>surgery</b> on prisoners, removing organs to study the effects of disease on the human body. These were conducted while the patients were alive because it was feared that the decomposition process would affect the results. The infected and vivisected prisoners included men, women, children, and infants.|$|E

25|$|Rice was {{diagnosed}} with brain tumour in September 1998 and received treatment in Hanover, Germany. In February 2015, Rice collapsed at his house in Johannesburg and scans at a local hospital found that, as his tumor was located deep down, {{it could not be}} removed by a neurosurgeon by <b>invasive</b> <b>surgery.</b> Rice then went to Health Care Global in Bangalore, India and received robotic radiation treatment to have the tumor removed. The surgery was successful and Rice returned home in March 2015. On the morning of 28 July 2015, Rice died from sepsis in the Morningside hospital in Johannesburg.|$|E
25|$|Patients {{under general}} {{anesthesia}} must undergo continuous physiological monitoring to ensure safety. In the US, the American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) have established minimum monitoring guidelines for patients receiving general anesthesia, regional anesthesia, or sedation. This includes electrocardiography (ECG), heart rate, blood pressure, inspired and expired gases, oxygen saturation {{of the blood}} (pulse oximetry), and temperature. In the UK the Association of Anaesthetists (AAGBI) have set minimum monitoring guidelines for general and regional anesthesia. For minor surgery, this generally includes monitoring of heart rate, oxygen saturation, blood pressure, and inspired and expired concentrations for oxygen, carbon dioxide, and inhalational anesthetic agents. For more <b>invasive</b> <b>surgery,</b> monitoring may also include temperature, urine output, blood pressure, central venous pressure, pulmonary artery pressure and pulmonary artery occlusion pressure, cardiac output, cerebral activity, and neuromuscular function. In addition, the operating room environment must be monitored for ambient temperature and humidity, {{as well as for}} accumulation of exhaled inhalational anesthetic agents, which might be deleterious to the health of operating room personnel.|$|E
25|$|In 2013, {{multiple}} firms announced {{devices that}} could be inserted via a leg catheter rather than <b>invasive</b> <b>surgery.</b> The devices are roughly {{the size and shape}} of a pill, much smaller than the size of a traditional pacemaker. Once implanted, the device's prongs contact the muscle and stabilize heartbeats. Engineers and scientists are currently working on this type of device. In November 2014 a patient, Bill Pike of Fairbanks, Alaska, received a Medtronic Micra pacemaker in Providence St Vincent Hospital in Portland Oregon. D. Randolph Jones was the EP doctor. In 2014 also St. Jude Medical Inc. announced the first enrollments in the company’s leadless Pacemaker Observational Study evaluating the Nanostim leadless pacing technology. The Nanostim pacemaker received CE marking in 2013. The post-approval implants have occurred in Europe. The European study was recently stopped, after there were reports of six perforations that led to two patient deaths. After investigations St Jude Medical restarted the study. But in the United States this therapy is still not approved by the FDA. While the St Jude Nanostim and the Medtronic Micra are just single-chamber pacemakers it is anticipated that leadless dual-chamber pacing for patients with atrioventricular block will become possible with further development.|$|E

25|$|Baltacha's 2003 season started slowly; {{she lost}} in round {{one of the}} {{qualifying}} tournament for the first Grand Slam of the year, the Australian Open. In April she was again part of the Great Britain Fed Cup team but lost her only match against Hungary's Petra Mandula. She spent May failing {{to qualify for the}} tier III tournament, the Internationaux de Strasbourg and the second Grand Slam of the year, the French Open. In June she was given a wild card into the main draw of the DFS Classic but was forced to retire during her first round match against fellow Brit Jane O'Donoghue after {{the first game of the}} final set. She was then awarded another wild card; this one into the qualifying draw of the tier II Hastings Direct International where she was beaten by Virginie Razzano. For the third year running, she received a wild card into the main draw of Wimbledon where she forced the former world number 5, Jelena Dokić, to fight for her eventual three-set victory. This was Baltacha's final match of the year as she underwent <b>invasive</b> <b>surgery</b> after Wimbledon (to determine the cause of her persistent liver troubles) which put her out of action until 2004. As a result, her year-end singles ranking fell to world number 373.|$|E
25|$|The {{addition}} of another modality of treatment {{is referred to}} as adjuvant (literally helping) therapy, compared to its use as the initial (primary) therapy, also referred to as radical therapy. Consequently, many of these patients have been treated with adjuvant radiation, with or without chemotherapy. In the above series of reports of minimally <b>invasive</b> <b>surgery,</b> many (30–80%) patients received adjuvant radiation. However, functional outcomes were worse if radiation was added to surgery and worst if both radiation and chemotherapy were used. Radiation dosage has largely followed that derived for all head and neck cancers, in this setting, based on risk. Historically only one randomised clinical trial has addressed optimal dosage, allocated patients to two dosage levels, stratified by risk, but showed no difference in cancer control between the low and high doses (63 and 68.4Gy), but a higher incidence of complications at the higher doses. Consequently, the lower dose of 57.6Gy was recommended. Because the authors used a fractionation scheme of 1.8Gy per treatment, this dosage was not widely adopted, practitioners preferring a larger fraction of 2Gy to produce a shorter treatment time, and a slightly higher dose of 60Gy in 2Gy fractions (30 daily treatments). Yet 57.6Gy in 1.8Gy fractions is equivalent (iso-effective dose) to only 56Gy in 2Gy fractions. 60Gy corresponds to the 63Gy used as the low dose in the high risk group. 60Gy was also the dose used in RTOG 73-03. Subsequently, there was a tendency to intensify treatment in head and neck cancer, and a number of centres adopted a dose of 66Gy, at least for those patients with adverse tumour features. The effectiveness of PORT in HPV+OPC receives some support from a cohort study (Level 2b), although the number of patients was low, and the number of events (recurrent disease or death) only 7%. Another retrospective population-level study (Level 4) of the SEER database (1998–2011) concluded that there was an overall survival but not disease-specific survival effect of radiation in 410 patients with a single lymph node involved, but used only univariate statistical analysis and contained no information on HPV status. A subsequent much larger study on a similar population in the National Cancer Database (2004–2013) of over 9,000 patients found a survival advantage but this was only in HPV-OPC, not in 410 HPV+OPC patients.|$|E
500|$|For cancers {{involving}} {{the head of}} the pancreas, the Whipple procedure is the most commonly attempted curative surgical treatment. This is a major operation which involves removing the pancreatic head and the curve of the duodenum together ("pancreato-duodenectomy"), making a bypass for food from the stomach to the jejunum ("gastro-jejunostomy") and attaching a loop of jejunum to the cystic duct to drain bile ("cholecysto-jejunostomy"). It can be performed only if the person is likely to survive major surgery and if the cancer is localized without invading local structures or metastasizing. It can, therefore, be performed only in a minority of cases. [...] Cancers of the tail of the pancreas can be resected using a procedure known as a distal pancreatectomy, which often also entails removal of the spleen. Nowadays, this can often be done using minimally <b>invasive</b> <b>surgery.</b>|$|E
