5|$|Llanbadarn Fawr was {{the focus}} of the English forces {{assembled}} in south Wales against the insurrection of Rhys ab Meredydd in 1287. By this time the rector was invariably an absentee cleric; John de Camera, Rector 1329–1334 was also canon of St David's, Hereford and Abergwili, and was a government clerk. Then, as now, such a large and remote charge invited pluralism and non-residence. There was, at this time, a comparatively small amount in tithes, but the rector was nonetheless equivalent <b>in</b> <b>substance</b> to an abbot, owing to the ownership of extensive lands by Frankalmoin tenure.|$|E
5|$|Bahá'í {{notions of}} {{progressive}} religious revelation result in their accepting {{the validity of}} the well known religions of the world, whose founders and central figures are seen as Manifestations of God. Religious history is interpreted as a series of dispensations, where each manifestation brings a somewhat broader and more advanced revelation that is rendered as a text of scripture and passed on through history with greater or lesser reliability but at least true <b>in</b> <b>substance,</b> suited for the time and place in which it was expressed. Specific religious social teachings (for example, the direction of prayer, or dietary restrictions) may be revoked by a subsequent manifestation so that a more appropriate requirement for the time and place may be established. Conversely, certain general principles (for example, neighbourliness, or charity) are seen to be universal and consistent. In Bahá'í belief, this process of progressive revelation will not end; it is, however, believed to be cyclical. Bahá'ís do not expect a new manifestation of God to appear within 1000 years of Bahá'u'lláh's revelation.|$|E
5|$|On March 3, 1918, Germany and the now-Bolshevik Russia {{signed the}} Treaty of Brest-Litovsk. It {{declared}} that the Baltic nations were in the German interest zone and that Russia renounced any claims to them. On March 23, Germany recognized independent Lithuania {{on the basis of}} the December 11 declaration. However, <b>in</b> <b>substance,</b> nothing had changed either in Lithuania or in the Council's status: any efforts to establish an administration were hindered. This situation changed when the German Revolution started and Germany lost the war in the fall of 1918 – it was no longer in a position to dictate terms. The Council of Lithuania adopted the first provisional constitution on November 2. The functions of government were entrusted to a three-member presidium, and Augustinas Voldemaras was invited to form the first Cabinet of Ministers of Lithuania. Complete international recognition took several years; the US affirmed it on July 28, 1922.|$|E

25|$|In the {{theology}} of God in Mormonism, the most prominent conception of God is the Godhead, a divine council of three distinct beings: Elohim (the Father), Jehovah (the Son, or Jesus), and the Holy Spirit.

Mormonism recognizes the divinity of the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, but believes they are distinct beings, united not <b>in</b> <b>substance</b> but in will and purpose, and they are each omniscient, omnipotent, and omni-benevolent.|$|E

25|$|In sum, the Committee {{finds that}} the {{complaint}} is not sufficient in form and substance to warrant its further consideration. It is not sufficient in form because the verification made by the affiants that the allegations in the resolution “are true and correct of our own knowledge” is transparently false. It taxes the ken of men {{to believe that the}} affiants individually could swear to the truth of allegations, relative to the transactions that allegedly transpired in foreign countries given the barrier of geography and the restrictions of their laws. More important, the resolution cannot be sufficient <b>in</b> <b>substance</b> because its careful assay shows that it is a mere charade of conclusions.|$|E

The trait positive urgency, defined as the tendency to engage in risky behaviour under conditions of extreme positive affect, is predictive of substance or behavioural problems that lead to addiction. This trait represents an underlying dysregulation in response to extreme affective states and has a direct impact on behaviour. The trait 'positive urgency' has been shown to have a predictive relationship with increases in drinking quantity and alcohol-related problems in college, as well as drug use in college. Furthermore, this trait provides important information on how positive affect can increase the likelihood of engaging <b>in</b> <b>substance</b> abuse.|$|E
