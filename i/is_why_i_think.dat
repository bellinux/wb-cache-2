500|$|In August 2013, after Joss Whedon, {{director}} of , announced that Hank Pym {{would not be}} Ultron's creator, Wright said Ultron was never {{a part of the}} story of Ant-Man, explaining that [...] "just to sort of set up what Ant-Man does is enough for one movie". Wright described Ant-Man as a stand-alone film but said it would fit into to the larger continuity of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, explaining, [...] "I like to make it standalone because I think the premise of it needs time. I want to put the crazy premise of it into a real world, which <b>is</b> <b>why</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> Iron Man really works because it's a relatively simple universe; it's relatable. I definitely want to go into finding a streamlined format where you use the origin format to introduce the main character and further adventures can bring other people into it." [...] Wright also stated that pre-production for Ant-Man would begin in October and filming would begin in 2014. The next month, Disney moved the film's release date up to July 31, 2015.|$|E

6000|$|... "I suppose Lord Steyne won't {{talk about}} it very much," [...] said Captain Macmurdo; [...] "and <b>I</b> don't see <b>why</b> our side should. The affair ain't a very pretty one, any way you take it, and the less said about it the better.

6000|$|... "Or else," [...] Fischer remarked, [...] "a {{wonderful}} indifference. So far as I {{have studied}} the Anglo-Saxon temperament, I should be inclined {{to vote for the}} indifference. That <b>is</b> <b>why</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> Germany will win the war. Every man in that country prays for his country's success, not only in words, but with his soul. I have not found the same spirit in England." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I fear so," [...] the Count acknowledged. [...] "It {{appears to}} us that Servia has a secret {{understanding}} with Russia, or {{she would not have}} ventured upon such an attitude as she is now adopting towards us. If that be so, the possibilities of trouble are immense, almost boundless. That is why, Baroness, the Emperor has sent for you. That <b>is</b> <b>why</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> you should not hesitate to at once obey his summons." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "If {{the theory}} upon which I started this wild-goose chase is correct," [...] Crawshay explained, [...] "there is {{something}} on board this ship infinitely {{more valuable than}} the ship itself to Germany. That <b>is</b> <b>why</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> that she will strain every nerve to try and capture you, of course, but she will never sink you, because if she did she would lose everything her Secret Service have worked for in Germany ever since, and even before the commencement of the war." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That {{is because}} they were wet," [...] said Jonas. [...] "Pebbles always look {{brightest}} and most beautiful {{when they are in}} their own proper place, in the brook; and that <b>is</b> the reason <b>why</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> it <b>is</b> generally best to leave them there." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Carrie," [...] he said, [...] "you {{will tell}} me more if you wish; if not, it doesn't matter. There is another thing I want to say. I have often been sorry for you, but I felt {{that you would not}} find it quite so hard some day. That <b>is</b> <b>why</b> <b>I</b> waited--I <b>think</b> very patiently--though it was a little hard on me, too. I thought I knew what you must feel--indeed, you showed it to me--and I was horribly afraid that, if I was too hasty, I might lose you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "To <b>be</b> sure! <b>Why</b> didn't <b>I</b> <b>think</b> of that?"

6000|$|... "You will admit, {{as every}} one did, {{that there was}} {{something}} very pathetic about the unfortunate man's position, so helpless to defend himself, if defence there was, against so much overwhelming evidence. That <b>is</b> <b>why</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> public sympathy remained with him. Still, it was terrible to think of his wife presumably knowing him to be guilty, and anxiously waiting whilst dreading the moment when, restored to health, he would have to face the doubts, the suspicions, probably the open accusations, which were fast rising up around him." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You will accept, I trust, sir," [...] {{the latter}} begged, [...] "this {{assurance}} of my extreme regret {{at the present}} unfortunate condition of affairs. I am {{one of those who}} threw his hat into the air on the boulevards in August, 1914, when the news came that your great country had decided to fulfil her unwritten promises and in the cause of honour had declared war against Germany. I have never forgotten that moment, sir, even in those months and years of misunderstandings which followed the signing of the Treaty of Peace. I {{was one of those who}} pointed always to the sacrifices which Great Britain had made on our behalf, to her glorious deeds on land and sea. I have always been a friend of your country, Mr. Mervin Brown. That <b>is</b> <b>why</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> I was chosen to bring this dispatch." ...|$|E
6000|$|He did {{not come}} back, {{and when she was}} ready to go to supper she had {{to go down to the}} rocks for him. His angry fit seemed to have passed, but he looked abjectly sad, and her heart ached at sight of him. She said, cheerfully, [...] "I have been reading that love-business over again, Brice, and I don't find it so far out as I was afraid it was. Salome is a little too prononcée, but you can easily mend that. She is a {{delightful}} character, and you have given her charm--too much charm. I don't believe there's a truer woman in the whole range of the drama. She is perfect, and that <b>is</b> <b>why</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> you can afford to keep her back a little in the passages with Haxard. Of course, Godolphin wants to shine there. You needn't give him her speeches, but you can put them somewhere else, in some of the scenes with Atland; it won't make any difference how much she outshines him, poor fellow." ...|$|E
2500|$|Ignis {{has been}} given the 2016 Best Sidekick of the Year award from Game Informer, who cited [...] "...the {{multifaceted}} ways he helps the group and the sacrifices he makes to ensure their journey is successful" [...] as their reasoning for their choice. Ignis also came in second in USGamer's Best Sidekick of the Year award; USGamer's Kat Bailey, in her reasoning for nominating Ignis for Sidekick of the Year, said that [...] "...Ignis still makes his mark {{in the latter part}} of the story. In fact, the turn his character takes and the effect that it has on the party <b>is</b> ultimately <b>why</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> he's the most significant of Final Fantasy XVs secondary characters." ...|$|R
5000|$|On the Valentine's Day {{weekend of}} 2016, Rayvon debuted a new single, [...] "Can't Fight It" [...] written with Mylen, Nate Merchant, and Isaiah Tejada. The {{accompanying}} music video acts as his official [...] "coming out" [...] as gay, sharing a kiss {{at the end}} with LGBT activist Shane Bitney Crone. Rayvon told Billboard: [...] "You’d {{be surprised at the}} amount of times I tried to pray the gay away from me or tried to tell God to take this away from me. No kid should have to do what I did and pray to not be who they <b>are.</b> That’s <b>why</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> it’s important even in 2016 to say this." ...|$|R
40|$|This note is a {{critical}} review of the spatial brightness experiment reported by Kakitsuba [Kakitsuba 2015]. There <b>are</b> several reasons <b>why</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> the study <b>is</b> flawed and therefore that the results {{should not be considered}} credible. In particular, the results can largely be explained by a stimulus range bias, the ‘boundary’ illuminances tending to lie near the centre of each range of illuminances reported. Therefore the results are a product of the illuminance ranges chosen by the experimenter and do not indicate observers’ preferences for light level...|$|R
6000|$|... "The {{father of}} a family with a {{comfortable}} home and a prosperous business can drill {{as well as the}} most careless vaurien, René; better, perhaps, for he will take much greater pains; {{but when it comes to}} fighting, half a dozen reckless daredevils are worth a hundred of him. I think if I had been Trochu I would have issued an order that every unmarried man in Paris between the ages of sixteen and forty-five should be organized into, you might call it, the active National Guard for continual service outside the walls, while the married men should be reserved for defending the enceinte at the last extremity. The outside force might be but a third of the whole, but they would be worth as much as the whole force together. That <b>is</b> <b>why</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> that our corps may distinguish itself. We have none of us wives or families and nothing much to lose, consequently we shall fight well. We shan't mind hardships for we have not been accustomed to luxuries. We are fighting as volunteers and not because the law calls us under arms.|$|E
5000|$|In June 2005, Rice stated: [...] "And at each phase, more Iraqis are {{involved}} in this process. Sunni and Shia and Kurds and other Iraqis are concentrating politically on building a united Iraq. That <b>is</b> <b>why</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> the insurgency must think that its last days are eventually going to come because the Iraqis are turning to their politics to serve their future." ...|$|E
5000|$|Arguing that Islam {{cannot be}} reformed, Sina says, “This {{is the way}} to fight evil. I do not want to kill the enemy. I want to win them as friends and allies. That is the real victory. In this way, we win because we {{eliminate}} our enemy, and our enemy wins by eliminating his ignorance and hate. That is why I believe in my cause. That <b>is</b> <b>why</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> I am an instrument of peace.” ...|$|E

40|$|I’m {{going to}} <b>be</b> talking about <b>why</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> it matters that we {{continue}} to discuss and write about the way that Romanies or Gypsies, Roma, and Irish and Scottish Travellers are represented in history, the arts, and other cultural forms. Some of what you’ll hear is informed by a workshop at which people from different professions and perspectives discussed these issues. This does not constitute new research, but uses what other academics have said on this subject over the last ten years to make some general points about the way academics do arts and humanities research in relation to these communities...|$|R
5000|$|... “A {{scientific}} {{theory is}} something that tries to increase our understanding by making a prediction, by saying ‘Okay, we’re {{going to say that}} the earth orbits around the sun, therefore we would expect to see this motion of the planets,’ or something like that. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> the thing that’s often overlooked is that the theory requires a mechanism. And <b>I</b> <b>think</b> this <b>is</b> <b>why</b> Freud ultimately <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>was</b> cast aside, because Freud had a lot of interesting ideas and suppositions about how the brain works, but he never offered any mechanisms.” ...|$|R
5000|$|In an {{interview}} {{published in the}} UK music weekly Record Mirror in 1967, Covay said, [...] "Singing is my first love, but I like to express my thoughts in the songs I write {{as well as in}} the way I sing them. I am always looking for experiences we all know and try to relate them through both my writing and my singing. This <b>is</b> <b>why</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> ‘Mercy, Mercy’ became so popular. It was down-to-earth, and everyone immediately recognized the meaning of the song from first-hand experience.” ...|$|E
5000|$|Despite his Jewish ethnicity, Chișinevschi frantically distanced {{himself from}} his origins and helped persecute Jews. For instance, on January 14, 1953, he wrote: [...] "The Jewish {{communities}} {{have always been a}} nest of thieves, of spies. The communities have always had Filderman and from the exploitation and robbing of poor people, to acts of criminal espionage, these have been part of their agenda. This <b>is</b> <b>why</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> we have to proceed firmly. The devil take them—they will eventually be quiet; otherwise they will damage us, and not only us, but the entire camp of peace".|$|E
5000|$|Bruce {{has often}} been outspoken {{regarding}} her commitment to feminism, expressing concern at a 2006 poll that suggested almost three-quarters of women no longer saw feminism as necessary; [...] "The contradictions are still there society which <b>is</b> <b>why</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> feminism is still very relevant for me and it's just such a shame that it's become a byword for mustachioed, man-hating women from Lebanon." [...] Despite her firm views on the subject - including a [...] "disappointment" [...] in women who don't like working with other women - she claims to have softened her feminist views from her university days, where she once ran an anti-pornography campaign.|$|E
5000|$|In Britain, as in {{continental}} Europe and the US, {{the work}} {{fell out of}} the repertoire. Sir Thomas Beecham revived it in 1919, and recalling in his memoirs that the public had stayed away he commented: I have often <b>been</b> asked <b>why</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> Falstaff <b>is</b> not more of a box-office attraction, and <b>I</b> do not <b>think</b> the answer is far to seek. Let it be admitted that there are fragments of melody as exquisite and haunting as anything that Verdi has written elsewhere, such as the duet of Nanetta and Fenton in the first act and the song of Fenton {{at the beginning of the}} final scene, which have something of the lingering beauty of an Indian summer. But in comparison with every other work of the composer, it is wanting in tunes of a broad and impressive character, and one or two of the type of [...] "O Mia Regina", [...] "Ritorna Vincitor", or [...] "Ora per sempre addio" [...] might have helped the situation.|$|R
5000|$|The {{morning after}} the 2010 general {{election}} presented the country with no one political party able to form a government that would command {{a majority in the}} House of Commons. In light of this reality the Conservative leader Cameron went public and gave a [...] "big, open and comprehensive offer" [...] to the Lib Dem leader and said that he wanted to open up negotiations with the Liberal Democrats to form Britain's first coalition government since the Second World War. Replying Clegg said that he had always maintained that the party with the most seats and the most votes {{should have the right to}} seek to govern. Speaking to the press he said: [...] "It seems this morning that it is the Conservative Party which has more votes and more seats - although not an absolute majority - which <b>is</b> <b>why</b> <b>I</b> now <b>think</b> that it is the Conservative Party which should seek to govern in the national interest." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Boys," [...] he was wont to say, [...] "you {{laugh at}} me for readin' the Bible carefully. You would not laugh at a schoolboy for reading his books carefully, would you? Yet the learnin' {{of the way of}} {{salvation}} is of far more consequence to me than book learnin' is to a schoolboy. An astronomer is never laughed at for readin' his books o' geometry an' suchlike day an' night--even to the injury of his health--but what is an astronomer's business to him compared with the concerns of my soul to me? Ministers tell me there are certain things I must know and believe if I would be saved--such as the death and resurrection of our Saviour Jesus Christ; and they also point out that the Bible speaks of certain Christians, who did well in refusin' to receive the Gospel {{at the hands of the}} apostles, without first enquirin' into these things, to see if they were true. Now, lads, if these things that so many millions believe in, and that you all profess to believe in, are lies, then you may well {{laugh at me}} for enquirin' into them; but if they <b>be</b> true, <b>why,</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> the devils themselves must be laughing at you for not enquirin' into them!" ...|$|R

5000|$|In an {{interview}} with Cowboys & Indians, Perry spoke about {{the evolution of the}} John Goodnight character, which he created. [...] He {{is turning out to be}} a little darker than I think everybody envisioned at the beginning. And I think that's because most of this guy's make-up, and most of his integrity, comes from that bad childhood experience, those bad things that happened to him in the first movie. He's still touched by that. Which <b>is</b> <b>why</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> he'll stay moving. They keep wanting to set him down in one place, and have him be the judge there. But that's not interesting to me. This is a guy who has to keep going to a different place time and again.|$|E

That <b>is</b> <b>why</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> the audience, very mixed, would have been happier if I had pulled a rabbit out of my hat. Or fallen into a trance. Listen, I never did anything like that in my life. My inspiration does not come from the supernatural, but from unconscious elaboration, which comes to the surface as a kind of revelation.

40|$|Ad Neeleman {{is a good}} {{representative}} of {{the large majority of}} modern theoretical linguists who work with generative-enumerative syntax (GES) theories. Like all GES theorists, he firmly defends the distinction between competence and performance, and of course I agree with him on that: no sensible grammarian wants or expects grammars to yield direct representations of the raw reality of human linguistic behaviour with all its flubs, false starts and lost trains of thought. However, like most linguists who work with GES frameworks, Neeleman almost totally ignores the possibilities of model-theoretic syntax (MTS), and like many I have previously interacted with on this topic, in his response to my article he exploits the competence-performance distinction as a rationale for avoiding the force of my arguments. I do not find such conservatism surprising, but I do find it unfortunate. My article gives an informal survey of what MTS <b>is,</b> and of <b>why</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> it deserves more attention than it has received.

5000|$|Inose’s work {{explores the}} tension between the natural world and its {{grasping}} appropriation by human influence. Inose uses oil painting techniques to create both meticulously realistic landscapes and abstract oil paintings on canvas. His works of art create an inquiry of our relationship and understanding of nature. Inose also creates a debate {{on the role of the}} original masterpieces and how this has changes in the contemporary postmodern world. His home country Japan, which is constantly threatened by natural disasters, is a source of inspiration for his work: [...] "Japan is well-known for its disasters, the country is in fact still recovering from the latest tsunami. Japanese people are always afraid of when the next disaster will strike. This may <b>be</b> the reason <b>why</b> the fantastical <b>is</b> such a popular theme in famous film productions like Godzilla, which is widely thought to be a metaphor for the war. This <b>is</b> the reason <b>why</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> art goes beyond the immortalisation of reality. Art exists to portray a much deeper meaning. This also explains why my own art is a mixture of reality and the fantastic as I use the latter to expose the problems I see around me." ...|$|R
