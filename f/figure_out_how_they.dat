Although Songs of Innocence was still in progress {{at the time and}} did not yet have a title, the autobiographical narrative that would characterise the album was already a driving idea for their tour. The band wanted {{to tell the story of}} their adolescence in Dublin in the 1970s and how they were [...] "trying to <b>figure</b> <b>out</b> <b>how</b> <b>they</b> fit into the often violent and disrupted world outside" [...] their homes. The manifesto for the tour was summarized by two phrases: [...] "I can't change the world, but I can change the world in me", and [...] "I can the change the world, but I can't change the world in me." [...] The first is a lyric from the band's 1981 song [...] "Rejoice" [...] and represents the mindset of a teenage Bono feeling powerless to make a difference in a world plagued by the Troubles, who instead views personal psychological changes as a possibility; the second phrase represents the modern-day realization that the same person could make a difference in the world through philanthropic efforts but still struggle with the complexities of internal change. Devlin said, [...] "The space between these two statements is the territory of the album and of the show." [...] The band intended to stage shows in pairs and alternate the setlist between [...] "innocence" [...] and [...] "experience" [...] motifs night to night. Williams said, [...] "The artfulness in this tour is in the ideas, not the hardware".|$|E

50|$|An {{impediment}} to the large-scale development of airships as heavy haulers has been <b>figuring</b> <b>out</b> <b>how</b> <b>they</b> {{can be used}} in a cost-efficient way. In order to have a significant economic advantage over ocean transport, cargo airships must be able to deliver their payload faster than ocean carriers but more cheaply than airplanes. William Crowder, a fellow at the Logistics Management Institute, has calculated that cargo airships are only economical when they can transport 500 to 1,000 tons, approximately the same as a super-jumbo aircraft. The large initial investment required to build such a large airship has been a hindrance to production, especially given the risk inherent in a new technology. The chief commercial officer of the company hoping to sell the LMH-1, a cargo airship currently being developed by Lockheed Martin, believes that airships can be economical in hard-to-reach locations such as mining operations in northern Canada that currently require ice roads.|$|R

With the help of literature, it defines eight fundamental factors that act to attitude change, and finds examples in environmental education.

40|$|This paper {{approaches}} {{the subject of}} Weather Derivatives, more exactly their basic element the weather index. The weather index has two forms, the Heating Degree Day (HDD) and the Cooling Degree Day (CDD). We will try to explain their origin, use {{and the relationship between}} the two forms of the index. In our research we started from the analysis of the weather derivatives and what they are based on. After finding out about weather index, we were interested in understanding exactly <b>how</b> <b>they</b> work and <b>how</b> <b>they</b> influence the value of the contract. On the national level the research in the field is scares, but foreign materials available. The study for this paper was based firstly on reading about Weather Derivative, and then going in the meteorogical field and determining the way by which the indices were determined. After this, we went to the field with interest in the indices, such as the energy and gas industries, and <b>figured</b> <b>out</b> <b>how</b> <b>they</b> determined the weather index. For the examples we obtained data from the weather index database, and calculated the value for the period. The study is made on a period of five years, in 8 cities of the European Union. The result of this research is that we can now understand better the importance of the way the indices work and <b>how</b> <b>they</b> influence the value of the Weather Derivatives. This research has an implication on the field of insurance, because of the fact that weather derivative are at the convergence point of the stock markets and the insurance market. The originality of the paper comes from the personal touch given to the theoretical aspect and through the analysis of the HDD and CDD index in order to show their general behaviour and relationship.

40|$|Abstract We {{describe}} a generative model for handwritten digits that uses two pairsof opposing springs whose stiffnesses {{are controlled by}} a motor program. We show how neural networks can be trained to infer the motor programsrequired to accurately reconstruct the MNIST digits. The inferred motor programs can be used directly for digit classification, {{but they can also}} beused in other ways. By adding noise to the motor program inferred from an MNIST image we can generate a large set of very different images ofthe same class, thus enlarging the training set available to other methods. We can also use the motor programs as additional, highly informativeoutputs which reduce overfitting when training a feed-forward classifier. 1 Overview The idea that patterns can be recognized by <b>figuring</b> <b>out</b> <b>how</b> <b>they</b> were generated has beenaround for at least half a century [1, 2] {{and one of the first}} proposed applications was the recognition of handwriting using a generative model that involved pairs of opposing springs[3, 4]. The "analysis-by-synthesis " approach is attractive because the true generative model should provide the most natural way to characterize a class of patterns. The handwritten 2 'sin figure 1, for example, are very variable when viewed as pixels but they have very similar motor programs. Despite its obvious merits, analysis-by-synthesis has had few successes,partly because it is computationally expensive to invert non-linear generative models and partly because the underlying parameters of the generative model are unknown for mostlarge data sets. For example, the only source of information about how the MNIST digits were drawn is the images themselves. We {{describe a}} simple generative model in which a pen is controlled by two pairs of op-posing springs whose stiffnesses are specified by a motor program. If the sequence o...|$|R

40|$|This essay {{explores the}} {{challenges}} and the promise offered by the task of translation between Euroamerican and Native cosmologies, ontologies, and worldviews. It traces how insufficient hospitality toward Native cultures and a failure to examine the cosmological presuppositions of the white, Western, secular academy {{have resulted in the}} obfuscation or denigration of Native ways of being and knowing. Attempts to assimilate Native knowledge into Euroamerican concepts of religion, medicine, or culture have fallen short precisely because of the incommensurability of Western disciplinary formations with Native worldviews—worldviews that do not privilege subject-object relations or linear views of time. What is more, the very languages through which Native storytellers and Euroamerican scholars approach one another are freighted with assumptions about the validity of narrative and what makes an utterance “true. ” Since Native ways of being are often expressed through story, Western scholars must interrogate their own assumptions about narrative and adopt, explicitly and self-consciously, a model of scholarship that embraces translation at the level not only of speech but also of ontology. Debating the legitimacy of indigenous ways of knowing is quite a different endeavor than deciding they are legitimate a priori and then <b>figuring</b> <b>out</b> <b>how</b> <b>they</b> relate, or don’t, to modern Western ways of thinking about the world. It is the latter task that remains urgent, in accordance with Sami scholar Rauna Kuokkanen’s ethic of hospitality, which requires a commitment to responsibility and openness toward the “other. ” Her argument is that the Academy “cannot grasp or even hear views that are grounded in other epistemic [knowledge] conventions. ” Furthermore, “Many indigenous people contend that notwithstanding its rhetoric of welcome and hospitality, the academy is not a good host... with only a weak commitment to indigenous people. ” Her proposal is that scholars move beyond deliberating the terms of legitimacy, via comparisons between standards of truth, and instead innovate different philosophical and practical methodologies for regarding indigenous ways of seeing as intellectually and socially valuable. The argument here is that the form of hospitality she is calling for requires a deeper kind of cosmological interrogation by scholars; that is, a self-reflexive endeavor or inquiry into key charter myths and classificatory systems that makes translation between different worldviews possible...|$|R
