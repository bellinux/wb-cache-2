30|$|It {{has been}} {{demonstrated}} that {{the formation of a}} porphyrin/surfactant complex is facilitated primarily by the electrostatic or hydrophobic <b>interactions</b> <b>between</b> these two components [46 – 49]. In the case of ionic porphyrin/nonionic surfactant or nonionic porphyrin/ionic surfactant systems, the hydrophobic <b>interactions</b> <b>between</b> the alkyl chain of the surfactant and the π system of porphyrin play an essential role [32, 46, 47]. In our present case, the employed porphyrin is a nonionic compound. Consequently, the electrostatic <b>interactions</b> <b>between</b> porphyrin and the surfactant are negligible. Thus, we could simply propose that three kinds of intermolecular interactions, i.e., π-π <b>interactions</b> <b>between</b> porphyrin molecules (H 2 TPyP/H 2 TPyP), hydrophobic <b>interactions</b> <b>between</b> porphyrin and CTAB molecules (H 2 TPyP/CTAB), and CTAB/CTAB interactions, compete with each other during the SASA process.|$|R

40|$|<b>Interactions</b> <b>between</b> {{proteins}} are {{a hallmark}} of all cellular activities. Such interactions often occur with low affinity, a feature {{that allows them to}} be rapidly reversible, but it makes them difficult to detect using conventional methods such as yeast 2 -hybrid analyses, co-immunoprecipitation or analytical ultracentrifugation. We developed a simple and economical bead aggregation assay to study low-affinity <b>interactions</b> <b>between</b> proteins. By coating beads with interacting proteins, the weak <b>interactions</b> <b>between</b> many proteins are sufficient to allow stable aggregation of beads, an avidity effect. The aggregation is easily measured to allow quantification of protein-protein interactions under a variety of controlled conditions. We use this assay to demonstrate low-affinity <b>interactions</b> <b>between</b> the N-terminal domains of an intracellular Ca 2 + channel, the type 1 inositol 1, 4, 5 -trisphosphate receptor.
