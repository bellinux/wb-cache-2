25|$|Helen is safely away {{to recover}} from her concussion. Inspector Morton asks each family member to account for {{themselves}} {{on the day of}} Cora Lansquenet's murder after which Poirot makes a surprising statement which shocked everyone present. Cora had not come to the funeral at all. It was Miss Gilchrist in disguise, as part of a plot for her own gain, leaving Cora home asleep from a sedative in her tea. Miss Gilchrist planted the idea that Richard Abernethie's death had been a murder - when Cora is murdered, it would seem that Richard's alleged murderer had killed Cora to silence her. None of the family had seen Cora for more than two decades, due to the ill-feeling {{at the time of her}} marriage. Miss Gilchrist copied her mannerisms and the only flaw in her portrayal was spotted by Helen Abernethie - Miss Gilchrist had rehearsed a characteristic turn of the head in a mirror, where the reflection is a reverse of reality; when she came to the house after the funeral, she turned <b>her</b> <b>head</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> left, not the right. After a timely conversation among the young cousins, Helen realises this difference. Miss Gilchrist gave herself away to Poirot by referring to the wax flowers on the green malachite table the first day the relatives gathered to select objects before the auction: these were on display on the day of the reading of Richard Abernethie's will but removed by the time Miss Gilchrist, as herself, visited Enderby Hall. She had deliberately poisoned herself with the arsenic-laced wedding cake to evade suspicion and appear yet another potential victim, which aroused suspicion.|$|E
500|$|The {{ship was}} armed with four QF 12-pounder 12 cwt guns and two machine guns. Including 60 {{aviation}} personnel, her crew totalled 180 officers and men. [...] "Her truly unique feature was the steadying sail on the mizzen {{to help keep}} <b>her</b> <b>head</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> wind; she remains the only aircraft carrier to have been fitted with a sail." ...|$|E
500|$|A {{music video}} for [...] "I've Got a Feeling" [...] was created with an unknown release date. The video begins with Durand {{walking into a}} futuristic photo booth located in an open space {{surrounded}} by lanterns, while shots of the Ivy members, who are outside of the booth, are displayed. As Durand continues singing, several individuals enter and exit the room while getting their picture taken, each leaving with a CD in their hand. The Smashing Pumpkins guitarist James Iha makes a cameo appearance posing in the booth {{with members of the}} band. Durand sings into a microphone while Chase and Schlesinger play their guitars. For the final verse, Durand lowers <b>her</b> <b>head</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> microphone as the screen fades to black.|$|E
50|$|Lauren Branning, {{played by}} Jacqueline Jossa. Lucy's best friend. Lauren was uncharacteristically happy to dismiss Lucy's {{emotional}} state during their final scene. She stated {{that she went}} to Ronnie and Roxy's housewarming party then returned straight home, but video evidence contradicted her story, showing <b>her</b> <b>heading</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Beale house. Jane provides Lauren with an alibi, revealing that from the Masood house, she saw Lauren arrive and leave the Beale house without entering.|$|R

500|$|For {{the second}} chorus, a new scene of Rihanna is introduced, with Rihanna meeting with her friends, having arrived at her destination, where they eat in {{restaurant}} and {{walk down the}} street. During the bridge, as Rihanna sings about the difficulties of getting over a failed relationship, scenes of Rihanna partying and talking to her ex-boyfriend on her phone are depicted, which results in her agreeing to meet him as she sings [...] "Just blame yourself 'cause you blew it/I won't forget how you do it, my sweet baby/This is where the game ends now/But somehow wanna believe you and me/We can figure it out", as she decides that their relationship is worth salvaging. During the final chorus, the singer is shown intimately dancing and partying with her boyfriend, whilst other scenes from the video are intercut. The video ends with a close-up shot of Rihanna against a white backdrop; when the song's audio finishes, the singer turns <b>her</b> <b>head</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> side and looks into the distance, as the camera pans away.|$|E
2500|$|Inside, First Man {{lay with}} {{his head to the}} East, and First Woman lay with <b>her</b> <b>head</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> West. Their {{thoughts}} mingled, and those thoughts were sacred. They began to plan for the time that was to come, and how people would live on the earth. Great Coyote-Who-Was-Formed-in-the-Water came in to help them plan. Together, they planned {{that there should be a}} sun, a moon, and day and night. [...] They decided to keep the other Coyote, First Angry, away from their planning, because it was he who had brought unhappiness.|$|E

60|$|As {{luck would}} have it, Miss Squeers's friend was of a playful turn, and hearing Nicholas sigh, she took it into <b>her</b> <b>head</b> <b>to</b> rally <b>the</b> lovers on their lowness of spirits.|$|R
60|$|Presently {{the skiff}} put {{out from the}} vessel's side, and the two men, keeping <b>her</b> <b>head</b> well <b>to</b> <b>the</b> wind, pulled lustily for shore. Lawless turned to a loiterer.|$|R

2500|$|Plutarch {{reports the}} {{peculiar}} customs {{associated with the}} Spartan wedding night:The custom was to capture women for marriage(...) The so-called 'bridesmaid' {{took charge of the}} captured girl. [...] She first shaved <b>her</b> <b>head</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> scalp, then dressed her in a man's cloak and sandals, and laid her down alone on a mattress in the dark. [...] The bridegroom – who was not drunk and thus not impotent, but was sober as always – first had dinner in the messes, then would slip in, undo her belt, lift her and carry her to the bed. [...] The husband continued to visit his wife in secret for some time after the marriage. [...] These customs, unique to the Spartans, have been interpreted in various ways. [...] One of them decidedly supports the need to disguise the bride as a man in order to help the bridegroom consummate the marriage, so unaccustomed were men to women's looks {{at the time of their}} first intercourse. The [...] "abduction" [...] may have served to ward off the evil eye, and the cutting of the wife's hair was perhaps part of a rite of passage that signaled her entrance into a new life.|$|E
2500|$|Soon after that, Changing Woman {{wished for}} a mate. Every {{morning when the}} sun rose she {{lay on her back}} until noon, <b>her</b> <b>head</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> west and her feet to the east. [...] At noon she went to the spring. She lay under the ledge and let spring water drip over her body. This took place each day for four days. On the fourth day, she heard a sound behind her and turned and saw a young man on a great white horse with black eyes. It had a long white mane, and pranced above the ground and not on the earth itself. The bridle and the saddle were white. The young man's moccasins and {{leggings}} were also white. The rider spoke: [...] "You lay towards me each morning until noon. When I am half over the center of the earth, you go to the spring. Your wish could not have two meanings. Go home and tell your father to build a brush hogan to the south of your home. Fill a basket with meal and set it in the hogan. Make a line of pollen from east to west across the basket on top of the meal. Make a line of pollen from north to south drawn around the basket. You and your father must sit there late into the night. He will then go home to his wife and you must stay there alone." ...|$|E

[...] The camera crew consisted of 10 to 12 people who filmed the bridge day and night in 2004, using telephoto and wide-angle cameras.|$|R
60|$|The {{dim light}} seemed to {{encourage}} Clara <b>to</b> lift <b>her</b> <b>head</b> <b>to</b> listen <b>to</b> <b>the</b> kind words. 'Was I so very wrong?' she murmured; 'you know I {{never thought of}} that! Will he forgive me, and let me come home? But, oh, granny! and what is to become of my uncle?' she ended, with a sound of misery.|$|R

6000|$|... “Don’t you think, sir,” {{the first}} {{lieutenant}} shouted, “that if we lash a hawser {{to all this}} hamper, and hang to it, it will act as a floating anchor, and bring <b>her</b> <b>head</b> up <b>to</b> <b>the</b> wind?” ...|$|R

50|$|Images of Raet are rare. When she is depicted, she {{is shown}} {{as a woman}} with cow horns holding a sun disk on <b>her</b> <b>head,</b> similar <b>to</b> <b>the</b> headdress of Hathor. The headdress is adorned with a uraeus or with feathers.|$|R
6000|$|... "And, oh, Trichy! {{you don't}} {{mean to say}} I mayn't speak out before you. There, perhaps you'd like to put your foot on my neck." [...] And then she put <b>her</b> <b>head</b> down <b>to</b> <b>the</b> {{footstool}} and kissed Beatrice's feet.|$|R
