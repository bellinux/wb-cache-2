5|$|Like ale, aloviti men led hail-producing and {{thunderstorm}} clouds: {{when the}} skies darkened, {{such a man}} would fall into a trance, and <b>his</b> <b>spirit</b> would fly out of his body toward the clouds as if <b>his</b> <b>spirit</b> were an ala herself. There was, however, a significant difference– he never led the clouds over the fields of his own village; the damage was done to the neighboring villages. In this respect, aloviti men are equivalent to zduhaći. Besides leading clouds away, an aloviti man could also fight against ale to protect his village. Children, too, could be aloviti, and they fought ale using plough beams. In these fights they were helped by the Aesculapian snake (smuk in Serbian), {{and for this reason}} people would not hurt these snakes.|$|E

Banquo's ability to live on in different ways is another oppositional force, in this case to Macbeth's impending death. <b>His</b> <b>spirit</b> lives on in Fleance, his son, and in his ghostly presence at the banquet.|$|E
5|$|Caligula's {{religious}} {{policy was}} {{a departure from}} that of his predecessors. According to Cassius Dio, living emperors could be worshipped as divine {{in the east and}} dead emperors could be worshipped as divine in Rome. Augustus had the public worship <b>his</b> <b>spirit</b> on occasion, but Dio describes this as an extreme act that emperors generally shied away from. Caligula took things a step further and had those in Rome, including senators, worship him as a tangible, living god.|$|E
5|$|In Christian theology, {{the work}} of the Holy Spirit under the Old Covenant is viewed as less {{extensive}} than that under the New Covenant inaugurated on the day of Pentecost. The Spirit was restricted to certain chosen individuals, such as high priests and prophets. Often termed the “spirit of prophecy” in rabbinic writings, the Holy Spirit was closely associated with prophecy and divine inspiration. It was anticipated that in the future messianic age God would pour out <b>his</b> <b>spirit</b> upon all of Israel, which would become a nation of prophets.|$|E

5|$|Making a final {{stand against}} Kefka, the {{characters}} destroy him, {{but since the}} gods' power had come to reside in him all magicite begins to shatter and Kefka's magically-maintained tower begins to crumble. The Returners make their escape, though if Terra is present, she begins to weaken due to her half-esper heritage. However, before her father's magicite shatters, <b>his</b> <b>spirit</b> informs her that by holding to the human side of herself, she may survive the passing of magic. In the end, the party escapes Kefka's Tower aboard the Falcon. Terra survives, and the group observes the world's communities rejuvenating themselves.|$|E

5|$|Ale can be {{defeated}} by zmajeviti men, {{who have a}} human mother, but a dragon father. They look like ordinary people except for little wings beneath their armpits; such men are always born at night after a twelve-month term. Much like a zduhać, a zmajeviti man lives like everybody else {{when the weather is}} nice, but when an ala leads threatening clouds into sight, he falls into a trance and <b>his</b> <b>spirit</b> comes out of his body and flies up to the clouds to fight with the ala, just like a dragon would do. A story from Banat, which was held as true until the 1950s, says that before World War I, an exhausted ala {{in the form of a}} giant snake fell from the clouds onto a road. The explanation of the event was that the ala was defeated in her fight with a zmajeviti man; people gave her milk to help her recover.|$|E
5|$|Knights of the Nines quest {{begins as}} the player {{approaches}} the Chapel of Dibella in Anvil. The Chapel was recently abused; everyone {{there has been}} killed in a dark ritual. The player proceeds to consult a prophet near the scene of the attack, who is preaching about it. The prophet reveals to the player that the one responsible for the attacks is Umaril, an ancient revenge-seeking Ayleid sorcerer-king, who has escaped from his prison in Oblivion to destroy Cyrodiil. Umaril can only be defeated by the prophesized Crusader, favoured by the gods, bearing the relics of Pelinal Whitestrake, the man who originally slew Umaril, and banished <b>his</b> <b>spirit</b> to Oblivion.|$|E
5|$|Moelia and {{his family}} depart for Ciwalirang the {{following}} morning, hoping that Noesa Brama will consent to the marriage of Moelia and Retna Sari. The priest accepts the proposal, but expresses regret over {{the destruction of the}} statue after he discovers that Retna Sari and Soerijati had not gone willingly with the men from Palembang. He weds Moelia and Retna Sari and has them promise that their first son will be raised a Hindu and become king of the Baduy; he then surrenders all his power to his daughter. Later, hoping that <b>his</b> <b>spirit</b> and those of his ancestors can control the volcano, Noesa Brama secretly commits suicide by jumping into the well. Several weeks later, activity at the volcano drops, although it remains active.|$|E

5|$|Palpatine's {{ultimate}} fate {{is further}} chronicled in the Dark Empire II and Empire's End series of comics. The Dark Empire II series, published from 1994 to 1995, details how the Emperor {{is once again}} reborn on Byss into a clone body. Palpatine tries to rebuild the Empire as the Rebel Alliance grows weak. In Empire's End (1995), a traitorous Imperial guard bribes Palpatine's cloning supervisor to tamper with the Emperor's stored DNA samples. This causes the clones to deteriorate at a rapid rate. Palpatine tries to possess the body of Anakin Solo, the infant son of Leia Organa and Han Solo, before the clone body dies, but is thwarted once again by Luke Skywalker. Palpatine is killed by a blaster shot fired by Han, but <b>his</b> <b>spirit</b> is captured by the mortally-wounded Jedi Empatojayos Brand. When Brand dies, he takes Palpatine's spirit with him, destroying the Sith Lord once and for all.|$|E

Riku then arrives at a digital version of the Destiny Islands, where he meets a virtual copy of Ansem the Wise. Ansem assures that Sora is now awake, and gives Riku his research data he had left in Sora's heart to help Sora save those connected to his heart. Upon returning {{to the realm of}} light, Riku is declared a Keyblade Master by Yen Sid for braving the realm of sleep a second time to reawaken Sora; Lea also reveals himself to have become a Keyblade wielder, and intends to become a Master as well. Sora is undaunted by his failure and returns to the sleeping worlds, where he thanks <b>his</b> <b>Spirit</b> Dream Eater companions.|$|E
5|$|Swannell {{returned}} to Britain with the touring team, and was reselected for the 1904 tour, this time taking in Australia and New Zealand. Swannell played in 15 games, including all four Test Matches, three against Australia {{and the final}} Test against New Zealand. In the third Test, Swannell scored his first and only international points, a try against Australia in Sydney. The British Isles were victorious over the Australians, but lost the New Zealand match, {{this was the first}} international game that Swannell had been on the losing side. In the New Zealand clash, Swannell's violent playing style, was targeted by countering with equally rough play.

5|$|The {{ideology}} {{surrounding the}} living king was also {{affected by the}} Osiris myth. The Egyptians envisioned {{the events of the}} Osiris myth as taking place sometime in Egypt's dim prehistory, and Osiris, Horus, and their divine predecessors were included in Egyptian lists of past kings such as the Turin Royal Canon. Horus, as a primeval king and as the personification of kingship, was regarded as the predecessor and exemplar for all Egyptian rulers. His assumption of his father's throne and pious actions to sustain <b>his</b> <b>spirit</b> in the afterlife were the model for all pharaonic successions to emulate. Each new king was believed to renew maat after the death of the preceding king, just as Horus had done. In royal coronations, rituals alluded to Osiris's burial, and hymns celebrated the new king's accession as the equivalent of Horus's own.|$|E
5|$|While in Mexico, Cameron began {{performing}} blood rituals in {{the hope}} of communicating with Parsons' spirit; during these, she cut her own wrists. As part of these rituals, she claimed to have received a new magical identity, Hilarion. When she learned that an unidentified flying object had been seen over Washington D.C.'s Capitol Building she considered it a response to Parsons' death. After two months, she returned to California and attempted suicide. Increasingly interested in occultism, she read through her husband's papers. Embracing his Thelemic beliefs, she came to understand his purpose in carrying out the Babalon Working and also came to believe that the spirit of Babalon had been incarnated into herself. She came to believe that Parsons had been murdered by the police or anti-zionists, and continued her attempts at astral projection to commune with <b>his</b> <b>spirit.</b>|$|E
5|$|In Act I, the Shard-bearer's story resumes {{after the}} defeat of the King of Shadows. The player awakens alone in an {{underground}} barrow in Rashemen, where he meets Safiya, a Red Wizard of Thay. The player follows Safiya to the Veil Theater in the nearby town of Mulsantir, hoping to find Lienna, an acquaintance of Safiya’s mother, who is supposed to provide the player with some much-needed answers. Unfortunately, the player finds that the theater has been attacked by Red Wizards, and Lienna has been killed. At the back of the theater, the player finds a portal to the Plane of Shadow, a dark reflection of the Prime Material Plane, where he defeats the Red Wizards who murdered Lienna. Upon returning to the Prime Material Plane, the player finds that the spirit-god Okku has besieged Mulsantir, demanding the player’s blood. The player confronts Okku and defeats <b>his</b> <b>spirit</b> army. At the end of the battle, the player learns that he has become a spirit-eater, an accursed being who must feed upon feys and elementals (and sometimes mortal souls) in order to survive.|$|E
