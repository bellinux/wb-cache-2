5|$|The {{tree sparrow}} is a {{predominantly}} seed and grain eating bird which feeds {{on the ground}} in flocks, often with house sparrows, finches, or buntings. It eats weed seeds, such as chickweeds and <b>goosefoot,</b> spilled grain, and it may also visit feeding stations, especially for peanuts. It will also feed on invertebrates, especially during the breeding season when the young are fed mainly on animal food; it takes insects, woodlice, millipedes, centipedes, spiders and harvestmen.|$|E
5|$|Mesa Verdeans {{supplemented}} {{their diet}} by gathering {{the seeds and}} fruits of wild plants, searching large expanses of land while procuring these resources. Depending on the season, they collected piñon nuts and juniper berries, weedy <b>goosefoot,</b> pigweed, purslane, tomatillo, tansy mustard, globe mallow, sunflower seeds, and yucca, as well as various species of grass and cacti. Prickly pear fruits provided a rare source of natural sugar. Wild seeds were cooked and ground up into porridge. They used sagebrush and mountain mahogany, along with piñon and juniper, for firewood. They also smoked wild tobacco. Because the Ancestral Puebloans considered all material consumed and discarded by their communities as sacred, their midden piles were viewed with reverence. Starting during the Basketmaker III period, , Mesa Verdeans often buried their dead in these mounds.|$|E
5|$|The white-winged fairywren is {{primarily}} insectivorous; its diet includes small beetles, bugs, moths, praying mantises, caterpillars, and smaller insects, including spiders. The larger insects are typically fed to nestlings by the breeding female and her helpers, including the breeding male. Adults and juveniles forage by hopping along the shrubland floor, and may supplement their diets with seeds and fruits of saltbush (Rhagodia), <b>goosefoot</b> (Chenopodium) and new shoots of samphire. During spring and summer, birds {{are active in}} bursts through the day and accompany their foraging with song. Insects are numerous and easy to catch, which allows the birds to rest between forays. The group often shelters and rests together during {{the heat of the}} day. Food is harder to find during winter and they are required to spend the day foraging continuously.|$|E
5000|$|Local {{animals of}} use to prehistoric human populations, when the site was occupied, including: jackrabbits, cottontails, rats, mice, roadrunners, doves, hawks, and various reptiles. The animals found in the higher {{elevations}} included: bear, elk, black bear, grizzly bear, wolf, rattlesnake, golden eagle. [...] They also gathered or cultivated maize, common bean, squash, <b>goosefeet,</b> pigweed, sunflower, walnut, and pinon nuts.|$|R
50|$|The larvae are polyphagous, {{feeding on}} various {{herbaceous}} plants, mainly on mallow (Malva species), common marshmallow (Althaea officinalis), field bindweed (Convolvulus arvensis), <b>goosefoots</b> (Chenopodium) and dandelion (Taraxacum). Adults {{are on the}} wing on sunny days in May and August in two generations. They are attracted to light. This species overwinters as pupa below ground. Rarely it is a migrant species.|$|R
50|$|Chenopodium is a genus of {{numerous}} species of perennial or annual herbaceous flowering plants {{known as the}} <b>goosefoots,</b> which occur almost anywhere in the world. It {{is placed in the}} family Amaranthaceae in the APG II system; older classification systems, notably the widely used Cronquist system, separate it and its relatives as Chenopodiaceae, but this leaves the rest of the Amaranthaceae polyphyletic. However, among the Amaranthaceae, the genus Chenopodium is the namesake member of the subfamily Chenopodioideae.|$|R
25|$|Other {{plants of}} the EAC include little barley (Hordeum pusillum), <b>goosefoot</b> or lambsquarters (Chenopodium berlandieri), erect {{knotweed}} (Polygonum erectum), maygrass (Phalaris caroliniana), sumpweed or marsh elder (Iva annua), and sunflower (Helianthus annuus).|$|E
25|$|The initial four plants {{known to}} have been domesticated were <b>goosefoot</b> (Chenopodium berlandieri), {{sunflower}} (Helianthus annuus var. macroscarpus), marshelder (Iva annua var. macrocarpa), and squash (Cucurbita pepo ssp. ovifera). Several other species of plants were later domesticated.|$|E
25|$|Amaranthaceae is {{a family}} of {{flowering}} plants {{commonly known as the}} amaranth family. It now includes the former <b>goosefoot</b> family Chenopodiaceae and contains about 165 genera and 2,040 species, making it the most species-rich lineage within its parent order, Caryophyllales.|$|E
50|$|In spring, {{during the}} {{breeding}} season, {{they are found}} in coniferous forests. At this time their feeding {{is based on the}} seeds of these trees, especially on trees belonging to the genera Abies, Picea and Larix. They also feed on elms and poplars. When feeding the young they eat more insects, mainly beetles, as the proteins they contain help the chicks to grow. In summer their feeding is more varied, adding other herbaceous plants to their diet of conifer seeds: <b>goosefoots</b> and other Compositae.|$|R
25|$|Seventeen {{vegetation}} {{classes have}} been identified in the Yanga National Park, with more than 300 plant species being recorded. River red gum forest/woodland, black box woodland, lignum/nitre <b>goosefoot</b> (Chenopodium nitrariaceum) shrubland, and spike rush (Eleocharis spp.) dominated sedgeland are identified as important vegetation classes in the area.|$|E
25|$|Some seeds {{usually made}} into gruel in {{historical}} times are acorn and manna grass (Glyceria fluitans). Roots {{of the sea}} beet, Beta maritima, were prepared as well. That species is ancestral to modern domestic beets. Greens could have been boiled from nettle (Urtica dioica), orache (Atriplex) and <b>goosefoot</b> (Chenopodium album).|$|E
25|$|<b>Goosefoot,</b> also {{referred}} to as Chenopodium, is a small flowering plant with edible seeds that may have been cultivated in small gardens. The evidence for this is uncertain, however. This also leads to an uncertainty in the timeframe of the suspected cultivation (believed to be during Archaic or Woodland periods).|$|E
25|$|Adena {{crops are}} part of the Eastern Agricultural Complex. They grew squash, {{sunflower}} (Helianthus annuus), sumpweed, <b>goosefoot,</b> knotweed, and maygrass. Gourds were grown for containers and rattles. What might be a small bird pen found at one Adena site suggests limited animal domestication, but Adena people are not known for animal husbandry.|$|E
25|$|By 1800 BC, Indians were {{cultivating}} {{several different}} plants. The Riverton Site in the Wabash River valley of Illinois, near {{the present day}} village of Palestine, {{is one of the}} best known early sites of cultivation. Ten house sites have been discovered at Riverton, indicating a population of 50 to 100 people in the community. Among the hearths and storage pits associated with the houses, archaeologists found a large number of plant remains, including a large number of seeds of chenopods (<b>goosefoot</b> or lamb's quarters) which are likely cultivated plants. Some of the chenopod (Chenopodium berlandieri) seeds had husks only one third as thick as wild seeds. Riverton farmers had bred them selectively to produce a seed easier to access than wild varieties of the same plant.|$|E
25|$|Maize (corn), {{beans and}} squash {{were among the}} {{earliest}} crops domesticated in Mesoamerica, with maize beginning about 7500 BC, squash, as early as 8000 to 6000 BC and beans by no later than 4000 BC. Potatoes and manioc were domesticated in South America. In {{what is now the}} eastern United States, Native Americans domesticated sunflower, sumpweed and <b>goosefoot</b> around 2500 BC. At Guilá Naquitz cave in the Mexican highlands, fragments of maize pollen, bottle gourd and pepo squash were recovered and variously dated between 8000 and 7000 BC. In this area of the world people relied on hunting and gathering for several millennia to come. Sedentary village life based on farming did not develop until the second millennium BC, referred to as the formative period.|$|E
500|$|A. brownii has a {{very limited}} range; it is found only on the [...] island of Nihoa, located [...] {{northwest}} of Kauai. It is thought that this endemic plant has probably always been rare and restricted to Nihoa. Its habitat is managed by the United States Fish and Wildlife Service and protected {{as part of the}} Hawaiian Islands National Wildlife Refuge in the Papahānaumokuākea Marine National Monument. A. brownii is one of three endemic and endangered species only found on Nihoa, along with the Nihoa fan palm (Pritchardia remota) and the Nihoa carnation (Schiedea verticillata). At least nine other native plant species can be found in its habitat, including Hawaiian <b>goosefoot</b> (Chenopodium oahuense), lovegrass (Eragrostis variablis), koali awa (Ipomoea indica), goat's foot (Ipomoea pes-caprae subsp. brasiliensis), Panicum torridum, naupakas (Scaevola sericea), Sicyos pachycarpus, ilima (Sida fallax), and Nelson's horsenettle (Solanum nelsonii).|$|E
500|$|The Late Woodland Period {{was once}} {{considered}} to be relatively unimportant and uninteresting compared to earlier and later periods, but recent research shows unexpected cultural complexity. Late Woodland sites are more dispersed than Middle Woodland sites, but they are apparently more numerous. Gone are the complex earthworks and long-distance trade networks, {{but this does not}} appear to be a cultural collapse, since Late Woodland sites and artifact types overlap with and transition from Middle Woodland sites. [...] Technical changes of the Late Woodland include the use of true arrow heads, thinner and larger ceramics with less elaborate decorations, and the adaptation of new crops, including maize. Numerous regional variations and phases have been defined in Iowa, based in large extent on differences of ceramic form and decoration. Excavations at Late Woodland sites are common, some of these sites showing surprising complexity. The Gast Farm Site excavations revealed a complex settlement associated with a midden of refuse 100 m in diameter. Large storage and food processing pits, trash middens, and other features were excavated. Occupants utilized acorns, other nuts and fruits, <b>goosefoot,</b> little barley, maygrass, sunflower, fish, birds, deer, muskrat, and turtle. There was little evidence of long-distance trade. [...] The Rainbow and M.A.D. sites provide a glimpse into the Late Archaic of western Iowa. At Rainbow, a large house was excavated, showing evidence of reuse and possible joint occupation by two families. Mound building became more common during the Late Woodland Period, large groups of mounds appeared including the Slinde Mound Group, and the Fish Farm Mound Group.|$|E
2500|$|Foraging of {{wild plants}} for food was [...] {{probably}} {{important for the}} Antelope Creek People, particularly because agriculture in the drought-prone panhandle was always hazardous and the abundance of bison varied from season to season and year to year. [...] Among the wild foods eaten were acorns, hackberries, mesquite, buckwheat, plums, persimmons, prickly pear, mallow, cattail, purslane, <b>goosefoot,</b> knotweed, domesticated marshelder, and bulrush.|$|E
2500|$|The {{plants are}} often divided into [...] "oily" [...] or [...] "starchy" [...] categories. Sunflower and sumpweed have edible seeds rich in oil. Erect {{knotweed}} and <b>goosefoot,</b> a leafy vegetable, are starches, as are maygrass and little barley, {{both of which}} are grasses that yield grains that may be ground to make flour. (Note that erect knotweed is a distinct species from the Japanese knotweed (Polygonum cuspidatum) that is considered an invasive species in the eastern United States today.) ...|$|E
2500|$|... 'Fairchance Mound and Village' of Marshall County, West Virginia is a Middle Woodland complex. The mound {{artifacts}} carbon {{dates to}} the 3rd century CE. One of the tombs in the mound is unique in being a stone lined crypt. This [...] "crypt" [...] was simply a layer of [...] "slab-stone" [...] covering the mound with more dirt placed over the [...] "sheets" [...] of stone. This was not [...] a [...] "boxed-in crypt." [...] This {{should not be confused}} with the centuries later Hadden Phase (1100–1600 CE) Hadden site (15To1) mortuaray complex (Allen 1977:14) stone box grave and stone slab-lined crematory cist of the Kentucky Western Coal Fields Section. The Fairchance village pottery included Watson Ware that was lime stone tempered. The stone points were Fairchance-notched and Snyders points. The foods found through screening were the semi-domesticated [...] "wild plants" [...] listed in the summary below for this period. The nearby Watson Farm village dated between 1600 and 1400 BP and its small, one-meter high mound also contained a stone crypt. The limestone tempered Watson Ware along with a limited amount of grit-tempered Mahoning Ware was found. Flotation samples were performed at this site, but, these have not been analyzed by botanical specialists. Either wild or domesticated Chenopodium, <b>goosefoot,</b> was found. These Middle Woodland people subsisted primarily on wild plants, animals, fish, and shellfish. Each site had a single circular structure found, which may be due to limited excavation.|$|E
2500|$|The {{introduction}} of pottery, its widespread use, {{and the increased}} sophistication of its forms and decoration, first believed to have occurred around 1,000 BCE, is a major demarcation of the Woodland era. Archaic pots were thick, heavy, and fragile, but Woodland pottery pots were more intricately designed, and had more uses, such as for cooking and storing surplus food. Woodland peoples also used baskets and gourds for containers too. Around 200BCE, maize production migrated to the eastern United States from Mexico. The {{introduction of}} corn is when Kentucky natives slowly changed from growing indigenous plants to a maize based agricultural economy. In addition to cultivating corn, the Woodland people also cultivated giant ragweeds, amaranth (pigweed), and maygrass. The initial four plants {{known to have been}} domesticated were <b>goosefoot</b> (Chenopodium berlandieri), sunflower (Helianthus annuus var. macroscarpus), marshelder (Iva annua var. macrocarpa), and squash (Cucurbita pepo ssp. ovifera) (gourds). Woodland people raised tobacco in their gardens which they used for smoking. Woodland people still used ground stone tools, especially for processing nuts and seeds. They mined both Mammoth Cave and Salts Cave for gypsum and mirabilite, a salty seasoning. Shellfish was still an important part of their diets, and the most common prey was white-tailed deer. Spears also continued to be made, but late in the Woodland era, the straight bow became the typical weapon of choice in the eastern United States, which is illustrated by the reduction in size of arrowheads. In addition to bows and arrows, some southeastern Woodland peoples also used blowguns. Between 100 BCE and 450BC, the native Americans in Kentucky begin to build burial mounds, which indicates social change. The Woodland Indians buried their dead in conical, and then later flat, or oval-shaped, burial mounds, which were often [...] high (like Serpent Mound). This practice resulted in the Woodland people being called the Mound Builders by 19th-century observers.|$|E
6000|$|Singularly enough, England's {{claim to}} the venerable old lady is of about the same date as Boston's. There lived in a town in Sussex, about the year 1704, an old woman named Martha Gooch. She was a capital nurse, and in great demand to care for newly-born babies; therefore, through long years of service as nurse, she {{came to be called}} Mother Gooch. This good woman had one peculiarity: she was {{accustomed}} to croon queer rhymes and jingles over the cradles of her charges, and these rhymes [...] "seemed so senseless and silly to the people who overheard them" [...] that they began to call her [...] "Mother Goose," [...] in derision, the term being derived from Queen <b>Goosefoot,</b> the mother of Charlemagne. The old nurse paid no attention to her critics, but continued to sing her rhymes as before; for, however much grown people might laugh at her, the children seemed to enjoy them very much, and not one of them was too peevish to be quieted and soothed by her verses. At one time Mistress Gooch was nursing a child of Mr. Ronald Barclay, a physician residing in the town, and he noticed the rhymes she sang and became interested in them. In time he wrote them all down and made a book of them, which it is said was printed by John Worthington & Son in the Strand, London, in 1712, under the name of [...] "Ye Melodious Rhymes of Mother Goose." [...] But even this story of Martha Gooch is based upon very meager and unsatisfactory evidence.|$|E
