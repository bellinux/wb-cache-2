40|$|A {{prototype}} <b>intermittent</b> <b>smoke</b> flow visualization {{system for}} studying the flowfield of an aircraft in flight has been constructed and demonstrated. It provides discrete pulses of dense white smoke suitable for video imaging to determine the unsteady vortex core trajectory of fluid elements in a high angle-of-attack flowfield. Two methods of pulsing the smoke were initially investigated: (1) periodically diverting the smoke between two exit ports and (2) completely blocking the smoke flow for short times. System dynamics have been modeled mathematically, data have been collected in a wind tunnel with blockage times up to 80 milliseconds, and the prototype is currently being flown on a general aviation airplane to collect three-dimensional video data. Three different plenum chamber sizes are available. Data collected so far are consistent and repeatable, though {{care must be taken}} to provide adequate contrast levels for accurate video resolution. Camera frame rates of at least 180 frames/second and wide angle lenses for the video cameras are needed to acquire meaningful vortex core velocities and accelerations for the general aviation test aircraft installation...|$|E
