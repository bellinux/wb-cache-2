5|$|DJ Hero is {{a rhythm}} video {{game and a}} {{spin-off}} of the Guitar Hero series. The game was developed by FreeStyleGames and published by Activision worldwide in October 2009 for the PlayStation 2 and 3, Wii, and Xbox 360 consoles. The game is based on turntablism, requiring {{the use of a}} special game controller that includes a turntable surface with three buttons, a crossfader bar, and an effects dial, in addition to other controller buttons used to manipulate in-game menus. In a manner similar to Guitar Hero, players use the turntable controller to mimic the actions of a disc jockey (DJ), such as scratching and crossfading between two different songs, as graphical representations of these actions scroll down on screen towards the player in time with the music. Unlike previous Guitar Hero games, there is no performance meter, and instead players are simply challenged to obtain the best score possible in order to earn stars (from zero to five for each mix) to unlock new songs, venues, and characters. The player can attempt these songs at one of four difficulties (Easy to <b>Expert),</b> <b>with</b> higher difficulties providing more actions for the player to perform within the song.|$|E
5|$|The {{diagnostic}} {{complexities of}} RAD mean that careful diagnostic evaluation by a trained mental health <b>expert</b> <b>with</b> particular expertise in differential diagnosis is considered essential. Several other disorders, such as conduct disorders, oppositional defiant disorder, anxiety disorders, post traumatic stress disorder and social phobia share many symptoms {{and are often}} comorbid with or confused with RAD, leading to over and under diagnosis. RAD can also be confused with neuropsychiatric disorders such as autism, pervasive developmental disorder, childhood schizophrenia and some genetic syndromes. Infants with this disorder can be distinguished from those with organic illness by their rapid physical improvement after hospitalization. Autistic children {{are likely to be}} of normal size and weight and often exhibit a degree of intellectual disability. They are unlikely to improve upon being removed from the home.|$|E
5|$|Wave Race 64 is {{a racing}} {{game in which}} players race on Jet Skis in {{different}} weather conditions and {{on a variety of}} courses. The game features three single-player modes (Championship, Time Trials, and Stunt Mode) as well as a multiplayer mode for competitive play. In the Championship mode, the player must race opponents through a series of courses and win the first place. Up to four levels of difficulty can be chosen: Normal, Hard, Expert and Reverse, the latter being <b>Expert</b> <b>with</b> the tracks oriented backwards. Hard, Expert, and Reverse must be unlocked by completing an earlier difficulty. The difficulty also determines the number of courses played: six in Normal, seven in Hard, and eight in Expert/Reverse. When the player completes a course, points are awarded based on the rank they finished. If the required quantity is not met, the player will be disqualified and the game will be over.|$|E

Some of his writings in the press have been compiled and published in two volumes.|$|E
25|$|Two other {{personal}} characteristics that influenced his fiction were his expertise in martial arts and his addiction to tobacco. Zelazny became <b>expert</b> <b>with</b> the épée in college, and thus began a lifelong study of several different martial arts, including karate, judo, aikido (which he later taught as well, having gained a black belt), t'ai chi, taekwondo, hapkido, Hsing I, and pa kua. In turn, {{many of his}} characters ably and knowledgeably use similar skills whilst dispatching their opponents. Zelazny was also a passionate cigarette and pipe smoker (until he quit in the early '80s), so much so, that he made many of his protagonists heavy smokers as well. However, he quit {{in order to improve}} his cardiovascular fitness for the martial arts; once he had quit, characters in his later novels and short stories stopped smoking too.|$|E

25|$|Mixing {{deduction}} and character-driven drama, CSI: Crime Scene Investigation {{follows a}} team of crime-scene investigators, employed by the Las Vegas Police Department, as they use physical evidence to solve murders. The team is originally led by Gil Grissom (William Petersen), a socially awkward forensic entomologist and career criminalist who is promoted to CSI supervisor {{following the death of}} a trainee investigator. Grissom's second-in-command, Catherine Willows (Marg Helgenberger), is a single mother with a cop's instinct. Born and raised in Vegas, Catherine was a stripper before being recruited into law enforcement and training as a blood-spatter specialist. Following Grissom's departure during the ninth season of the series, Catherine is promoted to supervisor. After overseeing the training of new investigator Raymond Langston (Laurence Fishburne), Willows is replaced by D.B. Russell (Ted Danson), and recruited to the FBI shortly thereafter. Russell is a family man, a keen forensic botanist and a veteran of the Seattle Crime Lab. In the series' 12th season, Russell is reunited with his former partner Julie Finlay (Elisabeth Shue), who like Catherine, is a blood-spatter <b>expert</b> <b>with</b> an extensive knowledge of criminal psychology. Together {{with the rest of the}} team, they work together to tackle Las Vegas' growing crime rate and are on the case 24/7, scouring the scene, collecting the evidence, and finding the missing pieces that will solve the mystery.|$|E

500|$|After Wyatt Earp {{first arrived}} in Tombstone, his {{business}} efforts yielded little profit, {{and he took a}} job as a stagecoach shotgun messenger for Wells Fargo, guarding shipments of silver bullion. On July 28, 1880 Wyatt was appointed Pima County Deputy Sheriff. He held this position for only three months until after the election of November 9, 1880, when he resigned. When Virgil was maimed by an assassination attempt, Wyatt was appointed Deputy U.S. Marshal in his place. He held that position until he left Cochise County in April 1882. Wyatt Earp was an imposing, handsome man: blond, [...] tall, weighing about , broad-shouldered, long-armed, and muscular. He had been a boxer and was reputed to be an <b>expert</b> <b>with</b> a pistol. According to author Leo Silva, Earp showed no fear of any man.|$|E
