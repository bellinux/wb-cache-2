Multiple back-lit windows are provided, each engraved {{with the name of}} a process <b>alarm.</b> <b>Lamps</b> in each window are controlled by hard-wired switches in the plant, arranged to operate when a process condition enters an abnormal state (such as high temperature, low pressure, loss of cooling water flow, or many others). Single point or multipoint alarm logic modules operate the window lights based on a preselected ISA 18.1 or custom sequence.|$|R

40|$|The current {{consumption}} method of Electric Power Industry is “electricity consumption first, {{paying for it}} later”. The trend of consumption method is Pre-order Electricity. If we adopt the Pre-order Electricity System, we need to replace Traditional Energy Meter with Prepayment Energy Meter. But this alteration is costly.

In this paper, we present the design of Multi-user Electric Power Management Device. The device uses TMS 320 F 2812 as CPU, with peripheral devices such as mobile phone communication module MC 55, so the device supports remote operation and sends alarm information via SMS, it also can communicate with the master station by GPRS. The device can be seamlessly integrated into the existing power system in order to read meter, achieve billing and Pre-order Electricity functions.

40|$|Vibration comfort is an {{important}} factor affecting the quality of service (QoS) of bus. In order to make people involved in supervising bus’s vibration comfort and improve passengers’ riding experience, a novel mode of passenger crowdsourcing is introduced. In this paper, comfort degree of bus vibration is calculated from bus’s vibration signals collected by passengers’ smartphones and sent through WiFi to the Boa web server which shows the vibration comfort on the LCD deployed in bus and maybe trigger <b>alarm</b> <b>lamp</b> when the vibration is beyond the threshold. Three challenges here have been overcome: firstly, space coordinate transformation algorithm is used to solve the constant drift of signals collected; secondly, a low-pass filter is designed to isolate gravity from signals real-timely via limited computing resources; thirdly, an embedded evaluation system is developed according to the calculation procedure specified by criterion ISO 2631 - 1997. Meanwhile, the model proposed is tested in a practical running environment, the vibration data in whole travel are recorded and analyzed offline. The results show that comfort degree of vibration obtained from the experimental system is identical with the truth, and this mode is proved to be effective...|$|R

40|$|Attention can {{be focused}} volitionally by “top-down ” signals derived from task demands and {{automatically}} by “bottom-up ” signals from salient stimuli. The frontal and parietal cortices are involved, but their neural activity {{has not been}} directly compared. Therefore, we recorded from them simultaneously in monkeys. Prefrontal neurons reflected the target location first during top-down attention, whereas parietal neurons signaled it earlier during bottom-up attention. Synchrony between frontal and parietal areas was stronger in lower frequencies during top-down attention and in higher frequencies during bottom-up attention. This result indicates that top-down and bottom-up signals arise from the frontal and sensory cortex, respectively, and different modes of attention may emphasize synchrony at different frequencies. Volitional shifts of attention are thoughtto depend on “top-down ” signals de-rived from knowledge about the cur-rent task (e. g., finding your lost keys), whereas the automatic “bottom-up ” capture of attention is driven by properties inherent in stimuli— that is, by salience (e. g., a <b>flashing</b> fire <b>alarm)</b> (1 – 3).

60|$|It {{was still}} later when, {{exhausted}} by the heat and some reaction from {{the excitement of the}} day, they at last deserted the veranda for their rooms, and for a while the shadowy bulk of the whole building was picked out with regularly spaced lights from its open windows, until now these finally faded and went out one by one. An hour later the whole building had sunk to rest. It was said that it was only four in the morning when a yawning porter, having put out the light in a dark, upper corridor, was amazed by a dull glow {{from the top of the}} wall, and awoke to the fact that a red fire, as yet smokeless and flameless, was creeping along the cornice. He ran to the office and gave the alarm; but on returning with assistance was stopped in the corridor by an impenetrable wall of smoke veined with murky <b>flashes.</b> The <b>alarm</b> was given in all the lower floors, and the occupants rushed from their beds half dressed to the courtyard, only to see, as they afterwards averred, the flames burst like cannon discharges from the upper windows and unite above the crackling roof. So sudden and complete was the catastrophe, although slowly prepared by a leak in the overheated chimney between the floors, that even the excitement of fear and exertion was spared the survivors. There was bewilderment and stupor, but neither uproar nor confusion. People found themselves wandering in the woods, half awake and half dressed, having descended from the balconies and leaped from the windows,--they knew not how. Others on the upper floor neither awoke nor moved from their beds, but were suffocated without a cry. From the first an instinctive idea of the hopelessness of combating the conflagration possessed them all; to a blind, automatic feeling to flee the building was added the slow mechanism of the somnambulist; delicate women walked speechlessly, but securely, along ledges and roofs from which they would have fallen by the mere light of reason and of day. There was no crowding or impeding haste in their dumb exodus. It was only when Mrs. Barker awoke disheveled in the courtyard, and with an hysterical outcry rushed back into the hotel, that there was any sign of panic.|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} I will {{describe}} {{an epidemic of}} a koro-like syndrome that occurred in Nigeria between {{the last week of}} October and the first week of November 1990. This epidemic occurred in a setting of severe economic depression amidst speculation about currency change and elections. In contrast to classical descriptions of koro, however, in the Nigerian epidemic, afflicted men claimed that their external genitalia had simply vanished. The onset involved a characteristic march of features: cue, <b>flash,</b> check and <b>alarm.</b> The cue was usually a touch, a verbal or written inquiry, or a handshake from a stranger. The flash was a fearful realization (often described as a shock, jolt, sinking feeling in the abdomen or scrotal spasm) that a sinister cue had been received. The individual then involuntar-ily reached for his genitals to check for their intactness. With the conviction that the genitals had vanished, he sounded a loud alarm. The victims were mostly men although women were also said to be afflicted. This syndrome was commonly understood as a supernatural occurrence in which the afflicted were robbed of their genitalia in order to magically benefit other people. People identified as benefitting from the ’genital theft’-who were often prosperous looking strangers or women-received very rough treatment {{at the hands of the}} alarmed crowd. Among the many emergent themes that may have contributed to the epidemic are male resentment of women’s success during a period of social strain and the symbolic equation of masculine sexuality with economic, social and creative prowess in many cultural myths.
