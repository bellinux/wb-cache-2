They insisted on supervising the live production, including using Martin Birch, who had previously collaborated with the band, as engineer, and were not {{particularly interested in the}} album's release, even after recording. The tour was successful, with strong media interest and a positive response from fans.|$|E

25|$|Kommotion was a teen-oriented daily TV {{pop music}} show, which had premiered in December 1964 on ATV-0, later Channel Ten. It {{included}} local performers miming {{to the latest}} overseas hits and artists showcasing their own material. In August 1966 its then-producer, David Joseph, was fired {{and most of the}} cast walked out in support. Al Maricic replaced Joseph and Meldrum reported the change-over for Go-Set. Maricic asked Meldrum to join the show: originally he declined but was convinced otherwise by Frazer, who reasoned that <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>good</b> <b>for</b> their circulation. Episodes of Kommotion were directed by Rob Weekes.|$|E

Although the law would make street hail of livery cabs legal, it was not welcomed by some of the livery cab drivers and politicians due to the fear that the cost would be too expensive as seen in the yellow taxi medallions which are sold through auctions with an average of $700,000 each. The Taxi and Limousine Commission clarified that the boro taxi permit would cost $1,500 and <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>good</b> <b>for</b> three years.|$|E
25|$|A {{daughter}} of Charles and Anaïs Lenglen, Suzanne Lenglen {{was born in}} Paris. During her youth, she suffered from numerous health problems including chronic asthma, which also plagued her at a later age. Because his daughter was so frail and sickly, Charles Lenglen, {{the owner of a}} carriage company, decided that <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>good</b> <b>for</b> her to compete in tennis and gain strength. Her first try at the game was in 1910, when she played on the tennis court at the family property in Marest-sur-Matz. The young girl enjoyed the game, and her father decided to train her further in the sport. His training methods included an exercise where, the story goes, he would lay down a handkerchief at various places on the court, to which his daughter had to direct the ball.|$|E
25|$|As for... {{the great}} {{question}} {{of the power of}} sovereigns and the obedience their peoples owe them, I usually say that <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>good</b> <b>for</b> princes to be persuaded that their {{people have the right to}} resist them, and for the people, on the other hand, to be persuaded to obey them passively. I am, however, quite of the opinion of Grotius, that one ought to obey as a rule, the evil of revolution being greater beyond comparison than the evils causing it. Yet I recognize that a prince can go to such excess, and place the well-being of the state in such danger, that the obligation to endure ceases. This is most rare, however, and the theologian who authorizes violence under this pretext should take care against excess; excess being infinitely more dangerous than deficiency.|$|E

25|$|Eve is {{the second}} human created by God, taken from one of Adam's ribs and shaped into a female form of Adam. Far from the {{traditional}} model of a good wife, she is often unwilling to be submissive towards Adam. She is more intelligent and curious about external ideas than her husband. Though happy, she longs for knowledge and, more specifically, self-knowledge. Her first act in existence is {{to turn away from}} Adam and look at and ponder her own reflection. Eve is extremely beautiful and thoroughly in love with Adam, though may feel suffocated by his constant presence. In Book IX, she convinces Adam that <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>good</b> <b>for</b> them to split up and work different parts of the Garden. In her solitude, she is tempted by Satan to sin against God. Adam shortly follows along with her.|$|E

500|$|On April 24, 1934, Hammond filed [...] for an [...] "electrical musical instrument", {{which was}} {{personally}} {{delivered to the}} patent office by Hanert, explaining that they could start production immediately and <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>good</b> <b>for</b> local employment in Chicago. The invention was unveiled {{to the public in}} April 1935, and the first model, the Model A, was made available in June of that year. Over 1,750 churches purchased a Hammond organ in {{the first three years of}} manufacturing, and by the end of the 1930s, over 200 instruments were being made each month. For all its subsequent success with professional musicians, the original company did not target its products at that market, principally because Hammond did not think [...] enough money was [...] in it. The Hammond Organ Company produced an estimated two million instruments in its lifetime; these have been described as [...] "probably the most successful electronic organs ever made". In 1966, an estimated 50,000 churches had installed a Hammond.|$|E

He told interviewers {{that he had had}} no problems whatsoever in Rhodesia, that sport in Rhodesia appeared to him to be integrated and that he intended to accept Smith's invitation to return there in the future to play more cricket. Reporting Bacher's suggestion of playing in South Africa, Sobers said that he probably would not do so: [...] "I don't know if I would want to get involved in that," [...] he said, [...] "but it does show that South African cricketers are willing to play with and against players of any colour, race or creed." [...] Sobers said that the white South African members of the Rest of the World squad in England had functioned well as part of the multiracial team, and that he hoped for a similar Rest of the World series in the Caribbean as he believed West Indian cricket fans would enjoy seeing the South African players. He expressed confusion regarding the calls for him to be stripped of his captaincy. [...] "I am a professional cricketer and a sportsman, not a politician," [...] he said. [...] "I went to play cricket. I don't see why this should affect my position as captain of the West Indies team." ...|$|E
500|$|Charles X Gustav's {{will and}} {{testament}} left {{the administration of}} the Swedish Empire during Charles XI's minority to a regency led by Queen Dowager Hedwig Eleonora as both formal regent and chair of a six-member Regency Council with two votes and a final say over the rest of the council. Per Brahe was one member of the council. [...] In addition, Charles X Gustav left command of the army and a seat on the council to his younger brother, Adolph John I, Count Palatine of Kleeburg. These provisions among others led to the remainder of the council immediately challenging the will. February 14, the day after King Charles X's death, Hedwig Eleonora sent a message to the council stating that she knew that they contested the will and that she demanded that it should be respected. The council answered that the will must first be discussed with the parliament, and at the following council in Stockholm on May 13, the council tried to keep her from attending. The parliament questioned whether <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>good</b> <b>for</b> her health or suitable for a widow to attend council, and that if not, {{it would be hard to}} keep sending a messenger to her quarters. Her reply that the council would be allowed to meet without her and only inform her when they considered it necessary was met with satisfaction from the council. Hedwig Eleonora's ostensible indifference to politics came as a great relief to the lords of the guardian government.|$|E

The sessions were hampered by a number of events, including Berry and bassist Mike Mills falling ill on separate occasions, Buck and Stipe leaving to visit family members, and the deaths of Stipe's friends River Phoenix and Kurt Cobain.

He also produced The Five-Year Engagement (2012), featuring Jason Segel and Emily Blunt as a couple who have a rocky five-year engagement. Apatow's fourth directorial effort, the Knocked Up spin-off This Is 40, was released by Universal Pictures on December 21, 2012. Starring Paul Rudd and Leslie Mann as the characters Pete and Debbie (reprising their roles from Knocked Up), the film also featured Jason Segel, Megan Fox, Lena Dunham, Chris O'Dowd, Melissa McCarthy, John Lithgow, Charlyne Yi, Albert Brooks, and Iris and Maude Apatow, as well as original music by Graham Parker & The Rumour (who play themselves). The film received mostly positive reactions from critics, with The New Yorkers Richard Brody writing that This Is 40 is [...] "the stuff of life, and it flows like life, and, like life, <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>good</b> <b>for</b> it to last longer." ...|$|E

2500|$|Is it {{not obvious}} {{that there are}} always enough moral {{problems}} without also taking a moral stand on technological grounds? [...] Print is the extreme phase of alphabet culture that detribalizes or decollectivizes man in the first instance. Print raises the visual features of alphabet to highest intensity of definition. Thus print carries the individuating power of the phonetic alphabet much further than manuscript culture could ever do. Print is the technology of individualism. If men decided to modify this visual technology by an electric technology, individualism would also be modified. To raise a moral complaint about this is like cussing a buzz-saw for lopping off fingers. [...] "But", someone says, [...] "we didn't know it would happen." [...] Yet even witlessness is not a moral issue.

2500|$|The {{years before}} the 1946 {{election}} saw a bitter struggle between C. Rajagopalachari (Rajaji) and K. Kamaraj for the leadership of Madras provincial Congress. Rajaji had quit the Congress on 15 July 1942 over differences with Congress leaders on issues related to Pakistan. After his departure, the Tamil Nadu Congress leadership was firmly {{in the hands of}} Kamaraj, who enjoyed enormous popularity in the Tamil region of the Madras Presidency. Rajaji re-entered Congress again in mid-1945. His return was much appreciated by Congress high command as they felt the Presidency needed his service greatly. Sathyamurthy was dead, Prakasam's [...] popularity was confined to the Andhra region and Kamaraj was very young. Rajaji's claim to leadership found strong support in a Provincial Congress Committee meeting held in Tirupparankundram on 31 October 1945. To counter him, Kamaraj aligned himself with leaders like C. N. Muthuranga Mudaliar and M. Bhaktavatsalam. The Congress high command sent Asaf Ali to Madras in an effort to mediate between the pro- and anti-Rajaji factions. Kamaraj and Mudaliar wrote to the Congress high command protesting its interference in local politics and its preference of Rajaji. Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel felt <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>good</b> <b>for</b> Rajaji to enter the Central Assembly. But Rajaji was interested in provincial politics and he wanted to contest from Madras University constituency. In summary, the Congress high command's contention that Madras Presidency Congress would be leaderless without Rajaji was not well received by Kamaraj and others and they were not willing to accept that it was acting purely {{in the interests of the}} province.|$|E

But what a stay - and as we draw towards Stan's exit from the show, the audience should get ready as one of Britain's finest actors pulls out all the stops and gives his King Lear..." [...] It was reported on 2 November 2014 that Babe Smith (Annette Badland) would grow suspicious of Stan's whereabouts and when she discovers the truth, order him to tell his family. Over a week later, it {{was announced}} that Stan would confirm he has terminal prostate cancer to his family after Babe hastily tells them at Lee's birthday meal. These scenes were praised by Prostate Cancer UK. On 20 December 2014, Dyer revealed on The Graham Norton Show that Stan would ask Mick to help him die in a new euthanasia storyline. Dyer said, [...] "I'm juggling about eight storylines at the moment. My old man is on his way out. My mother's got Alzheimer's - she's not my mother, my sister's actually my mum. My dad dying - he's not my dad, he's actually my grandad - he wants me to smother him." [...] The prostate cancer began taking its effect on Stan's health on 23 January 2015 when Stan collapses in mid-commotion. Digital Spy Sophie Dainty reported in January 2015 that the Carters would clash over Stan's request to be killed by his family as Tina agrees to helping him, but Mick firmly disagrees. Mick even informs the family of Stan's request and they strongly disagree. Stan's request was made following his collapse. West praised show bosses for handling Stan's cancer storyline the way they have and their way of handling West's decision to leave the show, [...] "They very kindly said I could have some time out and they would send me to South Africa or prison.
