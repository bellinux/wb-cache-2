The efficiency of the DLR measurement equipment is demonstrated by means of determination opti-cal properties of a <b>fluid</b> <b>filter.</b> Additionally obtained measurement results are compared with theoretical calculations. The <b>fluid</b> <b>filter</b> was designed, constructed and tested to absorb undesired radiation before entering photochemical re-actors. As a first application the filter was filled with water to absorb the IR part of the solar spectrum. Due to the changes in the spectral content of the conceneated radiation the flux measurement system had to be calibrated espe-cially for the employment of the water filter. Each filter thickness requires its own calibration. This lead to an inten-sive measurement campaign to determine the optical properties of the <b>fluid</b> <b>filter</b> and the efficiency of the measure-ment equipment. ...|$|E

40|$|AbstractFor {{effectively}} {{removing the}} water-based drilling <b>fluid</b> <b>filter</b> cake and improving interfacial cementing strength and cementing quality, {{a new type}} of cementation flushing fluid (WD-C) was developed based on the strong flushing principle of water soluble fiber and the oxygenolysis principle of filter cake. It is composed of 0. 5 % WF-H fiber, 2. 2 % WF-O oxidant, 0. 35 % FeSO 4, 1. 8 % KCl, 3. 0 % swollen powder perlite and water with its density of 1. 03  g/cm 3. This cementation flushing fluid was systematically tested and evaluated in terms of its washing efficiency on the filter cake of water-based drilling fluid and its capacity to improve the bonding strength of cementation interface. In addition, an analysis was performed of its effect on the physical-chemical characteristics and the micro-structures of interfacial cements by means of infrared spectrum (IR), scanning electron microscope (SEM) and energy dispersive X-ray detector (EDS). It is shown that the new cementation flushing fluid presents excellent washing effect on water-based drilling <b>fluid</b> <b>filter</b> cake (with washing time within 10  min). The cement particles at the cemented interface can be hydrated normally, and hydrated calcium silicate gel, Ca(OH) 2 and rod-shaped ettringite (AFt) crystal are generated and interwoven with each other. In this way, dense network structures are formed, so the bonding strength of the second cementing interface rises significantly, and then cementing quality is improved. Based on the research results, one more technology is set up for removing the water-based drilling <b>fluid</b> <b>filter</b> cake efficiently and improving the bonding strength of the second cementing interface...|$|E

The first electrode structure has stabilizing element. DETAILED DESCRIPTION - The <b>fluid</b> <b>filter</b> (10) comprises a filter membrane (12) having a first main side, a second main side lying opposite to the first main side and micropores extending {{between the first and second}} main sides (12 a, 12 b), a first electrode structure (16 a), which partially covers the filter membrane at the first main side, so that a section of the first main side exposes with a part of the micropores for generating an electric field with field lines, which penetrate through a gap that adjoins at the section, and a second electrode structure (16 b). The first electrode structure has a stabilizing element and a structured electrode layer, where the stabilizing element is arranged between the structured electrode layer and the first main surface and mechanically stabilizes the filter membrane. The first electrode structure is designed, so that the section has several sections in which the first main side exposes with respective part of the micropores and has an electrode layer, which is adjacent to the sections in lateral direction, so that an electric stray field is produced with field lines, which penetrate through the gap adjoining at the respective section. The electrode layer forms first and second comb-shaped electrodes with electrode fingers, which engage into each other, so that the adjacent electrode finger belongs to different first and second comb-shaped electrodes and is arranged between the same respectively to the sections. The structured electrode layer is structured, so that it forms two electrodes, to which the different potential is applied and which lie opposite to each other over each of the sections, so that the lateral electric field forms itself with the stray field at each section during applying the different potential, where the field lines of the stray field penetrates through the gap adjoining at the sections and present between the structured electrode layer and the first main side. The second electrode structure covers the filter membrane at the second main side, so that the second main side exposes to one of the sections that lies opposite to the sections at the first main side and has a further structured electrode layer, by which a characteristic electric field is produced with the field lines that are congruent to the field lines penetrating through the gap adjoining at the oppositely lying section of the first main side. The filter membrane is electrically conductive or is coated with an electrically conducting material to form a first electrode. The structured electrode layer forms a second electrode. The second electrode structure covers the filter membrane at the second main side symmetrical to the first electrode structure.

40|$|Drilling fluid`s {{contact with}} the {{productive}} zone of horizontal or complex wells can reduce well productivity by fluid invasion in the borehole wall. Salted drilling drill-in fluid containing polymers has often been applied in horizontal or complex petroleum wells in the poorly consolidated sandstone reservoirs of the Campos basin, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. This fluid usually consists of natural polymers such as starch and xanthan gum, which are deposited as a filter cake on the wellbore wall during the drilling. Therefore, the identification of a lift-off mechanism failure, which can be detachment or blistering and pinholing, will enable formulation improvements. increasing the chances of success during filter cake removal in open hole operations. Likewise, knowledge of drill-in drilling fluid adsorption/desorption onto sand can help understand the filter cake-rock adhesion mechanism and consequently filter cake lift-off mechanism failures. The present study aimed to identify the lift-off failure mechanism {{for this type of}} <b>fluid</b> <b>filter</b> cake studying adsorption/desorption onto SiO(2) using solutions of natural polymers, lubricants, besides the fluid itself. Ellipsometry was employed to measure this process. The adsorption/desorption studies showed that the adsorbed layer of drilling fluid onto the walls of the rock pores is made up of clusters of polymers, linked by hydrogen bonds, which results in a force of lower cohesion compared to the electrostatic interaction between silica and polymers. Consequently, {{it was found that the}} most probable filter cake failure mechanism is rupture (blistering and pinholing), which results in the formation of ducts within the filter cake.

40|$|In the Middle East, {{extended}} reach horizontal wells (on {{the order}} of 25, 000 feet of horizontal displacement) are commonly acid stimulated by jetting acid out of drill pipe. The acid is jetted onto {{the face of the}} openhole wellbore as the drill pipe is withdrawn from the well. The jetting action helps to remove the drilling <b>fluid</b> <b>filter</b> cake and promote the acid to penetrate into the formation and form wormholes to stimulate the well. However, with very long sections of wellbore open to flow, the acid placement and subsequent wormhole distribution and penetration depths are uncertain. This study has modeled the acid jetting process using a comprehensive model of acid placement and wormhole propagation in a horizontal well. It is presumed that the acid jetting tool removes the drilling mud filter cake, so that no filter cake exists between the end of the drill pipe and the toe of the well. Correspondingly, the model also assumes that there is an intact, low-permeability filter cake on the borehole wall between the end of the drill pipe and the heel of the well. The drill pipe is modeled as being withdrawn from the well during the acid jetting treatment, as is done in practice. The acidizing simulator predicts the distribution of acid and the depths of wormholes formed as functions of time and position during the acid jetting treatment. The model shows that the acid jetting process as typically applied in these wells preferentially stimulates the toe region of the horizontal well. Comparisons of the simulation predictions with published data for acid jetting treatments in such wells showed good general agreement. Based on the simulation study, this study presents recommendations for improved acid jetting treatment procedures to improve the distribution of acid injected into the formation...|$|E
