Predictions compare favorably with experiments. It is shown that the spatial B-jump needs less tailwater depth, thereby enhancing the stability of the jump when compared either with spatial jump, which forms in sudden expanding channels, or with B-jump, which forms in a channel with an abrupt drop in bed.

Materials and methods:The abdominal aorta of ten 90 kg pigs was exposed from the superior mesenteric artery to the trifurcation. A segment of the aorta was bypassed using a polyurethane graft. Three anastomosis angles: 90 ° (n = 3), 45 ° (n = 3) and 15 ° (n = 4) were studied. The bypass length, the anatomical position and the geometry of the anastomoses were standardised. During measurements, the proximal outflow segment was occluded and the flow rate was controlled by reversible iliac artery cross-clamping. Using a colour Doppler system the velocity fields were measured at various positions in the anatomosis. The colour Doppler velocity data were transferred to a computer for dynamic three-dimensional visualisation of the velocity profiles. Results:The angulation was reproduced within 10 %. During the experiment, the flow rate was kept constant with Reynold's numbers typical for peripheral arteries. In the 90 ° anastomoses very disturbed flow fields were seen. The 45 ° anastomoses were characterised by: (1) low antegrade and retrograde velocities at the heel and (2) a zone of reverse and oscillating velocities at the toe and at one diameter <b>downstream</b> of the <b>toe</b> (1 DDD) during deceleration.

40|$|Thesis (MScEng (Civil Engineering)) [...] University of Stellenbosch, 2006. Stepped spillways {{constructed}} of roller compacted concrete (RCC) is a hydraulic and cost effective measure to dissipate energy of large water flows over the spillway of a dam. Stepped spillways, like other spillway types, have its limitations and {{a measure to}} improve the energy dissipation effectiveness is proposed. Two hydraulic models were constructed at the hydraulics laboratory of the Department of Water Affairs and Forestry (DWAF) in Pretoria, South Africa. The scales of the models were 1 : 20 and 1 : 30. The study proposes the use of triangular protrusions applied over the spillway surface. The protrusions have the same height as the steps, with {{the width of the}} protrusions varying. The triangular protrusions deflect the water sideways resulting in higher energy losses. The results indicate that the protrusions reduce scouring at the toe of the dam, thus increasing the roughness of the steps. It also indicate that aeration occur earlier than with normal stepped spillways. An optimal spacing, lateral and across the steps, are proposed. The construction of the protrusions is also discussed, as well as the cost implications. It is concluded that the protrusions are effective at a unit discharge up to 35 m 3 /s. m. This value is however dependent on the configuration of the apron <b>downstream</b> of the <b>toe</b> of the dam. It is proposed that protrusions be added on the downstream face of the dam on every second step, with one protrusion and then no protrusion alternating in the flow path.

40|$|Many {{environmental}} problems {{are linked to}} multiphase flows encompassing ecological issues, chemical processes and mixing or diffusion, with applications in different engineering fields. The transition from a supercritical flowto a subcritical motion constitutes a hydraulic jump. This flow regime is characterised by strong interactions between turbulence, free surface and air–water mixing. Although a hydraulic jump contributes to some dissipation of the flow kinetic energy, {{it is also associated}} with increases of turbulent shear stresses and the development of turbulent eddies with implications in terms of scour, erosion and sediment transport. Despite a number of experimental, theoretical and numerical studies, {{there is a lack of}} knowledge concerning the physical mechanisms involved in the diffusion and air–water mixing processes within hydraulic jumps, as well as on the interaction between the free-surface and turbulence. New experimental investigations were undertaken in hydraulic jumps with Froude numbers up to Fr = 8. 3. Two-phase flow measurements were performed with phase-detection conductivity probes. Basic results related to the distributions of void fraction, bubble frequency and mean bubble chord length are presented. New developments are discussed for the interfacial bubble velocities and their fluctuations, characterizing the turbulence level and integral time scales of turbulence representing a “lifetime” of the longitudinal bubbly flow structures. The analyses show good agreement with previous studies in terms of the vertical profiles of void fraction, bubble frequency and mean bubble chord length. The dimensionless distributions of interfacial velocities compared favourably with wall-jet equations. Measurements showed high turbulence levels.

40|$|ObjectiveProsthetic femoral-popliteal {{bypasses}} {{are performed}} {{by using an}} end-to-side anastomosis, and disease can develop at the distal end; {{this can lead to}} poor long-term patency rates. Disturbed flow characteristics are hypothesized as being a major factor in promoting disease development. The objective {{of this study was to}} propose a new prosthetic femoral-popliteal bypass graft configuration specifically engineered to reduce or eliminate certain disease-influencing factors that act on the host artery. MethodsThe proposed device contains a streamlined bifurcation toward its distal end that results in two end-to-end anastomoses, rather than the single end-to-side anastomosis in the traditional procedure. Comparisons are made between idealized representations of it and the traditional end-to-side anastomosis for specific femoral artery flow rates. Qualitative results in the form of velocity vector plots and wall shear stress contour plots are compared, and quantitative results examine the wall shear stress magnitudes and gradients along the bed and roof of each graft model. ResultsVelocity vector plots through each junction suggest that the proposed graft configuration promotes streamlined flow and helps to reduce the magnitude of flow recirculation and separation regions associated with the traditional end-to-side anastomosis. At peak velocity, the flow separation region distal to the toe is eliminated, as evidenced by the change in toe wall shear stress from − 0. 2 Pa in the traditional anastomosis to + 0. 5 Pa in the proposed device. Normal fully developed flow occurs sooner in the distal host artery, approximately 15 mm <b>downstream</b> from the <b>toe,</b> unlike 20 mm in the conventional case. The proposed design results in reductions of up to 58 % in peak wall shear stress and 86 % in peak wall shear stress gradient during the decelerative phase of the femoral pulse in the vicinity of the artery bed below the toe. ConclusionsIn vitro tests on the proposed device suggest that the streamlined nature of blood flow through the junction does result in less disturbed hemodynamic conditions within the host artery junction. Abnormal wall shear stress magnitudes and gradients are reduced, and normal fully developed flow occurs sooner in the distal host artery. This suggests that the proposed graft may have design attributes that are relevant in the search for increased prosthetic femoral-popliteal bypass graft patency rates. A drawback of the proposed device is that significant flow recirculation and separation exist within the prosthesis itself. Clinical RelevanceThe search for a viable alternative to traditional end-to-side anastomosis for prosthetic femoral-popliteal bypass procedures is ongoing. Prosthetic femoral-popliteal bypass procedures have low long-term patency rates, and there is a need for methods that increase the life span of the procedure. Although research is progressing on a variety of different fronts, this study is significant in that it reports on in vitro tests on a potential device that may increase bypass patency. The device is simple, may be manufactured from clinically proven materials, does not require any additional training in its use, and combines attributes of end-to-side anastomoses with those of end-to-end anastomoses. In addition, the design concept behind the device, the natural bifurcation, may be relevant in other aspects of cardiovascular surgery...|$|R

The site is a small terminal moraine impounding roughly 300, 000 m 3 of water at ~ 3400 m a. s. l. Suspicious fine sediment in a small lake at the dam's <b>downstream</b> <b>toe</b> prompted initial concerns that anomalous seepage may be eroding matrix material from the moraine. 235 individual SP measurements covering {{the surface of the}} dam were collected in order to investigate electrokinetic current sources resulting from seepage, while resistivity soundings probed moraine stratigraphy and suggest that the till contains interstitial ice. Contoured SP data reveal a non-uniform voltage distribution over the moraine dam and two distinct negative SP anomalies. The first, located in the central area of the moraine, shows a broad negative SP zone around the crest and increasingly positive SP moving downhill towards both the upstream and downstream toes. This anomaly can be explained by shallow gravitational groundwater flow in the near subsurface combined with upward groundwater flux through evapotranspiration; numerical simulation of the combined effect matches field data well. The second SP anomaly has a tightly localized distribution and can be explained by vertically descending flow into a bedrock fault conduit. Our conceptual seepage model suggests that flow travels from Dana Lake first at the boundary of ice-filled moraine and bedrock before converging on a concentrated channel in the subvertical fault zone. Positive SP near the dam abutments results from groundwater inflow from adjacent hillslopes. Combined analyses suggest that seepage erosion is not currently affecting the moraine dam, and that the sediment observed on the bed of the <b>downstream</b> <b>toe</b> lake is likely a remnant of past outflow events...|$|E

Surveys were completed along the crest and <b>downstream</b> <b>toe</b> of the dam. Results from the surveys indicate that each method is capable of resolving the bedrock depth within 1 - 2 m of locations shown on previous drilling logs, though some discrepancies between the methods exist. A weathered bedrock layer {{is believed to have}} led to the different depths between the methods. Rayleigh wave MASW and FWI were determined to be most effective at determining bedrock depth at deeper bedrock locations (i. e., the dam crest) and Love wave MASW was the only viable seismic method at detecting bedrock for areas with thin soil layers and complex bedrock geometry (i. e., the dam toe). The CCR and ERI results were in general agreement in bedrock depth estimation except for a long region {{in the middle of the}} dam, which assuming temporal water level variation, is an area of potential internal erosion. Higher water levels when the CCR data was collected in the spring are believed to have resulted in lower resistivities, due to the presence of water, while lower summer water levels resulted in higher resistivities for the ERI results, suggesting that fines may have been eroded out of the interior of the dam over time. This indicates that both CCR and ERI provide consistent data and demonstrates the importance of resistivity monitoring or seasonal surveys for internal erosion detection.

So this paper presents the results of a new series of laboratory experiments on erosion of an overtopped non-cohesive sand dike. The setup represents a 2 D-V problem with a narrow slide of dike between two glass walls. Two different uniform sediment grain sizes were tested: coarse sand (d 50 = 1. 85 mm) and fine sand (d 50 = 0. 61 mm). The focus is first set on the seepage effect into the dike failure process. For the coarse sand, characterized by an important permeability, the seepage is too important to study a failure governed by pure overtopping. On the contrary, with the fine sand, the presence of a sand layer downstream of the dike, acting as a drain, avoids any sliding of the <b>downstream</b> <b>toe.</b> The second part of the study focuses on the dike erosion in presence of a downstream sand layer, ensuring failure governed by pure overtopping. Two sets were performed with distinct inflow in the upstream reservoir. The overall erosion process is comparable for both sets, with direct deposition downstream of the dike, and the formation of large antidunes during the lowering of the crest level.

Their analysis has demonstrated a strong potential and expediency of application of geosynthetic casings {{in the course of}} construction and renovation of low-pressure earth dams. The authors have also developed a new structure of an earth dam. The new earth dam has geosynthetic casings used as structural reinforcing elements of the crown and the downstream slope. The dam structure contemplates the overflow of high water. The structural strengths of the proposed solution include a smaller material consumption rate, lower labour intensiveness and cost of the slope reinforcement due to the application of local building materials used to fill the casings, fast and easy depositing of slope reinforcing elements, and high workability of its dismantling for repair purposes. The authors have also completed the analysis of stability of geosynthetic casings of downstream slopes of an earth dam. The analysis has proven high efficiency of a small slope ratio in combination with its anchorage and reinforcement of the <b>downstream</b> <b>toe</b> with the help of high-strength geogrids.

40|$|Piping {{has been}} {{attributed}} {{as a major}} cause of dam and embankment failures. Current national prediction models to predict piping use the hydraulic gradient between the upstream and downstream water levels as an indicator. They are deterministic and take no account of preferential pathways. However, piping usually initiates from a discrete downstream location and recent research indicates that piping happens when the water velocity reaches a critical value. The local velocity close to the downstream ground surface is strongly related to the inherent heterogeneity of the soil. This paper takes account of the spatial variability of hydraulic conductivity. Based on stochastic seepage analysis, local velocities in and under an embankment are computed. The results show that, when the coefficient of variation of hydraulic conductivity is small, the locations of the maximum local velocity from 500 realizations aggregate into a small area which is near the <b>downstream</b> <b>toe</b> of the embankment. In contrast, increasing the coefficient of variation scatters the possible locations of the maximum local velocity. Two typical situations are identified: one situation where the maximum local velocity is close to the downstream ground surface, and the other where the maximum local velocity is far from the downstream ground surface and located {{near the center of the}} foundation. In the first situation it is easier to reach the critical value to initiate piping because the maximum local velocity is near the ground surface, but it is also relatively easy to protect against. In contrast, in the second situation it is easier to form a passage for piping development once piping is initiated. This is due to the velocity towards the center of the foundation increasing...|$|E
40|$|Willow Creek Dam {{is located}} in a unique region on the {{boundary}} of a confined aquifer, where artesian conditions exist. Recently, groundwater levels have exceeded the elevation of the downstream berm well above anticipated piezometric elevations. It was presumed from limited evidence that these high piezometric levels resulted from pressure in the aquifer rather than from seepage out of the reservoir. The purpose of this investigation was to determine the relative contributions of the reservoir and the regional groundwater to observed piezometric levels and how these levels affect seepage exit gradients and slope stability of the dam. Comparing the head levels in shallow and deep piezometers at the dam, the seepage is shown to originate from the regional aquifer and to flow upwards. The head in the groundwater exceeds the reservoir elevation, and the reservoir elevation has little influence on local phreatic elevations. The largest annual fluctuations in the groundwater levels result from local irrigation pumping. Influences of irrigation wells were quantified using a well influence statistic derived for this study. This statistic was found to be the best predictor of variation in groundwater elevations at the dam. Using a finite element analysis program, it was shown that the regional aquifer provides all the flow into the relief well system and solely contributes to the exit gradients long the <b>downstream</b> <b>toe.</b> Flow rates in the dam’s 27 pressure relief wells were found to be less than the flow rates when the reservoir was first filled, even though piezometer levels are much higher now. This points to a need to redevelop the pressure relief wells. Resulting higher relief well flow will decrease the piezometric levels at the dam and will result in reduced exit gradients. Local and global slope stability was not found to be in jeopardy with local seepage failure occurring well before stability failures. Advisor: John R. Rohd...|$|E
40|$|There are {{thousands}} of embankment dams around the world which represent a significant economic and ecological risk should any of them fail. In previous failure {{events such as the}} Baldwin Hills Reservoir near Los Angeles which failed in 1964, destroying 277 homes and killing five people and causing $ 73 million in property damage. Other failures include the Buffalo Creek coal tailings dam in West Virginia which failed in 1972, killing 125 people, injuring over 1000 more and leaving thousands homeless and the Teton Dam in Idaho which failed in 1976 killing 14 people and causing over $ 1 billion in damages, and the recent Situ Gintung Lake Dam near Jakarta, Indonesia which failed March 26, 2009 killing almost 100 people. The goal {{of this study is to}} provide the experimental basis for a new numerical dam breach model which will help to address many of the shortcomings identified in the literature which are due primarily to lack of knowledge. Shortcomings have been identified in the existing models in the areas of breach initiation, breach location, breach morphology, hydraulics of flow over an embankment, sediment transport equations, geomechanics of the breach, and modeling composite embankments. For example, it has been said that there is an uncertainty of about 50 % which can be expected from estimates of peak discharge for the existing numerical models (Franca and Almeida, 2004). To address the existing limitations, two embankment test series were developed. The first series of tests was conducted in a smaller flume in which compaction was varied. These tests shed light on the effects of compaction as well as the effects of side walls in testing and some of the effects that unsaturated soils and slope stability have on the breach process. The second series of tests was conducted in a larger flume with varying initial breach geometry as well as varying the filtration characteristics of the embankment. These tests demonstrate the role of initial breach geometry in dam breach mechanics and also help with understanding the importance of slope stability and unsaturated soil mechanics. One of these runs also included a clay core to study the effects of composite construction. These two test series were supported by data obtained by a series of geotechnical investigations as well as a series of erosion characteristics tests which were both conducted using the dam construction materials. From these test series, the following conclusions have been drawn: (i) A four phase breach process is proposed based on quantitative analysis of breach morphology. (ii) Initial breach geometry does not appear to have any effect on the peak breach outflow. (iii) The density of the embankment plays an important role in determining the shape of the outflow hydrograph as well as the peak flow. (iv) The breach is widest at the <b>downstream</b> <b>toe</b> of the embankment and smallest at the crest, but widens again upstream of the crest. (v) The slope failure mode does not appear to have any impact on breach characteristics. (vi) Tailwater conditions have a notable effect on breach morphology and reservoir volume also appears to have an important effect on sediment deposition characteristics. It should be noted that these conclusions have not been drawn for the purposes of improving dam construction techniques. Rather, they are useful for developing a more advanced numerical breach model in the hope of improving the accuracy of risk assessments in downstream flood zones. A new set of criteria could then be developed to define the new flood elevations and improve warning times for people who may be at risk...|$|E

[...] İstanbul Technical University, Instıtute of Science and Technology, 2015 Sızma, bütün ayrıntılarıyla açıklanamayan önemli baraj stabilite problemlerinden biridir. Sızma basit olarak suyun barajın memba kısmından mansap tarafına doğal yollarla hareketi olarak tanımlanır. Suyun bu hareketi hem klasik su barajlarında hem de atık barajlarında baraj ömrüne ve baraj stabilitesine önemli derecede etki eder. Baraj gövdelerinde borulanma oluşması ve içsel erozyonun meydana gelmesi bu etkinin sonuçlarındandır. Atık barajlar, çeşitli yollarla elde edilmiş atıkları depolamaya yarayan ve yine çeşitli yollarla üzerinde biriken suyu mansaba aktaran yapılardır. Atık baraj birçok yönüyle klasik su barajlarından farklılık gösterir. En önemli farklardan biri barajın ömrüdür. Su barajlarında ömür sınırlıyken, atık barajın ise atık üreten madenin faaliyetleri bitse bile çok daha uzun zaman stabil kalması gerekmektedir. Diğer bir fark ise atık barajın çevre açısından büyük risk oluşturan atıkların depolamaya olanak vermesidir. Bu durumdan dolayı herhangi bir sızmaya karşı çevreye verilebilecek zarar büyük olacağından, tasarım kriterleri açısından sızmanın hayati bir durum teşkil ettiği aşikârdır. Diğer bir taraftan atık barajlarda sızma mekanizmasını açıklayacak literatür çalışmalarının sayısı sınırlıdır. Bu çalışmada, tipik bir toprak dolgu baraj tipi atık barajın sonlu farklar yardımıyla oluşturulmuş yeni bir matematik model ile sızma mekanizması incelenmiştir. Atık baraja ait sızma ağı çıkartılmış, sızma miktarı ise sonlu elemanlar tabanlı GeoStudio SEEP/W programı ile mukayese edilmiştir. İki modelde de gözlenen sonuçlar tatmin edici olup aradaki farklar kabul edilebilir seviyededir. Bu durum uygulama açısından karmaşık sızma problemlerine kolay ve uygulanabilir bir bakış açısı getirmektedir. Seepage {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} dam stability problems that could not be explained fully in detail. Seepage is identified as the natural way of water from upstream to downstream of a dam along the dam body. It has significant impacts on dam life and dam stability in both water retention dams (WRD) and tailings dam directly, e. g., internal erosion and piping are observed through the dam body. "Tailings" or "tails" is the name given to fine-grained industrial wastes commonly, though not exclusively, produced as a waste product from mining and quarrying activities. The particles range from sand to clay-size fraction. The technology of tailings dam design is based on the same geotechnical principles as water dams, however the presence of saturated tailings solids as the stored medium, versus water only, presents unique challenges and design benefits. The tailings dam is an embankment designed to enable the deposited tailings to settle, and to retain tailings and process water. The gradation of mine tailings typically varies from silty medium fine sand to clayey silt. Tailings dam design sections vary considerably. For example, the dam can be made entirely out of unprocessed tailings with upstream construction, or the dam may be made out of borrow material with little or no reliance on the tailings. Impounded tailing solids have hydraulic conductivity and shear strength properties that can be used to the advantage of the designer. On the other hand, sulphide rich mine tailings have a potential to oxidize and leach metals through acid rock drainage. Seepage control, for environmental, becomes a critical design parameter which can lead to much lower tolerances for seepage losses from the impoundment, compared to water dams. Tailings dam differs from WRD in many cases. Design, construction, operation, and closure of tailing dams have some fundamental differences when compared to conventional water storage dams. One of the significant differences is life time of the dam. WRD’s design life is finite, on the contrary a tailings dam needs to be stable over long time periods even after the closure of mining activities. Furthermore, leakage in tailings dam would be hazardous for environment because of deposition of mining waste material. Therefore, seepage is a very crucial design criteria for tailings dam. However, the number of studies aiming at understanding the seepage mechanism of tailings dams is limited in literature. In this work, seepage through a typical tailings earthen dam was investigated using a mathematical model-spreadsheet analysis- based on the finite difference solution method. The spreadsheet analysis is a very powerful tool with a wide range of mathematical related capabilities. It provide a comprehensive and practical tool for organizing numbers and performing numerical calculations. For the finite difference application a template is created to include the problem domain and all applicable boundaries. As the boundaries, the base of the dam and the impervious boundary with limitation to only straight horizontal and vertical lines can be included in the template. The finite difference grid with the value of potential or head at each node can also be combined in the template. Finally, the template become a ready to analysis and solve the system. These steps make twice to calculate streamlines and potential lines values. After these calculations, the streamlines and potential lines graphics are drawn according to the number of iterations. In this study, seepage problem analyzed by making 100 iterations. Furthermore, a couple of different iterations were made and these solutions were shown in appendix part. The reason of choosing 100 iterations is that all iterations after 100 are very close each other. This enable study to be had reasonable and applicable solutions. In addition to the suggested mathematical model, the analyses were performed using finite elements based software Geostudio SEEP/W. This software shows how easy it is to find the downstream seepage face and amount of seepage. The upstream boundary nodes are designated as head boundaries with total head equal to the water level in the reservoir. The <b>downstream</b> <b>toe</b> is assigned a total head of zero m (H = elevation). The downstream slope is assigned a potential seepage face type of boundary condition. A potential seepage face review boundary is a Q (seepage discharge) = zero boundary with the potential seepage face review option checked. After tailings dam section draws, materials are identified and materials properties like hydraulic conductivity also enter to the system software. Finally, the amount of seepage flows through dam body and phreatic line figure obtain at the end of the successful seepage analysis. The seepage values were observed with both the finite difference method and SEEP/W. In the spreadsheet analysis, nine streamlines and twelve potential lines are obtained. By using these solutions in graphical method, seepage flow net, phreatic line and amount of seepage are also found. Comparison between finite difference results and Geostudio results determines the main goal of the study. The results showed that differences between the seepage values obtained by two different models were acceptable and satisfying. In addition, the results bring a new and feasible perspective to complex seepage problems in terms of application. Yüksek LisansM. Sc...|$|E
