25|$|Gray's {{defenders}} {{would later}} argue that Gray simply practiced a management style {{that was different}} from that of Hoover. Gray's program of field office visits was something that Hoover had not done since his early years as director, and some felt Gray's visits did much to raise the morale of the agents working in those field offices. Furthermore, Gray's leadership style seemed to mirror what he had learned in the US Navy, in which the executive officer concentrates on the basic operation of the ship, while the captain concentrates on its position and heading. Felt believed Gray's methods were an unnecessary distraction and showed a lack of leadership. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>sure</b> <b>he</b> {{was not the only one}} of the FBI leaders who disapproved of Gray's methods, particularly among those who had served under Hoover.|$|E
25|$|Given {{his very}} weak heart, Poirot conceives {{that he must}} end the string of murders by killing Norton. Poirot invites Norton for hot chocolate: at their meeting, he tells Norton what he {{suspects}} and his plan to execute him. Norton, arrogant and self-assured, insists on swapping cups: anticipating this move, Poirot had drugged both cups, knowing {{that he had a}} higher tolerance for a dose that would incapacitate Norton. Poirot moves the sleeping Norton back to his room using the wheelchair: Poirot could walk, one reason he needed a new valet who was unaware of that for this last case. Then, being the same height as Norton, he disguises himself as Norton by removing his wig and false moustache, ruffling up his grey hair, then donning Norton's dressing-gown and walking with a limp. Having Hastings establish that Norton was alive after he left Poirot's room, Poirot shoots Norton, leaves the pistol on the table and locks the room with a duplicate key. Poirot then writes his story, and ceases to take his amyl nitrite heart medicine. He cannot say it was right to commit murder, but on balance <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>sure</b> <b>he</b> prevented yet more instigated by Norton. His last wish for Hastings is typical for Poirot, the matchmaker: he suggests that Hastings should pursue Elizabeth Cole.|$|E
500|$|For Frank's protection, he {{was taken}} to the Milledgeville State Penitentiary {{in the middle of the}} night before the {{commutation}} was announced. The penitentiary was [...] "strongly garrisoned and newly bristling with arms" [...] and separated from Marietta by [...] of mostly unpaved road. However, on July 17, The New York Times reported that fellow inmate William Creen tried to kill Frank by slashing his throat with a [...] butcher knife, severing his jugular vein. The attacker told the authorities he [...] "wanted to keep the other inmates safe from mob violence, Frank's presence was a disgrace to the prison, and <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>sure</b> <b>he</b> would be pardoned if he killed Frank." ...|$|E

500|$|In December 1892, the {{congregation}} expelled Rosenberg, charging him with eating {{a piece of}} pork, which is not kosher. To augment his salary of $400 (today $) a year from Beth Jacob, Rosenberg also worked as an agent for a cigar company. While visiting a customer at a bar, he was alleged to have eaten the pork while partaking {{of some of the}} free lunch provided there. Rosenberg initially said that while he had drunk a great deal, he had not eaten anything at all, and subsequently stated that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>sure</b> <b>he</b> had not eaten pork, because the bar-keep had sworn in affidavit that there was none in the lunch provided that day. Rosenberg later averred consistently that if he had eaten any pork, it was inadvertently. He also alleged hypocrisy {{on the part of the}} members, stating [...] "They are all reformed Jews in private, although orthodox Jews in public." ...|$|E
500|$|With no {{knowledge}} of the fashion industry, Morgan decided to make a film on the topic after being shocked by the news of the collapse of Rana Plaza. After spending several days getting information, and discovering the industry's human rights violations and [...] "staggering environmental impacts", <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>sure</b> <b>he</b> had to make the film. He had also previously had an appreciation for the genre, saying he was [...] "actually fascinated by those [...] films that follow one person". Like Morgan a non-connoisseur of fashion, executive producer and eco activist Lucy Siegle said that she does not like such films as they are usually limited to exploring the aesthetic aspects of the industry. It is The True Cost differential in her opinion; it [...] "goes there and then someit unravels the grim, gritty, global supply chain of fast fashion". Nevertheless, the film purposely does not give viewers a clear answer on how to solve the problems as there are [...] "no straightforward answers". Morgan commented, [...] "I'm probably most proud that we avoided easy answers and instead chose to trust people to both feel and think deeply about the issues raised." ...|$|E
2500|$|In January 2013, Prodigy {{revealed}} <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>sure</b> <b>he</b> would {{record with}} Havoc in the future. The 2013's Paid Dues lineup then revealed Mobb Deep would be rejoining {{to perform at}} the March 30, 2013 event. They would later confirmed to be reuniting for Paid Dues and an international 20th anniversary tour starting in May 2013. On March 22, 2013, Havoc and Prodigy officially reunited for an interview, and touched base on the turmoil between them. Prodigy stated [...] "At {{the end of the}} day, the music {{is the most important thing}} and our love for each other it's only right we're gonna get right back to work." ...|$|E
50|$|Born on the Fourth of July, 1900, John Sims (James Murray) {{loses his}} father when <b>he</b> <b>is</b> twelve.

2500|$|In the best-of-17 final O'Sullivan {{defeated}} McCulloch 9–5 to win {{his second}} consecutive ranking title. It was his 21st ranking final and 16th ranking title, which meant he was now third on the list ahead of Williams and Higgins. The victory earned him £60,000 and meant he had won all the ranking events on the calendar at least once. After the match O'Sullivan said he could still improve: [...] "I have set myself high standards and I don't think I was firing on any cylinders." [...] McCulloch said <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>sure</b> <b>he</b> would win a ranking title: [...] "I have lost two finals now but I will win one—it {{is just a matter}} of when." ...|$|E
2500|$|The writing effort changed {{direction}} when Franklin {{fell ill}} and {{was removed from}} the production. Zimbalist offered the project to William Wyler, who had been one of 30 assistant directors on the 1925 film, in early 1957. Wyler initially rejected it, considering the quality of the script [...] to be [...] "very primitive, elementary" [...] and no better than hack work. It lacked good characterization, the dramatic structure was poor, and the leads were uninteresting (just [...] "villains and heroes"). Zimbalist showed Wyler some preliminary storyboards for the chariot race, and Wyler began to express an interest in the picture. Zimbalist told Wyler, [...] "Forget the chariot race. That's just second-unit stuff", stating that the real challenge would be to give the picture [...] "body, depth, intimacy", which Wyler was renowned for. Zimbalist also told Wyler that MGM would spend up to $10 million on the film, and Wyler, impressed with the large budget, agreed to review the script a second time. The more Wyler thought about the story, the more he became intrigued with its possibilities. However, {{according to a report in}} The New York Times, Wyler refused to take the job until <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>sure</b> <b>he</b> had a good leading man. MGM permitted Wyler to start casting, and in April 1957, mainstream media outlets reported that Wyler was giving screen tests to Italian leading men, such as Cesare Danova.|$|E
