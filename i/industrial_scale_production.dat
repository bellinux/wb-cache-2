5|$|New {{economic}} forces also changed the Commonwealth. Virginian James Albert Bonsack invented the tobacco cigarette rolling machine in 1880 leading to new <b>industrial</b> <b>scale</b> <b>production</b> centered on Richmond. In 1886, railroad magnate Collis Potter Huntington founded Newport News Shipbuilding, which {{was responsible for}} building six major World War I-era battleships for the U.S. Navy from 1907 to 1923. During the war, German submarines like U-151 attacked ships outside the port. In 1926, Dr. W.A.R. Goodwin, rector of Williamsburg's Bruton Parish Church, began restoration of colonial-era buildings in the historic district with financial backing of John D.

25|$|Lactic acid is {{produced}} industrially by bacterial fermentation of carbohydrates (sugar, starch) or by chemical synthesis from acetaldehyde, {{that is available}} from coal or crude oil. In 2009 lactic acid was produced predominantly (70-90%) by fermentation. Production of racemic lactic acid consisting of a 1:1 mixture of D and L stereoisomers, or of mixtures with up to 99.9% L-lactic acid, is possible by microbial fermentation. <b>Industrial</b> <b>scale</b> <b>production</b> of D-lactic acid by fermentation is possible, but much more challenging.|$|E
25|$|First Lord of the Admiralty Winston Churchill {{became aware}} of the {{possible}} use of Weizmann's discovery in early 1915, and Minister of Munitions David Lloyd George joined Churchill in encouraging Weizmann's development of the process. Pilot plant development of laboratory procedures was completed in 1915 at the J Nicholson & Co gin factory in Bow, London, so <b>industrial</b> <b>scale</b> <b>production</b> of acetone could begin in six British distilleries requisitioned for the purpose in early 1916. The effort produced 30,000 tonnes of acetone during the war, although a national collection of horse-chestnuts was required when supplies of maize were inadequate for the quantity of starch needed for fermentation. The importance of Weizmann's work gave him favour {{in the eyes of the}} British Government, this allowed Weizmann to have access to senior Cabinet members and utilise this time to represent Zionist aspirations.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. A monomer {{processing}} reactor is {{a device}} to process used cooking oil into new substance {{that can be used}} for other applications. In this study, used cooking oil was converted to monomer via simple reactor comprised of stirrer started with laboratory scale of 2 L to 5 L of monomer <b>production.</b> A <b>scale</b> up process is an important process for approaching <b>industrial</b> <b>scale</b> <b>productions.</b> The <b>scale</b> up process was increased to pilot scale before it reaches to <b>industrial</b> <b>scale.</b> The reactor is designed based on lab scale process for producing monomer from used cooking oil. The most important point of the device design is to produce larger amount of monomer compared to lab scale equipment. The device can produce 15 liters of monomer per production. The monomer has the same properties and quality of monomer that were produced using laboratory equipment...|$|R
