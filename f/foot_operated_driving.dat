5000|$|Originally {{developed}} as a racing prototype, the production model was essentially a race replica. Various modifications and improvements were made over the ten years of production. Early models had a 'pent roof' four valve head, with two pairs of valves operating on parallel slopes like a 'pitched roof', which was replaced in 1932 with a radial four valve head and an option of a <b>foot</b> <b>operated</b> gear change. This <b>foot</b> pedal <b>operated</b> both {{the front and rear}} brakes, with a hand lever also operating the front brake. With a top speed of over , the Rudge Ulster was advertised as [...] "probably the fastest 500cc motorcycle in production".|$|R
50|$|Its {{fuselage}} {{was built}} from GRP/balsa sandwich. The FVA-20 had a T-tail, their planes built {{as those of}} the wings. The tailplane was fixed, carrying elevators fitted with Háhnle trim tabs. Its single seat cockpit was enclosed by a single-piece, forward hinged canopy. It landed on a retractable, unsprung, monowheel undercarriage aided by a tail bumper. The mainwheel had a <b>foot</b> <b>operated</b> brake.|$|R
50|$|The modern timpani {{evolved in}} the 18th and 19th centuries from the simple 12th-century membranophone of the Naker to a complex instrument, {{consisting}} of a suspended kettle with a <b>foot</b> <b>operated</b> clutch, capable of rapid tuning. The technological evolution of the instrument led to increased interest in its capabilities and sound among such composers as Ludwig van Beethoven, Robert Schumann, and Hector Berlioz.|$|R

50|$|The first Austel 1000 MK1 {{prototype}} {{was built}} in 1981 for Chris's own use and this was closely by the MK2 which was built for local businessman John Kemp. These bikes had 1000cc Mini engines with <b>foot</b> <b>operated</b> automatic gear boxes (including reverse), side mounted radiators, chain drive, Yamaha alloy wheels, Austel leading link forks and were named Lotec due to the simplicity of design.|$|R
50|$|Unusually, {{for this}} class of vehicle, all {{versions}} were equipped with a very reliable fully automatic three-speed gearbox, with the primary method of drive being a chain.The CS50 and CS80 are virtually mechanically identical, the main differences being a two-person seat, larger brakes (<b>foot</b> <b>operated</b> on rear) and larger headlight on CS80. The CS125 is almost entirely different and shares very few interchangeable parts.|$|R
50|$|Driving {{simulators}} {{are used}} at research facilities for many purposes. Some vehicle manufacturers <b>operate</b> <b>driving</b> simulators. Many universities also operate simulators for research. In addition to studying driver training issues, driving simulators allow researchers to study driver behavior under {{conditions in which}} it would be illegal and/or unethical to place drivers. For instance, studies of driver distraction would be dangerous and unethical (because of the inability to obtain informed consent from other drivers) {{to do on the}} road.|$|R

50|$|The European Chrysler Voyager {{was first}} {{released}} in 1988, {{nearly identical to}} its American counterpart, the Plymouth Voyager; the only visual {{differences between the two}} were the head/taillights and grille. Besides the slightly different appearance, the European Voyagers were sold with different engines, including diesel engines, which are popular in Europe; and the trim was different. They were also available with manual transmission and a <b>foot</b> <b>operated</b> emergency brake.|$|R
50|$|The gearbox {{of the car}} {{was also}} novel, having dual {{epicyclic}} gears and being bolted directly to the engine. This allowed four speeds, with direct drive in top gear. All the gears were helical, and enclosed in an oil bath, making for very silent transmission. Reverse gear was built into the rear axle, as was the <b>foot</b> <b>operated</b> brake drum, all of which was housed in a substantial aluminium casing.|$|R
50|$|Scissors or shears are hand {{operated}} cutting instruments. For people without hands, {{there is also}} the option of using a specially designed <b>foot</b> <b>operated</b> style. They consist of a pair of metal blades connected {{in such a way that}} the blades meet and cut. Scissors are used for cutting various thin materials, such as paper, cardboard, metal foil, thin plastic, cloth, rope, and wire. Scissors can also be used to cut hair and food.|$|R
50|$|The rear axle, {{like the}} gearbox and engine, was housed in an {{aluminium}} case. In {{addition to the}} normal function of providing a differential, it also provided the reverse gear, and contained the rear brake (<b>foot</b> <b>operated).</b> Reversing is achieved by changing which of the large bevel gears (these days known as crown wheels) engages with the drive {{on the end of}} the propshaft. Like the gearbox, all gears within the axle are helical cut.|$|R
40|$|Abstract — This paper {{describes}} {{a study of}} different remotely <b>operated</b> <b>driving</b> modes applied to rhombic like vehicles using the digital buttons and the analog sticks of a generic game controller device (e. g., joysticks and gamepads). The performance of the different modes was evaluated using a software simulator and a 2 D model of the Tokamak building of ITER. Several experiments were performed taking into account relevant parameters, such as {{the distance to the}} obstacles and accelerations. An optimal approach for a real implementation with a rhombic like vehicle prototype is proposed and discussed...|$|R

50|$|The {{directional}} control was by two hand control grips with firing buttons. The left foot controlled the reflector sight range reticle. The right <b>foot</b> <b>operated</b> a push-to-talk intercom switch. The turret was electrically powered in azimuth and altitude. An emergency hand crank could {{be attached to}} reposition the turret from inside the aircraft fuselage. In {{the event of a}} power failure another crewman would use this to crank the turret into the vertical position to allow the gunner to exit.|$|R
50|$|The {{standard}} Somerset interior contained two {{close fitting}} front seats, finished in leather, {{which could be}} arranged as a bench seat and a large deeply cushioned rear bench seat which could accommodate three passengers. With a centrally mounted dashboard or instrument panel, Austin incorporated a four speed, plus reverse, gearbox into the car's design which was controlled by a column mounted gear change lever. Four wheel, <b>foot</b> <b>operated</b> hydraulic brakes and a handbrake operating on the rear wheels only provided the car's stopping power.|$|R
40|$|We {{present a}} {{retrospective}} study of 25 <b>feet</b> <b>operated</b> for an overriding second toe deformity, {{whether or not}} associated with hallux valgus deformity and metatarsalgia. The surgical technique of a medial sliding and decompressive Weil osteotomy is described. All patients, operated between January 2002 and December 2007 for this condition in our institution, were reviewed clinically and radiologically. The mean AOFAS score improved with 47. 6 points from 45. 9 to 93. 5. The theoretical advantages of such a translation Weil osteotomy are discussed trying to clarify the previously described pathologic anatomy of this condition...|$|R
50|$|In {{addition}} Advance made a 6 hp Forecar, and 6 and 9 hp Tricars, all {{of which}} were available with air- or water-cooled engines. These Forecars were fitted out by Chater-Lea, including the sprung chassis and two-speed gearbox which also had a neutral position. The brakes were <b>foot</b> <b>operated</b> and all controls were contained within the steering wheel. The 9 hp Tricar had trembler coil ignition and was cooled by twin radiators with a belt-driven pump. The Chater-Lea three-speed gearbox also had a reverse gear, and front and rear seats had springing for comfort.|$|R
