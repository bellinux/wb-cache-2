5|$|Discovered in 1834 by Johann Friedrich Engelhardt and {{described}} {{three years later}} by Hermann von Meyer, Plateosaurus was the fifth named dinosaur genus that is still considered valid. Although it had been described before Richard Owen formally named Dinosauria in 1842, it {{was not one of}} the three genera used by Owen to define the group, because at the time, it was poorly known and difficult to identify as a dinosaur. It is now among the dinosaurs best known to science: over 100 skeletons have been found, some of them nearly complete. The abundance of its fossils in Swabia, <b>Germany,</b> <b>has</b> led to the nickname Schwäbischer Lindwurm (Swabian lindworm).|$|E

5|$|<b>Germany</b> <b>has</b> an {{installed}} capacity {{of wind and}} solar that can exceed daily demand, and has been exporting peak power to neighboring countries, with exports which amounted to some 14.7 billion kWh in 2012.

Just as the EU requires member countries to maintain 90 days strategic reserves of oil it can be expected that countries will provide electric power storage, instead of expecting to use their neighbors for net metering.|$|E
5|$|<b>Germany</b> <b>has</b> {{come under}} {{pressure}} due to {{not having a}} government budget deficit and funding it by borrowing more.
