500|$|On 13 February 1969, Negus and {{two others}} (Sir Geoffrey Keynes and Sir Stanford Cade) were {{presented}} with the Honorary Gold Medal of the Royal College of Surgeons of England. This award, which had only been made thirty times since 1802 prior to the 1969 ceremony, is presented for [...] "liberal acts or distinguished labours, researches and discoveries, eminently conducive to the improvement of natural knowledge and of the healing art." [...] The medal was presented by Sir Hedley Atkins, the President of the Royal College of Surgeons, who paid tribute to Negus: [...] "Sir Victor Negus {{is perhaps the most}} distinguished of all those who have served the Council as a co-opted member. He has always been known to us as a great research worker and scientist, whose labours earned him the Lister Medal, a man of exceptional integrity and industry and a persistent advocate of the value of tradition in its best sense." [...] Atkins also paid tribute to Negus's wife, Lady Negus, who had crafted and presented to the college a tapestry of its coat-of-arms. Responding, Negus thanked the members of the Council for the award and for the privilege of having used college facilities since 1921, concluding: [...] "I take this honour as a mark of approval for any work I have done, and I feel I can now sit back and leave it to others to carry on. <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>also</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> thank you for inviting my wife to be here to-day; she has taken a great part in all I have done." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "Growing up in America, these Latvian diplomats {{were our}} heroes. Legends, who {{during the years}} of {{occupation}} embodied the Republic of Latvia in our minds. I learned Latvia's history from Arnold Spekke's and Anatols Dinbergs' books. We called Anatols Dinbergs our chief, but I also think of him as my diplomatic foster father and teacher. All that is the most important that I have learned about diplomacy, has come from Anatols Dinbergs. He has reached singular achievements in his lifetime. <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>also</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> emphasize that Anatols Dinbergs was not only Latvia's first ambassador to the United States, he was, in fact, the first Latvian ambassador in history (until Latvia's occupation in 1940 our country had emissaries; it was only with the restoration of state independence in 1991 that the position of ambassador was created -J.Ū.). The task of diplomats in exile was to preserve Latvia's sovereignty. [...] Our diplomatic mission today is to preserve the Latvian state, so that no Latvian ever has to flee into exile." ...|$|E
2500|$|McCaughey died of {{lung cancer}} on 8 February 2006. He was {{believed}} to have contracted cancer over a year previously and was thought to be in remission after treatment. The local Ballymena Times reported, [...] "McCaughey apparently underwent a 'Road To Damascus' style conversion - supporting the peace process and leading a campaign against Neo Nazis". A tribute was also reported from a leading Irish Trade Unionist Peter Bunting. Bunting's father was once held at gun point by McCaughey in 1971 due to the fact he was a Catholic and was forced to leave his job. Bunting stated [...] "Billy McCaughey was prepared to kill for what he saw as his people. At the end of his days, he had lived for more people than he could have ever dreamed about in 1971. <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>also</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> think that, if my father had lived long enough to witness the full life of Billy McCaughey, then he too would have recognised him as a brother and a comrade." [...] David Ervine described him as having an [...] "immense effect on people's attitudes." [...] He was buried in his native Ahoghill.|$|E

2500|$|... {{on behalf}} of some 132 cosponsors, {{introduced}} this measure. <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>also</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> thank Mr. Lampson from Texas as the Chairman of the Caucus on Missing and Exploited Children, and Mr. Ose from the State of California, who have devoted {{much of their time}} to raising our level of awareness of the growing problem of international child abduction. [...] We are taking action on this measure {{on behalf of}} the parents of our abducted and wrongfully retained children. These left-behind parents have put their faith and trust in an international agreement, The Hague Convention, which is clear and explicit on the obligation of signatory governments to return an abducted or wrongfully retained child to his or her country of habitual residence. Nevertheless, we have found that in a number of nations, for a variety of reasons, this does not occur, and the resultant frustration, heartbreak and outrage has led us to act on the measure before us today. [...] I should also add {{that we need to have}} our State Department do more to promote compliance with The Hague Convention. The return of an abducted or illegally retained child should be on the top of the Secretary’s meetings with any official of a country involved in such cases. [...] This is not a problem that should be handled as a routine exchange of diplomatic notes or phone calls by junior U.S. officials to their foreign counterparts. We need to see some concern and some concrete actions by the highest levels of our government to redress what is, evidently, a growing international problem. [...] It is our hope that by adopting this resolution, and sending it to the floor for speedy action, we will send a strong signal that this is an issue that we care deeply about. We need to get the attention of the Governments of Germany, Sweden, Austria, Mexico, and Honduras that they cannot expect The Hague Convention to be a one-way street.|$|E

5000|$|The Home Front Defense Ministry was a {{ministry}} in the Israeli government. The post {{was created for}} Matan Vilnai by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on January 19, 2011.
