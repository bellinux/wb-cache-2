5|$|Allan Cunningham sent seed of G.juniperina to England in 1820; it {{was grown}} there the {{following}} year. Baron Charles von Hügel grew the species in Vienna in 1831. It has been grown outdoors in southern England, particularly G. juniperina subspecies sulphurea. Grevillea juniperina adapts easily to cultivation and {{grows in a}} wide range of soils and aspects in locations with good drainage. Long-flowering, it attracts birds such as honeyeaters with its nectar. The prickly dense foliage is also a good nesting site and shelter, particularly for smaller birds, such as finches. Many forms and hybrids have been commercially propagated and sold, some having more horticultural appeal than others. Low winter temperatures promote more prolific flowering and pruning promotes dense <b>foliage.</b> <b>Plants</b> are readily propagated by cuttings or seed, although propagation by cuttings is required to ensure the new plants have the same characteristics of the parent. Direct contact with the plant may cause a skin rash.|$|E

60|$|Cecil {{depended}} on {{her more than}} on any one else for sympathy, not expressly in feeling, but in all her pursuits. In three years' time Sirenwood was in perfect order, the once desolate garden blazed with ribbons, triangles and pattipans of verbena, scarlet geranium and calceolaria, with intervals of echiverias, pronounced by Tom to be like cabbages trying to turn into copper kettles; her <b>foliage</b> <b>plants</b> got all the prizes at horticultural shows, her poultry were incomparable at their exhibitions, her cottages were models, her school machinery perfect, and if a pattern in farming apparatus were wanted, people went to Mrs. Raymond Poynsett's steward. She had people of note {{to stay with her}} every winter, went to London for the season, and was made much of, and all the time she looked as little, and pinched, and weary, and heart-hungered as ever, and never seemed to thaw or warm, clinging to no one but to Miles for counsel, and to Rosamond for the fellow-feeling it was not always easy to give--when it was apparently only about an orchid or a churn--and yet Rosamond tried, for she knew it was starvation for sympathy.|$|E
60|$|The little harbour opened {{from the}} sea between towering cliffs, and behind a lonely rock, pierced with many caves and blow-holes through which the sea in storm time sent its thunderous voice, {{together}} with a fountain of drifting spume. Hence, it wound westwards in a serpentine course, guarded at its entrance by two little curving piers to left and right. These were roughly built of dark slates placed endways and held together with great beams bound with iron bands. Thence, it flowed up the rocky bed of the stream whose winter torrents had of old cut out its way amongst the hills. This stream was deep at first, with here and there, where it widened, patches of broken rock exposed at low water, full of holes where crabs and lobsters were to {{be found at the}} ebb of the tide. From amongst the rocks rose sturdy posts, used for warping in the little coasting vessels which frequented the port. Higher up, the stream still flowed deeply, for the tide ran far inland, but always calmly for all the force of the wildest storm was broken below. Some quarter mile inland the stream was deep at high water, but at low tide there were at each side patches of the same broken rock as lower down, through the chinks of which the sweet water of the natural stream trickled and murmured after the tide had ebbed away. Here, too, rose mooring posts for the fishermen's boats. At either side of the river was a row of cottages down almost on the level of high tide. They were pretty cottages, strongly and snugly built, with trim narrow gardens in front, full of old-fashioned plants, flowering currants, coloured primroses, wallflower, and stonecrop. Over the fronts of many of them climbed clematis and wisteria. The window sides and door posts of all were as white as snow, and the little pathway to each was paved with light coloured stones. At some of the doors were tiny porches, whilst at others were rustic seats cut from tree trunks or from old barrels; in nearly every case the window ledges were filled with boxes or pots of flowers or <b>foliage</b> <b>plants.</b>|$|E

40|$|Flowering or <b>foliage</b> potted <b>plants</b> are {{ornamental}} items usually {{grown in}} greenhouses under optimal growing conditions. Cultivation in protected environments allows for rapid growth and high quality characteristics. When plants reach the desired commercial size {{they can be}} transferred to hardening greenhouses or directly sent to the distribution chain. The growing and post-production conditions such as storage and transportation can have very deleterious effects on the ornamental quality of plants. The major post-production disorders are bud and flower abscission in flowering potted plants or leaf abscission or yellowing in <b>foliage</b> potted <b>plants.</b> On the other hand, the ornamental quality of potted plants is extremely important and depends on the number and colour of flowers or leaves, flower, leaf and plant longevity. The presence of flowers on flowering potted plants depends on flower longevity and turnover. The colour and size of leaves of <b>foliage</b> potted <b>plants</b> is linked to pre- and post-production environmental conditions. The post-production quality losses of flowering potted plants can be mainly ascribed to natural flower senescence. This phenomenon is highly regulated by plant hormones such as ethylene and abscisic acid, but the post-production environment can dramatically influence plant hormone equilibrium. Quality losses of <b>foliage</b> potted <b>plants</b> are mainly due to leaf senescence usually associated with inadequate acclimatization from the production area to the post-production chain...|$|R
