They were tested in a land based rig and their performances {{compared with that of}} the conventional bearing. The novel bearings demonstrated the ability to suppress <b>journal</b> <b>centre</b> orbits, to reposition the <b>journal</b> <b>centre</b> in any direction, and to operate with significantly reduced temperature rise. One of the bearings also demonstrated the ability to translate the <b>journal</b> <b>centre</b> in a controlled manner by an amount exceeding double the clearance of the conventional bearing.

40|$|The {{coefficient}} of friction of journal bearing is usually shown as μ_f = H√ZN/p, where Z stands for lubricant viscosity, N for rotational speed of Jonrnal, P for load applied per unit projected bearing area, H for the function concerning the position of <b>journal</b> <b>centre.</b> 　It has generally been thought that μ_f is decided chiefly by √ZN/p, because the effect of H is not so eminent. But varying the bearing clearance by means of inserting shims between the two half bearings of 50 mm diameter and 68 mm long, under the condition of N = 258 - 1224 rpm and p = 1. 48 -l 4. 12 kg/cm^ 2, we measured the {{coefficient of}} friction of the bearing and gained the following results :　 1. The particular clearance is found where μ_f is minimum for each bearing load; the larger the bearing load, the smaller the clearance is, and the bigger the journal speed, the larger the clearance becomes. 　 2. This change of μ_f is due to H, that is, the {{coefficient of friction}} of the bearing is affected not only by √ZN/p but also greatly by the position of <b>journal</b> <b>centre.</b> 　 3. Even though ZN/p is constant, μ_f is not unique, because H does change. We found the coefficient of friction became smaller {{as the number of}} revolution of the journal became greater for the constant value of ZN/p...|$|E
40|$|In the {{theoretical}} analysis of high speed rotor bearing systems, {{it is common}} to use four displacement and four velocity based coefficients, which characterise the behaviour of the lubricating fluid film. Although a great deal of work has been published establishing theoretical models of all types of hydrodynamic journal bearings, the large amount of experimental work has centred on relatively low speed conditions. This work presents a contribution to the experimental study of the static and dynamic characteristics of oil films in journal bearings used in high-speed rotating machinery. The main objectives of the work are: • To devise new experimental techniques for the measurement of dynamic coefficients suitable for use at high rotational speeds • To design, manufacture, assemble and commission a test facility to measure the static and dynamic characteristics of journal bearings at speeds up to 30000 rpm • To determine the static and dynamic characteristics of a 5 Pad Tilting Pad Journal Bearing Unit of 80 mm diameter at speeds up to 25 000 rpm using the said test facility. New techniques are particularly necessary for the measurement of velocity coefficients because these invoke the necessity of imposing a velocity on to the bearing housing and previous techniques have utilised synchronous motion of the bearing. Consequently a new experimental procedure for measuring the four velocity or damping coefficients of an oil film journal bearing from imposed dynamic "orbits" has been devised called the "double pulse" technique. All four velocity coefficients are derived from one imposed <b>journal</b> <b>centre</b> dynamic orbit and, therefore may be regarded as being obtained at the same time. The method requires the production of a "cross- over" point similar to that of a "figure of eight" shaped orbit and utilises the "cross-over" point therein. Coefficients are initially evaluated in a co-ordinate system, which is chosen to align with the designated parts of the measured orbit. Each coefficient is then evaluated from single values of instantaneous imposed force and resulting <b>journal</b> <b>centre</b> velocity. Coefficients are them converted into any other desired axes system. The result is a simpler experimental procedure, with reduced uncertainty compared to hitherto existing methods. The use of non-sinusoidal excitation of the oil film was explored, in the form of applying a step-pulse train load pattern to produce a cross-over pattern in the journal displacement ·orbit'. Experimental tests were completed on a tilting pad bearing at speeds up to 15 000 rpm inclusive. At speeds above this, the bearing exhibited a vibrational response, which precluded the accurate measurement of <b>journal</b> <b>centre</b> displacement...|$|E

40|$|Tilting pad {{bearings}} offer unique {{dynamic stability}} enabling successful deployment of high-speed rotating machinery.

40|$|Abstract: This work {{deals with}} the {{modelling}} of lubricated revolute joints in multibody mechanical systems. In most machines and mechanisms, the joints are designed to operate with some lubricant fluid. The high press-ures generated in the lubricant fluid act to keep the journal and the bearing apart. Moreover, the thin film formed by lubricant reduces friction and wear, provides load capacity and adds damping to dissipate undesirable mech-anical vibrations. In the dynamic analysis of journal–bearings, the hydrodynamic forces, which include both squeeze and wedge effects, produced by the lubricant fluid oppose the journal motion.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{concerned}} with the development of a nunerical technique for the computational analysis of ruptured liquid films in both steadily and dynamically loaded bearings. The approach is based on the principle of oil flow continuity. A cavitation algorithm, proposed by H. G. Elrod, was implemented for studies of hydrodynamic lubrication in infinitely long cylinder/plane bearings (i. e. non-conformal contacts) under combined sliding, rolling and normal motion. Difficulties involved in the implementation of this algorithm were investigated in great depth. A new 'improved' method of solution, which is well-suited to the computational analyses of steadily and dynamically loaded bearings, was developed. The improved technique involves the solution of the hydrodynamic lubrication problem for oil film pressures or degrees of lubricant filling in the full film and cavitated regions of a bearing. Detailed studies of cylinder/plane under conditions of both instantaneous and sinusoidal normal motion were performed. The improved solution was shown to facilitate the implicit implementation of the Jakobsson-Floberg- 011 son boundary conditions (i. e. the inclusion of 'oil film history' phencinena) in dynamically loaded bearing analyses. Detailed comparisons between the oil film history and classical solutions, and published experimental studies were made. Computer programs based on the classical Reynolds equation and the improved method of solution were developed for the analysis of circuTiferentially grooved, finite journal bearings operating under steady-state and dynamic loading conditions. The improved method of solution produced more realistic predictions of performance characteristics, particularly oil film extent, oil flow and bearing power loss. Comprehensive comparisons with published theoretical and experimental studies were made. Encouraging agrenent was obtained between the oil flow continuity analyses and experiments. <b>Journal</b> <b>centre</b> orbit analyses of dynamically loaded bearings, typically found in reciprocating engines, indicated that the oil film history solution may reveal a nunber of new features of time-varying performance characteristics not previously predicted by the classical Reynolds solution...|$|E

40|$|The {{influence}} of the lubricated joint model on the dynamic response of mechanical systems is investigated throughout this work. In the process, under {{the framework of the}} multibody systems formulation, a comprehensive methodology for modelling lubricated revolute joints is presented. This methodology uses the superposition principle for the load capacity due to the wedge effect entrainment and squeeze film effect separately. The hydrodynamic forces are obtained by integrating the pressure distribution evaluated with the aid of Reynolds’ equation written for the dynamic regime. The hydrodynamic forces are nonlinear functions of the <b>journal</b> <b>centre</b> position and of its velocity with reference to the bearing centre.

The numerical models for normal and tangential contact forces are reviewed. In a similar way to the lubricated model, in this case, the contact-impact forces developed during the contact are evaluated and introduced into the equations of motion of the mechanical system. The main assumptions and procedures adopted in this work are demonstrated through the numerical results obtained from computational simulations of a planar slider-crank mechanism, which includes a revolute joint with clearance. Furthermore, the global results produced with the different lubricated models are compared to those obtained when the revolute joint is modelled as a dry joint.
