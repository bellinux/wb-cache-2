40|$|Extensive {{analysis}} of flat-plate radiative panels operation using average hourly weather data for a maritime climate region was performed. The panels are integrated {{in the space}} ventilation system with air-cooling {{by means of a}} cold-water coil. Their primary function is to prepare sufficient quantity of cold water, integrating radiative and convective cooling, that is collected in the cold-water tank during the nighttime operation. That cold water is used for cooling of the air during daytime. By small modification during daytime, solar panels could be turned into collectors and used to produce the hot water that is collected in a separate tank. A simulation model for the parametric {{analysis of}} the system in summer operating conditions and influence of its components on the system 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>operation</b> was developed.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the paper is to analyze and improve the {{transient}} stability of an industrial {{combined heat and power}} (CHP) system in a high-tech science park in Taiwan. The CHP system installed two 161 [*]kV/ 161 [*]kV high-impendence transformers to connect with Taipower System (TPS) for both decreasing the short-circuit fault current and increasing the fault critical clearing time. The transient stabilities of three types of operation modes in CHP units, 3 G 1 S, 2 G 1 S, and 1 G 1 S, are analyzed. Under the 3 G 1 <b>S</b> <b>operation</b> mode, the system frequency is immediately restored to 60 [*]Hz after tie line tripping with the TPS.

The proposed rules aim at generating competitive prices based on monitoring the microgrid 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>operation</b> conditions, thus maximising the profit from selling electricity to the utility grid throughout the microgrid 2 ̆ 7 s lifetime. A decision tree based linear programming and fuzzy system are developed to generate the proposed rules. Microgrid 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>operation</b> conditions such as electricity demand, generation price and amount of generation are considered in the generated pricing rules. To simulate the behaviour of electronic competition, we have implemented a Multi-Agent System (MAS) to represent the performance of two competitive sellers and one buyer under uniform and discriminatory pricing rules. As a case study, our proposed pricing rules are tested on the power grid of the Joondalup campus of Edith Cowan University in Western Australia. Simulation studies for 30 -minutes operation intervals for the developed virtual market pool with the adaptive microgird pricing strategies have recorded beneficiary sale prices with a reasonable number of electricity trade participations...|$|R

40|$|Psalm 104 {{paints a}} picture of Yahweh dressed in the royal robes of both Aten and Baal. The variety of {{references}} to Ancient Near Eastern gods points to a rich and complicated history {{of the origins of}} Psalm 104, Israel and Israelite theology. The origins of Psalm 104 in all likelyhood include oral traditions, cultic contexts and years of redactional rearrangement and rewriting. Akhenaten used a centralised cult and monolatrism to achieve political stability in Egypt. Years later Hammurabi used Marduk as chief deity in Babylonia to centralise power and create political and religious stability in his kingdom. It is within this Ancient Near Eastern tradition of using religion and one specific deity to achieve political stability that Psalm 104 finds its origins and cultic context. The early Israelite monarchy finds itself amidst uncertain political circumstances. The early kings used a centralised monarchy and monolatrism to achieve economic and political stability. The early Israelite government also used other Egyptian influences including governing methods, policies and the use of Egyptian scribes. The monarchy used cultic personal to communicate politically sanctioned theology and contact between cultic personal and Egyptian scribes intertwined with a Canaanite heritage has a cosmopolitan and culturally diverse Psalm 104 at its end. The psalm is used as a war liturgy, with Chaoskampf-motifs to legitimise the Israelite <b>king</b> <b>s</b> military action and kingship.
