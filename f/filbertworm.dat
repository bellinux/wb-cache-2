40|$|The {{targeted}} {{application of}} prescribed fire {{has long been}} used by Native Californian peoples to manage plant resources of cultural value. Their ability to employ this management tool has been increasingly restricted by local, {{state and federal agencies}} in response to recent drought conditions and the highly flammable state of most western U. S. forests, where, for decades, fires of any magnitude have been suppressed as a matter of policy. This diminished access to cultural prescribed fire has impacted tribal access to many of the plant resources and cultural activities upon which Karuk and Yurok cultures are based. The research presented in this dissertation: 1) uses historical and modern references to describe fire management practices of tribes throughout California, specifically targeting acorns as food resource, 2) investigates the effect of non-traditional spring burns on rates of tanoak (Notholithocarpus densiflorus, Fagaceae) acorn infestation by frugivorous <b>Filbertworms</b> (Cydia latiferreana, Tortricidae) and Filbert weevil larvae (Curculio occidentalis, Curculionidae), 3) evaluates the effectiveness of indigenous acorn collection criteria in correctly assessing the consumption quality of acorns, and 4) examines the responses of culturally significant plant species found in tanoak gathering areas to prescribed fire applied non-traditionally in spring. Assessed metrics were species diversity, species richness, and vegetative cover. Traditionally, fires used to maintain productive heritage tanoak stands were set in late summer and fall. However, prescribed burns {{at this time of year}} have become very difficult to implement, so this study focused on the responses of the assemblages to a more easily executed, spring burn. During the two year study of acorn infestation rates in response to fire, I found that spring prescribed fire reduced acorn infestation in both the year of the fire and one year post-fire. Indigenous acorn collection criteria were very effective in distinguishing edible acorns from both inedible and insect-infested acorns. However, the traditional method of acorn evaluation did misclassify a sizeable proportion of the acorns as inedible, when they were actually of good food quality. Intended or not, this conservative misidentification provides added insurance that insect-infected acorns are not added to those stored within a household for future use. Over the three years that the responses of culturally valuable understory taxa to fire were monitored, all three metrics (species diversity, species richness, and vegetative cover) were sharply reduced by fire. Species diversity and richness showed substantial recovery by the second post-fire year, but neither had fully recovered. Understory plant cover showed very little, in any, recovery two years after the experimental fires. In particular, the percent cover of tanoak seedlings and lignotuber sprouts were greatly reduced, which may increase visibility of abscised acorns to tribal gatherers. As a single cultural fire targets multiple resource goals, these results indicate that some, but not all, resource goals traditionally achieved with fall fire were met with spring prescribed fire...|$|R
40|$|The <b>filbertworm</b> infests all {{hazelnut}} growing areas of Oregon. • During most years, the <b>filbertworm</b> damages 20 % of the hazelnuts in untreated orchards. • Hazelnut shipments are rejected by nut processors {{if more than}} 1 % <b>filbertworm</b> infestation is present. • Insecticide sprays reduce <b>filbertworm</b> damage to 0. 13 %. Technical Summary The cultivated hazelnut was introduced from Europe {{to the west coast}} of the U. S. during the late 1800 s. Commercial production of hazelnuts (then called “filberts”) began in the 1920 s. Oregon’s hazelnut orchards, concentrated in the Willamette Valley account for 99 % of U. S. hazelnut production and 5 % of world production. Oregon’s harvest of hazelnuts ranks third in the world after Turkey and Italy. Oregon growers produce 86 million pounds of hazelnuts with a value of $ 46 million from 28, 000 acres. Shelled nuts account for 53 % of the market while nuts in the shell comprise the remaining 47 %. Hazelnuts emerge from a husk and drop to the ground where they are collected. Orego...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Two-hundred shoots {{contained}} within randomly selected locations {{from each of}} thirty-six coast live oak, Quercus agrifolia, trees were sampled to determine the abundance and spatial distribution of acorns infested by the filbert weevil, Curculio occidentis in northern California during 1989. The seasonal abundance of infested acorns was highest at 30 percent during mid-September. Overall, 25 percent of all acorns ob-served on sample trees revealed signs of boring insect activity. Slightly higher infestation rate of 38 percent was obtained from laboratory dissections of field collected acorns (n = 501). Of those acorns dissected in the laboratory found to contain insect larvae, 70 percent contained C. occidentis and 30 percent con-tained the <b>filbertworm,</b> Melissopus latiferreanus. Although acorns were numerous on the sunny side of the tree, infested acorns were more abundant on the shady side. The differential distribution of acorns spatially within trees, acorn survivorship, {{and the impact of}} insect and other animal acorn predators on acorn production are discussed. The sweeping branches of a large regal oak is a vision common to all of us. As a single tree or forest stand, our native oaks {{play an important role in}} wildlife and human ecologies. In California there are 18 species of oaks, 10 of which reach tree size (Tucker 1980; Griffin and Muick 1990). The total acreage for California's oak species has been estimated at 15 - 20 million acres (Plumb and McDonald 1981). For thousands of years, native oaks have been a prominent and persistent floral feature in California. Unfortunately, it now appears many of our oak woodlands have been drastically reduced and are poorly regen...|$|E
40|$|Cydia Hübner 1825 is a genus of moths in {{the family}} Tortricidae with 231 named species and {{subspecies}} and is distributed on all continents except Antarctica. As larvae, many species feed within reproductive structures, such as fruits, seeds, and flowers, under bark, or within fleshy stems of at least 65 host-plant species including angiosperms and conifers. Many species, including codling moth, pea moth, spruce seed moth, pine seedworms, <b>filbertworm,</b> and hickory shuckworm are considered pests of agriculture and forestry. As a result, the biology, natural enemies, and pheromones of several species have been well-studied. The nomenclature and classification of Cydia has also been well-studied but is less resolved. Nineteen different genus names have been proposed for species in this genus, with Laspeyresia Hübner, and Carpocapsa Treitschke being in common usage until relatively recently. Following the rules governing the International Code of Zoological Nomenclature, Cydia is the valid genus name for all species congeneric with the codling moth, Cydia pomonella (Linnaeus), the type species of the genus. The relationship of Cydia to other genera in the tribe Grapholitini is a topic of continued debate. Some authors {{have suggested that the}} tribe is an evolutionary grade while others have presented evidence that Grapholitini is a monophyletic clade. Although some secondary sexual characters have been proposed, the genus Cydia can claim no synapomorphies that can be found in all Cydia species. To better understand the systematics and evolution of this group more detailed morphological, molecular, and ecological data are needed for non-pest species. At least 21 endemic species of Cydia are known from the Hawaiian Islands. Males of most species have a ventral pouch below the cubital vein of the hindwings similar to C. latiferreana (Walsingham), C. maackiana (Danilevsky), and several other Cydia species to a lesser extent, although this feature appears to have arisen independently in the Hawaiian group. Larvae, where known, feed on endemic plants {{in the family}} Fabaceae. Identification of species is made difficult by extreme polymorphism of wing patterns for some widespread species and a general reduction of morphological features in the genitalia of male moths, while some features of female genitalia, particularly the antrum and lamella postvaginalis, have diagnostic value. Eight new species of Hawaiian Cydia are described (C. mauiensis n. sp., C. velocilimitata n. sp., C. haleakalaensis n. sp., C. makai n. sp., C. koaiae n. sp., C. hawaiiensis n. sp., C. acaciavora n. sp., and C. anomalosa n. sp.) based on wing patterns and features of male and female genitalia. The thirteen previously known species are redescribed because original descriptions were inconsistent among authors and based solely on wing patterns. Distributions, host-plant affinities, and natural enemies for each species are discussed. A molecular phylogeny of 66 specimens representing 14 Hawaiian Cydia species plus 20 outgroup species was constructed using nuclear and mitochondrial DNA to assess the relative importance of host-plant affinities and geographic isolation in their diversification. Hawaiian Cydia is monophyletic and nested well-within the genus. They appear to have arrived in the Hawaiian Islands after the rise of Maui based on the basal position of several Maui and Hawaii Island species throughout the phylogeny. The earliest diverging species feed on Canavalia and dispersed across the high islands. Subsequent shifts to feeding on Sophora chrysophylla then Acacia koa were followed by speciation and the filling of these niches across the islands. The origin of Hawaiian Cydia remains obscure, but appears to be a separate colonization of remote Oceania from Cydia pseusomalesana Clarke in French Polynesia. It is likely that several more species of Hawaiian Cydia await discovery while several others probably have gone extinct in the 100 years since they were first collected. A broader survey of outgroup taxa from Asia and the Americas, and more informative genes in a molecular phylogeny may help resolve the origins of Hawaiian Cydia...|$|E
