40|$|We {{introduce}} {{the concept of}} tunable <b>ideal</b> <b>magnetic</b> dipole scattering, where a nonmagnetic nanoparticle scatters lights as a pure magnetic dipole. High refractive index subwavelength nanoparticles usually support both electric and magnetic dipole responses. Thus, to achieve <b>ideal</b> <b>magnetic</b> dipole scattering one has to suppress the electric dipole response. Such a possibility was recently demonstrated for the so-called anapole mode, which is associated with zero electric dipole scattering. By overlapping magnetic dipole resonance with the anapole mode we achieve <b>ideal</b> <b>magnetic</b> dipole scattering in the far-field with tunable high scattering resonances in near infrared spectrum. We demonstrate that such condition can be realized for two subwavelength geometries. One of them is core-shell nanosphere consisting of Au core and silicon shell. It can be also achieved in other geometries, including nanodisks, which are compatible with current nanofabrication technology. Comment: Submit for publication, comments are welcom...|$|R

The scalar Hertz {{potential}} {{technique is}} applied to the field analysis in uniaxial dielectric – <b>magnetic</b> <b>mediums.</b> These mediums may be either homogeneous or nonhomogeneous (with a nonhomogeneity of a restricted form).

40|$|A {{suite of}} {{near-identical}} magnetite nanodot samples produced by electron-beam lithography {{have been used}} to test the thermomagnetic recording fidelity of particles in the 74 – 333 nm size range; the grain size range most commonly found in rocks. In addition to controlled grain size, the samples had identical particle spacings, meaning that intergrain magnetostatic interactions could be controlled. Their magnetic hysteresis parameters were indicative of particles thought not to be <b>ideal</b> <b>magnetic</b> recorders; however, the samples were found to be excellent thermomagnetic recorders of the magnetic field direction. They were also found to be relatively good recorders of the field intensity in a standard paleointensity experiment.
