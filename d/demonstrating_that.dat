50|$|Xu Xing {{described}} Sinornithosaurus {{and performed}} a phylogenetic analysis which <b>demonstrated</b> <b>that</b> it is basal, or primitive, among the dromaeosaurs. He has also <b>demonstrated</b> <b>that</b> {{features of the}} skull and shoulder {{are very similar to}} Archaeopteryx and other Avialae. Together these two facts <b>demonstrate</b> <b>that</b> the earliest dromaeosaurs were more like birds than the later dromaeosaurs were.|$|R

40|$|This Article uses {{canons of}} {{construction}} to <b>demonstrate</b> <b>that</b> textualism, particularly plain language or plain meaning textualism, cannot be applied {{without the use}} of non-textual personal choices. But, this Article does not seek to <b>demonstrate</b> <b>that</b> interpreting the Constitution requires ignoring the text of the Constitution; nor does this Article seek to <b>demonstrate</b> <b>that</b> textualist approaches lack relevance or value. Rather, this Article seeks to <b>demonstrate</b> <b>that</b> textualism cannot create rules that avoid personal predilections and does not create neutral principles or eliminate predilective interpretation. In order to accomplish this goal, this Article reviews a variety of canons of construction and applies them to the Takings Clause...|$|R

5|$|Among the escapees was Henri Giraud, a French General who had {{commanded}} a division in 1940, who escaped from Königstein prison and, despite his pro-Vichy sympathies, joined the Free French in 1943. Jean-Paul Sartre {{also managed to}} escape by forging papers <b>demonstrating</b> <b>that</b> he had a disability, leading to his repatriation.|$|E
5|$|Aviary {{experiments}} {{conducted with}} captive flocks of scaly-breasted munia have tested whether producers and scroungers reach the predicted stable equilibrium frequency (see Evolutionarily stable strategy) when individuals {{are free to}} choose either behavior. The numbers choosing either producers and scrounger strategies {{have been shown to}} converge on stable frequencies while <b>demonstrating</b> <b>that</b> variation in tactics arise through frequency dependent pay-offs from the choice of different feeding strategies.|$|E
25|$|Within a Xenopus nucleus-free system, it {{has been}} <b>demonstrated</b> <b>that</b> Cdc45 is {{required}} for the unwinding of plasmid DNA.

40|$|In recent years, it {{has been}} <b>demonstrated</b> <b>that</b> Hsp 70 is {{released}} in the extracellular space under normal cell culture conditions, and this release is mediated through exosomes. We have <b>demonstrated</b> <b>that</b> A 6 cells, a clone of mouse mesoangioblasts, produce and release in the extracellular space membrane vesicles, independently of culture growth conditions. These vesicles contains both structural proteins and biological active molecules, such as FGF- 2 and the metalloproteinases MMP 2 and 9. We have also <b>demonstrated</b> <b>that</b> A 6 vesicles contain HspP 70 and its release is highly regulated. Some of the intracellular Hsp 70 is localized on lipid rafts and its concentration in insoluble fraction increases after heat shock. Vesicle shedding is influenced by lipid raft integrity, but not so Hsp 70 release. Recent experiments have <b>demonstrated</b> <b>that</b> A 6 vesicles also contain urokinase and tissue-type plasminogen activators (uPA and tPA), both responsible of plasmin activation. These two proteins could be responsible for MMP activation, as reported in other cell lines. Recently {{it has been}} <b>demonstrated</b> <b>that</b> MMP 9 expression depends on Hsp 70, through NF-kB and AP 1 activation. Our preliminary data <b>demonstrated</b> <b>that</b> NM 3 cells, a clone with a 55...|$|R
5|$|Burnet's major {{achievements}} in microbiology included discovering the causative agents of Q-fever and psittacosis; developing assays for the isolation, culture and detection of influenza virus; describing the recombination of influenza strains; <b>demonstrating</b> <b>that</b> the myxomatosis virus {{does not cause}} disease in humans. Modern methods for producing influenza vaccines are still based on Burnet's work improving virus growing processes in hen's eggs.|$|E
5|$|Electron {{microscopy}} {{offers a}} higher resolution image. In an electron microscope, {{a beam of}} focused electrons interacts with the sample rather than {{a beam of light}} as in traditional microscopy. In conjunction with rapid freezing techniques, electron microscopy has also been used to study the mechanisms of inter- and intracellular transport, for instance in <b>demonstrating</b> <b>that</b> exocytotic vesicles are the means of chemical release at synapses.|$|E
5|$|Fear {{response}} in women during two {{different points in}} the menstrual cycle has been examined. When estrogen is highest in the preovulatory stage, women are significantly better at identifying expressions of fear than women who were menstruating, which is when estrogen levels are lowest. The women were equally able to identify happy faces, <b>demonstrating</b> <b>that</b> the fear response was a more powerful response. To summarize, menstrual cycle phase and the estrogen levels correlates with women’s fear processing.|$|E
40|$|We propose {{and motivate}} {{the use of}} vicinal-risk {{minimization}} (VRM) for training genetic programming classifiers. We <b>demonstrate</b> <b>that</b> VRM {{has a number of}} attractive properties and <b>demonstrate</b> <b>that</b> it has a better correlation with generalization error compared to empirical risk minimization (ERM) so is more likely to lead to better generalization performance, in general. From the results of statistical tests over a range of real and synthetic datasets, we further <b>demonstrate</b> <b>that</b> VRM yields consistently superior generalization errors compared to conventional ERM...|$|R

5|$|From 1670 to 1672, Newton lectured on optics. During {{this period}} he {{investigated}} the refraction of light, <b>demonstrating</b> <b>that</b> the multicoloured spectrum {{produced by a}} prism could be recomposed into white light by a lens and a second prism. Modern scholarship has revealed that Newton's analysis and resynthesis of white light owes a debt to corpuscular alchemy.|$|E
5|$|In 1772, the French {{scientist}} Antoine Lavoisier used a lens {{to concentrate}} {{the rays of}} the sun on a diamond in an atmosphere of oxygen, and showed that the only product of the combustion was carbon dioxide, proving that diamond is composed of carbon. Later in 1797, the English chemist Smithson Tennant repeated and expanded that experiment. By <b>demonstrating</b> <b>that</b> burning diamond and graphite releases the same amount of gas, he established the chemical equivalence of these substances.|$|E

5|$|In the Early Modern period, Aristotle came to {{represent}} {{all that was}} obsolete, scholastic, and wrong, not helped by his association with medieval theology. In 1632, Galileo represented Aristotelianism in his Dialogo sopra i due massimi sistemi del mondo by the strawman Simplicio ("Simpleton"). That same year, William Harvey proved Aristotle wrong by <b>demonstrating</b> <b>that</b> blood circulates.|$|E
5|$|In {{the spring}} of 472 BC, Pericles {{presented}} The Persians of Aeschylus at the Greater Dionysia as a liturgy, <b>demonstrating</b> <b>that</b> {{he was one of}} the wealthier men of Athens. Simon Hornblower has argued that Pericles' selection of this play, which presents a nostalgic picture of Themistocles' famous victory at Salamis, shows that the young politician was supporting Themistocles against his political opponent Cimon, whose faction succeeded in having Themistocles ostracized shortly afterwards.|$|E
5|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that Itza Maya from Motul de San José began the northward migration of Maya peoples to the Yucatán Peninsula {{at the end of the}} Classic Period. Classic period stelae at the site refer to the King of the Itzá, <b>demonstrating</b> <b>that</b> the Itza were already in the Petén region at this time. The nearby village of San José, on the shore of Lake Petén Itzá, is one of the last Itzá communities in Petén.|$|E

In this study 1, 329 adolescents participated. All filled in questionnaires on depression, aggression and parental rejection. It was <b>demonstrated</b> <b>that</b> parental rejection, when mediated through adolescent depression, helped to explain adolescent aggression. Additional analyses <b>demonstrated</b> <b>that</b> this was partially dependent on the adolescent's age and gender...|$|R
