25|$|Diamond Head {{have cited}} their early inspirations as classic 70s British rock bands such as Deep Purple, Led Zeppelin, UFO, Black Sabbath, Judas Priest and Free, Brian Tatler {{relating}} {{that the first}} albums he bought were Led Zeppelin's second album and Deep Purple's Machine <b>Head,</b> <b>and</b> <b>said</b> that although {{a lot of his}} guitar work was inspired by Ritchie Blackmore and Michael Schenker it was punk rock that showed him that anyone could form a band. Colin Kimberley commented Diamond Head got their complex sound from listening to bands like Black Sabbath and Rush and realising that a song with a single riff throughout was not interesting enough.|$|E
500|$|In a 2017 storyline, Babe {{hosted a}} 'Twelfth Night' event at The Vic where she {{secretly}} served pigeon pie. Justin Harp of Digital Spy expressed his disgust {{at this and}} demanded a [...] "lifelong Queen Vic ban" [...] was handed to her. Deen (Metro) described Babe swapping Stan's ashes for custard power as [...] "a seriously grim move that only Babe could have thought of." [...] She also praised the scene where Buster Briggs (Karl Howman) threw a trifle over Babe's <b>head</b> <b>and</b> <b>said,</b> [...] "She looked like a creature from the deep. Chilling." ...|$|E
500|$|Although Stanfield {{worked to}} try to unify the party, Diefenbaker and his loyalists proved {{difficult}} to reconcile. The division in the party broke out in well-publicised dissensions, as when Diefenbaker called on Progressive Conservative MPs to break with Stanfield's position on a bilingualism bill, and nearly half the caucus voted against their leader or abstained. In addition to his parliamentary activities, Diefenbaker travelled extensively and began work on his memoirs, which were published in three volumes between 1975 and 1977. Pearson {{died of cancer in}} 1972, and Diefenbaker was asked if he had kind words for his old rival. Diefenbaker shook his <b>head</b> <b>and</b> <b>said</b> only, [...] "He shouldn't have won the Nobel Prize." ...|$|E
6000|$|Indians in council might teach {{a useful}} lesson to our members of parliament, for they {{witnessed}} this rather laughable species of pantomime with profound gravity and silence. When Roy concluded, they nodded their <b>heads,</b> <b>and</b> <b>said,</b> [...] "Ho! ho!" [...] which, no doubt, was equivalent to [...] "Hear hear!" ...|$|R

60|$|A few hinted of insanity; others {{shook their}} <b>heads,</b> <b>and</b> <b>said</b> a curse was entailed on the property.

500|$|Aruban police {{subsequently}} {{provided a}} fuller {{version of the}} relevant part of the tape in which Kalpoe's response differed from the Dr. Phil version, apparently due to editing that may have altered the meaning of what was said. An unofficial Aruban-affiliated spokesperson and commentator on the case said that the uncut videotape showed that Kalpoe had shaken his <b>head</b> <b>and</b> <b>said</b> [...] "No, she didn't.", thereby denying that Holloway had sex with him {{and the other two}} men. According to an MSNBC report, the crucial words are inaudible, and presenter Rita Cosby questioned if it could be substantiated that Kalpoe had ever made the statements attributed to him in the Dr. Phil version of the recording.|$|E
500|$|Tubman {{also carried}} a revolver, {{and was not}} afraid to use it. The gun afforded some {{protection}} from the ever-present slave catchers and their dogs; however, she also purportedly threatened to shoot any escaped slave who tried to turn back on the journey since that would threaten {{the safety of the}} remaining group. Tubman told the tale of one man who insisted {{he was going to go}} back to the plantation when morale got low among a group of fugitive slaves. She pointed the gun at his <b>head</b> <b>and</b> <b>said,</b> [...] "You go on or die." [...] Several days later, he was with the group as they entered the United Province of Canada.|$|E
500|$|Piccard was {{the mother}} of a house full of boys. Robert R. Gilruth, one of her {{students}} and collaborators, said later in his oral history that he remembered a breakfast he had with the Piccards in a St. Cloud, Minnesota hotel before a balloon launching, [...] "I don't know how many there were. It seems like there was a dozen.... I remember the youngest one took the corn flake box and dumped it on his father's head. Of course, Piccard just brushed it off his <b>head</b> <b>and</b> <b>said,</b> 'No, no.'" [...] "He was very gentle. He loved his boys, and he thought boys would be boys, I guess." [...] The Piccards had three sons of their own, John, Paul, and Donald (who would become a famous balloonist and ballooning innovator in his own right), as well as foster children. The Piccard family archive in the Library of Congress mentions correspondence from foster children whom the Piccards took in, although nothing else seems to be known about them.|$|E

60|$|More than Thyra looked anxiously to sea and {{sky that}} night in Avonlea.

2500|$|Judson, {{instead of}} {{welcoming}} {{him to the}} faith, pressed him further asking if he believed what he had read in the gospel of Matthew that Jesus the son of God died on the cross. U Shwe Ngong shook his <b>head</b> <b>and</b> <b>said,</b> [...] "Ah, you have caught me now. I believe that he suffered death, but I cannot believe he suffered the shameful death on the cross." [...] Not long after, {{he came back to}} tell Judson, [...] "I have been trusting in my own reason, not the word of God…. I now believe the crucifixion of Christ because it is contained in scripture." ...|$|E
2500|$|Buffalo Bill {{would not}} discuss the killing of Chief American Horse at Slim Buttes He just shook his <b>head</b> <b>and</b> <b>said</b> it was too bad to talk about. While Cody did not {{participate}} in the Battle of Slim Buttes, he took a scalp at the Battle of Warbonnet Creek on July 17, 1876, in a skirmish characterized as a duel between Buffalo Bill and a young Cheyenne warrior named Yellow Hair. The engagement, {{often referred to as the}} [...] "First Scalp for Custer", was dramatized with Captain Jack in their consolidated theater act. [...] Buffalo Bill displayed the fallen warrior's scalp, feather war bonnet, knife, saddle and other personal effects. [...] However, scalping Indians become loathsome to Buffalo Bill.|$|E
2500|$|Wei Yan {{was left}} with only his son(s) and a few followers. They fled towards Hanzhong Commandery. Yang Yi ordered Ma Dai to give chase. Ma Dai caught up with Wei Yan, decapitated him, brought his head back, and threw {{it in front of}} Yang Yi. Yang Yi trampled on Wei Yan's <b>head</b> <b>and</b> <b>said,</b> [...] "You {{inferior}} slave! Now, can you still commit evil?" [...] Wei Yan's family members and close relatives were also executed. Before Wei Yan's death, Jiang Wan had led divisions of the imperial guards from Chengdu to deal with the conflict. They had travelled for about 10 li (about three miles) when they received news of Wei Yan's death, after which they returned to Chengdu.|$|E

60|$|People {{who knew}} the river shook their <b>heads,</b> <b>and</b> <b>said</b> that the {{decision}} had been delayed too long.

2500|$|In 1863, Saulsbury was a vehement {{critic of}} President Abraham Lincoln's administration. [...] Opposing {{the war in}} general and the {{suspension}} of habeas corpus specifically, Saulsbury attempted to prevent a vote sustaining that controversial executive order. [...] Apparently intoxicated, Saulsbury verbally attacked the President on the Senate floor in what John Hay described as [...] "language fit only for a drunken fishwife". [...] Senator Saulsbury called Lincoln [...] "an imbecile" [...] and stated that the President was [...] "the weakest man ever placed in a high office". [...] When Vice President Hannibal Hamlin called Saulsbury to order, the Senator refused to take his seat. [...] Finally, the Senate's sergeant-at-arms approached to remove Saulsbury from the Senate floor when the Senator suddenly brandished a revolver, placed it against the sergeant's <b>head</b> <b>and</b> <b>said,</b> [...] "Damn you, if you touch me I'll shoot you dead!" [...] Eventually, Saulsbury was calmed and removed from the Senate floor.|$|E
2500|$|Nevertheless, Hungerford {{made the}} right choice in {{breaking}} professional ties with George W. Patterson Jr., who took over as the President of the Geo. Washington Bank. On November 2, 1868, Patterson left work, placing his eighteen-year-old teller, George Eaton, in charge of the bank. Some time after three o'clock, a man came in and announced that he was a government detective there to arrest Eaton and Patterson for counterfeiting money. Eaton managed to lock the vault before being handcuffed. The so-called detective placed a revolver to Eaton's <b>head</b> <b>and</b> <b>said</b> to him: [...] "Young man, you may as well know my business at once. I want the money of this bank or I will blow your brains out." [...] Eaton told him to go ahead and a struggle ensued. The two compromised and Eaton, who was still in handcuffs, allowed the man to escape in exchange for his life. Eaton ran around Corning until he eventually found Patterson. By then, of course, the would-be robber escaped. Patterson offered a $100 reward for the assailant's arrest. Patterson was fortunate that he did not find his bank vault empty upon his return.|$|E
2500|$|The Mishnah recounted a {{story that}} {{demonstrated}} {{the authority of the}} court in [...] — that one must follow the rulings of the court and [...] "not turn [...] [...] [...] to the right hand, nor to the left." [...] After two witnesses testified that they saw the new moon at its proper time (on the thirtieth day of the month shortly before nightfall), Rabban Gamaliel (the president of the Great Sanhedrin in Jerusalem) accepted their evidence and ruled that a new month had begun. But later at night (after the nightfall with which the thirty-first day of the earlier month would have begun), when the new moon should have been clearly visible, no one saw the new moon. Rabbi Dosa ben Harkinas declared the two witnesses to be false witnesses, comparing their testimony to that of witnesses who testify that a woman bore a child, when on the next day her belly was still swollen. Rabbi Joshua told Rabbi Dosa that he saw the force of his argument. Rabban Gamaliel then ordered Rabbi Joshua to appear before Rabban Gamaliel with his staff and money on the day which according to Rabbi Joshua's reckoning would be Yom Kippur. (According to Rabbi Joshua's reckoning, Yom Kippur would fall a day after the date that it would fall according to Rabban Gamaliel's reckoning. And [...] prohibited carrying a staff and money on Yom Kippur.) Rabbi Akiva then found Rabbi Joshua in great distress (agonizing over whether to obey Rabban Gamaliel's order to do what Rabbi Joshua considered profaning Yom Kippur). Rabbi Akiva told Rabbi Joshua that he could prove that whatever Rabban Gamaliel ordered was valid. Rabbi Akiva cited [...] which says, [...] "These are the appointed seasons of the Lord, holy convocations, which you shall proclaim in their appointed seasons," [...] {{which is to say that}} whether they are proclaimed at their proper time or not, God has no appointed seasons other than those that are proclaimed. Rabbi Joshua then went to Rabbi Dosa, who told Rabbi Joshua that if they called into question the decisions of the court of Rabban Gamaliel, then they would have to call into question the decisions of every court since the days of Moses. For [...] says, [...] "Then Moses and Aaron, Nadab and Abihu, and 70 of the elders of Israel went up," [...] and [...] does not mention the names of the elders to show that every group of three that has acted as a court over Israel is on a level with the court of Moses (as most of the members of that court also bore names without distinction). Rabbi Joshua then took his staff and his money and went to Rabban Gamaliel on the day that Rabbi Joshua reckoned was Yom Kippur. Rabban Gamaliel rose and kissed Rabbi Joshua on his <b>head</b> <b>and</b> <b>said,</b> [...] "Come in peace, my teacher and my disciple — my teacher in wisdom and my disciple because you have accepted my decision."–25a2.|$|E
