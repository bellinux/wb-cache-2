40|$|The {{invention}} {{relates to}} a <b>semiconductor</b> <b>detector</b> for short-wave radiation, {{in particular in}} the UV range, and the process for its production. Known <b>semiconductor</b> <b>detectors</b> for the UV range have the disadavantage that they experience major difficulties in sensitive narrowband detection in the the wavelength range below about 350 nm.

The semiconductor layer contains components of a photodetector in the form of areas with different dopings and the active detector volume arranged laterally and adjacently, whereby the active detector volume covers the entire thickness of the semiconductor layer and the thickness of th e semiconductor layer is adjusted in this layer depending on the penetration depth of the radiation to be detected.

5000|$|The energy {{required}} to produce electron-hole-pairs is very low compared to the energy {{required to}} produce paired ions in a gas <b>detector.</b> Consequently, in <b>semiconductor</b> <b>detectors</b> the statistical variation of the pulse height is smaller and the energy resolution is higher. As the electrons travel fast, the time resolution is also very good, and is dependent upon rise time.

40|$|The {{advent of}} <b>semiconductor</b> <b>detectors</b> has {{revolutionized}} the broad field of X-ray spectroscopy. <b>Semiconductor</b> <b>detectors,</b> originally developed for particle physics, are now widely used for X-ray spectroscopy {{in a large}} variety of fields, as X-ray fluorescence analysis, X-ray astronomy and diagnostic medicine. The success of <b>semiconductor</b> <b>detectors</b> is due to several unique properties that are not available {{with other types of}} detectors: the excellent energy resolution, the high detection efficiency and the possibility of development of compact detection systems. Among the <b>semiconductors,</b> silicon (Si) <b>detectors</b> are the key detectors in the soft X-ray band ( 15 keV) {{and will continue to be}} the choice for laboratory-based high performance spectrometers. However, there has been a continuing desire for ambient temperature and compact detectors with the portability and convenience of a scintillator but with a significant improvement in resolution. To this end, numerous high-Z and wide band gap compound semiconductors have been exploited. Among the compound semiconductors, cadmium telluride (CdTe) and cadmium zinc telluride (CdZnTe) are very appealing for hard X-ray detectors and are widely used for the development of spectrometer prototypes for medical and astrophysical applications. Beside the detector, the readout electronics also plays a key role in the development of high resolution spectrometers. Recently, many research groups have been involved in the design and development of high resolution spectrometers based on <b>semiconductor</b> <b>detectors</b> and on digital pulse processing (DPP) techniques. Due to their lower dead time, higher stability and flexibility, digital systems, based on directly digitizing and processing of detector signals (preamplifier output signals), have recently been favored over analog electronics ensuring high performance in both low and high counting rate environments. In this chapter, we review the research activities of our group in the development of high throughput and high resolution X-ray spectrometers based on compound <b>semiconductor</b> <b>detectors</b> and DPP systems. First, we briefly describe the physical properties and the signal formation in <b>semiconductor</b> <b>detectors</b> for X-ray spectroscopy. Second, we introduce the main properties and critical issues of a X-ray detection system, highlighting the characteristics of both analog and digital approaches. Finally, we report on the spectroscopic performance of a high resolution spectrometer based on a CdTe detector and a custom DPP system. As an application, direct measurements of mammographic X-ray spectra by using the digital CdTe detection system are also presented...|$|R

40|$|The {{non-contact}} {{measurement of}} temperature {{by using the}} emitted thermal radiation has been an innovative field of measurement science and fundamental physics {{for more than a}} hundred years. It saw the first highlight in Gustav Kirchhoff's principle of a blackbody with ideal emission characteristics and culminated in Max Planck's formulation of the law of thermal radiation, the so-called Planck's law, forming the foundation of quantum physics. A boost in accuracy was the development of <b>semiconductor</b> <b>detectors</b> and the cryogenic electrical substitution radiometer in the late 1970 s. <b>Semiconductor</b> <b>detectors,</b> namely photodiodes, deliver an electrical current proportional to the absorbed optical radiation. Due to the measurements of thermal radiation over a wide range of temperature and wavelength, thermodynamic temperature measurements with radiometric methods have set benchmarks to all, the electrical, dimensional and optical metrology.

40|$|Abstract. A 450 keV x-ray {{computed}} tomography system using silicon <b>semiconductor</b> <b>detectors</b> {{has been developed}} for non-destructive inspection testing and digital engineering use. Silicon <b>semiconductor</b> <b>detectors</b> provide good signal-to-noise ratio for measurements with large output current due to incident photons. Circuits for adjusting input bias voltage of preamplifiers are added to realize long term stability of the system by controlling the detector leakage current, changes of which cause quality degradation of the CT image. The system provides high speed scanning of 6 seconds/slice in the rotate-only mode which is sufficient for digital engineering, e. g. only 2 hours are needed to scan 800 slices of a motorcycle cylinder head. 1...|$|R
