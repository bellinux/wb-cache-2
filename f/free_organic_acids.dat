Among the fungi that have this ability, Deuteromycetes are particularly noted for their biochemical characteristics. Taking this into account, it was of interest to analyze the influence of detergent and its main compounds, ethoxyled oleylcetyl alcohol (AOC) and sodium tripoly-phosphate (TTP), on the metabolism of the fungus Trichothecium roseum.

An understanding of the behaviour of organic acids in these soils {{is crucial to the}} critical assessment of their potential capacity for nutrient mobilization. The aim of this study was therefore to study the sorption reactions and mineralization potentials of three organic acids commonly found in root exudates of calcicole plants (citrate, malate and oxalate). Using maize as a model plant, we studied the root exudation of organic acids into a calcareous soil and assessed the organic acid biodegradation rate in rhizosphere and bulk soil. Our results indicate that malate and citrate are rapidly biodegraded in this calcareous soil, in agreement with previous studies presented for non-calcareous soils. In contrast, oxalate appears to be resistant to microbial degradation possibly due to substrate protection by the formation and precipitation of Ca-oxalate. The rate of malate biodegradation was significantly enhanced in rhizosphere soil relative to that in bulk soil possibly reflecting the high degree of efflux of this organic acid from maize roots. The levels of <b>free</b> <b>organic</b> <b>acids</b> in the soil solution of calcareous soil surrounding maize roots, whilst higher than in the bulk soil, were extremely low...|$|E

The fungal growth was investigated by monitoring the diameter of colonies on solid media and dry weight biomass in liquid media. A. tenuis had better response to applied pollutant in solid medium, whereas P. verrucosum had better response in liquid medium. During exponential fungal growth in liquid media with and without pollutant (control), the following physico-chemical and biochemical parameters were carried out: pH, quantity of free and total organic acids, proteins, carbohydrates, proteolytic activity. The ethoxylated oleyl-cetyl alcohol had influence on decrease in pH value and increase in <b>free</b> <b>organic</b> <b>acids</b> of both fungi. Furthermore, it has influenced production in way that lower amount of total organic acids, proteins, glucose and fructose were gained in fermentation broth of P. verrucosum compared to A. tenuis.

We can notice from the obtained results that the detergent, sodium tripoly-phosphate and ethoxyled oleyl-cetyl alcohol in a concentration of 0. 1 % had an inhibitory effect on protein bioproduction and total biomass on the 8 th day from the day of inoculation, while the production of free and total organic acids was partially or significantly stimulated by the presence of the detergent, sodium tripoly-phosphate and ethoxyled oleyl-cetyl alcohol in a concentration of 0. 1 %.

40|$|High Al {{resistance}} of Rumex obtusifolius together with {{its ability to}} accumulate Al has never been studied in weakly acidic conditions (pH > 5. 8) and is not sufficiently described in real soil conditions. The potential elucidation {{of the role of}} organic acids in plant can explain the Al tolerance mechanism. We established a pot experiment with R. obtusifolius planted in slightly acidic and alkaline soils. For the manipulation of Al availability, both soils were untreated and treated by lime and superphosphate. We determined mobile Al concentrations in soils and concentrations of Al and organic acids in organs. Al availability correlated positively to the extraction of organic acids (citric acid < oxalic acid) in soils. Monovalent Al cations were the most abundant mobile Al forms with positive charge in soils. Liming and superphosphate application were ambiguous measures for changing Al mobility in soils. Elevated transport of total Al from belowground organs into leaves was recorded in both lime-treated soils and in superphosphate-treated alkaline soil as a result of sufficient amount of Ca available from soil solution as well as from superphosphate that can probably modify distribution of total Al in R. obtusifolius as a representative of "oxalate plants. " The highest concentrations of Al and organic acids were recorded in the leaves, followed by the stem and belowground organ infusions. In alkaline soil, R. obtusifolius is an Al-hyperaccumulator with the highest concentrations of oxalate in leaves, of malate in stems, and of citrate in belowground organs.

40|$|Indoor ozone has {{received}} attention {{because of its}} well-documented adverse effects on health. In addition to the inherently harmful effects of ozone, it can also initiate a series of reactions that generate potentially irritating oxidation products, including <b>free</b> radicals, aldehydes, <b>organic</b> <b>acids</b> and secondary <b>organic</b> aerosols (SOA). The overarching goal of this work was to better understand ozone and terpene distributions within rooms. Towards this end, the paper has two parts. The first describes {{the development of a}} cylindrical test chamber {{that can be used to}} obtain the second order rate constant (kb) for the bi-molecular chemical reaction of ozone and terpene in the air phase. The second consists of model room experiments coupled with Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) analysis of the experimental scenarios to obtain ozone and terpene distributions in turbulent flow fields. The results of CFD predictions were in reasonable agreement with the experimental measurements...|$|R
40|$|Acetate {{disappearance}} {{from the}} loops of the hindgut in the rabbit was evaluated by measuring {{variations in the}} concentration of acetate in caecocolonic loops and differences in the arterial and venous plasma. In vivo metabolism in gut and liver tissues was studied after introduction of (1 - 14 C) acetate into caecocolonic loops. The rate of disappearance from the loops was quantitatively significant and showed little variation irrespective of the location in the hindgut. Hindgut tissue metabolised acetate {{and the intensity of}} the metabolism varied with the segment studied. The distal position of the gut showed by far the highest acetate uptake. Radioactivity was found in a certain number of <b>free</b> amino <b>acids,</b> <b>organic</b> <b>acids,</b> and sugars. Acetate was mainly converted into aspartate and glutamate. These can be considered as 'stock forms' which can be diverted either towards oxidative metabolism or towards protein synthesis...|$|R
40|$|The {{influence}} of detergents on the metabolism of Penicillium chrysogenum from two aspects, as a stress factor and potential nutrient, was studied. The fungus was {{isolated from the}} river bed Lepenica, Kragujevac, {{at a place where}} sewage domestic wastewater discharged into the river. The fungus was grown in a liquid nutrient medium according to Czapek with and without addition of commercial detergent (MERIX, Henkel, Serbia) at a concentration of 0. 3 % and 0. 5 %. The biochemical changes of pH, redox potential, <b>free</b> and total <b>organic</b> <b>acids,</b> total dry weight biomass, activity of alkaline and acid invertase and alkaline phosphatase were evaluated from day 3 to day 16 of the fungus growth. At the same time, detergent disappearance in terms of methylene blue active substances in the medium was measured. The detergent at a concentration of 0. 5 % showed a fungicide effect. In the medium with 0. 3 % of detergent, there was increased pH and concentration of <b>organic</b> <b>acids,</b> but decreased redox potential and total dry weight biomass. The detergent also showed an inhibitory effect on invertase and phosphatase activity. P. chrysogenum decomposed 50. 2 % of the total detergent concentration for an experimental period of 16 days...|$|R
40|$|To {{extend our}} {{understanding}} of flavor development during fruit ripening the changes in total soluble solids (TSS), pH, sugars, <b>free</b> amino <b>acids,</b> <b>organic</b> <b>acids,</b> total volatiles and a suite of soluble minerals including sodium, phosphorus, calcium and magnesium have been measured in fruit of cv. Makdimon melons during development, ripening and storage. Changes in flesh pH, total sugars, total volatiles, the amino acids valine, serine, threonine, proline and the soluble minerals potassium and sodium were strongly correlated (3 ̆e 0. 87) with those of TSS. Therefore, if TSS is taken {{as an indicator of}} fruit maturity and flavor quality as is often the case, then each or all of the above parameters may also be determinants of fruit quality. The influence of fruit maturity at harvest and postharvest storage time on the changes in many of these flavor related parameters and how these may relate to the development of fruit quality is also examined...|$|R
25|$|YAN is a {{measurement}} of the primary <b>organic</b> (<b>free</b> amino <b>acids)</b> and inorganic (ammonia and ammonium) sources of nitrogen that can be assimilated by S. cerevisiae. There are several nitrogenous compounds found in must and wine including peptides, larger proteins, amides, biogenic amines, pyridines, purines and nucleic acids but these cannot be directly used by yeast for metabolism. Taken together, the total nitrogen content of grape must can range from 60 to 2400mg of nitrogen per liter, however not all of this nitrogen will be assimilable. The lack of protease enzymes, which break down larger peptides into smaller components, that can work outside the cell, limits {{the size of the}} molecules that yeast can use as a source for nitrogen.|$|R
