25|$|It {{all started}} in the Sheraton Hotel, Boston. We'd talked about a film for years and Jimmy had known Joe Massot was interested— so we called them and over they came. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>all</b> <b>very</b> quickly arranged.|$|E
25|$|We {{were near}} the {{entrance}} to a bar when a roar penetrated the alleyway under the stairs. It was a kind of reaction from a crowd I'd not heard before...The roar went on...and on. There was no following applause to greet a departing batsman. The roar dropped to a murmur. Then there was silence. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>all</b> <b>very</b> eerie.|$|E
500|$|The press {{were given}} {{advanced}} {{copies of the}} episode. Matthew Weiner pronounced himself shocked by what he considered spoilers in the review. Weiner criticized the episode's review by Alessandra Stanley of the New York Times, expressing that the publication revealed too much information. [...] He continued: [...] "I'm kind of powerless. It's the bargain you make. I wanted to have press, and {{it was nice to}} get that kind of space with those pictures. The alternative is not to share these things with the press any more – but how can you expect journalists to write about the show if you don’t? <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>all</b> <b>very</b> disappointing to me.|$|E

5000|$|<b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>all</b> <b>very</b> well {{to aim for}} a more ‘abstract’ and a ‘cleaner’ {{approach}} tosemantics, but if {{the plan}} is to be any good, the operational aspects cannotbe completely ignored. (Scott70) ...|$|R
500|$|The Great Dining Room is {{situated}} in the east wing extension {{of the house and}} was added in 1877 under J. MacVicar Anderson {{during the time of the}} Red Earl. The room was inspired by the ballroom of Buckingham Palace, with walls hung with faded, red damask silk. The Spencers ate their regular meals in the Tapestry Dining Room, an inner room of the east side to the east of the Wooton Hall. Aside from the two fine vividly constructed tapestries, one of gypsies and one of farming, the room is fairly bleak in design compared to other rooms in the house; the dining table is relatively small, with a drab grey floor and open brick fireplace dated in large letters to 1683. The [...] "sombre" [...] oak panelling originally came from the family's other property of Wormleighton Manor in Warwickshire. [...] Charles Spencer recalled that three generations of Spencers would eat their lunch together and that dining conditions were [...] "silent, apart from the noises of my grandfather eating with great gusto, a napkin tucked in around his neck, hanging down over his popping-out tummy, and <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>all</b> <b>very</b> sad and tense".|$|E
500|$|The A.V. Clubs Nathan Rabin enjoyed [...] "Argus", {{noting that}} it was [...] "entertaining, funny and had some killer one-liners" [...] and that it {{featured}} [...] "all kinds of silly but in a very winning way." [...] Rabin enjoyed all the plots featured here, and praised Will Forte's role as Jenna's boyfriend and impersonator. Emily Exton from Entertainment Weekly wrote that the peacock storyline [...] "felt too silly", and that Forte [...] "was too underused as Paul", nonetheless said that despite not being the greatest 30 Rock episode of all time [...] "there were still some hilarious lines." [...] IGN contributor Robert Canning liked Grizz's dilemma plot, commenting that Grizz not trying to hurt Tracy's feelings while Tracy tried to keep Dot Com away from Grizz's bride-to-be [...] "offered up some inspired lunacy." [...] His only complaint about [...] "Argus" [...] was Jack's plot as he deemed it disappointing. A review in TV Guide by Adam Mersel said [...] "...Fey and the gang {{live up to the}} challenge, and produce [...] a hilarious, quite snotty episode that holds up to any comedy around." [...] Meredith Blake, writing for the Los Angeles Times, was positive towards the episode, reasoning that the writing [...] "is just so deliciously absurd that I can't help but giggle the whole way through", and that the plots featured here were [...] "sublimely inconsequential. Not a whole lot happened, but <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>all</b> <b>very</b> funny." [...] Nick Catucci from New York magazine, who did not enjoy the two other stories, appreciated Jenna's, explaining that by having the character date one of her own impersonator was [...] "outrageous and funny without relying on any cheap insults to trannies." [...] Sean Gandert from Paste magazine reported that [...] "Argus" [...] was an episode that [...] " [...] us back to the show's roots", explaining that recapturing the [...] "old tone" [...] also worked to [...] "recapture the old joke-writing expertise. It wasn't 100% consistent, but there were so many good one-liners to counterbalance the misfires that it didn't even matter. This is 30 Rock the way it should be." [...] The Houston Press Daniel Carlson wrote that Grizz's wedding story was [...] "pure filler, but everything on the show's kind of filler for the wackiness, so it mostly worked." [...] Carlson wrote that the best part from [...] "Argus" [...] came with Forte's Paul as Jenna's boyfriend and impersonator.|$|E
2500|$|They were {{initially}} a three-piece (Pat Hughes {{for the first}} edition only, Linda Hotchkin and Jane Bartlett), but their number eventually grew to six (Hotchkin, Bartlett, Lesley Larbey, Wendy Hilhouse, Barbara van der Heyde and Thelma Bignell) with Cook as full-time choreographer. Lulu remembered of their costumes [...] "They mostly wore white boots to the knee and short skirts and the camera would go up the skirt and <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>all</b> <b>very</b> risqué." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{was frightened}} then," [...] she declared. [...] "I am frightened now. But <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>all</b> <b>very</b> different. There <b>was</b> hope for me then. Now there is none. No, none at all." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Ah! <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>all</b> <b>very</b> well," [...] {{the first}} mate replied, when he {{expressed}} his opinion. [...] "Give me your low, sandy shores, and let {{those who like}} have what you call the fine, bold rocks.|$|R
2500|$|Vikki Simpson told The Sydney Morning Herald in October {{that the}} album's success {{had taken the}} band by surprise, [...] "We were nonchalant about {{releasing}} albums. We'd released three already and had learned not to put too much hope behind an album because you're usually disappointed. So it was a surprise, but we took it in our stride. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>all</b> <b>very</b> exciting but it didn't seem real to us because {{it was such a}} new experience." ...|$|E
2500|$|Moranis recalled, [...] "We went on {{the stage}} with no preparation, and did 15 [...] Two of them were lousy, in three we cracked up and fell apart... maybe six were keepers." [...] Added Dave Thomas in a 2000 interview, [...] "Rick and I used {{to sit in the}} studio, by {{ourselves}} – almost like happy hour – drink real beers, cook back bacon, literally make hot snack food for ourselves while we improvised and just talked. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>all</b> <b>very</b> low key and stupid, and we thought, 'Well, they get what they deserve. This is their Canadian content. I hope they like it.'" ...|$|E
2500|$|Until the 1990s, Steeleye often toured as part {{of double}} bill, {{supporting}} Status Quo, or featuring support from artists such as Rock Salt & Nails and The Rankin Family. When Steeleye Span supported Status Quo on tour in 1996, the latter had just issued their version of [...] "All Around My Hat" [...] as a single. [...] "The video was filmed at Christmas," [...] Prior recalled. [...] "We'd supported them, and I found myself down in the mosh pit. Francis saw me and told the audience, 'Oh look, there's a Maddy lookalike down there… Fuck me, it is Maddy!' I was hoyed over the barrier , to join them for the encore. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>all</b> <b>very</b> jolly." [...] Status Quo's single is credited to [...] "Status Quo with Maddy Prior from Steeleye Span" [...] and reached number 47 in the charts.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>all</b> <b>very</b> well, Bob, for you; but I {{feel that}} <b>it</b> <b>is</b> not fair. However, as you really don't want the money, and are well satisfied, we will say nothing more about it, now." ...|$|R
25|$|The next era {{there is}} any history on, starts in the 1950s and this to {{is made up of}} photo's and some history related by some old time {{residents}} in Ellerslie but <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>all</b> <b>very</b> sketchy.|$|R
6000|$|... "Sell it, my dear; <b>it</b> will <b>be</b> {{of no use}} to us: <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>all</b> <b>very</b> old, {{and would}} hardly pay for the carriage. Of course those things which have any {{particular}} association we will take with us." ...|$|R
2500|$|Nonetheless, Orange Man soon sparked large {{controversy}} {{in the media and}} in public after it was discovered children had copied the events of the advertisement in playgrounds and injured themselves; Rupert Howell, a Tango advertisement executive, stated in 2000 that Orange Man [...] "sparked a playground craze" [...] where [...] "people used to go round sort of slapping each other and saying 'You've Been Tango'd', and <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>all</b> <b>very</b> entertaining and great fun. There were no problems until we got a phone call once from a surgeon who said 'look, I'm not the complaining type but I thought you'd like to know that I did an operation on a child this morning with a damaged ear drum, and I was wheeling him in to the operating table, and said to him 'what happened to you then?' and replied 'I got Tango'd.'" [...] As a result, Howell pulled the advertisement from television that afternoon, although other reports erroneously state that the advertisement was banned.|$|E
2500|$|The {{decision}} {{to set the}} game four thousand years before [...] {{was one of the}} first details about the game made known. LucasArts gave BioWare a choice of settings for the game. [...] "LucasArts came to us and said that we could do an [...] game," [...] BioWare CEO Raymond Muzyka said. [...] "Or LucasArts said we could go 4,000 years back, which is a period that's hardly been covered before." [...] BioWare chose to set the game four thousand years before the films as it gave them greater creative freedom. They aimed to create content similar to that from the films but different enough to be a definite precursor. Concept work had to be sent to [...] "the ranch" [...] to be approved for use. Muzyka noted that very little of their content was rejected: [...] "It was more like, 'Can you just make his head like this rather than like that.' So <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>all</b> <b>very</b> feasible. There were good suggestions made and they made the game better, so we were happy to do them. It was a good process really and I think we were pleasantly surprised how easy LucasArts was to work with." [...] Zeschuk said that [...] "Overall, we were really happy with the results. We felt like we had enough freedom to truly create something wonderful." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>all</b> <b>very</b> {{well for}} Mr. Richard Frobisher (of the London Mail) to cut up rough about it. Polly did not {{altogether}} blame him.|$|E
6000|$|... "Perhaps," [...] said Miss McQuinch, {{becoming}} excited, [...] "she refused {{because she}} had too much good sense: aye, and too much common decency to accept. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>all</b> <b>very</b> well for us fortunate good-for-nothings to resort to prostitution----" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'No, no; I don't suppose I {{should see}} {{anything}} horrid or even disagreeable. I know <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>all</b> <b>very</b> beautiful; but then {{every person who}} goes for the innocent pleasures' sake only helps {{to keep up the}} whole thing--evil and all.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{hope your}} nag {{has a strong}} back, then," [...] said Amyas; [...] "but I must go on and see Sir Richard, Frank. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>all</b> <b>very</b> well to jest {{as we have been}} doing, but my mind is made up." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>all</b> <b>very</b> {{pleasant}} and genuine; {{there was a}} sense of ease and peacefulness, quite different from the mechanical, slightly sullen manoeuvring of the Germans.|$|E
60|$|<b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>all</b> <b>very</b> ridiculous but I did {{not feel}} comfortable. However, there was {{business}} to be done, and I could allow nothing to interfere with it.|$|E
60|$|<b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>all</b> <b>very</b> {{good and}} appetising; but to Annie it was pathetically old-fashioned, {{and helped her}} to realise how wholly {{out of the world}} was the life which her friends led.|$|E
6000|$|... "By {{the law of}} custom. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>all</b> <b>very</b> well, Frank, but you can't {{fight against}} it. At any rate, you can't ignore it till <b>it</b> has <b>been</b> fought against and conquered. And <b>it</b> <b>is</b> useful. <b>It</b> keeps women from going astray." ...|$|R
60|$|Colman. I am {{thinking}} sometimes, Brother Paul should give more thought {{to us than}} he does. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>all</b> <b>very</b> well for him, he is so taken up with his thoughts and his visions he doesn't know if he is full or fasting.|$|R
6000|$|... "A {{good deal}} too well," [...] Ryan grumbled; [...] "it was very {{unpleasant}} while <b>it</b> lasted. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>all</b> <b>very</b> well to <b>be</b> shot at by an enemy, {{but to be}} shot at by one's friends {{is more than one}} bargained for." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>all</b> <b>very</b> {{simple and}} very obvious: but Marguerite's mind had been asleep, {{and it was}} the sight of the sable-clad little figure which had roused it from its happy torpor.|$|E
60|$|There {{were several}} {{children}} already {{gathered at the}} schoolhouse door as he came up. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>all</b> <b>very</b> American--the boxlike house of white, the slender teacher approaching, the roughly clad urchins waiting.|$|E
6000|$|... 'All! <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>all</b> <b>very</b> {{well for}} you to say so,' said Katherine; 'you were sitting in the cool at home, only hearing Edward read, not toiling in the sun as I was.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I know,' said Lucilla, {{in a tone}} he did not understand; then, {{with an air of}} eldership, ill {{assorting}} {{with their}} respective sizes, 'You are a mere child. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>all</b> <b>very</b> well for you, and you are very welcome to your Sweet Honey.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't think anything," [...] I answered, [...] "except that <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>all</b> <b>very</b> odd. I don't even {{understand}} what Isis {{and the child}} Horus represent.
