50|$|The <b>false</b> <b>cobra</b> or moila snake, Rhagerhis moilensis (Hermann, 1804), {{has been}} {{included}} in this genus, but is now placed in its own genus.|$|E
50|$|Pseudoxenodon macrops, {{commonly}} known as the large-eyed bamboo snake or the Chinese <b>false</b> <b>cobra,</b> is a species of venomous rear-fanged snake endemic to Asia.|$|E
5000|$|Hydrodynastes gigas is a New World {{species of}} large, rear-fanged, {{colubrid}} snake endemic to South America. The <b>false</b> water <b>cobra</b> is {{so named because}} when the snake is threatened it [...] "hoods" [...] as a true cobra (Naja species) does. However, unlike a true cobra, it does not rear up, but remains in a horizontal position. It is commonly and alternatively known as the <b>false</b> water <b>cobra</b> and the Brazilian smooth snake. [...] No subspecies are currently recognized.|$|R
50|$|The <b>false</b> water <b>cobra</b> has large {{eyes with}} {{circular}} pupils, allowing good daytime vision. The tongue is black, {{and of the}} typical snake fashion.|$|R
5000|$|The <b>false</b> water <b>cobra,</b> Hydrodynastes gigas, is {{the only}} [...] "cobra" [...] {{that is not a}} member of the Elapidae. It does not rear, {{produces}} only a slight flattening of the neck, and is only mildly venomous.|$|R
5000|$|Hydrodynastes gigas is {{commonly}} referred to as the false water cobra, <b>false</b> <b>cobra,</b> South American water cobra, and Brazilian smooth snake. It is often referred to within the reptile hobby more simply as either a [...] "falsy" [...] or [...] "falsie" [...] or a [...] "FWC", which is an abbreviation of the common name false water cobra.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>false</b> <b>cobra</b> (Rhagerhis moilensis) is an opisthoglyphous snake {{found in}} parts of Africa and the Middle East. It is the sole species of the genus Rhagerhis. The name [...] "false cobra" [...] {{comes from the fact}} that this is not a cobra. It imitates a cobra's stance by {{spreading}} its neck into a hood and hissing like the cobra. It can grow up to 1.5 metres in length and preys on rodents and lizards.|$|E
5000|$|The {{park has}} a small area in the park called the Discovery Zone, home to a pair meerkats, pygmy marmosets, cockroaches, green basilisk lizard, <b>false</b> water <b>cobra,</b> green tree frog, tree python and several species of {{tortoise}} and tarantula.|$|R
50|$|H. gigas {{is a large}} {{colubrid}} {{that may}} exceed 3 m (9 to 10 ft) in total length when adult. However most H. gigas reach approximately 2 m (6 to 7 ft) in total length. It is of medium body, and is therefore neither particularly heavy nor slender-bodied, but {{is one of the}} heaviest colubrid species when full adult size is attained. Males are much smaller than females in this species. The common name <b>false</b> water <b>cobra</b> is an allusion to its ability to flatten its neck, similar to a cobra as a defensive reaction to make it look larger and more intimidating. Unlike the true <b>cobra,</b> though, the <b>false</b> water <b>cobra</b> stays in a horizontal position when it hoods, rather than rearing into a vertical position. H. gigas can flatten not only its neck, but also lower down the body, which is not possible for a true cobra.|$|R
5000|$|H. gigas {{generally}} {{lives in}} wet, humid areas, and marshlands, typically within the tropical rainforests {{that are common}} within its range. However, the <b>false</b> water <b>cobra</b> has also been observed in dryer areas, although this is not its preferred habitat. The preference of wet land as a habitat for H. gigas contributes to its common name of false [...] "water" [...] cobra.|$|R
25|$|About thirty {{species of}} snake occur in Egypt, {{about half of}} them venomous. These include the Egyptian <b>cobra,</b> <b>false</b> smooth snake and horned viper. There are also {{numerous}} species of lizards. Above the Aswan Dam, the shores of Lake Nasser are largely barren, but the lake does support the last remaining Nile crocodiles and African softshell turtle in Egypt.|$|R
50|$|The {{background}} colour of a mature specimen is an olive green or brown, with dark spots and bands covering {{much of its}} body. The background coloring and banding generally become darker towards the end tail. This colouring gives the <b>false</b> water <b>cobra</b> effective camouflage in its natural rainforest environment. The ventral scales are yellow or brown, spotted with dark flecks that make three dotted lines which appear to merge towards the tail. Mehrtens, 1987, suggested females are brown ventrally, whilst males are yellow. Females are suggesteed to have lighter bands and markings on their bodies. This is not an effective way of judging the sex of H. gigas, as coloring will differ slightly between all individuals. Hatchling and juveniles are much darker in coloration {{and do not have}} the typical dark eyes of the adults. They more resemble a garter or water snake than their mature counterparts. In captivity, hypomelanstic animals have been produced. These animals vary in coloration, from some having only slightly lighter colored saddles, to those that are almost patternless.|$|R
50|$|Marven was {{bitten by}} a venomous green pit viper in East Malaysian state Sabah in the summer 2014 during filming the first episode of the show called Eating Wild. The snake bit him on the thumb but did not inject too much venom, so Marven spent 6 hours in the hospital, until he had recovered. He has also had a few other very {{dangerous}} encounters with venomous snakes. While he was producing the BBC film The Serpent's Embrace in 1980s, a spitting cobra sprayed its venom into his eyes. He spent 2-3 days in hospital, though luckily the venom did not enter his blood. A similar encounter happened in December 2008 while Marven was making a short film about black-necked spitting cobras for Webosaurs. Though he wore a mask, the cobra venom landed in Marven's hair, then mixed with sweat and ran into his eyes, so he stopped the filming until next morning. In his 2008 series Jaguar Adventure he was {{bitten by a}} mildly toxic venomous <b>false</b> water <b>cobra.</b> His hand swelled up within ten minutes, {{but there were no}} other harmful effects.|$|R
