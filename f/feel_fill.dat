60|$|Her {{sister was}} drunk. That in itself was terrible enough, {{yet it was}} not the {{drunkenness}} alone that had sickened Janet, but the suggestion of something else. Where had Lise been? In whose company had she become drunk? Of late, in contrast to a former communicativeness, Lise had been singularly secretive as to her companions, {{and the manner in which}} her evenings were spent; and she, Janet, had grown too self-absorbed to be curious. Lise, with her shopgirl's cynical knowledge of life and its pitfalls and the high valuation at which she held her charms, had seemed secure from danger; but Janet recalled her discouragement, her threat to leave the Bagatelle. Since then there had been something furtive about her. Now, because that odour of alcohol Lise exhaled had destroyed in Janet the sense of exhilaration, of life on a higher plane she had begun to <b>feel,</b> and <b>filled</b> her with degradation, she hated Lise, felt for her sister no strain of pity. A proof, had she recognized it, that immorality is not a matter of laws and decrees, but of individual emotions. A few hours before she had seen nothing wrong in her relationship with Ditmar: now she beheld him selfish, ruthless, pursuing her for one end, his own gratification. As a man, he had become an enemy. Ditmar was like all other men who exploited her sex without compunction, but the thought that she was like Lise, asleep in a drunken stupor, that their cases differed only in degree, was insupportable.|$|R

The white canvass of a vessel was plainly visible, over a vast breadth of field-ice, {{a little to the}} northward of the island that lay {{directly}} opposite the cove. Although the sails of this stranger were spread, it was plain enough he was closely beset, if not actually jammed. From the first instant he saw the strange craft, Roswell had not a doubt of her character. He felt convinced it was his late consort, the Sea Lion of the Vineyard, which had found her way to the group by means of some hint that had fallen into Daggett's hands, if not by a positive nautical instinct.

On the contrary, {{it might be a good}} thing to have a consort in the event of any accident occurring to his own vessel. From the moment, then, that Gardiner felt certain of the character of the strange sail, his policy was settled in his own mind. It was to receive his old acquaintance with good will, and to help fill him up too, as soon as he had secured his own cargo, in order that they might sail for home in company. By his aid and advice, the other schooner might save a week in time at that most important season of the year; and by the experience and exertions of his people, a whole month in filling up might readily be gained.|$|R

5000|$|Ellen West’s {{life was}} marred by {{thoughts}} related to death anxiety. Towards {{the end of her}} life, it could be said that she had a death obsession. West was given a great variety of diagnoses including melancholia, severe obsessive neurosis, and schizophrenia. While her major problem dealt with food, as what started out as a diagnosis of anorexia nervosa morphed into bulimia nervosa with the fear of becoming fat through eating. This fixation caused her great depression, as her focus day in and out was on eating or not eating. This [...] "obsession with death" [...] became [...] "life's only goal" [...] and that the [...] "symbolization of life and death took place around the act of eating." [...] West’s fear of becoming fat caused her to welcome death as an acceptable outcome, as then she wouldn’t have to worry anymore. She was often quoted by her psychiatrist, Ludwig Binswanger, explaining how her life felt like a prison that could be only made better by dying. To West, her life felt empty and dull, and filling her body with food only made her <b>feel</b> worse. <b>Filling</b> herself with food actually made her feel empty. It was even suggested that suicide by starvation became her life’s purpose, whereas continuing to feed herself would be equal to committing murder on someone. This underlying issue of death obsession can be exemplified by other harmful behaviors that she engaged in. West reportedly did several dangerous things to invite illness and death, including riding horse dangerously, kissing children with scarlet fever, and standing outside naked after bathing. Her eventual death came after taking a lethal dose of poison. West’s psychiatrist Binswanger was quoted as saying, “She looked as she had never looked in life- calm and happy and peaceful.” He thought of her illness as a defense against anxieties which were heightened and overbalanced, but anxieties nonetheless.|$|R

30|$|To {{assess the}} face {{validity}} of the study, {{it is important to}} be aware that the opinions of both types of participants might be influenced by several factors [15]. To what extent the less-experienced laparoscopists are just polite or <b>feel</b> obliged to <b>fill</b> in a questionnaire in exchange for a chance to “play” with the model is difficult to measure. Another effect that must be considered is the “Pygmalion effect” named after Pygmalion, a king figure from ancient Greek mythology, who carved a sculpture out of stone so skillfully that he fell in love with it. In this setting, it might be that the answers of the experienced, but especially of the less-experienced laparoscopists, were influenced by the mere enthusiasm of the LASTT developers, who took part in the workshops and gave the demonstration. The less-experienced laparoscopists may be particularly susceptible to give favourable responses because they have been around for less time in the working field of surgery and because they are relatively unprotected against the tempting display of the model and instruments by industry. On the other hand, the more-experienced laparoscopists, trained by the classical apprentice–tutor model, may be more conservative in their opinion of surgical training novelties. Nevertheless, even if these phenomena are of influence, they were not reflected in the outcomes of the study as manifested in the strong uniformity of opinion amongst groups.|$|R

The answer is simple: at any level, thermodynamics is usually taught as a somewhat abstruse discipline where many students get lost in a maze of difficult concepts. However, thermodynamics is not as intricate a subject as most people <b>feel.</b> This book <b>fills</b> a niche between elementary textbooks and mathematically oriented treatises, and provides readers with a distinct approach to the subject. As indicated by the title, this book explains thermodynamic phenomena and concepts in physical terms before proceeding {{to focus on the}} requisite mathematical aspects. It focuses on the effects of pressure, temperature and chemical composition on thermodynamic properties and places emphasis on rapidly evolving fields such as amorphous materials, metastable phases, numerical simulations of microsystems and high-pressure thermodynamics. Topics like redox reactions are dealt with in less depth, {{due to the fact that}} there is already much literature available. Without requiring a background in quantum mechanics, this book also illustrates the main practical applications of statistical thermodynamics and gives a microscopic interpretation of temperature, pressure and entropy. This book is perfect for undergraduate and graduate students who already have a basic knowledge of thermodynamics and who wish to truly understand the subject and put it in a broader physical perspective. The book is aimed not at theoretical physicists, but rather at practitioners with a variety of backgrounds from physics to biochemistry for whom thermodynamics is a tool which would be better used if better understood...|$|R

The space he once {{occupied}} in the enormous stone frieze depicting {{the battle of the}} Giants against the Gods is empty. Some two thousand years ago the frieze covered the outer walls of the temple of Pergamon in Asia Minor. In the last third of the nineteenth century the remnants of the ancient monument were discovered by the German engineer Carl Humann and sent to Germany. The fragments were reassembled in the specially built Pergamon Museum in Berlin, the capital of Wilhelminian Germany, and were to signal from this point forward the late claims to power of German imperialism. The Pergamon frieze can still be seen in Berlin today. In the fall of 1937 - and here we are at the beginning of Peter Weiss's novel - three young men find themselves before the frieze. Two of them, Coppi and the narrator, whose name is never mentioned, are workers. The third, a sixteen-year-old named Heilmann, is a high school student. Coppi {{is a member of the}} illegal Communist Party, Heilmann and the narrator are sympathizers. All three are active in the antifascist resistance. In a lengthy discussion the three friends attempt to interpret the stone figures and events depicted in the frieze in a way which would make them relevant for their own present day struggle. They cannot, however, find Heracles. Other than a fragment of his name and the paw of a lion's skin, nothing remains of the leader of the Gods in the battle against the Giants. The [...] "leader" [...] of 1937, on the other hand, is an omnipresent force, even in the still halls of the Pergamon Museum, where uniformed SS troopers, their Nazi insignia clearly visible, mingle among the museum's visitors.
