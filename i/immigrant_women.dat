25|$|During the mid-20th century, under French {{influence}} and among upper classes, women {{started to take}} up their husbands' surname(s). From the 1960s onwards, this usage spread to the common people, again under French influence, this time, however, due to the forceful legal adoption of their husbands' surname which was imposed onto Portuguese <b>immigrant</b> <b>women</b> in France.|$|E

In response, the city made great advancements in the fire department, building codes, and workplace regulations.|$|E

25|$|Contrary to the {{development}} of most schools, All Hallows' School, as the first Catholic secondary school in Queensland, sought to serve those less fortunate in colonial society while operating under the same legislative framework as the more affluent grammar schools. Serving poorer, often Irish, Roman Catholic, <b>immigrant</b> <b>women</b> in the area of Fortitude Valley, the School did not raise the required subscription for government aid and, in a time of bitter sectarianism within Queensland, the school maintained fierce independence in curriculum from what was seen by many within the Catholic community as attempts by a hostile secular government at interference.|$|E

The authors conducted qualitative exploratory, in-depth interviews using grounded theory to examine domestic violence among nine <b>immigrant</b> Mexican <b>women</b> who were residing in a southwestern city. Dating patterns; parental influence; cultural concepts, such as familism andmachismo; and trying to keep the family together were subcategories that emerged in the data that led to three socially and culturally relevant hypotheses for preventing domestic violence for <b>immigrant</b> Mexican <b>women.</b> Social workers can use the findings to gain a better understanding of how to serve <b>immigrant</b> Mexican <b>women</b> who experience domestic violence...|$|R

25|$|She {{founded the}} National League of Women Freethinkers and its journal, La Nueva Mujer. She helped {{organize}} the first International Congress of Women in 1910, and later {{helped organize the}} first National Child Welfare Congress. Her application for a faculty position at her alma mater's Medical School was denied on grounds {{that she was a}} still a resident alien, prompting her to apply for Argentine citizenship. Single <b>immigrant</b> <b>women,</b> however, were not generally granted citizenship in Argentina. Lanteri married Dr. Alberto Renshaw in 1910, and following an eight-month-long lawsuit, she was granted citizenship in 1911. The marriage was in itself controversial, as he was 14 years younger than the bride. The same pretext was used to deny her enrollment in the Psychiatry course at her own alma mater's School of Medicine.|$|E
25|$|Women {{tend to have}} {{different}} occupational hazards and health issues than men in the workplace. Women get carpal tunnel syndrome, tendonitis, anxiety disorders, stress, respiratory diseases, and infectious diseases due to their work at higher rates than men. The reasons for these differences may be differences in biology or in the work that women are performing. Women's higher rates of job-related stress {{may be due to}} the fact that women are often caregivers at home and do contingent work and contract work at a much higher rate than men. Another significant occupational hazard for women is homicide, which was the second most frequent cause of death on the job for women in 2011, making up 26% of workplace deaths in women. <b>Immigrant</b> <b>women</b> are at higher risk for occupational injury than native-born women in the United States, due to higher rates of employment in dangerous industries.|$|E
25|$|Polish (and Italian) {{immigrants}} demonstrated high fecundity in the United States, {{and in a}} U.S. Congress {{report in}} 1911, Poles were noted as having the single highest birth rate. The 1911 Dillingham Commission had a section devoted to the Fecundity of <b>Immigrant</b> <b>Women,</b> {{using data from the}} 1900 Census. As per Dillingham's findings, there were 40 births per 1,000 Polish people, whereas the non-Polish birth rate was closer to 14 per 1,000. Historians debate the accuracy and sample group of this data, as many Polish immigrants arrived young and of child-bearing age, whereas other ethnics had a lengthy and sustained immigration policy with the United States, meaning multiple generations existed. In reports, the birth rate was very high for Poles and by 1910, the number of children born to Polish immigrants was larger than the number of arriving Polish immigrants. In Polish communities such as rural Minnesota, nearly three-fourths of all Polish women had at least 5 children. The Polish American baby boom lasted from 1906 to 1915 and then fell dramatically, as many of the immigrant mothers had passed out of their prime childbearing age. This was the highest birth rate for American Poles documented in the United States. During the 1920s and 1930s, Polish Americans were coming of age, developing ethnic fraternal organizations, baseball leagues, summer camps, scouting groups, and other youth activities. In large parts of Minnesota and Michigan, over half the population was under sixteen years old. Polish youths created nearly 150 street gangs in Chicago in the 1920s, and in Detroit and Chicago, created the single largest group of inmates in juvenile prisons.|$|E

40|$|Many are {{the texts}} of modern Greek {{literature}} in which immigration intersects with gender and sex or romance.
