Of more recent interest to the agricultural industry has been the facility offered by the <b>impact</b> <b>roller</b> to densify the ground, reduce soil permeability and hence have a significant effect in reducing irrigation water losses. Other potential benefits that arise from the use of the <b>impact</b> <b>roller</b> on the floors of water storage reservoirs, growth paddocks and channel banks include reducing the adverse effects on groundwater table fluctuations and soil salinity. Cost benefits also result from the more prudent use of the water resource.

40|$|The use of <b>impact</b> <b>rollers</b> has {{increased}} {{for many decades}} over {{a wide variety of}} applications {{in various parts of the}} world. Many manufacturers have made claims that <b>impact</b> compaction <b>rollers</b> could have an effect to 1 m or more. In addition, other positive features such as greater depth of influence and faster travel speed than conventional rollers are being reported from the field. However, there is a lack of theoretical explanations or scientific research information for how to operate these rollers. Hence, this study will focus on a geotechnical modeling that describes the behavior of soils during ground compaction using various <b>impact</b> <b>rollers</b> (e. g., triangular, Landpac 3 -sided, Landpac 5 -sided, and octagonal shapes). In addition, this study will estimate more precisely the depth of influence for <b>impact</b> <b>rollers.</b> To do so, the general purpose finite element computer program LS-DYNA is used for numerical predictions. The finite element study is carried out with three-dimensional models. A simplified elastic perfectly plastic model with the Druker-Prager yield criterion is used for soil modeling and rollers are treated as a rigid body (i. e., incompressible material). The result of this study compares well with existing field experiment data for estimating vertical stress profile and compaction features, and demonstrates that the <b>impact</b> <b>rollers</b> are appropriate for thick layers...|$|R
40|$|Rolling Dynamic Compaction (RDC) is {{a generic}} term {{associated}} with densifying ground using non-circular (<b>impact)</b> <b>rollers.</b> RDC is suited to deep fill applications {{because of the}} ability to compact ground efficiently by means of its faster operating speed (10 – 12 km/h) and greater depth of influence when compared to conventional circular rollers. Whilst conventional circular rollers are able to compact layer thicknesses typically in the range of 200 – 500 mm, thicker layers are able to be compacted using RDC. This paper discusses performance based specifications and the applicability of both the Standard and Modified Proctor compaction tests to RDC. For projects where <b>impact</b> <b>rollers</b> are used, the Modified Proctor test is strongly recommended as the energy imparted onto the soil is more representative than the Standard test.

30|$|It is {{important}} to note that whereas the computation of net effects requires statistically significant unconditional and conditional effects, a threshold may be apparent even when only the conditional effect is significant. Consistent with Asongu and De Moor (2017), the notion of threshold is in accordance with Cummins (2000) on the minimum level/threshold in language proficiency before rewards are acquired in a second language. In addition, the definition of threshold is also supported by the critical mass theory, which has been abundantly documented in the literature on economic development (see Roller and Waverman 2001; Ashraf and Galor 2013). A recent application of the threshold or critical mass theory based on interaction variables can be found in Batuo (2015). Therefore, from the perspective of this study, the concept of threshold is not different from: (i) the minimum requirement for the reaping of positive effects (Cummins 2000); (ii) conditions for U-shape and inverted U-shape dynamics (Ashraf and Galor 2013) and (iii) critical mass for positive <b>impacts</b> (<b>Roller</b> and Waverman 2001; Batuo 2015).|$|R
40|$|As a major {{component}} of research activities at Sydney and Adelaide Universities into various aspects of rolling dynamic compaction as performed with the “square” <b>impact</b> <b>roller,</b> an experimental test site has been established. The test site is approximately 100 m by 50 m, and {{is part of a larger}} industrial property in Wingfield, South Australia. Geologically, the site comprises approximately 1 - 2 m of non-engineered fill, overlying Estuarine deposits. The primary objectives of the work at the test site relate to quantifying the effects of the <b>impact</b> <b>roller</b> in terms of energy delivered to the ground and the ground response. Impact rollers with solid 4 -sided modules of mass 8 t and 12 t are utilised. A monitoring and testing regime has been developed that includes physical measurements of energy on and below the impact module, surface settlement and sub-surface layer compression measurements. Early results from the testing programme provide a basis for understanding and developing the relationship of delivered to transmitted energy for the particular impact modules used at this site, the dissipation of energy through the ground and the effects on the various strata at depth due to module mass and number of passes (or energy input). The output from this study will form the basis for modelling ground conditions at this site and the effects of the impact rolling. The data thus generated will support further studies into numerical modelling of rolling dynamic compaction and the on-going programme of testing at other sites with different geological characteristics.

40|$|Rolling Dynamic Compaction (RDC) {{involves}} a heavy non-circular module that rotates and falls to impact the ground dynamically; {{it has a}} greater depth of influence compared to conventional circular rollers. The depth of influence to which an <b>impact</b> <b>roller</b> can compact soil is known to vary, and is dependent upon factors such as soil type, moisture content and applied input energy, thus verification of impact rolling is particularly important to quantify {{the extent to which}} soil has been improved. This paper compares before and after compaction test results using three in situ testing methods, field nuclear density, dynamic cone penetrometer (DCP) and spectral analysis of surface waves (SASW), as well as the ground response due to RDC using earth pressure cells, accelerometers and surface settlement measurements used during the compaction trial.

40|$|M. A. (Sociology) Abstract: This study explores how {{the members}} of the C-Max Roller Derby League, based in Johannesburg, South Africa, {{construct}} their gender identities. Previous research has shown that <b>roller</b> derby <b>impacts</b> on how skaters construct their gendered selves, empowering them as women and athletes. This study adds {{to the understanding of the}} <b>impact</b> of <b>roller</b> derby, a context in which there is a dichotomy between masculinity and femininity, on the gender identities of participants. A qualitative approach was employed, using in-depth interviews and observation, in order to understand participants’ views on their participation in roller derby and how it consequently shapes their notions and experiences of gender. The study found that roller derby is a contested space in which the need to create an alternative environment for women is being penetrated by normative gendered notions of sporting behaviour. Despite the fact that roller derby is thought to be a context in which alternate gender arrangements exist, the findings show that patriarchal ideals continue to influence the women who participate in roller derby and that normative gender arrangements persist and dictate how gender is constructed and performed. The study also shows that, within the context of roller derby, femininity is expressed in a multiplicity of ways and that there is a constant interplay between expressions of masculinity and femininity. Finally, the research found that female skaters continue to struggle to establish their legitimacy as athletes within the male-dominated sporting domain of South Africa...|$|R

Roller surface structure parameters were determined by orthogonal polynomial regression design method. By processing the test data, a regression equation was obtained with stripes depth, number {{and the amount of}} wear as parameters. The results showed that: Stripes structure grinding rollers have better abrasion resistance than the light roller; The depth and the number of stripes have a greater impact on the abrasion resistance and there was an interaction between them; In the same conditions, when the stripe depth is fixed, the wear amount increases with the number of stripes increasing; when a fixed number of stripes, the wear amount decreases with stripes depth increasing...|$|R

In {{order to}} solve the problem of aeolian sand {{subgrade}} compaction, we studied the technology of impact compaction, applied it to the engineering practice and analyzed its effect with Rayleigh wave. The technology of impact compaction can combine the compaction of potential energy and kinetic energy and make it easier for the materials to reach their elastic stage. With the combined function of "knead-roll-impact", the <b>impact</b> compaction road <b>roller</b> can compact the soil body and offer 6 ～ 10 times impact force and 3 ～ 4 times the depth of influence more than the vibratory <b>roller.</b> The <b>impact</b> compaction methods of aeolian sand subgrade were put forward. The comparative field compaction tests between impact and vibratory compaction are carried through, which are detected by Rayleigh wave. The results show that the impact compaction can make the density of the aeolian sand subgrade 2 ～ 5 % higher than the vibratory compaction, and reach the influence depth of 7 metres. To sum up, the impact compaction can clearly increases the strength and stiffness of aeolian sand subgrade with a dynamic elastic modulus of 202. 63 MPa...|$|R

40|$|Dynamic {{compaction}} {{induced by}} heavy <b>impact</b> or vibratory <b>rollers</b> is acknowledged {{as the most}} powerful process to increase the shear resistance and to reduce the deformability of granular materials. Ground improvement techniques based on this principle are currently adopted to build artificial embankments and to enhance the mechanical response of in-situ soils. In an attempt to clarify the role of grain size distribution on the compactability of granular materials, a systematic laboratory experimental investigation was undertaken on a variety of quartz-limestone sands. Samples were prepared with ten different grain size distributions, by mixing three selected uniform sands with variable percentage. Each sample was subjected to different standard and modified Proctor compaction tests where the number of blows per layer was systematically varied (i. e. impact energy). The effectiveness of each 2 ̆ 2 Proctor 2 ̆ 2 technique was evaluated in terms of relative density. Test results indicate that compaction effectiveness is noticeably affected by the heterogeneity of soil composition, while a limited dependency on the water content is observed. A single correlation to predict the dry unit weight of sands combining coefficient of uniformity, specific gravity and compaction energy is proposed.

50|$|The MG 3 is an automatic, air-cooled, belt-fed short recoil-operated firearm. It {{features}} a roller locked bolt mechanism {{that consists of}} the bolt head, a pair of rollers, the striker sleeve, bolt body and return spring. The bolt is locked securely by a wedge-shaped striker sleeve, which forces two cylindrical rollers contained in the bolt head outward, and into corresponding recesses in {{the extension of the}} breech of the barrel. On firing, both the barrel and barrel extension recoil to the rear. The resulting impact (much like a Newton's cradle) moves the carrier to the rear withdrawing the wedge and both rollers as they are cammed inward and out of their sockets by fixed cams, unlocking the bolt head. The bolt carrier and bolt then continue to the rear together guided by fixed guides while the barrel and barrel extension return to battery. Upon return of the bolt forward, the <b>impact</b> of the <b>rollers</b> against the camming surfaces on the breech carry the rollers from their seats, and, together with the surfaces on the striker sleeve, force the rollers outward, locking the bolt head into the barrel extension and ensuring a complete lock. The bolt also houses a spring-loaded casing extractor and ejector. Ejection is carried out when the ejector strikes the buffer head, sending a push forward through the ejector bar, which hits the ejector pin. This pin pushes the top of the base of the cartridge, which is still held by the extractor at the base, causing the empty casing to rotate and eject downward through the ejection chute.|$|R
40|$|International audiencePermeating air {{is known}} to have a {{negative}} <b>impact</b> on the <b>roller</b> compaction process, because the feed is destabilized by the flow of escaping gas, causing pressure to build-up and potentially damage compacts at release. Airflow during powder roller compaction and its effect on the rolling process are investigated in the rolling direction (1 D), using an extension of the Johanson model for the solid. Fluid transport obeys Darcy's law, with permeability being a function of both material density and particle size, through the Kozeny-Carman relationship. In this modeling, the effect of the air pressure on the solid is neglected in the compaction zone. Assuming air at atmospheric pressure at the feeding angle and ignoring airflow through the gap, predictions of air pressure {{as a function of the}} rolling angle for bentonite material powder are presented and discussed. Results suggest the existence of two different stability zones within the operating conditions, where industrial systems could function without being affected by airflow effects. The model highlights the importance of the permeability/rotation speed ratio, which governs the proportion of air trapped in the compacts to the portion evacuated through the feed. We also investigate the effect of particle fragmentation during the rolling process. Finally, we provide guidelines for the scale-up of roller presses subjected to air flow issues, through a study of the effect of the system dimensions and rotation speed on the elimination of air. In spite of the lack of available experimental data, this model allows for a better understanding of how air escapes by diffusing through the material during the rolling process, and opens interesting perspectives for the mitigation of its effect on the process...|$|R
40|$|AbstractTablets make up {{approximately}} {{one third of}} all drug dosage forms which makes tablet manufacture a common process in the pharmaceutical industry. The unified compaction curve [1] is a model developed initially {{to look at the}} <b>impact</b> of the <b>roller</b> compaction conditions on the tablet strength. The tensile strength of the tablets made from formulations containing at least 50 % microcrystalline cellulose produced at roller compaction pressures were measured and the profiles were collapsed into a single master “unified compaction curve” (UCC). This allowed for the tablet strength to be predicted from the roller compaction condition and formulations and target the required tablet strength criterion set by standards or specifications [1]. The unified compaction curve was applied to investigate the effects of the wet granulation conditions in a 5 L Key granulator on the tablet tensile strength. The study was based on a placebo formulation comprising of 50 wt% microcrystalline cellulose, 50 wt% lactose and a 5 w/v% PVP (K 90) binder solution. The effects of the liquid level (20 - 50 wt%), wet massing time (0 - 10 minutes), binder flow rate (130 g/min and 280 g/min) and impeller speed (150, 285 and 600 rpm) on the tablet strength were explored. Scale-down experiments to a 1 L mixer bowl were also conducted. Tablets were produced on a single station carver press with controlled force. A series of compaction profiles were created to represent the relationship between the tablet tensile strength, compaction pressure and the granulation condition. By fitting the unified compaction curve model to the data using a shifting intercept approach, the profiles exploring each granulation condition collapsed onto a single master curve which predicts the tablet strength {{as a function of the}} liquid level, wet massing time or the binder flow rate. Increasing the liquid level and/or wet massing time caused a reduction in the tablet hardness when compressed at the same compaction force, and the reduction is postulated to be proportional to the effective compaction forces experienced during granulation, PWGC. The PWGC data further collapses onto a single master curve which is solely a function of the total number of impeller revolutions. Further characterization of the granules produced at these conditions showed that the UCC intercept parameter, PWGC was inversely proportional to the granule porosity, linking the granule microstructure directly and quantitatively to the tablet strength during compaction. This is a significant finding that will allow formulators to optimize tablet hardness via a simple adjustment to the granulation conditions...|$|R

The geometry of the solids considered gives rise to various contact configurations, from concentrated contacts with circular and elliptical configuration to those of finite line nature, {{as well as those of}} less concentrated form such as circular flat punches. The radii of curvature of mating bodies in contact or impact give rise to these various nonconforming contact configurations and affect their contact characteristics, from those considered as semi-infinite solids in accord with the classical Hertzian theory to those that deviate from it. Furthermore, layered solids have been considered, some with higher elastic modulus than that of the substrate material (such as hard protective coatings) and some with low elastic moduli, often employed as tribological coatings (such as solid lubricants). Other bonded layered solids behave in viscoelastic manner, with creep relaxation behaviour under load, and are often used to dampen structural vibration upon impact. Analytic models have been developed for all these solids to predict their contact and impact behaviour and obtain pressure distribution, footprint shape and deformation under both elastostatic and transient dynamic conditions. Only few solutions for thin bonded layered elastic solids have been reported for elastostatic analysis.
