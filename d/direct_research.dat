25|$|Though {{environmental}} enrichment {{research has been}} mostly done upon rodents, similar effects occur in primates, {{and are likely to}} affect the human brain. However, <b>direct</b> <b>research</b> upon human synapses and their numbers is limited since this requires histological study of the brain.

Sightings of the humpback whale (Megaptera novaeangliae), followed by southern rights (Eubalaena australis), are common between April and October, when the whales are migrating. Other marine mammals sometimes sighted at the islands include pygmy Bryde's whale (Balaenoptera edeni), orca (Orcinus orca), bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops aduncus), common dolphin (Delphinus delphis), and striped dolphin (Stenella coeruleoalba).|$|E
25|$|The game {{begins on}} January 1, 1999, with the player {{choosing}} a location {{for their first}} base on the Geoscape screen: a global view representation of Earth as seen from space (displaying X-COM bases and aircraft, detected UFOs, alien bases, and sites of alien activity). The player can view the X-COM bases and make changes to them, equip fighter aircraft, order supplies and personnel (soldiers, scientists and engineers), <b>direct</b> <b>research</b> efforts, schedule manufacturing of advanced equipment, sell alien artifacts on black market to raise money, and deploy X-COM aircraft to either patrol designated locations, intercept UFOs, or send X-COM ground troops on missions using transport aircraft.|$|E
500|$|However, {{there was}} another issue: since {{the passage of the}} Mansfield Amendment in 1969, DARPA had been under {{increasing}} pressure to fund [...] "mission-oriented <b>direct</b> <b>research,</b> rather than basic undirected research". Funding for the creative, freewheeling exploration that had gone on in the 60s would not come from DARPA. Instead, the money was directed at specific projects with clear objectives, such as autonomous tanks and battle management systems.|$|E

He argues that knowledge and technology are usually generated by what he calls [...] "stochastic tinkering" [...] rather than by top-down <b>directed</b> <b>research,</b> and has proposed option-like experimentation {{as a way to}} outperform <b>directed</b> <b>research</b> as a method of scientific discovery, an approach he terms convex tinkering.|$|R
