While we included extended introduction of the FreeLoader framework [57, 58] as well as our combination of prefix caching and collective download techniques [33], this paper proposes the novel RDPR technique as well as a new striping-enabled cache management algorithm. We also discussed methods to combine RDPR with prefix caching and collective download techniques. Overall, more than 60 % of the manuscript’s content has not been previously published...|$|R

40|$|This thesis proposes {{parasitic}} aware design {{techniques for}} concurrent Multi-Band <b>impedance</b> <b>matching</b> networks. Different concurrent L-matching networks are analyzed and the substantial impact of component non-idealities on matching performance is addressed. To counter these impacts, the design methodology is modified and the improvement is verified for different concurrent dual-band networks. The same techniques are extended for quad band concurrent L-matching networks. The proposed parasitic aware methods are validated through practical components from Coilcraft and Murata libraries (offchip) and UMC 0. 18 _um RFCMOS technology (on-chip). The results show considerable improvement in both off-chip and onchip scenarios. Hence, the proposed method is much useful in low power concurrent multi band RF circuit design.
