2500|$|Bendix-Stromberg {{engineers}} {{overcame the}} problems found with <b>float-type</b> <b>carburetors</b> {{by moving the}} fuel discharge nozzle to the carburetor adapter {{or in some cases}} at the [...] "eye" [...] of the supercharger, both below the throttle plates and by eliminating the float from the fuel metering system. The new [...] "pressure carburetor" [...] design replaced the float-operated fuel inlet valve with a servo-operated poppet-style fuel metering valve.|$|R

50|$|Fuel {{systems are}} usually simple, {{at least for}} petrol engines. The fuel tank may be placed above a float-type {{carburettor}} so that gravity is adequate to bring fuel to the carburettor, avoiding {{the need for a}} fuel pump. Alternatively, the tank may be placed below a carburettor which uses engine vacuum or crankcase pressure pulsations to lift fuel into the <b>carburetor.</b> <b>Float-type</b> carburettors can only be used when the engine is reliably vertical and without excessive vibration.|$|R

The [...] "A" [...] engines had no counterweights on the crankshaft, 5.75:1 compression ratio, 2:1 internal spur gear-type reduction gear boxes, 8.77:1 supercharger ratio, 9.5 in impeller, SAE #50 propeller shaft, a <b>float-type</b> <b>carburetor,</b> and produced [...] at 2800 rpm on 92 octane gasoline.|$|E
5000|$|Charles H. Garrett {{allegedly}} {{demonstrated a}} water-fuelled car [...] "for several minutes", which was reported on September 8, 1935, in The Dallas Morning News. The car generated hydrogen by electrolysis {{as can be}} seen by examining Garrett's patent, issued that same year. This patent includes drawings which show a carburetor similar to an ordinary <b>float-type</b> <b>carburetor</b> but with electrolysis plates in the lower portion, and where the float is used to maintain the level of the water. Garrett's patent fails to identify a new source of energy.|$|E
5000|$|Most {{aircraft}} of the 1920s and 1930s had a <b>float-type</b> <b>carburetor.</b> They {{are adequate}} for civil aircraft which normally fly upright, but present {{a problem for}} aerobatic aircraft which fly upside-down or otherwise are subject to negative G, especially military fighters. In a float carburetor, the float operates a valve which keeps the fuel level in the carburetor consistent despite varying demands. If the mixture is too rich, the float rises and restricts the fuel flowing in to the float chamber. When the mixture leans, the float falls and allows more fuel in. However, since the float is dependent on gravity to function, the float behaves opposite of its intended design when the aircraft is inverted. It will further enrich a too-rich mixture, or further lean a too-lean mixture. Either condition will cause the engine to stop running. If an airplane equipped with a <b>float-type</b> <b>carburetor</b> is flown under zero-G or negative-G conditions, the fuel metering cannot be relied upon to create a mixture that can be ignited, and the engine will stop running. The problem was keenly felt by the RAF during {{the first years of}} the war, as the Rolls-Royce Merlin equipped Hurricanes and the Spitfires suffered this effect, unlike the direct fuel injection engines of their German counterparts. The problem was solved by installing a flow-restricted orifice that opened only when flying inverted or under negative-G conditions (the R.A.E. restrictor was known as [...] "Miss Shilling's orifice"), but this was only a stopgap solution.|$|E

5000|$|... "D" [...] series engines were {{designed}} for pusher applications using propeller-speed extension shafts and remote thrust bearings mounted to the airframe. The military models were V-1710-9, -13, -23, and -41, producing [...] at 2600 rpm. Supercharger ratios were 6.23:1, 8.0:1 or 8.77:1, depending on altitude rating. These engines had the compression ratio increased to 6.65:1. Marvel MC-12 fuel injection, which was unsatisfactory and quickly replaced by a <b>float-type</b> <b>carburetor</b> on -9 and -13 models. Later dash number engines used Bendix pressure carburetors. These engines were being designed {{at the same time}} as the V-3420 engine, and shared many assemblies as they were developed.

5000|$|Leonard S. (Luke) Hobbs (1896-1977) was an American {{aeronautical}} engineer who started in 1920 with the Army Air Service at McCook Field in Dayton, Ohio and later worked for Stromberg Motor Devices Corporation. He {{was born in}} Carbon County, Wyoming. He developed the first <b>float-type</b> <b>carburetor</b> for aircraft engines that was capable of providing normal operation during inverted flight. In 1927 he became a research engineer at the Pratt & Whitney Aircraft Company and by 1944 was vice president of engineering for parent company United Aircraft Corporation. He won the prestigious 1952 Collier Trophy for [...] "designing and producing the P&W J57 turbojet engine". In 1956 was elected vice chairman of United Aircraft, retiring in 1958 but remaining on the company's board of directors until 1968.|$|E

40|$|The icing {{characteristics}} of two typical light-airplane engine induction systems were investigated using the carburetors and manifolds of engines in the horsepower ranges from 65 to 85 and 165 to 185. The smaller system {{consisted of a}} <b>float-type</b> <b>carburetor</b> with an unheated manifold and the larger system consisted of a single-barrel pressure-type carburetor with an oil-jacketed manifold. Carburetor-air temperature and humidity limits of visible and serious Icing were determined for various engine power conditions. Several. methods of achieving ice-free induction systems are discussed along with estimates of surface heating requirements of the various induct ion-system components. A study was also made of the icing {{characteristics of}} a typical light-airplane air scoop with an exposed filter and a modified system that provided a normal ram inlet with the filter located {{in a position to}} Induce inertia separation of the free water from the charge air. The principle of operation of float-type carburetors is proved to make them inherently more susceptible to icing at the throttle plate than pressure-type carburetors [...] The results indicated that proper jacketing and heating of all parts exposed to the fuel spray can satisfactorily reduce or eliminate icing in the <b>float-type</b> <b>carburetor</b> and the manifold. Pressure-type carburetors can be protected from serious Icing by proper location of the fuel-discharge nozzle combined with suitable application of heat to critical parts...|$|E
