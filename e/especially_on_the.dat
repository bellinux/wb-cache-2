5|$|His tenure {{was marked}} by {{controversy}} as he defended the Bush administration from accusations that political influence on science was distorting scientific research in federal agencies and that scientific evidence was being suppressed or ignored in policy decisions, <b>especially</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> topics of abstinence-only birth control education, climate change policy, and stem cell research. Marburger defended the Bush Administration from these accusations, saying they were inaccurate or motivated by partisanship, <b>especially</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> issue of science funding levels. Marburger continued to be personally respected by many of his academic colleagues.|$|E

5|$|About 40percent of the tributaries that {{originally}} flowed {{over the surface}} of the watershed were piped or relocated during urban development, <b>especially</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> north side of the main stem. Generally, the remaining free-flowing tributaries begin south of the main stem and run north; the major exception is Crystal Springs Creek, which begins as a groundwater discharge and flows south. The other major tributaries are Hogan, Kelley, Butler, Sunshine, and Badger creeks. Crystal Springs and Kelley creeks contribute more flow to the main stem than the other tributaries.|$|E
5|$|Acadia's border was not {{formally}} demarcated by the Treaty of Utrecht, {{which became a}} cause of ongoing friction between the British and French, <b>especially</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Isthmus of Chignecto, which both sides eventually fortified. The French interpreted the phrase ancient boundaries to imply only the peninsula of present-day Nova Scotia, thereby excluding the mainland between New England and the St. Lawrence, ÎLe St. Jean, and Cape Breton. This helped the Amerindians of Abenaquis, Malecites, and MicMacs to retain their sovereignty over their old hunting grounds.|$|E

5|$|Beginning in 1938 and {{throughout}} World War II, the SS enacted a procedure where offices and {{units of the}} SS could form smaller sub-units, known as SS-Sonderkommandos, to carry out special tasks, including large-scale murder operations. The use of SS-Sonderkommandos was widespread. According to former SS Sturmbannführer Wilhelm Höttl, not even the SS leadership knew how many SS-Sonderkommandos were constantly being formed, disbanded, and reformed for various tasks, <b>especially</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Eastern Front.|$|E
5|$|Besides {{the many}} {{literary}} sources, Eliot also draws {{on his personal}} feelings and experience, <b>especially</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> great stress that he felt while composing the poem. Similarly, Eliot used the image of pilgrims coming to America and the stories of them that were common throughout his childhood. In particular, his mother wrote poems about the pilgrims arriving in New England, and Eliot found information related to his family's history in a book called Sketch of the Eliot Family. The location, East Coker, was where Andrew Eliott, T. S. Eliot's ancestor, left when joining the pilgrimage.|$|E

5|$|Falco peregrinus madens, {{described}} by Ripley and Watson in 1963, {{is unusual in}} having some sexual dichromatism. If the Barbary falcon (see below) is considered a distinct species, it is sometimes placed therein. It {{is found in the}} Cape Verde Islands, and is non-migratory; it is endangered with only six to eight pairs surviving. Males have a rufous wash on crown, nape, ears, and back; underside conspicuously washed pinkish-brown. Females are tinged rich brown overall, <b>especially</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> crown and nape.|$|E
5|$|From the Abyssinian Crisis of 1935 onwards, the British built many pillboxes in Malta for defence {{in case of}} an Italian invasion. Many {{others were}} built during World War II.

5|$|Lactarius subdulcis {{is found}} in Europe; it does not occur in North America, {{although}} a number of similar brownish-orange species were formerly classified under this species. It {{is found in}} broad-leaved woodland, <b>especially</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> floor {{at the base of}} beech trees. Along with L. vellereus, L.subdulcis is the most common fungi found on beech trees. The mushrooms can be found from late summer to late autumn, and are common. They are found individually, or in small groups. They can also be found in fields, generally appearing in large batches, with groups of over a hundred mushrooms not uncommon.|$|E

5|$|Nuthatches are compact {{birds with}} short legs, {{compressed}} wings, and square 12-feathered tails. They have long, sturdy, pointed bills and strong toes with long claws. Nuthatches have blue-grey backs (violet-blue in some Asian species, which also have red or yellow bills) and white underparts, which are variably tinted with buff, orange, rufous or lilac. Although head markings vary between species, {{a long black}} eye stripe, with contrasting white supercilium, dark forehead and blackish cap is common. The sexes look similar, but may differ in underpart colouration, <b>especially</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> rear flanks and under the tail. Juveniles and first-year birds can be almost indistinguishable from adults.|$|E
5|$|Ruby and Sapphire {{received}} mostly positive reviews, though {{critics were}} divided in their {{assessment of the}} games, <b>especially</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> gameplay and graphics. Most of the complaints focused {{on the fact that}} the gameplay had not changed much since previous generations, and the connectivity issues revolving around the past generations. With the popularity of Pokémon waning at the time, the games sold less than previous generations. However, they were still critical and commercial successes; with around 16 million copies sold according to IGN, they are the best-selling games for the Game Boy Advance.|$|E
5|$|Since 1900, {{more than}} 15 large dams and many smaller ones {{have been built}} in the Willamette's {{drainage}} basin, and 13 of them are operated by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE). The dams are used primarily to produce hydroelectricity, to maintain reservoirs for recreation, and to prevent flooding. The river and its tributaries support 60 fish species, including many species of salmon and trout; this is despite the dams, other alterations, and pollution (<b>especially</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> river's lower reaches). Part of the Willamette Floodplain was established as a National Natural Landmark in 1987 and the river was named as one of 14 American Heritage Rivers in 1998.|$|E

The strong waves broke a boat from its moorings at Spanish Point. Not wanting to lose the ship, the owner, accompanied with two people, tried to save the vessel. One fell overboard before climbing aboard the boat. The three ventured the vessel through tornadoes and 20-foot (6m) waves, which dropped several feet {{of water in the}} ship; however, ultimately they safely arrived at Hamilton Harbour. Five charter boats capsized from the waves, while several others crashed against reefs. Strong waves collapsed a sea wall in Hamilton, causing traffic jams for one day until it was fixed.|$|E
5|$|The Catlins has a cool {{maritime}} temperate climate, somewhat {{cooler than}} {{other parts of}} the South Island, and strongly modified by the effect of the Pacific Ocean. Winds can reach considerable strength, <b>especially</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> exposed coast; most of the South Island's storms develop to the south or southwest of the island, and thus the Catlins catches the brunt of many of these weather patterns.|$|E

Toxic runoff from atop cliffs can affect them, and {{they may also be}} threatened by both natural and anthropogenic shading of cliffs due to increased tree growth at the cliff base, invasive vines overrunning the cliff face, or the piling of slash against the cliff after logging.|$|E
