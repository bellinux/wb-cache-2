It is a vandal state. There is a Russian writer who once described vandal states as Genghis Khan with a telegraph. Israel is Genghis Khan with a computer. I feel no emotion of affinity with that state. I <b>have</b> <b>some</b> <b>good</b> friends and their families there, and of course I would not want any of them to be hurt. That said, sometimes I feel that Israel has come out of the boils (sic) of the hell, a satanic state.|$|E

Since they matured {{in the same way as}} thysanurans with plenty of moultings as they were growing and very little difference between the adults and much younger individuals (unlike modern insects, which are hemimetabolous or holometabolous), there probably wasn't much room for adapting into different niches depending on age and stage. Also, it would have been difficult for an animal already adapted to a niche to make a switch to a new niche later in life based on age or size differences alone when these differences were not significant.|$|E

2500|$|In November 2009, Pitchfork ran an {{editorial}} feature which mentioned the Beach Boys as a [...] "looming figure" [...] throughout that summer's indie music scene termed the [...] "Summer of Chillwave" [...] elaborating {{that it is}} [...] "not to say that any of this music sounds like the Beach Boys, or even tries to. ... The Beach Boys exist in this music in an abstracted form-- an idea, rather than a sound, as it's often been ... Summertime now is about disorientation: 'Should Have Taken Acid With You'; 'The Sun Was High (And So Am I)'; You take the fantasy of [...] music-- the cars, the sand, the surf-- add a dollop of melancholy and a smudge of druggy haze, and you <b>have</b> <b>some</b> <b>good</b> music for being alone {{in a room with}} only a computer to keep you company." ...|$|E
2500|$|In Allen's opinion, she couldn't learn {{fast enough}} to make a first-rate movie, {{although}} she thought Marnie did <b>have</b> <b>some</b> <b>good</b> scenes in it. She took a lot of the responsibility for what is considered a very flawed movie, since Hitchcock loved her script so much so that he did not make as good a movie as he should have. Hitchcock would have made her a director but she told him no. Said Allen: [...] "It seems perfectly clear to me that any project takes a minimum of a year to direct. I like to get things on and over with. ... Did you ever hear the phrase, 'the lady proposes, the studio disposes'? I didn’t make it up. I would never propose myself as a director." [...] Under Hitchcock's mentoring, Allen developed the screenwriting talent she would use the rest of her career. Allen wrote that she never felt discriminated against. While being one of the rare female screenwriters in Hollywood in the 1960s, she said [...] "almost all of the men I worked with were supportive. If I was getting a bum rap somewhere, I didn’t know it." ...|$|E
2500|$|A review from Alan Bisbort {{printed in}} The Daily Tar Heel had a {{headline}} that deemed the album [...] "cosmic hokum". Bisbort wrote about his criticisms of its concept {{and the idea}} of the group, [...] "who went East, got a shot of knowledge, came back West, had lots of money at their disposal ... and decided to cut an album guaranteed to give shortcut answers to the question for the multitude". He did not dismiss the album entirely, and recognised the group's musical talents. Tom Von Malder, for The Daily Herald, thought Yes [...] "seldom disappoints", but named Tales an exception, with [...] "Ritual" [...] being the only track that lives up to the strong material on Close to the Edge and Yessongs as it is the [...] "most cohesive, most lyrical of all". He thought the remaining three sides <b>have</b> <b>some</b> <b>good</b> music, but are too scattered, and claimed the album's concept is [...] "a bit too obtuse for a rock album". Holly Spence, in the Lincoln Evening Journal, called Tales a unique and creative album that displays an [...] "inventive combination of sounds and rhythms" [...] that is more interesting than the [...] "dull repetitive noise" [...] that she thought was typical of rock music at the time.|$|E

2500|$|Most of {{the best}} {{survivals}} had been converted to churches (and sometimes later mosques), which some remain. [...] Often the porticos were walled in between the columns, and the original cella front and side walls largely removed to create a large single space in the interior. [...] Rural areas in the Islamic world <b>have</b> <b>some</b> <b>good</b> remains, which had been left largely undisturbed. In Spain some remarkable discoveries (Vic, Cordoba, Barcelona) {{were made in the}} 19th century when old buildings being reconstructed or demolished were found to contain major remains encased in later buildings. In Rome, Pula, and elsewhere some walls incorporated in later buildings have always been evident. [...] The squared-off blocks of temple walls have always been attractive for later builders to reuse, while the large pieces of massive columns were less easy to remove and make use of; hence the podium, minus facing, and some columns are often all that remain. [...] In most cases loose pieces of stone have been removed from the site, and some such as capitals may be found in local museums, along with non-architectural items excavated, such as terracotta votive statuettes or amulets, which are often found in large numbers. [...] Very little indeed survives in place from the significant quantities of large sculpture that originally decorated temples.|$|E
