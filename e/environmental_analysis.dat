5|$|A {{peroxidase}} enzyme {{known as}} MroAPO (Marasmius rotula aromatic peroxygenase) is attracting research interest for possible applications in biocatalysis. In general, enzymes that catalyze oxygen-transfer reactions are of great utility in chemical synthesis since they work selectively and under ambient conditions. Fungal peroxidases can catalyze oxidations {{that are difficult}} for the organic chemist, including those involving aromatic substrates such as aniline, 4-aminophenol, hydroquinone, resorcinol, catechol, and paracetamol. The M.rotula enzyme is the first fungal peroxygenase that can be produced in high yields. It is highly stable over a wide pH range, and {{in a variety of}} organic solvents. The enzyme has other potential for use as a biosensor for aromatic substances in <b>environmental</b> <b>analysis</b> and drug monitoring.|$|E

25|$|Haiti {{has seen}} a {{dramatic}} reduction of forests due to the excessive and increasing use of charcoal as fuel for cooking. Recent in-depth studies of satellite imagery and <b>environmental</b> <b>analysis</b> regarding forest classification conclude an accurate estimate of approximately 30% tree cover, a stark decrease in the 60% forest cover in 1925. Despite recent in-depth studies, the notoriously unsubstantiated 2% forest cover estimate has been widely circulated in media and in discourse concerning the country. Despite the drastic underestimation of Haiti's forest cover, {{the country has been}} significantly deforested over the last 50 years, resulting in the desertification of portions of the Haitian territory.|$|E

While the PANYNJ had been acquiring land for ARC along its route, acquisition south of the station has not begun. It is likely the entire block would be razed and made available for highrise construction after completion of the station.
