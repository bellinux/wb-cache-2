40|$|Engineered {{cementitious}} composites (ECC) are {{a class of}} high-performance fiber reinforced cementitious composite with strain hardening and multiple cracking properties. For a reinforced concrete member, substitution of conventional concrete with ECC can significantly improve the deformation characteristics in terms of reinforced composite tensile or shear strength and energy dissipation ability. In this paper, a number of RC/ECC composite beam-column joints have been tested under reversed cyclic loading to study the effect of substitution of concrete with ECC in the <b>joint</b> <b>zone</b> on the seismic behaviors of composite members. The experimental parameters include shear reinforcement ratio in the <b>joint</b> <b>zone,</b> axial load level on the column and substitution of concrete with ECC or not. According to the test results, for the specimens without shear reinforcement in the <b>joint</b> <b>zone,</b> substitution of concrete with ECC in the <b>joint</b> <b>zone</b> cannot change the brittle shear failure in the <b>joint</b> <b>zone,</b> but can significantly increase the load capacity and ductility of the beam-column joint specimens, {{as well as the}} energy dissipation ability due to high ductility and shear strength of ECC material. For the specimens with insufficient or proper shear reinforcement ratio, substitution of concrete with ECC in the <b>joint</b> <b>zone</b> can lead to failure mode change from brittle shear failure in the <b>joint</b> <b>zone</b> to a more ductile failure mode, i. e. flexural failure {{at the base of the}} beam, with increased load capacity, ductility and energy dissipation ability. Increase of axial load on column and shear reinforcement in the <b>joint</b> <b>zone</b> have little effect on seismic behaviors of the members when they failed by flexural failure at the base of beam. In a word, the substitution of concrete with ECC in the <b>joint</b> <b>zone</b> was experimentally proved to be an effective method to increase the seismic resistance of beam-column joint specimens...|$|E

40|$|The Nanling Range {{located in}} South China is a {{world-class}} tungsten province. Those tungsten deposits are spatially and temporally {{associated with the}} granitic magmatism during the Late Mesozoic (J(2) -K- 2). It is common that alteration halos decrease with increasing depth at the vein-type tungsten deposits. However, the mechanisms forming the alteration characteristics are still enigmatic. In this contribution, we investigate the influences of variable fluid density and viscosity on the fluid flow and species diffusion from fractures to adjacent wallrock at the Dajishan tungsten deposit using finite element based numerical experiments. Fluid density has a negative influence on the transient pressure-driven fluid flow at Dajishan. Large-density fluids slow fluid flow and heat transfer. High-viscosity fluids flow slowly. Variations of fluid viscosity at Dajishan are large and influence hydrothermal fluid flow and species diffusion from fractures to surrounding wallrock. Depth-dependent porosity and permeability of wallrock are effective mechanisms forming the alteration halos at Dajishan. Hydraulic and geometric characteristics of <b>joint</b> <b>zones</b> influence diffusion of chemical species at {{the initial stages of}} hydrothermal fluids injected into fractures. High-permeability narrow <b>joint</b> <b>zones</b> favor formation of thick alteration halos at shallower levels. Depth-dependent wallrock porosity also impedes diffusion of metals from fractures to adjacent wallrock increasing ore formation efficiency at Dajishan. (C) 2016 Elsevier B. V.

40|$|In seismic {{analysis}} of moment-resisting frames, beam-column connections are often modeled with rigid <b>joint</b> <b>zones.</b> However, {{it has been}} demonstrated that, in ductile reinforced concrete (RC) moment-resisting frames designed based on current codes (to say nothing of older non-ductile frames), the <b>joint</b> <b>zones</b> are in fact not rigid, but rather undergo significant shear deformations that contribute greatly to global drift. Therefore, the "rigid joint" assumption may result in misinterpretation of the global performance characteristics of frames and could consequently lead to miscalculation of strength and ductility demands on constituent frame members. The primary objective {{of this paper is}} to propose a rational method for estimating the hysteretic joint shear behavior of RC connections and for incorporating this behavior into frame analysis. The authors tested four RC edge beam-column-slab connection subassemblies subjected to earthquake-type lateral loading; hysteretic joint shear behavior is investigated based on these tests and other laboratory tests reported in the literature. An analytical scheme employing the modified compression field theory (MCFT) is developed to approximate joint shear stress vs. joint shear strain response. A connection model capable of explicitly considering hysteretic joint shear behavior is then formulated for nonlinear structural analysis. In the model, a joint is represented by rigid elements located along the joint edges and nonlinear rotational springs embedded in one of the four hinges linking adjacent rigid elements. The connection model is able to well represent the experimental hysteretic joint shear behavior and overall load-displacement response of connection subassemblies. close 243...|$|R

In this paper, the compressive tests on this joint were carried out after the cyclic reversed loading. First the cyclic loading experiment results were introduced briefly, then the compressive tests were presented. The bearing capacity, crack patterns, deformation, strain of the reinforcements of the specimens were studied. These specimens were also compared with the other specimens only under compressive test. The results show that the specimens have good ductility. The concrete of the reinforced concrete (RC) ring beam cracked before the yield of the steel ring bars or the buckling of the steel tube. Although the cyclic loading caused some damage on the ring beam, it had few effects on the axial bearing capacity.

Finally, a case study is further illustrated with excavation of an underground pumping house using the proposed methodology to analyze the effect of the steep joints on the surrounding rock stability. Compared to the isotropic condition, when considering the layered anisotropic property with different horizontal and normal elastic modulus, surrounding rock experiences more stress disturbance that resulting in increased plastic zones, dissipation energy and deformation around opening, which is unfavorable for the stability of surrounding rock of the underground caverns.

40|$|AbstractIn the {{friction}} welding of dissimilar base metals occurs an uneven heating {{in the outside}} and inside zones of materials what causes appearance of various structures in the <b>joint</b> <b>zone.</b> Considering that the objective is achieving of the homogeneous welded joint, an imperative is to analyze the microstructure of the realized welded joint.

40|$|ABSTRACT: This study {{represents}} {{an effort to}} predict the bearing strength, failure modes, and failure load of bolted joints in foam-core sandwich composites. The studied joints {{have been used in}} a light full composite airplane. By using solid laminates, a new design for the <b>joint</b> <b>zone</b> is developed. These solid laminates include a number of glass plies with total thickness equal to core thickness. The effect of solid laminate size and interface angle of foam–solid laminate in the bonding zone on the bearing strength, failure loads and type of modes are investigated. The numerical study is performed using 3 D FEM in ANSYS commercial code. Tsai–Wu failure criterion is used in the failure analysis. The results indicate that the most important parameter in the proposed <b>joint</b> <b>zone</b> design is the foam–solid laminate interface angle which plays an important role on the value of failure criterion (damage) in the bonding zone. Also, the use of squared shaped solid laminate as compared with a circular laminate will decrease the criterion value significantly. Finally, the influence of solid laminate size and interface angle on the buckling strength was discussed. As obtained through eigenvalue buckling analysis, the increase of solid laminate size or interface angle could result in considerable higher buckling strength.
