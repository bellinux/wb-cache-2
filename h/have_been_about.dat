5|$|Again {{assisted}} by convict laborers and two army sergeants, Dubois began searching along the Solo River near Trinil in August 1891. His team soon excavated a molar (Trinil 1) and a skullcap (Trinil 2). Its characteristics were a long cranium with a sagittal keel and heavy browridge. Dubois first {{gave them the}} name Anthropopithecus ("man-ape"), as the chimpanzee was sometimes known at the time. He chose this name because a similar tooth found in the Siwalik Hills in India in 1878 had been named Anthropopithecus, and because Dubois first assessed the cranium to <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>about</b> , closer to apes than to humans.|$|E
5|$|Antoninus Pius soon {{reversed}} the containment policy {{of his predecessor}} Hadrian, and Urbicus was ordered to begin the reconquest of Lowland Scotland by moving north. Between 139 and 140 he rebuilt a fort at Corbridge and by 142 or 143, commemorative coins were issued celebrating a victory in Britain. It is therefore likely that Urbicus led the reoccupation of southern Scotland , probably using the 2nd Augustan Legion. He evidently campaigned against several British tribes (possibly including factions of the northern Brigantes), certainly against the lowland tribes of Scotland, the Votadini and Selgovae of the Scottish Borders region, and the Damnonii of Strathclyde. His total force may <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>about</b> 16,500 men.|$|E
5|$|Christiansen (1998) {{estimated}} that the leg bones of Tyrannosaurus were not significantly stronger than those of elephants, which are relatively limited in their top speed and never actually run (there is no airborne phase), and hence proposed that the dinosaur's maximum speed would <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>about</b> , {{which is about the}} speed of a human sprinter.

5|$|Ferugliotherium {{was much}} smaller than the sudamericids Gondwanatherium and Sudamerica, and its body mass is {{estimated}} to <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>about</b> 70g (2.5oz). Unlike the hypsodont (high-crowned) sudamericids, Ferugliotherium has brachydont (low-crowned) molariform teeth that are supported by at least two roots, not a single massive root. The direction of wear on the teeth indicates that Ferugliotherium, Gondwanatherium, and Sudamerica all had palinal jaw movement (i.e., the lower jaw moved backwards during the power stroke of chewing)—a feature otherwise only seen in multituberculates among mammals.|$|E
5|$|The first {{discussion}} {{of improving the}} intersection and grade crossing was a study in 1898, since which there <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>about</b> three dozen more. The most recent, a 2009 study of the downtown area, examined the possibility of depressing Route 126 under the grade crossing and intersection {{as well as several}} other alternatives including bypasses. The Route 126 depression was deemed to create barriers to walkability downtown, and the recommended alternative was to depress Route 135 under the intersection to prevent it from being affected by trains passing through the grade crossing. Funds have not yet become available for final design and construction.|$|E
5|$|The {{measurements}} for Kronan {{were recorded in}} contemporary navy lists.

The draft varied depending on how heavily she was laden, but with full stores, ammunition and armaments it would <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>about</b> 6.2–6.8m (20–22ft).

5|$|In 1629, Isaac Beeckman {{proposed}} {{an experiment in}} which a person observes the flash of a cannon reflecting off a mirror about one mile (1.6km) away. In 1638, Galileo Galilei {{proposed an}} experiment, with an apparent claim to having performed it some years earlier, to measure the speed of light by observing the delay between uncovering a lantern and its perception some distance away. He was unable to distinguish whether light travel was instantaneous or not, but concluded that if it were not, it must nevertheless be extraordinarily rapid. In 1667, the Accademia del Cimento of Florence reported that it had performed Galileo's experiment, with the lanterns separated by about onemile, but no delay was observed. The actual delay in this experiment would <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>about</b> 11 microseconds.|$|E
5|$|In 1990, the MTA {{proposed}} a rail line connecting LaGuardia Airport and John F. Kennedy International Airport. The line would have operated over the Grand Central Parkway and the Van Wyck Expressway. There would be stations at Shea Stadium and Jamaica. The system was proposed to cost $2billion. The MTA {{estimated that the}} rail link would take 30minutes from Kennedy to LaGuardia, {{and the frequency of}} service would initially be every 15minutes. There would be a two-track alignment with one track for each direction, as well as at least two trains heading in each direction at all times. If the link were built, the average travel time from Manhattan to Kennedy would <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>about</b> 45minutes using the Long Island Rail Road, including transfers. To LaGuardia, the average travel time from the Grand Central station using the IRT Flushing Line would be 47minutes.|$|E
5|$|Other human {{impacts on}} the {{atmosphere}} include the air pollution in cities, the pollutants including toxic chemicals like nitrogen oxides, sulfur oxides, volatile organic compounds and airborne particulate matter that produce photochemical smog and acid rain, and the chlorofluorocarbons that degrade the ozone layer. Anthropogenic particulates such as sulfate aerosols in the atmosphere reduce the direct irradiance and reflectance (albedo) of the Earth's surface. Known as global dimming, the decrease is estimated to <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>about</b> 4% between 1960 and 1990 although the trend has subsequently reversed. Global dimming may have disturbed the global water cycle by reducing evaporation and rainfall in some areas. It also creates a cooling effect and this may have partially masked the effect of greenhouse gases on global warming.|$|E

5|$|The Girls He Left Behind Him and The Iron Clad Lover were {{released}} {{together on a}} single reel, approximately 1,000 feet in length, on December 9, 1910. Both films are comedies, but Thanhouser advertisements refer to The Girls He Left Behind Him as a drama. The individual lengths of the reels are not known for certain, but the Thanhouser Company Film Preservation lists The Girls He Left Behind Him as being three-quarters of a reel and The Iron Clad Lover as half a reel in length. This is listed as an approximation of the relative expected lengths of the production, which could <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>about</b> 625 feet and 400 feet in length and still be a single reel. Very few advertisements for the films have been found, but the films likely had a wide national release. One advertisement featuring both films was found in Missouri, but The Girls He Left Behind Him was advertised without its other half and with slightly different spellings in Wisconsin and another Missouri theater. Selig would release a similarly titled work The Girl He Left Behind in 1912.|$|E
5|$|The {{lifespan}} of the Columbian mammoth {{is thought}} to <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>about</b> 80 years. The lifespan of a mammal is related to its size; Columbian mammoths are larger than modern elephants, which have a lifespan of about 60 years. The age of a mammoth can be roughly determined by counting the growth rings of its tusks when viewed in cross section. However, ring-counting {{does not account for}} a mammoth's early years; early growth is represented in tusk tips, which are usually worn away. In the remainder of the tusk each major line represents a year, with weekly and daily lines found in between. Dark bands correspond to summer, making it possible to determine the season in which a mammoth died. Tusk growth slowed when foraging became more difficult, such as during illness or when a male mammoth was banished from the herd (male elephants live with their herds until about the age of ten).|$|E
5|$|Yagan would <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>about</b> 35 {{years old}} in 1829 when British {{settlers}} landed {{in the area and}} established the Swan River Colony. For {{the first two years of}} the colony, relations between settlers and Noongar were generally amicable, as there was little competition for resources. The Noongar welcomed the white settlers as Djanga, the returned spirits of their dead. Historical reports noted the two groups shared fish. As time passed, conflicts between the two cultures gradually became more frequent. The settlers incorrectly thought that the Noongar were nomads who had no claim to the land over which they roamed. Colonists fenced off land for grazing and farming according to their traditional practices of land use.|$|E

5|$|At {{the age of}} seven, Bede was sent, as a puer oblatus, to {{the monastery}} of Monkwearmouth by his family to be educated by Benedict Biscop and later by Ceolfrith. Bede does not say whether it was already {{intended}} {{at that point that}} he would be a monk. It was fairly common in Ireland at this time for young boys, particularly those of noble birth, to be fostered out as an oblate; the practice was also likely to have been common among the Germanic peoples in England. Monkwearmouth's sister monastery at Jarrow was founded by Ceolfrith in 682, and Bede probably transferred to Jarrow with Ceolfrith that year. The dedication stone for the church has survived to the present day; it is dated 23 April 685, and as Bede would have been required to assist with menial tasks in his day-to-day life it is possible that he helped in building the original church. In 686, plague broke out at Jarrow. The Life of Ceolfrith, written in about 710, records that only two surviving monks were capable of singing the full offices; one was Ceolfrith and the other a young boy, who according to the anonymous writer had been taught by Ceolfrith. The two managed to do the entire service of the liturgy until others could be trained. The young boy was almost certainly Bede, who would <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>about</b> 14.|$|E
5|$|Not {{long after}} his {{intrusion}} into the Islesperhaps in 1113 or 1114Domnall {{appears to have}} been either driven out by force, or drawn back to Ireland in an attempt to capitalise on Muirchertach's failing health. This would appear to <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>about</b> the point when Amlaíb mac Gofraid began his own forty-year reign in the Isles. The latter, who apparently spent a considerable part of his childhood at the court of Henry I, King of England (died 1135), may well have enjoyed the English king's assistance in assuming control of the Isles, and perhaps precipitated Domnall's departure. Whatever the cause for Domnall's return to Ireland, he certainly predeceased his rival uncle, and was killed by Toirdelbach Ua Conchobair, King of Connacht (died 1156), as the Annals of Inisfallen, the sixteenth-century Annals of Loch Cé, the Annals of the Four Masters, the fourteenth-century Annals of Tigernach, and the Annals of Ulster, all report Domnall's death {{at the hands of the}} Connachta in 1115. In fact, Toirdelbach Ua Conchobair had invaded Thomond earlier that year, and the Annals of Tigernach elaborates that he had installed Domnall as King of Thomond at that point. This source further reveals that Domnall had afterwards turned against Toirdelbach Ua Conchobair, who in turn invaded Thomond and had Domnall eliminated.|$|E
5|$|Spawned by {{a weather}} system that had {{originated}} in Kansas, an EF-4 tornado slammed into Harrisburg {{early on the}} morning of February 29, 2012. The tornado touched down just north of Carrier Mills at 4:51a.m., destroyed a church and damaged houses along Town Park Road, and then traveled ENE through the Harrisburg Coal Field just north of Ledford, and then went through Liberty, where it damaged Harrisburg Middle School. The tornado then reached the south-western edge of the city at 4:56a.m., specifically Dorrisville, which suffered significant property damage, and then churned eastward to Gaskins City which was nearly leveled; 7 people were confirmed dead in that area, most killed in an apartment complex that was crushed by another residence, and 110 were injured overall. On June 3, another victim died in the hospital from their injuries, raising the death toll to 8. Harrisburg Medical Center was also significantly damaged in Gaskins City. Peak winds were estimated to <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>about</b> 180mph, and the width of the tornado path was 275 yards, traveling 26.5 miles. In Harrisburg, more than 200 houses, and about 25 businesses were destroyed or damaged heavily. At least 10 houses and other buildings were leveled completely, and several structures were displaced from their foundations. Early estimates indicated nearly 40% of the city was damaged or destroyed. The following night, a mandatory curfew was enforced in the effected areas, from 6 p.m. through 6 a.m. Counting the damage and death toll, it was reported to be the worst storm since the Joplin, Missouri tornado. Harrisburg Unit 3 schools were closed until March 5, 2012, and later they offered trauma counseling to students after reopening.|$|E

5|$|The {{academic}} {{debate about}} Anne's birth date focuses on two key dates: 1501 and 1507. Eric Ives, a British historian and legal expert, advocates the 1501 date, while Retha Warnicke, an American scholar {{who has also}} written a biography of Anne, prefers 1507. The key piece of surviving written evidence is a letter Anne wrote sometime in 1514. She wrote it in French to her father, who was still living in England while Anne was completing her education at Mechelen, in the Burgundian Netherlands, now Belgium. Ives argues that {{the style of the}} letter and its mature handwriting prove that Anne must <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>about</b> thirteen {{at the time of its}} composition, while Warnicke argues that the numerous misspellings and grammar errors show that the letter was written by a child. In Ives' view, this would also be around the minimum age that a girl could be a maid of honour, as Anne was to the regent, Margaret of Austria. This is supported by claims of a chronicler from the late 16th century, who wrote that Anne was twenty when she returned from France.|$|E
5|$|The {{series of}} events that caused Kean to change the {{direction}} of DeChow's attack toward Komam-ni began at 01:00, September 3. The 1st Battalion, 35th Infantry, protruded farther westward at this time than any other unit of the UN forces in Korea. Behind its positions on Sibidang-san the main supply route and rear areas were in North Korean hands, and only in daylight and under escort could vehicles travel the road. On Sibidang-san the battalion had held its original positions after the heavy fighting of September 1, completely surrounded by barbed wire, booby traps, and flares, with all supporting weapons inside its tight perimeters. The battalion had the advantage of calling for protective artillery fire covering all approaches. An hour after midnight a North Korean assault struck the battalion. The fight there continued until dawn September 3, when the 1st Battalion, 35th Infantry, counted 143 North Korean dead in front of its positions, and on that basis estimated that the total North Korean casualties must <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>about</b> 500 men. The 35th units also had the advantage of well-constructed strong points throughout the battle which the North Koreans could not penetrate.|$|E
