5|$|Wellington's initial dispositions were {{intended}} {{to counter the threat}} of Napoleon enveloping the Coalition armies by moving through Mons to the south-west of Brussels. This would <b>have</b> <b>pushed</b> Wellington closer to Bl√ºcher, but may have cut Wellington's communications with his base at Ostend. In order to delay Wellington's deployment, Napoleon spread false intelligence which suggested that Wellington's supply chain from the channel ports would be cut.|$|E
5|$|Poverty may <b>have</b> <b>pushed</b> Sien {{back into}} prostitution; the home became less happy and Van Gogh {{may have felt}} family life was irreconcilable with his artistic development. Sien gave her {{daughter}} to her mother, and baby Willem to her brother. Willem remembered visiting Rotterdam {{when he was about}} 12, when an uncle tried to persuade Sien to marry to legitimise the child. He believed Van Gogh was his father, but the timing of his birth makes this unlikely. Sien drowned herself in the River Scheldt in 1904.|$|E

5|$|The Khawalid {{brothers}} {{share an}} anti-West conservative ideology. They {{believe that the}} West is conspiring with Iran against Bahrain and other Gulf Cooperation Council countries and often accuse the United States of secretly supporting the Bahraini opposition. They are allied with Saudi Arabia and Sunni Islamist groups, and hold an anti-Shia ideology, viewing them as a fifth column to Iran. Based on their beliefs, the Khawalid brothers <b>have</b> <b>pushed</b> a security approach {{to deal with the}} Shia instead of political reforms, and have allegedly used sectarianism as a political tool.|$|E
5|$|Until the 1990s, {{there was}} little focus on {{expansion}} of the system because the system {{was in a state}} of disrepair, and funds were allocated to rebuilding and repairing the existing system. However, in the 1990s, with the system in better shape, the construction of the Second Avenue Subway was looked into again. Construction of the Second Avenue Subway started in 2007, and the first phase was completed in 2017. Since the 1990s, public officials and organizations such as the Regional Plan Association <b>have</b> <b>pushed</b> for the further expansion of the system. Projects such as the TriboroRx, a circumferential line connecting the outer boroughs, the reuse of the Rockaway Beach Branch, and the further expansion of the Second Avenue Subway have all been proposed, albeit unfunded.|$|E
5|$|Since Roman times, silting {{and land}} {{reclamation}} in the Pevensey Levels <b>have</b> <b>pushed</b> the coastline out by about , leaving the castle landlocked. The land between the castle {{and the sea}} is now a flat marshland drained by a network of ditches and sewers or field drains. The modern village of Pevensey is situated mostly {{to the east of}} the castle, {{at the end of the}} ancient peninsula. Castle Road (the B2191) curves around the Roman north wall and connects Pevensey to the nearby village of Westham. A public footpath crosses the interior of the castle, linking the two villages. An area of reclaimed land, formerly part of the Pevensey tidal lagoon but now marshland and fields crossed by the Eastbourne to Hastings railway line, is situated immediately to the south of the castle.|$|E

Pakistan opposes India's entry into the OIC.|$|R

5|$|Since 1990, the Tower of London {{has been}} {{cared for by}} an {{independent}} charity, Historic Royal Palaces, which receives no funding from the Government or the Crown. In 1988, the Tower of London {{was added to the}} UNESCO list of World Heritage Sites, in recognition of its global importance and to help conserve and protect the site. However, recent developments, such as the construction of skyscrapers nearby, <b>have</b> <b>pushed</b> the Tower towards being added to the United Nations' Heritage in Danger List. The remains of the medieval palace have been open to the public since 2006. Visitors can explore the chambers restored to their former glory, once used by past kings and queens. Although the position of Constable of the Tower remains the highest position held at the Tower, the responsibility of day-to-day administration is delegated to the Resident Governor. At least six ravens are kept at the Tower at all times, in accordance with the belief that if they are absent, the kingdom will fall. They are under the care of the Yeomen Warders. The earliest known reference to a Tower raven is a picture from 1883. As well as having ceremonial duties, the Yeoman Warders provide guided tours around the Tower. Just over 2.7 million people visited the Tower of London in 2016.|$|E

25|$|Over {{the years}} since the last trolley ran in 1954, many people <b>have</b> <b>pushed</b> for the {{reintroduction}} of rail transport in the Twin Cities.

About 350 aircraft are expected to be ordered to replace the T-38, but further purchases could push the overall purchase to over 1,000.
