5|$|At {{the end of}} the ventral {{scales of}} the snake is an anal plate that protects the opening to the cloaca (a shared opening for waste and {{reproductive}} material to pass) on the underside near the tail. This anal scale may be single or divided <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>pair.</b> The part of the body beyond the anal scale is considered to be the tail.|$|E
5|$|Biological {{structures}} or sequences {{in different}} taxa are homologous {{if they are}} derived from a common ancestor. Homology thus implies divergent evolution. For example, many insects (such as dragonflies) possess two pairs of flying wings. In beetles, the first pair of wings has evolved <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>pair</b> of hard wing covers, while in Dipteran flies the second pair of wings has evolved into small halteres used for balance.|$|E

5|$|The Cat's Eye Nebula is {{structurally}} a {{very complex}} nebula, and the mechanism or mechanisms that {{have given rise to}} its complicated morphology are not well understood. The central bright part of the nebular consists of the inner elongated bubble (inner ellipse) filled with hot gas. It in turn is nested <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>pair</b> of larger spherical bubbles conjoined together along their waist. The waist is observed as the second larger ellipse lying perpendicular to the bubble with hot gas.|$|E
5|$|The {{thoracic}} segments {{have one}} ganglion on each side, which are connected <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>pair,</b> one pair per segment. This arrangement is also {{seen in the}} abdomen {{but only in the}} first eight segments. Many species of insects have reduced numbers of ganglia due to fusion or reduction. Some cockroaches have just six ganglia in the abdomen, whereas the wasp Vespa crabro has only two in the thorax and three in the abdomen. Some insects, like the house fly Musca domestica, have all the body ganglia fused into a single large thoracic ganglion.|$|E
5|$|At Main Street, Church Street splits <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>pair</b> of one-way {{streets and}} becomes North and South Division Street. The route follows South Division eastward for two blocks to an {{intersection}} with Ellicott Street located one block north of Coca-Cola Field. At the junction, {{which includes the}} northern terminus of NY16, NY5 turns northward, rejoining NY5 westbound one block later at North Division. The route continues on Ellicott for nine blocks to the unidirectional East Tupper Street, where NY5 westbound separates from the route once more. NY5 eastbound, however, continues north on Ellicott for an additional block to the one-way Goodell Street. NY5 heads west on Goodell for two blocks before turning north onto Main Street, rejoining NY5 westbound at the intersection.|$|E

2500|$|One {{way that}} the Higgs can decay is by {{splitting}} <b>into</b> <b>a</b> fermion–antifermion <b>pair.</b> <b>As</b> general rule, the Higgs {{is more likely to}} decay into heavy fermions than light fermions, because the mass of a fermion is proportional to the strength of its interaction with the Higgs. By this logic the most common decay should be <b>into</b> <b>a</b> top–antitop quark <b>pair.</b> However, such <b>a</b> decay would only be possible if the Higgs were heavier than ~, twice the mass of the top quark. For a Higgs mass of [...] the SM predicts that the most common decay is <b>into</b> <b>a</b> bottom–antibottom quark <b>pair,</b> which happens 57.7% of the time. The second most common fermion decay at that mass is <b>a</b> tau–antitau <b>pair,</b> which happens only about 6.3% of the time.|$|R

5|$|The abdomen is {{composed}} of five somites, all of which lack appendages except the last. The back-facing margins of these somites bear small spines and four or more larger spines. The last abdominal somite forks <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>pair</b> of flattened spatulate appendages (the uropods) that function as a tail fan (caudal rami). In addition to stabilising the body while swimming, a quick flick of the tail fan can rapidly propel the animal backwards, which may have functioned {{as a means of}} escaping predators like in modern shrimp. Traces of four fused segments are evident in the three faint lines dividing each lobe of the tail fan. A long telson is present {{at the end of the}} body. Traces of a rounded stomach, small digestive glands, and an intestine that terminates into a tiny anal opening on the telson can also be observed in some specimens.|$|E
5|$|The {{main event}} {{was for the}} TNA World Heavyweight Championship, in which then-champion Samoa Joe defended the title against the {{challenger}} Booker T. Joe's forehead was cut open during the match after being thrown <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>pair</b> of steel ring steps. Booker T also had his forehead cut open during the contest. Several referees were knocked out by Joe in the storyline throughout the encounter, {{to the point that}} security was sent down to the ring to restrain Joe. Booker T's legitimate wife Sharmell then interfered in the bout, attempting to get someone to stop Joe as he applied his signature Coquina Clutch submission hold on Booker T. Sting then entered the arena and went to the ring to calm down Joe, who listened at first, before giving Sting the finger and continuing his assault on Booker T. Sting retaliated by bashing Joe in the gut and over the back with a baseball bat. Booker T then covered Joe, while Sharmell counted the pinfall before the two left the arena with the title belt, leaving the outcome a mystery before being ruled a no-contest at 15 minutes and 14 seconds.|$|E
5|$|The stable group 11 elements, copper, silver, and gold, {{all have}} an outer {{electron}} configuration nd10(n+1)s1. For {{each of these}} elements, the first excited state of their atoms has a configuration nd9(n+1)s2. Due to spin-orbit coupling between the d electrons, this state is split <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>pair</b> of energy levels. For copper, the difference in energy between the ground state and lowest excited state causes the metal to appear reddish. For silver, the energy gap widens and it becomes silvery. However, as the atomic number increases, the excited levels are stabilized by relativistic effects and in gold the energy gap decreases again and it appears gold. For roentgenium, calculations indicate that the 6d97s2 level is stabilized {{to such an extent}} that it becomes the ground state and the 6d107s1 level becomes the first excited state. The resulting energy difference between the new ground state and the first excited state is similar to that of silver and roentgenium is expected to be silvery in appearance. The atomic radius of roentgenium is expected to be around 138pm.|$|E
40|$|We {{study the}} {{evolution}} of rotational response of a statistical mechanical model of two-component superfluid with a nondissipative drag interaction as the system undergoes <b>a</b> transition <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>paired</b> superfluid phase at finite temperature. The transition manifests itself in a change of (i) vortex-lattice symmetry and (ii) nature of the vortex state. Instead of a vortex lattice, the system forms a highly disordered tangle which constantly undergoes merger and reconnecting processes involving different types of vortices with a “hidden” breakdown of translation symmetry...|$|R

40|$|When {{a single}} photon is split by a beam splitter, its two `halves' can {{entangle}} two distant atoms <b>into</b> <b>an</b> EPR <b>pair.</b> We discuss <b>a</b> time-reversed analogue of this experiment where two distant sources cooperate {{so as to}} emit a single photon. The two `half photons,' having interacted with two atoms, can entangle these atoms <b>into</b> <b>an</b> EPR <b>pair</b> once they are detected as a single photon. Entanglement occurs by creating indistinguishabilility between the two mutually exclusive histories of the photon. This indistinguishabilility can be created either {{at the end of}} the two histories (by `erasing' the single photon's path) or at their beginning (by `erasing' the two atoms' positions) ...|$|R

25|$|At this time, John Willmore, a {{carpenter}} and joiner, constructed {{a house and}} workshop for himself. By 1809, the undeveloped remainder of the plot consisted of two nailer's workshops and a cooper's workshop with a knacker's yard behind. The Hurst Street frontage was filled with sheds. By 1821, No. 50 Inge Street/ 1 Court 15 had been converted <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>pair</b> of back to backs. No. 52 Inge Street/ 2 Court 15 and No. 54 Inge Street/3 Court 15 were built about 1830.

The lower jaw was connected with the upper jaw in a way that made the tusk whorl thrust out as a dagger when the head was raised. The upper jaw, containing 30 teeth which decrease in size posteriorly, is well preserved in many individuals. Juveniles have six tusks, while adults have three.|$|E

25|$|In early 1961, the Cross-Westchester Expressway (I-287) {{was opened}} to traffic, {{utilizing}} the Westchester Avenue corridor from White Plains to {{just west of}} Port Chester. Westchester Avenue itself was split into two one-way highways located {{on both sides of}} the new freeway, essentially converting Westchester Avenue <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>pair</b> of service roads. NY119 was moved onto both directions of the reconfigured Westchester Avenue and truncated to end at Purchase Street (NY120) following the opening of the expressway. It was cut back to the junction of I-287 and NY127 by the following year and to its current eastern terminus in White Plains in the 1970s.|$|E

The Metro line enters a tunnel in the East Potomac Park, and the main line railroad from the Long Bridge passes over I-395 and runs over the Washington Channel just downstream of the 14th Street approach before turning northeast along the line of Maryland Avenue. The original bridge ran to the junction of 14th Street and Maryland Avenue, with access to either for cars.|$|E
25|$|In April 2012, the {{university}} submitted a revised {{plan for the}} arts and transit center, calling for the extension of the station's freight house onto the right-of-way for possible use as a restaurant. The Regional Planning Board introduced an ordinance requiring the land be preserved for a transportation right-of-way that could eventually extend farther into the central business district at Nassau Street. According to {{the university}}, ownership of the trackage would have to change hands in order for the extended transitway to be implemented. Approvals were subsequently issued for converting the station house and the expanded freight house <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>pair</b> of restaurants, preserving two original ticket windows for kitchen views, and using the wooden arrival/departure boards as overhead menus.|$|E
