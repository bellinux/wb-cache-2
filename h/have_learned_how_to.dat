As she grew older, she would have helped other members of Powhatan's household with preparations for large feasts.

500|$|A 1985 Rolling Stone {{feature on}} the Minneapolis scene and {{innovative}} California hardcore acts such as Black Flag and Minutemen declared, [...] "Primal punk is passé.

[...] By the mid-to-late 1980s, these bands, who had largely eclipsed their punk rock and post-punk forebears in popularity, were classified broadly as alternative rock. Alternative rock encompasses a diverse set of styles—including gothic rock, dream pop, shoegaze, and grunge, among others—unified by their debt to punk rock and their origins outside of the musical mainstream.|$|E

[...] The band members all had jobs and some were going to school during the recording of the album, so each member came in for short periods as they had time available. Stroetzel said this was helpful, as it reduced stress, but regretted {{that they were not}} able to get more done in one session. A problem that D'Antonio, Dutkiewicz, and Stroetzel encountered was keeping their guitars in tune during the sessions. They spent a large amount of the recording budget buying new guitars to improve the tuning.

GameSpy numbers her demise as the 10th greatest cinematic moments in video game history, while its readers voted it the second most cinematic moment. GamePro considers her death sequence to be the greatest of all gaming moments. Tom's Games called the scene [...] "one of the most powerful and memorable scenes of the Final Fantasy series—or any other game, for that matter." [...] Edge called her death the [...] "dramatic highpoint" [...] of Final Fantasy VII, and suggested that reintroducing her through the Compilation of Final Fantasy VII titles [...] "arguably undermines this great moment." [...] In 2005, Electronic Gaming Monthly listed Final Fantasy VII number six in their list of ten most important games, stating that without this game, [...] "Aeris wouldn't have died, and gamers wouldn't <b>have</b> <b>learned</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> cry."

Second is that everyone thereby devotes their entire time to nothing else but prayers and supplications.

2500|$|Babel wrote: [...] "Only by 1923 I <b>have</b> <b>learned</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> {{express my}} {{thoughts}} {{in a clear}} and not very lengthy way. Then I returned to writing." [...] Several stories that were later included in Red Cavalry were published in Vladimir Mayakovsky's LEF ("ЛЕФ") magazine in 1924. Babel's honest description of the brutal realities of war, far from revolutionary propaganda, earned him some powerful enemies. According to recent research, Marshal Budyonny was infuriated by Babel's unvarnished descriptions of marauding Red Cossacks and demanded Babel's execution without success. However, Gorky's influence not only protected Babel but also helped to guarantee publication. In 1929 Red Cavalry was translated into English by J.

2500|$|In the 1960s, Orbison {{refused to}} splice edits of songs together, and insisted in {{recording}} them in single takes {{with all the}} instruments and singers together. The only convention Orbison followed in his most popular songs is the time limit for radio fare in pop songs. Otherwise, each seems to follow a separate structure. Using the standard thirty-two-bar form for verses and choruses, normal pop songs followed the verse-chorus-verse-chorus-bridge-verse-chorus structure. Where A represents the verse, B represents the chorus, and C the bridge, most pop songs can be represented by A-B-A-B-C-A-B, like [...] "Ooby Dooby" [...] and [...] "Claudette". Orbison's [...] "In Dreams" [...] was a song in seven movements that can be represented as Intro-A-B-C-D-E-F; no sections are repeated. In [...] "Running Scared", however, the entire song repeats to build suspense to a final climax, to be represented as A-A-A-A-B. [...] "Crying" [...] is more complex, changing parts toward the end to be represented as A-B-C-D-E-F-A-B'-C'-D'-E'-F'.
