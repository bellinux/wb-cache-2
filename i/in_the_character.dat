5|$|The {{first issue}} of Cine Colombiano {{contained}} several images from La tragedia del silencio that could be allegories of Jesus, the Muisca myth of Bochica, or the Colombian civil wars. The film has a religious aspect <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>character</b> of Father Alberto, who refers directly to Colombian Father Rafael Almansa.|$|E
5|$|Analysts see <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>character</b> of Lady Macbeth the {{conflict}} between femininity and masculinity as they are impressed in cultural norms. Lady Macbeth suppresses her instincts toward compassion, motherhood, and fragility — associated with femininity — in favour of ambition, ruthlessness, and the singleminded pursuit of power. This conflict colours the entire drama and sheds light on gender-based preconceptions from Shakespearean England to the present.|$|E
5|$|During the 1980s, a Thrud {{comic strip}} {{was a regular}} and popular feature in the roleplay and wargame {{magazine}} White Dwarf with Thrud's grotesque and comic antics forming a memorable part of the magazine's golden age. In 2002, continued interest <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>character</b> from role-playing enthusiasts {{and a desire to}} be free to experiment with a new artistic style prompted Critchlow to self-publish a series of award-winning full-length Thrud the Barbarian comics.|$|E

5|$|In {{the decades}} since its release, modern film {{scholars}} {{have noted the}} possible homosexual reading of the film. Director James Whale was openly gay, {{and some of the}} actors in the cast, including Ernest Thesiger and Colin Clive, were believed to be gay or bisexual. Although James Curtis, Whale's biographer, rejects the notion that Whale would have identified with the Monster from a homosexual perspective, scholars have perceived a gay subtext suffused through the film, especially a camp sensibility, particularly embodied <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>character</b> of Pretorius and his relationship with Henry.|$|E
5|$|Linda Larkin as Princess Jasmine: The {{princess of}} Agrabah, who {{is tired of}} life in the royal palace. Larkin was chosen nine months after her audition, and had to adjust (or lower) her high-pitched voice to reach the voice the filmmakers were looking for <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>character.</b> Jasmine's supervising {{animator}} was Mark Henn. Lea Salonga provides Jasmine's singing voice.|$|E
5|$|Mahesh {{received}} the film's script while dubbing for Dookudu (2011), {{but due to}} that commitment took ten days to finish reading the script. He {{said in an interview}} that he could maintain the consistency <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>character</b> only because of the fewer working days. Jagannadh did not cast Brahmanandam and Ali because of Mahesh's specific characterisation; he added that Mahesh's voice had changed when compared to his performance in Pokiri. Mahesh also convinced Jagannadh to give up smoking, since he himself was trying to give up after being a chain smoker.|$|E

5|$|Pope Paul III and His Grandsons {{ranks as}} one of Titian's finest and most {{penetrating}} works. Although unfinished and less technically accomplished than his Portrait of Pope Paul III of a few years earlier, it is renowned for its rich colouring; the deep reds of the tablecloth and the almost spectral whites of Paul's gown. The panel contains subtle indications of the contradictions <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>character</b> of the Pope, and captures the complex psychological dynamic between the three men.|$|E
5|$|The rise of {{successful}} freedmen—through either political influence in imperial service, or wealth—is {{a characteristic of}} early Imperial society. The prosperity of a high-achieving group of freedmen is attested by , and by their ownership {{of some of the}} most lavish houses at Pompeii, such as the House of the Vettii. The excesses of nouveau riche freedmen were satirized <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>character</b> of Trimalchio in the Satyricon by Petronius, who wrote in the time of Nero. Such individuals, while exceptional, are indicative of the upward social mobility possible in the Empire.|$|E
5|$|With {{knowledge}} of his sexuality becoming more common beginning in the 1970s, some film historians and gay studies scholars have detected homosexual themes in Whale's work, particularly in Bride of Frankenstein in which {{a number of the}} creative people associated with the cast, including Ernest Thesiger and Colin Clive, were alleged to be gay or bisexual. Scholars have identified a gay sensibility suffused through the film, especially a camp sensibility, particularly embodied <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>character</b> of Pretorius (Thesiger) and his relationship with Henry Frankenstein (Clive).|$|E

5|$|Author Hiromu Arakawa {{integrated}} several {{social problems}} into the plot, {{such as the}} way Edward and Alphonse live as brothers {{after the death of}} their mother, Trisha. She also looks at how the brothers help {{people all over the country}} to gain an understanding of the meaning of family. When describing the character's personality, Arakawa comments that after his father's departure from home and his mother's death, Edward tried to replace the role of the man for the Elric family. As a result, Van Hohenheim's reappearance caused a shocking and terrified reaction <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>character.</b> Arakawa has noted that Edward is one of her favorite characters from the series, although she denied having the same personality as him when one of her assistants mentioned it.|$|E
5|$|Gay {{characters}} {{also were}} often killed {{off at the}} end, such as the death of Sandy Dennis' character {{at the end of}} The Fox in 1968. If not victims, lesbians were depicted as villains or morally corrupt, such as portrayals of brothel madames by Barbara Stanwyck in Walk on the Wild Side from 1962 and Shelley Winters in The Balcony in 1963. Lesbians as predators were presented in Rebecca (1940), women's prison films like Caged (1950), or <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>character</b> Rosa Klebb in From Russia with Love (1963). Lesbian vampire themes have reappeared in Dracula's Daughter (1936), Blood and Roses (1960), Vampyros Lesbos (1971), and The Hunger (1983). Basic Instinct (1992) featured a bisexual murderer played by Sharon Stone; it was one of several films that set off a storm of protests about the depiction of gays as predators.|$|E
5|$|In early 1594, the Serbs in Banat rose {{up against}} the Ottomans. The rebels had, <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>character</b> of a holy war, carried war flags with the icon of Saint Sava. The war banners were consecrated by Patriarch Jovan Kantul, and the {{uprising}} was aided by Serbian Orthodox metropolitans Rufim Njeguš of Cetinje and Visarion of Trebinje (s. 1590–1602). In response, Ottoman Grand Vizier Koca Sinan Pasha demanded that the green flag of the Prophet Muhammed be brought from Damascus to counter the Serb flag and ordered that the sarcophagus containing the relics of Saint Sava {{be removed from the}} Mileševa monastery and transferred to Belgrade via military convoy. Along the way, the Ottoman convoy killed all the people in its path as a warning to the rebels. The Ottomans publicly incinerated the relics of Saint Sava on a pyre atop the Vračar plateau on April 27, 1595, and had the ashes scattered.|$|E

5|$|Montalbán said in promotional {{interviews}} {{for the film}} he realized early on in his career that a good villain does not see himself as villainous. The villain may do villainous things, but he feels that he is doing them for righteous reasons. Montalbán further stated he always {{tried to find a}} flaw <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>character,</b> as no one is completely good or completely evil; while Khan had a rather distorted view of reality and therefore performed acts of evil, he still felt that his vengeance was a noble cause because of the death of his wife. Khan quotes the character of Ahab from Moby-Dick throughout the film, driving home his lust to make Kirk pay for the wrongs he has inflicted upon him.|$|E
5|$|Much {{commentary}} {{has focused}} on the novel's depiction of njais, a subject common in contemporary Chinese Malay literature. Sumardjo describes the novel as an ode to njais, citing Marsiti's loyalty to Aij Tjeng and her pureness of purpose; Marsiti is ultimately recognised for her devotion when her grave in Cikembang is moved to Batavia, with empty spaces on either side for Aij Tjeng and Gwat Nio. Sumardjo finds subtle criticism of the Dutch and Chinese men who kept njais, showing the women as often becoming victims of their lovers. He suggests that this was manifested <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>character</b> of Keng Djim's unnamed njai (Marsiti's mother), who is banished after rumours spread that she has been unfaithful. Sutedja-Liem likewise emphasises the role of the njai within the story, considering the novel to be an ode to the love and loyalty of the concubines.|$|E
5|$|Players {{and game}} journalists {{consider}} the game among the Spectrum's best. Sabre Wulf {{was the first}} of four titles in the Sabreman series for the ZX Spectrum. Retro Gamer credited the character's name and character traits for its lasting memorability. As an ordinary human with a hat and exaggerated nose, Sabreman fit the video game 8-bit era's character archetype. The last, unreleased game in the Spectrum Sabreman series, Mire Mare, was planned to have been similar to Sabre Wulf in gameplay. Rare, the successor to Ultimate, later released a side-scrolling platformer in 2004 for the Game Boy Advance handheld console—also titled Sabre Wulf—in which Sabreman enlists jungle animals to solve the Sabre Wulf's puzzles. It was not received well by fans. Elements from the original Sabre Wulf appear in other games, including Rare's Jet Force Gemini. Retro Gamer considered Sabreman's recurring appearance to be proof of Rare's interest <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>character</b> and series.|$|E

5|$|The Michiganensian {{described}} the defeat as follows:"There had been {{every reason to}} expect a victory from Chicago. Michigan had played strong and consistent foot ball throughout her schedule – Chicago had been erratic and unsteady. But there is certainly no sport more full of surprises than foot-ball, and the Thanksgiving Day contest of '96 furnished as sensational a surprise in as exciting a contest as had ever come off on a western gridiron. There was one great difference <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>character</b> of the play of the two teams. Michigan was playing her stock game of football, hard and steady, the game {{she could have been}} depended on to play at any time. Chicago seemed to have been trained and nerved to this one game. There could have been little doubt what the result of a series of contests would have been. But this one game, Chicago won by good generalship, by the most advantageous use of her greatest resource – a magnificent player in a telling place.|$|E
5|$|Wollstonecraft's ideas became {{associated}} {{with her life}} story and women writers {{felt that it was}} dangerous to mention her in their texts. Hays, who had previously been a close friend and an outspoken advocate for Wollstonecraft and her Rights of Woman, for example, did not include her in the collection of Illustrious and Celebrated Women she published in 1803. Maria Edgeworth specifically distances herself from Wollstonecraft in her novel Belinda (1802); she caricatures Wollstonecraft as a radical feminist <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>character</b> of Harriet Freke. But, like Jane Austen, she does not reject Wollstonecraft's ideas. Both Edgeworth and Austen argue that women are crucial {{to the development of the}} nation; moreover, they portray women as rational beings who should choose companionate marriage.|$|E
5|$|Kyo {{has been}} well-received by gamers, with his {{character}} appearing in several popularity polls. In Gamest's 1997 Heroes Collection, Kyo was voted as the staff's second favorite character, behind his rival Iori. In a 2005 poll made by SNK-Playmore USA, he was voted the sixth fan favorite character {{with a total}} of 176 votes. Additionally, in the January 30, 1995 issue of Gamest magazine in Japan, Kyo was featured at No. 4 in the Top 50 Characters of 1994. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>character</b> popularity poll on Neo Geo Freak's website, he was voted as the third favorite character {{with a total of}} 2,574 votes. For the special endings in The King of Fighters '97, three video games journals, Gamest, Famitsu and Neo Geo Freak, had to create a team composed of three characters from the game so that they would be featured in an image after passing the arcade mode. The Neo Geo Freaks team created a team composed of Kyo, Mai Shiranui and Billy Kane. The special ending only appears in Japanese versions of the game. In an ASCII Media Works poll in which fans voted on whose video game or manga character they would like to name their children after, Kyo's name was tenth in the male category. Merchandising based on Kyo's appearance has also been released. Yutaka released an articulated action figure and a puzzle of Kyo from KoF '97. With the release of new video games in the series, SNK developed new action figures as well as key-chains.|$|E
