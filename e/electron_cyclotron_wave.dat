40|$|We {{show that}} an {{energetic}} electron distribution {{which has a}} temperature anisotropy (T perpendicular to b is greater than T parallel to b), or which is gyrating about a DC magnetic field, can generate <b>electron</b> <b>cyclotron</b> <b>waves</b> with frequencies below the <b>electron</b> <b>cyclotron</b> frequency. Relativistic effects are included in solving the dispersion equation and are shown to be quantitatively important. The basic idea of the mechanism is the coupling of the beam mode to slow <b>waves.</b> The unstable <b>electron</b> <b>cyclotron</b> <b>waves</b> are predominantly electromagnetic and right-hand polarized. For a low-density plasma in which the electron plasma frequency {{is less than the}} <b>electron</b> <b>cyclotron</b> frequency, the excited waves can have frequencies above or below the electron plasma frequency, depending upon the parameters of the energetic electron distribution. This instability may account for observed Z mode waves in the polar magnetosphere of the Earth and other planets...|$|R

40|$|In low density plasmas in the RTP tokamak the {{single-pass}} {{absorption of}} O-mode waves at the fundamental <b>electron</b> <b>cyclotron</b> resonance is observed to be toroidally asymmetric. The absorption is highest for waves travelling {{in the direction}} opposite to the toroidal plasma current. Fokker-Planck quasi-linear code simulations show that this asymmetry {{is most likely to}} be due to a synergism between the <b>electron</b> <b>cyclotron</b> <b>waves</b> and the DC toroidal electric field. The <b>electron</b> <b>cyclotron</b> <b>waves</b> create a population of suprathermal electrons, which is localized in the region of <b>electron</b> <b>cyclotron</b> power deposition. This population is accelerated by the toroidal electric field. The ensuing asymmetry in the electron distribution function is then responsible for the asymmetry in the wave absorption. On the basis of this interpretation, a heuristic scaling of the asymmetry is derived, which is confirmed by simulations. The scaling of the experimental results with the plasma density lends further support to the proposed interpretation...|$|R
40|$|The {{scattering}} of <b>electron</b> <b>cyclotron</b> <b>waves</b> by density blobs {{embedded in the}} edge region of a fusion plasma is studied using a full-wave model. The full-wave theory is a generalization of the usual approach of geometric optics ray scattering by blobs. While the latter allows for only refraction of waves, the former, more general formulation, includes refraction, reflection, and diffraction of waves. Furthermore, the geometric optics, ray tracing, model is limited to blob densities that are slightly different from the background plasma density. Observations in tokamak experiments show that the fluctuating density differs from the background plasma density by 20 % or more. Thus, the geometric optics model is not a physically realistic model of {{scattering of}} <b>electron</b> <b>cyclotron</b> <b>waves</b> by plasma blobs. The differences between the ray tracing approach and the full-wave approach to scattering are illustrated in this paper...|$|R

40|$|Due to spatial {{localization}} of <b>electron</b> <b>cyclotron</b> <b>wave</b> injection in DIII-D, electrons heated in an off-axis region must toroidally transit the tokamak 25 [...] 50 {{times before}} re-entering the heating region. This distance {{is of the}} order of the mean free path. The effect of such RF localization is simulated with a time-dependent Fokker-Planck code which is 2 D-in-velocity, 1 D-in-space-along-B, and periodic in space. An effective parallel electric field arises to maintain continuity of the driven current. Somewhat surprisingly, the localized current drive efficiency remains equal to that for a uniform medium...|$|E

40|$|Auroral kilometric {{radiation}} (AKR) is a high-density {{radio wave}} radiation {{in the frequency}} band from 50 to 750 kHz, with a peak around 250 kHz, that has been observed emanating from the auroral zone.

The AKR is closely correlated with the occurrence of discrete auroral arcs, which are believed to be generated by intense inverted V electron precipitation bands. A review is presented of several theories which have been proposed to explain the observed AKR.

40|$|For {{the upper}} <b>electron</b> <b>cyclotron</b> <b>wave</b> {{launcher}} {{on the international}} thermonuclear experimental reactor (ITER), {{the use of a}} 'remote steering antenna' based on the imaging properties of square waveguides is planned. To characterize launchers of this type, low-power experiments on a four-side corrugated square waveguide, with a scanning mirror at the input of the waveguide, were performed in the frequency range 140 â 160 GHz. It is shown that elliptical polarization, which is necessary for the electron cyclotron current drive (ECCD), can be transmitted without depolarization and that the usable steering range of the antenna is at least 20 Â°. Low-power measurements demonstrate that mitre bends can be integrated into the waveguide, practically without extra loss. Detailed calorimetric measurements for this set-up confirm this statement for the polarization perpendicular to the scanning plane, whereas excess loss is measured for the parallel polarization. Various modifications of mitre bends are investigated and results are discussed...|$|E
