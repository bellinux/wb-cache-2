One of the effective factors in threshing losses and waste of threshing units, threshers and harvesting machines, is the drum speed. In this research, effects of three factors including drum speed (five levels), crop moisture content (two levels) and rice common varieties (four varieties) on threshing losses and waste were studied. The thresher T 25 {{was used for the}} investigation. It has wire loop type tooth. Dependent factors included unthreshed grains percentage (threshing losses) and <b>damaged</b> <b>grains</b> percentage. The obtained data was analyzed by split–split plot test based on Complete Randomized Blocks Design. The mean values were compared using Duncan’s Multiple Range Test. The tests results revealed that significant effect of variety type and drum linear speed on threshing losses (P&lt; 0. 01). Furthermore, the effects of variety type, moisture content and drum speed on <b>damaged</b> <b>grains</b> were also significant. The optimum drum speed was 14 m/s. The most and the least of threshing losses belong to Hashemy and Binam varieties, respectively.

Approach: In this study, the &# 13; effective factors effects on threshing loss, damaged grain percent and Material &# 13; Other than Grain (MOG) to grain ratio, were investigated on a head feed threshing &# 13; unit. Independent variables were included speed drum in five levels, variety in &# 13; two levels and moisture content of crop in two levels.

One portion of the grains was used to obtain desorption isotherms, while the other was subjected to drying until the moisture content of 5. 26 % (d. b.), so that it was subjected to the adsorption. For the induction of damage, a Stein Breakage Tester was used. To obtain the equilibrium moisture content, grains were placed in a climatic chamber at 20, 30, 40 and 50 ± 1 °C combined with relative humidity of 30, 40, 50, 70 and 90 ± 3 %.

A large cause of <b>grain</b> <b>damage</b> is mechanical damage incurred during the threshing process in a combine. This process of stripping the grain from the plant can often cause cracks and other damage. Many researches have attempted to find methods to minimize <b>grain</b> <b>damage</b> without inhibiting harvest productivity. Many harvest factors can effect the amount of <b>damage</b> that <b>grain</b> will incur during harvest. Some of these are uncontrollable by the operator such as moisture content. However, many of {{the parameters of the}} combine can be varied in an attempt to reduce <b>grain</b> <b>damage</b> and obtain better yields.

[...] In addition, <b>grain</b> <b>damage</b> can actually increase as the forward speed, or ground speed, of the machine is decreased. [...] Similar ground speed trends were found in wheat.

40|$|It is {{experimentally}} {{observed that}} PNN-PT ceramics processed with glycerol possess superior unipolar fatigue resistance; {{but the same}} ceramics processed without glycerol are vulnerable to unipolar fatigue. For PNN-PT-glycerol fatigued by 5 x 107 unipolar cycles, there are no losses in the maximum polarization (P-max) and remnant polarization (P-r). But for PNN-PT, these losses are similar to 14 % and 22 %, respectively. In addition, strain asymmetry gamma(S) and internal bias field E-bias of PNN-PT-glycerol are much less than those of PNN-PT. However, the ferroelectric properties can be recovered by bipolar cycles and thermal annealing; and such recovery is much easier and larger in PNN-PT-glycerol than in PNN-PT ceramics.

40|$|The {{ultrastructure}} of Typha latifolia pollen {{was examined}} {{as a function}} of pollen moisture content and incubation temperature, in order to identify possible lesions induced by imbibitional chilling. A syndrome of structural traits was found which characterizes <b>damaged</b> <b>grains.</b> Compared to viable grains, the protoplast of damaged pollen has a higher proportion of its volume occupied by vesicles, and less volume occupied by cytoplasm. <b>Damaged</b> <b>grains</b> also tend to have dilated cisternae of endoplasmic reticulum, larger starch grains and lipid bodies, poorly preserved mitochondria and membranes, and, sometimes, numerous electron-dense globules associated with membranes. The percentage of grains exhibiting this damage syndrome correlates closely with the number of ungerminated grains in most samples, regardless of moisture content or incubation temperature. Injury due to rapid imbibition from the dry state or to imbibitional chilling appear to be similar structurally, regardless of whether the stresses are imposed singly or together. The injury is not confined to one cell component (e. g., mitochondria), but may involve a generalized disruption of membranes.
