In 1896 they created a company called <b>Industrial</b> <b>Contract</b> Corporation (Limited) with directors James Jackson (Chairman), Newton, Bailey and Burbidge. Mendel and André maintained control of the business by retaining founders' shares that gave them powers to override directors and shareholders. This new business became involved with the purchase and sale of a store in Clapham, London called Grice and Son. The purchase price was about £17,000 and the sale price £48,000. It transpired that the directors selling the business and those buying were the same individuals, {{but this was not}} declared on the prospectus nor was the profit they made from the deal. A dispute with the shareholder led to the prospects of a winding-up procedure in public court. This was avoided with a compromise agreed between the parties but Alfred Newton, who had just been elected Lord Mayor of London, asked for the case be re-opened so that the whole matter could be given a public hearing. [...] During the case, evidence was given that Mendel had written to several of the influential newspapers of the period, asking for favourable reviews of the flotation, and these letters were followed up with financial inducements.|$|R

40|$|The industrially {{oriented}} R&D {{infrastructure in}} a merging Germany and Europe {{needs to be}} re-shaped structurally {{and in terms of}} its capacity. In East Germany this infrastructure nearly completely lost its clients during the radical economic transformation process; during the early 1990 s it was completely re-structured and partly dissolved. The sharp downswing in the world economy, which in 1992 also hit West German industry, lead also to a reduced capacity utilization of the West German industrially oriented research. A diminishing demand is confronted today by a relatively large supplier potential for industrially oriented research from all Germany, despite the reduction in East Germany, for which <b>industrial</b> <b>contracts</b> are missing. In addition, there is a structural problem: both research systems have similar strengths and weaknesses; predatory competition is taking place today, whereby the East German suppliers have much worse starting conditions...|$|E

40|$|The Large Hadron Collider (LHC) {{currently}} under construction at CERN will {{make use of}} superconducting magnets operating in superfluid helium below 2 K. The cryogenic distribution scheme {{for each of the}} eight sectors, individually served by a refrigeration plant, is based on a separate Cryogenic Distribution Line (QRL) feeding helium at different temperatures and pressures to the elementary cooling loops. The QRL comprises two supply headers and three return headers including a sub-atmospheric one. Low heat inleak to all temperature levels is essential for the overall LHC cryogenic performance. With an overall length of 25. 6 km the QRL has a very critical cost-to-performance ratio. Therefore, following an in-house feasibility study, CERN adjudicated in autumn 1998 three <b>industrial</b> <b>contracts</b> in parallel for the supply of Pre-Series Test Cells (~ 112 m) of the QRL, which will be tested at CERN in 2000.
