40|$|High-speed {{photometric}} {{observations of}} the HZ Her/Her X- 1 system show that nonperiodic optical <b>flickering</b> is present during both the ON and OFF portions of the 35 -day cycle.

40|$|Effect {{of gravity}} level on the <b>flickering</b> motion was {{experimentally}} investigated for the propane and propane-hydrogen jet diffusion flames. A centrifuge {{was used for}} quantitative measurement of gravity effect, and frequency analysis was performed for the <b>flickering</b> flames. From the result of measurements under various gravity levels, it was clarified that the <b>flickering</b> frequency increased {{with an increase in}} the gravity level and it was correlated with two relationships expressed by the Strouhal number and the Froude number. One relationship was St∝Fr^ for high Froude numbers (Fr≥ 100), and the other was St∝Fr^ for low Froude numbers (Fr≤ 100). It meant that the Froude number gave the criterion of the <b>flickering</b> behavior and that <b>flickering</b> frequencies expressed by these two equations were affected by buoyancy in different ways. From the frequency analysis, it was found that oscillations of a <b>flickering</b> flame and a thermal convection around the flame were linked, but the characteristic of each <b>flickering</b> motion was different in the stability of periodicity...|$|R
5|$|Another {{feature of}} the ball is its rubber layer; it was {{designed}} to allow a better response while retaining the impact energy and releases it in the coup. Its support material of cross-linked nitrogen-expanded foam improves its retention and durability of its shape. Polyester support fabric enhances structure and stability. The asymmetrical high-contrast graphic around the ball creates an optimal <b>flicker</b> as the ball rotates for a more powerful visual signal, allowing the player to more easily identify and track the ball.|$|E

5|$|Reviewers {{complained of}} the game's high price, which was {{nearly double the}} average. Crash {{wondered}} if the cost might lead to more piracy. Critics also noted a bug in two-player mode, repeat screens from elsewhere in the maze, and the frustratingly narrow window in which sabre swings register as enemy hits.

40|$|Electromagnetic ion {{cyclotron}} (EMIC) waves, one of {{the possible}} origins of <b>flickering</b> aurora, have been thought to modulate the electron flux at a few thousand kilometers. In fact, <b>flickering</b> aurora with a frequency range of 3 – 15 Hz has often been identified by ground-based optical observations and has been interpreted {{to be caused by}} O+-band EMIC waves. However, extant research to date has not identified possible signatures of H+-band EMIC waves due to technical limitations of ground-based high-speed imagers. The present study shows the first evidence that patchy <b>flickering</b> aurora could be modulated by H+-band EMIC waves, based on the data obtained from imaging observations at 160 frames per second. The sporadic appearance of the <b>flickering</b> aurora in the frequency range of 50 – 80 Hz coexisted with typical <b>flickering</b> auroras of approximately 10 Hz. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that <b>flickering</b> auroras are generated by multi-ion EMIC waves...|$|R
5|$|Their songs can be {{confused}} with the Kentucky warbler. The song patterns are similar, but is of a different quality, as the warbler's songs is described as richer, with more ringing and a hurried pace. Other bird species that have their songs described as akin to the wrens are the <b>flicker,</b> Baltimore oriole, gray catbird, and more specifically the peto, peto, peto calls of the tufted titmouse, and whistles of the northern cardinal. Occasionally, the wrens mimic other species, and in Pennsylvania it has led for it to be also known as the 'mocking wren'.|$|E
5|$|When {{movement}} is required, one {{strategy is to}} minimise the motion signal, for example by avoiding waving limbs about and by choosing patterns that do not cause <b>flicker</b> when seen by the prey from straight ahead. Cuttlefish may be doing this with their active camouflage by choosing to form stripes {{at right angles to}} their front-back axis, minimising motion signals that would be given by occluding and displaying the pattern as they swim.|$|E
5|$|After the Crimson Tide defense {{held the}} Aggies to a punt, McCarron threw his second {{touchdown}} pass {{of the afternoon}} on the drive that ensued {{early in the second}} quarter on a 44-yard flea <b>flicker</b> pass to DeAndrew White that tied the game 14–14. On the next drive, Cyrus Jones intercepted a Manziel pass in the end zone for a touchback and an Alabama possession. McCarron then threw his third touchdown pass on the game from 51yards to Kenny Bell and gave the Crimson Tide their first lead of the game, 21–14. Alabama then closed the first half with an 11-play, 93-yard drive capped with a four-yard T. J. Yeldon touchdown run for a 28–14 halftime lead.|$|E
40|$|In the probed-sinewave paradigm—used {{to study}} the {{dynamics}} of light adaptation—a small probe of light is superimposed on a sinusoidally <b>flickering</b> background. Detection threshold for the probe is measured at various times {{with respect to the}} <b>flickering</b> background. Here we present such stimuli using three methods: monoptic (the probe and the <b>flickering</b> background are presented to the same eye), dichoptic (the probe is presented to one eye and the <b>flickering</b> background is presented to the other eye), and binocular (the probe and the <b>flickering</b> background are both presented to both eyes). The results suggest that the processing associated with detecting the probe is primarily in the retina (or any place with monocular input). However, the results also suggest a slight amount of processing in the cortex (or any place with binocular input), particularly at the higher frequency of <b>flickering</b> background used here (9. 4 Hz vs. 1. 2 Hz). A simple schematic model with three ocular-dominance channels is consistent with the results...|$|R

5|$|Cunningham was {{promoted}} to acting squadron leader in September 1940, commanding B Flight. Within the month the unit received the heavily armed and powerful Bristol Beaufighter. After the commanding officer, Cunningham was the second man to fly it. The Beaufighter went through a teething stage in relation to its gun sight. The sight projected a ring of light with a spot at the centre onto a small sheet of glass {{directly in front of}} the pilots head. The spot in the centre provided the aiming point, and the ring, of variable diameter, helped him to judge the rage and amount of deflection needed to attack a target. The light's brilliance was adjustable by rheostat, but the control was ineffective. Rotating it a fraction could produce maximum brilliance or cause the spot to <b>flicker</b> out.|$|E
5|$|In July 1978, Lucas {{revealed}} that Radioland Murders {{was still in}} development, and that both Steve Martin and Cindy Williams were approached for the two leads. The script was being rewritten and the planned start date was early 1979. However, throughout the 1970s to early 1990s, Radioland Murders remained in development hell. Between this time, Lucas commissioned Theodore J. <b>Flicker</b> to perform a rewrite. In early 1993 Lucas told Universal that advances in computer-generated imagery from Industrial Light & Magic (owned by Lucasfilm), particularly in digital mattes, would help bring Radioland Murders in for a relatively low budget of about $10 million, which eventually rose to $15 million.|$|E
5|$|In New York City, a {{man with}} a camera follows a woman from an {{elevator}} through a corridor to another elevator, where all the people appear to be gray.

As the man reaches the basement, the cab crashes and its door spills open to reveal the woman's wrist, covered with blood. The man begins to snap photos. Later, in Washington, D.C., FBI Assistant Director Alvin Kersh (James Pickens, Jr.) assigns Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson), along with Agent Peyton Ritter from New York, to the case.

5|$|P. fimbriata {{does not}} stalk at all {{species of the}} ant-mimic jumping spider genus Myrmarachne, and uses cryptic {{stalking}} only about 20% of the time against other ant-mimicking salticids and against beetle-mimicking salticids. P. fimbriata also sometimes does not use cryptic stalking against females of the salticid subfamily Lyssomaninae. These females are unusually translucent, and the translucent cuticle makes the anterior-median eyes (front-and-center) show light and dark regions that <b>flicker</b> in and out when viewed head on. Lyssomanine males are not translucent and do not produce this flickering, and P. fimbriata uses cryptic stalking consistently against the males. This suggests that the flickering anterior-median eyes of lyssomanine females may reduce the ability of P. fimbriata to identify these females as jumping spiders.|$|E
40|$|We {{present an}} {{analysis}} of <b>flickering</b> (2 – 10 Hz) auroras observed with a state-of-the-art multispectral imaging system, Auroral Structure and Kinetics, located in Tromsø, Norway.

To the authors' knowledge this is the first detailed analysis of such “chirps” in <b>flickering</b> aurora or field-aligned bursts. We have found that the electron precipitation energy is strongly anticorrelated with the <b>flickering</b> frequency during all identified chirps. This result is consistent with the theory that <b>flickering</b> aurora is caused by the resonance interaction between electromagnetic ion cyclotron waves and precipitating electrons and that the wave parallel phase velocity is the primary factor determining the electron acceleration produced by this mechanism. Other current theories known to the authors cannot completely explain our observations. <br/...|$|R

40|$|In Giant Honey Bees, abdomen {{flipping}} {{happens in}} a variety of contexts. It can be either synchronous or cascaded, such as in the collective defense traits of shimmering and rearing-up, or it can happen as single-agent behavior. Abdomen flipping is also involved in <b>flickering</b> behavior, which occurs regularly under quiescent colony state displaying singular or collective traits, with stochastic, and (semi-) synchronized properties. It presumably acts via visual, mechanoceptive, and pheromonal pathways and its goals are still unknown. This study questions whether <b>flickering</b> is preliminary to shimmering which is subject of the fs (flickering-shimmering) -transition hypothesis?
