60|$|Whilst {{matching}} for {{the sake}} of experiment many of the most distinct breeds of pigeons, it frequently appeared to me that the birds, though faithful to their marriage vow, retained some desire after their own kind. Accordingly I asked Mr. Wicking, who has kept a larger stock of various breeds together than any man in England, whether he thought that they would prefer pairing with their own kind, supposing that there were males and females enough of each; and he without hesitation answered that he was convinced that this was the case. It has often been noticed that the dovecote pigeon seems to have an actual aversion towards the several <b>fancy</b> <b>breeds</b> (16/8. 'The Dovecote' by the Rev. E.S. Dixon page 155; Bechstein 'Naturgesch. Deutschlands' b. 4 1795 page 17.) yet all have certainly sprung from a common progenitor. The Rev. W.D. Fox informs me that his flocks of white and common Chinese geese kept distinct.|$|E

60|$|Male humming-birds (Figs. 48 and 49) almost vie {{with birds}} of paradise in their beauty, as every one will admit who has seen Mr. Gould's splendid volumes, or his rich collection. It is very {{remarkable}} in how many different ways these birds are ornamented. Almost every part of their plumage has been taken advantage of, and modified; and the modifications have been carried, as Mr. Gould shewed me, to a wonderful extreme in some species belonging to nearly every sub-group. Such cases are curiously like those which we see in our <b>fancy</b> <b>breeds,</b> reared by man {{for the sake of}} ornament; certain individuals originally varied in one character, and other individuals of the same species in other characters; and these have been seized on by man and much augmented--as shewn by the tail of the fantail- pigeon, the hood of the jacobin, the beak and wattle of the carrier, and so forth. The sole difference between these cases is that in the one, the result is due to man's selection, whilst in the other, as with humming- birds, {{birds of paradise}}, etc., it is due to the selection by the females of the more beautiful males.|$|E
6000|$|A {{very good}} example of {{comparatively}} recent divergence of character, in accordance with new conditions of life, is afforded by our red grouse. This bird, the Lagopus scoticus of naturalists, is entirely confined to the British Isles. It is, however, very closely allied to the willow grouse (Lagopus albus), a bird which ranges all over Europe, Northern Asia, and North America, but which, unlike our species, changes to white in winter. No difference in form or structure can be detected between the two birds, but as they differ so decidedly in colour--our species being usually rather darker in winter than in summer, while there are also slight differences in the call-note and in habits,--the two species are {{generally considered to be}} distinct. The differences, however, are so clearly adaptations to changed conditions that we can hardly doubt that, during {{the early part of the}} glacial period, when our islands were united to the continent, our grouse was identical with that of the rest of Europe. But when the cold passed away and our islands became permanently separated from the mainland, with a mild and equable climate and very little snow in winter, the change to white at that season became hurtful, rendering the birds more conspicuous instead of serving as a means of concealment. The colour was, therefore, gradually changed by the process of variation and natural selection; and as the birds obtained ample shelter among the heather which clothes so many of our moorlands, it became useful for them to assimilate with its brown and dusky stems and withered flowers rather than with the snow of the higher mountains. An interesting confirmation of this change having really occurred is afforded by the occasional occurrence in Scotland of birds with a considerable amount of white in the winter plumage. This is considered to be a case of reversion to the ancestral type, just as the slaty colours and banded wings of the wild rock-pigeon sometimes reappear in our <b>fancy</b> <b>breeds</b> of domestic pigeons.[38] ...|$|E
6000|$|With PIGEONS, breeders are unanimous, as {{previously}} stated, {{that it is}} absolutely indispensable, notwithstanding the trouble and expense thus caused, occasionally to cross their much-prized birds with individuals of another strain, but belonging, of course, to the same variety. It deserves notice that, when size {{is one of the}} desired characters, as with pouters (17/40. 'A Treatise on Fancy Pigeons' by J.M. Eaton page 56.) the evil effects of close interbreeding are much sooner perceived than when small birds, such as short- faced tumblers, are valued. The extreme delicacy of the high <b>fancy</b> <b>breeds,</b> such as these tumblers and improved English carriers, is remarkable; they are liable to many diseases, and often die in the egg or during the first moult; and their eggs have generally to be hatched under foster-mothers. Although these highly-prized birds have invariably been subjected to much close interbreeding, yet their extreme delicacy of constitution cannot perhaps be thus fully explained. Mr. Yarrell informed me that Sir J. Sebright continued closely interbreeding some owl-pigeons, until from their extreme sterility he as nearly as possible lost the whole family. Mr. Brent (17/41. 'The Pigeon Book' page 46.) tried to raise a breed of trumpeters, by crossing a common pigeon, and recrossing the daughter, granddaughter, great-granddaughter, and great-great-granddaughter, with the same male trumpeter, until he obtained a bird with 15/16 of trumpeter's blood; but then the experiment failed, for [...] "breeding so close stopped reproduction." [...] The experienced Neumeister (17/42. 'Das Ganze der Taubenzucht' 1837 s. 18.) also asserts that the offspring from dovecotes and various other breeds are [...] "generally very fertile and hardy birds:" [...] so again MM. Boitard and Corbie (17/43. 'Les Pigeons' 1824 page 35.), after forty-five years' experience, recommend persons to cross their breeds for amusement; for, if they fail to make interesting birds, they will succeed under an economical point of view, [...] "as it is found that mongrels are more fertile than pigeons of pure race." ...|$|E

60|$|But {{there is}} another {{objection}} to this theory arising from {{the very nature of}} the effects produced. In each generation the effects of use or disuse, or of effort, will certainly be very small, while of this small effect it is not maintained that the whole will be always inherited by the next generation. How small the effect is we have no means of determining, except in the case of disuse, which Mr. Darwin investigated carefully. He found that in twelve <b>fancy</b> <b>breeds</b> of pigeons, which are often kept in aviaries, or if free fly but little, the sternum had been reduced by about one-seventh or one-eighth of its entire length, and that of the scapula about one-ninth. In domestic ducks the weight of the wing-bones in proportion to that of the whole skeleton had decreased about one-tenth. In domestic rabbits the bones of the legs were found to have increased in weight in due proportion to the increased weight of the body, but those of the hind legs were rather less in proportion to those of the fore legs than in the wild animal, a difference which may be imputed to their being less used in rapid motion. The pigeons, therefore, afford the greatest amount of reduction by disuse--one-seventh of the length of the sternum. But the pigeon has certainly been domesticated four or five thousand years; and if the reduction of the wings by disuse has only been going on for the last thousand years, the amount of reduction in each generation would be absolutely imperceptible, and quite within the limits of the reduction due to the absence of selection, as already explained. But, as we have seen in Chapter III, the fortuitous variation of every part or organ usually amounts to one-tenth, and often to one-sixth of the average dimensions--that is, the fortuitous variation in one generation among a limited number of the individuals of a species is as great as the cumulative effects of disuse in a thousand generations! If we assume that the effects of use or of effort in the individual are equal to the effects of disuse, or even ten or a hundred times greater, they will even then not equal, in each generation, the amount of the fortuitous variations of the same part. If it be urged that the effects of use would modify all the individuals of a species, while the fortuitous variations to the amount named only apply to a portion of them, it may be replied, that that portion is sufficiently large to afford ample materials for selection, since it often equals the numbers that can annually survive; while the recurrence in each successive generation of a like amount of variation would render possible such a rapid adjustment to new conditions that the effects of use or disuse would be as nothing in comparison. It follows, that even admitting the modifying effects of the environment, and that such modifications are inherited, they would yet be entirely swamped by the greater effects of fortuitous variation, and the far more rapid cumulative results of the selection of such variations.|$|E

50|$|As {{the first}} breed of lop rabbit, the English Lop {{was one of}} the first <b>fancy</b> <b>breeds</b> of rabbit {{developed}} in England, in the 19th century for the purposes of exhibition as a response to rise of animal fancy and consequently the rabbit's emergence as a mainstream household pet during the Victorian era, marking a departure from the earlier role of domesticated rabbit breeding for meat, fur and wool production.

40|$|Understanding {{the complex}} origin of domesticated populations is of vital {{importance}} for understanding, preserving and exploiting breed genetic diversity. Here, {{we aim to}} assess Asian contributions to European traditional breeds and western commercial chickens for mitochondrial genetic diversity. To this end, a 365 -bp fragment of the chicken mtDNA D-loop region of 16 Dutch <b>fancy</b> <b>breeds</b> (113 individuals) was surveyed, comprising almost the entire breed diversity of The Netherlands. We also sequenced the same fragment for 160 commercial birds representing all important commercial types from multiple commercial companies that together represent more than 50 % of the worldwide commercial value. We identified 20 different haplotypes. The haplotypes clustered into five clades. The commonest clade (E-clade) supposedly originates from the Indian subcontinent. In addition, both in commercial chicken and Dutch <b>fancy</b> <b>breeds,</b> many haplotypes were found with a clear East Asian origin. However, the erratic occurrence of many different East Asian mitochondrial clades indicates {{that there were many}} independent instances where breeders used imported exotic chickens for enhancing local breeds. Nucleotide diversity and haplotype diversity analyses showed the influence of the introgression of East Asian chicken on genetic diversity. All populations that had haplotypes of multiple origin displayed high inferred diversity, as opposed to most populations that had only a single mitochondrial haplotype signature. Most <b>fancy</b> <b>breeds</b> were found to have a much lower within-population diversity compared to broilers and layers, although {{this is not the case}} for mitochondrial estimates in <b>fancy</b> <b>breeds</b> that have multiple origin haplotype...|$|E
40|$|Domestic {{chickens}} are {{domestic animals}} with tremendous economic value.

In Europe, seroprevalence studies in backyard and <b>fancy</b> <b>breed</b> poultry flocks are scarce and limited to a few pathogens, such as Mycoplasma gallisepticum (MG); others, such as Ornithobacterium rhinotracheale (ORT), are missing. A commercial ELISA for detection of antibodies against six selected pathogens was performed on 460 serum samples from chickens across Flanders. Anti-ORT antibodies were, by far, the most prevalent, with a prevalence of 95. 4 %. Infectious bronchitis virus, Mycoplasma synoviae, and avian metapneumovirus antibodies were found in 75. 6 %, 76. 3 %, and 63. 5 % of the animals, respectively.

40|$|Identifying {{signatures}} of selection can provide valuable insight about the genes or genomic regions that are {{or have been}} under selective pressure, {{which can lead to}} a better understanding of genotype-phenotype relationships. A common strategy for selection signature detection is to compare samples from several populations and search for genomic regions with outstanding genetic differentiation. Wright's fixation index, FST, is a useful index for evaluation of genetic differentiation between populations. The aim of this study was to detect selective signatures between different chicken groups based on SNP-wise FST calculation. A total of 96 individuals of three commercial layer breeds and 14 non-commercial <b>fancy</b> <b>breeds</b> were genotyped with three different 600 K SNP-chips. After filtering a total of 1 million SNPs were available for FST calculation. Averages of FST values were calculated for overlapping windows. Comparisons of these were then conducted between commercial egg layers and non-commercial <b>fancy</b> <b>breeds,</b> as well as between white egg layers and brown egg layers. Comparing non-commercial and commercial breeds resulted in the detection of 630 selective signatures, while 656 selective signatures were detected in the comparison between the commercial egg-layer breeds. Annotation of selection signature regions revealed various genes corresponding to productions traits, for which layer breeds were selected. Among them were NCOA 1, SREBF 2 and RALGAPA 1 associated with reproductive traits, broodiness and egg production. Furthermore, several of the detected genes were associated with growth and carcass traits, including POMC, PRKAB 2, SPP 1, IGF 2, CAPN 1, TGFb 2 and IGFBP 2. Our approach demonstrates that including different populations with a specific breeding history can provide a unique opportunity for a better understanding of farm animal selection...|$|E

The Padovana chicken is a historical <b>fancy</b> <b>breed</b> found in the Veneto region of Italy and produces meat that is typical to some local markets. The experiment reported here involved 60 chickens reared in an organic production system where housing was an indoor pen with access to a grass paddock. Experimental chicks were randomly selected from May 17 and 24, 2001 hatches and slaughtered at 150 and 180 days of age, respectively. Meat from 30 chickens (16 males and 14 females) from each slaughter age was stored for subsequent analysis of breast and thigh meat quality. Males were consistently heavier then females for live; without blood and feathers; eviscerated with head; neck, and legs; carcass; breast; and right thigh weight. There were no differences between males and females for chemical composition of the breast except for percentages of dry matter and ash (female> male). Generally, overall weights were greater at 180 then 150 days of age, whereas there was no difference between ages for breast chemical composition except for % protein (180 > 150). The breast and thigh had a low value of brightness and a distinctive blue meat color. The fatty acid profile of the breast consisted of a high percentage of polyunsaturated fatty acids. There were no differences between sexes for fatty acids, except for C 16 : 0, C 18 : 3 w 3 (female> male) and C 18 : 1 w 7 t, C 20 : 4 w 6 (male> female).
