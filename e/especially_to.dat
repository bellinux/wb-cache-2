A $62million proposal was presented in 2006, incorporating a museum and an underground carpark. Designed once again by Ashton Raggatt McDougall, the proposal was opposed by local residents and some council members, and ran into significant funding problems when the Federal Government decided not to provide funding.|$|E

5|$|Spain's {{worldwide}} {{military activities}} between the 14th and 17th centuries called for {{large numbers of}} horses, more than could be supplied by native Spanish mares.

5|$|After Ueshiba left Hokkaidō in 1919, he met and {{was profoundly}} {{influenced}} by Onisaburo Deguchi, the {{spiritual leader of}} the Ōmoto-kyō religion (a neo-Shinto movement) in Ayabe. One of the primary features of Ōmoto-kyō is its emphasis on the attainment of utopia during one's life. This was a great influence on Ueshiba's martial arts philosophy of extending love and compassion <b>especially</b> <b>to</b> {{those who seek to}} harm others. Aikido demonstrates this philosophy in its emphasis on mastering martial arts so that one may receive an attack and harmlessly redirect it. In an ideal resolution, not only is the receiver unharmed, but so is the attacker.|$|E
5|$|After the Third Partition of Poland (1795), many Poles {{believed}} that revolutionary France, whose public opinion was very {{sympathetic to the}} ideals of the Polish Constitution of 3 May 1791, would come to Poland's aid. France's enemies included Poland's partitioners, Prussia, Austria and Imperial Russia. Paris was the seat of two Polish organizations laying the claim to be the Polish government-in-exile, the Deputation (Deputacja) of Franciszek Ksawery Dmochowski and the Agency (Agencja) of Józef Wybicki. Many Polish soldiers, officers and volunteers therefore emigrated, <b>especially</b> <b>to</b> Italy and to France. Eventually, the Agency was successful in convincing the French government (the Directory) to organize a Polish military unit. As the French Constitution did not allow for the employment of foreign troops on French soil, the French decided to use the Poles to bolster their allies in Italy, the Cisalpine Republic.|$|E
5|$|After the {{northern}} circulation became the dominant center on October9, a deepening trough in the westerlies caused {{a decrease in}} synoptic pressures, resulting in Bess' forward motion greatly decreasing. Maintaining a west-northwesterly track, strong outflow developed, <b>especially</b> <b>to</b> the southwest of the circulation. The storm eventually intensified into a typhoon on October10 as it approached {{the northern}} Philippines. Due to the cyclone's proximity to the country, the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration also monitored the storm and assigned it with the local name Susang. Later that day, Bess made landfall in northern Luzon, roughly 95km (60mi) south of Escarpada Point, with winds estimated at 120km/h (75mph). Though classified a minimal typhoon by the JTWC, the Hong Kong Royal Observatory reported that reconnaissance planes had recorded surface winds of 140km/h (85mph) before the system moved ashore. Inland, a barometric pressure of 976.9mbar (hPa; 28.85inHg) was recorded in Tuguegarao as the typhoon passed 55km (35mi) to the north.|$|E
