5|$|The {{propellers}} of a DC-6 {{are designed}} to provide reverse thrust after the aircraft touches down. The pilot then retards the throttle levers to a point below idle speed and that directs the electric mechanisms in the propeller hub to rotate the blades to a position in which they will provide reverse thrust. Should the pilot need to perform a <b>go-around,</b> he moves the thrust levers forward to a positive position again and that will produce forward thrust, enabling the pilot to execute a <b>go-around</b> maneuver.|$|E

5|$|Owing to the {{confluence}} of these problems, the Census was completed and tabulated several months behind schedule to much popular criticism, and led indirectly to a deterioration in Walker's health {{during the spring of}} 1871. Walker took leave to travel to England with Bowles that summer to recuperate and upon return that fall, despite an offer from The New York Times to join their editorial board with an annual salary of $8,000 ($ in 2016), accepted Secretary Columbus Delano's offer to become the U.S. Commissioner of Indian Affairs in November 1871. The appointment was simultaneously a <b>go-around</b> to continue to fund Walker's federal responsibilities as Census superintendent despite Congress' cessation of appropriations for the position as well as a political opportunity to replace a scandal-ridden predecessor. Walker continued to work on the Census for several years thereafter, culminating in the publication of the Statistical Atlas of the United States that was unprecedented in its use of visual statistics and maps to report the results of the Census. The Atlas won him praise from both the Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution as well as a First Class medal from the International Geographical Congress.|$|E

5000|$|The flight {{engineer}} ("air engineer" [...] in the Royal Air Force) is {{primarily concerned with}} the operation and monitoring of all aircraft systems, [...] and is required to diagnose, and where possible rectify or eliminate, any faults that may arise. On most multi-engine airplanes, the FE sets and adjusts engine power during take off, climb, cruise, <b>go-arounds,</b> or at any time the pilot flying requests a specific power setting to be set during the approach phase. The FE sets and monitors major systems, including fuel, pressurization and air conditioning, hydraulic, electrics (engine driven generators, auxiliary power units), gas turbine compressor/air turbine motor (APU, GTC, ATM), ice and rain protection (engine and nacelle anti-ice, window heat, probe heater), oxygen, fire and overheat protection of all systems, liquid cooling system (Boeing E-3), draw through cooling system (Boeing E-3), forced air cooling system (Boeing E-3), and powered flying controls.|$|R
25|$|The {{technical}} log {{for the flight}} indicated that the co-pilot was pilot flying (PF) for the flight. The CVR and ATC recordings also indicate that the co-pilot was PF during the flight.

As no autopilot or flight director (FD) was fitted, the PF was under a high workload throughout the flight. This was especially so as three approaches were made in poor weather to below minima with two <b>go-arounds.</b> Normally the PF handles both flight and engine controls in a coordinated manner to achieve the required flight path; the PNF carries out other tasks including monitoring the aircraft's flight path, radio communications and keeping the flight log.

5000|$|The {{aircraft}} {{had just}} successfully completed a landing, after {{the captain had}} performed two simulated engine loss <b>go-arounds,</b> taking a total of 55 minutes. The second takeoff would be made with the aircraft's center of gravity located in an extreme aft position. [...] This time the aircraft was flown by the co-pilot, while the actions to shut off the engine and hydraulic circuit, and engage the autopilot, were {{carried out by the}} captain. The takeoff was completed successfully and the captain shut off the engine and hydraulic circuit. Three attempts were needed to engage the autopilot [...] and the aircraft started to ascend to 2000 ft. The aircraft climbed too steeply, decreasing airspeed to 100 kn, below the minimum 118 knots required to maintain control. The aircraft started to roll, so the crew reduced power on the operating engine to counter the thrust asymmetry. This exacerbated the problem and the aircraft pitched down 15 degrees and soon after crashed into the ground. All seven people on board were killed, and the aircraft was damaged beyond repair.|$|R
25|$|The {{accident}} was {{investigated by the}} Sección de Investigación de Accidentes of Guatemala's Dirección General de Aeronáutica Civil.

50|$|The initial {{standard}} model was the 707-120 with JT3C turbojet engines. Qantas ordered a shorter-bodied version called the 707-138, {{which was a}} −120 with six fuselage frames removed, three {{in front of the}} wings, and three aft. The frames in the 707 were each 20 in (500 mm) apart, so this resulted in a net shortening of 10 ft (3 m) to 134 ft. Because the maximum takeoff weight remained {{the same as that of}} the −120 (247,000 lb or 112 t), the −138 was able to fly the longer routes that Qantas needed. Braniff International Airways ordered the higher-thrust version with Pratt & Whitney JT4A engines, the 707-220. The final major derivative was the 707-320, which featured an extended-span wing and JT4A engines, while the 707-420 was the same as the −320, but with Conway turbofan engines. British certification requirements relating to <b>go-arounds</b> with one engine inoperative also forced Boeing to increase the height of the tail fin on all 707 variants, as well as add a ventral fin, which was retrofitted on earlier −120 and −220 aircraft. These modifications also aided in the mitigation of Dutch roll by providing more stability in yaw.|$|R
40|$|An {{emergency}} {{flight control system}} that uses only engine thrust, called the propulsion-controlled aircraft (PCA) system, was developed and flight tested on an MD- 11 airplane. The PCA system is a thrust-only control system, which augments pilot flightpath and track commands with aircraft feedback parameters to control engine thrust. The PCA system was implemented on the MD- 11 airplane using only software modifications to existing computers. Results of a 25 -hr flight test show that the PCA system {{can be used to}} fly to an airport and safely land a transport airplane with an inoperative flight control system. In up-and-away operation, the PCA system served as an acceptable autopilot capable of extended flight over a range of speeds, altitudes, and configurations. PCA approaches, <b>go-arounds,</b> and three landings without the use of any normal flight controls were demonstrated, including ILS-coupled hands-off landings. PCA operation was used to recover from an upset condition. The PCA system was also tested at altitude with all three hydraulic systems turned off. This paper reviews the principles of throttles-only flight control, a history of accidents or incidents in which some or all flight controls were lost, the MD- 11 airplane and its systems, PCA system development, operation, flight testing, and pilot comments...|$|R
25|$|The F28 {{was similar}} in design to the British Aircraft Corporation BAC One-Eleven and Douglas DC-9, {{as it had}} a T-tail and engines mounted {{at the rear of}} the fuselage. The {{aircraft}} had wings with a slight crescent angle of sweep with ailerons at the tip, simple flaps, and five-section liftdumper only operated after landing to dump the lift. These were employed rather than reverse thrust as the designers felt that doing so not only reduced weight, but maintenance also. Having no reversers also meant that on unpaved airstrips there was less chance of the engines ingesting debris. The leading edge was fixed (although one experimental model had leading edge slats and these were offered as an option) and was anti-iced by bleed air from the engines. The tail cone could split and be hydraulically opened to the sides to act as a variable air brake – also used on the contemporaneous Blackburn Buccaneer. This design was also used on the HS-146, which became the BAe-146. The design is unique in that it not only slows the aircraft down rapidly, it can aid in rapid descents from economic cruising altitudes and also allowed the engines to be set at higher RPM which helped eliminate 'lag time'. This means the engines respond faster if needed for sudden speed increases or <b>go-arounds</b> on the approach to landing. The Fellowship had a retractable tricycle landing gear which used large low pressure tyres enabling the use of unpaved airstrips. Large wheel brakes also helped in shortening the landing run.|$|R
25|$|A {{torque split}} between the powerplants, caused by a {{defective}} Pt2/Tt2 sensor, became significant when the power levers were retarded below Flight Idle and the No. 1 powerplant entered negative torque regime. Subsequently, when the power levers were rapidly advanced during the attempted <b>go-around,</b> this probably further contributed to the roll behaviour as recorded on the FDR.|$|E
25|$|Investigators {{published}} {{the final report}} and concluded that pilot error {{was the cause of}} the crash. The investigation determined that there were no issues with the aircraft and all systems were operating normally. The investigation concluded several factors to this accident were the pitch angle versus engine power on the FDR data indicated that the basic principle of jet aircraft flying was not adhered during manual flying, aircraft flight path became unstable below MDA when the rate of descend exceeding 300 metres per minute, in which this situation was not recognised by either pilot, and the Captain's decision to <b>go-around</b> was conducted at an altitude which was insufficient for the <b>go-around</b> to be executed successfully. The flight crew loss of situational awareness in regards of visual references once the aircraft entered a rain cloud during the final approach below minimum descend altitude (MDA), thus, the plane crashed into the water.|$|E
25|$|Because of the captain's unfamiliarity {{with the}} {{aircraft}} specifications, he {{waited too long}} to commit himself to the <b>go-around</b> procedure, dooming the aircraft as immediate action was necessary. The CAB also determined that the pilot had available alternative procedures which would have enabled him to complete the maneuver safely. The cause of the crash was ultimately determined {{to be due to}} pilot error.|$|E
40|$|Several crosswind-related {{incidents}} {{show that}} landing under heavy crosswind conditions {{can be challenging}} for pilots and may {{pose a threat to}} aviation or at least lead to higher pilot workload and/or irregularities in operations. For transport aircraft the common approach technique for crosswind landings is the so-called crabbed approach with wings level and a windward heading correction. This technique requires alignment of the aircraft with the runway prior to touchdown in order to keep lateral loads of the landing gear and tyres as low as possible and to maintain the controllability on ground after touchdown. The German Aerospace Center Institute of Flight Systems has used the idea of steerable main gears and developed a crosswind landing assistance system. During approach all gear struts are automatically aligned with the runway so that no decrab manoeuvre is required. On ground the assistance system uses each steerable landing gear, differential braking, and the aerodynamic control surfaces to control and stabilise the aircraft. After touchdown the aircraft is automatically aligned with the runway centreline and the still existing crab angle is slowly reduced. A simulator study with pilots in the loop using a model of a typical medium range transport aircraft was conducted in order to evaluate the benefits of such a landing technique. The study revealed that not only the aircraft controllability could be improved by landing in crabbed motion under strong crosswind conditions, but that the side forces acting on the landing gear can be reduced significantly as well. It was also shown that the use of steerable main landing gears is able to enlarge the spectrum of autoland operations, which is relatively limited at present in terms of maximum allowable crosswinds. All together the system has shown to be able to improve flight safety, lower the risk of weatherrelated delays due to <b>go-arounds</b> or diversions, and it also reduces structural loads on the landing gear during touchdown and landing...|$|R
40|$|A {{human-in-the-loop}} simulation {{conducted in}} the Airspace Operations Laboratory (AOL) at NASA Ames Research Center explored the feasibility of a Next Generation Air Transportation System (NextGen) solution to address airspace and airport capacity limitations {{in and around the}} New York metropolitan area. A week-long study explored the feasibility of a new Optimal Profile Descent (OPD) arrival into the airspace as well as a novel application of a Terminal Area Precision Scheduling and Spacing (TAPSS) enhancement to the Traffic Management Advisor (TMA) arrival scheduling tool to coordinate high volume arrival traffic to intersecting runways. In the simulation, four en route sector controllers and four terminal radar approach control (TRACON) controllers managed traffic inbound to Newark International Airport's primary runway, 22 L, and its intersecting overflow runway, 11. TAPSS was used to generate independent arrival schedules for each runway and a traffic management coordinator participant adjusted the arrival schedule for each runway 11 aircraft to follow one of the 22 L aircraft. TAPSS also provided controller-managed spacing tools (slot markers with speed advisories and timelines) to assist the TRACON controllers in managing the arrivals that were descending on OPDs. Results showed that the tools significantly decreased the occurrence of runway violations (potential <b>go-arounds)</b> when compared with a Baseline condition with no tools. Further, the combined use of the tools with the new OPD produced a peak arrival rate of over 65 aircraft per hour using instrument flight rules (IFR), exceeding the current maximum arrival rate at Newark Liberty International Airport (EWR) of 52 per hour under visual flight rules (VFR). Although the participants rated the workload as relatively low and acceptable both with and without the tools, they rated the tools as reducing their workload further. Safety and coordination were rated by most participants as acceptable in both conditions, although the TRACON Runway Coordinator (TRC) rated neither as acceptable in the Baseline condition. Regarding the role of the TRC, the two TRACON controllers handling the 11 arrivals indicated that the TRC was very much needed in the Baseline condition without tools, but not needed in the condition with tools. This indicates that the tools were providing much of the sequencing and spacing information that the TRC had supplied in the Baseline condition...|$|R
