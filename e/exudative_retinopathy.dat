40|$|Contributed by {{request and}} {{dedicated}} to Sir Stewart Duke-Elder The lesions {{which may be}} present in diabetic retinopathy are diverse, and the research, both clinical and histopathological, which has been necessary to elucidate their formation and evolution, has had to be laborious and prolonged. These studies have, however, led {{to the use of}} some well-defined therapeutic measures which are undoubtedly of value in this condition which is now the leading cause of blindness in patients under 65 years of age in Great Britain (Sorsby, I 973). A patient with diabetic retinopathy may lose vision in one of two conditions which often co-exist: (i) Because of bleeding from new vessel formations or later from vitreous opacities and secondary traction effects on the retina (Proliferative diabetic retinopathy). or (2) Retinal oedema, deposition of lipoid, pre-retinal fibrosis, or capillary closure in the macular area (Simple or <b>exudative</b> diabetic <b>retinopathy</b> or, better, diabetic maculopathy).

Linear logistic analyses (two tailed tests) showed that the initial features independently predictive of retinopathy were duration of diabetes, poor glycaemic control, impotence, and [...] unexpectedly [...] heavy alcohol consumption. Poor glycaemic control in the interim and proteinuria at review were also associated {{with the development of}} retinopathy. No relation was found with smoking or obesity. Glycaemic control and alcohol consumption were therefore the only aetiologically relevant associations identified.

40|$|Norrie {{disease is}} an X-linked {{recessive}} disorder that presents with congenital blindness, progressive deafness and rarely with mental retardation. It {{is caused by}} mutations in the Norrie Disease Pseudoglioma (NDP) gene, which may also lead to milder diseases like <b>exudative</b> vitreoretinopathy, <b>retinopathy</b> of prematurity or Coats’ disease. In the eye, mutations in NDP lead to a delayed and incomplete development of the superficial retinal vascular plexus (SRVP) and they prevent {{the development of the}} two deep retinal vascular plexuses. This is accompanied with persisting hyaloid vessels around the vitreous. It has been shown that Norrin, the protein product of NDP, binds the coreceptor complex consisting of Fz- 4, LRP- 5 and Tspan- 12 which leads to the downstream activation of canonical Wnt signaling. Despite the phenotypic and molecular knowledge about Norrin, the intrinsic function of Norrin during retinal blood vessel development remains a mystery. This thesis aimed to gain more insight about the role of Norrin during retinal blood vessel development from Ndphy/- mice. This work suggests that Norrin-Wnt signaling and Notch signaling may not be directly linked. Further, endomucin was identified as a marker for central thorn-like aligned filopodia in Ndphy/- mice and extensive mural cell coverage of the SRVP from Ndphy/- retinas was found after P 9. Arterial/vein crossing within the SRVP of Ndphy/- retinas was described for the first time. This indicates that MAPK signaling might be altered in Ndphy/- retinas since knockout mice with altered MAPK signaling also display vessel crossing. Norrin was further identified to be a mitogen for cells of the SRVP which is in concert with in vitro data from micro vascular endothelial cells. Finally, equal numbers of hyaloid vascular associated macrophages was found between P 7 and P 12 in Ndphy/- mice, suggesting that hyaloid vessels fail to regress despite the presence of a constant number of macrophages. In sum, it was shown that the loss of Norrin signaling might primarily affect MAPK signaling rather than Notch signaling...|$|R

40|$|AbstractRetinal glial tumors and pseudotumors can be {{classified}} into astrocytic hamartoma, acquired retinal astrocytoma, massive gliosis, and focal nodular gliosis. Each has different clinical manifestations. Astrocytic hamartoma is usually seen patients who have some manifestations of tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC). It can occur as a noncalcified or calcified variety, and often {{a combination of the}} two, and has fairly typical features with fluorescein angiography, ultrasonography, and optical coherence tomography. Although it is generally a stationary lesion, an aggressive variant seen in very young children with TSC can lead to <b>exudative</b> <b>retinopathy,</b> retinal detachment, and neovascular glaucoma. Acquired astrocytoma general occurs in somewhat older individuals who do not have TSC. Like the aggressive form of astrocytic hamartoma it can lead to <b>exudative</b> <b>retinopathy</b> and exudative retinal detachment. Pseudoneoplastic diffuse retinal gliosis can occur as massive glial proliferation in eyes with prior trauma, Coats disease, retinal angiomatosis and other conditions and often occurs in blind eyes. Pseudoneoplastic focal retinal gliosis is characterized by a very superficial, white, noncalcified lesion in otherwise normal eye in somewhat older individuals. Recognition of these glial lesions is important because they can resemble malignant tumors and have different clinical courses and complications...|$|E
40|$|Pathoangiogenesis {{participates in}} the {{development}} and progression of diabetic <b>retinopathy,</b> <b>exudative</b> age-related macular degeneration (AMD), and retinopathy of prematurity [1, 2]. While diabetic retinopathy is the major cause of severe vision loss in middle-aged patients, choroidal neovascularization (CNV) is the reason for the same in eld-erly patients. Thus, there is an increased interest in understand-ing what factors are important in regulating the retinal angio-genic process, so that therapeutic intervention can be devel-oped to treat these conditions. The retinal angiogenic process is driven by the growth factor VEGF (vascular endothelial growth factor), adhesion molecules, matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), lipid messen-gers, and inflammatory cytokines [3 - 6]. Pathoangiogenesis in-volves vascular basement membrane degradation, endothelial cell (EC) migration, EC proliferation, and the formation of new capillary tubes [7]. The retina is very sensitive to hy-poxia, since this neural tissue has the highest blood flow rate of the body. Retinal hypoxia stimulates hypoxia-inducible fac-tor (HIF) - 1 αactivation and enhances transcription and secre-tion of VEGF [8]. Others have shown that the retina and vitre-ous isolated from patients with ischemic retinopathies have increased levels of VEGF [5, 8, 9]. Choroidal neovascularizaton, a consequence of abnormalities in the Bruch’s membrane and retinal pigment epithelial cells, correlates with VEGF expres-sion [10]. It was initially thought that under hypoxic condi-tions, retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells regulate choroi-dal EC changes through the release of pro-angiogenic factors, such as VEGF [8]. However, more recently it has been sug-gested that choroidal circulation is altered in patients with AMD, thus resulting in a hypoxic environment surrounding the endothelium, which could change the levels of pro-angio...|$|R

Methods: Seventy-eight consecutive patients with uveal melanoma were treated with the stereotactic radiosurgery (radiation dose 30 - 50 Gy) with Leksell Gamma-Knife at the San Raffaele University Hospital, Milan, Italy between 1994 and 2006. The main outcome measures evaluated were: survival rate, local tumor control, eye retention rate, visual acuity, treatment-related complications. Results: Survival rate was 88. 8 % at 3 years and 81. 9 % at 5 years. Local tumor control was achieved in 91. 0 % of patients. The median tumor thickness reduction after treatment was 1. 96 mm (p< 0. 0001) (- 32, 1 %). The eye retention rate was 89. 7 %. A significant relative reduction of visual acuity was observed during follow-up. The most frequent treatment-related complications were: <b>exudative</b> <b>retinopathy</b> (33. 3 %), neovascular glaucoma (18. 7 %), radiogenic retinopathy (13. 5 %) and vitreous hemorrhages (10. 4 %).

40|$|Purpose:Coats' {{disease is}} a non-hereditary {{condition}} characterized by idiopathic retinal telangiectasia, and <b>exudative</b> <b>retinopathy.</b> Although the exudation often spreads from the main areas of telangiectasia, there is a preferential accumulation of exudation in the macular area in Coats' disease. A subfoveal nodule has usually been described {{in the context of}} resolution of macular exudates after treatment of peripheral retinal telangiectasis. Nevertheless, a recent reports stressed out an uncommon prominent subfoveal nodule with peripheral exudates as initial presentation of Coats'disease. The {{purpose of this study was}} to report the prevalence of this presentation in a cohort of patients. Methods:All consecutive patients with Coats' disease referred to the Jules Gonin Eye Hospital between January 1979 and July 2006 were included. All charts were screened for a clear cut subfoveal circular lesion on fundus photographies at initial presentation. Results: 95 patients suffering of Coat's disease were enrolled. 33 out of 95 patients had subtotal or total exudative retinal detachment, which impeded macular examination. 14 out of 62 (22. 6 %) resting patients presented with a clear cut prominent circular subfoveal lesion at initial presentation. All patients had unilateral disease. Mean age was 5. 6 ± 3. 5 year old at initial presentation. There were 4 females and 10 males. Pigmentation and size of the nodule were not homogenous. Mean diameter was 1. 1 ± 0. 5 optic disc diameter. Conclusions:The present study shows that subfoveal nodule is not such a rare primary presentation of Coats' disease in contrast to what it has been previously reported in the literature. Thus the initial finding of prominent subfoveal nodule associated with peripheral retinal findings made the diagnosis of Coats' disease highly likely. Physicians should be aware that a proeminent subfoveal nodule is a common initial presentation of Coats' disease as it can be confused clinically with Retinoblastoma...|$|E
