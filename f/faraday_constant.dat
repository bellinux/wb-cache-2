The electric charge per mole of electrons is a constant called the <b>Faraday</b> <b>constant</b> and had been known since 1834 when Michael Faraday published his works on electrolysis. By dividing the charge on a mole of electrons by the charge on a single electron the value of Avogadro's number is obtained.
