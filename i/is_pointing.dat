5|$|On March 13, 2015 DC Comics {{released}} 25 Joker-themed variant {{covers for}} its various monthly series for release that June, {{in celebration of}} the character's 75th anniversary. Among them was a cover to Batgirl #41 by artist Rafael Albuquerque that took its inspiration from The Killing Joke. The cover depicts the Joker {{standing next to a}} tearful Batgirl, who has a red smile painted across her mouth. The Joker has one hand holding a revolver draped over Batgirl's shoulder and <b>is</b> <b>pointing</b> to her cheek with the other hand, as if gesturing to shoot her.|$|E
5|$|The {{combination}} of these two opposite torques creates a resulting yaw torque on the front wheel, and its direction {{is a function of}} the side-slip angle of the tire, the angle between the actual path of the tire and the direction it <b>is</b> <b>pointing,</b> and the camber angle of the tire (the angle that the tire leans from the vertical). The result of this torque is often the suppression of the inversion speed predicted by rigid wheel models described above in the section on steady-state turning.|$|E
5|$|The tufted tit-tyrant uses three {{different}} hunting strategies to catch its prey. Gleaning insects from a perch is its primary hunting strategy; while gleaning, the bird sits upright with its wings dropped below the tail, which <b>is</b> <b>pointing</b> straight down. From this position the tit-tyrant scans upwards into the vegetation {{for three to}} five seconds before attacking, making them surprisingly deliberate hunters for a small flycatcher.|$|E

5|$|In Star Wars: Jedi Arena, two Jedi Knights, one {{blue and}} one red, {{face each other}} during lightsaber training. Player one is blue; the red Jedi is either a human- or {{computer-controlled}} opponent. The player controls his or her lightsaber with the paddle controller, defending oneself from the laser blasts coming from the Seeker ball, fired by the opponent. The Seeker will regularly turn wild and fire laser blasts randomly. The objective {{of the game is}} to fire laser blasts from the Seeker at the opponent's shield and finally directly at the opponent by aiming in the direction that the lightsaber <b>is</b> <b>pointing.</b> The game has four difficulty levels, changing the Seeker's speed; on the highest level, the Seeker is invisible. The game ends when one player has received three direct hits, and the winner becomes a Jedi Master.|$|E
5|$|Most of the ranged {{weapons are}} based on real {{firearms}} {{with the exception of}} a Yithian directed-energy weapon introduced at the end of the game. The player character can also perform a melee attack with a crowbar or with a gun if all ammunition for it has been used up. The game features a realistic combat system: due to lack of HUD, the player has to count shots manually to know when the gun goes empty. There is also no artificial on-screen targeting reticle; instead, the player must aim through the iron sights on the weapons themselves, but sustained aiming tires the character and drops accuracy. The shooting system is unique in that fired rounds go exactly where the gun's barrel <b>is</b> <b>pointing.</b> For example, if the player character readies a reloaded weapon and the player pulls the trigger before the character animation has finished, the round will be discharged in the direction the gun was pointing when the shot was fired.|$|E

25|$|The {{use of an}} {{infrared}} sensor to detect position can cause some detection problems when other infrared sources are around, such as incandescent light bulbs or candles. This can be easily alleviated by using fluorescent lights around the Wii, which emit little to no infrared light. Innovative users have used other sources of IR light as Sensor Bar substitutes such {{as a pair of}} flashlights and a pair of candles. The Wii Remote picks up traces of heat from the sensor, then transmits it to the Wii console to control the pointer on your screen. Such substitutes for the Sensor Bar illustrate the fact that a pair of non-moving lights provide continuous calibration of the direction that the Wii Remote <b>is</b> <b>pointing</b> and its physical location relative to the light sources. There is no way to calibrate the position of the cursor relative to where the user <b>is</b> <b>pointing</b> the controller without the two stable reference sources of light provided by the Sensor Bar or substitutes. Third-party wireless sensor bars have also been released, which have been popular with users of Wii emulators since the official Sensor Bar utilizes a proprietary connector to connect to the Wii console.|$|E

25|$|In reverse {{swing the}} seam is angled {{in the same}} way as in {{conventional}} swing (10–20 degrees to one side) but the boundary layer on both sides is turbulent. The net effect of the seam and rough side is that the ball swings in the direction opposite to where the seam <b>is</b> <b>pointing</b> to. The turbulent boundary layer separating later is similar to the effect produced by dimples in a golf ball. In case of the golf ball, turbulence is produced on both sides of the ball and the net effect is a later separation of boundary layer on both sides and smaller wake in the back of the ball and a lower net drag due to pressure differential between the front and the back – this enables the golf ball to travel farther.|$|E

25|$|In 1922, Otto Stern and Walther Gerlach shot silver atoms {{through an}} (inhomogeneous) {{magnetic}} field. In classical mechanics, a magnet thrown through {{a magnetic field}} may be, depending on its orientation (if it <b>is</b> <b>pointing</b> with its northern pole upwards or down, or somewhere in between), deflected a small or large distance upwards or downwards. The atoms that Stern and Gerlach shot through the magnetic field acted in a similar way. However, while the magnets could be deflected variable distances, the atoms would always be deflected a constant distance either up or down. This implied that {{the property of the}} atom which corresponds to the magnet's orientation must be quantised, taking one of two values (either up or down), as opposed to being chosen freely from any angle.|$|E

This method will fail if the DV has been swept over to the left side of the cylinder.|$|E
