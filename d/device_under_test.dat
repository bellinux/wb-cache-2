25|$|The {{most common}} types of {{vibration}} testing services conducted by vibration test labs are Sinusoidal and Random. Sine (one-frequency-at-a-time) tests are performed {{to survey the}} structural response of the <b>device</b> <b>under</b> <b>test</b> (DUT). A random (all frequencies at once) test is generally considered to more closely replicate a real world environment, such as road inputs to a moving automobile.|$|E
25|$|It is {{the extra}} loss {{produced}} {{by the introduction of}} the <b>device</b> <b>under</b> <b>test</b> (DUT) between the 2 reference planes of the measurement. Notice that the extra loss can be introduced by intrinsic loss in the DUT and/or mismatch. In case of extra loss the insertion loss is defined to be positive. The negative of insertion loss expressed in decibels is defined as insertion gain.|$|E
25|$|Digital instruments, which {{necessarily}} incorporate amplifiers, use {{the same}} principles as analog instruments for resistance readings. For resistance measurements, usually a small constant current is passed through the <b>device</b> <b>under</b> <b>test</b> and the digital multimeter reads the resultant voltage drop; this eliminates the scale compression found in analog meters, but requires a source of precise current. An autoranging digital multimeter can automatically adjust the scaling network so the measurement circuits use the full precision of the A/D converter.|$|E
40|$|To {{determine}} the mass-moment-of-inertia properties of <b>devices</b> <b>under</b> <b>test</b> with particularly small mass moments of inertia (some 10 − 4 kg m 2), two measurement set-ups based on different measurement principles were developed. One set-up {{is based on}} a physical pendulum, the second set-up incorporates a torsion pendulum. Both measurement set-ups and their measurement principles are described in detail, including the chosen data acquisition and analysis. Measurement uncertainty estimations according to the Guide to the Expression of Uncertainty in Measurement (GUM) were carried out for both set-ups by applying Monte Carlo simulations. Both set-ups were compared using the same three <b>devices</b> <b>under</b> <b>test.</b> For each measurement result, the measurement uncertainties were estimated. The measurement results are compared in terms of consistency and the resulting measurement uncertainties. For the given <b>devices</b> <b>under</b> <b>test,</b> the torsion pendulum set-up gave results with smaller measurement uncertainties compared to the set-up incorporating a physical pendulum...|$|R

25|$|The {{second and}} third {{quadrants}} are the upper right and lower left 4 parameters, respectively. These are {{also referred to as}} the cross-mode quadrants. This is because they fully characterize any mode conversion occurring in the <b>device</b> <b>under</b> <b>test,</b> whether it is common-to-differential SDCab conversion (EMI susceptibility for an intended differential signal SDD transmission application) or differential-to-common SCDab conversion (EMI radiation for a differential application). Understanding mode conversion is very helpful when trying to optimize the design of interconnects for gigabit data throughput.|$|E
25|$|The fourth {{quadrant}} is {{the lower}} right 4 parameters and describes the performance characteristics of the common-mode signal SCCab propagating through the <b>device</b> <b>under</b> <b>test.</b> For a properly designed SDDab differential device there should be minimal common-mode output SCCab. However, the fourth quadrant common-mode response data {{is a measure of}} common-mode transmission response and used in a ratio with the differential transmission response to determine the network common-mode rejection. This common mode rejection is an important benefit of differential signal processing and can be reduced to one in some differential circuit implementations.|$|E
500|$|When the {{slotted line}} is {{terminated}} with a precision matching load {{there is no}} variation in the detected power along the line, other than a very small decrease due to losses in the line. [...] However, when this {{is replaced by a}} <b>device</b> <b>under</b> <b>test</b> (DUT) which is not perfectly matched to the line there will be a reflection back towards the source. [...] This causes a standing wave to be set up on the line with periodic maxima and minima (collectively, extrema) due to alternating constructive and destructive interference. [...] These extrema are found by moving the probe back and forth along the line and the level at that point can then be measured on the meter.|$|E

2500|$|Vibration {{testing is}} {{accomplished}} by introducing a forcing function into a structure, usually with some type of shaker. Alternately, a DUT (<b>device</b> <b>under</b> <b>test)</b> {{is attached to the}} [...] "table" [...] of a shaker. Vibration testing is performed to examine the response of a <b>device</b> <b>under</b> <b>test</b> (DUT) to a defined vibration environment. The measured response may be fatigue life, resonant frequencies or squeak and rattle sound output (NVH). Squeak and rattle testing is performed with a special type of quiet shaker that produces very low sound levels while under operation.|$|E
2500|$|It is safest (for both multimeter, circuit under test, and the operator) to {{disconnect}} a component from its circuit, and almost always, to remove {{power from the}} device being investigated. [...] Removing all power connections from a piece of mains powered equipment before testing (and ensuring that all large capacitance devices are discharged safely) is the safest choice. [...] Leaving equipment attached to the mains supply while making measurements should be only a very carefully considered alternative choice. [...] Amongst other issues, there are interactions between the ground arrangements for wall powered test equipment, and the <b>device</b> <b>under</b> <b>test,</b> which are unsafe, and can damage test equipment and the <b>device</b> <b>under</b> <b>test.</b> This is especially so {{when there is a}} fault, suspected or not, in any of the interconnected devices.

2500|$|For an {{isolated}} device, touching a single powered conductor {{does not cause}} a severe shock, {{because there is no}} path back to the other conductor through the ground. However, shocks and electrocution may still occur if both poles of the transformer are contacted by bare skin. Previously it was suggested that repairmen [...] "work with one hand behind their back" [...] to avoid touching two parts of the <b>device</b> <b>under</b> <b>test</b> at the same time, thereby preventing a circuit from crossing through the chest and interrupting cardiac rhythms/ causing cardiac arrest.|$|E
2500|$|To measure resistance, {{switches}} {{arrange for}} a small battery within the instrument to pass a current through the <b>device</b> <b>under</b> <b>test</b> and the meter coil. Since the current available depends {{on the state of}} charge of the battery which changes over time, a multimeter usually has an adjustment for the ohms scale to zero it. In the usual circuits found in analog multimeters, the meter deflection is inversely proportional to the resistance, so full-scale will be 0ohms, and higher resistance will correspond to smaller deflections. [...] The ohms scale is compressed, so resolution is better at lower resistance values.|$|E
2500|$|A {{multimeter}} can use {{many different}} test probes {{to connect to}} the circuit or <b>device</b> <b>under</b> <b>test.</b> Crocodile clips, retractable hook clips, and pointed probes are the three most common types. Tweezer probes are used for closely spaced test points, as for instance surface-mount devices. The connectors are attached to flexible, well insulated leads terminated with connectors appropriate for the meter. Probes are connected to portable meters typically by shrouded or recessed banana jacks, while benchtop meters may use banana jacks or BNC connectors. 2mm plugs and binding posts have also been used at times, but are less commonly used today. [...] Indeed, safety ratings now require shrouded banana jacks.|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{focuses on}} a digital Built-in Self-Test (BIST) {{approach}} to perform specification oriented testing of the analog portion of a mixed-signal system. The BIST utilizes a direct digital synthesizer (DDS) based test pattern generator (TPG) and a multiplieraccumulator (MAC) based output response analyzer (ORA) to stimulate and analyze the analog <b>devices</b> <b>under</b> <b>test,</b> respectively. This approach uses the digital-to-analog converter (DAC) and the analog-to-digital converter (ADC), which typically already exist in a mixed signal circuits, to connect the digital BIST circuitry to the analog <b>device(s)</b> <b>under</b> <b>test</b> (DUT). Previous work has improved and analyzed the capabilities and effectiveness of using this BIST approach to test analog circuitry; however, little {{work has been done}} to determine the fault coverage of the digital BIST circuitry itself. Traditionally additional test circuitry dedicated to testing would be added to the BIST circuitry to provide adequate fault coverage of digital circuitry. While ensuring that the digital circuitry is thoroughly tested and functioning properly, this circuitry incurs a potentially high area overhead and performance penalty. This thesis focuses on using the existing BIST circuitry to test itself by utilizing a dedicated digital loopback path. A set of test procedures is developed and analyzed whic...|$|R
2500|$|The {{measurement}} of the impedance of devices and transmission lines is a practical problem in radio technology and other fields. Measurements of impedance may be carried out at one frequency, or the variation of device impedance over a range of frequencies may be of interest. The impedance may be measured or displayed directly in ohms, or other values related to impedance may be displayed; for example, in a radio antenna, the standing wave ratio or reflection coefficient may be more useful than the impedance alone. The {{measurement of}} impedance requires the {{measurement of the}} magnitude of voltage and current, and the phase difference between them. Impedance is often measured by [...] "bridge" [...] methods, similar to the direct-current Wheatstone bridge; a calibrated reference impedance is adjusted to balance off the effect of the impedance of the <b>device</b> <b>under</b> <b>test.</b> Impedance measurement in power electronic devices may require simultaneous measurement and provision of power to the operating device.|$|E
