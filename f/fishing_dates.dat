40|$|Sri Lanka's {{interest}} in trawler <b>fishing</b> <b>dates</b> back to 1902 when a Colombo merchant attempted {{to operate a}} trawler off Sri Lanka's waters. The next attempt was made in 1907. These attempts did not proceed any further. Between 1920 and 1923 a very comprehensive survey of the littoral waters around the island was carried out. One of the principal aims of the survey {{was to investigate the}} possibility of trawler fishing in the seas around. Malpas (1926) and Pearson and Malpas (1926) reporting the results of the survey indicated that the Wadge and Pedro banks were the only areas available for commercial trawler operations and indicated that the fish resources in the two banks could be profitably exploited. Commercial exploitation of the Wadge bank commenced in 1928 and a fishery is now firmly established in the bank. The Marine Biologist and the Director of fisheries in their administration reports and Sivalingam and Medcof (1957) and the author (1965) have reported on the progress of the Wadge bank fishery. Some of the trends indicated by an analysis of the records of the commercial trawling operations are further discussed in this paper...|$|E

40|$|Research PaperFisheries co-management is {{essentially}} the sharing of responsibilities and/or authority {{between the government and}} local resource users to manage the fishery resource. This strategy is recognized as a solution to the problems encountered in centralized top-down management approaches. In the 'stake net fishery' of Negombo estuary in Sri Lanka, an effective co-management strategy exists where the traditional practices of sharing <b>fishing</b> <b>dates</b> and sites among four community groups are reinforced by government regulations. In the same estuary, some fishers cultivate mangroves for obtaining twigs and branches for construction of brush parks, a traditional practice useful for mangrove conservation. In the kraal fishery of Madu Ganga estuary of Sri Lanka, traditional community-based management (CBM) system has disappeared in early 1970 s due to various socioeconomic and political reasons. Through revitalization of features of CBM, a co-management strategy can be introduced to this fishery. The annual inland fish production of Sri Lanka has declined dramatically after 1990, when state patronage for the development of inland fisheries was discontinued for 4 years in the absence of state-sponsored monitoring procedure in the fishery. Fisheries co-management is therefore an effective means for the management of inland capture fishery of the country. A co-management strategy for the culture-based fisheries in non-perennial reservoirs of Sri Lanka is also suggested...|$|E
40|$|Recreational {{fishing in}} the United States {{promotes}} economic growth, cultural traditions, and environmental stewardship, but can also negatively impact fish stocks when fisheries are mismanaged. The scale of recreational fisheries is often underestimated due to difficulties in monitoring their complex, dynamic, and often expansive nature. In California, the documented history of recreational <b>fishing</b> <b>dates</b> to the late 1800 s, and the industry has grown since. In 2013, California marine anglers took 5. 3 million fishing trips, landed 8. 4 million fish, and contributed $ 2. 8 billion to the economy. Despite this extensive history and the well developed fisheries of the present day, we have limited quantitative historical fisheries data as well as measurements of current fish population dynamics. We developed a new historical database of "trophy" fish catch records (1966 - 2013) that could provide early signs of fisheries overexploitation, given that these large size classes are generally the most vulnerable to the impacts of fishing. We also founded the Coastal Angler Tagging Cooperative {{in partnership with the}} recreational fishing community to conduct demographic analyses of three of the most important recreationally targeted inshore species in the genus Paralabrax. Historical analyses indicate that "trophy" sizes of pelagic and coastal pelagic species are generally showing little signs of decline, while most decreasing trends are exhibited by demersal species. Rockfishes in particular (Sebastes sp) have shown both temporal and spatial declines in trophy size. However, the demersal species are also the most likely to benefit from the recently implemented statewide network of Marine Protected Areas (MPAs), and many rockfishes have begun to show positive trends since new management policies were adopted in 2001. Our analyses of Paralabrax populations indicate a positive response to the recently implemented increase in minimum size limits, as well as spatial and seasonal differences in both length frequency and catch-per-unit-effort, depending on the species. We documented a new spawning aggregation site for Barred Sand Bass (P. nebulifer), and we highlight the virtual absence of traditional spawning behavior for this species in both 2013 and 2014. Collaborations between the scientific and fishing communities can be highly successful, and we encourage this in future research effort...|$|E

30|$|The use of {{in vitro}} assays to study {{xenobiotic}} biotransformation in <b>fish</b> <b>dates</b> {{back to the}} 1980 s. Mainly preparations from the liver such as the S 9 fraction, the microsomal fraction or isolated hepatocytes were employed (e.g. [10, 43, 65, 131]) but also established fish cell lines (e.g. [135]). The majority of these studies were interested in identifying the xenobiotic metabolites rather than predicting in vivo bioaccumulation. Nevertheless, these assays are principally suitable to generate data on xenobiotic biotransformation rates in the liver of fish.

40|$|International audienceResidues of {{pesticides}} in fish farming productions from barrage ponds are seldom studied {{in spite of}} increasing health questionings and environmental concerns. The {{purpose of this study}} is to establish the pesticide contamination profiles of sediments and edible fish from five ponds in Northeastern France. Multi-residues method and liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry analysis were used to quantify 13 pesticides (azoxystrobin, carbendazim, clomazone, diflufenican, dimethachlor, fluroxypyr, iprodion, isoproturon, mesosulfuron-methyl, metazachlor, napropamid, quizalofop and thifensulfuron-methyl). Ten sediments and 143 muscles samples were analysed, corresponding to two successive fishing campaigns (first <b>fishing</b> <b>date</b> and second <b>fishing</b> <b>date</b> (P 2), about 1 year later) on five sites (noted C- 0, C- 25, C- 45, C- 75 and C- 85 to express the increasing gradient of crop area). Isoproturon was present in all sediments samples (1. 8 - 56. 4 mu g/kg dry weight). During P 2 period, carbendazim was quantified in the fish of site C- 0 (0. 09 +/- 0. 02, 0. 2 +/- 0. 1 and 0. 17 +/- 0. 06 mu g/kg wet weight (ww) for roach, carp and perch, respectively). Metazachlor was only quantified in perch of the site C- 25 (0. 13 +/- 0. 02 mu g/kg ww). Concentrations of isoproturon were similar for the sites C- 45 and C- 75 with 0. 4 +/- 0. 1 and 0. 75 +/- 0. 06 mu g/kg ww for carp and perch, respectively. Contamination of fish reflected generally concentrations in surroundings. Isoproturon was the most concentrated and its main source was water for perch while carp was exposed through both water and sediments, highlighting their life strategies in pond...|$|R
