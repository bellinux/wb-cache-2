5000|$|Tanenhaus used <b>eye-tracking</b> <b>software</b> and {{hardware}} {{to record the}} movement of the subjects' eyes as they listened to phrases and manipulated objects in a scene. For critical stimuli, Tanenhaus used phrases that contained syntactic ambiguities, such as [...] "Put the apple on the towel in the box," [...] where the prepositional phrase [...] "on the towel" [...] is initially ambiguous between being a modifier (indicating which apple) or a goal (indicating where to put the apple). [...] "Put the apple that's on the towel in the box" [...] served as the control condition because [...] "that's" [...] signals that [...] "on the towel" [...] is unambiguously a modifier. Similar syntactic ambiguities had been used to provide evidence for modularity within syntactic processing. Tanenhaus speculated that a visual context could be just enough to influence the resolution of these ambiguities.|$|E

40|$|A {{simple method}} for the {{calibration}} of eye-tracking systems based on eye-features detection is proposed. Many eye-tracking systems are {{claimed to be}} robust to head movements in some degree, but such robustness is rarely fully quantified. Moving chin-rest and synthetic images have been proposed to investigate head movements. However, both methods have several limitations. The reported calibration method exploits {{for the first time}} ocular imaging eye models (OIEMs) in order to simulate the eye(s), thus allowing to easily investigate the effects due to head movements. Moreover, it can be useful for the development and comparison of <b>eye-tracking</b> hardware, <b>software</b> and whole systems. Differently from human subjects, OIEMs are standardized and time-invariant thus, comparisons can be performed at different times and places, leading OIEMs to be a potential gold standard test for eye-tracking systems. Preliminary verification performed on a basic eye tracking system corroborate the applicability of described method...|$|R

In this paper we present the outlines of a new project that aims at developing and implementing effective new methods for analyzing gaze data collected with mobile eye-tracking devices. More specifically, we argue for the integration of object recognition algorithms from vision engineering, such as invariant region matching techniques, in gaze analysis software. We present a series of arguments why an object-based approach may provide a significant surplus, in terms of analytical precision, flexibility, additional application areas and cost efficiency, to the existing systems that use predefined areas of analysis. In order to test the actual analytical power of object recognition algorithms {{for the analysis of}} gaze data recorded in the wild, we develop a series of test cases in different real world situations, including shopping behavior, navigation, handling and usability of mobile systems. By setting up these case studies in close collaboration with key players in the relevant fields (retailers, signage consultants, market and user-experience research, and developers of <b>eye-tracking</b> hard- and <b>software),</b> {{we will be able to}} sketch an accurate picture of the pros and cons of the proposed method in comparison to current analytical practice. status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|Mobile {{eye-tracking}} in external environments remains challenging, despite {{recent advances}} in <b>eye-tracking</b> <b>software</b> and hardware engineering. Many current methods fail {{to deal with the}} vast range of outdoor lighting conditions and the speed at which these can change. This confines experiments to artificial environments where conditions must be tightly controlled. Additionally, the emergence of low-cost eye tracking devices calls for the development of analysis tools that enable non-technical researchers to process the output of their images. We have developed a fast and accurate method (known as "SET") that is suitable even for natural environments with uncontrolled, dynamic and even extreme lighting conditions. We compared the performance of SET with that of two open-source alternatives by processing two collections of eye images: images of natural outdoor scenes with extreme lighting variations ("Natural"); and images of less challenging indoor scenes ("CASIA-Iris-Thousand"). We show that SET excelled in outdoor conditions and was faster, without significant loss of accuracy, indoors. SET offers a low cost eye-tracking solution, delivering high performance even in challenging outdoor environments. It is offered through an open-source MATLAB toolkit as well as a dynamic-link library ("DLL"), which can be imported into many programming languages including C# and Visual Basic in Windows OS (www. eyegoeyetracker. co. uk) ...|$|E

This project will investigate age-related differences in web browsing and will attempt to develop predictive mathematical models that describe them. Potential Benefits For older people The world wide web {{is becoming more and}} more important in everyday life – for finding information, shopping and communication. Optimising website design for older people will enable them to continue to use the web in the same way as the general population rather than excluding them from this resource. Plan Websites with different ‘information architectures ’ – for example deep and shallow hierarchies – will be tested by younger people and older people. These observations will then be compared with ‘optimum browsing paths ’ predicted by latent semantic analysis (LSA) and the data captured will be used to develop mathematical models of web browsing behaviour. For society Ensuring that older people remain able to access information via the web stops older people from becoming isolated from the mainstream of society.

40|$|The {{intent of}} this {{research}} was to add to the existing literature regarding hearing the voices of pre-verbal early years’ children with complex and special educational needs and to inform and {{contribute to the development of}} communication and interactive methods for this population. This research will be pertinent to the local and national context and recent legislation that promotes collaboration and participation with children, young people and their families. The exploratory research took a post-positivist pragmatic position, with elements from a transformative paradigm. This stance allowed flexibility in the way reality can be captured from this heterogeneous and potentially vulnerable population. This mixed-methods research study included a collective case study of children, parents and teaching staff sampled from a special educational needs school in the UK. Various data gathering methods such as <b>eye-tracking</b> <b>software,</b> questionnaires and observations were used. The findings imply that each child required individualised communication methods and adaptations were informed through observations and parental and teacher information. The findings also indicated a common thread across the case studies, which placed emphasis on adapting and considering the systems around the child, as well as the individual needs of the child themselves. This research will add to the limited, but growing body of literature exploring the barriers to hearing the voices of pre-verbal early years children with complex and SEND, as well as inform Educational Psychology (EP) practice by demonstrating how the views and opinions of this complex population can be included in the decisions that are made about them...|$|E

Introduction: Panoramic images {{are an important}} part of a patient’s dental and orthodontic record. They provide broad coverage and are a valuable screening tool for potential abnormalities and normal dental development. Dental students learn much about panoramic image anatomy during dental school but are not usually taught a systematic method of image interpretation. The use of an eye-tracker will allow visualization and statistical analysis of interpretation method to find differences between newer and experienced clinicians. Information gathered can be used to recommend an interpretation method to newer clinicians as they begin their dental career. Methods and Materials: Two groups of clinicians were created: ten clinicians with more than five years clinical experience (experienced clinicians) and ten clinicians with five years or less experience (newer clinicians). Five panoramic images, three which contained no significant findings and two which had significant findings, were used in the study. An eye-tracker and the <b>eye-tracking</b> <b>software</b> were used to record and evaluate the interpretation methods to find differences between the groups. Results: Newer clinician’s interpretation path entered more areas of pathology or abnormality in portions of the image other than the dentition. Areas of abnormality or pathology within the dentition were entered equally by the interpretations paths of both groups. Newer clinicians had longer interpretation times and their interpretations included more fixation points and covered more image area. Experienced clinicians were quicker with interpretation and showed more of an interpretation pattern. Conclusions: Newer clinicians are more complete (interpret the entire image), have more fixation points and spend longer time interpreting. Newer clinicians often had no pattern to interpretation, but had interpretation paths which entered areas of pathology or abnormality due to completeness of interpretation. Experienced clinicians showed much more pattern (systematic approach) to interpretation, but were less complete. In both groups, interpretations times were significantly longer when the entire image was interpreted...|$|E
40|$|Autism {{spectrum}} disorder (ASD) currently affects nearly 1 in 160 children worldwide. In over {{two-thirds of}} evaluations, no validated diagnostics are used and gold standard diagnostic tools {{are used in}} less than 5 % of evaluations. Currently, the diagnosis of ASD requires lengthy and expensive tests, in addition to clinical confirmation. Therefore, fast, cheap, portable, and easy-to-administer screening instruments for ASD are required. Several {{studies have shown that}} children with ASD have a lower preference for social scenes compared with children without ASD. Based on this, eye-tracking and measurement of gaze preference for social scenes {{has been used as a}} screening tool for ASD. Currently available <b>eye-tracking</b> <b>software</b> requires intensive calibration, training, or holding of the head to prevent interference with gaze recognition limiting its use in children with ASD. In this study, we designed a simple eye-tracking algorithm that does not require calibration or head holding, as a platform for future validation of a cost-effective ASD potential screening instrument. This system operates on a portable and inexpensive tablet to measure gaze preference of children for social compared to abstract scenes. A child watches a one-minute stimulus video composed of a social scene projected on the left side and an abstract scene projected on the right side of the tablet's screen. We designed five stimulus videos by changing the social/abstract scenes. Every child observed all the five videos in random order. We developed an eye-tracking algorithm that calculates the child's gaze preference for the social and abstract scenes, estimated as the percentage of the accumulated time that the child observes the left or right side of the screen, respectively. Twenty-three children without a prior history of ASD and 8 children with a clinical diagnosis of ASD were evaluated. The recorded video of the child´s eye movement was analyzed both manually by an observer and automatically by our algorithm. This study demonstrates that the algorithm correctly differentiates visual preference for either the left or right side of the screen (social or abstract scenes), identifies distractions, and maintains high accuracy compared to the manual classification. The error of the algorithm was 1. 52 %, when compared to the gold standard of manual observation. This tablet-based gaze preference/eye-tracking algorithm can estimate gaze preference in both children with ASD and without ASD to a high degree of accuracy, without the need for calibration, training, or restraint of the children. This system can be utilized in low-resource settings as a portable and cost-effective potential screening tool for ASD...|$|E

The third paper [...] Chpater 5. Thesis conclusion. In the marketplace, {{advertising}} clutter {{refers to the}} high volume of advertising consumers are exposed to daily. This high quantity of advertisements has negative effects on unfamiliar brands which always face difficulties competing with other more familiar brands from the same product category. This thesis shows that unfamiliar brands {{have to work harder}} to overcome advertising clutter. Many academic researchers and marketers find that advertising creativity is an important strategic tool that should be considered when trying to attract consumer attention, increase advertisement and brand liking, and improve advertisement and brand memory. Thus, the thesis investigates “does advertising creativity overcome clutter?” and measuring that effects on attention, affect, and memory. This thesis includes one theoretical and two experimental papers to address the effects of advertising creativity on brand familiarity and competitive advertising interference. It also uses eye-tracking techniques to measure attention. The experiments were designed as realistic experiments, one session time, using a within subjects design. Participants were exposed to a digital magazine which was designed into the <b>eye-tracking</b> <b>software.</b> The ads in this magazine included 24 advertisements which were manipulated to be attributed to both familiar and unfamiliar brands. Of these, eight were highly creative advertisements which won major advertising creativity competitions. Eight control and eight interference advertisements were also selected. A pre-test identified familiar and unfamiliar brands. The data were analysed by using GLM models for attention and affect and also logistic regression models for memory. Four dependent variables used to measure attention, which are total fixation duration toward the advertisement, total fixation duration toward brands, non-fixation duration toward the advertisement, and non- fixation duration toward brands. Memory measures were advertisement recall, brand recall, advertisement recognition, and brand recognition. The results show that advertising creativity for familiar brands has a negative influence on brand affect and brand recognition. However, advertising creativity enhances visual attention for the advertisements of unfamiliar brands, and it also improves affect toward the ad, affect toward the brand and brand recognition for most situations. In addition, brand familiarity moderates the effect of creativity on ad recognition. Creativity enhanced ad recognition more for unfamiliar brands than familiar brands. And there were no significant effects of creativity on either ad or brand recall. The results also show that attention has a strong relationship with affect and memory. And attention itself was influenced by proactive competitive interference. However, competitive advertising interference has no significant effects on affect toward the ad. And there was negative effects of interference on affect toward the brand. The effects of competitive advertising interference on memory was positive in most conditions. Each paper provides implication and future research suggestions. And the thesis conclusion chapter includes implications and future research for both academic and practitioner research.
