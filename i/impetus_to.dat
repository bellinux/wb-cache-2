5|$|The poverty Henson {{had seen}} during his {{six months in}} Birkenhead gave him a strong <b>impetus</b> <b>to</b> {{minister}} to the poor. In 1887, after being ordained deacon, he {{took charge of the}} Oxford House Settlement, a high-church mission in Bethnal Green, a poor area of the East End of London. While in this post he honed his speaking skills in public debates with atheist orators, many from the National Secular Society's Bethnal Green office.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the cavalry}} had been {{successful}} in protecting the park, by 1914 the average soldier was not cutout for the strenuous, diplomatic and tedious nature of the work, and {{the high level of}} training related to cavalry skills. World War I added further <b>impetus</b> <b>to</b> a transition back to civilian management, to relieve the army of a duty that could be performed by civilian rangers. In July 1914, the 1st Cavalry was withdrawn from Yellowstone and replaced with a composite unit of 200 cavalrymen from throughout the army, many of whom had served in Yellowstone previously.|$|E

5|$|Beginning {{with the}} {{formation}} of the UN Environmental Programme (UNEP) in 1972, the UN has made environmental issues a prominent part of its agenda. A lack of success in the first two decades of UN work in this area led to the 1992 Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, which sought to give new <b>impetus</b> <b>to</b> these efforts. In 1988, the UNEP and the World Meteorological Organization (WMO), another UN organization, established the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, which assesses and reports on research on global warming. The UN-sponsored Kyoto Protocol, signed in 1997, set legally binding emissions reduction targets for ratifying states.|$|E
5|$|By {{the time}} a relief company, from the 1st Battalion of the Kumaon Regiment, reached Badgam, the {{position}} held by Sharma's company had been overrun. However, the 200 casualties suffered by the tribal infiltrators caused them to lose the <b>impetus</b> <b>to</b> advance. This bought time for Indian forces to fly into Srinagar airfield and block all routes of ingress to Srinagar itself. During the battle, along with Sharma, one junior commissioned officer and 20 other ranks of D company were killed. Sharma's body was recovered three days later. Though it was disfigured beyond recognition, his body was identified {{by means of the}} leather holster of his pistol and a few pages of Bhagavad Gita in his breast pocket.|$|E
5|$|During World War II, American bombers {{such as the}} Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress, Consolidated B-24 Liberator and Boeing B-29 Superfortress were {{protected}} by long-range escort fighters such as the Republic P-47 Thunderbolt and North American P-51 Mustang. These fighters could not match {{the range of the}} Northrop B-35 or Convair B-36, the next generation of bombers developed by the United States Army Air Forces (USAAF). The development cost for longer-ranged fighters was high, while aerial refueling was still considered risky and technologically difficult. Pilot fatigue had also been a problem during long fighter escort missions in Europe and the Pacific, giving further <b>impetus</b> <b>to</b> innovative approaches.|$|E

5|$|In 1961 Pracheachon's spokesperson, Non Suon, criticized Sihanouk {{for failing}} to tackle inflation, unemployment, and {{corruption}} in the country. Non Suon's criticisms gave Sihanouk the <b>impetus</b> <b>to</b> arrest Pracheachon leaders, and according to him, he had discovered plans by their party to monitor local political developments on behalf of foreign powers. In May 1962 Tou Samouth, Pracheachon's secretary-general, disappeared, and its ideological ally, the Communist Party of Kampuchea, suspected that Samouth had been secretly captured and killed by police. However, Sihanouk allowed Sangkum's left-wing politicians to run again in the 1962 general elections, which they all won. He even appointed two left-wing politicians, Hou Yuon and Khieu Samphan, as secretaries for planning and commerce, respectively, after the election.|$|E
5|$|In {{its first}} year the RNLI raised £10,000, however by 1849, income had dropped to £354. Finding itself in {{financial}} difficulties, the RNLI accepted a government subsidy of £2,000, which rose in subsequent years. This lasted until 1869, when the RNLI ceased accepting subsidies – it had found that voluntary donations had fallen by more than the subsidies; in addition, the government's imposition of bureaucracy and regulations were detrimental to the service. It was the loss of 27 lifeboat crew of Southport and St Annes in 1886 that gave new <b>impetus</b> <b>to</b> fundraising and an 1889 appeal raised £10,000. The first Lifeboat Saturday was held in that year.|$|E

The revolution is the turning point of modern Indonesian history, and it has provided the reference point and validation for the country’s major political trends that continue to the present day. It gave <b>impetus</b> <b>to</b> communism in the country, to militant nationalism, to Sukarno's 'guided democracy', to political Islam, {{the origins of the}} Indonesian army and its role in Indonesian power, the country's constitutional arrangements, and the centralism of power in Indonesia.|$|E

5|$|Shackleton {{returned}} from the Antarctic having narrowly failed to reach the Pole, and this gave Scott the <b>impetus</b> <b>to</b> proceed with plans for his second Antarctic expedition.

In December he was released on half-pay, to take up the full-time command of the British Antarctic Expedition 1910, {{to be known as the}} Terra Nova Expedition from its ship, Terra Nova.|$|E
5|$|The {{publication}} of Alfred Wegener's (1880–1930) theory of continental drift 1912 gave additional <b>impetus</b> <b>to</b> comparative physiology {{and the study}} of biogeography while ecology in the 1930s contributed the important ideas of plant community, succession, community change, and energy flows. From 1940 to 1950 ecology matured to become an independent discipline as Eugene Odum (1913–2002) formulated many of the concepts of ecosystem ecology, emphasising relationships between groups of organisms (especially material and energy relationships) as key factors in the field. Building on the extensive earlier work of Alphonse de Candolle, Nikolai Vavilov (1887–1943) from 1914 to 1940 produced accounts of the geography, centres of origin, and evolutionary history of economic plants.|$|E
5|$|Waddington was {{presented}} with a dilemma as both George Eastham and Peter Dobing retired {{not long after the}} club's League Cup win. Waddington responded by paying £240,000 to Chelsea for the services of Alan Hudson in early 1974. This was followed by Geoff Salmons' arrival from Sheffield United for £160,000, in the same year. Waddington later paid a world record fee for a goalkeeper, £325,000, to sign Peter Shilton from Leicester City. The new personnel brought added <b>impetus</b> <b>to</b> Waddington's side, and Stoke were close to winning the League title in 1974–75, but an end of season slump led to a fifth-place finish, four points off the champions, Derby.|$|E

5|$|A {{tropical}} wave {{moved off}} the coast of Africa on May 14, which {{is believed to have been}} the <b>impetus</b> <b>to</b> Barbara. The wave axis crossed Central America on May 25 and emerged into the eastern North Pacific Ocean the next day. Interacting with the Intertropical Convergence Zone, a broad surface low pressure area developed within the area on May 27, and as it drifted northward the system maintained limited and disorganized convection. On May 29, convection increased and became concentrated near the low pressure center, and banding features developed in its eastern semicircle as the circulation became better defined. It is estimated the system formed into Tropical Depression Two-E at 1800UTC on May 29 about 115miles (185km) southeast of Puerto Escondido, Oaxaca. Upon becoming a tropical cyclone, the depression was stationary in an area with warm sea surface temperatures, very light wind shear, and favorable upper-level conditions.|$|E
5|$|In 1521, the Portuguese {{allied with}} Hormuz and seized Bahrain from the Jabrid ruler Migrin ibn Zamil, {{who was killed}} during the takeover. Portuguese rule lasted for around 80 years, during which time they {{depended}} mainly on Sunni Persian governors. The Portuguese were expelled from the islands in 1602 by Abbas I of the Safavid dynasty of Persia, which gave <b>impetus</b> <b>to</b> Shia Islam. For the next two centuries, Persian rulers retained control of the archipelago, interrupted by the 1717 and 1738 invasions of the Ibadhis of Oman. During most of this period, they resorted to governing Bahrain indirectly, either through the city of Bushehr or through immigrant Sunni Arab clans. The latter were tribes returning to the Arabian side of the Persian Gulf from Persian territories in the north who were known as Huwala (literally: those that have changed or moved). In 1753, the Huwala clan of Nasr Al-Madhkur invaded Bahrain {{on behalf of the}} Iranian Zand leader Karim Khan Zand and restored direct Iranian rule.|$|E
5|$|In August 1940, a British mission, led by Tizard {{and with}} members that {{included}} Cockcroft, {{was sent to}} America to create relations and help advance the research towards war technology with the Americans. Several military technologies were shared, including advances in radar, antisubmarine warfare, aeronautical engineering and explosives. The American radar programme in particular was reinvigorated with an added <b>impetus</b> <b>to</b> the development of microwave radar and proximity fuses. This prompted the Americans to create the MIT Radiation Laboratory, which would later serve {{a model for the}} Los Alamos Laboratory. The mission did not spend much time on nuclear fission, with only two meetings of the subject, mainly about uranium enrichment. In particular, Cockcroft did not report Peierls' and Frisch's findings. Nonetheless, there were important repercussions. A barrier had been broken and a pathway to exchange technical information between the two countries was developed. Moreover, the notion of civilian scientists playing an important role of the development of military technologies was strengthened {{on both sides of the}} Atlantic.|$|E

Under ownership of the Mexican government, mining came to a near standstill. During this time Pachuca’s economy began to shift from mining to industry. The old Instituto Científico Literario Autónomo de Hidalgo was converted to the Universidad Autónoma del Estado in 1961, which would become one of the <b>impetuses</b> <b>to</b> the growth of the city in the following years, turning out as it did a better-educated and more technical workforce in areas such as law, engineering, business and medicine. In the late 1950s and through the 1960s, some growth was seen in the way of suburban developments for workers in newly built factories.|$|R
