500|$|Francesca died in 1992, aged two. Gunn {{played a}} match for Norwich against Queens Park Rangers at Carrow Road just days after his {{daughter}} died; he said of it, [...] "When <b>I</b> <b>ran</b> <b>out,</b> I thought, wow, I could feel the whole stadium was with me. I never thought about packing it in." [...] At {{the end of the}} season, Gunn won Norwich's Player of the Year award, as the club finished third in the Premiership, its highest ever league position.|$|E
500|$|This {{interpretation}} {{was similar}} to what Naomi Watts construed, when {{she said in an}} interview, [...] "I thought Diane was the real character and that Betty was the person she wanted to be and had dreamed up. Rita is the damsel in distress and she's in absolute need of Betty, and Betty controls {{her as if she were}} a doll. Rita is Betty's fantasy of who she wants Camilla to be." [...] Watts' own early experiences in Hollywood parallel those of Diane's. She endured some professional frustration before she became successful, auditioned for parts in which she did not believe, and encountered people who did not follow through with opportunities. She recalled, [...] "There were a lot of promises, but nothing actually came off. <b>I</b> <b>ran</b> <b>out</b> of money and became quite lonely." ...|$|E
500|$|... "The Wind Cries Mary" [...] is {{the first}} ballad {{recorded}} by the Experience; Hendrix wrote the lyrics after an argument with his girlfriend, Kathy Etchingham, whose middle name is Mary. She explained: [...] "I smashed plates on the floor, [...] he swept them up. He locked me in the bathroom for absolutely ages and... eventually Chas's girlfriend Lotta let me out... <b>I</b> <b>ran</b> <b>out</b> to get a taxi and was standing under the traffic lights, and I had red hair and a red dress. I went back after I'd cooled down and he'd already written it." [...] The song featured a chord progression inspired by Curtis Mayfield and lyrics that reflected Hendrix's admiration of Bob Dylan. [...] "Stone Free" [...] expressed Hendrix's desire to preserve his personal freedom, demurring the concepts of conformity and long-term relationships. He revisited this theme in [...] "51st Anniversary" [...] and [...] "Highway Chile". Omitted from the American version of the album, [...] "Red House" [...] would not see an official release in US until the 1969 compilation Smash Hits. An unusual feature of the recording {{is that it does}} not include a bass guitar track; Redding instead played rhythm guitar with his equalization set strongly in favor of bass tones. It is Hendrix's only original twelve-bar blues.|$|E

500|$|Watts {{then took}} a year off to travel, visiting Los Angeles and being {{introduced}} to agents through Kidman. Encouraged, Watts {{decided to move to}} America, to pursue her career further. In 1993 she had a small role in the John Goodman film Matinee and temporarily returned to Australia to star in three Australian films: another of Duigan's pictures, Wide Sargasso Sea; the drama The Custodian; and had her first leading role in the film Gross Misconduct, as a student who accuses one of her teachers (played by Jimmy Smits) of raping her. Watts then moved back to America for good but the difficulty of finding agents, producers and directors willing to hire her during that period frustrated her initial efforts. Though her financial situation never led her to taking a job out of the film industry, she experienced problems like being unable to pay the rent of her apartment and losing her medical insurance. [...] "At first, everything was fantastic and doors were opened to me. But some people who I met through Nicole , who had been all over me, had difficulty remembering my name when we next met. There were a lot of promises, but nothing actually came off. <b>I</b> <b>ran</b> <b>out</b> of money and became quite lonely, but Nic gave me company and encouragement to carry on." ...|$|E
2500|$|May {{spoke about}} this {{incident}} years later, saying, [...] "the first thing I knew I was being fired {{on from the}} rear ... all I could do was try to dodge my attacker. I noticed it was a red tri-plane, but if I realized it was Richthofen, I would have probably {{passed out on the}} spot. I kept on dodging and spinning, I imagine from about 12,000 feet until <b>I</b> <b>ran</b> <b>out</b> of sky and had to hedge hop over the ground. Richthofen was firing at me continually, [...] the only thing that saved me was my poor flying. I didn't know what I was doing myself and I do not suppose that Richthofen could figure out what I was going to do".|$|E
2500|$|Waldman was a shocked {{member of}} the crowd on the street that {{witnessed}} the catastrophic Triangle Waist Company fire of 1911, an event which clearly always remained with him and served {{as one of the}} landmarks of his life. Waldman described the grim scene in his 1944 memoirs: [...] One Saturday afternoon in March of that year — March 25, to be precise — I was sitting at one of the reading tables in the old Astor Library... It was a raw, unpleasant day and the comfortable reading room seemed a delightful place to spend the remaining few hours until the library closed. I was deeply engrossed in my book when I became aware of fire engines racing past the building. By this time I was sufficiently Americanized to be fascinated by the sound of fire engines. Along with several others in the library, <b>I</b> <b>ran</b> <b>out</b> to see what was happening, and followed crowds of people {{to the scene of the}} fire.|$|E

2500|$|In his statements, Goetz {{described}} his past mugging, {{in which he}} was injured and the only assailant arrested went unpunished. He called New York City [...] "lawless" [...] and expressed contempt for its justice system, calling it a [...] "joke," [...] a [...] "sham," [...] and [...] "a disgrace". Goetz said that when the four men he shot surrounded him on the train, he feared being [...] "beaten to a pulp" [...] as well as being robbed. He denied any premeditation for the shooting, something that had been speculated on by the press. Asked what his intentions were when he drew his revolver, Goetz replied, [...] "My intention was to murder them, to hurt them, to make them suffer as much as possible." [...] Later in the tape, Goetz said, [...] "If I had more bullets, I would have shot 'em all again and again. My problem was <b>I</b> <b>ran</b> <b>out</b> of bullets." [...] He added, [...] "I was gonna, I was gonna gouge one of the guys' [...] eyes out with my keys afterwards", but said he stopped when he saw the fear in his eyes. At the criminal trial, Goetz's defense attorneys, Barry Slotnick and Mark M. Baker, argued that this and other extreme statements by Goetz were the product of emotion and an overactive imagination.|$|E
2500|$|The cage {{giving way}} {{completely}} {{was a surprise}} to both Foley and The Undertaker. The Undertaker later said that he thought Foley was dead following the second fall. [...] Foley was genuinely knocked unconscious for a few moments from the impact, but was able to come around. Terry Funk wrote in his autobiography, [...] "Watching from the back, I thought he was dead. <b>I</b> <b>ran</b> <b>out</b> here and looked down at him, still lying in the ring where he'd landed. His eyes weren't rolled back in his head, but they looked totally glazed over, like a dead fish's eyes." [...] Foley later said that the only reason he survived the fall was because he did not take the chokeslam properly. In his memoir Have a Nice Day, Foley called it both the best and worst chokeslam he ever took, saying that despite its looks, he would have likely died if he had landed properly. He also cited the fact that the ring he landed in had a harder surface than the modern rings do, which stopped his momentum once he landed. Foley would later explain that the roof of the cell was supposed to sag sufficiently so that Undertaker could kick him through, allowing him to dangle by his feet and eventually fall in a rotation to land on his front.|$|E
2500|$|Clarkson often {{discusses}} {{high speed}} driving on public roads, criticising road safety campaigns involving cameras and speed bumps. In 2002, a Welsh Assembly Member Alun Pugh wrote to BBC director general Greg Dyke {{to complain about}} Clarkson's comments that he believed encouraged people to use Welsh roads as a high speed test track. A BBC spokesman said that suggestions Clarkson had encouraged speeding were [...] "nonsense". Clarkson has also made similar comments about driving in Lincolnshire. As of 2004 Clarkson was reported as having a clean licence. In a November 2005 Times article, Clarkson wrote on the Bugatti Veyron, [...] "On a recent drive across Europe I desperately wanted {{to reach the top}} speed but <b>I</b> <b>ran</b> <b>out</b> of road when the needle hit 240 mph," [...] and [...] "From the wheel of a Veyron, France {{is the size of a}} small coconut. I cannot tell you how fast I crossed it the other day. Because you simply wouldn't believe me." [...] In 2007, solicitor Nick Freeman represented Clarkson against a charge of driving at 86mph in a 50mph zone on the A40 road in London, defeating it on the basis that the driver of the car loaned to Clarkson from Alfa Romeo could not be ascertained. In 2008, Clarkson claimed in a talk at the Hay Festival to have been given a speeding ticket for driving at 186mph on the A1203 Limehouse Link road in London.|$|E

Doernberg also integrated more jazz and soul influences into the music. His third instrument, the trumpet, is also more in the focus than on the previous albums.|$|R
