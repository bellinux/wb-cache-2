25|$|SY Aurora was a barque-rigged steam yacht {{built by}} Alexander Stephen and Sons Ltd. in Dundee, Scotland, in 1876, for the Dundee Seal and Whale Fishing Company. It was 165' long with a 30' beam. The hull {{was made of}} oak, {{sheathed}} with <b>greenheart</b> and lined with fir. The bow was a mass of solid wood reinforced with steel-plate armour. The heavy side frames were braced by two levels of horizontal oak beams. Her primary use was whaling in the northern seas, and she was built sturdily enough to withstand the heavy weather and ice that would be encountered there. That strength proved useful for Antarctic exploration as well, and between 1911 and 1917 she made five trips to the continent, both for exploration as well as rescue missions.|$|E
25|$|The wood {{used for}} the {{planking}} varies depending on where in the ship it is laid and what structural purpose it serves: The inner layer is Scots pine while the 6-inch skin is made of pitch pine, Honduras mahogany or oak. The outer hull is made of English Elm and <b>Greenheart.</b> Oak beams run across the hull forming three decks - the lower deck beams are 11inches (27.9cm) square in cross-section and are placed less than three feet (0.9m) apart along the ship's length. Seven transverse bulkheads, also of wood, provide additional strength and ensured that any flooding caused by ice damage would not flood the entire ship. To prevent damage from ice floes or crushing the two-blade propeller could be hoisted {{out of the way}} and the rudder could be easily detached and stored aboard. Iron-shod bows were severely raked so that when ramming the ice they would ride up over the margin and crush the ice with deadweight. The coal bunkers on each side contained a steel tank, each of which could hold 60 tons of fresh water. On the long ocean trip to and from New Zealand these tanks could hold additional coal but for the Antarctic voyage the extra water capacity was more important. The metal tanks also contributed to the strength of the lower hull around the boiler and engine spaces.|$|E
500|$|Nansen {{wanted the}} ship in one year; {{he was eager to}} get away before anyone else could adopt his ideas and {{forestall}} him. [...] The ship's most significant external feature was the roundness of the hull, designed so that there was nothing upon which the ice could get a grip. Bow, stern and keel were rounded off, and the sides smoothed so that, in Nansen's words, the vessel would [...] "slip like an eel out of the embraces of the ice". [...] To give exceptional strength the hull was sheathed in South American <b>greenheart,</b> the hardest timber available. The three layers of wood forming the hull provided a combined thickness of between 24 and 28inches (60–70cm), increasing to around 48inches (1.25metres) at the bow, which was further protected by a protruding iron stem. Added strength was provided by crossbeams and braces throughout the length of the hull.|$|E

500|$|Amundsen {{consulted}} Nansen, {{who insisted}} that Fram was the only vessel fit for such an undertaking. Fram had been designed and built in 1891–93 by Colin Archer, Norway's leading shipbuilder and naval architect, in accordance with Nansen's exacting specifications, as a vessel that would withstand prolonged exposure to the harshest of Arctic conditions. The ship's most distinctive feature was its rounded hull which, according to Nansen, enabled the vessel to [...] "slip like an eel out of the embraces of the ice". For extra strength the hull was sheathed in South American <b>greenheart,</b> the hardest timber available, and crossbeams and braces were fitted throughout its length. The ship's wide beam of [...] in relation to its overall length of [...] gave it a markedly stubby appearance. This shape improved its strength in the ice but affected its performance in the open sea, where it moved sluggishly and was inclined to roll most uncomfortably. However, its looks, speed, and sailing qualities were secondary to the provision of a secure and warm shelter for the crew during a voyage that might extend over several years.|$|E
2500|$|Patria {{was built}} by Christian Brinch Jørgensen at Svelvik, Norway. She was built as a whaler. The ship was {{constructed}} of Pine, American Pine and Oak ribs, with [...] thick <b>Greenheart</b> planks clad in oak and sheeted in Iron. The ship had a strengthened bow to enable her to operate in ice. [...] Her designer and owner was Johan Christian Jakobsen.|$|E
2500|$|According to EFTA, the {{defining}} characteristic of alternative trading organizations is that of equal partnership and respect – partnership between the developing region producers and importers, shops, labelling organizations, and consumers. Alternative trade [...] "humanizes" [...] the trade process – making the producer-consumer chain as short as possible so that consumers {{become aware of the}} culture, identity, and conditions in which producers live. All actors are committed to the principle of alternative trade, the need for advocacy in their working relations and the importance of awareness-raising and advocacy work. Examples of such organisations are Ten Thousand Villages, <b>Greenheart</b> Shop, Equal Exchange and SERRV International in the US and Equal Exchange Trading, Traidcraft, Oxfam Trading, Twin Trading and Alter Eco in Europe as well as Siem Fair Trade Fashion in Australia.|$|E
2500|$|The {{ship was}} {{launched}} on 17 December 1912 and was initially christened Polaris (eponymous with Polaris, the North Star). She was [...] long, with a [...] beam and measured 348 tons gross. Though her black hull looked {{from the outside}} like {{that of any other}} vessel of a comparable size, it was not. She was designed for polar conditions with a very sturdy construction. Her keel members were four pieces of solid oak, one above the other, adding up to a thickness of , while its sides were between [...] and [...] thick, with twice as many frames as normal and the frames being of double thickness. She was built of planks of oak and Norwegian fir up to [...] thick, sheathed in <b>greenheart,</b> a notably strong and heavy wood. The bow, which would meet the ice head-on, had been given special attention. Each timber had been made from a single oak tree chosen for its shape so that its natural shape followed the curve of the ship's design. When put together, these pieces had a thickness of [...]|$|E
60|$|Few of us, I think, had {{a correct}} {{idea of the}} {{popularity}} of archery in our midst until {{the subject of a}} club was broached. Then we all perceived what a strong interest we felt in the study and use of the bow and arrow. The club was formed immediately, and our thirty members began to discuss the relative merits of lancewood, yew, and <b>greenheart</b> bows, and to survey yards and lawns for suitable spots for setting up targets for home practice.|$|E
60|$|I envied {{them not}} their wings: {{at that moment}} earth did not seem fixed and solid beneath me, nor I bound by gravity to it. The faint, {{floating}} clouds, the blue infinite heaven itself, seemed not more ethereal and free than I, or the ground I walked on. The low, stony hills on my right hand, of which I caught occasional glimpses through the trees, looking now blue and delicate in the level rays, {{were no more than}} the billowy projections on the moving cloud of earth: the trees of unnumbered kinds--great more, cecropia, and <b>greenheart,</b> bush and fern and suspended lianas, and tall palms balancing their feathery foliage on slender stems--all was but a fantastic mist embroidery covering the surface of that floating cloud on which my feet were set, and which floated with me near the sun.|$|E
6000|$|We arrived after a {{while at}} Valencia, a {{scattered}} hamlet in the woods, with a good shop or 'store' upon a village green, under the verandah whereof lay, {{side by side with}} bottled ale and biscuit tins, bags of Carapo {265} nuts; trapezoidal brown nuts--enclosed originally in a round fruit--which ought some day to form a valuable article of export. Their bitter anthelminthic oil is said to have medicinal uses; but it will be still more useful for machinery, as it has--like that curious flat gourd the Sequa {266a}--the property of keeping iron from rust. The tree itself, common here and in Guiana, is one of the true Forest Giants; we saw many a noble specimen of it in our rides. Its timber is tough, not over heavy, and extensively used already in the island; while its bark is a febrifuge and tonic. In fact it possesses all those qualities which make its brethren, the Meliaceae, valuable throughout the Tropics. [...] But {{it is not the only}} tree of South America whose bark may be used as a substitute for quinine. They may be counted possibly by dozens. A glance at the excellent enumerations of the uses of vegetable products to be found in Lindley's Vegetable Kingdom (a monument of learning) will show how God provides, how man neglects and wastes. As a single instance, the Laurels alone are known already to contain several valuable febrifuges, among which the Demerara <b>Greenheart,</b> or Bibiri, {266b} claims perhaps the highest rank. 'Dr. Maclagan has shown,' says Dr. Lindley, 'that sulphate of Bibiri acts with rapid and complete success in arresting ague.' [...] This tree spreads from Jamaica to the Spanish Main. It is plentiful in Trinidad; still more plentiful in Guiana; and yet all of it which reaches Europe is a little of its hard beautiful wood for the use of cabinetmakers; while in Demerara, I am assured by an eye-witness, many tons of this precious <b>Greenheart</b> bark are thrown away year by year. So goes the world; and man meanwhile at once boasts of his civilisation, and complains of the niggardliness of Nature.|$|E
6000|$|... "No," [...] assented the stranger, {{with a wink}} at me. [...] "The Apses didn't {{believe in}} them either, apparently. They treated their people well--as people don't get treated nowadays, and they were awfully proud of their ships. Nothing ever {{happened}} to them. This last one, the Apse Family, was {{to be like the}} others, only she was to be still stronger, still safer, still more roomy and comfortable. I believe they meant her to last for ever. They had her built composite--iron, teak-wood, and <b>greenheart,</b> and her scantling was something fabulous. If ever an order was given for a ship in a spirit of pride this one was. Everything of the best. The commodore captain of the employ was to command her, and they planned the accommodation for him like a house on shore under a big, tall poop that went nearly to the mainmast. No wonder Mrs. Colchester wouldn't let the old man give her up. Why, it was the best home she ever had in all her married days. She had a nerve, that woman.|$|E
60|$|In this {{direction}} I had been pushing resolutely on for over half an hour, finding it no easy matter {{to make my}} way without constantly deviating to this side or that from the course I wished to keep, when I came to a much more open spot. The trees were smaller and scantier here, owing to the rocky nature of the ground, which sloped rather rapidly down; but it was moist and overgrown with mosses, ferns, creepers, and low shrubs, all of the liveliest green. I could not see many yards ahead owing to the bushes and tall fern fronds; but presently I began to hear a low, continuous sound, which, when I had advanced twenty or thirty yards further, I made {{out to be the}} gurgling of running water; and at the same moment I made the discovery that my throat was parched and my palms tingling with heat. I hurried on, promising myself a cool draught, when all at once, above the soft dashing and gurgling of the water, I caught yet another sound--a low, warbling note, or succession of notes, which might have been emitted by a bird. But it startled me nevertheless--bird-like warbling sounds had come to mean so much to me--and pausing, I listened intently. It was not repeated, and finally, treading with the utmost caution so as not to alarm the mysterious vocalist, I crept on until, coming to a <b>greenheart</b> with a quantity of feathery foliage of a shrub growing about its roots, I saw that just beyond the tree the ground was more open still, letting in the sunlight from above, and that the channel of the stream I sought was in this open space, about twenty yards from me, although the water was still hidden from sight. Something else was there, which I did see; instantly my cautious advance was arrested. I stood gazing with concentrated vision, scarcely daring to breathe lest I should scare it away.|$|E
