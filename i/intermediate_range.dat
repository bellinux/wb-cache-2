5|$|His {{research}} and educational leadership brought him great laurels and prestige in the 1980s, which prompted {{the government to}} initiate an advanced missile programme under his directorship. Kalam and Dr V S Arunachalam, metallurgist and scientific adviser to the Defence Minister, worked on the suggestion by the then Defence Minister, R. Venkataraman on a proposal for simultaneous development of a quiver of missiles instead of taking planned missiles one after another. R Venkatraman was instrumental in getting the cabinet approval for allocating 388 crores for the mission, named Integrated Guided Missile Development Programme (IGMDP) and appointed Kalam as the chief executive. Kalam played a major part in developing many missiles under the mission including Agni, an <b>intermediate</b> <b>range</b> ballistic missile and Prithvi, the tactical surface-to-surface missile, although the projects have been criticised for mismanagement and cost and time overruns.|$|E
5|$|Project E {{nuclear warheads}} {{were also used}} on the sixty Thor <b>Intermediate</b> <b>Range</b> Ballistic Missiles which were {{operated}} by the RAF from 1959 to 1963 under Project Emily. The British Army acquired Project E warheads for its Corporal missiles in 1958. The United States subsequently offered the Honest John missile as an interim replacement, and it remained in service until 1977, when it was in turn superseded by the Lance missile. Eight-inch and 155mm nuclear artillery rounds were also acquired under Project E. A maritime version of Project E known as Project N provided nuclear depth bombs used by the RAF Coastal Command. The last Project E weapons were withdrawn from service in 1992.|$|E
5|$|In 1953, the US Secretary of Defense, Charles E. Wilson, {{raised the}} {{possibility}} of a joint ballistic missile programme with the Minister of Supply, Duncan Sandys. This resulted in an agreement on collaboration being signed on 12 August 1954, and a British Medium Range Ballistic Missile (MRBM) development project codenamed Blue Streak. The United States pursued <b>Intermediate</b> <b>Range</b> Ballistic Missile (IRBM) development in parallel. Indeed, it had two IRBM projects: the US Army's Jupiter and the USAF's Thor. When Sandys, now the Minister of Defence, visited the United States in January 1957, he found the Americans anxious to deploy IRBMs in Britain. Macmillan and Eisenhower agreed to do so during their summit in Bermuda in March 1957, and a formal agreement was drawn up on 17 December 1957, although {{it was not until the}} end of the month that it was definitely determined that Britain would receive Thor and not Jupiter missiles. The deployment was codenamed Project Emily.|$|E
40|$|The <b>intermediate</b> {{pressure}} <b>range</b> {{stands for}} an important condition for ultrafiltration operations where permeate flux falls below that predicted from a linear flux-pressure relationship {{but does not}} reach the limiting flux. Optimal performance of ultrafiltration might be achieved on {{the upper end of}} the <b>intermediate</b> pressure <b>range</b> because the maximum permeate flux will be obtained at the lowest possible pressure.

5|$|In 1955, von Neumann {{became a}} {{commissioner}} of the AEC. He accepted this position {{and used it to}} further the production of compact hydrogen bombs suitable for Intercontinental ballistic missile delivery. He involved himself in correcting the severe shortage of tritium and lithium 6 needed for these compact weapons, and he argued against settling for the <b>intermediate</b> <b>range</b> missiles that the Army wanted. He was adamant that H-bombs delivered into the heart of enemy territory by an ICBM would be the most effective weapon possible, and that the relative inaccuracy of the missile wouldn't be a problem with an H-bomb. He said the Russians would probably be building a similar weapon system, {{which turned out to be}} the case. Despite his disagreement with Oppenheimer over the need for a crash program to develop the hydrogen bomb, he testified on the latter's behalf at the 1954 Oppenheimer security hearing, at which he asserted that Oppenheimer was loyal, and praised him for his helpfulness once the program went ahead.|$|E

40|$|International audienceThe <b>intermediate</b> {{frequency}} <b>range</b> 10 2 – 10 5 Hz {{forms the}} transition range between the spectral induced polarization frequency domain and the dielectric spectroscopy frequency domain.

25|$|Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD), {{formerly}} Theater High Altitude Area Defense, is an American {{anti-ballistic missile}} defense system designed to shoot down short, medium, and <b>intermediate</b> <b>range</b> ballistic missiles in their terminal phase (descent or reentry) by intercepting with a hit-to-kill approach. THAAD was developed after the experience of Iraq's Scud missile attacks during the Gulf War in 1991. The THAAD interceptor carries no warhead, but relies on its kinetic energy of impact to destroy the incoming missile. A kinetic energy hit minimizes the risk of exploding conventional warhead ballistic missiles, and the warhead of nuclear tipped ballistic missiles will not detonate on a kinetic energy hit.|$|E

25|$|The October 1956 Suez crisis brought {{relations}} between Britain and the United States {{to a low}} ebb. When Eisenhower met with the new Prime Minister, Harold Macmillan, in Bermuda in March 1957, he {{raised the possibility of}} basing US <b>intermediate</b> <b>range</b> ballistic missile (IRBM) systems in the UK. This came to be called Project Emily. There were also discussions on exchanging nuclear submarine propulsion technology for information on the British Calder Hall nuclear power plant, allowing the United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority to purchase uranium ore from Canada, and coordinating the war plans of RAF Bomber Command with those of the Strategic Air Command. Although the IRBM negotiations pre-dated the Suez crisis, it suited the British government to tout the IRBM deal as a demonstration that the rift had been healed. Britain tested its first hydrogen bomb in the Operation Grapple test at Christmas Island on 15 May 1957. The Grapple tests were facilitated by the United States, which also claimed the island. Although the initial tests were unsuccessful, the Grapple X test on 8 November 1957 achieved the desired result.|$|E

500|$|In {{parallel}} to the ICBM programme, the United States developed three separate <b>intermediate</b> <b>range</b> ballistic missile (IRBM) systems. On 8 November 1955, Wilson approved IRBM projects by both the United States Army and the United States Air Force (USAF). The United States National Security Council gave the ICBM and IRBM projects the highest national priority. The Army Ballistic Missile Agency, commanded by Major General John B. Medaris, with Wernher von Braun as its technical director, developed the Jupiter (SM-78) IRBM. After three failures, its first successful flight {{took place at the}} Cape Canaveral Air Force Station on 31 May 1957. The United States Navy initially participated in the Jupiter programme, intending to launch the missiles from ships, but in view of their size, decided instead to develop [...] a smaller, solid-propellant IRBM that could be launched from a submarine, which became Polaris. Despite reluctance on the part of Major General Bernard Schriever, the commander of the USAF Western Development Division, to take on IRBM development, and a pronounced lack of enthusiasm for missiles among senior USAF [...] officers, who preferred manned bombers, the rival USAF project moved quickly. The Douglas Aircraft Company was awarded the contract {{for the development of the}} missile, which was codenamed Thor (SM-75), in December 1955. Rocketdyne, Ramo-Wooldridge, AC Spark Plug, Bell Laboratories and General Electric were engaged as the subcontractors for the rocket engine, technical coordination, inertial guidance system, radio guidance system, and re-entry vehicle respectively.

500|$|On 11 March 1943, the Cabinet of the United Kingdom {{formed the}} Brabazon Committee to {{determine}} the UK's airliner needs after {{the conclusion of the}} Second World War. One of its recommendations was for a pressurised, transatlantic mailplane that could carry non-stop, one long ton (1.0 t) of payload at a cruising speed of 400mph (640km/h). De Havilland chose to challenge the widely held scepticism of jet engines as too fuel-hungry and unreliable, So committee member Sir Geoffrey de Havilland, head of the de Havilland company, used his personal influence and his company's expertise to champion the development of a jet propelled aircraft; and proposed a specification for a pure turbojet-powered design. The committee accepted the proposal, calling it the [...] "Type IV" [...] (of five designs), and awarded a development and production contract to de Havilland under the designation Type 106 in February 1945. The type and design were to be so advanced that De Havilland had to undertake the design and development of both the airframe and the engines. This was because in 1945 no turbojet engine manufacturer in the world was drawing up a design specification for an engine with the thrust and specific fuel consumption, that could power an aircraft at the proposed cruising altitude (40 thousand feet), speed, and transatlantic range as was called for by the Type 106. First-phase development of the DH 106 focused on short and <b>intermediate</b> <b>range</b> mailplanes with a small passenger compartment and as few as six seats, before being redefined as a long-range airliner with a capacity of 24 seats. Out of all the Brabazon designs, the DH 106 was seen as the riskiest both in terms of introducing untried design elements and for the financial commitment involved. Nevertheless, the British Overseas Airways Corporation (BOAC) found the Type IV's specifications attractive, and initially proposed a purchase of 25 aircraft; in December 1945, when a firm contract was laid out, the order total was revised to 10.|$|E
