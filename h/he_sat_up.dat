25|$|Before {{he could}} be ordained a priest, Gabriel died in the retreat at Isola del Gran Sasso {{the early hours of}} February 27, 1862, in the {{presence}} of the community, holding close an image of Our Lady of Sorrows and smiling peacefully. Those who were with Gabriel when he died reported that at the moment of death, <b>he</b> <b>sat</b> <b>up</b> in bed and his face became radiant as he reached out to an otherwise unseen figure that was entering the room. It was the opinion of Father Norbert that Saint Gabriel had seen the Virgin Mary at the very moment of his death.|$|E
25|$|At about 11:45pm ship's time Gracie was jarred awake by a jolt. <b>He</b> <b>sat</b> <b>up,</b> {{realized}} the ship's engines {{were no longer}} moving, and partially dressed, putting on a Norfolk jacket over his regular clothes. Reaching the Boat Deck, he {{realized the}} ship was listing slightly. He returned to his cabin {{to put on his}} life jacket and on the way back found the women he had been chaperoning. He escorted them up to the Boat Deck and made sure they entered lifeboats. He then retrieved blankets for the women in the boats, and along with his friend Smith assisted Second Officer Charles Lightoller in filling the remaining lifeboats with women and children.|$|E
500|$|The first {{breakaway}} of the {{day came}} from Jonathan Hivert (...) [...] He attacked alone and took both the mountains points and the victory at the first intermediate sprint. Despite at one point having a lead of nearly four minutes, <b>he</b> <b>sat</b> <b>up</b> and was caught by the peloton. Michael Matthews (...) , in eighth place after the prologue, took {{second place in the}} intermediate sprint to win two bonus seconds, moving him to ten seconds behind Kwiatkowski, while John Degenkolb (...) took a second for finishing third.|$|E

6000|$|... "He wasn’t like hisself {{that night}} {{up at the}} Cauliflower. <b>’E</b> <b>sat</b> <b>up</b> {{in the corner and}} wouldn’t take any notice of anybody, and {{it was easy to see}} as he was {{thoroughly}} ashamed of hisself.|$|R
60|$|He put his 'and {{in under}} the bed-clo'es and felt {{all up and down}} Sam's back, very careful. Sam stood it for 'arf a minute, and then <b>'e</b> <b>sat</b> <b>up</b> in bed and behaved more like a {{windmill}} than a man.|$|R
500|$|On 9 January 1884 Carmen {{was given}} its first New York Metropolitan Opera performance, to a mixed {{critical}} reception. The New York Times welcomed Bizet's [...] "pretty and effective work", but compared Zelia Trebelli's {{interpretation of the}} title role unfavourably with that of Minnie Hauk. Thereafter Carmen was quickly incorporated into the Met's regular repertory. In February 1906 Enrico Caruso sang José at the Met for the first time; he continued to perform in this role until 1919, two years before his death. On 17 April 1906, on tour with the Met, he sang the role at the Grand Opera House in San Francisco. Afterwards <b>he</b> <b>sat</b> <b>up</b> until 3 am reading the reviews in the early editions of the following day's papers. Two hours later he was awakened by the first violent shocks of the 1906 San Francisco earthquake, after which {{he and his fellow}} performers made a hurried escape from the Palace Hotel.|$|E
500|$|On 28 July 1937, at {{the evening}} performance, Davidson gave his usual speech before {{entering}} the cage in which two lions, Freddie and Toto, were sitting quietly. Then, according to Blythe: [...] "in scarcely credible terms, the little clergyman from Norfolk and the lion acted out the classical Christian martyrdom to the full". Eyewitnesses later reported that after Davidson had cracked his whip and shouted, Freddie became agitated and knocked Davidson over, before seizing him by the neck and running with him around the cage. Somner struggled to pacify the snarling Freddie, who eventually dropped the unconscious Davidson, enabling her to drag him to safety; he was badly gashed, and had suffered a broken bone in his neck. [...] An uncorroborated story circulated that {{while waiting for the}} ambulance, Davidson asked that the London newspapers be alerted in time for next day's first editions. According to some press reports <b>he</b> <b>sat</b> <b>up</b> in hospital and asked visitors for their impressions of his ordeal in the cage. Most historians of the affair, however, believe that Davidson never recovered consciousness. He died on 30 July, his death possibly hastened by an insulin injection administered by a doctor who believed that Davidson was a diabetic. The coroner's verdict was death by misadventure.|$|E
500|$|Marie became {{seriously ill}} on 15 November, and Alice {{was called to}} her bedside, {{but by the time}} she arrived, Marie had choked to death. A distraught Alice wrote to Queen Victoria that the [...] "pain is beyond words". Alice kept the news of Marie's death secret from her {{children}} for several weeks, but she finally told Ernest in early December. His reaction was even worse than she had anticipated; at first he refused to believe it. As <b>he</b> <b>sat</b> <b>up</b> crying, Alice broke her rule about physical contact with the ill and gave him a kiss. At first, however, Alice did not fall ill. She met her sister Victoria as the latter was passing through Darmstadt on the way to England, and wrote to her mother with [...] "a hint of resumed cheerfulness" [...] on the same day. However, by Saturday, 14 December, the anniversary of her father's death, she became seriously ill with the diphtheria caught from her son. Her last words were [...] "dear Papa", and she fell unconscious at 2:30am. Just after 8:30am, she died. Alice was buried on 18 December 1878 at the Grand Ducal mausoleum at Rosenhöhe outside Darmstadt, with the Union Flag draped over her coffin. A special monument of Alice and her daughter Marie was erected there by Joseph Boehm.|$|E

6000|$|... "He come {{round at}} last, and with nothing {{stronger}} than water, which Mrs. Smith kept pouring into ’is mouth. First thing we noticed {{was that the}} smile went, then ’is eyes opened, and suddenly <b>’e</b> <b>sat</b> <b>up</b> with a shiver and gave such a dreadful scream that we thought at first the tiger {{was on top of}} us.|$|R
60|$|She rose in her eagerness. <b>He</b> <b>sat</b> turning <b>up</b> {{his face}} to her. She could not {{understand}} his expression.|$|R
2500|$|Lord Beveridge married Jessy Janet, {{daughter}} of William Philip and widow of David Mair, in 1942. He died {{at his home}} on 16 March 1963, aged 84, and was buried in Thockrington churchyard, on the Northumbrian moors. His barony became extinct upon his death. His last words, as <b>he</b> <b>sat</b> <b>up</b> in bed whilst still working on his 'History of Prices', were [...] "I have a thousand things to do".|$|E
2500|$|After graduating with {{distinction}} in 1936, {{his plans to}} travel to Vienna to study conducting for a year under Felix Weingartner were delayed by his being called up for National Service. [...] Panufnik recalled how, {{on the night before}} his medical, he heard the national Polish medieval chant Bogurodzica on the wireless. [...] This entirely captivated him, and <b>he</b> <b>sat</b> <b>up</b> late into the night drinking copious quantities of black coffee. [...] The result of this was that he failed his medical examination and was excused from military duties. [...] Instead he used the year's hiatus earning money and reputation composing film music.|$|E
2500|$|The {{eleventh}} {{match of}} the event was the encounter between The Undertaker and Kane. After Kane made his entrance, he was seen looking toward the entrance ramp saying, [...] "You're not coming back tonight. You're not coming back, I buried you alive." [...] After this, {{the lights in the}} arena went out and Paul Bearer, Undertaker's former manager and Kane's (storyline) father, was heard screaming [...] "oh yes!". Blue light began to fill the arena as Bearer, carrying the Undertaker's former trademark urn, led a group of Druids, all chanting and carrying torches, onto the entrance ramp. As the Druids made a formation {{at the top of the}} ramp, Bearer walked to ringside, turned and said to Kane, [...] "my son...you're no son of mine." [...] He then turned back to face the entryway and raised the urn to summon The Undertaker. As Kane continued to watch in the ring, refusing to believe his brother was back, Undertaker entered the arena in his [...] "Deadman" [...] persona, wearing a long black trenchcoat and hat, and walked through the Druid formation. Bearer met him at ringside and directed him to the ring steps, where Undertaker raised his arms to bring the arena lights back up. Before the match officially got underway, a now visibly shaken and distressed Kane began shouting at his brother repeatedly, saying things like [...] "I killed you!", [...] "I buried you alive!", and [...] "you're not real!", while Undertaker simply stood staring stoically at Kane. Eventually, Kane decided to see if Undertaker was indeed standing in front of him by slowly inching forward with his hand outstretched. Undertaker responded by punching Kane, knocking him down, and the match got underway. The two continued brawling until Kane delivered a Chokeslam to Undertaker, which <b>he</b> <b>sat</b> <b>up</b> from shortly afterward while Kane was taunting Paul Bearer. The Undertaker then retaliated with a Chokeslam and Tombstone piledriver to win the match and remaining undefeated at WrestleMania with a 12–0 record.|$|E
60|$|But Charlie Tagg 'ad {{got better}} things to do than to dream, and <b>'e</b> <b>sat</b> <b>up</b> in bed arf the night {{thinking}} out a new plan he'd thought of to get that money. When 'e did fall asleep at last 'e dreamt of taking a little farm in Australia and riding about on 'orseback with the Sydney gal watching his men at work.|$|R
60|$|So Kennedy, {{rising at}} {{the call of}} time from the bed on which <b>he</b> <b>sat,</b> came <b>up</b> to the scratch warily.|$|R
6000|$|... “I’m all right—all right,” Morgan panted to Pemberton, whom <b>he</b> <b>sat</b> looking <b>up</b> at with {{a strange}} smile, his hands resting {{on either side of}} the sofa.|$|R
60|$|He turned over, but I {{punched him}} {{persistently}} until <b>he</b> <b>sat</b> <b>up.</b>|$|E
60|$|Stillwell {{made some}} {{incoherent}} sound as <b>he</b> <b>sat</b> <b>up</b> fascinated, quite beside himself.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>sat</b> <b>up,</b> blindly. Even {{he did not}} {{guess the}} agony in her heart.|$|E
60|$|With a groan {{the injured}} man {{turned on his}} side. Then <b>he</b> slowly <b>sat</b> <b>up</b> and passed his wet hand over his face. Finally, he {{staggered}} to his feet.|$|R
6000|$|In the evening, {{putting her}} cheek against her brother's {{shoulder}} {{as she was}} sitting by him, while <b>he</b> <b>sat</b> propped <b>up</b> in bed under a new difficulty of breathing, she said-- ...|$|R
60|$|Giuseppi ceased rowing, and, {{throwing}} {{himself down}} {{at the bottom of the}} gondola, began to sob violently, with the abandonment to his emotions common to his race. Then <b>he</b> suddenly <b>sat</b> <b>up.</b>|$|R
60|$|Richard was {{suddenly}} tense. <b>He</b> <b>sat</b> <b>up,</b> and his foot {{reached for the}} self-starter.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>sat</b> <b>up,</b> and, fixing {{abruptly}} {{his eyes}} on Babalatchi, tapped his own forehead significantly.|$|E
60|$|At this <b>he</b> <b>sat</b> <b>up</b> very straight, on {{the extreme}} edge of his chair; his eyes sparkled.|$|E
6000|$|She {{took her}} {{faithful}} place beside him, fanning him and cooling his forehead; {{and he seemed}} to be falling asleep (always with the money in his hand), when <b>he</b> unexpectedly <b>sat</b> <b>up</b> and said: ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Are you suffering, father?" [...] I asked, almost fearfully. At {{the sound}} of my voice, <b>he</b> {{suddenly}} <b>sat</b> <b>up,</b> and there was a great fear in his eyes. Then he fell back again with a cry.|$|R
60|$|Coulthurst, {{who could}} not see the door from where <b>he</b> <b>sat,</b> looked <b>up</b> from his book for just a moment, and did not appear to notice that Tomlinson was no longer in front of him.|$|R
60|$|For a {{long time}} <b>he</b> <b>sat</b> <b>up</b> in the great bed with his arms about his knees.|$|E
60|$|The {{young man}} {{threw himself into}} a chair. Suddenly <b>he</b> <b>sat</b> <b>up</b> again, and {{addressed}} the Baroness.|$|E
60|$|Then came another growl or grunt, {{he could}} not tell which. <b>He</b> <b>sat</b> <b>up</b> and looked outside.|$|E
60|$|There {{was no more}} slumber for me that night, and {{in order}} to keep awake I sat bolt upright. This evidently did not please my companion, for {{presently}} <b>he</b> too <b>sat</b> <b>up</b> and looked at me sharply.|$|R
60|$|Finding that {{he could}} not see us very well from where <b>he</b> <b>sat,</b> <b>he</b> got <b>up,</b> and threw one leg over {{the back of a chair}} and leaned upon it; thus having one foot on the seat of the chair, and one foot on the ground.|$|R
60|$|In {{the morning}} he filled in the form for his {{season-ticket}} {{and took it to}} the station. When he got back, his mother was just beginning to wash the floor. <b>He</b> <b>sat</b> crouched <b>up</b> on the sofa.|$|R
