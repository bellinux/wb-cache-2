40|$|The post-reionization {{thermal state}} of the intergalactic medium is {{characterized}} by a power-law relationship between temperature and density, with a slope determined by the parameter γ. We describe a new method to measure γ using the ratio of flux curvature in the Lyman α and β forests. At a given redshift, this curvature ratio incorporates information from the different gas densities traced by Lyman α and β absorption. It is relatively simple and fast to compute and appears robust against several observational uncertainties. We apply this technique to a sample of 27 high-resolution quasar spectra from the Very Large Telescope. While promising statistical errors on γ appear to be achievable with these spectra, to reach its full potential, the dependence of the curvature ratio on the thermal {{state of the}} gas in the foreground Lyman α forest will require further, <b>detailed</b> <b>forward</b> modelling...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, {{spectral}} decomposition techniques {{are applied to}} deepwater seismic data from Gulf of Mexico to examine the gas associated spectral anomalies. In the first case, thick gas sand with nearly constant P-impedance is encased in shale with non-symmetric P-impedance, and gas reservoir are bright at low-frequency iso-frequency sections; Commercial gas sand and low-gas saturated sand also show apparently different spectral characteristics. In the second case, gas reservoir includes two consecutive up-fining sand intervals with gradually changed P-impedance in each sand interval. Spectral anomalies of gas sand occur at high-frequency iso-frequency sections. <b>Detailed</b> <b>forward</b> modeling is analyzed to help understand the underlying physical mechanisms. Reservoir thickness and P-impedance structure are the first order factors to control the {{spectral decomposition}} responses of the above two gas reservoirs.

40|$|Despite {{enormous}} {{strides in}} our knowledge about quality health services, and the continuously {{growing interest in}} the safety of patients among policy makers and clinical leaders, much remains to be done to avoid unintentionally harm occurring in health care. In May 2004, the Fifty-seventh World Health Assembly supported the creation of the World Alliance for Patient Safety which aims to coordinate, spread and accelerate improvements in patient safety worldwide. The <b>Forward</b> <b>Programme</b> 2005 of the World Alliance for Patient safety sets out an important and comprehensive programme of international work in areas such as reporting and learning, patient involvement and safety solutions. The experience of other high risk industries, suggests that patient safety problems are primarily a function of deficiencies in system design, organization and operation. Understanding and improving the design of processes, structures and culture of health care delivery is therefore central to making care safer. A number of core challenges emerge across many European countries including the need to continue to build strong political will and commitment to address patient safety problems, stronger engagement and leadership from health care professionals, and promoting positive cultural changes with health care...|$|R
40|$|The {{analysis}} of high-field RF fieldtissue interactions requires high-performance finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) computing. Conventional CPU-based FDTD calculations offer limited computing {{performance in a}} PC environment. This study presents a graphics processing unit (GPU) -based parallel-computing framework, producing substantially boosted computing efficiency (with a two-order speedup factor) at a PC-level cost. Specific details of implementing the FDTD method on a GPU architecture have been presented and the new computational strategy has been successfully applied {{to the design of}} a novel 8 -element transceive RF coil system at 9. 4 T. Facilitated by the powerful GPU-FDTD computing, the new RF coil array offers optimized fields (averaging 25 improvement in sensitivity, and 20 reduction in loop coupling compared with conventional array structures of the same size) for small animal imaging with a robust RF configuration. The GPU-enabled acceleration paves the way for FDTD to be applied for both <b>detailed</b> <b>forward</b> modeling and inverse design of MRI coils, which were previously impractical...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment space gravity mission {{provides}} one of {{the principal}} means of estimating present-day mass loss occurring in polar regions. Extraction of the mass loss signal from the observed gravity changes is complicated by the need to first remove the signal of ongoing glacial isostatic adjustment (GIA) since the Last Glacial Maximum. This can be problematic in regions such as Antarctica where the GIA models are poorly constrained by observation and their accuracy is not well known. We present a new methodology that permits the GIA component to be represented mathematically by a simple, linear expression of the ratio of viscoelastic Love numbers that is valid for a broad range of Earth and ice-load models. The expression is shown to reproduce rigorous computations of surface uplift rates to within 0. 3 mm/yr, thus providing a means of inverting simultaneously for present-day mass loss and ongoing GIA with all the accuracy of a fully <b>detailed</b> <b>forward</b> model...|$|R
40|$|International audienceLow-resolution {{atmospheric}} thermal emission spectra {{collected by}} balloon-borne radiometers {{over the time}} span of 1990 ? 2002 are used to retrieve vertical profiles of HNO 3, CFC- 11 and CFC- 12 volume mixing ratios between approximately 10 and 35 km altitude. All of the data analyzed have been collected from launches from a Northern Hemisphere mid-latitude site, during late summer, when stratospheric dynamic variability is at a minimum. The retrieval technique incorporates <b>detailed</b> <b>forward</b> modeling of the instrument and the radiative properties of the atmosphere, and obtains a best fit between modeled and measured spectra {{through a combination of}} onion-peeling and global optimization steps. The retrieved HNO 3 profiles are consistent over the 12 -year period, and are consistent with recent measurements by the Atmospheric Chemistry Experiment-Fourier transform spectrometer satellite instrument. This suggests that, to within the errors of the 1990 measurements, there has been no significant change in the HNO 3 summer mid-latitude profile...|$|R
40|$|This Grant {{supported}} {{the development of}} an incoherent lidar system to measure winds and aerosols in the lower atmosphere. During this period the following activities occurred: (1) an active feedback system was developed to improve the laser frequency stability; (2) a <b>detailed</b> <b>forward</b> model of the instrument was developed to take into account many subtle effects, such as detector non-linearity; (3) a non-linear least squares inversion method was developed to recover the Doppler shift and aerosol backscatter without requiring assumptions about the molecular component of the signal; (4) a study was done of the effects of systematic errors due to multiple etalon misalignment. It was discovered that even for small offsets and high aerosol loadings, the wind determination can be biased by as much as 1 m/s. The forward model and inversion process were modified to account for this effect; and (5) the lidar measurements were validated using rawinsonde balloon measurements. The measurements were found to be in agreement within 1 - 2 m/s...|$|R
