Built from 1917 to 1921, the school was the second exclusive middle school in the city behind the now closed Centennial Junior High School.

The General Authority <b>for</b> <b>Educational</b> <b>Buildings</b> (GAEB) was chosen as a case study as it represents the biggest governmental organization responsible for planning, operating and maintaining schools in Egypt. This is achieved first through reviewing the literature of strategic asset management. In the next stage, structured interviews were conducted with senior managers of GAEB using a pre designed questionnaire to explore the current practice of asset management (AM). Gap analysis technique was applied against best practices compounded from a vast literature review and showed that the areas related to “people and organization” category are the weakest areas. Based on the findings, a SAMF for GAEB was developed. The study developed a checklist to be applied as a multifunctional tool for framework implementation and self assessment of asset management maturity. The developed checklist tool and its mechanism not only assess the overall AM maturity but also allow assessing the detailed step by step level of implementation of the framework. The framework was developed to improve GAEB AM performance and to reach at least the “Systematic Approach” level as a first stage in the improvement process. The framework has been implemented and the overall performance achieved the target score that lies in the range of Systematic Approach level, more over the areas related to “people and organization” category which represented a main weakness in GAEB have achieved a remarkable improvement...|$|E

This article concentrates on the methodology used for the inquiry, the findings and the consequences for Flemish educational building policy. The inquiry was commissioned by the Board of Directors of the Dienst voor Infrastructuurwerken van het Gesubsidieerd Onderwijs (DIGO [...] Subsidised Education, Infrastructure Works Department) and took place from June 1995 to late 1997. DIGO is a government agency that subsidises the purchase, construction and renovation of buildings for municipal, provincial and private institutions. It grants subsidies of up to 60 % of total construction costs for primary education and 70 % for secondary and higher education; the work must not exceed the maximum legal standards <b>for</b> <b>educational</b> <b>buildings.</b> Demand for state aid in financing educational infrastructure has been increasing for some years, and the funds available [...] US$ 90. 6 million per year [...] are far from sufficient. A waiting list has accrued, which in March 1998, represented a total of $ 394 million in construction projects. The aim of the inquiry was fourfold: to examine the degree to which existing buildings meet present educational needs; to recognise the needs that are not met; to provide an estimate of the funds necessary to accommodate those needs; to develop a needs-driven policy for administering building subsidies and planning future investments. Historical perspective Many of the educational buildings in use today in the Flemish community were built according to now outdated ideas about teaching methods, safety, hygiene and architecture and need to be adapted to current educational policy and practice.

40|$|This book {{uses the}} {{approach}} of the seminal work The Image of the City by Kevin Lynch, by showing the importance of talking to people and gauging their shared mental images of places. That work transformed the way many design professionals and social scientists dealt with form. It complemented the "art" approach to design, in which users would be expected to move their chair to satisfy a designer 2 ̆ 7 s ego, with a social science approach that tried to gauge user reactions. This book brings attention to using the same approach for interiors and to do so for school buildings. The book discusses the findings for fifteen schools of design. The systematic user evaluations of the aesthetics, function and technology reveal strengths to encourage in future designs, and weaknesses to avoid. Some of the findings on the design and process extend to all kinds of building on campus and elsewhere. Thus, although the book offers specific guidelines for future schools of design, it also offers guidelines with broader application to interiors <b>for</b> <b>educational</b> <b>buildings</b> and other building types, such as how to plan offices and gathering places to build community. This book should make readers more aware of problems in architectural interiors and of ways to make interiors work better for the building occupants...|$|E
40|$|Educational {{buildings}} such as kindergartens, {{schools and}} universities display many similar design, operation and maintenance features in most countries. The two most noteworthy similarities amongst these building types are the high energy consumption and the necessity for retrofitting many buildings within this sector. However, {{studies have shown that}} during retrofit, energy saving measures are only rarely applied, because the decision-makers lack knowledge of investments and the efficiency of potential energy saving measures. The main goal of the International Energy Agency ECBCS Annex 36 is to provide the educational building decision-makers with sufficient data, information and tools to improve their learning and teaching environments by improving the energy efficiency of their buildings. This is the background for the development of an Energy Concept Adviser (ECA) for energy and financial retrofit measures that is useful during the planning and concept development phases <b>for</b> <b>educational</b> <b>buildings.</b> On the one hand to help the owner to find the most efficient energy saving measures {{and on the other hand}} to prevent that exaggerated expectations are raised.
