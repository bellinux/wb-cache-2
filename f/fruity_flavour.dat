60|$|On {{this point}} {{he had the}} {{concurrence}} of Mr. Pratt, the only other medical man of the same standing in Milby. Otherwise, it was remarkable how strongly these two clever men were contrasted. Pratt was middle-sized, insinuating, and silvery-voiced; Pilgrim was tall, heavy, rough-mannered, and spluttering. Both were considered to have great powers of conversation, but Pratt's anecdotes were of the fine old crusted quality to be procured only of Joe Miller; Pilgrim's had the full <b>fruity</b> <b>flavour</b> {{of the most recent}} scandal. Pratt elegantly referred all diseases to debility, and, with a proper contempt for symptomatic treatment, went to the root of the matter with port wine and bark; Pilgrim was persuaded that the evil principle in the human system was plethora, and he made war against it with cupping, blistering, and cathartics. They had both been long established in Milby, and as each had a sufficient practice, there was no very malignant rivalry between them; on the contrary, they had that sort of friendly contempt for each other which is always conducive to a good understanding between professional men; and when any new surgeon attempted, in an ill-advised hour, to settle himself in the town, it was strikingly demonstrated how slight and trivial are theoretic differences compared with the broad basis of common human feeling. There was the most perfect unanimity between Pratt and Pilgrim in the determination to drive away the obnoxious and too probably unqualified intruder as soon as possible. Whether the first wonderful cure he effected was on a patient of Pratt's or of Pilgrim's, one was as ready as the other to pull the interloper by the nose, and both alike directed their remarkable powers of conversation towards making the town too hot for him. But by their respective patients these two distinguished men were pitted against each other with great virulence. Mrs. Lowme could not conceal her amazement that Mrs. Phipps should trust her life in the hands of Pratt, who let her feed herself up to that degree, it was really shocking to hear how short her breath was; and Mrs. Phipps had no patience with Mrs. Lowme, living, as she did, on tea and broth, and looking as yellow as any crow-flower, and yet letting Pilgrim bleed and blister her and give her lowering medicine till her clothes hung on her like a scarecrow's. On the whole, perhaps, Mr. Pilgrim's reputation was at the higher pitch, and when any lady under Mr. Pratt's care was doing ill, she was half disposed to think that a little more active treatment' might suit her better. But without very definite provocation no one would take so serious a step as to part with the family doctor, for in those remote days there were few varieties of human hatred more formidable than the medical. The doctor's estimate, even of a confiding patient, was apt to rise and fall with the entries in the day-book; and I have known Mr. Pilgrim discover the most unexpected virtues in a patient seized with a promising illness. At such times you might have been glad to perceive that there were some of Mr. Pilgrim's fellow-creatures of whom he entertained a high opinion, and that he was liable to the amiable weakness of a too admiring estimate. A good inflammation fired his enthusiasm, and a lingering dropsy dissolved him into charity. Doubtless this crescendo of benevolence was partly due to feelings not at all represented by the entries in the day-book; for in Mr. Pilgrim's heart, too, there was a latent store of tenderness and pity which flowed forth at the sight of suffering. Gradually, however, as his patients became convalescent, his view of their characters became more dispassionate; when they could relish mutton-chops, he began to admit that they had foibles, {{and by the time they}} had swallowed their last dose of tonic, he was alive to their most inexcusable faults. After this, the thermometer of his regard rested at the moderate point of friendly back-biting, which sufficed to make him agreeable in his morning visits to the amiable and worthy persons who were yet far from convalescent.|$|E

5|$|In {{contrast}} to other Alsatian wines, Rieslings d'Alsace {{are usually not}} meant to be drunk young, but many are still best in the first years. Rieslings d'Alsace tend to be mostly very dry with a cleansing acidity. They are thick-bodied wines that coat the palate. These wines age exceptionally well with a quality vintage aging up to 20 years. This is beneficial since the flavours in an Alsace wine will often open up after three years, developing softer and <b>fruitier</b> <b>flavours.</b> Riesling is very suitable for the late harvest Vendange Tardive and the botrytized Sélection de Grains Nobles, with good acidity keeping up the sweetness of the wine.|$|R

40|$|The flavour {{profiles}} of two genotypes of Charentais cantaloupe melons (medium shelf-life and long shelf-life), harvested at two distinct maturities (immature and mature fruit), were investigated. Dynamic headspace extraction (DHE), solid-phase extraction (SPE), gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and gas chromatography–olfactometry/mass spectrometry (GC-O/MS) {{were used to}} determine volatile and semi-volatile compounds. Qualitative descriptive analysis (QDA) was used to assess the organoleptic impact of the different melons and the sensory data were correlated with the chemical analysis. There were significant, consistent and substantial differences between the mature and immature fruit for the medium shelf-life genotype, the less mature giving a green, cucumber character and lacking the sweet, fruity character of the mature fruit. However, maturity at harvest had a much smaller impact on the long shelf-life melons and fewer differences were detected. These long shelf-life melons tasted sweet, but lacked <b>fruity</b> <b>flavours,</b> instead exhibiting a musty, earthy character...|$|R
40|$|Alcopops, {{which are}} fruit {{flavoured}} alcoholic drinks, have been implicated as an aetiological factor in dental erosion.

50|$|To make cheese {{the cheese}}maker brings milk (possibly pasteurised) in the cheese vat to a {{temperature}} required {{to promote the}} growth of the bacteria that feed on lactose and thus ferment the lactose into lactic acid. These bacteria in the milk may be wild, {{as is the case with}} unpasteurised milk, added from a culture, frozen or freeze dried concentrate of starter bacteria. Bacteria which produce only lactic acid during fermentation are homofermentative; those that also produce lactic acid and other compounds such as carbon dioxide, alcohol, aldehydes and ketones are heterofermentative. Fermentation using homofermentative bacteria is important in the production of cheeses such as Cheddar, where a clean, acid flavour is required. For cheeses such as Emmental the use of heterofermentative bacteria is necessary to produce the compounds that give characteristic <b>fruity</b> <b>flavours</b> and, importantly, the gas that results in the formation of bubbles in the cheese ('eye holes').|$|R

40|$|International audienceA yeast {{identified}} as Saprochaete suaveolens was investigated for {{its capacity to}} produce a large panel of flavouring molecules. With a production of 32 compounds including 28 esters, S. suaveolens {{seems to be a}} good producer of <b>fruity</b> <b>flavours</b> and fragrances and especially of unsaturated esters, such as ethyl tiglate. Physiological and biochemical analyses were performed in this study in an attempt to comprehend the metabolic route to the formation of this compound. We show that the accumulation of ethyl tiglate by S. suaveolens is specifically induced by isoleucine. However, and contrary to S. cerevisiae, which harbours a classical Ehrlich pathway leading to the production of 2 -methylbutanol from isoleucine, our results provide phenotypic and enzymological evidence of ethyl tiglate biosynthesis in S. suaveolens through the catabolism of this amino acid by the β-oxidation pathway, which generates tiglyl-CoA as a probable intermediate. A kinetic analysis of this flavour molecule during growth of S. suaveolens on glucose and isoleucine showed a phase of production of ethyl tiglate that culminated concurrently with isoleucine exhaustion, followed by a disappearance of this compound, likely due to reassimilation by the yeast.

40|$|Many fungi and yeasts {{have been}} found to produce de novo odorous compounds. Ceratocystis species and the yeasts Kluyveromyces lactis and Sporidiobolus salmonicolor produce a wide range of {{terpenes}} and lactones with fruity or floral flavours. The yeast Williopsis saturnus synthesizes de novo fruity ester flavours (i. e. volatile branched acetates); their yield can be improved by feeding fusel oil as a cheap source of precursor branched alcohols to the fermentation process. Geotrichum klebahnii also produces a broad spectrum of ethylesters of branched carboxylic acids, generating a pleasant <b>fruity</b> <b>flavour.</b> Also, precursor speciality fatty acids and PUFA’s can be converted by fungi (such as Penicillum sp. and Botryodiplodia sp.) into flavour compounds, that provide “green notes”, mushroom flavour, fruity lactones and cheese-flavoured methylketones. Similarly, a two step fungal process has been developed, whereby Aspergillus niger tranforms ferulic acid into vanillic acid, which basidiomycetes such as Pycnoporus cinnabarinus or Phanerochaete chrysosporium can further convert into vanillin. Furanone-flavours occur in many fruits, but have also been detected in microbial cultures.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{introduce}} the tangential microfiltration (TMF) technique on the production of orange juice (TMFJ), and compare it with pasteurised juice (control) as regards chemical composition and sensorial characteristics. We used a TMF pilot equipped with four monotubular ceramic membranes (0. 1, 0. 2, 0. 8 and 1. 4 mm) arranged in series with a filtering area of 0. 005 m² each. Commercial flash-pasteurised orange juice was used as the initial product. Experiments were divided into three parts: a) the characterisation of the TMF pilot; b) optimisation of operational conditions; c) production of the TMFJ. In the second part, membrane with 0. 8 -mm pores presented best flux followed by those with 1. 4 -, 0. 1 -, and 0. 2 -mm pores. However, to guarantee permeate sterility, we chose the membrane with 0. 1 -mm pores for TMFJ production. Initially, the orange juice was sieved in order to separate part of the pulp, being subsequently submitted to TMF. A mixture of retentate and pulp was made, and was subsequently pasteurised. We obtained the TMFJ by adding the permeate to the mixture. TMFJ presented soluble solids content (°Brix), pulp, pH, and titrable acidity similar to the initial pasteurised juice (control). Nevertheless, 28 % of vitamin C was lost during the TMFJ production.

40|$|Our {{experience}} of flavour involves integration of multiple sensory inputs, and the hedonic evaluation of this complex flavour experience {{is important in}} determination of food choice. The appearance of food also generates expectations about food flavour, and past work suggests that these expectations if confirmed enhance the flavour experience. What is less clear {{is what happens when}} cues prior to ingestion predict a flavour which is in marked contrast to the actual flavour characteristics. To test this, we conducted three experiments where expectations about food flavour were generated by plausible but inaccurate food labels for a highly novel food, smoked-salmon ice-cream. In Experiment 1, the {{experience of}} the food in the mouth generated strong dislike when labelled as ice-cream, but acceptance when labelled as frozen savoury mousse. Labelling the food as ice-cream also resulted in stronger ratings of how salty and savoury the food was than when labelled as a savoury food. Experiment 2 confirmed these findings, and also found that an uninformative label also resulted in acceptable liking ratings. Experiment 3 explicitly tested the effect of labels on flavour expectation, and confirmed that the ice-cream label generated strong expectations of a sweet, <b>fruity</b> <b>flavour,</b> consistent with the visual appearance of the ice-cream, but in marked contrast to the flavour of salty fish. As in Experiments 1 and 2, liking was minimal when the food was tasted after the ice-cream label condition, but liking was acceptable in the other label conditions. These data show that the contrast between expected and actual sensory qualities can result in a strong negative affective response and enhancement of the unexpected sensory qualities...|$|E
40|$|Background and Aims:Wine aroma is {{influenced}} by complex interactions between various wine constituents. This study investigated the sensorial interactive effects of Sauvignon Blanc impact compounds, 3 -mercaptohexan- 1 -ol, 3 -isobutyl- 2 -methoxypyrazine with aldehydes typically originating from oxidation of white wines, methional and phenylacetaldehyde. Methods and Results: Spiked model wines were subjected to sensory descriptive analysis using a trained panel. The concentration of each compound varied from below aroma threshold value to high values reported in wine. Combinations of the four compounds were also evaluated sensorially. Depending on the concentration of the compounds, methional had a strong suppressive effect on the intensity of attributes contributed by 3 -mercaptohexan- 1 -ol, such as grapefruit and guava, whereas methional and 3 -isobutyl- 2 -methoxypyrazine enhanced the intensity of certain attributes, which included cooked beans and cooked potato. Conclusions: Complex sensory interactions may occur between Sauvignon Blanc impact compounds and compounds related to oxidation depending on concentration of the compounds. Oxidation-derived compounds such as methional can suppress pleasant aroma attributes linked to volatile thiols, while contributing negative attributes especially {{in the presence of}} 3 -isobutyl- 2 -methoxypyrazine. Significance of the Study: This study highlights the importance of preserving fresh and <b>fruity</b> <b>flavours</b> while preventing the formation of unwanted aldehydes due to interactions that can influence the overall aroma profil...|$|R

40|$|Volatiles of {{differently}} ripened fresh pineapples {{were investigated}} by a non-targeted profiling analysis comparing fruits harvested at full maturity exported by rapid air freight to pineapples harvested {{at an earlier}} green-ripe stage. The latter fruits were exported by sea freight and analysed upon arrival at their destination and after post-harvest flavour genesis. Volatiles were analysed by headspace solid-phase microextraction, gas chromatography–mass spectrometry and multivariate statistical data analysis. Clear-cut differences in the volatile profiles were found. Fully ripe air-freighted pineapples were characterised by elevated concentrations of two 1, 3, 5, 8 -undecatetraene isomers, methyl 3 -methylbutanoate and 4 -methoxy- 2, 5 -dimethyl- 3 (2 H) -furanone, which have been reported as potent contributors to the pineapple flavour. Compared to fully ripened fruits, development of volatiles of sea-freighted pineapples upon arrival in Europe was rudimentary. Post-harvest storage of sea-freighted pineapples resulted in a different volatile profile due to the genesis of hydroxylated and acetoxylated methyl esters and hexanal. Subsequent descriptive sensory analysis was performed by trained panellists comparing retronasal odour and taste profiles. Fully ripe fruits were characterised by a pineapple-like note, <b>fruity</b> <b>flavours</b> and a sweet taste. In contrast, most of these attributes were rated at lower intensities when premature green-ripe fruits were tested. At {{the end of the}} post-harvest period, sea-freighted pineapples were characterised by fruity notes accompanied by a musty/corky- and cardboard-like off-flavour.
