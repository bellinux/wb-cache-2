However, the converse is not true and environments with the same mean temperature can exhibit very different <b>diurnal</b> temperate <b>ranges.</b> Here we apply a degree-day model for development of the grape berry moth (Paralobesia viteana, a significant vineyard pest in the northeastern USA) to investigate how different <b>diurnal</b> temperature <b>range</b> conditions can influence degree-day accumulation and, hence, insect life history. We first consider changes in <b>diurnal</b> temperature <b>range</b> independent of changes in mean temperatures. We then investigate grape berry moth life history under potential climate change conditions, increasing mean temperature via variable patterns of change to <b>diurnal</b> temperature <b>range.</b> We predict that <b>diurnal</b> temperature <b>range</b> change can substantially alter insect life history. Altering <b>diurnal</b> temperature <b>range</b> independent of the mean temperature can affect development rate and voltinism, with the magnitude of the effects dependent on whether changes occur to the daily minimum temperature (Tmin), daily maximum temperature (Tmax), or both.

In more elevated regions, it is still greater, the climate becoming excessive at 15,000 feet, where the difference amounts to 30 degrees at least.* [This is contrary to the conclusions of all meteorologists who have studied the climate of the Alps, and is entirely due to the local disturbances which I have so often dwelt upon, and principally to the unequal distribution of moisture in the loftier rearward regions, and the aridity of Tibet. Professor James Forbes states (Ed. Phil. Trans., v. xiv. p. 489):--1. That the decrement of temperature with altitude is most rapid in summer: this (as I shall hereafter show) is not the case in the Himalaya, chiefly because the warm south moist wind then prevails. 2. That the annual range of temperature diminishes with the elevation: this, too, is not the case in Sikkim, because of the barer surface and more cloudless skies of the rearward loftier regions. 3. That the <b>diurnal</b> <b>range</b> of temperature diminishes with the height: {{that this is not the}} cane follows from the same cause. 4. That radiation is least in winter: this is negatived by the influence of the summer rains.] The accompanying table is the result of an attempt to approximate to the mean temperatures and ranges of the thermometer at various elevations.|$|E

Deer visited developed water sources regularly during hot-dry seasons and infrequently 14 days after the summer rains began. Large amounts of preformed water were available in hot-wet season diets, but permanent or ephemeral water was necessary to meet total water requirements. Visits of cattle to troughs did not preclude deer use because of different activity patterns between the 2 species.

40|$|We {{show the}} annual {{climatology}} of the diurnal cycle, stratified by opaque cloud, using the full hourly {{resolution of the}} Canadian Prairie data. The opaque cloud field itself has distinct cold and warm season diurnal climatologies; with a near-sunrise peak of cloud in the cold season and an early afternoon peak in the warm season. There are two primary climate states on the Canadian Prairies, separated by the freezing point of water, because a reflective surface snow cover acts as a climate switch. Both cold and warm season climatologies {{can be seen in}} the transition months of November, March and April with a large difference in mean temperature. In the cold season with snow, the <b>diurnal</b> <b>ranges</b> of temperature and relative humidity increase quasi-linearly with decreasing cloud, and increase from December to March with increased solar forcing. The warm season months, April to September, show a homogeneous coupling to the cloud cover, and a diurnal cycle of temperature and humidity that depends only on net longwave. Our improved representation of the diurnal cycle shows that the warm season coupling between <b>diurnal</b> temperature <b>range</b> and net longwave is weakly quadratic through the origin, rather than the linear coupling shown in earlier papers. We calculate the conceptually important 24 -h imbalances of temperature and relative humidity (and other thermodynamic variables) as a function of opaque cloud cover. In the warm season under nearly clear skies, there is a warming of + 2 oC and a drying of - 6 % over the 24 -h cycle, which is about 12 % of their <b>diurnal</b> <b>ranges.</b> We summarize results on conserved variable diagrams and explore the impact of surface windspeed on the diurnal cycle in the cold and warm seasons. In all months, the fall in minimum temperature is reduced with increasing windspeed, which reduces the <b>diurnal</b> temperature <b>range.</b> In July and August, there is an increase of afternoon maximum temperature and humidity at low windspeeds, and a corresponding rise in equivalent potential temperature of 4. 4 K that appears coupled to increased precipitation.
