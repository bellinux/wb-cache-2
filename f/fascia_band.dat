RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: The study has provided objective data for a clinical test measuring flexibility of the iliopsoas, quadriceps, and tensor <b>fascia</b> lata/iliotibial <b>band.</b> It is recommended that sufficient flexibility is obtained to perform a specific sport and that asymmetries between limbs are addressed. ...|$|R
50|$|The {{species has}} a {{wingspan}} of 30-35 mm. Its distinctive outline is familiar at lighted windows. The wings are buff or cream with dark <b>fasciae</b> (<b>bands).</b> Two main forms exist, equally abundant: one has darker shading between the central fasciae, the other (designated ab. remutata) has not. The ground colour of the wings is whitish yellow to ochre. Some specimens have a red-orange tone colouring. The pattern elements are dark brown and clearly shown. On the forewings {{there are three}} crosslines; on the hind wings there are two crosslines. The outer cross line has a significant outward angle near the costa. The area between the middle and outer cross line is dark brown. The discal flecks are small and inconspicuous, {{they may also be}} missing. Small marginal dots lie at the outer edge and can make almost a narrow marginal line.|$|R
50|$|The bascule span was {{designed}} to be concealed as much as possible. The AMBC required that the counterweights be hidden within and below the superstructure of the bridge so as not to mar the appearance of the Neoclassical design. The <b>fascia</b> (the <b>band</b> running horizontally along its upper edge) was made of pressed metal that looked like masonry, and it was painted the same color {{as the rest of the}} granite on the bridge.|$|R
50|$|The {{appearance}} of H. ligatus individuals closely resembles {{other members of}} the genus Halictus. These individuals are easily differentiated from those of the closely related Lasioglossum by the presence of their pale <b>fasciae</b> hair <b>bands</b> on the posterior margins of the metasomal terga. In addition, the species is predominantly black or brown-black and lacks the faint metallic tints found in bees of the Seladonia subgenus. Moreover, species of Halictus are generally longer than species of Seladonia which average to be shorter than around 7 mm.|$|R
500|$|M. campanulae females measure 10–12 {{millimeters}} (0.39–0.47in) in length. [...] Although they resemble M. angelarum, {{the white}} <b>banding</b> (<b>fascia)</b> {{at the apex}} of the 5th tergal segment found on M. angelarum is absent in M. campanulae. [...] Females can also can be recognized by parallel sided metastoma.|$|R
25|$|Women {{in ancient}} Rome adopted {{a form of}} the Greek apodesme, known as the strophium or mamillare. Since the Romans {{regarded}} large breasts as comical, or characteristic of aging or unattractive women, young girls wore breast <b>bands</b> (<b>fascia)</b> secured tightly {{in the belief that}} doing so would prevent overly large, sagging breasts.|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Dupuytren's {{contracture}} {{or disease}} (DD) is a fibro-proliferative {{disease of the}} hand that results {{in the development of}} scar-like, collagen-rich disease cords within specific palmar <b>fascia</b> <b>bands.</b> Although the molecular pathology of DD is unknown, recent evidence suggests that β-catenin may play a role. In this study, collagen matrix cultures of primary disease fibroblasts show enhanced contraction and isometric tension-dependent changes in β-catenin and fibronectin levels. Methods Western blots of β-catenin and fibronectin levels were determined for control and disease primary cell cultures grown within stressed- and attached-collagen matrices. Collagen contraction was quantified, and immunocytochemistry analysis of filamentous actin performed. Results Disease cells exhibited enhanced collagen contraction activity compared to control cells. Alterations in isometric tension of collagen matrices triggered dramatic changes in β-catenin and fibronectin levels, including a transient increase in β-catenin levels within disease cells, while fibronectin levels steadily decreased to levels below those seen in normal cell cultures. In contrast, both fibronectin and β-catenin levels increased in attached collagen-matrix cultures of disease cells, while control cultures showed only increases in fibronectin levels. Immunocytochemistry analysis also revealed extensive filamentous actin networks in disease cells, and enhanced attachment and spreading of disease cell in collagen matrices. Conclusion Three-dimensional collagen matrix cultures of primary disease cell lines are more contractile and express a more extensive filamentous actin network than patient-matched control cultures. The elevated levels of β-catenin and Fn seen in collagen matrix cultures of disease fibroblasts can be regulated by changes in isometric tension. </p...|$|R
50|$|The upper {{surfaces}} of {{the wings of the}} male Kallima paralekta have been described as extremely beautiful. They possess oblique bright orange <b>bands</b> (<b>fascia)</b> on the upper {{surfaces of}} their forewings, the inner borders of which terminate at the lower corner of the forewings. The areas below the orange bands and the entire upper surface of the hindwings are a brilliant deep blue to purple.|$|R
25|$|The Ionic {{order is}} also marked by an entasis, a curved {{tapering}} {{in the column}} shaft. A column of the ionic order is nine times its lower diameter. The shaft itself is eight diameters high. The architrave of the entablature commonly consists of three stepped <b>bands</b> (<b>fasciae).</b> The frieze comes without the Doric triglyph and metope. The frieze sometimes comes with a continuous ornament such as carved figures instead.|$|R
50|$|The {{wingspan}} is 11-12 mm. The forewings {{are dark}} fuscous, irregularly sprinkled with violet-whitish, {{especially on the}} undefined transverse bands at one-third and two-thirds and a narrower terminal <b>fascia,</b> the postmedian <b>band</b> forming a small while spot on the costa at three-fifths. There are two small round spots of the dark groundcolour transversely placed {{on the end of}} the cell. The hindwings are dark fuscous, lighter in the disc and towards the base.|$|R
5000|$|The first {{description}} of the species, {{one of the earliest}} for any Australian fish, was in 1790 by John White in his Journal of a Voyage to New South Wales though some sources give George Shaw (who assisted White in the preparation of his manuscript) as the species authority. White originally named it the long-spined chaetodon (Chætodon armatus) and described it as follows: Whitish Chaetodon, with seven black stripes on the body. Six spines on the dorsal fin, the third very long. This appears to be a new and very elegant species of the genus Chaetodon. The total length of the specimen was not more than four inches. The colour a silvery white, darker, and of a bluish tinge on the back; the transverse <b>fasciae,</b> or <b>bands,</b> of a deep black; the fins and tail of a pale brown. The third ray or spine of the first dorsal fin is much longer than the rest.|$|R
50|$|Coxalgia sáljə {{also known}} as coxodynia (koks'ō-din'ē-ă) from coxa - hip (L) and -algia / odyne (G) pain and is defined as pain in the hip or disease-related pain of the hip. Coxalgia refers to general {{sensation}} of pain in the hip area, including the muscles surrounding the hip - Sartorius, tensor <b>fasciae</b> latae, ilio-tibila <b>banding</b> and the sensation of the tissue surrounding bones. Coxalgia will have an underlying cause- in adults this is most commonly osteoarthritis, degeneration of hip joints or bursitis (inflammation of the bursae -fluid sacs) of the joints. Coxalgia may precede diagnosis or identification of other diseases by some considerable time as indicated for monitoring and review.|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{identify}} the effects of tensor <b>fasciae</b> latae-iliotibial <b>band</b> (TFL-ITB) self-stretching exercise on the lumbopelvic movement patterns during active prone hip lateral rotation (HLR) in subjects with lumbar extension rotation syndrome accompanying TFL-ITB shortness. Eleven subjects (9 male and 2 female) were recruited for the two-week study. A three dimensional ultrasonic motion analysis system was used to measure the lumbopelvic movement patterns. The TFL-ITB length was measured using the modified Ober’s test and was expressed as the hip horizontal adduction angle. The subjects were instructed how to perform TFL-ITB self-stretching exercise program at home. A paired t-test was performed to determine the significant difference in the angle of lumbopelvic rotation, movement onset time of lumbopelvic rotation, TFL-ITB length, and LBP intensity before and after the two-week period of performing the TFL-ITB self-stretching exercise. The results showed that after the intervention, the lumbopelvic rotation angle decreased significantly (p<. 05), the movement onset time reduced significantly (p<. 05), and LBP intensity decreased slightly but not significantly (p=. 07). The hip horizontal adduction angle increased significantly (p<. 05) after the intervention. These findings indicate that TFL-ITB stretching exercise increased TFL-ITB length, decreased lumbopelvic rotation angle, and delayed the movement onset time of lumbopelvic rotation after two-weeks. In conclusion, the TFL-IT...|$|R
40|$|Abstract &nbsp; Background and Aim: Anterior {{knee pain}} (AKP or AnKP) {{is one of}} the most common {{disorders}} of knee. Many studies have been implemented about anterior knee pain and effect of different treatments on this disorder. Todays, this general term has been divided and studied more closely. Knee extension syndrome {{is one of the}} common disorders in orthopedic and physical therapy that diagnosed with increased stiffness of quadriceps muscle and causes anterior knee pain. The purpose of this review article is to evaluate this disorder more closely. &nbsp; Materials and Methods: A literature search was carried out using MEDLINE and SCIENCE DIRECT cite and JOSPT journal database to assess existing literature about anterior knee pain. Furthermore, literatures about the different standpoints of anterior knee pain and effectiveness of different treatments and interventions of anterior knee pain and knee extension syndrome have been identified. &nbsp; Results: Fifty articles have been surveyed: forty-two articles evaluated the effect of different treatments on anterior knee pain. Five articles evaluated the various aspects of anterior knee pain more closely and three ones related to knee extension syndrome. &nbsp; Conclusion: According to these studies results, the causes of anterior knee pain can be classified in two categories: 1) anterior knee pain associated with patellofemoral disorders and 2) anterior knee pain non-associated with patellofemoral disorders. The knee extension syndrome is the cause for&nbsp;anterior knee pain but non-associated with patellofemoral disorders. In this disorder, the tilt angle of patella could be increased and this factor can increase the patients' pain. In contrast to general belief that focuses on tensor <b>fascia</b> lata- ilotiobial <b>band</b> complex (TFL-ITB complex), the rectus femoris muscle stretching should be focused more, because the ilotiobial band has a less effect on patellar tilt. &nbsp; Key words: Anterior knee pain, knee extension syndrome, rehabilitation, The TFL-ITB complex &nbsp...|$|R
