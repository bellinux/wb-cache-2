Horses from Austria and from South Tyrol have the letter [...] "H" [...] {{in the center of the}} brand, while horses from all other parts of Italy have the letters [...] "HI". Horses are graded based on conformation, action, bone, height, temperament and color. Mares must have a fully registered purebred pedigree extending six generations back to be considered for stud book acceptance. Stallions are registered separately. Colts must have a dam with a fully purebred pedigree, and are inspected based on hereditary reliability and likely breeding strength as well as the other qualifications. Each stallion's registration certification must show a fully purebred pedigree extending back four generations, as well as records of mares covered, percentages of pregnancies aborted, still-born and live-born, and numbers and genders of foals born. This information is used to match stallions and mares for breeding. Tyrolean colts undergo an initial assessment, and those not chosen must be either gelded or sold out of the Tyrolean breeding area.

40|$|Thesis (MEd) [...] PU vir CHODuring 1913 {{arrangements}} {{have been}} made for the hygienic inspection of school children in primary schools, in Transvaal, Dr C. L. Leipoldt was appointed. Medical <b>inspection</b> <b>started</b> in April, 1914, and discontinued, owing to {{the outbreak of the}} war in August, and was resumed in October 1915. In 1918 the scheme of inspection was organized on a sound basis, but was interrupted by the influenza epidemic. In 1919, Dr Leipoldt, was seconded to the Cape, and the service was carried out by Drs Cleaver and Elias. For private reasons, Dr Leipoldt resigned at the end of 1922. Dr J. A. Kieser, joined the service in 1922 and retired at the end of 1948. After various temporary appointments, Dr F. Z. van der Merwe was appointed on the 23 rd of July 1951, and retired on the 10 th of December 1954. Dr c. E. Theron has been appointed as his successor as from January 1955. During 1958 a Commission of Enquiry was appointed to inquire into the efficiency of the school medical service. In 1959, extensions of the service and the provision for more satisfactory accommodation were held in abeyance, awaiting the proposed transfer of the School Medical Services to the Department of Hospital Services. The expected transfer did not eventuate in 1960 and the work continued as before. On 1 st April 1961, the School Medical Service as a whole was taken over by the Department of Hospital Services. The buildings, equipment, etc. were also tranferred. In future Dental Service would no longer function as part of the School Medical Service, but would continue to exist as a separate section under its own head. The nurses are, engaged exclusively in service to schools. All treatments and arrangements are now controlled by the hospitals.

40|$|International audienceIn {{this paper}} the authors present an {{original}} methodology aiming at the automation of the geometric <b>inspection,</b> <b>starting</b> from a high-density acquired surface.

Well-defined rules are then necessary for the unambiguous identification of these intrinsic nominal references. These rules {{are an integral part of}} the tolerance specification. This new approach requires that a recognition process be performed on the acquired model so as to automatically identify the already-mentioned intrinsic nominal references. The assessable errors refer to recognizable geometric entities and their evaluation leaves the nominal reference specification aside since they can be intrinsically associated with a recognized geometric shape. Tolerance specification is defined based on the error categories which can be automatically evaluated and which are an integral part of the specification language...|$|R

40|$|International audienceIn a {{previous}} paper (Di Angelo et al. 2010) we proposed an original methodology for the automation of the geometric <b>inspection,</b> <b>starting</b> from an acquired high-density surface. That approach performed a recognition process on the acquired data aiming at {{the identification of}} some Intrinsic Nominal References. An Intrinsic Nominal Reference was detected when a geometric property was recognised to be common {{to a set of}} adjacent points in the 3 D data set representing the acquired object. The recognition of these properties was carried out based on some rules. Starting from these concepts, a new specification language was defined, which is based on recognisable geometric entities. This paper expands the category of Intrinsic Nominal References to include new mutual intrinsic orientation, location and dimensional properties pertaining to 3 D features. This approach involves the automatic construction of a geometric reference model for a scanned workpiece, called Recognised Geometric Model (RGM). The domain of the representable entities within the RGM strictly depends on the rules used for the recognition of the intrinsic properties. In particular, this paper focuses on the rules for the recognition of the orientation and location properties between non-ideal features. When using the RGM, tolerances are specified according to the set of available and recognisable intrinsic nominal references. Based on the geometric product specification, the RGM data structure can be queried to capture some quantitative information concerning special intrinsic geometric parameters and/or non-idealities...|$|R
50|$|Failure {{analysis}} {{is the process}} of collecting and analyzing data to determine the cause of a failure, often with the goal of determining corrective actions or liability. It is an important discipline in many branches of manufacturing industry, such as the electronics industry, where it is a vital tool used in the development of new products and for the improvement of existing products. The failure analysis process relies on collecting failed components for subsequent examination of the cause or causes of failure using a wide array of methods, especially microscopy and spectroscopy. Nondestructive testing (NDT) methods (such as industrial computed tomography scanning) are valuable because the failed products are unaffected by analysis, so <b>inspection</b> sometimes <b>starts</b> using these methods.|$|R

In the AUDITAC project, we will describe the features of the two levels audit methods; pre-audit (or walk-through) and (detailed) audit. In order to support the harmonisation of the implementation of the AC systems <b>inspection,</b> <b>starting</b> from the <b>inspection</b> schemes already on the market, we assessed their effectiveness and establish a link with the operation and maintenance practices.

This tool has been created to prepare and introduce air conditioning actors (energy managers, facilities owners, technicians related to AC etc…) to the compulsory inspection and to disseminate the advantages and opportunities that the subsequent audit can give. The audit approach is globally explained in the TP from cooling production to distribution, operation and maintenance and finally control strategies.

40|$|The non-existence of {{relevant}} data {{capable of a}} global appreciation of sprayers in Portugal {{is one of the}} key issues for the preparation of this study and to improve the good agricultural practices at the plant protection. Nowadays the pesticides application in agriculture is one of the most used agricultural practices by farmers to optimize plant health, which are still the major cause of disruptions in agroecosystems sustainability and biodiversity. The effectiveness of pesticides application depends on several factors among which the farmer can control, the application equipment, his know-how, the biological target, the choice of the pesticide and the choice of the best moment to perform the pesticide application. Thus the best maintenance application equipment and calibration for one specific purpose will maximize the effectiveness of pesticides application. This study is based on statistical analysis of periodic evaluations carried out by sprayer inspections in Portugal in the past four years, using nozzles pressure tests, flow rate tests and visual evaluation of the sprayer. The correct approach to the application equipment for pesticides is getting more attention internationally and in Portugal too. This growing concern became visible when the sprayer <b>inspections</b> <b>started</b> to be available to all Portuguese farmers. In those inspections was found that farmers and technicians knowledge about sprayers is very heterogeneous. It is still common the use of inappropriate equipment for pesticides application, equipment in poor condition, the use of inappropriate solutions for a specific purpose and the unknown basic rules for making pesticides application. In conclusion, maintenance and sprayers calibration are still a critical process in crops treatment that we must succeed to improve to better pesticides application...|$|R
