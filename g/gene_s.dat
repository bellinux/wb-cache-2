40|$|Macro- and {{micronuclei}} of Tetrahymena thermophila each contain approximately 30 {{clusters of}} 5 <b>S</b> <b>genes</b> per haploid genome. Structural changes in DNA sequences associated {{with some of}} these clusters occur during the development of the transcriptionally active macronucleus from the transcriptionally inert micronucleus. Exonuclease digestion indicates that DNA fragmentation is not responsible for these changes, making it likely that sequence rearrangements occur near some 5 <b>S</b> <b>genes</b> during macronuclear development. These rearrangements appear to be random in location with respect to the 5 <b>S</b> <b>genes</b> and do not alter either the tandem repeat organization of the genes, the average number (five) or the range in number (one to about 16) of genes per cluster. The 5 <b>S</b> <b>gene</b> clusters are not closely linked and are not flanked by common repeating elements large enough to cross-hybridize. Sequence analysis of one tandem repeat suggests that Tetrahymena 5 <b>S</b> <b>genes</b> have intragenic promoters.

40|$|The {{organization}} of the 5 <b>S</b> <b>genes</b> in the genome of Tetrahymena thermophila was examined in various strains, with germinal ageing, and the 5 <b>S</b> <b>gene</b> clusters were mapped to the MIC chromosomes. When MIC or MAC DNA is cut with the restriction enzyme Eco RI, electrophoresed, blotted, and probed with a 5 S rDNA probe, the banding patterns represent the clusters of the 5 <b>S</b> rRNA <b>genes</b> as well as flanking regions. The use of long gels and 60 h of electrophoresis at 10 mA permitted resolution of some 30 – 35 5 <b>S</b> <b>gene</b> clusters on fragments {{ranging in size from}} 30 - 2 kb (bottom of gel). The majority of the 5 <b>S</b> <b>gene</b> clusters were found in both MIC and MAC genomes, a few being MIC limited and a few MAC limited. The relative copy number of 5 <b>S</b> <b>genes</b> in each cluster was determined by integrating densitometric tracings made from autoradiograms. The total number of copies in the MAC was found to be 33 % greater than in the MIC. When different inbred strains were examined, the majority of the 5 <b>S</b> <b>gene</b> clusters were found to be conserved, with a few strain-specific clusters observed. Nine nullisomic strains missing both copies of one or more MIC chromosomes were used to map the 5 <b>S</b> <b>gene</b> clusters. The clusters were distributed non-randomly to four of the five MIC chromosomes, with 17 of them localized to chromosome 1. A deletion map of chromosome 1 was constructed using various deletion strains. Some of these deletion strains included B strain clones which had been in continuous culture for 15 years. Losses of 5 <b>S</b> <b>gene</b> clusters in these ageing MIC could be attributed to deletions of particular chromosomes. The chromosomal distribution of the 5 <b>S</b> <b>gene</b> clusters in Tetrahymena is unlike that found for the well-studied eukaryotes, Drosophila and Xenopus. ...|$|R
