5|$|Khalifa {{has also}} said that her parents have stopped {{speaking}} to her because of her career choice.

In her closing argument, Lhermitte said she would accept any punishment the court gave her and showed remorse for <b>her</b> <b>actions.</b> Earlier in the trial, psychiatrists had found that Lhermitte was not of sound mind when she committed the acts and should not be held accountable for <b>her</b> <b>actions.</b> They felt that she should be admitted into a psychiatric institution rather than going to prison, but the jury did not follow their opinions.

5|$|He continued, {{describing}} the unhappiness of his marriage, {{and how that}} made him vulnerable to her attributes, which were shared by all the learned gentlemen of his circle.

40|$|When a person’s payoff {{depends on}} both <b>her</b> <b>action</b> and {{probabilistic}} events, the action she chooses and her payoff {{can be understood}} as random variables. This paper shows that incentive compatibility implies that when a person chooses among two actions, conditional on these two <b>actions,</b> <b>her</b> <b>action</b> is nonnegatively correlated with the payoff difference be-tween the two actions. This simple and robust result has implications {{in a wide variety of}} contexts, including individual choice under uncertainty, strategic form games, and incom-plete information games. Incentive compatibility constraints have an immediate “statistical” interpretation. JEL classification: C 72 Noncooperative Game...|$|R
