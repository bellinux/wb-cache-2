40|$|A novel {{self-assembly}} {{method is}} presented for creating self-assembled three-dimensional micro-electro-mechanical systems (MEMS) structures. The residual stress between structural polymer layers caused by separate curing processes {{has been used}} as the self-assembly mechanism. Various radii of curvature are presented using this self-assembly method in order to show the capability of fabricating three-dimensional microstructures. SU- 8 negative photoresist is used as a structural material, and induced stresses are lithographically defined for self-assembly. The self-assembly mechanism is simulated using finite element analysis in ANSYS. Several types of self-assembled microstructures are presented. The fabrication is performed at low temperatures and is compatible with commercial <b>integrated-circuit</b> <b>processes...</b>|$|R

40|$|Absfract-The {{processing}} {{parameters of}} monolithic polycrystalline silicon resistors are examined, {{and the effect}} of grain size on the sensi-tivity of polysilicon resistivity versus doping concentration is studied theoreticay and experimentally. Because existing models for poly-silicon do not accurately predict resistivity dependence on doping con-centration as grain size increases above 600 A, a modified trapping model for polysilicon with different grain sizes and under various ap-plied biases is introduced. Good agreement between theory and experi-ments demonstrates that an increase in grain size from 230 to 1220 A drastically reduces the sensitivity of polysilicon resistivity to doping levels by two orders of magnitude. Such an increase is achieved by modifications of the <b>integrated-circuit</b> <b>processes.</b> Design criteria for the optimization of monolithic polysilicon resistors have also been established based on resistivity control, thermal properties, and device geometry...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the design of}} an integrated coupled-oscillator array in SiGe for millimeter-wave applications. The design focuses on a scalable radio architecture where multiple dies are tiled to form larger arrays. A 2 × 2 oscillator array for a 60 -GHz transmitter is fabricated with integrated power amplifiers and on-chip antennas. To lock between multiple dies, an injection-locking scheme appropriate for wire-bond interconnects is described. The 2 × 2 array demonstrates a 200 –MHz locking range and 1 × 4 array formed by two adjacent chips has a 60 -MHz locking range. The phase noise of the coupled oscillators is below 100 dBc/Hz at a 1 -MHz offset when locked to an external reference. To {{the best of the}} authors’ knowledge, this is the highest frequency demonstration of coupled oscillators fabricated in a conventional silicon <b>integrated-circuit</b> <b>process...</b>|$|R
40|$|Abstract: The Babinet’s effect {{occurs at}} a long {{wavelength}} span of incident light during FTIR (Fourier Transform Infrared) spectroscopy scanning in complementary LHM (Left-Handed Material) samples. The occurring wavelength ranges from 4 to 20 µ m under a scanned light source in 2. 5 ~ 25 µ m regime. The LHM sample consists of an SRR (Split Ring Resonator) adjacent to wire array in periodic order. Complement samples were prepared using standard <b>integrated-circuit</b> <b>processes</b> on a Si wafer. Gold nano particles were deposited on the conducting parts of patterns. The positive pattern is a sample that patched with periodic Au wire on the Si wafer. And the negative one is adopted with a reverse way, the wire part is empty of Au and the surrounding space is filled with Au particles. Transmittance-enhanced behavior was identified from those consequent data. The surface plasmon resonated effect on Au nano particle on top of surface seems to contribute the enhancement.

However, these conventional gauges are physically large, operate at high power, and have a slow response time. A single-walled carbon-nanotube (SWNT) -based chemical sensing gauge relies on differences in thermal conductance of the respective gases surrounding the CNT as it is voltage-biased, {{as a means for}} chemical identification.

Using an <b>integrated-circuit</b> fabrication <b>process,</b> this structure was fabricated in diffused polycrystalline silicon and metal layers and measured optically and electrically.

40|$|The {{degradation}} of GaAs {{metal semiconductor field-effect transistor}} (MESFET) performance after rinsing {{for a short}} time in deionized water is investigated. It is caused by the oxidation of the GaAs surface specially in the periphery of metal electrodes. The mechanism of the rapid surface oxidation is contributed by the electrode reaction between GaAs and electrode metal. Oxygen dissolved in deionized water has a significant effect on the reaction. The GaAs <b>integrated-circuit</b> (IC) <b>process</b> is substantially different from the Si IC process because there is no high qual itynative oxide of GaAs. In Si IC processing thermal oxidation of the Si surface is performed first, and the sur-face of Si is covered by SiO 2 except when ohmic contacts are to be formed. In GaAs IC processing, however, the sur-face of GaAs often is exposed to ambience because the na-tive oxide of GaAs is unstable. Chemical vapor deposited S iQ (CVD SiO 2) is used often to cover the GaAs surface. But the CVD SiO 2 is removed repeatedly and redeposited i...|$|R
30|$|Among {{versatile}} nanomaterials, silicon nanomaterials are {{of particular}} interest due to their excellent compatibility to very-large-scale integration [VLSI] <b>integrated-circuit</b> <b>processes.</b> However, the emission currents from conventional FE cathodes with a large vacuum gap, usually larger than hundred micrometers, are insufficient for practical and realistic electronic applications, and the large operating voltages are far too high for being integrated into the standard CMOS electronic devices. However, following Moore's law for microelectronic devices, within the ever-improving VLSI/USLI technology, nanodiodes with a nanogap may be envisioned {{in the very near}} future, and they may bring advantages of lower power consumption and high-current output for the next-generation vacuum nanoelectronics. When aggressively squeezing the vacuum electronic devices to the nanoscale level, many challenging and anomalous physical effects will emerge, such as the space charge effect [13], energy accumulation that increases the burnout resistance, and vacuum sealing; these are, however, ignorable in conventional FE microdevices. The most striking effect, which is, however, largely ignored in previous literature, is the relatively low field enhancement factor obtained from the experimental Fowler-Nordheim [FN] plot. The field enhancement factor may describe the ability of specific emitters to amplify the macroscopic field, which in turn determines the total emission current. In many experiments of nanoscale FE characterizations (usually apply a tungsten [W]-probe anode with its work function, Φ = 4.4 eV [14]) for a single carbon nanotube [15], nanofiber, or nanoflakes [16] with a work function of Φ = 5.1 ∓ 0.1 eV, the reported field enhancement factors for nanogaps of d = 60 to approximately 380 nm are in the range of 90 to approximately 380 nm [17]. These values are, however, much lower than those obtained from FE microdiodes with a vacuum gap larger than a few hundred micrometers, of which the field enhancement factor is usually in the order of 103 to 104 [18]. These values are already conservative, and if we consider a more realistic scenario, the electrostatic screening effect [10] implies that the field enhancement factor for the arrays of nanoemitters should be strongly dependent on the density and arrangement of nanoemitters. It is therefore relevant to explain the anomalously low field enhancement factor in vacuum nanodiodes. For such small vacuum nanogap, the simple electrostatic explanation may not be sufficient, and a careful look into a quantum level is necessary by considering all energy levels of nanodiode structures, including the effect of anode. It is rather illustrative to use the energy band diagram to study how the field enhancement factor may be affected by a quantum effect due to the work function difference between the emitters and anode, especially when the work function of the field emitter (i.e., CNT emitters) is higher than that of the anode (i.e., W-probe) [19].|$|R
