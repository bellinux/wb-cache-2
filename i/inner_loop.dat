40|$|Modern {{high-level}} synthesis (HLS) tools commonly employ pipelin-ing {{to achieve}} efficient loop acceleration by overlapping the exe-cution of successive loop iterations.

To overcome this ma-jor limitation, we propose ElasticFlow, a novel architectural syn-thesis approach capable of dynamically distributing <b>inner</b> <b>loops</b> to {{an array of}} loop processing units (LPUs) in a complexity-effective manner. These LPUs can be either specialized to execute an indi-vidual loop or shared amongst multiple <b>inner</b> <b>loops</b> for area reduc-tion.

25|$|Two of {{the major}} {{projects}} the Federal City Council pushed for in the 1960s were <b>Inner</b> <b>Loop</b> highway system and its associated Three Sisters Bridge, and the Washington Metro subway system. The <b>Inner</b> <b>Loop</b> was strongly opposed by local citizens, who felt it was unnecessary, destroyed many neighborhoods, and despoiled the environment. However, Representative William Natcher, chairman of the Subcommittee on Appropriations for the District of Columbia of the House Committee on Appropriations, {{was not only a}} strong advocate of bridge and highway construction but also convinced that construction of the <b>Inner</b> <b>Loop</b> was essential to the growth of the District of Columbia. The Federal City Council, too, advocated the <b>Inner</b> <b>Loop</b> {{as a response to the}} flight of retail and light industry for the suburbs (a trend which began in the 1950s). The organization believed that quick and easy automobile access to the city (with lots of inexpensive parking) would draw shoppers and retailers back. A large subway system was equally important, as the Federal City Council concluded that surface transit alone could not meet the needs of the rapidly growing D.C. metropolitan area. The organization pushed hard for construction of Metro even though Representative Natcher threatened to cancel the subway project if the <b>Inner</b> <b>Loop</b> was not constructed. The organization also wished to ensure that wealthier suburbanites would be able to reach the downtown D.C. shopping district, in the hopes this would reverse or at least stop the flight of retail out of the city.|$|E

40|$|AbstractA domain {{decomposition}} method (DDM) {{is presented to}} solve the distributed optimal control problem. The optimal control problem essentially couples an elliptic partial differential equation {{with respect to the}} state variable and a variational inequality with respect to the constrained control variable. The proposed algorithm, called SA–GP algorithm, consists of two iterative stages. In the <b>inner</b> <b>loops,</b> the Schwarz alternating method (SA) is applied to solve the state and co-state variables, and in the outer loops the gradient projection algorithm (GP) is adopted to obtain the control variable. Convergence of iterations depends on both the outer and the <b>inner</b> <b>loops,</b> which are coupled and affected by each other. In the classical iteration algorithms, a given tolerance would be reached after sufficiently many iteration steps, but more iterations lead to huge computational cost. For solving constrained optimal control problems, most of the computational cost is used to solve PDEs. In this paper, a proposed iterative number independent of the tolerance is used in the <b>inner</b> <b>loops</b> so as to save a lot of computational cost. The convergence rate of L 2 -error of control variable is derived. Also the analysis on how to choose the proposed iteration number in the <b>inner</b> <b>loops</b> is given. Some numerical experiments are performed to verify the theoretical results...|$|R

40|$|Tiling {{is a key}} {{technique}} to enhance data reuse. For computations structured as one sequential outer “time” loop enclosing a set of parallel <b>inner</b> <b>loops,</b> tiling only the parallel <b>inner</b> <b>loops</b> may not enable enough data reuse in the cache. Tiling the <b>inner</b> <b>loops</b> along with the outer time loop enhances data locality but may require other transformations like loop skewing that inhibit inter-tile parallelism. One approach to tiling that enhances data locality without inhibiting inter-tile parallelism is split tiling, where tiles are subdivided into a sequence of trapezoidal computation steps. In this paper, we develop an approach to generate split tiled code for GPUs in the PPCG polyhedral code generator. We propose a generic algorithm to calculate index-set splitting that enables us to perform tiling for locality and synchronization avoidance, while simultaneously maintaining parallelism, {{without the need for}} skewing or redundant computations. Our algorithm performs split tiling for an arbitrary number of dimensions and without the need to construct any large integer linear program. The method and its implementation are evaluated on standard stencil kernels and compared with a state-of-the-art polyhedral compiler and with a domain-specific stencil compiler, both targeting CUDA GPUs...|$|R
