The {{objective}} was to evaluate industrial and research slaughter methods for Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar), <b>gilt-head</b> <b>seabream</b> (<b>Sparus</b> <b>auratus)</b> and eel (Anguilla anguilla) with respect to welfare and quality. As a general term of reference, an optimal slaughter method should render fish unconscious until death without avoidable excitement, pain or suffering prior to killing. For Atlantic salmon, commercial slaughter methods (carbon dioxide stunning followed by gill cutting, and gill cutting alone) are not in conformity with the general term of reference, as the fish are not rendered unconscious immediately and possibly experience stress. Evaluation of automated percussive stunning remained unconclusive. More research should enable us to ascertain whether loss of consciousness is instantaneous. Electrical stunning can be humane if applied properly. However, because flesh of electrostunned fish was characterized by occasional bloodspots, optimization of the electrical parameters is required. Prototypes for percussive and electrical stunning of salmon have been recently developed. This implies that humane slaughter of salmon is feasible for industry. For gilt-head seabream, neither aphyxia in air nor transfer of the fish to an ice slurry {{were considered to be}} humane: the methods did not induce immediate brain dysfunction and vigorous attempts to escape occurred. Percussive and electrical stunning can be in conformity with the general term of reference. However, conditions for stunning whole batches of seabream have not been established. Quality of the fish slaughtered by percussive stunning was similar to that obtained by the industrial method, i. e. immersion in an ice slurry. Further work is required to establish optimal stunning conditions and to develop prototypes. For eel, desliming in a salt-bath followed by evisceration, electrical stunning performed under the conditions prescribed by the German legislation, and live chilling and freezing were not considered to be humane.

40|$|The {{behavior}} of the natural microflora of Mediterannean <b>gilt-head</b> <b>seabream</b> (<b>Sparus</b> aurata) was monitored during aerobic storage at different isothermal conditions from 0 to 15 °C. The growth data of pseudomonads, established as the specific spoilage organisms of aerobically stored <b>gilt-head</b> <b>seabream,</b> combined with data from previously published experiments, were used to model the effect of temperature on pseudomonad growth using a Belehradek type model. The nominal minimum temperature parameters of the Belehradek model (Tmin) for the maximum specific growth rate (μmax) and the lag phase (tLag) were determined to be − 11. 8 and − 12. 8 °C, respectively. The applicability of the model in predicting pseudomonad growth on fish at fluctuating temperatures was evaluated by comparing predictions with observed growth in experiments under dynamic conditions. Temperature scenarios designed in the laboratory and simulation of real temperature profiles observed in the fish chill chain were used. Bias and accuracy factors were used as comparison indices and ranged from 0. 91 to 1. 17 and from 1. 11 to 1. 17, respectively. The average percent difference between shelf life predicted based on pseudomonad growth and shelf life experimentally determined by sensory analysis for all temperature profiles tested was 5. 8 %, indicating that the model is able to predict accurately fish quality in real-world conditions...|$|R
40|$|The {{applicability}} of time temperature integrators (TTI) as effective tools of chill chain monitoring was assessed. Validated kinetic models of pseudomonads growth of Mediterranean, marine-cultured chilled <b>gilt-head</b> <b>seabream</b> (<b>Sparus</b> aurata) and full {{knowledge of the}} response of suitable enzymatic TTI are {{the basis of the}} TTI application algorithm. This scheme was evaluated through a controlled field test of exported fish, from harvest to final consumption. Response of TTI attached on different locations of packages was compared to actual temperature recording. Data that could not be obtained during the actual field test, such as microbiological or sensory tests of fish at intermediate points of the chain, were measured in a replicate laboratory study, simulating the handling of products and the real time-temperature profiles of the field test. The conducted field tests showed the applicability and usefulness of TTI monitoring of the fish chill chain, elucidating also the practical difficulties and limitations, {{that need to be addressed}} for expanding TTI use as a reliable management tool.

Microsatellites and AFLPs are being {{widely used in}} aquaculture to assign fish or processed fish products, to their claimed origin, paternity or strain. In the present study, 147 AFLP and 4 microsatellite markers were used as genetic tags in gilthead <b>seabream,</b> <b>Sparus</b> <b>auratus.</b> Specimens from two different hatchery broodstocks (one of Atlantic and one of Mediterranean origin) and wild fishes from a natural population were. ngerprinted. Putative offspring from these broodstocks were computer-generated, and the confidence in the parentage assignment of their genetic profiles to the hatchery broodstock assessed. The virtual offspring were then mixed with specimens from a natural population to simulate an accidental escape from a floating cage. The risk of false paternity inclusion was evaluated to test the ability to identify either Atlantic or Mediterranean hatchery offspring among wild fish. The method proved to be reliable, and could therefore be used to forecast the impact of fish farm escapees...|$|R
40|$|The {{main source}} of calcium {{carbonate}} (CaCO 3) in the ocean comes from the shells of calcifying planktonic organisms, but substantial amounts of CaCO 3 are also produced in fish intestines. The precipitation of CaCO 3 assists fish in intestinal water absorption and aids in whole body Ca 21 homeostasis. Here we report that the product formed in the intestinal lumen of the <b>gilt-head</b> <b>seabream,</b> <b>Sparus</b> aurata, is an amorphous calcium carbonate (ACC) phase. With FTIR spectroscopy and SEM imaging, our study shows that the fish-derived carbonates from S. aurata are maintained as a stable amorphous phase throughout the intestinal tract. Moreover, intestinal deposits contained up to 54 mol%Mg 21, the highest concentration yet reported in biogenic ACC. Mg ismost likely responsible for stabilizing this inherently unstablemineral. The fish carbonates also displayed initial rapid dissolution when exposed to seawater, exhibiting {{a significant increase in}} carbonate concentration. E lemental production and cycling in our oceans are among the most important processes in the support of marine life. Elements such as Ca 21 and Mg 21, in addition to their substantial contribution to marine sediments, are used biologically in vital cellular processes and in the mineralization of skeletons and shells, made of calcium carbonate (CaCO 3) 1.

40|$|Phenols are plant {{metabolites}} characterised {{by several}} interesting bioactive properties such as antioxidant and bactericidal activities. In this study {{the application of}} a phenols concentrate (PC) from olive vegetation water to two different fresh products – <b>gilt-head</b> <b>seabream</b> (<b>Sparus</b> aurata) and chicken breast – was described. Products were treated in a bath of PC (22 g/L; chicken breast) or sprayed with two different solutions (L 1 : 0. 75 and L 2 : 1. 5 mg/mL; seabream) and then stored under refrigeration conditions. The shelf life was monitored through microbiological analyses – quality index method for seabream and a specific sensory index for raw breast. The secondary products of lipid-peroxidation of the chicken breast were determined using the thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARs) test on cooked samples. Multivariate statistical techniques were adopted to investigate the impact of phenols and microbiological data were fitted by DMfit software. In seabream, the levels of PC did not highlight any significant difference on microbiological and sensory features. DMfit models suggested an effect only on H 2 S producing bacteria with an increased lag phase compared to the control samples (C: 87 h vs L 2 : 136 h). The results on chicken breast showed that the PC bath clearly modified the growth of Pseudomonas and Enterobacteriaceae. The phenol dipping was effective in limiting lipid-peroxidation (TBARs) after cooking. Treated samples disclosed an increase of shelf life of 2 days. These could be considered as preliminary findings suggesting the use of this concentrate as preservative in some fresh products...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{reports on}} the {{presence}} of the conus arteriosus {{in the heart of the}} adult gilthead <b>seabream,</b> <b>Sparus</b> <b>auratus</b> (Perciformes, Teleostei). The junctional region between the single ventricle and the bulbus arteriosus has been studied by conventional light microscopy, and by scanning and transmission electron microscopy. In addition, fluorescent phalloidin and antibodies against the muscle myosin heavy chains, laminin and collagen type IV have been used. The conus arteriosus is a distinct muscular segment interposed between the ventricle and the bulbus arteriosus. It is clearly different from the bulbus arteriosus due to its myocardial nature. It can also be distinguished from the ventricular myocardium because: (1) it has a conus shape; (2) it is formed by compact, well-vascularized myocardium; (3) it is surrounded on its inner and outer faces by fibrous layers rich in collagen and elastin; (4) it constitutes the anatomical support of the so-termed conus valves; (5) it shows intense staining for laminin and type-IV collagen; and (6) the myocardial cells located close to the inner fibrous layer are helicoidally arranged. By contrast, the ventricular myocardium is highly trabecular, lacks a compacta, shows no vessels, and presents barely detectable amounts of laminin and collagen type IV. The presence of a distinct conus arteriosus in the heart of an evolutionary advanced teleost species indicates that the conus is not a vestigial segment from the evolutionary or embryological points of view. The characteristic spatial arrangement of the conus myocytes strongly suggests that the conus is implicated in the mechanical performance of the conus valves...|$|R
40|$|Iodothyronine deiodinases {{catalyze}} {{the conversion}} of the thyroid prohormone T 4 to T 3 by outer ring deiodination (ORD) of the iodothyronine molecule. The catalytic cycle of deiodinases is considered to be critically dependent on a reducing thiol cosubstrate that regenerates the selenoenzyme to its native state. The endogenous cosubstrate has still not been firmly identified; in studies in vitro the sulfhydryl reagent dithiothreitol (DTT) is commonly used to activate ORD. We now have characterized an ORD activity in the teleost gilthead <b>seabream</b> (<b>Sparus</b> <b>auratus)</b> that is inhibited by DTT. DTT inhibited reverse T 3 (rT 3) ORD by 70 and 100 % in kidney homogenates (IC 50 0. 4 mmol/liter) and microsomes (IC 50 0. 1 mmol/liter), respectively. The omission of DTT from the incubation medium restored renal ORD Michaelis-Menten kinetics with a Michaelis constant value of 5 �mol/liter rT 3 and THE CONVERSION, by outer ring deiodination (ORD), of the thyroid hormone T 4 to the potent and biologically active T 3 is an important activation pathway in the metabolism of thyroid hormones. ORD occurs mainly in peripheral tissues, of which liver and kidney are most important, and is catalyzed by the enzymatic action of iodothyronine deiodinases. Deiodinases constitute a family of at least three distinctly different selenoenzymes, designated D 1, D 2, and D 3. In the catalytic site of the D 1 protein, a selenocysteine residue functions as acceptor for the iodonium ion that is liberated from the iodothyronine substrate during catalysis. The catalytic cycle is completed by the reduction of the substituted enzyme intermediate by a thiol cosubstrate, which returns the selenocysteine to its native state and thus regenerates the enzyme molecul...|$|R

The omission of DTT from the incubation medium restored renal ORD Michaelis-Menten kinetics with a Michaelis constant value of 5 mumol/liter rT(3) and unmasked the inhibition by 6 -n-propyl- 2 -thiouracil. A putative seabream deiodinase type 1 (saD 1), derived from kidney mRNA, showed high homology (> or = 41 % amino acid identity) with vertebrate deiodinases type 1. Features of this putative saD 1 include a selenocysteine encoded by an in-frame UGA codon, consensus sequences, and a predicted secondary structure for a selenocysteine insertion sequence and an amino acid composition of the catalytic center that is identical with reported consensus sequences for deiodinase type 1. Remarkably, three of six cysteines that are present in the deduced saD 1 protein occur in the predicted amino terminal hydrophobic region. We suggest that the effects of DTT on rT(3) ORD can be explained by interactions with the cysteines unique to the putative saD 1 protein. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|The conus (bulbo-ventricular) valves of teleosts {{perform a}} key {{function}} in the control of blood backflow during ventricular diastole. However, the structural characteristics of these valves are almost unknown. This paper presents a systematic anatomical, histological and structural study of the conus valves of the adult gilthead <b>seabream</b> (<b>Sparus</b> <b>auratus).</b> S. auratus shows two major left and right valves consisting of the leaflet and the supporting sinus. Each valvar leaflet {{can be divided into}} a stout proximal body and a flap-like distal region. The proximal body is structured into three layers: a luminal fibrosa, a dense cellular core and a parietal fibrosa. The luminal fibrosa is a collagenous structure extending {{the entire length of the}} leaflet, while the parietal fibrosa is restricted to the most proximal area. The dense cellular core consists of fibroblastic cells and a matrix rich in glycoconjugates, collagen and elastin. The histochemical and structural data suggest that the luminal fibrosa bears most of the force associated with valvar closure, while the cellular core acts as a cushion dampening vibrations and absorbing the elastic recoil. The sinus wall is a fibrous layer which shows proximal–distal differences in thickness. It also shows compositional differences that can be related to mechanical function. We describe the presence of a fibrous cylinder formed by the sinus wall, the fibrous interleaflet triangles and the fibrous layer that covers the inner surface of the conus myocardium. This fibrous cylinder constitutes the structural nexus between the ventricle, the conus and the bulbus arteriosus, provides support for the conus valves and separates the valvar complex from the surrounding tissues. The structure of the conus valves in S. auratus is different from that found in other vertebrates. Anatomical similarities between the conus valves and the mammalian arterial valves are emphasized. Each phyletic group appears to have developed specific structures in order to perform similar functions...|$|R
30|$|Results of the grow-out {{experiment}} indicated significant stock {{effects for}} all body size parameters. In particular, fillet weight varied significantly from 478.8 [*]±[*] 13.32  g to 569.2 [*]±[*] 12.27  g over {{the size range}} (960 – 1190  g) of fish examined. The CHAC stock exhibited greater total and fillet weights than the other stocks, but had the lowest fillet yield (47.3 %). Interestingly, three stocks (CHON, CHUM and SAMU) exhibited similar weight were found to differ in fillet yields, among which CHON had the highest fillet percentage (49.88 %). Such differences could result from variations in body shape among populations likely due to genetic composition and effects of selection within stocks. Differences in fillet yields (31 – 38 %) between strains of Nile tilapia have been reported (Rutten et al. 2004; Peterman and Phelps 2012). Fillet percentages of Asian sea bass (47.3 – 49.8 %) were similar to fillet yields observed in hybrid striped bass (49.7 %) (Bosworth et al. 1998). This is not surprising as both species are anadromous perciformes fish, having slightly compressed, streamlined body shapes. In other species, fillet percentages varied from 35 % for river catfish Pangasianodon hypophthalmus (Sang et al. 2009) and gilthead <b>seabream</b> <b>Sparus</b> <b>auratus</b> (Navarro et al. 2009) to 32 – 41 % for common carp (Kocour et al. 2007; Bauer and Schlott 2009) and 42 % for channel catfish (Argue et al. 2003). Fillet yields were as high as 58 % for Coho salmon Oncorhynchus kisutch (Neira et al. 2004), 64 % for rainbow trout O. mykiss (Kause et al. 2002), and 69 % for Atlantic salmon Salmo salar (Powell et al. 2008). In giant freshwater prawn Macrobrachium rosenbergii, a meat yield of 45 % was reported (Hung and Nguyen 2014). With regard to phenotypic correlations among growth metrics, fillet weight was closely related to fish weight, as well as standard length and body measurements, while there were weak correlations between fillet yield and fish size. Results were mostly in agreement with other previous studies, in that high correlations between fillet weight and total weight suggest that growing fish to a larger size is {{an efficient way to}} increase fillet weight.|$|R

Sustained elevated blood cortisol levels, induced either by cortisol injection or conWnement stress, suppressed circulating PTHrP 6 and 24 -fold,respectively, by comparison to control Wsh. reduced cortisol levels, prevented the decrease of plasma PTHrP observed in conWned Wsh and raised plasma PTHrPrespectively, by comparison to control fish...|$|R
40|$|Prey size {{selectivity}} in piscivorous fish larvae {{is important}} to both aquaculture and fisheries science, but laboratory experiments are few. We analyzed selective foraging in Atlantic bluefin tuna larvae (Thunnus thynnus) using two larval fish prey species. The experiments revealed that selective foraging of prey sizes differed among bluefin tuna predator sizes (15 – 25 mm SL) and prey species, bonito (Sarda sarda) and <b>seabream</b> (<b>Sparus</b> aurata). The observed pattern suggest a general preference for small bonito prey larvae but large seabream prey. Thus, prey size alone {{is not the only}} trait responsible for size selectivity in piscivorous fish larvae. Postprint 1, 749...|$|R
40|$|Five {{independent}} {{data sets}} were analyzed {{to assess whether}} growth and survival differ among different strains of gilthead <b>seabream,</b> <b>Sparus</b> aurata, under captive culture conditions. Differences were detected and we deduced (a) inferior performance of a wild strain relative to a hatchery strain; (b) lack of evidence for substantial heterosis in our particular strains; (c) a slight trend among the larger fish to undergo sex reversal from male to female, and that sex effects {{should be considered in}} future growth analyses. There were no detectable detrimental effects of PIT (passive integrated transponders) tagging on a range ol S. aurata size classe...|$|R
40|$|The {{present study}} aimed to {{describe}} the reproductive behaviour of gilthead <b>seabream</b> (<b>Sparus</b> aurata) in captivity. Twenty-four mature gilthead seabream, divided in two tanks, were utilized for the present study. Reproductive behaviour was recorded using submersibles cameras. A total of 67 spawning events were analysed. The mean duration time that gilthead seabream spent spawning was 54 ± 4 min/day, during which mean number of individual spawning events was 5. 6 ± 0. 2. The mean volume of eggs produced by both broodstocks was 405 ± 13. 4 mL with a fertilization rate of 91. 6 ± 0. 4...|$|R
40|$|In {{a widely}} {{distributed}} and commercially important fish, gilthead <b>seabream</b> <b>Sparus</b> aurata L., we have studied sublethal effects of malathion {{in order to}} identify early warning bioindicators of exposure before irreversible damage occurs. To achieve this goal, groups of 10 juvenile specimens were exposed for 24, 48, 72 and 96 h to a sublethal concentration of malathion (0. 4 mg/l). Another group was used as control. The activity of antioxidant enzymes (superoxide dismutase, catalase and glutathione peroxidase) and histopathological features from exposed gills were assessed. It should also be mentioned that no mortality was observed during the whole experience. The activity of superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT) and glutathione peroxidase (GPX) were altered significantly from 24 h onward (p< 0. 05). It is of interest to note that catalase activity was decreased after exposure instead of increasing as other antioxidant enzymes assessed. On the other hand, histopathological alterations of the gills were observed as early as at 48 h-exposure, but the most severe damage occurred at 96 h exposure. The evidence presented here, together with other data from the literature, unequivocally established oxidative-stress-inducing effects of malathion in gilthead <b>seabream</b> <b>Sparus</b> aurata. It is also concluded antioxidants employed (SOD, CAT and GPX) changed significantly a long time before histopathological alterations of gills became evident. Consequently, these antioxidant enzymes may be highly recommended as early-warning bioindicators of environmental pollution by malathion in the areas where it is proposed to be used in pest control activities...|$|R
40|$|Anesthesia may depress {{the immune}} system in mammals and fish. In the present work, two anesthetics used in aquaculture, clove oil (0. 445 mM) and {{benzocaine}} (0. 225 mM), were tested to observe their effects on the stress response and innate immune system activity of gilthead <b>seabream</b> (<b>Sparus</b> aurata L.). Results showed that both anesthetics induced increased blood glucose and serum cortisol levels. In addition, benzocaine depressed lysozyme activity, produc- tion of reactive oxygen species and pinocytosis activity. These were not depressed by clove oil, suggesting that clove oil is a safer anesthetic for seabream as it does not cause immunode- pression in anesthetized fish...|$|R
