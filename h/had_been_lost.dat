5|$|A {{large number}} of {{soldiers}} {{who died in the}} war were never found, and similarly bodies were recovered that could not be identified; once again, this required new forms of memorial. The scale of the issue was once again huge: 73,000 Allied dead were never found at the Somme, for example, either because their bodies <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>lost,</b> destroyed or were unrecognisable, more than one in ten of the losses in the battle.|$|E
5|$|About 100 {{separate}} {{stations for}} box huckleberry {{have been documented}} in the scientific literature. By the time of Baird's collection in 1845, the West Virginia stations of the plant <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>lost</b> to science, and his Pennsylvania colony {{was the only one}} known for some time. Specimens of box huckleberry were subsequently identified in Delaware in 1870, by William M. Canby.|$|E

5|$|Dickens was not {{the first}} author to {{celebrate}} the Christmas season in literature. Among earlier authors who influenced Dickens was Washington Irving, whose 1819–20 work The Sketch Book of Geoffrey Crayon, Gent. included four essays on old English Christmas traditions that he experienced while staying at Aston Hall near Birmingham. The tales and essays attracted Dickens, and the two authors shared the belief that the staging of a nostalgic English Christmas might help restore the social harmony that <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>lost</b> in the modern world.|$|E
5|$|In 1906, {{a survey}} of church plate within the Bangor diocese {{recorded}} that St Nidan's had a silver chalice and alms dish. These were donated probably in 1701 and remade in 1871–72. It also had a silver paten and two cruets with silver handles, all marked with the date 1871–72. Records from the 19th century indicated that two tankards (one silver, one pewter) and a silver chalice <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>lost.</b>|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to his colonization policies, Stephen restored Crown lands that <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>lost</b> {{during the civil war}} that followed Alexander the Good's rule, either through buying or confiscating them. On the other hand, he granted much landed property to the Church and to the lesser noblemen who were the main supporters of the central government. His itinerant lifestyle enabled him to personally hold court in the whole of Moldavia, which contributed to the development of his authority.|$|E

Neither the crew nor the aircraft's communication systems relayed a distress signal, indications of bad weather, or technical problems before the aircraft vanished from radar screens.|$|E
5|$|Nevertheless, {{the affair}} brought such a shock {{that people were}} sobered. The legal battle <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>lost,</b> the {{railroad}} had won, {{and there was not}} enough public support for changing the policy of granting public lands to railroads. The only concession SP made was to reduce the land price slightly. In the end, most people simply stayed where they were and purchased the land.|$|E
5|$|On August 8, 2007, along {{a remote}} shore of Lake Superior on the Keweenaw Peninsula, a Michigan family {{discovered}} a lone life-saving ring {{that appeared to}} have come from Fitzgerald.

Later it was determined that the life ring was not from Fitzgerald, but <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>lost</b> by the owner, whose father had made it as a personal memorial.|$|E

5|$|Sultan Mehmed II died on 3 May 1481. A {{civil war}} ensued in the Ottoman Empire between his sons Bayezid II and Cem. Defeated, Cem fled to Rhodes, where the Knights Hospitaller {{kept him in}} custody. Matthias claimed Cem's custody {{in the hope of}} using him to gain {{concessions}} from Bayezid, but Venice and Pope Innocent VIII strongly opposed this plan. In late 1481, Hungarian auxiliary troops supported Matthias's father-in-law Ferdinand I of Naples to reoccupy Otranto, which <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>lost</b> to the Ottomans the year before.|$|E
5|$|The {{design for}} the Königsbergs was {{prepared}} in 1913.

5|$|The {{following}} year the Muslims launched an offensive into the Arabah south of Lake Tiberias, taking Al Karak. Other raids penetrated into the Negev reaching {{as far as}} Gaza. The Battle of Yarmouk in 636 resulted in a crushing defeat for the larger Byzantine army; within three years, the Levant <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>lost</b> again. By the time of Heraclius's death in Constantinople, on February 11, 641, most of Egypt had fallen as well.|$|E
