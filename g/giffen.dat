5|$|Murdoch, Percy McDonnell and <b>Giffen</b> all scored 1,000 {{runs for}} the Australians in the 1884 season while Scott, Bannerman and Bonnor topped 900. Murdoch scored two centuries {{including}} his 211 at the Oval; <b>Giffen,</b> McDonnell and Scott one apiece. The outstanding bowler, as on previous tours, was Spofforth who took 205 wickets for the Australians {{at an average of}} 12.50 with a best performance of 8/62. Palmer took 130 wickets at 16.14 and the other main bowlers were <b>Giffen</b> (81 wickets) and Boyle (62). Midwinter took 15 wickets while the other players bowled occasionally only. Blackham was the wicket-keeper in 28 out of the 31 first-class matches, Murdoch standing in for him in the other three. Blackham held 23 catches and completed 16 stumpings. Eight fielders held more than twenty catches each, the most being Bonnor's 31.|$|E
5|$|Believing {{the attack}} was over, <b>Giffen</b> ordered his ships to cease zigzagging and {{continue}} towards Guadalcanal on the same course {{and at the same}} speed. Meanwhile, a Japanese reconnaissance aircraft began dropping flares and floatlights to mark the course and speed of TF18 for the impending attack by Hagai's bombers.|$|E
5|$|In his history, Harry Altham {{wrote that}} the 1884 Australians have been equated with the 1882 team but he himself {{disagreed}} with that assessment. He added that George <b>Giffen</b> considered England's team in the final Test {{to have been the}} strongest of the nineteenth century.|$|E
5|$|During the {{following}} summer, Trott again {{acted as a}} Test selector, along with the incumbent Test captain George <b>Giffen</b> and former captain Percy McDonnell. When choosing the Australian team for the previous tour of England, <b>Giffen</b> used his influence to ensure the selection of his younger brother, Walter. The team chosen for the 1896 tour of England included a number of promising young players, including Joe Darling and Clem Hill, both of whom went on to captain Australia. Albert Trott was a controversial omission, in light of performances in the previous Ashes series, but he accompanied the team on their voyage and later settled in England. He had a successful career with Middlesex and appeared for England in two Test matches against South Africa. The cricket historian David Frith records that when the Trott brothers encountered each other on an English street, they merely exchanged acknowledging nods and kept walking.|$|E
5|$|The left-handed Darling was {{a strong}} driver of the ball who showed the batsman the full face of the bat. When necessary, he was a dour defender of his wicket. His fellow players thought that was {{sometimes}} unnecessarily defensive in his approach to batting {{and that he was}} at his best when driving hard. His South Australian and Australian team mate George <b>Giffen</b> thought that no Australian's cut shots travelled faster past point.|$|E
5|$|The {{next ten}} matches {{prior to the}} Old Trafford Test were played mainly {{in the north of}} England and the Australians did very well in this period, through June and into early July. They lost only to the North by an innings at Old Trafford when their batting {{struggled}} against Ted Peate and Ulyett while good scores by A. N. Hornby and Barnes ensured the North's victory. <b>Giffen</b> had a memorable game when the Australians played Lancashire at Old Trafford, taking a hat trick in the Lancashire innings and then scoring 113. That match was drawn but the Australians defeated both Nottinghamshire and Yorkshire by the same three-wicket margin. Spofforth, Palmer, Peate and Tom Emmett dominated the match at Bradford in which only 255 runs were scored in total. At Trent Bridge, the bowling of <b>Giffen</b> and Palmer enabled the Australians to recover from a first innings deficit of 39 and win. In the return match against the Gentlemen at the Oval, the last three English batsmen including Lord Harris were all stumped by Jack Blackham.|$|E
5|$|Trumble was {{particularly}} effective in England. After taking 52wickets {{on his first}} tour of England in 1890, his other four visits to England—in 1893, 1896, 1899 and 1902—saw him take over 100wickets in first-class matches. In 1899, he scored 1,183runs making him one of only four Australians, with George <b>Giffen,</b> Warwick Armstrong (both three times) and Jack Gregory, to take over 100wickets and make over 1,000runs {{on a tour of}} England.|$|E
5|$|The tour began {{well for}} the Australians with an innings victory in their opening match at Uckfield against a team chosen by Lord Sheffield which {{included}} W. G. Grace, George Ulyett, Billy Barnes, Alfred Shaw and Arthur Shrewsbury. Although Fred Spofforth, Harry Boyle and Billy Midwinter were all playing, the Australian bowling was performed by George <b>Giffen</b> and Joey Palmer only, and they both took ten wickets in the match. However, the key performance in conditions that helped the bowling was Alick Bannerman's innings of 94 which alone outscored the Sheffield XI's first innings total of 86.|$|E
5|$|When the Fifth Australians toured England in 1886, {{the team}} was {{selected}} and managed by the Melbourne Club which was mindful of the past controversy. As a result, Murdoch, McDonnell and Bannerman were omitted despite still being leading batsmen. Boyle was unavailable, as were Horan and Massie who had toured in 1882, while Alexander, Cooper and Midwinter were no longer in contention for places. Scott was appointed captain and the other survivors of 1884 were Blackham, Bonnor, <b>Giffen,</b> Palmer and Spofforth.|$|E
5|$|An {{innings of}} 60 by Lord Harris helped Kent {{recover from a}} first innings deficit before the Australians, batting last, {{collapsed}} to lose by 96 runs at Canterbury. The first match against Gloucestershire was drawn, W. G. Grace scoring 116 not out for his county. The Australians won the second match convincingly with an innings total of 402 (<b>Giffen</b> 91, Billy Murdoch 89) before dismissing Gloucestershire for only 83. This began a good finish to the tour as the Australians won five of the last seven matches following the third Test. They twice defeated the South by an innings, Spofforth taking a total of 24 wickets in these two matches, but were again beaten by the North, for whom Dick Barlow scored a century and took ten wickets in the match.|$|E
5|$|Beginning {{their second}} innings after lunch, {{there was a}} little {{improvement}} for the Smokers, though six of the team were dismissed without reaching double figures. Gunn top-scored for his side, remaining 43 not {{out at the end of}} the innings, while Charles Thornton and George <b>Giffen</b> both scored quickly, making 27 and 15 respectively. Despite these scores, the Smokers only reached 152, leaving the Non-Smokers needing 14 runs to win the match. Grace collected three further wickets in this second innings, but he was bettered by Barlow, who took five for 24. Although the match was past half past five in the evening with poor light, the decision was made that the match should not continue into the following day, and so the Non-Smokers came out to bat and hit the runs they required, reaching the total shortly after six o'clock. The match was played at Lord's in good weather on both days, and was well attended on the first day, with between six and seven thousand spectators at the ground.|$|E
5|$|Halcombe {{grew up in}} South Australia, {{and studied}} at St Peter's College, Adelaide in his youth. There he earned the {{attention}} of cricket watchers for his skill and his suspect action. Halcombe was suspected of throwing, meaning an illegal bowling action in which a player straightens his arm {{in the process of}} delivering the ball, thereby throwing it, whereas the laws of cricket required that a bowler did not change the angle of his elbow in delivering the ball. In 1923, while still a schoolboy, he was observed by former England captain Archie MacLaren (who was currently visiting Australia as part of the Marylebone Cricket Club team) and former Australia captain and all rounder George <b>Giffen.</b> To test the legitimacy of Halcombe's action, his wrist, forearm and elbow were encased in splints, so that he could not move his elbow position. He delivered balls at varying speeds, and the experts failed to detect an illegal action.|$|E
5|$|On 26 March, Wichita, {{assigned}} to Task Force 39, departed the United States {{to reinforce the}} British Home Fleet based in Scapa Flow. Task Force 39, commanded by Rear Admiral John W. Wilcox, Jr., included Wasp, the battleship , the cruiser Tuscaloosa, and eight destroyers. While en route, Wilcox was swept overboard in a heavy sea and lost. Rear Admiral Robert C. <b>Giffen,</b> who flew his flag in Wichita, took command of the task force. After arriving in Scapa Flow, Wichita and the other American ships spent several weeks training with their British counterparts. On 28 April, Wichita departed on her first major operation with the British. She was {{assigned to}} the Allied escort for the Arctic convoys QP 11 and PQ 15. The American component, organized as Task Force 99, comprised Washington, Wichita, Tuscaloosa, and four destroyers. The British assigned the carrier , the battleship , a light cruiser, and five destroyers. After successfully escorting the convoys, Wichita returned to Hvalfjörður, arriving on 6 May.|$|E
5|$|On a small {{ground at}} Belmont, the September grass was coarse. It had been rolled {{so that the}} ball moved very quickly across the ground. The Australian side, fielding first, dropped many catches and could not cope with the short boundary, {{allowing}} the Philadelphians to reach a huge total of 525 runs. King came in to bat last, at number 11, making 36 runs. The leading Australian bowlers, Hugh Trumble and George <b>Giffen,</b> took 2 for 104 and 0 for 114 respectively. When the Australians came to bat, they hoped that they would, by now, have recovered from their tiring journey, but ran into problems when dealing with Bart King's developing swing bowling. The side was all out for 199, with King taking 5 wickets for 78 runs. The Australians followed on and were all out again for 268, allowing the Gentlemen of Philadelphia to win by an innings and 68 runs.|$|E
5|$|Marsh's third Sheffield Shield {{match was}} the return fixture against South Australia in January 1901 at the Sydney Cricket Ground (SCG); New South Wales {{reversed}} {{the result of}} the corresponding match three weeks earlier. South Australia batted first and were bowled out for 157, with Marsh taking the leading figures of 5/34. These included the prize wickets of Hill and George <b>Giffen,</b> Test players who went on to be inducted into the Australian Cricket Hall of Fame. New South Wales then piled on 918 before completing an innings victory by bowling the visitors out for 156 in the second innings. The margin of an innings and 605 runs set a new record for the largest victory in first-class history. Marsh took 5/59 and did the bulk of the damage, removing five of South Australia's top six specialist batsmen, at one stage reducing the visitors to 6/114. Marsh bowled six of his opponents and was not questioned by either umpire. At this point, Marsh led the first-class averages in bowling, with 21 wickets at a bowling average of 17.38 in three matches. The match was Marsh's career high point; it was to be the only ten-wicket match of his brief career.|$|E
25|$|<b>Giffen</b> {{goods are}} named after Scottish {{economist}} Sir Robert <b>Giffen,</b> to whom Alfred Marshall attributed this idea {{in his book}} Principles of Economics. <b>Giffen</b> first proposed the paradox from his observations of the purchasing habits of the Victorian era poor.|$|E

25|$|<b>Giffen</b> {{goods are}} {{difficult}} to study because the definition requires a number of observable conditions. One reason for the difficulty in studying market demand for <b>Giffen</b> goods that is <b>Giffen</b> originally envisioned a specific situation faced by individuals in poverty. Modern consumer behaviour research methods often deal in aggregates that average out income levels, and are too blunt an instrument to capture these specific situations. Complicating the matter are the requirements for limited availability of substitutes, {{as well as that}} the consumers are not so poor that they can only afford the inferior good. For this reason, many text books use the term <b>Giffen</b> paradox rather than <b>Giffen</b> good.|$|E
25|$|Another 2008 {{paper by}} the same authors {{experimentally}} demonstrated the existence of <b>Giffen</b> goods among people at the household level by directly subsidizing purchases of rice and wheat flour for extremely poor families. It is easier to find <b>Giffen</b> effects where the number of goods available is limited, as in an experimental economy: DeGrandpre et al. (1993) provide such an experimental demonstration. In 1991, Battalio, Kagel, and Kogut proved that quinine water is a <b>Giffen</b> good for some lab rats. However, they were only able to show {{the existence of a}} <b>Giffen</b> good at an individual level and not the market level.|$|E
25|$|Anthony Bopp (1983) {{proposed}} that kerosene, a low-quality fuel used in home heating, was a <b>Giffen</b> good. Schmuel Baruch and Yakar Kanai (2001) suggested that shochu, a Japanese distilled beverage, {{might be a}} <b>Giffen</b> good. In both cases, the authors offered supporting econometric evidence. However, the empirical evidence has been generally considered incomplete. In a 2005 article, Sasha Abramsky of The Nation conjectured that gasoline, in certain circumstances, may act as a <b>Giffen</b> good. However, no supporting evidence was offered, and evidence from the large increases in oil prices in 2008 would suggest that quantity demanded for gasoline did actually fall {{as a result of}} increased prices. Of course, the lack of evidence at the aggregate level does not rule out that the proposed goods may have been <b>Giffen</b> for certain groups of consumers—in particular for poor consumers.|$|E

25|$|Early in 1877 {{he played}} for South Australia against a visiting East Melbourne team making 16 and 14, {{the highest score in}} each innings, but South Australian cricket was then much below the {{standard}} of the two eastern colonies. In November 1877 he made his first-class cricket debut against Tasmania. <b>Giffen</b> made 47runs and took 4wickets for16 runs in the Tasmanian first innings. Tasmania was forced to follow-on (bat twice in a row) and in the second innings <b>Giffen</b> managed to capture another 2 wickets. It was not until November 1880 that the first regular match between South Australia and Victoria took place at Melbourne. <b>Giffen</b> made 3 and 63 and took two wickets for 47 in the first innings. In the follow-up match in Adelaide later that season, <b>Giffen</b> took 5wickets for 59runs (5/59); Victoria won the match by 151runs. He became a regular member of the South Australian team and although he took a few seasons to develop his full powers, if he failed as a bat he usually made up for it with a good bowling performance.|$|E
