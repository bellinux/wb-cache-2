40|$|High speed flow {{finishing}} {{method has}} recently developed, {{which has an}} excellent performance for polishing an inner wall of stainless steel capillary. However, its method seems to be unable to finish the inner wall of stainless steel pipe. Present paper focuses on the finishing of the inner wall of stainless steel curved pipe with high speed flow finishing method. It is found that an elastic string-type mandrel inserted into the hole of curved pipe has great performance on finishing, in which a <b>diameter</b> <b>of</b> <b>mandrel</b> is slightly smaller than hole size of the pipe. Experiments indicate that surface roughness of the inner wall of curved pipe decreases {{with the number of}} slurry flow pass. It is found that surface roughness of the inner wall of a 90 °curved pipe decreases with the number of slurry flow pass, however, it incresases inversely after 80 passes and peculiar roughness curve is generated.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} was to generate the knowledge required to: (1) design and manufacture fluid film bearings that do not require precision machining processes during fabrication, but rather gain their precision from off-the-shelf parts used in the fabrication process and (2) manufacture parts with 3 D internal networks by wrapping thin sheets of material containing 2 D through-cut features. This wrapping-based fabrication process, called Three-Dimensional Wrapped Network (3 DWN) technology, uses the precision of low-cost, ubiquitous items instead of manufacturing processes to meet the precision requirements of hydrostatic bearings. 3 DWN bearings are fabricated by cutting 2 D through-cut features into shim stock and then wrapping the shim stock around a precision mandrel. The 2 D shim stock features are designed such that they align and form 3 D internal networks within the bearing during wrapping.

40|$|The {{behaviour}} {{of saturated}} soft clays subjected to cyclic loading is of considerable {{importance in the}} design of railway subgrades. Soft clays can be extensively found in many coastal regions of Australia up to significant depths, including the coastal belt and the central part of NSW. These soft clay deposits are characterised by very low bearing capacity and excessive settlement. The increase in generated excess pore pressures due to heavy freight trains significantly reduces the bearing capacity and causes serious damage to the rail infrastructure such as clay pumping underneath railway tracks and excessive subsidence. The use of prefabricated vertical drains (PVDs) is one of the popular methods for soft ground improvement. In this paper, the behaviour of soft clay subjected to cyclic loads is investigated using large-scale triaxial tests. Cyclic triaxial tests on remoulded soft clay samples with and without vertical drains have been carried out using a large-scale triaxial apparatus designed and built at the University of Wollongong. It was found that the PVD under cyclic loading allows the generated cyclic excess pore pressures to dissipate during and after the cyclic load application. The extent of smear zone was approximately three times the equivalent <b>diameter</b> <b>of</b> the <b>mandrel</b> used during installation and is comparable to the generally accepted relationship between mandrel and smear produced under static loading.

An analytical model was derived to describe the transformation of 3 D cylindrical features to 2 D through-cut features. Conventional hydrostatic designs and theory were adapted for use in 3 DWN bearings. A proof-of-concept was designed, constructed, and tested.

40|$|Many {{existing}} railway bridges in Sweden {{are approaching}} their estimated life span. There {{is also a}} desire to increase their loads, the number of passages and the speed limit {{in order to meet}} current and future demands. To avoid demolishing fully functional bridges, the fatigue investigations on existing structures should give results that are close to reality. The regulations of today may condemn fully functioning bridges, even though only few of them show signs of fatigue. This thesis compares three fatigue models by assessing two slab frame railway bridges, one from 1972 and one from 1995. The fatigue models are based on the Swedish Code BBK 04, the Eurocode and the Fib Model Code 2010. The concrete and reinforcement in the bridges are assessed for bending and shear. The methods used are simplified models and cumulative damage analysis method. In most of the calculated cases, it is indicated that the bridges do not have enough fatigue capacity, even though there were no signs of fatigue registered during the latest inspection. The factors that give the highest impact on the fatigue capacity are the stress range, the number of load cycles, the <b>diameter</b> <b>of</b> the reinforcement and the <b>diameter</b> <b>of</b> the <b>mandrel</b> used for bending reinforcement. All the investigated fatigue models are affected by these factors. It is not possible to single out one model that in all cases give the lowest capacity, except in the cumulative damage analysis where the Fib Model Code 2010 give the highest capacity. For more accurate calculations the cumulative damage method is applied, where the actual number of load cycles is used. The calculations show that the analysis was in this case not the most favorable method to use on these short, slab frame bridges. Further research is needed {{to be able to make}} more accurate assessment of existing structures are investigated. The norms of today give too conservative results that do not reflect reality. Either improvement can be made by reducing the impact on the fatigue capacity of the above mentioned factors or by inventing completely new methods. Other questions to study are e. g the size of the stress ranges (calculation models, dynamic factor, monitoring) and number of load cycles for different stress ranges.

To this purpose, rigid-plastic model of deformed material was assumed. The analysis was realised for hollow tube made from steel C 45 with external diameter D 0 = 50 mm and internal one d 0 = 40 mm.

40|$|The {{build-up}} and {{redistribution of}} residual stresses obtained by stress coining of aluminium plates containing a hole {{have been studied}} experimentally and numerically. The foil strain gauge technique has been employed to measure strains at the bore of a hole {{during and after the}} coining process. The finite element method has been applied for the computations of displacements, strains and stresses. Both axi-symmetric and fully three-dimensional models were used in the finite element analyses. The coining process was found to create compressive residual hoop stresses at the bore of the hole with a magnitude primarily depending on the <b>diameter</b> <b>of</b> the <b>mandrel</b> used for the coining. Parameters of secondary importance were found to be the coining depth and the friction coefficient. Good agreement was obtained between the experimentally measured strains and the numerically calculated strains. A slight redistribution of the residual hoop stresses, leading to lower compressive values, at the bore of the hole was observed when the aluminium plates were subjected to a simulated alternating service load. The possible beneficial effect of coining on the fatigue life has been quantified by calculating the propagation of a quarter elliptical corner crack and a half elliptical central crack at the bore of a stress coined hole. Results for the crack growth obtained from the empirically based and frequently used Paris law were compared with results from a more complex relation which also models the observed crack growth near the threshold value. Pertinent stress intensity factors were derived by the use of the weight function technique. A significant reduction of the crack propagation rate was found for quarter elliptical corner cracks growing from a coined hole. The application of the coining technique is demonstrated on a typical ship structure. The finite element method was used to calculate the residual stresses at the corner of a longitudinal stiffener cut-out in a web-frame after fillet welding of the web-frame to the ship hull plating and after the coining process. It was found that the tensile residual welding stresses at the cut-out were reduced to almost zero by the coining process.
