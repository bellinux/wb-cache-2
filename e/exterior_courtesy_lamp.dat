50|$|Due to slowing {{sales and}} the {{imminent}} {{cancellation of the}} MN12 program, in 1997, Ford began cost-cutting measures and discontinued many convenience items, such as {{the elimination of the}} <b>courtesy</b> <b>lamps,</b> underhood light and glove box light. This was the last year for the MN12 Cougar, as Ford ultimately decided to discontinue its trio of personal luxury cars: the Mark VIII, the Cougar, and the Thunderbird to concentrate on production of high-profit SUVs.|$|R

Six body styles were now available with a hardtop version of the Luxury Sedan added to the lineup.

2500|$|The 1996 {{model year}} {{was the first time}} that the Taurus did not have an {{optional}} engine. The base G and GL had the 3.0L Vulcan V6, which was a carryover from the previous model. The top of the line LX, however, got the new 3.0L DOHC Duratec 30 V6, which produced [...] and was developed specifically for this model. When Ford rearranged the Taurus models for 1998, the Vulcan became the standard engine, and the Duratec became optional on all models. However, it was only available on the SE for 1999. Vulcan-equipped models came with the 4-speed AX4S automatic transmission, while Duratec equipped models got the 4-speed AX4N transmission. However, some Vulcan-equipped models randomly received the AX4N transmission for no apparent reason. Ford also deleted some features for the 1999 model year, in order to lower the price about one thousand dollars, and possibly boost sales. Some deleted features included the floor <b>courtesy</b> <b>lamps</b> and glove compartment lamp.|$|R

2500|$|For 1961 only, it {{was renamed}} Classic 98; nevertheless, most factory {{literature}} {{refers to the}} line as the Ninety-Eight. It offered five body styles. The sedan was now called the Town Sedan. The 4-door 4-window hardtop body style was now called the Sport Sedan instead of the Holiday Sedan. A new 4-door 6-window hardtop body style, previously exclusive to Cadillac and the Buick Electra was now offered and the Holiday Sedan name was transferred to it. This {{was the first time}} not all Oldsmobile hardtops were called Holidays. Overall sales plunged from 59,364 to 43,010, probably due to the introduction of the new Starfire series, the 98's low point following the production record set in 1955.

5000|$|As {{part of this}} update, officially {{known as}} the TJ MY02 series, side impact bars {{previously}} fitted only to export models were also introduced for Australian market cars, and the front doors now featured energy absorbing material. The Magna Executive received ABS and power windows as standard, while the Advance, Sports and VR-X were each fitted with a six speaker sound system (up from four), automatic climate control, front map lamps, glovebox lamp and power antenna. The Verada Xi's electric sunroof with front map lamps and C pillar <b>courtesy</b> <b>lamps</b> was now optional on all models. The Sports was further distanced from the VR-X by no longer sharing the same boot lid spoiler, but a smaller version (which became another optional accessory across the Magna range, and was fitted as standard on subsequent limited-run models, the Verada GTV and Diamante VR-X). Power for the standard (non [...] "high output") 3.5-litre V6 engine increased to [...] thanks to a higher compression ratio and a Karman Vortex airflow meter.

Moreover, the Ei was now fitted with a new chrome grille, while both the Ei and Xi received new design alloy-wheels and illuminated vanity mirrors. With this update all cars now had clear front turn bezels.|$|R
2500|$|In 1953 the Imperial {{model was}} renamed the Imperial Custom. Although the Imperial Custom resembled the New Yorker, {{it had a}} {{different}} wheelbase, taillights, and side trim. Clean front fenders and higher rear fender stone shield set it apart from the [...] "ordinary" [...] Chryslers. This {{was also the first}} year for the stylized eagle hood ornament. Power brakes, power windows, center folding armrests (front and rear) and a padded dash were standard. Parking lights on all Imperials were positioned between the top and center grille moldings, a variation from the design used on other Chrysler cars. A new model was the six-passenger Imperial Custom limousine which had as standard equipment electric windows, electric division window, floor level <b>courtesy</b> <b>lamps,</b> rear compartment heater, fold-up footrests, seatback mounted clock and special luxury cloth or leather interiors. On March 10, 1953, the exclusive Imperial Custom Newport hardtop was added to the Imperial line at $325 over the price of the eight-passenger sedan. The 2-door Club coupe was discontinued. Imperial Custom sedans now rode on a wheelbase [...] longer than the 2-door hardtops. The eagle ornament was about the only thing new on the 1953 [...] Imperial Crown. The nameplate was changed slightly and the limousine featured moldings on top of the rear fenders. Imperial Crowns came with a 12-volt electrical system (Imperial Customs still had a 6-volt system) and Chrysler's first fully automatic transmission, called PowerFlite, became available late in the model year, being installed in a limited number of cars for testing and evaluation. Power steering was standard on Imperial Crowns. Also, 1953 was the first year that the Imperial had a one-piece windshield, instead of a two-piece one. A padded dash was standard.|$|R

The interior featured additional <b>courtesy</b> and reading <b>lamps,</b> along with heated seats and a more advanced climate control system. A four-speed automatic transmission was standard.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Examples of {{the need}} for {{nondestructive}} and remote sensing technologies for evaluating early stages of decay are presented. The need is critical to develop methods of analyzing internal decay, at the center of large wood members, and decay behind concealing coverings. Current technologies are reviewed and their inadequacies discussed. Acoustic emission and acoustoultrasonics appear to hold the greatest promise among existing technologies. Sometimes, nondestructive evaluation (NDE) is not needed to determine that a potentially serious decay problem exists in a building. If the plywood siding, a hand railing, or a major glulam beam sprouts mushrooms (fig. 1), for example, you can be pretty sure you have a decay problem on your hands. Unfortunately, those are rare occurrences. White mycelium growing on the surface of wooden structural members in moist areas (fig. 2) is also a pretty good clue that you should be concerned about the structural integrity of the member involved, but that, too, occurs relatively infrequently in structures. Once the structure is opened and advanced Figure 2 [...] Mycelial mat on joist and underside of plywood subfloor. decay is revealed, little additional information is necessary to assess the structural impact of the decay in many cases. But, in the majority of cases of wooden structures with water problems, visual indicators are not present and some form of internal assessment must be incorporated.
