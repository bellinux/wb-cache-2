[...] "To me, I am afraid of fire and fire technics {{and all that stuff}} which is why I don't know why <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> <b>to</b> be in the bar scene because I've never exploded before", she said. She had asked to be set on fire. [...] "That was me trying to conquer a fear. By the way, they would not allow me to do a full burn for insurance purposes, even though I argued that Burt Reynolds had done it once", stated Cody. [...] "But apparently he got really hurt, so they would not let me. To me, there's nothing more horrifying than being stuck in a claustrophobic space as it is burning down so, to me, it was more like tapping into a personal fear. That's not tough." ...|$|E
500|$|With {{the ninth}} issue, dated July 1, 1919, Hersey was {{replaced}} by Ronald Oliphant. [...] The reason he was replaced is not clear, though several explanations have been suggested. [...] Murray Leinster claimed that Hersey was fired for publishing too much of his own fiction and poetry in the magazine; according to Leinster, some of the poetry may have actually been written by Hersey's mother rather than by Hersey himself. [...] Pulp historian Richard Bleiler regards this theory as unlikely, since although up to eighteen of the twenty-five short poems in the first eight issues of the magazine may have been by Hersey, only two stories in those issues are definitely by him, and there are only four other stories {{which may have been}} Hersey's work published under a pseudonym. [...] Bleiler suggests that at most Street & Smith would have reprimanded Hersey, and that the real reason for his dismissal {{is more likely to be}} that Street & Smith were dissatisfied with The Thrill Book under his editorship. [...] Bleiler also suggests that Hersey may have started the rumor that he was let go for buying too much of his own material, as this would have been less harmful to his reputation than a dismissal for failure. [...] Hersey himself claimed that he was not fired, but quit: [...] "I wasn't fired, but I should have been... I saw the 'handwriting on the wall' ahead of time. [...] <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> <b>to</b> be relieved of my duties... and my request was promptly accepted!" ...|$|E
2500|$|... "Examining every {{official}} Israeli {{statement about}} the Arab exodus, I {{was struck by the}} fact that no primary evidence of evacuation orders was ever produced. The charge, Israel claimed, was [...] "documented"; but where were the documents? ... In Israel in 1958, as a guest of the Foreign Office and therefore doubly hopeful of serious assistance, <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> <b>to</b> be shown the proofs, I was assured they existed, and was promised them. None had been offered when I left, but I was again assured. <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> <b>to</b> have the material sent on to me. I am still waiting." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, yes," [...] said Grimes, [...] "of course it's me. Did <b>I</b> <b>ask</b> <b>to</b> {{be brought}} here into the prison? Did <b>I</b> <b>ask</b> <b>to</b> {{be set to}} sweep your foul chimneys? Did <b>I</b> <b>ask</b> <b>to</b> have lighted straw put under me to make me go up? Did <b>I</b> <b>ask</b> <b>to</b> stick fast {{in the very first}} chimney of all, because it was so shamefully clogged up with soot? Did <b>I</b> <b>ask</b> <b>to</b> stay here--I don't know how long--a hundred years, I do believe, and never get my pipe, nor my beer, nor nothing fit for a beast, let alone a man?" ...|$|R

2500|$|Phair {{revealed}} {{in an interview}} with the Wall Street Journal that the falling out with her record label, ATO, occurred after a change in management. She explained, [...] "The people who were still there didn’t like, or didn’t know what to do with, the music I was making, so we just stalled out and <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> <b>to</b> leave." ...|$|E
2500|$|India is {{currently}} the world's largest cutting & polishing centre for diamonds. Both countries have agreed to streamline their bilateral trade in diamonds through reductions in regulations and tariffs. Indian Prime Minister Modi stated in an interview, [...] "I made three proposals to President Putin. First, I would like Alrosa to have direct long-term contracts with more Indian companies. I am pleased {{to know that they}} are moving in this direction. Second, I want Alrosa and others to trade directly on our diamond bourse. We have decided to create a Special Notified Zone where mining companies can trade diamonds on consignment basis and re-export unsold ones. Third, <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> <b>to</b> reform regulation so that Russia can send rough diamonds to India and reimport polished diamonds without extra duties". Analysts predict through streamlined procedures and initiatives bilateral trade in this area will significantly increase.|$|E
2500|$|I {{recognize}} {{the institutions that}} the people recognize. But, if the people's opinion isn't unanimous, if the North does {{not agree with the}} South, I will be, until the end, {{on the side of the}} faithful to tradition. And if it requires foreign intervention to support the Monarchy, then I will be on the side of the Republic...Afterwords <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> <b>to</b> resign. I asked it because, after many years of sacrifice and work under the blue and white colors and shields of our flag, I did not think, I could not take to abandon the symbol of the history of my Country. [...] Pretend that a symbol with roots in our soul and [...] inspired respect in all the World and [...] works of many generations. And I, for my part, find myself too old to begin now, a new struggle that the garlands of a new flag require.|$|E

2500|$|Later, {{when asked}} about Iran-Contra she said: [...] "I had no {{knowledge}} of the Iran-Contras connection. I had no involvement in it, nor was <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> <b>to</b> be a part of it." [...] The final House report on Iran-Contra concluded that Whittlesey unsuccessfully attempted to help Oliver North obtain a U.S. passport for a fake Saudi prince who claimed to have knowledge of the locations of hostages being held in Lebanon. [...] Whittlesey has repeatedly and emphatically denied this charge, for which she maintains no proof was produced, as a politically motivated attempt by a Democrat-dominated House to discredit her White House Outreach Group initiative, which had been [...] "a legitimate and in every respect legal attempt to communicate Reagan's anti-communist policy in Central America." [...] Of her association with Oliver North, she asserted, [...] "We worked closely together. That's why I was investigated. That's why I was hauled before a congressional panel and investigated. They were criminalizing policy differences." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Oh, yes, I have. I've {{seen the}} {{drawings}} you submitted at the Synthesis. I've just seen them. I {{may as well}} confess it: <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> <b>to</b> see them." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And you won't {{leave me}} alone?" [...] she begged--"not even if <b>I</b> <b>ask</b> <b>to</b> be left alone? You see--I can't make you understand--but I don't even trust myself." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I thank you, no. I am not thirsty. Ice-water is not {{necessary}} to my happiness. You will pardon me if <b>I</b> <b>ask</b> <b>to</b> be left alone--with my nerves." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Ready?" [...] he repeated. [...] "Yes; {{ready at}} last. Listen to me; and let's get it over. <b>I</b> don't <b>ask</b> you <b>to</b> give Frank up. <b>I</b> <b>ask</b> you <b>to</b> wait." ...|$|R

60|$|Continuing my queries, <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> <b>to</b> {{whom the}} house belonged, {{who was my}} landlord, the amount of my rent. He {{instantly}} gave me these particulars in writing; he had foreseen and prepared all things.|$|E

6000|$|Campbell: [...] "I'd rather {{know your}} heart. But I'll wait." [...] After a pause: [...] "Why do you carry a fan {{on a day}} like this? <b>I</b> <b>ask,</b> <b>to</b> make general conversation." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Stop a moment, Uncle Adam," [...] I broke in. [...] "This {{is not at}} {{all what}} <b>I</b> am <b>asking.</b> <b>I</b> <b>ask</b> you <b>to</b> pay Pinkerton, who is a poor man. <b>I</b> <b>ask</b> you <b>to</b> clear my feet of debt, not to arrange my life or any part of it." ...|$|R
6000|$|He was wonderfully candid, I thought. But what {{extraordinary}} benefits had she {{bestowed on}} them, <b>I</b> <b>asked,</b> <b>to</b> {{enable them to}} regard, or to say, that this picture of a very beautiful young female was her likeness! ...|$|E
6000|$|... “I {{only want}} {{it until the}} bank at Darsley opens to‐morrow. This is my uncle’s house, of course, but I am, so to speak, running it for him, and I couldn’t well go round {{borrowing}} from the men <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> <b>to</b> stay with me.” ...|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>asked</b> <b>to</b> see {{the cast}} from Chantrey's bust of him, which he at once showed me; also a crayon sketch by Haydon, which, I {{understood}} him to say, West had pronounced the finest crayon {{he had ever}} seen.

6000|$|... 'No, I don't {{suppose you}} did,' said I. 'And <b>I</b> don't <b>ask</b> you <b>to</b> lose; <b>I</b> <b>ask</b> you <b>to</b> {{give me your}} word, man to man, that you will make no native drunk.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes;--allow me. I {{should be}} too bold were <b>I</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> you <b>to</b> return my love at once. <b>I</b> only <b>ask</b> you <b>to</b> {{know that because}} I was repulsed once, I have not given up the pursuit." ...|$|R

6000|$|... 'I won't quite say that. Though I {{own that}} the idea of your inexperienced state had a great charm for me. But I think this: that if I had known there was any phase of your past love you would refuse to reveal if <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> <b>to</b> know it, I should never have loved you.' ...|$|E
6000|$|A stout, handsome, and showy {{woman was}} in the ladies' cabin. <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> <b>to</b> be shown my berth; she looked hard at me, muttered {{something}} about its being unusual for passengers to come on board at that hour, and seemed disposed {{to be less than}} civil. What a face she had--so comely--so insolent and so selfish! ...|$|E
6000|$|... "At last, {{after looking}} round again timidly, she entered one; and when I came up, I also went in.
