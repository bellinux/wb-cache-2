Only repeated brain MR showed moderate cortical atrophy. However, even with different therapeutic changes and approaches, {{we were not able}} to reach any significant shift neither in psychiatric nor neurologic disturbances.

40|$|Tandemly {{repeated}} DNA sequences {{are highly}} dynamic components of genomes. Most repeats are in intergenic regions, {{but some are}} in coding sequences or pseudogenes. In humans, expansion of intragenic triplet repeats is associated with various diseases, including <b>Huntington</b> <b>chorea</b> and fragile X syndrome. The persistence of intragenic repeats in genomes {{suggests that there is}} a compensating benefit. Here we show that in the genome of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, most genes containing intragenic repeats encode cell-wall proteins. The repeats trigger frequent recombination events in the gene or between the gene and a pseudogene, causing expansion and contraction in the gene size. This size variation creates quantitative alterations in phenotypes (e. g., adhesion, flocculation or biofilm formation). We propose that variation in intragenic repeat number provides the functional diversity of cell surface antigens that, in fungi and other pathogens, allows rapid adaptation to the environment and elusion of the host immune system. status: publishe...|$|E

Afterwards the rats were treated according to three different groups: Group I has been examined for 14 days without further treatment. The second group has been administered neuroprotective treatment with either rolipram or zolpidem for 14 days beginning 24 hours after the striatal lesion was set. After 14 days Nissl-stains and immunohistochemical stains with GFAP and OX- 42 antibodies have been made from the regions of the striatum and the substantia nigra of both groups. Based on the Nissl-stains a massive destruction of the striatum could be observed after chinolinic acid injection. By means of cell counts, a significant reduction of neuronal cell loss in the substantia nigra pars reticulata was found in the rolipram group. The treatment with zolpidem led to no significant change compared with the untreated group.

40|$|There {{has been}} long-standing {{debate over whether}} use of the possessive form {{of the names of}} eponymous {{neurological}} disorders should be abandoned. Which view has actually predominated in practice? We empirically assessed current and historical usage in the scientific literature. The PubMed database was queried for the percentage of titles published each year from 1960 – 2012 which contained the possessive form of Parkinson’s (PD), Alzheimer’s (AD), Huntington’s (HD), Wilson’s (WD), and Gaucher’s (GD) diseases (e. g. Huntington’s disease or <b>chorea</b> vs <b>Huntington</b> disease or <b>chorea).</b> Down syndrome (DS), well known for its changes in terminology, was used as a reference. The possessive form was nearly universal in all conditions from 1960 until the early 1970 s. In both DS and GD it then declined at an approximately constant rate of 2 percentage points per year to drop below 15 %. The possessive forms of both PD and AD began to decline at the same time but stabilised and have since remained above 80 %, with a similar but more volatile pattern in HD. WD, meanwhile, is intermediate between the DS/GD and PD/AD/HD patterns, with a slower decline to its current value of approximately 60 %. Declining possessive form usage in GD and DS papers has been remarkably uniform over time and has nearly reached completion. PD and AD appear stable in remaining predominantly possessive. The larger volume of papers published in those fields and their possibly greater public recognition and involvement may make that unlikely to change in the short-term. In a secondary analysis restricted to PD, we found that practices have switched dramatically several times in each of three US-published general neurology journals. Meanwhile, in two UK-published journals, and in the specialist title “Movement Disorders”, the possessive form has been maintained consistently.

40|$|As {{part of a}} {{multidisciplinary}} study program, an epidemiological descriptive survey {{was carried out in}} the province of Ferrara, northern Italy. The temporal trend of <b>Huntington</b> <b>chorea</b> (HC) in the last century (1871 - 1987) was determined in the study area, and the patients and subjects at risk were identified with the aim of creating genetic advisory councils offering preventive interventions to eliminate the disease. The final study population consisted of 10 unrelated families with HC and 47 HC cases who lived in the province of Ferrara in the survey period. The estimate of the prevalence rate varied over the time period considered between 3. 09 and 0. 36 cases per 100, 000 inhabitants. The temporal trend was characterized by increasing and decreasing phases, reflecting the incidence (varying between 0. 20 and 0. 00 annual cases per 100, 000 inhabitants) and mortality (varying between 0. 21 and 0. 00 annual deaths per 100, 000 inhabitants) rates. This trend shows that the frequency of HC in the study area was not stable. It was characterized by a cyclic course with a period of about 50 years. In the recent decades of the study, the incidence and the prevalence rates showed a relative increase. Thus, HC persists in the Ferrara population despite a greater public awareness and the recent lower birth rate. A new peak of prevalence is likely in the near future...|$|E
40|$|The {{vesicular}} neurotransmitter transporter VMAT 2 {{is responsible}} for the transport of monoamines into synaptic and storage vesicles. VMAT 2 is the target of many psychoactive drugs and is essential for proper neurotransmission and survival. Here we describe a new expression system in Saccharomyces cerevisiae that takes advantage of the polyspecificity of VMAT 2. Expression of rVMAT 2 confers resistance to acriflavine and to the parkinsonian toxin 1 -methyl- 4 -phenylpyridinium (MPP+) by their removal into the yeast vacuole. This expression system allowed identification of a new substrate, acriflavine, and isolation of mutants with modified affinity to tetrabenazine (TBZ), a non-competitive inhibitor of VMAT 2 that is used in the treatment of various movement disorders including Tourette syndrome and <b>Huntington</b> <b>chorea.</b> Whereas one type of mutant obtained displayed decreased affinity to TBZ, a second type showed only a slight decrease in the affinity to TBZ, displayed a higher Km to the neurotransmitter serotonin, but conferred increased resistance to acriflavine and MPP+. A protein where both types of mutations were combined (with only three amino acid replacements) lost most of the properties of the neurotransmitter transporter (TBZ-insensitive, no transport of neurotransmitter) but displayed enhanced resistance to the above toxicants. The work described here shows {{that in the case of}} rVMAT 2, loss of traits acquired in evolution of function (such as serotonin transport and TBZ binding) bring about an improvement in older functions such as resistance to toxic compounds. A process that has taken millions of years of evolution can be reversed by three mutations...|$|E
40|$|Neurodegenerative {{diseases}} are widespread pathologies of large social impact that include: prion, Alzheimer and Parkinson disease, <b>Huntington</b> <b>chorea</b> and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. The onset of such diseases is {{commonly associated with}} the accumulation of insoluble amyloid plaques in specific neuronal population. In this scenario, research activities for the prevention and the treatment of these {{diseases are}} focused on two distinct directions: (a) the enhancement of factors that promote the survival and maintenance of nerve cells and (b) {{the definition of the}} molecular processes that lead to onset of neurodegenerative diseases. In this framework, the main scopes of the present PhD project have been the analysis of structural/dynamic determinants of the function of neuroprotective proteins (neurotrophins) and the study of structural properties of amyloid aggregates and their toxic precursors. Neurotrophins (NTs) are homodimeric proteins that {{play a key role in}} the differentiation, survival and maintenance of nerve cells. This class of proteins include: nerve growth factor (NGF), Brain-Derived Factor (BDNF), neurotrophin 3 (NT 3), neurotrophin 4 (NT 4), and neurotrophin 6 (NT 6). NTs act by binding to two distinct classes of transmembrane receptors. One is the p 75 NTR neurotrophin receptor and the other is the Trk family of tyrosine kinase receptors, which includes TrkA, TrkB, and TrkC. All mature NTs bind to p 75 NTR, but Trks are more selective. NGF interacts selectively with TrkA receptors, NT 4 and BDNF selectively with TrkB receptors, and NT 3 interacts with TrkC receptors. During the PhD, a detailed investigation of the dynamical properties of different regions of NTs was carried out by molecular dynamics techniques. Initially, these studies were focussed on the intrinsic conformational preferences of N-terminal region of the NTs. These N-terminal regions are important for the recognition and the specificity of NT-Trk binding. Indeed, N-terminal region of NGF in complex with TrkA has an α-helical conformation, whereas the NT 4 in complex with TrkB receptor is in 3 / 10 helix conformation. However, both N-terminal regions of the two NTs are absent in the crystallographic models of isolated dimers and in complex with the p 75 NTR receptor, revealing their flexibility in the absence of receptor and a conformational transitions in the interaction with the Trk receptor. Our calculations unveil that for NT 4 -Nter, and to a lesser extent for NGF-Nter, the conformation of the peptide that is prone to the Trk binding is already present among the states that are energetically accessible to the isolated peptide. This consideration has suggested feasible strategies for the design of effective NT agonist/antagonists. Indeed, variants of these peptides with an increased helical propensity will better mimic the NT functions. Successive simulations carried out on the main body of NGF have provided a detailed picture of mechanisms of interaction with the p 75 NTR receptor, whose stoichiometry of binding is controversial. These results provided important information on the correlated motions of distant region of the protein. Moreover, essential dynamics analyses clearly indicate that most of the motions of the protein are highly symmetrical. On the basis of results, it has been concluded that the binding of p 75 NTR to NGF induces a significant "induced-fit” from symmetric structures to asymmetric structures. In the last years, enormous efforts have been made to obtain insights into the structure of the amyloid-like forms of proteins and peptides involved in the insurgence of neurodegenerative diseases. A characterization of the structure and dynamic properties of these aggregates is required to define the molecular mechanisms underlying these diseases for the development of effective therapeutic strategies. In addition, the considerable resistance of amyloid-like fibrils, combined with their flexibility, versatility and ability to self-assemble has stimulated a growing interest in the potential of these fibers in biotechnological fields as nanobiomaterials. Previous MD simulations have shown that some steric zipper models are endowed with a remarkable stability also in a crystal-free context. However, MD simulations were limited to peptides with polar and/or aromatic dry interfaces. In this scenario, a section of my PhD project was focused on MD simulations of various amyloidogenic structures recently determined. Primarily, were carried out MD studies of steric zipper assemblies whose dry interface involves exclusively aliphatic residues. These simulations have highlighted the key role of residues involved in the steric zipper interface. Indeed, aliphatic residues are not able to form the intra-sheet and inter-sheet interactions formed by polar and aromatic residues that likely provide a strong contribution to the steric zipper motif stability. Along this line, amyoid-like assemblies endowed with hydrophobic residues presumably require larger interfaces, as it is shown by the stability of MD simulation of HET-s protein with a larger steric zippers interface. Very recent crystallographic studies have shown that the same amyloidogenic peptide can adopt distinct steric zipper assemblies (polymorphs). Intriguingly, it has been postulated that the different polymorphs of the same polypeptide sequence may be representative of distinct strains. In this framework, a detailed analysis of dynamical properties of two polymorphic structures formed by a segment of the islet amyloid polypeptide (IAPP) was carried out during the PhD. The analyses of the MD simulations show that the two IAPP distinct polymorphs are stable in a crystalline-free environment. This finding supports the hypothesis that the occurrence of strains in neurodegenerative diseases may be related to the possibility that a single peptide/protein chain may self-associate in alternative steric zipper-based assemblies. The last section of present thesis was dedicated to the studies of human prion protein (HPrP) properties. These studies were conducted in collaboration with the University of Cambridge. Independent crystallographic studies have shown the involvement of the β-sheet of the HPrP in intermolecular interactions that lead to the association of two different molecules HPrP in the crystalline state. These observations suggest that this association may be representative of the early stages of aggregation of HPrP. In this framework, during the PhD project detailed replica exchange molecular dynamics (REMD) studies on the intrinsic stability of HPrP β-structure were conducted. In particular, simulations were conducted on different β-strand combinations taken either from HPrP monomer or dimeric crystalline assemblies. The REMD simulations conducted on the isolated two stranded β-sheet of the protein monomer indicate that this structure is remarkably stable. The stability of larger aggregates formed by the juxtaposition of two of these sheets, as detected in the crystalline state, is very limited stability. Interestingly, additional simulations indicate that these aggregates are stabilized by mutations linked to the insurgence of pathological states. The observation that the two stranded β-sheet of the prion monomer are intrinsically stable hold important implications for prion polymerization process and for the design of synthetic peptides that potentially can inhibit the aggregation process of human prion protein...|$|E

40|$|Huntington disease (HD) {{is caused}} by an {{expanded}} CAG repeat in the HD gene. Although {{the length of the}} CAG repeat strongly correlates with the age-at-onset (AAO), AAO in HD individuals may differ dramatically in spite of similar expanded CAG repeat lengths. Additional genetic or environmental factors are thought to influence the disease onset. To identify such a genetic modifier, we analyzed single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the kalirin (KALRN) gene. Eleven SNPs in the kalirin gene were selected and SNP rs 10934657 was examined in an association study in 680 independent European HD patients. However, the results did not reveal an association between the analyzed kalirin polymorphisms and the AAO in HD. In the second part of this study, we investigated the effect of kalirin- 7 on synphilin- 1 aggregate formation. Coexpression of kalirin- 7 and synphilin- 1 caused a dramatic relocation of synphilin- 1 cytoplasmic small inclusions to a single prominent, perinuclear inclusion. These perinuclear inclusions were located in aggresomes according to the colocalization with microtubule organization center markers and their formation was microtubule-dependent. Furthermore, kalirin- 7 increased the susceptibility of synphilin- 1 inclusions to be degraded as shown by live imaging and quantification of aggregates. The GEF activity of kalirin- 7 is the most prominent function of the protein, however, kalirin- 7 -mediated synphilin- 1 aggresome response was not dependent on its GEF activity since various dominant negative small GTPases could not inhibit the formation of aggresomes. Interestingly, the aggresome response was blocked by HDAC 6 catalytic mutants and the HDAC inhibitor trichostatin A (TSA), but not by sodium butyrate (NaBu). Moreover, kalirin- 7 decreased the level of acetylated alpha-tubulin in response to TSA, which suggests an effect of kalirin- 7 on HDAC 6 -mediated protein transportation and aggresome formation. In summary, we demonstrated that kalirin- 7 leads to the recruitment of synphilin- 1 into aggresomes in a HDAC 6 -dependent manner and also links kalirin- 7 to microtubule dynamics. Our results implicate an important role of a GEF protein in the pathogenesis of PD and provide a link to the huntingtin pathway by binding the huntingtin associated protein 1 (HAP 1) interactor. Kalirin- 7 has been proposed as an important regulator for synaptic structure and function which is associated with cognitive processes in kalirin- 7 knockout mice. In the third part of this study, we tried to generate and characterize kalirin- 7 overexpressing mice to further crossbreed them with PD and HD animal models and evaluate the impact of kalirin- 7 in these two diseases in vivo. Unfortunately, we were unsuccessful in characterizing and establishing the kalirin- 7 animal model {{due to the lack of}} proper antibodies, including the one we generated, which was supposed to be human kalirin- 7 specific. To further generate a kalirin- 7 animal model, a stronger promoter and a small tag might have to be included. Bei der Suche nach Proteinen, die im Pathogenesepathway des Morbus Parkinson (MP) involviert sind, haben wir kalirin- 7, ein neuronaler GDP/GTP Austauschfaktor (auch genannt HAPIP), als interagierendes Protein von Synphilin 1 identifiziert. kalirin- 7 selbst wurde bereits als interagierendes Protein des huntingtin-assoziierten Proteins HAP 1 beschrieben. Damit konnten wir einen Stoffwechselweg des MP direkt mit einem Stoffwechselweg der <b>Chorea</b> <b>Huntington</b> (CH) koppeln. Daher kommt kalirin- 7 eine zentrale Bedeutung für die Untersuchung der kausalen Ursachen neurodegenerativer Prozesse zu, welche in diesem Projekt mit Zellkultur- und Tiermodellen des MP und der CH untersucht werden soll. Während die Funktion von Synphilin- 1 weitestgehend unklar ist, gibt es umfassendere Analysen für den Proteinkomplex des Huntingtin-Proteins, welches mit NMDAR 2, PSD 95 und IP 3 R interagiert. In ersten Analysen konnten wir nunmehr auch Synphilin- 1 diesem Komplex zuordnen. Hier soll eine detaillierte funktionelle Charakterisierung von kalirin- 7 bei der Aggregatformierung, beim Axonwachstum und der Dendritenausbildung sowie beim neuronalen Zelltod bzw. Überleben erfolgen. Darüber hinaus generieren wir kalirin- 7 überexprimierende transgene Mäuse, um durch Kreuzung mit Tiermodellen des MP und der CH, die Relevanz von kalirin- 7 als therapeutischen Angriffspunkt zu untersuchen...|$|R
