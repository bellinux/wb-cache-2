5|$|One {{reason for}} the success of the {{offensive}} in this sector was the failure of Falkenhausen to employ a <b>defence</b> <b>in</b> <b>depth.</b> In theory, the enemy would be allowed to make initial gains, thus stretching their lines of communication. Reserves held close to the battlefield would be committed once the initial advance had bogged down, before enemy reinforcements could be brought up. The defenders would thus be able to counter-attack and regain any lost territory. In this sector, Falkenhausen kept his reserve troops too far from the front and they were too late for a useful counter-attack on either 10 or 11 April.|$|E

As part of Operation Tonga, the division's secondary objectives involved its two parachute brigades. The 5th Parachute Brigade provided a <b>defence</b> <b>in</b> <b>depth</b> for the captured bridges, deploying {{to the east}} and west of the canal and river. The 3rd Parachute Brigade destroyed the Merville gun battery along with the bridges crossing the Dives, then fell back to form a defensive line to the east of 5th Parachute Brigade.|$|E

The HV 7th Guards Brigade {{advanced}} north-west along the LivnoBosansko Grahovo road towards {{the town of}} Bosansko Grahovothe offensive's main objective. A composite company drawn from the HV 114th Infantry Brigade attacked VRS positions on the right flank of the advance. The 7th Guards Brigade managed to move forward by about , but had to suspend its effort as the 114th Brigade company could not defeat the VRS' entrenched defences at Marino Brdo to cover the 7th Brigade's right flank. The VRS defences were well prepared all along the front line attacked by the HV and the HVO. The Bosansko Grahovo zone was particularly well prepared for defencefortifications, shelters and covered trenches were built to establish <b>defence</b> <b>in</b> <b>depth,</b> with obstacles, including minefields, in between them.|$|E
50|$|The 58th Division {{remained}} at Poelcappelle {{to hold the}} line during November and December before it was transferred to the south in January 1918. Here it spent time digging defences, converting former French positions into the newly devised <b>defences</b> <b>in</b> <b>depth.</b> <b>In</b> February 1918 the battalion absorbed drafts from the disbanded 2/1st Bn in 173rd Bde and 1/3rd Bn from 56th Division and became simply the 3rd Londons (see above).|$|R
50|$|While {{the armies}} {{expected}} to use entrenchments and cover, {{they did not}} allow for the effect of <b>defences</b> <b>in</b> <b>depth.</b> They required a deliberate approach to seizing positions from which fire support could be given for {{the next phase of}} the attack, rather than a rapid move to break the enemy's line. It was assumed that artillery could still destroy entrenched troops, or at least suppress them sufficiently for friendly infantry and cavalry to manoeuvre.|$|R
50|$|The 2/4th Londons now spent a {{prolonged}} period out of the battle area, absorbing a draft of over 200 men, but remaining considerably under strength until February, when 2/1st Londons were disbanded and 220 of them joined 2/4th Bn. In December and January the battalion took its turn in trench-holding in the Salient until 58th Division {{was transferred to the}} south in January 1918. Here it spent time digging defences, converting former French positions into the newly devised <b>defences</b> <b>in</b> <b>depth.</b>|$|R
5|$|The Soviet leadership, {{through their}} {{intelligence}} agencies and foreign sources, {{learned about the}} German intentions, and therefore the multiple delays by the German high command, OKW, allowed them {{a great deal of}} time to prepare their defences. Employing <b>defence</b> <b>in</b> <b>depth,</b> they constructed a series of defensive lines to wear down the attacking panzer formations. Three belts made up of extensive minefields, anti-tank ditches, and anti-tank gun emplacements were created; behind those were an additional three belts, which were mostly unoccupied and less fortified. The Voronezh Front, commanded by General Nikolai Vatutin, defended the southern face of the salient. The Steppe Front, commanded by Colonel General Ivan Konev, formed the strategic reserve. It was to be held back east of the salient until the time was right for the Soviet counteroffensive. This formation included Lieutenant General Alexei Zhadov's 5th Guards Army and Lieutenant General Pavel Rotmistrov's 5th Guards Tank Army.|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} day, 13 May, the French were {{undone by}} their poor tactical deployment. They strung their armour {{out in a}} thin line between Hannut and Huy, leaving no <b>defence</b> <b>in</b> <b>depth,</b> which {{was the point of}} sending the French armour to the Gembloux gap in the first place. This left Hoepner with a chance to mass against one of the French Light Divisions (the 3e DLM) and achieve a breakthrough in that sector. Moreover, with no reserves behind the front, the French denied themselves the chance of a counterattack. The victory saw the Panzer Corps out-manoeuvre the 2e DLM on its left flank. The Belgian III Corps, retreating from Liege, offered to support the French front held by the 3e DLM. This offer was rejected.|$|E
25|$|At the Chantilly Conferences of 1915 {{the allies}} {{agreed to a}} coordinated effort {{designed}} to overwhelm the Austro-German defences. Part of this effort involved an Anglo-French offensive on the Somme, though the Battle of Verdun denuded French forces {{to such an extent}} that the Battle of the Somme became a predominantly British operation. The Somme had been a comparatively quiet sector, allowing the German 2nd Army ample time to prepare a <b>defence</b> <b>in</b> <b>depth</b> consisting of wide belts of wire, trenches, fortified villages and deep dug-outs.|$|E
50|$|The Warsaw Pact {{armoured}} doctrine was substantially {{influenced by}} the developments in the Soviet Army which sought to adopt its existing doctrine evolved during World War II to the nuclear battlefield. In the early 1960s {{this led to a}} number of important developments in the armoured forces and their supporting Arms. One important development was the transition of the Second World War use of Cavalry-Mechanised Group (CMG) into the Cold War Operational Manoeuvre Group (OMG) that was designed to exploit breakthroughs to penetrate NATO's <b>defences</b> <b>in</b> <b>depth.</b> This was a culmination of the Deep Battle theory dating to the 1930s.|$|R
5000|$|... 58th Division was {{transferred}} to the south in January 1918. Here it spent time digging defences, converting former French positions into the newly-devised <b>defences</b> <b>in</b> <b>depth.</b> The BEF was suffering a manpower shortage, and its brigades were reduced from a four-battalion to a three-battalion establishment. In 173rd Bde this resulted in 2/1st Bn being broken up on 31 January and its men drafted to the other battalions of the brigade and to 1/4th Bn in 56th Division. At the same time 1/3rd Bn {{was transferred}} in from 56th Division to be amalgamated with 2/3rd Bn, and thereafter became simply 3rd Bn.|$|R
2500|$|The advance {{was planned}} to cover [...] and stop on reverse slopes which were easier to defend, {{enclosing}} ground which gave observation of German reinforcement routes and counter-attack assembly areas. Preparations were then made swiftly to defeat German counter-attacks, by mopping-up and consolidating the captured ground with <b>defences</b> <b>in</b> <b>depth.</b> The attack inflicted a severe blow on the German 4th Army, causing many losses, capturing {{a significant portion}} of the , which threatened the German hold on Broodseinde ridge. The better weather continued to benefit the British attackers by drying the ground, raising mist which obscured British infantry attacks made around dawn, then clearing to reveal German [...] formations to air and ground observation, well in advance of their arrival on the battlefield. German defensive arrangements were changed hastily after the battle to try to counter British offensive superiority.|$|R
25|$|By 4 February the BEF front had {{increased}} from 95 miles to 123 miles, {{an increase of}} almost 30%. Besides constructing his defences, {{for which he had}} inadequate labour, Gough was formally ordered (Instructions to Fifth Army 9 February, following recommendations by Tavish Davidson on 4 February) to construct <b>defence</b> <b>in</b> <b>depth,</b> including an “emergency defensive zone” along the Somme and Tortille rivers (which run roughly north-south south of Peronne), and a fortified bridgehead around Peronne, from whence “strong counterattacks” were to be conducted when Petain sent the promised reinforcements. GHQ possibly still thought that the main German attack might be elsewhere. Gough had too many men too far forward in positions too far apart to be mutually supporting.|$|E
25|$|British {{infantry}} {{was brought}} forward to fortify and provide garrisons {{along the length}} of the railway. They formed a firm base for mobile operations and <b>defence</b> <b>in</b> <b>depth</b> for the huge administrative organisation advancing with the railway, in support of the Anzac Mounted Division and the 52nd (Lowland) Division. The movement of the infantry across Sinai was eased by construction of wire netting roads also used by Egyptian Labour Corps, light vehicles, cars, and ambulances. This reasonably stable surface, which did not sink, was constructed from two or four rolls of rabbit wire; one inch mesh wire rolled out side by side, wired together with the edges fixed into the sand with long steel or wooden pegs to produce a reasonable track.|$|E
25|$|Surviving French {{officers}} had increased tactical experience against German mobile units; increased {{confidence in their}} weapons after seeing their artillery, which the Wehrmacht post-battle analysis recognised as technically very good, and their tanks perform better in combat than the German armour. The French tanks were now known to have heavier armour and armament. Between 23 and 28 May, they reconstituted the French Seventh and Tenth armies. Weygand decided on hedgehog tactics, which were to implement <b>defence</b> <b>in</b> <b>depth</b> operations and use delaying tactics, to inflict maximum attrition on German units. He employed units in towns and small villages, as well as major towns and cities and fortified them 360° along their perimeter. Behind this, the new infantry, armoured and half-mechanised divisions formed up, ready to counter-attack and relieve the surrounded units, which were ordered to hold out at all costs.|$|E
500|$|The German defences on Verrières Ridge {{remained}} very strong. The forward infantry {{positions were}} well dug-in, with wide fields of fire. The main concentration {{of one hundred}} 75 mm and 88 mm anti-tank guns was deployed around the villages of Cramesnil and Saint-Aignan-de-Cramesnil [...] behind the German forward positions, to halt any breakthrough by tanks along the Caen–Falaise road. The front line and <b>defences</b> <b>in</b> <b>depth</b> were held by the 89th Infantry Division, 85th Infantry Division (recently arrived from Rouen) and {{the remnants of the}} 272nd Grenadier Infantry Division (severely depleted by the Canadians in Operation Atlantic). The 12th SS Panzer Division Hitlerjugend with an attached heavy Tiger tank battalion, with fifty tanks, was in reserve a further [...] back. Some of the infantry were commanded by the German LXXXVI Korps but most of the sector (and the 12th SS Panzer Division) was under the command of the I SS Panzer Corps, which had arrived in the area during Operation Goodwood.|$|R
5|$|Operation Veritable was {{designed}} to bring the 21st Army Group {{to the west bank}} of the Rhine River, the last natural obstacle before entering Germany. Initially scheduled for December 1944, the operation was delayed until February by the German Ardennes Offensive. Plans were developed to breach three successive defensive lines: the outpost screen; a formidable section of the Siegfried Line running through the Hochwald Forest; and finally the Hochwald Layback covering the approach to the ultimate objective of Xanten. The first phase began on 8February 1945, with the 2nd Division's advance following up one of the largest artillery barrages seen on the Western Front. The Germans had prepared significant <b>defences</b> <b>in</b> <b>depth,</b> both within the outpost screen and the Siegfried Line itself, and to add to the Canadians' difficulties, constant rain and cold weather obscured the battlefield. However, by the end of the first day, the 2nd Division had captured their objectives—the fortified towns of Wyler and Den Heuvel. On 11February, the division moved southeast to assist British XXX Corps in their assault on Moyland Wood.|$|R
2500|$|The {{practice}} of rigidly defending front-line trenches, regardless of casualties was abolished, {{in favour of}} a mobile defence of the fortified areas being built over the autumn and winter of 1916–1917. [...] (Principles of Field Fortification) was published in January 1917, in which instructions were given {{for the construction of}} <b>defences</b> <b>in</b> <b>depth,</b> according to the principles of greater depth and of disguise by dispersal and camouflage. Trench-lines were mainly intended for accommodation, dumps of supplies and as decoys, rather than firing lines. Deep dug-outs in the front line were to be replaced by many more smaller, shallow [...] (MEBU (pillboxes)) with most built towards the rear of the defensive areas. Within the new forward zones, battlezones and rearward battle zones, the chain of command was streamlined by making corps headquarters into [...] (groups), responsible for the administrative tasks in an area into which divisions would be moved for periods, before being withdrawn to rest, train and be brought up to strength. Command of areas rather than units was also introduced in divisions, with command of regiments devolved to the front battalion commander (KTK [...] ), which reduced the chain of command from five to two posts.|$|R
25|$|The Germans {{planned a}} rigid defence {{of the front}} system and forward zone {{supported}} by counter-attacks. Local withdrawals according {{to the concept of}} elastic defence, was rejected by Loßberg the new 4th Army Chief of Staff, who believed that they would disorganise troops moving forward to counter-attack. Front line troops were not expected to cling to shelters, which were man traps but evacuate them as soon as the battle began and move forward and to the flanks to avoid British fire and to counter-attack. A small number of machine-gun nests and permanent garrisons were separate from the counter-attack organisation, to provide a framework for the re-establishment of <b>defence</b> <b>in</b> <b>depth</b> once an attack had been repulsed. German infantry equipment had recently been improved by the arrival of thirty-six MG08/15 machine-guns per regiment, which gave German units more means for fire and manoeuvre.|$|E
25|$|The shorter {{defensive}} position {{behind the}} Noyon Salient {{was built to}} economise on manpower, contain an Allied breakthrough and make possible a deliberate withdrawal to prepared positions. By destroying the infrastructure and demolishing civilian buildings in the salient before a withdrawal, the Germans could dislocate Franco-British offensive preparations, by forcing them to advance into a wasteland. The British and French armies would need about eight weeks to rebuild roads, bridges and railways in the abandoned area before they could attack. A shorter Western Front could be held with fewer troops and by incorporating the lessons of defensive battle on the Somme, the importance of troop dispersal, reverse-slope positions, <b>defence</b> <b>in</b> <b>depth</b> and camouflage, German infantry casualties could be reduced. While the German army recuperated from the losses of 1916, protected by the Hindenburg Line and similar defensive positions {{on the rest of}} the Western Front, a return to unrestricted submarine warfare and a strategic bombing offensive against Britain were planned.|$|E
25|$|The {{attack on}} Cristot {{had been planned}} {{according}} to the January 1944, 21st Army Group infantry-tank theory, in which an attack was {{to be made in}} waves, with tanks followed by infantry and then more tanks. Experience showed that in close country, tanks must attack {{side by side with the}} infantry and even then, casualties for tanks and infantry would be high, as it was extremely difficult for tanks to watch accompanying infantry. The attempts by XXX Corps to advance round the open German flank at Caumont and the 3rd Canadian Infantry Division to capture high ground around Le Mesnil-Patry, with tank forces supported by infantry rather than vice versa, were not tried again until Operation Goodwood. Having experienced similar losses to those of the 12th SS-Panzer Division during the first few days, the Anglo-Canadians began to accumulate resources to conduct set-piece attrition attacks. German attacks had similar results; the 12th SS-Panzer Division operation order of 7 June, required the division to throw the Allies into the sea but the attempt was a costly failure. The Germans changed tactics and began to limit counter-attacks to restore a <b>defence</b> <b>in</b> <b>depth,</b> rather than continue the failed counter-offensive against the invasion.|$|E
50|$|Tactically, the Germans {{contained}} the offensive, holding {{many of their}} main positions and preventing an Allied breakthrough but they had been startled {{by the weight of}} the attack and preliminary aerial bombardment. It was clear that any defensive system less than 5 mi deep could be overwhelmed at a stroke and the Germans could only afford to man their <b>defences</b> <b>in</b> such <b>depth</b> <b>in</b> the sector south of Caen. Goodwood resulted in the British extending their control over an extra 7 mi depth of territory to the east of Caen, with the penetration being as much as 12000 yd in some places; the southern suburbs of Caen had been captured by the Canadians during Operation Atlantic.|$|R
40|$|Economic {{pressures}} for longer hours and round-the-clock working time arrangements {{along with a}} deregulated industrial landscape highlight the necessity to manage fatigue as an Occupational Health and Safety (OHS) hazard. There have been significant advances in scientific knowledge regarding the causes, consequences and methods for controlling fatigue-related risk. Changes {{in the amount of}} sleep and/or wakefulness, circadian disruption and time on task are recognised as key contributors to an individual being fatigued. Also, the cognitive demands of a given task can shape the susceptibility of a task to fatigue-related error. The experience of fatigue is associated with increased feelings of sleepiness, impaired neurobehavioural performance and negative mood. From an operational perspective, fatigue can sometimes manifest as an increased chance of fatigue-related error and/or fatigue-related accident or injury due to cognitive impairment. Traditionally, fatigue has been managed primarily through the regulation of working time arrangements; specifically, regulation of shift maxima and break minima along with aggregate limits on total working hours over a specified period of time. Recent research suggests that this is of limited benefit and that a systems approach based on the principles of risk and safety management may provide better risk mitigation. This chapter outlines the <b>Defences</b> <b>in</b> <b>Depth</b> (DiD) approach to fatigue management that encompasses five levels of fatigue-related hazards and their associated controls. Understanding and managing fatigue is essential to building a healthy and safe workplace...|$|R

25|$|Army Group B had {{attacked}} {{either side of}} Paris with 47 divisions including {{the majority of the}} mobile units and for the first 48 hours, the French withstood the German attacks. The 4th Army captured bridgeheads over the Somme but the attack on the Aisne failed against the French <b>defence</b> <b>in</b> <b>depth.</b> At Amiens, the Germans were repulsed several times by French artillery fire. Late on the third day of the offensive the Germans managed to cross the Somme and Aisne despite bombing by the Armée de l'Air (French Air Force). The German success was costly and French troops resisted from woods and other cover, where the Germans had broken through. South of Abbeville, the German XV Corps avoided the woods roads and villages, to move over the slightly undulating country where there were few ditches, the tanks leading and infantry vehicles following. The Tenth Army was broken through and retreated to Rouen and southwards along the Seine. German spearheads were vulnerable to flank attacks but Luftwaffe operations obstructed French attempts to concentrate and the fear of air attack negated the mass and mobility of the French armies.|$|E
25|$|In 1984, the Australian {{government}} {{decided to move}} the RAAF's fast jet base in the Northern Territory from Darwin to Tindal to more effectively control the sea-air gap, in keeping with its strategic policy of <b>defence</b> <b>in</b> <b>depth.</b> After a major upgrade RAAF Tindal became operational on 1 October 1988, the first new manned base to be established since World War II. It was officially opened on 31 March 1989, the RAAF's 68th anniversary, by Prime Minister Bob Hawke. The opening was originally planned for July 1988 but was delayed due to difficulties finding a date suitable to both Hawke and the Minister for Defence, Kim Beazley. Since its establishment, Tindal has remained the RAAF's main operational base in the Northern Territory. It has regularly hosted other units for exercises and supported the Australian-led intervention during the 1999 East Timorese crisis, and No. 75 Squadron's deployment for the 2003 invasion of Iraq. In keeping with Tindal's position in the northern area of operations, it is manned exclusively by uniformed personnel. In 2004 it was awarded the RAAF's Hawker Siddeley Trophy for most proficient base of the previous year.|$|E

The Third Army in the centre advanced astride the Scarpe River and in the south, the Fifth Army attacked the Hindenburg Line (Siegfriedstellung) but was frustrated by the <b>defence</b> <b>in</b> <b>depth</b> and made few gains.

5|$|Simonds {{knew that}} {{infantry}} assaults supported by massed artillery {{had failed to}} overcome the German forward lines in Operation Atlantic and Operation Spring. During Operation Goodwood, a bombardment by aircraft of RAF Bomber Command had assisted British tanks {{to break through the}} German front but they had then suffered many casualties from intact German <b>defences</b> arrayed <b>in</b> <b>depth</b> beyond the bombing. Infantry had been unable to follow up quickly enough to support the leading tanks or to secure ground behind them (so that follow-up units were also slowed).

500|$|The Soviet {{government}} had foreknowledge of the German intentions, provided {{in part by}} the British intelligence service and Tunny intercepts.

The Germans delayed the offensive while they tried to build up their forces and waited for new weapons, mainly the new Panther tank but also larger numbers of the Tiger heavy tank. [...] This gave the Red Army time to construct a series of deep defensive belts.

The longest and most heavily fortified was the General Headquarters anti-tank line, GHQ Line, which ran across southern England, wrapped around London and then ran north to Yorkshire. It was intended to protect the capital and the industrial heartland of England. Another major line was the Taunton Stop Line, which defended against an advance from England's south-west peninsula.

Some 50 known stop lines were constructed in Britain, though some of the less important lines were just demolition belts and not all lines were completed.|$|E
500|$|In the {{beginning}} of the 19th century the peripheral systemat least in Swedenwas deemed unmodern, due to the extremely long border and coastline of the country, which required a lot of personnel to maintain and support, leading to high costs and a neglectance of the more mobile armed forces. The peripheral system was also meant to contain the enemy to a specific area, the coast and borders, but as time went and new tactics were taken into practice, the thin line of fortifications would be easily penetrated by the enemy forces, and when the enemy had advanced through the peripheral line, there would not be enough troops in the hinterland to stop the attacker.

2500|$|During the Battle of France in 1940, the 4th Armoured Division (Major-General Charles de Gaulle) and {{elements}} of the 1st Army Tank Brigade (British Expeditionary Force) made probing attacks on the German flank, pushing into {{the rear of the}} advancing armoured columns at times. This may have been a reason for Hitler to call a halt to the German advance. Those attacks combined with Maxime Weygand's Hedgehog tactic would become the major basis for responding to blitzkrieg attacks in the future: deployment <b>in</b> <b>depth,</b> permitting enemy or [...] "shoulders" [...] of a penetration was essential to channelling the enemy attack, and artillery, properly employed at the shoulders, could take a heavy toll of attackers. While Allied forces in 1940 lacked the experience to successfully develop these strategies, resulting in France's capitulation with heavy losses, they characterised later Allied operations. At the Battle of Kursk the Red Army employed a combination of <b>defence</b> <b>in</b> great <b>depth,</b> extensive minefields, and tenacious defence of breakthrough shoulders.

The reverse {{can be seen in the}} Russian summer offensive of 1944, Operation Bagration, which resulted in the destruction of Army Group Center. German attempts to weather the storm and fight out of encirclements failed due to the Russian ability to continue to feed armoured units into the attack, maintaining the mobility and strength of the offensive, arriving in force deep in the rear areas, faster than the Germans could regroup.|$|R
