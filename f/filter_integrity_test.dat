In addition, the room differential pressures are monitored automatically all the time giving alarm when out of specification. Microbiological sampling and measurement of airborne particles are performed regularly according to a standard operation procedure. Microbiological sampling is done {{at least once a}} month. Airborne particles are measured {{at least once a week}} during end product sterile filtration. While doing aseptic work, microbiological sampling and the measurement of particles are always performed.|$|E

40|$|This {{review article}} covers a concise account on {{fludeoxyglucose}} (18 F–FDG) synthesis and quality control procedures {{with emphasis on}} practical synthesis Currently, 18 F–FDG is the most successful PET radiopharmaceutical so far. The advancement in synthesis and quality control of 18 F–FDG, together with its approval by the US FDA {{and the availability of}} reimbursement, are probably the main reasons for the flourish of clinical PET over the last 20 years. 18 F–FDG can be synthesised by either electrophilic fluorination or nucleophilic fluorination reaction. Nucleophilic fluorination using mannose triflate as precursor and Kryptofix or tetrabutylammonium salts (TBA) is widely used because of higher yield and shorter reaction time. The quality control requirements of 18 F–FDG can be found in United States Pharmacopeia (USP), British Pharmacopeia (BP), European Pharmacopeia (EP) and the Chemistry, Manufacturing, and Controls (CMC) section from United States Food and Drug Administration (US FDA) PET draft guidance documents. Basic requirements include radionuclidic identity, radiochemical purity, chemical purity, pH, residual solvent, sterility, and bacterial endotoxin level. Some of these tests (sterility, endotoxins and radionuclidic purity) can be finished after the 18 F–FDG has been released. Although USP, BP and EP do not require <b>filter</b> membrane <b>integrity</b> <b>test,</b> many laboratories perform this test as an indirect evident of the product sterility. It is also interesting to note that there are major differences in 18 F–FDG quality requirements among USP, BP, and CMC...|$|R
40|$|AbstractConfirmation {{of virus}} <b>filter</b> <b>integrity</b> {{is crucial for}} {{ensuring}} the safety of biological products. Two main types of virus filter defects may produce inconsistent and undesirable performance in virus removal: improper pore-size distribution across the membrane; and specific damage, such as tears, broken fibers, or pinholes. Two <b>integrity</b> <b>tests</b> are performed on each individual filter manufactured by Asahi Kasei Medical to ensure the absence of these defects prior to shipment. In this study, we verified that typical usage of Planova™ BioEX filters would not improperly shift the pore-size distribution. Damage occurring during shipment and use (e. g., broken fibers or pinholes) can be detected by end-users with sufficient sensitivity using air–water diffusion based leakage tests. We prepared and tested filters with model pinhole defects of various sizes to develop standard acceptance criteria for the leakage test relative to porcine parvovirus infectivity logarithmic reduction values (LRVs). Our results demonstrate that pinhole defects at or below a certain size for each effective filter surface area have no {{significant impact on the}} virus LRV. In conclusion the leakage test is sufficiently sensitive to serve as the sole end-user <b>integrity</b> <b>test</b> for Planova™ BioEX filters, facilitating their use in biopharmaceuticals manufacturing...|$|R

30|$|For all mock labellings, we {{observed}} a bioburden of < 10  cfu/ml (no growth) and endotoxin content of < 0.125  IU/ml. This endotoxin content is {{far below the}} threshold of 175  IU/V ml (see before). When considering these results together with the specifications of the sterilizing filter used, we conclude that the pre filter bioburden is far below the maximum capacity of the filter. The Cathivex® GV filter (Millipore) used for on-line sterile filtration employs the Millipore Durapore® 0.22 -μm membrane which is validated to withstand a challenge with 4.0 [*]×[*] 107 of the micro-organism Brevundimonas diminuta.

40|$|Air {{quality control}} on the International Space Station (ISS) is a vital {{requirement}} for maintaining a clean environment for the crew and the hardware. This becomes a serious challenge in pressurized space compartments since no outside air ventilation is possible, and a larger particulate load is imposed on the filtration system {{due to lack of}} gravitational settling. The ISS Environmental Control and Life Support System (ECLSS) uses a filtration system that has been in use for over 14 years and has proven to meet this challenge. The heart of this system is a traditional High-Efficiency Particulate Air (HEPA) filter configured to interface {{with the rest of the}} life support elements and provide effective cabin filtration. The filter element for this system has a non-standard cross-section with a length-to-width ratio (LW) of 6. 6. A filter test setup was designed and built to meet industry testing standards. A CFD analysis was performed to initially determine the optimal duct geometry and flow configuration. Both a screen and flow straighter were added to the test duct design to improve flow uniformity and face velocity profiles were subsequently measured to confirm. Flow quality and aerosol mixing assessments show that the duct flow is satisfactory for the intended leak testing. Preliminary leak testing was performed on two different ISS filters, one with known perforations and one with limited use, and results confirmed that the testing methods and photometer instrument are sensitive enough to detect and locate compromised sections of an ISS BFE. Given the engineering constraints in designing spacecraft life support systems, it is anticipated that non-industry standard filters will be required in future designs. This work is focused on developing test protocols for testing the ISS BFE filters, but the methodology is general enough to be extended to other present and future spacecraft filters. These techniques for characterizing the test duct and perform leak testing can be applied to conducting acceptance testing and inventory testing for future manned exploration programs with air revitalization filtration needs, possibly even for in-situ <b>filter</b> element <b>integrity</b> <b>testing</b> for extensively long-duration missions.

Purpose L ike many constructs in individual differences psychol-ogy, integrity can best be thought of as an open concept, with unclear boundaries and an unclear inner nature. Although there is no widespread agreement on the operational definition of integrity, most authors appear to agree that this construct incorporates a tendency to comply with social norms, avoid deviant behavior, and a embrace a sense of justice, truthfulness, and fairness (Becker, 2005). Most studies of <b>integrity</b> <b>tests</b> have investigated their relationships with the Big Five personality traits, with a particular focus on their significant associations with Conscientiousness (Ones, 1993). Nevertheless, the relation between Big Five Conscientiousness and the broader construct of morality ostensibly assessed by many <b>integrity</b> <b>tests</b> remains controversial (Loevinger, 1994; Spirrison, 1994). Moreover, relatively little research has examined how <b>integrity</b> <b>tests</b> relate tomore explicit correlates ofmora-lity. Thus, the present study is designed to determine how <b>integrity</b> <b>tests</b> relate to three other constructs believed to be related tomorality: ego development, moral reasoning, and psychopathic personality.

40|$|The {{psychological}} {{meaning of}} <b>integrity</b> <b>test</b> scores has been explored predominantly {{in relation to}} the five-factor model of personality (FFM). Two alternative positions on this topic can be identified in the literature which state, respectively, that <b>integrity</b> <b>tests</b> measure (a) a higher-order factor of personality covering three FFM dimensions or (b) a linear composite of numerous facets from various domains within the FFM. An empirical test of these alternative positions, using structural equation modeling, revealed that the value of both views depended on the type of <b>integrity</b> <b>test</b> examined. With a personality-based <b>integrity</b> <b>test,</b> position (a) had to be refuted, whereas position (b) was strongly supported. There was also more supportive evidence for position (b) with an overt test, but the difference was far less pronounced than for the personality-based measure. Possible consequences for theories on the role of personality in personnel selection are discussed. T he criterion-related validity of <b>integrity</b> <b>tests</b> forpersonnel selection has been established through extensive research, as summarized in a large-scale meta-analysis (Ones, Viswesvaran, & Schmidt, 1993). There is also evidence that <b>integrity</b> <b>tests</b> are among the most effective selection tools in terms of incremental validity over cognitive abilities (Schmidt & Hunter, 1998). Hence, the practical value of these instruments in general seems no longer a matter of debate. Consequently, the major research interest shifted to more theoretical issues in recent years (compare the relative space devoted to construct- and criterion-related validity in two major, successive reviews of the field by Sackett, Burris,&Callahan, 1989; Sackett& Wanek, 1996). The crucial point now appears to be why <b>integrity</b> <b>tests</b> are valid, which is closely connected to the question what they measure.
