5|$|White {{was then}} {{appointed}} a {{judge of the}} <b>General</b> <b>Court</b> of Virginia on November 16, 1793, and he continued to hold that office {{until his death in}} 1831. In that period, White served {{as the president of the}} <b>General</b> <b>Court</b> of Virginia for several years before his death. Serving on the <b>General</b> <b>Court</b> of Virginia required White to travel to Richmond in June and November of each year.

5|$|The <b>General</b> <b>Court</b> was {{the chief}} {{legislative}} and judicial body of the colony. It was elected by the freemen from among their own number and met regularly in Plymouth, the capital town of the colony. As part of its judicial duties, it would periodically call a Grand Enquest, which was a grand jury of sorts elected from the freemen, who would hear complaints and swear out indictments for credible accusations. The <b>General</b> <b>Court,</b> and later lesser town and county courts, would preside over trials of accused criminals and over civil matters, but the ultimate decisions were made by a jury of freemen.|$|E

5|$|After Parliament {{partially}} repealed the Townshend {{duties in}} 1770, Boston's boycott of British goods ended. Politics became quieter in Massachusetts, although tensions remained. Hancock tried {{to improve his}} relationship with Governor Hutchinson, who in turn sought to woo Hancock away from Adams's influence. In April 1772, Hutchinson approved Hancock's election as colonel of the Boston Cadets, a militia unit whose primary function {{was to provide a}} ceremonial escort for the governor and the <b>General</b> <b>Court.</b> In May, Hutchinson even approved Hancock's election to the Council, the upper chamber of the <b>General</b> <b>Court,</b> whose members were elected by the House but subject to veto by the governor. Hancock's previous elections to the Council had been vetoed, but now Hutchinson allowed the election to stand. Hancock declined the office, however, not wanting to appear to have been co-opted by the governor. Nevertheless, Hancock used the improved relationship to resolve an ongoing dispute. To avoid hostile crowds in Boston, Hutchinson had been convening the legislature outside of town; now he agreed to allow the <b>General</b> <b>Court</b> to sit in Boston once again, to the relief of the legislators.|$|E
