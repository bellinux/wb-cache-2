5|$|Heart {{disease is}} listed by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services {{as the number}} one {{cause of death for}} all women. Factors that add to risk of heart disease include obesity and smoking, both of which are more {{prevalent}} in lesbians. Studies show that lesbians have a higher body mass and are generally less concerned about weight <b>issues</b> <b>than</b> heterosexual women, and lesbians consider women with higher body masses to be more attractive than heterosexual women do. Lesbians are more likely to exercise regularly than heterosexual women, and lesbians do not generally exercise for aesthetic reasons, although heterosexual women do. Research is needed to determine specific causes of obesity in lesbians.|$|E
5|$|Mitchell was {{subsequently}} posted to the British Army of the Rhine {{with the rest}} of the regiment, and then joined the King's African Rifles, and was posted to East Africa. Soon afterward, he saw action in Zanzibar with the KAR in breaking up disturbances between the island's Arab and African populations, which had begun during a general election and had descended into widespread rioting and clashes. He also participated in operations on the Northern Frontier District. At the time, Somali guerrillas were launching raids as part of a campaign to unite the region with Somalia, and the frontiers with other neighbouring states were also volatile. In one incident, Mitchell was searching for Somali guerrillas in a low-flying helicopter, and an elephant attempted to attack the helicopter, nearly clipping it with its tusks. It has been claimed that while with the KAR Mitchell was instrumental in obtaining a commission for Idi Amin, who later became President of Uganda. Mitchell's familiarity with the Scottish clan system made him more comfortable with African tribal <b>issues</b> <b>than</b> was the case with his English contemporaries. Impressed by Mitchell and other Scottish officers, Amin would later adopt the title King of Scotland.|$|E
5|$|Some {{academics}} {{suggest that}} the insurgency in Kashmir is at least partly {{a result of the}} manner in which it was integrated into India. Kashmir, uniquely amongst princely states, was not required to sign either a Merger Agreement or a revised Instrument of Accession giving India control over a larger number of <b>issues</b> <b>than</b> the three originally provided for. Instead, the power to make laws relating to Kashmir was granted to the Government of India by Article 5 of the Constitution of Jammu and Kashmir and was, under Article 370 of the Constitution of India, somewhat more restricted than in relation to other states. Widmalm argues that during the 1980s, a number of Kashmiri youth began to feel that the Indian government was increasingly interfering in the politics of Jammu and Kashmir. The elections of 1987 caused them to lose faith in the political process and begin the violent insurgency which is still ongoing. Similarly, Ganguly suggests that the policies of the Indian government towards Kashmir meant that the state, unlike other parts of India, never developed the solid political institutions associated with a modern multi-ethnic democracy. As a result, the growing dissatisfaction with the status quo felt by an increasingly politically aware youth was expressed through non-political channels which Pakistan, seeking to weaken India's hold over Kashmir, transformed into an active insurgency.|$|E

25|$|A YouGov poll {{held in the}} United Kingdom in 2015 {{found that}} Catholics had a more liberal {{attitude}} towards gay marriage than Protestants, although both groups are less accepting on the <b>issues</b> <b>than</b> the public as a whole. 50% of Catholics support gay marriage (compared to 45% of Protestants, and 66% {{of people in the}} UK as a whole).|$|E

Around 20 February however, mainland sites took action to prevent access to the photos.|$|E
25|$|The two {{organizations}} had other differences as well. The NWSA was politically independent, but the AWSA {{at least initially}} aimed for close ties with the Republican Party, hoping that the ratification of the Fifteenth Amendment {{would lead to a}} Republican push for women's suffrage. The NWSA focused primarily on winning suffrage at the national level while the AWSA pursued a state-by-state strategy. The NWSA initially worked on a wider range of women's <b>issues</b> <b>than</b> the AWSA, including divorce reform and equal pay for women.|$|E

25|$|The 567D's {{turbocharger}} {{is perhaps}} the least maintainable part of such an engine, and the 567D turbo has many more maintenance <b>issues</b> <b>than</b> 645E and later turbos. A common choice is conversion of a 567D turbo engine to Roots-blown, thereby abandoning the turbo and its many issues. Installation of 645 power assemblies will still allow Roots-converted 4-axle locomotives (GP20s) to produce , as does a Roots-blown 16-645E, thereby becoming the functional equivalent of a GP38, although with older electrical equipment and controls, and, of course, the older carbody.|$|E
25|$|During {{the next}} two years, Bitar, Aflaq and other {{associates}} edited a review entitled al-Tali`a (the vanguard). According to Batatu, this publication displayed more concern with social <b>issues</b> <b>than</b> with national problems. Bitar and Aflaq's political stance was closer to the Syrian Communist Party than {{to any of the}} other political groups in Damascus. They became disillusioned with the Communists in 1936, after the Popular Front government came to power in France. Although the French Communist Party was now part of the government, France's approach to its colonies barely changed. Bitar and Aflaq were unhappy with the Syrian party's stance in these circumstances.|$|E
25|$|Observers have {{generally}} described Gamergate {{as part of}} a long-running culture war against efforts to diversify the traditionally male video gaming community, particularly targeting outspoken women. They cite Gamergate supporters' frequent harassment of female figures in the gaming industry and its overt hostility toward people involved in social criticism and analysis of video games. Vox said that Gamergate supporters were less interested in criticizing ethical <b>issues</b> <b>than</b> in opposition to social criticism and analysis of video games and in harassment of prominent women. Ars Technica quoted early members as saying that they had no interest in videogames and were primarily interested in attacking Quinn. In First Things, Nathaniel Givens described Gamergate as a reaction to the aggressive promotion of a progressive environment in video game culture.|$|E

25|$|Women {{tend to have}} {{different}} occupational hazards and health <b>issues</b> <b>than</b> men in the workplace. Women get carpal tunnel syndrome, tendonitis, anxiety disorders, stress, respiratory diseases, and infectious diseases due to their work at higher rates than men. The reasons for these differences may be differences in biology or in the work that women are performing. Women's higher rates of job-related stress {{may be due to}} the fact that women are often caregivers at home and do contingent work and contract work at a much higher rate than men. Another significant occupational hazard for women is homicide, which was the second most frequent cause of death on the job for women in 2011, making up 26% of workplace deaths in women. Immigrant women are at higher risk for occupational injury than native-born women in the United States, due to higher rates of employment in dangerous industries.|$|E
25|$|Other <b>issues</b> <b>than</b> the tariff {{were still}} being decided. In May 1830 Jackson vetoed the Maysville Road Bill an {{important}} internal improvements program (especially to Kentucky and Henry Clay), and then followed this with additional vetoes of other such projects shortly before Congress adjourned {{at the end of}} May. Clay would use these vetoes to launch his presidential campaign. In 1831 the re-chartering of the Bank of the United States, with Clay and Jackson on opposite sides, reopened a long simmering problem. This issue was featured at the December 1831 National Republican convention in Baltimore which nominated Henry Clay for president, and the proposal to re-charter was formally introduced into Congress on January 6, 1832. The Calhoun-Jackson split entered the center stage when Calhoun, as vice-president presiding over the Senate, cast the tie-breaking vote to deny Martin Van Buren the post of minister to England. Van Buren was subsequently selected as Jackson’s running mate at the 1832 Democratic National Convention held in May.|$|E
25|$|Many of the {{problems}} encountered will benefit from special attention, as problems are often related more to “input and output” <b>issues</b> <b>than</b> to intellectual impairment. Problems with eye movement control {{make it difficult for}} people with A-T to read, yet most fully understand the meaning and nuances of text that is read to them. Delays in speech initiation and lack of facial expression make it seem that they do not know the answers to questions. Reduction of the skilled effort needed to answer questions, and an increase of the time available to respond, is often rewarded by real accomplishment. It {{is important to recognize that}} intellectual disability is not regularly a part of the clinical picture of A-T although school performance may be suboptimal because of the many difficulties in reading, writing, and speech. Children with A-T are often very conscious of their appearance, and strive to appear normal to their peers and teachers. Life within the ataxic body can be tiring. The enhanced effort needed to maintain appearances and increased energy expended in abnormal tone and extra movements all contribute to physical and mental fatigue. As a consequence, for some a shortened school day yields real benefits.|$|E

Christensen {{came to be known}} as the [...] "Grand Mother" [...] among racially oriented Odinists, with many paying homage to her even if they had sought out a more aggressive approach to racial <b>issues</b> <b>than</b> that which she adopted. Alternately, many in the Odinist community know her as the [...] "Folk Mother".
