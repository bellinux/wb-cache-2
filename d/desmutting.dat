40|$|Abstract. The {{demand for}} new {{protection}} systems for aluminium alloys that might inhibit corrosion {{to the performance}} level of chromate, has driven the search for replacement candidates. Lanthanide compounds represent a promising alternative incorporating an environmental issue of significant impact, since chromate treatments are highly toxic and still used on both civil and military aircraft. A Ce based treatment was developed for use on structural alloy Al 2024 -T 3 implemented as a dipping process, {{without the use of}} external polarisation. The formation time was shortened by means of addition of a catalytic agent, hydrogen peroxide. When prior to the conversion coating formation, a chemical pre-treatment and a <b>desmutting</b> procedure was performed, no significant improvement was found in the susceptibility to pitting. This is thought to be probably due to the formation of a copper rich layer, as a result of etching, and the attack suffered by intermetallics during the chemical pre-treatment...|$|E
40|$|The {{development}} of cerium-rich layers on anodized pure aluminum and AA 7075 T 6 aluminum alloy {{has been investigated}} using scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. The surfaces of pure aluminum and AA 7075 T 6 were pre-treated by alkaline etching and HNO 3 <b>desmutting</b> followed by anodizing in sulfuric acid electrolyte with and without addition of tartaric acid. The outer layer is created by immersion in a cerium (III) nitrate solution containing hydrogen peroxide. It is shown that anodizing {{in a mixture of}} sulfuric and tartaric acids prior to the immersion treatment leads to the formation of a thicker and a more uniform cerium-rich layer. The ultramicrotomed sections display the presence of cerium species within the pores of the anodic film. This treatment significantly improves the corrosion resistance of the material.

40|$|Wrought Al-Mn alloys {{can develop}} a thin {{deformed}} layer on the surface {{as a result of}} hot and cold rolling. Subsequent heat-treatment precipitates fine secondary intermetallic particles which effect corrosion susceptibility. This work focuses on the effect of surface preparation and deformation on the electrochemical behaviour of Al-Mn alloys. The first part of the work investigated the effect of surface preparation such as mechanical grinding and polishing, alkaline etching and <b>desmutting,</b> and nitric acid treatment on electrochemical behaviour of an Al- 1 Mn- 0. 4 Fe- 0. 3 Si model alloy. Different surface preparations of this alloy show different electrochemical behaviour. In {{the second part of the}} work, the electrochemical reactivity of the surface layers of commercial rolled AA 3005 sheet was investigated by profiling through the surface with GDOES (glow discharge optical emission spectroscopy). The microstructure and electrochemical reactivity was examined at different depths in order to compare the behaviour of the surface layers with that of the bulk alloy. In order to understand the role of deformation on corrosion behaviour of Al-Mn alloy, an Al- 1 Mn- 0. 4 Fe- 0. 3 Si model alloy was deformed by uniaxial compression and equal channel angular extrusion (ECAE) and followed by annealing. It was found that deformation is likely to have two effects on the surface of Al-Mn alloy. One effect is to cause the precipitation of particles that act as local cathodes and pit initiation sites. The other effect is that formation of precipitates will deplete the adjacent matrix in solute, making it more susceptible to dissolution.

40|$|Desmin {{mutations}} underlie inherited myopathies/cardiomyopathies {{with varying}} severity and {{involvement of the}} skeletal and cardiac muscles. We developed a transgenic mouse model expressing low level of the L 345 P desmin mutation (<b>DESMUT</b> mice) in order to uncover changes in skeletal and cardiac muscles caused by this mutation. The most striking ultrastructural changes in muscle from <b>DESMUT</b> mice were mitochondrial swelling and vacuolization. The mitochondrial Ca 2 + level was significantly increased in skeletal and cardiac myocytes from <b>DESMUT</b> mice compared to wild type cells during and after contractions. In isolated <b>DESMUT</b> soleus muscles, contractile function and recovery from fatigue were impaired. A SHIRPA screening test for neuromuscular performance demonstrated decreased motor function in <b>DESMUT</b> compared to WT mice. Echocardiographic changes in <b>DESMUT</b> mice included left ventricular wall hypertrophy and a decreased left ventricular chamber dimension. The results imply that low levels of L 345 P desmin acts, at least partially, by a dominant negative effect on mitochondria...|$|R
40|$|In {{an effort}} to {{maximize}} grain growth of open-die forged 6061 aluminum alloy parts, samples from three of Weber Metals’s suppliers (Hidal Co-Almex USA Inc., TST Inc., and Vista Metals Corp.; to be called Supplier H, Supplier T, Supplier V respectively) were cut into cylinders with diameters of 0. 75 ˝ and heights of 2 ˝, and put through a simulated forging process and heat treatment. It is possible that additional alloying elements may be promoting or inhibiting grain growth in the final part. Maximizing grain growth for aluminum alloy parts results in improved resistance to intergranular corrosion. Samples from each vendor had grain size analysis performed prior to running the experiment. Samples were heated to just over 650 ºF so that when placed in the Instron compression machine for simulated forging they would be between the usual forging temperatures for aluminum of 550 to 650 ºF. Samples were compressed {{at a rate of}} 50 mils/second to final strain values of 0 %, 5 %, 10 %, 20 %, and 50 %. The samples were then heat treated at 1050 ºF for a soak of 4 hours. This allows for maximum grain growth to occur before being removed and quenched in water to room temperature. A sectioning, sanding to 600 grit sandpaper, etching with 10 % NaOH, and <b>desmut</b> with 33. 33 % nitric acid allows for grain size analysis to determine which vendor had the largest grain size at each strain value. Grain size measurements were made according to the Heyn Lineal Intercept Procedure from ASTM E 0112 - 12. 1 Supplier H’s alloy with 0 % forging strain applied provided the largest average grain size at 1754 µm...|$|R
40|$|A luminum is an {{extremely}} use-ful metal and has been essen-tial to industrial manufactur-ing for many years. Aluminum has applications {{in most of the}} metal fabrication industries including au-tomotive, appliance, aircraft and architectural. It continues to make inroads into new markets. One of aluminum’s beneficial properties is the natural formation of aluminum oxides on the metal surface that protect against general corrosion. However, this natural oxide layer has two shortcomings. It has poor adhesion to the base metal and is susceptible to localized corrosion. Upon initial exposure to air, alu-minum immediately reacts to form oxides at the surface. These non-adherent oxides continue to form indefinitely-even under paint.

40|$|Even though highly {{corrosion}} resistant in general, AlMgSi (6000 -series) alloys may sometimes develop susceptibility to intergranular corrosion (IGC). In this work {{the effect of}} Cu content and various thermomechanical treatments on IGC of AlMgSi model alloy extrusions of nominal composition 0. 55 wt% Mg and 0. 60 wt%Si was investigated. The corrosion susceptibility was tested according to the standard BS 11846 method B, which essentially involved degreasing, alkaline etching, <b>desmutting</b> in concentrated HNO 3 and 24 h immersion in an acidified NaCl solution. The validity of this test as a reliable laboratory tool for qualitative ranking of samples for IGC susceptibility was verified by comparing it to results obtained by outdoor exposure in an industrial-marine environment at Karmøy, located {{on the coast of}} Norway The most important factor causing IGC susceptibility of the model alloys was the Cu content. The high Cu models were susceptible to IGC, although the Cu content was as low as 0. 12 – 0. 17 wt. % Cu. Model alloys with low Cu content (0. 005 – 0. 02 wt. %) were resistant. However, the corrosion mode of the high Cu alloys was strongly related to the thermomechanical history. Therefore, by applying the correct heat treatment, it was possible to reduce or eliminate IGC susceptibility also on the high Cu samples. Samples which were slow-cooled (air cooling) after extrusion and samples which were subsequently solution heat treated gave the most susceptible variants where nearly all grain boundaries exposed to the corrosive test solution were attacked (uniform IGC). Artificial aging reduced the IGC susceptibility by confining the intergranular attacks to localised sites (localised IGC), and near fully resistance to localised corrosion developed in the peak aged temper. Rapid quenching (water quenching) after extrusion prevented IGC, but high susceptibility (uniform IGC) was introduced as a result of short time aging. Further aging to peak hardness reduced IGC susceptibility (local IGC), but did not remove it completely. Overaging introduced slight pitting susceptibility to the air cooled extrusion. In contrast overaging reintroduced localised IGC to the solution heat treated air cooled samples. The solution heat treated and water quenched samples were susceptible to localised IGC both in the the T 6 temper (peak aged) and in the overaged temper. The grain boundary microstructure was also strongly dependent on the thermal history. Samples which were slow-cooled (air cooling) after extrusion and samples which were subsequently solution heat treated exhibited extensive precipitation of large (_ 5 μm) elongated grain boundary precipitates of the equilibrium phases _ (Mg 2 Si) and Q (Al 4 Mg 8 Si 7 Cu 2). The Q-phase was however not present on the low Cu alloys. The shape and size of these precipitates were not affected by artificial aging. On the high Cu alloy, a Cu enriched grain boundary film was additionally present. This film coarsened as a result of artificial aging. Water quenching after extrusion effectively prevented grain boundary precipitation, and this could thus explain the observed resistance of the water quenched high Cu alloys to IGC. Small grain boundary Q-phase precipitates evolved as a result of artificial aging of water quenched samples, which explained slight deterioration of IGC resistance of such samples. The susceptibility to IGC was related to enriched Cu along the grain boundaries, in the form of discrete Q-phase precipitates and the continuous Cu enriched film. IGC was caused by a microgalvanic coupling between the Cu enriched grain boundary (noble) and the adjacent solute depleted zone (active). The Cu containing film formed a continuous cathodic path on the grain boundaries, which resulted in significant (uniform) IGC, characterised by knife-edge attacks along the grain boundaries. Increased IGC resistance was obtained by artificial aging which coarsened the film and broke the continuous microgalvanic path, resulting in coarse localised IGC or a surface virtually resistant to all forms of localised corrosion. The present work showed that IGC can be avoided or eliminated either by reducing the Cu content or applying the correct thermomechanical treatment. dr. ing. dr. ing...|$|E
40|$|The {{study is}} aimed at {{exploration}} of a silane-based alternative to the hazardous chromate conversion coating (CCC) presently employed for aluminium alloy AA 2024 -T 3 {{with a focus on}} optimising surface preparation and microstructure for coating performance. The corrosion performance of bis-(triethoxysilylpropyl) tetrasulphide silane as a conversion coating on aluminium alloy AA 2024 -T 3 and its principal constituent phases namely AI-Cu(-Mg) solid solution and intermetallic compounds AhCuMg and AhCu 2 Fe, has been examined. The study included evaluation of the effects of various surface pretreatments on the electrochemical behaviour, topography and surface potential of AA 2024 -T 3 and its constituents. Different methods of surface preparation/polishing and the effect of metallurgical processing intricacies (aging, supersaturation and quenching medium) on the electrochemical behaviour of the phases representing AA 2024 -T 3 matrix were examined. The study also included evaluation of the formation and stability of M-O¬Si bond for AA 2024 -T 3, its matrix and elemental constituents, through application of self-assembled monolayers (SAMs). The electrochemical behaviour of the surfaces polished by mechanical and chemical techniques, and the effects of metallurgical processing intricacies were examined by measurement of open circuit potential (OCP) in O. 6 M NaCI aqueous solution by flat-cell and micro-cell potentiostats, and surface potential measurement in air employing Scanning Kelvin Probe Force Microscopy (SKPFM). Surface pretreatment (alkali treatment, alkali and <b>desmutting</b> treatments, and boiling water treatment) studies involved measurement of OCP, surface topography by Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) and surface potential by SKPFM. The performance of silane coated AA 2024 -T 3 and its constituents was examined by DC polarisation studies, 30 -day electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) in O. 6 M NaCI solution and salt spray tests (168 h, 5 % NaCl, 35 - 37 °C) according to ASTM B 117. The formation and stability of the metal M-O-Si bond for AA 2024 -T 3 and constituents was examined through deposition of self-assembled monolayers of long hydrocarbon chain silane and evaluation of stability in H 20, O. lM NaCl and O. 6 M NaCI as a function of immersion time. The most remarkable finding of the work was the observation that a boiling water pretreatment prior to silane application produced a coating of exceptional corrosion performance. The corrosion rate in DC polarisation test (typically of 0. 002 f. lAcm- 2) was as much as one and half orders of magnitude lower than that for benchmark chromate conversion coating (CCC) (typically 0. 098 f. lAcm- 2). The boiling water treatment resulted in a thin film (typically ~ 600 nm thickness) of hydrated alumina Ah 03. xH 20 (pseudo boehmite, PB) on AA 2024 -T 3 and all constituent phases with the exception of AhCuMg (S). The pseudoboehmite film comprised a dense network of flake-like crystals oriented approximately normal to the metal surface and exposing a large surface area to the coating system. It is suggested that the large surface area may promote extensive M¬O-Si bonding between the pseudoboehmite layer and the silane molecules to improve the effectiveness of the subsequent coating. The silane-coated secondary phase constituents did not perform as satisfactorily as the coated alloy matrix (AI-Cu solid solution) or the coated alloy AA 2024 -T 3 itself. The reasons appeared {{to be associated with the}} absence of pseudoboehmite layer on AhCuMg (S-phase) and a less dense network of pseudoboehmite microstructure on AhCu 2 Fe. £IS study showed that the AA 2024 ¬T 3 IPB/siiane system maintained higher impedance as compared to AA 2024 -T 3 /CCC during the 30 -day period of test in the entire frequency range (O. OIHz- 550 kHz). The performance of the AA 2024 -T 3 IPBIsilane coating system in standard salt spray tests was also superior when compared to AA 2024 -T 3 /CCC. Other notable findings of the study included observations of: 1. Nobility associated with abrasive entrapment in aluminium during mechanical polishing for preparation of a standard surface. 2. Variations in OCP due to processing effects related to solute supersaturation, aging behaviour and choice of quenching medium. 3. Choice of boiling water pretreatment as a corrosion retarding process. The investigation of SAMs on AA 2024 -T 3, AI-Cu solid solution and elemental Cu and Mg, exposed to water and NaCI solution, showed that silane bonds to all the constituents of the aluminium alloy AA 2024 -T 3. All the SAMs were susceptible to destabilisation by water and chloride solution. However, Mg was most susceptible to attack by the chloride solution in terms of kinetics of stability. The presence of PB delayed desorption of SAMs...|$|E
