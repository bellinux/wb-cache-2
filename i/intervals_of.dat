40|$|Background.

However, it can be inconvenient to perform follow-up tests with <b>interval</b> <b>of</b> 12 weeks. We investigated clinical application of follow-up tests with <b>interval</b> <b>of</b> 12 weeks. Method. Totals of 67, 199, and 332 patients tested positive initially for the lupus anticoagulants confirm, the anti-β 2 glycoprotein-I antibody, and the anti-cardiolipin antibody test, respectively, from Jan 2007 to Jul 2009.

Among patients with initial test positive, 1. 5 %– 8. 5 % were subjected to follow-up tests at <b>interval</b> <b>of</b> more than 12 weeks. Among 25 patients with negative conversion in tests, patients with <b>interval</b> <b>of</b> more than 12 weeks showed clinical symptom positivity of 33. 3 %, which was higher than that of 12. 5 % with 6 – 12 weeks.
