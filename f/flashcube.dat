50|$|In {{the late}} 1960s Kodak {{improved}} their Instamatic camera line by replacing the individual flashbulb technology (used on early Instamatics) with the <b>Flashcube.</b> A <b>flashcube</b> was a single-use module with four flashbulbs mounted at 90° {{from the others}} in its own reflector. For use it was mounted on a swivel mechanism atop the camera that also provided an electrical connection to the shutter release and a battery inside the camera. After each exposure, the film advance mechanism also rotated the <b>flashcube</b> 90° to a fresh bulb. This arrangement allowed the user to take four images in rapid succession before inserting a new <b>flashcube.</b>|$|E

Cameras {{requiring}} <b>flashcubes</b> have a round socket and a round hole for the <b>flashcube's</b> pin, while those requiring Magicubes have a round shape with protruding studs and a square socket hole for the Magicube's square pin.

50|$|In 1964, Warner orchestrated a {{deal that}} merged Western Utilities Corporation, the nation's second-largest {{independent}} telephone company, with 635,000 telephones, into GT&E. The following year Sylvania introduced the revolutionary four-sided <b>flashcube,</b> enhancing its position as the world's largest flashbulb producer. Acquisitions in telephone service continued under Warner during the mid-1960s. Purchases included Quebec Telephone in Canada, Hawaiian Telephone Company, and Northern Ohio Telephone Company and added a total of 622,000 telephone lines to GT&E operations. By 1969, GT&E was serving ten million telephones.|$|E
50|$|The later Magicube (or X-Cube) {{retained}} the four-bulb format, and was superficially {{similar to the}} original <b>Flashcube.</b> However, the Magicube did not require electrical power. Each bulb was set off by a plastic pin in the cube mount that released a cocked spring wire within the cube. This wire struck a primer tube {{at the base of}} the bulb, which contained a fulminate, which in turn ignited shredded zirconium foil in the flash. Magicubes could also be fired by inserting a thin object, such as a key or paper clip, into one of the slots in the bottom of the cube.|$|E

5000|$|A {{new series}} of Instamatics was {{introduced}} in 1970 {{to take advantage of}} the new Magicube flash technology. Magicubes used mechanically triggered pyrotechnic detonators for each bulb, an improvement over <b>flashcubes</b> in that the need for batteries was eliminated. Instamatics with Magicube sockets were denoted by an [...] "X" [...] in the model number (e.g. X-15 or 55X).|$|R
50|$|The lineup {{was soon}} {{expanded}} to include a variety of models from the basic but popular 100/104 to the automatic exposure 800/804, which featured an aluminum chassis, rangefinder, selenium light meter, and clockwork spring wind. (The 100/104 designation refers {{to the type of}} flash: models ending in 0 had a built-in flashgun, while those ending in 4 used <b>flashcubes.)</b> The top-of-the-line model was the Instamatic Reflex SLR, which was made in Germany and could accept a variety of Retina S-mount lenses.|$|R
40|$|Flash + Cube (1965 - 1975) is an artist’s {{book about}} the Sylvania flashcube—the space-aged, flash {{photography}} device, revolutionary in 1965 and nearly obsolete by 1975. Assembled {{from a wide range}} of archival materials—a “terrorist letter,” G. I. photographs from Vietnam, Sylvania <b>flashcube</b> advertisements, as well as Long’s photographs and photomontages—the book explores the links between light, war, history and photography. Apart from its circulation as a novelty item online, the <b>flashcube</b> is largely forgotten. The history of photographic flash is also often relegated to a footnote and is strikingly under-analyzed. Yet flash’s blinding effects and military genealogy, and the flashcube’s precise contemporaneity with the war in Vietnam make this a rich analytical object with which to reflect on the cultural, political and economic imperatives of its moment. As Long’s deft work with this archive shows, the <b>flashcube</b> is good to think with...|$|E
40|$|Introduction {{to modern}} {{standard}} Chinese (Mandarin) {{with emphasis on}} developing conversational skills by using fundamental grammatical patterns and vocabulary in functional and cultural suitable contexts. Basic reading and writing are also taught. Work in the language laboratory is coordinated with, and supplemented to, class work. For graduate credit, see 21 F. 151. Description from course home page: This subject is the first semester of two that form an introduction to modern standard Chinese, commonly called Mandarin. Though not everyone taking this course will be an absolute beginner, the course presupposes no prior background in the language. The emphasis is on developing (a) basic conversational abilities (pronunciation, fundamental grammatical patterns, common vocabulary, and standard usage), (b) basic reading and writing skills, and (c) {{an understanding of the}} language learning process so that students are able to continue studying effectively on their own. The main text is J. K. Wheatley’s Learning Chinese: A Foundation Course in Mandarin, part I (unpublished, but available online), which consists of several introductory chapters, seven core lessons (labeled 1, 2, 3 …) and six character lessons (labeled A, B, C…). (Part II of the book forms the basis of 21 F. 102, which will also be published on OpenCourseWare.) The core lessons of Learning Chinese present the language discursively, in English, topic by topic with example sentences, dialogues, conversations and narratives in romanization, interspersed with short exercises by which students can monitor their progress. These lessons serve the rapid accumulation of vocabulary, grammatical patterns and usage, primarily for conversation, but also for reading and composition. The character lessons relate to, but are not identical to the core lessons. They serve to introduce the written language (both the traditional character set and the simplified) at a manageable rate and in appropriate contexts. The two sets of lessons will be interleafed, with lesson 1 followed by A, lesson 2 by B, etc. Assistance in internalizing lesson material is provided by way of a computer program called <b>flashCube,</b> developed by Jordan Gilliland while a graduate student at MIT. <b>FlashCube</b> will not be available {{at the opening of the}} 21 F. 101 OCW site but will be added, along with supporting programs and documentation, in the near future. As the name suggests, <b>flashCube</b> delivers through the medium of the computer what has traditionally been provided by the folk-method of the flashcard, the vocabulary or phrase notebook, and the tape recorder. <b>FlashCube</b> stores, in a compact and convenient format, much of the Chinese material presented in Learning Chinese, and allows students to test themselves into and out of the spoken or written language...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} an exploratory {{study on the}} characteristics of inventive activities as captured {{on the basis of the}} analysis of a data-set of R&D awards. Our data source is the "R&D 100 Awards" competition organized by the journal Research and Development. Since 1963, the magazine (which at that time was called Industrial Research) has been awarding this prize to 100 most technologically significant new products available for sale or licensing in the year preceding the judgment. The jury is composed of university professors, industrial researchers and consultants with a certified level of competence in the specific areas they are called to asses. The main criteria for assessment are: i) technological significance (i. e., whether the product can be considered a major breakthrough), ii) competitive significance (i. e., how the product compares to rival solutions available on the market). Throughout the years, key breakthroughs inventions such as Polacolor film (1963), the <b>flashcube</b> (1965), the automated teller machine (1973), the halogen lamp (1974), the fax machine (1975), the liquid crystal display (1980), the printer (1986), the Kodak Photo CD (1991), the Nicoderm antismoking patch (1992), Taxol anticancer drug (1993), lab on a chip (1996), and HDTV (1998) have received the prize. We use these data to study the shifts in the distribution of innovative activities across countries, sectors and types of institutions and the changes in the sources of inventive activities over time. Our preliminary findings show: i) the emergence of a challenge to US technological leadership from other rival nations such as Japan and Germany, ii) the critical role of scientific instrumentation as a powerful source of technological breakthroughs, iii) a change in the institutional arrangements where innovative activities take place, from individual corporations, to partnerships increasingly involving public research organizations and universities, iv) a large chunk of inventive activities undertaken without patent protection. ...|$|E
