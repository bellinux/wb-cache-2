The U.S. Minister to China, George Seward, had asserted similar numbers in Scribner's Magazine five years earlier.|$|E

5|$|Modern Britons are descended {{mainly from}} the varied ethnic groups that settled in the British Isles in and before the 11th century: Prehistoric, Brittonic, Roman, Anglo-Saxon, Norse and Normans. The {{progressive}} political unification of the British Isles facilitated migration, cultural and linguistic exchange, and intermarriage between the peoples of England, Scotland and Wales during the late Middle Ages, early modern period and beyond. Since 1922 and earlier, there has been <b>immigration</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> Kingdom by people from {{what is now the}} Republic of Ireland, the Commonwealth, mainland Europe and elsewhere; they and their descendants are mostly British citizens, with some assuming a British, dual or hyphenated identity.|$|E
5|$|The Great Famine of 1845–1851 devastated Ireland, as {{in those}} years Ireland's {{population}} fell by one-third. More than one million people died from starvation and disease, while an additional two million people emigrated, mostly to the United States and Canada. By {{the end of the}} decade, half of all <b>immigration</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> States was from Ireland. The period of civil unrest that followed {{until the end of the}} 19th century is referred to as the Land War. Mass emigration became deeply entrenched and the population continued to decline until the mid-20th century. Immediately prior to the famine the population was recorded as 8.2 million by the 1841 census. The population has never returned to this level since. The population continued to fall until 1961 and it was not until the 2006 census that the last county of Ireland (County Leitrim) to record a rise in population since 1841 did so.|$|E

25|$|The first {{national}} Greek census after 1923, conducted in 1928, showed {{the number of}} the Greeks of Asia Minor origin to be 1,164,267 (probably over 3million). Some refugees had moved <b>to</b> Russia and <b>the</b> Middle East in previous years. Approximately 250,000 Greek Americans of Asia Minor descent had emigrated <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> States between 1866 and 1917, had American citizenship, and thereby would not become refugees; they would, however, be deprived from their property rights in their ancestral homeland, as well as from their right to return. It is usually estimated that the refugees in Greece numbered approximately 1.5million people. Descendants of the refugees took part in the great Greek migrations of the Interwar period, as well as <b>the</b> large <b>immigrations</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> States, Australia and Germany in the 1960s-1970s.

25|$|Jewish <b>immigration</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> States {{peaked in}} the period 1880–1924, with the {{immigrants}} arriving from Russia and countries in Eastern Europe; this was also a period of nativism (hostility to immigrants) in the United States.

Reports of Tay–Sachs disease contributed to a perception among nativists that Jews were an inferior race.|$|E
