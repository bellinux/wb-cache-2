40|$|Activity in {{descending}} motor pathways after scalp electrical and magnetic brain {{stimulation of the}} motor cortex was recorded from the exposed cervico-medullary junction in six patients having trans-oral surgery of the upper cervical spine. Recordings during deep anaesthesia without muscle paralysis revealed an initial negative potential (D wave) at about 2 ms with electrical stimulation {{in five of the}} six patients. This was followed by a muscle potential which obscured any later waveforms. Magnetic stimulation produced clear potentials in only one patient. The earliest wave to magnetic stimulation during deep anaesthesia was 1 - 2 ms later than the earliest potential to electrical stimulation. Following lightening of the anaesthetic and the administration of muscle relaxants a series of later negative potentials (<b>I</b> <b>waves)</b> were more clearly seen to both electrical and magnetic stimulation. More <b>I</b> <b>waves</b> were recorded to magnetic stimulation during light anaesthesia than during deep anaesthesia. Increasing the intensity of electrical stimulation also produced an extra late <b>I</b> <b>wave.</b> At the highest intensity of magnetic stimulation the latency of the earliest potential was comparable to the D wave to electrical stimulation. The intervals between these various D and <b>I</b> <b>waves</b> corresponded to those previously described for the timing of single motor unit discharge after cortical stimulation...|$|R

40|$|In paired-pulse {{cortical}} stimulation experiments, conditioning subthreshold stimuli {{suppress the}} electromyographic (EMG) responses of relaxed muscles to suprathreshold magnetic test stimuli at short interstimulus intervals (ISIs) (1 - 5 ms) and facilitate them at long ISIs (8 - 15 ms). We made paired-pulse magnetic stimulation {{studies on the}} response of the first dorsal interosseous muscle (FDI) produced by I 1 or <b>I</b> 3 <b>waves</b> using our previously reported method which preferentially elicits one group of <b>I</b> <b>waves</b> when subjects make a slight voluntary contraction. In some experiments the conditioning and test stimuli were oppositely directed, in the others they were oriented in the same direction. Single motor unit responses were recorded with a concentric needle electrode, and surface EMG responses with cup electrodes. In post-stimulus time histograms (PSTHs) of the firing probability of motor units, the peaks produced by <b>I</b> 3 <b>waves</b> were decreased by a subthreshold conditioning stimulus that preferentially elicited I 1 or <b>I</b> 3 <b>waves</b> at an ISI of 4 ms. The amount of decrement depended on the intensity of the conditioning stimulus. The stronger the conditioning stimulus, the greater the suppression. In contrast, the peaks produced by <b>I</b> 1 <b>waves</b> were little affected by any type of subthreshold conditioning stimulus, given 4 ms prior to the test stimulus. At an ISI of 10 ms, a subthreshold conditioning stimulus slightly decreased the size of the peak produced by the <b>I</b> 3 <b>waves,</b> but did not affect the peaks evoked by <b>I</b> 1 <b>waves.</b> Surface EMGs showed that a subthreshold conditioning stimulus suppressed the responses produced by <b>I</b> 3 <b>waves</b> irrespective of its current direction (anterior or posterior). Both the amount and duration of suppression depended on the intensity of the conditioning stimulus, but not on its current direction. Both parameters increased when the intensity increased. At a high intensity conditioning stimulus, suppression was evoked at ISIs of 1 - 20 ms, compatible with the duration of GABA-mediated inhibition found in animal experiments. Responses produced by <b>I</b> 1 <b>waves</b> were little affected by any type of subthreshold conditioning stimulus. We conclude that a subthreshold conditioning stimulus given over the motor cortex moderately suppresses <b>I</b> 3 <b>waves</b> but does not affect <b>I</b> 1 <b>waves.</b> The duration of suppression of the <b>I</b> 3 <b>waves</b> supports the idea that this is an effect of GABAergic inhibition within the motor cortex...|$|R

40|$|Short {{interval}} intracortical facilitation (SICF) can be elicited by {{transcranial magnetic stimulation}} (TMS) of {{the motor}} cortex (M 1) with a suprathreshold first stimulus (S 1) followed by a subthreshold second stimulus (S 2). SICF occurs at three distinct phases {{and is likely to}} be related to the generation of indirect (<b>I)</b> <b>waves.</b> Short interval intracortical inhibition (SICI) is an inhibitory phenomenon and intracortical facilitation (ICF) is an excitatory phenomenon occurring in the M 1 that can be studied with TMS. We studied the interactions between SICI/ICF and SICF in 17 healthy subjects. Six experiments were conducted. The first experiment examined the effects of different S 1 intensities on SICI, ICF and SICF at three peaks. The effects of SICI on SICF were tested by a triple-pulse TMS protocol in the second experiment. We performed Experiments 3 â€“ 5 to further test the interactions between SICI and SICF with various strengths of SICI, at SICF peaks and troughs, and with SICF generated by different current direction which preferentially generates late <b>I</b> <b>waves.</b> The effects of ICF on SICF were examined in Experiment 6. The results showed that ICF and SICF decreased whereas SICI increased with higher S 1 intensities. SICI facilitated SICF mediated by late <b>I</b> <b>waves</b> both at the peaks and the troughs of SICF. The increase of SICF in the presence of SICI correlated to the strength of SICI. ICF decreased the third peak of SICF. We conclude that SICI facilitates SICF at neuronal circuits responsible for generating late <b>I</b> <b>waves</b> through disinhibition, while ICF may have the opposite effects...|$|R
