We used PES fibers (1. 4 dtex × 38 mm long) and CV fibers (1. 6 dtex × 38 mm long) to spin a 20 Tex blend yarn of PES (70 %) /CV (30 %) blend ratio. When the break <b>draft,</b> <b>adjustment</b> of distance between of aprons and roller pressure is not reasonable, controlling and leading of the fibers is not sufficient for proper orientation of the fibers in the yarn structure to produce a high quality yarn. Experimental results and statistical analysis show that the best yarn quality will be obtained under drafting conditions total draft of 38, 1. 2 break draft, 2. 8 mm distance between of aprons and maximum pressure of the production top roller (18 daN) ...|$|E

The main aim is to <b>draft</b> <b>adjustments</b> of the platforms to fulfil the requirements for the movement of people with reduced mobility. To decide which kind of platform is possible to build. Also to plan the adjustments to track bed and platforms taking into consideration what the customer of railway operation had ordered. To draft reconstruction taking into consideration how old and worn-out permanent way and substructure is, with the posibility to increasing track speed...|$|R

At first it deals with a manner of presentation of gardens and parks to visitors, also it describes the options of the programmes in terms of use. Emphasis is places {{on the needs of}} the visitors and the distribution of the target groups. In the selected model objects is a description of the historical and current status. Here are described biological, technical and complementary elements of the parks, recorded ways of presenting objects and noted existing software applications. Consequently, the proposed new elements of software usage in specific areas. Then there is an overall summary and evaluation of selected objects. On the basic of this assessment, the park is selected with the greatest potential for subsequent <b>drafting</b> <b>adjustments</b> to the program, which became a park inaccessible for a public, Landsberger´s park...|$|R

40|$|Modern {{scientists}} consider {{migration to}} be {{a tool that}} makes it possible to redistribute human capital, which is currently the most important resource. At that, of special interest are the peripheral regions of the country, including those with the cross-border status, where the influence of migration processes on the structure of population is most noticeable. The Pskov Oblast is currently the leader in Russia in terms of depopulation. Natural decline in the region’s population is only partially compensated by migration. In this regard, the role of migration in the solution of demographic issues of regional development {{is becoming more and more}} important. The article presents the analysis of migration processes in the Pskov Oblast in the post-Soviet period; the analysis is based on the processing of statistical data. The author attempts to explain the main trends in migration processes in the framework of the Pskov Oblast for the last 20 years. Informational base of the research is formed by the materials of Pskovstat. The research findings can be used in the <b>drafting</b> and <b>adjustment</b> of a concept for demographic development of the region...|$|R
5000|$|The story {{focuses on}} Lewis Orne, {{an agent for}} a {{government}} agency which develops 'lost planets.' After correctly identifying a warlike civilization on the planet Hamal, he is <b>drafted</b> into Investigative <b>Adjustment</b> (I-A), which manages dangerous planets. Under the auspices of I-A, he travels to various planets {{in order to maintain}} peace throughout the galaxy. At the same time, the priests of the planet Amel, who practice 'religious engineering', set about creating a god, something they have done numerous times before: [...] " [...] 'We do not know from what creature or thing the god will be born', the Abbod said. 'It could be one of you.' [...] " [...] After resolving a number of dangerous situations, Lewis is injured and has a near-death experience. Following this, his psychic powers develop, and after passing a series of tests he becomes a god.|$|R

[...] He and his family made generous donations to Tulane University (including a large collection of Mayan artifacts discovered in banana fields), the Zamorano Pan-American Agricultural School, and to other philanthropic ventures, including the Zionist movement through his personal acquaintance, beginning in the 1920s, with Chaim Weizmann. Zemurray supported President Franklin D. Roosevelt's New Deal policies, helping to <b>draft</b> the Agricultural <b>Adjustment</b> Administration industry codes http://www.bookrags.com/biography/samuel-zemurray/, and contributed financially to left-wing causes, such as The Nation magazine. despite Zemurray having written to The Nation in 1950 to dispute its earlier article which referred to the United Fruit Company as an [...] "obstacle of progress in Central America." [...] He created the Zemurray Foundation in 1951. His former mansion on Audubon Place is now the residence of Tulane's president.|$|R
40|$|In the {{previous}} century many theories were {{created for the}} teaching.   One {{of them is the}} constructivist method widely used. The focus of constructivist theory is oriented towards the pupil. It presupposes that the environment of learning should provide view points or different interpretations of reality, building knowledge, wealth content, and activities that are based on experience. Constructivism is focused on lore and knowledge and not in mechanic imitation of subject content. It is based on a persuasion that the person builds his lore based on his experience, mental structure and faiths used for interpretation of objects and phenomena. The mind is used like an instrument in the interpretation of the event, goals and prospects because they are personal and individual. The main goal of the survey is the coverage and elaboration of some theoretical and practical views, reported from a considered number of research examples about constructivist methods and an actual analysis of Albanian educational system. As a research methodology we have exploited quantitative data. National and international surveys are used, dedicated, to the evaluation of Albanian Pre-university educational system. In the last decadeAlbania, started adopting some reforms in the teaching methodology. Some experts in educational field published some textbooks and manuals about constructivist methods. Prior to these reforms in the field of teaching, policy making bodies approved ordinance and legal <b>drafts</b> in <b>adjustment</b> of this methodology. But even after these reforms, the Albanian educational system is behind the regional education system in regards to the achievements of pupils. The lack of specific training of educational staff, non-adaptation of educational software, inappropriate physical infrastructure of schools, the lack of technical equipments hamper the practicability of this method. Another aspect is insufficient financial budget dedicated to education. Albanian school is also guided and managed by leaders and teachers that follow traditional methods in teaching and administration...|$|R
