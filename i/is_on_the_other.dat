5|$|The central {{window of}} the North Aisle is a World War II {{memorial}} and a World War I memorial <b>is</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> side. The Moores Chantry Chapel (or Moor Hayes Chapel) occupying the easternmost bay of the North Aisle, was built by the Moor (alias Moore) family, long resident at Moor Hayes within the parish, and contains some original box pews. At the rear (western end) of the church are two large pieces of oak which make up a Golgotha which once rested {{on top of the}} Rood Screen. They are carved with rocks, skulls and bones. They were probably removed from the church in 1549 and cut into 2 pieces. For many years they remained in the graveyard.|$|E
5|$|The {{fountain}} {{is located}} in a highly visible spot on the downtown San Francisco waterfront, in Justin Herman Plaza, where Market Street meets The Embarcadero. The Hyatt Regency Hotel is {{at the edge of the}} plaza, adjacent to the other four highrise towers of the Embarcadero Center. Across The Embarcadero is the Ferry Building, and the eastern end of the California Street cable car line <b>is</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> side of the Hyatt Regency Hotel.|$|E
5|$|There are two {{instances}} where two separate stations {{share the same}} name: there is one Edgware Road station on the Circle, District and Hammersmith & City lines and another Edgware Road on the Bakerloo line, and there is one Hammersmith station on the District and Piccadilly lines and another Hammersmith station on the Circle and Hammersmith & City lines. Although the Circle and Hammersmith & City lines station at Paddington <b>is</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> side of the main line station to the Bakerloo, Circle and District lines station, it is shown as a single station on the current Tube map. It has been shown as two separate stations at different times in the past.|$|E

5|$|Imprisonment is {{considered}} any restraint on {{the freedom of}} movement, for however short a time. In Austin and another v Metropolitan Police Commissioner, seven hours was considered a sufficient {{period of time to}} constitute false imprisonment (although the claim was ultimately rejected due to the circumstances of a potentially hostile crowd of demonstrators). The requirement is complete restraint; in Bird v Jones, the defendant fenced off part of a footpath for use as a viewing point for a boat race. The claimant, accustomed to walking across it, climbed into the enclosure; the defendants refused to let him pass. They were found not liable for false imprisonment, as another way across existed. There <b>is</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> hand no requirement that the claimant actually attempt to leave, as in Grainger v Hill, or even that he knows he is being prevented from leaving, as in Meering v Graham-White Aviation Co Ltd.|$|E

25|$|All of the ARBs, {{except for}} {{valsartan}} and olmesartan, are metabolized {{in some way}} by the cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzyme 2C9, that {{is found in the}} human liver. CYP2C9 is for example responsible for the metabolizing of losartan to EXP 3174 and the slow metabolizing of valsartan and candesartan to their inactive metabolites. Telmisartan <b>is,</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> hand, in part metabolized by glucuronidation and olmesartan is excreted as the unchanged drug.|$|E
25|$|Arc Symphony was {{developed}} by Sophia Park and Penelope Evans using the game engine Twine. Both of them had prior experience with fan communities: Evans mentioned having {{been a member of}} message boards for the game The Sims 2 as a child and having nostalgic feelings for it, while Park said that although she did not miss old websites, bulletin board systems and mailing lists, they still were a part of her. Evans described the game's interactions as feeling like a real forum experience, saying that while people look at pixels at their screen, a real person <b>is</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> side, and that both parties get to accept or reject the other, with the possibility of hurting them.|$|E
25|$|The {{kingdom of}} Bhojakata, with its King Rukmi, Vidura, the ex-prime {{minister}} of Hastinapur and younger brother to Dhritarashtra, and Balarama {{were the only}} neutrals in this war. Rukmi wanted to join the war, but Arjuna refused to allow him because he had lost to Krishna during Rumini's swayavar and yet he boasted about his war strength and army, whereas Duryodhana did not want Arjuna's reject. Vidura {{did not want to}} see the bloodshed of the war and was insulted extremely by Duryodhana, although he was the embodiment of Dharama himself and would have won the war for the Kauravas. The powerful Balarama refused to fight at Kurukshetra, because he was both Bheema's and Duryodhana's coach in gadhayudhdh (fighting with maces) and his brother Krishna <b>is</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> side.|$|E

25|$|Traditionally a boat is {{organized}} so that alternate rowers row on {{port and starboard}} (or strokeside and bowside), with stroke on port side (having their blade to their own right) (strokeside). This is sometimes reversed, so that stroke <b>is</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> side (having their blade to their own left); such a boat is usually described as 'bow rigged'. This is often {{on the basis of}} the abilities of the available personnel, to allow putting an experienced starboard side (bowside) rower in the stroke seat, for example but it is the norm for UK coastal rowers where racing is done clockwise around buoys. The eight in the illustration at the top of this article is rigged strokeside. If the eight were bow rigged, the oar for the stroke (number 8) rower would be on the other side of the boat (bowside/starboard).|$|E
25|$|After {{passing through}} the vestibule, Dante and Virgil reach the ferry that will take them across the river Acheron and to Hell proper. The ferry is piloted by Charon, who {{does not want to}} let Dante enter, for he is a living being. Virgil forces Charon to take him by declaring, Vuolsi così colà dove si puote / ciò che si vuole ("It is so willed there where is power to do / That which is willed"), {{referring}} to the fact that Dante is on his journey on divine grounds. The wailing and blasphemy of the damned souls entering Charon's boat contrast with the joyful singing of the blessed souls arriving by ferry in the Purgatorio. The passage across the Acheron, however, is undescribed, since Dante faints and does not awaken until he <b>is</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> side.|$|E
25|$|A year later, Jake asks Joey if {{he fought}} with Salvy at the Copacabana because of Vickie. Jake then asks if Joey {{had an affair}} with her; Joey refuses to answer, insults Jake, and leaves. Jake {{directly}} asks Vickie about the affair, and when she hides from him in the bathroom, he breaks down the door, prompting her to sarcastically state that she had sex with the entire neighborhood (including his brother, Salvy, and Tommy Como). Jake angrily walks to Joey's house, with Vickie following him, and assaults Joey in front of his wife and children. After defending his championship belt in a grueling fifteen-round bout against Laurent Dauthuille in 1950, he makes a call to his brother after the fight, but when Joey assumes Salvy <b>is</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> end and starts insulting and cursing at him, Jake says nothing and hangs up. Estranged from Joey, Jake's career begins to decline slowly and he eventually loses his title to Sugar Ray Robinson in their final encounter in 1951.|$|E

25|$|As an example, {{consider}} {{determining whether}} a suitcase contains some radioactive material. Placed under a Geiger counter, it produces 10 counts per minute. The null hypothesis is that no radioactive material is in the suitcase and that all measured counts are due to ambient radioactivity typical of the surrounding air and harmless objects. We can then calculate how {{likely it is that}} we would observe 10 counts per minute if the null hypothesis were true. If the null hypothesis predicts (say) on average 9 counts per minute, then according to the Poisson distribution typical for radioactive decay there is about 41% chance of recording 10 or more counts. Thus we can say that the suitcase is compatible with the null hypothesis (this does not guarantee that there is no radioactive material, just that we don't have enough evidence to suggest there <b>is).</b> <b>On</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> hand, if the null hypothesis predicts 3 counts per minute (for which the Poisson distribution predicts only 0.1% chance of recording 10 or more counts) then the suitcase is not compatible with the null hypothesis, and there are likely other factors responsible to produce the measurements.|$|E
