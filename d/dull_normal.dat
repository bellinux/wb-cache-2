50|$|ARMS {{cells are}} often small with little cytoplasm. The nuclei {{of the cells}} are round with <b>normal,</b> <b>dull,</b> {{chromatin}} structures. The ARMS cells often clump together and have fibrovascular septae that interrupts the aggregates. The fibrovascular septae that disrupts the aggregates often give the tumor the physiology of the alveoli found in the lungs. In a few cases, {{there may not be}} any fibrovascular septae and this gives the tumor a more solid phenotype and no alveoli physiology. Immunostaining for myogenin and for MyoD can be used to determine ARMS from other rhabdomyosarcoma tumors and immunostaining for AP2β and p-cadherin can distinguish fusion positive ARMS from fusion negative.|$|R
2500|$|Various {{claims have}} been made as to what {{actually}} happened during the event. The three children who originally claimed to have seen Our Lady of Fátima reported seeing a panorama of visions during the event, including those of Jesus, Our Lady of Sorrows, Our Lady of Mount Carmel, and of Saint Joseph blessing the people. Father John De Marchi, an Italian Catholic priest and researcher wrote several books on the subject, which included descriptions by witnesses who believed they had seen a miracle created by Mary, Mother of God. According to accounts, {{after a period of}} rain, the dark clouds broke and the sun appeared as an opaque, spinning disc in the sky. It was said to be significantly <b>duller</b> than <b>normal,</b> and to cast multicolored lights across the landscape, the people, and the surrounding clouds.

50|$|Up until mid-1938, roundel sizes {{tended to}} vary widely, {{depending}} on the type of aircraft; the exception to the use of type A roundels for all aircraft was seen on the overall NIVO (dark green) painted night bombers (e.g., Handley Page Heyfords) which used type B roundels. Roundels used on aircraft painted in NIVO were <b>duller</b> than the <b>normal</b> colours. The size of the roundel was generally determined by the space available at the specified location, with a space of several inches around the edges. Some aircraft - primarily seaplanes, had a white outline around the fuselage roundel, even on silver doped finishes however this application was inconsistent so was probably not official. From 1929, the RAF switched to a new system of colour specifications, discarding the one used since the First World War, and as a result, the colour used for insignia changed, however the changeover period appears to have extended until at least 1932 for new production, and the old colours were not overpainted, but only gradually phased out as aircraft needed to be repainted.|$|R
40|$|A 39 {{year old}} patient with {{cerebellar}} signs, juvenile cataracts, and <b>dull</b> <b>normal</b> intelligence had cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis without tendon xanthomas, diagnosed previously as Marinesco-Sjoegren syndrome. Cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis was proved by a greatly increased excretion of bile alcohols in the patient's urine. Cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis is a sterol storage disorder {{due to an}} autosomal recessive inherited defect of sterol 27 -hydroxylase characterised by high cholestanol concentration in multiple tissues. If tendon xanthomas are not present, a diagnosis of cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis will often not be made, unless biochemical tests are performed. The clinical features of cerebrotendinous xanthomas strongly resembles Marinesco-Sjoegren syndrome. Marinesco-Sjoegren syndrome is a autosomal recessive disorder characterised by the triad cerebellar ataxia, congenital cataract, and mental retardation. Although a late onset after {{the first decade of}} life favours cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis as the underlying disease, a definite distinction between cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis without tendon xanthomas and Marinesco-Sjoegren syndrome based on clinical presentation may be difficult. It is considered that some patients with Marinesco-Sjoegren syndrome reported in the medical literature had cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis without tendon xanthomas. This is of crucial clinical relevance, because, by contrast with Marinesco-Sjoegren syndrome, treatment for cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis is already available...|$|E
40|$|Background: Neuropsychological deficits {{are common}} among epileptic {{children}} and these deficits of epileptic {{children may be}} influenced by factors like age, gender, frequency of seizures, duration of seizures, age at onset of seizures, type of seizures and family history. Material and Method: A non experimental research design was utilized to assess the Neuropsychological Deficits among Sample of 60 children with epilepsy, with age group of 8 - 16 years, attending outpatient neurology unit of Christian Medical College & Hospital, Ludhiana, Punjab. Symptom checklist- 90 was used to assess the psychological deficits and Performance of intelligence to assess neurological deficits was assessed with the help of Bhatia’s Battery. Analysis and interpretation of data was done by using descriptive and inferential statistics. Results: Out of 60 patients, 60 % of epileptic children were free of psychological deficits, 36. 7 % had mild and 3. 3 % had moderate level of psychological deficits. Children had maximum psychological deficits score (50. 08 %) in anger hostility related symptoms and least (12. 75 %) in phobic anxiety symptoms. 43 % of epileptic children had borderline and <b>dull</b> <b>normal</b> IQ level which indirectly represented neurological deficits...|$|E
40|$|An {{experiment}} {{was conducted to}} evaluate how subjective impressions of a light source’s colour quality depend upon {{the details of the}} shifts it causes in the colour appearance of illuminated objects. Twenty-eight participants each evaluated 26 lighting conditions in a 3. 1 [*]m by 3. 7 [*]m room filled with objects selected to cover a range of hue, saturation, and lightness. IES TM- 30 - 15 Fidelity Index (Rf) values ranged from 64 to 93, IES TM- 30 Gamut Index (Rg) values ranging from 79 to 117, and IES TM- 30 red chroma shift (Rcs,h 1) values ranging from − 19 % to 26 %. All lighting conditions had the same nominal illuminance and chromaticity. Participants were asked to rate each condition on eight point scales for saturated–dull, normal–shifted, and like–dislike, as well as classifying the condition as one of saturated, <b>dull,</b> <b>normal,</b> or shifted. The findings suggest that gamut shape is more important than average gamut area for modeling human preference, with red playing a more important role than other hues. Average fidelity alone is a weak predictor of human perception, especially CIE Ra. Nine of the top 12 rated products had a CIE Ra value of 73 or less, which indicates that the criteria of CIE Ra[*]≥[*] 80 may be excluding many preferred light sources.

40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{investigation}} was to determine the presence of abnormal sperm chromatin packaging in spermatozoa with large nuclear vacuoles (LNV) selected via high magnification by analysing the pattern of chromomycin A 3 (CMA 3) staining. A prospective observational study was designed to analyse semen samples obtained from 66 men undergoing infertility diagnosis and treatment. The numbers of cells with <b>normal</b> (<b>dull</b> yellow staining of the sperm head/CMA 3 -negative) and abnormal (bright yellow fluorescence of the sperm head/CMA 3 -positive) chromatin packaging were determined on slides with normal and LNV spermatozoa. The presence of bright yellow fluorescence (CMA 3 -positive) was significantly higher (p < 0. 0001) in spermatozoa with LNV than in normal spermatozoa (719 / 1351; 53. 2 % vs. 337 / 835; 40. 3 %, respectively), reflecting a higher percentage of abnormal chromatin packaging in spermatozoa with large LNV. Our data support the hypothesis that the presence of LNV reflects the presence of abnormal chromatin packaging, which may facilitate sperm DNA damage. As sperm nuclear vacuoles are evaluated more precisely at high magnifications using motile sperm organelle morphology examination (MSOME), the present results support the use of high-magnification sperm selection for intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) ...|$|R
5000|$|The story {{starts off}} with Cass {{awakening}} somewhere unknown to her, in an unknown time (she later finds {{she is in}} fact 500 years in the past), not knowing who she is, where she came from, or what she is doing. She sees a young boy stuck in a tree, and tries to rescue him, only to hear him repeatedly shouting the word [...] "Goat!", evidently frightened. He runs {{down the road to}} his father, but neither of them even look at the girl. Confused, the girl walks up to a puddle, only to see that she has no reflection, realizing that she must be invisible, and that the boy was shouting [...] "Ghost," [...] not [...] "Goat." [...] Meanwhile, Max-Ernest visits Cass in the PICU section of the hospital, where Cass lies in bed comatose. Max-Ernest, though evidently depressed over his friend comatose, (and the fact that the Tuning Fork won't help him create the antidote for Cass) with his only other friend Yo-Yoji away in Japan has overcome his [...] "fear/allergy" [...] of chocolate and eats several bars in a matter of seconds. Back to Cass, she realizes she has somehow traveled in time and arrived in the Renaissance/Middle Ages. She also realizes she's invisible, not dead. At the streets, she meets a Seer, who can see her because she has something called the [...] "Second Sight", obtained by an object called the Double Monocle (as this book centers around the sense of sight). She also does some fortune telling with a deck of tarot cards with Cass, showing her that the Ace of Wands card is upside down, meaning that an old wrong must be righted. The Seer gives a suggestion that maybe something has been stolen or she has stolen something. She then shows Cass the Fool card, with a picture of a fool, coincidentally the one that she saw while in the streets. When the Seer introduce her name as Clara or Cassandra, Cass' memories came back, making her remember about the Magician, the Jester, the Secret etc. She realizes she's on a mission to find the Secret, since she is the new Terces Society Secret Keeper. The Seer disappears but leaves Cass the Double Monocle. Meanwhile, Max-Ernest goes visit Pietro, who is playing Tarocchino with the circus crew. Pietro introduces the idea of tarot cards that has involvement in Cass' coma, which confuses Max-Ernest. Pietro explains that the Ace of Wands card is upside down, which refers {{to the fact that the}} Tuning Fork should be returned to their principal, Mrs. Johnson. He explains the Fork wants to be returned to its owner, so that is why it won't work. Lastly, Pietro tells Max-Ernest that he [...] "must bring her home from her head" [...] with mind reading. Back to Cass, she experiments with the Double Monocle, which she finds out that she could see through walls. When a parade comes to the streets announcing that the Duke is to give gifts of riches to the King, Cass, taking advantage of her invisibility climbs onto the parade, believing that it'll lead her to the palace, where she could find the Jester. The parade is raided by Anastasia and her bandits, who returns the jewels and riches to the poor. She also discovers a lodestone that attracts a lot of metal which she keeps. Back at school, when Max-Ernest is about to return the Tuning Fork to Mrs. Johnson, he meets the new secretary Opal, who pranks him into not knocking on Mrs. Johnson's door, resulting in her scolding him. The principal is dressed like a queen, because of the upcoming Ren-Faire, a Renaissance themed fair. Max-Ernest sees that Mrs. Johnson is wearing the lodestone as a necklace, who she explains that her great great aunt Clara was wearing it. At the palace, Cass sees a man telling a creature to sleep in the dog kennels. The creature is Mr. Cabbage Face. When she calls out his name, the homunculus looks at her, meaning that he could see Cass. Cass realizes if Mr. Cabbage Face is here, then Lord Pharaoh, the founder of the Midnight Sun (evil alchemists who go murderous lengths to seek immortality) is too. Cass also realizes that in the Tale of Mr. Cabbage Face, the author got the place where the homunculus stayed in the palace wrong. It wasn't a pigsty, but a dog kennel. Meanwhile, Benjamin Blake arrives from his old school, the New Promethean, completely changed. He is now wearing a tuxedo and owns the Double Monocle. He eats lunch with Max-Ernest, Daniel-not-Danielle and Glob in the Nuts Table. Benjamin reveals a note stuck on Max-Ernest's back, saying a strange message. At the kennels, Cass talks with the homunculus after giving him some leftover chicken as he was starving. When Cass gets the homunculus to speak a bit, the Jester arrives and carries own the conversation as notated in The Tale of Cabbage Face: A Gothic Tale. The Jester frees the homunculus before he is caught and sent to the dungeon, which is the place where the chamber pots are emptied. At Max-Ernest's house, Max-Ernest's parents announce that they are expecting a baby boy, overwhelming Max-Ernest. At the dungeon, Lord Pharaoh suddenly arrives and bumps into an invisible Cass, causing the Double Monocle to fall off. Pharaoh uses it and realizes the presence of Cass. Pharaoh confiscates all of Cass' belongings (just a triangle of Senor Hugo's chocolate which he take it to investigate on) and throws Cass into the cell with the Jester. Cass reveals to the Jester that she is invisible and is his great great.....granddaughter. He first disregards it as madness but slowly believes her. At school, Max-Ernest decodes the message and reveals a troubling [...] "LORD PHARAOH LIVES" [...] (probably because Pharaoh ate Cass' chocolate). At school, Amber invited Max-Ernest for a fortune telling session and when telling him that he is in love with Cass, Benjamin reads her mind and reveals to everyone that she lied, breaking her reputation. Benjamin reveals to Max-Ernest that he can mind read and agrees to read Cass' mind, like Pietro said. Max-Ernest would have to act an injury while Benjamin sneaks in. Meanwhile, Anastasia frees everyone in the dungeon and flees to her campsite. At the hospital, the janitor notices Cass whispering [...] "The Secret....what is the Secret..." [...] but decides not to report it immediately. Then, Max-Ernest charges into the Emergency Room screaming because he has an [...] "epileptic fit with the combined result of his allergyto vinyl and a cardiac arrest with the effects of white coat syndrome". But Max-Ernest's cover is blown, resulting in him to go back to Cass' room, just as Benjamin was about to see something. At home, Max-Ernest receives an EMail from Yo-Yoji telling him that the school Benjamin went to is run by the Midnight Sun, Dr. L being principal. Max-Ernest sees why Benjamin was so eager to find out what was in Cass' mind. At the campsite, the bandits are ambushed by the soldiers. At school, Max-Ernest eavesdrop Benjamin and Amber talking. Amber was begging Benjamin to let her try the monocle. Eventually she lunges and grabs Benjamin's monocle, and sees through walls and almost catches Max-Ernest. Max-Ernest discovers that Benjamin has no mind reading powers, it's just his monocle. Benjamin tries to get the monocle back but Max-Ernest runs with it. He trips and Opal catches the monocle and reports Benjamin and Amber to the principal and sends Max-Ernest to the nurse's office. Opal leaves her purse there, giving Max-Ernest the chance to get the monocle. At the campsite, the other soldiers and their dogs search for Cass. The homunculus saves her by letting the dogs chase him. He also leaves Cass the treasure chest. In the treasure chest, Cass finds the lodestone and the Jester and Cass save them by throwing the a sword onto the lodestone the Jester uses it to play a trick where Cass throws a sword, instantly attracted to the magnet and making the soldiers beg for forgiveness, as they thought something supernatural had occurred. At the hospital, Max-Ernest could not find Cass as she has left the hospital Because there is nothing the doctors could do. Max-Ernest uses the monocle to see himself in the mirror, revealing his future self eating massive amounts of chocolate and writing a book. It seems as if Pseudonymous Bosch is Max-Ernest because of his love of chocolate and being a writer. At the campsite, Anastasia discovers the truth - that the Jester has befriended an invisible girl. Cass draws herself on a scroll with some clay. Anastasia leaves and the Jester promises Cass that he will find the Secret from Lord Pharaoh and make clues for her to find. At Cass' house, everything is mess and disorganized as Melanie is depressed. Melanie, Larry and Wayne go out, leaving Max-Ernest to look over Cass, still comatose. Max-Ernest makes a very very long talk to Cass, and plays Yo-Yoji's guitar tunes from his pc. But it turns out Yo-Yoji was actually in Cass' bedroom and was playing the chords live. Suddenly, the power goes out, revealing to be Benjamin who cut the power lines. Benjamin breaks into Cass' house and demands the monocle. Just as a fight was about to start, someone throws Yo-Yoji's guitar on Benjamin, knocking him out. It is revealed to be Cass who threw the guitar. Cass had awoken because of Max-Ernest's speech, Yo-Yoji's heavy metal and the sudden jolt of electric when Benjamin cut the power. Max-Ernest ties him up just in time when Melanie, Larry and Wayne return. Meanwhile, Max-Ernest's brother is born, and is named Paul-Clay. At the Ren-Faire, Glob live-blogs his famous food blog, typing down all kinds of events. But at 11:35 AM, Glob writes in his blog that when he went down to the river bank where there is smoke because he thought there was a barbecue there, he witnesses the Midnight Sun chanting the word [...] "SECRET" [...] over and over again near a fire with a very bright ball. He then sees Ms. Mauvais drink from a goblet and giving it to an invisible Lord Pharaoh to drink. The Midnight Sun catches Glob spying and he flees, before hiding in a cave under a hamburger-shaped rock. Back in the fair, the trio and a cured and <b>normal</b> <b>dull</b> Benjamin are at a camera obscura, viewing the fair. When they leave, Cass goes into a tent and the Seer has a conversation with her. When she comes out and goes back in again, there is no Seer inside, but a robot who tells fortunes. The robot gives her cards with things that the Seer said, but the words turn into normal things after Cass reads it. At the joust, an armored man called Sir Unknown (Lord Pharaoh) battles Yo-Yoji. the armored man tells the Master of Arms that he represents Mary Queen of Scots (Ms. Mauvais). Just then, Opal tells everyone the joust will stop because a student had participated in the joust and Yo-Yoji had to leave. As Mrs. Johnson bestows Unknown as winner, he snatches the lodestone from her neck, since he knows the Secret is on it. The rest of the Midnight Sun (disguised as guards) flee as Mrs. Johnson demands that the lodestone is returned to her or else the trio will be expelled. At the camera obscure, Opal reveals himself to be Owen, the accent changing spy of the Terces Society which explains why he told off Amber and Benjamin, not Max-Ernest and why he left the purse for Max-Ernest to rummage into. Then, at the Camera Obscura, Cass uses the monocle and sees that the Jester is there, since if she doesn't wear the monocle she couldn't see him. Suddenly, Danielle-not-Daniel calls Max-Ernest and tells him about Glob's emergency blog post. The trio rush to the riverbank mentioned in the blog post and while Max-Ernest and Yo-Yoji rescue Glob, whom eats a lot of Cass' special trail mix, Cass rushes to the mentioned fireplace, where she meets Sir Unknown, whom reveals himself to be Lord Pharaoh, invisible. Pharaoh demands Cass to tell him how the lodestone works, but Cass distracts him by throwing the monocle and running away with the lodestone. Max-Ernest then hears Cass' calls of help and Yo-Yoji comes out, uses a branch from a tree to trip Pharaoh over and hang him upside down. At Medieval Days Restaurant that night, Cass, Max-Ernest, Yo-Yoji, Paul-Clay and Benjamin have dinner. The trio try to solve the message said to be written on it by the Jester but fails. Later, at the fire station, Max-Ernest comes with Paul-Clay's toy which has magnetic powder on it. The lodestone attracts all of the powder and is covered by powder except a lining of silver that spells [...] "AS ABOVE SO BELOW". Cass is disappointed with the result until the postman comes and gives a trunk to Cass. He explains that the trunk has been to all 7 continents in the world and the recipient is her. When the postman leaves, Cass finds out that the password combination to unlock the trunk is [...] "AS SO" [...] and unlocks it, revealing treasure from the chest Anastasia stole earlier. When she goes home, Melanie finds a scroll with a drawing of Cass on it, which was the one she drew 500 years ago, and she tells her there is a scrap of papyrus stuck on it. Cass snatches the papyrus, knowing the Secret is on it an rushes into her room to read it, but the papyrus is rapidly turning into dust. The story ends here to be continued in the next book.|$|R

The tests used included the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale, The Wide Range Achievement Test, a measure of reading comprehension and components of The Halstead-Reitan Neuropsychological Test Battery. The sample was characterized as being of <b>dull</b> <b>normal</b> intelligence with lower verbal than performance IQs. Scores on achievement tests were substantially below grade level. The average neuropsychological test profile formed a pattern characterized by intact nonverbal memory and problem solving ability, with mildly impaired levels of attentional, motor and speech discrimination skills.

40|$|ALTHOUGH {{reports of}} cases of Leber's disease (hereditary optic atrophy) have been {{published}} by British, French, and German authors, very few such reports {{are to be found}} in the American literature. The unusual findings of neurotic manifestations of a compulsive nature in a female patient with this disease appears to justify their presentation. Julia Bell (1931) has made an extensive study of the literature on the subject of Leber's disease and quotes the works of Beer (1817), Von Graefe (1858), and Leber (1871). Leber's disease usually begins at puberty or in early youth and is characterized by a rapid loss of vision, contraction of the visual fields, central scotomata and primary optic atrophy. Slight improvement may follow the primary loss of vision. Case Report E. B., a 32 -year-old married Jewish housewife, was admitted to the Bellevue Psy-chiatric Hospital on 5 th January, 1936.
