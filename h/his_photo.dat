5|$|Many of Tom Swift's fictional inventions {{describe}} actual {{technological developments}} or predate technologies now considered commonplace. Tom Swift Among the Diamond Makers (1911) {{was based on}} Charles Parsons's attempts to synthesize diamonds using electric current. Tom Swift and <b>His</b> <b>Photo</b> Telephone was published in 1912. Sending photographs by telephone was not fully developed until 1925. Tom Swift and His Wizard Camera (1912) features a portable movie camera, not invented until 1923.

5|$|He {{returns to}} the {{observation}} room and finds the letter he'd written to Amanda, in which he'd used his knowledge of her role in Jill's miscarriage to blackmail her into killing Lynn Denlon. The letter was found by Pamela and given to Jill, who uses it to ambush Hoffman as William reaches {{the end of his}} path with one second left, finding himself between the cages. It is revealed that Pamela is his sister, while Tara and Brent are Harold's family. Tara is informed by a videotape of Kramer that she can either kill William or free him using the switch; when she is unable to make a decision, Brent angrily shifts the switch and a bed of needles swings down and injects William's body with the acid, killing him. Jill restrains Hoffman and locks a new reverse bear trap to his head. She shows him the sixth envelope, which contains <b>his</b> <b>photo,</b> and leaves him with 45 seconds but no key. Hoffman escapes by breaking his hand and jamming the trap as it activates, and he pulls his head free, ripping open his cheek.|$|E
5|$|In the bathroom, Lawrence finds a box {{containing}} a lighter, two cigarettes, and a one-way cellphone. He then recalls his abduction: {{he was trying}} to use his phone after being trapped in a parking garage, and was suddenly attacked by a pig-masked figure. They try to use a cigarette dipped in the corpse's blood, which is in fact cyanide, to stage Adam's death, but the plan fails when Adam is zapped through his ankle chain. Adam then recalls his own abduction: he was in <b>his</b> <b>photo</b> development room when the power went out and, after finding a puppet, was attacked by a similar pig-masked figure. At gunpoint, Alison calls Lawrence and tells him not to trust Adam, who admits that he was being paid to take photos of Lawrence, many of which were in the hacksaw bag. Adam also reveals his knowledge of Lawrence's affair with one of his medical students; Lawrence had been with her before he was abducted. Lawrence realizes from Adam's description that Tapp was paying him. Adam finds a photo that he didn't take, of a man staring out a window of Lawrence's house, whom Lawrence identifies as Zep. Unfortunately, the clock then strikes six as he realizes this.|$|E

25|$|Hirst himself {{bursts in}} and is {{delighted to see}} Spooner, whom he oddly {{mistakes}} for (or pretends is) an old friend. He speaks as though the two were Oxbridge classmates in the 1930s, which Spooner finally plays along with. Hirst and Spooner then bizarrely discuss scandalous romantic encounters they both had with the same women, leading {{to a series of}} increasingly questionable reminiscences, until finally Hirst is accused of having had an affair with Spooner's own wife. All the while, Hirst refers to Briggs by a variety of inconsistent names and then launches into a rant about once-known faces in <b>his</b> <b>photo</b> album.|$|E

The first cover pressing had a burgundy-colored, curved-corner cardboard cutout sleeve, framing a clear embossed cellophane insert, glued in from behind. Photography was credited to Wendell Hamick. According to Jac Holzman, {{chief executive officer of}} Elektra Records: [...] "I wasn't sure there would be another album ever, so I had Bill Harvey create a collector's cover. The Doors' faces were printed on clear film. The backing color of the inner sleeve could be changed and would affect the mood of the package.

500|$|The {{front cover}} for Marquee Moon {{was shot by}} {{photographer}} Robert Mapplethorpe, who had previously shot the cover for Patti Smith's 1975 album Horses. <b>His</b> <b>photo</b> situated Verlaine a step {{in front of the}} rest of the band, who were captured in a tensed, serious pose. Verlaine held his right hand across his body and extended his slightly clenched left hand forward. When Mapplethorpe gave Television the contact prints, Lloyd took the band's favorite shot to a print shop in Times Square and asked for color photocopies for the group members to mull over. Although the first few copies were oddly colored, Lloyd asked the copy worker to print more [...] "while turning the knobs with his eyes closed". He likened the process to Andy Warhol's screen prints. After he showed it to the group, they chose the altered copy over Mapplethorpe's original photo, which Fred Smith had framed and kept for himself.|$|E
