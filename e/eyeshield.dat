40|$|We {{report a}} case of corneal {{deposition}} of pigments from cosmetic contact lenses after intense pulsed-light (IPL) therapy. A 30 -year-old female visited our outpatient clinic with ocular pain and epiphora in both eyes; these symptoms developed soon after she had undergone facial IPL treatment. She was wearing cosmetic contact lenses throughout the IPL procedure. At presentation, her uncorrected visual acuity was 2 / 20 in both eyes, and the slit-lamp examination revealed deposition of the color pigment of the cosmetic contact lens onto the corneal epithelium. We scraped the corneal epithelium along with the deposited pigments using a no. 15 blade; seven days after the procedure, the corneal epithelium had healed without any complications. This case {{highlights the importance of}} considering the possibility of ocular complications during IPL treatment, particularly in individuals using contact lenses. To prevent ocular damage, IPL procedures should be performed only after removing the lenses and applying <b>eyeshields...</b>|$|R
40|$|PURPOSE: To {{examine the}} {{relationship}} between occupational exposures and knowledge of universal precautions among medical students. METHOD: Graduating medical students were given a survey regarding occupational exposures suffered during their clinical rotations. The survey also tested students' knowledge of universal precautions by asking them to indicate what combination of gloves, mask, and <b>eyeshields</b> should be worn to satisfy universal precautions for ten common procedures. RESULTS: At a seminar one week before graduation, 45 senior medical students were given the questionnaire. The response rate was 100 % 84 % of the surveyed students suffered at least one occupational exposure during their clinical training. Of those who had an exposure, 42 % reported at least once to an exposure center. The mean percentage of correct answers on the protective equipment questionnaire was 71 %. No correlation between number of exposures and score on the protective equipment questionnaire was found (r = 0. 0). CONCLUSION: Occupational exposures to blood are common among medical students. Few students report to exposure centers. Knowledge of universal precautions may not correlate with reduced risk of occupational exposures among medical students...|$|R

40|$|This volume, {{the second}} {{in a series of}} three devoted to the Chemical Warfare Service (CWS) in World War II, now the Chemical Corps, covers research, development, procurement, and {{distribution}} of chemical warfare materiel. It traces the history of these activities from the World War I period, when the CWS was activated to supervise the offensive and defensive aspects of gas warfare throughout the Army, until the end of World War II. The first volume in the series, "Organizing for War", discusses the development of the CWS organization and mission as well as personnel management and military training. The third volume, entitled "Chemicals in Combat", will deal with the chemical warfare activities in the theaters of operations. In treating research and development, the present volume concentrates on CWS projects that proved of greatest significance to the armed forces during World War II. It attempts to point up the problems that arose in course of research and development and to indicate the solutions which the scientists hit upon.

The on-field action was also praised, with he saying the sports action is [...] "where <b>Eyeshield</b> 21 truly shines", although he criticized the scenes away from the football field, [...] "the pacing slows to a crawl and the storyline gets a little boring". In her review, Erin Finnegan from Anime News Network stated, [...] "he pace of <b>Eyeshield</b> 21 is its saving grace. It's way less boring than all the time outs and commercial breaks in a regular NFL game. Football is hard to understand, but <b>Eyeshield</b> 21 explains the Byzantine rules...in an entertaining way. We're never left waiting for the ref's decision for long minutes like in real life. A lot of dramatic tension carries the action between plays." [...] Finnegan also criticized the artwork, saying, [...] "any episode [...] without a game is clearly farmed out to an inferior animation studio".
