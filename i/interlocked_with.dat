25|$|Throughout the Cenozoic Era, {{the large}} North American and South American {{continental}} plates moved westward from the Eurasian plate. This drift <b>interlocked</b> <b>with</b> {{the development of}} the Atlantic Ocean, trending north-south, with the North Pole in the small, nearly landlocked basin of the Arctic Ocean. The Isthmus of Panama developed at a convergent plate margin about 3 million years ago, and further separated oceanic circulation, closing the last strait, outside of the polar regions, that had connected the Pacific and Atlantic oceans.|$|E

Standard gauge trains are protected by signals and wide-to-gauge trap points on the WHR line, which are <b>interlocked</b> <b>with</b> the standard gauge European Rail Traffic Management System (ERTMS) signalling. The crossing is activated locally and ERTMS automatically gives permission for WHR trains to cross provided the standard gauge section is available.

25|$|The {{railways}} mostly use {{colour signal}} lights. Earlier the older semaphores and discs-based signalling (depending on the position or colour) were used, {{but these were}} replaced by colour signals. Except for some high-traffic sections around large cities and junctions, the network does not use automatic block systems. However, the signals at stations are almost invariably <b>interlocked</b> <b>with</b> the setting of points (routes) and so safety {{does not depend on}} the skill of the station masters. With the planned introduction of Cab signalling/Anti collision devices the element of risk on account of drivers overshooting signals will also be eliminated.|$|E
25|$|Since {{becoming}} operational in September 2010, {{work has}} continued on the signalling, the signal box became operational during summer 2015 allowing the temporary ground frame and shed to be removed. A Trap point will be fitted {{to the exit}} of the siding south of Thuxton station, as well as additional signals including signals allowing bi-directional movements in the down platform and a ground frame at Garvestone crossing with associated gate locks and distant signals <b>interlocked</b> <b>with</b> Thuxton signal box. The completed scheme will allow the train from Wymondham to arrive before the train from Dereham when two trains are operating, this isn't currently possible. Locomotives will {{also be able to}} run round their trains in the station.|$|E
25|$|A scrum {{is formed}} by the eight {{forwards}} from each team binding together in three rows. The front row consists of the two props (loosehead and tighthead) {{either side of the}} hooker. The second row consists of two locks and the two flankers. Behind the second row is the number 8. This formation is known as the 3–4–1 formation. The two packs of forwards engage with each other so that the heads of the front-rowers are <b>interlocked</b> <b>with</b> those of their opponents. Front-rowers always aim for the gap to the left (as they see it) of their opponent. The two locks in the second row bind directly behind the front row with their heads between a prop and the hooker. The flankers bind either side of the locks, and the number 8 binds behind and between the two locks.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. An open problem {{posed in}} [3] {{asked for the}} minimal k such that a {{flexible}} open k-chain can <b>interlock</b> <b>with</b> a flexible 2 -chain. It was conjectured in [3] that the minimal k satisfies 6 ≤ k ≤ 11. In a previous preprint [5], we establish that k exists, and in particular, that k ≤ 16. Here we improve this result to k ≤ 11 by proving that a flexible 2 -chain can <b>interlock</b> <b>with</b> a flexible, open 11 -chain. We offer some reasons to believe that k = 11 is minimal. 1...|$|R

2500|$|A {{number of}} {{additional}} accessories {{have also been}} released for use {{in conjunction with the}} PlayStation Move controllers.

The motion controller is fitted into the gun barrel so that the motion controller's T trigger is <b>interlocked</b> <b>with</b> the trigger on the gun attachment, while leaving all the topmost buttons accessible {{through a hole in the}} top, similar to the Wii Zapper. Additionally, the [...] "PlayStation Move Sharp Shooter attachment" [...] is an accessory for the PlayStation Move motion controller that adapts both the motion controller and navigation controller into a submachine gun form, which features an adjustable shoulder support. The motion controller is fitted into the gun barrel so that the motion controller's T trigger is <b>interlocked</b> <b>with</b> the trigger, and the navigation controller is clipped into a holder below this gun barrel. However, the accessory adds several extra buttons and controls (via the EXT connector on the base of the Move Motion Controller). These extra buttons include [...] and [...] buttons (on both sides, located near the T and M buttons), RL button (located under the gun's magazine) and pump-action mechanism (located under the barrel) which both can be used to reload (or alternately may serve another function depending on future game design), 3-setting Firing Rate control, M-button lock, and secondary M button (located below the Trigger) for easy access. The peripheral is officially supported by Killzone 3, , [...] and Resistance 3. The [...] "PlayStation Move Racing Wheel" [...] utilises the motion tracking capabilities of the Move controller to steer vehicles in video games and also features vibration feedback, paddle-style gear shifters and twist throttle controls.

For this competition, HouseGuests were shown {{pictures}} on the Memory Wall from previous competitions throughout the season. They were then asked questions about details from the images, and the HouseGuest with the most correct answers was the winner. Zach was the winner. On Day 70, Zach chose to nominate Daniele and Dick for eviction, with the hopes of evicting one of them. On Day 71, HouseGuests {{competed in the}} [...] "Big Brother Decoder" [...] final Power of Veto competition. For this competition, HouseGuests had to match a clue to a HouseGuest's face that <b>interlocked</b> <b>with</b> another HouseGuest's face. Once that is done, the HouseGuests must twist the knob and match the HouseGuest with the corresponding number. The first HouseGuest to correctly label the many seconds they've been in the house would win the Power of Veto. Daniele was the winner, making it her fifth Power of Veto win. This tied her with former HouseGuest Janelle Pierzina for the most Power of Veto wins in a single season; the two still hold the record. On Day 74, Daniele chose to use the Power of Veto to remove her father from the block, with Jameka being the only HouseGuest eligible to be nominated in his place. Minutes later, Dick cast the sole vote to evict Jameka from the house. She became the sixth member of the Jury of Seven.|$|E
