50|$|There was a {{wide range}} of {{cylinders}} produced with three different wall thicknesses. Most are interchangeable between all engine types which can create problems when buying a used engine. All early cylinders had a thin wall which was later found to need improvement because they bent easily in a crash or when trying to undo with a Cox wrench. Some people refer to these as Mk1 cylinders. The next type was thickened at the exhaust ports and are also known by some people as Mk2. The third type was thick wall the way down from the cooling fins to the bottom. This one facilitated the <b>exhaust</b> <b>throttle</b> ring and some people refer to this as a Mk3 although Cox never referred to them like this.|$|E
5000|$|Also {{known as}} the [...] "Poor man's Tee Dee" [...] these were similar to the Tee Dee in {{appearance}} but had cheaper parts on them, making them cheaper to buy. The cylinder was a non tapered twin bypass with no boost ports (like the one used on the Black Widow), the crank shaft was drilled out rather than milled like the Tee Dee, and the carb body was a one piece unit with a conventional needle valve and spray bar. These engines were marketed as a Sport / Stunt engine as they were much tamer and much less cantankerous than the Tee Dee. These are a great reliable easy to use little engine even today. They can be purchased for under $20US in 2008. R/C versions of this engine were also produced with <b>exhaust</b> <b>throttle.</b> i.e. 1968 Cat#240-1 and the 1988 Cat#2501 with muffler/throttle.|$|E

Fuel consuming strategies, including late injections and turbine-based engine <b>exhaust</b> <b>throttling,</b> are typically used to increase turbine-outlet temperature and flow rate {{in order to reach}} the aftertreatment component temperatures required for efficient reduction of NOx and soot. The same strategies are used at low load operating conditions to maintain aftertreatment temperatures. This paper demonstrates that cylinder deactivation (CDA) can be used to maintain aftertreatment temperatures in a more fuel-efficient manner through reductions in airflow and pumping work. The incorporation of CDA to maintain desired aftertreatment temperatures during idle conditions is experimentally demonstrated to result in fuel savings of 3. 0 % over the HD-FTP drive cycle. Implementation of CDA at non-idle portions of the HD-FTP where BMEP is below 3 [*]bar is demonstrated to reduce fuel consumption further by an additional 0. 4 %, thereby resulting in 3. 4 % fuel savings over the drive cycle...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{covers the}} work done {{in an attempt to}} reduce exhaust noise level without the decay of brake mean {{effective}} pressure of a two-cylinder two-stroke cycle engine, by means of an exhaust manifold having a throttle plate in its junction. The data are shown for various dimensions and configurations of the manifold and the discussion is given on the effect of <b>exhaust</b> <b>throttling</b> on <b>exhaust</b> noise level and engine performance. The principal results obtained by this study are as follows: (1) The lower limit of the throttle area was about onethird of a cross-sectional area of the manifold from the view point of brake mean effective pressure. (2) Within this limit brake mean effective pressure was scarcely influenced by throttling under the condition where a number of pressure oscillation related to the pulsation effect during an interval between discharges was less than 1. 7. (3) A reduction in exhaust noise level attained was 8 dB(A) at higher engine speeds. (4) The junction angle of the manifold gave little significance to exhaust noise level and brake mean effective pressure...|$|R

In the work reported in this paper the auto–ignition (AI) load region specific to a small two–stroke engine has been investigated. Our objective was to gain a better understanding regarding the characteristics of AI operating regime by studying combustion stability and exhaust emissions. AI combustion was achieved by trapping hot exhaust gases inside the cylinder with an <b>exhaust</b> <b>throttle</b> valve. The intake throttle, <b>exhaust</b> <b>throttle</b> and fuelling rate were manually adjusted to obtain the required engine operating points. The nature of combustion and implications of exhaust emissions have been discussed in relation to the load regions of AI operation. The operation of AI in the medium to high load ranges demonstrated a higher degree of cyclic stability. In contrast to this, AI operation at lower loads demonstrated a higher degree of cyclic instability...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{focuses on}} modelling-based design, {{operation}} {{and control of}} solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) and gas turbine (GT) hybrid systems. Fuel cells are a promising approach to high-efficiency power generation, as they directly convert chemical energy to electric work. High-temperature fuel cells such as the SOFC can be integrated in gas turbine processes, which further increases the electrical efficiency to values up to 70 %. However, {{there are a number}} of obstacles for safe operation of such a system, such as fuel cell damage through thermal loads or undesired chemical reactions, or gas turbine problems related to high thermal capacity and volume of the pressurised components. Development of suitable plant design as well as operation and control strategies is hence a key task for realisation of the mentioned systems. The first part of the thesis describes the utilised models. All component models that have been developed and applied for the work are mathematically defined based on a fixed pattern. The thermodynamically most relevant components are tubular SOFC, indirect internal reformer and heat exchangers, and spatially discretised models are used for these. For the turbomachinery, map-based steady-state behaviour is modelled. Gas residence times and pressure drops are accounted for in all components they are relevant. Based on the component models, three different hybrid cycles are examined. In the first cycle, the SOFC replaces the combustion chamber of a recuperated single-shaft turbine. The SOFC is pressurised and the cycle is called “directly integrated SOFC cycle” (DIC). Further cycle options are a DIC with a two-shaft gas turbine (DIC- 2 T) and an indirectly integrated SOFC cycle (IIC). In the latter, the compressed gas is heated recuperatively with the exhaust gas and the SOFC is operated at ambient pressure by connecting its air inlet to the turbine exhaust. All cycles incorporate the SOFC system design proposed by Siemens-Westinghouse, including indirect internal reforming, a tubular SOFC bundle and anode recirculation by an ejector. The first cycle (DIC) is regarded as standard cycle. Objectives for highly efficient, safe system design are formulated and design parameters are associated. A design calculation determines the design parameters for the standard cycle, based on a nominal power output of 220 kW. The design LHVbased electric efficiency is app. 63 %. Related to the design point, steady-state part-load ability of the system is analysed and displayed in two-dimensional performance maps where each axis represents one degree of freedom. Degrees of freedom considered are fuel and air flow; fuel utilisation is assumed constant. A result is that a strategy with constant mean fuel cell temperature is most advantageous in terms of safe and gentle operation. Further advantages of this strategy are the ability for low part-load and high efficiency at part-load operation. A control strategy is derived for dynamical implementation of the found part-load strategy. The system power output is primarily controlled by the SOFC power. The fuel utilisation is kept within certain bounds and the fuel flow is manipulated to control it to its design value. The fuel cell temperature is controlled by the air flow, which again is controlled by manipulating the GT shaft speed through the generator power. To determine the required air flow, a mixed feedforward and feedback strategy is used, where the feedforward part calculates a prediction based on the net power output and the feedback part provides correction based on the measurement of the SOFC fuel outlet temperature. Additional constraints to the control system are the supervision of the shaft speed and the valid operation regime of the anode recirculation ejector. The proposed control strategy provides robust control. The mean SOFC temperature, however, shows large transient deviation upon large load steps. The time to reach the setpoint power for large load steps is up to 70 s, while small load steps are followed in typically 1 - 2 s. A conclusion is that the system is suitable for load following operation as long as small load steps occur, as for example in distributed power generation for residential applications. Shutdown and startup strategies are introduced where the gas turbine provides air for cooling/heating throughout the procedures. Additional equipment and piping such as an auxiliary burner, a turbine <b>exhaust</b> <b>throttle,</b> a bypass around the recuperative heat exchanger as well as nitrogen and hydrogen supply and mixing units are required. Therewith, smooth cooling/heating of the cell can be accomplished without external electric power, but with a considerable amount of fuel and flushing nitrogen required. A further analysis investigates fuel flexibility of a system designed for methane: Hydrogen can be utilised without larger system modifications; only the control system characteristics must be adapted. Because no endothermic steam reforming takes place, the power output is, however, reduced to 70 % of the original value, and efficiency is reduced to 55 %. Applying the additional equipment required for shutdown/startup, the power can be increased to 94 % of the original value, although at a further efficiency decrease. In order to use ethanol as fuel in the ejector-driven anode, a recuperative vaporiser must be applied in the fuel channel. Supposed that reliable reforming catalysts for ethanol can be provided, 88 % of the original power output can be achieved at a high efficiency of 62 %. The investigation of the other cycle options reveals that a two turbine cycle where the power turbine is rotating at constant speed, mostly differs in terms of controllability. For controlling the air flow, another handle such as variable inlet guide vanes or air bypass around the SOFC system is required. The indirectly integrated SOFC cycle (IIC) has a significantly lower efficiency of only 56 %, assuming the SOFC at the same temperature level than in the DIC.

40|$|Radical {{combustion}} is {{a critical}} condition behind control. In two stroke engine, a condition of radical combustion could be achieved through control of the trapped exhaust gases at a certain condition, might include, the engine load, speed, concentration of the unburned hydrocarbons, their temperature and other operational parameters. An earlier work was conducted towards {{the achievement of the}} radical combustion. The mechanism was made to throttle the opening of the exhaust port at a range of 1 % to 8 % [1]. However, several difficulties were faced, mainly with the control mechanism of throttling. In addition there is a complexity in identifying the critical conditions at which the radical combustion could be achieved. In this paper, a new strategy was used to control the <b>exhaust</b> port <b>throttling</b> in a way to manage the amount of exhaust gases trapped and avoiding the drawbacks of the throttling mechanism in the earlier work. Three trial plates were used, one-sixth closed, one-third closed and half closed to <b>throttle</b> the <b>exhaust</b> gases leaving the combustion chamber. Results reveal the possibility of achieving radical combustion, when using the one-sixth closed plate under relatively higher load. Therefore, partial trapping of the exhaust gases should be carried, through the restriction of the opening of the exhaust port not to exceed 15 % of the port exit area. However, it is more interesting, that <b>throttling</b> of the <b>exhaust</b> gases of the two stroke engine have clear influence on the quality and stability of the combustion and hence its direct effect on the fuel consumption and the rate of pollutants expelled to the environment...|$|R

The series debuted in 2002 with the Oldsmobile Bravada, and is also used in the Buick Rainier, the Chevrolet TrailBlazer and Colorado, the GMC Envoy and Canyon, the Hummer H3, Isuzu Ascender and i-370, and the Saab 9-7X.

40|$|International audienceIncreasing {{the degrees}} of freedom in the air path has become a popular {{way to reduce the}} fuel {{consumption}} and pollutant emissions of modern combustion engines. That is why technical definitions will usually contain components such as multi or single-stage turbocharger, <b>throttle,</b> <b>exhaust</b> gas recirculation loops, wastegate, variable valve timing or phasing, etc. One of the biggest challenges is to precisely quantify the gas flows through the engine. They include fresh and burnt gases, with trapping and scavenging phenomena. An accurate prediction of these values leads to an efficient control of the engine air fuel ratio and torque. Fuel consumption and pollutant emissions are then minimized. In this paper, we propose to use an artificial neural networkbased model as a prediction tool for the engine volumetric efficiency. Results are presented for a downsized turbocharged spark-ignited engine, equipped with inlet and outlet variable valve timing. The calibration process that is used in this study only requires steady-state operating points. The validation stage was conducted on both steady-state and vehicle transients. Model prediction is in very good agreement with experimental results while keeping a very low calibration effort and matching embedded computational requirements. The conclusion stresses that thanks to their generic structure, neural models offer an interesting potential for generalization to even more complex technical definitions...|$|R
40|$|On-site and near-site {{distributed}} {{power generation}} (DG), {{as part of}} a Buildings Cooling, Heating and Power (BCHP) system, brings both electricity and waste heat from the DG sources closer to the end user's electric and thermal loads. Consequently, the waste heat can be used as input power for heat-activated air conditioners, chillers, and desiccant dehumidification systems; to generate steam for space heating; or to provide hot water for laundry, kitchen, cleaning services and/or rest rooms. By making use of what is normally waste heat, BCHP systems meet a building's electrical and thermal loads with a lower input of fossil fuel, yielding resource efficiencies of 40 to 70 % or more. To ensure the success of BCHP systems, interactions of a DG system-such as a microturbine and thermal heat recovery units under steady-state modes of operation with various exhaust back pressures-must be considered. This article studies the performance and emissions of a 30 -kW microturbine over a range of design and off-design conditions in steady-state operating mode with various back pressures. In parallel with the experimental part of the project, a BCHP mathematical model was developed describing basic thermodynamic and hydraulic processes in the system, heat and material balances, and the relationship of the balances. to the system configuration. The model can determine the efficiency of energy conversion both for an individual microturbine unit and for the entire BCHP system for various system configurations and external loads. Based on actual data Tom a 30 -kW microturbine, linear analysis was used to obtain an analytical relationship between the changes in the thermodynamic and hydraulic parameters of the system. The actual data show that, when the backpressure at the microturbine exhaust outlet is increased to the maximum of 7 in. WC (0. 017 atm), the microturbine's useful power output decreases by from 3. 5 % at a full power setting of 30 kW to 5. 5 % at a one-third power setting (10 k w), while the efficiency of the unit decreases from 2. 5 to 4. 0 %, accordingly. Tests on the microturbine were conducted at the Cooling, Heating, and Power Laboratory set up at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory's Buildings Technology Center. Data were collected from the microturbine at power demand settings of 30 kW (full load) to 10 kW in 5 -kW increments. For each power demand setting, data measurements were taken over an entire range of microturbine exhaust back pressures. The parameters measured were engine speed, ambient air temperature, air temperature at the microturbine inlet, gas temperature at the turbine outlet, <b>exhaust</b> gas temperature, <b>throttle</b> pressure loss, flow rate of natural gas, and composition of combustion products. The mathematical model provided gas temperature before the turbine, compression rate, and air flow rate, which were determined based on the measured data The results of these early tests and the computer-based simulation model are in very close agreement...|$|R
