This means {{that you do not}} longer have a set workstation of your own, you move around according to where to your current work will be best performed.     Problem                           We want to explore how the communication within a company’s departments has been affected by the introduction of an activity-based office design. Purpose                             The {{purpose of this study was}} to get an understanding of how this office design could effect the communication within companies that uses it. Further more, we wanted to study the effects that this kind of office would have on the communication within a department.   Method                              This bachelor thesis are written by inspiration from an inductive approach and based on a multiple qualitative case study of two companies that currently are using an activity <b>based</b> <b>office</b> design.

The communication generally increased as a result of more interaction between employees from different departments.

40|$|Object-oriented <b>data</b> <b>bases</b> {{are fast}} gaining in popularity, {{especially}} {{with the advent of}} advanced applications like computer aided design (CAD) and multimedia <b>data</b> <b>bases</b> (MMDB). The modeling techniques required by these applications cannot be met by conventional <b>data</b> <b>base</b> systems. The semantic richness of the object-oriented model facilitates the modeling of advanced <b>data</b> <b>base</b> applications. These applications are characterized by long-duration cooperating transactions. Unlike the conventional <b>data</b> <b>bases,</b> serializability can no linger be the correctness criterion for concurrent transaction execution. A new transaction model for object-oriented <b>data</b> <b>bases</b> is needed.

Simultaneously, we assemble a set of domestic <b>data</b> <b>bases</b> building on the primary input-output data described in chapter 16. These domestic <b>data</b> <b>bases</b> must be supplemented by constructing a set of composite region <b>data</b> <b>bases</b> for those regions not covered by the primary domestic data. This is done by combining macroeconomic information from the international <b>data</b> <b>base</b> and original source data for those countries reported in chapter 16.

40|$|The {{focus of}} the present {{research}} is on children's understanding and use of <b>data</b> <b>bases.</b> Previous {{research in this area}} is limited and has been mainly machine-centered. Some studies have been done to analyse the effectiveness of <b>data</b> <b>bases</b> compared to more traditional methods (paper and pencil) in information handling activities; and some others have focused on the comparison among several <b>data</b> <b>base</b> systems in order to see to what extent the system characteristics (<b>data</b> <b>base</b> structures - command/menu driven systems) influence the process of information retrieval. However very little {{attention has been paid to}} the process of teaching and learning <b>data</b> <b>bases,</b> to the nature and structure of <b>data</b> <b>base</b> tasks, and the factors that affect students' performance on such <b>data</b> <b>base</b> tasks. This latter perspective, task-centered, is the one taken by the present research. The present research investigates the possible existence of a theoretically proposed five-level hierarchy of <b>data</b> <b>base</b> tasks. 13 and 16 year old students' performance on two different types of <b>data</b> <b>base</b> tasks using GRASS is examined. The research also involves questions about the skills and knowledge that students possess and which affect the quality of <b>data</b> <b>base</b> interrogation activity, such as understanding of the nature of <b>data</b> <b>bases,</b> understanding of the nature of <b>data</b> <b>base</b> search and structure. and understanding of Boolean logic in the phrasing of complex queries. Children were tested on a range of such tasks before and after being trained in the use of GRASS. The results show that children at 13 and 16 can perform simple <b>data</b> <b>base</b> operations and tasks rather successfully. There is some hierarchy in the difficulty of tasks, but not precisely that proposed theoretically. Tasks involving two variables, and relations between them, are relatively difficult, particularly for the younger group. Tasks requiring simple retrieval and sorting data are the easiest. Logical operations present difficulties, especially in the construction of logical sentences, with simple AND combinations being the easiest. OR is sometimes treated as AND, particularly when interpreting negative OR propositions. Contradictions and tautologies are very difficult both to interpret and construct. Children seem to have an adequate if simple model of a <b>data</b> <b>base</b> in terms of the types of information a <b>data</b> <b>base</b> can and can not contain. However, their models of the ways information is kept, organised and found in a <b>data</b> <b>base</b> are not so adequate...|$|R
