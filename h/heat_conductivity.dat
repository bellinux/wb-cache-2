40|$|Nanofluids are fluids {{within which}} {{particles}} of nanometre sizes are suspended. In terms of thermal characteristics, nanofluids {{have a greater}} heat transfer coefficient and thermal conductivity than other traditional fluids. Bimetallic core/shell Cu/Zn particles of nanometre sizes are novel invented nanoparticle materials with considerable variations in its applications. The particles of nanometre size were suspended in a base fluid for the preparation of nanofluids for different volume fractions. A coated transitory hot wire device were built and standardized and this was subsequently employed for the determination of <b>heat</b> <b>conductivities</b> of the nanofluids for bimetallic ratios, volume fraction, base fluid temperatures and base fluids thermal conductivity. The Adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) model was subsequently employed for modelling the determined results generated. A random test of 20 % from various nanofluids showed a deviation less than 1 % between measured and modeled results. It was inferred that <b>heat</b> <b>conductivities</b> increase with increase in the particle volume concentrations, especially when the later one at value of 1, the <b>heat</b> <b>conductivities</b> ratio approach to 1. 35. Nevertheless, the shape and the method of preparing the particles of nanometre size reveals anomalous enhancements in <b>heat</b> <b>conductivities</b> of bimetallic compared to monocular metallic nanofluids...|$|R

Metal fuels are normally alloyed, but some metal fuels have been made with pure uranium metal. Uranium alloys that have been used include uranium aluminum, uranium zirconium, uranium silicon, uranium molybdenum, and uranium zirconium hydride. Any of the aforementioned fuels can be made with plutonium and other actinides as part of a closed nuclear fuel cycle. Metal fuels have been used in water reactors and liquid metal fast breeder reactors, such as EBR-II.|$|E
25|$|In the 1780s, Wells and a {{few others}} had the idea that dew and frost {{occurred}} when the ground was a few degrees colder than the air above. But they thought the cold was caused by the dew and frost, not the other way around. In the autumn of 1811 Wells took some measurements and soon came to doubt his old idea. He began serious experiments soon after and published the results in August 1814. He compared the formation of dew under varying conditions of material, location, temperature, humidity, weather, cloud cover, season, and time of day. Wells concluded that dew is a condensation of water vapor in the air caused by just the right combination of conditions involving especially temperature, temperature change, and <b>heat</b> <b>conductivity</b> of materials.|$|E

500|$|The {{selection}} of a shielding gas depends on several factors, including the type of material being welded, joint design, and desired final weld appearance. [...] Argon is {{the most commonly used}} shielding gas for GTAW, since it helps prevent defects due to a varying arc length. When used with alternating current, argon shielding results in high weld quality and good appearance. Another common shielding gas, helium, is most often used to increase the weld penetration in a joint, to increase the welding speed, and to weld metals with high <b>heat</b> <b>conductivity,</b> such as copper and aluminum. A significant disadvantage is the difficulty of striking an arc with helium gas, and the decreased weld quality associated with a varying arc length.|$|E

2500|$|The aims {{at a new}} {{understanding}} of regionalism yet in a modern idiom materialised in the greater use of timber - the building material most associated historically with Finnish architecture. However, there lies a dichotomy in its use: between its inherent positive values and its use as symbolising nostalgia, not to mention exploiting its industrial potential by the pervading timber industry. Already in 1956 Alvar Aalto argued that the use of wood was not a nostalgic return to a traditional material; {{it was a case of}} its [...] "biological characteristics, its limited <b>heat</b> <b>conductivity,</b> its kinship with man and living nature, the pleasant sensation to the touch that it gives.". A special unit, the so-called Wood Studio - partly funded by the Finnish wood industry - was founded at Aalto University not only to research wood construction but also to build experimental structures in wood, often using computer-based parametric design principles. An early example of this is the Observation Tower at Helsinki Zoo (2002) by Ville Hara and the Wood Studio. Similarly, Kärsämäki Shingle Church (1999-2004) by Anssi Lassila, was the result of a student competition held by the University of Oulu Department of Architecture, based on the idea of a modern church built using 18th century timber construction techniques, as a reminder of a previous church on the same site. Other notable large-scale wooden constructions since 2000 include the Sibelius Concert Hall, Lahti (1997-2000), by APRT; the east stand roof of the Helsinki Olympic Stadium (2005) by K2S Architects; and Kilden Performing Arts Centre, Kristiansand, Norway (2012), by ALA Architects.
