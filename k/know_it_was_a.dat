25|$|I {{can tell}} how old I {{was because of}} where we lived - you know we moved all the time - and when I was just about two years old, I {{was walking down the}} street and having {{a hell of a lot}} of trouble because my {{shoelaces}} were untied and had come out of the holes, and every time I'd take a step I would step on one of those strings and stumble. And, you <b>know,</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> major problem. A flat tire's nothing compared to that. And everybody who would pass would laugh and think it was so funny you know, me stumbling along.|$|E

2500|$|After several false {{starts and}} stops, the band began {{recording}} ...Like Clockwork in August 2012, initially hoping that collaborator Trent Reznor would produce the album.

On the process of recording his mother's respirator, Ellison said: [...] "I <b>know</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> weird thing to do. I'm not the type to go out recording things like that. But I didn't want to forget that space." [...] When asked where the title came from, he said: [...] "that's the term my aunt gave my mother. It means mother as well." [...] He also used other samples, such as video game sounds.|$|E

2500|$|Two {{underlying}} currents {{run through}} Boys for Pele: exploring {{the role of}} women in both patriarchal religion and relationships. Amos had previously written songs in a religious and/or theological context ("Crucify" [...] from Little Earthquakes (1992), [...] "God" [...] from Under the Pink), but her viewpoint takes a particularly feminist slant on this album. [...] "The feminine part of God has been circumcised out of all religions... God (is) a patriarchal force, a very masculine energy, with the feminine having been subservient, either being the mother, the lover, the virgin, but never the equal, never to have the whole." [...] "Muhammad My Friend", the eighth track on the album, best represents this aspect of the album's theme with the line, [...] "It's time to tell the world/We both <b>know</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> girl back in Bethlehem." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "Even Flow" [...] {{features}} lyrics {{written by}} vocalist Eddie Vedder and music written by guitarist Stone Gossard. Bassist Jeff Ament said, [...] "I <b>know</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> great song all along, and I {{felt that it}} was the best song that we got the worst take of on the first record. There were a hundred takes on that song, and we just never nailed it." [...] Drummer Dave Krusen said, [...] "I was pretty green back then and 'Even Flow' suffered from too much fluctuation." [...] He added that [...] "it was really tough for me. I don't know why. Not sure why we didn't use that one from the demo as well, but I know it felt better." [...] Guitarist Mike McCready stated, [...] "We did 'Even Flow' about 50, 70 times. I swear to God it was a nightmare. We played that thing over and over until we hated each other. I still don't think Stone is satisfied with how it came out." ...|$|E

When she was interviewed about parenting with Tennis.com she said [...] "Being a mother is so different; it’s not that it’s quieter or faster, it’s just different. Being a mom is tough. You understand what’s good for you and the babies, while tennis is just a game. It’s fun because you have a different life when you step on the court but when the baby is sick you go crazy.

2500|$|On 6 September 2008, Quo Vadis {{played a}} concert at The Medley in Montreal, at which Stéphane Paré {{confirmed}} that Yanic and {{him would be}} leaving the band, leaving Bart as the only original member still left in the band. Bart speculated that {{the distance between the}} band and Yanic contributed to his departure; [...] "With regard to Yanic, I <b>know</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> very difficult decision to make on his part. People change, priorities change, personal situations change and he's been flying in from Tennessee for all the shows so you can imagine with the recent developments in the US/gas prices/travel {{and the fact that we}} were working remotely on the new record had probably something to do with it. I guess sometimes you have to make difficult decisions and this one was Yanic's. For sure on my end I will miss him on stage and working with him because he's been like a brother to me for 15 years and we've been through so much together." [...] At the same show, Bart's right knee, which had both ligaments torn away in a sports injury, gave in completely and he supported his entire weight on his left knee for the rest of the show. However, this was to no avail as eventually Rob [...] "The Witch" [...] from Necronomicon and Stephane from BCI had to carry Bart around for the rest of the set, eventually having him sit up on a chair for the remainder of the show. Stéphane proposed cutting the show short but Bart refused and played on till the end. In the following months, both his knees had to have surgery.|$|E
2500|$|As scripted by writer Rockne S. O'Bannon, Alien Nation was {{originally}} called, Future Tense. The film {{took some of}} its concept from the TV series In the Heat of the Night, with science fiction elements integrated in the plot. During production, the film had a working title called, Outer Heat, which essentially was an amalgam of In the Heat of the Night and a 1960s science fiction TV series, The Outer Limits. Jack Collis emphasized that the film was not a [...] "space epic" [...] but more of an action film. He admitted, [...] "We did build a spaceship, but it's a simple thing that you see on a TV monitor describing the landing of the aliens several years ago, before they became assimilated into our society. It gives us a background {{but not a lot}} of detail, ..." [...] Collis noted that the film was even [...] "reminiscent of the work I did in Cocoon." [...] An earlier draft of the film was actually written by director James Cameron in 1987, but his name however, was not credited in the final cut of the film. One conceit of the script was that immigrations officials ran out of names for the 300,000 aliens, and began to name them after familiar appellations of the past. Actor Mandy Patinkin's original name for his character was set to be George Jetson. However, three days before the start of shooting, Hanna-Barbera wouldn't allow the name to be used. Expressing his disappointment, Patinkin said, [...] "I assumed that the name of the character I agreed to play was George Jetson. And I was pretty pissed off that there was a screw-up and that the name couldn't be used." [...] He went on to say, [...] "I thought it made a tremendous difference to the piece that the guy's name was George Jetson because it gave a cartoon feeling, an innocence that was important to the movie's whole idea. It's a great loss to the piece that we couldn't recover, a great misfortune that couldn't be solved. It would have helped a lot." [...] In reference to the cartoon character, the producers would leave in the name [...] "George" [...] as a substitute. Patinkin added, [...] "Everything in the script is Jetson, everything on the makeup is labeled Jetson, we always refer to him as Jetson. Not even George, but Jetson. So in our minds, he's George Jetson. So as far as I'm concerned, anybody who sees the movie, they're watching George Jetson no matter what the hell they call him." [...] To understand his role of being a police officer, Patinkin spent two weeks hanging out with the New York City Police Department. He took their training course, joined them on patrol, and spent time with them at the firing range. Commenting on the character development of Francisco, he said [...] "It's one of the better jobs that people from his race have acquired. He feels very {{proud of the fact that}} he's able to be a cop." [...] In 2013, when asked about his role in the film, Caan initially replied, [...] "Why would you bring up that?" [...] before stating, [...] "Yeah, well, I don’t know. I don’t have too many... I mean, I loved Mandy Patinkin. Mandy was a riot. But... I don’t <b>know.</b> <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> lot of silly stuff, creatively. And we had this English director who I wasn’t really that fond of. I mean, nice guy, but... it was just one of those things where, you know, you don’t quit, you get through it. It certainly wasn’t one of... I wouldn’t write it down as one of my favorite movies.
