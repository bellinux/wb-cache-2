5|$|Drowned God: Conspiracy of the Ages is a 1996 {{science fiction}} {{adventure}} game developed by Epic Multimedia Group {{and published by}} Inscape. The game propounds the conspiracy theory that all of human history is a lie and that the human race's development and evolution were aided by extraterrestrials. The player attempts to uncover the truth {{through the course of}} the game by traveling to a variety of <b>different</b> <b>worlds,</b> interacting with historical and fictional characters, and solving puzzles.|$|E
5|$|In the mid-1960s, DC {{established}} that characters appearing in comics published {{prior to the}} Silver Age lived on a parallel Earth the company dubbed Earth-Two. Characters introduced in the Silver Age and onward lived on Earth-One. It was {{established that}} the two realities were separated by a vibrational field that could be crossed, should a storyline involve superheroes from <b>different</b> <b>worlds</b> teaming up.|$|E
5|$|Exile begins 10 {{years after}} the events of Riven, when the Stranger arrives {{at the home of}} Atrus and his wife Catherine. Atrus is a {{scientist}} and explorer who has mastered an ancient practice known as the Art: he can create links to <b>different</b> <b>worlds,</b> called Ages, by writing special books. This ability is by an ancient civilization known as the D'ni, whose society crumbles after the D'ni city is devastated by a plague. Atrus calls the Stranger to his home to display his newest Age, Releeshahn, which Atrus has designed as a new home for the D'ni survivors.|$|E

5|$|Reception of {{the book}} has {{generally}} been positive. It has also become suggested reading for many military organizations, including the United States Marine Corps. Ender's Game won the 1985 Nebula Award for best novel and the 1986 Hugo Award for best novel. Its sequels, Speaker for the Dead, Xenocide, Children of the Mind and Ender in Exile, follow Ender's subsequent travels to many <b>different</b> <b>worlds</b> in the galaxy. In addition, the later novella A War of Gifts and novel Ender's Shadow take place {{during the same time}} period as the original.|$|E
5|$|The novel's {{representations}} of social stratification {{are specific to}} Paris, perhaps the most densely populated city in Europe at the time. Traveling only a few blocks– as Rastignac does continually– takes the reader into vastly <b>different</b> <b>worlds,</b> distinguished by their architecture and reflecting the class of their inhabitants. Paris in the post-Napoleonic era was split into distinct neighborhoods. Three of these are featured prominently in Le Père Goriot: the aristocratic area around the Boulevard Saint-Germain, the newly upscale quarter of the rue de la Chaussée-d'Antin, and the run-down area on the eastern slope of the Montagne Sainte-Geneviève.|$|E
5|$|Jaco Van Dormael hired {{visual effects}} {{supervisor}} Louis Morin, {{known for his}} work in Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind (2004), to create visual effects for Mr. Nobody. All five hundred visual effects shots were produced in Quebec by Quebec companies. Modus FX announced having delivered 121 digital visual effects shots for the film. The company was entrusted with complex sequences which could not be captured on film, involving the digital reproduction of entire cities, villages and other-worldly settings. Modus FX also worked on several complex transitions between the <b>different</b> <b>worlds</b> and multiple lives of Nemo Nobody. Modus FX's post-production contributions involved 37 digital artists and technicians across a six-month period. A long list of software, including Autodesk's Softimage and Maya, Side Effects' Houdini and The Foundry's Nuke, {{and the creation of a}} multitude of in-house tools, programs and techniques was required for the shots delivered.|$|E

5|$|Levels in {{the game}} include a mixture of platforming, {{swimming}} and on-rails levels. They are based around several returning themes including forests, cliff-sides, factories and mountain tops. The level design is more diverse compared to its predecessors, which includes more complex puzzles and obstacles. Every level has an enemy called a Koin; each of these enemies bears the DK Coin of their respective level, holding it as a shield. As these enemies always face towards the player, they must be defeated by throwing a steel barrel over them so it bounces off a wall behind {{them in order to}} strike them from behind. The game overworld is also more complex, allowing players to explore between each area instead of forcing them along a linear path. To achieve this, the game includes several vehicles such as a speedboat and hovercraft which can be used to traverse the overworld and access <b>different</b> <b>worlds.</b>|$|E
5|$|Pitt {{attended}} Kickapoo High School, {{where he}} was a member of the golf, swimming and tennis teams. He participated in the school's Key and Forensics clubs, in school debates, and in musicals. Following his graduation from high school, Pitt enrolled in the University of Missouri in 1982, majoring in journalism with a focus on advertising. As graduation approached, Pitt did not feel ready to settle down. He loved films—"a portal into <b>different</b> <b>worlds</b> for me"—and, since films were not made in Missouri, he decided to go to where they were made. Two weeks before earning his degree, Pitt left the university and moved to Los Angeles, where he took acting lessons and worked odd jobs.|$|E
5|$|The second {{version was}} a lyric video, which {{features}} Hamasaki in a recording studio. It also features candid photos of Hamasaki in Los Angeles, Japan, and doing other endeavours outside of music. The Riff Studio version features Hamasaki as her character design AyuPan and a character titled the Bloody Bunny. Both {{of them are}} in a space ship, and travel throughout <b>different</b> <b>worlds</b> and atmospheres, until landing on a planet with blue aliens. The aliens appear to be sad, whist AyuPan and the Bloody Bunny stand there. AyuPan then plays the song from her space ship, and makes the aliens feel happy; they all begin dancing to the track. It ends with the world turning pink instead of blue, and has heart shapes around it. This version premiered one week before the album's release in July 2, and was included on the DVD and Blu-Ray versions of Colours.|$|E

5|$|Kingdom Hearts χ is a {{role-playing}} {{video game}} {{set in the}} universe of Kingdom Hearts which includes original characters and locations as well as ones from Disney and Final Fantasy media properties. Before beginning, players create their own character. Players can customize the gender, hair, and clothing, and choose accessories themed after both Square Enix and Disney universes present in the Kingdom Hearts series. Story missions are unlocked by the player. After {{a certain amount of}} the available content has been completed, new story missions become available. Players navigate their surroundings by dragging their cursor across the screen. Players navigate <b>different</b> <b>worlds,</b> defeating monsters known as the Heartless. The base game is free to play, with optional microtransactions. Actions use up AP, which can be replenished by either waiting or by using potions, which can be earned or bought. Rare items such as special cards can also be purchased. Alongside the single-player mode, there is a multiplayer mode where teams of players take on Raid Bosses, gigantic Heartless with high HP.|$|E
5|$|The {{game is a}} 2D side-scrolling {{platformer}} {{in which}} the player controls either Diddy Kong or his girlfriend Dixie Kong through 52 varying levels over eight <b>different</b> <b>worlds.</b> The main objective {{of the game is}} to rescue Donkey Kong from King K. Rool. The game features a wide amount of enemies, which include land-based reptilian Kremlings, rats, bees and vultures. Enemies in underwater sections include pufferfish, eels and sharks. Each world culminates with a boss fight, which is required to be defeated in order to progress through that world. Similar to its predecessor, the player-characters may neutralise most hostiles by jumping on their heads, cartwheeling through them, or throwing a barrel at them. When hit by an enemy, the active character leaves the screen, thus control will immediately switch to the other character. The player can reclaim their partner from marked DK barrels throughout the game. If both characters die, the player will lose a life and will restart from the last checkpoint, which come in the form as a star-painted barrel. If the player loses all of their lives, the game will end.|$|E
5|$|Writers {{have placed}} the story within several {{different}} genres, including science fiction, a subgenre {{of science fiction}} called recursive science fiction, and fantasy. Masters of the Occult author Daniel Cohen noted the book contributed to Hubbard's reception among influential science fiction authors of the 1940s. It is regarded as classic science fiction by The Houghton Mifflin Dictionary of Biography in its entry on Hubbard, {{as well as by}} writer James Gunn, and publications including the Daily News of Los Angeles, and Chicago Sun-Times. Writers have placed Typewriter in the Sky within the Golden Age of Science Fiction. Authors Mike Resnick and Robert J. Sawyer classed the story within the science fiction subgenre recursive science fiction, and writer Gary Westfahl wrote that Hubbard may have been influenced by the 1921 Luigi Pirandello play within the recursive fantasy subgenre, Six Characters in Search of an Author. The book is listed in Fantasy: The 100 Best Books, and Rivals of Weird Tales: 30 Great Fantasy and Horror Stories from the Weird Fiction Pulps placed it among the best quality fantasy writing of the 20th century. Writers characterized the overarching theme within the book as dealing with an individual caught between two <b>different</b> <b>worlds.</b>|$|E

5|$|After a jet-set life in Singapore, Adam {{returns to}} Manchester {{to visit his}} old friends and to see son Matthew (now portrayed by Ceallach Spellman), {{breaking}} the news of his upcoming nuptials with businesswoman Angela Zubayr (Karen David). This isn't well received amongst the group, especially Matthew who sees Angela {{as a replacement for}} his mother Rachel. Struggling to support his family, Pete finds himself in two run down jobs and suffering from depression, which Jenny seems oblivious too. Seeing a fault in their love life, she pursues a fling with client Trevor Green (Nicholas Gleaves), who begins to stalk her. Torn apart after the death of Harry (James Bolam), an old man who he was caring for, Pete considers suicide. David is entangled through a wrongdoing at work and is arrested, something which his wife Robyn finds humiliating and throws him out of their luxury Cheshire home. Karen finds herself on the dating game, and soon falls for Adam's father-in-law Eddie (Art Malik), though later discovers that they live in two very <b>different</b> <b>worlds,</b> with Karen's twin daughters Ellie (Ella Hunt) and Olivia (Daisy Edgar-Jones) still dependant on her. Jenny's ex-partner Robert (Robert Webb) from her time in New York City turns up on her doorstep determined to see their daughter Chloe (Madeleine Edmondson), who still believes that Pete is her father. Struggling to cope with living in Manchester and being step-mother to Matthew, Angela decides to end her marriage with Adam, who fell quickly for his landlord Tina Reynolds (Leanne Best). At Adam's 49th Birthday party, the Marsden's eldest son Josh (Callum Woodhouse) arrives from Spain with former nanny Ramona (Jacey Salles), and it is later revealed that he is gay.|$|E

25|$|The {{problem of}} {{interaction}} between formulae holding in <b>different</b> <b>worlds</b> can be overcome by using set-labeling tableaux.

25|$|As {{a result}} of the {{possibly}} <b>different</b> <b>worlds</b> where formulae are assumed true, a formula in a node is not automatically valid in all its descendants, as every application of the modal rule correspond to a move from a world to another one. This condition is automatically captured by set-labeling tableaux, as expansion rules are based only on the leaf where they are applied and not on its ancestors.|$|E
