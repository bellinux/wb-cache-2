5|$|I {{remained}} on the wreck until she went down; the suction took me down some way, and a man got <b>hold</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> leg, but I managed to kick him off and came up and struck out for some pieces of wood {{that were on the}} water and started for land, about two miles off. I was in the water about five hours, as the shore was so rocky and the surf ran so high that a great many were lost trying to land. Nearly all those that took to the water without their clothes on were taken by sharks; hundreds of them were all round us, and I saw men taken by them close to me, but as I was dressed (having on a flannel shirt and trousers) they preferred the others. I was not in the least hurt, and am happy to say, kept my head clear; most of the officers lost their lives from losing their presence of mind and trying to take money with them, and from not throwing off their coats. - Letter from Lieutenant J.F. Girardot, 43rd Light Infantry, to his father, 1 March 1852.|$|E
500|$|The {{antiquarian}} Austin Cooper {{visited the}} house in 1779 and found it {{in a state of}} disrepair. Joseph Holt, a general of the Society of the United Irishmen recorded in his memoirs that he spent a night in the ruin of Mount Pelier while on the run following the 1798 Rebellion. Holt wrote of his experience, [...] "I lay down in the arched room of that remarkable building. I felt confident of the protection of the Almighty that the name of enchantment and the idle stories that were told of the place had but a slight <b>hold</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> mind." [...] The Conollys sold the lands to Luke White in 1800. They passed through inheritance to the Massy family of Duntrileage, County Limerick. When the Massy family became bankrupt, the lands were acquired by the State. Today, the building is maintained by Coillte, who manage the forestry plantations on Mount Pelier's slopes, and have installed concrete stairs and iron safety rails across the upper windows.|$|E

2500|$|He was {{involved}} in controversy during the Melbourne derby on 6 January 2012 against the Shane Warne-led Melbourne Stars; during the Stars' innings, Samuels held back David Hussey at the non-striker's end when the batters were trying {{to take a second}} run off Samuels' bowling. Warne reacted angrily to this when he was later bowling to Samuels himself; he continuously sledged Samuels, asking if he was going [...] "grab <b>hold</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> shirt too, Marlon?" [...] The incident escalated when Warne, appearing to attempt to throw the ball to the wicket-keeper, tossed it gently at Samuels, who responded by throwing his bat in Warne's direction. This led to an angry confrontation between the two mid-pitch. Both players were suspended, but Samuels missed the rest of the BBL season in any case, as he received an injury due to a bouncer from Lasith Malinga in the same game. The pair have been far from kind about each other in interviews since this incident.|$|E

6000|$|I {{thought that}} it was fancy, and I listen'd in my bed, [...] And then did {{something}} speak to me--I know not what was said; [...] For great delight and shuddering took <b>hold</b> <b>of</b> all <b>my</b> mind, [...] And up the valley came again the music on the wind.|$|R
6000|$|... "It was {{the devil}} got <b>hold</b> <b>of</b> me, <b>my</b> Lord. Up to that I {{had always been}} square,--square as a die! I got to think that your Lordship was upsetting. I don't know whether your Lordship remembers, but you did put me down once or twice rather uncommon." ...|$|R
60|$|He caught <b>hold</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> dress. He was on {{his knees}} before me--a bent, imploring figure.|$|E

60|$|I {{put my hand}} to my sword, but Checco caught <b>hold</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> arm. I {{recovered}} {{myself at}} once.|$|E

60|$|Polly got up when {{he spoke}} to her--before that she had been sitting on the sofa by me, <b>holding</b> one <b>of</b> <b>my</b> hands in hers--now she went up to him. She put one of her hands on his shoulder, took one of his hands in her other, and looked up into his face.|$|R
60|$|I {{could not}} let the good woman <b>hold</b> this opinion <b>of</b> <b>my</b> tenants, and I briefly told her the truth. She {{looked at me with}} moist admiration in her eyes.|$|R

6000|$|I said I had {{got it on}} the boat. So {{then she}} started for the house, leading me by the hand, and the {{children}} tagging after.

6000|$|... "No," [...] {{returned}} the midshipman with a frank look, [...] "I will follow you now, sir, to the end. How far I am guilty {{is a question}} that does not concern me at present.

60|$|After supper I was {{requested}} to relate, seriatim, all the recent events connected with {{my visit to}} the 'Nest, my arrest and liberation.
