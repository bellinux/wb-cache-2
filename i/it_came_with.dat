5|$|Inside the case, {{there were}} many more {{similarities}} with the ZX81. Like its successor, it used the Z80A microprocessor and had only 1KB of on-board RAM. <b>It</b> <b>came</b> <b>with</b> a specially written BASIC interpreter on a dedicated ROM chip and could use a television as a display. It relied on an ordinary cassette tape recorder for data storage. The main {{difference between the two}} machines lay in the internal software; when the ZX81 was released, ZX80 owners were able to upgrade by the relatively simple expedient of plugging a new ROM onto the circuit board.|$|E
5|$|Maken Shao {{was first}} {{announced}} in February 2001. Prior to its official announcement, there was speculation {{that it was}} a sequel to the original game. Maken Shao was published by Atlus in Japan on June 7, 2001. <b>It</b> <b>came</b> <b>with</b> both standard and limited editions, with the limited edition having exclusive cover art. It was published in Europe as Maken Shao: Demon Sword by Midas Interactive Entertainment on July 26, 2003. This version was later re-released by Midas Interactive Entertainment on the European PlayStation Network on February 27, 2013 as a PlayStation Classic title.|$|E
5|$|In {{the second}} quarter of 2012, the Naga 2012 was released. Similarly to the Naga Epic, <b>it</b> <b>came</b> <b>with</b> {{interchangeable}} side panels. The Naga 2012 supported Razer's Synapse 2.0 software allowing all the buttons to be programmed and that information to be stored online. The other 2012 installment was the Naga Hex, the first mouse in the series to have only six programmable side-on buttons. Razer noted it was made for multiplayer online battle arenas (MOBAs), such as League of Legends and Diablo 3, instead of massively multiplayer online games (MMOs). In May of the same year, the Wraith Red edition was released. The only difference between the versions was the coloring. In March 2013, after the announcement of a partnership between Razer and Riot Games, a League of Legends style Naga Hex was released, with the only difference being the design and the change from a plastic to a matte surface.|$|E

5|$|Macrinus {{began to}} {{overturn}} Caracalla's fiscal policies and moved closer towards {{those that had}} been set forth by Septimius Severus. One such policy change involved the pay of Roman legionnaires. The soldiers that were already enlisted during Caracalla's reign enjoyed exorbitant payments which were impossible for Macrinus to reduce without risking a potential rebellion. Instead, Macrinus allowed the enlisted soldiers to retain their higher payments, but he reduced the pay of new recruits to the level which had been set by Severus. Macrinus revalued the Roman currency, increasing the silver purity and weight of the denarius from 50.78 percent and 1.66 grams at the end of Caracalla's reign to 57.85 percent and 1.82 grams from Fall 217 {{to the end of his}} reign, so that it mirrored Severus' fiscal policy for the period 197–209 A.D. Macrinus' goal with these policies might have been to return Rome to the relative economic stability that had been enjoyed under Severus' reign, though <b>it</b> <b>came</b> <b>with</b> a cost. The fiscal changes that Macrinus enacted might have been tenable had it not been for the military. By this time, the strength of the military was too great and by enacting his reforms he angered the veteran soldiers, who viewed his actions in reducing the pay of new recruits as a foreshadowing of eventual reductions in their own privileges and pay. This significantly reduced Macrinus' popularity with the legions that had declared him emperor.|$|E
5|$|Type-0 HD was {{released}} on March 17, 19 and 20, 2015 for North America, Japan and Europe respectively. <b>It</b> <b>came</b> <b>with</b> both English and Japanese voice tracks for all regions. The game included a demo of Final Fantasy XV, titled Final Fantasy XV: Episode Duscae. The demo was only available in limited quantities: it was exclusive to physical first-print editions, and came with the digital edition for two months after release. The collector's edition, available through Square Enix's online store and at Amazon.com, came with a special CD featuring tracks from Type-0 and Agito, a calendar featuring official artwork, a Vermillion Peristylium ID card, a set of five cards modeled after those used by Ace in battle, and a cadet scarf. Limited editions of the game were produced for North America and Europe, for sale at selected high street and online stores. A PlayStation 4 hardware bundle was also produced for Japan, featuring {{a copy of the}} game and download code for the XV demo along with a console themed after the game. A port to Microsoft Windows via Valve Corporation's Steam platform was developed. This port was created in response to fan demands for a PC version. In contrast to the console version, the PC port allowed graphic adjustments, and included fixes for camera control and motion blur issues raised by players and reviewers after release. The port {{was released}} on August 18, 2015. As part of the promotion for the port, Final Fantasy-themed pre-order gifts for use in Dota 2 were created.|$|E

25|$|For an {{extended}} period of time—prewar through the early 1950s—the Pontiac was a quiet, solid car, but not especially powerful. <b>It</b> <b>came</b> <b>with</b> a flathead straight eight. Straight 8s were slightly less expensive to produce than the increasingly popular V8s, but they were also heavier and longer. Additionally, the long crankshaft suffered from excessive flex, restricting straight 8s to a relatively low compression ratio with a modest redline. However, in this application, inexpensive (yet very quiet) flatheads were not a liability.|$|E
