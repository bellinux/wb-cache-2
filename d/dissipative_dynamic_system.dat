40|$|It {{is argued}} {{that the world is}} a <b>dissipative</b> <b>dynamic</b> <b>system,</b> a phase flow of which is formed by conformally-symplectic mapping. The key {{assumption}} is that the concept of energy in microcosm makes sense only for the steady motions corresponding to quantum eigenstates. The constant, which determines the exponential phase volume contraction, {{is supposed to be a}} new universal constant, in addition to the speed of light and Planck constant. It is shown that statistical treatment of quantum objects as the ensembles concentrated on smooth connected attractors provides a simple explanation of stochastic behaviour of these objects as well as leads to a natural interpretation of the wave function, stationary Schrodinger equation, and scattering matrix. To validate the general hypotheses stated in the work, some physical models are presented. In particular, the models support the view that the inertial motion and quantum properties are basically determined by the vacuum as a dynamic subsystem. The matter-vacuum interaction is described formally by means of multivalued Hamilton function. A drawback of all these models is the non-locality of equations of motion stemming from the non-locality of variation of multivalued Hamilton function. This drawback can be overcome in the field theory using multivalued functionals with a local first variation opened by S. P. Novikov. Hence, a prospect of construction of the unified field theory in Einstein spirit, without a procedure of quantization is opened. Comment: 118 page...|$|E

This is a coupled non-parabolic <b>dissipative</b> <b>dynamic</b> <b>system.</b> For the system with non-constant density in the whole space R^ 3, we establish the global existence of weak solutions. For the system with non-constant density on a bounded domain in two dimensional and three dimensional cases, we establish the regularity and uniqueness of solutions. We obtain that, in 2 D, the global regularity with general data; in 3 D, the global regularity with small initial data and a local (short time) regularity with large data. In addition, with more smoothness assumption on initial data, we obtain the uniqueness both for dimension 2 and 3 cases. The main tools are higher order energy estimates (so called Ladyzhenskaya estimate), Gagliardo-Nirenberg interpolation inequalities and the frozen coefficient method. For the system with constant density in the whole space R^ 3 with small initial data,we study the large time behavior of solutions and obtain algebraic decay rate for the solutions inenergy space. The main ingredient to derive decay is Fourier splitting method which was originally introduced by M. Schonbek to study the large time behavior of solutions to Navier-Stokes equations.

40|$|International audienceThe {{modelling}} {{of signal}} {{in the context}} of multiple components, few samples, strong non-stationarity and non-linearity is a difficult problem. For signals in this category, classical methods such as Fourier-based techniques, time-frequency representation, and high order ambiguity function suffer from limitations of various kinds. For this concern, some other techniques which avoid these limitations should be applied. A model based on polynomial approximation of both the instantaneous amplitude and frequency had been proved to be a favorable choice. With consideration of adapting to ambient vibration signals where the amplitude is damped, we propose to use a new model of which the amplitude is approximated by damped exponentials. Meanwhile, the instantaneous frequency is represented by low-order orthonormal polynomials in order to track the strong local variations. Then the parameters estimation is carried out via a maximum likelihood procedure followed by a stochastic optimization method. For the purpose of faster convergence, the adaptive simulated annealing is employed which permits a more flexible temperature tuning. In order to study the behavior of the proposed algorithm, we then detail its performance based on simulated multi-component signals. Cramer-Rao bounds are recalculated and compared with those obtained by the model previously proposed, where the amplitude is based on polynomial approximation. Analysis of the frequency resolution between two closely spaced components is also shown as another important evidence of performance. In order to achieve a direct physical interpretation in real world applications, the proposed amplitude-frequency model is transformed to the physical damping model, under which the estimated signal is decomposed into time-varying resonance frequencies and damping ratios. The algorithm is further applied on ambient vibrations of buildings as a local analysis. Results are discussed in agreement with the model of a <b>dissipative</b> <b>dynamic</b> <b>system,</b> which corresponds to the ambient vibrations of a building...|$|E

40|$|<b>Dynamic</b> <b>System</b> という概念は行動乃至経験を説明する理論的構成体 (theoretical construct) として 1949 年以来、David Krech (旧名 I. Krechevsky, 現 California 大学教授) によつて用いられている概念である。彼は此の概念を中心として心理学の理論統一、ひいては科学の統一の資としようとする理論を展開している。彼がこのDynamic System 論を打立てるに当つて２つの根本的要請に立つている。その１つは理論構成上のこの概念の性格に関するものであり、今１つはこの概念の実存的性格に関するものである。前者はDynamic System が１つの仮説的構成体 (hypothetical construct) であるということであり、後者はDynamic System は大脳における神経学的事象 (neurological events) であり、更に詳しくは電気的化学的作用の生起する場 (a {{field of}} electrical-chemical activities) であるということである。しかして、この２つの要請は心理学的理論構成体が大脳的事象であるという彼の根本的見解の２つの面である。Krechはこの概念を最近の３つの論文で展開しているが、未だ構想中の域を脱しないものであつて、実験的裏づけにまで到つては居らない。私は Krech の理論づけの跡を辿り、その意義を検討して見ようと思う。In three recent {{articles}} Professor Krech is developing {{the theory of}} <b>Dynamic</b> <b>System.</b> <b>Dynamic</b> <b>Systems</b> are theoretical constructs in a unified psychological theory. He defines <b>Dynamic</b> <b>System</b> as a hypothetical construct in the theoretical consideration, and in the existential consideration he defines it as a neurological event. This theory is based upon his intention to perform the unity of science {{in such a way}} that scientists seek to make physical principles congruent with neurological ones, neurological ones with psychological ones, and at each point the most inclusive set of data must be the test of how well they achieve this congruence. A <b>Dynamic</b> <b>System</b> is conceived as a open system of central neural process, that is, a field of electrical-chemical activities, and a fundamental unit of the brain field. The kind and number of <b>Dynamic</b> <b>Systems,</b> the changes which occur within each <b>Dynamic</b> <b>System,</b> and the interaction among <b>Dynamic</b> <b>Systems</b> deteｒmine all experiences and behaviors. Based on the suggestions about open system model presented by Bertalanffy, he gives the characteristics of open <b>system</b> to his <b>Dynamic</b> <b>Systems,</b> so <b>Dynamic</b> <b>Systems</b> may develop spontaneously toward states of greater complexity and in its final reorganization, a <b>Dynamic</b> <b>System</b> may maintain a steady state and continue to do work. <b>Dynamic</b> <b>Systems</b> are localized in the brain, but conditioned by events in the entire brain. At this point he makes the concept of <b>Dynamic</b> <b>System</b> Family and considers the rigidity of <b>Dynamic</b> <b>Systems.</b> On the theory of his <b>Dynamic</b> <b>System,</b> we must at first pay much attention to the direction of his intention toward the unity of science. Most attempts to achieve the unity of science have been made along the way opposite to his direction. The second point we must discuss is that he adopts a physical-biological model of open system. At this point he has made one more step than Köhler's, physical model of electrical field. But he has far less details about his model than Köhler, so the experimental tests of his theory by himself and others have been made impossible. We must regard his theory as being uncompleted at the viewpoint of hypothetico-deducｔive type of theorizing. We expect he will make his theory develop further to demonstrate that his <b>Dynamic</b> <b>Systems</b> can provide for better prediction of behavior than other theories. One more point we feel uncontent is that <b>Dynamic</b> <b>System</b> is now a biological-physical model and not a physical-biological-psychological model.
