If you wish an <b>email</b> <b>copy</b> of this letter {{that will allow}} you to more readily look up some of the sources of information, please email me at rbayerorednet. org. Several newspaper articles in the Newport News-Times and Lincoln City News Guard indicate that Lincoln County officials are suggesting that things went pretty smoothly at the level of local government and that the main glitches were caused by the federal government and an uneducated public. The past work with tsunami preparation and education by Jim Hawley, Sheriff Dotson, and the County Commissioners with local communities in Lincoln County is exemplary (e. g., Gallob 2005 c,d), and I commend the County for its efforts. However, the June 14 warning reveals several issues of concern in the preparation, responses, and public education outreach by Lincoln County. The purpose of this letter is to focus on potential solutions for several crucial issues that have not received much attention. I do not discuss sirens, reverse 9 - 1 - 1, or other warning systems that have been and continue to be debated. I realize that this letter is long and discusses many topics (see Contents on top of next page), but if you only consider one item, please consider "Create a Plan for Evacuation ofPeople with Limited Mobility " on p. 6...|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} I {{argue that the}} Foot Washing of John 13 : 1 – 17, as {{literary}} composition, is a creative imitation of the Foot Washing and Anointing of Luke 7 : 36 – 50. Comparison of the respective settings, action descriptions, dialogs, and transitions brings to light a large array of mostly unexplored literary connections between these two texts. Analysis of the parallel features reveals {{a high level of}} density, order, and distinctiveness that clearly establishes an intertextual relationship of creative imitation, that combination of mimēsis and zēlōsis widely practiced by authors in antiquity. Key markers of directionality arising from the evidence points to Luke 2 ̆ 7 s text as the original and John 2 ̆ 7 s as the mimesis.

On 23 July 2012, the US Senate’s Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations released a 335-page report setting out HSBC’s compliance failures over a ten year period. In the report, Senate investigators said the bank had bypassed the USA’s sanctions against Iran, enabled money laundering by Mexican drug lords (chiefly for the Sinaloa Cartel), and had conducted business with companies with links to terrorism. The report quoted <b>emails</b> <b>copied</b> to Green detailing such dubious transactions and alleged that the bank had continued {{to allow them to}} continue even after he and his colleagues had promised to act.

But is everyone reinventing the wheel, looking for {{the best way to}} teach search strategies, citing and referencing or keeping up to date for researchers? In practice librarians are usually more than happy to share their resources through numerous information literacy conferences and networks.

There have been several initiatives or projects to encourage librarians to share their teaching materials.

40|$|I {{began using}} the Internet in my {{literature}} classes in 1992, {{before the advent}} of the World Wide Web. Over the past 11 years, my use of the Internet for pedagogical purposes has passed through four major stages, and has recently emerged into a fifth stage that I call &quot;Deep Reading. &quot; In this article, I outline and illustrate this progression, with primary emphasis on the latest stage. I not only discuss the &quot;what &quot; and &quot;why &quot; of Web-enhanced instruction, but also provide some practical suggestions on how to employ it successfully. I hope that this account of my experience may inspire other instructors to use digital technologies experimentally in their teaching, and that the specific techniques I describe may save some colleagues from having to start from scratch, as I did. Stage 1 : Class Management The term &quot;paperless classroom &quot; can be used to encompass all the ways in which classes can be taught and managed with the latest technologies. However, most writers use it only to refer to the management of classroom instruction: the collection, correction, return, and/or storage of records of attendance, assignments, examinations, and grades (Robb, 1997; Damery, 1998; Keller, 2001). In my first stage of technology integration, I developed a set of techniques to streamline these activities. I began by requiring that students submit all assignments by text-only <b>email,</b> <b>copying</b> and pasting their work from a word processing program with the text appropriately formatted. I established a consistent format for the e-mail &quot;subject &quot; line so that I could file assignments by class, date, and student and then easily retrieve a particular message with the search function of my e-mail client. I discovered that spreadsheet programs can be easily adapted to grading. (Instructors can readily obtain help with even complex formulas—for example, averaging a series of assignment grades while dropping the lowest several grades—by posting questions on &quot;expert &quot; Usenet newsgroups such a...|$|R
