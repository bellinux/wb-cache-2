5|$|Some {{degree of}} {{self-regulation}} occurs whereby {{banks and other}} financial institutions attempt to operate within guidelines set and published by multilateral {{organizations such as the}} International Monetary Fund or the Bank for International Settlements (particularly the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision and the Committee on the Global Financial System). Further examples of international regulatory bodies are: the Financial Stability Board (FSB) established to coordinate information and activities among developed countries; the International Organization of Securities Commissions (IOSCO) which coordinates the regulation of financial securities; the International Association of Insurance Supervisors (IAIS) which promotes consistent insurance industry supervision; the Financial Action Task Force on Money Laundering which facilitates collaboration in battling money laundering and terrorism financing; and the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) which publishes accounting and auditing standards. Public and private arrangements exist to assist and guide countries struggling with sovereign debt payments, such as the Paris Club and London Club. National securities commissions and independent financial regulators maintain oversight of their industries' foreign exchange market activities. Two examples of supranational financial regulators in Europe are the <b>European</b> <b>Banking</b> <b>Authority</b> (EBA) which identifies systemic risks and institutional weaknesses and may overrule national regulators, and the European Shadow Financial Regulatory Committee (ESFRC) which reviews financial regulatory issues and publishes policy recommendations.|$|E

40|$|The {{results of}} the <b>European</b> <b>Banking</b> <b>Authority’s</b> (EBA) stress test, {{administered}} to banks across the EU and published {{at the end of}} July 2016, revealed some large differences across banks. Our analysis of the results for the 51 banking groups suggests that not economic growth but rather the exposures to non-performing loans (NPLs) and to governments and corporates seem to be the main drivers behind the impact of the adverse scenario. This implies that the stress tests are primarily responding to the risks that have already materialised. They are therefore useful for understanding the implications of the currently identified risks, but they do not necessarily give insights into the fundamental soundness of the <b>European</b> <b>banking</b> sector.

2500|$|Among {{the most}} {{important}} governance standards are rights vote for {{who is on the}} board of directors for investors of labour and capital. A Draft Fifth Company Law Directive proposed in 1972, which would have required EU-wide rights for employees to vote for boards stalled mainly because it attempted to require two-tier board structures, although most EU member states have codetermination today with unified boards. The Shareholder Rights Directive 2007 requires shareholders be able to make proposals, ask questions at meetings, vote by proxy and vote through intermediaries. This has become increasingly important as most company shares are held by institutional investors (primarily asset managers or banks, depending on the member state) who are holding [...] "other people's money". A large proportion of this money comes from employees and other people saving for retirement, but who do not have an effective voice. Unlike Switzerland after a 2013 people's initiative, or the U.S. Dodd-Frank Act 2010 in relation to brokers, the EU has not yet prevented intermediaries casting votes without express instructions of beneficiaries. This concentrates power into a small number of financial institutions, and creates the potential for conflicts of interest where financial institutions sell retirement, banking or products to companies in which they cast votes with other people's money. A series of rights for ultimate investors exist in the Institutions for Occupational Retirement Provision Directive 2003. This requires duties of disclosure in how a retirement fund is run, funding and insurance to guard against insolvency, but not yet that voting rights are only cast on the instructions of investors. By contrast, the Undertakings for Collective Investment in Transferable Securities Directive 2009 does suggest that investors in a mutual fund or ("collective investment scheme") should control the voting rights. The UCITS Directive 2009 is primarily concerned with creating a [...] "passport". If a firm complies with rules on authorisation, and governance of the management and investment companies in an overall fund structure, it can sell its shares in a collective investment scheme across the EU. This forms a broader package of Directives on securities and financial market regulation, much of which has been shaped by experience in the banking crisis of 2007–08. Additional rules on remuneration practices, separating depositary bodies in firms from management and investment companies, and more penalties for violations were inserted in 2014. These measures are meant to decrease the risk to investors that an investment goes insolvent. The Markets in Financial Instruments Directive 2004 applies to other businesses selling financial instruments. It requires similar authorisation procedures to have a [...] "passport" [...] to sell in any EU country, and transparency of financial contracts through duties to disclose material information about products being sold, including disclosure of potential conflicts of interest with clients. The Alternative Investment Fund Managers Directive 2011 applies to firms with massive quantities of capital, over €100million, essentially hedge funds and private equity firms. Similarly, it requires authorisation to sell products EU wide, and then basic transparency requirements on products being sold, requirements in remuneration policies for fund managers that are perceived to reduce [...] "risk" [...] or make pay [...] "performance" [...] related. They do not, however, require limits to pay. There are general prohibitions on conflicts of interest, and specialised prohibitions on asset stripping. The Solvency II Directive 2009 is directed particularly at insurance firms, requiring minimum capital and best practices in valuation of assets, again to avoid insolvency. The Capital Requirements Directives contain analogous rules, with a similar goals, for banks. To administer the new rules, the European System of Financial Supervision was established in 2011, and consists of three main branches: the European Securities and Markets Authority in Paris, the <b>European</b> <b>Banking</b> <b>Authority</b> in London and the European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority in Frankfurt.|$|E

40|$|The latest {{financial}} crisis has exposed substantial {{weaknesses in the}} bank risk models used by national regulators {{as well as the}} Basel Accords. The study is aimed at presenting the evolution and critique of risk measures and risk models in banking, with a special focus on the dynamically developing area of systemic risk measures. A discussion of the features of the respective measures allows us to draw conclusions for banking regulations based on the analyzed models and to present the main challenges for regulators in terms of bank risk measurement. The study shows that substantial challenges for regulators include compensating for the drawbacks of the Value at Risk (VaR) and expected shortfall risk models, resolving the pro-cyclicality in risk modeling, improving the techniques of stress testing, and addressing the fallacy of composition in banking (i. e., to model risk from a systemic point of view and not only from the perspective of an individual bank). As the discussion concerning proper risk measurement in regulatory frameworks, such as the Basel Accord or the <b>European</b> <b>Banking</b> <b>Authority's</b> (EBA) rules is in progress, the topic seems to be of particular importance; moreover, measures of systemic risk are not yet a subject of regulation...|$|R

40|$|Financial {{networks}} are dynamic. To assess their systemic {{importance to the}} world-wide economic network and avert losses we need models that take the time variations of the links and nodes into account. Using the methodology of classical mechanics and Laplacian determinism we develop a model that can predict {{the response of the}} financial network to a shock. We also propose a way of measuring the systemic importance of the banks, which we call BankRank. Using <b>European</b> <b>Bank</b> <b>Authority</b> 2011 stress test exposure data, we apply our model to the bipartite network connecting the largest institutional debt holders of the troubled European countries (Greece, Italy, Portugal, Spain, and Ireland). From simulating our model we can determine whether a network is in a "stable" state in which shocks do not cause major losses, or a "unstable" state in which devastating damages occur. Fitting the parameters of the model, which play the role of physical coupling constants, to Eurozone crisis data shows that before the Eurozone crisis the system was mostly in a "stable" regime, and that during the crisis it transitioned into an "unstable" regime. The numerical solutions produced by our model match closely the actual time-line of events of the crisis. We also find that, while the largest holders are usually more important, in the unstable regime smaller holders also exhibit systemic importance. Our model also proves useful for determining the vulnerability of banks and assets to shocks. This suggests that our model may be a useful tool for simulating the response dynamics of shared portfolio networks...|$|R

A lesson from major past crises is that the drag on growth will persist until the most fragile banks are openly identified and fixed. Such a process always requires great political will. In Europe, the challenge is compounded by institutional mismatch, namely the combination of a largely integrated market with national supervisory structures. Because of cross-border linkages, national approaches cannot be expected to deliver the necessary unbiased results...|$|R
