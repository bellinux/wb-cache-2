40|$|The {{structural}} response of active skeletal muscle {{is derived from}} a combination of sarcomere contraction properties, collagen fibres in the connective tissue, and incompressibility. The role of collagen tissues could be substantial but is still not completely understood. Only few studies have looked into the functionality of collagen reorientation within connective tissues during contraction. The objective {{of this paper is to}} propose a discrete static micro-mechanical model to study the sensitivity of kinematic properties of skeletal muscle depending on <b>initial</b> <b>braiding</b> <b>angle</b> of the endomysium lattice and the stiffness of collagen fibers. Two models are developed, first a hexagonally shaped single muscle fibre surrounded by connective tissue, and second, a fascicle model encompassing a single fiber surrounded by neighbouring fibres on all sides with their portion of connective tissue. Connective tissue is modelled in a crossed-helical setup of tension-only elements. Contraction is simulated by pretensioned 'sarcomere' spring elements that follow the muscle force-length relationship. the model calculates displacements, forces, pressures and work developed as a result of contraction. The most important conclusion of the model is that the contribution of <b>braiding</b> <b>angle</b> and collagen stiffness can be considered very important. For a sufficiently small angle, the observed model behaviour can solely be attributed to sarcomere properties. When the orientation angle is increased, the passive properties of the myofascia start playing a larger role. The model response then becomes very much influenced by a pressure term that is induced by stretch in the collagen acting on the incompressible muscle. Although validation methods are limited, the model results are promising and further research is encouraged. Mechanical, Maritime and Materials EngineeringBiomechanical Engineerin...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, I {{present the}} design, {{fabrication}} and characterization of fully soft pneumatic artificial muscles (PAMs) with low threshold pressures that {{are intended for}} direct cardiac compression (DCC). McKibben type PAMs typically have a threshold pressure of at least lOOkPa and require rigid end fittings which may damage soft tissue and cause local stress concentrations, and thus failure points in the actuator. The actuator design I present is a variant on the McKibben PAM with the following key differences: the nylon mesh {{is embedded in the}} elastomeric tube, and closure {{of the end of the}} tube is achieved without rigid ends. The actuators were tested to investigate the effects of mesh geometry and elastomer material on force output, contraction, and rise time. Lower <b>initial</b> <b>braid</b> <b>angles</b> and softer elastomer materials provided the best force, contraction, and rise times; Up to 50 N of force, 24 % contraction, and response times of 0. 05 s were achieved at 100 kPa. The actuators exhibited low threshold pressures (< 5 kPa) and high rupture pressures (138 kPa - 720 kPa) which suggest safe operation for the DCC application. These results demonstrate that the actuators can achieve forces, displacements, and rise times suitable to assist with cardiac function. by Steven Obiajulu. Thesis (S. B.)

40|$|Circular overbraiding of {{composite}} preforms on complex mandrels currently lacks automatic {{generation of}} machine control data. To solve this limitation, an inverse kinematics-based procedure {{was designed and}} implemented for circular braiding machines with optional guide rings, resulting in a take-up speed profile for a given <b>braid</b> <b>angle</b> distribution on mandrels with complex 3 D shapes including non-axisymmetric, optionally eccentric cross-sections that can vary in shape and size along an optionally curved mandrel centerline, allowing a curved machine movement. This procedure reduces the problem size, resulting in a short computation time, fit for CAE process chain integration. Numerical control data was generated for a complex mandrel with a specified <b>braid</b> <b>angle</b> and a triaxial braid. A simulation using this control data yields a <b>braid</b> <b>angle</b> that deviates a few degrees from the specified <b>braid</b> <b>angle.</b> The simulation was validated experimentally, using the generated instructions to control the braiding machine. This showed a deviation from the simulated <b>braid</b> <b>angle</b> of 3 <b>degrees</b> in the centered, non-tapered mandrel regions, up to 10 degrees in tapered regions and an experimental scatter of 7 degrees. The deviation is mainly attributed {{to the neglect of}} yarn interaction and guide ring contact friction in the model, leading to an incorrectly modeled convergence zone length...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: The stress {{distribution}} in braided composites is complex even for simple uniaxial loading. The interlacing of the tows creates a complex load path {{that results in}} full three-dimensional (3 D) {{stress distribution}}. The location and magnitude of peak stresses depend on the particular stress component and vary with various braid architecture parameters such as <b>braid</b> <b>angle</b> and <b>degree</b> of waviness. Finite element analyzes for different braids were performed and it was seen that the peak stresses in the tow mainly occur at the undulating region and {{along the edges of}} the tow. Stress distribution in braids was compared with those in ‘equivalent laminates’. A considerable volume of the tow (10 – 45 % for the considered range of parameters) had stresses larger than an ‘equivalent lamina’. The severity of stresses in a braid as compared to those in an equivalent lamina depends upon braid geometric parameters. <b>Braid</b> <b>angle</b> changes the stress distribution in the tow considerably. However, most of that effect is due to the orientation of the tows in the þ and directions and can be eliminated by matching the loading on the tow of different braids. The severity of peak stresses seems to be increasing linearly with an increase in waviness ratio. KEY WORDS: textile composites, stress analysis, braids, finite element modeling...|$|R
40|$|Braided fabrics {{are often}} used to {{reinforce}} composite mate-rials. An advantage of braided fabrics is that the <b>braiding</b> <b>angle</b> can be changed.

30|$|It can be {{seen that}} the take-up speed {{affected}} the final shape of the braid. The higher υtu, the lower the <b>braid</b> <b>angle.</b> However, when using only one cylinder to model a multifilament yarn, it appears that α was only slightly affected by the take-up speed. Although the difference in <b>braid</b> <b>angle</b> between model “E/ 1 ” and the real braid was negligible, the difference in α for the lowest take-up speed was as high as 23.3 ∘. Increasing the number of cylinders from one to three, an improved correlation was seen between the simulations and the experimental results. For the smallest υtu, the <b>braid</b> <b>angle</b> determined for model “A/ 3 ” was 25.43 ∘. Although the difference in <b>braid</b> <b>angle</b> between the virtual and the real braid was as high as 13.67 ∘, a noticeable improvement with respect to the previous case was achieved as far as the <b>braid</b> <b>angle</b> is concerned. Increasing the take-up speed, the difference between the calculated <b>braid</b> <b>angle</b> for virtual <b>braids</b> and the <b>braid</b> <b>angle</b> of a real braid decreased. On the other hand, it must be emphasised that the running time of X/ 3 simulations was more than double the time required to complete the X/ 1 simulations (23 h compared to 51 h). Increasing the number of cylinders used to model a multifilament yarn to seven, the computational time increased to 113 h. Although the use of seven cylinders to model the real yarn did not lead to a significant difference in terms of <b>braid</b> <b>angle</b> with respect to the previous X/ 1 and X/ 3 models for high take-up speeds, a better correlation between the simulations and the experimental results was found for small υtu. The difference in the <b>braid</b> <b>angle</b> between the virtual and the real braid was as low as 7.54 ∘ for υtu= 63 mm/min. The apparent irregular braid shapes for models X/ 7 are due solely to the bad rendering of the prisms shaped around the beam elements (Fig.  8 c).|$|R

The effect of notch size and notch position were investigated. Damage initiation and propagation in notched and unnotched coupons were also examined. Theory developed {{to predict the}} normal stress distribution near an open hole and failure for tape laminated composites was evaluated for its applicability to 2 D triaxial braided textile composite materials. Four different fiber architectures were considered; <b>braid</b> <b>angle,</b> yarn and braider size, percentage of longitudinal yarns and braider angle varied. Tape laminates equivalent to textile composites were also constructed for comparison. Unnotched tape equivalents were stronger than braided textiles but exhibited greater notch sensitivity. Notched textiles and tape equivalents have roughly the same strength at large notch sizes. Two common damage mechanisms were found: braider yarn cracking and near notch longitudinal yarn splitting.
