25|$|JPEG's lossy {{compression}} also suffers from <b>generation</b> <b>loss,</b> where repeatedly decoding and re-encoding an image {{to save it}} again causes a loss of information each time, degrading the image. This does not happen with repeated viewing or copying, {{but only if the}} file is edited and saved over again. Because PNG is lossless, it is suitable for storing images to be edited. While PNG is reasonably efficient when compressing photographic images, there are lossless compression formats designed specifically for photographic images, lossless WebP and Adobe DNG (digital negative) for example. However these formats are either not widely supported, or are proprietary. An image can be stored losslessly and converted to JPEG format only for distribution, so that there is no <b>generation</b> <b>loss.</b>|$|E
25|$|JPEG is {{also not}} well suited to files that will undergo {{multiple}} edits, as some image quality will usually be lost each time the image is decompressed and recompressed, particularly if the image is cropped or shifted, or if encoding parameters are changed– see digital <b>generation</b> <b>loss</b> for details. To avoid this, an image that is being modified or may be modified in the future can be saved in a lossless format, with a copy exported as JPEG for distribution.|$|E
500|$|For {{fifteen years}} Nolan {{had wanted to}} shoot in the IMAX format, and he also used it for [...] "quiet scenes which pictorially we thought would be interesting." [...] The use of IMAX cameras {{provided}} many new challenges for the filmmakers: the cameras were much larger and heavier than standard cameras, and produced noise which made recording dialogue difficult. In addition, the cameras had short film loads ranging from 30 seconds to two minutes {{and the cost of}} the film stock was much greater than standard 35mm film. Nevertheless, Nolan said that he wished that it were possible to shoot the entire film in IMAX: [...] "if you could take an IMAX camera to Mount Everest or outer space, you could use it in a feature movie." [...] In addition, Nolan chose to edit some of the IMAX sequences using the original camera negative, which by eliminating <b>generation</b> <b>loss,</b> raised the film resolution of those sequences up to 18 thousand lines.|$|E

40|$|Network {{emulation}} has for a {{long time}} been an important tool for evaluating the performance of communication pro-tocols. By emulating network characteristics, such as re-stricted bandwidth, delay and losses, knowledge about the behavior and performance of actual protocol implementa-tions can be obtained. This paper focuses on the gener-ation of losses in network emulators and shows the ben-ecial effects of being able to control the <b>generation</b> of <b>losses</b> in a precise way. Both the possibility to get addi-tional knowledge about a protocol implementations behav-ior, as well as statistical benets such as paired experiments are discussed. By extending the <b>loss</b> <b>generation</b> to also in-clude bit-error generation, in addition to packet losses, a ner level of abstraction is provided.

2500|$|Aside {{from the}} energy generation, {{hydrogen}} production could be centralized, distributed or {{a mixture of}} both. While generating hydrogen at centralized primary energy plants promises higher hydrogen production efficiency, difficulties in high-volume, long range hydrogen transportation (due to factors such as [...] hydrogen damage and the ease of hydrogen diffusion through solid materials) makes electrical energy distribution attractive within a hydrogen economy. In such a scenario, small regional plants or even local filling stations could generate hydrogen using energy provided through the electrical distribution grid. While hydrogen generation efficiency {{is likely to be}} lower than for centralized hydrogen <b>generation,</b> <b>losses</b> in hydrogen transport could make such a scheme more efficient in terms of the primary energy used per kilogram of hydrogen delivered to the end user.|$|R

40|$|In {{the current}} paper we analyze several methods for <b>generation</b> of <b>loss</b> {{distribution}} for credit portfolios.

A loss distribution is a function of the number of entities in the portfolio, their credit ratings, the notional amount and recovery of each entity, default probabilities, loss given defaults, and the correlation/dependence structure between entities incorporated in the portfolio. Direct <b>generation</b> of <b>loss</b> distribution may require Monte Carlo simulation which is time consuming and is not effective when applied for credit portfolio optimization.
