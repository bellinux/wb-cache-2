5|$|To the reader: {{whoever you}} are, your fears that this small clod of earth lies {{heavily on the}} buried Mercator are groundless; the whole Earth is no burden {{for a man who}} had the whole weight of her lands on his {{shoulders}} and carried <b>her</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> Atlas.|$|E
5|$|After the United States {{declared}} war on Germany in April 1917, El Sol was requisitioned by the United States Shipping Board (USSB) {{on behalf of the}} United States Army, who designated <b>her</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> animal transport ship. Although there is no information about the specific conversion of El Sol, for other ships this typically meant that any second- or third-class passenger accommodations had to be ripped out and replaced with ramps and stalls for the horses and mules carried.|$|E
50|$|Sarah Eckford Drake, the student's young widow, {{was left}} with their daughter. She showed {{interest}} in having Halleck <b>as</b> <b>her</b> second husband. His satires included <b>her</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> figure, and in one he referred to <b>her</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> witch. She died young in 1828. Halleck never married.|$|R
5000|$|The Metro {{described}} <b>her</b> <b>as</b> [...] "foxy, image-crazed Alisha" [...] while Orange described <b>her</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> [...] "super sexy delinquent". The Daily Telegraph describes <b>her</b> <b>as</b> being <b>a</b> [...] "party girl" [...] with The Herald similarly describing <b>her</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> [...] "Slutty party girl". The Times described <b>her</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> [...] "cheeky {{young woman}} who has a voracious sexual appetite". Tim Dowling of The Guardian described <b>her</b> <b>as</b> the [...] "slutty one" [...] {{of the group of}} [...] "foul-mouthed young criminals". MSN News described Alisha's power saying Alisha [...] "realises this is more of a curse than <b>a</b> blessing <b>as</b> she can no longer touch anybody or be touched without them clambering all over her, trying to take their clothes off".|$|R
5000|$|Chorpenning died on January 7, 1955, at {{her home}} in Warwick, NY. The {{obituary}} published in the Educational Theatre Journal stated [...] "The American theatre is indebted to her for <b>her</b> skill <b>as</b> <b>a</b> playwright, <b>her</b> ability <b>as</b> <b>a</b> teacher, <b>her</b> strength <b>as</b> <b>a</b> leader, and <b>her</b> humanity <b>as</b> <b>a</b> friend." ...|$|R
5|$|From the Goebbels Diaries, {{researchers}} {{learned that}} Riefenstahl had been friendly with Joseph Goebbels {{and his wife}} Magda, attending the opera with them and going to his parties. Riefenstahl maintained that Goebbels was upset when she rejected his advances and was jealous of her influence on Hitler, seeing <b>her</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> internal threat. She therefore insisted his diary entries could not be trusted. By later accounts, Goebbels thought highly of Riefenstahl's filmmaking but was angered with {{what he saw as}} her overspending on the Nazi-provided filmmaking budgets.|$|E
5|$|Haunting Ground {{was first}} {{revealed}} in September 2004, {{and was released}} next April garnering mixed to average reviews. The graphics and presentation were praised, but critics found the gameplay somewhat repetitive, predictable, and derivative of previous horror titles. The sexual objectification of Fiona was highlighted by some critics {{as one of the}} game's best elements. They found that by illustrating <b>her</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> object of desire, the game makes Fiona and therefore the player feel more fragile and endangered, building a more disturbing atmosphere. The fluctuating degree of player control over Fiona has made Haunting Ground a key subject in the study of avatars and their relationship with players in video games.|$|E
5|$|In 1974 Jacques' {{sons were}} arrested for {{possession}} of cannabis, and her house was searched by police. In the same week that the two boys appeared in court, she received official notification of the intention to appoint <b>her</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> OBE. In order to protect her sons from further press intrusion she declined the honour. Later that year, while filming the third series of Sykes, she suffered a cancer scare and lost {{a considerable amount of}} weight. Despite this she refused to interrupt the busy production schedule; when filming was completed on 5 December she underwent surgery at Charing Cross Hospital for what proved to be benign tumours on her kidneys.|$|E
25|$|Besides {{her place}} of birth, {{not much else}} is known about de Romieu; her occupation, {{education}} and background {{vary according to the}} source.

5|$|In November 1990, Michael Schiavo took Terri to the University of California, San Francisco for {{experimental}} nerve stimulation with a thalamic stimulator. The treatment took several months and was unsuccessful. He returned to Florida {{with her in}} January 1991 and admitted <b>her</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> inpatient to the Mediplex Rehabilitation Center in Bradenton, Florida. On July 19, 1991, Terri Schiavo {{was transferred to the}} Sabal Palms Skilled Care Facility, where she received neurological testing and regular speech and occupational therapy until 1994. In mid-1993, Michael Schiavo requested a do not resuscitate order for her after she contracted a urinary tract infection.|$|E
5|$|In November 2003, Woods became {{engaged to}} Elin Nordegren, a Swedish former model and {{daughter}} of former minister of migration Barbro Holmberg and radio journalist Thomas Nordegren. They were introduced during The Open Championship in 2001 by Swedish golfer Jesper Parnevik, who had employed <b>her</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> au pair. They married on October 5, 2004, at the Sandy Lane resort in Barbados, and lived at Isleworth, {{a community in}} Windermere, a suburb of Orlando, Florida. In 2006, they purchased a $39-million estate in Jupiter Island, Florida, and began constructing a 10,000-square-foot home; Woods moved there in 2010 following the couple's divorce.|$|E
5|$|In popular memory, Tamar's {{image has}} {{acquired}} a legendary and romantic façade. A diverse set of folk songs, poems and tales illustrate <b>her</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> ideal ruler, a holy woman onto whom certain attributes of pagan deities and Christian saints were sometimes projected. For example, in an old Ossetian legend, Queen Tamar conceives her son of a sunbeam which shines through the window. Another myth, from the Georgian mountains, equates Tamar with the pagan deity of weather, Pirimze, who controls winter. Similarly, in the highland district of Pshavi, Tamar's image fused with a pagan goddess of healing and female fertility.|$|E

5000|$|Lilith : A woman created before Eve, {{according}} to a Hebrew document. Dante Gabriel Rossetti imagined <b>her</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> snake in Eden Bower and the similarity of her name with the Hebrew layil or night produced the Middle Age idea of <b>her</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> creature of the night.|$|R
5|$|Later in 2010, Trenyce {{joined the}} Michael Jackson tribute concert revue Thriller – Live {{as the leading}} female vocalist during a European tour. She reprised her role when the show played at the Lyric Theatre in London's West End. She starred in the concert for three years, from 2010 until 2013, {{performing}} material from different periods in Jackson's career. In an interview with The Hollywood Reporter, Trenyce said that the audience was initially hesitant to hear a woman interpret Jackson's music. Theatreworld's Geoff Billingsley praised Trenyce's performance, writing that her voice sounded very similar to Jackson's and describing <b>her</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> improvement over the previous female lead Cleo Higgins.|$|E
5|$|Mayawati's tenure has {{attracted}} praise and controversy. Many Scheduled Caste in India view <b>her</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> icon, and refer {{to her as}} Behen-ji (sister). She has been praised for her fundraising {{efforts on behalf of}} her party and her birthdays have been widely celebrated by her supporters. The rise in her personal wealth and that of her party have been criticised as indicative of corruption.|$|E
5|$|Potter's {{adolescence}} was a {{quiet as}} her childhood. She grew into a spinsterish young woman whose parents groomed {{her to be a}} permanent resident and housekeeper in their home. She wanted to lead a useful life independent of her parents and considered a career in mycology, but the all-male scientific community regarded <b>her</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> amateur and she abandoned fungi. She continued to paint and draw, and experienced her first professional artistic success in 1890 when she sold six designs of humanised animals to a greeting card publisher.|$|E

5|$|She {{decided to}} become a model when she was 18. She signed with a models agency that sent her to Japan, but after several failed auditions, she {{returned}} to Sydney. There, she was hired to work in advertising for a department store, that exposed her to the attention of Follow Me, a magazine which hired <b>her</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> assistant fashion editor. A casual invitation to participate in a drama workshop inspired Watts to quit her job and to pursue her acting ambitions.|$|E
5|$|Shirotsuki {{is a very}} skilled wizard {{who took}} Hibiki into his home {{in order to train}} <b>her</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> {{assistant}} to his craft. Despite Hibiki's constant failures, Shirotsuki never gets angry with her and lets her take her time to get it right. He had been in love with a young woman his age named Yui, but had sacrificed his memories of her and his loved ones for his magic.|$|E
5|$|Soraya {{is a young}} Afghan {{woman whom}} Amir meets and marries in the United States. Hosseini {{originally}} scripted the character as an American woman, but he later agreed to rewrite <b>her</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> Afghan immigrant after his editor did not find her background believable {{for her role in}} the story. The change contributed towards an extensive revision of Part III. In the final draft, Soraya lives with her parents, Afghan general Taheri and his wife, and wants to become an English teacher. Before meeting Amir, she ran away with an Afghan boyfriend in Virginia, which, according to Afghan tradition, made her unsuitable for marriage. Because Amir also had his own regrets, he loves and marries her anyway.|$|E
50|$|The song {{tells the}} story of a woman {{reflecting}} on how her father and God have loved her always. She connects this to how she intends to raise her son.

5|$|Without a role or rank, Kulikovsky brooded in Denmark, {{becoming}} moody and listless. A spinal injury sustained {{during the}} war, {{for which he}} had to wear a corset, remained unhealed. In 1925, Kulikovsky accompanied his wife to a Berlin nursing home to meet Anna Anderson, who claimed to be Olga's niece, Grand Duchess Anastasia Nikolaevna of Russia. According to Harriet von Rathlef, who witnessed the meeting, while Olga and Anderson conversed, he sat in a corner and sulked. Although Olga felt sympathy for Anderson, if only because she was ill, she eventually denounced <b>her</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> impostor. Possibly, she was pressured to do so by Kulikovsky and Dowager Empress Marie.|$|E
5|$|Wong's {{image and}} career {{have left a}} notable legacy. Through her films, public {{appearances}} and prominent magazine features, she helped to humanize Asian Americans to white audiences {{during a period of}} overt racism and discrimination. Asian Americans, especially the Chinese, had been viewed as perpetually foreign in U.S. society but Wong's films and public image established <b>her</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> Asian-American citizen at a time when laws discriminated against Asian immigration and citizenship. Wong's hybrid image dispelled contemporary notions that the East and West were inherently different.|$|E
5|$|According to William of Malmesbury, Æthelstan {{was thirty}} {{years old when he}} came to the throne in 924, which would mean that he was born in about 894. He was the oldest son of Edward the Elder and also the tallest. He was Edward's only son by his first consort, Ecgwynn. Very little is known about Ecgwynn, and she is not named in any pre-Conquest source. Medieval chroniclers gave varying {{descriptions}} of her rank: one described <b>her</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> ignoble consort of inferior birth, while others described her birth as noble. Modern historians also disagree about her status. Simon Keynes and Richard Abels believe that leading figures in Wessex were unwilling to accept Æthelstan as king in 924 partly because his mother had been Edward the Elder's concubine. However, Barbara Yorke and Sarah Foot argue that allegations that Æthelstan was illegitimate were a product of the dispute over the succession, and that there is no reason to doubt that she was Edward's legitimate wife. She may have been related to St Dunstan.|$|E
