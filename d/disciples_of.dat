5|$|Under the Armory System, a character's {{equipped}} weapon or crafting tool, {{determines the}} player's character class, {{allowing them to}} switch roles at will. Some classes {{are associated with a}} particular starting point. Classes are divided into four disciplines: <b>Disciples</b> <b>of</b> War, masters of physical combat; <b>Disciples</b> <b>of</b> Magic, practitioners of the magical arts; <b>Disciples</b> <b>of</b> the Hand, crafters and handymen who synthesize and repair items; and <b>Disciples</b> <b>of</b> the Land, gatherers who collect resources from the environment. Certain abilities learned under one class may be equipped and used by other classes. The Job System (a post-launch addition) builds upon the Armoury System for <b>Disciples</b> <b>of</b> War and Magic. In exchange for restricting the range of equippable abilities from other classes, players gain access to powerful skills, magic, weapons, and armor exclusive to the Job corresponding to that class. These Jobs, based on classic Final Fantasy character jobs, are more suited to party-based combat.|$|E

5|$|The {{mechanics}} of crafting and gathering have changed between the original release and A Realm Reborn. Most {{of these changes}} are geared toward reducing the randomness and guesswork involved in these processes. For <b>Disciples</b> <b>of</b> the Hand, all recipes of the appropriate level are unlocked by default in the Crafting Log. Crafting abilities have been rebalanced to allow successful high-quality synthesis without requiring multiple mastered Disciplines of the Hand. For <b>Disciples</b> <b>of</b> the Land, players are allowed to select which item {{they would like to}} attempt to collect at a gathering point, whereas before, the results of gathering attempts were randomized. The Gathering Log also displays the names and locations of items that can be gathered in the world.|$|E

5|$|According to Pentecostal biblical interpretation, the Gospel of John 20:22 {{shows that}} the <b>disciples</b> <b>of</b> Jesus were already born again before the Holy Spirit fell at Pentecost.

In following the biblical pattern, they argue, Christians today should also pray for this baptism which results in greater power for ministry and witness.|$|E

Speaking in Parliament, he likened the adoption of foreign rule to the Phanariote period. The opposition was nevertheless weak, and the resolution was passed with a large majority.|$|E

5|$|Hippocrates is {{credited}} with being {{the first person to}} believe that diseases were caused naturally, not because of superstition and gods.

Indeed {{there is not a single}} mention of a mystical illness in the entirety of the Hippocratic Corpus. However, Hippocrates did work with many convictions that were based on what is now known to be incorrect anatomy and physiology, such as Humorism.|$|E

It is extremely unlikely that he wrote that text—some scholars attribute it to Nikiphoros the Monk, while others believe it was written by <b>disciples</b> <b>of</b> Symeon.|$|E
5|$|After {{a period}} within the sangha, Koṇḍañña retired to the Himalayas {{for the last}} twelve years of his life. This is {{attributed}} to two reasons in Buddhist literature. The first reason was that Koṇḍañña considered his presence {{to be a source}} of inconvenience for Sariputra and Moggallana, the two chief <b>disciples</b> <b>of</b> The Buddha. As the seniormost member of the sangha, Koṇḍañña lead the monks on the alms-round, but during dharma talks, the two chief disciples sat on either side of the Buddha and Koṇḍañña behind them. The two chief disciples were uncomfortable sitting in front of Koṇḍañña, so he decided to solve the problem by absenting himself. The other reason to which Koṇḍañña's leave is attributed was to spend more quiet time in religious practice, which was rendered difficult due to the attention that the sangha gained from the public.|$|E
5|$|Between 1808 and 1812 {{another group}} of ascetic Jews, known as Perushim, immigrated to Palestine from Lithuania.

They were worried, however, that {{descendants}} of the Arab creditors still held the old promissory notes relating to the century-old debts incurred by he-Hasid's followers and that a new group of Ashkenazic immigrants would possibly inherit responsibility for repayment. The descendants of a group of Hasidim who made aliyah in 1777 also presented a problem. They apparently objected to any effort by the Perushim {{to take control of the}} synagogue ruin, claiming it had never belonged to the Perushim or their ancestors. The Hasidim claimed they had closer ties with the original owners and that their rights to the parcel of land were greater.|$|E
