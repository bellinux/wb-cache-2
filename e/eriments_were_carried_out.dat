Exp <b>eriments</b> <b>were</b> <b>carried</b> <b>out</b> as function of contact time, pH (2 - 10) and temperature (293, 303, 313 and 323 K). Adsorption isotherms were modeled with the Langmuir and Freundlich isotherms. The data fitte d {{well with the}} Langmuir isotherm. The Langmuir monolayer saturation capacities of MB adsorbed onto activated carbon were 501. 32, 534. 54, 588. 30 and 593. 28 mg/g at 293, 303, 313, and 323 K, respect ively. The kinetic models were also studied. The rates of adsorption were found {{to conform to the}} pseu do-second-order kinetics with good correlation. Using the equilibrium concentration contents obtained at different temperatures, various thermodynamic parameters, such as△G, △H and△S, have been calc ulated. The thermodynamics parameters of system indicated spontaneous and endothermic process...|$|E

40|$|Aim: To {{improve the}} results of {{treatment}} of patients with emergency surgical pathology by {{the analysis of the}} use of videolaparoscopic surgical interventions. Methods: in the period 2012 – 2014 year in MI “Zaporozhye municipal clinical hospital of emergency” in the first surgical department on the base of subdepartment “General surgery with care for patients” of Zaporozhye state medical university <b>were</b> <b>carried</b> <b>out</b> 791 videolaparoscopic surgical interventions. 508 (64, 2 %) women, 283 (35, 8 %) men. The mean age of patients was 48 ± 2, 1. The most videolaparoscopic operations <b>were</b> <b>carried</b> <b>out</b> at the acute appendicitis– 359 (45, 5 %). Laparoscopic cholecystectomy at the acute cholecystitis <b>was</b> <b>carried</b> <b>out</b> in 157 patients (19, 9 %). At the acute commissural intestinal obstruction <b>were</b> <b>carried</b> <b>out</b> 8 videolaparoscopic operations – (1 %). Videolaparoscopic drainage of abdominal cavity at the acute pancreatitis <b>was</b> <b>carried</b> <b>out</b> in 79 patients (10 %). At gynecological pathology <b>were</b> <b>carried</b> <b>out</b> 162 videolaparoscopic surgical interventions (20, 6 %) and in 26 patients (3, 1 %) was done diagnostic videolaparoscopy. Result: At the acute appendicitis <b>were</b> <b>carried</b> <b>out</b> 359 (45, 5 %) videolaparoscopic surgical interventions. There were no complications in postsurgical period. The mean bed-day was 6, 8 ± 0, 7. Videolaparoscopy at the acute cholecistitis <b>was</b> <b>carried</b> <b>out</b> in 157 patients (19, 9 %). In 17 (10, 8 %) <b>was</b> <b>carried</b> <b>out</b> conversion and surgical intervention was continued from laparotory access. At the commissure intestinal obstruction <b>were</b> <b>carried</b> <b>out</b> 8 surgical interventions (1, 0 %). All patients underwent surgery after the short-term pre-surgical preparation. Conversion <b>was</b> <b>carried</b> <b>out</b> in 2 patients (25 %). In 1 (12, 5 %) was injured the loop of small intestine and in 1 (12, 5 %) took place the total commissure disease in abdominal cavity. Diagnostic laparoscopy <b>was</b> <b>carried</b> <b>out</b> in 26 patients (3, 1 %), in two of them – at the close blunt trauma of the stomach. Videolaparoscopic drainage of abdominal cavity at the acute pancreatitis <b>was</b> <b>carried</b> <b>out</b> in 79 patients (10 %). In 28 patients (35, 4 %) along with drainage of abdominal cavity <b>was</b> <b>carried</b> <b>out</b> the laparoscopic cholecystectomy (concrements in gallbladder). Conclusions: Videolaparoscopic surgical interventions in emergency surgery allow <b>carry</b> <b>out</b> the more qualitative diagnostics and significantly diminish the risk of postsurgical complications. The minimal surgical trauma allows activate patients in the early postsurgical period, shorten the terms of stay at hospital and improve the life quality.
