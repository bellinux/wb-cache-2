30|$|The {{advanced}} remanufacturing-to-order (ARTO) system deliberated on in {{this study}} is a product recovery system. A discrete-event simulation model was developed from the view of remanufacturer for remanufactured items sold with one-dimensional non-renewing Money-back <b>Guarantee</b> <b>warranty</b> policy, in which, an End-Of-Life product is subjected to preventive maintenance action when the remaining life of the product reaches a pre-specified value so that the remanufacturer’s expected profit can be maximized. Experiments were designed using Taguchi’s Orthogonal Arrays to represent the full recovery system and observe their behavior under different experimental conditions. In order {{to assess the impact of}} warranty and preventive maintenance on remanufacturer total cost, pairwise t tests were carried out along with one-way analyses of variance (ANOVA) and Tukey pairwise comparisons test for each performance measure of the ARTO system.|$|E
40|$|Direct {{marketing}} is witnessing explosive growth. As consumers increasingly purchase products from their homes, {{their ability to}} judge the quality of products they buy is significantly reduced. In this paper we study how money-back guarantees can signal product quality in such environments. We interpret product quality broadly to mean both the level of attributes promised {{as well as the}} firm's consistency in delivering on those promises. Key aspects of our formulation are the explicit consideration of transaction costs, and alternative signals of product quality. Transaction costs are the costs the seller or buyer faces when redeeming a money-back guarantee. We show that money-back guarantees signal quality by exploiting the higher probability of returns for a lower quality product, and the attendant higher transaction costs. However, if the seller's transaction costs are very large, then there are less costly ways to signal, namely charging a high price. We compare the signaling performance of (1) price, (2) price with uninformative advertising, and (3) price with a money-back guarantee. Whereas uninformative advertising does not work at all in our model, under certain conditions a money-back guarantee is necessary to signal, and under other conditions, a money-back guarantee is a useful supplement to price. money back <b>guarantee,</b> <b>warranty,</b> signaling quality, transaction costs, separating equilibrium...|$|E
