40|$|The {{immunomodulatory}} and epithelial barrier {{effects of}} cellulose as a dietary fibre were studied to analyse {{the potential for}} use in health promoting functional foods. Reporter assays demonstrated cellulose-mediated activation through TLR/MyD 88 dependent-, and independent pathways. Microchip analysis of human PBMCs showed that cellulose induced upregulation of three NF-kappa B related genes, i. e. CD 40 molecule, interleukin 1 receptor antagonist (IL- 1 Ra), and interleukin- 1 receptor-associated kinase 1 (IRAK 1). Five upregulated genes related specifically to TLR signalling were identified, i. e. interleukin 1 receptor antagonist (IL- 1 Ra), interleukin- 1 receptor-associated kinase 1 (IRAK 1), jun proto-oncogene, mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase 3 (MAP 2 K 3), and mitogen-activated protein kinase 13 (MAPK 13). Cellulose did not <b>affect</b> <b>T</b> 84 intestinal epithelial cell resistance. Cellulose does not <b>directly</b> <b>affect</b> <b>T</b> 84 cell barrier function. However, it alters gene expression in human immune cells and activates TLR and non-TLR related pattern recognition pathways, indicating the immunomodulatory potential of cellulose as major component of root pulp byproduct.

40|$|The {{capacity}} {{of the immune system}} to adapt to rapidly evolving viruses is a primary feature of effective immunity, yet its molecular basis is unclear. Here, we investigated protective HIV- 1 -specific CD 8 + T cell responses directed against the immunodominant p 24 Gag-derived epitope KK 10 (KRWIILGLNK 263 - 272) presented by human leukocyte antigen (HLA) -B∗ 2705. We found that cross-reactive CD 8 + T cell clonotypes were mobilized to counter the rapid emergence of HIV- 1 variants that can <b>directly</b> <b>affect</b> <b>T</b> cell receptor (TCR) recognition. These newly recruited clonotypes expressed TCRs that engaged wild-type and mutant KK 10 antigens with similar affinities and almost identical docking modes, thereby accounting for their antiviral efficacy in HLA-B∗ 2705 + individuals. A protective CD 8 + T cell repertoire therefore encompasses the capacity to control TCR-accessible mutations, ultimately driving the development of more complex viral escape variants that disrupt antigen presentation...|$|R
40|$|Embryonic {{stem cells}} (ESCs) possess immune privileged {{properties}} {{and have the}} capacity to modulate immune activation. However, the mechanisms by which ESCs inhibit immune activation remain mostly unknown. We have previously shown that ESC-derived factors block dendritic cell maturation, thereby indirectly <b>affecting</b> <b>T</b> cell activation. Here, we show that ESC-derived factors also <b>directly</b> <b>affect</b> <b>T</b> cell activation. We provide the first demonstration that ESC-derived factors significantly down-regulated the expressions of IL- 2 and IFN-γ, while markedly up-regulating the expression of IL- 10, TGF-β, and Treg transcription factor Foxp 3 in CD 4 + CD 25 + T cells. Furthermore, ESC-derived factors robustly suppressed T cell proliferation in response to the protein kinase C-θ (PKC-θ) activator phorbol 12 -myristate 13 -acetate (PMA). Western blot analysis indicated that ESC-derived factors prevented PKC-θ phosphorylation without influencing total PKC-θ levels. Moreover, IκB-α degradation was abrogated, confirming absence of PKC-θ activity. The impact of ESC-derived factors on PKC-θ activation appeared to be specific since other upstream T cell signaling components were not affected. In conclusion, ESCs appear to directly impact T cell activation and polarization by negatively regulating the PKC-θ pathway...|$|R
40|$|T cell {{development}} and activation are highly regulated processes, and their proper execution {{is important for}} a competent immune system. Shc SH 2 -domain binding protein- 1 (Shcbp 1) is an evolutionarily conserved protein that binds to the adaptor protein ShcA. Studies in Drosophila and in cell lines have strongly linked Shcbp 1 to cell proliferation, embryonic development, growth factor signaling, and tumorigenesis. Here we show that Shcbp 1 expression is strikingly upregulated during the b-selection checkpoint in thymocytes, and that its expression tightly correlates with proliferative stages of T cell development. To evaluate the role for Shcbp 1 during thymic selection and T cell function in vivo, we generated mice with global and conditional deletion of Shcbp 1. Surprisingly, the loss of Shcbp 1 expression {{did not have an}} obvious effect during T cell development. However, in a mouse model of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), which depends on CD 4 + T cell function and mimics multiple features of the human disease multiple sclerosis, Shcbp 1 deficient mice had reduced disease severity and improved survival, and this effect was T cell intrinsic. These data suggest that despite the striking upregulation of Shcbp 1 during T cell proliferation, loss of Shcbp 1 does not <b>directly</b> <b>affect</b> <b>T</b> cell development, bu...|$|R
40|$|The Toll-like receptors (TLR) {{have been}} {{advocated}} as attractive therapeutic targets because TLR signaling plays dual roles in initiating adaptive immune responses and perpetuating inflammation. Paradoxically, repeated stimulation of bone marrow mononuclear cells with a synthetic TLR 7 ligand 9 -benzyl- 8 -hydroxy- 2 -(2 -methoxyethoxy) adenine (called 1 V 136) leads to subsequent TLR hyporesponsiveness. Further {{studies on the}} mechanism of action of this pharmacologic agent demonstrated that the TLR 7 ligand treatment depressed dendritic cell activation, but did not <b>directly</b> <b>affect</b> <b>T</b> cell function. To verify this mechanism, we utilized experimental allergic encephalitis (EAE) as an in vivo T cell dependent autoimmune model. Drug treated SJL/J mice immunized with proteolipid protein (PLP) (139 - 151) peptide had attenuated disease severity, reduced accumulation of mononuclear cells in {{the central nervous system}} (CNS), and limited demyelination, without any apparent systemic toxicity. Splenic T cells from treated mice produced less cytokines upon antigenic rechallenge. In the spinal cords of 1 V 136 -treated EAE mice, the expression of chemoattractants was also reduced, suggesting innate immune cell hyposensitization in the CNS. Indeed, systemic 1 V 136 did penetrate the CNS. These experiments indicated that repeated doses of a TLR 7 ligand may desensitize dendritic cells in lymphoid organs, leading to diminished T cell responses. This treatment strategy might be a new modality to treat T cell mediated autoimmune diseases...|$|R
40|$|Thousands of {{potentially}} antigenic peptides are encoded by an infecting pathogen; however, {{only a small}} proportion induce measurable CD 8 + T cell responses. To investigate the factors that control peptide immunogenicity, we have examined the cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) response to a previously undefined epitope (77 APQPAPENAY 86) from the BZLF 1 protein of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). This peptide binds well to two human histocompatibility leukocyte antigen (HLA) allotypes, HLA-B* 3501 and HLA-B* 3508, which differ by a single amino acid at position 156 (156 Leucine vs. 156 Arginine, respectively). Surprisingly, only individuals expressing HLA-B* 3508 show evidence of a CTL response to the 77 APQPAPENAY 86 epitope even though EBV-infected cells expressing HLA-B* 3501 process and present similar amounts of peptide for CTL recognition, suggesting that factors other than peptide presentation levels are influencing immunogenicity. Functional and structural analysis revealed marked conformational differences in the peptide, when bound to each HLA-B 35 allotype, that are dictated by the polymorphic HLA residue 156 and that <b>directly</b> <b>affected</b> <b>T</b> cell receptor recognition. These data indicate that the immunogenicity of an antigenic peptide is influenced not only by how well the peptide binds to major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules but also by its bound conformation. It also illustrates a novel mechanism through which MHC polymorphism can further diversify the immune response to infecting pathogens.

30|$|In T cells, ROS can {{be derived}} from the {{catalytic}} activity of NADPH oxidase 2 (NOX- 2), which is a catalytic subunit of phagocyte oxidase (PHOX) expressed in the plasma membrane of T cells, or from dual oxidase I (DUOX- 1), which is a cytoplasmic non-phagocytic isoform of NADPH oxidase [204, 211]. ROS can be generated from the electron transport chain of mitochondria [212, 213] as well as by lipoxygenases [214]. T cell activation is paralleled by transient generation of low, physiologically relevant levels of ROS, which facilitates activation of ROS-dependent transcription factors, NF-kB and AP- 1 [215, 216]. This oxidative signal is indispensable for T cell activation. Together with a Ca 2 + influx, it constitutes the minimal requirement for activation-induced gene expression (e.g., interleukin 2 [IL- 2], IL- 4, CD 95 ligand) [203]. In contrast to the indispensable role of low ROS levels in T cell activation, prolonged exposure to high ROS concentrations can inhibit T cell proliferation and lead to apoptosis [217]. In addition, incubation of T cells with reactive nitrogen species (RNS) such as peroxynitrite can inhibit proliferation [218]. Oxidative stress-induced modification to selective molecules involved in T cell receptor (TCR) signaling can render T cells hyporesponsive to activating stimuli [219]. The redox environment also <b>affects</b> <b>T</b> cell differentiation. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC), stimulated with a ROS generator promoted Th 2 and inhibited Th 1 differentiation [220]. Moreover, products of lipid peroxidation, such as 4 -hydroxy- 2 -nonenal (4 HNE) and malonyldialdehyde (MDA), promote differentiation towards a Th 2 phenotype [221]. Interestingly, NOX- 2 deficiency leads to differentiation towards the Th 17 lineage [222]. Since ROS can <b>affect</b> critical metabolism-related <b>T</b> cell signaling pathways such as the MAPKs and Akt pathways [204], it is not unexpected that ROS would <b>directly</b> <b>affect</b> <b>T</b> cell differentiation and function. A study of the novel mechanism of Treg-mediated suppression by extracellular redox remodeling showed that murine Tregs suppress GSH synthesis and cysteine release by DCs in a CTLA- 4 -dependent manner, leading to the oxidation of surface thiols, decrease in the major cellular antioxidant GSH, and reduced proliferation of conventional T cells [223, 224]. Vitamin C, a naturally occurring antioxidant, can facilitate demethylation of Foxp 3 enhancer and thus promote Treg generation [225].|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: Previous {{studies have}} {{suggested}} that glucocorticoid (GC) can <b>directly</b> <b>affect</b> testicular testosterone (<b>T)</b> biosynthesis by Leydig cells through a receptor-mediated mechanism. Interconversion of corticosterone (CORT), the active form in rodents, and 11 dehydroCORT, the biologically inert 11 -keto form, is catalyzed by 11 bHSD 1. This enzyme thus controls the intracellular concentration of active GC. We have postulated that elevated CORT levels resulting from stress exceed the Leydig cell’s capacity for metabolic inactivation of CORT, resulting in suppressed T production. The present study tested whether inhibition of 11 bHSD 1 in vivo, by the administration of glycyrrhetinic acid (GA), increases intracellular active GC concentration and thereby <b>affects</b> serum <b>T</b> concentration and Leydig cell T production.

40|$|Captopril, an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, {{is widely}} used in the {{treatment}} of a variety of cardiomyopathies, but its effect on autoimmune myocarditis has not been addressed experimentally. We investigated the effect of captopril on myosin-induced experimental autoimmune myocarditis. A/J mice, immunized with syngeneic cardiac myosin, were given 75 mg/L of captopril in their drinking water. Captopril dramatically reduced the incidence and severity of myocarditis, which was accom-panied by a reduction in heart weight to body weight ratio and heart weight. Captopril specifically interfered with cell-mediated immunity as myosin delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH) was reduced, while anti-myosin Ab production was not affected. Cap-topril-treated, OVA-immunized mice also exhibited a decrease in OVA DTH. In myosin-immunized, untreated mice, injection of captopril directly into the test site also suppressed myosin DTH. Interestingly, captopril did not <b>directly</b> <b>affect</b> Ag-specific <b>T</b> cell responsiveness because neither in vivo nor in vitro captopril treatment affected the proliferation, IFN- secretion, or IL- 2 secretion by Ag-stimulated cultured splenocytes. These results indicate that captopril ameliorates experimental autoimmune myocarditis and may act, at least in part, by interfering with the recruitment of cells to sites of inflammation and the local inflammatory environment.

40|$|Purpose To {{investigate}} the physical mechanisms {{associated with the}} contrast observed in neuromelanin-MRI. Methods Phantoms having different concentrations of synthetic melanins with different degrees of iron loading were examined on a 3 T scanner using relaxometry and quantitative magnetization transfer (MT). Results Concentration-dependent T 1 - and T 2 -shortening was most pronounced for the melanin pigment when combined with iron. Metal-free melanin had a negligible effect on the magnetization transfer spectra. On the contrary, the presence of iron-laden melanins resulted in a decreased magnetization transfer ratio. The presence of melanin or iron (or both) {{did not have a}} significant effect on the macromolecular content, represented by the pool size ratio. Conclusion The primary mechanism underlying contrast in neuromelanin-MRI seems to be the T 1 reduction associated with melanin-iron complexes. The macromolecular content is not significantly influenced by the presence of melanin with or without iron, and thus the MT is not <b>directly</b> <b>affected.</b> However, as <b>T</b> 1 plays a role in determining the MT-weighted signal, the magnetization transfer ratio is reduced in the presence of melanin-iron complexes. </p...|$|R
40|$|International audienceImmunotherapy is a {{promising}} new treatment for patients suffering from glioma, in particular glioblastoma multiforme (GBM). However, tumour cells use different mechanisms {{to escape the}} immune responses induced by the treatment. As many other tumours, gliomas express or secrete several immunosuppressive molecules that regulate immune cell functions. In this study, we first analysed FasL, HLA-G, IDO, PDL- 1 and TGF-beta 1, -beta 2 and -beta 3 expression by transcriptomic microarray analysis {{in a series of}} 20 GBM samples and found respectively 15 %, 60 %, 85 %, 30 %, 70 %, 80 % and 35 % of positive specimens. mRNA expression was then confirmed in 10 GBM primary cell lines and 2 immortalised cell lines U 251 and U 87 MG. Furthermore, the protein expression of PDL- 1, IDO activity and TGF-beta 2 secretion were found on most of the untreated GBM primary cell lines. Remarkably, treatment with IFN-gamma increased the PDL- 1 cell surface expression and the IDO activity, but reduced the TGF-beta 2 secretion of GBM cell lines. We finally analysed the immunosuppressive effects of IDO, PDL- 1 and TGF-beta 1 - 3 by measuring IFN-gamma production and cell cytotoxicity activity of tumour antigen-specific T cells. PDL- 1 partially affected the IFN-gamma production of antigen-specific T cells in response to GBM primary cell lines, and IDO inhibited lymphocyte proliferation induced by lectins. None of these molecules <b>directly</b> <b>affected</b> the <b>T</b> cell cytotoxicity function. Due to the functional role of PDL- 1 and IDO molecules expressed by GBM cells, one could expect that blocking these molecules in the immunotherapy strategies would reinforce the efficiency of these treatments of GBM patients...|$|R
40|$|Follicular {{dendritic}} cells (FDCs) up-regulate the chemokine receptor CXCR 4 on CD 4 T cells, {{and a major}} subpopulation of {{germinal center}} (GC) T cells (CD 4 � CD 57 �), which are adjacent to FDCs in vivo, expresses high levels of CXCR 4. We therefore reasoned that GC T cells would actively migrate to stromal cell-derived factor- 1 (CXCL 12), the CXCR 4 ligand, and tested this using Transwell migration assays with GC T cells and other CD 4 T cells (CD 57 �) that expressed much lower levels of CXCR 4. Unexpectedly, GC T cells were virtually nonresponsive to CXCL 12, whereas CD 57 � CD 4 T cells migrated efficiently despite reduced CXCR 4 expression. In contrast, GC T cells efficiently migrated to B cell chemoattractant- 1 /CXCL 13 and FDC supernatant, which contained CXCL 13 produced by FDCs. Importantly, GC T cell nonresponsiveness to CXCL 12 correlated with high ex vivo expression of regulator of G protein signaling (RGS), RGS 13 and RGS 16, mRNA and expression of protein in vivo. Furthermore, FDCs up-regulated both RGS 13 and RGS 16 mRNA expression in non-GC T cells, resulting in their impaired migration to CXCL 12. Finally, GC T cells down-regulated RGS 13 and RGS 16 expression {{in the absence of}} FDCs and regained migratory competence to CXCL 12. Although GC T cells express high levels of CXCR 4, signaling through this receptor appears to be specifically inhibited by FDC-mediated expression of RGS 13 and RGS 16. Thus, FDCs appear to <b>directly</b> <b>affect</b> GC <b>T</b> cell migration within lymphoid follicles. The Journal of Immunology, 2004, 173 : 6169 – 6178.

40|$|The use of hypocalcemic vitamin D analogs is an {{appealing}} strategy {{to exploit the}} immunomodulatory actions of active vitamin D in vivo while circumventing its calcemic side effects. The functional modulation of dendritic cells by these molecules {{is regarded as the}} key mechanism underlying their ability to regulate T cell reactivity. In this article, we demonstrate the capacity of the vitamin D analog, TX 527, to target T cells directly. Microarray analysis of purified human CD 3 (+) T cells, cultured in the presence of TX 527, revealed differential expression of genes involved in T cell activation, proliferation, differentiation, and migratory capacity. Accordingly, functional analysis showed a TX 527 -mediated suppression of the T cell proliferative capacity and activation status, accompanied by decreased expression of effector cytokines (IFN-γ, IL- 4, and IL- 17). Furthermore, TX 527 triggered the emergence of CD 4 (+) CD 25 (high) CD 127 (low) regulatory T cells featuring elevated levels of IL- 10, CTLA- 4, and OX 40 and the functional capacity to suppress activation and proliferation of effector T cells. Moreover, the vitamin D analog profoundly altered the homing receptor profile of T cells and their migration toward chemokine ligands. Remarkably, TX 527 not only modulated skin-homing receptors as illustrated for the parent compound, but also reduced the expression of lymphoid organ-homing receptors (CD 62 L, CCR 7, and CXCR 4) and uniquely promoted surface expression of inflammatory homing receptors (CCR 5, CXCR 3, and CXCR 6) on T cells. We conclude that TX 527 <b>directly</b> <b>affects</b> human <b>T</b> cell function, thereby inhibiting effector T cell reactivity while inducing regulatory T cell characteristics, and imprints them with a specific homing signature favoring migration to sites of inflammation. status: publishe...|$|R
