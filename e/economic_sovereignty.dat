25|$|The IMF {{was one of}} the key organisations of the {{international}} economic system; its design allowed the system to balance the rebuilding of international capitalism with the maximisation of national <b>economic</b> <b>sovereignty</b> and human welfare, also known as embedded liberalism. The IMF's influence in the global economy steadily increased as it accumulated more members. The increase reflected in particular the attainment of political independence by many African countries and more recently the 1991 dissolution of the Soviet Union because most countries in the Soviet sphere of influence did not join the IMF.|$|E
500|$|Some economists, {{mostly from}} outside Europe and {{associated}} with Modern Monetary Theory and other post-Keynesian schools, condemned {{the design of}} the euro currency system from the beginning because it ceded national monetary and <b>economic</b> <b>sovereignty</b> but lacked a central fiscal authority. When faced with economic problems, they maintained, [...] "Without such an institution, EMU would prevent effective action by individual countries and put nothing in its place." [...] US economist Martin Feldstein went so far to call the euro [...] "an experiment that failed". Some non-Keynesian economists, such as Luca A. Ricci of the IMF, contend that the eurozone does not fulfil the necessary criteria for an optimum currency area, though it is moving in that direction.|$|E

2500|$|The rising {{influence}} of American diplomat George F. Kennan, a staunch anti-communist and champion of containment, fed U.S. suspicions that Argentine goals for <b>economic</b> <b>sovereignty</b> and neutrality were Perón's disguise for {{a resurgence of}} communism in the Americas. The U.S. Congress took a dislike of Perón and his government. In 1948 they excluded Argentine exports from the Marshall Plan, the landmark Truman administration effort to combat communism and help rebuild war-torn European nations by offering U.S. aid. This contributed to Argentine financial crises after 1948 and, according to Perón biographer Joseph Page, [...] "the Marshall Plan drove a final nail into the coffin that bore Perón's ambitions to transform Argentina into an industrial power". The policy deprived Argentina of potential agricultural markets in Western Europe {{to the benefit of}} Canadian exporters, for instance.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the role of}} identity in shaping counter-terrorism policy in Canada. We show that identity functions in three ways: constitutively by defining the range of choices a state is likely to consider; strategically by being a resource to buttress arguments based in <b>economic</b> or <b>sovereignty</b> interests; and heuristically by using identity as a marker for risk. This three-faceted explanation helps explain why, despite close economic, social, and political links between Canada and the United States which might lead us to expect Canada to follow American counter-terrorism policy, Canadian counter-terrorism policy often diverges from the American lead...|$|R

2500|$|This initial {{version was}} {{ignored by the}} House of Representatives, despite being officially {{presented}} by Democratic congressman Phillip Campbell. Afterwards, a modified version was created by Epifanio Fernández Vanga, who {{described it as a}} [...] "status where the people, being free, elected to associate with other people to establish a democratic base which due to mutual consent included tight economic and economic ties". This definition was officially adopted in the Union's platform. However, during the following years the discussion of the status issue stagnated, instead replaced with the serious economic concerns brought forth by the Great Depression. The Union lost its name and insignia after dissolving an alliance with the Republican Party, instead being reorganized into the new Liberal Party of Puerto Rico. This party proposed a two-step solution to the status issue, first obtaining a form of <b>economic</b> <b>sovereignty</b> and later proclaiming independence. Luis Muñoz Marín was part of the group that idealized this model. However, pressured by the economic influence of the sugar industry, the status discussion was stalled. This was exacerbated by serious differences between Barceló and Muñoz.|$|E
2500|$|On {{the other}} hand, {{the events in}} Georgia {{demonstrated}} the necessity for greater concessions to the peasants; Stalin declared that an August 1924 uprising in Georgia was sparked by dissatisfaction among the peasants and called the party to conciliate them. He admitted that [...] "what has happened in Georgia may happen throughout Russia, unless we make a complete change in our attitude to the peasantry" [...] and placed {{the responsibility for the}} errors committed on subordinate officials. Vyacheslav Molotov, an influential member of the Politburo, for his part declared: [...] "Georgia provides a startling example of the breach between the Party and the mass of the peasantry in the country." [...] As a result, the Communist Party of Georgia chose, for the time being, to use peaceful persuasion rather than armed coercion to extend their influence over the peasant masses, and to moderate the attempts to enforce collectivization. The extension of the radical land reform and the relative freedom granted peasants reduced hostility to the new regime. Although the last attributes of Georgia's political and <b>economic</b> <b>sovereignty,</b> which both the Mensheviks and the [...] "national Communists" [...] had fought to preserve, had been eliminated, the final victory of the Soviet power in Georgia was accompanied by moderate economic growth, that ensured relative stability in the country. Another important factor in lessening opposition to the Bolsheviks, particularly from the intelligentsia, was the policy of [...] "nativization" [...] pursued by the Soviet government in the 1920s; Georgian art, language, and learning were promoted; the spread of literacy was sponsored and the role of ethnic Georgians in administrative and cultural institutions enhanced.|$|E
