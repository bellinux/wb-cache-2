5|$|As India's {{national}} capital and centuries old Mughal capital, Delhi influenced the food <b>habits</b> {{of its residents}} and is where Mughlai cuisine originated. Along with Indian cuisine, a variety of international cuisines are popular among the residents. The dearth of food <b>habits</b> among the city's residents created a unique style of cooking which became popular throughout the world, with dishes such as Kebab, biryani, tandoori. The city's classic dishes include butter chicken, dal makhani, shahi paneer, aloo chaat, chaat, dahi bhalla, kachori, gol gappe, samosa, chole bhature, chole kulche, gulab jamun, jalebi and lassi.|$|E

In the presence of inward-looking (age-specific) <b>habit</b> formation, young households have a larger propensity to save than old households, and the economy attains a higher growth rate than the economy without any <b>habit</b> formation. In the economy with outward-looking (society-wide) <b>habit</b> formation, it is shown that the exact opposite is true.

40|$|Three studies {{examined}} {{the role of}} <b>habit</b> on information acquisition concerning travel mode choices. On the basis of Triandis' (1980) model of attitude–behaviour relations {{it was expected that}} <b>habit</b> strength attenuates the elaborateness of choice processes. The studies focused on different phases in the choice process, namely the appreciation of situational cues and appreciation of choice option information. In line with expectations, it was found that, compared to weak <b>habit</b> participants, those who had a strong <b>habit</b> towards choosing a particular travel mode acquired less information and gave evidence of less elaborate choice strategies. It was attempted to break effects of <b>habit</b> by manipulating either accountability demands or level of attention. Although accountability demands raised the level of information acquisition, no interactions with <b>habit</b> were found. Enhanced attention to the choice process initially did override <b>habit</b> effects in a series of choice trials. However, in spite of this manipulation, chronic <b>habit</b> effects emerged during later trials. The results demonstrate the profound effects that <b>habit</b> may have on the appreciation of information about choice situations and choice options...|$|R

A sample of 192 adults aged 18 - 30 completed measures of motivational regulation, intention, behaviour, and <b>habit</b> strength. Results showed that self-determined regulation interacted with past behaviour in predicting <b>habit</b> strength: prior action was more predictive of <b>habit</b> strength among more autonomously motivated participants.
