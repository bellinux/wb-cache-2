5|$|Immediately {{after the}} shootdown, South Korea, {{owner of the}} {{aircraft}} and therefore prime considerant for jurisdiction, designated the United States and Japan as search and salvage agents, thereby making it illegal for the Soviet Union to salvage the aircraft, providing it was found outside Soviet territorial waters.

5|$|In 1927, {{following}} {{the collapse of}} the First United Front, Kuomintang authorities ordered Zhu to lead a <b>force</b> <b>against</b> Zhou Enlai and Liu Bocheng's Nanchang Uprising. Having helped orchestrate the uprising, Zhu and his army defected from the Kuomintang. The uprising failed to gather support, however, and Zhu was forced to flee Nanchang with his army. Under the false name of Wang Kai, Zhu managed to find shelter for his remaining forces by joining warlord Fan Shisheng. He was soon named head of a new First United Front military institute in Nanchang.|$|E
5|$|On 13 February, having fought three {{successful}} {{actions in}} three days against the Prussian and Russian army at Champaubert, Montmirail and Château-Thierry, Napoleon was pursuing the defeated enemy.

Blücher knew that Marmont's Corps was weak and his plan was to destroy it and thus fall upon the rear of Napoleon's main force.|$|E

5|$|Wellesley's {{understanding}} of logistics was to prove valuable in leading an expeditionary <b>force</b> <b>against</b> the French invasion of Portugal and Spain. He was adept at planning long marches through unknown territory, understanding {{that he not}} only had thousands of men to manage efficiently, but that {{a huge amount of}} supplies were required to adequately feed and sustain his army. Secure supply lines to the Portuguese coast were of vital importance if he was to maintain his ability to fight the French.|$|E
5|$|As the Koreans were {{preparing}} their defensive {{positions on the}} dusk of November 25, the two Chinese corps were mobilizing for a decisive counterattack against the Eighth Army's right flank.

5|$|Falklands '82 is a turn-based {{strategy}} game {{focusing on}} land battles during the Falklands War. The player commands the British Task <b>Force</b> <b>against</b> the Argentine ground forces, who are occupying the islands. The game begins by allocating fifteen Royal Navy ships {{for the task}} force; a proportionate amount must be devoted for attack and defence purposes. The player must then choose four landing spots in northern East Falkland to begin the invasion: Port Stanley, Berkeley Sound, Cow Bay and San Carlos Bay. The SAS or SBS are available throughout the game to provide intelligence on Argentine movements; however, intelligence is limited and may only be collected {{a certain number of}} times. At any time, the player may request reinforcements from either one of the two aircraft carriers, HMS Hermes or HMS Invincible.|$|E

Having managed {{to break out of}} the Falaise Pocket, the 10th SS, 12th SS and 116th Panzer Divisions would then attack Hill262 from the southwest. If this major obstacle could be cleared, German units could initiate a full withdrawal from the Falaise Pocket.|$|E
5|$|In 1929 Zhu and Mao {{were forced}} to flee Jinggangshan to Ruijin {{following}} Kuomintang military pressure. Here they formed the Jiangxi Soviet, which would eventually grow to cover some 30,000 square kilometers (11,584 square miles) and include some three million people. In 1931 Zhu was appointed leader of the Red Army in Ruijin by the CPC leadership. He successfully led a conventional military <b>force</b> <b>against</b> the Kuomintang in the lead-up to the Fourth Counter Encirclement Campaign; However, {{he was not able}} to do the same during the Fifth Counter Encirclement Campaign and the CPC fled.

5|$|In 1978, when Vietnamese leaders {{launched}} their invasion of Kampuchea {{to remove the}} Khmer Rouge regime, they did not expect a negative reaction from the international community. However, the events that followed the invasion showed that Vietnamese leaders had severely miscalculated international sympathies towards their cause. Instead of backing Vietnam, most United Nations member countries denounced the Vietnamese use of <b>force</b> <b>against</b> Kampuchea, and even moved to revive the battered Khmer Rouge organisation that had once governed the country with such brutality. Thus, {{more than just a}} military problem, Kampuchea quickly evolved into an economic and diplomatic problem for Vietnam on the international arena. Throughout the decade in which Vietnam occupied neighbouring Kampuchea, the Vietnamese Government, and the PRK regime which it installed, were placed {{on the periphery of the}} international community.|$|E
5|$|In 1994, {{in order}} to meet an urgent need to {{increase}} the number of aircraft able to designate targets for laser-guided bombs, 10 GR1As and two T2As were upgraded with the capability to carry the TIALD laser designator pod and redesignated Jaguar GR1B or T2B respectively. TIALD equipped Jaguar GR1Bs were deployed to Italy in August to take part in Operation Deliberate <b>Force</b> <b>against</b> Bosnian Serb forces, being used to designate targets for RAF Harriers. During the Bosnian operations, a Jaguar of 41 Squadron carried out the first RAF bombing raid in Europe since the end of the Second World War fifty years before.|$|E

When Mace Tyrell asks his mother, Lady Olenna what this means, she bitterly replies it means the High Sparrow has won.|$|E

5|$|Major riots {{broke out}} in Léopoldville, the Congolese capital, on 4 January 1959 after a {{political}} demonstration turned violent. The Force Publique, the colonial gendarmerie, used <b>force</b> <b>against</b> the rioters—at least 49 people were killed, and total casualties may have been as high as 500. The nationalist parties' influence expanded outside the major cities for the first time, and nationalist demonstrations and riots became a regular occurrence over the next year, bringing large numbers of black people from outside the évolué class into the independence movement. Many blacks began to test {{the boundaries of the}} colonial system by refusing to pay taxes or abide by minor colonial regulations. The bulk of the ABAKO leadership was arrested, leaving the MNC in an advantageous position.|$|E
5|$|The Raid on Saint-Paul was an amphibious {{operation}} {{conducted by a}} combined British Army, Royal Navy and Royal Marines <b>force</b> <b>against</b> the fortified French port of Saint Paul on Île Bonaparte (now known as Réunion) during the Napoleonic Wars. The operation was launched on 20September 1809 as both a precursor to a future full-scale invasion of Île Bonaparte {{and in order to}} capture the French frigate Caroline and the East Indiamen she had seized in the Action of 31 May 1809 which were sheltering in the harbour. The operation was a complete success, with British storming parties capturing the batteries overlooking the port, which allowed a naval squadron under Commodore Josias Rowley to enter the bay and capture the shipping in the harbour.|$|E
5|$|The Sea Harrier saw {{action in}} war again {{when it was}} {{deployed}} in the 1992–1995 conflict in Bosnia, part of the Yugoslav Wars.

On 16 April 1994, a Sea Harrier of the 801 Naval Air Squadron, operating from the aircraft carrier HMS Ark Royal, was brought down by a Igla-1 surface-to-air missile fired by the Army of Republika Srpska while attempting to bomb two Bosnian Serb tanks.
