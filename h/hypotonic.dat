25|$|The most {{commonly}} used crystalloid fluid is normal saline, a solution of sodium chloride at 0.9% concentration, which {{is close to the}} concentration in the blood (isotonic). Lactated Ringer's (also known as Ringer's lactate) and the closely related Ringer's acetate, are mildly <b>hypotonic</b> solutions often used in those who have significant burns.|$|E
25|$|When the sacral dorsal {{roots are}} cut in {{experimental}} animals or interrupted by {{diseases of the}} dorsal roots such as tabes dorsalis in humans, all reflex contractions of the bladder are abolished. The bladder becomes distended, thin-walled, and <b>hypotonic,</b> {{but there are some}} contractions because of the intrinsic response of the smooth muscle to stretch.|$|E
25|$|Cells from bone marrow, blood, amniotic fluid, cord blood, tumor, and tissues (including skin, {{umbilical}} cord, chorionic villi, liver, {{and many}} other organs) can be cultured using standard cell culture techniques {{in order to increase}} their number. A mitotic inhibitor (colchicine, colcemid) is then added to the culture. This stops cell division at mitosis which allows an increased yield of mitotic cells for analysis. The cells are then centrifuged and media and mitotic inhibitor are removed, and replaced with a <b>hypotonic</b> solution. This causes the white blood cells or fibroblasts to swell so that the chromosomes will spread when added to a slide as well as lyses the red blood cells. After the cells have been allowed to sit in <b>hypotonic</b> solution, Carnoy's fixative (3:1 methanol to glacial acetic acid) is added. This kills the cells and hardens the nuclei of the remaining white blood cells. The cells are generally fixed repeatedly to remove any debris or remaining red blood cells. The cell suspension is then dropped onto specimen slides. After aging the slides in an oven or waiting a few days they are ready for banding and analysis.|$|E
25|$|Fresh {{water is}} <b>hypotonic</b> and hyponatremic {{relative}} to blood, so causes osmotic diffusion {{of water into}} the blood and sodium to the alveoli leading to hypervolemia and haemodilution with haemolysis, hyponatremia, and hyperkalemia, The resulting elevation of plasma K+ (potassium) level and depression of Na+ (sodium) level alter the electrical activity of the heart, which can cause ventricular fibrillation. In animal experiments this effect was shown {{to be capable of}} causing cardiac arrest in 2 to 3 minutes. Acute renal failure can also result from hemoglobin from the burst blood cells accumulating in the kidneys, and cardiac arrest can also result if cold fresh water taken into the bloodstream sufficiently cools the heart.|$|E
25|$|Opening and {{closure of}} the stomatal pore is {{mediated}} by changes in the turgor pressure of the two guard cells.The turgor pressure of guard cells is controlled by movements of large quantities of ions and sugars {{into and out of}} the guard cells. When guard cells take up these solutes, the water potential (Ψ) inside the cells decreases (creating a <b>hypotonic</b> solution), causing osmotic water flow into the guard cells. This leads to a turgor pressure increase causing swelling of the guard cells and the stomatal pores open. The ions that are taken up by guard cells are mainly potassium (K+) ions and chloride (Cl−) ions. In addition guard cells take up sugars that also contribute to opening of the stomatal pores.|$|E
25|$|Enclosing {{the cell}} is the cell {{envelope}} – generally {{consisting of a}} plasma membrane covered by a cell wall which, for some bacteria, may be further covered by a third layer called a capsule. Though most prokaryotes have both a cell membrane and a cell wall, there are exceptions such as Mycoplasma (bacteria) and Thermoplasma (archaea) which only possess the cell membrane layer. The envelope gives rigidity to the cell and separates {{the interior of the}} cell from its environment, serving as a protective filter. The cell wall consists of peptidoglycan in bacteria, and acts as an additional barrier against exterior forces. It also prevents the cell from expanding and bursting (cytolysis) from osmotic pressure due to a <b>hypotonic</b> environment. Some eukaryotic cells (plant cells and fungal cells) also have a cell wall.|$|E
25|$|In 1919, Weed and McKibben, {{biomedical}} {{researchers at}} Johns Hopkins Medical School, {{were the first}} ones to document the use and effect of osmotically active substances on brain mass. While studying transfer of salt solutions from blood to Cerebrospinal Fluid (CSF), they first noted that concentrated sodium chloride intravenous (IV) injection led to collapse of the thecal sac which prevented them from withdrawing CSF from the lumbar cistern. In order to further study the effect, they conducted lab experiments on anesthetized cats which underwent craniotomy. They observed changes to the convexity of cat's brain upon IV injection, specifically, they noted that Hypertonic Saline IV injection resulted in maximum shrinkage of the brain in 15-30 mins, while administration of <b>hypotonic</b> solutions resulted in protrusion and rupture of the brain tissue. By 1927, use of osmotic agents in IV delivery became official.|$|E
25|$|Water {{absorption}} at {{the colon}} typically proceeds against a transmucosal osmotic pressure gradient. The standing gradient osmosis is the reabsorption of water against the osmotic gradient in the intestines. Cells occupying the intestinal lining pump sodium ions into the intercellular space, raising the osmolarity of the intercellular fluid. This hypertonic fluid creates an osmotic pressure that drives {{water into the}} lateral intercellular spaces by osmosis via tight junctions and adjacent cells, which then in turn moves across the basement membrane and into the capillaries, while more sodium ions are pumped again into the intercellular fluid. Although water travels down an osmotic gradient in each individual step, overall, water usually travels against the osmotic gradient due to the pumping of sodium ions into the intercellular fluid. This allows the large intestine to absorb water despite the blood in capillaries being <b>hypotonic</b> compared to the fluid within the intestinal lumen.|$|E
25|$|As {{compared}} to other types of CP, and especially as {{compared to}} <b>hypotonic</b> or paralytic mobility disabilities, spastic CP is typically more easily manageable by the person affected, and medical treatment can be pursued on a multitude of orthopedic and neurological fronts throughout life. In any form of spastic CP, clonus of the affected limb(s) may sometimes result, as well as muscle spasms resulting from the pain or stress of the tightness experienced. The spasticity can and usually does lead to a very early onset of muscle stress symptoms like arthritis and tendinitis, especially in ambulatory individuals in their mid-20s and early-30s. Occupational therapy and physical therapy regimens of assisted stretching, strengthening, functional tasks, or targeted physical activity and exercise are usually the chief ways to keep spastic CP well-managed. If the spasticity {{is too much for}} the person to handle, other remedies may be considered, such as antispasmodic medications, botulinum toxin, baclofen, or even a neurosurgery known as a selective dorsal rhizotomy (which eliminates the spasticity by reducing the excitatory neural response in the nerves causing it).|$|E

2500|$|Evolutionary {{biologist}} J.B.S. Haldane was {{the first}} to give a hypothesis on the relationship between malaria and the genetic disease. He first delivered his hypothesis at the Eighth International Congress of Genetics held in 1948 at Stockholm on a topic [...] "The Rate of Mutation of Human Genes". He formalised in a technical paper published in 1949 in which he made a prophetic statement: [...] "The corpuscles of the anaemic heterozygotes are smaller than normal, and more resistant to <b>hypotonic</b> solutions. It is at least conceivable that they are also more resistant to attacks by the sporozoa which cause malaria." [...] This became known as 'Haldane's malaria hypothesis', or concisely, the 'malaria hypothesis'.|$|E
2500|$|When the afferent and efferent nerves {{are both}} destroyed, {{as they may}} be by tumors of the cauda equina or filum terminale, the bladder is flaccid and {{distended}} for a while. Gradually, however, the muscle of the [...] "decentralized bladder" [...] becomes active, with many contraction waves that expel dribbles of urine out of the urethra. The bladder becomes shrunken and the bladder wall hypertrophied. The reason for the difference between the small, hypertrophic bladder seen in this condition and the distended, <b>hypotonic</b> bladder seen when only the afferent nerves are interrupted is not known. The hyperactive state in the former condition suggests the development of denervation hypersensitization even though the neurons interrupted are preganglionic rather than postganglionic.|$|E
2500|$|Diagnosis is very difficult, {{and usually}} one of exclusion. SMA {{syndrome}} is thus considered only after patients have undergone an extensive evaluation of their gastrointestinal tract including upper endoscopy, and evaluation for various malabsorptive, ulcerative and inflammatory instestinal conditions {{with a higher}} diagnostic frequency. Diagnosis may follow x-ray examination revealing duodenal dilation followed by abrupt constriction proximal to the overlying SMA, {{as well as a}} delay in transit of four to six hours through the gastroduodenal region. [...] Standard diagnostic exams include abdominal and pelvic computed tomography (CT) scan with oral and IV contrast, upper gastrointestinal series (UGI), and, for equivocal cases, <b>hypotonic</b> duodenography. [...] In addition, vascular imaging studies such as ultrasound and contrast angiography may be used to indicate increased bloodflow velocity through the SMA or a narrowed SMA angle.|$|E

50|$|Unlike the {{descending}} limb, {{the thin}} ascending limb is impermeable to water, a critical {{feature of the}} countercurrent exchange mechanism employed by the loop. The ascending limb actively pumps sodium out of the filtrate, generating the hypertonic interstitium that drives countercurrent exchange. In passing through the ascending limb, the filtrate grows <b>hypotonic</b> since it has {{lost much of its}} sodium content. This <b>hypotonic</b> filtrate is passed to the distal convoluted tubule in the renal cortex.|$|E
50|$|A <b>hypotonic</b> {{solution}} {{has a lower}} {{concentration of}} solutes than another solution. In biology, a solution outside of a cell is called <b>hypotonic</b> {{if it has a}} lower concentration of solutes relative to the cytosol. Due to osmotic pressure, water diffuses into the cell, and the cell often appears turgid, or bloated.For cells without a cell wall such as animal cells, if the gradient is large enough, the uptake of excess water can produce enough pressure to induce cytolysis, or rupturing of the cell.When plant cells are in a <b>hypotonic</b> solution, the central vacuole takes on extra water and pushes the cell membrane against the cell wall. Due to the rigidity of the cell wall, it pushes back, preventing the cell from bursting. This is called turgor pressure.|$|E
