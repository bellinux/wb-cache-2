5|$|Coming {{into the}} game, Arizona and Nevada {{were two of}} the top offenses in the country, ranking 7th and 10th in yards per game respectively. There was also {{significant}} hype surrounding the game because it featured two of the best running backs in the country, Ka'Deem Carey for Arizona, and Stefphon Jefferson for Nevada. Carey was ranked number one in the country in total rushing yards, while <b>Jefferson</b> <b>was</b> ranked number two. The duo were also prolific scorers; <b>Jefferson</b> <b>was</b> second in the country in rushing touchdowns with 25 and Carey was third with 24. The game was widely expected to be a shoot-out, as both teams were in the top-20 scoring offenses in the regular season.|$|E
5|$|Working from Winthrop Jordan's Black on White (1968), Brodie {{also used}} Dumas Malone's {{documentation}} of Jefferson's activities to correlate his stays at Monticello with the conception period {{of each of}} Sally Hemings' children, whose births he recorded in the Farm Book. She discovered that Hemings never conceived when <b>Jefferson</b> <b>was</b> not at Monticello, during years when he was often away {{for months at a}} time.|$|E
5|$|By July 1803, {{citizens}} of the western states, desiring more representation {{in the federal government}} and intent on breaking the pattern of nominating a Virginians and New Yorkers for most important federal offices, were advocating Breckinridge's nomination as vice president in the 1804 presidential election. Thomas <b>Jefferson</b> <b>was</b> expected to be reelected, but most Democratic-Republicans had grown disenchanted with Vice President Aaron Burr; he would not be Jefferson's running mate. Breckinridge's service as Senate floor leader made him a natural choice.|$|E

5|$|The {{historical}} {{question of}} whether <b>Jefferson</b> <b>was</b> the father of Hemings' children {{is known as the}} Jefferson–Hemings controversy. Following renewed historic analysis in the late 20th century and a 1998 DNA study that found a match between the Jefferson male line and a descendant of Hemings' last son, Eston Hemings, there is a near-consensus among historians that Jefferson fathered her son Eston Hemings and probably all her children. A small number of historians disagree.|$|E
5|$|When Napoleon {{sought to}} sell the French {{territory}} of Louisiana to the United States in 1802, <b>Jefferson</b> <b>was</b> concerned over the political consequences of acquiring a large tract of what was perceived then as predominantly Southern territory, {{as well as a}} possible lack of constitutional authority to make the purchase. To circumvent these concerns, Lincoln made a novel proposal that the territory could be acquired by expanding an existing state's borders, effecting a purchase that would not require a constitutional amendment. This proposal was rejected by Jefferson and his other advisors, and the purchase was ultimately made in spite of the standing constitutional question.|$|E
5|$|When {{the electoral}} votes were counted, Adams {{finished}} {{in third place}} with 65 votes, and Pinckney came in fourth with 64 votes (one New England Federalist elector voted for John Jay instead). Jefferson and Burr tied for first place with 73 votes each. Because of the tie, the election devolved upon the House of Representatives. As specified by the Constitution, each state's delegation voted , with each state having a single vote; an absolute majority (nine, as there were 16 states at the time) was required for victory. On February 17, 1801 – on the 36th ballot – <b>Jefferson</b> <b>was</b> elected {{by a vote of}} 10 to 4 (two states abstained).|$|E

5|$|His brother Joseph, who was 24 years older, {{acted as}} a {{surrogate}} father and encouraged Jefferson in his education. Two years later, Davis entered the Catholic school of Saint Thomas at St. Rose Priory, a school operated by the Dominican Order in Washington County, Kentucky. At the time, {{he was the only}} Protestant student at the school. In 1818 Davis returned to Mississippi, studying at Jefferson College at Washington. Three years later in 1821, he returned to Kentucky, where he studied at Transylvania University in Lexington. (At the time, these colleges were like academies, roughly equivalent to high schools.) His father Samuel died on July 4, 1824, when <b>Jefferson</b> <b>was</b> 16 years old.|$|E
5|$|Miles' father also reappears, and {{relates to}} his son that as a young man, he and Aaron {{went to work for}} a {{criminal}} named Turk after <b>Jefferson</b> <b>was</b> recruited by S.H.I.E.L.D. as a spy in order to infiltrate the organization of the then-up-and-coming international criminal Wilson Fisk. Jefferson did this for a time, but after the Kingpin was arrested and convicted for his crimes, and Jefferson offered a chance to be a full-fledged S.H.I.E.L.D. agent, he refused, not wanting any part of his brother's world. He met Rio a week later {{and fell in love with}} her. Jefferson fled after learning that Miles was Spider-Man because it brought back unresolved issues from that earlier time in his life, and tells Miles that he does not blame Miles for his mother's death, and regrets abandoning him.|$|E
5|$|To Brodie, Jefferson’s {{ambiguous}} posturings on slavery {{could be}} explained by his personal life. If he had been conducting a 28-year affair with a slave, then he could not free his slaves because once they were freed, Virginia law would force them from the state, unless he gained permission from the legislature for them to stay. He could continue his liaison with Hemings only if his slaves remained slaves. Two of the most prominent Jefferson biographers of the twentieth century, Dumas Malone and Merrill Peterson, had relied on Jefferson family testimony by two Randolph grandchildren who named his Carr nephews as fathers. They discounted other evidence about this alleged sexual relationship, including by Madison Hemings in 1873, who identified Jefferson as his father. The relationship was first reported in 1802 by the journalist James T. Callender when <b>Jefferson</b> <b>was</b> President, after Callender failed to win an appointment by the president.|$|E

5|$|Washington was not {{a member}} of any {{political}} party and hoped {{that they would not be}} formed, fearing conflict that would undermine republicanism. His closest advisors formed two factions, setting the framework for the future First Party System. Secretary of Treasury Alexander Hamilton had bold plans to establish the national credit and to build a financially powerful nation, and he formed the basis of the Federalist Party. Secretary of State Thomas <b>Jefferson</b> <b>was</b> the founder of the Jeffersonian Republicans, and he strenuously opposed Hamilton's agenda. Washington typically favored Hamilton over Jefferson, and it was Hamilton's agenda that went into effect. Jefferson's political actions, his support of Philip Freneau's National Gazette, and his attempt to undermine Hamilton nearly led George Washington to dismiss him from his cabinet, though he ultimately left the cabinet voluntarily. Washington never forgave him and never spoke to him again.|$|E
5|$|Polly, Cabell, and Letitia {{all fell}} ill but survived a {{smallpox}} epidemic in 1793; however, Mary Hopkins and Robert died. Cabell would later serve as Speaker of the Kentucky House of Representatives and Kentucky's Secretary of State. He {{was the father}} of U.S. Vice President John C. Breckinridge. The younger John Breckinridge attended Princeton Theological Seminary, served as chaplain of the U.S. House of Representatives, and was president of Oglethorpe College (now Oglethorpe University) in Georgia. Robert <b>Jefferson</b> <b>was</b> appointed superintendent of public instruction under Governor William Owsley and became known as the father of Kentucky's public education system. William Lewis became a prominent Presbyterian minister, serving as moderator of the Presbyterian General Assembly in 1859 and later as president of Centre College in Danville, Kentucky, and Oakland College in Yale, Mississippi. In 1804, Letitia married Alfred W. Grayson, son of Virginia Senator William Grayson. Alfred Grayson died in 1808, and in 1816, Letitia married Peter Buell Porter, who would later serve as Secretary of War under President John Quincy Adams.|$|E
5|$|When U.S. Attorney General Levi Lincoln {{resigned}} in December 1804, Jefferson and Treasury Secretary Albert Gallatin sought a replacement. Virginia's John Thomson Mason, Gallatin's first choice, declined the appointment. U.S. Navy Secretary Robert Smith desired the office, and Jefferson agreed to appoint him, contingent upon finding a suitable replacement for Smith as Secretary of the Navy. Jefferson appointed Massachusetts Congressman Jacob Crowninshield to replace Smith, and both appointments were {{confirmed by the}} Senate March 3, 1805. Crowninshield refused his appointment, however, and Smith was forced to remain as Secretary of the Navy. Jefferson then offered the position to Breckinridge, Gallatin's second choice. Breckinridge resigned from the Senate on August 7, 1805 to accept the appointment. He was the first U.S. cabinet-level official from west of the Allegheny Mountains, and his appointment boosted Jefferson's popularity in the west. Lowell Harrison called the appointment a mistake by Jefferson, not because Breckinridge lacked any qualifications, but because <b>Jefferson</b> <b>was</b> not able to replace his leadership in the Senate. He noted that after Breckinridge's departure from the chamber, the Federalist minority experienced a revival of influence {{under the leadership of}} Connecticut's Uriah Tracy.|$|E

25|$|Dumas Malone {{documented}} Jefferson's {{activities and}} residencies through the years. His documentation in his multi-volume biography (published 1948–1981) provided {{the details that}} Pearl Graham analyzed to show <b>Jefferson</b> <b>was</b> at Monticello for the conception of each of Hemings' children. She never conceived {{when he was not}} there. Martha Randolph, Jefferson's daughter with Martha Wayles Jefferson, had made a deathbed claim that <b>Jefferson</b> <b>was</b> away for a 15-month period during which one of the Hemings children was conceived. Gordon-Reed shows this claim is not supported by Malone's documentation; <b>Jefferson</b> <b>was</b> at Monticello at the time of conception of each child.|$|E
25|$|When {{construction}} {{began at}} Poplar Forest in 1806, <b>Jefferson</b> <b>was</b> still President of the United States and supervised the construction from Washington, DC. Thomas <b>Jefferson</b> <b>was</b> a self-taught architect {{known for his}} work at Monticello and the Virginia State Capitol; he frequently borrowed designs from classical sources, and was attracted to Palladio's classical architecture in Rome as well as designs from 16th century France. Jefferson designed Poplar Forest as his personal retreat house, and selected the property because of its distance from his public life.|$|E
