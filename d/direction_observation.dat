Worker behavior usually consists of completing the tasks necessary to keep the colony running. For example, any maintenance behaviors are always completed by the workers, not the queen. If they are being idle, they sit quietly on the comb and regurgitate food when solicited by another wasp. The workers also constantly groom the queen but not each other. This {{could be due to}} the fact that the workers are all attracted to their queen more than they are attracted to each other.|$|E

Unlike the distance observations, no dependence of environmental conditions {{is known for}} horizontal <b>direction</b> <b>observations.</b> In {{order to determine the}} dependence of horizontal <b>direction</b> <b>observations,</b> we established test geodetic network of a station and four observation points. Measurements of the highest possible accuracy were carried out using Leica TS 30 total station along with precise prisms GPH 1 P. Two series of hundred sets of angles were measured, with the first one in bad observation conditions. Using different methods, i. e. variance–covariance matrices, x 2 test and analyses of time series, the independence of measured directions, reduced directions and horizontal angles were tested. The results show that the independence of horizontal <b>direction</b> <b>observations</b> is not obvious and certainly not in poor conditions. In this case, it would be appropriate for geodetic network adjustments to use variance–covariance matrix calculated from measurements instead of diagonal variance–covariance matrix...|$|R

40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages 53 - 54) The {{problem of}} processing measured data {{for use with}} the Kalman filter is considered. Specifically, {{the problem is that}} of tracking an airborne target with measurements obtained by radar. The <b>direction</b> <b>observation</b> and filtering processes are investigated. The problems considered are <b>direction</b> <b>observation</b> noise due to multiple targets, multipath reflections in the mainlobe, target angular extent, and thermal noise in the receiver. It is assumed that a stable track of the ensemble of radar reflector points is desired rather than resolving and tracking the individual points. A signal processing technique which reduces the adverse effects of target angular extent and more closely matches the observations to the Kalman filter observation model is presented. It is assumed that the radar system makes use of the monopulse type of antenna system. With the information available from this type of antenna, a maximum likelihood estimate of the direction of the return signal can be formulated which {{is in the form of}} a complex correlation pre-filter. The performance of the maximum likelihood direction estimator is compared to that of the maximum likelihood angle estimator which has been investigated in the literature. Of key interest in this paper is the fact that the statistics of the estimators discussed are obtained by direct mathematical analysis rather than by a computer simulation of the noise processes. This report also includes the first treatment of the statistics of D/S (a common angle measurement) which properly presents the functional relationship between the threshold level and the variance of the measurement for the assumption of a point target and additive Gaussian noise...|$|E
40|$|How to {{determine}} the camera’s next best view is a challenging problem in vision field. A next best view approach is proposed based on occlusion information in a single depth image. First, the occlusion detection is accomplished for the depth image of visual object in current view to obtain the occlusion boundary and the nether adjacent boundary. Second, the external surface of occluded region is constructed and modeled according to the occlusion boundary and the nether adjacent boundary. Third, the observation <b>direction,</b> <b>observation</b> center point, and area information of external surface of occluded region are solved. And then, the set of candidate observation directions and the visual space of each candidate direction are determined. Finally, the next best view is achieved by solving the next best observation direction and camera’s observation position. The proposed approach does not need the prior knowledge of visual object or limit the camera position on a specially appointed surface. Experimental results demonstrate that the approach is feasible and effective...|$|E

In this paper we describe {{a method for}} fabrication of large area nanothickness silicon crystalline membranes starting from a SIMOX wafer. The realized structures have been characterized by means of high resolution X-ray diffraction and planar channeling of a 2 MeV proton beam. This last analyses dem- onstrates a very interesting phenomenon: As the beam direction is inclined by less than the planar chan- nelling critical angle {{with respect to the}} crystal planes, channeled particles undergo half a ‘‘channeling oscillation’’ and exit the crystal with reversed transverse momenta, i. e., the protons trajectories are ‘‘mir- rored’’ by the crystal planes.

40|$|Resonance {{fluorescence}} of two two-level atoms {{driven by}} a coherent laser field propagating parallel to the interatomic axis is examined, {{taking into account the}} dipole-dipole interaction. We show that the number of peaks in the fluorescence intensity depends on the <b>direction</b> of <b>observation</b> with respect to the interatomic axis and on whether the system is {{driven by a}} standing-wave or a running-wave laser field. When the system is driven by the standing-wave field the fluorescence intensity shows two peaks and a dip for an <b>observation</b> <b>direction</b> perpendicular to the interatomic axis and three peaks in the direction parallel to it. When the system is driven by the running-wave field only two peaks are observed for the perpendicular direction. We explain these features in terms of the collective states of the system and show that the directional effect {{can be attributed to the}} fact that the antisymmetric state of the system does not radiate in the direction perpendicular to the interatomic axis. Photon statistics also demonstrate the directional effect for the standing-wave field. Frequency regimes are found where sub-Poissonian photon statistics occur. Depending on the <b>direction</b> of the <b>observation,</b> a state close to a Fock state can occur for one or two frequencies of the driving field, corresponding to zero-photon-number fluctuations or maximum sub-Poissonian behavior. The fluorescence spectrum is found to depend on the <b>direction</b> of <b>observation</b> and the interatomic separation. For small interatomic separations and a standing-wave driving field the spectrum exhibits seven lines for the perpendicular direction and 13 lines in the direction parallel to the interatomic axis. For the running-wave field the spectrum shows 13 lines independent of the <b>direction</b> of <b>observation.</b> Moreover, we show that for particular interatomic separations dark regimes appear in the spectrum. We discuss the effect of the dipole-dipole interaction on the dark states and explain the spectral features in terms of the dressed-atom model.

We show that apart from a weak dispersion structure, the spectrum shows large peaks as one of the atoms is moved to successive nodes of the field...|$|R
