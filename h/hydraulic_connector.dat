40|$|The Subsea blowout {{preventer}} (BOP) which is latched to a subsea wellhead {{is one of}} several barriers in the well to prevent kicks and blowouts and it is the most important and critical equipment, as it becomes the last line of protection against blowout. The BOP system used in Subsea drilling operations is considered a Safety – Critical System, with a high severity consequence following its failure. Following past offshore blowout incidents such as the most recent Macondo in the Gulf of Mexico, there have been investigations, research, and improvements sought for improved understanding of the BOP system and its operation. This informs the need for a systematic re-evaluation of the Subsea BOP system to understand its associated risk and reliability and identify critical areas/aspects/components. Different risk analysis techniques were surveyed and the Failure modes effect and criticality analysis (FMECA) selected to be used to drive the study in this thesis. This is due to it being a simple proven cost effective process that can add value {{to the understanding of the}} behaviours and properties of a system, component, software, function or other. The output of the FMECA can be used to inform or support other key engineering tasks such as redesigning, enhanced qualification and testing activity or maintenance for greater inherent reliability and reduced risk potential. This thesis underscores the application of the FMECA technique to critique associated risk of the Subsea BOP system. System Functional diagrams was developed with boundaries defined, a FMECA were carried out and an initial select list of critical component failure modes identified. The limitations surrounding the confidence of the FMECA failure modes ranking outcome based on Risk priority number (RPN) is presented and potential variations in risk interpretation are discussed. The main contribution in this thesis is an innovative framework utilising Multicriteria decision making (MCDA) analysis techniques with consideration of fuzzy interval data is applied to the Subsea BOP system critical failure modes from the FMECA analysis. It utilised nine criticality assessment criteria deduced from expert consultation to obtain a more reliable ranking of failure modes. The MCDA techniques applied includes the technique for order of Preference for similarity to the Ideal Solution (TOPSIS), Fuzzy TOPSIS, TOPSIS with interval data, and Preference Ranking Organization Method for Enrichment of Evaluations (PROMETHEE). The outcome of the Multi-criteria analysis of the BOP system clearly shows failures of the Wellhead connector, LMRP <b>hydraulic</b> <b>connector</b> and Control system related failure as the Top 3 most critical failure with respect to a well control. The critical failure mode and components outcome from the analysis in this thesis is validated using failure data from industry database and a sensitivity analysis carried out. The importance of maintenance, testing and redundancy to the BOP system criticality was established by the sensitivity analysis. The potential for MCDA to be used for more specific analysis of criteria for a technology was demonstrated. Improper maintenance, inspection, testing (functional and pressure) are critical to the BOP system performance and sustenance of a high reliability level. Material selection and performance of components (seals, flanges, packers, bolts, mechanical body housings) relative to use environment and operational conditions is fundamental to avoiding failure mechanisms occurrence. Also worthy of notice is the contribution of personnel and organisations (by way of procedures to robustness and verification structure to ensure standard expected practices/rules are followed) to failures as seen in the root cause discussion. OEMs, operators and drilling contractors to periodically review operation scenarios relative to BOP system product design through the use of a Failure reporting analysis and corrective action system. This can improve design of monitoring systems, informs requirement for re-qualification of technology and/or next generation designs. Operations personnel are to correctly log in failures in these systems, and responsible Authority to ensure root cause analysis is done to uncover underlying issue initiating and driving failures...|$|E

50|$|The terms blowout {{preventer}}, {{blowout preventer}} stack and blowout preventer system {{are commonly used}} interchangeably and in a general manner to describe an assembly of several stacked blowout preventers of varying type and function, as well as auxiliary components. A typical subsea deepwater blowout preventer system includes components such as electrical and hydraulic lines, control pods, hydraulic accumulators, test valve, kill and choke lines and valves, riser joint, <b>hydraulic</b> <b>connectors,</b> and a support frame.|$|R

30|$|Most of the non-weld {{connectors}} are {{supplied by}} offshore oil-gas service companies from America and Europe, such as Oil states industries Inc, Cameron, FMC Technologies, Oceaneering International Inc, Quality Connector LLC and Hydratight. Static metal seal based Connectors include tapping connector and method of using same [5], swivel ring flange, external <b>hydraulic</b> tieback <b>connector</b> [6], subsea tool for tie in of pipeline ends [7] and adapter sleeve for wellhead housing [8]. Rubber sealed connectors include pipeline joint [9], over 2000 morgrip connector and coupling device [10]. The other connectors with metal and rubber seal include griplock end connector, smart flange plus connector, quick flange morgrip pipeline <b>connector</b> and <b>hydraulic</b> smart flange <b>connector.</b> The above typical connectors are reliable to connect subsea pipelines, but their design is too complicated. Too many bolts {{have to be}} pre-tightened and operation tools have {{to be used for}} connection, which result in a long lead time and high cost. Gottfried [11] presented a simple metal sealing connector for the connection of water supply and drainage pipelines with diameter less than 168.3 mm under low or zero pressure on land. This paper presents an improved design of subsea pipeline mechanical connector (SPMC) {{that can be used for}} a bigger diameter and a higher pressure in the complicated subsea environment.|$|R
30|$|Different {{preventer}} configurations provide {{different levels}} of performance for subsea BOP systems. Specifically, a blind shear ram preventer, which is regarded as an emergency device, is used to shear the pipe and seal the well. As shown in Fig.  1, the typical subsea BOP is equipped with two annular preventers and four or five ram preventers, including two blind shear rams {{and two or three}} pipe rams. The configuration of the stack is dependent on the expected operations, redundancy, flexibility and the trade-off between {{the advantages and disadvantages of}} each configuration (Januarilham 2012). Besides the annular preventers, ram preventers, connectors and other components such as the flexible joint, choke/kill valves and choke/kill lines are integrated to form the whole subsea BOP stack (Cai et al. 2012). There are several types of rams which have different tasks in addition to sealing the well. One may be designed to grip and hold equipment lowered into the well, while others are designed to cut equipment and pipes which are blocking the ram. The latter is the shear seal ram (Østby 2008). The subsea BOP stack is usually equipped with two <b>hydraulic</b> <b>connectors,</b> the LMRP connector and the wellhead connector. The LMRP contains the control system of the BOP and one or two annular preventers, depending on the BOP configuration. The LMRP connector enables retrieval of the control system, and the annular preventer enables maintenance without the necessity of removing the whole BOP stack, therefore saving time and making it safer, besides being used to connect the LMRP to the BOP stack. The wellhead connector is used to connect the BOP stack to the wellhead (Cai et al. 2012).|$|R

However, the work VC machines could achieve was slightly constrained by design limitations and so the popularity of fully hydraulic [...] "long reach" [...] machines steadily increased, especially {{with the arrival of}} more reliable machines from Japan built by manufacturers such as Hitachi and Komatsu. These Japanese designed machines used higher quality <b>hydraulic</b> fittings and <b>connectors</b> and hardly ever leaked hydraulic fluid.
