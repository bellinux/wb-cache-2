5|$|As the environments of most {{organisms are}} {{constantly}} changing, {{the reactions of}} metabolism must be finely regulated to maintain a constant set of conditions within cells, a condition called homeostasis. Metabolic regulation also allows organisms to respond to signals and interact actively with their environments. Two closely linked concepts are important for understanding how metabolic pathways are controlled. Firstly, the regulation of an enzyme in a pathway is how its activity is increased and decreased in response to signals. Secondly, the control exerted by this enzyme <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>effect</b> that these changes in its activity have on the overall rate of the pathway (the flux through the pathway). For example, an enzyme may show large changes in activity (i.e. it is highly regulated) but if these changes have {{little effect on the}} flux of a metabolic pathway, then this enzyme is not involved in the control of the pathway.|$|E
5|$|Samarium salts stimulate metabolism, but it {{is unclear}} whether this <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>effect</b> of {{samarium}} or other lanthanides present with it. The total amount of samarium in adults is about 50µg, mostly in liver and kidneys and with about 8µg/L being dissolved in the blood. Samarium is not absorbed by plants to a measurable concentration and therefore is normally not a part of human diet. However, a few plants and vegetables may contain up to 1 part per million of samarium. Insoluble salts of samarium are non-toxic and the soluble ones are only slightly toxic.|$|E

However, symptoms may not correlate with laparoscopic findings. METHODS AND OUTCOMES: We conducted a systematic review and aimed {{to answer the following}} clinical questions: What <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>effects</b> of hormonal treatments given at diagnosis of endometriosis? What <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>effects</b> of hormonal treatments before surgery for endometriosis? What <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>effects</b> of non-hormonal medical treatments for endometriosis?

What <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>effects</b> of hormonal treatment after oophorectomy (with or without hysterectomy) for endometriosis? What <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>effects</b> of treatments for ovarian endometrioma? We searched: Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library, and other important databases up to December 2009 (Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically, please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review). We included harms alerts from relevant organisations such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA). RESULTS: We found 40 systematic reviews, RCTs, or observational studies that met our inclusion criteria. We performed a GRADE evaluation of the quality of evidence for interventions. CONCLUSIONS: In this systematic review we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of the following interventions: combined oral contraceptives, danazol, dydrogesterone, gestrinone, gonadorelin analogues, aromatase inhibitors, hormonal treatment before surgery, hormonal treatment, laparoscopic cystectomy, laparoscopic removal of endometriotic deposits (alone or with uterine nerve ablation), laparoscopic removal plus presacral neurectomy, laparoscopic uterine nerve ablation, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, presacral neurectomy alone, and progestogens other than dydrogesterone...|$|R
