40|$|The {{results of}} the pre:lent {{investigation}} may be summarized as follows: (1) The heat content of carbon steels at high temperatures {{was determined by the}} mixture method, while the oxidation of the specimen was prevented by passing a purified hydrogen gas through the furnace. The specimens were twelve kinds of steels with different carbon contents from 0. 09 % to 2. 84 % and the range of temperature was 23 ~ 250 °C. (2) According to A. Meuthen, the specific heat is constant below the A 1 point, but the present writer showed that the specific heat is only constant above the A 3 point, and that below this point, it increases with the rise of temperature. (3) The quantity of heat for the dissolution of pearlite in iron was determined by measuring the heat content above and below the A 1 point. This heat increases proportionally with the content of carbon, reaches a maximum at 0. 9 percent and ends at 6. 7 percent. For the dissolution of I gr. of carbon in iron, a heat of 1760 calories is required, while, 16. 1 calories are necessary for the dissolution of 1 gr. of pearlite in iron. (4) From the heat content-concentration curve, it was found that, the mean specific heat of cementite increases with the rise of temperature; it is 0. 149 at 150 °C and 02. 20 at 850 °C. (5) It was observed that the specific heat of the carbon poles with 98 %C increases almost linearly up to 700 °C, and afterwards its rate of increase gradually diminishes. (6) It is confirmed by experiments that the A 1 transformation is a function of temperature and time, but that the A 2 transformation is a definite function of temperature only. (7) From the heat content-concentration curves, the <b>heat</b> <b>of</b> <b>transformation</b> from martensite to pearlite was obtained and found to be proportional to the carbon content.

40|$|The main {{scope of}} this work {{concerns}} {{the definition of the}} thermal conductivity temperature dependence of fully dense NiTi SMAs in the temperature range where the Martensitic Austenitic phase transformation occurs. The methodology used to evaluate this thermal property is based on an experimental-numerical approach that requires the definition of the heat capacity temperature dependence and the knowledge of the latent <b>heat</b> <b>of</b> <b>transformation.</b> The experimental work is based on the capability to heat the cylindrical NiTi samples uniformly on one side and to impose a variety of initial heating rates ranging from 0. 1 to 5 K/s. Laser radiant energy was used as the heating source and the temperature history of the top and bottom NiTi sample surfaces were recorded using thermocouples. The numerical code considered the sample as a solid with a constant density and with thermal properties that were dependent on temperature. The heat capacity and latent <b>heat</b> <b>of</b> <b>transformation</b> were defined {{on the basis of the}} thermal analysis data, while the convection heat exchange coefficient was estimated from knowledge of the experimental configuration, lateral sample surface and the temperature field of the gas surrounding the sample. The results indicated that the thermal conductivity generally increased with temperature, but a minimum in the temperature range defining the Martensitic Austenitic transformation has been pointed out. The higher thermal conductivity value of the Austenite phase is correlated with its electronic structure. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Metastable {{austenitic}} stainless steels {{are designed to be}} thermodynamically unstable so that plastic deformations even at ambient temperatures can cause the austenite to transform to martensite. It improves the formability of these steels, since necking is delayed. This is a solid-state phase transformation where concurrently there is a latent <b>heat</b> <b>of</b> <b>transformation</b> and an adiabatic heat is generated due to plastic deformation. Since the lattice structure of the polycrystal changes, the thermo-physical properties of the metal also change during this process as a function of strain, strain rate and temperature. Such a transformation is believed to be initiated by either a local concentration of stresses or strain induced stacking faults in the polycrystal. It is a diffusionless shear transformation at the lattice level and the in-situ state of stress affects the amount and kinetics of the phase transformed. Therefore a Finite Element Model is developed for a specific Cr-Ni maraging stainless steel to study the influence of deformation on phase transformation...|$|E
