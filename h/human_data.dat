5|$|TCDD was {{classified}} in 1997 by the International Agency for Research on Cancer as a carcinogen for humans (group 1). In the occupational cohort studies {{available for the}} classification, the risk, even at very high exposures, was weak and borderline detectable. Therefore, <b>human</b> <b>data</b> were not deemed sufficient, and the classification was, in essence, based on animal experiments and mechanistic considerations. This has been criticized as a deviation from IARC classification rules. It is much debated whether TCDD is carcinogenic only at high doses which also cause toxic damage of tissues. Moreover, a recent review concludes that, after 1997, further studies do not support an association between TCDD exposure and cancer risk. New studies include the update of Vietnam veteran studies from Ranch Hand operation, which concluded that after 30 years the results do not provide evidence of disease.|$|E
5|$|When {{applied to}} <b>human</b> <b>data,</b> GWA studies compare the DNA of {{participants}} having varying phenotypes {{for a particular}} trait or disease. These participants may be people with a disease (cases) and similar people without (controls), {{or they may be}} people with different phenotypes for a particular trait, for example blood pressure. This approach is known as phenotype-first, in which the participants are classified first by their clinical manifestation(s), as opposed to genotype-first. Each person gives a sample of DNA, from which millions of genetic variants are read using SNP arrays. If one type of the variant (one allele) is more frequent in people with the disease, the variant is said {{to be associated with the}} disease. The associated SNPs are then considered to mark a region of the human genome that may influence the risk of disease.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. It {{is known}} that high-{{dimensional}} <b>human</b> motion <b>data</b> lies in a low dimensional space. Looking for independent sub-motions that contribute to generating complicated human motions is an interesting task on its own merits. Independent Component Analysis (ICA) can extract independent factors of an observed signal. In this paper, ICA {{is applied to the}} reconstructed <b>human</b> motion <b>data</b> by PCA. Experimental results show that, if the low dimenality is appropriately chosen, ICA can find meaningful sub-motions. Independent sub-motions make it easy to complete missing <b>human</b> motion <b>data.</b> Preliminary results on synthesizing missing <b>human</b> motion <b>data</b> by self-regression using Gassian Process will also be discussed in the paper.

25|$|Concerns on {{the health}} effects of {{triclosan}} have been raised after it was detected in human breast milk, blood, and urine samples. While no <b>human</b> <b>data</b> exists, studies on rats have shown that triclosan exposure modulates estrogen-dependent responses. There have been many studies performed over the years both in vivo and in vitro, in male and female fish and rats and they all support the conclusion that triclosan possesses (anti)estrogenic and (anti)androgenic properties depending on species, tissues, and cell types.|$|E
25|$|At this time, the {{possible}} detrimental effects to an astronaut’s CNS from the HZE component of GCR {{have yet to}} be identified. This is largely {{due to the lack of}} a human epidemiological basis with which to estimate risks and the relatively small number of published experimental studies with animals. RBE factors are combined with <b>human</b> <b>data</b> to estimate cancer risks for low-LET radiation exposure. Since this approach is not possible for CNS risks, new approaches to risk estimation will be needed. Thus, biological research is required to establish risk levels and risk projection models and, if the risk levels are found to be significant, to design countermeasures.|$|E

2500|$|... 1,3-Butadiene {{is also a}} {{suspected}} human teratogen. Prolonged and excessive exposure can affect many areas in the human body; blood, brain, eye, heart, kidney, lung, nose and throat have all been shown {{to react to the}} presence of excessive 1,3-butadiene. [...] Animal data suggest that women have a higher sensitivity to possible carcinogenic effects of butadiene over men when exposed to the chemical. This may be due to estrogen receptor impacts. While these data reveal important implications to the risks of human exposure to butadiene, more data are necessary to draw conclusive risk assessments. There is also a lack of <b>human</b> <b>data</b> for the effects of butadiene on reproductive and development shown to occur in mice, but animal studies have shown breathing butadiene during pregnancy can increase the number of birth defects, and humans have the same hormone systems as animals.|$|E

For infants up to 12 months the Adequate Intake (AI) is 0.3-0.4mg/day. and for children ages 1–13 years the RDA increases with age from 0.5 to 0.9mg/day.
