2500|$|First, {{the courts}} have said that in {{choosing}} investments, trustees may not disregard the financial implications of the investment choice. In Cowan v Scargill the trustees of pensions represented by Arthur Scargill and the National Union of Mineworkers wished the pension fund to invest more in the troubled UK mining industry, by excluding investments, for instance, in competing industries, while the trustees appointed by the employer did not. Megarry J held the action would violate a trustee's duty if this action was taken. Drawing a parallel of refusing to invest in South African companies (during Apartheid) he warned that [...] "the {{best interests of the}} beneficiaries are normally their best financial interests." [...] Although this was thought in some quarters to preclude <b>ethical</b> <b>investment,</b> it was made clear in Harries v Church Commissioners for England that the terms of a trust deed may explicitly authorise or prohibit certain investments, that if the object of a trust is, for example, Christian charity then a trustee could plainly invest in [...] "Christian" [...] things. In Harries, Donald Nicholls VC held that unless financial performance could be proven to be harmed, a trustee for church clergy retirement could take ethical considerations into account when investing money, and so avoid investments contrary to the religion's principles. By analogy, a trade union pension trustee could refuse to invest in apartheid South Africa, while the government there suppressed unions. The government commissioned report by Roy Goode on Pension Law Reform confirmed the view that trustees may have an <b>ethical</b> <b>investment</b> policy and use their discretion in following it. The modern approach in trust law is consistent with the UK company law duty of directors to pay regard to all stakeholders, not merely shareholders, in a company's management. Trustees must simply invest according to general principles of the duty of care, and diversification.|$|E

Purpose: To evaluate whether Shariah-compliant indexes and/or socially responsible indexes can improve financial performance {{of an investment}} portfolio. Sub-problem: What kind of relationship exists between socially responsible investments and faith-based investments, represented by Shariah-compliant investments? Sub-purpose: To discover how two types of <b>ethical</b> <b>investments,</b> socially-responsible and Shariah-compliant, are related. Method: Quantitative study, covering three types of investment styles of four index families {{during the period from}} 2000 until 2011.

Conclusions: Conventional, socially responsible, and Shariah-compliant indexes do not have any significant differences in financial performance on a global basis. However, Shariah-compliant indexes could slightly over-perform conventional and socially responsible indexes during financial downturns. In the same time socially responsible indexes were noticed to be the most volatile during the whole period of study, to compare with conventional and Shariah-compliant.

40|$|Socially Responsible Investment (SRI) {{funds have}} been shown to underperform, {{primarily}} due to restricting their investments to a subset of the universe of investable assets. Rapid growth of SRI funds implies that there is a growing segment within the investment community who are willing to accept lower returns than the unrestricted investors. However, it also follows that investors' utility derived from <b>ethical</b> <b>investments</b> perhaps reflects an added dimension, or an ethical premium, that compensates them for this underperformance. This research questions whether investors, on average, would remain committed to <b>ethical</b> <b>investments</b> in the face of decreasing wealth. We attempt to answer this question, by first observing the differences between an ethical portfolio and (un) ethical portfolio, created by using assets that are deemed uninvestable by ethical screens. Using market and style associated risk filtered premiums, we find that (i) increased demand for ethical assets results in a decrease in demand for non-ethical assets, and (ii) poor past market performance, that leads to general wealth decreases, results in increased demand for unethical assets and decreased demand for ethical assets...|$|R

40|$|This thesis centers {{itself around}} {{the debate between}} the danish pension fund MP Pension and its members. From a {{historical}} point of view, there will be drawn parallels from the dynamic progression of the field business ethics {{as a response to}} globalization in relation to the term “ethical investments” onto the case debate and the academic discussions within the field of business ethics concerning the social responsibilities of businesses {{on the basis of the}} argumentation of Milton Friedman and Karsten Klint Jensen. The objective is to understand why the debate is problematic from an ethical point of view and what consequences the ethical point of view of the fund has on the society. To achieve this, a definition of the term <b>ethical</b> <b>investments</b> will be sought by definitions today in the form of ethical profiles and the arguments presented by the parties in the case debate. In the process, two theories of morality, utilitarianism and deontology, will be applied to the case in terms of illustrating the ethical dilemma of the case debate and its relations to the academic discussion concerning the social responsibility of businesses. The conclusion of the project is that the definition of <b>ethical</b> <b>investments</b> is connected to the discussion of the social responsibilities of businesses and therefore not simple to define. In addition, it is concluded that the ethical point of view of the fund results in an important debate concerning an unsolved ethical problem now and in the near future...|$|R
40|$|The {{current study}} compares motives {{to invest in}} {{accordance}} with socially responsible criteria among different groups of investors. In total, 60 employees from 19 investment institutions, 453 private investors and 71 institutional investors participated in a questionnaire study. While socially responsible investment (SRI) among private and institutional investors was guided by self-transcendent values (environmental and social values), {{this was not the}} case among fund managers working in investment institutions. Fund managers in investment institutions were affected by beliefs about long‐term returns of SRI. Private investors were, in addition, influenced by beliefs about long‐term returns, whereas institutional investors were motivated by an effort to reduce financial risks. Finally, investment institutions tended to overrate the importance of financial returns among their beneficiaries (private and institutional beneficiaries) and underestimate the importance of ethical, environmental and social aspects for beneficiaries. The results indicate that private and institutional investors/beneficiaries give a wider interpretation of fiduciary duty than investment institutions do.
