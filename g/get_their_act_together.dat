5|$|Walsh {{identified}} drinks as {{the central}} Diageo business, and began selling off assets that did not fit this model. He sold Pillsbury to General Mills in 2001 for $10.1 billion, and Burger King to the private equity firm Texas Pacific Group in 2002 for $1.5 billion. He suggested {{that he would have}} liked to have sold Burger King earlier, but was worried about Diageo's capacity to handle both transactions simultaneously. In a strategy to bolster Diageo's drinks sales, in 2001 he acquired the Seagram drinks business from Vivendi Universal in conjunction with Pernod Ricard for $8.2 billion, an action that was later credited with refocusing and re-energising Diageo. At the time, analysts suggested that Walsh had overpaid, and that Pernod Ricard had gained control of the better brands. Despite having entered into an alliance with Pernod in order to avoid regulatory issues, Diageo was still forced to divest the Malibu Rum brand after acquiring Captain Morgan. Walsh defended the deal on the basis of efficiency savings and the fact that the deal was almost entirely financed by the sale of Pillsbury. Of the acquisition he says:We moved in on that Seagram deal and forced their hand very quickly while our competitors were still trying to <b>get</b> <b>their</b> <b>act</b> <b>together.</b> If you look at what we paid it will go down in history as the bargain of the century. It was an $8.1bn total price of which our part was about $5.6bn and it was at economic profit break even at the end of year two. It’s produced phenomenal returns. If you look at Pernod’s Allied Domecq acquisition, it is 30 per cent higher in multiple terms and you’re not getting as good a collection of brands.|$|E

Their replay in Newry will go down as an Ulster Championship classic. Down appeared to be heading for the semi finals of the Ulster Championship, but a late scoring surge for Tryone (mostly Tommy McGuigan) got them back in it and a late free forced extra- time.

A last minute victory over Millwall was a vital win against a promotion rival and with the arrival of Dadason it seemed that Stoke could continue their push for an automatic position but two truly awful defeats in the FA and League Cup saw the feeling around the club drop and after a 3-1 defeat at home to bottom of the table Luton Town there was a major danger that those results could affect their league form.

40|$|We {{investigate}} time-varying {{credit risk}} information {{flow from the}} CDS market {{to the stock market}} for 302 U. S. firms between July 2004 and August 2010. Using the Acharya and Johnson (2007) measure, we find that CDS trading becomes informative for an increasing number of firms as we approach the GFC. The number of firms gradually decline as we move away from the height of the GFC, but remains high compared to the pre-GFC period. More interestingly, CDS trading is most informative conditional on recent downgraded, regardless of rating level. This finding holds during and after the GFC, but not before. Our paper offers two implications. First, despite post-GFC outcry against the CDS market, its informational role is enhanced during the GFC. Second, our results support criticism that rating agencies display strong inertia in downgrading firms in the lead-up to the GFC. However, if downgrade decisions during and after the GFC induce informed trading in the CDS market, this necessarily implies that {{in the midst of the}} GFC, rating agencies have <b>gotten</b> <b>their</b> <b>act</b> <b>together...</b>|$|R

The songs on the 1982 tape found their way onto different compilations, but were initially never put on vinyl. The big turnaround for the band was when the song Nitad was played on the alternative radio show Ny Våg (meaning New Wave) that was broadcast on National Radio all over Sweden. The requests for them started dropping in and a series of chaotic gigs saw to that their reputation grew; they were an exhaustive live act and always up for some good mischief. But along with success came tearings in the band and soon Fjalle departed, being replaced by Tobbe on the vocals. Tobbe, who had had some minor success in a local Malmö punk act called Hjärnsubstans was chaotic and disorderly enough to fit into the band. The year is now 1983 and the Mark II setting is here.|$|E

5000|$|Capon {{described}} {{himself in the}} introduction to one of his books as an “old-fashioned high churchman and a Thomist to boot.” One of Capon’s primary themes is the radical grace of God. Capon summarizes his broad view of salvation as follows: I am and I am not a universalist. I am one if you are talking about what God in Christ has done to save the world. The Lamb of God has not taken away the sins of some — of only the good, or the cooperative, or the select few who can manage to <b>get</b> <b>their</b> <b>act</b> <b>together</b> and die as perfect peaches. He has taken away the sins of the world — of every last being in it — and he has dropped them down the black hole of Jesus’ death. On the cross, he has shut up forever on the subject of guilt: [...] "There is therefore now no condemnation[...] [...] [...]" [...] All human beings, at all times and places, are home free whether they know it or not, feel it or not, believe it or not.But I am not a universalist if you are talking about what people may do about accepting that happy-go-lucky gift of God’s grace. I take with utter seriousness everything that Jesus had to say about hell, including the eternal torment that such a foolish non-acceptance of his already-given acceptance must entail. All theologians who hold Scripture to be the Word of God must inevitably include in their work a tractate on hell. But I will not — because Jesus did not — locate hell outside the realm of grace. Grace is forever sovereign, even in Jesus' parables of judgment. No one is ever kicked {{out at the end of}} those parables who wasn’t included in at the beginning.|$|E

40|$|Contraceptive sex,” wrote {{social science}} {{researcher}} Mary Eberstadt in 2012, “is the fundamental social fact of our time. ” In this important and pointed book, Charles E. Rice, of the Notre Dame Law School, makes the novel {{claim that the}} acceptance of contraception is a prelude to persecution. He makes the striking point that contraception is not essentially about sex. It is a First Commandment issue: Who is God? It was at the Anglican Lambeth Conference of 1930 when {{for the first time}} a Christian denomination said that contraception could ever be a moral choice. The advent of the Pill in the 1960 s made the practice of contraception practically universal. This involved a massive displacement of the Divine Law as a normative measure of conduct, not only on sex but across the board. Nature abhors a vacuum. The State moved in to occupy the place formerly held by God as the ultimate moral Lawgiver. The State put itself on a collision course with religious groups and especially with the Catholic Church, which continues to insist on that traditional teacher. A case in point is the Obama Regime’s Health Care Mandate, coercing employees to provide, contrary to conscience, abortifacients and contraceptives to their employees. The first chapter describes that Mandate, which the Catholic bishops have vowed not to obey. Rice goes on to show that the duty to disobey an unjust law that would compel you to violate the Divine Law does not confer a general right to pick and choose what laws you will obey. The third chapter describes the “main event,” which is the bout to determine whether the United States will conform its law and culture to the homosexual (LGBTQ) lifestyle in all its respects. “The main event is well underway and LGBTQ is well ahead on points. ” Professor Rice follows with a clear analysis of the 2013 Supreme Court decision on same-sex marriage. Part II presents some “underlying causes” of the accelerating persecution of the Catholic Church. The four chapter headings in this part outline the picture: The Dictatorship of Relativism; Conscience Redefined; The Constitution: Moral Neutrality; and The Constitution: Still Taken Seriously? The answer to the last question, as you might expect, is: No. Part III, the controversial heart of the book, presents contraception as “an unacknowledged cause” of persecution. The first chapter argues that contraception is not just a “Catholic issue. ” The next chapter describes the “consequences” of contraception and the treatment of women as objects. The third chapter spells out in detail the reality that contraception is a First Commandment issue and that its displacement of God as the ultimate moral authority opened the door for the State to assume that role, bringing on a persecution of the Church. The last chapter, “A Teaching Untaught,” details the admitted failure of the American Catholic bishops to teach Pope Paul VI’s 1968 encyclical, Humanae Vitae. But Rice offers hope that the bishops are now <b>getting</b> <b>their</b> <b>act</b> <b>together</b> Part IV offers as a “response” to the persecution of the Church three remedies: Speak the Truth with clarity and charity; Trust God; and, most important, Pray. As the last sentence in the book puts it: “John Paul II wrote in a letter to U. S. bishops in 1993 : ‘America needs much prayer – lest it lose its soul. ’” This readable and provocative book is abundantly documented with a detailed index of names and subjects. [URL]...|$|R

40|$|Hornbook {{constitutional}} law establishes that Congress and state legislatures are bodies of limited, enumerated powers, {{and common sense}} suggests they should <b>get</b> <b>their</b> <b>act</b> <b>together</b> and exercise them more often. But should legislators be permitted to sue in order to exercise their powers when another branch of government infringes on them unconstitutionally, or the body they represent unconstitutionally limits them? This Note argues that, at least in certain circumstances, they should. Following {{on the heels of}} the Tenth Circuit’s recent treatment of the issue in its Kerr v. Hickenlooper decisions, this Note proposes a redefinition of the legislator standing doctrine under which legislators can sue to remedy unconstitutional infringement of specific, enumerated powers. In doing so, this Note argues that prudential concerns that have historically barred legislators from suing should be disregarded, not only because the Supreme Court signaled as much in Lexmark International, Inc. v. Static Control Components, Inc., but also because these concerns are normatively ill considered. Rather, tying legislators’ injuries in fact to enumerated powers better aligns standing for legislators with standing for everyone else, while helping ensure courts are not stuck hearing suits they cannot and should not hear...|$|E

After briefly setting out the framework for economic policy coordination established since Maastricht, it sheds light on the Lisbon strategy’s problem-laden legacy for the Europe 2020 strategy (2011 - 2020) : the issues of non-binding member state commitment to an EU-wide reform agenda, and of member state failure to create sufficient ownership of reform. The article then examines the workings of the Europe 2020 strategy – the EU’s economic and institutional modernisation strategy for the current decade – with regard to structural reform especially in the Eurozone. It addresses the question of the effectiveness of the European semester process in light of the sovereign debt crisis. The article concludes that the Europe 2020 strategy’s approach continues to be valid in the EU context, but that for the strategy to deliver member states must <b>get</b> <b>their</b> <b>act</b> <b>together</b> and create ownership of reform for national adjustment capacit...|$|E
40|$|Despite {{the waves}} of {{globalisation}} that are roaring across the world, the older notion of 'regionalisation' is gaining favour amongst policy makers on all continents. This time, it appears that regionalisation is being promoted as a defensive reaction to the damage that unfettered globalisation is wreaking on weaker economies and societies. Increased regional cooperation, so people argue, could {{be a way to}} strengthen a sector, such as agriculture, before it is fully exposed to the world's market-place. But regionalisation in most ACP countries and regions has not become the powerful force predicted. Dreams can come true, but is regionalisation destined to remain an illusion? The Secretary-General of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD), Rubens Ricupero, characterised regionalisation as 'An implicit 'insurance policy' for the developing countries in case globalisation and liberalisation produce undesirable consequences', and {{as one of the most}} hotly debated international topics in recent years. Of course, the topic does not concern developing countries alone. Quite the contrary, economic and political cooperation within Europe is still drawing the attention of people from all over the world. For developing countries, however, it may be more of a matter of life and death than it is for the rich, industrialised nations. For ACP countries it is especially relevant, as negotiations proceed on the future of the Lomé Convention. Regional integration in the South presented itself as an issue as early as three decades ago, but for a long time it was often more of an ambition than a political reality. How long, for instance, did it take the Organization of African Unity to prepare its members for an African Economic Community? (The Treaty establishing this Community finally entered into force in 1994.) In the Caribbean and the Pacific the sheer lack of infrastructure in itself was an enormous obstacle preventing integration from materialising. After all, most small nations in these regions had closer relations with former colonial powers overseas than with each other. In the current debate on regionalisation in the South a distinction is made between old and new regionalism. The former is considered to have been an aim in itself, when developing countries refused to join either party in the Cold War that was then raging. The latter is seen much more as an instrument, particularly in order to adjust in one way or another to the globalisation processes underway. At any rate regionalism is not just a matter of increasing trade, but has a clear security dimension and touches on development in the broadest sense of the word. An attractive strategy or the excluded In a conference on regional integration in November of last year in The Hague, Professor Björn Hettne of Sweden's University of Göteborg pointed out that the 'basic problem with globalisation is that it is uneven and selective'. As a result, he said, the benefits for some are balanced by misery, conflict and violence for others and in the longer run these negative features pose a threat to all humanity. Against the background of such uncertainties, regionalism is become a strategy to achieve security and development for those excluded by globalisation. Regionalism as a strategy is especially attractive to the so-called 'peripheral' regions, which are politically turbulent and economically stagnant. Their regional arrangements, however, reflect the weaknesses of their state structures and civil institutions. Here regionalism can only work once the nations involved have come to grips with domestic violence and poverty. No wonder they tend to interpret regionalism in a protectionist way. In 'intermediate regions' the character of regionalism is more open. These regions are at present closely linked to one of the three 'core regions', which are Europe, North America and East Asia. The nations in an intermediate region try to conform to the criteria of being part of a core region, which are sustained economic development and political stability. As they succeed in these efforts, they gradually get incorporated into the core. ACP countries constitute partly peripheral and partly intermediate regions. The Caribbean as a whole is considered to be part of an intermediate region that is becoming 'North Americanised', although the Mercosur bloc in the 'cone' of South America (which comprises Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay) may put up some resistance to the neoliberalism prevalent in North America. In the Pacific, especially the southern part, there is a clear tendency of nations being drawn into the core region of East Asia, but at the same time this is counter-balanced by the risk of sinking into the periphery. Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), Southern and, to a lesser extent, West Africa have the potential to emerge as intermediate regions. William Lyakurwa, Deputy Director of the African Economic Research Consortium, Kenya, considers that 'There is a window of opportunity for sub-Saharan Africa to use regional integration as a supranational mechanism to foster national policy credibility, and as a means for pooling risks between otherwise vulnerable small economies; to resolve conflicts and minimise political risks; to exploit complementarities; and to develop regionally-based links on a reciprocal and mutually beneficial basis. ' A lot depends, however, on short-term developments in Eastern Africa, South Africa and Nigeria. The rest of SSA seems likely to remain in the periphery for an indefinite period of time. A fair chance to compete? In the North, the attitude towards regional cooperation in the South is generally positive, provided the governments of the South do not aim at achieving some sort of collective self-reliance in their respective regions. Integration of developing countries in the world economy has always been, and still is, the primary objective of the countries in the core regions, as the European Commission made clear in its Green Paper on relations between the European Union and the ACP countries on the eve of the 21 st century (1997). The big questions are: on what terms are developing countries allowed to feature more prominently on the world stage and which role shall be assigned to them? Are they really getting a chance of developing into equal partners, as the rhetoric from the dominant economic powers easily asserts? Or is globalisation merely designed to condemn them to a permanent second-rank position, where their primary functions are to serve as an outlet and dumping place for goods and services from the core regions, and as a source of relatively cheap inputs including manpower? For the time being the multilateral system, in which nearly all nations take part, is not working in favour of the poor countries. Recent developments in the fields of international finance have made it abundantly clear that the interests of the backbenchers in the world economy are not on the agenda of the powers that be and that even newly industrialising nations run the risk of being set back suddenly (e. g. the Asian crisis). These events once more point to the need for developing countries themselves to <b>get</b> <b>their</b> <b>act</b> <b>together,</b> which requires more effort than ever to make South-South cooperation work. More realistic food security An issue that is especially relevant to ACP countries is food security. So far, the advocates of globalisation and liberalisation have not been able to prove that their objectives are compatible with the basic need of food security on the lowest possible level. No wonder the South-North Centre in Lisbon clearly stated in a paper for the 1996 World Food Summit that 'at regional and inter-regional level greater South-South cooperation could contribute substantially to greater food security'. The strongest regional grouping within the ACP group, the Southern African Development Community (SADC), is well-known for the role it plays in regional food security. Percy S. Mistry, Chairman of the Oxford International Group: 'For the region to achieve and retain food self-sufficiency, the production of maize and other cereals must shift from the irrigated, semi-arid areas of the South African veldt to higher potential rain-fed areas further north in Angola, Zambia, northern Zimbabwe, Malawi, northern Mozambique and southern Tanzania, where regular rainfall is higher (despite droughts) as is soil fertility and water retention capacity. A regional rather than a national approach to this critical strategic challenge faced by SADC would permit the settlement of new land areas in a manner which reconciled meeting the food requirements of the region with the imperative of addressing thorny and urgent land reform and redistribution problems in South Africa and Zimbabwe. ' Better be sustainable The concept of sustainable development represents another example that underlines the need for regional integration. Again, the macro-economic policy twins of globalisation and liberalisation have never been seriously tested on their compatibility with this concept, as it was adopted by the world community in the 1992 Rio conference on environment and development. One feature of globalisation as it works at present is increasing mobility, of goods and people. The consequences for the environment are not incorporated in transportation costs, neither at the producer's nor the consumer's end. It would make sense to ensure that raw materials are ? at least partly ? processed as near the source as possible instead of being shipped to the other end of the world to be processed and returned again as finished products. Peter B. Robinson, Zimconsult, Zimbabwe: 'In the realm of natural resource management and tourism, properly conceived regional cooperation has considerable potential to contribute to sustainable growth'. In terms of environmentally-friendly criteria, regional integration is good in so far as it enables a group of countries to build a collective fully-fledged economy and change limited domestic markets into a large common market. Regional cooperation among groups of ACP countries is bound to be discussed, as the future relationship between them and the European Union takes shape. It is to be hoped that in this context the advantages of such cooperation in itself get sufficient attention, even though the political incentives are minimal. As Alieu Jeng, Principal Economist at the African Development Bank explains: 'It is easy for integration agreements to be violated because there is no constituency back home to whom the politician is accountable. He is not required to answer to his people and explain why he has opted out of an integration. To hold the politician accountable, the integration arrangement and the issues related to it have to be extensively discussed and the people have to be informed. ' No one should take for granted that regionalism must be a stepping stone to full integration in the world market. In fact, it could ? with commitment ? provide an alternative to the dogma of globalisation which, as all things mortal, will one day wither and die. Despite {{the waves of}} globalisation that are roaring across the world, the older notion of 'regionalisation' is gaining favour amongst policy makers on all continents.
