30|$|Historically, the {{increasing}} use of <b>fixed-term</b> <b>contracts</b> in France coincided with rising youth unemployment. The reason why a strict separation between permanent and temporary jobs may create additional unemployment is quite obvious. As terminating an open-ended contract is expensive and accompanied by legal complexity which causes great uncertainty, French firms increasingly rely on <b>fixed-term</b> <b>contracts.</b> This type of employment is much easier to handle, and therefore firms are adopting it more and more. Many firms therefore “turn” towards short, or even very short, <b>fixed-term</b> <b>contracts.</b> Therefore, often in between two <b>fixed-term</b> <b>contracts,</b> workers register as unemployed. However, finding a new job takes time, especially when the public employment service is poorly equipped to cope with the permanent inflow of job seekers. Thus, the intensive use of <b>fixed-term</b> <b>contracts</b> tends to inflate unemployment figures. <b>Fixed-term</b> <b>contracts</b> moreover only act as stepping stones towards permanent contracts for qualified workers (Junod, 2006). This causes related problems. For example, workers on <b>fixed-term</b> <b>contracts</b> encounter difficulties finding accommodation or to obtain a mortgage since workers with permanent contracts are preferred.|$|R
30|$|The {{wage and}} {{employment}} responses of natives under <b>fixed-term</b> <b>contracts</b> to immigration are the opposite. The baseline estimate {{indicates that a}} 10  % increase {{in the size of}} a skill group due to immigration reduces the monthly wage of natives under <b>fixed-term</b> <b>contracts</b> by around 9  %. 6 As <b>fixed-term</b> <b>contracts</b> have a short duration and terminate at no cost, firms tend to use them as a tool to achieve labor cost flexibility. Moreover, I show that immigration has a negative impact on their fraction of time worked—i.e., the decline in wages experienced by the native workers under <b>fixed-term</b> <b>contracts</b> encourages them to reduce their hours of work. However, I do not find evidence of a negative impact of immigration on the employment rate of competing native workers under <b>fixed-term</b> <b>contracts.</b> This result suggests that native workers under <b>fixed-term</b> <b>contracts</b> only respond to negative wage variations at the intensive margin.|$|R
40|$|This study {{deals with}} the effect of <b>fixed-term</b> <b>contracts</b> on work-related training. Though {{previous}} studies found a negative effect of <b>fixed-term</b> <b>contracts</b> on the participation in training, from the theoretical point of view {{it is not clear}} whether workers with <b>fixed-term</b> <b>contracts</b> receive less or more training, compared to workers with permanent contracts. In addition to the existing strand of literature, we especially distinguish between employer- and employee-financed training in order to allow for diverging investment patterns of worker and firm. Using data from the German Socio-Economic Panel (GSOEP), we estimate a bivariate probit model to control for selection effects that may arise from unobservable factors, affecting both participation in training and holding <b>fixed-term</b> <b>contracts.</b> Finding negative effects for employer-sponsored, as well as for employee-sponsored training, leads us to conclude that workers with <b>fixed-term</b> <b>contracts</b> do not compensate for lower firm investments. training, <b>fixed-term</b> <b>contracts,</b> bivariate probit model...|$|R

30|$|The {{negative}} wage {{reaction of}} native workers under <b>fixed-term</b> <b>contracts</b> due to immigration {{is consistent with}} the IV estimates presented in column (2): immigration has a negative impact on the fraction of time worked by native workers under <b>fixed-term</b> <b>contracts.</b> As immigration decreases monthly wages, native workers tend to respond at the intensive margin by reducing their hours of work. However, I find that immigration does not reduce the employment of competing natives under <b>fixed-term</b> <b>contracts</b> (the estimated coefficients in columns (3) and (4) are insignificant and have moreover an unexpected sign). This result suggests that the labor supply of natives under <b>fixed-term</b> <b>contracts</b> is not responsive to wages at the extensive margin—i.e., native workers under <b>fixed-term</b> <b>contracts</b> prefer to reduce their number of hours worked rather than to leave their jobs after wage reductions.|$|R
30|$|I {{find that}} {{immigration}} has no wage {{impact on the}} population of native workers under indefinite-term contracts, whereas it reduces the wages of the native population under <b>fixed-term</b> <b>contracts.</b> This asymmetric wage impact indicates that the wages of workers under <b>fixed-term</b> <b>contracts</b> can be manipulated by firms to adjust labor cost. Since <b>fixed-term</b> <b>contracts</b> have a short duration and they terminate at no cost, they provide firms with a scope for wage adjustment: firms hire the new employees at lower wages than those who terminated their <b>fixed-term</b> <b>contracts.</b> The labor turnover on indefinite-term contracts is lower, particularly because most hiring occurs on <b>fixed-term</b> <b>contracts.</b> In addition, workers under indefinite-term contracts {{tend to be more}} protected—they have higher reservation wages and are more unionized. As a result, firms are unable to lower the wage of the native population covered by indefinite-term contracts.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} labor market {{transitions}} and especially on those involving <b>fixed-term</b> <b>contracts.</b> Our contribution is twofold: first, we provide an accurate measure of labor market transitions {{and focus on}} transitions from <b>fixed-term</b> <b>contracts</b> to open-ended contracts or unemployment (dealing with the "stepping-stone or dead-end" question); second, we analyze the potential incentive effect of <b>fixed-term</b> <b>contracts</b> on effort. To deal with unobserved heterogeneity, we use a dynamic multinomial logit with fixed effects. We estimate the model on the French Labor Force Survey (2002 - 2008) which provides detailed information on quarterly transitions. We construct an indicator of effort for fixed-term workers based on a compared weekly working time. We find that <b>fixed-term</b> <b>contracts</b> provide slightly better perspectives than unemployment. However, we don't find evidence of any significant impact of working more on the probability of getting an open-ended <b>contract.</b> <b>Fixed-term</b> <b>contracts,</b> effort, transitions...|$|R

30|$|As {{explained}} in Section  2.1, one {{important source of}} wage rigidities in France lies {{in the type of}} job contracts. Being less protected and more subject to labor turnover, the population of native workers under <b>fixed-term</b> <b>contracts</b> should have a wage structure that is less rigid than those under indefinite-term contracts. Thus, an immigrant-induced increase in labor supply should reduce the wage of competing native workers under <b>fixed-term</b> <b>contracts.</b> The employment reaction of the native population under <b>fixed-term</b> <b>contracts</b> should then depend on their labor supply elasticity.|$|R

The employment response of establishments to changing net employment expectations for the short-run is, primarily, suggestive of their reliance on <b>fixed-term</b> <b>contracts</b> as a buffer to cushion short-run changes in demand as well as to shield permanent workers from downward workforce adjustments. In contrast, their response to changes in net employment expectations for the long-run mostly hints on the use of <b>fixed-term</b> <b>contracts</b> as a screening device. Therefore, policies providing financial incentives to convert <b>fixed-term</b> into permanent <b>contracts</b> –thus targeting firms’ using <b>fixed-term</b> <b>contracts</b> as a screening device, are likely to only have limited effectiveness. ...|$|R

40|$|In the mid- 1980 s, several European countries, {{characterized}} by {{high levels of}} employment protection, introduced <b>fixed-term</b> <b>contracts.</b> Since then most accessions to employment have been through <b>fixed-term</b> <b>contracts.</b> This paper studies the duration pattern of <b>fixed-term</b> <b>contracts</b> and the determinants of their conversion into permanent ones in Spain, {{a country in which}} the share of fixed-term employment is the highest in Europe. We estimate a duration model for temporary employment, with competing risks of terminating into permanent employment versus alternative states, and flexible duration dependence. We find that the shape of the baseline hazard is suggestive of two possible uses of <b>fixed-term</b> <b>contracts</b> by employers. First, there is a clear, pronounced spike at 3 years of duration, coinciding with the legal maximum duration of these contracts, suggesting that some <b>fixed-term</b> <b>contracts</b> are only converted into permanent ones when {{there is no other way}} to retain the worker. Second, there is a spike around 1 year of duration, which supports the idea that some of these contracts are also used as a screening device.
