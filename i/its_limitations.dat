Developed by Digital Eclipse, {{it included}} emulated versions of Asteroids and other old Atari games. Jeff Gerstmann of GameSpot criticized the Dreamcast version for <b>its</b> <b>limitations,</b> {{such as the}} presentation of vector graphics on a low resolution television set, which obscures the copyright text in Asteroids. The arcade and Atari 2600 versions of Asteroids, along with Asteroids Deluxe, were included in Atari Anthology for both Xbox and PlayStation 2.|$|E
5|$|On 4 May 1702 (O.S.) England {{formally}} {{declared war}} on France. Marlborough was given command of the English, Dutch, and hired German forces, {{but he had not}} as yet commanded a large army in the field, and had far less experience than a dozen Dutch and German generals who must now work under him. His command had <b>its</b> <b>limitations,</b> however. As commander of Anglo-Dutch forces he had the power to give orders to Dutch generals only when their troops were in action with his own; at all other times he had to rely on his powers of tact and persuasion, and gain the consent of accompanying Dutch field deputies or political representatives of the States General. Nevertheless, despite his Allies' initial lassitude the campaign in the Low Countries (the war's principal theatre) began well for Marlborough. After outmanoeuvring Marshal Boufflers, he captured Venlo, Roermond, Stevensweert and Liège, for which in December a grateful Queen publicly proclaimed Marlborough a duke.|$|E

25|$|After the war, and in {{response}} to Roosevelt being elected to third and fourth terms, the Twenty-second Amendment was adopted. The amendment bars anyone from being elected president more than twice, or once if that person served more than half of another president's term. Harry S.

25|$|Piaget {{recognized}} that psychometric tests had <b>its</b> <b>limitations,</b> as {{children were not}} able to provide the researcher with their deepest thoughts and inner intellect. It was also difficult to know if the results of child examination reflected what children believed or if it is just a pretend situation. For example, {{it is very difficult to}} know with certainty if a child who has a conversation with a toy believes the toy is alive or if the child is just pretending.|$|E
25|$|Whole {{transcriptome}} {{shotgun sequencing}} (WTSS) {{is the latest}} in gene expression studies, using next generation sequencing (NGS) to quantify RNA in samples on a high throughput scale. As biology trends toward using RNA-seq over microarray analysis in evaluating the transcriptome, so does degradomics. The field adapts the approach to analyzing the presence and quantity of transcripts of proteases, their substrates, and their inhibitors. While developed microarrays remain a major workhorse in studying gene expression in degradomics, <b>its</b> <b>limitations</b> of cross hybridization and dynamic range issues suggest RNA-seq will take a larger role as costs decrease and analysis improves.|$|E

On a more {{philosophical}} level, Collins took a generally less cynical view of the justice system than Gould; Tracy came to accept <b>its</b> <b>limitations</b> and requirements as a normal part of the process which he could manage. Extreme technology was phased out, such as the Space Coupe, in favor of more realistic advanced tools such as the 2-Way Wrist Computer in 1987.|$|E
25|$|The {{modelling}} {{of schizophrenia}} in animals {{can range from}} attempts to imitate {{the full extent of}} symptoms found in schizophrenia, to more specific modelling which investigate the efficacy of antipsychotic drugs. Each extreme has <b>its</b> <b>limitations,</b> with whole-syndrome modelling often failing due to the complexity and heterogeneous nature of schizophrenia, and antipsychotic-specific modelling being often not useful for discovering drugs with unique mechanisms of action. Developing models based on a particular sign or symptom of schizophrenia has been one approach. This approach has the advantage that the results {{are more likely to be}} valid across the species boundary.|$|E
25|$|Bayesian {{decision}} theory {{can be used}} in looking at pricing decisions. Field information such as retail and wholesale prices as well as the size of the market and market share are all incorporated into the prior information. Managerial judgement is included in order to evaluate different pricing strategies. This method of evaluating possible pricing strategies does have <b>its</b> <b>limitations</b> as it requires a number of assumptions to be made about the market place in which an organisation operates. As markets are dynamic environments {{it is often difficult to}} fully apply Bayesian {{decision theory}} to pricing strategies without simplifying the model.|$|E

25|$|In 2016, Google {{introduced}} {{the ability to}} run Android apps on supported Chrome OS devices, {{with access to the}} entire Google Play Store. The previous Native Client-based solution was dropped in favor of a container containing Android's frameworks and dependencies (initially based on Android 6.0), which allows Android apps to have direct access to the Chrome OS platform, and allow the OS to interact with Android contracts such as sharing. Engineering director Zelidrag Hornung explained that ARC had been scrapped due to <b>its</b> <b>limitations,</b> including its incompatibility with the Android Native Development Toolkit (NDK), and that it was unable to pass Google's own compatibility test suite.|$|E
25|$|The NAALC {{supplement}} to NAFTA aimed {{to create a}} foundation for cooperation among the three members for the resolution of labor problems, {{as well as to}} promote greater cooperation among trade unions and social organizations in all three countries, in order to fight for the improvement of labor conditions. Though most economists agree {{that it is difficult to}} assess the direct impact of the NAALC, it is agreed that there has been a convergence of labor standards in North America. Given <b>its</b> <b>limitations,</b> however, NAALC has not produced (and in fact was not intended to achieve) convergence in employment, productivity and salary trend in North America.|$|E
25|$|While Ibn al-Ṣalāḥ {{arranged}} {{his work}} {{to a greater extent}} than previous authors on the subject, it had <b>its</b> <b>limitations</b> in organization because it began as a series of lectures. He did not arrange his book in a particular manner, in some cases mentioning a term related to the matn (text), before moving onto one related to the isnād (chain of narration), or perhaps mentioning types related to both. As a large number of students were present at his lectures, memorizing or transcribing them, he was subsequently unable to revise this order. Were he to have done so, the students original transcriptions might then differ with his revisions as some may have attended the original lectures and others the revised. The introduction of the book required an index to guide readers which illustrates the somewhat disorganized nature of his work.|$|E
