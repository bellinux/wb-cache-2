40|$|Effect of {{agitation}} on {{the rate}} of batch seeded emulsion copolymerization of styrene and <b>dodecyl</b> <b>methacrylate</b> is studied. In the conditions studied, increase in agitation rate did not affect {{the rate of}} polymerization of styrene, but increased the rate of polymerization of <b>dodecyl</b> <b>methacrylate.</b> This suggests that diffusion of sparingly water-soluble monomer, whose water-solubility is less than that of <b>dodecyl</b> <b>methacrylate,</b> from monomer droplets to the aqueous phase is ratedetermining step in emulsion copolymerization system including sparingly water-soluble monomer...|$|E
40|$|A {{series of}} {{amphiphilic}} networks was prepared by radical copolymerisation of <b>dodecyl</b> <b>methacrylate,</b> 2, 3 -propandiol- 1 -methacrylate and ethandiol dimethacrylate. DSC studies on these materials, swollen in water, revealed that only materials containing more than 27 wt% of water displayed melting endotherms {{due to the}} melting of ice-like structures of water (freezing water). In materials that did produce a melting endotherm the peak was generally bimodal. Changing thermal history and heating rate did not effect {{the shape of the}} two peaks, nor the relative contribution of each peak to the total endothermic response. These observations and the narrow peak width of the low temperature endotherm suggested that the bimodality was an artefact of the DSC experiment and {{may be due to the}} promotion of the glass transition once a fraction of the water has frozen. The morphology of transformed human dermal fibroblasts grown on these materials was then examined by scanning electron microscopy. Compositions that contained only non-freezing water were found to allow cell adhesion and spreading. Cells with well-spread morphologies were obtained on materials containing small fractions of freezing water and <b>dodecyl</b> <b>methacrylate.</b> These fibroblasts displayed surface features such as microvilli and filapodia. However, all compositions of poly(2, 3 -propandiol- 1 -methacrylate-co-ethandiol dimethacrylate) (i. e. hydrogels that do not contain <b>dodecyl</b> <b>methacrylate</b> repeat units) were poor substrates for cell growth and examination of these materials showed that very few cells had adhered and those that did were highly rounded...|$|E

Their amphiphilic star random copolymers with 10 - 50 mol% DMA efficiently self-folded in water with intramolecular hydrophobic interaction to form compact unimolecular micelles.

40|$|We {{report on}} the {{synthesis}} and characterization of three fully functionalized photorefractive polymethacrylates containing different chromophores. Carbazole- and NLO-functionalized methacrylate monomers in a 1 : 1 ratio were polymerized with 20 mol % of <b>dodecyl</b> <b>methacrylate</b> to obtain photorefractive polymers. The resulting polymers had glass transition temperatures of 48, 47, and 52 degrees C, respectively. Asymmetric two-beam-coupling and four-wave-mixing experiments at 780 nm and three different temperatures {{pointed out that the}} resulting polymers, doped with 1 wt % (2, 4, 7 -trinitro- 9 -fluorenylidene) malononitrile (TNFDM), showed good photorefractive properties.

40|$|Termination rate coefficients, kt, for the terpolymerization of {{mixtures}} {{containing the}} three acrylates: methyl, butyl, and dodecyl acrylate or the corresponding {{members of the}} methacrylate family: methyl, butyl, and <b>dodecyl</b> <b>methacrylate,</b> have been measured via the single pulse (SP) -PLP technique. In the homopolymerization {{of each of the}} six monomers an initial plateau region of almost constant kt is seen which extends at least up to 15 % and, for dodecyl acrylate and <b>dodecyl</b> <b>methacrylate,</b> even up to about 50 % monomer conversion. Terpolymerization kt in this region of low and moderate conversion is remarkably well described by a rather simple correlation which exclusively contains homopolymerization kt and the composition of the monomer mixture. This correlation turns out to be very useful for the modeling of kt in mixtures of monomers that exhibit such an initial plateau region of kt. For the systems under investigation, terpolymerization kt, may be estimated within ± 30 %. This finding is very remarkable in view of the enormous differences in homopolymerization kt, within each monomer family, e. g., kt, of methyl acrylate exceeds the corresponding dodecyl acrylate value by a factor of 50 (or 5000 %). The entire set of experiments has been carried out at 40 °C and 1000 bar where the signal to noise ratio of the laser-induced single pulse experiments is very satisfactory. No reason is seen why the conclusions about modeling of terpolymerization kt should not be valid at other reaction conditions including ambient pressure. © WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH, D- 69451 Weinheim 1999...|$|E
40|$|Latexes {{comprising}} novel copolymers {{were formed}} by second-stage emulsion polymerization of <b>dodecyl</b> <b>methacrylate</b> (DMA) onto a hydroxylated polybutadiene-based polyurethane prepolymer (PUD) as seed latex, with persulfate initiator. Morphology data from TEM imaging (including chemical fixation ultra-microtoming), glass transition temperature, dynamic mechanical analysis, and other mechanical-property data were all {{consistent with a}} system showing extensive grafting and compatibilization between the different polymeric components. Water adsorption and AFM measurements showed that samples with poorer film-forming properties had higher water sensitivity, greater mixing of the polymer phases, and poorer mechanical properties. These properties were related to a phase-inversion phenomenon occurring above a critical dodecyl methacrylate/prepolymer ratio. The compatibilization of the PUD and poly(DMA) given by these modifications resulted in a product with increased tackiness, although with a higher water sensitivity...|$|E
40|$|The {{self-organization}} {{of random}} copolymers {{composed of a}} nucleobase monomer (either 1 -(4 -vinylbenzyl) thymine or 9 -(4 -vinylbenzyl) adenine) and <b>dodecyl</b> <b>methacrylate</b> (DMA) was studied in dilute chloroform solutions. The balance between the molar fractions of the nucleobase monomer (leading to intermolecular H-bonding) and DMA (soluble moiety in chloroform) in the polymer chains {{was found to be}} the parameter that principally influences the self-organization. DMA-rich copolymers are molecularly soluble in chloroform, whereas nucleobase-rich copolymers are insoluble in this solvent. Copolymers possessing an equimolar comonomer composition self-assemble into micrometer-sized particles physically cross-linked by intermolecular H-bonds (either thymine-thymine or adenine-adenine interactions, depending on the studied copolymer). Nevertheless, when mixed together, thymine- and adenine-based colloids fuse into thermodynamically stable microspheres cross linked by adenine-thymine interactions...|$|E
40|$|Propagation rate {{coefficients}} (kp) for the free-radical polymerization of <b>dodecyl</b> <b>methacrylate</b> (DMA) in {{solution in}} toluene have been measured via {{electron spin resonance}} (ESR) spectroscopy in the temperature range O to 50 °C. The polymerization is photochemically induced at different initiator concentrations of di-tert-butyl peroxide (DTBP). Free-radical concentration under steady-state conditions is deduced from double integration of the well-resolved ESR spectra, consisting of 13 lines in the initial period of the polymerization reaction and 9 lines at enhanced degrees of monomer conversion. The kp values from ESR analysis are in excellent agreement with the corresponding data from pulsed laser polymerization (PLP) /size-exclusion chromatography (SEC), the IUPAC-recommended procedure for reliable kp measurement. The activation energy associated with the ESR kp data, EA = 21. 7 ± 2. 0 kJ mol- 1, is in full agreement with EA (kp) results from recent PLP-SEC studies...|$|E
40|$|Homogeneous {{copolymer}} latex {{particles of}} <b>dodecyl</b> <b>methacrylate</b> (DMA) and low-molecular-weight hydroxy-terminated polybutadiene (HTPB) oligomers were prepared by free-radical polymerization using miniemulsion methods. Rate data and latex characteristics {{were consistent with}} the classical miniemulsion mechanism where nucleation of monomer droplets is the predominant pathway of particle formation. There is essentially no particle formation by secondary nucleation in the water phase. Characterization of the copolymer latex particles using transmission electron microscopy and modulated differential scanning calorimetry suggested that there is a significant amount of grafted poly(DMA) /HTPB polymer contributing to the miscibility of the HTPB and poly(DMA) phases. Particles were more homogeneous at increased HTPB composition, of relatively narrow polydispersity, and could be prepared reproducibly using a number of different initiation systems. The observed trends can all be rationalized in terms of conventional understanding of miniemulsion polymerization systems. (C) 2004 Wiley Periodicals, Inc...|$|E
30|$|The article {{presents}} application of homo polymer of <b>dodecyl</b> <b>methacrylate</b> (DDMA) and its copolymers with vinyl acetate (VA) as multifunctional additives for lubricant formulation. Homo polymer of DDMA and five copolymers of DDMA with VA at different molar ratios were synthesized by free radical polymerization method using azobisisobutyronitrile (AIBN) as initiator. The {{characterization of the}} polymers was carried out through FTIR, NMR and GPC (gel permeable chromatography) analysis. The performance of all the polymers as viscosity index improver (VII) or viscosity modifier and pour point depressant (PPD) additive in two different base oils (mineral) were evaluated. The mechanism of action of the polymers as pour point depressant was studied by photo micrographic analysis. Rheological study of the formulated lubricant was also carried out and reported. The thermal stability of the polymers was determined by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). It was found that thermal stability, VI and molecular weights of copolymers are higher than the homopolymer which showed better PPD property.|$|E
40|$|A {{series of}} hydrogels {{composed}} of varying fractions of <b>dodecyl</b> <b>methacrylate</b> (DM) and 2, 3 -dihydroxypropyl methacrylate (GM) were prepared using {{ethylene glycol dimethacrylate}} (EGDMA) as the cross-linking agent. The study found that {{for a series of}} gels with the same monomer ratio, bulk hydration could be controlled by adjusting the cross-link density. The ability to control cross-link density allowed the preparation of gels with the same bulk hydration but different ratios of the two monomers. The adsorption of IgG to the gels was investigated using ELISA. The aim of the project was to investigate the effect of the bulk hydration and polymer composition on IgG adsorption. The results show that for a series of gels with the same monomer ratio, there is a clear trend towards a reduction in protein adsorption as the bulk hydration and accompanying chain mobility of the gel increases. Studies on gels of the same bulk hydration but differing ratios of monomer show higher protein adsorption as the proportion of GM increases...|$|E

40|$|Terpolymers of {{homogeneous}} composition {{were prepared}} by free radical copolymerization of butyl or <b>dodecyl</b> <b>methacrylate,</b> 1 H, 1 H, 2 H, 2 H-perfluorodecyl methacrylate and maleic anhydride using the continuous monomer addition technique. The copolymerization reactions were performed at 65 °C {{in the presence}} of azobisisobutyronitrile as an initiator in a mixture of methyl ethyl ketone and 1, 3 -bis (trifluoromethyl) benzene. The monomers and initiator are added to the reaction mixture with the same rate they are consumed in 5 - and 10 -fold excess compared to the initial monomer stock. The obtained terpolymers with molecular weights Mn = 50, 000 – 70, 000 are of uniform composition, close to the composition determined in low conversion experiments, proving the principle of the chosen concept. The kinetic data necessary for the design of the continuous addition experiment were obtained from binary copolymerization experiments at low monomer conversion (to avoid compositional drift). In addition, the so-called terpolymerization parameter was determined from ternary copolymerization experiments...|$|E
40|$|Single-chain {{crosslinked}} star polymers {{with multiple}} hydrophilic short arms and a hydrophobic core were created as novel microgel star polymers of single polymer chains. The synthetic process involves the intramolecular crosslinking of self-folding amphiphilic random copolymers in water. For this process, amphiphilic random copolymers bearing hydrophilic poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) and hydrophobic olefin pendants were synthesized by ruthenium-catalyzed living radical copolymerization of PEG methyl ether methacrylate, <b>dodecyl</b> <b>methacrylate</b> and hydroxyl-functionalized methacrylates, and the in situ or postesterification of the hydroxyl pendants {{of the resulting}} copolymers with methacryloyl chloride. The olefin-bearing copolymers with 20 – 40 [*]mol% hydrophobic units efficiently self-folded because of hydrophobic interactions in water. These folded structures were then crosslinked intramolecularly using a free radical initiator or a ruthenium catalyst to selectively yield single-chain crosslinked star polymers, whereas a counterpart containing 50 [*]mol% hydrophobic units induced bimolecular aggregation in water to give double-chain crosslinked star polymers. The primary structure of the star polymers can be precisely controlled with random copolymer precursors. Owing to the PEG arm units, the star polymers further showed thermosensitive solubility in water...|$|E

The copolymer composi-tion was determined from 1 H NMR spectra. The copolymerization reactivity ratios {{were found to be}} r 1 = 0. 52 (Sty) and r 2 = 0. 42 (DDMA) for the Sty–DDMA system, and r 1 = 0. 58 (Sty) and r 2 = 0. 45 (ODMA) for the Sty–ODMA system, showing a tendency toward ideal copolymerization reactions. The Q and e values were also calculated according to the Greenly method. The initial poly-merization rate, Rp, was found to be in the order ODMA> DDMA>> Sty and sharply decreased for both copolymerization systems as the content of Sty in the monomer mixture increased. Similar be-haviour was also recorded for the molecular weights and intrinsic viscosities of the copolymers as their values significantly decreased with increasing the Sty fraction in the monomer mixture. Polymer viscosity in toluene solution determined at 30 to 90 °C slightly in-creased with the temperature for homopolymers of the alkyl metha-crylates and reached the local maximum value at higher tempera-ture, showing a constant value for the polystyrene, whereas the co-polymer values were intermediate between those of homopolymers.

40|$|The {{ability to}} {{encapsulate}} hydrophobic ferrites in colloidal superparticle structures of an a-telechelic hexadecyl-functionalized poly(methacrylic acid) (C 16 H 33 -PMAA) polymer with a linear architecture was investigated and {{compared with that}} of two amphiphilic comb-type water-soluble copolymers, namely, P(ANa-co-DAAm) and P(MANa-co-DMA), which are comprised of a poly(sodium acrylate) or poly(sodium methacrylate) backbone and pendent dodecyl acrylamide or <b>dodecyl</b> <b>methacrylate</b> chains, respectively. In the case of C 16 H 33 -PMAA, the pH-sensitive self-assembly behavior, which was studied through Nile Red probing and TEM, was related to its encapsulation properties. Hydrophobic MFe 2 O 4 nanoparticles coated with oleylamine (MFe 2 O 4 @OAm MNPs, where M = Co, Mn, Ni) with a similar shape and size (similar to 9 nm) and magnetization values of 87. 4, 63. 1 and 55. 0 emu g(- 1) for CoFe 2 O 4 @OAm, MnFe 2 O 4 @OAm and NiFe 2 O 4 @OAm, respectively, were successfully encapsulated into the hydrophobic cores of spherical micellar structures formed by the copolymers in an aqueous solution through a solvent mixing procedure. The synthesized magnetic colloidal superparticles fell in the static dephasing regime (SDR). NMR relaxivity measurements of MFe 2 O 4 @P(ANa-co-DAAm), MFe 2 O 4 @P(MANa-co-DMA) and MFe 2 O 4 @C 16 H 33 -PMAA at pH = 4. 5 and pH = 7 (where M = Co, Mn, Ni) at 11. 7 T were recorded and the transverse relaxivity (r(2)) (mM(- 1) s(- 1)) was determined. Among all, the CoFe 2 O 4 @polymers demonstrated the highest r(2) relaxivity values, ranging from 61. 6 for CoFe 2 O 4 @C 16 H 33 -PMAA (pH = 7) to 316. 0 mM(- 1) s(- 1) for CoFe 2 O 4 @P(ANa-co- DAAm). The relaxation efficiency (r(1) and r(2)) of CoFe 2 O 4 @P(ANa-co-DAAm) was investigated further by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at 1. 5 T and 3 T and the r(2) /r(1) ratios were found to be 16. 5 and 18. 2, respectively, indicating its potential use as a T- 2 contrast agent...|$|E
