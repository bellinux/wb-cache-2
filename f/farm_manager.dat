25|$|Karen Blixen and {{her husband}} were quite {{different}} in education and temperament, and Bror Blixen was unfaithful to his wife. She was diagnosed with syphilis toward the end of their first year of marriage in 1915. According to her biographer Judith Thurman, she contracted the disease from her husband. She returned to Denmark in June 1915 for treatment which proved successful. Although Blixen's illness was eventually cured (some uncertainty exists), it created medical anguish for years to come. By 1919, the marriage had run into serious difficulties, causing her husband to request a divorce in 1920. Against her wishes, the couple separated in 1921, and were officially divorced in 1925. Bror Blixen was dismissed as the <b>farm</b> <b>manager</b> by Aage Westenholz, chair of the Karen Coffee Company, and Karen Blixen took over its management in 1921.|$|E

He was the second of eight {{children}} of James Cook, a Scottish farm labourer from Ednam in Roxburghshire, and his locally born wife, Grace Pace, from Thornaby-on-Tees. In 1736, his family moved to Airey Holme farm at Great Ayton, where his father's employer, Thomas Skottowe, paid for him to attend the local school. In 1741, after five years' schooling, he began work for his father, who had been promoted to <b>farm</b> <b>manager.</b> For leisure, he would climb a nearby hill, Roseberry Topping, enjoying the opportunity for solitude. Cooks' Cottage, his parents' last home, which he is likely to have visited, is now in Melbourne, Australia, having been moved from England and reassembled, brick by brick, in 1934.|$|E
25|$|The {{estate of}} Pockerley Old Hall is {{presented}} {{as that of a}} well off tenant farmer, in a position {{to take advantage of the}} agricultural advances of the era. The hall itself consists of the Old House, which is adjoined (but not connected to) the New House, both south facing two storey sandstone built buildings, the Old House also having a small north-south aligned extension. Roof timbers in the sandstone built Old House have been dated to the 1440s, but the lower storey (the undercroft) may be from even earlier. The New House dates to the late 1700s, and replaced a medieval manor house to the east of the Old House as the main farm house - once replaced itself, the Old House is believed to have been let to the <b>farm</b> <b>manager.</b> Visitors can access all rooms in the New and Old House, except the north-south extension which is now a toilet block. Displays include traditional cooking, such as the drying of oatcakes over a wooden rack (flake) over the fireplace in the Old House.|$|E

500|$|The [...] "farmyard tale" [...] was {{dedicated}} to Betsy and Ralph Cannon, the children of Potter's <b>farm</b> <b>manager,</b> John Cannon. The children appear {{in one of the}} illustrations collecting Jemima's eggs from the rhubarb patch, and their mother is depicted in the opening picture feeding the barnyard fowl. Jemima was based upon a real world duck at Hill Top Farm who evaded Mrs. Cannon and her children in their attempts to locate her eggs before she mismanaged their incubation. Mrs. Cannon believed ducks made poor sitters, and routinely confiscated the ducks' eggs to allow the hens to incubate them. Potter may have taken inspiration from a drawing in her father's 1853 sketchbook of a flying duck wearing a bonnet. Potter almost certainly chose the name [...] "Jemima" [...] in honour of Jemima Blackburn, an ornithological painter and illustrator whose Birds from Nature she had received as a gift on her tenth birthday and whom she met in 1891.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a model of}} the farm management process. The model suggests that certain socioeconomic characteristics of <b>farm</b> <b>managers</b> will influence their decision-making process. Several characteristics are hypothesized an tested using multivariate techniques (multivariate analysis of variance, range tests, and multiple comparisons). The analysis indicates that the soil zone, value of machinery inventory, operator's age, and operator's education influence the importance placed on each of 20 factors. On the basis of the analysis it was concluded that such {{a model of the}} farm management process can contribute to an understanding of farm management decisions. In addition, it was concluded that <b>farm</b> <b>managers,</b> <b>farm</b> machinery dealers, and extension agents had significantly different perceptions of the importance of these factors to <b>farm</b> <b>managers.</b> This latter conclusion suggests that more research related to the actual process of decision making is warranted.

500|$|Though {{the tale}} has a happy ending, tearful Jemima is led {{back to the}} farm in public humiliation after losing her eggs to her hungry rescuers. She is allowed to hatch a brood on the farm, but it only {{produces}} four ducklings. [...] Potter's revision of [...] "Little Red Riding Hood" [...] more nearly resembles Perrault's tragic tale than the happily-ever-after Grimm version where the heroine is rescued by woodcutters. The author knew her young audience would sympathise with the unhatched ducklings and would not tolerate having Jemima, a mother figure, suffer a bloody end in the fox's shed. The loss of the eggs is sad for the reader, but Potter ended the tale as happily as possible– not only for her audience but {{for the sake of}} the real world children of her <b>farm</b> <b>manager,</b> Ralph and Betsy Cannon, to whom the tale was dedicated. Jemima is punished for her headstrong foolishness and must relinquish her hope of finding a nesting spot away from the farm, but the punishment is mitigated when she is allowed to hatch one brood herself.|$|E

2500|$|Once the {{gristmill}} {{was well}} established, Washington’s <b>farm</b> <b>manager,</b> James Anderson, suggested building a whiskey distillery {{adjacent to the}} mill. [...] When it was completed in 1797, the distillery was the largest in America. By 1799 it {{had become one of}} Washington’s most successful enterprises, producing 11,000 gallons of whiskey per year. A variety of whiskeys were produced at the site along with brandy and vinegar. The most common whiskey recipe used 60% rye, 35% corn, and 5% malted barley. Smaller amounts of rye whiskey were distilled up to four times and were more expensive. Some whiskey was also flavored with cinnamon. When rye was scarce the distillery used wheat. Apple, peach and persimmon brandies were also produced. The whiskey was marketed in Alexandria, Virginia, or shipped directly from Mount Vernon’s dock on the Potomac River. The distillery process produced a significant waste stream, which was fed to 150 cattle and 30 hogs that were kept at the site.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to examine how to {{introduce}} organic farming by means of a case study of Farm A, where organic rice farming has been carried out since the 1970 s. The following conclusions were obtained: (1) Farm A has been using original manure that has taken a long time to develop. Learning the proper method of fertilizer application has contributed to the stability of yields on Farm A. However, using original manure results in the increase in cost and work time. Organic <b>farm</b> <b>managers</b> should make up for the increase in their production costs by trading at a higher price. (2) Since <b>Farm</b> A's <b>manager</b> made organic rice production the main farming division, resources such as land, cropping patterns, labor, and machinery have been reorganized. The combination of skilled employees with a high - performance paddy field weeder has resulted in an improvement of weeding work time on Farm A. Organic <b>farm</b> <b>managers</b> should consider how to weed, because the size of the planted area on organic farms depends on weeding efficiency. (3) Organic <b>farm</b> <b>managers</b> have their own management philosophy. Consequently, the production costs for organic farming are higher than for conventional farming. Naturally, their management philosophy reflects not only the costs but also the products. In order for there to be a greater understanding, organic <b>farm</b> <b>managers</b> should inform consumers of their philosophies and their production costs. Through such a trial, an advantageous market indispensable to development of organic farming will be formed...|$|R
