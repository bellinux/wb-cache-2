Now this inquiry admits us to search into the things: First, How <b>it</b> <b>appears</b> <b>that</b> he hath power to save; Second, How <b>it</b> <b>appears</b> <b>that</b> he hath power to cast out.|$|R

Although {{the details of his}} second {{marriage}} remain vague, <b>it</b> <b>appears</b> <b>that</b> Warner and Stoddard separated in 1893. <b>It</b> <b>appears</b> <b>that</b> the couple may have had one child, Maud, but there is little information available about her.|$|R
5|$|The new Parliament met in 1904 {{and reached}} a compromise, {{choosing}} Dalgety, which, like Bombala, {{was located in}} the Monaro region. Thus, {{with the passage of}} the Seat of Government Act 1904, <b>it</b> <b>appeared</b> <b>that</b> the matter had been settled. However, while the Federal Parliament supported Dalgety, the New South Wales government did not, and they proved unwilling to cede the amount of territory the Federal Government demanded.|$|E
5|$|When Manchester City {{returned}} to the Premier League for the 2000–01 season, <b>it</b> <b>appeared</b> <b>that</b> Dickov's chances of playing would be limited as City signed former FIFA World Player of the Year George Weah and Costa Rican international Paulo Wanchope. However, Dickov earned {{a place in the}} team, his performances attracting the attention of Scotland manager Craig Brown, who called him up to the Scotland squad for the first time.|$|E
5|$|At {{some point}} during the 1990s, <b>it</b> <b>appeared</b> <b>that</b> Jackson had become {{dependent}} on prescription drugs, mainly painkillers and strong sedatives. The drug use was later linked to second- and third-degree burns he had suffered years before. As more and more difficulty emerged in his life, he gradually became dependent on these drugs, and his health deteriorated. He went into rehabilitation in 1993 with the help of Elizabeth Taylor and Elton John.|$|E
50|$|Some {{conservatives have}} {{remained}} {{loyal to the}} Diocese, but <b>it</b> <b>appears</b> <b>that</b> {{the balance of power}} now rests with a coalition of liberals and moderates. <b>It</b> <b>appears</b> <b>that</b> most of the forementioned controversies within the Diocese have been laid to rest, with no expectations of future schismatic activity.|$|R

5|$|Besides the Conservatives' {{ties to the}} CPR, Rutherford's Liberals {{enjoyed the}} incumbent's {{advantage}} of controlling the levers of patronage, and the election's result was never really in doubt. Before the election, Talbot predicted {{that the government would}} win 18 of the province's 25 seats. Immediately after the election <b>it</b> <b>appeared</b> <b>that</b> the Liberals had won 21; when all the votes had been counted they had won 23 seats to the Conservatives' two. Bennett himself was defeated in his Calgary riding. When the outcome was clear, the people of Strathcona feted Rutherford with a torchlight procession and bonfire.|$|E
5|$|Fischer's career-long stubbornness about {{match and}} tournament {{conditions}} was again {{seen in the}} run-up to his match with Spassky. Of the possible sites, Fischer's first choice was Belgrade, Yugoslavia, while Spassky's was Reykjavík, Iceland. For a time <b>it</b> <b>appeared</b> <b>that</b> the dispute would be resolved by splitting the match between the two locations, but that arrangement failed. After that issue was resolved, Fischer refused to appear in Iceland until the prize fund was increased. London financier Jim Slater donated an additional US$125,000, bringing the prize fund up to an unprecedented $250,000 ($ million today) and Fischer finally agreed to play.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{constitutional}} convention, <b>it</b> <b>appeared</b> <b>that</b> Garrard's political career was {{drawing to a}} close. He resigned all of his county offices to focus on {{his work in the}} Elkhorn Baptist Convention and his agricultural pursuits. He was pleased, however, when his son William was chosen to represent the county in the state legislature in 1793. In 1795, William Garrard was reelected, and the other four state legislators from Bourbon County were close associates of Garrard's, including John Edwards, who had recently been defeated for reelection to the U.S. Senate.|$|E

Maxwell was put in charge of the {{development}} of the Cavendish Laboratory, supervising every step in the progress of the building and of the purchase of the collection of apparatus. One of Maxwell's last great contributions to science was the editing (with copious original notes) of the research of Henry Cavendish, from which <b>it</b> <b>appeared</b> <b>that</b> Cavendish researched, amongst other things, such questions as the density of the Earth and the composition of water.|$|E
5|$|In the 2007 Labour Party {{leadership}} election, Benn {{backed the}} left-wing MP John McDonnell in his unsuccessful bid. In September 2007, Benn {{called for the}} government to hold a referendum on the EU Reform Treaty. In October 2007, at the age of 82, and when <b>it</b> <b>appeared</b> <b>that</b> a general election was about to be held, Benn reportedly announced that he wanted to stand, having written to his local Kensington and Chelsea Constituency Labour Party offering himself as a prospective candidate for the seat held by the Conservative Malcolm Rifkind. However, there was no election in 2007, and the constituency was subsequently abolished.|$|E
5|$|Kraft's {{world record}} {{initially}} came under scrunity, as <b>it</b> <b>appeared</b> <b>that</b> {{he touched the}} snow with his backside as {{he was forced to}} squat down on essentially flat ground. However, slow-motion replay analysis confirmed that his landing was valid, albeit with only millimetres to spare. A week later, Planica caught up to Vikersund with a plethora of more personal bests, and three athletes – including Kraft, twice – landing jumps of or beyond 250m. Kamil Stoch would claim the current hill record of 251.5m, with the season finale competition drawing an attendance of 16,500.|$|E

50|$|However, most meta-analyses include between 2-4 {{studies and}} such a sample is {{more often than not}} {{inadequate}} to accurately estimate heterogeneity. Thus <b>it</b> <b>appears</b> <b>that</b> in small meta-analyses, an incorrect zero between study variance estimate is obtained, leading to a false homogeneity assumption. Overall, <b>it</b> <b>appears</b> <b>that</b> heterogeneity is being consistently underestimated in meta-analyses.|$|R

5|$|On the ground, <b>it</b> <b>appeared</b> <b>that</b> Virginia Tech had {{the edge}} in experience, forcing Georgia's defense to {{concentrate}} on stopping Tech's run game. Virginia Tech running back Branden Ore suffered an ankle injury in the Hokies' regular-season game against Wake Forest, but still took {{the field in the}} Chick-fil-A Bowl. The same could not be said for Georgia, whose original starting running back, Thomas Brown, suffered a season-ending knee injury in October. Filling his role were two inexperienced players: Kregg Lumpkin and Danny Ware. Making up for this inexperience, the two players were coached by Tony Ball, a former Virginia Tech wide receivers coach with insights into the Tech defense.|$|E
5|$|Once {{production}} began {{it became}} apparent that Part One and Part Two were under-running so more dialogue was written to fill in the time. It was originally intended that the character of Jackson would not reappear after the second episode, but during filming Saward became concerned that <b>it</b> <b>appeared</b> <b>that</b> he had been executed and so he and Clegg rewrote Part Three to include him. Part Three also looked to be under running so scenes from Part Four were brought forward and the final scenes with the Guardians were extended to compensate.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the reasons}} for the move from Zeus to Nike-X was concern that the Zeus radars would not be able to tell the {{difference}} between the warhead and a decoy until it was too late to launch. One solution to this problem was the Sprint missile, which had the performance required to wait until decluttering was complete. Another potential solution was to look for some sort of signature of the reentry through the highest levels of the atmosphere that might differ between a warhead and decoy; specifically, <b>it</b> <b>appeared</b> <b>that</b> the ablation of the heat shield might produce a clear signature pointing out the warhead.|$|E

5|$|Peter {{retired to}} a monastery, {{where he died}} in 969, while Boris was {{released}} from Byzantine custody and recognized as Tsar Boris II. For the moment, <b>it</b> <b>appeared</b> <b>that</b> Nikephoros' plan had worked. However, Sviatoslav's brief sojourn into the south awakened in him the desire to conquer these fertile and rich lands. In this intention he was apparently encouraged by the former Byzantine envoy, Kalokyros, who coveted the imperial crown for himself. Thus, after defeating the Pechenegs, he set up viceroys to rule Russia in his absence and turned his sights southward again.|$|E
5|$|Richard began {{discussions about}} a {{potential}} alliance with Philip II in Paris during 1187, {{and the next}} year Richard gave homage to Philip in exchange for support for a war against Henry. Richard and Philip fought a joint campaign against Henry, and by the summer of 1189 the king made peace, promising Richard the succession. John initially remained loyal to his father, but changed sides once <b>it</b> <b>appeared</b> <b>that</b> Richard would win. Henry died shortly afterwards.|$|E
5|$|Several of the {{statements}} originated from the juveniles who had been arrested shortly after the murder. They included Jason Hill, the 13-year-old who had been held for three days in his underpants and a blanket, without access to his parents or a lawyer. (Hill received £30,000 in damages from the police over his treatment.) Hill had not been told that his statement {{was going to be}} read out in court during the detectives' trial; he first learned that it had been used when he heard it on television. Another statement was from Mark Pennant, also a juvenile who had been arrested during the first inquiry. Overall <b>it</b> <b>appeared</b> <b>that</b> Silcott was being retried.|$|E
