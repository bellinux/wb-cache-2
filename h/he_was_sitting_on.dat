5|$|Prior to the 1987–88 season Vanbiesbrouck {{was hit by}} a puck {{under his}} mask in practice, which caused a non-displaced {{fracture}} of his lower jaw and a broken tooth. Fortunately for him the injury did not require his jaw to be wired shut, {{and he was able to}} return to practice the next day. He showed no ill effects from the injury, playing in 56 games, winning 27. On June 13, 1988 Vanbiesbrouck suffered nerve damage to his left wrist after a glass coffee table <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>sitting</b> <b>on</b> collapsed and broken glass lacerated his ulnar nerve and three tendons. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>sitting</b> <b>on</b> the table assembling video equipment in anticipation of the birth of his first child. The glass broke beneath him, and as he braced for the fall, his wrist was cut by the glass. Vanbiesbrouck required five hours of microsurgery to remove glass from his wrist and repair the nerve and tendon damage. He was initially expected to miss 4–6 months, but he recovered in time to attend the Rangers pre-season training camp just 3 months later. Again he played in 56 games, and increased his win total to 28.|$|E

500|$|He {{returned}} to his homeland upon the invitation of his brother Andrew, who had in the meantime been crowned King of Hungary. Andrew assigned {{the administration of the}} so-called ducatus or [...] "duchy", which encompassed around one-third of the territory of the Kingdom of Hungary, to Béla. The two brothers' relationship became tense when Andrew had his own son, Solomon, crowned king, and forced Béla to publicly confirm Solomon's right to the throne in 1057 or 1058. Béla, assisted by his Polish relatives, rebelled against his brother and dethroned him in 1060. He introduced monetary reform and subdued the last uprising aimed at the restoration of paganism in Hungary. Béla was fatally injured when his throne collapsed while <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>sitting</b> <b>on</b> it.|$|E

500|$|With {{an exaggerated}} and unusual batting style, Bagwell waited for each pitch {{in a low}} crouch, with legs wide open and knees bent nearly 90 degrees, {{appearing}} as if <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>sitting</b> <b>on</b> an invisible bench. [...] He stepped back with his front foot as he began his swing. [...] Next, he would rise from his stance and rotate his hands with the bat forward into his powerful, uppercut swing. [...] "That wide stance keeps him from over striding", Joe Torre observed, [...] "which can be your biggest problem when you’re trying to hit for power." [...] The low crouch also shrunk his strike zone, allowing him to walk more often. [...] Standing 6 feet tall (...) and weighing , he did not present {{the image of an}} imposing, home run-hitting giant that would cause pitchers to be very careful when he batted after he began his major league career.|$|E

2500|$|LaHaye {{indicates}} that {{the idea for the}} series came to him one day circa 1994, while <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>sitting</b> <b>on</b> an airplane and observed a married pilot flirting with a flight attendant. He wondered what would befall the pilot if the Rapture happened at that moment. The first book in the series opens with a similar scene. He sold the movie rights for the Left Behind series and later stated he regretted that decision, because the films turned out to be [...] "church-basement videos", rather than [...] "a big-budget blockbuster" [...] that he had hoped for.|$|E

2500|$|The 19th Hussars {{were posted}} to Ireland in June 1876. In September 1877 French {{was one of}} two lieutenants who persuaded seventy drunk and mutinous troopers, who had armed {{themselves}} with sticks and threatened [...] "murder" [...] if infantry pickets were sent after them, to return to barracks (the ringleaders were subsequently imprisoned—they had been protesting at an unpopular commanding officer, who remained in command for another sixteen months).

2500|$|Following Renny's eviction, HouseGuests {{competed in}} the [...] "Freeze Frame" [...] Head of Household competition. For this competition, HouseGuests were asked {{questions}} about images of previous competitions {{that they had been}} shown beforehand; the HouseGuest with the most correct answers after seven questions was the winner. Dan was the winner. Upon returning inside, the HouseGuests found a sumo wrestler inside who would sit up and down and random times; the HouseGuests later discovered <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>sitting</b> <b>on</b> an envelope, which revealed to the HouseGuests that they would begin a luxury competition that same day. Previously evicted HouseGuest Jessie later returned to host the competition, which required the four to attempt to guess a phrase based on various clues in an attempt to win a trip to a luxury island; Dan was the winner. In the Diary Room he learned he could bring either a current HouseGuest or a Jury Member on his trip with him, and he chose to bring Michelle; he later lied to his fellow HouseGuests and stated he chose to bring nobody with him. Dan and Memphis later decided he should nominate Memphis for eviction in a further attempt to hide their Renegades alliance. On Day 60, Dan chose to nominate Jerry and Memphis for eviction. On Day 61, HouseGuests {{competed in the}} [...] "Stairway to Veto" [...] Power of Veto competition. For this competition, each HouseGuest had their own staircase, with two facts on each step. The first HouseGuest to figure out which HouseGuest went with the facts and completely finish their stairway would win the Power of Veto. Memphis was the winner of the final Power of Veto competition. On Day 64, Memphis chose to use the Power of Veto to remove himself from the block, with Keesha being the only eligible HouseGuest to nominate in his place. Minutes later, Keesha became the tenth HouseGuest to be evicted from the house when Memphis cast the sole vote against her.|$|E
