Although South African universities launched programs in retail management, attracting young talents to a career in retailing remains a tough challenge. Drawing on previous findings {{from the field of}} graduate decision-making and industry image from other countries, this research examines the perceptions and expectations of Gen Y members with regard to their field of study and their prospective career. A nationwide survey with 1363 South African first year students, in their first week at university, shows significant differences between freshmen enrolled in retail business management and those enrolled in other business majors. While retail students, as compared to other participants, tend to hold stronger positive associations with their field of study and a retail career, majoring in retailing appears to be a fallback option.

40|$|Experimental {{research}} has shown that emotional stimuli can either enhance or impair attentional performance. However, the relative effects of specific emotional stimuli and the specific time course of these differential effects are unclear. In the present study, participants (n =  50) searched for a single target within a rapid serial visual presentation of images. Irrelevant fear, disgust, erotic or neutral images preceded the target by two, four, six, or eight items. At <b>lag</b> 2, erotic <b>images</b> induced the greatest deficits in subsequent target processing compared to other images, consistent with a large emotional attentional blink. Fear and disgust images also produced a larger attentional blinks at lag 2 than neutral images. Erotic, fear, and disgust images continued to induce greater deficits than neutral <b>images</b> at <b>lag</b> 4 and 6. However, target processing deficits induced by erotic, fear, and disgust <b>images</b> at intermediate <b>lags</b> (lag 4 and 6) did not consistently differ from each other. In contrast to performance at lag 2, 4, and 6, enhancement in target processing for emotional stimuli was observed in comparison to neutral stimuli at lag 8. These findings suggest that task-irrelevant emotion information, particularly erotica, impairs intentional allocation of attention at early temporal stages, but at later temporal stages, emotional stimuli can have an enhancing effect on directed attention. These data suggest that the effects of emotional stimuli on attention can be both positive and negative depending upon temporal factors...|$|R

Combining this data with the previously obtained light curves, we determine the time delays between images A, B and C. We confirm our previous measurement finding that A leads B by ∆tBA = 40. 6 ± 1. 8 days, and find that image C leads image A by ∆τCA = 821. 6 ± 2. 1 days. The lower limit on the remaining delay is that <b>image</b> D <b>lags</b> <b>image</b> A by ∆τAD> 1250 days. Based on the microlensing of images A and B we estimate that the accretion disk size at a rest wavelength of 2300 ˚A is 10 14. 8 ± 0. 3 cm for a disk inclination of cosi = 1 / 2, {{which is consistent with}} the microlensing disk size-black hole mass correlation function given our estimate of the black hole mass from the MgII line width of log MBH/M ⊙ = 8. 44 ± 0. 14. The long delays allow us to fill in the seasonal gaps and assemble a continuous, densely sampled light curve spanning 5. 7 years whose variability implies a structure function with a logarithmic slope of γ = 0. 35 ± 0. 02.

We applied a two-dimensional fast Fourier transformation to images after median filtering, (x, y) plane removal, and cosine tapering. We formed autospectra and coherence spectra as functions of a scalar wavenumber. Coherence estimates between pairs of images were plotted against time separation between images for several wide wavenumber bands to provide a temporal lagged coherence function. The temporal rate of loss of correlation (decorrelation time scale) in surface patterns provides {{a measure of the}} rate of pattern change or evolution as a function of spatial dimension. We found that patterns evolved (or lost correlation) approximately twice as rapidly in upwelling jets as in the 'quieter' regions between jets. The rapid evolution of pigment patterns (lifetime of about 1 week or less for scales of 50 - 100 km) ought to hinder biomass transfer to zooplankton predators compared with phytoplankton patches that persist for longer times. We found {{no significant differences between the}} statistics of CZCS and AVHRR images (spectral shape or rate of decorrelation). In addition, in two of the three areas studied, the peak correlation between AVHRR and CZCS images from the same area occurred at zero lag, indicating that the patterns evolved simutaneously. In the third area, maximum coherence between thermal and pigment patterns occurred when pigment <b>images</b> <b>lagged</b> thermal <b>images</b> by 1 - 2 days, mirroring the expected lag of high pigment behind low temperatures (and high nutrients) in recently upwelled water. We conclude that in dynamic areas such as coastal upwelling systems, the phytoplankton cells (identified by pigment color patterns) behave largely as passive scalars at the mesoscale and that growth, death, and sinking of phytoplankton collectively play at most a mariginal role in determining the spectral statistics of the pigment patterns...|$|R

The time delay between the A and B images is ∆τBA = 40. 6 ± 1. 8 days in the expected sense that B leads A and the overall time ordering is C-B-A-D-E. We find that image C leads image A by ∆τCA = 821. 6 ± 2. 1 days. The lower limit on the remaining delay is that <b>image</b> D <b>lags</b> <b>image</b> A by ∆τAD> 1250 days. With a delay of 2. 3 years between the images A and C, we even measure the longest time delay known in any gravitationally lensed quasar.

Within this paper we will present a simple method to determine the <b>image</b> <b>lag.</b> Based on the standard ASTM E 2597 9 ̆ 6 07 (ASTM 2007) which describes various characterization methods for digital detector arrays, we want to advance the method of <b>image</b> <b>lag</b> determination with the intention to be able to cope with these <b>image</b> <b>lag</b> artefacts. While this contribution especially refers to indirect converting X-ray detectors the effect occurs also with direct converting X-ray detectors (Zhao et al. 2005) ...|$|E
40|$|Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have {{gathered}} {{a lot of}} attention from the computer vision community, yielding impressive results for image generation. Advances in the adversarial generation of natural language from noise however are not commensurate with the progress made in generating <b>images,</b> and still <b>lag</b> far behind likelihood based methods. In this paper, we take a step towards generating natural language with a GAN objective alone. We introduce a simple baseline that addresses the discrete output space problem without relying on gradient estimators and show that it is able to achieve state-of-the-art results on a Chinese poem generation dataset. We present quantitative results on generating sentences from context-free and probabilistic context-free grammars, and qualitative language modeling results. A conditional version is also described that can generate sequences conditioned on sentence characteristics. Comment: 11 pages, 3 figures, 5 table...|$|R
2500|$|The larger, {{advanced}} {{digital cameras}} offer a non-optical electronic through-the-lens (TTL) view, via an eye-level electronic viewfinder (EVF) {{in addition to}} the rear LCD. The difference in view compared with a DSLR is that the EVF shows a digitally created image, whereas the viewfinder in a DSLR shows an actual optical image via the reflex viewing system. An EVF <b>image</b> has <b>lag</b> time (that is, it reacts with a delay to view changes) and has a lower resolution than an optical viewfinder but achieves parallax-free viewing using less bulk and mechanical complexity than a DSLR with its reflex viewing system. Optical viewfinders tend to be more comfortable and efficient, especially for action photography and in low-light conditions. Compared with digital cameras with LCD electronic viewfinders, there is no time lag in the image: it is always correct as it is being [...] "updated" [...] at the speed of light. This is important for action or sports photography, or any other situation where the subject or the camera is moving quickly. Furthermore, the [...] "resolution" [...] of the viewed image is much better than that provided by an LCD or an electronic viewfinder, which can be important if manual focusing is desired for precise focusing, as would be the case in macro photography and [...] "micro-photography" [...] (with a microscope). An optical viewfinder may also cause less eye-strain. However, electronic viewfinders may provide a brighter display in low light situations, as the picture can be electronically amplified.|$|R
40|$|This note compares {{two methods}} to {{estimate}} local phase speeds of a traveling wave train from time <b>lagged</b> <b>images</b> {{of the ocean}} surface. An algorithm based on spatial correlation functions is formulated and its advantages and disadvantages are discussed. A least squares approach is developed and is seen to reduce the errors in the previous approach signicantly. 1 Introduction Sequential images of the ocean surface are readily produced {{by a variety of}} instrumentation platforms, such as standard marine X-band radars and automated video cameras installed on the coast. A time lagged pair of snapshots obtained from these image acquisition systems can be used to quantify the spatial variability in the phase speeds of propagating water waves as they approach the shoreline. These local estimates of phase speed can then be used in a depth inversion algorithm to determine the underlying bathymetry (Misra et al. (2000)). The problem of quantifying the local displacements and velocities in a [...] ...|$|R
