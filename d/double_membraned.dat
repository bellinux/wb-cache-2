40|$|Recent {{studies in}} erythroid cells {{have shown that}} {{autophagy}} is an important process for the physiological clearance of mitochondria during terminal differentiation. However, autophagy also {{plays an important role}} in removing damaged and dysfunctional mitochondria. Defective mitochondria and impaired erythroid maturation are important characteristics of low-risk myelodysplasia. In this study we therefore questioned whether the autophagic clearance of mitochondria might be altered in erythroblasts from patients with refractory anemia (RA, n = 3) and RA with ringed sideroblasts (RARS, n = 6). Ultrastructurally, abnormal and iron-laden mitochondria were abundant, especially in RARS patients. A large proportion (52 +/- 16 %) of immature and mature myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) erythroblasts contained cytoplasmic vacuoles, partly <b>double</b> <b>membraned</b> and positive for lysosomal marker LAMP- 2 and mitochondrial markers, findings compatible with autophagic removal of dysfunctional mitochondria. In healthy controls only mature erythroblasts comprised these vacuoles (12 +/- 3 %). These findings were confirmed morphometrically showing an increased vacuolar surface in MDS erythroblasts compared to controls (...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background The plasma {{membrane}} scavenger receptor, SR-BI, mediates the 'selective uptake' {{process by which}} cholesteryl esters (CE) from exogenously supplied HDL are taken up by target cells. Recent work suggests that dimer and higher order oligomeric forms of the SR-BI protein are important to this process. SR-BI {{has been shown to}} be particularly associated with microvilli and microvillar channels found at the cell surface of steroidogenic cells, and a study with the hormone stimulated adrenal gland has shown impressive changes in the size and complexity of the microvillar compartment as the mass of CE uptake (and accompanying steroidogenesis) fluctuates. In the present study, we examine a cell line in which we overexpress the SR-BI protein to determine if morphological, biochemical and functional events associated with SR-BI in a controlled cell system are similar to those observed in the intact mammalian adrenal which is responsive to systemic factors. Methods Y 1 -BS 1 mouse adrenocortical cells were transiently transfected using rat SR-BI-pcDNA 6 -V 5 -His, rat SR-BI-pcDNA 6 -cMyc-His or control pcDNA 6 -V 5 -His vector construct using a CaPO 4 precipitation technique. Twenty four hours after transfection, cells were treated with, or without, Bt 2 cAMP, and SR-BI expression, CE uptake, and steroidogenesis was measured. SR-BI dimerization and cell surface architectural changes were assessed using immunoelectron microscopic techniques. Results Overexpression of the scavenger receptor protein, SR-BI, in Y 1 -BS 1 cells results in major alterations in cell surface architecture designed to increase uptake of HDL supplied-CEs. Changes include 1 the formation of crater-like erosions of the surface with multiple <b>double</b> <b>membraned</b> channel structures lining the craters, and 2 dimerized formations of SR-BI lining the newly formed craters and associated <b>double</b> <b>membraned</b> channels. Conclusion These data show that overexpression of the scavenger receptor protein, SR-BI (accompanied by suitable hormone treatment and lipoproteins) in susceptible mammalian cells – is associated with increased cholesterol uptake and SR-BI dimerization within a much enlarged and architecturally complex microvillar compartment. These changes duplicate the structural, biochemical and functional changes related to the uptake of HDL CEs normally signaled by the action of ACTH on intact adrenal tissue. </p...|$|E
40|$|In {{every moment}} of a cell's {{existence}} one key question is always asked, “To be or not to be”? Cells constantly weigh up signals from their environment against their own integrity and metabolic status and decide whether to live or die. Such cell death decisions {{are central to the}} progression and treatment of cancer. The term autophagy describes three processes that deliver cytoplasmic macromolecules and organelles to lysosomes for degradation, the difference between each form being the method of delivery. The most extensively studied form is macroautophagy (hereafter referred to as autophagy) where cytosolic components are engulfed by <b>double</b> <b>membraned</b> autophagosomes. Autophagosomes fuse with lysosomes to form structures called autolysosomes, within which organelles, proteins and other macromolecules are degraded by catabolic enzymes in the acidic lysosome environment. Autophagy, which normally occurs at low levels in unstressed cells, is widely regarded as having a positive effect on cell health as potentially harmful protein aggregates and damaged organelles can be recycled. During periods of nutrient shortage autophagy is enhanced to provide, albeit temporarily, an internal energy source. Autophagy is also enhanced by other stresses encountered by tumour cells and this may protect the cell or aid its demise. In this review we examine the effect of autophagy on cell death decisions in tumour cells...|$|E

A 52 -year-old female presented with epiretinal membrane and underwent combined cataract surgery and pars plana vitrectomy. Axial length was measured with partial coherence interferometry. Although the signal curve in the summary display showed a single peak, a 1. 6 diopter myopic shift occurred. Viewed retrospectively, six of 20 individual signal curves showed a double peak. Most of them showed a higher anterior peak, with only one having a higher posterior peak. The other 14 curves showed a single peak at a similar distance to an anterior peak. The anterior peak appeared {{to be derived from}} the epiretinal membrane. The possibility of a double peak should always be considered in patients with epiretinal membrane even if the summary display of the partial coherence interferometry measurement shows a single peak. Checking all signal curves would reduce the risk of missing a hidden double peak. Keywords: intraocular lens, master, <b>double</b> peak, epiretinal <b>membran...</b>|$|R
40|$|The ultrastructural {{changes that}} take place in the ventral dermis along with the {{development}} of iridophores were examined in the anadromous sea lamprey, Petromyzon marinus, during metamorphosis. There is a disruption of all components of the ventral dermis and a reformation that results in a structure very similar to that prior to metamorphosis. Although not a dermal component, a layer of iridophores develops directly beneath the dermis during late metamorphosis. The dermal endothelium is lost by mid metamorphosis (stage 4) and the highly organized collagenous lamellae making up the bulk of the dermis become disrupted by the migration of fibroblasts into the region. Many of these fibroblasts are involved in the degradation of the lamellae. By stage 5 of metamorphosis some fibroblasts become highly active collagen synthesizing cuboidal shaped cells that align to form a layer above the reformed dermal endothelium. New lamellae are formed by these cuboidal cells which then divide and migrate into the lamellae where they assume the characteristic attenuated appearance of fibroblasts in the adult dermal lamellae region. Iridophores first appear during stage 5 directly beneath the dermal endothelium. Reflecting platelets develop from <b>double</b> <b>membraned</b> vesicles associated with the Golgi apparatus. By late metamorphosis, stacks of trapezoidal shaped platelets fill the cytoplasm of the iridophores. The significance of the changes in the dermis during metamorphosis are discussed. This work is part of a continuing series of studies on the connective tissues in the anadromous sea lamprey...|$|E
40|$|Nitrogen is an {{essential}} element for plant growth and yield. Improving Nitrogen Use Efficiency (NUE) of crops could potentially reduce the application of chemical fertilizer and alleviate environmental damage. To identify new NUE genes is therefore an important task in molecular breeding. Macroautophagy (autophagy) is an intracellular process in which damaged or obsolete cytoplasmic components are encapsulated in <b>double</b> <b>membraned</b> vesicles termed autophagosomes, then delivered to the vacuole for degradation and nutrient recycling. One of the core components of autophagosome formation, ATG 8, {{has been shown to}} directly mediate autophagosome expansion, and the transcript of which is highly inducible upon starvation. Therefore, we postulated that certain homologs of Saccharomyces cerevisiae ATG 8 (ScATG 8) from crop species could have potential for NUE crop breeding. A soybean (Glycine max, cv. Zhonghuang- 13) ATG 8, GmATG 8 c, was selected from the 11 family members based on transcript analysis upon nitrogen deprivation. GmATG 8 c could partially complement the yeast atg 8 mutant. Constitutive expression of GmATG 8 c in soybean callus cells not only enhanced nitrogen starvation tolerance of the cells but accelerated the growth of the calli. Transgenic Arabidopsis over-expressing GmATG 8 c performed better under extended nitrogen and carbon starvation conditions. Meanwhile, under optimum growth conditions, the transgenic plants grew faster, bolted earlier, produced larger primary and axillary inflorescences, eventually produced more seeds than the wild-type. In average, the yield was improved by 12. 9 %. We conclude that GmATG 8 c may serve as an excellent candidate for breeding crops with enhanced NUE and better yield...|$|E
40|$|In vivo {{analysis}} of the virus titer in various loci, 24 hr after infection, showed that a titer {{similar to that in}} the blood plasma was found in the ascitic fluid of Erlich ascites cancer-bearing mice, and in lymph nodes, spleen, and thymus, i. e. loci which contain macrophages as a common cell type. However, only in the lymph nodes and in the ascitic fluid did the increase in virus titer precede or parallel the increase in the plasma. The LDH virus titer in the plasma of X-irradiated mice was similar to that of control mice, eliminating radiation-sensitive cells but not macrophages as target cells of the virus. Electron microscopic observation of infected lymph node cells revealed the presence of two types of particles: one consisting of small densely stained annuli, about 25 mµ in diameter and one of similar dense annuli with a halo extending the diameter to about 50 mµ. Such particles were repeatedly observed within single or <b>double</b> <b>membraned</b> vesicles. In vitro, the LDH virus multiplied only in cultures of mouse peritoneal macrophages, maintained in medium 199 with 10 % FBS. The virus titer could be maintained for at least 33 days, during eleven serial passages, involving an overall dilution factor of 1011. These results corroborate the findings of Evans and Salaman, who used peritoneal macrophages maintained in Eagle's medium and 5 to 10 % lamb serum. However, in the serial passage experiments reported here, the virus titer could only be maintained following trypsinization of each successive inoculum. The role of macrophages as the target cell for LDH virus multiplication in vivo is discussed...|$|E
40|$|Unregulated {{neuronal}} {{cell death}} has {{been implicated in}} the pathogenesis of several neurological disorders and in acute neuronal injury such as stroke. Mcl- 1, an anti-apoptotic member of the Bcl- 2 family, is a known survival factor for hematopoietic cells, however little is known regarding its function in the nervous system. In this study, we examined the role of Mcl- 1 in regulation of programmed cell death throughout nervous system development and in maintaining mature neurons. We found that both Nestin: Cre Mcl- 1 and Foxg 1 : Cre Mcl- 1 conditional knockout mice were embryonic lethal. Morphological analysis and immunohistochemical staining revealed severe deterioration of the cortices and an apoptotic phenotype, suggesting that Mcl- 1 is required for embryonic neuronal survival. Both neural progenitors and newly differentiated neurons were affected, revealing that neurons were dying throughout the process of differentiation. Deletion of Mcl- 1 in post mitotic neurons in postnatal mice with CamKIIalpha Cre also resulted in premature lethality. Cresyl Violet staining and NeuN immunohistochemistry revealed a rapid loss of neurons in the cortices of mutants. Electron micrographic imaging revealed <b>double</b> <b>membraned</b> vesicles within the cortical neurons, suggestive of an autophagic form of cell death. Consistent with this hypothesis, an upregulation of LC 3 was observed in primary cortical neurons deficient for Mcl- 1. Altogether our findings demonstrate {{that the loss of}} Mcl- 1 in embryonic and post-mitotic neurons results in cell death. The two distinct forms of cell death activated indicate that Mcl- 1 functions in multiple pathways to promote neuronal survival. In summary, we demonstrate that Mcl- 1 is vital for the survival of neurons...|$|E
40|$|Mitochondrm are {{important}} in ion transport, {{as has been shown}} in recent biochemical studies. For e~ample, Stanbury and Mudge have shown that isolated mitochondria are capable of maintaining high concentrations of potassium when suspended in potassium poor solutions (7), and Bartley and Davies have shown that isolated mitochondria can take up cations from the surrounding solution against a concentration gradient (1). Mitochondria concentrate the cationic dye Janus green, as is well known from light microscopic observations. That the cationic dye neutral red is also concentrated by mitochondria has been shown by electron microscopic studies (10). This paper reports electron microscopic observations on the effect of sodium and potassium ions upon a cell normally engaged in their transport. The duodenal absorptive cell of the Swiss albino mouse was studied under varying salt and water loads. Mitochondfia were found to develop internal granules when these salts were administered in large amounts. Materials and Metkods The duodenal absorptive cells of Swiss albino mice were prepared and studied by the techniques described in the preceding paper. The adult mice were males, 8 to 10 weeks old. In order to assess the relative number of mitochondrial granules, at least ten high resolution micrographs were obtained for each animal. In questionable cases at least another fifteen micrographs were taken from another part of the duodenum. A total of 59 animals was studied. OBSERVATIONS Mitochondrial Structure. ~Mitochondria from duodenal absorptive ceils are similar to those found elsewhere (3, 4, 6) (Figs. 1 and 2). They are bounded by a double membrane, the inner one of which folds inward to form the <b>double</b> <b>membraned</b> internal folds. Between the two 90 A thick osmiophilic membranes bounding the mitochondrion and forming the internal folds is an electron...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Chloroplast protein import {{presents}} a complex membrane traversal problem: precursor proteins must cross two envelope membranes {{to reach the}} stromal compartment. This work characterizes a new chloroplast protein import intermediate which has completely traversed the outer envelope membrane but has not yet reached the stroma. The existence of this intermediate demonstrates that distinct protein transport machineries are present in both envelope membranes, {{and that they are}} able to operate independently of one another under certain conditions. Energetic characterization of this pathway led to the identification of three independent energy-requiring steps: binding of the precursor to the outer envelope membrane, outer membrane transport, and inner membrane transport. Localization of the sites of energy utilization for each of these steps, as well as their respective nucleotide specificities, suggest that three different ATPases mediate chloroplast envelope transport. C HLOROPLASTS are <b>double</b> <b>membraned</b> organelles which acquire the majority of their proteins from the cytoplasm. Proteins destined for chloroplasts are encoded in the nucleus, synthesized on cytoplasmic ribosomes, and posttranslationally targeted to the plastid import apparatus by an NH 2 -terminal extension called a transit peptide (see Theg and Scott, 1993; de Boer and Weisbeek, 1991 for reviews). After binding to a proteinaceous receptor on the outer envelope membrane (for a review see Gray and Row, 1995), the precursor traverses the two membranes to arrive in the stroma, where the transit peptide is immediately removed by a stromal processing peptidase (Reed ct al., 1990). Precursors destined for the thylakoids contain a bipartite transit peptide; the most NH 2 -terminal region is an envelope targeting domain which is cleaved by the stromal peptidase to expose a subsequent thylakoid-directing signal sequence. After targeting to the thylakoid lumen, this sequence is removed by a second peptidase, leaving the mature-sized protein (The...|$|E

40|$|University of Minnesota Ph. D. dissertation. June 2009. Major: Microbiology, Immunology and Cancer Biology. Advisor: Peter B. Bitterman, MD. 1 {{computer}} file (PDF); xiv, 146 pages. Ill. (some col.) According to the American Cancer Society, {{cancer is the}} second leading cause of mortality in the United States, accounting {{for more than half}} a million deaths per year. Cancer is a complex disease with multiple factors influencing its genesis, maintenance, growth, and invasion which makes the treatment and prevention of the disease challenging. Despite the high mortality and morbidity associated with cancer, it is a disease of the old, with the median age for cancer incidence being 66 years old according to the National Cancer Institute. Therefore, the human body is remarkably adept at protecting itself from malignant transformation. In my thesis, I explore the oncogene Ras which is represented in approximately 30 % of all human cancers, making Ras one of the most commonly activated oncogenes. I analyzed the innate barriers to oncogenic Ras (RasV 12) induced transformation in the cell in an attempt to better understand tumor defense systems which can be mimicked for novel cancer therapy. My results confirmed one putative barrier which had good experimental grounding and identified a completely new barrier. One putative barrier to RasV 12 oncogenesis was the existence of a translational control check point in tumor defense. Activation of translation initiation has been shown to be on the causal pathway to cancer and is activated by Ras via two different pathways. The rate limiting translation initiation factor 4 E (eIF 4 E) is up regulated in many cancers and over expression of eIF 4 E confers cells with transformed phenotypes. Therefore, if activation of translation is oncogenic, then it is reasonable to posit the existence of a translational control checkpoint in tumor defense. The logical guardians of this checkpoint would be the primary negative regulators of translational initiation, the eIF 4 E binding protein (4 E-BP) family of proteins. I show that translational control checkpoint does indeed exist in tumor defense and that the 4 E-BPs are the guardians of this checkpoint. Mice lacking two of the three 4 E-BPs (4 ebp 1 -/-/ 4 ebp 2 -/-) were more sensitive to tobacco carcinogen NNK induced lung tumors and showed tumors with increased vascularity. Also, 4 ebp 1 -/-/ 4 ebp 2 -/- genotype was associated with a skewing of the genome wide translational profile towards growth and proliferation even before NNK treatment indicating a cancer primed state. Lastly, I showed that the cytochrome P 450 2 A 5, the protein that metabolizes NNK to its carcinogenic product, was translationally up regulated increasing the carcinogenic potency of NNK. The second barrier to RasV 12 oncogenesis was an unexpected discovery. In an effort to determine the mechanism of RasV 12 oncogenesis and its defense, I discovered that RasV 12 triggered proliferative block even in cells which have bypassed the senescence barriers. This was unexpected since previous reports had shown that in this setting, RasV 12 actually caused anchorage independent growth and invasion in vitro. The nature of the proliferative block was not senescence although it has many of the characters of senescence. Due to a striking phenotypical change where large vacuoles accumulate, I explored the possibility that autophagy was playing a role in the proliferative block. I show that RasV 12 expressing cells displayed hallmarks of autophagy such as <b>double</b> <b>membraned</b> vacuoles with pieces of organelles, acidic nature of the vacuoles, and positivity for early and late markers of autophagy. My study validates the current efforts to develop targeted therapy against the translation initiation complex and provides autophagy as a new potential target for caner therapy. By learning from the cell's innate cancer barriers, I hope that we will be able to develop more effect therapies for cancer...|$|E
