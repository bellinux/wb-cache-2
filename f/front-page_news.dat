Behar subsequently told Koppelman that Selena and her band would leave EMI and find a record company willing to record an English-language album for Selena. Behar had lied to the chairman to force the crossover album to begin; EMI relented and the recording sessions began.

40|$|This study {{examined}} how discursive strategies and related linguistic devices were employed by The New York Times (TNYT) to portray Iran {{after the terrorist}} attacks in the U. S. on September 11, 2001, and how the media representation may have contributed to negative and/or positive outcomes in terms of geopolitical relations. The study also investigated how sociopolitical assumptions were manifest in producing news about Iran and how the news discourse continued to shape the power relations between the nation and the U. S. in particular, and the world at large. Using Critical Discourse Analysis (CDA) as a multidisciplinary approach, the analysis focused on 171 <b>front-page</b> TNYT <b>news</b> articles from 2001 until 2009. Analysis of the discursive strategies and linguistic means revealed that the news media depicted an overall negative picture of Iran after the September 11 or “ 9 / 11 ” attacks. The effect of this rather stereotypical construction of Iran in TNYT was that of the negative Other, a nation of people that formed part of George W. Bush’s contentious “axis of evil” thesis–malevolent, untrustworthy, violent, and a threat to world peace...|$|R

It is available online at: [URL] and ethnicity are potent categories, especially in combination. In news reporting, the ways in which such categories are symbolically mobilised may seem very much of the present, but such uses are often deeply rooted in the past and reproduce stock notions that were developed in previous historical formations. The present article takes a <b>front-page</b> tabloid <b>news</b> story {{as an example of how}} this can operate. It shows how the story draws on various stereotypical representations of female and black sexuality on the one hand, white European and black African social arrangements on the other. Its narrative structure privileges and silences certain “voices” in the narrative, and uses what these “voices” say to support its key thematic template. The discourse of the story is schematically organised around this template, which deals in long-established binary conceptions of civilisation and primitiveness, and strategically opposed values of social responsibility and personal fulfilment. These are reinforced not only by the various textual features of the narrative, but also by its intertextual relation to the other, subsidiary, front-page story in the same edition of the newspaper. The lead story plays fear and fascination off against each other as its key point of interest, and in doing so ensures that various gender and racial myths and stereotypes are maintained in ideological circulation...|$|R

5000|$|Her {{statement}} {{taken in}} the Douglas Hospital explained while on the beach near Los Angeles, a young couple approached {{and asked her to}} come and pray for their sick child. When she went with them and looked in on the bundle {{in the back seat of}} an automobile, they then shoved her into their car. At the same time a cloth was held over her face loaded with a sickly sweet substance; later speculated to be chloroform with an additive. After awakening, she was no longer clothed in her bathing suit and was wearing a dress. A woman named [...] "Rose," [...] who displayed professional nursing skills, looked after her. Held for a time in what was a boarded up room in a house that appeared to be an urban area, she was later moved to the remote shack in Mexico. Trying to elicit some personal information to prove they had her, one of her captors burned McPherson's hand with his cigar, but felt bad about it and stopped. McPherson's statement gave details on how she escaped the desert shack while her assailants were out on errands. She cut her bonds on a metal can lid, a technique she later successfully demonstrated several times before skeptical reporters; and climbed out the shack's back window. Using a mountain to navigate, she made her way north. She told how she used her garments to shield herself from the afternoon sun and carefully stepped around any shaggy bushes in her path. In the evening, lights from a town guided her to its streets. Terrified by the unexpected savagery of nearby barking dogs behind a fence, she entered the yard of a Mexican couple, R. R. Gonzales and his wife. Her story was transmitted and transcribed across telegraph and phone lines becoming <b>front-page</b> international <b>news.</b>|$|R
40|$|Cataloged from PDF {{version of}} article. Thesis (Ph. D.) : Bilkent University, Department of Computer Engineering, İhsan Doğramacı Bilkent University, 2017. Includes bibliographical {{references}} (leaves 85 - 97). News streams have several research {{opportunities for the}} past, present, and future of events. The past hides relations among events and actors; the present re ects needs of news readers; and the future waits to be predicted. The thesis has three studies regarding these time periods: We discover news chains using zigzagged search in the past, select <b>front-page</b> of current <b>news</b> for the public, and lter microblogs for predicting future public reactions to events. In the rst part, given an input document, we develop a framework for discovering story chains in a text collection. A story chain {{is a set of}} related news articles that reveal how different events are connected. The framework has three complementary parts that i) scan the collection, ii) measure the similarity between chain-member candidates and the chain, and iii) measure similarity among news articles. For scan- ning, we apply a novel text-mining method that uses a zigzagged search that reinves- tigates past documents based on the updated chain. We also utilize social networks of news actors to reveal connections among news articles. We conduct two user studies in terms of four effectiveness measures: relevance, coverage, coherence, and ability to disclose relations. The rst user study compares several versions of the framework, by varying parameters, to set a guideline for use. The second compares the framework with 3 baselines. The results show that our method provides sta- tistically signi cant improvement in effectiveness in 61...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{describes}} and analyzes {{implications of}} going from hypertext news to hypermedia news {{through a process}} of design, involving users and producers. As in any product development, it is difficult to conceive design of a novel news format that does not relate to earlier genres, and thus to antecedent designs. The hypothesis is that this problem can be addressed by explicitly taking a genre perspective to guide interaction design. This thesis draws on genre theory, which has previously been used in rhetoric, literature, and information systems. It is also informed by theories from humancomputer interaction. The methodological approach is a case study of the ELIN project, in which new tools for online hypermedia newspaper production were developed and integrated. The study follows the project from concept design to interaction design and implementation of user interfaces, over three years. The thesis makes three contributions. Firstly, a genre perspective on interaction design is described, revealing broadly in what respects genre affects design. Secondly, the online newspaper genre is described. Based on a content analysis of online newspaper front-pages, and interviews with users and producers, genre specific design recommendations regarding hypertext <b>news</b> <b>front-page</b> design are given. A content analysis of Swedish online newspapers provides a basis for a design rationale of the context stream element, which {{is an important part of}} the news context on article pages. Regarding hypervideo news, design rationale is given for the presentation of hypervideo links, in the context of a hypermedia news site. The impact on news production in terms of dynamics of convergence is also discussed. Thirdly, the design processes in cooperative scenario building workshops are evaluated, regarding how the users and producers were able to contribute. It provides implications and lessons learned for the workshop phase model. A discourse analysis also reveals important facilitator skills and how participants relied on genre in the design process...|$|R

25|$|The sudden {{capture of}} a {{bridge across the}} Rhine was <b>front-page</b> <b>news</b> in American newspapers. The {{unexpected}} availability of a bridgehead {{on the eastern side}} of the Rhine more than two weeks in advance of the planned crossing allowed Allied high commander Dwight Eisenhower to alter his plans to end the war. The Allies were able to rapidly transport five divisions across the Rhine into the Ruhr, Germany's industrial heartland. The bridge had endured months of aircraft bombing, direct artillery hits, near misses, and deliberate demolition attempts. It finally collapsed at 3:00 pm on 17 March. Twenty-eight American engineers were killed and sixty-three were wounded. But by then U.S. Army combat engineers had finished building a tactical steel treadway bridge and a heavy duty pontoon bridge followed by a Bailey bridge across the Rhine. Over 25,000 troops crossed into Germany before the Americans broke out of the bridgehead on 25 March 1945. This was 18 days after the bridge had been captured. German and American military authorities agreed that capturing the bridge shortened the war. The Ludendorff Bridge was not rebuilt following World War II.|$|E
