500|$|The {{developments}} {{in the relationship between}} Brittany and Santana received considerable attention. John Kubicek of BuddyTV thought the plot was pointless, and said it [...] "boiled down to: I'm not ready to come out. I'm ready. Now I'm not again." [...] He added, [...] "If you're going to have Santana question herself, at least show it and don't <b>have</b> <b>it</b> <b>all</b> happen off screen." [...] Both Hankinson and Respers France were impressed by the acting of both Morris and Rivera. Hankinson wrote, [...] "It feels like their relationship is developing organically", while Respers France commended Morris for Brittany's breakup scene with Artie, and Rivera for far surpassing her expectations.|$|E
500|$|Burshtein found {{creating}} a believable relationship between Yiftach Klein and Hadas Yaron {{to be one}} of the more challenging aspects of the production. She hoped to keep the relationship between Yochay and Shira enigmatic, with a strong undercurrent of tension, throughout the film. One method of doing so was ensuring that the actors never touched while filming. She explained, [...] "That's how we see the enigma—the power of wanting and then restraining. The restraining is the power. The passion cannot exist if you <b>have</b> <b>it</b> <b>all</b> the time—the passion is only for something that you don't have. You have to work to keep the passion. Judaism is all about that." [...] Burshtein considered including a scene in which Shira and Yochay kissed about halfway through the movie but decided against it, believing that the energy would be lost.|$|E

500|$|... "Cherry on Top" [...] is a pop and R {{track with}} a {{duration}} of three minutes and 48 seconds. Unlike the majority of Oh Land's songs, it is not an uptempo track. Instead, it contains [...] "piano instrumentals" [...] and [...] "light background harmonies". It features lyrics with a [...] "relatable" [...] message and [...] "figurative imagery". Oh Land herself stated that the song is about [...] "always going for the win, always focusing on the result and sometimes missing the process because you're such a perfectionist". According to Paul MacInnes from The Guardian, the lyrics serve as a [...] "plea to a lover about the pitfalls of excess"; the song opens with Oh Land singing, [...] "Small boy, big dreams / Going in for a bite", which is [...] "sublimely literal". She proceeds in the chorus: [...] "You can <b>have</b> <b>it</b> <b>all</b> but you never stop / 'Cause all you ever want is the cherry on top" [...] / [...] "And all you ever dreamed of, it ain't enough / You'll never fill that hole with the cherry on top".|$|E
500|$|On March 13, 2006, Hayes {{announced}} that he was quitting the show because of the series' treatment of religion, saying, [...] "There is a place in this world for satire, but there is a time when satire ends and intolerance and bigotry towards religious beliefs of others begins. Religious beliefs are sacred to people, and at all times should be respected and honored. As a civil rights activist of the past 40 years, I cannot support a show that disrespects those beliefs and practices." [...] The Guardian observed that Hayes did not specifically mention Scientology in his statement. Later in an interview on CNN's Showbiz Tonight, Hayes added he did not see the episode itself, but was told about it. In a separate interview, he reportedly said regarding Parker and Stone, [...] "Guys, you <b>have</b> <b>it</b> <b>all</b> wrong. We're not like that. I know that's your thing, but get your information correct, because somebody might believe that shit, you know? But I understand what they're doing. I told them to take a couple of Scientology courses, and understand what we do." ...|$|E
500|$|Similar to {{the work}} in Shaun of the Dead, blood and gore was {{prevalent}} throughout the film. Visual effects supervisor Richard Briscoe revealed the rationale for using the large amounts of blood: [...] "In many ways, the more extreme you make it, the more people know it is stylised and enjoy the humour inherent in how ridiculous it is. It's rather like the (eventually) limbless Black Knight in Monty Python's Holy Grail." [...] The most time-consuming gore sequence involved a character's head being crushed by a section of a church. A dummy was used against a green screen and the head was detonated at the point when the object was about to impact the body. Throughout the film, over seventy gunfight shots were digitally augmented; Briscoe's rationale for adding the additional effects was that [...] "The town square shootout, for example, is full of extra little hits scattered throughout, so that it feels like our hero characters really do <b>have</b> <b>it</b> <b>all</b> going off, all around them. It was a great demonstration of [...] seemingly very trivial enhancements {{can make a difference}} when combined across a sequence." ...|$|E

500|$|By {{the mid-1960s}} Harrison {{had become an}} admirer of Indian culture and mysticism, {{introducing}} {{it to the other}} Beatles. During the filming of Help! in the Bahamas, they met the founder of Sivananda Yoga, Swami Vishnu-devananda, who gave each of them a signed copy of his book, The Complete Illustrated Book of Yoga. Between {{the end of the last}} Beatles tour in 1966 and the beginning of the Sgt Pepper recording sessions, he made a pilgrimage to India with his wife Pattie; there, he studied sitar with Ravi Shankar, met several gurus, and visited various holy places. In 1968 he travelled to Rishikesh in northern India with the other Beatles to study meditation with Maharishi Mahesh Yogi. Harrison's use of psychedelic drugs encouraged his path to meditation and Hinduism. He commented: [...] "For me, it was like a flash. The first time I had acid, it just opened up something in my head that was inside of me, and I realized a lot of things. I didn't learn them because I already knew them, but that happened to be the key that opened the door to reveal them. From the moment I had that, I wanted to <b>have</b> <b>it</b> <b>all</b> the time – these thoughts about the yogis and the Himalayas, and Ravi's music." ...|$|E
500|$|The main cast {{includes}} Eddie Cibrian, who {{was cast}} as Nick Dalton, the central {{character in the}} series. In an interview with The Hollywood Reporter, Cibrian stated that Dalton was a [...] "chameleon" [...] and very charismatic. He continued: [...] "On the facade, he seems to <b>have</b> <b>it</b> <b>all.</b> He's very successful. He's dating the head Playboy bunny. He's {{one of the first}} keyholders at the Playboy Club, but he has a very mysterious past." [...] Jeff Hephner was originally approached for the role after performing well in test auditions, but Hephner had no prior experience playing a television lead before, and the producers decided to let him go after the full cast table. Cibrian was cast just a few days before filming began. Amber Heard was approached by producers of the show to portray Bunny Maureen. Although the series premiere started with Nick helping Maureen out of a difficult situation, Heard said of the character, [...] "Don't underestimate that character and her intelligence, and the journey that she's going to take to really rise above that. [...] I think Maureen allows herself to be helped when she needs it, and by no means relies on any character, male or female, in this story, and never has." ...|$|E
500|$|In December 1902, the German {{government}} asked Roosevelt to arbitrate its {{dispute with}} Venezuela over unpaid debts. [...] Hay {{did not think}} this appropriate, as Venezuela also owed the U.S. money, and quickly arranged for the International Court of Arbitration in The Hague to step in. [...] Hay supposedly said, as final details were being worked out, [...] "I <b>have</b> <b>it</b> <b>all</b> arranged. [...] If Teddy will {{keep his mouth shut}} until tomorrow noon!" [...] Hay and Roosevelt also differed over the composition of the Joint High Commission that was to settle the Alaska boundary dispute. [...] The commission was to be composed of [...] "impartial jurists" [...] and the British and Canadians duly appointed notable judges. [...] Roosevelt appointed politicians, including Secretary Root and Senator Lodge. [...] Although Hay was supportive of the President's choices in public, in private he protested loudly to Roosevelt, complained by letter to his friends, and offered his resignation. [...] Roosevelt declined it, but the incident confirmed him in his belief that Hay was too much of an Anglophile to be trusted where Britain was concerned. [...] The American position on the boundary dispute was imposed on Canada by a 4–2 vote, with the one English judge joining the three Americans.|$|E

500|$|... "Castle Walls" [...] {{lasts for}} a {{duration}} of 5:29 (five minutes and twenty nine seconds) {{and is a}} hip hop and electro song. The song features a Europop keyboard in its arrangement. Nathan Rabin from The A.V. Club wrote that the lyrics of [...] "Castle Walls" [...] "offer similarly incisive and only occasionally self-pitying commentary on the tragedy and triumph of being young, black, rich, famous, and a repeat felon." [...] The song begins with the chorus, in which Aguilera sings, [...] "Everyone thinks that I <b>have</b> <b>it</b> <b>all</b> / But it's so empty living behind these castle walls (These castle walls) / If I should tumble if I should fall/ Would anyone hear me screaming behind these castle walls? / There's no one here at all, behind these castle walls." [...] After the chorus, T.I. raps the verse [...] "See with the Phantoms and Ferraris in the driveway / But you see it came in exchange of a sane man's sanity / Your vision jaded by the Grammys on the mantlepiece / Just switch your camera lenses, {{you will see the}} agony" [...] over a [...] "warbling" [...] electronic background and hip hop beats. Towards the song's conclusion, there is a [...] "sad" [...] string arrangement and an electronica-influenced [...] "triumphantly striding beat." [...] An editor from HipHopDX compared [...] "Castle Walls" [...] to [...] "Love the Way You Lie" [...] by Eminem featuring Rihanna, which was also produced by da Kid.|$|E

A skinhead that told Davis to [...] "go back to Bakersfield" [...] attempted to hit Davis but he dodged and the band's road manager, Jeff, knocked the skinhead out. [...] "Helmet in the Bush" [...] was about Davis' drug abuse, and the fear that gripped him {{at the height of}} his drug problem. He pleaded for a divine intervention to deliver him from his nightmare, as if he cannot help himself. Davis explained: [...] "I'd wake up in the morning and do a line to get out of bed. Speed in the morning, I'd <b>have</b> <b>it</b> <b>all</b> lined up for breakfast so when I'd lay down and go to sleep, I'd wake up and just snort and it's like 'Yeah, okay, I'm up. ' It was bad. It's like, you do one line and stay up all night, but then you have shit to do the next day so you have to do another line to be able keep staying up to get that shit done. Eventually you start spinning-out from sleep deprivation. You get hallucinations and shit like that." [...] Davis said that [...] "Helmet in the Bush" [...] "is about meth. It's about when you do meth and you look down at your dick and it's literally a helmet in the bush [...] ". [...] "Basically it's what happens when you do too much drugs and your girl wanna get with you and you got some man problems down below.

2500|$|In an {{interview}} for The A.V. Club on January 4, 2006, Hayes was again asked about the episode.

I know that’s your thing, but get your information correct, because somebody might believe that shit, you know?" [...] He then told them {{to take a couple}} of Scientology courses to understand what they do.
