40|$|Cells live together, but die singly", this {{sentence}} wrote the German physiologist Theodor Engelmann in 1875 {{and although he}} had no particular knowledge of gap <b>junction</b> <b>channels</b> (their structure was discovered around 100 years later) he described their functions very well: gap <b>junction</b> <b>channels</b> are essential for intercellular communication and crucial {{for the development of}} tissue and organs. But besides providing an opportunity for cells to communicate gap <b>junction</b> <b>channels</b> might also prevent intercellular communication by channel closure thereby preserving the surrounding healthy tissue in case of cellular necrosis. According to today’s understanding gap <b>junction</b> <b>channels</b> play an important role during embryonic development, during growth, wound healing and cell differentiation and are also involved in the process of learning. In the past decades most intensive research was done not only to unravel the physiological role of gap <b>junction</b> <b>channels</b> but also to extend our knowledge of the contribution of these channels in pathogenesis. A new frontier emerges in the field "pharmacology of gap junctions" with the aim to control growth, differentiation, or electrical coupling via targeting gap <b>junction</b> <b>channels</b> pharmacologically. As we know today disturbances in gap junction synthesis, assembly and cellular distribution may account for various organic disorders from most different medical fields, such as the Charcot-Marie-Tooth neuropathy, epilepsy, Chagas-disease, Naxos-syndrome, congenital cardiac malformations, arrhythmias, cancer and as a very common disease in industrial countries atherosclerosis. Point mutations in gap <b>junction</b> <b>channels</b> have been found to cause hereditary diseases like the congenital deafness or the Charcot-Marie-Tooth neuropathy but the exact molecular mechanisms of gap junction malfunction from most of the mentioned illnesses are not fully understood. Moreover, {{in the last few years}} research has expanded on the role and function of connexin hemichannels and on a relatively new field the pannexins. The purpose of this volume is to give a comprehensive overview of the involvement of gap <b>junction</b> <b>channels,</b> hemichannels and pannexins on pathogenesis of inborn and acquired diseases and on emerging pharmacological strategies to target these channels. We welcome our colleagues to contribute their findings on the influence of gap junctions on pathogenesis and to unravel the secrets of intercellular communication. Take the lid off...|$|R

50|$|The {{assembly}} of connexons begins with synthesis of connexins within the cell {{and ends with}} the formation of gap <b>junction</b> <b>channel</b> plaques on the cell membrane. The connexin subunit proteins that make up connexons are synthesized on the membranes of the cells endoplasmic reticulum. These subunits are then oligomerized, or combined with other smaller parts, into connexons in the golgi apparatus. The connexons are then delivered to their proper location on the plasma membrane. Connexons then dock with compatible connexons from the neighboring cell to form gap <b>junction</b> <b>channel</b> plaques. A large part of this process is mediated by phosphorylation of different enzymes and proteins, allowing and preventing interaction between certain proteins.|$|E
50|$|Connexin-43 is a 43.0 kDa protein {{composed}} of 382 amino acids. GJA1 contains a long C-terminal tail, an N-terminal domain, and multiple transmembrane domains. The protein {{passes through the}} phospholipid bilayer four times, leaving its C- and N-terminals exposed to the cytoplasm. The C-terminal tail is {{composed of}} 50 amino acids and includes post-translational modification sites, as well as binding sites for transcription factors, cytoskeleton elements, and other proteins. As a result, the C-terminal tail is central to functions such as regulating pH gating and channel assembly. Notably, the DNA region of the GJA1 gene encoding this tail is highly conserved, indicating that it is either resistant to mutations or becomes lethal when mutated. Meanwhile, the N-terminal domain is involved in channel gating and oligomerization and, thus, may control the switch between the channel’s open and closed states. The transmembrane domains form the gap <b>junction</b> <b>channel</b> while the extracellular loops facilitate proper channel docking. Moreover, two extracellular loops form disulfide bonds that interact with two hexamers to form a complete gap <b>junction</b> <b>channel.</b>|$|E

[...] Overexpression of Cx30 in Cx30 null mice restored Cx26 expression and normal gap <b>junction</b> <b>channel</b> functioning and calcium signaling, but it is described that Cx26 expression is altered in Cx30 null mice.

The hemichannels feature a positively charged cytoplasmic entrance, a funnel, a negatively charged transmembrane pathway, and an extracellular cavity. The pore is narrowed at the funnel, which is formed by the six amino-terminal helices lining the wall of the channel, which thus determines the molecular size restriction at the channel entrance.|$|E
5000|$|Each gap {{junction}} (aka nexus junction) contains numerous {{gap junction}} channels that cross the membranes of both cells.

Thus when the membrane potential of one cell changes, ions may move through from one cell to the next, carrying positive charge with them and depolarizing the postsynaptic cell.|$|E
5000|$|Communicating {{junctions}}, or gap junctions {{allow for}} direct chemical communication between adjacent cellular cytoplasm through diffusion without {{contact with the}} extracellular fluid. This is possible due to six connexin proteins interacting to form a cylinder with a pore in the centre called a connexon. The connexon complexes stretches across the cell membrane and when two adjacent cell connexons interact, they form a complete gap <b>junction</b> <b>channel.</b> [...] Connexon pores vary in size, polarity and therefore can be specific depending on the connexin proteins that constitute each individual connexon. Whilst variation in gap junction channels do occur, their structure remains relatively standard, and this interaction ensures efficient communication without the escape of molecules or ions to the extracellular fluid.|$|E
40|$|Gap <b>junction</b> <b>channels</b> are {{sites of}} cytoplasmic {{communication}} between contacting cells. In vertebrates, they consist of protein subunits denoted connexins (Cxs) which are encoded by a gene family. According to their Cx composition, gap <b>junction</b> <b>channels</b> show different gating and permeability properties that define which ions and small molecules permeate them. Differences in Cx primary sequences suggest that channels composed of different Cxs are regulated differentially by intracellular pathways under specific physiological conditions. Functional roles of gap <b>junction</b> <b>channels</b> could {{be defined by}} {{the relative importance of}} permeant substances, resulting in coordination of electrical and/or metabolic cellular responses. Cells of the native and specific immune systems establish transient homo- and heterocellular contacts at various steps of the immune response.

50|$|In biology, a connexon, {{also known}} as a connexin hemichannel, is an {{assembly}} of six proteins called connexins that form the pore for a gap junction between the cytoplasm of two adjacent cells. This channel allows for bidirectional flow of ions and signaling molecules. The connexon is the hemichannel supplied by a cell {{on one side of the}} junction; two connexons from opposing cells normally come together to form the complete intercellular gap <b>junction</b> <b>channel.</b> However, in some cells, the hemichannel itself is active as a conduit between the cytoplasm and the extracellular space, allowing the transference of ions and small molecules lower than 1-2 KDa. Little is known about this function of connexons besides the new evidence suggesting their key role in intracellular signaling.|$|E
50|$|Thus, {{according}} to the modern lipid hypothesis anaesthetics do not act directly on their membrane protein targets, but rather perturb specialized lipid matrices at the protein-lipid interface, which act as mediators. This is {{a new kind of}} transduction mechanism, different from the usual key-lock interaction of ligand and receptor, where the anaesthetic (ligand) affects the function of membrane proteins by binding to the specific site on the protein. Thus, some membrane proteins are proposed to be sensitive to their lipid environment. A slightly different detailed molecular mechanism of how bilayer perturbation can influence the ion-channel was proposed in the same year. Oleamide (fatty acid amide of oleic acid) is an endogenous anaesthetic found in vivo (in the cat’s brain) and it is known to potentiate sleep and lower the temperature of the body by closing the gap <b>junction</b> <b>channel</b> connexion. The detailed mechanism is shown on the picture: the well-ordered lipid(green)/cholesterol(yellow) ring that exists around connexon (magenta) becomes disordered on treatment with anaesthetic (red triangles), promoting a closure of connexon ion channel. This decreases brain activity and induces lethargy and anaesthetic effect.|$|E
50|$|The dual-cell {{voltage clamp}} {{technique}} is a specialized {{variation of the}} two electrode voltage clamp, and is only {{used in the study}} of gap junction channels. Gap junctions are pores that directly link two cells through which ions and small metabolites flow freely. When two cells in which gap junction proteins are expressed either endogenously or via injection of mRNA, a <b>junction</b> <b>channel</b> will form between the cells. Since two cells are present in the system, two sets of electrodes are used. A recording electrode and a current injecting electrode are inserted into each cell, and each cell is clamped individually (each set of electrodes is attached to a separate apparatus, and integration of data is performed by computer). To record junctional conductance, the current is varied in the first cell while the recording electrode in the second cell records any changes in Vm for the second cell only. (The process can be reversed with the stimulus occurring in the second cell and recording occurring in the first cell.) Since no variation in current is being induced by the electrode in the recorded cell, any change in voltage must be induced by current crossing into the recorded cell, through the gap junction channels, from the cell in which the current was varied.|$|E
40|$|Cardiac {{conduction}} {{is mediated}} by gap <b>junction</b> <b>channels</b> that are formed by connexin (Cx) protein subunits. The connexin family of proteins consists of 24 members, varying in their biophysical properties {{and ability to}} combine with other connexins into heteromeric gap <b>junction</b> <b>channels.</b> The mammalian heart shows regional differences both in connexin expression profile and in degree of electrical coupling. The latter reflects functional requirements for conduction velocity, which needs to be low in the sinoatrial and atrioventricular nodes and high in the ventricular conduction system. Over the past 20 years, knowledge of the biology of gap <b>junction</b> <b>channels</b> and {{their role in the}} genesis of cardiac arrhythmias has increased enormously. This review focuses on the insights gained from transgenic mouse models. The mouse heart expresses Cx 30, 30. 2, 37, 40, 43, 45 and 46. For these connexins, a variety of knock-outs, heart-specific knock-outs, conditional knock-outs, double knock-outs, knock-ins and overexpressers has been studied. We discuss the cardiac phenotype in these models and compare Cx expression between mice and men. Mouse models have enhanced our understanding of (patho) -physiological implications of Cx diversity in the heart. In principle, connexin-specific modulation of electrical coupling in the heart represents an interesting treatment strategy for cardiac arrhythmias and conduction disorders...|$|R
40|$|Connexins are {{ubiquitous}} channel forming {{proteins that}} assemble as plasma membrane hemichannels and as intercellular gap <b>junction</b> <b>channels</b> that directly connect cells. In the heart, gap <b>junction</b> <b>channels</b> electrically connect myocytes and specialized conductive tissues {{to coordinate the}} atrial and ventricular contraction/relaxation cycles and pump function. In blood vessels, these channels facilitate long-distance endothelial cell communication, synchronize smooth muscle cell contraction, and support endothelial-smooth muscle cell communication. In {{the central nervous system}} they form cellular syncytia and coordinate neural function. Gap <b>junction</b> <b>channels</b> are normally open and hemichannels are normally closed, but pathologic conditions may restrict gap junction communication and promote hemichannel opening, thereby disturbing a delicate cellular communication balance. Until recently, most connexin-targeting agents exhibited little specificity and several off-target effects. Recent work with peptide-based approaches has demonstrated improved specificity and opened avenues for a more rational approach toward independently modulating the function of gap junctions and hemichannels. We here review the role of connexins and their channels in cardiovascular and neurovascular health and disease, focusing on crucial regulatory aspects and identification of potential targets to modify their function. We conclude that peptide-based investigations have raised several new opportunities for interfering with connexins and their channels that may soon allow preservation of gap junction communication, inhibition of hemichannel opening, and mitigation of inflammatory signaling...|$|R
