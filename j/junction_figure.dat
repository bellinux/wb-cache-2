Computerized tomography (CT) revealed blood in the basal cisterns and Sylvian fissures, intraventricular hemorrhage, hydrocephalus and a hematoma in the ponto-mesencephalic <b>junction</b> (<b>Figure</b> 1). After external ventricular drainage, the Glasgow Coma Scale improved to 15.

The region where electrons can tunnel through the barrier is called the tunneling region. There, the voltage must be low enough so that energy of some electrons who are tunneling is equal to energy states available {{on the other side of}} the barrier. Consequently, current density through the tunnel junction is high (with maximum value of , the peak current density) and the slope near the origin is therefore steep. Then, the resistance is extremely low and consequently, the voltage too. This is why tunnel junctions are ideal for connecting two pn junctions without having a voltage drop. When voltage is higher, electrons cannot cross the barrier because energy states are no longer available for electrons. Therefore, the current density decreases and the differential resistance is negative.

40|$|Here is {{a method}} for using {{measured}} data to accurately describe {{the behavior of a}} varactor diode, providing the CAD simulator with a model that corresponds to actual device performance An accurate model for the varactor diode is necessary when designing a voltage controlled oscillator (VCO) using CAD simulation. In order to predict tuning range, start up gain, and phase noise, the resonator must be accurately modeled over the frequency range of the oscillations. The varactor diode used for tuning has a predominant effect on the Q, phase noise and tuning range of the resonator. If the varactor model is inaccurate, the results of the most elaborate computer simulation will be misleading and the oscillator, when built, may have disappointing performance. Varactor Diode Model Figure 1 shows a commonly used lumped element varactor diode model. The values for package inductance and capacitance, Lp and Cp shown are typical for an 0805 surface mount part. The values for junction capacitance, Cj and Q are supplied by the manufacturer and are almost always specified at a low frequency, usually 50 MHz, and a bias voltage of – 4 Volts. Q is defined by Q = 1 /ωCjRs. This formula can be used to calculate the series resistance Rs of the varactor model at the measured frequency, however at microwave frequencies additional losses often result in a significantly higher value for Rs. Also, Rs decreases with increasing bias voltage as the width of the depletion region around the PN junction increases, reducing the length of the conductive path through the bulk semiconductor material surrounding the <b>junction.</b> <b>Figure</b> 1 · Lumped element model of varactor diode using manufacturer’s specifications...|$|E

40|$|We use {{point contact}} Andreev {{reflection}} spin spectroscopy {{to measure the}} transport spin polarization of MnAs epitaxial films grown on (001) GaAs. By analyzing both the temperature dependence of the contact resistance and the phonon spectra of lead acquired simultaneously with the spin polarization measurements, we demonstrate that all the point contacts are in the ballistic limit. A ballistic transport spin polarization of approximately 49 % and 44 % is obtained for the type A and type B orientations of MnAs, respectively. These measurements are consistent with our density functional calculations, and with recent observations of a large tunnel magnetoresistance in MnAs/AlAs/(Ga,Mn) As tunnel <b>junctions.</b> Comment: 5 <b>Figure...</b>|$|R
