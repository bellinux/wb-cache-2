5|$|The embassy {{building}} was severely damaged by fire. It {{was more than}} a decade before the British and Iranian governments came to an agreement whereby the United Kingdom would repair the damage to the embassy in London and <b>Iran</b> <b>would</b> pay for repairs to the British embassy in Tehran, which had been damaged during the 1979 Iranian Revolution. Iranian diplomats began working from 16 Princes Gate again in December 1993.|$|E
5|$|The first {{match of}} the Afghan team was {{scheduled}} with Iran on September 28 at the Busan Gudeok Stadium. The Iranian team dominated the match, winning by {{a score of}} 10 to 0. Alireza Vahedi Nikbakht scored five goals in the match. This was the largest margin of victory for Iran in the tournament. <b>Iran</b> <b>would</b> win the gold medal after defeating Japan in the final.|$|E
5|$|The {{decision}} came at {{a delicate}} time for relations between Iran and Western nations, which were removing sanctions on Iran after its compliance with an agreement for curtailing development of its nuclear enrichment program. The agreement stipulated that once Iranian compliance with {{the terms of the}} agreement was verified, most sanctions against <b>Iran</b> <b>would</b> be lifted, including all sanctions imposed by the United Nations Security Council as well as nuclear-related European Union and U.S. sanctions; U.S. sanctions against Iran for terrorism, human rights abuses, and ballistic missiles would not be affected. In mid-January 2016, most sanctions were lifted. In March, the District Court for the Southern District of New York found, by default, that Iran had provided support to certain terrorist groups and individuals responsible for the September 11 attacks and awarded $10.5billion in damages to the plaintiffs, which consisted of $3billion to reimburse insurance companies for paid claims and $7.5billion for victims and their families ($2million for pain and suffering and $6.88million in punitive damages per victim). The same judge ruled just six months earlier that there was insufficient evidence linking Saudi Arabia—which has sour relations with Iran—to the 9/11 attacks to overcome, under the terrorism exemption, Saudi Arabia's immunity under the FSIA.|$|E

50|$|On 18 January 2012 Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov {{warned that}} {{sanctions}} {{are aimed at}} strangling the economy of <b>Iran</b> and <b>would</b> create much discontent toward Western nations, and potentially provoke a negative recourse.|$|R
25|$|If Obama {{strikes a}} “bad deal” with <b>Iran</b> that <b>would</b> put Israel at risk, “I would bomb the living {{daylights out of}} these sons of bitches,” Saban said {{at a meeting of}} the Israeli American Council.|$|R
25|$|After Iranian banks blacklisted by the EU were {{disconnected}} from the SWIFT banking network, Israeli Finance Minister Yuval Steinitz stated that <b>Iran</b> <b>would</b> now find {{it more difficult to}} export oil and import products. According to Steinitz, <b>Iran</b> <b>would</b> be forced to accept only cash or gold, which is impossible when dealing with billions of dollars. Steinitz told the Israeli cabinet that Iran's economy might collapse as a result.|$|E
25|$|On July 12, Iranian {{official}} Mojtaba Zolnour said that, if attacked, <b>Iran</b> <b>would</b> destroy Israel and 32 United States bases.|$|E
25|$|In 2012, the U.S. Energy Department {{warned that}} {{imposing}} oil embargoes on <b>Iran</b> <b>would</b> increase world oil prices by widening {{the gap between}} supply and demand.|$|E
50|$|Around 13 July, a {{classified}} military report concluded that many Iraqi army units were deeply infiltrated by either Sunni extremist informants or Shiite personnel backed by <b>Iran,</b> which <b>would</b> bring Americans advisors to Iraqi forces into danger.|$|R

25|$|On July 4, Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki {{said that}} he will not allow Iraqi land, sea, or {{airspace}} to be used for an attack on Iran. On July 5, Iraqi representative Mahmoud Othman warned that military action against <b>Iran</b> <b>would</b> destabilize Iraq.|$|E
25|$|Another {{effect of}} the sanctions, {{in the form of}} Iran's retaliatory threat to close the Strait of Hormuz, has led to Iraqi plans to open export routes for its crude via Syria, though Iraq's deputy prime {{minister}} for energy affairs doubted <b>Iran</b> <b>would</b> ever attempt a closure.|$|E
25|$|Iran has {{increased}} its publication output nearly tenfold from 1996 through 2004, and has been ranked first in terms of output growth rate, followed by China. According {{to a study by}} SCImago in 2012, <b>Iran</b> <b>would</b> rank fourth in {{the world in terms of}} research output by 2018, if the current trend persists.|$|E
50|$|In 1964, {{during a}} state visit to Iran, Pope and Ackerman were {{formally}} invited {{to move the}} Asia Institute to Shiraz, <b>Iran,</b> where it <b>would</b> be affiliated with Pahlavi University and housed in the Narenjestan.

50|$|In October 1970, an Afghan {{family went}} on pilgrimage from Afghanistan, where {{smallpox}} was endemic, to Mashhad in Iran, triggering a massive epidemic of smallpox in <b>Iran</b> that <b>would</b> last until September 1972.

25|$|On 4 June 2006, Khamenei {{said that}} <b>Iran</b> <b>would</b> disrupt energy {{shipments}} from the Persian Gulf region (about 20% of the world's daily supply of oil passes from the Persian Gulf through the Strait of Hormuz {{very close to}} Iran's coast) should the country come under attack from the US, insisting that Tehran will not give up its right to produce nuclear fuel.|$|E
25|$|On 29 June 2008, the {{commander}} of Iran's Revolutionary Guard, Mohammad Ali Jafari, said that if either Israel or the United States attacked Iran, it would seal off the Strait of Hormuz to wreak havoc in the oil markets. This followed more ambiguous threats from Iran's oil minister and other government officials that an attack on <b>Iran</b> <b>would</b> result in turmoil in the world's oil supply.|$|E
25|$|For example, in Pakistan, Afghanistan and Iran, many liberal women wore short skirts, flower printed hippie dresses, flared trousers, {{and went}} out in public without the hijab. This changed {{following}} the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, military dictatorship in Pakistan, and Iranian revolution of 1979, when traditional conservative attire including the abaya, jilbab and niqab made a comeback. There were demonstrations in Iran in March 1979, after the hijab law was brought in, decreeing that women in <b>Iran</b> <b>would</b> have to wear scarves to leave the house.|$|E
50|$|Esmann has led several pop documentaries {{for artists}} such as Whitney Houston and Jean Paul Gaultier.

50|$|Prince Patrick Ali Pahlavi (پاتریک علی پهلوی; born 1 September 1947) is {{a member}} of the deposed Pahlavi dynasty of Iran and was heir {{presumptive}} from 1954 to 1960.

50|$|The {{party has}} opposed dictating the state {{religion}} in Iran and called for an amendment for the constitution of <b>Iran</b> that <b>would</b> limit absolute power of Supreme leader, while endorsing Guardianship of the Islamic Jurist. In foreign policy, it wants détente with the United States. The party regards itself as being committed to the political thought and legacy of Ruhollah Khomeini.|$|R
25|$|In late February 2006, IAEA Director Mohammad El-Baradei {{raised the}} {{suggestion}} of a deal, whereby <b>Iran</b> <b>would</b> give up industrial-scale enrichment and instead limit its program to a small-scale pilot facility, and agree to import its nuclear fuel from Russia (see nuclear fuel bank). The Iranians indicated that while they would not be willing to give up their right to enrichment in principle, they were willing to consider the compromise solution. However, in March 2006, the Bush Administration {{made it clear that they}} would not accept any enrichment at all in Iran.|$|E
25|$|Iran's former foreign minister, Manouchehr Mottaki {{declared}} that Israel was {{not capable of}} an attack and still recovering from the 2006 war in Lebanon. The Iranian Chief of the Revolutionary Guards, Mohammad Ali Jafari said Israel was within the reach of Iranian missiles and <b>Iran</b> <b>would</b> close the Strait of Hormuz, cutting off two-fifths of the global oil supply. Iran has the capability to close the Strait of Hormuz or impede traffic {{for a month or}} more, and any U.S. attempts to reopen it could escalate the conflict.|$|E
25|$|During the Ottoman reign, {{the city}} {{served as the}} main base of Ottoman {{military}} {{power in the region}} and as the capital of the province. Early in the 17th century, the province was threatened again and taken by Safavid Iran while enduring also a revolt by the province governor Abaza Mehmed Pasha. This revolt was combined with Jelali Revolts (the uprising of the provincial musketeers called the Celali), backed by Safavid Iran and lasted until 1628. However, <b>Iran</b> <b>would</b> reconquered it again, only this time under Nader Shah {{in the first half of}} the 18th century.|$|E
5000|$|On March 29, 2012, {{officials}} said that Israel was granted access to air bases in Azerbaijan through a [...] "series of quiet political and military understandings." [...] These airbases could potentially {{be used in a}} strike against Iran over its nuclear program and other tensions with <b>Iran,</b> and <b>would</b> be allowed by Azerbaijan. Israeli and Azerbaijani officials denied these reports.|$|R
50|$|<b>Iran</b> {{said there}} <b>would</b> {{be some sort}} of American {{representation}} at the conference, however this was denied by the U.S. State Department which stated that no U.S. official had been invited.|$|R
5000|$|Yaakov Shapiro, the Defense Ministry {{official}} {{in charge of}} coordinating the negotiations with Iran from 1975 to 1978, recalls: [...] "In Iran they treated us like kings.

25|$|As the {{fighting}} progressed, Iraq informed Tehran {{that it was}} willing to satisfy Iranian demands in return {{for an end to}} its aid to the Kurds. In March 1975, with mediation by Algerian President Houari Boumédiènne, Iraq and Iran signed the Algiers Accord. According to the accord <b>Iran</b> <b>would</b> quit supplying the Iraqi Kurds in return for the transfer of Iraqi territory to Iran—especially half the width of the Shatt al-Arab, the river through which ships could sail to a number of major Iranian ports. Israel's aid to the Kurds was being transferred through Iran, so Iran's decision also prevented the continuation of Israeli aid to the Kurds (the only other possible route being Turkey which was also hostile {{to the idea of a}} Kurdish autonomy in northern Iraq as a dangerous precedent for the Kurds in eastern Turkey). Following this development, Barzani escaped to Iran with many of his supporters. Others surrendered en masse and the rebellion ended within a short time. The casualties of the war are estimated around 5,000 soldiers and civilians.|$|E
500|$|UK {{diplomatic}} sources, speaking anonymously to The Times, {{said that}} if the government had been asked, it would have advised against the creation of the scholarship, because <b>Iran</b> <b>would</b> see it as an act of provocation, and because it would interfere with efforts to free Iranians working for the British Embassy in Tehran who had been detained for participating in the post-election protests. The sources said the scholarship had put [...] "another nail into the coffin" [...] of relations between Britain and Iran.|$|E
500|$|Brown {{was known}} for the {{directness}} of his speech, which sometimes offended those around him. Asked to comment in an interview for Newsweek on his opinion of the British Armed Forces, Brown replied, [...] "They're no longer a world power. All they've got are generals, admirals and bands." [...] Reaction in Britain was mixed. Some, like Lord Allenby condemned Brown's remarks, while others, like Lord Monckton acknowledged {{the truth of the}} remarks. [...] Brown also said that Israel was a [...] "burden" [...] to the United States, and predicted that <b>Iran</b> <b>would</b> become an important military power in the Middle East.|$|E
50|$|Friedman advocates {{that the}} United States draw back from Israel, which is {{strategically}} secure, fully capable of surviving on its own, {{and is no}} longer heavily dependent on the US, and slightly re-orient towards Arab states to create a balance of power. He also advocates a deal with <b>Iran</b> which <b>would</b> essentially allow it a secure sphere of influence in the region and an alliance with Turkey to counterbalance Iran and Israel.|$|R
50|$|According {{to former}} Iraqi general Ra'ad al-Hamdani, the Iraqis {{believed}} {{that in addition}} to the Arab revolts, the Revolutionary Guards would be drawn out of Tehran, leading to a counter-revolution in <b>Iran</b> that <b>would</b> cause Khomeini's government to collapse and thus ensure Iraqi victory. However, rather than turning against the revolutionary government as experts had predicted, Iran's people (including Iranian Arabs) rallied in support of the country and put up a stiff resistance.|$|R
50|$|Full local {{production}} {{began in}} 1985, {{after the original}} British production lines were closed. The new owner in Britain, Peugeot, established a new contract whereby <b>Iran</b> Khodro <b>would</b> manufacture the Paykan with the same body panels but Peugeot 504 engines and suspension, for six more years. This deal has a similarity to one in South Africa, where Hunters were once built with locally made Peugeot 404 engines (from which the 504 units evolved) to meet strict local-content laws applicable in the late 1960s.|$|R
