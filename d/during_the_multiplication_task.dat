The results revealed the activation of a circuit comprising bilateral intraparietal, prefrontal, and anterior cingulate components. The extension and lateralization of this circuit was modulated by task demands. The intraparietal and prefrontal activation was more important in the right hemisphere during the comparison task and in the left hemisphere <b>during</b> <b>the</b> <b>multiplication</b> <b>task</b> and was intensely bilateral during the subtraction task.

40|$|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Current {{models of}} brain {{function}} propose that number processing involves {{the interaction of}} different neuronal networks. Our purpose was to use functional MR (fMR) imaging to elucidate the brain regions engaged by multiplication. METHODS: Eighteen adults underwent fMR imaging while performing matching, multipli-cation, and control tasks. For each task, three or four single-digit or low-value double-digit numbers were presented serially followed by a 12 -second delay. A target stimulus then ap-peared and subjects made a judgement by pressing a button box that recorded responses. During the matching task, subjects judged whether the target stimulus matched one of the previous numbers. <b>During</b> <b>the</b> <b>multiplication</b> <b>task,</b> subjects judged whether the target stimulus {{was the product of}} the previous numbers. For the control task, the numbers were always zeros, and the subjects responded to a target stimulus that was always four zeros. Composite statistical parametric maps of the time course of activation comparing the control task with the matching and multiplication tasks, respectively, were generated and the significance of signal changes was estimated by randomization of statistical parametric maps. RESULTS: The matching and multiplication tasks resulted in activation (P,. 005) in th...|$|E

In Experiment 1, French-speaking participants were asked first to retrieve the product of two numbers presented in Arabic or verbal code, and then to perform a number-matching task on the same material to assess the encoding time difference between numerals in the two formats.

The format effects obtained by Campbell and Clark (1992); Campbell (1994) for multiplication were replicated.

Although most experiments in neuropsychology require participants to perform tasks in an upright position, fMRI requires participants to perform cognitive tests while recumbent and motionless inside a narrow bore.

It has been hypothesized that the horizontal segment of the intraparietal sulcus (hIPS) and the posterior superior parietal lobule (PSPL) contribute to operations solved by calculation procedures, such as subtraction, but whether these areas are also involved in operations solved by memory retrieval, such as multiplication, is controversial. In the present study, we first identified the parietal areas involved in subtraction and multiplication by means of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and we found an increased activation, bilaterally, in the hIPS and PSPL during both arithmetic operations. In order to test whether these areas are causally involved in subtraction and multiplication, we used transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) to create, in each participant, a virtual lesion of either the hIPS or PSPL, over the sites corresponding to the peaks of activation gathered in fMRI.

Bilinguals also performed these tasks in their second language (L 1). Results showed bilingual disadvantage in L 1 verbal working memory. but bilingual advantage in visuo-spatial working memory regardless of language used. A robust relationship was found between L 2 proficiency and verbal short-term and working memory in L 2. LI proficiency predicted verbal and visuo-spatial short-term memory performance in less LI dominant bilinguals. The second study assessed the involvement of working memory in numerical cognition.

40|$|Cell {{proliferation}} and {{the expression of}} differentiated functions are {{generally considered to be}} mutually exclusive states of the cell. Thyrotrophin activates the expression of differentiated functions in dog thyroid cells by means of cyclic AMP. We have recently shown that thyrotrophin also acts through the same intracellular signal molecule to enhance proliferation of dog thyroid cells in primary cultures. In this work we showed that such primary cultures exhibit three successive phases: a latency period <b>during</b> which <b>the</b> expression of differentiated functions (iodide trapping and organification) declined, the cells still being associated with structures derived from the seeded follicles; a cell-proliferation phase with little expression of these functions, the cells being spread in a monolayer; a stationary phase with cell density reaching a plateau but no re-expression of the functions. Thyrotrophin promoted proliferation <b>during</b> <b>the</b> <b>multiplication</b> phase, but induced redifferentiation <b>during</b> <b>the</b> stationary phase. These effects were mimicked by cholera toxin and dibutyryl cyclic AMP, which suggested that they were mediated by cyclic AMP. Iodide uptake was also stimulated by cortisol. Thyrotrophin therefore has a different action in dog thyroid cells depending {{on the state of the}} cells. The spontaneous arrest of multiplication appears to make the cells competent to respond to thyrotrophin by the induction of redifferentiation. Comparative StudyJournal ArticleResearch Support, Non-U.

40|$|Oaks have an {{important}} role in landscape horticulture and urban forestry. There are numerous species native to a variety of habitats in North America and they readily hybridize between species within a taxonomic section (e. g. the white oak or red oak section). Yet their valuable characteristics have been severely underused due to the difficulty of vegetative propagation. Grafting often results in delayed incompatibility and cuttings do not easily root. Hybrids and unique types of oaks are rarely introduced to the nursery industry. This research investigated the potential for using micropropagation as a technique for the asexual propagation of oaks. Immediate challenges were to obtain responsive explants that produced elongated shoots (shoots [GREATER-THAN OR EQUAL TO] 1 cm), to control contamination <b>during</b> <b>the</b> initiation phase and to subculture shoots to achieve multiplication. Results showed 1 mg l- 1 BA (6 -benzylaminopurine) in Woody Plant Medium to have a significant effect (P< 0. 0001) on obtaining responsive explants from young white oak stock plants. GA 3 (Gibberellic acid) added to the growth media was not beneficial for inducing shoot elongation in slow growing or unresponsive explants. Exogenously applied GA 3 used in conjunction with BA in the media may help shoot elongation. Only one subculture was achieved as <b>the</b> <b>multiplication</b> phase proved problematic with shoots arresting in growth and browning.

Control Unit genetares the control signals that synchronize {{the operation of the}} processor which tells the microarchitecture which operation is done at which time. Now <b>during</b> <b>the</b> <b>multiplication</b> partial product is shifted and added. So shifter {{is an important part of}} the processor architecture. Barrel Shifter is an important combinational logic block. It was incorporated in 386 processor and is also used in microcontroller design. Intel has since moved to software implemented shifters in the Pentium 4 Processor Architecture but AMD still uses it. Here the design of the variable width barrel shifter is presented in which we can shift 4 bit, 8 bit, 16 bit, and 32 bit and maximum 64 bit partial product during multiplication. Functionality is check using Modelsim 6. 4 a. Now to generate the gate level netlist Xilinx ISE 9. 2 i is used...|$|R
40|$|It is clear, from (20), {{that for}} this case <b>the</b> <b>multiplication</b> number {{required}} is [Q + (Q + 1) / 2] (L- 1) / 2 instead of Q(L 1). From the above discussions we see that, by suitably arranging arithmetic operations, <b>the</b> number of <b>multiplications</b> required {{can be reduced}} by about 2 S percent. In case that a serial! parallel multiplier (such as Am 2 SLS 14 manufactured by Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.) {{is used for the}} filter imple-mentation,. a 2 S percent reduction on <b>the</b> <b>multiplication</b> opera-tions means a 25 percent increase on the filter speed because almost all nonmultiplication operations can be performed <b>during</b> <b>the</b> first half <b>multiplication</b> cycle of <b>the</b> multiplier while unwanted less significant bits are being generated. IV. CONCLUSIONS In this paper we examine some problems on the implementa...|$|R
