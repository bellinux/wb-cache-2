25|$|Amygdalin {{was first}} {{isolated}} in 1830 from bitter almond seeds (Prunus dulcis) by Pierre-Jean Robiquet and Antoine Boutron-Charlard. Liebig and Wöhler found three <b>hydrolysis</b> <b>products</b> of amygdalin: sugar, benzaldehyde, and prussic acid (hydrogen cyanide). Later research showed that sulfuric acid hydrolyzes it into D-glucose, benzaldehyde, and prussic acid; while hydrochloric acid gives mandelic acid, D-glucose, and ammonia.|$|E
25|$|However, the {{assumption}} that C. michiganensis does not overwinter in the soil is not without controversy. The genome of Clavibacter michiganesis has recently been sequenced and new theories will surely arise once more work has been completed. What is known is that Cmm can use <b>hydrolysis</b> <b>products</b> as carbon and energy sources {{by means of a}} number of ABC transporters and α- and β-glucosidases. This suggests that Cmm can survive in the soil {{as long as there is}} decaying host material present. It has also been determined that the genome of subsp. michiganensis does not have genes that encode for nitrate and nitrate reductases. This means that the bacteria depends on previously reduced nitrogen compounds or amino acids for its nitrogen source. Also lacking in the Cmm genome are genes for assimilatory sulfate reduction, which is associated with an auxotrophy for methionine - one of two amino acids that contain sulphur.|$|E
