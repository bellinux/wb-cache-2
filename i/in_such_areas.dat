5|$|The {{result of}} this power is {{a high level of}} {{organizational}} and policy standardization among the different local jurisdictions allowing them to preserve the uniqueness of their prefecture, city, or town.

The lower rank staff is composed of 84% Russian officials, 10% Kazakhs and 6% Belarusians, proportional to the populations of the member states. The departments enable the Board of the Eurasian Commission to make decisions not only with regard to customs policies, but <b>in</b> <b>such</b> <b>areas</b> as macroeconomics, regulation of economic competition, energy policy and financial policy. The Commission departments are also involved in government procurement and labour migration control.|$|E

5|$|In {{tropical}} {{regions with}} a monsoon or monsoon-like climate, where a drier {{part of the}} year alternates with a wet period as in the Amazon rainforest, different species of broad-leaved trees dominate the forest, some of them being deciduous. In tropical regions with a drier savanna climate and insufficient rainfall to support dense forests, the canopy is not closed, and plenty of sunshine reaches the ground which is covered with grass and scrub. Acacia and baobab are well adapted to living <b>in</b> <b>such</b> <b>areas.</b>|$|E

NATO members regard these partnerships as {{a response}} to the new challenges of the 21st century and as a complement to the G8 and US-EU decisions to support calls for reform from within the Broader Middle East region. The ICI offers practical cooperation with interested nations in the Greater Middle East <b>in</b> <b>such</b> <b>areas</b> as: counter-WMD; counterterrorism; training and education; participation in NATO exercises; the promotion of military interoperability; disaster preparedness and civil emergency planning; tailored advice on defense reform and civil-military relations; and cooperation on border security to help prevent illicit trafficking of drugs, weapons, and people.|$|E
5|$|The Anglo-Saxons {{were the}} first people in {{northern}} Europe to write administrative documents in the vernacular, and law codes in Old English go back to Æthelberht of Kent {{at the beginning of}} the seventh century. The law code of Alfred the Great, from the end of the ninth century, was also written in the vernacular, and he expected his ealdormen to learn it. His code was strongly influenced by Carolingian law going back to Charlemagne <b>in</b> <b>such</b> <b>areas</b> as treason, peace-keeping, organisation of the hundreds and judicial ordeal. It remained in force throughout the tenth century, and Æthelstan's codes were built on this foundation. Legal codes required the approval of the king, but they were treated as guidelines which could be adapted and added to at local level, rather than a fixed canon of regulations, and customary oral law was also important in the Anglo-Saxon period.|$|E

5|$|The {{euphotic}} zone is somewhat arbitrarily defined as {{extending from the}} surface to the depth where the light intensity is approximately 0.1–1% of surface sunlight irradiance, depending on season, latitude and degree of water turbidity. In the clearest ocean water, the {{euphotic zone}} may extend {{to a depth of}} about 150metres, or rarely, up to 200metres. Dissolved substances and solid particles absorb and scatter light, and in coastal regions the high concentration of these substances causes light to be attenuated rapidly with depth. <b>In</b> <b>such</b> <b>areas</b> the euphotic zone may be only a few tens of metres deep or less. The dysphotic zone, where light intensity is considerably less than 1% of surface irradiance, extends {{from the base of the}} euphotic zone to about 1000metres. Extending from the bottom of the photic zone down to the seabed is the aphotic zone, a region of perpetual darkness.|$|E

It is quite common that some areas have different thickness owing to irregularity of the shape.

30|$|High conc. of Mg 2 + and Ca 2 +causes {{of higher}} water alkalinity, high TH, {{authentic}} problems and bitter water taste (Napacho and Manyele 2010). Based on TH classification, 66.7, 29.3, and 3.7 % {{of the local}} samples were grouped as very hard, hard and moderately hard, respectively (Table  1). This shows that high TH {{is a serious problem}} locally. Previous studies reached similar findings (Shindo 1991; Nkotagu 1996; Rwebugisa 2008). Generally, hard water requires more soap, i.e., extra resources {{that could be used for}} other uses <b>in</b> <b>such</b> an <b>area</b> where average households earn < 1 USD/day (URT 2013).
