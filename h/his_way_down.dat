5|$|Celski {{advanced}} to finals of the 1500m after winning 1st {{place in the}} heats, quarterfinals, and semifinals. During the finals, Celski was in the lead with about five laps to go, {{but in the last}} few laps, the three Korean skaters managed to overtake him, sweeping the podium with Kwak Yoon-Gy in 1st. Celski finished in 4th place, in front of teammate Travis Jayner, who came in 6th. The next day, Celski competed in the 500m. During the semifinals, Celski attempted a pass from fourth to third place, but during his pass, François-Louis Tremblay of Canada, in second place at the time, fell, tripping Celski on <b>his</b> <b>way</b> <b>down.</b> Celski finished the race in 3rd, but was then disqualified, while Tremblay advanced. In the 1000m, Celski finished third behind Lee Ho-Suk and Kwak Yoon-Gy with a time of 1:27.515. In the 3000m, Celski again placed third behind Lee Ho-Suk and Kwak Yoon-Gy. Celski finished fourth overall with 39 points. Celski then combined with Jordan Malone, Travis Jayner, and Simon Cho in the 5000m relay to finish second behind South Korea with a time of 6:46.205.|$|E
5|$|Mount Saint Peter Church was {{magnificent}} {{and rose}} {{up on the}} hill, but to many, {{it seemed as if}} it could not really belong to the congregation. It was much richer than Saint Peter Church and {{if it had not been}} labored upon by so many members of the congregation, none would have felt worthy to call it their parish. But since so much work, love, and faith had been spent on this place of worship, parishioners became proud to have the honor of attending Mass there every Sunday. As a construction site, it had held some dangers. On September 28, 1941, a group of teenage boys, just out of high school, were making concrete flooring for the church at the Burrell Construction Company. A large crane operating above them made an unusual movement, causing its bucket, which weighed several tons, to come down with a huge crash right in their midst. All the working tools were completely destroyed but none of the boys were hurt. The bronze door at the front entrance fell on a worker, and everyone believed he had been crushed to death. When ten men lifted the door, they found the worker unharmed underneath it. In another case, an 18-year-old was assigned a job on the tower of the church before it was roofed. No one realized that he had poor eyesight and he fell from the tower while working. On <b>his</b> <b>way</b> <b>down,</b> he was able to grab onto a pulley that was suspended from the tower.|$|E

Near Madam Wood, east of Vermandovillers, France, the battalion was heavily opposed by well-posted German machine-guns. McCarthy, realizing the situation, dashed across the open ground with two men to the nearest post, where, having out-distanced his companions, he put the gun out of action, then continued fighting <b>his</b> <b>way</b> <b>down</b> the trench. Later, having been joined by one of his men, together they bombed their way along the trench until contact was established with an adjoining unit.|$|E
25|$|Lawson in the 1890s {{records that}} a young lady once fell over the cliff near Craig Na'an; however, her Victorian style {{garments}} caught the wind like a parachute and she escaped with her life and some broken bones that soon knit back together. A visitor in a group from Stranraer was not so lucky and fell to his death on <b>his</b> <b>way</b> <b>down</b> from the summit. A shocking death {{was that of a}} lad from Girvan who was sitting amongst loose rocks, pulling out stones and throwing them into the sea when a very large boulder started to move and crushed him. The stone was too heavy to shift and help from the mainland was required to extract the body of the unfortunate victim. In 1887 a ten-year-old boy died whilst collecting eggs at the West Craigs.|$|E
25|$|Although the Cowboys {{eventually}} held a 451–294 {{advantage in}} total offensive yards, the 49ers converted three turnovers into three {{touchdowns in the}} first quarter en route to the 38–28 victory. On the third play of the game, San Francisco cornerback Eric Davis intercepted Aikman's pass, plowing right through the intended target (receiver Kevin Williams) as he snagged the ball out of the air, and returned it 44 yards for a touchdown. On the next Dallas possession, Davis stripped the ball away from receiver Michael Irvin and fellow defensive back Tim McDonald recovered it on the Dallas 39, setting up a 29-yard touchdown pass from Young to running back Ricky Watters, who eluded several Cowboys defenders high-stepping <b>his</b> <b>way</b> <b>down</b> the sideline en route to the goal line in spectacular showboating fashion. Williams then fumbled the ensuing kickoff when hit by 49ers running back Adam Walker. San Francisco kicker Doug Brien recovered the ball at the Cowboys 35-yard line, and then Young went back to work, converting a third and 1 with a 2-yard sneak and then throwing a 14-yard pass to receiver John Taylor. On the next play, Young ran the ball nine yards to the 1-yard line, and running back William Floyd took the ball into the end zone from there to give his team a 21–0 lead with 7:33 left {{in the first quarter}}.|$|E

25|$|The main feud on the Raw brand {{was between}} The Rock and Steve Austin. On the February 20 episode of SmackDown!, The Rock {{returned}} to WWE after a six-month hiatus from wrestling (since SummerSlam). On that evening, {{he was in}} a confrontation with Hulk Hogan before their WrestleMania X8 rematch at No Way Out. At the No Way Out event, The Rock defeated Hogan with the help of Mr. McMahon. On the following night's episode of Raw, The Rock returned to the Raw brand in a 20-man Battle royal that would determine the opponent for the World Heavyweight Championship. Rock however, was unable to win after he was eliminated by Booker T; after the match, Rock criticized Steve Austin for being chosen as the Superstar of the Decade by the WWE fans in January, beginning the feud between Rock and Austin. The following week on Raw, Austin, who was on a long hiatus before returning that previous Sunday at No Way Out, made his WWE television return, as he cut a promo about the WWE fans, before he was interrupted by Rock, who challenged him to a match at WrestleMania because The Rock, himself, was obsessed of not beating Austin at a WrestleMania event by the time they fought at WrestleMania XV and X-Seven during a four-year span. As soon as the challenge was made, Raw General manager, Eric Bischoff, announced that the following week on Raw, Rock would face Booker T in a match, and if he won, he would have the choice to face either Austin or Triple H at WrestleMania. On the March 10 episode of Raw, Rock, with Bischoff's approval, announced that he would pick his own opponent for later that night, {{which turned out to be}} The Hurricane, in hopes for Rock to gain an easy victory. However, Austin made <b>his</b> <b>way</b> <b>down</b> the entrance ramp, which distracted Rock and allowed Hurricane to Roll up Rock into a successful pinfall, which made the Austin-Rock match at WrestleMania official. On the March 24, and final episode of Raw leading into WrestleMania, Austin was banned from entering the arena that night. He managed to enter the arena and attack Rock, however, before Rock fled the ring.|$|E

He commanded Isis in the North Sea, the Skagerrak and in the Baltic Sea, {{as well as with}} the Channel Fleet. Isis was assigned to the Baltic expedition under Admiral Sir Hyde Parker, and joined Rear-Admiral Horatio Nelson's squadron for the Battle of Copenhagen on 2 April 1801. The plan of attack had to be improvised at the last minute, after several ships ran aground while trying to enter the harbour, including Nelson's flagship, [...] Walker took Isis in to engage both his own target as well as Elephants, and ended up fighting two Danish blockships and a 14-gun battery. When eventually Nelson was able to work <b>his</b> <b>way</b> <b>down</b> the line he left Walker at his task and took another position. As he passed, Nelson took off his hat, waved it, and cried, 'Well done, brave Walker! Go on as you have begun; nothing can be better'.

Nelson came aboard Isis the following morning and thanked Walker and his men for their brave efforts.|$|E
500|$|The {{main event}} of the {{pay-per-view}} was the SmackDown Elimination Chamber match for the World Heavyweight Championship, featuring The Undertaker, CM Punk, Rey Mysterio, Chris Jericho, John Morrison, and R-Truth. Mysterio, Morrison, and Jericho entered first and were locked into pods. The Undertaker was the fourth to make <b>his</b> <b>way</b> <b>down</b> to the ring, but an accident occurred during his entrance when his pyrotechnics were mistimed, resulting in him being momentarily engulfed in flames. He was cleared by a ringside doctor to wrestle, however, {{and was able to}} compete in the match. The final two, who were to start the match, were CM Punk, who was accompanied by his stable, the Straight Edge Society of Serena and Luke Gallows, and R-Truth. Punk cut a promo {{on his way to the}} ring, but was interrupted by R-Truth's entrance. Punk was able to eliminate R-Truth in approximately three-and-a-half minutes, before any other competitor had entered the match, and finished his promo afterward. Mysterio entered after the first five minutes had passed, and eliminated Punk before the next competitor entered. The next entrant was revealed to be Jericho, and he and Mysterio wrestled for five minutes until Morrison was released. Morrison utilised his [...] "Starship Pain" [...] finisher (a split-legged corkscrew moonsault) to pin Mysterio and eliminate him from the match. The final entrant into the match was the defending champion The Undertaker, who was able to eliminate Morrison following a chokeslam onto the chamber floor after approximately 28 minutes. Shawn Michaels, who had requested and been denied a match with The Undertaker for WrestleMania, snuck into the chamber, and performed his [...] "Sweet Chin Music" [...] superkick on The Undertaker.
