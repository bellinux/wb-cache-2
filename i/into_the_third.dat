5|$|Lawrie McMenemy {{was brought}} in as manager in 1985, but Sunderland reached the lowest point in their history in 1987, when they {{suffered}} relegation to the Third Division after losing a two-leg play-off to Gillingham.

5|$|After {{dropping}} <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>Third</b> Division, Cardiff were continuously in {{the lower}} two divisions of the Football League between 1985 and 1993 as the club appointed several managers in attempts to stabilize the team's performances. They were relegated to the Fourth Division once in the 1985–86 season and, despite returning to the Third Division on two occasions, in 1996 finished in their lowest-ever league position– 22nd of 24 in Division Three. In 1995, Cardiff and other Welsh clubs competing in English leagues were banned from entering the Welsh Cup by the Football Association of Wales after pressure from UEFA, {{who did not want}} teams playing in two national cup competitions. Their final match in the competition was a 2–1 defeat to Wrexham in the 1995 final.|$|E

5|$|After the Second World War Millwall's {{form was}} {{poor and the}} club dropped <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>Third</b> and Fourth Division of the Football League. West Ham have never played below the Second Division in their history and often played a league or two above Millwall. The two sides did not play each other {{competitively}} between 13 October 1959 and 7 October 1978, making the 1960s the only decade the teams have not met. Despite the infrequency of their meetings, both sets of supporters still consider the other club their major rival. During these years, the Hammers enjoyed considerable success, winning the FA Cup in 1964, 1975 and 1980. They also won the European Cup Winners' Cup in 1965. Over four decades the sides were only in the same tier of the Football League for three seasons, in 1946–47, 1947–48 and 1978–79. They played two cup games {{against each other in}} the Southern Professional Floodlit Cup in 1959 and the Full Members Cup in 1987.|$|E
5|$|Against Georgia, most critics thought Maryland faced {{its first}} true test. In the first quarter, the Terrapins {{took a quick}} 14–0 lead and held the Bulldogs to six {{offensive}} plays, two of which were punts. In the second quarter, Georgia quarterback Zeke Bratkowski led his team to two consecutive touchdown drives, and the score was 21–13 in favor of Maryland at halftime. Two minutes <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>third</b> quarter, Faloney intercepted a Bratkowski pass and returned it for a touchdown. Bratkowski {{was taken out of}} the game after numerous sacks by Stan Jones and Bob Morgan. The 40–13 final result would be the most points the Terrapins allowed during the entire season.|$|E
5|$|Alabama {{continued}} their scoring <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>third</b> quarter with touchdowns {{on their first}} two possessions of the half. The first came on a 38-yard McCarron pass to Amari Cooper on a drive that also saw McCarron complete a pass to his brother Corey McCarron. The second came on a 31-yard Chris Black run that made the score 42–0. With the Crimson Tide significantly up, mostly back-up players completed the fourth quarter. After a long drive stalled at the Mocs' 23-yard line, Eddie Jackson returned a C. J. Board fumble caused by Jonathan Allen to the Chattanooga six-yard line. On the next play, Dee Hart made the final score 49–0 with his six-yard touchdown run. The victory improved Alabama's all-time record against the Mocs to 12–0.|$|E

5|$|Approximately {{five minutes}} <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>third</b> quarter, Namath forged another Jets drive, {{following}} an interception by safety Jim Hudson, {{that ended with}} halfback Bill Mathis scoring a 4-yard touchdown behind blocking guard Dave Herman to give New York a 19–14 lead. The Raiders responded with an 80-yard drive that saw running back Charlie Smith score his first touchdown of the game on a 3-yard pass from Lamonica. The Raiders took a 22–19 lead on a two-point conversion with Lamonica completing the attempt to receiver Hewritt Dixon. During this drive, Hudson was ejected from the game after being called for a face mask penalty followed by a dispute with an official. As he left the field, he gave the jeering crowd the finger. The penalties caused the ball to be placed at the Jets' 3-yard line, and Smith scored for Oakland one play later.|$|E
5|$|Being {{from the}} First and Second Divisions respectively, both Arsenal and Sheffield United were seeded <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>third</b> {{round of the}} FA Cup. In the third round itself, Arsenal was drawn away against Third Division South team Bristol Rovers. Arsenal missed a penalty, and the third Division team went a goal {{up in the first}} half; Arsenal were playing so poorly that it seemed they would {{struggle}} even for a draw. The turnaround in the match occurred when Cliff Bastin took over from Bobby Davidson at the inside left position. Arsenal equalized in the 65th minute, and scored further four times {{over the course of the}} following fourteen minutes to win the game by five goals to one, with a single goal from Bowden and two each from Drake and Bastin.|$|E
