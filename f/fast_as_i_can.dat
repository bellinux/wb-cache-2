500|$|Tarwater {{entered the}} June 2012 U.S. Olympic Trials {{with a new}} perspective: [...] "I want to swim as <b>fast</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>can,</b> be the best man I can be, and let the chips fall where they may", he said. [...] "If I make the team ... that would be unbelievable. If I don’t make this team, I plan to still be a champion." [...] He entered the {{competition}} ranked fourth in the 100-meter butterfly, fifth in the 200-meter butterfly, and also qualified in the 100-meter and 200-meter freestyle. He chose to scratch the 100-meter freestyle {{to concentrate on the}} 200-meter butterfly and freestyle. [...] Tarwater made the 200-meter freestyle finals; the top six finishers qualified for the Olympic 4×200 relay team, but Tarwater finished seventh. [...] He missed making the Olympic team by fourteen one-hundredths (0.14) of a second.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the fall}} of 1966 however, {{multiple}} sources began to report progress was being made against the North Vietnamese logistics and infrastructure; Johnson was urged from every corner to begin peace discussions. There was no shortage of peace initiatives; nevertheless, among protesters, English philosopher Bertrand Russell attacked Johnson's policy as [...] "a barbaric aggressive war of conquest" [...] and in June he initiated the International War Crimes Tribunal {{as a means to}} condemn the American effort. The gap with Hanoi was an unbridgeable demand on both sides for a unilateral end to bombing and withdrawal of forces. In August, Johnson appointed Averell Harriman [...] "Ambassador for Peace" [...] to promote negotiations. Westmoreland and McNamara then recommended a concerted program to promote pacification; Johnson formally placed this effort under military control in October. Also in October 1966, to reassure and promote his war effort, Johnson initiated a meeting with allies in Manila—the South Vietnamese, Thais, South Koreans, Filipinos, Australians and New Zealanders. The conference ended with pronouncements to stand fast against communist aggression and to promote ideals of democracy and development in Vietnam and across Asia. For Johnson it was a fleeting public relations success—confirmed by a 63 percent Vietnam approval rating in November. Nevertheless, in December Johnson's Vietnam approval rating was again back down in the 40s; LBJ had become anxious to justify war casualties, and talked of the need for decisive victory, despite the unpopularity of the cause. In a discussion about the war with former President Dwight Eisenhower on October 3, 1966, Johnson said he was [...] "trying to win it just as <b>fast</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> in every way that I know how" [...] and later stated that he needed [...] "all the help I can get." ...|$|E

5000|$|In an {{interview}} with Rolling Stone, Lloyd said about the song [...] "I think {{when we first started}} writing 'Activated' - in the very beginning stages - I had said that I wanted a song reflecting exactly how I feel. It's this feeling that I have of just wanting to run <b>as</b> <b>fast</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> possibly <b>can</b> and just move. I wasn't going to just record something and release shit for the sake of having a song out, I wanted to feel something when I heard it, and I wanted to feel like I did when I first started, like when I used to sing in my bedroom when I was 15." ...|$|R

40|$|What metamorphoses I see old age pro-ducing {{every day}} in many of my ac-quaintances! It is a {{powerful}} malady, and it creeps up on us naturally and imperceptibly.

6000|$|... "Now, {{you must}} suppose," [...] {{continued}} Robin, [...] "that a needle, like the mariner's compass needle, hangs beside my bit of iron, close to it, {{and that a}} wire, or conductor of electricity, connects the iron with my electric battery in Ireland. Well, that makes a magnet of it, and the suspended needle, being attracted, sticks to it. Then I disconnect the wire from my battery by touching a handle, the bit of iron ceases to be a magnet, and the needle was free. Again I connect the battery, and the needle flies to the remagnetised bit of iron. Thus, <b>as</b> <b>fast</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> choose, <b>I</b> <b>can</b> make the needle wag, and by a simple arrangement {{we can make it}} wag right or left, so many beats right or left, or alternately, representing letters. By varying the beats we vary the letters, and thus spell out our messages. Now, do you understand it?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] {{said the}} Captain, [...] "but it's the proper thing; and yachts, you know, {{generally}} cruise around in warmish weather.

We've just cast the log, and she's doing better than fourteen knots an hour, and we haven't got full steam on, either! It seems funny, madam, for me to command a steamer, but I'll {{get used to it}} in no time. If it was a sailing-vessel, it wouldn't be anything out of the way, because I've studied navigation, and I know more about a ship than many a skipper, but a steam yacht is different! However, I've got men under me who know how to do what I order them to do, and if necessary they're ready to tell me what I ought to order!" ...|$|R

6000|$|... 7. I {{was this}} morning early with Mr. Lewis of the Secretary's office, {{and saw a}} letter Mr. Harley had sent to him, {{desiring}} to be reconciled; but I was deaf to all entreaties, and have desired Lewis to go to him, {{and let him know}} I expect further satisfaction. If we let these great Ministers pretend too much, there will be no governing them. He promises to make me easy, if I will but come and see him; but I won't, and he shall do it by message, or I will cast him off. I'll tell you the cause of our quarrel when I see you, and refer it to yourselves. In that he did something, which he intended for a favour; and I have taken it quite otherwise, disliking both the thing and the manner, and it has heartily vexed me, and all I have said is truth, though it looks like jest; and I absolutely refused to submit to his intended favour, and expect further satisfaction. Mr. Ford and I dined with Mr. Lewis. We have a monstrous deal of snow, and it has cost me two shillings to-day in chair and coach, and walked till I was dirty besides. I know not what it is now to read or write after I am in bed. The last thing I do up is to write something to our MD, and then get into bed, and put out my candle, and so go sleep <b>as</b> <b>fast</b> <b>as</b> ever <b>I</b> <b>can.</b> But in the mornings I do write sometimes in bed, as you know.|$|R
60|$|Yet {{he would}} be a bold man who would {{administer}} emetics to the Giantess. She is flat-lipped, having no mouth, she looks like a pool, fifty feet long and thirty wide, and there is no ornamentation about her. At irregular intervals she speaks, and sends up a column of water over two hundred feet high to begin with; then she is angry for a day and a half--sometimes for two days. Owing to her peculiarity of going mad in the night not many people have seen the Giantess at her finest; but the clamour of her unrest, men say, shakes the wooden hotel, and echoes like thunder among the hills. When I saw her trouble was brewing. The pool bubbled seriously, and at five-minute intervals, sank a foot or two, then rose, washed over the rim, and huge steam bubbles broke on the top. Just before an eruption the water entirely disappears from view. Whenever you see the water die down in a geyser-mouth get away <b>as</b> <b>fast</b> <b>as</b> you <b>can.</b> <b>I</b> saw a tiny little geyser suck in its breath in this way, and instinct made me retire while it hooted after me.|$|R
6000|$|... "Now," [...] {{said the}} captain, [...] "I {{think that there}} is a chance of escape yet. Get on board, lads, <b>as</b> <b>fast</b> <b>as</b> you <b>can.</b> <b>I</b> fear the ship won't float long." [...] All the men now hastened on board. The captain's wife, who was the only female in the ship, was the first to step on the raft, and it soon began to be crowded. When about half of the sailors had left the ship the captain {{suddenly}} cried out, [...] "Ho! Ben Block, we've forgot a mast and sail. Run below with a couple of hands and fetch one <b>as</b> <b>fast</b> <b>as</b> you can." [...] Just at that moment the ship gave a heavy plunge, the ropes broke, and the raft floated slowly away, leaving the men who were yet in the ship in a state of despair. One or two of them jumped into the sea and tried to swim to the raft; but the first man who did so was nearly drowned, and the others got back to the ship with great difficulty. It was a terrible sight to witness the misery of the poor captain, as he beheld his wife, standing with her arms stretched out towards him, and the raft drifting slowly away, until at length it appeared like a small black spot far off upon the sea.|$|R
