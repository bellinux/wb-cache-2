40|$|The use of mixed-oxide (MOX) fuel in {{commercial}} nuclear power reactors operated in Europe has expanded rapidly {{over the past}} decade. The predicted characteristics of MOX fuel such as the nuclide inventories, thermal power from decay heat, and radiation sources are required for design and safety evaluations, and can provide valuable information for non-destructive safeguards verification activities. This report describes the development of computational methods and cross-section libraries suitable {{for the analysis of}} irradiated MOX fuel with the widely-used and recognized ORIGEN-ARP isotope generation and depletion code of the SCALE (Standardized Computer Analyses for Licensing Evaluation) code system. The MOX libraries are designed to be used with the Automatic Rapid Processing (ARP) module of SCALE that interpolates appropriate values of the cross sections from a database of parameterized cross-section libraries to create a problem-dependent library for the burnup analysis. The methods in ORIGEN-ARP, originally designed for uranium-based fuels only, have been significantly upgraded to handle the larger number of interpolation parameters associated with MOX fuels. The new methods have been incorporated in {{a new version of the}} ARP code that can generate libraries for low-enriched uranium (LEU) and MOX fuel types. The MOX data libraries and interpolation algorithms in ORIGEN-ARP have been verified using a database of declared isotopic concentrations for 1042 European MOX fuel assemblies. The methods and data are validated using a numerical MOX <b>fuel</b> <b>benchmark</b> established by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) Working Group on burnup credit and nuclide assay measurements for irradiated MOX fuel performed as part of the Belgonucleaire ARIANE International Program...|$|E
40|$|The {{requirements}} of ANSI/ANS- 8. 1 specify that calculational methods for away-from-reactor criticality safety analyses be validated against experimental measurements. If credit {{is to be}} taken for the reduced reactivity of burned or spent fuel relative to its original ''fresh'' composition, {{it is necessary to}} benchmark computational methods used in determining such reactivity worth against spent fuel reactivity measurements. This report summarizes a portion of the ongoing effort to benchmark away-from-reactor criticality analysis methods using relevant and well-documented critical configurations from commercial pressurized water reactors. The analysis methodology utilized for all calculations in this report is based on the modules and data associated with the SCALE- 4 code system. Isotopic densities for spent fuel assemblies in the core were calculated using the SCALE- 4 SAS 2 H analytical sequence. The sources of data and the procedures for deriving SAS 2 H input parameters are described in detail. The SNIKR code family was used to extract the necessary isotopic densities from SAS 2 H results and to provide the data in the format required for SCALE criticality analysis modules. The CSASN analytical sequence in SCALE- 4 was used to perform resonance processing of cross sections. The KENO V. a module of SCALE- 4 was used to calculate the effective multiplication factor (k{sub eff}) for the critical configuration. The SCALE- 4 27 -group burnup library containing ENDF/B-IV (actinides) and ENDF/B-V (fission products) data was used for all calculations. This volume of the report documents a reactor critical calculation for GPU Nuclear Corporation's Three Mile Island Unit 1 (TMI- 1) during hot, zero-power startup testing for the beginning of cycle 5. This unit and cycle were selected because of their relevance in spent <b>fuel</b> <b>benchmark</b> applications: (1) cycle 5 startup occurred after an especially long downtime of 6. 6 years; and (2) the core consisted primarily (75 %) of burned fuel, with all fresh fuel loaded on the core outer periphery. A k{sub eff} value of 0. 9978 {+-} 0. 0004 was obtained using two million neutron histories in the KENO V. a model. This result is close to the known critical k{sub eff} of 1. 0 for the actual core and is consistent with other mixed-oxide criticality benchmarks. Thus this method is shown to be valid for spent fuel applications in burnup credit analyses...|$|E

40|$|The University of Sheffield’s Low Carbon Combustion Centre (LCCC) is an allied {{partner in}} the National Jet Fuels Combustion Program (NJFCP), which is a US multi-agency program led by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA). Alternative fuels offer the {{potential}} of immediate benefits for the energy crisis and environmental pollution. NJFCP aims to gain {{better understanding of the}} effect of alternative jet fuel on engine combustion. Moreover, increasing the AFR (burning leaner) is considered as an effective way to increase the thermodynamic efficiency of a gas turbine. However, it increases the instability of the combustion and the tendency of the flame to blow out. Hence, the performance of LBO (Lean blow off) possesses the major consideration for the candidate fuels evaluation. With the support of NJFCP and LCCC, this paper studies on the relationship between fuel properties and their performance on the soot formation and the chemiluminescence radicals emission (CH* and C 2 *) at LBO of the six alternative <b>fuels,</b> <b>benchmarked</b> against Jet A- 1.

We succeeded to achieve a good agreement with an overall trend of the experimental data with appropriate selection of a mode for real anode surface area, {{but there are still}} local inconsistencies between theoretical calculation and experimental observation. In addition, the results were validated and compared with two-dimensional results to identify possible uncertainty factors that had to be further considered in a computational electrorefining analysis.

This technique allows for a high resolution of issues while presenting the material in a form that is conducive to planning for organizations such as industry, regulatory bodies, universities, and government entities that desire to pursue the most promising projects. The current analyses resulted in three distinct research and development areas that are considered most important based on the results. The first and most important research and development area is associated with technologies that address the connection and interaction of fuel cells with the electric grid. This R & D area is followed in importance by the production, use, and availability of opportunity fuels in fuel cell systems. The third most important category concerned the development and infrastructure required for transportation related fuel cell systems. In each of these areas the fuel cell community identified demonstration and deployment projects as the most important types of projects to pursue since they tend to address multiple barriers in many different types of markets for fuel cell technology. Other high priority types of projects are those that addresses environmental and grid-related barriers.

The HTTR is a 30 MWt test reactor utilizing graphite moderation, helium coolant, and prismatic TRISO <b>fuel.</b> The <b>benchmark</b> was modeled using MCNP 5 with various neutron cross-section libraries. An uncertainty evaluation was performed by perturbing the benchmark model and comparing the resultant eigenvalues.

The release of additional HTTR data could effectively reduce the benchmark model uncertainties and bias.

40|$|Because of the {{accuracy}} {{and ease of}} implementation, Monte Carlo methodology is widely used in analysis of nuclear systems. The obtained estimate of the multiplication factor (keff) or flux distribution is statistical by its nature. In criticality simulation of a nuclear critical system, whose basis is the power iteration method, the guessed source distribution initially is generally away from the converged fundamental one. Therefore, {{it is necessary to}} ensure that the convergence is achieved before data are accumulated. Discarding a larger amount of initial histories could reduce the risk of contaminating the results by non-converged data but increases the computational expense. This issue is amplified for large loosely coupled nuclear systems with low convergence rate. Since keff is a generation-based global value, frequently no explicit criterion is applied to the diagnostic of keff directly. As an alternative, a flux-based entropy check available in MCNP 5 works well in many cases. However, when applied to a difficult storage <b>fuel</b> pool <b>benchmark</b> problem, it could not always detect the non-convergence of flux distribution. Preliminary evaluation indicates that it is due to collapsing local information into a single number. This thesis addresses this problem by two new developments. First, it aims to find a more reliable way to assess convergence by analyzing the local flux change. Second, it introduces an approach to simultaneously compute both the first and second eigenmodes. At the same time, by computing these eigenmodes, this approach could increase the convergence rate. Improvement in these two areas could {{have a significant impact on}} practicality of Monte Carlo criticality simulations. M. S.

The main goal of this work {{is to develop a}} comprehensive methodology for up-front strategic assessments of the best hybrid system for a given vehicle platform, and to explore the impact of vehicle driving schedules on the final decision. Several other objectives enabled achieving the main goal, including modeling, optimization of design and power management of several hydraulic hybrid systems developed for a 4 x 4 light truck. The parallel, series and power-split hybrid configurations are modeled and analyzed. The unique issues related to matching of components and interactions in the system with a high-power density of pump/motors and the energy storage (accumulator), but relatively low energy density of the storage and limited motor speed range are investigated. The design optimization is carried out to maximize the fuel economy while satisfying vehicle performance constraints. An Engine-in-the-Loop capability is developed for each of the hybrid architectures, integration issues are resolved and the EIL is subsequently used for validation of simulation predictions and studies of the impact of hybrid system configuration and control on diesel emissions. For the power management optimization, the deterministic dynamic programming technique provides the <b>fuel</b> economy <b>benchmark.</b> Stochastic dynamic programming technique is explored next, in order to develop an implementable sub-optimal supervisory control policy based on the vehicle power demand probability distribution sampled from various driving schedules.

40|$|Abstract Background This paper {{examines}} {{the cost and}} benefits, both financial and environmental, of two leading forms of solar power generation, grid-tied photovoltaic cells and Dish Stirling Systems, using conventional carbon-based <b>fuel</b> as a <b>benchmark.</b> Methods First we define how these solar technologies will be implemented and why. Then we delineate a model city and its characteristics, which {{will be used to}} test the two methods of solar-powered electric distribution. Then we set the constraining assumptions for each technology, which serve as parameters for our calculations. Finally, we calculate the present value of the total cost of conventional energy needed to power our model city and use this as a benchmark when analyzing both solar models’ benefits and costs. Results The preeminent form of distributed electricity generation, grid-tied photovoltaic cells under net-metering, allow individual homeowners a degree of electric self-sufficiency while often turning a profit. However, substantial subsidies are required to make the investment sensible. Meanwhile, large dish Stirling engine installations have a significantly higher potential rate of return, but face a number of pragmatic limitations. Conclusions This paper concludes that both technologies are a sensible investment for consumers, but given that the dish Stirling consumer receives 6. 37 dollars per watt while the home photovoltaic system consumer receives between 0. 9 and 1. 70 dollars per watt, the former appears to be a superior option. Despite the large investment, this paper deduces that it is far more feasible to get few strong investors to develop a solar farm of this magnitude, than to get 150, 000 households to install photovoltaic arrays in their roofs. Potential implications of the solar farm construction include an environmental impact given the size of land require for this endeavour. However, the positive aspects, which include a large CO 2 emission reduction aggregated over the lifespan of the farm, outweigh any minor concerns or potential externalities. </p...|$|R
40|$|International audienceActive layers {{elaborated}} {{from commercial}} carbon-supported platinum nanoparticles (10  wt% Pt/C, E-TEK) have been characterized from cyclic voltammetry using either the porous rotating disk electrode (RDE) or the ultramicroelectrode with cavity (UMEC) techniques. The electrochemical {{properties of the}} platinum-based active layers were compared for two classical <b>fuel</b> cell catalysts <b>benchmark</b> measurements: the platinum specific area determined from hydrogen adsorption/desorption or CO-stripping coulometry and the evaluation of kinetics parameters for oxygen reduction reaction. Whereas the porous RDE technique requires the prior preparation of an ink composed of a binder (Nafion ®) and non negligible amounts of active material (at least 10  mg Pt/C powder), the UMEC {{is compatible with the}} elaboration of Nafion ® -free active layers, only composed of very small amounts of Pt/C (a few nanograms). Both the UMEC and the porous RDE techniques require the correction from the oxygen diffusion in the active layer for high ORR overpotentials (E   E  >  0. 8  V vs. NHE) only the UMEC requires a correction from the oxygen diffusion in the active layer, easily calculated using the macro-homogeneous model. The so-corrected ORR kinetic current densities are compared with that determined from other techniques of the literature, among which the thin-film RDE. Last, the comparison between UMEC including or not Nafion ® and porous RDE showed the non-negligible effect of the presence of Nafion ® in carbon-supported active layers, inducing modification of the platinum nanoparticles electrocatalytic activity for both CO-stripping and ORR. Thanks to its great advantages (low amount of Pt/C used, absence of binder and facile control of the quantity of active material in the cavity, shorter time of experiment, higher reproducibility) the ultra-microelectrode with cavity is a promising method to characterize fuel cell electrocatalysts. It enables Pt/C catalysts easy specific area measurements and ORR kinetics parameters determination without using any additional binder. The benefit of UMECs has been validated for the characterisation of commercial fresh or used anode active layer materials, which could not be attempted accurately using the classical RDE technique because of their high Nafion ® loading...|$|R
40|$|In most countries, {{criticality}} analysis of LWR fuel stored in racks and casks has {{assumed that the}} fuel is fresh with the maximum allowable initial enrichment. This assumption {{has led to the}} design of widely spaced and/or highly poisoned storage and transport arrays. If credit is assumed for fuel burnup, initial enrichment limitations can be raised in existing systems, and more compact and economical arrays can be designed. Such reliance on the reduced reactivity of spent fuel for criticality control is referred to as burnup credit. The Burnup Credit Working Group, formed {{under the auspices of the}} Nuclear Energy Agency of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, has established a set of well-defined calculational benchmarks designed to study significant aspects of burnup credit computational methods. These benchmarks are intended to provide a means for the intercomparison of computer codes, methods, and data applied in spent <b>fuel</b> analysis. The <b>benchmarks</b> have been divided into multiple phases, each phase focusing on a particular feature of burnup credit analysis.

While the earlier HTR-F and HTR-F 1 projects aimed at re-mastering fuel fabrication technology, testing existing state-of-the-art HTR fuels at high burn-up and high temperature and understanding fuel behavior), the R&D conducted in RAPHAEL SP-FT focuses on understanding fuel behavior and determining the limits of state-of-the-art fuel {{as well as on}} potential further Fabrication processes will be developed for an alternative kernel composition (UCO), with a potential for decreasing the CO pressure built-up in the particle, and for an alternative coating layer (ZrC), which remains more stable at higher temperature than SiC, thus providing increased Post-irradiation examinations and heat-up tests performed on irradiated fuel will allow investigation of the behavior of state-of-the-art fuel in a VHTR’s normal and accidental conditions. Based on the fuel particle models established in FP 5, the fuel modeling capabilities will be improved: An irradiation will be performed in the HFR Petten for measuring the changes in coating material properties as a function of fluence and temperature, with samples coming from the new fabrication process. This will allow introduction of particle behavior models for coatings which are not only more accurate than those presently based on old data, but also more relevant to present materials. Fission-product release modeling and statistical methods will be developed to integrate the individual behavior of thousands of particles within <b>fuel</b> elements.

40|$|Sobering {{electricity}} {{supply and demand}} projections, coupled with the current volatility of energy prices, have underscored {{the seriousness of the}} challenges which lay ahead for the utility industry. This research addresses the impending global need for electricity through the development of advanced annular fuel designs with both internal and external cooling which can achieve higher power densities and hence, higher electricity output from the same basic reactor vessel and containment. Therefore the objectives of this project are to determine the optimal geometrical design parameters of an annular fuel assembly for both PWRs and BWRs for the purpose of achieving maximum power density. It is theorized that utility companies can utilize this design through either retrofitting of their existing reactor facilities or incorporation of the fuel design into new plant concepts. For the case of annular fuel for PWRs, a high performance uranium nitride fuel assembly concept capable of achieving a 50 % higher power density was successfully developed. It is shown that a 5 % enriched UN annular-fuel assembly can operate at 150 % power density for about 50 effective-full-power-days more than that of the nominal 17 xl 7 solid-fuel-pin assembly operating at 100 % power density. Furthermore, neutronic simulation times of this assembly was reduced from approximately 2 days per simulation for a Monte Carlo based analysis to approximately 2 minutes for a deterministic based simulation via the development of an appropriate correction factor for the CASMO- 4 neutron transport code. It was shown that a 25 % increase in U 238 number density for the un-poisoned pins and a 35 % increase for the 10 weight percent gadolinium nitride poisoned pins produced the optimal plutonium tracking and infinite multiplication factor simulation. (cont.) Finally, the 13 x 13 annular fuel assembly was shown to have a smaller reactivity swing over the fuel lifetime. Thus it was concluded that an annular uranium nitride assembly at 150 % power density can be designed for PWRs so as not to require enrichments above 5 % in order to reach the desirable cycle length of 18 months. For the case of annular fuel for BWRs, thermal hydraulic simulations were carried out for a 9 x 9 solid fuel reference assembly and three different annular assemblies with 5 x 5, 6 x 6 and 7 x 7 fuel pin geometries. Prior research had utilized the Hench-Gillis CPR correlation for all thermal hydraulic simulations and determined that as much as an 11 % uprate for 5 x 5 annular geometries and an 18 % uprate for 6 x 6 annular geometries might be achievable. However, since Hench-Gillis uses bundle average conditions for its calculations, it was theorized that this treatment was not appropriate for annular <b>fuel.</b> A <b>benchmarking</b> analysis against experimental critical power data for a 9 x 9 assembly confirmed this is a more appropriate heat balance correlation, the EPRI- 1 Reddy Fighetti, which was adopted in our simulation of the critical power using the subchannel analysis code VIPRE. Several different strategies were pursued in order to improve the minimum critical heat flux ratio of the three different annular fuel assemblies including optimization of the fuel pin dimensions, fuel pin gap, and orifice loss coefficients. However it was concluded that annular fuel is not a promising strategy for increasing the power density. This can be {{due to the fact that}} the CHFR margin gained from the increase in heat transfer surface area is being lost due to the need for increased flow velocity, which retards the CHF for BWR conditions. This is exacerbated by the inability for the coolant in the inner channels to mix with the surrounding subchannels. by Tyler Shawn Ellis. Thesis (S. M.)

40|$|Graduation date: 1994 Lattice bum-up {{calculations}} in thermal reactors {{are complicated}} by the necessity for use of transport theory to represent fuel rods, control rods, and burnable absorbers, by many time-dependent variables which {{must be considered in}} the analysis, and by geometric complexity which introduces time-dependent, spatial-spectral variations. Representation of lattice structure in a core is further complicated by fuel materials and loading patterns which can be non-symmetric, and by the type of material used as the moderator. The incore thermionic reactor system developed under the Advanced Thermionic Initiative (ATI) is an example of such a reactor. In this design, the fuel is highly enriched uranium dioxide and the moderating medium is zirconium hydride. The traditional bum-up and fuel depletion analysis codes {{have been found to be}} inadequate for these calculations, largely for the reasons mentioned above and because the neutron spectra assumed for the codes such as LEOPARD and ORIGEN do not even closely fit that for a small, thermal reactor using ZrH as moderator. A more sophisticated codes such as the transport lattice type code WIMS is suitable for the terrestrial commercial reactors. However it lacks some materials, such as ZrH, needed in special applications and it is not capable of performing calculations with highly enriched fuel. Thus a new method which could accurately calculate the neutron spectrum and the appropriate reaction rates within the Thermionic Fuel Elements (TFE) is needed to be developed. The method developed utilizes and interconnects the accuracy of the Monte Carlo Neutron/Photon (MCNP) method to calculate reaction rates for the important isotopes, and a time dependent depletion routine to calculate the temporal effects on isotope concentrations within the TFEs. This required the modification of the MCNP itself to perform the additional task of accomplishing burn-up calculations. The modified version called, MCNPBURN, evolved to be a general dual purpose code which can be used for standard calculations as well as for burn-up. The of burnable absorber Gadolinium which adds complications both in the physical model and the numerical analysis requires frequent spatial and spectral reevaluations as a function of burn-up. This difficulty is overcome by the application of MCNPBURN by assuming that the burnable poison is uniformly mixed in the <b>fuel.</b> MCNPBURN was <b>benchmarked</b> using a standard Pressurized Water Reactor fuel element against the LEOPARD and WIMS computer codes. The results from MCNPBURN show good agreement with LEOPARD and WIMS. The maximum difference between MCNPBURN and either of the two codes was approximately 9...|$|R
40|$|Until {{about the}} year 2030, current-day nuclear power plants (NPPs) will be {{replaced}} by so-called Gen-III or Gen-III+ units, which are mainly based on light water reactor technology. The principal new features are increased safety and improved economical effectiveness. However, these systems use the same fuel forms and are based on the same fuel cycle. Beyond 2030, the interest is likely to shift towards fourth generation NPPs, which offer the possibility of complete fuel cycle closure. Generation-IV reactor concepts include both thermal and fast systems, and involve a wide range of fuel forms and compositions. The present research has been focused on the development of a thermo-mechanical model for the innovative fuel design of the Generation-IV Gas-cooled Fast Reactor (GFR). The principal distinctive feature of the fuel is that the fuel pellets are arranged within plates which enclose an inner honeycomb structure. Apart from the geometry, the usage of new materials is foreseen. Thus, the fuel pellets are of mixed uranium-plutonium carbide, and the cladding is bulk or fiber-reinforced SiC. The setting up of an appropriate materials database was thus the very first task which had to be carried out in the current work. The main purpose of the currently developed model is to provide reliable data, in the context of transient analysis, for the calculation of the principal neutronic feedbacks in the GFR core, viz. the fuel temperature for the Doppler effect and the fuel plate deformation for the axial core expansion effect. None of the available fuel modeling codes is suitable for a realistic simulation of the GFR fuel, as the inner honeycomb structure cannot be explicitly taken into account. The development work has been carried out largely in the context of PSI‚s generic code system for fast reactor safety analysis, FAST. Thereby, it has mainly involved extension of the thermo-mechanical code FRED, developed originally for the modeling of traditional rodded fuel. Within the FAST system, FRED is coupled to the TRACE code for the thermal-hydraulic modeling, so that the present work has comprised not only the development of a 2 D FRED model for the plate-type GFR fuel, but also the implementation of corresponding changes in TRACE for ensuring appropriate information exchange between the two codes. The 2 D thermo-mechanical model has been developed with certain assumptions. Since no experimental data exist for this <b>fuel</b> type, <b>benchmarking</b> of the new simulation tool was carried out by building up a detailed 3 D model using the finite-elements code ANSYS. The 3 D model has, moreover, been employed for conducting certain supplementary studies to obtain an in-depth understanding of the thermal and mechanical behavior of the fuel. It was found how the complex, multi-dimensional, heat transfer in the plate-type fuel accounts for the discrepancies between results of 2 D and 1 D simulations. Furthermore, it was shown that, under certain conditions, the temperature field can be well predicted by the 1 D model with slight modifications of the solution algorithm. Other insights have been obtained from the detailed mechanical analysis. Thus, it has been shown that, during operation, cusping occurs at the pellet periphery which results in an unfavorable concentration of stresses both in pellet and cladding. Several alternative ways to optimize the fuel design and to avoid, or at least minimize, this effect have been proposed. As mentioned, the new fuel model is intended for usage in GFR transient analysis. In order to quantify the impact of the current model developments, a range of hypothetical accident events have been analyzed using the FAST code system, with and without usage of the new fuel model. It has been shown that the pure geometry effects on the temperatures are quite significant. However, for the specific honeycomb structure geometry considered, these are somewhat mitigated by the fuel and cladding expansion and the corresponding decrease of the axial fuel-cladding gas gaps. Accounting for the deformations thus, in this case, brings the 2 D model results closer to those of a 1 D treatment. The evolution of reactivity feedbacks and the reactor power were evaluated using a point-kinetics approximation and hence were driven by the average temperature change rate (dT/dt) rather than by the absolute temperature values. Correspondingly, the results from the two models are not drastically different. The more significant discrepancies have been obtained for the transients with similar magnitudes of the Doppler and axial core expansion effects (core overcooling, loss of heat sink). For the transient-overpower transient, which is mainly determined by the fuel temperature, very similar results are obtained for total reactivity and reactor power. In brief, the present research has resulted in a flexible and easy-to-use simulation tool for carrying out reliable transient analysis for the Generation IV GFR with its innovative plate-type fuel, the implemented methodology combining an explicit accounting of the fuel inner structure with acceptable computing time...|$|R
