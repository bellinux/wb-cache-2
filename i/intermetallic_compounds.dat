It is highly reactive, and quickly forms an oxide film in air. Plutonium reacts with hydrogen even at temperatures as low as 25–50°C; it also easily forms halides and <b>intermetallic</b> <b>compounds.</b> Hydrolysis reactions of plutonium ions of different oxidation states are quite diverse.

Boron can form <b>intermetallic</b> <b>compounds</b> and alloys with such metals {{of the composition}} MnB, if n > 2. Ferroboron (15% boron) is used to introduce boron into steel; nickel-boron alloys are ingredients in welding alloys and case hardening compositions for the engineering industry. Alloys of silicon with iron and with aluminium are widely used by the steel and automotive industries, respectively. Germanium forms many alloys, most importantly with the coinage metals.|$|E
5|$|Due to {{the large}} size of the Ca2+ ion, high {{coordination}} numbers are common, up to 24 in some <b>intermetallic</b> <b>compounds</b> such as CaZn13. Calcium is readily complexed by oxygen chelates such as EDTA and polyphosphates, which are useful in analytic chemistry and removing calcium ions from hard water. In the absence of steric hindrance, smaller group 2 cations tend to form stronger complexes, but when large polydentate macrocycles are involved the trend is reversed.|$|E

40|$|Corrosion current {{distributions}} of the friction welding joints between commercially pure titanium (Ti) and type 5083 aluminum alloy (A 5083) were measured in a 3. 5 % NaCl solution {{by using the}} scanning vibrating electrode technique. A 200 nm-thick <b>intermetallic</b> <b>compound</b> layer was formed at the welded interface at the friction time of 3. 0 s.

The friction welding joint with the <b>intermetallic</b> <b>compound</b> layer at the welded interface was less susceptible to galvanic corrosion, whereas pitting corrosion occurred in the friction welding joint having only the Mg concentrated area at the welded interface.

Some of these have ionic characteristics: taking the alloys with gold, the most electronegative of metals, as an example, NaAu and KAu are metallic, but RbAu and CsAu are semiconductors. NaK is an alloy of sodium and potassium that is very useful because it is liquid at room temperature, although precautions must be taken due to its extreme reactivity towards water and air. The eutectic mixture melts at −12.6°C. An alloy of 41% caesium, 47% sodium, and 12% potassium has the lowest known melting point of any metal or alloy, −78°C.|$|E
5|$|The <b>intermetallic</b> <b>compounds</b> of the {{alkali metals}} with the heavier group 13 {{elements}} (aluminium, gallium, indium, and thallium), such as NaTl, are poor conductors or semiconductors, unlike the normal alloys with the preceding elements, {{implying that the}} alkali metal involved has lost an electron to the Zintl anions involved. Nevertheless, while the elements in group 14 and beyond tend to form discrete anionic clusters, group 13 elements tend to form polymeric ions with the alkali metal cations located between the giant ionic lattice. For example, NaTl consists of a polymeric anion (—Tl−—)n with a covalent diamond cubic structure with Na+ ions located between the anionic lattice. The larger alkali metals cannot fit similarly into an anionic lattice and tend to force the heavier group 13 elements to form anionic clusters.|$|E

40|$|It is {{difficult}} to deposit dense <b>intermetallic</b> <b>compound</b> coatings by cold spraying directly using the compound feedstock powders due to their intrinsic low-temperature brittleness. A method to prepare <b>intermetallic</b> <b>compound</b> coatings in-situ employing cold spraying was developed using a metastable alloy powder assisted with post-heat treatment. In this study, a nanostructured Fe/Al alloy powder was pre-pared by ball-milling process. The cold-sprayed Fe/Al alloy coating was evolved in-situ to <b>intermetallic</b> <b>compound</b> coating through a post-heat treatment. The microstructural evolution of the Fe- 40 Al powder during mechanical alloying {{and the effect of}} the post-heat treatment on the microstructure of the cold-sprayed Fe(Al) coating were characterized by optical microscopy, scanning electron microscopy, trans-mission electron microscopy (TEM), and x-ray diffraction analysis. The results showed that the milled Fe- 40 Al powder exhibits lamellar microstructure. The microstructure of the as-sprayed Fe(Al) coating depends significantly on that of the as-milled powder. The heat-treatment temperature significantly influences the in-situ evolution of the <b>intermetallic</b> <b>compound.</b> The heat treatment at a temperature of 500 C results in the complete transformation of Fe(Al) solid solution to FeAl <b>intermetallic</b> <b>compound...</b>|$|R
40|$|Soldering {{plays the}} most {{important}} role for joining technology in electronic industry.

5|$|All the {{alkali metals}} react readily with {{phosphorus}} and arsenic to form phosphides and arsenides with the formula M3Pn (where M represents an alkali metal and Pn represents a pnictogen – phosphorus, arsenic, antimony, or bismuth). This {{is due to}} the greater size of the P3− and As3− ions, so that less lattice energy needs to be released for the salts to form. These are not the only phosphides and arsenides of the alkali metals: for example, potassium has nine different known phosphides, with formulae K3P, K4P3, K5P4, KP, K4P6, K3P7, K3P11, KP10.3, and KP15. While most metals form arsenides, only the alkali and alkaline earth metals form mostly ionic arsenides. The structure of Na3As is complex with unusually short Na–Na distances of 328–330 pm which are shorter than in sodium metal, and this indicates that even with these electropositive metals the bonding cannot be straightforwardly ionic. Other alkali metal arsenides not conforming to the formula M3As are known, such as LiAs, which has a metallic lustre and electrical conductivity indicating the presence of some metallic bonding. The antimonides are unstable and reactive as the Sb3− ion is a strong reducing agent; reaction of them with acids form the toxic and unstable gas stibine (SbH3). Indeed, they have some metallic properties, and the alkali metal antimonides of stoichiometry MSb involve antimony atoms bonded in a spiral Zintl structure. Bismuthides are not even wholly ionic; they are <b>intermetallic</b> <b>compounds</b> containing partially metallic and partially ionic bonds.|$|E

40|$|This work {{investigates the}} effects of {{molybdenum}} nanoparticles on the growth of interfacial <b>intermetallic</b> <b>compound</b> between Sn- 3. 8 Ag- 0. 7 Cu solder and copper substrate during multiple reflow. Molybdenum nanoparticles were mixed with Sn- 3. 8 Ag- 0. 7 Cu solder paste by manual mixing. Solder samples were reflowed on a copper substrate in a 250 degrees C reflow oven up to six times. The molybdenum content of the bulk solder was determined by inductive coupled plasma-optical emission spectrometry. It is found that upon the addition of molybdenum nanoparticles to Sn- 3. 8 Ag- 0. 7 Cu solder, the interfacial <b>intermetallic</b> <b>compound</b> thickness and scallop diameter decreases under all reflow conditions. Molybdenum nanoparticles {{do not appear to}} dissolve or react with the solder. They tend to adsorb preferentially at the interface between solder and the <b>intermetallic</b> <b>compound</b> scallops. It is suggested that molybdenum nanoparticles impart their influence on the interfacial <b>intermetallic</b> <b>compound</b> as discrete particles. The intact, discrete nanoparticles, by absorbing preferentially at the interface, hinder the diffusion flux of the substrate and thereby suppress the <b>intermetallic</b> <b>compound</b> growth.

25|$|Two {{processes}} {{play a role}} in {{a solder}} joint formation: interaction between the substrate and molten solder, and solid-state growth of <b>intermetallic</b> <b>compounds.</b> The base metal dissolves in the molten solder in an amount depending on its solubility in the solder. The active constituent of the solder reacts with the base metal with a rate dependent on the solubility of the active constituents in the base metal. The solid-state reactions are more complex – the formation of intermetallics can be inhibited by changing the composition of the base metal or the solder alloy, or by using a suitable barrier layer to inhibit diffusion of the metals.|$|E

500|$|As derived below, the {{electron}} density within the crystal and the diffraction patterns are related {{by a simple}} mathematical method, the Fourier transform, which allows the density to be calculated relatively easily from the patterns. However, this works only if the scattering is weak, i.e., if the scattered beams are much less intense than the incoming beam. Weakly scattered beams pass through {{the remainder of the}} crystal without undergoing a second scattering event. Such re-scattered waves are called [...] "secondary scattering" [...] and hinder the analysis. Any sufficiently thick crystal will produce secondary scattering, but since X-rays interact relatively weakly with {{the electron}}s, this is generally not a significant concern. By contrast, electron beams may produce strong secondary scattering even for relatively thin crystals (>100 nm). Since this thickness corresponds to the diameter of many viruses, a promising direction is the electron diffraction of isolated macromolecular assemblies, such as viral capsids and molecular machines, which may be carried out with a cryo-electron microscope. Moreover, the strong interaction of electrons with matter (about 1000 times stronger than for X-rays) allows determination of the atomic structure of extremely small volumes.
