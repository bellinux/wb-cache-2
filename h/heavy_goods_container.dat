40|$|This paper {{provides}} {{a comparison of}} the energy consumption and carbon emissions of rail and road vehicles for two routes. The scenarios considered are a high running speed container train, in locomotive hauled and electrical multiple unit (EMU) configuration, and a converted passenger EMU for pallets, as well as the corresponding road <b>heavy</b> <b>goods</b> vehicles. The <b>container</b> route is over the UK’s East Coast Main Line and the pallet route is from London to the border with Scotland. The well-to-wheel 2008 and projected 2035 energy figures and carbon emissions are determined. It is demonstrated that, despite higher running speeds, a modal shift to rail reduces carbon emissions. The higher speed results in a more flexible path allocation for freight trains, enabling more attractive and flexible offers to shippers, therefore encouraging modal shift. The particular advantage of rail in hauling large volumes of cargo is highlighted, particularly if locomotives are used for traction...|$|R

40|$|The SWOV Institute for Road Safety Research investigated: (a) the {{problems}} occurring on Dutch municipal roads that involve <b>heavy</b> <b>goods</b> vehicles; and (b) what measures {{can be taken}} to correct these problems. A survey was conducted among 24 municipalities to accomplish this study. According to the Regional Committees for Road Safety, twelve of these municipalities experienced (or are experiencing) problems with <b>heavy</b> <b>goods</b> vehicles. The remaining twelve municipalities were selected from the Statistics Netherlands' file of Dutch municipalities by means of a stratified sample. `Obvious' problems mentioned by the municipalities were: (1) <b>heavy</b> <b>goods</b> vehicles within, and travelling through, the town centre; (2) <b>heavy</b> <b>goods</b> vehicles on major roads inside built-up areas; and (3) inconveniences caused by these vehicles. It is described which measures have already been taken and which ones are being prepared. Only two measures were mentioned by {{more than half of the}} municipalities: (i) concentrating business within industrial sites; and (ii) instituting entry prohibitions for lorries. It is concluded that definitely more attention should be given to measures concerning <b>heavy</b> <b>goods</b> vehicles. The approach to problems involving these vehicles was based on the principles of the `sustainably safe' concept. Measures recommended for solving these problems were: realising major roads, and creating areas with low vehicle concentrations. (A...|$|R

Secondly, Executive strategies to decrease the <b>Goods</b> and <b>Containers</b> dwell time were formalized employing Delphi method. Thirdly, the strategies, formalized at thesecond stage, were prioritized by use of Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) and MAPPAC in terms of the practicability, implementation costs, time needed, and the efficacy in reducing <b>Goods</b> and <b>Containers</b> dwell time. The eventual results of the MAPPAC method indicate the priority of these strategies as following: using electronic systems, reducing the paperwork and parallel processes in cargo clearance, employing road and rail intermodal transport, round-the-clock customs operation, enhancing coordination and collaboration among organizations involved in the issuance of cargo clearance...|$|R
