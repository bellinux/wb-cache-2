5|$|Republican President Benjamin Harrison (1889–1893) attempted, in 1893, to annex Hawaii {{through a}} Senate treaty. When this failed, {{he was asked}} to {{consider}} the Tyler joint house precedent; he declined. Democratic President Grover Cleveland (1893–1897) did not pursue the annexation of Hawaii. When President William McKinley took office in 1897, he quickly revived expectations among territorial expansionists when he resubmitted legislation to acquire Hawaii. When the two-thirds Senate support was not forthcoming, committees <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>House</b> <b>and</b> <b>Senate</b> explicitly invoked the Tyler precedent for the joint house resolution, which was successfully applied to approve the annexation of Hawaii in July 1898.|$|E

5|$|C-SPAN {{continues}} to expand its coverage of government proceedings, {{with a history of}} requests to government officials for greater access, especially to the U.S. Supreme Court. In December 2009, Lamb wrote to leaders <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>House</b> <b>and</b> <b>Senate,</b> requesting that negotiations for health care reform be televised by C-SPAN. Committee meetings on health care were broadcast subsequently by C-SPAN and may be viewed on the C-SPAN website. In November 2010, Lamb wrote to incoming House Speaker John Boehner requesting changes to restrictions on cameras in the House. In particular, C-SPAN asked to add some of its own robotically operated cameras to the existing government-controlled cameras in the House chamber. In February 2011, Boehner denied the request. A previous request to Speaker Designate Nancy Pelosi in 2006, to add C-SPAN's cameras in the House chamber to record floor proceedings, was also denied. Although C-SPAN uses the congressional chamber feed cables, the cameras are owned and controlled by each respective body of Congress. Requests by C-SPAN for camera access to non-government events such as the annual dinner by the Gridiron Club have also been denied.|$|E

Both Republican majorities <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>House</b> <b>and</b> <b>Senate</b> were held until the Democrats regained {{control in the}} mid-term elections of 2006. The Republican Party has since been defined by social conservatism, a preemptive war foreign policy intended to defeat terrorism and promote global democracy, a more powerful executive branch, supply side economics, support for gun ownership, and deregulation.|$|E

Reid said J. Edgar Hoover's name on the FBI building is a stain on the building. The Senate did not adopt the amendment.|$|E

25|$|The United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA or {{sometimes}} U.S. EPA) is an {{agency of the}} federal government of the United States which was created for the purpose of protecting {{human health and the environment}} by writing and enforcing regulations based on laws passed by Congress. President Richard Nixon proposed the establishment of EPA and it began operation on December 2, 1970, after Nixon signed an executive order. The order establishing the EPA was ratified by committee hearings <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>House</b> <b>and</b> <b>Senate.</b> The agency is led by its Administrator, who is appointed by the President and approved by Congress. The current Administrator is Scott Pruitt. The EPA is not a Cabinet department, but the Administrator is normally given cabinet rank.|$|E
25|$|The Federalist {{states in}} the House of Representatives decided to give their votes to Aaron Burr for President when he and Jefferson tied in the Presidential {{election}} of 1800. Their aim was to prevent at any cost the influential and rich in new visions Jefferson from becoming President. With help from Alexander Hamilton, the gridlock was finally broken on the thirty-sixth vote and Jefferson was elected President on February 17, 1801. The events in the House, combined with the increasing Democratic-Republican majorities <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>House</b> <b>and</b> <b>Senate,</b> prompted the Democratic-Republicans {{to call for a}} Constitutional amendment requiring separate votes for President and Vice President in the Electoral College. By doing this, the Democratic-Republicans could dash the Federalists' hopes of having any impact on the Presidential election of 1804.|$|E
25|$|In the 1980s and 1990s {{many people}} moved in {{from out of}} state. Much of this {{immigration}} included the arrival of more liberal political influences of the urban areas of New York {{and the rest of}} New England in Vermont. The brand of Republicanism in Vermont has historically been a moderate one, and combined with the newcomers from out of state, this made Vermont friendlier to Democrats as the national GOP moved to the right. As evidence of this, in 1990 Bernie Sanders, a self-described democratic socialist, was elected to Vermont's lone seat in the House as an independent. Sanders became the state's junior Senator in 2007. However, for his entire career <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>House</b> <b>and</b> <b>Senate,</b> Sanders has caucused with the Democrats and is counted as a Democrat for the purposes of committee assignments and voting for party leadership.|$|E
