40|$|ABSTRACT: Using linear elastic {{fracture}} analysis, {{the energy}} consumed {{per unit length}} of fracture (fracture energy) varies with the crack length, as described by the resistance curve (R-curve). This concept, originally proposed for metals, is developed here into a practical, applicable <b>form</b> <b>for</b> <b>concrete.</b> The energy release rate is determined by an approximate linear elastic fracture analysis based on a certain equivalent crack length, which differs from the actual crack length, and is solved as part of structural analysis. It is shown that such an analysis, coupled with the R-curve concept, allows achieving satisfactory fits of the pres-ently existing fracture data obtained with three-point and four-point bent spec-imens. Without the R-curve, {{the use of an}} equivalent crack length in linear analysis is not sufficient to achieve a satisfactory agreement with these data. The existing data can be described equally well with various formulas for the R-curve, and the material parameters in the formula can vary over a relatively broad range without impairing the representation of test data. Only the overall slope of the R-curve, the initial value, and the fina 1 value,are important. A parabola seems to be the most convenient shape of R-curve because the failure load may then be solved from a quadratic equation. For the general case, a simple algorithm to calculate the failure load is given. Deviations from test data are analyzed statistically, and an approximate relationship of the length param-eter of the R-curve to the maximum aggregate size is found...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. A {{convenient}} {{technique for}} calculating completed topological tensor products of functional Fréchet and DF spaces is developed. The general construction {{is applied to}} proving kernel theorems for a wide class of spaces of smooth and entire analytic functions. Let X and Y be sets and F, G, and H be locally convex spaces consisting of functions defined on X, Y, and X × Y respectively. If the function (x, y) → f(x) g(y) belongs to H for any f ∈ F and g ∈ G, then F ⊗ G is identified with a linear subspace of H. In applications, it is often important {{to find out whether}} H can be interpreted as the completion of F ⊗G with respect to some natural tensor product topology. Results of this type (or rather their reformulations in terms of bilinear <b>forms)</b> <b>for</b> <b>concrete</b> functional spaces are known as kernel theorems. For example, Schwartz’s kernel theorem for tempered distributions amounts to the statement that the space S(R k 1 +k 2) of rapidly decreasing smooth functions on R k 1 +k 2 is identical to the completion S(R k 1) ̂⊗πS(R k 2) of S(R k 1) ⊗ S(R k 2) with respect to the projective 1 topology.

The column consists of an outertube made of fiber-reinforced polymer (FRP) and an inner tube made of steel, with the space between filled with concrete. In this new form of hybrid columns, the three constituent materials are optimally combined to achieve several advantages not available with existing columns. This paper provides a summary of existing research on this new form of structural members, clarifying its structural behavior under axial compression, bending, and combined axial compression and bending. Test results of hybrid DSTCs are presented that demonstrate that they are very ductile under different loading conditions. A finite element (FE) model for its axial compressive behavior is also presented, which was employed in a parametric study leading to a simple stress-strain model <b>for</b> the confined <b>concrete</b> in hybrid DSTCs described in the paper. In addition, a conventional section analysis based on the plane section assumption and the fiber element approach is presented for predicting the behavior of hybrid DSTCs subjected to bending and eccentric compression.

50|$|For the 1929 season, the Allied Architects {{built the}} shell that stood until 2003, using a transite skin over a metal frame. Its acoustics, though {{not nearly as}} good {{as those of the}} Lloyd Wright shells, were deemed {{satisfactory}} at first, and its clean lines and white, almost-semicircular arches were copied for music shells elsewhere.
