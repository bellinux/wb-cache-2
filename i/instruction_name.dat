Future Intel processor releases will reportedly include a new <b>instruction</b> <b>named</b> PTWRITE to insert software-defined value into the trace to enhance debuggers (Strong et al. 2015). As PTWRITE is still unavailable on current processor releases yet (Hunter 2017), DTrace emulates PTWRITE by encoding the memory data load and store events with control transfer instructions and synthesizes the events from the trace.|$|R
50|$|In {{some cases}} it is {{possible}} to port existing VMX code directly. If the VMX code is highly generic (makes few assumptions about the execution environment) the translation can be relatively straightforward. The two processors specify a different binary code format, so recompilation is required at a minimum. Even where instructions exist with the same behaviors, {{they do not have the}} same <b>instruction</b> <b>names,</b> so this must be mapped as well. IBM provides compiler intrinsics which take care of this mapping transparently as part of the development toolkit.|$|R

The Nobel Foundation reached an agreement on guidelines for how the prizes should be awarded; and, in 1900, the Nobel Foundation's newly created statutes were promulgated by King Oscar II.

40|$|Abstract — In {{this modern}} era {{computers}} and smart devices {{are the major}} mode of communication, which connects {{different parts of the}} world within a fraction of seconds, As a result, people can easily exchange information, so that the distance is no longer a barrier for communication but safety and security may get compromised. This creates brutal issues while storing or transferring confidential data. By making use of Delta Steganography techniques, these security threats can be tackled to some extent and also eliminate unnecessary data being transmitted over network. This work introduces a combined form of steganography and delta compression algorithms. Steganography conveniently obscure confidential data inside a video file, delta compression analyze stego frames and reference frames then produce a set of <b>instructions</b> <b>named</b> as delta file. Storing or transferring delta file rather than video file can offer reduced space consumption as well as high security to the confidential data...|$|R

40|$|We {{propose a}} power-performance trade off {{methodology}} for microprocessors. An <b>instruction</b> <b>named</b> slowdown for low power (SLOP) is introduced. Functionally, it resembles the conventional NOP but requires power-specific hardware implementation. Depending upon the power reduction requirement, adequate number of SLOP’s are automatically {{inserted in the}} instruction stream by the power management hardware. While processing a SLOP, additional power control signals are generated for various units; the ALU is powered down, caches are put in drowsy mode, and register file and pipeline registers may be fully or partially clock-gated. Simulation of a fivestage pipelined 32 -bit MIPS processor shows that the SLOP method, termed instruction slowdown (ISD), becomes more effective than a conventional clock slowdown (CSD) when leakage is high. For 32 nm CMOS technology, ISD can save more than 70 % power compared to about 40 % by CSD. The paper shows that power reduction through a judicious choice of slowdown factor and the method adopted, clock slowdown for low leakage and instruction slowdown for high leakage, can enhance the battery lifetime as well. 1...|$|R

40|$|This work {{analyzes}} {{a typical}} battery powered digital electronic system and we propose a system level voltage scaling method and a functional power management method called instruction slowdown for low power. In the first part, we examine a circuit with voltage scaling capability and observe {{its impact on}} the energy efficiency of the battery. We study the system with a power source under throughput constraints and we propose a method to find a right size of battery to satisfy given system requirements. For systems with limit on battery weight or volume, we suggest a right circuit voltage operating point. We also notice that the performance evaluation metric such as battery discharge-delay or number of cycles per recharge are more relevant when power source optimization is a primary goal. In the later part of this work, an <b>instruction</b> <b>named</b> slowdown for low power (SLOP) is introduced. Functionally, it resembles the conventional NOP but requires power-specific hardware implementation. Depending upon the power reduction requirement, adequate number of SLOPs are automatically inserted in the instruction stream by the power management hardware.
