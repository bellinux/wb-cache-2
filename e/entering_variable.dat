40|$|The {{traditional}} perturbation (or lexicographic) {{methods for}} resolving degeneracy in linear programming impose decision rules that eliminate ties in the simplex ratio rule and, therefore, restrict {{the choice of}} exiting basic variables. Bland's combinatorial pivoting rule also restricts the choice of exiting variables. Using ideas from parametric linear programming, we develop anticycling pivoting rules that do not limit the choice of exiting variables beyond the simplex ratio rule. That is, any variable that ties for the ratio rule can leave the basis. A similar approach gives pivoting rules for the dual simplex method that do not restrict the choice of <b>entering</b> <b>variables...</b>|$|R
25|$|Since the <b>entering</b> <b>variable</b> will, in general, {{increase}} from 0 {{to a positive}} number, {{the value of the}} objective function will decrease if the derivative of the objective function with respect to this variable is negative.

25|$|The {{geometrical}} {{operation of}} {{moving from a}} basic feasible solution to an adjacent basic feasible solution is implemented as a pivot operation. First, a nonzero pivot element is selected in a nonbasic column. The row containing this element is multiplied by its reciprocal to change this element to 1, and then multiples of the row {{are added to the}} other rows to change the other entries in the column to 0. The result is that, if the pivot element is in row r, then the column becomes the r-th column of the identity matrix. The variable for this column is now a basic variable, replacing the variable which corresponded to the r-th column of the identity matrix before the operation. In effect, the variable corresponding to the pivot column enters the set of basic variables and is called the <b>entering</b> <b>variable,</b> and the variable being replaced leaves the set of basic variables and is called the leaving variable. The tableau is still in canonical form but with the set of basic variables changed by one element.|$|E

When the association was adjusted {{for the use of}} contraception and the partner's refusal to use contraception, the association was no longer significant, suggesting that the effect of partner violence on unintended pregnancy may be mediated by these variables.
