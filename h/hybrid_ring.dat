This thesis introduces four new uniplanar 3 -dB hybrid couplers using asymmetrical coplanar striplines (ACPS) for microwave integrated circuit (MIC) and monolithic microwave integrated circuit (MMIC) applications. The ACPS transmission line is characterized using Sonnet Software, and its characteristic impedance is graphed for a particular substrate. These graphs serve as building blocks for the design process. ACPS transmission lines eliminate the plating of the inner conducting ground plane and also lessen the number of bond wires as compared to coplanar waveguide (CPW) hybrid couplers.

ADS structure adopts the second substrate on which has lots of the metalized via-holes. The effective capacitance and effective dielectric constant per unit length of ADS increases compared to the normal substrate due to the via-holes.
