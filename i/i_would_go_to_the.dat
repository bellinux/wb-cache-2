500|$|When {{accessing}} the very deep emotions {{called for by}} her character, Mulligan stated, [...] "I really took my cue from the book". She noted that her role did not require her to have much to say, because Kathy {{was more of an}} observer throughout most of the film. She recalled that [...] "every time I was in a scene where I wasn’t quite sure where I was going with it, <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> book and read through the lines because she's unreliable, in that much of the time she's not being truly honest with herself or the audience." [...] The young actress said that her friendship with Knightley made their scenes together easier because they would both regard each other's comments helpful and would not feel [...] "insulted or hurt" [...] in discussion.|$|E
500|$|The two Dudley {{brothers}} {{were on the}} closest personal terms and Ambrose said of Robert: [...] "there is no man [...] knoweth his doings better than I myself", while Robert's recurrent phrase about Ambrose was: [...] "him I love as myself". Elizabeth, who liked Warwick, loved to joke that he was neither as graceful nor as handsome as his brotherand stouter as well. Lacking a grand London residence of his own, Warwick had his suite of rooms in the palatial Leicester House: [...] "the Lord of Warwick's bedchamber, the Lord of Warwick's closet, the Lord of Warwick's dining parlour". In the administration of their lands the brothers shared their estate managers and lawyers, while their local affinities consisted of the same gentry families. Privately, they were [...] "almost inseparable", passing time together whenever possible. When Robert Dudley had incurred the Queen's wrath while serving in the Netherlands as Governor-General in 1586, Ambrose wrote to him: [...] "if I were you ... <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> furthest part of Christendom rather than ever come into England again. ... Let me have your best advice {{what is best for}} me to do, for that I mean to take such part as you do." ...|$|E
2500|$|Leatherface was {{released}} in 1939. Mahjabeen's looks and talent brought more opportunities, ever since that ugly beginning against her wishes. At the age of four she became the bread earner in the Bux family. In an interview in 1962, Meena Kumari explained that the fact she had been supporting her parents {{from the age of}} four gave her immense satisfaction. Kumari further said [...] "The first day I trotted along to work, I little imagined that I was saying goodbye to the normal pleasantries of childhood. I thought <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> studio for a few days and then go to the school, learn a few things and play and make merry like other children, but that was not to be". Mahjabeen was admitted into a regular school, but that was not for long, because the demands of work frequently interrupted her curricula. She never went to school in any meaningful sense, and her education was the result of private tuition, and more significantly the result of individual interest; in every sense she was self-educated. Kumari concentrated most on Urdu although she could get by in English and Hindi. Little Mahjabeen used to carry her children's books onto the sets and even while travelling with her parents on outstation shoots. On the sets, little Mahjabeen was nicknamed [...] "Reading Mahjabeen".|$|E

6000|$|... "Well," [...] he replied, {{with sudden}} calm, [...] "that's {{the courage of}} the martyrs, {{and not all of}} them perhaps have been Christians, if history is to be credited. Yes, and in sober truth, I assure you, you, that <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> stake for--for Miss Bowater." ...|$|E
60|$|There {{were moments}} {{during the next}} few weeks when I listened to the voice of my good angel, when I saw clearly that even from the lowest point of view he was giving me sound advice. <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> man, tell him frankly the whole truth.|$|E
6000|$|... "I have no {{friend to}} take care of me," [...] she said simply. [...] "I was sad and sorry this evening, all by myself, and I thought <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Gardens and hear the music, just to amuse me. It is not much to pay at the gate; only a shilling." ...|$|E

60|$|In the meantime, however, I had no {{notion of}} being thwarted {{touching}} the information I desired.

6000|$|STEVE, with excusable heat, 'Not at all. But she {{is of the}} {{age when}} a woman knows her own mind--which makes the whole affair {{extraordinarily}} flattering.' With undoubtedly a shudder of disgust Amy closes the cupboard door. Steve continues to behave in the most gallant manner. 'You must not quiz me, Colonel, for her circumstances are such that her partiality for me puts her in a dangerous position, and <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> stake rather than give her away.' ...|$|E
60|$|The interpreters, {{agents of}} the Indian Department, or other whites {{accompanying}} the bands, in positions of responsibility, were always interesting to me; I had many talks with them. Occasionally <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> hotels where the bands were quarter'd, and spend {{an hour or two}} informally. Of course we could not have much conversation--though (through the interpreters) more of this than might be supposed --sometimes quite animated and significant. I had the good luck to be invariably receiv'd and treated by all of them in their most cordial manner.|$|E
60|$|It came in my {{thoughts}} one morning that <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> bank myself, where I had often been {{to receive the}} interest of some bills I had, which had interest payable on them, and where I had found a clerk, to whom I applied myself, very honest and just to me, and particularly so fair one time that when I had mistold my money, and taken less than my due, and was coming away, he set me to rights and gave me the rest, which he might have put into his own pocket.|$|E
