The ship was launched on 23 September 1911 and completed later that year. She was requisitioned for service by the Admiralty on 11 August 1914, and was commissioned on 1 September after she was modified to handle seaplanes by Chatham Dockyard. Three canvas hangars were installed, one forward and two aft, {{and there was no}} flight deck, the aircraft being lowered onto the sea for takeoff and recovered again from the sea after landing by newly installed derricks.

During her career with the RN, the ship operated Fairey Hamble Baby, Short Admiralty Type 74, Short Type 184, Sopwith Schneider and Baby floatplanes. Two or three quick-firing (QF) two-pounder guns also were fitted at this time.

50|$|The <b>Fast</b> <b>Packet</b> {{protocol}} {{defined in}} NMEA 2000 {{provides a means}} to stream up to 223 bytes of data, with the advantage that each frame retains the parameter group identity and priority. The first frame transmitted uses 2 bytes to identify sequential <b>Fast</b> <b>Packet</b> parameter groups and sequential frames within a single parameter group transmission. The first byte contains a sequence counter to distinguish consecutive transmission of the same parameter groups and a frame counter set to frame zero. The second byte in the first frame identifies the total size of the parameter group to follow. Successive frames use just single data byte for the sequence counter and the frame counter. Because many of the NMEA 2000 parameter groups exceed 8 bytes but do not require the 1,785-byte capacity of multi-packet, the default method of transmitting multi-frame parameter groups in NMEA 2000 is using the <b>Fast</b> <b>Packet</b> protocol.|$|E

The wavelet packet expansion exploits factorized nonseparable very fast filters, and is faster by a factor of 4 than a regular convolution and decimation of the image with separable one-dimensional filters. The selection of the best basis does not require any iterative procedure. This algorithm provides a very efficient implementation of the best basis algorithm. The wavelet packet coefficients are organized by increasing frequency into sequences of rapidly decreasing coefficients. The coefficients are quantized with uniform quantization, and bitplane encoded. The evaluation of the algorithm was performed on a large class of textured images.

40|$|Maximum {{throughput}} {{serves as}} a fundamental metric for evaluating the performance of mobile ad hoc networks. However, the actual maximum throughput still remains significantly unknown in such networks. This paper studies the actual maximum throughput of mobile ad hoc networks under a general routing scheme with reed-solomon coding, where a source node first encodes a group of g packets into w (w≥g) code blocks, and then these code blocks are transmitted to distinct relay nodes, which forward them to destination node. The original g packets can be decoded once the destination node receives any g code blocks. To explore the actual maximum throughput, we first establish two Markov chain models to capture the <b>fastest</b> <b>packet</b> sending and receiving processes at source and destination nodes under the considered routing scheme. Based on the Markov chain models, we then derive a closed-form expression for the maximum throughput in such networks. Finally, extensive simulations and theoretical results are presented to validate the accuracy of our theoretical maximum throughput analysis in mobile ad hoc networks and to illustrate how network parameters influence the maximum throughput performance...|$|R

40|$|The {{presence}} of slow space charge packets crossing the insulation thickness from one electrode {{to the other}} and causing significant electrical field distortion has been reported already in several papers. They are activated in general by very high dc fields or, in highly polluted materials, by relatively low fields and constitute an important ageing factor, concerning dc electrical stress. It has been observed, in fact, that such packets can cause accelerated breakdown of insulation. The development of fast systems for space charge measurements has allowed the {{presence of}} almost instant heterocharge to be observed close to electrodes in certain field and temperature conditions, especially in cable models. This has been explained often by the separation of ionic charge populations, even though such heterocharge appears also in materials, such as Polyethylene or crosslinked Polyethylene that represent the best extra-clean technologies. The measurements reported here use a high speed technique to investigate the build up of heterocharge in model cables that have been treated to remove volatile chemical species. They show that in fact the heterocharge is built up by many very small and very <b>fast</b> charge <b>packets</b> (i. e. charge packets having a high mobility), which are injected from both electrodes and cross the insulation in less than one second. Because the packet charge is unable to exit the counter-electrode at the same rate at which it arrives, hetero-charge is built up within just a few seconds {{from the beginning of the}} polarization. The mobility of these charges, depending significantly on temperature, is estimated through observation of charge packets as a function of time, and compared with that of the already-known slow packets, generally occurring at higher fields with respect to <b>fast</b> <b>packets.</b> The basis for the interpretation and modelling of such phenomena is discussed.
