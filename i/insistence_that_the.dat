5|$|In the 1950s Chen was {{appointed}} {{director for the}} upcoming film Li Shizhen. However, due to his <b>insistence</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> director, rather than government administrators, have artistic control, he was dismissed and the film was directed by his friend Shen Fu.|$|E
5|$|This episode, {{inspired}} by the 1982 horror film The Entity, was written due to <b>insistence</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> creators write more episodes where Mulder and Scully help people. This allowed the writers some space to create other episodes they had in mind.|$|E
5|$|This {{episode was}} created on Fox's <b>insistence</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> creators write more episodes where Mulder and Scully help people. This episode was written to {{accomplish}} that, {{and to allow}} the writers some space to create other episodes they had in mind. Co-writer Glen Morgan claims the episode {{was inspired by the}} movie The Entity. The name Tom Braidwood, the show's assistant director who later played Lone Gunmen member Melvin Frohike, is used in the scene where the parking lot attendant paints over the name of Howard Graves. The episode featured guest appearances by Barry Primus, Lisa Waltz, Lorena Gale and Veena Sood.|$|E
60|$|Many {{and many}} a time was Mamma's command laid upon Punch, and Papa {{would say the}} same thing with an <b>insistence</b> <b>that</b> awed <b>the</b> child.|$|R
50|$|McKinna {{was popular}} in the {{community}} for his <b>insistence</b> <b>that</b> all <b>the</b> players at the club engaged in community activities. This became a hallmark of his tenure at the fledgling club.|$|R

5|$|After the war Cockcroft {{became the}} {{director}} of the Atomic Energy Research Establishment (AERE) at Harwell, where the low-powered, graphite-moderated GLEEP became the first nuclear reactor to operate in western Europe when it was started on 15 August 1947. This was followed by BEPO in 1948. Harwell was involved {{in the design of the}} reactors and the chemical separation plant at Windscale. Under his direction it took part in frontier fusion research, including the ZETA program. His <b>insistence</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> chimney stacks of the Windscale reactors be fitted with filters was mocked as Cockcroft's Folly until the core of one of the reactors ignited and released radionuclides during the Windscale fire of 1957.|$|E
5|$|Mussolini sent a warship {{to shell}} the Greek island of Corfu, and Italian forces {{occupied}} the island on 31 August 1923. This contravened the League's covenant, so Greece {{appealed to the}} League {{to deal with the}} situation. The Allies agreed (at Mussolini's <b>insistence)</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Conference of Ambassadors should be responsible for resolving the dispute because it was the conference that had appointed General Tellini. The League Council examined the dispute, but then passed on their findings to the Conference of Ambassadors to make the final decision. The conference accepted most of the League's recommendations, forcing Greece to pay fifty million lire to Italy, even though those who committed the crime were never discovered. Italian forces then withdrew from Corfu.|$|E
5|$|On 6 June 1944, American, British and Canadian forces {{established}} a western front with the D-Day landings in Normandy. On 20 July 1944, Hitler narrowly survived a bomb attack. He ordered brutal reprisals, resulting in 7,000arrests and {{the execution of}} more than 4,900people. The failed Ardennes Offensive (16 December 1944– 25 January 1945) was the last major German campaign of the war as Soviet forces entered Germany on 27 January. Hitler's refusal to admit defeat and his repeated <b>insistence</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> war be fought to the last man led to unnecessary death and destruction in the closing months of the war. Through his Justice Minister Otto Georg Thierack, Hitler ordered that anyone who {{was not prepared to}} fight should be summarily court-martialed and thousands of people were put to death. In many areas, people looked for ways to surrender to the approaching Allies in spite of exhortations of local leaders to continue the struggle. Hitler also ordered the intentional destruction of transport, bridges, industries and other infrastructure—a scorched earth decree—but Armaments Minister Albert Speer was able to keep this order from being fully carried out.|$|E
25|$|On 14 August 2007, the Free Software Foundation {{staged a}} {{demonstration}} outside BBC Television Centre. The FSF's Peter T. Brown criticised the BBC {{for what he}} claimed was a break from previous tradition: <b>the</b> <b>insistence</b> <b>that,</b> for <b>the</b> first time, BBC viewers {{would be forced to}} use proprietary technology to watch BBC programmes.|$|R
60|$|There was a moment's silence. Her {{own face}} seemed paler {{than ever in}} the strange half light, {{but her eyes were}} wonderful. He told himself with passionate <b>insistence</b> <b>that</b> they were <b>the</b> eyes of a truthful woman.|$|R
50|$|Jared Ficklin - Ranch Hand, from Texas. (Episode 1-8) He {{was fired}} in Episode 8 due to Mr. Cooke <b>insistence</b> <b>that</b> he owned <b>the</b> horse <b>that</b> Jared bought {{previously}} that Mr. Cooke paid the Camanche for four horses.|$|R
5|$|Along {{with his}} {{colleague}} Wei Pu in the Bureau of Astronomy, Shen Kuo planned to plot out the exact coordinates of planetary and lunar movements by recording their astronomical observations {{three times a}} night for a continuum of five years. The Song astronomers of Shen's day still retained the lunar theory and coordinates of the earlier Yi Xing, which after 350 years had devolved {{into a state of}} considerable error. Shen criticized earlier Chinese astronomers for failing to describe celestial movement in spatial terms, yet he did not attempt to provide any reasoning for the motive power of the planets or other celestial movements. Shen and Wei began astronomical observations for the Moon and planets by plotting their locations three times a night for what should have been five successive years. The officials and astronomers at court were deeply opposed Wei and Shen's work, offended by their <b>insistence</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> coordinates of the renowned Yi Xing were inaccurate. They also slandered Wei Pu, out of resentment that a commoner had expertise exceeding theirs. When Wei and Shen made a public demonstration using the gnomon to prove the doubtful wrong, the other ministers reluctantly agreed to correct the lunar and solar errors. Despite this success, they eventually dismissed Wei and Shen's tables of planetary motions. Therefore, only the worst and most obvious planetary errors were corrected, and many inaccuracies remained.|$|E
5|$|Despite Lady Tichborne's <b>insistence</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Claimant was her son, {{the rest}} of the Tichbornes and their related {{families}} were almost unanimous in declaring him a fraud. They recognised Alfred Tichborne's infant son, Henry Alfred, as the 12th baronet. Lady Doughty, Sir Edward's widow, had initially accepted the evidence from Australia but changed her mind soon after the Claimant's arrival in England. Lady Tichborne's brother Henry Seymour denounced the Claimant as false when he found that the latter neither spoke nor understood French (Roger's first language as a child) and lacked any trace of a French accent. The Claimant was unable to identify several family members and complained about attempts to catch him out by presenting him with impostors. Vincent Gosford, a former Tichborne Park steward, was unimpressed by the Claimant, who, when asked to name the contents of a sealed package that Roger left with Gosford before his departure in 1853, said he could not remember. The family believed that the Claimant had acquired from Bogle and other sources information that enabled him to demonstrate some knowledge of the family's affairs, including, for example, the locations of certain pictures in Tichborne Park. Apart from Lady Tichborne, a distant cousin, Anthony John Wright Biddulph, was the only relation who accepted the Claimant as genuine; however, as long as Lady Tichborne was alive and maintaining her support, the Claimant's position remained strong.|$|E

5000|$|Costa Rica promised Friday {{to restore}} ties with Honduras if its presidential {{elections}} are clean, joining {{other nations in}} rejecting ousted President Manuel Zelaya's <b>insistence</b> <b>that</b> recognizing <b>the</b> vote would legitimize a June coup. [...] More than 50 members of the British parliament and others urged governments, including the Obama administration, to not recognise the elections on 29 November under the military coup regime.|$|R
50|$|He {{was born}} and raised in the Balvanera section of Buenos Aires, and at the age of 14, took up boxing at the Buenos Aires Gymnastics and Fencing Club; an injury, however, {{resulted}} in his mother's <b>insistence</b> <b>that</b> he abandon <b>the</b> pastime.|$|R
50|$|Despite <b>the</b> group's <b>insistence</b> <b>that</b> guitars were <b>the</b> {{wave of the}} future, {{the album}} failed to attract an American label and was {{released}} only in Canada and Japan, {{although there are many}} imports that have made their way to American, European and Australian shelves.|$|R
25|$|Due to the US Government's <b>insistence</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> CNN {{report was}} flawed, {{three or more}} of the {{individuals}} responsible were fired or forced to resign. Arnett was reprimanded, and eventually left the network.|$|E
25|$|Readick {{returned}} as The Shadow {{to host a}} final CBS mystery anthology that fall. The series disappeared from CBS airwaves on March 27, 1935, due to Street & Smith's <b>insistence</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> radio storyteller be completely replaced by the master crime-fighter described in Walter B. Gibson's ongoing pulps.|$|E
25|$|The Queen's House, {{though it}} was {{scarcely}} being used, provided the distant focal centre for Sir Christopher Wren's Greenwich Hospital, with a logic and grandeur that has seemed inevitable to architectural historians but in fact depended on Mary II's <b>insistence</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> vista to {{the water from the}} Queen's House not be impaired.|$|E
50|$|At {{a parody}} of one of Mozart's own operas, Emanuel Schikaneder (Simon Callow) asks Mozart to write an opera for his theater. Mozart, desperate for money, obliges, despite Constanze's <b>insistence</b> <b>that</b> he finish <b>the</b> Requiem Mass. The couple fight and Constanze leaves with their young son, Karl.|$|R
50|$|D’Espagnat {{remained}} {{troubled by}} the scant attention most physicists paid to the interpretational questions raised by quantum mechanics. His first book, Conceptions of Contemporary Physics (1965), asked these questions and sketched possible resolutions, underscoring his <b>insistence</b> <b>that</b> scientists face <b>the</b> issues raised by their own pursuits.|$|R
50|$|The 2000 {{documentary}} The Filth and the Fury, {{also directed}} by Julien Temple, retells {{the story of}} the Sex Pistols {{from the perspective of the}} band, thus serving as a response to and rebuttal of McLaren's <b>insistence</b> <b>that</b> he was <b>the</b> driving creative force of the band.|$|R
25|$|On 2 August 1985, Italy, West Germany and the UK {{agreed to}} go ahead with the Eurofighter. The {{announcement}} of this agreement confirmed that France had chosen not to proceed as a member of the project. One issue was French <b>insistence</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> aircraft be powered by the SNECMA M88, in development at the same time as the XG-40.|$|E
25|$|The name Cicadomorphidae {{was once}} {{proposed}} {{as a replacement}} for the name Palaeontinidae in 1956 by the Australian entomologist J.W. Evans. This was because of Handlirsch's earlier <b>insistence</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> type species Palaeontina oolitica may not have been Hemipteran. However, Evans later conceded that retaining the name Palaeontinidae was preferable as the drawings Handlirsch based his conclusions on were from badly preserved specimens.|$|E
25|$|He {{was also}} an avowed {{abolitionist}} whose attempts to abolish the slave trade {{was one of the}} most consistent elements of his foreign policy. His opposition to the slave trade created tensions with Southern American countries and the United States over his <b>insistence</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> British navy had the right to search the vessels of any country if they suspected the vessels were being used in the slave trade.|$|E
50|$|Most {{scholars}} assume <b>that</b> <b>the</b> disturbances {{mentioned by}} Suetonius {{in the passage}} were due {{to the spread of}} Christianity in Rome. These disturbances were likely caused by the objections of Jewish community to the continued preachings by Hellenistic Jews in Rome and their <b>insistence</b> <b>that</b> Jesus was <b>the</b> Messiah, resulting in tensions with the Jews in Rome.|$|R
2500|$|It is {{important}} now {{to notice the}} strategic point of difference between Künneth and Bultmann : Künneth is able to avoid objectifying apologetics and rationalizations without demythologizing. He is able to achieve much the same end by adopting something' like Barth's <b>insistence</b> <b>that</b> though <b>the</b> event of the resurrection truly occurred in our world, it [...] "transcends" [...] historical causality and thus is (fortunately or unfortunately) undetectable by the historian's methods. (from Robert M. Price, [...] "Risen Indeed?") ...|$|R
2500|$|Reviewers {{praised the}} script and score {{as well as the}} {{innovative}} design and the entire cast.

25|$|Rogers Media, {{who owns}} {{television}} {{rights to the}} Thursday Night Football package in Canada {{through the end of}} the 2016 season but has not yet acquired digital rights (the majority of the NFL's media rights in Canada are owned by Rogers's rival, Bell Media), successfully forced Twitter to block the game streams in that country, overriding the league's <b>insistence</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> free stream be global. Due to the streaming deal, over-the-top television providers PlayStation Vue and Sling TV are also required to black out the simulcast of the games on NFL Network.|$|E
25|$|The Times {{was first}} {{published}} on December 4, 1881, as the Los Angeles Daily Times {{under the direction of}} Nathan Cole Jr. and Thomas Gardiner. It was first printed at the Mirror printing plant, owned by Jesse Yarnell and T.J. Caystile. Unable to pay the printing bill, Cole and Gardiner turned the paper over to the Mirror Company. In the meantime, S. J. Mathes had joined the firm, and it was at his <b>insistence</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Times continued publication. In July 1882, Harrison Gray Otis moved from Santa Barbara to become the paper's editor. Otis made the Times a financial success.|$|E
25|$|On April 16, 2014, it was {{announced}} that Kohl had agreed to sell the franchise to New York hedge-fund investors Marc Lasry and Wesley Edens for a record $550 million. The deal included provisions for contributions of $100 million each from Kohl and the new ownership group, for a total of $200 million towards {{the construction of a new}} downtown arena. During sale discussions, it was revealed that Hansen and Ballmer had expressed interest in purchasing the team for more than $600 million but had not made a formal offer because of Kohl's <b>insistence</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> team stay in Milwaukee.|$|E
5000|$|John Lloyd {{wrote in}} The Observer, [...] "The guilty {{liberalism}} he excoriates, {{in a book}} that retains a force and a passion and an <b>insistence</b> <b>that</b> you examine <b>the</b> thoughts {{you think that you}} think through some 300 finely written pages, is not a definition of the contemporary left, but a barrier to its development." ...|$|R

500|$|Appearing {{before a}} public forum at the pier on 29 July, Secretary for Development Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor {{repeated}} <b>the</b> government's <b>insistence</b> <b>that</b> keeping <b>the</b> pier was not an option. She said she would [...] "not give the people false hope". Although Lam's performance in public debates was praised, the Secretary for Development's conflict of interest {{as the head of}} the Antiquities Authority was criticised. Lam said the AAB did not have governmental authority, and that it had not suggested keeping the pier in its totality.|$|R
