40|$|To {{increase}} the dose-intensity of two drugs in metastatic breast cancer, {{we tested the}} feasibility, in phase I studies, of two schedules of epirubicin (E) and cyclophosphamide (C) - sequential (E [...] > C) and alternating (E/C) - {{with respect to the}} standard combination (EC). Drugs were given at three planned-dose levels, plus either G-CSF or GM-CSF. Patients with metastatic (30), inoperable stage IIIb (2) or inflammatory (7) breast cancer were treated. The doses of EC, given every 21 days (4 cycles), were 75 / 1500, 82. 5 / 2250, 90 / 3000 mg/m 2. In the E/C schedule, epirubicin was given at cycles 1, 3 and 5, and cyclophosphamide at cycles 2, 4 and 6. In the E [...] > C schedule, three cycles of epirubicin then three cycles of cyclophosphamide were administered. In both <b>experimental</b> <b>schedules,</b> drugs were given every 14 days for 6 cycles at doses of 100, 110, 120 mg/m 2 (E) and 2000, 3000, 4000 mg/m 2 (C). The average relative dose-intensity was 1. 2 -fold and 2 -fold greater with E/C and E [...] > C, respectively, than with EC. The third level dose was feasible with all schedules. Grade 4 leucopenia occurred in 77 % of patients. Thrombocytopenia was absent in 6 cases and grade 4 in 12 (30. 8 %). Eighty-one percent of patients on <b>experimental</b> <b>schedules</b> required red blood cell support versus 44. 4 % of patients on EC. At the third level, platelet transfusions were more frequent among patients treated with EC (27. 8 %). Non-haematological toxicity was mild: about 20 % of patients experienced grade 3 vomiting, irrespective of schedule. Only 2 patients had grade 3 mucositis; no patient developed heart failure. Fever (61 % of patients) and bone pain (55. 5 % of patients) were relevant in the GM-CSF treated groups and 12 patients shifted to G-CSF. The overall response rate was 84. 6 %: 5 / 39 (12. 8 %) complete response and 28 / 39 (71. 8 %) partial response. At 30 / 9 / 98, median survival was 29. 5 months, with no difference between patients with metastatic and stage IIIb/inflammatory breast cancer. Median follow-up of surviving patients was 62 months (range 17 - 83). The 5 -year estimated survival was 19 % (95 % confidence intervals = 7 - 31 %). Rapidly alternating or sequential cycles of epirubicin and cyclophosphamide with CSF support is a feasible strategy that allows a higher increase of dose-intensity of the single drugs. Hospitalization and anemia were more frequent with the <b>experimental</b> <b>schedules,</b> and thrombocytopenia with the standard schedule. Overall, this intensified therapy was very active...|$|E

This study compares an experimental watchstanding schedule derived at Naval Submarine Medical Research Laboratory (NSMRL) with the schedule currently used onboard the submarine USS HENRY M.

This study reviews sleep and fatigue literature to emphasize important concepts needed to make schedule comparisons. Results from this study indicate a need exists among the U. S. submarine force to employ an operational schedule which provides more sleep and which is in better alignment with human circadian rhythms, thus improving cognitive effectiveness. One of the <b>experimental</b> <b>schedules</b> tested in this study yielded results {{similar to those of the}} existing submarine watchstanding schedule. This experimental schedule employed a validated model of human performance and fatigue to assess individual cognitive effectiveness. However, the results also indicate that the existing schedule is better suited in its accommodation of operational scheduling constraints which, in turn, allow watchstanders to receive more sleep. Recommendations address the need for the U. S. submarine force to continue to pursue a watchstanding schedule that provides better sleep while still accommodating operational constraints.

40|$|The {{benefits}} of using grain-oriented silicon steels in electrical applications relates to {{their capacity to}} enhance magnetic flux as a transformer core material. This {{is due to the}} presence of a preferred orientation, { 110 }, known as the Goss texture. Interestingly, during manufacturing, a selective growth process takes place exclusively for Goss oriented grains. This growth behaviour has been extensively studied, however, the growth mechanism of the Goss grains is not yet fully understood and warrants further study. This thesis aims to study the growth behaviour of a two-pass cold rolled grain-oriented silicon steel through three <b>experimental</b> <b>schedules</b> using high-resolution 2 D electron back scattered diffraction (EBSD) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The asreceived material was in the primary recrystallized condition. It was then subjected to: 1. a sequence of isothermal anneals, with variations in temperature (900 and 1000 C), holding time (5 to 300 minutes) and heating rate (rapid heating and 5 C/minute heating), 2. low strain cold rolling (~ 10 %), which was applied in two different directions, along the rolling direction (RD) and along the transverse direction (TD), followed by annealing at either 800 or 900 C for either 10 or 60 minutes, and 3. a sequence of cyclic anneals, performed at 900 C, with two different holding time regimes, short term (3 to 15 minutes) and medium term (15 to 30 minutes). Based on observations from prior studies, the effect of a number of structural features on the extent of Goss growth were investigated. This includes the presence of S 5 and S 9 boundaries, the Goss grain size advantage, Goss sharpness {{and the nature of the}} grain boundary sub-structure. These features did not appear to have a significant effect on determining which secondary grains will grow rapidly during annealing. The grain boundaries of the primary recrystallized structure, along with the effect of particle pinning mechanisms, appear to have a more pronounced effect on the growth of the secondary grains. Additionally, another pinning mechanism needs to exist to assist Goss grains to grow to an abnormal size. Several microstructural morphologies of necked grains were observed in some growing grains, which suggests that growth occurs through geometrical coalescence...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background The MITO- 2 (Multicentre Italian Trials in Ovarian cancer) {{study is}} a {{randomized}} phase III trial comparing carboplatin plus paclitaxel to carboplatin plus pegylated liposomal doxorubicin in first-line chemotherapy of patients with ovarian cancer. Due to the paucity of published phase I data on the 3 -weekly <b>experimental</b> <b>schedule</b> used, an early safety analysis was planned. Methods Patients with ovarian cancer (stage Ic-IV), aged 2, every 3 weeks or to carboplatin AUC 5 plus pegylated liposomal doxorubicin 30 mg/m 2, every 3 weeks. Treatment was planned for 6 cycles. Toxicity was coded according to the NCI-CTC version 2. 0. Results The pre-planned safety analysis was performed in July 2004. Data from the first 50 patients treated with carboplatin plus pegylated liposomal doxorubicin were evaluated. Median age was 60 years (range 34 – 75). Forty-three patients (86 %) completed 6 cycles. Two thirds of the patients {{had at least one}} cycle delayed due to toxicity, but 63 % of the cycles were administered on time. In most cases the reason for chemotherapy delay was neutropenia or other hematological toxicity. No delay due to palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia (PPE) was recorded. No toxic death was recorded. Reported hematological toxicities were: grade (G) 3 anemia 16 %, G 3 /G 4 neutropenia 36 % and 10 % respectively, G 3 / 4 thrombocytopenia 22 % and 4 % respectively. Non-haematological toxicity was infrequent: pulmonary G 1 6 %, heart rhythm G 1 4 %, liver toxicity G 1 6 %, G 2 4 % and G 3 2 %. Complete hair loss was reported in 6 % of patients, and G 1 neuropathy in 2 %. PPE was recorded in 14 % of the cases (G 1 10 %, G 2 2 %, G 3 2 %). Conclusion This safety analysis shows that the adopted schedule of carboplatin plus pegylated liposomal doxorubicin given every 3 weeks is feasible as first line treatment in ovarian cancer patients, although 37 % of the cycles were delayed due to haematological toxicity. Toxicities that are common with standard combination of carboplatin plus paclitaxel (neurotoxicity and hair loss) are infrequent with this <b>experimental</b> <b>schedule,</b> and skin toxicity appears manageable. </p...|$|R
40|$|Monomer {{diffusion}} {{plays an}} important role in the process of hologram formation in photopolymer materials. The gradient of monomer generated during the recording process origins a motion of the monomer molecules from the dark to the bright zones. The high physical thickness of photopolymers required to use them as holographic memories implies an additional gradient of monomer in depth. The exposure time needed to record a single hologram is very short; nevertheless if many holograms are multiplexed an exposure time around 100 s or more is required. For this long period the importance of monomer diffusion in depth must be studied. Other important factor in order to design an <b>experimental</b> <b>schedule</b> is the time needed between two consecutive holograms. In this work we analyze the importance of the monomer diffusion in depth in these cases using a three-dimensional diffusion model solved using a finite differences method.

Rectal tem-perature was constantly measured every 5 minutes during the experiment and saliva samples for melatonin and cortisol were collected twice per day before and after sleep.

In addition, melatonin was secreted more but cortisol was secreted less when the subjects wore the prototype clothing. With these results, we assumed that regular circadian rhythm and low level of stress might be caused by wearing prototype clothing that lowered clothing pressure.

40|$|Abstract. Solid {{particle}} erosion (SPE) wear {{characteristics of}} particulate filled polymer matrix composites {{have been widely}} explored by different investigators. Through judicious control of reinforcing solid particulate phase, selection of matrix and suitable processing technique, composites can be prepared to tailor the properties needed for any specific application. Due to high cost of conventional ceramic fillers, it has become important to explore the potential of cheap materials like mineral ores and industrial wastes for utilization in preparing particle-reinforced polymer composites. Previous researchers have reported the use of industrial wastes such as fly ash and red mud as filler materials in polymeric matrices. But the reinforcing potential of blast furnace slag (BFS) particle, a solid waste generated from pig iron production route, has not been explored so far in polymeric materials. In this work, composite samples are prepared by reinforcing micro-sized blast furnace slag as the particulate filler in epoxy resin reinforced with bi-directional glass fibre.

These findings suggest that the resistance to reinfection with C. sinen-sis should vary according to the host species. The pre-sent study was undertaken to investigate the resis-tance to reinfection with C. sinensis in various experi-mental animals including mice, guinea pigs, rabbits, and dogs, as well as rats and hamsters. Metacercariae of C. sinensis were isolated from the naturally infected freshwater fish, Pseudorasbora parva, collected in a pond of Jinju-si, Gyeongsangnam-do (Province), Korea. Experimental animals were all males and 5 -week old, except for rats (4 -week old). They were Sprague-Dawley rats, FVB mice, Syrian golden hamsters, guinea pigs, New Zealand white rabbits and dogs, and divided into 2 experimental groups; reinfection control, and reinfection groups. Animals in the reinfection groups were orally infected with metacercariae using a gavage needle according to the <b>experimental</b> <b>schedule</b> (Fig. 1), and treated with praziquantel (Distocide®, Shinpoong Pharmaceutical Co., Seoul, Korea) 4 weeks after the primary infection...|$|R

40|$|Cholinergic basal {{forebrain}} structures are implicated in cortical arousal and {{regulation of the}} sleep-wake cycle. Cholinergic neurones are innervated by noradrenergic terminals, noradrenaline excites them via alpha- 1 receptors and microinjection of noradrenaline into the {{basal forebrain}} enhances wakefulness. However, {{it is not known}} to what extent the cholinergic versus non-cholinergic basal forebrain projection neurones contribute to the arousing effects of noradrenaline. To elucidate the roles of cholinergic basal forebrain structures we administered methoxamine, an alpha- 1 -adrenergic agonist into the basal forebrain, in intact animals and again after selective destruction of the basal forebrain cholinergic cells by 192 IgG-saporin. In eight male Han-Wistar rats implanted with electroencephalogram/electromyogram electrodes, a microdialysis probe targeted into the basal forebrain was perfused with artificial cerebrospinal fluid for 6 h on a baseline day, and with cerebrospinal fluid in the first and with methoxamine in the second 3 -h period of the subsequent day. The sleep-wake activity was recorded for 24 h on both days. Saporin was then injected into the basal forebrain and 2 weeks later the same <b>experimental</b> <b>schedule</b> (with cerebrospinal fluid and methoxamine) was repeated. In the intact animals, methoxamine exhibited a robust arousing effect and non-rapid eye movement (NREM) and REM sleep was suppressed. Lesioning of the basal forebrain cholinergic neurones abolished almost completely the NREM sleep-suppressing effect of methoxamine, whereas the REM sleep-suppressing effect remained intact. Thus, the basal forebrain cholinergic neurones mediate, at least in part, cortical arousal and non-REM sleep-suppression, but they are not involved in the REM sleep-suppressing effects of noradrenaline...|$|R
