50|$|The systems marketed in North America as the 1A, 6A, 1A1 and the 1A2 <b>Key</b> <b>System</b> {{are typical}} {{examples}} and sold for many decades. The 1A family of Western Electric Company (WECo) key telephone units (KTUs) {{were introduced in}} the late 1930s and remained in use to the 1950s. 1A equipment was primitive and required at least two KTUs per line; one for line termination and one for station (telephone instrument) termination. The telephone instrument commonly used by 1A systems was the WECo 300-series telephone. Introduced in 1953, 1A1 <b>key</b> <b>systems</b> simplified wiring with a single KTU for both line and station termination, and increased the features available. As the 1A1 systems became commonplace, requirements for intercom features grew. The original intercom KTUs, WECo Model 207, were wired for a single talk link, that is, a single conversation on the intercom at a time. The WECo 6A dial intercom system provided two talk links and was often installed as the dial intercom in a 1A1 or 1A2 <b>key</b> <b>system.</b> The 6A systems were complex, troublesome and expensive, and never became popular. The advent of 1A2 technology in the 1964 simplified <b>key</b> <b>system</b> set up and maintenance.
