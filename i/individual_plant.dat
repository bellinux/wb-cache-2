5|$|The optimal defense {{hypothesis}} {{attempts to}} explain how the kinds of defenses a particular plant might use reflect the threats each <b>individual</b> <b>plant</b> faces. This model considers three main factors, namely: risk of attack, value of the plant part, and the cost of defense.|$|E
5|$|Unlike animals, many plant cells, {{particularly}} those of the parenchyma, do not terminally differentiate, remaining totipotent {{with the ability to}} give rise to a new <b>individual</b> <b>plant.</b> Exceptions include highly lignified cells, the sclerenchyma and xylem which are dead at maturity, and the phloem sieve tubes which lack nuclei. While plants use many of the same epigenetic mechanisms as animals, such as chromatin remodelling, an alternative hypothesis is that plants set their gene expression patterns using positional information from the environment and surrounding cells to determine their developmental fate.|$|E
5|$|Unlike animals, plants lack {{phagocytic}} cells, {{but many}} plant immune responses involve systemic chemical signals that are sent through a plant. <b>Individual</b> <b>plant</b> cells respond to molecules associated with pathogens known as Pathogen-associated molecular patterns or PAMPs. When {{a part of}} a plant becomes infected, the plant produces a localized hypersensitive response, whereby cells at the site of infection undergo rapid apoptosis {{to prevent the spread of}} the disease to other parts of the plant. Systemic acquired resistance (SAR) is a type of defensive response used by plants that renders the entire plant resistant to a particular infectious agent. RNA silencing mechanisms are particularly important in this systemic response as they can block virus replication.|$|E

25|$|Many trees, shrubs, vines, {{ferns and}} other {{herbaceous}} perennials form clonal colonies naturally. Parts of an <b>individual</b> <b>plant</b> may become detached by fragmentation and grow {{on to become}} separate clonal individuals. A common example is in the vegetative reproduction of moss and liverwort gametophyte clones by means of gemmae. Some vascular plants e.g. dandelion and certain viviparous grasses also form seeds asexually, termed apomixis, resulting in clonal populations of genetically identical individuals.|$|E
25|$|The plant's {{small size}} and rapid {{lifecycle}} are also advantageous for research. Having specialized as a spring ephemeral, {{it has been}} used to found several laboratory strains that take about six weeks from germination to mature seed. The small size of the plant is convenient for cultivation in a small space, and it produces many seeds. Further, the selfing nature of this plant assists genetic experiments. Also, as an <b>individual</b> <b>plant</b> can produce several thousand seeds; each of the above criteria leads to A. thaliana being valued as a genetic model organism.|$|E

25|$|The {{process of}} {{oviposition}} in gulf fritillaries {{begins with the}} female butterfly flying low and slightly above the vegetation (most likely the typical host plants like Passiflora incarnata or Passiflora lutea) and lasts until the female pauses above an <b>individual</b> <b>plant.</b> Then, the female makes contact with the host plant by landing; the female then deposits an egg to complete the process of oviposition. The driving factor behind what causes the female to oviposit {{on or near the}} host plant is most likely due to the certain chemical composition of the specific genus of the host plant. Once the female recognizes the chemical composition (by using the antennae), the female will oviposit.|$|E
25|$|Post-emergence, {{females have}} a pre-oviposition period {{of one to}} two days. Using their ovipositor, females lay single eggs within the plant tissue, and may lay an average of forty eggs during their lifetime. Females of S. dorsalis prefer to lay their eggs inside of young leaves and buds at the apical {{meristem}} of plants, but as populations increase, will lay their eggs within the surface of mature leaves. Depending on temperature, eggs may gestate for one to three weeks. After hatching, larvae will migrate from older leaves to the newer growth at terminals. Like many thrips, S. dorsalis appears to prefer feeding on new growth and young plants, and is often found on the newer top leaves on smaller plants, although <b>individual</b> <b>plant</b> morphology and chemistry may result in some distributional differences.|$|E
25|$|Conditions {{under which}} natural {{disturbances}} occur are influenced mainly by climate, weather, and location. Fire disturbances will only occur {{in areas where}} there is low precipitation, some form of ignition (typically lightning), and enough flammable biomass to allow fire to spread. Conditions often occur {{as part of a}} cycle and disturbances may be periodic. Other disturbances, such as those caused by humans, invasive species or impact events, can occur anywhere and are not necessarily cyclic. Extinction vortices may result in multiple disturbances or a greater frequency of a single disturbance. Immediately after a disturbance there is a pulse of recruitment or regrowth under conditions of little competition for space or other resources. After the initial pulse, recruitment slows since once an <b>individual</b> <b>plant</b> is established {{it is very difficult to}} displace. Due to the varying forms of disturbance this directly impacts the organisms which will exploit the disturbance and create diversity within an ecosystem.|$|E

40|$|Understanding {{plant growth}} and {{analyzing}} plant {{interaction with the}} environment is an important aspect in modern agronomy and biological sciences. While measurements are often taken at field scale, current research focuses increasingly on <b>individual</b> <b>plants.</b> As a manual determination of morphological plant parameters is very time-consuming, automatic acquisition methods at high throughput are required. Optical scanning methods provide fast acquisition of surface points. However, as plants represent geometrically complex objects, planning a proper measurement setup and evaluation of the acquired data is a challenging task. This paper addresses solutions for system desing and data processing for the sheet-of-light measurement method.

2500|$|Secondly, plant {{physiology}} includes {{the study of}} biological and chemical processes of <b>individual</b> <b>plant</b> cells.

[...] For example, plant cells have a cell wall which restricts the shape of plant cells and thereby limits the flexibility and mobility of plants. [...] Plant cells also contain chlorophyll, a chemical compound that interacts with light in a way that enables plants to manufacture their own nutrients rather than consuming other living things as animals do.|$|E

In other words, each <b>individual</b> <b>plant</b> provides the pollen which is required in the process of producing seed, to fertilise the female organs of its own flowers.

2500|$|Somatic {{epigenetic}} inheritance, particularly through DNA and histone covalent modifications and nucleosome repositioning, is {{very important}} in the development of multicellular eukaryotic organisms. The genome sequence is static (with some notable exceptions), but cells differentiate into many different types, which perform different functions, and respond differently to the environment and intercellular signalling. Thus, as individuals develop, morphogens activate or silence genes in an epigenetically heritable fashion, giving cells a memory. In mammals, most cells terminally differentiate, with only stem cells retaining the ability to differentiate into several cell types ("totipotency" [...] and [...] "multipotency"). In mammals, some stem cells continue producing new differentiated cells throughout life, such as in neurogenesis, but mammals are not able to respond to loss of some tissues, for example, the inability to regenerate limbs, which some other animals are capable of. Epigenetic modifications regulate the transition from neural stem cells to glial progenitor cells (for example, differentiation into oligodendrocytes is regulated by the deacetylation and methylation of histones. Unlike animals, plant cells do not terminally differentiate, remaining totipotent with the ability to give rise to a new <b>individual</b> <b>plant.</b> While plants do utilise many of the same epigenetic mechanisms as animals, such as chromatin remodeling, it has been hypothesised that some kinds of plant cells do not use or require [...] "cellular memories", resetting their gene expression patterns using positional information from the environment and surrounding cells to determine their fate.|$|E
