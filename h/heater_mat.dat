40|$|For all {{surgical}} interventions, combination anesthesia {{was used}} composed of 0. 05 mg/ml 10. 67 % fentanyl (Janssen-Cilag), 5 mg/ml 5. 33 % midazolam (Hoffmann-LaRoche AG), and 1 mg/ml 1. 33 % medetomidin (Pfizer) applied i. p. at {{a dose of}} 15 ml/kg. After surgery, anesthesia was antagonized {{by a combination of}} 0. 4 mg/ml 0. 67 % naloxone (Curamed Pharma), 5 mg/ml 1. 33 % atipamezole (Pfizer), and 0. 1 mg/ml 6. 67 % flumazenil (Hoffmann-La Roche) applied i. p. at a dose of 15 ml/kg. Postoperative analgesics were given as needed. Induction of myocardial infarction. Animals were anesthetized, fixed on a <b>heater</b> <b>mat,</b> and ventilated by a rodent respirator (type 845; Hugo Sachs Elektronik/Harvard Apparatus). After left thoracotomy in the fourth intercostal space and transsection of the pericardium, the left anterior descending coronary artery was ligated proximal to the first diagonal branch. The chest was closed, and standardized postsurgical analgesic treatment was applied. The perioperative mortality was not different between treatment groups (G-CSF/SCF 37 of 67 animals [55. 8 %], control 23 of 55 [41. 8 %]; P> 0. 2). Echocardiography and surface electrocardiogram (ECG) recordings. In brief, the heart was visualized in parasternal long and short axes and in apical four-chamber views using a 15 -MHz linear transducer and a 12 -MHz Doppler transducer (Agilent Technologies Sonos 5500; Philips). Before the echocardiographic examination, a 12 -lead ECG was recorded using published criteria on a digital ECG recording system (EMKA technologies; reference 1). Data were stored on digital media for offline analysis. Left ventricular function was measured as fractional shortening. To assess regional wall motion abnormalities, fractional shortening was determined in M mode recordings at different regions of the left ventricle; i. e., close to the papillary muscles, in the mid-third of the left ventricle, and at the apical left ventricle...|$|E
50|$|Many viscous liquids and solids {{stored in}} steel drums require {{considerable}} energy input prior to removing from the container for processing. It is sometimes beneficial to add heat {{directly to the}} underside of the drum, using a bast heater. These are available in various constructions, using induction heating, steam or silicone <b>heater</b> <b>mats</b> inside a body with sufficient mechanical strength to support the weight of a full drum.|$|R
25|$|Among 787 flight systems, a key {{change from}} {{traditional}} airliners is the electrical architecture. The architecture is bleedless and replaces bleed air and hydraulic power sources with electrically powered compressors and pumps, while completely eliminating pneumatics and hydraulics from some subsystems, e.g., engine starters or brakes. Boeing says this system extracts 35 percent less {{power from the}} engines, allowing increased thrust and improved fuel economy. The total available on-board electrical power is 1.45 megawatts, which is five times the power available on conventional pneumatic airliners; the most notable electrically powered systems include engine start, cabin pressurization, horizontal stabilizer trim, and wheel brakes. Wing ice protection is another new system; it uses electro-thermal <b>heater</b> <b>mats</b> on the wing slats instead of traditional hot bleed air. An active gust alleviation system, similar to the system used on the B-2 bomber, improves ride quality during turbulence.|$|R
40|$|The {{increasingly}} high {{capital investment}} required for large autoclaves, ovens and facilities for the processmg of large composite components creates {{a number of}} financial constraints for the development and manufacturing of larger composite aircraft products. This thesis has investigated the use of heated tooling {{as an alternative to}} the use of autoclave and oven curing. A design and development methodology for heated tools has been proposed while a number of heated tooling options have been identified and described. Three representative heated tool options using <b>heater</b> <b>mats,</b> electro-conductive textiles and wire heater elements have been evaluated. The curing capability of a prototype heated tool incorporating wire heater elements has been proved by carrying out a number of curing tests on RFI (Resin Fihn Infusion) laminates. The moulded laminates indicate that a 78 - 83 % extent of cure is achieved prior to post-cure. The fibre and void content of cured laminates has also been verified through acid digestion and microscopy, where an acceptable fibre volume fraction (Vf) of 55 - 57 % and a void content of less than 2 % have been achieved. The usefulness of ID and 3 D thermal Finite Element Analysis for the design and simulation of heated tooling has also been studied. A manufacturing and cost analysis study carried out has identified potential production implications, while the cost effectiveness of heated tooling compared to oven and autoclave processmg has been indicated. Cost reductions are noted in capital investments, operational costs and production set-up costs per part. The work described in this thesis gives valuable information for the implementation of heated tooling as a new processing method for aerospace composite products. The information can prove useful when considermg the processing options of large composite parts such as wing spars, fan cowl doors and wing skins. GKN Aerospace Service...|$|R
40|$|Research was {{conducted}} to assess {{the effects of the}} type of zone <b>heater</b> and floor <b>mat</b> used in a wean-to-finish building on the thermal environment created for newly weaned pigs and resulting pig performance. Gas-fired brooder heaters were compared to electric heat lamps and farm-cut wood sheathing was compared to commercial [unheated] rubber floor mats. No consistent differences in air temperature near the heating zone were found between either of the treatments. However, black-globe temperatures in pens having gas-fired <b>heaters</b> and/or wood <b>mats</b> were consistently warmer than in their comparison pens. Temperature deviations during the 26 -day study period were similar statistically for both air and black-globe temperatures (about ± 2. 5 °F) for all treatments, as were the temperature deviations from pen to pen for all treatment combinations (± 1. 7 °F or less). Pig health was affected by an outbreak of porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRSV). Performance of the disease-challenged pigs was similar for the two heating systems. However, pigs in pens having wood sheathing on the floor below the zone heater consumed more feed on a daily basis than those resting on rubber mats. This evidence supports statistically significant (P 3 ̆c 0. 05) advantages for the wood mats in pig weight (+ 3...|$|R
40|$|Two novel {{approaches}} {{to extend the}} lifetimes of commercial FeCrAIRE alloys, such as Aluchrom YHf and Kanthal AF, for industrial usage have been developed by the CEC funded SMILER Project. These surface treatments either increased the available alloy Al reservoir by alloying, aluminising, or cladding/plating or preformed an alpha-Al 2 O 3 protective scale by gas annealing. An extensive series of evaluation testing in laboratory air, extending to either 3000 h or chemical failure whichever was shorter, has been under-taken at temperatures between 800 degrees and 1300 degrees C on alloy coupons {{in the form of}} both 50,mu m thick foil or 1 mm thick sheet. This has been augmented by selected further exposures of surface treated near real-life components (fibre <b>mat</b> <b>heater</b> burners and alloy supports for automobile emission control catalysts). The results of all these evaluation tests are fully detailed in this paper and have established both the viability of these procedures and their range of technological applicability...|$|R
40|$|Research was {{conducted}} to assess {{the effects of the}} type of zone <b>heater</b> and floor <b>mat</b> used in a wean-to-finish facility on pig performance and operating cost. Gas-fired brooder heaters were compared to 250 W heat lamps and farm-cut wood sheathing was compared to commercial (unheated) rubber floor mats for a 21 -day post-weaning period. There was no effect of heating system or mat type on pig performance, either during the 21 - day period immediately post-weaning or to slaughter. Black globe temperatures near the pig zone were slightly higher for the propane-fired heaters compared to the heat lamps, most likely due to the method and temperature settings used to control the gas flow to the heaters. Black globe temperatures were slightly higher for the wood mats versus the rubber mats, most likely due to the difference in infrared energy absorption between the black mats and the natural wood colored mats. When amortized over a seven-year payback period, total operating expense for the heat lamps and propane brooders was estimated to be similar based on 25 pigs per pen and 20 pens per propane control module. These results suggest that both types of heating systems are effective in maintaining an acceptable temperature zone for weaned pigs. They also suggest little difference in performance due to the type of floor mat under the zone heating device. The selection of heating system and floor mat material can be based on reasons other than pig performance...|$|R
