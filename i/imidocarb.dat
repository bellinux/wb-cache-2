40|$|Reasons for {{performing}} study: <b>Imidocarb</b> dipropionate is the {{drug of choice}} for equine piroplasmosis, but its administration causes severe colic and diarrhoea. An <b>imidocarb</b> protocol that reduces these signs is required. Objectives: (1) Quantification {{of the effects of}} <b>imidocarb</b> dipropionate on equine orocaecal transit time (OCTT), with and without atropine or glycopyrrolate premedication; (2) Investigation of an improved pre-treatment regimen for <b>imidocarb</b> administration. Hypothesis: Treatment with <b>imidocarb</b> dipropionate will result in colic and reduced OCTT as demonstrated by the lactose 13 C-ureide breath test (LUBT), which will be ameliorated by premedication with atropine or glycopyrrolate. Methods: The effects of three drug therapies on OCTT were compared in six healthy horses in a randomised double-blind study versus a saline control: (i) <b>imidocarb</b> dipropionate 2. 4 mg/kg intramuscularly (IM) with intravenous saline (I/S); (ii) <b>imidocarb</b> dipropionate 2. 4 mg/kg IM with atropine 0. 035 mg/kg IV (I/A); (iii) <b>imidocarb</b> dipropionate 2. 4 mg/kg IM with glycopyrrolate 0. 0025 mg/kg IV (I/G). The LUBT was used to measure OCTT in each case, and significance of treatment effect determined by a linear model analysis of variance (ANOVA). Results: I/A treatment caused an increase in OCTT (P < 0. 05), whereas I/S produced a non-significant decrease in OCTT. I/S caused colic and diarrhoea in four of six horses after injection, which was not seen in any horse with I/A or I/G treatments or saline control. Intestinal borborygmi were increased in I/S and decreased in I/A treated individuals respectively. Conclusions: I/S treatment induced colic signs and a potential reduction in OCTT, whilst I/A treatment increased OCTT significantly when compared to I/S.

40|$|Equine {{piroplasmosis}} is a tick-transmitted disease {{caused by}} Theileria equi or Babesia caballi leading to haemolytic anaemia. <b>Imidocarb</b> {{is an effective}} treatment of piroplasmosis, but adverse clinical signs, including colic and diarrhoea, from cholinesterase inhibition are associated with its use. Atropine is advocated {{for the treatment of}} cholinesterase inhibiting compounds. Atropine is known to have a prolonged inhibitory effect on gastrointestinal motility. Glycopyrrolate is an anticholinergic drug that has similar effects to atropine on gastrointestinal motility, but with decreased penetration of blood-brain and blood-aqueous barrier. This study was performed to assess the adverse clinical effects of a therapeutic dose of <b>imidocarb,</b> the effect of this dose on gastrointestinal motility, and on cholinesterase activity. The ability of atropine or glycopyrrolate to ameliorate imidocarb’s adverse clinical signs, and the effect of the combination of atropine and <b>imidocarb</b> or glycopyrrolate and <b>imidocarb</b> on gastrointestinal motility was evaluated. A blinded crossover trial was performed in 8 horses. All horses were administered saline (CON), <b>imidocarb</b> 2. 4 mg/kg im and saline iv (IMI), <b>imidocarb</b> 2. 4 mg/kg im and atropine 0. 02 mg/kg iv (IMATROP) and <b>imidocarb</b> 2. 4 mg/kg im and glycopyrrolate 2. 5 µg/kg iv (IMGLYCO), with a one week wash-out period between treatments. Butrylcholinesterase activity was measured in the CON and IMI group. Clinical signs, gastrointestinal motility and faecal production were assessed. Gastrointestinal motility was measured by abdominal auscultation and frequency of contractions in the duodenum, caecum and right dorsal colon visualized with transcutaneous abdominal ultrasound. Total faecal production, faecal dry matter, wet matter, faecal water percentage, frequency of defaecation and time to first defaecation was assessed. Abdominal pain and diarrhoea were observed in the IMI group. Borborygmi and frequency of intestinal contractions were not different in the IMI group compared to CON. Percentage water content, faecal production, faecal dry matter and frequency of defaecation were significantly increased in the IMI group. Butrylcholinesterase activity was not significantly decreased in the IMI group compared to CON. In the IMATROP group colic signs were observed, heart rate was significantly elevated and mydriasis was evident. Borborygmi and frequency of contractions in the right dorsal colon was significantly reduced in the IMATROP group. In the IMGLYCO group the incidence and severity of colic induced by <b>imidocarb</b> was reduced. Heart rate was significantly increased and borborygmi significantly decreased compared to CON. The effect of IMGLYCO on heart rate and borborygmi was significantly less than the effect of IMATROP. In the IMGLYCO group the frequency of ultrasound visualised intestinal contractions and faecal variables were not different from CON. Therapeutic doses of <b>imidocarb</b> are associated with clinical signs of muscarinic stimulation including colic and diarrhoea, and enhanced faecal production. Clinical signs of cholinesterase inhibition can be present without significant depression in plasma cholinesterase activity. Atropine prevents diarrhoea and normalises faecal water percentage but is not effective in decreasing incidence of abdominal pain, and causes a prolonged inhibition of gastrointestinal motility, which might make this drug undesirable to use as a pre-treatment to <b>imidocarb</b> in clinically affected horses. Glycopyrrolate only partially reduces gastrointestinal motility and decreases adverse signs and thus its use as a pre-treatment to <b>imidocarb</b> is preferred.

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.), College of Veterinary Medicine, Washington State UniversityThe primary work {{presented}} involves {{evaluation of}} the apicomplexan hemoparasite Theileria equi for <b>imidocarb</b> dipropionate resistance, assessment of possible alternative treatment options, and investigation of the potential role for ATP-binding cassette transporters in drug resistance. An in vitro drug susceptibility assay was developed and adapted to multiple different drugs. The susceptibility of two T. equi isolates and a lab generated variant to both <b>imidocarb</b> dipropionate and the experimental bumped kinase inhibitor 1294 was assessed. Two distinct isolates of T. equi had an almost four-fold difference in <b>imidocarb</b> dipropionate susceptibility, and a variant generated through continuous in vitro <b>imidocarb</b> dipropionate exposure developed a further 15 -fold decrease in susceptibility. In contrast, {{there was no difference}} in susceptibility to bumped kinase inhibitor 1294, suggesting that these drugs may represent a possible alternative for resistant T. equi parasites. Also presented is the failure of four T. equi infected ponies to clear infection with the USDA Florida strain despite two rounds of <b>imidocarb</b> dipropionate treatment, a demonstration of drug resistance in vivo. This collective data raises concern for the existence and emergence of drug resistance at the parasite level. An investigation was undertaken of the 45 putative T. equi ATP-binding cassette transporters as potential mediators of <b>imidocarb</b> dipropionate efflux leading to drug resistance. Selection of the most likely candidate transporters based on differential transcription was accomplished using RNA sequencing. No experiments performed in this study supported <b>imidocarb</b> dipropionate as a substrate for efflux by the most differentially expressed ABC transporter BEWA_ 032300, however there are other transporters of interest and other mechanisms by which ABC transporters can contribute to drug resistance for further investigation. The described drug assay was utilized in a collaborative project to examine the effect of environmental exposures on the stability and efficacy of buparvaquone and parvaquone. T. equi was used as a model organism for Theileria parva, for which these drugs are vital in prophylaxis and treatment. It was found that air exposure causes significant drug degradation and subsequent loss of efficacy, a finding that has implications for successful treatment as well as the prevention of drug resistance development.

40|$|Previous {{studies have}} shown that four {{intramuscular}} doses of <b>imidocarb</b> dipropionate administered at 72 -hour treatment intervals are effective in sterilising experimental Babesia equi infections in horses. It has also been documented that <b>imidocarb</b> dipropionate has dose dependent hepato- and nephrotoxic effects in a number of species. The {{purpose of this study was}} to examine the clinical and clinicopathological effects of this multiple treatment regime of <b>imidocarb</b> dipropionate in healthy ponies. Specific emphasis was placed on the potential adverse effects on hepatic and renal function in this species. Serum bile acids and serum gamma glutamyltransferase activity were measured to evaluate the effect of this treatment regime on hepatic function. The diffuse hepatocellular necrosis and pronounced periportal hepatocellular swelling and degeneration previously reported as the most consistent hepatic lesions noted in equines following <b>imidocarb</b> treatment were not evident at the dose and dosage interval used in this study. Urinary gamma glutamyltransferase: creatinine ratios (IU/g) and fractional clearance of sodium, potassium and phosphate (%) were calculated as a measure of renal function. Urinary GGT and urinary GGT: creatinine ratios were significantly elevated on Day 5 of the trial and were considered indicative of transient changes in renal function. The rapid return to previous baseline values supported reported observations that changes between 25 and 100 IU/g may be a function of drug excretion and are not necessarily indicative of significant nephrotoxicity. It was concluded that four intramuscular treatments of <b>imidocarb</b> dipropionate at a dose of 4 mg/kg every 72 hours may be a relatively safe method whereby persistent Babesia equi infections can be sterilised.

The equine theileriosis, {{caused by}} Theileria equi, is an endemic disease of south of Rio Grande do Sul Brazil. There {{are signs that}} tick Rhipicephalus boophilus microplus still transmit that disease and in few time, some studies had experimental demonstrated it. The purpose of the first study {{of this paper was}} to demonstrate the tick infestation and the role of it in the transmission of the disease. In equines with contact directly with cattle, the serum incidence of the disease was 81, 8 % and in this group, 31, 8 % of this horses had tick infestation. In the equines that didn t have contact with cattle, the incidence of the disease was 12 % and no tick was found in this horses. The most efficient drug in the treatment of the disease is <b>imidocarb</b> dipropionate. Many studies had demonstrated different doses and protocols of treatment of the disease and the toxicity of it was obvious. No study had show the sterile of T. equi with this drug, but it s a way to treat the acute disease and to control the chronic theileriosis. The acute form of the disease is seemed with fever, icteric and death. The chronic kind of it is seemed with covered coat, hyporexia, low performance in athlete horses and loss of weight. The goal of the second study of this paper was to show the toxicity and the metabolic effects of <b>imidocarb</b> dipropionate drug into two protocols of treatment (two groups, 2 and 4 mg/kg) in serum positive horses to theileriosis. It was seemed through hepatic and renal profile that 2 mg/kg of the drug have low toxicity.

Doxycycline at 1 mg/mℓ had residual or rickettsiocidal activity against E. canis with the average percentages of DH 82 cells infected declining from 51 to 24 % while the organism was exposed to the drug (3 days) and from 21 to 2 % in the 6 days following removal of the drug from the cell culture medium...|$|E
40|$|The {{efficacy}} of <b>imidocarb</b> dipropionate {{for the treatment}} of Hepatozoon canis infection was studied in three naturally infected asymptomatic dogs followed longitudinally over 8 months. Response to treatment was followed by monitoring blood counts, parasitemia levels in blood, parasite in concentrated buffy-coat smears and by PCR. The dogs were initially treated with a low dose of 3. mg/kg <b>imidocarb</b> dipropionate twice a month and when parasitemia persisted after five treatments, with the regular dose of 6. mg/kg. In one dog, H. canis gamonts were no longer detectable by blood and buffy-coat microscopy after 2 months of therapy with 6. mg/kg while in the two other dogs gamonts were intermittently found in blood but persistently detectable in buffy-coat smears during the whole study period. Furthermore, combined therapy with doxycycline monohydrate administered at 10. mg/kg/day PO for 4 weeks also failed to eliminate H. canis. PCR revealed that parasite DNA was present in the blood of all dogs at all sampling dates regardless of treatment refuting the effectiveness of treatment suggested by negative blood microscopy. Detection of H. canis in buffy coat was found to be twice as sensitive than by blood smear and detection by PCR was even more sensitive revealing infection in eight samples (16 % of total samples) negative by blood and buffy-coat microscopy. In conclusion, <b>imidocarb</b> dipropionate was not effective in eliminating H. canis from dogs treated repeatedly over 8 months. Microscopical detection is not sufficient for the evaluation of treatment response in H. canis infection and follow up by molecular techniques is recommended...|$|E
40|$|Antimicrobial {{treatment}} of persistent infection to eliminate transmission risk represents a specific challenge requiring compelling evidence of complete pathogen clearance. The limited repertoire of antimicrobial agents targeted at protozoal parasites magnifies this challenge. Using Babesia caballi {{as both a}} model and a specific apicomplexan pathogen for which evidence of the elimination of transmission risk is required for international animal movement, we tested whether a high-dose regimen of <b>imidocarb</b> dipropionate cleared infection from persistently infected asymptomatic horses and/or eliminated transmission risk. Clearance with elimination of transmission risk {{was supported by the}} following four specific lines of evidence: (i) inability to detect parasites by quantitative PCR and nested PCR amplification, (ii) conversion from seropositive to seronegative status, (iii) inability to transmit infection by direct inoculation of blood into susceptible recipient horses, and (iv) inability to transmit infection by ticks acquisition fed on the treated horses and subsequently transmission fed on susceptible horses. In contrast, untreated horses remained infected and capable of transmitting B. caballi using the same criteria.

40|$|A questionnaire, {{designed}} to obtain qualitative {{information on a}} number of variables concerning canine babesiosis (biliary fever) in South Africa, was sent to 510 veterinary practices in late 1993. Of the 157 practices that responded, all were presented with cases of babesiosis and most were situated in Gauteng, the Western Cape and KwaZulu-Natal. Apart from the Western Cape, a winter-rainfall region, the prevalence of babesiosis cases in dogs was highest in summer. Most of the respondent practices treated between 1000 and 5000 sick dogs that included 100 to 500 babesiosis cases each year. Respondents identified cerebral babesiosis, enterorrhagia, 'red' or haemoconcentrated babesiosis, acute renal failure and pulmonary babesiosis or 'shock lung', amongst others, as the most prevalent forms of complicated ('atypical') babesiosis. Diminazene, <b>imidocarb</b> and trypan blue were the most popular antibabesials. Trypan blue was most often used in shocked patients, whereas diminazene and <b>imidocarb</b> were preferred when there was a high parasitaemia in the absence of shock. At least 19 antibabesial treatment regimens were used in practices. These comprised the use of single doses of antibabesial drugs; split doses with repeat injections, and combined drug variations, some of which are undesirable due to possible sterilisation of Babesia infection or potential toxicity. Side-effects were most commonly associated with <b>imidocarb</b> use. Ninety-six percent of respondents used supportive treatment (e. g. corticosteroids, vitamins and 'liver support') in all cases of babesiosis. The use of blood transfusion as supportive treatment varied according to practice and severity of the case. Most practices never cross-matched blood to be transfused, and transfusion reactions were rare. Diminazene was most frequently incriminated in cases where drug 'resistance' or relapses occurred. Cerebral and 'red' cases resulted in high mortality. Treatment of babesiosis costs the dog-owning public in South Africa more than R 20 million each year. Information on the distribution and possible complicating role of Ehrlichia canis was obtained. Development of a vaccine was the first research priority identified...|$|E

40|$|Medicinal {{turpentine}} {{has been}} used extensively in the eastern Free State and KwaZulu-Natal provinces of South Africa with reportedly excellent results. It is believed that {{it is able to}} prevent and treat babesiosis (redwater) in cattle. Redwater is an often-fatal disease in cattle and results in losses of large numbers every year in South Africa. This study was initiated in an attempt to investigate the validity of the use of the turpentine as a medicinal agent. Using a semi in vitro screening assay, Babesia caballi grown in primary equine erythrocytes was exposed to various concentrations of turpentine in comparison to diminazene and <b>imidocarb.</b> The turpentine had no parasiticidal effect following direct exposure. During the recovery phase, the previously exposed parasites appeared to grow more slowly than the controls. In comparison, diminazene and <b>imidocarb</b> were 100 % effective in killing the parasites. In a subsequent tolerance study in adult cattle (n = 6) at 1 x (2 mL), 3 x and 5 x the recommended dose, the product was non-toxic. Irritation was noted at the injection site with the higher dose. The only major finding on clinical pathology was a general increase in globulins, without a concurrent change in native babesia antibody titres. It was concluded that it is unlikely that medicinal turpentine is an effective treatment against babesiosis. [URL]...|$|E
40|$|Anaplasma marginale {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{prevalent}} tick-borne pathogens of cattle worldwide. Cattle that recover from acute anaplasmosis become carriers in which low or microscopically undetectable A. marginale rickettsemia persists. There are currently no antimicrobials approved for elimination of persistent infections. In this report we tested the efficacy of various antimicrobial treatment regimens to clear persistent A. marginale infections. In the first study, administration of oxytetracycline at 30 mg/kg, intramuscularly (IM) once or twice 5 days apart was not effective for elimination of the persistent infections. Furthermore, the study demonstrated that the current recommended OIE treatment protocol of 5 injections of oxytetracycline administered at 22 mg/kg intravenously (IV) was also ineffective. In the second study we used flow cytometric analysis to evaluate the effect of antimicrobials against A. marginale in short-term whole erythrocyte cultures. Enrofloxacin inhibited A. marginale in a concentration dependent manner, while higher concentrations of <b>imidocarb</b> were less effective in reducing the number of viable organisms. Oxytetracycline was found to be the least efficacious antimicrobial in this culture system. Cultures of erythrocytes infected with the Oklahoma isolate exposed to 4. 0 mug/ml enrofloxacin and those of the Virginia and Oklahoma isolates exposed to 1. 0 mug/ml appeared to be sterilized. Cultures exposed to 16 mug/ml oxytetracycline were not sterilized. As a result of these data we tested the efficacy of enrofloxacin (BaytrilRTM 100, Bayer Animal Health) against severe experimental A. marginale infections in splenectomized calves. These data indicate that enrofloxacin administered at 12. 5 mg/kg twice, 48 hours apart ameliorates, but does not clear, A. marginale infection in splenectomized calves. Finally we compared the efficacy of enrofloxacin, <b>imidocarb</b> and oxytetracycline against persistent Anaplasma marginale infections. The results suggest that apparent clearance of persistent infections occurred in one calf treated with <b>imidocarb</b> dipropionate at 5 mg/kg administered IM twice, 7 days apart, and one calf treated with oxytetracycline administered at 22 mg/kg g 24 h for 5 days. No calves treated with 5 mg/kg intravenous enrofloxacin for 5 days were cleared. Further studies are warranted to investigate whether dose regimens can be identified to reliably eliminate persistent A. marginale infections...|$|E
40|$|Histological and {{electron}} microscopic {{examinations of}} the kidneys of 8 dogs suffering from fatal, naturally acquired Babesia canis infection and nephropathy are presented. Seven animals {{were treated with}} <b>imidocarb</b> dipropionate on average 4. 5 days prior to death. Severe anaemia was present only in 2 cases. Degenerative histological changes observed mostly in the proximal convoluted tubules included vacuolar-hydropic degeneration, necrosis and detachment of renal tubular epithelial (RTE) cells from the basement membrane. Necrotic debris occasionally formed acidophilic casts within the tubules. In some cases, necrosis of the whole tubule was observed. Haemoglobin casts in the tubules and haemoglobin droplets in RTE cells seldom appeared. No significant histological changes were seen in the glomeruli. Ultrastructural lesions in RTE cells included nuclear membrane hyperchromatosis, karyopyknosis, karyolysis, swelling or collapse of mitochondria with fragmentation of cristae and vacuolar-hydropic degeneration in the endoplasmic reticulum and microvilli. Nuclear oedema was also observed. Many RTE cells exhibiting necrosis collapsed. Vacuolar-hydropic degeneration and necrosis were also observed in the glomerular and interstitial capillary endothelium. The severe acute tubular necrosis described {{in this study is}} probably the result of hypoxic renal injury. Systemic hypotension leading to vasoconstriction in the kidneys might be the most important cause of renal hypoxia in B. canis infections, but anaemia may also contribute to inadequate oxygenation. <b>Imidocarb</b> should be applied with caution in patients with possible renal involvement until further data become available on its potential nephrotoxicity in dogs...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Bovine {{babesiosis}} is a febrile, tick-borne {{disease of}} cattle and buffalo, caused {{by one or}} more protozoan parasites of the genus Babesia. The term "Babesiosis " refers to the acute form. In this study we selected animals from endemic area of Babesia bigemina infection that suffered from fever, emaciated, anemia, icterus and variable weight loss. The acute form is generally characterized by rapid growth and multiplication of the parasite in blood so diagnosis of babesiosis by microscopic examination is applicable in positive infected animals. These ones were distributed in three groups; each group consists of 50 animals and we selected twenty animals healthy (not infected) as control group. The infected animals of the first group was not treated as control positive, the second group was treated with <b>imidocarb</b> antibabesial drug and the third group was treated with <b>imidocarb</b> and Vit E as antioxidant. A comparison was made between the two methods of treatment by measuring erythrocytes antioxidant mechanisms representing in (G 6 PD, GR-ase,SOD and MDA) and in plasma (NO and trace element as antioxidant). Blood samples were collected from all animals from jugular vein: two samples, one on anticoagulant to measure erythrocytes antioxidant mechanisms and another to measure NO and trace elements. Results showed increased values of oxidant and decreased values of antioxidant in calves buffaloes suffered from parasitic infection as compared with healthy animals that especially for values of Nitric Oxide (NO) and Malondialdehyde (MDA). So, there was an increase in oxidative markers in animals infected with babisiosis while the levels of antioxidants suc...|$|E
