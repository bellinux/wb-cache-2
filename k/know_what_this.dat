500|$|Negative reviews {{revolved}} around the theme's classic Bond sound. LAUNCHcast's James Poletti called the song a [...] "perfectly competent Bond theme", but [...] "the formula seems a little too easy. Perhaps {{they would have done}} better to rise to the challenge of doing something a little different, something a little more knowingly tongue-in-cheek." [...] Melody Maker stated, [...] "You <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>this</b> sounds like before you hear it. If the people in charge want Garbage, then why not let them do what Garbage do?" [...] In its review of Absolute Garbage, Pitchfork called the song a [...] "predictable 'Goldfinger' permutation signaling the band's limitless affinity for big-budget theatrics." ...|$|E

500|$|On August 6, 1937, {{after the}} three acts were {{approved}} by the legislature, John Campbell Bowen, Lieutenant Governor of Alberta requested a meeting with Aberhart and Hugill before he granted royal assent to the legislation. [...] He asked Hugill whether he considered the bills constitutional, and Hugill replied in the negative. [...] Aberhart immediately {{said that he would}} take personal responsibility for the legislation's constitutionality, and Bowen granted assent. [...] In journalist John Barr's telling, as Aberhart and Hugill left the meeting the premier said [...] "your resignation is accepted, Hugill", while according to Elliott and Miller he said only [...] "you <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>this</b> means, don't you?" [...] Whatever the words used, Hugill resigned later that afternoon.|$|E
500|$|Hann {{says that}} when writers deal with [...] "upmarket" [...] readership, they [...] "need {{to be able to}} justify your coverage, and that [...] thinkpieces hailing the {{cultural}} significance of the new pop stars. ... And once you've decided these subjects matter, it's hard to turn round and say: 'Actually, you <b>know</b> <b>what?</b> <b>This</b> isn't much cop.'" [...] He recalls his experience as music editor for The Guardian, where he has [...] "been commissioning those pieces, knowing they will be read ... if no one wanted to read about Taylor Swift, you would never see another thinkpiece about her. Instead, we enter an arms race of hyperbole, as we credit her with forcing Apple to change its streaming terms, dismantling the musical patriarchy, creating new paradigms in music and society." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Ironic" [...] {{was written}} by Alanis Morissette and Glen Ballard, and {{produced}} by the former for her third studio album, Jagged Little Pill (1995). In an interview with Christopher Walsh of Billboard, Ballard explained how he and Morissette met, and how [...] "Ironic" [...] was written. He commented: [...] "I'm telling you, within 15 minutes we were at it—just writing. 'Ironic' was the third song we wrote. Oh God, we were just having fun. I thought 'I don't <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>this</b> is—what genre it is—who knows? It's just good". According to the sheet music published at Musicnotes.com, it is a song set in the time signature of common time, composed in a moderate tempo of eighty-two beats per minute. It {{is set in the}} key of B major with Morissette's vocal range from the tone of E5 to B5, and [...] "Ironic" [...] chord progression starts with the sequence of Emaj7–F♯6–Emaj7–F♯6, before changing to F♯–Badd2–F♯–G♯m7 in the chorus.|$|E

500|$|When Tracy calls Betty White, she is seen {{reading the}} book From Peanut to President, the fictional {{biography}} of U.S. President Jimmy Carter written by the character Milton Greene, played by actor Alan Alda, mentioned in the season finale episode of season three [...] "Kidney Now!", and seen for a moment during the cold open of season four episode [...] "Into the Crevasse". Jenna says she once met director J. J. Abrams [...] "and I don't <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>this</b> means, {{but he said that}} the island was just Hurley's dream." [...] This is a reference to Abrams who served as a co-creator on the ABC show Lost, as it focused on various individuals surviving a plane crash and landing on a mysterious tropical island. Kenneth says a celebrity clogger died [...] "doing what he loved most: blogging on The Huffington Post", the latter being a liberal news and aggregated blog website that Alec Baldwin has been a contributor to since 2005. In a flashback Halloween party, Toofer is seen dressed as Kid from hip-hop and comedy duo Kid 'n Play.|$|E
500|$|Filming for {{the season}} began on August 31, and ended on December 19, 2015, with Edward J. Pei serving as {{director}} of photography. Unlike the first season, episodes were filmed concurrently, two at a time. Discussing the series' location move, Head of Marvel Television Jeph Loeb explained that [...] "Agent Carter season one took place in New York in 1946. It wasn't like {{we could go to}} New York and find 1946, so we shot in L.A. But that's {{part of the reason that}} when we talked about it, we said, 'You <b>know</b> <b>what?</b> <b>This</b> season let's stay in L.A.' Because so much of L.A. still looks like it did in 1946." [...] Butters expanded by saying the move to L.A. [...] "was something we had talked about in the middle of the first season... we realized that not only was it a good idea for the storytelling, but also...it's much easier for us to shoot L.A. for L.A. than try to shoot L.A. for New York." [...] She added the season hoped to film at Musso & Frank Grill, the Formosa Cafe, the Griffith Observatory, racetracks, piers, and other locations in Downtown Los Angeles.|$|E
500|$|At {{the time}} of Lyons' first {{interview}} with the gardaí, he was staying at the Salvation Army hostel in Grangegorman. Detective Garda William Mullis and Garda Joseph O'Connor approached {{him as he was}} leaving the hostel. They reported that Lyons said: [...] "I think I <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>this</b> is about". The gardaí brought Lyons to the Bridewell garda station, and interviewed him in the doctor's room. According to the gardaí, at one point during the interview, Lyons burst out crying and said that he had killed the two women. Lyons claimed that he was suffering withdrawal symptoms at the time and that he made the admission so that he could get more drugs. He said that Garda O'Connor had promised that the sooner he confessed, the sooner he would be released from custody and that he [...] "wasn't thinking straight". The gardaí say that he was told that he was not under arrest and that he could leave at any time. As a result of his confession, Dean Lyons was arrested on suspicion of murdering the two women at 13:46 on 26 July 1997.|$|E

2500|$|Russian {{writer and}} philosopher Leo Tolstoy was greatly {{influenced}} by Schopenhauer. After reading Schopenhauer's The World as Will and Representation, Tolstoy gradually became converted to the ascetic morality upheld in that work as the proper spiritual path for the upper classes: [...] "Do you <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>this</b> summer has meant for me? Constant raptures over Schopenhauer and {{a whole series of}} spiritual delights which I've never experienced before. ... no student has ever studied so much on his course, and learned so much, as I have this summer" ...|$|E
2500|$|On March 4, 1948, Walter Winchell named Gallinger {{as one of}} {{the players}} {{involved}} in the gambling scandal. The same day, Montreal sportswriter Dink Carroll spoke with Gallinger after the game between Boston and Montreal. [...] "You probably <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>this</b> is about, don't you?" [...] Carroll asks. [...] "Yes, you want to know if I've made any decision about baseball," [...] Gallinger answered. Carroll informed Gallinger that Winchell had just named him as the Boston player involved. [...] "Winchell", said Gallinger. [...] "Do you mean the fellow in New York?" [...] Initially Gallinger appeared too bewildered to comment, but eventually denied the accusations.|$|E

2500|$|On February 20, 2006, Ishihara also said: [...] "Roppongi is now {{virtually}} a foreign neighborhood. Africans—I don't mean African-Americans—who don't speak English are there doing who <b>knows</b> <b>what.</b> <b>This</b> {{is leading to}} new forms of crime such as car theft. We should be letting in people who are intelligent." ...|$|R
2500|$|The nursery {{was run by}} the parents, {{rather than}} by Hackney council. But Akass had telephoned Hackney council for its {{reaction}} to his story. Martin Bostock, then the press officer for Hackney council, {{reported that he had}} considered the possibility of simply responding that [...] "We don't <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>this</b> nursery is doing, but whatever they're doing it is up to them." [...] However, council leader Tony Millwood, according to Bostock, rejected this advice and wanted to take a more supportive stance on the alleged ban, and in conjunction with the press office drafted and issued a statement saying [...] "that we supported what they'd done, although making it quite clear {{that it was not a}} council nursery and not a council ban".|$|E
2500|$|Speaking of the {{thinking}} behind titling the album 'Pulse', Braxton explained to UK R writer Pete Lewis – Deputy Editor of Blues & Soul – in May 2010: [...] "It comes from when I got ill. I went into cardic rehab, {{and there was}} this older lady there. She was like 'What are you doing here so young? It must have been your heart. You <b>know</b> <b>what?</b> <b>This</b> is my fourth heart-attack and you're so young, you can't be AFRAID! You can't stop LIVING!'... Then she told me how she'd just got back from holiday with her 40-year-old boyfriend! And because I'd lost hope – the doctors had told me I'd never be able to record again – her conversation was like that heartbeat, that pulse that gave me back the love of life." ...|$|E
2500|$|The modern {{understanding}} is that heat radiation is, like light, electromagnetic radiation. However, Newton viewed heat and light as two different phenomena. He believed heat vibrations to be excited [...] "when a Ray of Light falls upon the Surface of any pellucid Body". He wrote, [...] "I do not <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>this</b> Aether is", but that if it consists of particles then they must be exceedingly smaller than those of Air, or even than those of Light: The exceeding smallness of its Particles {{may contribute to the}} greatness of the force by which those Particles may recede from one another, and thereby make that Medium exceedingly more rare and elastic than Air, and by consequence exceedingly less able to resist the motions of Projectiles, and exceedingly more able to press upon gross Bodies, by endeavoring to expand itself.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Oh, mamma,' said Katie, {{kissing her}} mother's hands, and her arms, {{and the very}} hem of her garment, 'oh, mamma, do not speak so. But I wish I <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> <b>this</b> sorrow is, so that I might share it with you; may I not be told, mamma? is it about Alaric?' ...|$|R

5000|$|In 1887 four vans, numbers 6, 7, 8 and 16, were {{fitted with}} long bars inside the roof, {{for the purpose}} of hanging meat while being transported. Around the same time, a note in the rollingstock {{registers}} indicates that vans 14 and 15 were fitted with [...] "side springs", although it is not <b>known</b> <b>what</b> <b>this</b> meant.|$|R
2500|$|During his {{period in}} Milan, Montini was {{widely seen as}} a {{progressive}} member of the Catholic hierarchy. He reformed pastoral care, adopting new approaches. He used his authority {{to ensure that the}} liturgical reforms of Pius XII were carried out at the local level and employed innovative methods to reach the people of Milan. For example, huge posters announced throughout the city that 1,000 voices would speak to them from 10 to 24 November 1957. More than 500 priests and many bishops, cardinals and lay people delivered 7,000 sermons in the period not only in churches but in factories, meeting halls, houses, courtyards, schools, offices, military barracks, hospitals, hotels and other places, wherever people congregated. His goal was the re-introduction of faith to a city without much religion. [...] "If only we can say Our Father and <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>this</b> means, then we would understand the Christian faith." ...|$|E
2500|$|A {{number of}} presidents have issued {{responses}} to these events. One of them, Presbyterian College president John Griffith, compared this movement {{to a form of}} revolution: [...] "I have lived long enough to {{come to the conclusion that}} major shifts occur every quarter century or so in the way American culture approaches matters of importance. We often call those shifts revolutions because people revolt against old and outmoded ways of doing things in favor of new approaches, new technologies and new ideas that better meet the needs of the time. We have experienced revolutions in information technology, travel and communication. There is one going on now that is symbolized by the introduction of iPhones this past week; we <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>this</b> one is about. But there is another revolution going on related to choosing a college -- and the role that public rankings play in that choice -- that may be less clear." ...|$|E
2500|$|Rousseau also {{mentioned}} the watchmaker theory. He wrote the following in his 1762 book, Emile: [...] I am {{like a man}} who sees the works of a watch for the first time; he is never weary of admiring the mechanism, though he does not know the use of the instrument and has never seen its face. I do not <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>this</b> is for, says he, but I see that each part of it is fitted to the rest, I admire the workman in the details of his work, and I am quite certain that all these wheels only work together in this fashion for some common end which I cannot perceive. Let us compare the special ends, the means, the ordered relations of every kind, then let us listen to the inner voice of feeling; what healthy mind can reject its evidence? Unless the eyes are blinded by prejudices, can they fail to see that the visible order of the universe proclaims a supreme intelligence? What sophisms must be brought together before we fail to understand the harmony of existence and the wonderful co-operation of every part for the maintenance of the rest? ...|$|E
6000|$|Waterville <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> <b>this</b> meant; it {{was already}} a treasure. Besides, he liked going to church, above all when {{he sat in the}} Squire’s pew, which was {{sometimes}} as big as a boudoir and all fadedly upholstered to match. So he replied that he should be delighted. Then he added without explaining his reason: “Is Mrs. Headway going?” ...|$|R
60|$|Lomaque {{looked up}} quickly, with that old {{weakness}} {{in his eyes}} which affected them in such a strangely irregular manner on certain occasions. Magloire <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> <b>this</b> symptom meant, and would have become confused {{if he had not}} been a police agent. As it was, he quietly backed a step or two from the table, and held his tongue.|$|R
6000|$|Lawford gulped {{and turned}} away. He hardly <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> <b>this</b> surge of feeling meant. Was it hope, despair, resentment; had he caught even {{the echo of}} an unholy joy? His mind for a moment became {{confused}} as if in the tumult of a struggle. He heard himself expostulate, 'Ah, Miss Bennett, I fear I set you too difficult a task.' ...|$|R
