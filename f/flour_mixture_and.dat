Subsequently, the cake with the best technological results was selected and both the selected cake and the control cake (without WCF) were evaluated for their nutritional and sensory qualities. The results showed that addition of WCF decreased the specific volume and colour parameters of the cakes. The variation in WCF and HVF contents contributed to maintenance of the moisture content during storage. The best technological results were obtained with cakes containing up to 15  g WCF/ 100  g <b>flour</b> <b>mixture</b> <b>and</b> from 16 to 20  g HVF/ 100  g flour mixture.

Buckwheat and barley round roll crumbs contained the highest total phenolic and total flavonoid contents, and were the most effective in enhancing antioxidant activity, which increased 15 -fold and 8 -fold, respectively, when compared to the control roll. The tested cereals effectively retarded formation of lipid hydroperoxides (from over 50 % to control), which are undesirable from both a nutrition and storage/shelf life perspective.

40|$|Considering that Brazil nut {{presents}} high nutritional potential, low {{consumption in}} Brazil, low added-value {{and is an}} organic product; that cassava has high productivity and low cost; and that the technology of thermoplastic extrusion presents wide applicability and considerable advantages, {{the objective of this}} work was to use these three variables, formulating Brazil nut <b>and</b> cassava <b>flour</b> <b>mixtures</b> <b>and</b> processing them by extrusion, with the aim of obtaining ready-to-eat extruded products containing high levels of vegetable protein. Semi-defatted Brazil nut cake and cassava flour were used to formulate the mixtures for extrusion. A complete factorial central composite design (2 (3)) with 3 independent variables, and the response surface methodology were used to evaluate the results of the proximate composition and caloric value, according to the variations in the quantity of nut, moisture content and temperature. The results indicate that the mixtures with higher Brazil nut levels present higher levels of protein, fat and ash, while the mixtures with less Brazil nut present higher levels of carbohydrate. The average regression coefficients of the statistical model for the responses are: moisture 7. 40; carbohydrate 51. 09; protein 15. 34; fat 11. 77; total fibre 9. 92 and kcal 371. 65. The trials with lower quantities of Brazil nut and higher quantities of flour are more expanded and of a lighter colour, while those with more Brazil nut do not expand and are greyish in colour.

A few wheat breads are still made in Finland, although most are simple buns or loaves of sliced or unsliced bread. Vesirinkeli, water rings, are small, almost tasteless rings of yeast-leavened wheat bread, which resemble bagels. They are cooked in salted boiling water before being baked.

Extrudates were processed using twin screw extruder at two different extrusion temperatures (140 and 160 °C) containing two different contents of tested <b>flour</b> <b>mixtures</b> (20 <b>and</b> 50 %). The raw materials and the extrudates were stored at - 18 °C and chemically characterized to determine fatty acid composition, tocopherol composition and total phenolic acid content.

The protein and dietary fibre content in lupine accounted for 29 and 50 g/ 100 g d. m., respectively. The extrudates containing 50 % lupine and processed at 140 °C possessed higher content of oleic, linoleic and linolenic fatty acids. At higher content of tested flours, extrusion cooking at 160 °C resulted in better retention of unsaturated fatty acids in the extrudates of amaranth, kañiwa and quinoa. Higher extrusion temperatures resulted in lower retention of tocopherols in all the extrudates. The total phenolic acid resulted in higher contents in the extrudates of kañiwa when compared to other extrudates. At higher seed contents of tested flours (%), higher retention of total phenolic acid was achieved during extrusion cooking at 140 °C in the extrudates of amaranth, quinoa and kañiwa.
