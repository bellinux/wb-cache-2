Some of analytical possibilities of <b>data</b> <b>on</b> regional <b>employment</b> are illustrated by simple input-output analysis with three scenarios. The regions are also tested for output and employment sensitivity by estimating multipliers and elasticities. The interpretation of obtained results including hierarchical clustering is provided.
