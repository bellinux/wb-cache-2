25|$|In 1989 he co-founded the League for Programming Freedom. Since the mid-1990s, Stallman {{has spent}} most of his time advocating for free {{software}}, as well as campaigning against software patents, digital restrictions management, and other legal and technical systems which he sees as taking away users' freedoms. This has included software license agreements, non-disclosure agreements, activation keys, <b>dongles,</b> copy restriction, proprietary formats and binary executables without source code.|$|E
25|$|Chromecast {{is a line}} {{of digital}} media players {{developed}} by Google. The devices, designed as small <b>dongles,</b> enable users with a mobile device or personal computer to initiate and control playback of Internet-streamed audio/visual content on a high-definition television or home audio system through mobile and web apps that support the Google Cast technology. Alternatively, content can be mirrored from the Google Chrome web browser running on a personal computer, {{as well as from}} the screen of some Android devices.|$|E
5000|$|Using a <b>dongle</b> {{to store}} the key, {{assuming}} that the user will not allow the <b>dongle</b> to be stolen with the laptop or that the <b>dongle</b> is encrypted as well.|$|R
50|$|A lost {{or stolen}} <b>dongle</b> often {{requires}} {{the user to}} pay full price for a completely new licence. Many companies do the same even for a broken <b>dongle,</b> rather than exchanging the non-working <b>dongle</b> for a new one.|$|R
5000|$|Software {{could be}} <b>dongle</b> {{protected}} (the custom modem doubled as the <b>dongle</b> in this instance).|$|R
25|$|Chromecast {{devices are}} <b>dongles</b> that are powered by {{connecting}} the device's micro-USB port to an {{external power supply}} or a USB port. Video-capable Chromecasts plug into the HDMI port of a high-definition television or monitor, while the audio-only model outputs sound through its integrated 3.5 millimeter audio jack/mini-TOSLINK socket. By default, Chromecasts connect to the Internet through a Wi-Fi connection to the user's local network; a standalone USB power supply with an Ethernet port, introduced in July 2015 for US$15, allows for a wired connection.|$|E
2500|$|The 2000 [...] "literary works {{including}} computer programs" [...] exemption {{was limited}} to [...] "Computer programs protected by <b>dongles</b> that prevent access due to malfunction or damage and which are obsolete" [...] and this exemption was renewed in both 2006 and 2010.|$|E
2500|$|Computer {{programs}} {{protected by}} <b>dongles</b> that prevent access due to malfunction or damage {{and which are}} obsolete. A dongle shall be considered obsolete if {{it is no longer}} manufactured or if a replacement or repair is no longer reasonably available in the commercial marketplace. (A renewed exemption from 2006, based on a similar exemption approved in 2003.) ...|$|E
50|$|The {{controller}} {{connects to}} the PS3 wirelessly via a USB <b>dongle.</b> In order to facilitate syncing between the <b>dongle</b> and the controller, each has a sync button. The <b>dongle</b> also features a 2-port USB hub, allowing additional peripherals {{to be connected to}} the PS3 system. Unlike guitar and drum controllers, the Wii version does not connect via the Wii remote, and instead connects via a USB <b>dongle.</b>|$|R
50|$|Electric Jukebox <b>dongle</b> has a HDMI plug {{built into}} the body of the device. The <b>dongle</b> is powered by mains power through an {{integrated}} power cable. Electric Jukebox runs on a Rockchip processor. The <b>dongle</b> contains a 3.5mm audio jack as a line out to HiFi’s and speaker systems.|$|R
50|$|HD Audio {{can sense}} the {{presence}} of an audio <b>dongle.</b> A 10 kΩ pull-up resistor is attached to pin 4 (PRESENCE#). When the HDA <b>dongle</b> is plugged in, it pulls pin 4 to ground with a 1 kΩ resistor. The motherboard can determine if the <b>dongle</b> is plugged in by examining the logic level on pin 4. If the motherboard does not detect {{the presence of}} an HDA <b>dongle,</b> then it should ignore SENSE1_RETURN (pin 6) and SENSE2_RETURN (pin 10) signals. In AC'97, pins 2 and 4 are audio ground, but pin 4 is often disconnected. Consequently, an HDA motherboard would not detect {{the presence of an}} AC'97 <b>dongle</b> with a disconnected pin 4.|$|R
2500|$|As {{of the end}} of 2013 {{there are}} {{approximately}} 2,000 business and high-end residential users of fixed Internet services in Sierra Leone and somewhere in the region of 10,000 users with Internet <b>dongles</b> provided by the mobile operators. [...] 3G Mobile Internet services are available throughout the country, though quality can be poor in the east. Businesses operating outside of Freetown generally have to rely on VSAT satellite services.|$|E
5000|$|Modern <b>dongles</b> include {{built-in}} {{strong encryption}} and use fabrication techniques designed to thwart reverse engineering. Typical <b>dongles</b> also now contain non-volatile memory [...] - [...] essential {{parts of the}} software may actually be stored and executed on the dongle. Thus <b>dongles</b> have become secure cryptoprocessors that execute program instructions that may be input to the cryptoprocessor only in encrypted form. The original secure cryptoprocessor was designed for copy protection of personal computer software (see US Patent 4,168,396, Sept 18, 1979) to provide more security than <b>dongles</b> could then provide. See also bus encryption.|$|E

5000|$|Presence of {{built-in}} HSDPA, etc., {{may help}} to avoid USB <b>dongles.</b>|$|E
50|$|Dongle drivers bring {{problems}} for end-users. Most developers and software vendors {{want to get}} rid of the dongle driver headache. There are some driverless <b>dongles</b> on the market, which make the protection easy for both software vendors and end-users. Most of driverless <b>dongles</b> are based-on HID technology, which works like a mouse or keyboard.|$|E
5000|$|There are {{potential}} {{weaknesses in the}} implementation of the protocol between the <b>dongle</b> and the copy-controlled software. It requires considerable cunning to make this hard to crack. For example, a simple implementation might define a function to check for the <b>dongle's</b> presence, returning [...] "true" [...] or [...] "false" [...] accordingly, but the <b>dongle</b> requirement can be easily circumvented by modifying the software to always answer [...] "true".|$|R
50|$|Drawing Express {{requires}} a USB <b>dongle</b> {{to be present}} on the system it is running on. This is the license for the software and without a <b>dongle</b> present on the system, the program will not open or save drawings.|$|R

5000|$|DV-AP: A DVAP <b>Dongle</b> (DV Access Point <b>Dongle)</b> {{is also a}} USB {{device that}} creates a {{connection}} to the D-STAR network through an Internet connected computer. But instead of using the computer's audio system, the DVAP <b>Dongle</b> has an antenna and a 10 mW two-meter transceiver that provides short-range over-the-air access using a D-STAR radio (usually a handheld). Note that a D-STAR radio is required. The DVAP does not convert an analog FM signal to D-STAR.|$|R
5000|$|Live view {{available}} with Phase One 645AF and 645DF bodies (+ Mamiya AFD III & DF), no <b>dongle</b> required. Live view {{is available on}} Capture One with large format bodies for legacy Aptus 22 and up, Live View <b>dongle</b> is no longer required.|$|R
5000|$|Buzz!: Quiz TV saw {{the release}} of a {{wireless}} version of the buzzers. They connect to the PS2 or PS3 system via a USB <b>dongle.</b> Each <b>dongle</b> can support up to 4 wireless buzzers so this means another <b>dongle</b> is required for 8 player play with 8 wireless buzzers. The wireless buzzers can be used with both the PlayStation 2 and PlayStation 3 and all previous Buzz! games. Examples of these buzzers have been produced by companies such as digigames ...|$|R

30|$|There {{are several}} {{commercial}} sensing solutions {{running on a}} regular computer with a USB <b>dongle.</b> The USB <b>dongle</b> functions as the RF front-end while the host computer provides the user interface and the visualization functionality. Some of the well-known devices are Wi-Spy[9] and Airmagnet[10].|$|R
50|$|A related {{application}} is the hardware <b>dongle</b> required by some computer programs to prove {{ownership of the}} software. The <b>dongle</b> is placed in an input device and the software accesses the I/O device in question to authorize {{the use of the}} software in question.|$|R
50|$|The Atari ST version shipped with a <b>dongle</b> {{purporting}} to be a 16-channel sound card. This {{was required to}} play the game, but resulted in no sound being transmitted to the attached monitor or television, and to get any sound at all the user was forced to either play the game wearing headphones plugged into the <b>dongle,</b> or purchase external speakers. It is also dubious whether the <b>dongle</b> produced higher quality sound, since the music did not feature any more channels than regular sound-chip music.|$|R
