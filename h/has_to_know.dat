5|$|The {{spectrum}} {{of light that}} comes from a single source (see idealized spectrum illustration top-right) can be measured. To determine the redshift, one searches for features in the spectrum such as absorption lines, emission lines, or other variations in light intensity. If found, these features can be compared with known features in the {{spectrum of}} various chemical compounds found in experiments where that compound is located on Earth. A very common atomic element in space is hydrogen. The spectrum of originally featureless light shone through hydrogen will show a signature spectrum specific to hydrogen that has features at regular intervals. If restricted to absorption lines it would look similar to the illustration (top right). If the same pattern of intervals is seen in an observed spectrum from a distant source but occurring at shifted wavelengths, it can be identified as hydrogen too. If the same spectral line is identified in both spectra—but at different wavelengths—then the redshift can be calculated using the table below. Determining the redshift of an object in this way requires a frequency- or wavelength-range. In order to calculate the redshift one <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> the wavelength of the emitted light in the rest frame of the source, in other words, the wavelength that would be measured by an observer located adjacent to and comoving with the source. Since in astronomical applications this measurement cannot be done directly, because that would require travelling to the distant star of interest, the method using spectral lines described here is used instead. Redshifts cannot be calculated by looking at unidentified features whose rest-frame frequency is unknown, or with a spectrum that is featureless or white noise (random fluctuations in a spectrum).|$|E

After discussing his findings with Sara over dinner, Tsukuru decides he <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> {{the rest of the}} story. To do so he must visit the only other surviving member of the friendship group, Kuro, who now lives in Finland with two daughters. While preparing for the visit, Tsukuru goes to buy presents for Kuro's children and sees Sara hand in hand with a middle-aged man, smiling in a way she never did with Tsukuru.|$|E

25|$|When {{the writing}} team worked on an episode, each writer took a {{character}} {{and wrote the}} individual scenes surrounding them. These stories were then combined and given to the episode writer. This system allowed every writer to contribute to every episode, and enabled the writing team to finish scripts sooner, so the filming crew could shoot more scenes at a location. Kring described the writing process as a collaborative one and stated that the collaboration process was important because production needed to shoot several scenes at a single location. To do this, several scripts had to be ready. Jesse Alexander, co-producer and writer, explained that this process was important in a serialized drama because one <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> where each character's development is heading.|$|E

She described it as self-explanatory, saying that it speaks of reviving love and [...] "keeping things very interesting". [...] "A woman <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> when to set the pace, because that's what men need. So that's what the song is about", she said. Musically, [...] "Make Love" [...] is an R ballad, set in a slinky slow jam groove. Patrick Varine of The Observer-Dispatch referred it to as a [...] "hacky mid-'90s R" [...] song, and its slow tempo was compared to ballads by American singer Ciara. According to Mariel Concepcion of Billboard, the song sees Hilson tapping into her vulnerable side.|$|E

[...] A practitioner of the art <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> that the action he or she [...] "wants" [...] to perform has already been performed. For example, to imagine oneself behind an opponent at the current moment in time; when trained well, this knowledge will place you at the spot desired.|$|E

He didn't want to be a business-man, because you <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> business; and he didn't want to be a school-teacher, because he had seen too many of them. As far as he had any choice, it lay between being Robinson Crusoe and being the Prince of Wales. His father refused him both and put him into a dry goods establishment.|$|R

2500|$|Espada {{had become}} {{head of the}} tenant's {{association}} at Stevenson Commons and led the effort in 1978 to open what became the Soundview Health Center after the city's economic problems led to a decision to not establish a promised clinic in the complex. The empty building that {{was to have been}} the clinic was leased by the group and $50,000 in federal grants was obtained, with the first patient taken in October 1981. By 1992, Soundview was offering medical and preventive care to 45,000 patients annually, and was also running a computer literacy program, serving lunch to hundreds of seniors daily and distributing surplus food. The New York Times noted that the health center featured Espada's name and image throughout the facility, describing it as having [...] "elements of a cult of personality", though Espada explained it as [...] "The community <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> you" [...] so that [...] "In the end, they will trust you".|$|E
