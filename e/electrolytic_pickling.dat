The {{cold-rolled}} {{production line}} of double-line continuous <b>electrolytic</b> <b>pickling</b> {{is quite common}} {{in the manufacture of}} all kinds of small-diameter cold-rolled thread steel. This paper studies the main technology parameters, the main device with the structure characteristics and the principle of the cold-rolled production line of double-line continuous <b>electrolytic</b> <b>pickling,</b> and then analyzes on the experiments and on the technological economics for the small-diameter cold-rolled thread steel. The results show that its production line is convenient in operation, accurate in processing, efficient and adaptable in production. The small-diameter cold-rolled thread steel produced by this production line has high strength, large plasticity and good yield performance and bending characteristics. It can greatly improve the performance of reinforced concrete structure and prestress reinforced concrete structure, increases the quality of components, and saves steel about 15 %. So it is a high efficiency, energy-saving steel. Small-diameter cold-rolled thread steel is widely used in the construction industry with very significant economic and social benefits, it plays an important role to accelerate the economic construction of China...|$|E
40|$|In {{industrial}} <b>electrolytic</b> <b>pickling,</b> a {{steel strip}} with oxidized surfaces is passed through an aqueous electrolyte between a configuration of electrodes, across which a potential difference is applied. The strip is thereby indirectly polarized, and electrochemical reactions at the strip surface {{result in the}} dissolution of the oxide layer and the evolution of hydrogen and oxygen bubbles. In this paper, we extend an earlier mathematical model for the electrochemical aspects of the process, which took account only of the liquid phase, to include the effect of the gas phase. The model is two-dimensional, steady-state and isothermal, and comprises five ionic species, the mixture velocity, pressure, and the gas fraction; numerical solutions of this model are then obtained. The results of the single and two-phase models are compared, and their implications for the actua...|$|E
