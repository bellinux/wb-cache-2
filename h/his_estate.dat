5|$|By {{the turn}} of the 18th century, Felling {{consisted}} of little more than the large Brandling estate and a small scattering of tiny farming villages. However, Ralph Brandling, the incumbent of the Brandling estate at that time, had come to realise the value of the rich coal deposits on <b>his</b> <b>estate</b> and began drift mining around 1670. He initially found the large coal seams under <b>his</b> <b>estate</b> difficult to extract due to their depth, and indeed it was imported coal from Newcastle-upon-Tyne which saw the development of more extensive industries in salt, glass and chemicals which began to attract workers to the area. At around 1750, a large copper-works was opened at the banks of the River Tyne; the first such works to be developed on the river. Encouraged by these developments, Ralph Brandling's son, Charles Brandling, firstly commissioned more extensive mining of near-surface coal on <b>his</b> <b>estate</b> and then, encouraged by the discovery of several strata below <b>his</b> <b>estate,</b> began boring operations in 1758 to allow ultimately for deeper coal extraction. The result was the opening of Felling Colliery in 1779, working on the High Main stratum at a depth of 125 fathoms. A brown paper mill was also opened in 1798.|$|E
