40|$|It is {{normally}} considered safe to apply an impermeable floor covering to concrete surfaces when the surface relative humidity reaches 75 % {{as determined by}} a surface hygrometer. However, over time, defects can appear on the covering such as blistering of vinyl and rising of tiles from the surface. One cause is the on-going diffusion of the residual moisture deep within the slab to the surface. The covering traps this residual moisture, thus preventing evaporation to the ambient air and gradually generates a vapour pressure underneath the covering, which can result in damage. Here, experimental results on the long-term influence of an impermeable covering on the moisture condition in concrete in normal and <b>forced</b> <b>drying</b> conditions are presented. They show primarily that slabs in a <b>forced</b> <b>drying</b> environment result in a significant residue of moisture deep in the slab. As a result, a greater vapour pressure is generated under the covering compared with those drying at normal conditions.

The current standard states that impervious floor coverings should not be applied until the surface of the floor reaches a relative humidity (RH) of 75 %, established using a surface hygrometer test. Tests at Trinity College Dublin on drying concrete slabs in natural and <b>forced</b> <b>drying</b> environments show that there is a large variation in the residue of moisture deep in the concrete when the floor covering is applied, particularly so in a <b>forced</b> <b>drying</b> environment [1].

The analysis {{is carried out}} using a detailed model of a biomass gasification CHP plant developed with Aspen Plus. The model describes: wood drying and gasification in a dual fluidized bed (DFB) reactor, syngas cleaning, as well as combustion in a gas engine for electricity production. Heat is recovered from the CHP system for internal needs and for district and domestic water heating. An accurate prediction of tar and inorganic contaminants is developed for proper modeling of syngas cleaning efficiency. The influence of wood moisture content, drying conditions, flow rate of the sand circulating in the DFB reactor, catalyst and scrubbing agent efficiencies, as well as additional electricity production through steam turbine on the overall process performances is studied. On the basis of the comparative analysis of nine case studies, it is found that the highest energetic efficiencies are obtained when <b>forced</b> <b>drying</b> is not implemented in the CHP system. Lowering the inlet wood moisture content with natural drying (energy-free) prior to the CHP plant improves the electrical efficiency. An overall energeticefficiency of 74 % (23 % electric, 51 % thermal; based on the lower heating value of wood on anhydrous basis) is then reached with wood fed at 30 % moisture content. The best exergetic efficiency is reached when wood (naturally dried to 30 %) is dried further to 15 % by <b>forced</b> <b>drying</b> in the CHP plant and when some of the high-temperature heat is recovered for electricity production via steam turbine instead of district heating.

In this research, we tested the effects of several methods of grain drying, freezing, vacuum and storage on grain viability and quality for flour production. Environmental and genotypic factors have minor effects on grain production and quality, and the genotype x environment interaction is seldom significant. The main factor affecting grain quality and flour production is the time of storage, while freezing has very limited effects. The traditional air-drying and natural storage is adequate for flour production, although not for maintaining viable seed. An additional <b>forced</b> <b>drying</b> reduces moisture and grain damage.

The diffusion constant of this film, measured with a 60 000 cS PDMS sample spreading on a hydrophilic silicon wafer, is Df = 1. 4  10 - 11 m 2 /s. Regardless of their size, density and method of deposition, droplets on both types of wafer (hydrophilic and hydrophobic) flatten out over a period of many hours, up to 3 days. During this process neighbouring droplets may coalesce, but there is strong evidence that some of the PDMS from the droplets migrates into a thin, continuous film that covers the surface in between droplets. The thin film appears to be ubiquitous if there has been any deposition of PDMS. However, this statement needs further verification. One question is whether the film forms immediately after <b>forced</b> <b>drying,</b> or whether in some or all cases it only forms by spreading from isolated droplets as they slowly flatten out. ...|$|E

For this reason a hybrid dryer consisting of a solar flat plate collector, a biomass heater and a drying chamber is designed and fabricated. 40 kg of Cashew nut with initial moisture of 9 % is used in the experiment. The performance test of the dryer is carried out in two modes of operation: hybrid-forced convection and hybrid-natural convection. Drying time and drying efficiency during these two modes of operation are estimated and compared with the sun drying. The system is capable of attaining drying temperature between 50 º and 70 ºC. In the hybrid <b>forced</b> <b>drying,</b> the required moisture content of 3 % is achieved within 7 hours and the average system efficiency is estimated as 5. 08 %. In the hybrid natural drying, the required moisture content is obtained in 9 hours and the average system efficiency is 3. 17 %. The fuel consumption during the drying process is 0. 5 kg/hr and 0. 75 kg/hr for forced mode and natural mode, respectively. The drying process in the hybrid forced mode of operation is twice faster than the sun drying. The dryer can be operated in any climatic conditions: as a solar dryer on normal sunny days, as a biomass dryer at night time and as a hybrid dryer on cloudy days. Based on the experimental study, it is concluded that the developed hybrid dryer is suitable for small scale cashew nut farmers in rural areas of developing countries...|$|E

Time span between harvest and energy conversion varied from 1 to 12 months. For a realistic comparison, different supply chains were based on the same initial characteristics (i. e., moisture content 50 % wb at harvest) and final fuel specifications at the energy plant (moisture content 20 % wb, particle size chips or chunks). Cost calculations were based on the integral cost calculation method and were presented for all process steps. The main conclusion was that the time span between harvest and energy conversion and the size and conversion technology of the energy plant largely influence the design of the supply chain and consequently the supply costs.

40|$|The {{research}} {{presented in}} this thesis is aimed to understanding the changes and the simulation of precipitation in Europe. A correct representation of simulated (trends in) European precipitation {{is important to have}} confidence in projections of future changes therein. These projections are relevant for different hydrological applications. Among others, simulated  changes of summer drying are often accompanied by an enhanced increase in air temperatures [Zampieri et al., 2009]. This can be expected to have large impacts on society and ecosystems, affecting, for example, water resources, agriculture and fire risk [Rowell, 2009]. Projections of changes in extreme precipitation are critical for estimates of future discharge extremes of large river basins, and changes in frequency of major flooding events [e. g. Kew et al., 2010]. The subjects that are studied in this thesis are divided in three parts: (1) evaluation of 20 th century European precipitation trends; (2) effect of general circulation model (GCM) spatial resolution on simulated western European winter precipitation in the current climate; and (3) effect of GCM spatial resolution on simulated future summer drying in central and southern Europe. In {{the first part of the}} thesis (chapters 2 and 3) an investigation of (extreme) precipitation trends in multi-model ensembles including both global and regional climate models is performed. The results show that these models fail to reproduce the observed trends over (parts of) the past century.   In many regions the model spread does not cover the trend in the observations: the models significantly underestimate the observed trend. A misrepresentation of large scale atmospheric circulation changes in climate models is found to be responsible for the underestimation of winter precipitation trends in Europe over the past century. Additionally, the underestimation of trends in winter precipitation extremes in the Rhine basin is directly related to this as well. In summer a misrepresentation of sea surface temperature (SST) trends is responsible for the underestimation of summer precipitation trends along the coastal regions of western Europe. The second part (chapter 4) investigates the effect of GCM spatial resolution on modeled precipitation over Europe using an atmosphere-only GCM at two resolutions (EC-Earth, ~ 25 km and ~ 112 km horizontal resolution). The results show that the high resolution model gives a more accurate representation of northern and central European winter precipitation. The medium resolution model has a larger positive bias in precipitation in most of the northern half of Europe. Storm tracks are better simulated in the high resolution model, providing for a more accurate horizontal moisture transport and precipitation. A decomposition of the precipitation difference between the medium- and high resolution model in a part related and a part unrelated to a difference in the distribution of vertical atmospheric velocity confirms that the reduced precipitation in the high resolution model is likely the result of a reduced moisture transport at this resolution: the precipitation difference in this area in unrelated to a difference in the distribution of vertical atmospheric velocity. In areas with orography the change in vertical velocity distribution is more important. Using the same atmosphere-only model, the third part (chapter 5) of this thesis  investigates  the influence of GCM spatial resolution on the simulated future summer drying of central Europe. High resolution models have a more realistic representation of circulation in the current climate and could provide more confidence on future projections of circulation <b>forced</b> <b>drying.</b> The results show that the high resolution model is characterized by a stronger drying in spring and summer, mainly forced by circulation changes. The initial spring drying intensifies the summer drying by a positive soil moisture feedback.

In current climate, these show the same precipitation difference pattern resulting from the summer circulation difference. In future climate the spring circulation plays a key role as well. It is concluded that the reduction of circulation biases due to increased resolution gives higher confidence in the strong drying trend projected for central Europe by the high-resolution version of the model.  ...|$|E

Due to lack of information, {{the objective of this}} study was to evaluate the influence of <b>forced</b> air <b>drying</b> at 40, 60, 80 and 100 °C and farmyard drying, in the mechanical properties of the beans, aiming to break the bean coat. Castor beans were subjected to compression tests, in two perpendicular directions, at a strain rate of 0. 6 mm. s- 1. Average values of force, deformation energy, strain, all at rupture, and stiffness were used to evaluate the effects of dehydration. It was observed that the heat treatments did not alter the mechanical properties of castor beans, the strain and stiffness values discriminate the differences between the directions and had the lowest coefficients of variation. It was concluded that <b>forced</b> air <b>drying,</b> more costly than farmyard drying, does not bring benefits to the decortication. However, regardless the heat treatment used, the mechanical stress lengthwise is the most suitable to promote decortication...|$|R
