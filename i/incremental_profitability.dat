5000|$|In {{a modern}} corporation, the CEO {{and other top}} {{executives}} are often paid salary plus short-term incentives or bonuses. This combination {{is referred to as}} Total Cash Compensation (TCC). Short-term incentives usually are formula-driven and have some performance criteria attached depending {{on the role of the}} executive. For example, the Sales Director's performance related bonus may be based on incremental revenue growth turnover; a CEO's could be based on <b>incremental</b> <b>profitability</b> and revenue growth. Bonuses are after-the-fact (not formula driven) and often discretionary. Executives may also be compensated with a mixture of cash and shares of the company which are almost always subject to vesting restrictions (a long-term incentive). To be considered a long-term incentive the measurement period must be in excess of one year (3-5 years is common). The vesting term refers to the period of time before the recipient has the right to transfer shares and realize value. Vesting can be based on time, performance or both. For example, a CEO might get 1 million in cash, and 1 million in company shares (and share buy options used). Vesting can occur in two ways: [...] "cliff vesting" [...] (vesting occurring on one date), and [...] "graded vesting" [...] (which occurs over a period of time) and which maybe [...] "uniform" [...] (e.g., 20% of the options vest each year for 5 years) or [...] "non-uniform" [...] (e.g., 20%, 30% and 50% of the options vest each year for the next three years).Other components of an executive compensation package may include such perks as generous retirement plans, health insurance, a chauffeured limousine, an executive jet, and interest-free loans for the purchase of housing.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{discusses}} the {{different forms of}} corporate divestitures, the motives for this corporate activity and the empirical findings about their economic outcomes. A sample of corporate divestitures {{is also used to}} identify the main motivations in the Singapore context. We conclude that divestitures are carried out to achieve operational efficiency, gain <b>incremental</b> <b>profitability</b> and liquidity. Using share price data around the event-dates, we show that announcements of divestitures generally lead to significant increases in the returns of the parent company. The positive abnormal returns are related to the relative size of the divestitures and the computed accounting gains. Overall, corporate divestiture is a value-increasing activity for Singapore companies...|$|E
40|$|This study {{examines}} {{the relevance of}} "Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 95 " operating cash flow disclosures for assessing a primary component of firm risk, namely credit risk. We find that "SFAS No. 95 " operating cash flows is an important determinant of credit risk, measured by debt ratings, <b>incremental</b> to other <b>profitability</b> and risk-related information. We also find that operating cash flows have a stronger incremental relation to credit risk for firms with {{a larger proportion of}} long-term debt and larger firms with lower operating uncertainty. Interestingly, cash flows appear to have less incremental importance for firms in high tech and regulated industries. Copyright Blackwell Publishers Ltd 2002. ...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 2017 Irrigated {{agriculture}} {{constitutes the}} greatest consumptive water use globally, so that irrigation efficiency measures {{are an important}} part of global efforts to best utilize this limited resource. However, greater irrigation efficiency must be achieved while simultaneously maintaining or increasing crop yields and farming <b>profitability.</b> <b>Incremental</b> water use decisions are made at the local level by farmers under many real world constraints; consequently they face significant risks in operating large and complex irrigation systems. These decisions should be supported by reliable information upon which to base operational plans and irrigation scheduling. Implementing precision irrigation effectively depends upon highly resolved estimates of crop water demand so that application rates match demand precisely both in location and timing. A fundamental challenge in mapping the irrigation requirement is addressing the heterogeneity of soil, biophysical, and atmospheric processes which mediate water demand. However, existing methods to determine the irrigation requirement assume that field conditions are homogeneous. Precision irrigation systems may enable more specific water distribution than traditional irrigation equipment, but allocating the correct amount of water requires crop water estimates that accurately reflect the variability of the irrigation requirement and consider the scale and timing at which irrigation can be delivered. This dissertation synthesizes the results from field studies which analyzed spatial patterns of irrigation performance and crop water demand under real field conditions. The first experiment quantified the performance of a precision irrigation system and determined the data resolution required for effective utilization of the system’s capability (Chapter 2). Field trials were conducted with a variable rate center pivot sprinkler (VRI) under normal farming conditions to determine this spatial resolution. The result was the definition of a performance coefficient and characteristic length scale associated with the irrigation system. The characteristic length scale describes the highest resolution prescription possible with VRI. Following on these findings, a second study compares an electromagnetic (EM) soil mapping method using extensive laboratory soil characterization as a basis for comparison (Chapter 3). The motivation of the study was to validate the EM method’s capability to detect small scale variations in soil water holding capacity, and to determine under which conditions the EM method can obtain reliable and robust soil maps. The findings reinforce earlier work on the importance of instrument calibration, and also show that specific soil characteristics may preclude using EM methods to map soil in some regions. Following the soil mapping study, further studies investigated methods to measure crop evapotranspiration (ET). A literature review was conducted to establish a catalog of contemporary methods to monitor ET, focusing on those commonly used in agriculture (Chapter 4). From this review, the surface renewal method (SR) emerged as potentially able to map ET feasibly and cost-effectively. Four field experiments were conducted over two years under a range of field conditions to establish a robust protocol for the determination of surface fluxes with SR (Chapter 5). Three of these experiments specifically investigated the potential for SR to be implemented from a moving sensor platform, such as an unmanned aerial vehicle. Experiments showed SR could estimate sensible heat flux as accurately as eddy covariance during moving trials. However, analysis of the minimum flux averaging period demonstrated that SR cannot resolve fluxes at the requisite spatial scales for precision irrigation. Nonetheless, SR remains promising for other practical applications in measuring surface fluxes. Future research questions and potential applications are explored in Chapters 5 and 6. The methods described here are directly relevant to water managers at the levels of farms and irrigation districts. Efficient irrigation planning depends on timely, reliable, and site-specific information in order to anticipate crop water demand, irrigate adequately to prevent drought stress, and maximize yield from the available resource. Growers and irrigation specialists currently have many resources at their disposal, including regional and satellite based ET estimates, state and local soil mapping, and scientific irrigation planning software. However, these methods do not provide site-specific and real time measurements of actual crop water demand, and farmers do not have any reliable means by which to validate the accuracy and precision of these estimates. For this information to be directly useful in irrigation planning, it should be validated by on site measurements. Reliable, local, and real time information is required to realize the full potential of precision agriculture...|$|R
40|$|Abstract__ This paper {{examines}} {{the association between}} ineffective internal control over financial reporting and the profitability of insider trading. We predict and find that the profitability of insider trading is significantly greater in firms disclosing material weaknesses in internal control relative to firms with effective control. The positive association {{is present in the}} years leading up to the disclosure of material weaknesses, but disappears after remediation of the internal control problems. We find insider trading profitability is even greater when insiders are more likely to act in their own self-interest as indicated by auditors’ weak “tone at the top” adverse internal control opinions and this <b>incremental</b> <b>profitability</b> is driven by insider selling. Our research identifies a new setting where shareholders are most at risk for wealth transfers via insider trading and highlights market consequences of weak “tone at the top”...|$|E
40|$|Firstly, {{the purpose}} of the {{empirical}} part of the study is to analyze the inventory balances of surveyed companies and secondly, to explore the dependence between companies’ level of inventory and profitability expressed in terms of return on assets. Thirdly, the aim of the theoretical research is to explore the cost and benefits from changes in the inventory level as well as to define variables that determine net savings from changes in inventory level. An optimal inventory level should be based on consideration of <b>incremental</b> <b>profitability</b> resulting from increased merchandise with the opportunity cost of carrying higher inventory balances. The results will provide a model equation for calculating net savings from changes in inventory level as well as a new mathematical optimization model. With this model a company can consider net earnings from changes in inventory level and establish the optimal inventory level as well as improve profitability...|$|E
40|$|Past {{empirical}} literature {{states that}} asymmetry in cross-price effect favors the large-share brand. That is, when large-share brands discount, {{they have a}} greater impact on small-share brands than the reverse. This conclusion is based on consideration of cross-price elasticities. This paper points out that focusing on cross-elasticities for measuring asymmetry is inappropriate for assessing <b>incremental</b> <b>profitability</b> from price promotions. Instead, we should investigate asymmetries in absolute cross-price effects (i. e., change in market share of a competing brand for a unit price change of the focal brand). We theoretically and empirically demonstrate that asymmetry reverses when absolute cross-price effect is considered. That is, the absolute cross-price effect of a price reduction of a lower-share brand on the market share of a higher-share brand is greater than the reverse. The general intuition is that a small-share brand has a greater pool of consumers to draw from when it discounts than does a large-share brand. The implications of the findings and future research directions are discussed. ...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to find {{obstacles}} and incentives in the adoption process of innovations. Only process innovations that can be used in construction are focussed upon here. The construction firm is described as an intermediate firm. A crucial objective for this type of firm is to develop its capacity to implement new solutions in order to be able to produce a lot of different types of buildings. The firm must be good at adopting innovations and the key person in the adoption process is the site manager. The adoption process is described by a model with four phases; knowledge, persuasion, decision and implementation. The factors that have an impact on the process can be in the environment, the construction firm, the innovation and the adopter. The study is carried out mainly in three sub-projects. Two series of interviews have been used. Although these interviews are mainly with site managers there are also some with their subordinates and their superiors. Finally, there is a questionnaire with responses from 89 site managers in the Gothenburg region. All of these managers are specialized in house construction. The study showed that the site manager is the key person in the adoption process and that this process is a part of the problem solving process on the site. New technology is mostly used as a way of solving current construction problems. The development primarily takes place in small steps, that is the adopted innovations are mainly <b>incremental.</b> <b>Profitability</b> of radical innovations is difficult to calculate. The economic risk is a significant factor. A construction firm is very much a project orientated, and decentralized firm with a short-term planning horizon. These facts combined with the fact that the adoption process takes a long time lead to great difficulty in adopting radical innovations...|$|E
40|$|Rising {{incomes and}} {{changing}} dietary requirements are swiftly transforming maize (Zea mays L) in Southeast Asia from a food staple into an important industrial commodity. Increased maize production {{is required to}} meet rising demands, but additional production should come from the sustainable intensification of existing farmlands to minimize the undesirable effects of agriculture on the environment. We hypothesize that maize yields, profit, and N use efficiencies can be significantly increased through site-specific nutrient management (SSNM), thereby reducing yield gaps in the region. Through a combined approach of simulation modeling and on-farm research in at least 65 sites in 13 major maize-producing domains across Indonesia, Vietnam and the Philippines from 2004 to 2008, {{we were able to}} (a) quantify maize yield gaps and yield responses to fertilizer application, (b) evaluate the agronomic and economic performance of SSNM, and (c) evaluate the <b>incremental</b> <b>profitability</b> of SSNM in various production and grain and fertilizer price scenarios. The average exploitable yield gap between the attainable yield and current farmers’ yield in Southeast Asia was about 0. 9 t ha− 1. Yield responses to fertilizer application across the region followed the order N > >P > K. Yield response to N was higher in irrigated sites than in rainfed sites (6 t ha− 1 versus 2 t ha− 1), while P and K fertilizer responses were similar across production systems (< 2 t ha− 1). Yield with SSNM was 1. 0 t ha− 1 (+ 13 %) higher than the current farmers’ fertilizer practice (FFP) measured in the same cropping seasons. Yield increases were associated with a 10 % decrease in the average N rate, but with increased application of K at sites where the previous K rates were low. Average N use efficiency increased by 42 %, mainly by adjusting the rates and timing of N application to the stages of crop development. Across all sites and seasons, profitability increased by US$ 167 ha− 1 per crop, which was equivalent to 15 % of the total average net return. Opportunities for achieving higher income over the FFP (≥US$ 100 ha− 1 season) were greatest in highly favorable rainfed environments; less favorable rainfed areas were vulnerable to unfavorable market prices. We conclude that SSNM has the potential to close existing yield gaps in the maize production systems of Southeast Asia by improving yield, nutrient use efficiency, and profitability...|$|E
