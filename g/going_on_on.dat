The lyrics deal with being completely intoxicated at a party. The opening lyric [...] "A RedOne" [...] {{has often been}} misinterpreted as [...] "red wine" [...] but in actuality is a reference to producer RedOne.|$|E
500|$|Burnham, Ingram and Gooding {{reached the}} Shangani about 08:00, but quickly {{saw that the}} water had risen far too high for Forbes to provide any assistance. Realising the {{futility}} of turning back to Wilson without help, they decided to rejoin Forbes anyway, and to that end traversed the swollen river with considerable difficulty. They then rode to where the battle on the southern side was still <b>going</b> <b>on.</b> <b>On</b> reaching the main column shaken and out of breath, Burnham leapt from his horse and ran to Forbes: [...] "I think I may {{say that we are}} the sole survivors of that party," [...] he quietly confided, before loading his rifle and joining the skirmish.|$|E
500|$|Lyrically, {{the songs}} on The Fame talk about being famous and {{achieving}} popularity; [...] "Poker Face" [...] is about sexual innuendo and teasing. Gaga explained {{in an interview with}} the Daily Star that the lyrics carry a bit of an undertone of confusion about love and sex. According to the BBC, the [...] "Mum-mum-mum-mah" [...] hook used in the song is copied from Boney M's 1977 hit [...] "Ma Baker". [...] "Just Dance" [...] talks about being intoxicated in a party, with lyrics like [...] "What's <b>going</b> <b>on</b> <b>on</b> the floor? / I love this record, baby but I can't see straight anymore". [...] "LoveGame" [...] portrays a message about love, fame and sexuality which is akin to the central theme of album. [...] "Paparazzi" [...] portrays a stalker who is following somebody being his or her biggest fan. The lyrics also portray the desire of capturing the attention of the camera as well as achieving fame. Gaga explained that, ...|$|E

500|$|The album {{includes}} one acoustic song, [...] "Hero of War", {{which is}} about an Iraq War Veteran looking back on his war experiences. It is described by Rolling Stone as an [...] "ambivalent aggro-folk track". McIlrath said of the song, [...] "I {{wanted to take the}} perspective [...] of 'What is the war going to be looked back on as?'" [...] In another interview McIlrath stated, [...] "It was a way to document what's going on, like other artists documented for their generation and for generations to come." [...] He went on to say, [...] "There are not many songs...talking about what's going on during eight years of occupation in Iraq. That, combined with meeting active soldiers and retired soldiers at our shows and hearing those stories about what is <b>going</b> <b>on</b> <b>on</b> the ground amid all the bullshit, showed me the differences from what is really happening to {{what is happening in the}} news media.

He is among the first to be quarantined along with his wife. Due to his medical expertise he has a certain authority among those quarantined. Much of this really comes from his wife not having gone blind; she is able to see what is <b>going</b> <b>on</b> <b>on</b> the ward and relay this to her husband. When the group from his ward finally escapes they end up travelling to and staying in the doctor and his wife's apartment.

2500|$|The task of coaling {{was still}} <b>going</b> <b>on</b> <b>on</b> 26 August, when the British cruiser [...] appeared. Reymann quickly {{prepared}} his ship and crew for battle and steamed out {{to engage the}} enemy after disembarking his prisoners of war. A fierce battle took place, but came to a dramatic end when Kaiser Wilhelm der Grosse ran out of ammunition. According to the Germans, rather than let the enemy capture the onetime pride of Germany, Reymann ordered the ship to be scuttled using dynamite, which was already in position should this situation ever arise. On detonation, the explosives tore a massive hole in the ship, causing her to capsize. This version of events was disputed by the British, who stated that Kaiser Wilhelm der Grosse had been badly damaged and sinking when Reymann ordered it to be abandoned. The British firmly {{believed that it was}} gunfire from HMS Highflyer which sank the German ship. Reymann managed to swim to shore, and he made his way back to Germany by working as a stoker on a neutral vessel. (Most of the crew were taken prisoner and held in the Amherst Internment Camp in Nova Scotia {{for the remainder of the}} war.) ...|$|E
2500|$|Greg Vaughan, who had {{recently}} been let go from his role as Diego Guittierez on The Young and the Restless, was cast shortly thereafter and first appeared on February 20, 2003. Vaughan later described his screen test to Soap Opera Digest: [...] "I {{was a little bit}} intimidated. I knew about the character, the foundation of the story. I knew it was a difficult task that I was about to take on." [...] In July 2009, Vaughan denied rumors that he was being let go or put on recurring status. That September, ABC announced that Vaughan had decided to leave to explore other opportunities, and that Jackson would be reprising the role. However, Vaughan announced via Twitter that it was the network that decided to let him go. Jackson stated upon returning: [...] "It was a tough situation. I was not under any sort of headspace that someone was losing their job; it was that the role was opening up. (...) It was more of a confusing thing for me coming back and not knowing exactly what was <b>going</b> <b>on,</b> <b>on</b> the other end of things." [...] Vaughan last aired on October 20, 2009, while Jackson first aired on October 27, 2009.|$|E
2500|$|Spanbauer {{moved to}} New York City in 1983 {{and entered the}} Columbia University Writing Program. Spanbauer {{took a job as}} an {{apartment}} building supervisor in the East Village, and began abusing alcohol and taking cocaine. He began writing The Man Who Fell in Love with the Moon in 1987, and by 1988 was deep into the manuscript. [...] The writing process was a very difficult one for Spanbauer. [...] He had so little money that he lived like [...] "a subway rat, pale and frail, trying hard to believe in" [...] the novel he was writing. He later said, [...] "A lot of the stuff I came up with was pretty fearsome, facing some personal devils head-on. I couldn't distinguish between the world and the book. At one point, I was so stressed out, I passed out in Penn Station." [...] As he told the Seattle Post-Intelligencer after the book's publication, [...] "It's all a matter of trust. You're {{right in the middle of}} this story. [...] You don't know the end of it. It's this preposterous tale about these preposterous people, and you don't know what's going to happen next, and you're tired of eating chicken livers and fettuccine, and you're alone in this little square concrete apartment, there's no air or earth, and pretty soon it was hard for me to distinguish what was going on in my head and what was <b>going</b> <b>on</b> <b>on</b> the outside."

2500|$|Eerie, Indiana {{was well}} {{received}} by critics when it debuted on television. Entertainment Weekly {{gave it a}} [...] "B" [...] rating and Ken Tucker wrote, [...] "You watch Eerie for the small-screen spectacle of it all — to see the way, in the show's first few weeks, feature-film directors like Joe Dante (Gremlins) and Tim Hunter (River's Edge) oversaw episodes that summoned up an atmosphere of absurdist suburban dread." [...] In his review for The Hollywood Reporter, Miles Beller wrote, [...] "Scripted by Karl Schaefer and José Rivera with smart, sharp insights; slyly directed by feature film helmsman Joe Dante; and given edgy life by the show's winning cast, Eerie, Indiana shapes up {{as one of the}} fall season's standouts, a newcomer that has the fresh, bracing look of Edward Scissorhands and scores as a clever, wry presentation well worth watching." [...] In his review for the Orange County Register, Ray Richmond wrote, [...] "It's the kind of knowingly hip series with equally strong appeal for both kids and adults, the kind that preteens will watch and discuss." [...] USA Today described the show as [...] "Stephen King by way of The Simpsons", and Matt Roush wrote, [...] "Eerie recalls Edward Scissorhands and even – heaven help it – David Lynch in its garish nightmare-comedy depiction of the lurid and silly horrors that lurk beneath suburban conformity." [...] In his review for the Washington Times, David Klinghoffer wrote, [...] "Everything about the pilot exceeds the normal minimal expectations of TV. Mr. Dante directs as if he were making a movie, and a good one. In a departure from usual TV operating procedures, he sometimes actually has more than one thing <b>going</b> <b>on</b> <b>on</b> screen at the same time!" ...|$|E
