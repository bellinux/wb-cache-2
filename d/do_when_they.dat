5|$|In 1911, sensing {{they were}} close to {{achieving}} suffrage, Rathbone & Stewart-Bright created Municipal Women's Association as {{a branch of the}} society; its aim was to increase awareness of the vote for women, encourage discussion amongst potential women voters and teaching women what to <b>do</b> <b>when</b> <b>they</b> had the vote. In 1912, the Liverpool Women Suffrage Society disagreed with the route that the National Union Women's Suffrage Societies was taking, with its Election Fighting Fund, and instead merged with the Municipal Women's Association to become the Liverpool Women's Citizen's Association. The outbreak of World War I changed the focus of groups to help with the national emergency and in 1919 the groups merged. By 1921 they had 12 branches.|$|E

25|$|When asleep, {{a person}} is unable to make {{judgments}} as they <b>do</b> <b>when</b> <b>they</b> are awake Due to the senses not functioning normally during sleep, {{they are unable to}} help a person judge what is happening in their dream. This in turn leads the person to believe the dream is real. Dreams may be absurd in nature but the senses are not able to discern whether they are real or not. So, the dreamer is left to accept the dream because they lack the choice to judge it.|$|E
25|$|The {{group on}} the pier was a rusty one — men and women, and boys and girls, all ragged, and barefoot, uncombed and unclean, and by instinct, education, and profession, beggars.

We walked up the middle of the {{principal}} street, and these vermin surrounded us on all sides, and glared upon us; and every moment excited couples shot ahead of the procession to get a good look back, just as village boys <b>do</b> <b>when</b> <b>they</b> accompany the elephant on his advertising trip from street to street.|$|E
25|$|During sleep, {{a person}} is in an altered state of mind. Aristotle compares a {{sleeping}} person {{to a person who}} is overtaken by strong feelings toward a stimulus. For example, a person who has a strong infatuation with someone may begin to think they see that person everywhere because they are so overtaken by their feelings. When {{a person is}} asleep, their senses are not acting as they <b>do</b> <b>when</b> <b>they</b> are awake and this results in them thinking like a person who is influenced by strong feelings. Since a person sleeping is in this suggestible state, they become easily deceived by what appears in their dreams.|$|E

25|$|When emigrating, scout P. fraternus wasps {{lead the}} whole pack of wasps {{to the site}} in a swarm cloud that is about 2 to 4 meters wide and 3 meters tall. After landing on the new nest site, the scouts usually brushed antennas {{with each other and}} put their {{mouthparts}} on the new substrate. Then, they perform gaster dragging and flight looping behaviors to signify that they have arrived at the new nest site. These behaviors are usually repeated many times. Nest construction generally begins shortly afterwards with combs and peduncles being built. Old pulp from the previous nest site is used to construct the new nest. Scout wasps then return to the old nest to attempt to activate inactive wasps to depart by dragging and shaking their gasters and initiating mouth contact. After these interactions with scouts, the previously inactive wasps begin flying around and depart within a few minutes. Males often do not follow the swarm because they are not able to follow the swarm emigration trail. P. fraternus does not form clusters along the emigration route like some other species <b>do</b> <b>when</b> <b>they</b> emigrate. During an emigration, some worker wasps morph into the role of scouts.|$|E

500|$|Soderbergh {{decided to}} omit the post-revolution {{execution}} sentences of [...] "suspected war criminals, traitors and informants" [...] that Guevara reviewed at La Cabana Fortress because [...] "there is {{no amount of}} accumulated barbarity that would have satisfied the people who hate him". Soderbergh addressed the criticism for this omission in a post release interview where he stated: [...] "I don't think anybody now, even in Cuba, is going to sit {{with a straight face}} and defend the events. La Cabana was really turned into a Roman circus, where I think even the people in power look back on that as excessive. However, every regime, in order to retain power when it feels threatened, acts excessively ... This is what people <b>do</b> <b>when</b> <b>they</b> feel they need to act in an extreme way to secure themselves". The filmmaker noted as well that, [...] "with a character this complicated, you’re {{going to have a very}} polarized reaction". Furthermore, he was not interested in depicting Guevara's life as [...] "a bureaucrat", stating that he was making a diptych about two military campaigns, declaring the pictures [...] "war films".

I was interested in making a procedural about guerrilla warfare".|$|E
