40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages 83 - 85) Today???s Mechanical Engineering {{field is}} growing rapidly in designing techniques to manufacture Splines and Gears. Over the decades, numerous methods and manufacturing processes {{have been used}} in making the various kinds of Splines based on various criteria, including applications, reliability, life time, processing time and manufacturing cost. This thesis is also carried out with the same notion of experimenting to manufacture an External <b>Involute</b> <b>Spline</b> cutting tool using state-of-art CAD/CAM package and current trend CNC machines like Brother HS- 70 A Wire Electrical Discharge Machine and HAAS VF- 2 Vertical Milling Machine. This thesis is divided into two distinct phases: (1) analysis phase and (2) manufacturing phase. The analysis phase is dedicated to the study and simulation of involute splines, while the manufacturing phase covers the actual manufacturing process. This thesis starts with the extensive study of splines and the two different kinds of splines; a) Internal Involute splines and b) External Involute splines. The primary objective is to design the internal <b>involute</b> <b>spline</b> in Dassault Systems??? SolidWorks??. This entire design process is to be automated with embedding Microsoft EXCEL Spreadsheet with SolidWorks. Using this EXCEL spreadsheet, spline design parameters iterations are carried out in SolidWorks with the help of design tables. Based on the calculations made in EXCEL Spreadsheets and CAD design in SolidWorks, CNC machining parameters are defined in DP Technology???s CAM package ESPRIT and the machining process as well as tool/insert design is simulated. The main objective is to manufacture a spline cutting tool using Wire EDM machining process. For this Solid Carbide Machine Inserts are chosen as a cutting tool which cuts the external splines. Once the machine insert was manufactured, it was tested on 6061 Aluminum test specimen and successfully cut on 4340 Steel Drive shaft on the CNC Milling machine. These external splines are the inverse of the Involute splines on the drive shaft hub of the FSAE Formula one car. It can be concluded that, the <b>involute</b> <b>spline</b> cutting tool was successfully manufactured and tested by cutting external involute splines on drive shaft which match with internal splines on drive hub...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Spline shaft {{is widely}} used {{as one of the}} {{important}} parts in machinery. Cold rolling process is currently the main processing method to small module splines. For the spline with position requirements, that is: one of the spline tooth is located at an angle of the spline shaft cross section, cold rolling processing can't guarantee the spline tooth position. The paper analyzes the defects existed in the rolling and processing of this kind of spline. Through transforming a hydraulic press and design special frock clamp to ensure the spline tooth position angle, the small modulus <b>involute</b> <b>spline</b> processing with position requirements is realized in the way of punch press processing...|$|E

Cold rolling process is currently the main processing mode for small module splines, but the special machine is too expensive. This article describes how to achieve a small modulus spline cold rubbing process by transforming an existing thread rolling machine while without buying the expensive special machine.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to investigate the position of the resultant force in <b>involute</b> <b>spline</b> coupling teeth due to the contact pressure distribution for both ideal and misaligned conditions. In general, spline coupling teeth are in contact all along the involute profile and the load is far from uniform along the contact line. Theoretical models available in publications consider the resultant contact force as it is applied at the pitch diameter, and this study aims to evaluate the error introduced within the confines of a common approximation environment. This analysis is carried out through using finite element method (FEM) models, considering spline couplings in both ideal and misaligned conditions. Results show that the differences between the load application diameter and pitch diameter are not very obvious in both ideal and misaligned conditions; however, this approximation becomes more important for the calculation of the tooth stiffnes...|$|E
40|$|In spline couplings, torque is {{theoretically}} {{transmitted by}} all teeth, supporting the same loading level. In practice, due to manufacturing and mounting errors, not all teeth transmit {{the same amount}} of torque and as a result an overloading condition may occur. In traditional design practice, this uneven load sharing between teeth is often neglected or taken into account by means of a simplified approach. In this article, a theoretical method, non-finite element method based, is developed in order to determine both exact number of engaging teeth and shared forces in <b>involute</b> <b>spline</b> couplings with parallel offset errors. The described process consists of an iterative procedure, in which algorithm is divided into three main modules: the first one aims to calculate geometrical parameters, the second one analytically determines both deformation and stiffness of teeth and the third one calculates the actual number of engaging teeth and the shared load. The algorithm has been benchmarked against finite element method results, showing a very good agreemen...|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} reduce wear and design {{high-performance}} spline coupling, the friction coefficient, wear coefficient, and wear depth of 14 groups of material specimens were tested using multifunctional friction and wear tester. The effect of materials, loads, rotation speed, and surface treatment on friction coefficient, wear coefficient, and wear depth was investigated. A method using an Archardâs equation based on the finite element method to calculate the wear depth of 14 groups of material specimens was proposed, {{and the results were}} consistent with the experimental results. Then, the wear of a floating <b>involute</b> <b>spline</b> coupling of aero-engine was predicted using this method. It can be concluded that carburizing and silvering can decrease the friction coefficient. The wear and wear coefficient decreased after carburizing. So, it is necessary to take 18 CrNi 4 A with carburization and 32 Cr 3 MoVA with nitridation as the material of the spline coupling in aero-engine to minimize wear. Furthermore, the method presented to predicate the wear of spline coupling in this work provided a good fundament for the fatigue prediction methodology of spline coupling...|$|E
40|$|In the {{spline rolling}} process with round dies, {{additional}} kinematic compensation {{is an essential}} mechanism for improving the division of teeth and pitch accuracy as well as surface quality. The motion characteristic between the die and workpiece under varied center distance in the spline rolling process was investigated. Mathematical models of the instantaneous center of rotation, transmission ratio, and centrodes in the rolling process were established. The models were {{used to analyze the}} rolling process of the <b>involute</b> <b>spline</b> with circular dedendum, and the results indicated that (1) with the reduction in the center distance, the instantaneous center moves toward workpiece, and the transmission ratio increases at first and then decreases; (2) the variations in the instantaneous center and transmission ratio are discontinuous, presenting an interruption when the involute flank begins to be formed; (3) the change in transmission ratio at the forming stage of the workpiece with the involute flank can be negligible; and (4) the centrode of the workpiece is an Archimedes line whose polar radius reduces, and the centrode of the rolling die is similar to Archimedes line when the workpiece is with the involute flank...|$|E
40|$|Residual {{stress is}} an {{important}} parameter {{in the evaluation of}} the performance of a cold rolling spline surface. However, research on cold rolling spline is rare. To improve the surface property of a spline, an <b>involute</b> <b>spline</b> is selected as the object of this study. The contour method for determining cold roll-beating residual stress involves measuring the force spatial distribution, performing a statistical analysis of the experimental results, establishing the parameters for the tooth profile for different positions (dedendum, pitch, and addendum) of residual stress, and determining the effect of pressure on the relationship between stress and the depth of the cold roll-beating. A response surface method is used to establish the spline tooth profile of the dedendum, pitch, and addendum of the residual stress and different depths of the stress layer to obtain the parameters of a multiple regression model and perform a comparative analysis of the experimental and prediction results. Research indicates that the prediction results have high reliability. The establishment of this model has important guiding significance to control the residual stress in the cold roll-beating forming process, optimize the cold roll-beating processing parameters, and improve the surface properties of cold rolling spline...|$|E
