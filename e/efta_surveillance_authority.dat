5|$|By October 2007, Vildanden was {{in severe}} {{financial}} distress. An agreement {{was made with}} the municipal council, where the latter gave a credit loan to the airline. The route to Molde had given large deficits, and the company was forced to close it down. NOK2.3 million, equal to the airlines debt to the airport, was granted to the municipal-owned airport operator, and the company allowed to make an agreement where half the debt was deleted, {{and the other half}} made interest and principal-free for two years. At the same time, the management of Vildanden had to raise new capital equal to at least half the companies accounts payable, which was NOK8 million. The case raised local debate about whether it was the municipality's job to subsidize the airport and the airline. The Federation of Norwegian Aviation Industries announced that they would consider reporting the subsidies to the <b>EFTA</b> <b>Surveillance</b> <b>Authority</b> (ESA) for violation of the European Community competition law.|$|E
2500|$|In September 2013 the Norwegian Parliament approved, {{as part of}} {{the revised}} 2014 budget, an {{exemption}} from the 25% VAT for leasing electric vehicles effective on 1 January 2014. However, , the exemption has not gone into effect because the Minister of Finance decided to defer the measure, pending a formal consultation with the <b>EFTA</b> <b>Surveillance</b> <b>Authority</b> (ESA) to ensure that the VAT exemption for leasing was not in violation of the European Economic Area Agreement. The government's loss of revenue due to the still not implemented leasing exemption is estimated at about 47 million krone (around [...] ) per year. One Member of Parliament has criticized the government for the delay. He had argued that the initial VAT exemption for all electric vehicles was never approved in ESA. In addition, an ESA spokesman confirmed that the Government has not sent any request , nor has ESA received any complaints about Norway's original EV tax exemption. The MP said he will demand that the decision be implemented when Parliament meets in October 2014.|$|E

40|$|For several years, {{states have}} grappled {{with the problem}} of {{cyberbullying}} and its sometimes devastating effects. Because cyberbullying often occurs between students, most states have understandably looked to schools to help address the problem. To that end, schools in forty-six states have the authority to intervene when students engage in cyberbullying. This solution seems all to the good unless a close examination of the cyberbullying laws and their implications is made. This Article explores some of the problematic implications of the cyberbullying laws. More specifically, it focuses on how the cyberbullying laws allow schools unprecedented <b>surveillance</b> <b>authority</b> over students. This authority stands in notably stark contrast to the constraints on government authority in other contexts, including police authority to search cell phones. In June 2014, the Supreme Court recognized in Riley v. California that police searches of cell phones require a warrant because of the particular intrusions into privacy attendant to those searches. While some <b>surveillance</b> <b>authority</b> over students may be warranted, the majority of the cyberbullying laws implicitly give schools unlimited, or nearly unlimited, and unfettered <b>surveillance</b> <b>authority</b> over students 2 ̆ 7 online and electronic activity whenever, wherever, and however it occurs: at home, in bedrooms, at the mall, on personal cell phones, on tablets, or on laptops This Article argues that the cyberbullying laws, though well meaning, vastly expand school authority through the broad, if implicit, allowance of <b>surveillance</b> <b>authority</b> over students and implicate privacy harms that are made more acute because the authority lies with schools over students. Although no doctrine yet exists on the limits of school <b>surveillance</b> <b>authority,</b> limits on school authority in other contexts do exist. First and Fourth Amendment doctrine in student-speech and search cases, as well as doctrine on government surveillance more generally, offers some guidance on where the boundaries of school <b>authority</b> lie. The <b>surveillance</b> <b>authority</b> in most cyberbullying laws goes beyond these bounds, indicating that cyberbullying laws expand school authority. To protect students from excessive school <b>surveillance</b> <b>authority</b> and attendant privacy harms, realistic limits need to be imposed on school <b>surveillance</b> <b>authority</b> under the cyberbullying laws both by way of a framework for determining the boundaries of school authority and a cause of action for students. This Article calls for both and draws on the nexus doctrine in First Amendment student-speech cases to develop such a framework...|$|R
