5000|$|Foam {{leveling}} uses {{closed cell}} polymer expanding foam in an injection process. A two part polymer (example, components A and B [...] is injected {{through a hole}} less than one inch in diameter, typically 5/8." [...] Although the material is injected at a higher psi rate than traditional cementitious grouts, the pressure is not what causes the lifting. The expansion of the air bubbles in the injected material below the slab surface performs the actual lifting action as the liquid resin reacts and becomes a structural foam. Material injected below a slab to be lifted will first find weak soils, expanding into them {{in such a manner}} as to consolidate and cause sub-soils to become more dense and fill any voids below the slab. One inherent property of expanding foams is that they will follow the path of least resistance, expanding in all directions. Another inherent property includes reaching a hydro-insensitive or hydrophobic state when cured with 100% cure times as little as 30 minutes. Closed cell polymer foams offer benefits that go beyond the goal of leveling hard surfaces. They will not retain moisture, which in northern climates can cause frost heaving. They are not subject to erosion once in place. Their <b>fast</b> <b>cure</b> time allows for immediate use when application is complete. Their light weight, 3 to 8 lbs. per cubic ft. vs. 100 to 120 lbs. per cubic ft. for cementitious grout will not cause further settlement. Foams will retain their cured shape and volume indefinitely reducing the possibility of new voids forming below grade to nearly zero unless acted upon by some outside cause. Some closed cell polymer foams have baseline lifting capabilities of 6,000 lbs per sq. ft. and leveling procedures have been performed in which loads as high as 125 tons have been lifted and stabilized in a surface area of less than 900 sq. ft.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this work}} was to {{determine}} the bond tensile strength of a polycarbonate sandwich joined with a fast cured epoxy adhesive. A 6. 5 kW single mode microwave unit operating at 2. 5 GHz was used to <b>fast</b> <b>cure</b> the epoxy adhesive. The samples of polycarbonate were prepared in accordance with ASTM D 2095 - 72 (modified) and glued with a two-part epoxy adhesive mix employing a doping agent for rapid cure in the microwave unit. Two operational parameters, cure time, microwave power and one processing parameter, dopant concentration, were varied to determine their effect on the resulting bond strength. These rapidly-cured samples were then tensile tested to determine the joint strength {{as a function of the}} operational and processing parameters. The fracture surfaces of the adhesively joined polycarbonate samples were examined using light microscopy and scanning electron microscopy. A polariscope was employed to determine the variation in stress in the adhesive joint. Conventional curing of epoxy adhesive polycarbonate sandwiches was also undertaken.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this research was}} to provide a useful approach of polymer synthesis for accelerating the <b>fast</b> <b>cure</b> of phenol-urea-formaldehyde (PUF) resin as wood adhesive by optimizing its structure and composition. The PUF resins containing high contents of very reactive groups such as para-methylol groups were synthesized by reacting methylolurea, phenol, and formaldehyde in the presence of magnesium oxide (MgO) as catalyst. The effects of synthesis parameters including F/(P + U), OH/P, and MgO/P mole ratios on the structure, composition, curing characteristics, and their relationships of PUF resins were investigated. The results indicated that MgO seemed to be an efficacious catalyst for PUF resin synthesis and promote its faster cure. The increase in the F/(P + U) mole ratio or/and OH/P mole ratio appeared to be beneficial for the formation of para-methylol groups and cocondensed methylene linkages between phenolic methylol groups and urea units, and for the removal of unreacted urea. In case of Catalyst/P mole ratio, an appropriate dosage of added metal-ion was very important for synthesizing the high-content reactive groups of PUF resins, otherwise leading to the reverse effects...|$|E

The resins performance as wood adhesives was further established from lap-shear tests and microscopic observation of the bondline. Resins prepared with highly reactive aldehydes, such as formaldehyde or glyoxal, exhibited a significant extent of hetero-condensation reactions, <b>fast</b> <b>cure</b> kinetics, a high storage modulus and good solvent stability of the stage C-resin.

Several studies show that rapid manufacturing moulds obtained in epoxy resins for Thermoplastic Injection Moulding (TIM) affect the moulding process and the final properties of parts.

In contrast, the low conductivity of materials usually applied for the rapid manufacturing of RIM moulds, increase the mechanical properties of final injected parts and reduce the cycle time. This study shows the effect of the rapid manufacturing moulds material during the RIM process.

In this paper, the current situation of control and prevention of water and mud inrush is summarized and recent advances in relevant theories, grout/equipment, and critical techniques are introduced. The time-variant equations of grout viscosity at different volumetric ratios were obtained based on the constitutive relation of typical <b>fast</b> <b>curing</b> grouts. A large-scale dynamic grouting model testing system (4000  mm ×  2000  mm ×  5  mm) was developed, and the diffusions of cement and <b>fast</b> <b>curing</b> grouts in dynamic water grouting were investigated.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Curing {{characteristics}} of thick composite parts {{have long been}} {{known to be a}} function of thickness and location within the parts. While cure state as a function of thickness has often been modeled, actual experimental verification has been difficult. In this work, disposable and permanently mounted dielectric sensors were used to characterize the cure in polyester sheet molding compound at various locations through the thickness of the part in a simulated molding environment. Using established tech-niques, the dielectric and temperature information were combined to yield local cure state information for each sensor. Parts under five millimeters thick were found to cure rather uniformly, while parts greater than this had increasing degrees of nonuniformity in cure behavior through the thickness. Cure time differences of up to three minutes, between center and edge, were observed in parts 20 millimeters thick. These observed cure state data are compared to finite difference model predictions. The model simulations show that in thick parts, a cure "wave " develops, starting at the SMC/mold interface and proceeds {{toward the center of the}} part. The "wave " increases in velocity as it moves toward the center of the part. The overall effect is that a relatively uniform cure rate is observed at the SMC/mold interface while in the middle of the SMC part, a long induction period occurs, followed by an extremely <b>fast</b> <b>cure.</b> The model predictions, which are confirmed by the sensor cure data, may be used to predict the behavior and molding cycle time required for new parts during the design process...|$|E

In this study, JEDEC level 3 moisture sensitivity preconditioning followed by thermal cycling (TCB,- 55 oC~ 125 oC) was conducted. Two reflowable underfill mainly differentiated by curing kinetics and adhesion strength, namely Underfill A and Underfill C, were evaluated. Failure analysis was carried out via C-SAM and cross section. Unit failure that was electrically identified in present study was defined as occurrence of bridging and/or open circuit. The results showed that for packages assembled with Underfill A that has superior adhesion with silicon nitride passivation, all units can pass preconditioning but bridging commenced to appear at 750 cycles. Open circuitry was encountered between 1750 and 2000 cycles. While for Underfill C with <b>fast</b> <b>cure</b> characteristics and relatively weaker adhesion compared to Underfill A, bridging and open circuitry started to surface at 500 and 1250 cycles, respectively. Failure analysis indicated that bridging mainly resulted from solder bump extrusion through micro voids trapped between adjacent bumps during assembly process; meanwhile the gap between neighboring bumps {{is too close to}} prevent convergence of two extruded bumps. Open circuitry is originated by several factors such as insufficient wetting, underfill delamination, die crack, underfill crack etc. On the whole, no underfill delamination and die crack have been observed before 1000 cycles in present study. Most importantly, no solder crack that is the direct reflection of CTE mismatch has been observed throughout the whole reliability test. This fact suggests that assemblies with relatively-higher-CTE reflowable underfill still can meet general reliability standard...|$|E
