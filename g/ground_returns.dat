After returning to the UK, Bowen's earlier observation about differences in <b>ground</b> <b>returns</b> noticed in early experiments led Philip Dee to develop a prototype ground mapping system in March of 1941, a development that would evolve into the H2S radar.|$|E
25|$|This testing also {{demonstrated}} two unexpected and ultimately very useful {{features of the}} spiral scan system. The first was that since the scanning pattern crossed the ground when the antenna was pointed down, the <b>ground</b> <b>returns</b> produced a series of curved stripes along the lower portion of the display. This formed an analogue of an artificial horizon, one that radar operators found extremely useful in combat because they could immediately see if the pilot was responding correctly to their commands. Various {{members of the team}} record having been surprised by this outcome, noting that the effect was obvious in retrospect and should have been predicted.|$|E
25|$|The other {{surprise}} was that <b>ground</b> <b>returns</b> caused a false signal that always {{appeared at the}} same range as the aircraft's current altitude, no matter where the dish was pointed. This was {{in much the same}} fashion as the Mk. IV, but in this case, the signal was much smaller whenever the dish was not pointed down. Instead of a wall of noise at the range of the aircraft's altitude, the signal caused a faint ring, leaving targets on either side visible. The ring was initially very wide, caused by returns not only directly under the aircraft but further away as well. After several months of work, Hodgkin and Edwards managed to provide a tuning control that muted down the weaker signals, leaving a sharp ring indicating the aircraft altitude. This too was a useful indicator for the operators, as they could see they were at the same altitude as their target when the ring overlapped the target blip.|$|E

25|$|Lovell {{continued}} {{his work on}} the production antenna design using klystrons and wrapped up this work on 22 July. The team then began adapting the various bits of equipment to work together as a single radar unit based on the magnetron. J. R. Atkinson and W. E. Burcham, both sent to the AIS team from the Cavendish Laboratory at University of Cambridge, produced a pulsed power source, and Skinner and A. G. Ward, also from Cavendish, worked on a receiver. At the time the team had no solution to switching the antenna from transmit to receive, so they initially used two antennas side-by-side, one on the transmitter and one on the receiver. On 8 August they were experimenting with this setup when they received a signal from a nearby fishing hut. With the antenna still pointed in the same direction, they accidentally detected an aircraft which flew by the site at 6pm on 12 August. The next day, Dee, Watt and Rowe were on hand, but with no convenient aircraft available the team instead demonstrated the system by detecting the returns from a tin sheet being held by someone bicycling across a nearby cliff. With this demonstration of the radar's ability to reject <b>ground</b> <b>returns</b> and detect targets at basically zero altitude, interest in the 1.5m systems began to wane.|$|E
500|$|Due to {{the wide}} pattern of the {{transmission}} antenna, some of the signal always hit the ground, reflecting some of it back at the aircraft to cause a ground return. This was so powerful that it was received {{on all of the}} antennas, even the upper vertical receiver which would otherwise be hidden from signals below it. As the shortest distance, and thus the strongest signal, was received from reflections directly below the aircraft, this caused a strong blip to appear across all the displays at the range of the fighter's altitude. The ground further in front of the aircraft also caused returns, but these were increasingly distant (see slant range) and only some of the signal was reflected back at the aircraft while an increasing portion was scattered forward and away. <b>Ground</b> <b>returns</b> at further distances were thus smaller, resulting in a roughly triangular series of lines at the top or right side of the displays, known as the [...] "Christmas tree effect", beyond which {{it was not possible to}} see targets.|$|E

40|$|The {{knowledge}} of <b>ground</b> <b>return</b> current in fault occurrence {{plays a key}} role in the dimensioning of the earthing grid of substations and of cable sealing end compounds, in the computation of rise of earth potential at substation sites and in electromagnetic interference (EMI) on neighbouring parallel metallic conductors (pipes, handrails, etc.). Moreover, the <b>ground</b> <b>return</b> current evaluation is also important in steady-state regime since this stray current can be responsible for EMI and also for alternating current (AC) corrosion. In fault situations and under some assumptions, the <b>ground</b> <b>return</b> current value at a substation site can be computed by means of k-factors. The paper shows that these simplified and approximated approaches have a lot of limitations and only multiconductor analysis can show the <b>ground</b> <b>return</b> current behaviour along the cable (not only the two end values) both in steady-state regime and in short circuit occurrence (e. g., phase-to-ground and phase-to-phase-to-ground). Multiconductor cell analysis (MCA) considers the cable system in its real asymmetry without simplified and approximated hypotheses. The sensitivity of <b>ground</b> <b>return</b> current on circuit parameters (cross-bonding box resistances, substation earthing resistances, soil resistivity) is presented in the paper...|$|R
