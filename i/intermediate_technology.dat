5|$|In {{parts of}} the world which lack a high level of infrastructure, {{ambulances}} are designed to meet local conditions, being built using <b>intermediate</b> <b>technology.</b> Ambulances can also be trailers, which are pulled by bicycles, motorcycles, tractors, or animals. Animal-powered ambulances can be particularly useful in regions that are subject to flooding. Motorcycles fitted with sidecars (or motorcycle ambulances) are also used, though they are subject to some of the same limitations as more traditional over-the-road ambulances. The level of care provided by these ambulances varies between merely providing transport to a medical clinic to providing on-scene and continuing care during transport.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} the e¤ects of an intermittent technology on long-run incentives for investment in non-renewable electricity generation technologies. I …nd {{conditions under which}} supporting an intermittent technology may in fact increase carbon emissions. The variability of load usually determines the long run mix of generating technologies in a competitive electricity market. When there is a signi…cant amount of intermittent production the mix of other generating technologies {{is determined by the}} variability of net load (load net of intermittent output). Net load may be more variable than load itself if the intermittent output is not too positively correlated with load. This increase in variability results in a substitution away from baseload generating technologies towards peaking and <b>intermediate</b> <b>technologies.</b> If peaking and <b>intermediate</b> <b>technologies</b> are more carbon intensive than non-renewable "baseload " technologies, this substitution can more than o¤set the emission bene…ts derived from the output of the renewable technology. ...|$|R
2500|$|Ernst Friedrich [...] "Fritz" [...] Schumacher (19 August 1911 – 4 September 1977) was a German {{statistician}} and {{economist who}} {{is best known}} for his proposals for human-scale, decentralised and appropriate technologies.

2500|$|In 1955 Schumacher {{travelled}} to Burma as {{an economic}} consultant. While there, he developed the set of principles he called [...] "Buddhist economics", {{based on the belief}} that individuals need good work for proper human development. He also proclaimed that [...] "production from local resources for local needs is the most rational way of economic life." [...] He travelled throughout many Third World countries, encouraging local governments to create self-reliant economies. Schumacher's experience led him to become a pioneer of what is now called appropriate technology: user-friendly and ecologically suitable technology applicable to the scale of the community; a concept very close to Ivan Illich's conviviality. He founded the <b>Intermediate</b> <b>Technology</b> Development Group (now Practical Action) in 1966. His theories of development have been summed up for many in catch phrases such as [...] "intermediate size", and [...] "intermediate technology". He was a trustee of Scott Bader Commonwealth and in 1970 the president of the Soil Association.|$|E

The trade-off between a signaling effect and an expropriation effect determines the technology-sharing incentives. In equilibrium at most one firm shares some of its technologies. For similar technology distributions, there exists an equilibrium in which nobody shares.

40|$|This paper {{seeks to}} analyze {{changes in the}} {{technical}} division of labour of Taiwanese automotive parts, and die and mould manufacturers in China using empirical data from a 2010 survey conducted in Kunshan.

The division of labour of automobile parts and dies and moulds appear to show firms in Japan and Taiwan enjoying cutting edge and <b>intermediate</b> <b>technologies,</b> while those in China are characterized by low end technology.

40|$|The microeconomic {{empirical}} literature {{devoted to}} the link between innovation and employment tends to suggest that technological change has {{a positive effect on}} jobs, at least {{at the level of the}} firm. The main purpose of this paper is to see whether this result still holds in a situation where <b>intermediate</b> <b>technologies</b> are implemented mainly through gross innovative investments, as in Italian manufacturing. Applying GMM-SYS to an employment equation augmented for technology and using a unique longitudinal dataset of 575 Italian manufacturing firms over the period 1992 - 1997, this paper finds a significant - although small in size - positive relationship between innovation and employment. While the links with sales and wages have the expected signs and turn out to be significant, the job creating impact of innovation proves robust after checking for time, industry, firm's size and geographical fixed effects...|$|R
40|$|Despite the {{proliferation}} of mobile communication technology and smartphone adoption, a number of barriers, most notably trust and security, {{and the lack of}} critical mass, have slowed the uptake of mobile payments (m-payments). Little is understood about the factors driving the success of novel, <b>intermediating</b> <b>technologies</b> such as m-payments, particularly in emerging markets. In this thesis, we empirically investigated the factors that affect the success of m-payments in Cape Town, from the merchant's perspective. The research model is based on the Perceived Characteristics of Innovation (PCI) instrument developed by Moore and Benbasat (1991) which measures an individual's perception of adopting m-payments. Our results found the main adoption drivers to be relative advantage, ease of use, results demonstrability, convenience, speed of transaction, and service provider brand value. The key barriers to adoption include cost as well as trust and security. Based on our findings, implications for practice and future studies are suggested...|$|R

The University of Nevada Las Vegas Center for Energy Research has developed a method for converting the common hydrocarbon fueled internal combustion engine to hydrogen direct injected fueling. This thesis describes the second phase of development and involves the design, fabrication and characterization of a spark plug/fuel injector assembly which will allow conversion to hydrogen direct injection fueling without disassembly/modification of internal engine components. Characterization of these assemblies includes response time testing of the solenoids used and flow rate testing of the assemblies at various pressures and operational frequencies...|$|R

40|$|Policies {{toward the}} {{diffusion}} of electric vehicles {{received a lot of}} attention in the latest years in many developed countries. Yet the real costs and benefits for society as a whole of this technology have received limited attention from economists. In this context, the present paper proposes a thorough cost benefit analysis of policies for the development of electric vehicles in Germany. It also reviews the main existing models of EV diffusion to shed light on the modeling issues underlying the evaluation of EV policies. Elaborating on a comprehensive simulation model, it shows that the potential for EV is fairly limited while there is more room for <b>intermediate</b> <b>technologies</b> like Plug-in Hybrid Vehicles and Range Extenders. The paper concludes that most of the investigated policies have a negative benefit-cost balance. These results are strongly driven by the regulatory framework in which EV diffusion could take place and especially the Car Average Fleet Emission regulation EU 44...|$|R
40|$|SMEs are a {{fundamental}} {{part of the}} economic fabric in developing countries and they {{play a crucial role}} in furthering growth, innovation and prosperity. In Zimbabwe, the SME sector has been reckoned by smallholders; farmers, miners etc. as it supplies <b>intermediate</b> <b>technologies</b> to resource-poor small scale players. This paper employs a stochastic frontier production function and technical inefficiency effects model to measure and explain the technical efficiency of informal metal fabricating firms in Zimbabwe. Analysis relied on cross-sectional firm level data from a survey conducted on informal metal fabricating SMEs between July 2012 and April 2013. Average technical efficiency was found to be low at 51. 1 %, indicating a high degree of technical inefficiency in the production process. Results also show that the production process is predominantly labor intensive. Moreover, technical inefficiency effects model reveals that age of firm, firm location, market information access, Information Communication Technology (ICT) use and experience are key factors contributing to firm technical efficiency.
