50|$|The MSS FPA, or Focal Plane Array {{consisted}} of 24 square optical fibers extruded down to 0.005 mm (0.0002 in) square fiber tips in a 4x6 array to be scanned across the Nimbus spacecraft path in a ±6 degree scan as the satellite {{was in a}} 1.5 hour polar orbit, hence it was launched from Vandenberg Air Force Base. The fiber optic bundle was embedded in a fiber optic plate to be terminated at a relay optic device that transmitted fiber end signal on into six photodiodes and 18 photomultiplier tubes that were arrayed across a 7.6 mm (0.30 in) thick aluminum tool plate, with sensor weight balanced vs the 230 mm telescope on opposite side. This main plate was assembled on a frame, then attached to the silver-loaded magnesium housing with <b>helicoil</b> fasteners.|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: to {{describe}} and evaluate a new intra‐articular approach {{for the treatment of}} cranial cruciate ligament insufficiency in dogs using an artificial ligament and new bone anchors. STUDY DESIGN: ex vivo study. ANIMALS: 12 canine cadavers, weighing 26 ‐ 45 kg. METHODS: a craniolateral approach was made to the stifle joint. An 8 mm hole was drilled in the tibia {{in the center of the}} insertion area of the cranial cruciate ligament. A <b>helicoil</b> with a modified tibial screw connected to an artificial ligament were inserted in the hole and the ligament was passed through the stifle in accordance with the “over‐the‐top” procedure. A second 8 mm tunnel was drilled in the distal femur and a <b>helicoil</b> and a modified femoral screw was inserted. The artificial ligament was inserted in the eyelet of the femoral screw, tensioned and fixed in place. After apposing the soft tissues, the cranial drawer sign and the cranial tibial thrust were tested and mediolateral and a craniocaudal projection radiographs were performed. RESULTS: post‐operative assessment showed a negative cranial drawer test and a negative cranial tibial thrust, with good limb alignment and a normal ROM of the stifle joint. The radiographic control showed correct insertion of both tibial and femoral implants in all cases. CONCLUSIONS: this novel technique did not require a long learning curve and these initial mechanical tests of the new implant are encouraging. Further studies are necessary to investigate the effectiveness of this procedure “in vivo”...|$|E

5000|$|The interstate's {{route through}} Phoenix was hotly contested in the 1960s, 1970s and early 1980s. A plan {{proposed}} by the Arizona Department of Transportation involved monstrous block-sized 270-degree [...] "helicoil" [...] interchanges at Third Avenue and Third Street that would connect motorists to freeway lanes 100 feet (30 m) in the air, but voters killed it in 1973 {{as a result of}} opposition from the Arizona Republic newspaper and a growing nationwide anti-freeway sentiment. Voters on election day were treated to a photo depiction {{on the front page of}} the newspaper that in later years was shown to have drastically-overstated the freeway's height, but there is no question the proposed viaducts and <b>helicoils</b> would have been a visual gash across central Phoenix.|$|R
40|$|In {{support of}} the Deep Space Habitat project a number of {{composite}} rack prototypes were developed, designed, fabricated and tested to various extents (with the International Standard Payload Rack configuration, or crew quarters, as a baseline). This paper focuses specifically on a composite rack prototype with a direct tie in to Space Station hardware. The outlined prototype is an all composite construction, excluding metallic fasteners, washers, and their associated inserts. The rack utilizes braided carbon composite tubing for the frame with the sidewalls, backwall and flooring sections utilizing aircraft grade composite honeycomb sandwich panels. Novel additively manufactured thermoplastic joints and tube inserts were also developed {{in support of this}} effort. Joint and tube insert screening tests were conducted at a preliminary level. The screening tests allowed for modification, and enhancement, of the fabrication and design approaches, which will be outlined. The initial joint tests did not include mechanical fasteners. Adhesives were utilized at the joint to composite tube interfaces, along with mechanical fasteners during final fabrication (thus creating a stronger joint than the adhesive only variant). In general the prototype was focused on a potential in-space assembly approach, or kit-of-parts construction concept, which would not necessarily require the inclusion of an adhesive in the joint regions. However, given the tie in to legacy Station hardware (and potential flight loads with imbedded hardware mass loadings), the rack was built as stiff and strong as possible. Preliminary torque down tests were also conducted to determine the feasibility of mounting the composite honeycomb panels to the composite tubing sections via the additively manufactured tube inserts. Additional fastener torque down tests were also conducted with inserts (<b>helicoils)</b> imbedded within the joints. Lessons learned are also included and discussed...|$|R
40|$|Student paper, EEB 4825, 2010 Northern pike, Esox lucius, are {{freshwater}} predatory North American fish renowned and {{beloved by}} anglers for their fierce fight and delicious filets. Pike are ambush hunters; light vertical stripes {{on a dark}} green background blend into vegetation in shallow, sunlit waters. Pike are most active at dawn and dusk, likely because their prey is as well. Pike survive best in cold, well-oxygenated mesotrophic lakes and often times won’t breed and even starve themselves if conditions are too warm. The objective {{of this study was}} to monitor the movements and activity levels of pike in Lake Itasca in north central Minnesota. Pike were chosen because their large body size and lack of predators negate the majority of the concerns that the encumberment and extra weight of a radio transmitter, whether it be internal or external. Internal transmitters with external whip antennas were used in preference of external transmitters and internal transmitters with encapsulated <b>helicoil</b> antennas because they would encumber the fish less. Whip antennas also provide more range, transmitting a strong signal into the water from any angle. A <b>helicoil</b> antenna projects its signal down the central axis of the coil, meaning the antenna would have to be pointed directly into the antenna coil, which could slow tracking by limiting the angles a fish can be located from. However, externally projecting antennas have been shown to collect algae and contribute to fish mortality at high temperatures (Ross & McCormick, 1981). To combat this, the water temperature in Lake Itasca averages 20 °C during the summer months, sufficiently slowing algal growth along the antenna...|$|E
40|$|The Z- 2 Prototype Planetary Extravehicular Space Suit Assembly is a {{continuation}} of NASA's Z series of spacesuits. The Z- 2 is another step in the NASA's technology development roadmap leading to human exploration of the Martian surface. To meet a more challenging set of requirements than previous suit systems standard design features, such as threaded inserts, have been re-analyzed and improved. NASA's Z- 2 prototype space suit contains several components fabricated from an advanced hybrid composite laminate consisting of IM 10 carbon fiber and fiber glass. One requirement NASA levied on the suit composites was the ability to have removable, replaceable <b>helicoil</b> inserts to which other suit components would be fastened. An approach utilizing bonded in inserts with helicoils inside of them was implemented. The design of the interface flanges of the composites allowed some of the inserts to be a "T" style insert that was installed through the entire thickness of the laminate. The flange portion of the insert provides a mechanical lock as a redundancy to the adhesive aiding in the pullout load that the insert can withstand. In some locations {{it was not possible to}} utilize at "T" style insert and a blind insert was used instead. These inserts rely completely on the bond strength of the adhesive to resist pullout. It was determined during the design of the suit that the inserts did not need to withstand loads induced from pressure cycling but instead tension induced from torqueing the screws to bolt on hardware which creates a much higher stress on them. Bolt tension is determined by dividing the torque on the screw by a k value multiplied by the thread diameter of the bolt. The k value is a factor that accounts for friction in the system. A common value used for k for a non-lubricated screw is 0. 2. The k value can go down by as much as 0. 1 if the screw is lubricated which means for the same torque, a much larger tension could be placed on the bolt and insert. This paper summarizes testing that was performed to determine a k value for <b>helicoil</b> inserts in the Z 2 suit and how the insert design was modified to resist a higher pull out tension...|$|E

During initial assembly, cracking sounds were heard followed by the lifting {{of one of the}} blind inserts out of its hole when the screws were torqued. A failure investigation was initiated to understand the mechanism of the failure. Ultimately, it was determined that the pre-tension caused by torqueing the fasteners is a much larger force than induced from the pressure loads of the suit which was not considered in the insert design.
