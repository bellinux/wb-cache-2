However, food may play a minor role in respiratory allergy, and allergy to food may contribute to respiratory symptoms by increasing bronchial hyperresponsiveness. In this study, we examined serum levels of specific IgE antibodies to <b>food</b> <b>allergens</b> and inhalant allergens in bronchial asthma patients. Rice, wheat, soybean, corn and potato were selected as <b>food</b> <b>allergens</b> in this study.

40|$|Purpose of review: This review {{discusses}} the inhalational route as a clinically important {{route of exposure}} to <b>food</b> <b>allergens.</b> Recent findings: In childhood, we have recently demonstrated that <b>food</b> <b>allergens</b> can induce both early and late phase bronchial reactions within blinded, placebo-controlled challenges. Additionally, clinically important levels of <b>food</b> <b>allergens</b> have been measured in environmental air samples. Summary: It {{is well known that}} the ingestion of <b>food</b> <b>allergens</b> frequently causes respiratory symptoms and that the mechanism of death in fatal anaphylaxis is usually profound bronchospasm. The mechanism by which ingested <b>food</b> <b>allergens</b> induce bronchial reactions is unclear. There are many case reports of bronchial reactions to aerosolized <b>food</b> <b>allergens.</b> Within the <b>food</b> industry the problems have been examined more systematically. From such work it is possible to gain an impression of the potential prevalence of the problem. With 10 % of adult asthma being occupational and 10 % of occupational asthma being induced by aerosolized food, inhalational exposure to <b>food</b> <b>allergens</b> {{plays a major role in}} at least 1 % of adult asthma. For a patient with co-existent food allergy and asthma it is important that both dietary and environmental avoidance be practised. The similar pathophysiology of allergic and occupational asthma and the ability of inhaled <b>food</b> <b>allergens</b> to cause the latter raises the question as to whether aerosolized food could play a role in the pathogenesis of childhood asthma...|$|R

40|$|Non-specific lipid {{transfer}} proteins (nsLTPs) {{have recently}} been identified as plant <b>food</b> <b>allergens.</b> They are good examples of true <b>food</b> <b>allergens,</b> {{in the sense that}} they are capable of sensitizing, i. e. inducing specific IgE, as well as of eliciting severe symptoms.

The basis of the difference between the latter category and strong <b>food</b> <b>allergens</b> such as nsLTPs appears to lie in the sensitivity of the allergens to proteolytic attack and food processing.

50|$|Food allergy is principally {{diagnosed}} by careful {{history and}} examination.

However false positive results occur when using the SPT when diagnosis of a particular <b>food</b> <b>allergen</b> is hard to determine.
