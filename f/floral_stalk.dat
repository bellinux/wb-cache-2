40|$|Oreina cacaliae (Schrank) (Coleoptera: Chrysomelidae) has a 2 -year {{life cycle}} {{that it has}} to {{complete}} within the short warm seasons of the harsh alpine environment. Three years of field observations and experiments revealed that not all beetles overwintered in the soil next to their principal host Adenostyles alliariae (Asteraceae), as was previously assumed, but that many O. cacaliae left their host in autumn and flew to overwintering sites that were extensively sun-exposed. In spring, these individuals became active 2 months earlier than their conspecifics that had remained in the soil close to the host plant. These early beetles flew from their hibernation sites against the direction of the prevailing wind. After a random landing in snow, they walked to the spring host Petasites paradoxus (Asteraceae) and fed on its <b>floral</b> <b>stalks,</b> the only plant parts present at that time. A few weeks later, they took flight again to locate newly emerging A. alliariae on which they would feed and deposit larvae as did individuals that had overwintered close to A. alliariae. Leaves of A. alliariae contain pyrrolizidine alkaloids (PAs), which the beetles sequester for their own defence. The dominating PA (seneciphylline) was also found to be present in the <b>floral</b> <b>stalks</b> of P. paradoxus. With additional behavioural assays in the field and laboratory, we demonstrated the importance of plant odours in the short-range host location process. This study reveals a unique hibernation behaviour in which part of the beetle population uses exceptionally warm locations from which they emerge in spring, long before all the snow has melted. This early, but risky emergence allows them to exploit a second, highly suitable host plant, which they locate first by wind-guided flight and then by odour-guided walking. The well-fed beetles then use odour again to move to their principal host plant, on which they reproduce...|$|R

Over a 28 -year period, 67 <b>floral</b> <b>stalk</b> remains were observed. The highest flowering index was recorded in lepidochronological year 1998 (10. 1 %) and the Inflorescence Frequency per age showed a clear decrease corresponding to 15 -year-old shoots. The sexual reproductive event had positive effects on rhizome elongation (cm year− 1) and leaf production (no. leaves year− 1) in the same flowering year, whilst no effect on the rhizome production (mg year− 1) was observed. Rhizome growth variables showed significant negative lagged responses in the two years following flowering. On the whole, we calculated that the effect exerted by flowering, in terms of loss on rhizome elongation and production, was about 27 % and 38 %, respectively. Although it has been demonstrated that recovery from the stress induced by sexual reproduction is limited to the two years after flowering, the magnitude of the reproductive cost may become quite considerable especially in comparison with the whole lifespan of individual shoots...|$|E

Despite both lignins are of HGS-type, strong structural differences were observed between them. Thus, DL(FS) showed almost twice the abundance of H and G units and almost half of the abundance of S units when compared to DLR. DLR possessed significantly higher amount of beta-O- 4 ' structures (0. 32 /C(6) against 0. 12 /C(6)) and the molecular weight (5400 Da against 3750 Da) than those of DL(FS).

40|$|Hypothesis: The {{optimum height}} of an {{inflorescence}} {{is expected to}} be the result of costs and benefits for the plant, where the benefit is pollination and the costs are herbivory and allometric growth. Thus, plants with more resources will have taller flower stalks, will provide a greater reward to pollinators, and will be preferred by pollinators. However, in populations subject to stronger herbivory, mean stalk height will be shorter. Organism: We studied populations of a hysteranthous and tall-stalked geophyte, the Negev desert lily (Pancratium sickenbergeri), subject to varying levels of herbivory by dorcas gazelles (Gazella dorcas). Field site: Sandy habitats in Makhtesh Katan and Makhtesh Ramon, in the Negev Desert, Israel. Methods: We measured the survival and frequency distribution of <b>floral</b> <b>stalk</b> height, bulb size and condition (by artificially simulating bulb herbivory), pollinator preference, rewards for the pollinators (pollen grains per plant and the energetic value of the nectar per flower), and fruit and seed production. We then compared stalk height between populations and correlated stalk height, pollen and nectar, and seed production. Results: Lilies in populations with high herbivory produced shorter inflorescences than in populations with low herbivory. The condition of the bulb affected stalk production, but not its height or seed production. The pollinator preference results were inconclusive. Taller inflorescences produced more rewards for pollinators. We observed variability in fruit and seed production due to the size of the flower stalk and this variability differed among the populations with different levels of herbivory...|$|E
50|$|Xylocopa species nest in dead wood, <b>floral</b> <b>stalks,</b> and bamboo stalks. Species are {{adaptable}} due {{to their}} ability to survive in various temperatures and nest in a variety of substrates. carpenter bees construct two main types of nests. First, they create unbranched or linear nests with tunnels that go in opposite directions from the entrance. The nests consist of hollow plant material that these bees take advantage of. The second type of nests the Xylocopa have are branched nests constructed of tree trunks or timber. Interestingly, the type of nests can influence schedule of brood production. In linear nests, there is a limited time-window available for cell provisioning; as a result, the youngest brood must be strong enough to withstand older bees crawling over them/stealing resources. Because the younger brood are in danger of having shorter life spans in the linear nests, this concept of provisioning is called the “ticking clock”. In contrast, branched nests are constructed within separate tunnels, which allows brood provisioning and development to occur without time restraint.|$|R

We monitored biogas production from six morphological parts (MPs) of the "Williams Cavendish" banana cultivar using a modified operating procedure (KOP) using KOH. Volatile fatty acid (VFA) production was measured using high performance liquid chromatography. The bulbs, leaf sheaths, petioles-midribs, leaf blades, rachis stems, and <b>floral</b> <b>stalks</b> gave total biogas production of 256, 205, 198, 126, 253, and 221  ml g- 1 dry matter, respectively, and total biomethane production of 150, 141, 127, 98, 162, and 144  ml g- 1, respectively. The biogas production rates and yields depended on the biochemical composition of the BALICEBIOM {{and the ability of}} anaerobic microbes to access fermentable substrates. There {{were no significant differences between}} the biogas analysis results produced using KOP and gas chromatography. Acetate was the major VFA in all the MP sample culture media. The bioconversion yields for each MP were below 50  %, showing that these substrates were not fully biodegraded after 188  days.

40|$|A yeast mutant lacking SHR 3, {{a protein}} {{specifically}} required for correct targeting of plasma membrane amino acid permeases, {{was used to}} study the targeting of plant transporters and {{as a tool to}} isolate new SHR 3 -independent amino acid transporters. For this purpose, an shr 3 mutant was transformed with an Arabidopsis cDNA library. Thirty-four clones were capable of growth under selective conditions, but none showed homology with SHR 3. However, genes encoding eight different amino acid transporters belonging to three different transporter families were isolated. Five of these are members of the general amino acid permease (AAP) gene family, one {{is a member of the}} NTR family, encoding an oligopeptide transporter, and two belong to a new class of transporter genes. A functional analysis of the latter two genes revealed that they encode specific proline transporters (ProT) that are distantly related to the AAP gene family. ProT 1 was found to be expressed in all organs, but highest levels were found in roots, stems, and flowers. Expression in flowers was highest in the <b>floral</b> <b>stalk</b> phloem that enters the carpels and was downregulated after fertilization, indicating a specific role in supplying the ovules with proline. ProT 2 transcripts were found ubiquitously throughout the plant, but expression was strongly induced under water or salt stress, implying that ProT 2 plays an important role in nitrogen distribution during water stress, unlike members of the AAP gene family whose expression was repressed under the same conditions. These results corroborate the general finding that under water stress, amino acid export is impaired whereas proline export is increased...|$|E
