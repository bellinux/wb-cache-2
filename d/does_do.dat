500|$|In 1973, The Village Voice writer Terry Guerin said Cosby {{was past}} his prime. Among the reasons, [...] "making {{spokesman}} commercials for such established heels as White Owl cigars and Pan American airlines. He {{has evolved into}} a kind of self-parodying sap, the kind of flagrant, perpetual parader Sammy Davis has always been". [...] "The Noble Cos," [...] a 1986 satirical editorial by Edward Sorel for The Nation, was written in Cosby's imagined voice. It echoed the comments of other authors that Cosby had become out-of-touch with lower-class African Americans. In response to this sentiment, Cosby said in 1997, [...] "So this buddy says, 'I didn't mind your commercials for Jello, Del Monte, Ford cars... Ideal Toys, or Coca-Cola, although Coke <b>does</b> <b>do</b> business in South Africa... But, Bill, why do commercials for those crooks at E. F. Hutton?'

500|$|The {{authors of}} the book I Can't Believe It's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide, Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood, gave the episode a {{positive}} review, and wrote that it was [...] "A magnificent end to the season." [...] They wrote that the episode was [...] "thoroughly racist" [...] but [...] "completely inoffensive because it's simply very funny." [...] Jake MacNeill of Digital Entertainment News was also favourable, considering it {{to be one of}} the better episodes of the season. James Plath of DVD Town wrote that the episode has [...] "some funny moments." [...] Aaron Roxby of Collider was more critical, denouncing the episode's dated references. He wrote: [...] "I am going to go ahead and give this one the benefit of the doubt and assume that making fun of Japanese junk culture and game shows felt fresher in 1999 than it <b>does</b> <b>do</b> now." [...] Colin Jacobson of DVD Movie Guide called the episode [...] "mediocre". He wrote that, though the episode's concept should [...] "open up lots of interesting possibilities", it [...] "doesn't explore them particularly well". While he did not consider it to be a bad episode, he thought it [...] "fail to live up to its potential".|$|E

500|$|A {{number of}} reviews praised Elite Forces {{gameplay}} and level design. The battles were described by GameSpot as [...] "particularly intense", enhanced by friendly non-player characters being [...] "surprisingly responsive" [...] in combat, giving the player {{the sense that}} they are [...] "not doing all the fighting by [...] ". While GameSpy voiced the view that Elite Force does not deviate radically from other games in the genre, it stated that [...] "what it <b>does</b> <b>do,</b> it does extremely well". Admiring the game's pacing, GameSpy noted that the use of periods with character interaction rather than combat helped prevent the game becoming a [...] "continuous onslaught" [...] and allowed the story to flow smoothly, a point echoed by GameSpot. However, both GameSpot and GameSpy were critical of the game's artificial intelligence in some circumstances, leading friendly characters {{to get in the way}} of the player during firefights. IGN was impressed with the variety of gameplay, from finding solutions to problems in coordination with other characters, engaging in stealth missions and pursuing a wide selection of objectives within the individual missions. Several reviewers were complimentary towards the design of the weapons in the game, commenting that they were powerful and fun to use as well as fitting for the Star Trek theme.|$|E
500|$|The caps {{of young}} {{mushrooms}} are initially egg-shaped to conical, expanding to become [...] bell-shaped {{and up to}} 2cm (0.8in) in diameter. Initially, {{the margin of the}} cap is rolled inwards; it typically assumes a lighter color than the centre of the cap surface. Dark brown in color, the mushroom is distinguished by the presence of white speckles or scales on the cap and stem; these scales may disappear when they become sloughed off or washed away by rain, which can make the species hard to recognise. The thick gills have an adnate attachment to the stem (broadly attached to the stem slightly above the bottom of the gill, with most of the gill fused to the stem), and are white to light grey in colour, paler toward the edge. There are about 24–28 gills extending completely from the cap margin to the stem, and one or two tiers of lamellulae (shorter gills <b>does</b> <b>do</b> not extend fully from the margin to the stem). The thin stem is up to 4cm (1.6in) high and 0.3cm (0.12in) wide, and does not have a ring. Young specimens will typically have whitish scales at the base; later, these will slough off and a felt-like whitish mycelium may be apparent. The mushroom have no distinctive odour. The spore print is white or cream. The edibility of the mushroom has not been reported.|$|E
500|$|... "The Man from Jupiter" [...] {{was widely}} lauded by {{television}} commentators. In his A- review, Todd VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club {{felt that the}} episode contained many great moments and {{felt that it was}} a strong opening for the season. VanDerWerff wrote: [...] "Archer has always been a show I enjoyed more for the fast-paced dialogue and weird office plots, but every so often, the show does something pretty awesome, even on what's probably a fairly limited budget, and it turns out an action sequence that you just won't see on most other animated shows. FX has usually chosen to open seasons with these big action episodes, for fairly obvious reasons, and this one has the added benefit of Burt Reynolds hanging out as another potential ratings bump." [...] VanDerWerff noted that the storyline between Sterling Archer and his mother Malory Archer was the highlight of [...] "The Man from Jupiter"; [...] "Archer's so often at odds with her because he's unable to see her as a person and not just his mother, as Reynolds expresses while roaring down the highway at dangerously high speeds. Until Archer accepts that Malory has needs—some of them sexual—he’s always going to be trapped in a weird, co-dependent relationship with her. Archer isn't a show that tries to shove tons and tons of deep character moments into its episodes, which makes it all the better when it <b>does</b> <b>do</b> so. The show usually nails those little moments, and this was no exception." [...] Creative Loafing journalist Scott Harrel asserted, [...] "If the debut episode is any indication, you can expect another satisfying season from this intelligent, imaginative and button-pushing mix of high and low humor." [...] Ross Bonaime of Paste issued the installment an 8.8 out of ten rating, signifying a [...] "commendable" [...] rating. Bonaime affirmed that Reed adequately developed the characters, citing that [...] "The Man from Jupiter" [...] further established greater expectations for the series.|$|E

2500|$|The film pokes fun at revolutionary {{groups and}} 1970s British left-wing politics. [...] "What the film <b>does</b> <b>do</b> is place modern {{stereotypes}} {{in a historical}} setting, which enables it to indulge {{in a number of}} sharp digs, particularly at trade unionists and guerilla organisations". The groups in the film all oppose the Roman occupation of Judea, but fall into the familiar pattern of intense competition among factions that appears, to an outsider, to be over ideological distinctions so small as to be invisible, thus portraying the phenomenon of the narcissism of small differences.

2500|$|John Molyneux {{explains}} {{in his article}} Emin Matters, that her work revolves around class, sex and art itself. He writes that, [...] "What she <b>does</b> <b>do</b> is present herself as culturally working class…She makes no attempt to engage in 'intellectual art speak' but sticks to unaffected everyday language," [...] employing a strategy that doesn't place her in authority over her viewers or peers. However, her class background contradicts this tactic of equal understanding. Emin's mother until age seven owned a hotel in Margate, but bankruptcy and poverty ensued only when she broke up with Emin's father. While she may use street language, swear words, grammatical errors and misspellings to convey a primarily middle-class female experience, Emin now functions as a boss of her own art business and exists within the elite upper class. Her relationship with sex is a major theme and aspect of her work. Feminist writers have reviewed Emin's pieces as containing, [...] "…no element of eroticism or titillation…unlike in Botticelli, Renoir or Klimt. Nor is it sexual fantasy or dreams, as we might find in surrealism, or {{the sex of the}} brothel featured so heavily in late 19th-century French art. It is real, everyday sex—as experienced by her, of course, but also by millions of other people".|$|E

Placed side-by-side, players would be somewhat hard pressed to guess which game was the newer release." [...] He was critical of the lack of differentiation between the game and its predecessor, arguing [...] "it feels more like an expansion than a true sequel. If you've played the first game, Ties That Bind simply feels like more of the same." [...] However, he concluded [...] "The Suffering: Ties That Bind is a solid action title that should satisfy fans of the original game. Although the game doesn't bring a lot of new experiences to the table, it <b>does</b> <b>do</b> a great job of adding to the experience gamers enjoyed the first time around." [...] Scott Osborne scored the PC version 3 out of 5, writing [...] "the gameplay feels stuck in the past, like a rerun of the first game." [...] He was critical of the port, citing [...] "graphics glitches," [...] "problems loading saved games," [...] and game-breaking bugs. He concluded, [...] "The gameplay and locales aren't particularly exciting, yet the pacing is taut, and the story and acting are above par. Fans of the first game should enjoy learning more about Torque's clouded life, but if you're new to the series, you're probably better off picking up the original." ...|$|E
