30|$|Geothermal {{energy is}} renewable, {{environmentally}} friendly, and ubiquitous. Yet, {{only a tiny}} fraction of it is harnessed commercially for space heating or for electricity by conversion at some expense (Clauser 2006). The grade of all geothermal resources depends on the temperature difference between produced and re-injected water, the fluid flow rate and hence, reservoir rock permeability and porosity, and the amount of fluid saturation (Tester et al. 2006). For exploiting high-grade resources, it is desirable to access deeper parts of the Earth’s crust as rock temperature increases with depth. At the same time, decreasing rock permeability and exponentially increasing drilling costs with depth (Heidinger 2010) can render a <b>geothermal</b> <b>installation</b> uneconomical.|$|E
40|$|One of the European Union {{priorities}} is {{the promotion}} of electricity generated from renewable energy sources. This is due to reasons of security and diversification of energy supply, environmental protection, reducing external dependence of the European Union (EU) in its energy supply and economic and social cohesion. The members of the EU as a whole, constitute the major world power in what concerns the development and application of renewable energy. The Maastricht Treaty assigned the EU's objectives of promoting sustainable growth respecting the environment. Meanwhile the Treaty of Amsterdam incorporated the principle of sustainable development in {{the objectives of the}} EU. The price support system for renewable energy currently prevailing in the EU is the system Renewable Energy Feed-in Tariffs (REFIT). The geothermal energy is considered as one of these renewable energies, so, it gets benefits from this system. In the concrete case of Sweden, almost 40 % of the energy used is represented by the residential and services sector. So, to maximize the usage of renewable energy in these sectors is a priority for the country. In this way, low enthalpy geothermal energy is the easiest way of using geothermal energy in residential buildings. In this project it is studied a block of flats in N. Kungsgatan 37 - 43 (Gävle), whose heating and tap hot water system are handled by a geothermal heat pump combined with district heating. The system has been analysed because the consumption of electricity was higher than expected and this is a problem when the energy saving is the objective. For the analysis, different elements of the installation have been checked to verify if they are working correctly. For example, if the temperature sensors are giving properly information to the controlling system and the effectiveness of heat exchangers is the correct. The whole installation has also been carefully inspected with a thermal camera to check possible liquid or heat leakages in the machines room. Finally, after study the heat pump, the conclusion is that the problem is in the geothermal part of the heat pump, because the probes are not able to supply the required heat to the system. This is due to the <b>geothermal</b> <b>installation</b> was designed for another heat pump which was installed in the building some years ago.

Although small, these variations have important effects on the final calculation of the total borehole length either in heating or cooling conditions (Lh and Lc in Eqs.  5 and 6, respectively) due to changes of the Rb value.

A complete hydrochemical characterization of mine water is required to optimally design the <b>geothermal</b> <b>installation,</b> understand the hydraulic behavior of the water in the reservoir and prevent undesired effects such as pipe clogging via mineral precipitation. Water pumped from the Barredo-Figaredo mining reservoir (Asturias, NW Spain), which is currently exploited for geothermal use, has been studied and compared to water from a separate, nearby mountain mine and a river that receives mine water discharge and partially infiltrates into the mine workings. Although the hydrochemistry was altered during the flooding process, the deep mine waters are currently near neutral, net alkaline, high metal waters of Na-HCO 3 type. Isotopic values suggest that mine waters are closely related to modern meteoric water, and likely correspond to rapid infiltration. Suspended and dissolved solids, and particularly iron content, of mine water results in some scaling and partial clogging of heat exchangers, but water temperature is stable (22 °C) and increases with depth, so, considering the available flow (> 100 L s− 1), the Barredo-Figaredo mining reservoir represents a sustainable, long-term resource for geothermal use...|$|E

40|$|A {{vertical}} geothermal probe {{consists of}} four polyethylene tubes U-shaped, used for circulating the coolant between the heat pump and the ground. It is installed in a deep borehole and sealed in a special grout, a kind of liquid cement, used to seal the borehole, and avoid the presence of air bags between the probe and the ground. Moreover, the grout provides a heat transfer medium between the geothermal probe and surrounding. The main cost in a <b>geothermal</b> <b>installation</b> is drilling itself. Reducing the heat exchanger length, and thus reducing {{the depth of the}} borehole is an interesting solution to reduce the cost of the installation. The conventional cement grout has low thermal conductivity varying between 0, 8 and 1 W/m. K, which leads to high heat exchanger length. Increasing this thermal conductivity, permit the improvement the heat transfer between the soil and the probe, thus reducing the heat exchanger length. Laboratory studies were undertaken to determine the thermal conductivity of various grout mixture. Such as cementitious grout with bentonite, silica sand and graphite. A thermal modeling of the soil, the grout and the heat exchanger was conducted. Experimental results shows that thermal conductivity of the grout can be increased up to 4 W/m. K.

40|$|Rock Energy is a Norwegian {{company with}} a {{patented}} solution for drilling deep geothermal wells, for exploitation of deep geothermal energy from Hot Dry Rocks. The concept involves a drilled sub-surface heat exchanger, referred to as cross wells. The concept is well suited for production of heat for direct heat applications. In this thesis {{an analysis of the}} existing district heating plant at Oslo Airport Gardermoen has been conducted, together with examining possibilities of implementing geothermal energy as base load at the plant. A geothermal design that could {{meet the needs of the}} district heating plant has been established, and for evaluating the geothermal system in an environmental perspective an analysis based on LCA methodology has been conducted. Hafslund operates two district heating centrals at Gardermoen (Gardermoen heating central and a smaller mobile central) for which both have been analyzed to determine the potential for implementing deep geothermal energy as base load for the systems. Gardermoen heating central is connected to the airport and to the area close to the airport. This central is again connected to the mobile heating central, which is situated near the industrial estate south-east of the airport. Based on Hafslund s production data from February 2011 to January 2012, a heat load duration curve for the two existing centrals have been established. When adding the two curves together the duration curve show a maximum load of 25, 7 MW at present, and a yearly energy production of 74 GWh. The mobile central accounts for only 7, 2 % of the total load and heat production at present. Future heat demand in the Gardermoen area is expected to increase beyond existing capacity. Hafslund is therefore considering to increase the capacity of both their district heating centrals. The enlargement plans involves that the heating central will be expanded to a design load of 37, 4 MW (24 MW at present), while the mobile central need to be increased to a design load of 15, 2 MW (1, 7 MW at present). Assessment of the <b>geothermal</b> <b>installation</b> showed that it is preferable to include the geothermal system in the base load of the mobile central. The additional geothermal capacity will cover 10 MW, and thus deliver 65 % of the required heat load and 90 % of the energy production from the mobile central. The <b>geothermal</b> <b>installation</b> was designed using the spreadsheet Geocalc. The outputs from Geocalc are used in an analysis of the environmental performance of the designed system through a Life Cycle Assessment (LCA). LCA introduces a technique to assess environmental impacts associated with all stages of a product s life from cradle to grave. The report aims at giving normative results for the environmental impacts of a <b>geothermal</b> <b>installation</b> at Gardermoen. The method provides the ability to quantitatively compare results to other sources of heat provision processes for district heating. It is important to emphasize that the analysis has provided an overview of the potential environmental impact, and not necessarily the actual results of environmental consequences. The system analyzed has a thermal output of 10 MW, lifetime of 30 years, 5000 annual operating hours. The functional unit of district heating produced is kWh. The analysis is based on the main contributing processes to construction, operation and demolition of Rock Energy s geothermal system. The district heating grid is not included in the analysis, as it is already in place at the site. Each contributing process has been systematically validated. It is however uncertainties associated with the data collection mainly due to contradictory information gathered. The information considered to be mostly uncertain is the energy consumption used for drilling purposes. Possible scenarios for the energy supply to drilling were established. These scenarios were simulated in a system model in Excel. The model is based on data and information gathered from existing literature, the database Ecoinvent, published reports and personal communication with drilling experts and specialists within the relevant fields of study. The results are assessed for the following impact categories: Climate change, metal depletion, fossil depletion, terrestrial acidification and freshwater eutrophication. The evaluated potential energy sources for the drilling operation are electricity from the Norwegian grid, electricity from the European grid, and diesel. The climate change category has especially been in focus when conducting the simulations and this category shows large spread in the results, from 0, 9993 g CO 2 -eq/kWh for the best scenario to 23, 6 g CO 2 -eq/kWh for the worst scenario. As expected, the analysis concludes that electricity from the Norwegian grid for the drilling is preferable. For a geothermal system in Europe, the results show that it would be advantageous to use diesel as energy supply for the drilling operation instead of European electricity mix, for which the emissions are doubled. For the metal depletion impact category, the variation of energy supply to drilling cause the least fluctuation. This is also the only impact category where the Norwegian electricity mix has higher impacts than for the diesel consumption. This can be explained by the infrastructure related to electricity transmission. The results of the study have been compared to other heat sources for district heating (waste incineration, biofuel and solar thermal). The comparison shows that from an LCA perspective geothermal energy based on Rock Energy s concept is an environmentally friendly energy supplier for district heating. The studies compared are however based on varying assumptions, and thus a generalized conclusion cannot be drawn from this...|$|E
40|$|Experience {{is lacking}} with mineral scaling and {{corrosion}} in {{enhanced geothermal systems}} (EGS) in which surface water is circulated through hydraulically stimulated crystalline rocks. As an aid in designing EGS projects we have conducted multicomponent reactive-transport simulations to predict the likely characteristics of scales and corrosion that may form when exploiting heat from granitoid reservoir rocks at ∼ 200 °C and 5 km depth. The specifications of an EGS project at Basel, Switzerland, are used to constrain the model. The main water–rock reactions in the reservoir during hydraulic stimulation and the subsequent doublet operation were identified in a separate paper (Alt-Epping et al., 2013 b). Here we use the computed composition of the reservoir fluid to (1) predict mineral scaling in the injection and production wells, (2) evaluate methods of chemical geothermometry and (3) identify geochemical indicators of incipient corrosion. The envisaged heat extraction scheme ensures {{that even if the}} reservoir fluid is in equilibrium with quartz, cooling of the fluid will not induce saturation with respect to amorphous silica, thus eliminating the risk of silica scaling. However, the ascending fluid attains saturation with respect to crystalline aluminosilicates such as albite, microcline and chlorite, and possibly with respect to amorphous aluminosilicates. If no silica-bearing minerals precipitate upon ascent, reservoir temperatures can be predicted by classical formulations of silica geothermometry. In contrast, Na/K concentration ratios in the production fluid reflect steady-state conditions in the reservoir rather than albite–microcline equilibrium. Thus, even though igneous orthoclase is abundant in the reservoir and albite precipitates as a secondary phase, Na/K geothermometers fail to yield accurate temperatures. Anhydrite, which is present in fractures in the Basel reservoir, is predicted to dissolve during operation. This may lead to precipitation of pyrite and, at high exposure of anhydrite to the circulating fluid, of hematite scaling in the <b>geothermal</b> <b>installation.</b> In general, incipient corrosion of the casing can be detected at the production wellhead through an increase in H 2 (aq) and the enhanced precipitation of Fe-bearing aluminosilicates.

40|$|Geothermal {{energy is}} an option for low carbon {{production}} of heat or electric energy. For further developments of this resource, a major obstacle is the risk of project failure due to uncertain estimates of flow rate and temperature (and, hence, produced power) of geothermal installations. In this work, I develop and apply stochastic methods and modeling strategies for predicting the variation of pressure, temperature, and their uncertainty with time within geothermal reservoirs based on observed thermal and hydraulic rock property distributions. This comprises stochastic forward and inverse modeling approaches for simulating heat and tracer transport as well as fluid flow numerically. The approaches reduce the corresponding a priori uncertainties of perturbed parameters and states drastically by 50 %- 67 % in case of temperature {{at a depth of}} 2000 m, depending on the target location. Furthermore, I estimate the spatial distribution of permeability as well as its uncertainty by applying the stochastic assimilation technique of Ensemble Kalman Filtering on production data for sedimentary rocks and fractured hard rocks. This addresses structure and parameter heterogeneity within the reservoir. I study different geothermal reservoirs, such as (i) numerous synthetic reservoirs to test the tools of Sequential Gaussian Simulation combined with geostatistical post-processing and Ensemble Kalman Filter. (ii) Further, I quantify temperature uncertainties of a doublet system in a sedimentary reservoir in The Hague, The Netherlands. (iii) In addition to temperature uncertainties, I study pressure uncertainties at a reservoir in the north-eastern German basin. Here, also a single-well design for exploitation of geothermal energy along a fault zone proofs to represent an alternative to doublet layouts. By gradient-based deterministic Bayesian inversion, basal specific heat flow is revealed. (iv) Finally, I investigate the hard rock reservoir of the Enhanced Geothermal System at Soultz-sous-Forêts, France, using Sequential Gaussian Simulation and Ensemble Kalman Filtering in an equivalent porous medium approach. A tracer circulation test performed in 2005 provides data for the inversion. Applying the two different stochastic methods allows for identifying best estimates for the heterogeneously distributes hydraulic parameters, studying their non-uniqueness, and comparing the results from stochastic (massive Monte Carlo, Ensemble Kalman Filter) and deterministic (gradient-based Bayesian inversion) estimation techniques. Based on the Ensemble Kalman Filter estimation results, I perform a long-term performance prediction with regard to transient temperature variation including corresponding uncertainties.

Scaling can severely damage <b>geothermal</b> <b>installations</b> or decrease the injectivity of the reservoir (Gallup 2009; Regenspurg et al. 2010; Tomaszewska and Pająk 2012; Wanner et al. 2017; Boch et al. 2017). Over many years, scale inhibitors have been applied to overcome this problem.

However, when applied in <b>geothermal</b> <b>installations,</b> the effectivity of these commonly used inhibitors can decrease considerably due to the special physico-chemical conditions of geothermal fluids such as high pressure, high temperature, high salinity or content of corrosive or scale-forming chemicals.

Furthermore, established scaling inhibitors based on phosphates or phosphonates are known to have toxic effects on aquatic organisms or cause eutrophication problems (Hasson et al. 2011; Lattemann and Höpner 2008). Based on their chemical composition, some inhibitors are expected to be persistent or even cumulative in the reservoir. Environmental concerns of the governmental authorities are increasing and enforce the usage of “green” inhibitors that are non-toxic and biodegradable (Chaussemier et al. 2015; Popov et al. 2016). New scaling inhibitors meeting these requirements were lately tested with regard to their inhibitory efficiency (Reddy and Hoch 2001; Baraka-Lokmane et al. 2008; Kavitha et al. 2011; Choi et al. 2002) but scarcely at elevated temperatures such as occurring in geothermal fluids (Topçu et al. 2017; Ketrane et al. 2009).|$|R

Typically thin (mm-range) scale deposits form in wells and transport pipes and are later mobilized (flaked off) {{in the course}} of thermal water flow. The growth and subsequent mobilization of such scale-fragments can cause specific and often serious problems, i.e., material damages and a rapid deterioration in the efficiency of hydrogeothermal heat extraction. Over short time intervals (e.g., weeks to few months in this study), critical accumulation, cementation, and clogging of filters and heat exchangers can occur. This leads to significantly reduced fluid flows and energy transfers. As a consequence, necessary maintenance intervals are shortened and impaired technical components (e.g., plate or tube bundle heat exchangers) have to be replaced unscheduled. In worst cases, the commercial viability of the geothermal infrastructure becomes a subject of debate.|$|R
40|$|The Leibniz Institute for Applied Geosciences {{is setting}} up an internet-based {{information}} system on geothermal re-sources in close collaboration with partners. For a start, the geothermal information system will contain data about hydrogeothermal resources only. The project aims at an improvement of quality in the planning of geothermal plants and at a minimization of exploration risks. The key parameters for this purpose are production rate (Q) and temperature (T). The basis for the estimation of subsurface hydraulic properties comes from the information system on hydrocarbons. This information system provides permeabil-ity and porosity values derived from core analysis data. The IT targets will be realised by a relational database providing all data relevant to the project. A 3 D model of the underground provides the basis for visualisation and calculation of geothermal resources. As a prototype, an internet research tool of <b>geothermal</b> <b>installations</b> in Germany {{is available on the}} internet. ...|$|R
40|$|Nowadays {{renewable}} energy resources for heating/cooling residential and tertiary buildings and agricultural greenhouses {{are becoming increasingly}} important. In this framework, a possible, natural and valid alternative for thermal energy supply is represented by soils. In fact, since 1980 soils have been studied and used also as heat reservoir in geothermal applications, acting as a heat source (in winter) or sink (in summer) coupled mainly with heat pumps. Therefore, it is worthy of interest a better comprehension of how the different soil typologies (i. e. sand, loamy sand [...] .) affect and {{are affected by the}} heat transfer exchange with heat collectors, especially when horizontal ones (very shallow <b>geothermal</b> <b>installations)</b> are adopted. In this study the preliminary results of ITER Project ([URL] funded by European Union, are shown. An overview of physical-thermal properties variations under different moisture and load conditions for different mixtures of natural material is presented, based on laboratory and field test data...|$|R
30|$|There are {{cultural}} differences in {{acceptance of the}} technology. We exemplified this by discussing and comparing data from eastern and western Germany. The differences {{in the distribution of}} shallow <b>geothermal</b> energy <b>installations</b> may be rooted not only in different institutional developments since the early 1990 s but also in a fundamentally different way of perceiving the geological underground as a place for energy utilization stemming from the pre- 1990 socialist era.|$|R
