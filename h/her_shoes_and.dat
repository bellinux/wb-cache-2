The dog picks up <b>her</b> <b>shoe</b> <b>and</b> carries it away, forcing Ramona to limp her way back to school.

25|$|In 2011, Raven-Symoné {{starred in}} her first {{television}} series in four years as the main character of ABC Family's multi-camera comedy pilot State of Georgia. The project, from ABC Studios, centers on her character named Georgia, an exuberant and curvy performer from the south {{who is trying to}} make it big as an actress in New York City.

25|$|One {{persistent}} rumor {{was especially}} prevalent in Europe; fake news circulated that Shirley {{was not a}} child but a 30-year-old dwarf {{due in part to}} her stocky body type. The rumor was so prevalent that the Vatican dispatched Father Silvio Massante to investigate if she were indeed a child. The fact that she never seemed to miss any teeth led some people to conclude that she had all her adult teeth. Temple was actually losing her teeth regularly through her days with 20th Century Fox, most notably during the sidewalk ceremony in front of Grauman's Theatre, where she took off <b>her</b> <b>shoes</b> <b>and</b> placed her bare feet in the cement to take attention away from her face. When acting, she wore dental plates and caps to hide the gaps in her teeth. Another rumor pertaining to her teeth was the idea that they were filed to make them appear like baby teeth.|$|E

500|$|While {{waiting at}} the airport for Laura to arrive, Jerry and George try to {{identify}} the possible signals Laura might give upon her arrival, with George explaining the meaning of various greetings. However, when Laura arrives, her greeting is ambiguous. Upon arriving at Jerry's apartment Laura removes <b>her</b> <b>shoes</b> <b>and</b> some excess clothing to get comfortable, asks for wine, and turns down the light and asks if she can stay over a second night. As Jerry removes his own shoes and begins to grow confident, the phone rings for Laura. When Laura gets off the phone she tells Jerry: [...] "Never get engaged." [...] Jerry then realizes {{that he has no}} chance with Laura, but has already committed himself – and his one-bedroom apartment – to an entire weekend with her, including a five-hour sightseeing boat ride around Manhattan.|$|E

2500|$|Later {{that year}} on December 13 {{she was arrested}} during a {{performance}} at Stage Door Johnny's, a strip club in Cleveland.

But the dragonfly went round and round: it never settled anywhere--of course not, happily not, or I shouldn't be walking here with Eleanor and the children--Tell me, Eleanor.

50|$|After leaving Sehwaj, Jiji {{was passing}} Pataliyawas, near Bilara and {{approximately}} 45 km from Sehwaj, when suddenly heavy rains started.

2500|$|Taylor has {{received}} criticism and praise. She {{has received}} criticism and potential doubts raised over {{her ability to}} be an effective center; the Washington Post criticised her and commented that she [...] "cannot control her size" [...] and that she often ends up [...] "blocking her own players" [...] in practice. In its Analysis of the prospected centers in the 2004 WNBA Draft, the Seattle Storm criticized Taylor: [...] "As long as Taylor could tie <b>her</b> <b>shoes</b> <b>and</b> walk without tripping on her own feet, she'd be a WNBA prospect." [...] It also felt, she had not been an effective dominating force at UC Santa Barbara despite her great height and facing what it considered relatively weak Big West competition.|$|E
2500|$|Minnie was {{designed}} in the fashion of a [...] "flapper" [...] girl. Her main outfit consisted of a short flapper girl dress that often revealed her distinctive patched knickers. [...] In the 1929 cartoon The Karnival Kid, it was also revealed that she wears black stockings which were also fashionable among flapper girls. Her shoes are probably her most distinctive article of clothing. For comedic effect, she wears oversized high heeled pumps that are too big for her feet. Her heels often slip out of <b>her</b> <b>shoes,</b> <b>and</b> she even loses her shoes completely in The Gallopin' Gaucho. When she walked or danced, the clip clop of her large pumps was usually heard clearly and often went with {{the rhythm of the}} music that was played in the background. Along with Mickey, she was redesigned in 1940. Her hat was replaced with a large bow, and bows were added to her shoes as well. Her eyes were also given more detail. Throughout the forties and fifties, her look and personality became more conservative. [...] Minnie almost always wears red or pink, but in her early appearances, she could be seen wearing a combination of blue, black or green (when not depicted in black and white).|$|E
