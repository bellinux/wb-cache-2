40|$|We have {{demonstrated}} {{a reduction in}} the gate leakage current of AlGaN/GaN HEMTs by suppressing <b>gate</b> <b>edge</b> silicidation. We found that the silicidation of Ni in the <b>gate</b> <b>edge</b> during formation of the SiN passivation film caused a lower work function and increased the gate leakage current. A NiOx barrier layer inserted between the gate electrode and passivation film prevented silicidation of the gate metal and drastically reduced the gate leakage current. We also determined that silicidation was prevented by a higher oxidation rate of NiOx. The gate leakage current was attributed to both the <b>gate</b> <b>edge</b> and Schottky junction. Moreover, we confirmed no initial degradation in a DC stress test at high temperature.

The leakage current due to direct tunneling is simulated using the CET as fitting parameter.

40|$|Abstract—We {{study the}} effects of <b>gate</b> line <b>edge</b> {{roughness}} (LER) on doping profiles of MOSFET transistors using two-dimensional numerical calculation and advanced process simulation. Gate LER transfers the roughness to doping profiles self-aligned to <b>gate</b> <b>edges</b> such as source/drain (S/D) extensions. We found that the transferred roughness has a dominant contribution to the LER effects on device performance. Implantation scattering and diffusion are low-pass filters in the roughness transfer. Low frequency gate LER with 30 nm or larger correlation length @ A causes rough S/D-channel junctions, which approximately follow the roughness of <b>gate</b> <b>edges</b> with slight reduction in the RMS roughness value under typical thermal budget.

The effect of passivation was also discussed. It was found that both surface leakage currents and hot electrons are responsible for the non-localized trapping effects with hot electrons having the dominant effect. Since hot electrons are generated from the 2 DEG channel, it is highly likely that the involved traps are mainly in the GaN buffer layer. Using monochromatic irradiation (1. 24 - 2. 81 eV), the trap levels responsible for the non-localized trapping effects were found to be located at 0. 6 - 1. 6 eV from the valence band of GaN. Both trap-assisted impact ionization and direct channel electron injection are proposed as the possible mechanisms of the hot-electron-related non-localized trapping effect.

Surfacecharging due to applied biases was sensed by mapping the surface potential between the gate and drain using scanning Kelvin probe microscopy. Due to the bias, the surface band bending near the <b>gate</b> <b>edge</b> was observed to increase {{by as much as}} 1 eV. This increase of band bending is caused by an accumulation of excess charge near the surface during the applied bias. By varying the duration of the applied bias, we find that this accumulation of excess charge near the gate takes about 20 s to saturate. Continuous monitoring of the surface potential after switching off the bias shows that a complete relaxation of the excess band bending requires about 800 s. Drain current transient measurements show that the collapse and recovery of the drain current also occur on similar time scales.

25|$|Semiconductor sub-micrometer and {{nanometer}} {{electronic circuits}} {{are the primary}} concern for operating within the normal tolerance in harsh radiation environments like outer space. One of the design approaches for making a radiation-hardened-by-design (RHBD) device is Enclosed-Layout-Transistor (ELT). Normally, {{the gate of the}} MOSFET surrounds the drain, which is placed {{in the center of the}} ELT. The source of the MOSFET surrounds the gate. Another RHBD MOSFET is called H-Gate. Both of these transistors have very low leakage current with respect to radiation. However, they are large in size and take more space on silicon than a standard MOSFET. In older STI (shallow trench isolation) designs, radiation strikes near the silicon oxide region cause the channel inversion at the corners of the standard MOSFET due to accumulation of radiation induced trapped charges. If the charges are large enough, the accumulated charges affect STI surface edges along the channel near the channel interface (gate) of the standard MOSFET. Thus the device channel inversion occurs along the channel edges and the device creates off-state leakage path, causing device to turn on. So the reliability of circuits degrades severely. The ELT offers many advantages. These advantages include improvement of reliability by reducing unwanted surface inversion at the <b>gate</b> <b>edges</b> that occurs in the standard MOSFET. Since the <b>gate</b> <b>edges</b> are enclosed in ELT, there is no <b>gate</b> oxide <b>edge</b> (STI at <b>gate</b> interface), and thus the transistor off-state leakage is reduced very much.
