40|$|Abstract. The {{upcoming}} 802. 11 w {{amendment to}} the 802. 11 standard eliminates the 802. 11 deauthentication and disassociation Denial of Ser-vice (DoS) vulnerabilities. This paper presents two other DoS vulnera-bilities: one vulnerability in draft 802. 11 w implementations discovered by IEEE 802. 11 TGw, and one new vulnerability in 802. 11, which is still present in the 802. 11 w amendment. Attacks exploiting the first vul-nerability are significantly more efficient than any known 802. 11 DoS attacks, while attacks exploiting the second vulnerability have efficiency and <b>feasability</b> equivalent to a disassociation attack. This paper pro-vides an experimental verification of these attacks, demonstrating their <b>feasability</b> using freely available software and off the shelf hardware.

The aim of this thesis {{is to determine the}} biological and technological <b>feasability</b> of application of the ATOC-refinery concept to coriander (Coriandrum sativum L.) Chapter I reports a bibliographic state of the art study on extraction and characterisation of coriander vegetal oil and essential oil while chapter II describes materials and methods setting up during the thesis for sampling, extraction, analysis and data processing. Chapter III focus on the study of major various biological parameters influencing bioaccumulation of vegetal oil and essential oil in coriander (different plant varieties, different plant organs, different biological stages) and their impact on anti-oxidant activity of extracts obtained from extraction residues. In chapter IV, coriander fruits are processed by extrusion technology (mono screw and twin-screw extruder) in order to evaluate the <b>feasability</b> of mechanical pressing for extracting a flavored vegetal oil. Influence of operating parameters on vegetal oil extraction yields (nozzle diameter and nozzle/screw distance (single-screw extruder) or screw configuration, device’s filling coefficient and pressing temperature (twin-screw extruder)) is studied while the <b>feasability</b> of valorization of extraction cake as agromaterial (thermopressing) was stated...|$|E
