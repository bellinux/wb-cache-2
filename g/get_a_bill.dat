However, legislators from Springfield, Massachusetts blocked the legislation on the grounds the official book should be by Springfield native Dr. Seuss. Legislators reached a compromise when they agreed to make Dr. Seuss the official children's author of the commonwealth and Make Way for Ducklings the official children's book.|$|E

25|$|Ohio has {{had three}} capital cities: Chillicothe, Zanesville, and Columbus. Chillicothe was the capital from 1803 to 1810. The capital was {{then moved to}} Zanesville for two years, {{as part of a}} state {{legislative}} compromise, in order to <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>bill</b> passed. The capital was then moved back to Chillicothe, which was the capital from 1812 to 1816. Finally, the capital was moved to Columbus, in order to have it near the geographic center of the state, where it would be more accessible to most citizens.|$|E

500|$|The {{decision}} {{caused an}} immediate negative reaction from some citizens of Washington. Bumper stickers reading [...] "Can Judge Boldt, Not Salmon" [...] appeared, and Boldt was hung in effigy {{at the federal}} courthouse. Non-Indian commercial fishermen ignored the ruling and the state was reluctant (or at times refused) to enforce the law. By 1978, Congressman John E. Cunningham tried to <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>bill</b> passed to abrogate the treaties, to break up Indian holdings, and stop giving the tribes [...] "special consideration", but the effort failed. In 1984, Washington voters passed an initiative ending [...] "special rights" [...] for Indians, but the state refused to enforce it as being preempted by federal law.|$|E
500|$|Stevens steered {{a bill to}} enfranchise African-Americans in the District of Columbia {{through the}} House; the Senate passed it in 1867, and it was enacted over Johnson's veto. Congress was {{downsizing}} the Army for peacetime; Stevens offered an amendment, which {{became part of the}} bill as enacted, to have two regiments of African-American cavalry. His solicitude for African-Americans extended to the Native American; Stevens was successful in defeating a bill to place reservations under state law, noting that the native people had often been abused by the states. [...] An expansionist, he supported the railroads. He added a stipulation into the [...] Pacific Railroad Act requiring the applicable railroads to buy iron [...] "of American manufacture" [...] of the top price qualities. Although he sought to protect manufacturers with high tariffs, he also sought unsuccessfully to <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>bill</b> passed to protect labor with an eight-hour day in the District of Columbia. [...] Stevens advocated a bill to give government workers raises; it did not pass.|$|E

2500|$|Poignant {{testimony}} and persuasive speaking {{is not what}} passes legislation, however; political compromise, arm-twisting, and parliamentary creativity are {{what is necessary to}} <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>bill</b> signed into law. The Senate Environmental and Land Use Committee, of which Macpherson was a member but not the chair, stood as an obstacle to passage, with only a minority of 3 of its 7 members supportive of SB 100. All efforts to clear compromise legislation through the committee failed. An end run was made around the legislative logjam through the establishment of a new ad hoc committee chaired by former legislator L. B. Day, which attempted to [...] "breathe life into a dead bill," [...] as Day phrased it.|$|E

Although the controversy seemed settled, the naming issue rose again {{in the last year of}} construction after the assassination of President John F. Kennedy. A petition to name the bridge for Kennedy received thousands of signatures. In response, LaCorte contacted United States Attorney General Robert Kennedy, the president's brother, who told LaCorte that he would make sure the bridge would not be named for his brother. (Idlewild Airport, New York's major international airport, was renamed after Kennedy instead.) ...|$|E
5000|$|In December 1992, White moved a {{resolution}} advocating {{the creation of}} a regulating body for social workers in Ontario. At the time, Ontario was the only province that did not have a regulating body for social workers. A spokesman for the Ministry of Social Services said that legislation for social work was a low priority. While he was not successful in <b>getting</b> <b>a</b> <b>bill</b> passed during his time as MPP, <b>a</b> similar <b>bill</b> called the Social Work and Social Service Work Act was enacted in 1998.

2500|$|Despite {{his great}} wealth and high position, Thomas {{could not come}} to terms with his brother's {{appointment}} as Protector; and in his struggle with Somerset, he tried to ingratiate himself with the king, who was just a little boy. He sought the 9-year-old Edward to write a letter on his behalf in support of his marriage to the dowager queen, Catherine Parr. The letter was obviously dictated by Thomas for Edward's signature and only enraged Somerset. He began to visit Edward frequently, secretly giving him an extravagant allowance of coins, so that Edward might be satisfied in feeling more grown-up and more king-like, giving gifts to his servants, teachers, and friends. Even though he lived in sumptuous splendor, and wanting for nothing, no provisions had been made for Edward's pocket money and he became accustomed to these regular payments and began to ask Thomas freely for his allowance. Thomas continued his manipulation of the king. [...] In trying to <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>bill</b> through Parliament making him Edward's personal Governor, Thomas requested Edward's royal signature on the bill. [...] But Edward was uncertain, and reluctant to go behind the back of the Protector, Somerset, and of the regency council, and he would not sign it. [...] Thomas persistently pressured Edward, until Edward felt threatened. But Thomas did not give up. He tried to persuade Edward that he did not need a Protector, getting Edward to admit that it might be better for Somerset to die. [...] It is not known what the king meant by this, but it was probably uttered innocently. Thomas intended that the king's royal signature and personal support would destabilize Somerset's position as Protector, and {{as a member of the}} regency council. In his frustration and inability to gain any significant influence over the king, Thomas began to think in terms of open rebellion. [...] Although he was a boy, King Edward did not seem completely na√Øve regarding any of this. [...] For, it is recorded that Edward referred to William Parr, his step-mother's brother, as [...] "mine honest uncle," [...] indicating unspoken scorn for both of his Seymour uncles..|$|E

50|$|Despite {{being one}} of the show's main stars, William Devane did not receive {{on-screen}} credit in any of the episodes. Devane was originally slated to get second billing in the cast, between Judith Light and Angela Goethals. He reportedly fought to have top billing, or at least shared top billing with Light, in response to his Knots Landing fame. Both the producers and ABC refused to move Devane's billing, feeling that Judith Light having sole first billing would draw in more of the female 18-49 demographic that is attractive to advertisers and would bring back ABC viewers who had made Light's previous series, Who's the Boss?, a success. Devane ultimately told the producers that if he couldn't <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>billing</b> change, he would rather not be credited at all.|$|R

There are some thirty other {{individuals}} in Coniston whose mortgages Jethro holds, from a horse to a house and farm.

And Jethro has never said that he wishes them to. If so, where are your witnesses? Have we not come back to our starting-point, even as Moses Hatch drove around in a circle.. And we have the advantage over Moses, for we suspect somebody, and he did not know whom to suspect. Certainly not Jethro Bass, the man that lived under his nose and never said anything--and had no right to. Jethro Bass had never taken any active part in politics, though some folks had heard, in his rounds on business, that he had discussed them, and had spread the news of the infamous ticket without a parent. So much was spoken of at the meeting over which Priest Ware prayed. It was even declared that, being a Democrat, Jethro might have influenced some of those under obligations to him. Sam Price was at last fixed upon as the malefactor, though people agreed that they had not given him credit for so much sense, and Jacksonian principles became as much abhorred by the orthodox as the spotted fever.|$|E
