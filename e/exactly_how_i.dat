500|$|..... Like with 'Everytime' I {{wrote the}} whole thing from scratch on the piano. Musically there was no track or anything. I was just at my house and I did {{the whole thing}} by myself. And then I went and I played it for [...] and I just {{basically}} told him <b>exactly</b> <b>how</b> <b>I</b> wanted the song to sound. And he was so amazing because there's a lot of producers you tell them things and they don't get it. And you're like oh, that's not the right way. He got it just right. He was amazing. And so that song specifically, you know, I did everything." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Cold Case Love" [...] {{was written}} and {{produced}} by The Y's (Justin Timberlake, Robin Tadross and James Fauntleroy II). At the [...] "Justin Timberlake & Friends Concert in Las Vegas", Timberlake told MTV News that Rated R {{is a whole}} new sound and that the new songs are not just a rehash of what fans heard on her last album. [...] "She broke onto the scene so hard with the last record— to have that many songs on the charts is impressive. I think that the smartest thing she's doing is not trying to emulate what she did but move forward", Timberlake explained. In February 2010, Rihanna admitted that [...] "Cold Case Love" [...] was inspired by her difficult relationship with ex-boyfriend Chris Brown, [...] "It's a song that everybody wanted to hear, everything that I didn't say for the past eight months, <b>exactly</b> <b>how</b> <b>I</b> felt about that relationship and how I feel about it now– that song says it all." [...] When asked what the most important song from the album to her was, she stated that she doesn't have one, however, Rihanna cited [...] "Cold Case Love" [...] together with [...] "Fire Bomb" [...] as her favorites.|$|E
500|$|Love denied ever telling Wilson [...] "don't {{fuck with}} the formula", {{adding that the}} Beach Boys [...] "have no formula. In 1967 alone, the year I {{supposedly}} made that comment, we recorded Wild Honey, an R album that was entirely different from anything we'd ever done, and I cowrote ten songs and sang three leads." [...] In 1975, he voiced appreciation of the musical form and content of [...] "Surf's Up" [...] from Smile, which he believed went beyond what is normally expected of commercial pop music, {{and in the same}} 1992 article where he refers to some of the Pet Sounds lyrics as [...] "nauseating", he calls Parks a [...] "very gifted musician", saying: [...] "He's great. He's one of the nicest persons in the world. And I tell him, 'Hey, I thought your lyrics, Van Dyke, were brilliant, except who the fuck knows what you're talking about!' That's <b>exactly</b> <b>how</b> <b>I</b> talk to him (laughs). And he and I joke about it." [...] He considers that [...] "a lot of people don't understand I {{have a sense of humor}} that's kind of wack, or different, or sometimes bratty, so I get labeled with that and there goes my image, right down the toilet." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "What I cannot understand," [...] Penelope said coldly, [...] "is why {{you should}} bother me about your duty. When I saw you at the Carlton Hotel, <b>I</b> told you <b>exactly</b> <b>how</b> much <b>I</b> knew of Mr. Hamilton Fynes." ...|$|R

500|$|For In the Zone, Spears {{worked with}} hit {{producers}} such as Bloodshy & Avant, R. Kelly, Diddy, Christopher Stewart, Moby, Guy Sigsworth and The Matrix. She first started writing songs for In the Zone during the Dream Within a Dream Tour. Spears commented about writing while touring, [...] "The {{only thing that}} was scary {{to me is that}} I didn't know if they were good. [...] You can’t trust anybody. You have to go with your feelings." [...] Spears commented that she was an autobiographical songwriter, although not to the point she felt self-exploited. Following the end of the tour, Spears invited her friend and backing vocalist Annet Artani to her home in Los Angeles. They started writing songs at the piano, and shortly after, they traveled to Lake Como in Lombardy, Italy. Among the tracks they worked on was [...] "Everytime", which Artani confirmed to be written as a response to Justin Timberlake's [...] "Cry Me a River", as well as [...] "Shine", written by Spears about her sister Jamie Lynn, which was left unfinished. Earnest recording of the album began in May 2003. Spears commented that although she did not know initially what direction she wanted to go with the album, she took time to work with different producers and to find those who she had chemistry with. The first song recorded for In the Zone was [...] "Touch of My Hand", and Spears said it [...] "really did provide a balance {{for the rest of the}} record. We just went from there." [...] Following the recording sessions for [...] "Everytime", Spears complimented Sigsworth, saying, [...] "I just basically told him <b>exactly</b> <b>how</b> <b>I</b> wanted the song to sound. And he was so amazing because there's a lot of producers you tell them things and they don't get it. And you're like oh, that's not the right way. He got it just right. He was amazing." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "I am a bit {{sorry to}} end it in this fashion. This is not <b>exactly</b> <b>how</b> <b>I</b> planned to place the period [...] It doesn't help that I feel that I have the desire and ability {{to be among the}} best in the world. It will be {{difficult}} without badminton. I have worked hard on accepting my situation and in my heart-of-hearts, I am OK with saying goodbye to the sport that has been everything to me since my youth." [...] - announcing his retirement.|$|E
2500|$|Punk band Dropkick Murphys {{covered the}} song for their 2017 album 11 Short Stories of Pain & Glory. Vocalist/bassist Ken Casey {{said in a}} December 2016 {{interview}} discussing the reason behind their version. [...] "As you may know, opiate overdoses are an epidemic in America now particularly in (the Boston) area. I've been to thirty wakes in two years, three this week, one being my cousin, Al's lost a brother in law. It's hit home close to us. I was leaving one of the wakes and this song came on and as I {{was listening to the}} lyrics it summed up <b>exactly</b> <b>how</b> <b>I</b> was feeling. Sad, but knowing there is hope. You never have to be alone. I hope you our version".|$|E
6000|$|... "When I am of age," [...] Jeanne said calmly, [...] "which {{will happen}} {{sometime}} or other, I suppose, it will interest {{me to know}} <b>exactly</b> <b>how</b> much money <b>I</b> have and <b>how</b> it is invested." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "The {{philosophers}} have calculated in {{some way}} or other, though <b>I</b> don't <b>exactly</b> know <b>how.</b> <b>I</b> believe they have ascertained how great the pressure of the air is here at the surface of the earth, and have calculated {{in some way}}, from that, how high the air must be to produce such a pressure." ...|$|R
5000|$|His all-time {{favorite}} pop song is The Beatles' [...] "Here, There and Everywhere" [...] and his {{all-time favorite}} album is Rumours by Fleetwood Mac. When {{asked about his}} musical preferences, he answered, [...] "I have a very sure-footed sense of what <b>I</b> like, and <b>exactly</b> <b>how</b> much <b>I</b> like it. Give me two listenings of a song, and I can tell you <b>exactly</b> <b>how</b> it sits with me... I know my musical taste. I know my ears, I know what I respond to." ...|$|R
2500|$|As {{possible}} {{evidence that}} the [...] "sexual song" [...] theory was created later, songwriter LaBostrie was quoted as saying, [...] "Little Richard didn't write none of 'Tutti Frutti'. I'll tell you <b>exactly</b> <b>how</b> <b>I</b> came to write that. I used to live on Galvez Street and my girlfriend and I liked {{to go down to}} the drug store and buy ice cream. One day we went in and saw this new flavor, Tutti Frutti. Right away I thought, 'Boy, that's a great idea for a song'. So I kept it in the back of my mind until I got to the studio that day. I also wrote the flip side of 'Tutti Frutti', 'I'm Just A Lonely Guy', and a spiritual, 'Blessed Mother', all in the same day." [...] LaBostrie was still receiving royalty checks on the average of $5,000 every three to six months from the song in the 1980s.|$|E
2500|$|Many of George's predicaments {{were based}} on David's past real-life experiences. In [...] "The Revenge", for example, when George quits his job in a fury only to realize {{he has made a}} mistake, he goes back the next day as if nothing happened; this mirrors David's actions while working as a writer for Saturday Night Live, when he quit and then {{returned}} to his job in the same manner. [...] As the show progressed, Alexander discovered that the character was based on David. As Alexander explains in an interview for the Seinfeld DVD, during an early conversation with David, Alexander questioned a script, saying, [...] "This could never happen to anyone, and even if it did, no human being would react like this." [...] David replied, [...] "What do you mean? This happened to me once, and this is <b>exactly</b> <b>how</b> <b>I</b> reacted." [...] After that, Alexander changed his performance from an imitation of Woody Allen to what he has called a [...] "shameless imitation of Larry David." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "I wasn't <b>exactly</b> careful <b>how</b> <b>I</b> went out, {{and came}} down hard on my elbow and my knee," [...] he said. [...] "It took all the running out of me, and the fellow evidently had his horse ready. Before {{we could get a}} horse saddled, he'd be 'most two miles away. Well, we'll see what he has sent me, though I have a notion what it is." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And I don't {{want it to}} drop through. If {{they propose}} to make any trouble, I prefer to meet them rather than wait around {{in the hope that}} it will be forgotten. I am obliged to earn my living, and from these people here, for the time being. Therefore, they will be doing me a very great favor if they find out <b>exactly</b> <b>how</b> far <b>I</b> am {{responsible}} for last night's work." ...|$|R
6000|$|Let me narrate <b>exactly</b> <b>how</b> it happened. <b>I</b> {{should have}} {{proceeded}} to do so, in {{my very first}} word, but for this plain consideration--if I am {{to tell a story}} I must begin at the beginning; and how is it possible to begin at the beginning without beginning at the kettle? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Admirably expressed!" [...] he rejoined, {{recovering}} his light-hearted {{looks and}} his lover-like ways {{all in a}} moment. [...] "My dear lady, you have the gift of sympathy; you see <b>exactly</b> <b>how</b> <b>I</b> am situated. Do you know, {{you remind me of}} my charming Lady Clarinda. She has the gift of sympathy, and sees <b>exactly</b> <b>how</b> <b>I</b> am situated. I should so enjoy introducing you to each other," [...] said the Major, plunging his long nose ecstatically into Lady Clarinda's flowers.|$|E

6000|$|... "Marquis," [...] he said, [...] "I {{should like}} to know <b>exactly</b> <b>how</b> <b>I</b> stand with you--the 'Double-Four,' that is to say--supposing I range myself {{for an hour or}} so on the side of the law?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, <b>I</b> don't know <b>how,</b> <b>exactly.</b> <b>I</b> regard Lindau as a {{political}} economist of an unusual type; but I shall not let him array me against the constituted authorities. Short of that, I think I am safe." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes. There {{is nothing}} {{for you to}} do until we see <b>exactly</b> <b>how</b> things stand. <b>I</b> shall use you as my staff officer--that is, if you are willing, Sir Cyril.

5000|$|... "As {{you will}} {{probably}} have heard, I have received a very gracious message from the Vice President, congratulating me for winning the election.

6000|$|... "That is <b>exactly</b> <b>how</b> <b>I</b> {{feel about}} it," [...] was the answer, [...] "and why I was {{so anxious to}} have him along. He has proved himself our friend through thick and thin. It is too bad {{that there are not}} more of such." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It's them! Of course it's them!" [...] cried Mrs. Aleshine.

6000|$|... "I {{suppose it}} sounds so," [...] Rowan admitted. [...] "But listen, Deane. You know I have many weak points, but I {{am not a}} coward. I like big risks, and I am always willing to take them. The doctor gives me twelve months--that means, I suppose, about seven months during which I shall {{be able to get}} about, and five months of slow torture in a hospital. I mention this again so that you can {{understand}} <b>exactly</b> <b>how</b> much <b>I</b> value my life. Isn't there any work you could put me on to where the risk was great--the greater the better--but if I succeeded I could make a reasonable sum of money? Think!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "MY DEAR VANDRIFT.--(After so {{long and}} so varied an {{acquaintance}} we may surely drop the absurd formalities of 'Sir Charles' and 'Colonel.')

I have mislaid my account-book, and as this is the season for making the income tax return, I am anxious, as an honest and conscientious citizen, to set down my average profits out of you for the triennial period. For reasons which you will amply understand, I do not this time give my private address, in Paris or elsewhere; but if you will kindly advertise the total amount, above the signature 'Peter Simple,' in the Agony Column of the Times, you will confer a great favour upon the Revenue Commissioners, and also upon your constant friend and companion, CUTHBERT CLAY, ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Why did I do it?" [...] Wrayson repeated. [...] "I can't tell you. I {{only know}} that I {{should do it}} again and again if the need came. If I told you <b>exactly</b> <b>how</b> <b>I</b> felt, it would sound like rot. But I'm going to ask you that question." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I cannot {{tell you}} <b>exactly</b> <b>how</b> <b>I</b> {{discovered}} it. At present it {{is a secret}} that both my mother and uncle charged me to keep, but when these troubles are over I will explain it all to you, though I should certainly do so to no one else." ...|$|E

500|$|In a {{three-way}} race between Nixon, Humphrey, and American Independent Party candidate former Alabama Governor George Wallace, Nixon defeated Humphrey by nearly 500,000 votes (seven-tenths {{of a percentage}} point), with 301 electoral votes to 191 for Humphrey and 46 for Wallace.
