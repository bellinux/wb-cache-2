2500|$|Burroughs' opinions, {{manifested}} {{through the}} narrative {{voice in the}} stories, reflect common attitudes in his time, which in a 21st-century context would be considered racist and sexist. However Thomas F.

[...] The author is not especially mean-spirited in his attitudes. His heroes do not engage in violence against women or in racially motivated violence. In Tarzan of the Apes, details of a background of suffering experienced at the hands of whites by Mbonga's [...] "once great" [...] people are repeatedly told with evident sympathy, and in explanation or even justification of their current animosity toward whites.|$|R
