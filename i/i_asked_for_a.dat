60|$|What {{she said}} {{recalled}} {{me to my}} bodily suffering. Agitation, {{and the effects of}} the usage I had received, had produced a burning thirst. <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> drink of water.|$|E
6000|$|... "I had hoped," [...] {{the editor}} wrote, [...] "when <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> story from your pen, to receive {{something}} like `His Wife's Deceased Sister,' and I must own that I am very much disappointed." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Knows a horse all over, {{outside and}} in," [...] Sergeant Lane interposed. [...] "I allow that's why {{they sent him}} when <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> good dog driver, though {{in a general way}} our bosses aren't given to joking. Walthew will tell you there's a {{difference}} between physicking a horse and harnessing a sled team." ...|$|E
5000|$|Although I am an anarch, I am not anti-authoritarian. Quite the opposite: I need authority, {{although}} I do {{not believe}} in it.

6000|$|GOSPODAR (taking off his cap). [...] "I {{ask your}} courtesy, Captain.

60|$|Arrived at the milliner's (one of the {{expensive}} West-End houses, as I expected), <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> private interview, on important business, with {{the mistress of}} the concern. It {{was not the first}} time that she and I had met over the same delicate investigation. The moment she set eyes on me she sent for her husband. I mentioned who Mr. Yatman was, and what we wanted.|$|E
60|$|I thought I {{had never}} seen such a large room as that into which they showed me. It had five windows, with dark red {{curtains}} that would have absorbed the light of a general illumination; and there were complications of drapery {{at the top of the}} curtains, that went wandering about the wall in a most extraordinary manner. <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> smaller room, and they told me there was no smaller room.|$|E
6000|$|The {{editor of}} a Western {{magazine}} wrote {{to me for a}} story to be published in a special number which he would issue for the holidays. I wrote him one of the character and length he asked for, and sent it to him. By return mail it came back to me. [...] "I had hoped," [...] the editor wrote, [...] "when <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> story from your pen, to receive something like 'His Wife's Deceased Sister,' and I must own that I am very much disappointed." ...|$|E

6000|$|While {{she was in}} full {{enjoyment}} of this last aggravation of {{the horrors of the}} prospect, Emily tried another change of position--and, this time, with success. Greedy admiration suddenly opened Mrs. Rook's little eyes to their utmost width. [...] "My heart alive, miss, what do I see at your watch-chain? How they sparkle! Might <b>I</b> <b>ask</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> closer view?" ...|$|R
60|$|Must. I confess he's {{somewhat}} tough; but I {{suppose you}} would not boil him, <b>I</b> <b>ask</b> <b>for</b> him <b>a</b> thousand crowns.|$|R
6000|$|... "It were a dead crow," [...] Bruno persisted. [...] "And {{there were}} a apple-pudding --and Uggug ate it all--and I got nuffin but a crust! And <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> orange--and--didn't get it!" [...] And the poor little fellow {{buried his face in}} Sylvie's lap, who kept gently {{stroking}} his hair,as she went on. [...] "It's all true, Professor dear! They do treat my darling Bruno very badly! And they're not kind to me either," [...] she added in a lower tone, as if that were a thing of much less importance.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes; it was mamma {{who said}} I ought to write it. But {{she is going}} out this morning; and, when <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> word of advice, she shook her head. 'They will think it comes from me,' she said, 'and the whole effect {{of it will be}} spoilt.' It's a letter, Mrs. Wagner, announcing my {{marriage}} to mamma's relations here, who have behaved so badly to her--and she says they may do something for me, if I write to them as if I had done it all out of my own head. I don't know whether I make myself understood?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That {{was more}} than a year ago. I stayed there--waiting. Nothing was sure, except that the town grew like a mushroom. It filled with soldiers--and the worst crowd I ever saw. You can bet I was shaky when I finally got an {{audience}} with General Lodge and his staff. They had an office in a big storehouse. The place was full of men--soldiers and tramps. It struck me right off what a grim and discouraged bunch those engineers looked. I didn't understand them, but I do now.... Well, <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> job. Nobody appeared to hear me. It was hard to make yourself heard. I tried again--louder. An old engineer, whom I know now--Henney--waved me aside. Just as if a job was unheard of!" ...|$|E
60|$|Having {{decided on}} my sailing date <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> Howells <b>for</b> <b>a</b> few letters of {{introduction}} to English authors.|$|R
60|$|I {{so highly}} prize your new work, that <b>I</b> must <b>ask</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> dozen copies to {{distribute}} among my friends.|$|R
6000|$|Almost desperate, <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> <b>for</b> half <b>a</b> cake; she again refused. [...] "How {{could she}} tell where I had got the handkerchief?" [...] she said.|$|R
60|$|The shower was now over, and {{a rainbow}} above the eastern woods promised a fair evening; so I took my departure. When I had got without <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> drink, {{hoping to get}} a sight of the well bottom, to {{complete}} my survey of the premises; but there, alas! are shallows and quicksands, and rope broken withal, and bucket irrecoverable. Meanwhile the right culinary vessel was selected, water was seemingly distilled, and after consultation and long delay passed out to the thirsty one--not yet suffered to cool, not yet to settle. Such gruel sustains life here, I thought; so, shutting my eyes, and excluding the motes by a skilfully directed undercurrent, I drank to genuine hospitality the heartiest draught I could. I am not squeamish in such cases when manners are concerned.|$|E
6000|$|... 'So it does, in reason; {{but last}} spring {{there was a}} doom on my pocket-handkerchiefs. The Harewood puppy ate up one; one dropped into the canal; I tied up a fellow that had got a cut with one, and the beggar never {{returned}} it; {{and two or three}} more went I don't know how. I knew W. W. would be in a dreadful state if <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> fresh lot, so I used to wash out the last two by turns, till I got some tip and bought some fresh ones--such jolly ones, all over acrobats and British flags; and after all, didn't I catch it? Wilmet was no end of disgusted to miss her little stupid speckotty ones, vowed these weren't decent for the Cathedral, and boned them all for Theodore! Now, hush! or I shall come to grief!' ...|$|E
60|$|I {{followed}} this man along a rudely-paved street, lit now by a fitful gleam of moonlight; {{he brought me}} to the inn. I offered him sixpence, which he refused to take; supposing it not enough, I changed it for a shilling; but this also he declined, speaking rather sharply, in a language to me unknown. A waiter, coming forward into the lamp-lit inn-passage, reminded me, in broken English, that my money was foreign money, not current here. I gave him a sovereign to change. This little matter settled, <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> bedroom; supper I could not take: I was still sea-sick and unnerved, and trembling all over. How deeply glad I was when the door of a very small chamber at length closed on me and my exhaustion. Again I might rest: though the cloud of doubt would be as thick to-morrow as ever; the necessity for exertion more urgent, the peril (of destitution) nearer, the conflict (for existence) more severe.|$|E

6000|$|... "I will, by Duncan!" [...] He {{tore the}} page {{out of the}} {{magazine}} {{and put it in}} his pocket. [...] "I'll tell you what I'll do. I'll give this thing <b>a</b> trial <b>for</b> <b>a</b> week or two, {{and at the end of}} that time I'll go to the boss and see how he reacts when <b>I</b> <b>ask</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> rise of salary. If he crawls, it'll show there's something in this. If he flings me out, it will prove the thing's no good." ...|$|R
60|$|The {{number of}} motor {{manufacturers}} who give away complete sets of treble-ribbed Irresilient tyres is so limited that <b>I</b> believe <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> Leggatt <b>for</b> <b>an</b> explanation.|$|R
60|$|As for me, I was dazed. Here was I, under sentence, after a farce {{of a trial}} wherein I {{was denied}} not only my right of trial by jury, but my right to plead guilty or not guilty. Another thing my fathers had fought for flashed through my brain--habeas corpus. I'd show them. But when <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> lawyer, I was laughed at. Habeas corpus was all right, but of what good was it to me when I could {{communicate}} with no one outside the jail? But I'd show them. They couldn't keep me in jail forever. Just wait till I got out, that was all. I'd make them sit up. I knew something about the law and my own rights, and I'd expose their maladministration of justice. Visions of damage suits and sensational newspaper headlines were dancing before my eyes when the jailers came in and began hustling us out into the main office.|$|E
60|$|Smudge, {{with three}} or four of the fiercest of his companions, had begun again to menace me with the knife, making signs, at the same time, for me to turn the ship's head towards the land. <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> little room, and then {{describing}} a long circle on the deck, pointing to the four sails we had set, and this in a way to tell them that under the canvass we carried, it would be necessary to go a great distance in order to turn round. When I had succeeded in communicating this idea, I forthwith set about giving them to understand that by getting up the top-masts, and making more sail, we might return immediately. The savages understood me, and the explanation appearing reasonable to them, they went aside and consulted together. As time pressed, it was not long before Smudge came to me with signs to show him and his party how to get the remainder of the sails set. Of course, I was not backward in giving the desired information.|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{will be glad}} to hear, my love," [...] he said, [...] "that I {{can speak}} from {{personal}} experience of Anne Rodway's happiness. She came to live in my parish soon after the trial at which she appeared as chief witness, and I was the clergyman who married her. Months before that I knew her story, and had read those portions of her diary which you have just heard. When I made her my little present on her wedding day, and when she gratefully entreated me to tell her what she could do for me in return, <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> copy of her diary to keep among the papers that I treasured most. 'The reading of it now and then,' I said, 'will encourage that faith in the brighter and better part of human nature which I hope, by God's help, to preserve pure to my dying day.' In that way I became possessed of the manuscript: it was Anne's husband who made the copy for me. You have noticed a few withered leaves scattered here and there between the pages. They were put there, years since, by the bride's own hand: they are all that now remain of the flowers that Anne Rodway gathered on her marriage morning from Mary Mallinson's grave." ...|$|E
