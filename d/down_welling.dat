50|$|Geodynamic mantle {{convection}} {{models have}} included compositional distinctive material. The material {{tends to get}} swept up in ridges or piles. When including realistic past plate motions into the modeling, the material gets swept up in locations that are remarkably similar {{to the present day}} location of the LLSVPs. These locations also correspond with known slab graveyard locations mentioned in the origin section. These types of models, as well as the observation that the degree two structure of the LLSVPs is orthogonal to the path of true polar wander, suggest these mantle structures have been stable over large amounts of time. This geometrical relationship is also consistent with the position of the supercontinent Pangaea, and the formation of the current geoid pattern due to continental break-up from the superswell below.However, the heat from the core is not enough to sustain the energy needed to fuel the superplume(s) located at the LLSVPs. There is a phase transition from perovskite to post-perovskite from the <b>down</b> <b>welling</b> slab(s) that causes an exothermic reaction. This exothermic reaction helps to heat the LLSVP, but it is not sufficient enough to account for the total energy needed to sustain it. So it is hypothesized that the material from the slab graveyard can become extremely dense and form large pools of melt concentrate enriched in uranium, thorium, and potassium. These concentrated radiogenic elements are thought to provide the high temperatures needed. So, the appearance and disappearance of slab graveyards predicts the birth and death of an LLSVP, potentially changing the dynamics of all plate tectonics.|$|E

Likewise, the experimental approach was quite simple in concept, namely: accurately measure the zenith infrared radiance at high spectral resolution while simultaneously profiling the radiatively important atmospheric properties with conventional and remote sensing devices. The field phase of SPECTRE was carried out as part of FIRE Cirrus II, and detailed spectra of the <b>down</b> <b>welling</b> radiance were obtained by several interferometers simultaneous to the measurement of the optical properties of the atmosphere.

These strong lateral heterogeneities are much larger than those calculated from global tomographic models and imply significantly complex structures at the CMB that have long been known to exist [see Garnero (2000); Lay and Garnero (2011) for a review], even on the small-scale level (Ma et al. 2016; Sun et al. 2016). The explanations for these heterogeneities, however, are still inconclusive. Wysession et al. (1992) correlated the strong lateral heterogeneity at the CMB with core flow models from geomagnetics (Voorhies 1986). They demonstrated that the adjacent fast and slow regions possibly correspond to areas of core upwelling and <b>down</b> <b>welling,</b> respectively. Other explanations probably include chemical variations and/or thermal variations [see Tackley (2012) for a review]. For the origin of ULVZ-like structures, partial melt (Williams and Garnero 1996; Berryman 2000; Lay et al. 2004; Hernlund and Tackley 2007) or iron-enriched lower mantle materials introduced by subducted paleo-slabs (Dobson and Brodholt 2005) or core interactions from below (Sakai et al. 2006) may provide reasonable explanations (Wicks et al. 2010; Bower et al. 2011).|$|E

The work has been mainly focused on retrieving and validating the coefficients of the foreign contribution to the water vapour continuum absorption, within a spectral range overlapping the water vapour rotational band. Retrievals have been performed by using a simultaneous physical retrieval procedure for atmospheric and spectroscopic parameters. Both day (summer) and night (winter) spectra have been used in our analysis. This new set of observations in the far infrared range has allowed us to extend validation and verification of state-of-the-art water vapour continuum absorption models down to 180 cm− 1. The results show that discrepancies between measurements and models are less than 10 % in the interval 350 - 590 cm− 1, while they are slightly larger at wave numbers below 350 cm− 1. Overall, our study shows a good consistency between observations and state-of-the-art models and gives evidence for the need of also adjusting line absorption as done in Delamere et al. (2010). Finally, it has been found that there is a good agreement between the coefficients retrieved using either summer or winter spectra, which are acquired in far different meteorological conditions...|$|E

40|$|The role of {{equatorial}} oceanic {{waves on}} the evolution of the 2007 positive Indian Ocean Dipole (pIOD) event was evaluated using available observations and output from a quasi-analytical linear wave model. It was found that the 2007 pIOD event was a weak and short-lived event: developed in the mid-summer (July), matured in the early-fall (September), and terminated in the mid-fall (October). The evolution of the 2007 pIOD event was linked to the equatorial wave dynamics. The event development was associated with the generation of upwelling equatorial Kelvin waves (westward current anomalies) generated by easterly wind anomalies. The event termination was associated with the occurrence of eastward zonal current anomalies resulting from a complex interplay between the wind-forced <b>down</b> <b>welling</b> Kelvin waves and the eastern-boundary-reflected Rossby waves. Results from a quasi-analytical linear wave model show that during the event development and maturation, the wind-forced Kelvin waves played a dominant role in generating zonal current anomalies along the equatorial Indian Ocean, while the easternboundary-reflected Rossby waves tended to weaken the wind-forced Kelvin wave signals. During the event termination our model shows that the initiation of anomalous eastward current resulted from the reflected Rossby waves at the eastern boundary. The wind-forced Kelvin waves associated with the seasonal reversal of the monsoon further strengthened the eastward zonal currents generated by the boundary-generated Rossby waves in late-October/early-November. This highlights the importance of the eastern-boundary-reflected Rossby waves on the IOD event termination...|$|E
40|$|We {{examined}} {{the influence of}} river stage on subsurface hydrology and pore water chemistry within the hyporheic zone of a groundwater-fed river during the summer baseflow period of 2011. We found river stage and geomorphologic environment to control chemical patterns in the hyporheic zone. At high river stage, the flux of upwelling water in the shallow sediments (> 20 [*]cm) decreased at samples sites in the upper section of our study reach and increased substantially at sites in the lower section. This differential response is attributed to the contrasting geomorphology of these sub-reaches which affects {{the rate of the}} rise and fall of river stage relative to subsurface head. At sites where streamward vertical flux decreased, concentration profiles of a conservative environmental tracer suggest surface water infiltration into the riverbed below depths recorded at low river stage. An increase in vertical flux at sites in the lower sub-reach is attributed to the movement of lateral subsurface waters originating from the adjacent floodplain. This lateral-moving water preserved or decreased the vertical extent of the hyporheic mixing zone observed at low river stage. <b>Down</b> <b>welling</b> surface water appeared to be responsible for elevated dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and Mn concentrations in shallow sediments (0 – 20 [*]cm); however, lateral subsurface flows were probably important for elevated concentrations of these solutes at deeper levels. Results suggest that DOC delivered to hyporheic sediments during high river stage from surface water and lateral subsurface sources could enhance heterotrophic microbial activities.

40|$|Photochemical {{processes}} {{driven by}} high-energy ultraviolet radiation (UVR) in inshore, estuarine, and coastal waters {{play an important}} role in global bio geochemical cycles and biological systems. A key to modeling photochemical processes in these optically complex waters is an accurate description of the vertical distribution of UVR in the water column which can be obtained using the diffuse attenuation coefficients of <b>down</b> <b>welling</b> irradiance (Kd()). The Sea UV Sea UVc algorithms (Fichot et al., 2008) can accurately retrieve Kd (320, 340, 380, 412, 443 and 490 nm) in oceanic and coastal waters using multispectral remote sensing reflectances (Rrs(), Sea WiFS bands). However, SeaUVSeaUVc algorithms are currently not optimized for use in optically complex, inshore waters, where they tend to severely underestimate Kd(). Here, a new training data set of optical properties collected in optically complex, inshore waters was used to re-parameterize the published SeaUVSeaUVc algorithms, resulting in improved Kd() retrievals for turbid, estuarine waters. Although the updated SeaUVSeaUVc algorithms perform best in optically complex waters, the published SeaUVSeaUVc models still perform well in most coastal and oceanic waters. Therefore, we propose a composite set of SeaUVSeaUVc algorithms, optimized for Kd() retrieval in almost all marine systems, ranging from oceanic to inshore waters. The composite algorithm set can retrieve Kd from ocean color with good accuracy across this wide range of water types (e. g., within 13 mean relative error for Kd(340)). A validation step using three independent, in situ data sets indicates that the composite SeaUVSeaUVc can generate accurate Kd values from 320 490 nm using satellite imagery on a global scale. Taking advantage of the inherent benefits of our statistical methods, we pooled the validation data with the training set, obtaining an optimized composite model for estimating Kd() in UV wavelengths for almost all marine waters. This optimized composite set of SeaUVSeaUVc algorithms will provide the optical community with improved ability to quantify the role of solar UV radiation in photochemical and photobiological processes in the ocean...|$|E

40|$|High {{mountains}} divide Costa Rica, Central America, {{into two}} main climate regions, the Pacific and Caribbean slopes, which are lee and windward, respectively, {{according to the}} North Atlantic trade winds – the dominant wind regime. The rain over the Pacific slope has a bimodal annual cycle, having two maxima, one in May–June {{and the other in}} August-September-October (ASO), separated by the mid-summer drought in July. A first maximum of deep convection activity, and hence a first maximum of precipitation, is reached when sea surface temperature (SST) exceeds 29 °C (around May). Then, the SST decreases to around 1 °C due to diminished downwelling solar radiation and stronger easterly winds (during July and August), resulting in a decrease in deep convection activity. Such a reduction in deep convection activity allows an increase in <b>down</b> <b>welling</b> solar radiation and a slight increase in SST (about 28. 5 °C) by the end of August and early September, resulting once again in an enhanced deep convection activity, and, consequently, in a second maximum of precipitation. Most of the extreme events are found during ASO. Central American National Meteorological and Hydrological Services (NMHS) have periodic Regional Climate Outlook Fora (RCOF) to elaborate seasonal predictions. Recently, meetings after RCOF with different socioeconomic stakeholders took place to translate the probable climate impacts from predictions. From the feedback processes of these meetings has emerged that extreme event and rainy days seasonal predictions are necessary for different sectors. As is shown in this work, these predictions can be tailored using Canonical Correlation Analysis for rain during ASO, showing that extreme events and rainy days in Central America are influenced by interannual variability related to El Niño-Southern Oscillation and decadal variability associated mainly with Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation. Analyzing the geographical distribution of the ASO- 2010 disaster reports, we noticed that they did not necessarily agree with the geographical extreme precipitation event distribution, meaning that social variables, like population vulnerability, {{should be included in the}} extreme events impact analysis...|$|E
40|$|The {{detailed}} {{onset of}} the Antarctic glaciation during the Eocene/Oligocene and the later ice sheet dynamic in response to warm phases during the Miocene and Pliocene is still under discussion. Attempts to solve the open questions by scientific drilling have been limited {{by the fact that}} early Oligocene to early Miocene sediments, which bear witness to the onset of glaciation and early dynamics of the ice sheet, have been eroded from the continental shelf or are buried below thick Neogene sequences and could thus not be sampled during ODP Legs 119 and 188. Several hypotheses place the onset of bottom water formation as the result of <b>down</b> <b>welling</b> due to strong cooling into the Miocene, the late Oligocene, or the late Eocene, which shows the range of uncertainty in dating this event. The dynamical response, e. g., of the Lambert Glacier-Amery Ice Shelf drainage system to climate variability is recorded in the sediments of Prydz Bay and the adjacent slope and rise of the Cooperation Sea. Thus a study of sedimentary features and structures and the prevailing sediment transport patterns can help to understand the development of this system and its sensitivity to climate change. 	The analysis of seismic reflection data allows to reconstruct sediment input and sediment transport patterns. This represents an important tool, even if an indirect one, to infer past changes in climate and oceanography in the absence of direct information from drilled geological samples. A large dataset of high-quality seismic lines has been acquired along the Prydz Bay margin, is available via the SCAR seismic data library system and will be analysed with respect to documents of down-slope, i. e., the result of material input via advancing the ice sheet, and along-slope, i. e., features resulting from the shaping of bottom and deep water, to infer past changes in climate and oceanography in combination with results from ODP Leg 119 and 188. This way we also intend to close the gap, which could not be sampled by drilling (the early Oligocene to early Miocene) ...|$|E
40|$|Aerosol {{properties}} are highly variable {{in space and}} time which makes the aerosol study more complex. The sources and production mechanism of aerosols decide the properties of the aerosols. Aerosol radiative forcing is defined as the perturbation to the radiative fluxes of the earth atmosphere system caused by the aerosols. High uncertainty in the aerosol radiative forcing values exists today {{due to the lack of}} the exact chemical composition data of the aerosols everywhere. There are previous studies which have introduced methods to estimate ‘optical equivalent’ composition of aerosols using spectral aerosol optical depth measurements at the surface. The impact of aerosols on the solar radiative flux depends on its size distribution and composition. Hence, measurements of downward solar spectral fluxes at the surface can be used to infer ‘optically equivalent’ composition of aerosols. Measurements of downward solar spectral flux at Bangalore were made on clear days using a spectroradiometer. This data has been used to infer the aerosol composition following an iterative method with the help of the Santa Barbara DISORT Atmospheric Radiative Transfer (SBDART). Aerosols have been classified as water soluble, black carbon and three types of dust. Influence of the different aerosol types on spectral <b>down</b> <b>welling</b> irradiance at the surface have been simulated using Optical Properties of Aerosols and Clouds (OPAC) and SBDART models. The strong spectral dependence influence of water soluble aerosols and the dust aerosols on the spectral irradiance is shown. Aerosol composition was inferred following least square error minimization principle. This method can be used to estimate near-surface aerosol concentration if the vertical profile of aerosols is known a priori. This method also enables derivation of spectral single scattering albedo. The aerosol spectral radiative forcing has been estimated using downward spectral flux at the surface and compared with modeled fluxes. The contribution to the total forcing by the wavelength band 360 – 528 nm is around 60 % of the total forcing. The wavelength band of 453 - 518 nm contributes maximum to the total forcing and it is seen that the shape of the spectral forcing is a major function of shape of the incoming solar spectrum. Aerosol spectral radiative forcing from observations of radiative fluxes agreed with modeled values when derived aerosol chemical composition was used as input. This study demonstrates that spectral flux measurements at the surface are useful to infer aerosol composition (which is optically equivalent) when and where the conventional chemical analysis is unavailable...|$|E
