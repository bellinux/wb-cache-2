5|$|Although a large horse <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>required</b> <b>to</b> {{carry an}} {{armoured}} knight, it {{is held by}} some historians that a large horse was desirable to increase {{the power of a}} lance strike. However, practical experiments by re-enactors have suggested that the rider's weight and strength is of more relevance than the size of the mount, and that little of the horse's weight is translated to the lance.|$|E

5|$|Jonathan Blow, the game's lead designer, {{desired to}} create a game around non-verbal communication, wanting players to learn from {{observation}} and to come to epiphanies in finding solutions and leading to {{a greater sense of}} involvement and accomplishment with each success.

5|$|The 11-category, game {{theoretical}} {{taxonomy of}} chess includes: two player, no-chance, combinatorial, Markov state (present state {{is all a}} player needs to move; although past state led up to that point, knowledge of the sequence of past moves <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>required</b> <b>to</b> make the next move, except {{to take into account}} of en passant and castling, which do depend on the past moves), zero sum, symmetric, perfect information, non-cooperative, discrete, extensive form (tree decisions, not payoff matrices), sequential.|$|E

A special edition of the soundtrack was released on October 28, 2003, featuring a DVD with a trailer, demo movie, and high quality music for Halo 2.|$|E

5|$|Often {{the most}} senior and {{responsible}} Patrol Leader is appointed as Troop Leader (TL), who no longer runs a Patrol but instead has other responsibilities such as enforcing discipline and running the weekly programme. Since a Troop Leader <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>required</b> <b>to</b> plan or run Patrol camps, or help Scouts through the advancement program many senior Scouts {{who are in their}} final year of school choose to become Troop Leaders to have more time to concentrate on their studies and on achieving the Springbok award.|$|E

5|$|The Supreme Court, {{reversing}} the Fifth Circuit, {{held that the}} NLRB decision was appropriate because its interpretation of the NLRA was permissible. The Court explained that the NLRB is entrusted with the responsibility to adapt the NLRA to changing times and {{that as a result}} courts reviewing its decisions only have the authority to reject its interpretations of the NLRA if those decisions are impermissible under it. This also led to the Court's observation that the NLRB can change its interpretation of the NLRA over time and <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>required</b> <b>to</b> comply with its earlier decisions.|$|E
5|$|The {{hash value}} that this class {{associates}} with each object, its identityHashCode, {{is guaranteed to}} remain fixed for the lifetime of an object but is otherwise arbitrary. Because the identityHashCode is constructed only once per object, and <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>required</b> <b>to</b> {{be related to the}} object's address or value, its construction may involve slower computations such as the call to a random or pseudorandom number generator. For instance, Java 8 uses an Xorshift pseudorandom number generator to construct these values.|$|E
5|$|Although Texas {{eventually}} adopted {{much of the}} Anglo-American legal system, many Spanish legal {{practices were}} retained. Among these was the Spanish model of keeping certain personal property safe from creditors. Texas implemented the first homestead exemption in the United States in 1839, and its property exemption laws are now the most liberal state in the United States. Furthermore, Spanish law maintained that both husband and wife should share equally in the profits of marriage, and, like many other former Spanish provinces, Texas retained the idea of community property rather than use the Anglo laws in which all property belonged to the husband. Furthermore, Spanish law allowed an independent executor to be named in probate cases who <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>required</b> <b>to</b> gain court permission for each act not explicitly listed in the testament. Texas retained this idea, and it has eventually spread to other states, included Arizona, Washington, and Idaho. In other legal matters, Texas kept the Spanish principle of adoption, becoming the first U.S. state to allow adoption.|$|E

5|$|Goat Simulator is an {{open-ended}} third-person perspective {{game in which}} the player controls a goat. The player is free to explore the game's world, a suburban setting, as a goat, and jump, run, bash things, and lick objects. Licking objects attaches the goat's tongue to the object and lets the player drag the object around until they let go. At any time, the player can let the goat drop into a ragdoll model, allowing the game's physics to take over, and another control makes the game run in slow-motion. A number of environmental features allow the player to manipulate the goat into stunts such as bouncing off trampolines or launching the goat into the air through large fans. The game features a scoring system similar to skateboarding games like Tony Hawk's Pro Skater, whereby doing tricks or other actions earns points, while chaining such tricks together in sequence helps build a multiplier that applies to the total score of the tricks done in the sequence. Various in-game goals, such as achieving a certain height, completing flips, or destroying certain objects, are given to the player, but the player <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>required</b> <b>to</b> follow these instructions.|$|E
5|$|Since {{breeding}} Scamper was not {{an option}} for genetic inheritability, James spent several years researching the possibility of cloning. She chose ViaGen, an animal genetics corporation based in Austin, Texas, to perform the cloning procedure for $150,000. James registered the resulting colt born in 2006 with the American DNA Registry under the name Clayton, who is an identical genetic match to Scamper. James chose a surrogate mare to be the dam of the colt and receive the cloned embryo. At age two, James started Clayton as a breeding stallion. She offered his services to the public at a fee of $4,000. Clayton sired healthy progeny, many of whom have inherited Scamper's genetics. Of special note, the AQHA does not register cloned horses; however, breed registration <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>required</b> <b>to</b> compete in barrel racing or other PRCA and WPRA sanctioned rodeo events.|$|E
5|$|Solidarity lending is a {{cornerstone}} of microcredit, and the system is now used in more than 43 countries. Although each borrower must belong to a five-member group, the group <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>required</b> <b>to</b> give any guarantee for a loan to its members. Repayment responsibility rests solely on the individual borrower. The group and the centre oversee that everyone behaves responsibly and none gets into a repayment problem. No formal joint liability exists, i.e. group members are not obliged to pay {{on behalf of a}} defaulting member. But, in practice the group members often contribute the defaulted amount with an intention to collect the money from the defaulted member at a later time. Such behaviour is encouraged because Grameen does not extend further credit to a group in which a member defaults.|$|E
