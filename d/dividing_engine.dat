50|$|A <b>dividing</b> <b>engine</b> is {{a device}} {{employed}} to mark graduations on measuring instruments.|$|E
50|$|The {{early years}} {{were full of}} {{innovations}} and inventions, including the first automatic machine for graduating rules (1850) and the precision Gear Cutting and <b>Dividing</b> <b>Engine</b> (1855).|$|E
50|$|All wheel drive, {{optional}} on {{the more}} expensive trims included run-flat tires. The all wheel drive system continuously <b>divided</b> <b>engine</b> power 50:50 front and rear.|$|R
50|$|Prior {{work on the}} {{development}} of gear cutting machines had prepared the way. Such devices were required to cut a circular plate with uniform gear teeth. Clockmakers were familiar with these methods and they were important in developing <b>dividing</b> <b>engines.</b> George Graham devised a process of using geometric methods to divide the limb of an instrument. He developed a sophisticated beam compass to aid marking of the graduations. John Bird and Jeremiah Sisson followed on with these techniques. These beam compass techniques were used into the 19th century, as the <b>dividing</b> <b>engines</b> that followed did not scale up to the largest instruments being constructed.|$|R
50|$|Ramsden created one of {{the first}} {{high-quality}} <b>dividing</b> <b>engines.</b> This led to his speciality in dividing circles, which began to supersede the quadrants in observatories {{towards the end of the}} 18th century. He published a Description of an <b>Engine</b> for <b>dividing</b> Mathematical Instruments in 1777.|$|R
50|$|In France, Étienne Lenoir {{created a}} <b>dividing</b> <b>engine</b> of greater {{accuracy}} than the English version. Mégnié, Richer, Fortin and Jecker had also built dividing engines of considerable quality.|$|E
50|$|The <b>dividing</b> <b>engine</b> {{was unique}} among {{developments}} {{in the manufacture of}} scientific instruments, as it was immediately accepted by all makers. There was no uncertainty in the value of this development.|$|E
50|$|Edward Troughton was {{the first}} to build a copy of the Ramsden design. He {{enhanced}} the design and produced his own version. This permitted an improvement in the accuracy of the <b>dividing</b> <b>engine.</b>|$|E

50|$|Henry Hindley (1701-1771) was an 18th-century clockmaker, watchmaker and {{maker of}} {{scientific}} instruments. He invented a screw-cutting lathe, a fuse-cutting engine and an improved wheel-cutting engine and {{made one of}} the first <b>dividing</b> <b>engines,</b> for the construction of accurately-graduated arcs on scientific instruments. He is thought to have made the world's first equatorially-mounted telescope, which can now be seen in Burton Constable Hall.|$|R
40|$|Recent {{studies in}} the making of {{scientific}} knowledge have demonstrated that science and technology are mutually dependant on each other. One example here is the manufacture of scientific instruments. Both instrument makers’ tools and practices are essential for shaping the functioning of an instrument and thereby shaping later instrument users’ practice. In this article I examine two circular <b>dividing</b> <b>engines</b> recently acquired by National Museums Scotland which represent a specific style of practice and will contrast them with two engines from the same period kept at the Deutsches Museum in Munich. By doing so I will demonstrate how different manufacturing techniques determine what can be done with a scientific instrument and what cannot. Moreover, I will demonstrate that different designs of <b>dividing</b> <b>engines</b> determine if an instrument can be considered scientific or not. My emphasis on skills and practice can serve as a useful means for both understanding different concepts of science and technology and how they should be presented in museums. ...|$|R
50|$|In 1796 {{he moved}} to Munich where he began making his famous {{scientific}} instruments, including a <b>dividing</b> <b>engine,</b> in between carrying out military work, which included the invention of a breech-loading rifle which however did not prove popular.|$|E
50|$|His {{reputation}} was {{enhanced by the}} improvements he made to graduating instruments and his self-acting circular <b>dividing</b> <b>engine</b> reduced the work involved in manufacture from weeks to hours. He also helped standardize the measures of length the yard and chain for the Admiralty.|$|E
50|$|Jesse Ramsden {{followed}} duc de Chaulnes by {{five years}} in the production of his <b>dividing</b> <b>engine.</b> As with the prior inventions, Ramsden's used a tangent screw mechanism to advance the machine from one position to another. However, he had developed a screw-cutting lathe that was particularly advanced and produced a superior product. This engine was developed with funding from the Board of Longitude on condition that it be described in detail (along with the related screw-cutting lathe) and not be protected by patent. This allowed others to freely copy the device and improve on it. In fact, the Board required that he teach others to construct their own copies and make his <b>dividing</b> <b>engine</b> available to graduate instruments made by others.|$|E
50|$|As the {{developments}} in <b>dividing</b> <b>engines</b> progressed, the sextant was more accurate {{and could be}} made smaller. In order to permit easy reading of the vernier, a small magnifying lens was added. In addition, to reduce glare on the frame, some had a diffuser surrounding the magnifier to soften the light. As accuracy increased, the circular arc vernier was replaced with a drum vernier.|$|R
50|$|Box or pocket sextants:These {{are small}} sextants entirely {{contained}} within a metal case. First developed by Edward Troughton, {{they are usually}} all brass {{with most of the}} mechanical components inside the case. The telescope extends from an opening in the side. The index and other parts are completely covered when the case cover is slipped on. Popular with surveyors for their small size (typically only 6.5-8 cm in diameter and 5 cm deep), their accuracy was enabled by improvements in the <b>dividing</b> <b>engines</b> used to graduate the arcs. The arcs are so small that magnifiers are attached to allow them to be read.|$|R
5000|$|Graduations {{traditionally}} have been scribed into an instrument by {{hand with a}} sharp, hard tool. [...] Later developments in devices such as <b>dividing</b> <b>engines</b> allowed the process to automated with greater precision. Modern devices can be stamped, cut on a milling machine or with a CNC machine. In the case of stamping, the master has the precision built into itself and the stamped device is as accurate as the stamping process allows. Similarly, molding of plastic can be as precise as the mold process. With proper concern for such effects as thermal expansion or contraction and shrinkage, the precision can be very high.|$|R
50|$|In {{the late}} 1780s, Jesse Ramsden, a Yorkshireman from Halifax, England who had {{developed}} the <b>dividing</b> <b>engine</b> for dividing angular scales accurately {{to within a}} second of arc (≈ 0.0048 mrad or 4.8 µrad), was commissioned {{to build a new}} instrument for the British Ordnance Survey. The Ramsden theodolite was used {{over the next few years}} to map the whole of southern Britain by triangulation.|$|E
50|$|Historically setting circles have rivaled the telescopes optics {{as far as}} {{difficulty}} in construction. Making a set of setting circles required a lot of precision crafting on a <b>dividing</b> <b>engine.</b> Setting circles usually had a large diameter and when combined with a vernier scale could point a telescope to nearly an arc minute of accuracy. In the 20th century setting circles were replaced with electronic encoders on most research telescopes.|$|E
50|$|Some {{improvements}} to Nunes' system {{were developed by}} Christopher Clavius and Jacob Curtius. Curtius' work led directly to that of Pierre Vernier, published in 1631. Vernier refined this process and gave us the vernier scale. However, though these various techniques improved the reading of graduations, they did not contribute directly {{to the accuracy of}} their construction. Further improvements came slowly, and a new development was required: the <b>dividing</b> <b>engine.</b>|$|E

50|$|In 1882, {{before the}} Physical Society of London, {{he gave a}} {{description}} of the diffraction gratings, with which his name is specially associated, and which have been of enormous advantage to astronomical spectroscopy. These gratings consist of pieces of metal or glass ruled by means of a diamond point with {{a very large number of}} parallel lines, on the extreme accuracy of which their efficiency depends. For their production, therefore, <b>dividing</b> <b>engines</b> of extraordinary trueness and delicacy were required, and in the construction of such machines Rowland's engineering skill brought him conspicuous success. The results of his labors may be found in the elaborate Photographic Map of the Normal Solar Spectrum (1888) and the Table of Solar Wave-Lengths (1898).|$|R

50|$|The first truly modern {{screw-cutting}} lathe {{was likely}} constructed by Jesse Ramsden in 1775. His device included a leadscrew, slide rest, and change gear mechanism. These form {{the elements of}} a modern (non-CNC) lathe and are in use to this day. Ramsden was able to use his first screw-cutting lathe to make even more accurate lathes. With these, he was able to make an exceptionally accurate <b>dividing</b> <b>engine</b> and in turn, some of the finest astronomical, surveying, and navigational instruments of the 18th century.|$|E
5000|$|Some of the {{earliest}} known systems of measurement and calibration {{seem to have been}} created between the ancient civilizations of Egypt, Mesopotamia and the Indus Valley, with excavations revealing the use of angular gradations for construction. The term [...] "calibration" [...] was likely first associated with the precise division of linear distance and angles using a <b>dividing</b> <b>engine</b> and the measurement of gravitational mass using a weighing scale. These two forms of measurement alone and their direct derivatives supported nearly all commerce and technology development from {{the earliest}} civilizations until about AD 1800.|$|E
50|$|In 1885 Swasey {{completed}} work at McCormick Observatory on the 45-foot dome, {{which was}} {{the largest in the}} world, and had a unique, 3 shutter design. In 1887 Swasey built the mount for the 36-inch refracting telescope at Lick Observatory. In 1898 he manufactured a <b>dividing</b> <b>engine</b> for the U.S. Naval Observatory that was used to make the meridian circles. Both the building and dome of the Dominion Astrophysical Observatory were made by Warner and Swasey Co. Other observatory telescopes and components were built by the company at the Kenwood Observatory, Yerkes Observatory, Argentine National Observatory, the Swasey Observatory at Denison University, and the Case Institute Observatory.|$|E

The complete version can be consulted at the University of Leicester Library. The application and perfecting of the screw for scientific purposes has been studied for the period ca. 1600 - 1900. An historical review of the means of producing screws, with special attention to precision screws, provides the basis for historical studies of the application of the screw to various types of micrometers and <b>dividing</b> <b>engines.</b> Developmental histories of micrometers, mainly astronomical, and <b>dividing</b> <b>engines</b> are also provided. Means of studying the profiles and accuracy of screws have been developed; the methods adopted employ techniques of period searching which are used for variable star studies. The Jurkevich-Swingler period searching technique (a modified Fourier transform method) has been used to study precision screws which may be fundamentally characterized as a periodic phenonena. Using the primary period of the screw thread (the pitch) an 'atlas' of screw profiles has been produced to determine the characteristics of the screws and to search for patterns in the profiles as a function of maker, period and use. The profiles and direct measurements of the micrometer screws have also provided estimates of the errors of the Instruments. Summaries and graphical analysis of these data have permitted a search for relationships between some of the fundamental characteristics of various classes of screws. These studies have identified the most serious types of errors encountered in precision-screws. Estimates of the accuracy of the best machining capabilities and the accuracy of astronomical observations and scale dividing, etc. as a function of time are provided. These estimates are compared with contemporary estimates and modern estimates for other types of related mechanism...|$|R

Analogous to multicylinder automobile engine, benefits include reduction in required accelerator system span-to-gap ratio for large-area engines, reduction in required hollow-cathode emission current, mitigation of plasma-uniformity problem, increased tolerance to accelerator system faults, and reduction in vacuum-system pumping speed...|$|R
50|$|In the 18th century, modern {{techniques}} and instruments for surveying {{began to be}} used. Jesse Ramsden introduced the first precision theodolite in 1787. It was an instrument for measuring angles in the horizontal and vertical planes. He created his great theodolite using an accurate <b>dividing</b> <b>engine</b> of his own design. Ramsden's theodolite represented a great step forward in the instrument's accuracy. William Gascoigne invented an instrument that used a telescope with an installed crosshair as a target device, in 1640. James Watt developed an optical meter for the measuring of distance in 1771; it measured the parallactic angle from which the distance to a point could be deduced.|$|E
50|$|Octants were {{produced}} in large numbers. In wood and ivory, their relatively low price {{compared to an}} all-brass sextant made them a popular instrument. The design was standardized with many manufacturers using the identical frame style and components. Different shops could make different components, with woodworkers specializing in frames {{and others in the}} brass components. For example, Spencer, Browning and Rust, a manufacturer of scientific instruments in England from 1787 to 1840 (operating as Spencer, Browning and Co. after 1840) used a Ramsden <b>dividing</b> <b>engine</b> to produce graduated scales in ivory. These were widely used by others and the SBR initials could be found on octants from many other manufacturers.|$|E
50|$|The {{first true}} {{circular}} <b>dividing</b> <b>engine</b> was probably constructed by Henry Hindley, a clockmaker, around 1739. This {{was reported to}} the Royal Society by John Smeaton in 1785. It was based directly on a gear cutting machine for clockworks. It used a toothed index plate and a worm gear to advance the mechanism. Duc de Chaulnes created two dividing engines between 1765 and 1768 for dividing circular arcs and linear scales. He desired to improve on the graduation of instruments by removing the skill of the maker from the technique where possible. While beam compass use was critically dependent on the skill of the user, his machine produced more regular divisions {{by virtue of its}} design. His machines were also inspired by the prior work of the clockmakers.|$|E

40|$|Small {{diesel engines}} are in common use for {{electrical}} power generation in many remote areas. These engines may be readily converted to burn alternative fuels such as alcohols {{which may be}} produced locally from indigenous raw materials. The highly turbulent combustion chambers in these rugged engines are ideally suited to burning lean, spark-ignited mixtures thereby improving economy whilst reducing exhaust emissions. This paper describes the conversion of a 7. 5 kW <b>divided</b> chamber <b>engine</b> to spark ignition and its combustion performance with lean methanol mixtures...|$|R
