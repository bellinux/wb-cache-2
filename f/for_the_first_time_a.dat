5|$|Fire Emblem: The Binding Blade is a {{tactical}} role-playing {{game in which}} players control main protagonist Roy and his growing army as they take part in battle across the land of Elibe. Gameplay is broken up into maps bookended by story sequences, with the completion of each map advancing the storyline. When the game is completed <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>time,</b> <b>a</b> new difficulty level is unlocked which gives access to new maps.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the operas, recordings have been issued of several orchestral works, including the ballet Le carillon, the piano concerto in E, the Fantaisie for cello and orchestra, and orchestral suites. Many individual mélodies by Massenet were included in mixed recitals on record during the 20th century, and more have been committed to disc since then, including, <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>time,</b> <b>a</b> CD in 2012, exclusively devoted to his songs for soprano and piano.|$|E
5|$|On October 31, 2012, Microsoft and government-owned {{organization}} Liechtenstein Marketing {{transformed the}} countryside of Liechtenstein {{for a special}} live action event for fans {{and members of the}} press. The Gutenberg Castle was transformed into a military fortification where guests tried out Halo 4 <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>time.</b> <b>A</b> nearby countryside had a United Nations Space Command military camp installed and Balzers Quarry was transformed into a battleground where fifteen actors played out a two-hour-long adventure.|$|E

5|$|The All Blacks {{opened the}} 2009 {{season with a}} 22–27 loss to France at Carisbrook, but {{defeated}} them 14–10 in Wellington a week later. On points difference, France won the Dave Gallaher Cup <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>time.</b> <b>A</b> week later the All Blacks defeated Italy 27–6 in Christchurch.

5|$|The Anglo-Venezuelan {{boundary}} dispute asserted <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>a</b> more outward-looking American foreign policy, {{particularly in the}} Americas, marking the United States as a world power.

5|$|When the General Assembly {{convened in}} January, Ralston {{proposed}} several acts aimed to improve work conditions. Among the laws he promoted, and the Assembly passed, were acts that banned {{the sale of}} narcotic drugs <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>time,</b> <b>a</b> minimum wage, and free vaccinations for several prevalent diseases. Ralston successfully lobbied for other improvements to the living conditions of the urban poor that included funding to provide clean running water and children's playgrounds.|$|E

5|$|At 08:45 Rivoli, {{which had}} been {{struggling}} to reach the harbour of Trieste, lost her mizzenmast under fire from both Victorious and Weasel. Nearly at the same moment, two of her 36-pounder long guns exploded, killing or wounding 60 men, greatly disorganising and demoralising the others, and forcing Barré to transfer gunners from the upper gun deck to man his lower battery. Fifteen minutes later, with his ship unmanageable and battered, Commodore Barré surrendered. Rivoli had suffered over 400 killed and wounded from her crew of over 800, who had only assembled <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>a</b> few days before and had never sailed their ship in open water. Losses aboard Victorious were also heavy, with one officer and 25 sailors and marines killed and six officers (including Captain Talbot) and 93 men wounded.|$|E
5|$|At birth, a {{rattlesnake}} hatchling {{has only a}} small button or 'primordial rattle' which is firmly attached {{to the tip of}} the tail. The first segment is added when the hatchling sheds its skin <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>time.</b> <b>A</b> new section is added each time the skin is shed until a rattle is formed. The rattle grows as the snake ages but segments are also prone to breaking off and hence the length of a rattle is not a reliable indicator of the age of a snake.|$|E
5|$|In 1940, at {{the same}} time all single-digit highway numbers were renumbered in the state, the M-86 {{designation}} replaced M-7. This incarnation of M-86 followed its present-day routing. Near Nottawa, M-86 ran concurrently with the contemporary M-78 north and east to Colon. In late 1948 or early 1949, the last section of highway was paved in Branch County, hard-surfacing all of M-86 <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>time.</b> <b>A</b> change related to M-66 and M-78 altered M-86 in 1965. South of Battle Creek, M-66 replaced M-78. Rather than follow M-78 between Colon and Athens, M-66 used a different series of roads. The net result was that along M-86, the M-78 concurrency was replaced by a shorter M-66 concurrency. The routing has remain unchanged since.|$|E

5|$|In early 1928, Chaplin {{began writing}} the script with Harry Carr. The plot {{gradually}} grew from an initial concept Chaplin had considered after {{the success of}} The Circus, where a circus clown goes blind and has to conceal his handicap from his young daughter by pretending that his inability to see are pratfalls. This inspired the Blind Girl. The first scenes Chaplin thought up were of the ending, where the newly cured blind girl sees the Little Tramp <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>time.</b> <b>A</b> highly {{detailed description of the}} scene was written, as Chaplin considered it {{to be the center of}} the entire film.|$|E
5|$|In the 1930s, Walton's {{relationship}} with the Sitwells became less close. He had love affairs and new friendships that drew him out of their orbit. His first long affair was with Imma von Doernberg, the young widow of a German baron. She and Walton met in the late 1920s and they were together until 1934, when she left him. His later affair with Alice, Viscountess Wimborne (born 1880), which lasted from 1934 until her death in April 1948, caused a wider breach between Walton and the Sitwells, as she disliked {{them as much as}} they disliked her. By the 1930s, Walton was earning enough from composing to allow him financial independence <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>time.</b> <b>A</b> legacy from a musical benefactress in 1931 further enhanced his finances, and in 1934 he left the Sitwells' house and bought a house in Belgravia.|$|E
5|$|Late in 1384 Carrouges entered {{society for}} the first time since his {{marriage}} four years earlier, attending a party to celebrate the birth of a neighbour's son. Carrouges and Le Gris met at the celebration and agreed to end their quarrel, Carrouges introducing Le Gris to his wife Marguerite <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>time.</b> <b>A</b> few months after this meeting, in March 1385, Carrouges attempted to increase his family wealth through military means, by joining the army of Jean de Vienne for an expedition sailing to Edinburgh. This force of about 3,000 soldiers was intended to unite with the Scottish army and raid Northern England, distracting English forces from operations in France. Traveling with men-at-arms, horses, gold and equipment, Carrouges and his entourage rode to Sluys and took ship to Leith during the spring of 1385.|$|E
5000|$|Oberkassel {{was first}} {{mentioned}} as Cassele in 722/723 and as Cassela in 1144. The name Oberkassel {{refers to a}} Roman fortification; {{in the course of}} time [...] "Romerkastell" [...] (Roman castle) became [...] "Oberkassel". Oberkassel absorbed the previously separate settlements of Berghoven (mentioned <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>time</b> in 873), Büchel (mentioned <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>time</b> in 1202), Broich (mentioned <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>time</b> in 1306) and Meerhausen (mentioned <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>time</b> in 1442).|$|R

5|$|Maurice Binder {{was hired}} to design the title sequence, and was {{involved}} in a dispute with Eon Production to have his name credited in the film. As Thunderball was the first James Bond film shot in Panavision, Binder had to reshoot the iconic gun barrel scene which permitted him to not only incorporate pinhole photographic techniques to shoot inside a genuine gun barrel, but also made Connery appearing in the sequence <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>a</b> reality, as stunt man Bob Simmons had doubled for him in the three previous films. Binder gained access to the tank at Pinewood which he used to film the silhouetted title girls who appeared naked in the opening sequence, which was the first time actual nudity (although concealed) had ever been seen in a Bond film.|$|E
5|$|The PowerBook100 had one {{external}} serial port, {{designed for}} use with a printer or any compatible RS-422 device. It was the first Macintosh to omit an external modem port, instead offering an optional built-in 2400 baud modem for communications. As a result, <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>a</b> user could not print directly and access AppleTalk or a faster external modem simultaneously, and devices such as advanced MIDI interfaces {{could not be used}} because they required the dedicated use of both ports. A third-party serial modem port could, however, be installed in the internal modem slot for consumers who needed traditional functions.|$|E
5|$|The fall of Melitene profoundly {{shocked the}} Muslim world: <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>time,</b> <b>a</b> major Muslim city had fallen and been {{incorporated}} into the Byzantine Empire. Kourkouas followed this success by subduing parts of the district of Samosata in 936 and razing {{the city to the}} ground. Until 938, the East remained relatively calm. Historians suggest that the Byzantines were likely preoccupied with the full pacification of Melitene, and the Arab emirates, deprived of any potential support from the Caliphate, were reluctant to provoke them.|$|E

5|$|The family {{sold the}} {{building}} in 1953 to William Zeckendorf for its assessed price of $18 million. The 1953 deal included the annex and the nearby Graybar Building, which along with the Chrysler Building sold for a combined $52 million. In 1957, the Chrysler Building, its annex, and the nearby Graybar Building across 43rd Street was sold for $66 million in what {{was reported to be}} the largest real estate sale at the time. In 1960, it was purchased by Sol Goldman and Alex DiLorenzo, who received a mortgage from the Massachusetts Mutual Life Insurance Company. In 1961, the building's stainless steel elements, including the needle, crown, gargoyles, and entrance doors, were polished <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>time.</b> <b>A</b> group of ten workers steam-cleaned the facade below the 30th floor, and manually cleaned the portion of the tower above the 30th floor, for a cost of about $200,000.|$|E
5|$|The ironclad age saw the {{development}} of explosive torpedoes as naval weapons, which helped complicate the design and tactics of ironclad fleets. The first torpedoes were static mines, used extensively in the American Civil War. That conflict also saw {{the development}} of the spar torpedo, an explosive charge pushed against the hull of a warship by a small boat. <b>For</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>time,</b> <b>a</b> large warship faced a serious threat from a smaller one—and given the relative inefficiency of shellfire against ironclads, the threat from the spar torpedo was taken seriously. The U.S. Navy converted four of its monitors to become turretless armored spar-torpedo vessels while under construction in 1864–5, but these vessels never saw action. Another proposal, the towed or 'Harvey' torpedo, involved an explosive on a line or outrigger; either to deter a ship from ramming or to make a torpedo attack by a boat less suicidal.|$|E

In March 2014 the Tesla Model S also broke the 28-year-old record for monthly sales of a single model {{regardless}} of its power source, surpassing the previous record set in May 1986. In July 2016, when new car registrations are break down by type of powertrain, <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>a</b> plug-in hybrid, the Mitsubishi Outlander P-HEV, listed as the top selling new car.
