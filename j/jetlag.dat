In July 2015, the site ran a successful Kickstarter campaign to raise £3,000 to broadcast the 2015 Ashes series {{live from the}} <b>Jetlag</b> Bar in London. A subsequent campaign the following winter raised over £5,000 to broadcast test series in the United Arab Emirates and South Africa.|$|E
500|$|Robert. C. Cooper {{suggested}} Australian actress Claudia Black for {{the role}} of Vala and contacted her agent two days before the filming of [...] "Prometheus Unbound" [...] began. The Stargate producers had approached Black several times before, but she had always been busy with other projects. At [...] "Prometheus Unbound"'s casting stage, the actress had just finished dialogue looping sessions for [...] in Australia. She thought the script of [...] "Prometheus Unbound" [...] was funny and self-contained enough for creative experiments, so she accepted the role and called the episode's director, Andy Mikita, in advance. He suggested an Out of Sight-kind chemistry for Vala and Daniel, and encouraged the actress to push the character as far as possible. On set, Claudia Black and Michael Shanks decided to make one of their first scenes, a fight sequence, as funny and non-machismo as possible to mirror Daniel's non-military background. In the meantime, Black tried to transform her day-long <b>jetlag</b> and lack of sleep into humour. When the producers saw the on-screen chemistry between Black and Shanks, they decided to make the character a bigger part of the show.|$|E
500|$|A {{pneumatic}} value {{failure in}} the preceding race, the United States Grand Prix, had forced Häkkinen to retire from the Grand Prix. With two races of the season remaining and an eight-point deficit after losing {{the lead in the}} Drivers' Championship, Häkkinen remained confident about his title chances: [...] "I know that what happened to me in the last Grand Prix, when I had to retire, can happen to anyone, It could happen to Michael. So I am very optimistic. I have come here prepared and thinking about these two races together. Not one, two." [...] Michael Schumacher emphasised the pressure of leading the championship going into Japan: [...] "It hasn't been a relaxing time at all and I still haven't completely got over the <b>jetlag</b> from the States. But I'm prepared to sacrifice this and a lot more to bring the title back to Maranello. And {{the same can be said}} of the entire team." [...] Ferrari team principal Jean Todt and former World Champion Jody Scheckter called for Barrichello and Coulthard to race fairly as both drivers were ordered by their teams to assist their teammates in the Championship battle.|$|E

2500|$|Rourke co-founded the Manchester v Cancer concert series, later {{known as}} Versus Cancer, {{to raise money}} for cancer research. Concerts took place in January 2006, March 2007, February 2008, and December 2009. He has since {{concentrated}} on his radio career, beginning with a Saturday-evening show on XFM Manchester. More recently he has been a regular on East Village Radio, where his colleagues include Mike Joyce. Rourke relocated to New York in early 2009.

The pair DJ at venues around the city; a selection of their remixes can be heard at Soundcloud.|$|E
40|$|We’ve {{looked forward}} to the {{vacation}} for weeks, even months. We’ve planned, we’ve packed. And then, after the flight to, say, Europe, we’re beat. We walk around in a <b>jetlagged</b> fog for days, unable to really enjoy the destination. It doesn’t have to be that way, says sleep expert Karl Doghramji, director of the Jefferson Sleep Disorder Center. With vacation season approaching, we spoke to him recently about how to ward off the worst of it...|$|R
50|$|At {{the start}} of the task, the two teams were each asked to choose the {{opposing}} team's project manager. The men chose Cyndi Lauper, hoping that she would mess up and get eliminated early on, as she was the only native New Yorker on either team, which they felt gave the women a big advantage. The women were split between Bret Michaels (who had admitted being severely <b>jetlagged)</b> and Rod Blagojevich (who they felt would focus on making himself look good at the expense of actually running the task), and eventually decided on Bret, hoping to set him up for failure.|$|R
30|$|Some posts {{signaled}} the blogger’s awareness of specific elements of culture shock {{and even the}} phenomena itself. For example: “I was <b>jetlagged</b> and culture shocked…” and “I woke up feeling homesick…” and “…it makes me feel depressed and a little panicky….” Other posts that were coded as culture shock, the blogger {{may or may not}} have been aware are elements of the experience of culture shock. Posts that talked about the loss of familiar cues and the disorientation or inability to make sense of familiar situations were examples of this. This evidence suggests that in travel blogs, intercultural communication researchers may find fairly rich data sets about culture shock to study.|$|R

500|$|Gibson {{finds it}} painful {{to try to}} connect with the Victorian Singapore, of which few vestiges remained. In an attempt to uncover Singapore's {{underlying}} social mechanisms, the author searches fruitlessly for an urban underbelly, rising at dawn for <b>jetlagged</b> walks on several mornings only to discover that the city-state's [...] "physical past ... has almost entirely vanished". He gives an overview of the history of Singapore from the founding of modern Singapore by Sir Stamford Raffles in 1819 to the Japanese occupation and the establishment of the Republic in 1965. He concludes that modern Singapore, effectively a one-party state and capitalist technocracy, is a product first and foremost of the vision of three-decade Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew. As an aside, he quotes a headline from the South China Morning Post detailing the trial of a cadre of economists, a government official (current Deputy Prime Minister, Tharman) and a newspaper editor for divulging a state secret by revealing the Singaporean economic growth rate.|$|R
