6000|$|Spike gave a long, low whistle, {{after his}} fashion, {{and he walked}} away from the females, with the air of a man who wanted room to think in. Half a minute later, he called out--"Stand by to shorten sail, boys. Man fore-clew-garnets, flying jib <b>down</b> <b>haul,</b> {{topgallant}} sheets, and gaff-topsail gear. In with 'em all, my lads--in with everything, with a will." ...|$|E
5000|$|... “We {{had only}} the {{foresail}} and the two lower topsails set on the fore and main masts to help out the Bolling, but were gradually running up on her as the wind was fair and we were making good time. The order was given to clew <b>down</b> (<b>haul)</b> the lower topsails. One of the ordinary seamen who knew little about sailing ships ran and released the lines before the sail was clewed and the sail tore in two. Just then the towline snapped {{and there were some}} harsh words.” ...|$|E
5000|$|Like the symmetric, the Asymmetrical {{spinnaker}} {{is often}} {{stored in a}} turtle, with the corners on top for easy access. While a symmetric spinnaker is flown with a [...] "guy" [...] and a [...] "sheet", an asymmetric spinnaker is flown with a tackline and a [...] "sheet." [...] The tack attaches to the bow or (often retractable) bowsprit, and the two sheets attach to the clew. The head of the sail {{is attached to the}} spinnaker halyard, which is used to raise the sail. The sheets are passed to either side of the forestay, attached to the clew; they may be passed forward of the luff of the asymmetric, or aft of the luff of the asymmetric, between the tack line and the forestay. The sheet on the downwind (lee) side of the hull is used to trim the sail, and the opposite sheet is left slack. Often a tack line is used at leading edge to provide adjustable tension on the luff of the spinnaker. To keep the tack near the centerline of the boat, it may be attached to the forestay with a sliding collar (often riding over the furled jib on parrel beads, tacker or similar device) adjustable with a <b>down</b> <b>haul,</b> or tack line [...] This allows the tack to slide up and down the forestay to adjust the luff tension. [...] On racing boats, the tack of the asymmetric is often rigged to a retractable bowsprit, which increases the foretriangle area and prevents interference with the jib. As this trend becomes more popular in racing boats, it may result in similar adaptations to cruising boats as well.|$|E
6000|$|So {{saying he}} sat <b>down,</b> <b>hauled</b> in {{the sheet and}} headed nearer to the wind. [...] "The fellows behind won't see them for some time," [...] he said. [...] "The canoes must be four miles away at least, and I don't suppose they could see each other more than half that distance, being so low in the water. If we had {{just a little more}} wind we should do it nicely." ...|$|R

50|$|Once {{raised up}} the shaft, the coal was yarded or emptied into wagons; each of 1 t capacity. Loaded wagons were run in pairs down a {{self-acting}} inclined plane railway (two loaded wagons going <b>down</b> <b>hauled</b> another two emptied ones up). They were then pushed by hand, assisted by gravity, along a graded wooden trestle. It crossed a sandy area, now occupied by Hunter Street and the Great Northern Railway, to a loading staith at which small ships could berth while coal was tipped into their holds.|$|R
