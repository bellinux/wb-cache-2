When Svenska Cupen began in March, he was first-choice as left-back and played two games in the group stage. IFK Göteborg later won the cup against Djurgården in the final. <b>Just</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> <b>weeks</b> {{before the start of}} 2013 Allsvenskan, he picked up a knee injury while playing for Sweden U21 which kept him out of action for five months.

The second season's premiere was watched by 28.4 million viewers. The episode drew in the second largest audience for the series in its history. However, several critics started to notice a declining quality of the show's script, and USA Todays Robert Bianco suggested that {{the part of the}} series getting [...] "less good" [...] was that showrunner Cherry had left much of the series writing in the hands of others. Midway through the season executive producer Michael Edenstein left the show due to conflicts with Cherry and in May 2006, <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> <b>weeks</b> prior to the second-season finale, so did Tom Spezialy. After the end of the season, Cherry agreed that the second year's script had been weaker and also agreed that it had been a mistake to let go too much of the show. He now stated that he was back full-time, claiming that both he and the writing staff had learned from their mistakes.|$|E
