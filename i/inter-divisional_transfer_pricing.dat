40|$|This paper {{contributes}} to the empirical literature on the <b>transfer</b> <b>pricing</b> behavior of multinational firms. Previous research mainly focuses on <b>transfer</b> <b>pricing</b> {{as a means of}} tax optimization. Our approach concentrates on <b>transfer</b> <b>pricing</b> as a critical compliance issue. Specifically, we investigate whether and to what extent the awareness of <b>transfer</b> <b>pricing</b> as a tax compliance issue responds to country and industry characteristics as well as firm-specifics. Empirically, the <b>transfer</b> <b>pricing</b> risk awareness is measured as a professional assessment reported by the person with ultimate responsibility for <b>transfer</b> <b>pricing</b> in their company. Based on a unique global survey conducted by a Big 4 accounting firm in 2007 and 2008, we estimate the number of firms reporting <b>transfer</b> <b>pricing</b> being the largest risk issue with regard to subsequent tax payments.

40|$|The {{main purpose}} of this paper is to explore the issue of enterprise's <b>transfer</b> <b>pricing</b> which has been noticed by tax administrations of many nations in recent years. The academia has also striven to develop models for {{interpreting}} <b>transfer</b> <b>pricing</b> and assessing <b>transfer</b> <b>pricing</b> profit of enterprises. A precise model is applied in this study to interpret enterprise's <b>transfer</b> <b>pricing</b> in practice. Furthermore, this model is also used to assess the <b>transfer</b> <b>pricing</b> profit of listing/OTC electronics companies in Taiwan and study the factors affecting <b>transfer</b> <b>pricing</b> profit. The empirical results show that material expense ratio significantly impacts <b>transfer</b> <b>pricing</b> profit. Corporate income tax expenses are positively and significantly correlated with net incomes of corporate <b>transfer</b> <b>pricing</b> transactions. This study also finds that regardless of whether the net income of corporate <b>transfer</b> <b>pricing</b> transactions is high, medium, or low, the proportion of material costs is positively and significantly correlated with the net income of corporate <b>transfer</b> <b>pricing</b> transactions in all scenarios. Higher profit will be affected by exchange rate. This suggests that companies involved in wafer fabrication, IC packaging and testing, and DRAM packaging and testing (subcontractors with relatively low material costs) are less likely to be involved in <b>transfer</b> <b>pricing</b> decisions. <b>Transfer</b> <b>pricing,</b> quantile regression, net income model, F 23...|$|R

40|$|This chapter {{reviews the}} recent {{economic}} literature on <b>transfer</b> <b>pricing.</b> As a starting point, we take Hirshleifer's <b>transfer</b> <b>pricing</b> model {{and discuss the}} basic structure of the most widely used model extensions. We review <b>transfer</b> <b>pricing</b> models with asymmetric information, <b>transfer</b> <b>pricing</b> models in incomplete contracting settings, strategic <b>transfer</b> <b>pricing</b> models, and international <b>transfer</b> <b>pricing</b> models with firms operating in different tax jurisdictions. The results offer a rich set of different explanations for the wide variety of <b>transfer</b> <b>pricing</b> methods in practice but they also show {{that it is impossible to}} give a general recommendation about “the” best <b>transfer</b> <b>pricing</b> method. By contrast, only limited progress has been made in arriving at a sufficient theory of decentralization.

We conclude that the economic <b>transfer</b> <b>pricing</b> research has certainly improved the understanding of the relative usefulness of alternative <b>transfer</b> <b>pricing</b> methods for a carefully selected set of assumptions.

Lastly, it aims at evaluating the relationship between <b>transfer</b> <b>pricing</b> determinants and <b>transfer</b> <b>pricing</b> methods and at discovering a means of predicting the latter from the company's perception of the relative importance of these determinants. To achieve the above objectives, an empirical study covering both domestic and international markets was undertaken in UK companies. The conclusions are concerned with <b>transfer</b> <b>pricing</b> policy, methods currently used, and problems apparent in practice. The overall ranking-by survey respondents of the <b>transfer</b> <b>pricing</b> determinants is given as well as the results of tests of certain hypotheses which relate to this ranking. The <b>transfer</b> <b>pricing</b> determinants used in the survey for domestic and international. markets (twelve and twenty respectively) have been reduced by Factor Analysis to four and six factors. The study made use of the results to obtain measures of the ranking of discovered factors.

40|$|<b>Transfer</b> <b>pricing</b> is a {{significant}} taxation problem facing both tax authorities and multinational enterprises. Tax authorities around the world regulate <b>transfer</b> <b>pricing</b> through tax legislation, which requires that cross-border transactions within multinational enterprises be at arm’s-length. A number of countries {{in the international community}} have amended their <b>transfer</b> <b>pricing</b> tax legislation to be prescriptive by including regulations in their legislation on how to transact at arm’slength price. This research study presents an argument that the South African <b>transfer</b> <b>pricing</b> tax legislation is non-prescriptive as it does not have regulations on how to transact at arm’s-length price. With reference to the <b>transfer</b> <b>pricing</b> guidelines issued by the Organisation of Economic Development and Corporation and the experience of the United States of America in the enforcement of <b>transfer</b> <b>pricing,</b> this research study examines whether or not the South African <b>transfer</b> <b>pricing</b> tax legislation should be amended to be prescriptive by including regulations on how to transact at arm’slength price. The research findings reveal that to a certain extent the South African <b>transfer</b> <b>pricing</b> tax legislation is consistent with the <b>transfer</b> <b>pricing</b> guidelines issued by the Organisation of Economic Development and Corporation, but to a certain extent it is not. The research findings also reveal that non-prescriptive legislation has in the past created a problem in certain countries. Furthermore, the research findings reveal through an analysis of the United States of America’s <b>transfer</b> <b>pricing</b> enforcement experience, that prescriptive <b>transfer</b> <b>pricing</b> tax legislation in a tax system has a positive impact.

40|$|The {{aim of this}} master {{thesis is}} to {{investigate}} {{if there is a}} need for <b>transfer</b> <b>pricing</b> in Norwegian hospitals, and which <b>transfer</b> <b>pricing</b> methods should be considered if such a need exists. As divisions in Norwegian hospitals are not always committed to reimburse goods or services provided by other divisions, some divisions have the opportunity to increase production, and potentially improve their operating profit, without compensating other divisions taking part in production. As internal firm inefficiency may result, this serves as the background for the thesis work. The thesis first builds a theoretical framework from literature findings on <b>transfer</b> <b>pricing</b> to identify both potential advantageous, and disadvantageous arguments of <b>transfer</b> <b>pricing.</b> In addition, the thesis identifies and discusses available <b>transfer</b> <b>pricing</b> methods. A qualitative research design is chosen, and semi-structured interviews used to explore the theoretical framework and choice of <b>transfer</b> <b>pricing</b> method. Three potential advantages of <b>transfer</b> <b>pricing</b> are identified; a more well-functioning internal market (the economic argument), improved quality (the organizational argument) and improved monitoring and control due to increased quality of data (the evaluational argument). One potential disadvantage of <b>transfer</b> <b>pricing</b> is identified: the cost of developing, implementing and operating the <b>transfer</b> <b>pricing</b> system (the functional argument). The main conclusion of the thesis is that the decision to implement a <b>transfer</b> <b>pricing</b> system in a hospital will depend on the sum of the relevant advantageous and disadvantageous arguments of <b>transfer</b> <b>pricing,</b> and that the advantageous economic argument and disadvantageous functional argument are the main arguments affecting this decision. In addition, it is concluded that a <b>transfer</b> <b>pricing</b> system must involve a mechanism that secures the longevity of the economic argument.

40|$|The {{question}} of {{the management of the}} transfer process and <b>transfer</b> <b>pricing</b> is an important one for managers and academics alike (Colbert and Spicer, 1995). Yet, in general, our current knowledge on several aspects of <b>transfer</b> <b>pricing</b> process is limited. One question which arises in relation to <b>transfer</b> <b>pricing</b> in service organizations is whether there is an association between the <b>transfer</b> <b>price</b> and the internal customer&# 039;s perception of value emanating from the transaction. An inappropriate <b>transfer</b> <b>pricing</b> system can give rise to a number of adverse effects which can include among other things, maldistribution of economic resources, negative motivation for reducing costs (Lesser, 1987), lack of goal congruence and inequitable performance evaluation (Cravens and Shearon, 1997). The gap in the literature on <b>transfer</b> <b>pricing</b> in the service sector applies equally in the Australian setting. This is despite the significant and increasing contribution of the service sector to both GDP and employment. The objective of this research is to explore the domestic <b>transfer</b> <b>pricing</b> practices of service organisations in Australia with the emphasis placed on examining whether, in internal transactions, the domestic <b>transfer</b> <b>price</b> had any influence on the value perceived by the internal buyer. Because the extant <b>transfer</b> <b>pricing</b> theories cannot explain the value perceived by the internal customer in internal exchange of goods and services, an exploratory research methodology is adopted and no assumptions are made about the relationship. PDF created with pdfFactory trial version www. pdffactory. com 3 Data were gathered from survey responses from eighty service organisations and thirteen face-to-face interviews. Survey data were sought at two levels. Questions of a strategic nature were directed to corporate management while questions pertinent to <b>transfer</b> <b>pricing</b> and value were sought from the divisional management who are actually involved in such transfers. Exploratory factor analysis was used to analyze the data. The findings indicate that cost-based <b>transfer</b> <b>pricing</b> was the most preferred method, and in internal transactions, and responsiveness of the internal supplier was the key factor for internal buyers. The research found that service organisations are external customer oriented and internal customer issues are secondary. The research results also demonstrate that no significant association exists between <b>transfer</b> <b>pricing</b> and internal customer perceived value. The current research contributes to the <b>transfer</b> <b>pricing</b> literature by providing insights to locus of <b>transfer</b> <b>pricing</b> decisions, <b>transfer</b> <b>pricing</b> methods employed by service organizations in Australia, objectives of <b>transfer</b> <b>pricing</b> systems, conflicts arising during from the <b>transfer</b> <b>pricing</b> process and the role of <b>transfer</b> <b>prices</b> on the value perceived by internal customers.

It extends the decentralized decision-making analysis of <b>transfer</b> <b>pricing</b> {{in the context of}} different tax rates. It adopts and extends Bond 2 ̆ 7 s (1980) model of the decentralized multinational corporation that assumes centralized <b>transfer</b> <b>pricing.</b> The direction of <b>transfer</b> <b>price</b> change is as expected, while the magnitude of change is likely to be less than predicted by the Horst (1971), centralized decision-making model. The paper extends the model further by assuming negotiated <b>transfer</b> <b>pricing,</b> where the analysis is partitioned into perfect and imperfect information cases. The negotiated <b>transfer</b> <b>pricing</b> result reverts to the Horst (1971), or centralized decision-making, result, under perfect information. Under imperfect information, the centralized decision-making result obtains when top management successfully informs division general managers or it successfully implements a non-monetary reward scheme to encourage division general managers to cooperate. Under simplifying assumptions, centralized decision-making dominates decentralized decision-making, while negotiated <b>transfer</b> <b>pricing</b> weakly dominates centralized <b>transfer</b> <b>pricing...</b>|$|R
40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} {{the use of}} <b>transfer</b> <b>pricing</b> as a strategic device in divisionalized firms facing duopolistic <b>price</b> competition. When <b>transfer</b> <b>prices</b> are observable, both firms' headquarters will exclude their marketing division from the external input market and charge a <b>transfer</b> <b>price</b> above the market price of the intermediate product to induce their marketing managers to behave as softer competitors on the final product market. When <b>transfer</b> <b>prices</b> are not observable, strategic <b>transfer</b> <b>pricing</b> is not an equilibrium, and the optimal <b>transfer</b> <b>price</b> equals the market price of the intermediate product. As an alternative, the firms can signal their competitor a <b>transfer</b> <b>price</b> above the market price of the intermediate input through a proper choice of their accounting system. The paper identifies conditions under which the choice of absorption costing is a dominant strategy for both firms. Moreover, when the firms' products are close substitutes, the strategic benefits of full cost based <b>transfer</b> <b>pricing</b> can provide incentives to maintain a production department {{that would not be}} able to survive as a separate firm in the long run...|$|R
