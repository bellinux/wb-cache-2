40|$|Previous {{research}} of the authors pointed out that side-resonators {{can be applied to}} reduce fan noise. However, the noise reduction capabilities of most resonator geometries, e. g. tube resonators, cylindrical resonators (cylindrical air layers) and circular resonators (disc shaped air layers), are relatively narrow banded. This is disadvantageous in case resonators are used in combination with a noise source that emits broadband noise or tonal noise at varying frequencies (for instance a speed controlled fan). It was found that the choice of the resonator geometry influences the broadband reduction capabilities (circular resonators offering the best broadband reduction capabilities). In the present study, it is investigated to what extent elliptical resonators, consisting of an elliptically shaped air layer, can be used to achieve broadband noise reduction. A semi-analytical model is proposed that describes the wave propagation in the elliptically shaped air layer. This model is connected to the analytical solution for wave propagation in a tube. The dimensions of the <b>elliptical</b> <b>resonator</b> can be optimized for broadband noise reduction using this model. In addition, an experimental setup was built to verify the semi-analytical model of the <b>elliptical</b> <b>resonator...</b>|$|E

40|$|A {{new design}} of {{circular}} polarized <b>elliptical</b> dielectric <b>resonator</b> antenna (DRA) with single feed for handheld {{radio frequency identification}} (RFID) reader is presented. The <b>elliptical</b> dielectric <b>resonator</b> antenna with an aspect ratio of 1. 5 is used. This design has achieved 66. 7 MHz impedance bandwidth (for S 11 < ‐ 10 dB) by using material with dielectric constant material (εr = 12) in conjunction with coaxial probe feed in free space. The DRA models are simulated using two different numerical techniques, the finite {{element method and the}} finite integral technique. The numerical results of the two different computational methods approach are investigated and compared. The results are in good agreement within the desired frequency band, 5. 65 GHz – 5. 95 GHz. A model for a handheld RFID reader device including the elliptical DRA in the presence of human hand models is, also, investigated. The return loss is < 10 dB over the frequency range of 5. 49 ‐ 6. 967 GHz resulting in frequency bandwidth of 1. 47 GHz. A high front to back ratio and gain of 5. 726 dBi are obtained...|$|R
40|$|Optical microcavities can be {{designed}} {{to take advantage of}} total internal reflection, which results in resonators supporting whispering-gallery modes (WGMs) with a high-quality factor (Q factor). One of the crucial problems of these devices for practical applications such as designing microcavity lasers, however, is that their emission is nondirectional due to their radial symmetry, in addition to their inefficient power output coupling. Here we report the design of <b>elliptical</b> <b>resonators</b> with a wavelength-size notch at the boundary, which support in-plane highly unidirectional laser emission from WGMs. The notch acts as a small scatterer such that the Q factor of the WGMs is still very high. Using midinfrared (λ ∼  10  μm) injection quantum cascade lasers as a model system, an in-plane beam divergence as small as 6  deg with a peak optical power of ∼ 5  mW at room temperature has been demonstrated. The beam divergence is insensitive to the pumping current and to the notch geometry, demonstrating the robustness of this resonator design. The latter is scalable to the visible and the near infrared, thus opening the door to very low-threshold, highly unidirectional microcavity diode lasers...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—In {{this paper}} the {{classical}} boundary value approach employing {{the separation of}} variable technique is {{used to analyze the}} properties of elliptic dielectric resonator antennas. In this approach, the fields inside the resonator are expanded in terms of Mathieu and modified Mathieu functions. Numerical results are given for resonant frequencies of different modes as well for fields distribution inside the resonator. Series Green’s functions are used to calculate the fields inside the cavity and also far field patterns for a given feed. Using the Green’s function method provides more accurate results compared to a pure cavity model technique. The analysis and design are verified through numerical simulations. A parametric study has been performed to show effects of the <b>elliptical</b> dielectric <b>resonator</b> antennas (EDRAs) parameters on far field patterns. 1...|$|R

40|$|Modern {{electromagnetic}} {{problems are}} becoming increasingly complex and their simulation {{must take into account}} geometrical features that are both large and small compared to the wavelength of interest. These multi-scale problems lead to a heavy computational burden in a discretised computational simulation approach since the small features require fine mesh {{to be used in the}} simulation, resulting in large run time and memory storage. To overcome such problems, this thesis presents an efficient and versatile method for embedding small features into an otherwise coarse mesh. The embedded model eliminates the need for discretising the small features and allows for a relative large mesh size to be used, thus saving the computational costs. The subject of the thesis is embedding a thin film as a small feature into the numerical Transmission Line Modelling (TLM) method, although any small feature with known analytical response can be implemented in practice. In the embedded model, the thin film is treated as a section of transmission line, whose admittance matrix is used to describe the frequency response of the thin film. The admittance matrix is manipulated by expanding the constituent cotangent and cosecant functions analytically, and then transforming them from the frequency domain to the time domain using the inverse Z transform and general digital filter theory. In this way the frequency responses of the thin film are successfully embedded into the TLM algorithm. The embedded thin film model can be applied to both single and multiple thin film layers. The embedded thin film model has been implemented in the one-dimensional (1 D) and two-dimensional (2 D) TLM method in the thesis. In the 1 D TLM method, the embedded thin film model is used to investigate the reflection and transmission properties of lossy,anisotropic and lossless thin films, e. g. carbon fibre composite (CFC) panels, titanium panels, antireflection (AR) coatings and fibre Bragg gratings (FBG). The shielding performance of CFC panels is also discussed. In the 2 D TLM method, the embedded thin film model is extended to model arbitrary excitations and curved thin films. The electromagnetic behaviour of infinitely long CFC panels with oblique incidence and a CFC panel of finite length with a point source excitation are studied using the embedded thin film model. The resonant effects of CFC circular and <b>elliptical</b> <b>resonators</b> and the shielding performance of a CFC airfoil with the profile of NACA 2415 are investigated using the embedded curved thin film model. In addition, the effects of small gaps in the airfoil structure on the shielding performance are also reported. All the examples discussed in the thesis have validated the accuracy, stability, convergence and efficiency of the embedded thin film model developed. At the same time, the embedded thin film model has been proven to have the advantage of significantly saving computational overheads...|$|R
50|$|In hollow metal waveguides {{and optical}} waveguides {{there are an}} {{unlimited}} number of other transverse modes that can occur. However, the TEM mode cannot be supported since it requires conductors to propagate. The transverse modes are classified as either transverse electric (TE) or transverse magnetic (TM) (also called respectively H and E modes) according to whether, respectively, all of the electric field, {{or all of the}} magnetic field is transverse. There is always a longitudinal component of one field or the other. The exact mode is identified by a pair of indices counting the number of wavelengths or half-wavelengths along specified transverse dimensions (for instance TE10). The exact definition depends on whether the waveguide is rectangular, circular, or <b>elliptical.</b> For waveguide <b>resonators</b> a third index is introduced to the mode for wavelengths in the longitudinal direction.|$|R
40|$|In {{the last}} decade, mobile {{communication}} has spread widely {{and become an}} essential tool in every day’s life. A tremendous increase in the demand of small Personal Mobile Devices (PMD) has been observed with wide model ranges and applications. This necessitates the design of low profile and compact antennas that can be accommodated in the smaller PMD sizes. This thesis focuses on designing low profile Circularly Polarised (CP) antennas that can be incorporated with these devices. Two types of circularly polarised antennas have been considered; Dielectric Resonator Antennas (DRA) and planar open loop antennas backed by an Artificial Magnetic Conductor (AMC) ground plane. The Elliptical DRA has been considered owing to the simplicity of achieving CP radiation compared to a cylindrical DRA. Several EDRAs have been designed employing a simple conformal strip excitation mechanism. The designed antennas include single and dual band, {{as well as a}} wideband CP DRAs. In addition, a low profile <b>elliptical</b> dielectric <b>resonator</b> antenna has been designed using a dielectric constant of ε_r= 25. Extremely lower profile CP loop antennas have been designed by incorporating the Artificial Magnetic Conductor (AMC) as a ground plane. Two excitation mechanisms have been employed; the Co-Planar waveguide and the vertical probe feed. A total antenna’s thickness of λ_o⁄ 48 has been achieved for the probe-fed loop antenna compared to λ_o⁄ 21. 2 that has been reported in the literature and incorporated the square patch AMC. Two artificial magnetic conductor surfaces have been designed; the traditional square patch and a novel AMC. The novel AMC has reduced the antenna’s size by ~ 28 % compared to other antennas, incorporated the square patch AMC given the same thickness using a 4 × 4 unit cells’ grid. Additionally, a reduction of ~ 45 % has been achieved using a 3 × 3 grid of the novel unit cell with sufficient matching and axial ratio bandwidths. Furthermore, a CP loop antenna backed by the novel AMC out-performs an identical counterpart placed above the traditional square patches AMC with simulated axial ratio bandwidth of ~ 10 %. Moreover, two dual band AMCs are presented, that are suitable for the L 1 and L 2 GPS bands. Once more, a pronounced size reduction of ~ 42 % has been attained using the novel dual band AMC unit cells compared to the double square dual band AMC. Several prototypes have been fabricated with close agreement between simulated and measured results. Some results have been verified using another commercial software, HFSS...|$|R
