40|$|Abstract. In {{the design}} of {{tribology}} pairs, the Rayleigh step bearing {{is known as a}} bearing with the <b>highest</b> <b>load</b> <b>capacity</b> amongst all other possible bearing geometries [1]. This paper mainly discusses a new high-speed bearing with shallow and deep cavities on the inner surface of the bearing, and further the physical phenomena in laminar flow and turbulence regimes was revealed. In doing so, the pressure distribution was calculated first using the continuity equations and then performances in the whole flow domain such as pressure distribution, load-carrying capacity, friction force and friction coefficient were calculated. In addition, a set of optimum geometries are shown to provide the <b>highest</b> <b>load</b> <b>capacity</b> for the Rayleigh step bearing under varied Reynolds number. Finally, associated conclusions were drawn by comparison between results under the coexistence state and under the laminar state...|$|R

40|$|Dionisios VlachosThe {{feasibility}} of a fixed bed separation of HMF and fructose using pelletized zeolites was investigated for applications related to HMF production via fructose dehydration. HMF and fructose isotherms were measured at 25 ??C using the batch method for three different zeolites (13 X, H-BEA 25, and Na-BEA 25). 13 X showed a strong affinity for both fructose and HMF. H-BEA 25 demonstrated <b>high</b> <b>loading</b> <b>capacities</b> for HMF and low <b>loading</b> <b>capacities</b> for fructose, while Na-BEA 25 showed similar <b>loading</b> <b>capacities</b> as the H-BEA 25. Single component breakthrough curves showed that Na-BEA 25 zeolite was the clear-cut {{best choice for}} a separations process. This zeolite showed a <b>high</b> <b>loading</b> <b>capacity</b> and selectivity for HMF in both batch and breakthrough studies.

40|$|A {{predominant}} workflow for qualitative proteomics {{has been}} “GeLCMS,” {{a combination of}} 1 - (or 2 -D) gel electrophoresis with reverse-phase nanoflow liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (nLC-MS/MS). The limited protein quantity isolated from a single gel band coupled with column <b>loading</b> <b>capacity</b> maximums necessitate the use of 75 μm ID packed columns for optimal sensitivity.
