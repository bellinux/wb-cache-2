5|$|Around 1923, Zobel's filter {{designs were}} {{reaching}} {{the peak of}} their complexity. He now had a filter section {{to which he had}} doubly applied the m-derivation process resulting in filter sections which he called the mm'-type. This had all the advantages of the previous m-type, but more so. An even faster transition into the stop-band and an even more constant characteristic impedance in the pass-band. At the same time one side would match into the old m-type, just as the m-type could match into the k-type. Because there were now two arbitrary parameters (m and m') that the filter designer could adjust, much better <b>end</b> <b>matching</b> half-sections could be designed. A composite filter using these sections would have been the very best that could have been achieved at that time. However, the mm'-type sections never became as widespread and well known as the m-type sections, possibly because their greater complexity has deterred designers. They would have been inconvenient to implement with microwave technology and the increased count of components, especially wound components, made them more expensive to implement with conventional LC technology. Certainly, it is hard to find a textbook from any period which covers their design.|$|E

This was not unique, as 24145 had a headcode box similar to those fitted to later batches of Class 25s. In each case, this is likely to be due to collision damage repairs. Some Inverness-based locomotives had 'car lights' fitted to each nose. These were after-market car headlamps mounted in the plated-over nose doors, to provide extra visibility to users of level crossings on sharply curved branch lines. D5114-132 had pairs mounted in each nose. These were removed between 1975/6, with small plates welded over the apertures. 12 Class 26s had similar modifications, some having pairs and others having a single lamp. Examples of Class 37s, Class 47s and a solitary Class 86 had single railway spotlights installed at each end but the Class 24s and Class 26s were the only ones fitted with proper car headlamps.|$|E

30|$|The {{specimens}} {{used were}} heartwood of Japanese cedar (Cryptomeria japonica, hereafter, cedar), heartwood of Japanese larch (Larix kaempferi, hereafter, larch), and beech (Fagus crenata). From these woods, straight grain test specimens of 12  mm (L) ×  6  mm (T) ×  70  mm (R) were prepared [with {{the exception of}} the beech, which was 4  mm (T)]. The partial density variation of cedar and larch is large because of the effect of annual rings. All machining was conducted on early wood: density was measured for each segment of early wood cut out, with the air-dried density of the cedar and larch being 0.31 and 0.35  g/cm 3, respectively. The machining area was not limited for the beech, and the air-dried density of the beech was 0.62  g/cm 3. All specimens were collected with <b>end</b> <b>matching</b> in the grain direction, and all were air-dried specimens having around 10  % moisture content.|$|E
