5|$|Cray had {{intended}} to use gallium arsenide circuitry in the Cray-2, which would not only offer much higher switching speeds but also used less energy and thus ran cooler as well. At the time the Cray-2 was being designed, the state of GaAs manufacturing simply was {{not up to the}} task of supplying a supercomputer. By the mid-1980s, things had changed and Cray decided {{it was the only way}} forward. Given a lack of investment on the part of large chip makers, Cray decided to <b>invest</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> GaAs chipmaking startup, GigaBit Logic, and use them as an internal supplier.|$|E
5|$|The size of {{the market}} determines the {{incentive}} to invest irrespective {{of the nature of}} the economy. This is because entrepreneurs invariably take their production decisions by taking into consideration the demand for the concerned product. For example, if an automobile manufacturer is trying to decide which countries to set up plants in, he will naturally only invest in those countries where the demand is high. He would prefer to <b>invest</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> developed country, where though the population is lesser than in underdeveloped countries, the people are prosperous and there is a definite demand.|$|E

5|$|In 1984, Norsk Flytjenesete started {{negotiations}} with the Sandefjord-based conglomerate Kosmos, who were seeking to <b>invest</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> local airline. Kosmos had decided to start a diversification strategy to spread their risk. Norsk Flytjeneste {{was at the time}} not making money on its routes, but Kosmos was willing to carry the loss as an investment. The airline was sold to Kosmos on 15 April 1985. At the time of the take-over, Norsk Flytjeneste had four Cessna 310s and one Piper Navajo. The airline's seven-passenger Beechcraft 200 and C90 King Airs were already owned by Kosmos. The company was changed from a sole propriatoriship to a limited company. Kjell Riege from Kosmos was appointed managing director while Tor Lundstrøm continued as chief pilot.|$|E
5|$|In 2011 North Kesteven District Council {{produced}} a 25-year strategy to regenerate the town because its rapid growth since the 1990s had outgrown improvements to its infrastructure. It plans future residential developments and outlines ways {{of improving the}} town centre. It suggests developing more parking around the centre and reverting parts the one-way system, developing southern Southgate and turning Money's Yard into an attraction to link with the National Centre for Craft and Design. North Kesteven District Council granted planning permission for a £56m project to redevelop the derelict Bass Maltings site by converting it into residential and retail space and creating about 500 permanent jobs. The development including a supermarket was delayed when the town council opposed a link road through part of the recreation ground. Tesco, who had pledged to <b>invest</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> £20million store in the development withdrew in January 2015 following financial set-backs.|$|E
5|$|It is a {{particularly}} poignant melody that should play with an audience's emotions. The mistress clearly {{knew what she was}} doing sleeping with an older man, and yet there is something expletive about it as well. Eva's bitchiness should be enjoyed by an audience, but they should also be investing in the plight of a young girl's eviction. The narrative of this section is so well structured that it is obvious the journey of the mistress is complete by her exit. This allows the audience to <b>invest</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> single moment while also learning more about Eva and Peron's character as they move forward in the story.|$|E

5|$|Some Scottish kings {{were very}} {{interested}} in the development of cannon, including the unfortunate James II, who was killed by the accidental explosion of one of his own cannon besieging Roxburgh Castle in 1460. Mons Meg, which dates from about the same time, is perhaps the most famous example of a Scottish cannon. James IV was Scotland's first Renaissance figure, who also had a fascination with cannon, both at land and at sea. By 1502, he was able to <b>invest</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> Scottish navy, which was to have a large number of cannon — his flagship, the Great Michael, was launched in 1511, with 36 great guns, 300 lesser pieces and 120 gunners.|$|E
5|$|Tony and Ralph <b>invest</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> race horse named Pie-O-My, {{who wins}} several races {{and makes them}} both {{a great deal of}} money. However, when Ralph's 12-year-old son Justin is {{severely}} injured when an arrow plunges into his chest, Tony comes to believe Ralph burned Pie-O-My in a stable fire to collect $200,000 in insurance money. Tony confronts Ralph the following morning and Ralph denies setting the fire. The two engage in a violent brawl, culminating in Tony strangling Ralph to death. Tony and Christopher dispose of the body; they bury his head and hands at Mikey Palmice's father's farm and throw his body into a quarry.|$|E
5|$|They {{pitched a}} number of live-action ideas to Kanbar and {{proposed}} that he <b>invest</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> development division of their company, paying them and covering their rent {{in exchange for a}} significant portion of the rights to any scripts that they might sell. Kanbar however, was interested in a more direct approach, and preferred to focus on trying to produce a single film. He had always been a great admirer of animation and was impressed after being shown a direct-to-DVD computer-animated short film that Cory had made called Wobots. He suggested the possibility of producing an animated feature with them that would tell a familiar story with a twist, and gave them a month to come up with a story idea. Kanbar had expressed interest in Cinderella or Pinocchio, but the Edwards brothers did not like these ideas as they had already been done by Walt Disney. A few days after the brothers' initial meeting with Kanbar, Todd found inspiration in non-linear crime dramas, such as Rashomon, Pulp Fiction, Run Lola Run, and Memento and came up with the idea of telling the fairy tale Little Red Riding Hood as a police investigation, using multiple points of view.|$|E

5|$|After {{winning the}} league {{championship}} in 1899, Villa's record-breaking average crowd of 21,000 allowed {{the club to}} <b>invest</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> two-stage ground improvement programme. The first stage extended the terrace covering on the Trinity Road side {{at the cost of}} £887; the second cost £1,300 and involved re-laying all terracing around the track to remedy a design flaw that caused poor sightlines {{for the majority of the}} crowd. In 1911, Villa bought the freehold of the ground for £8,250, the office buildings in the old aquarium and car park area for £1,500 and the carriage drive and bowling green for £2,000. This was the first stage in plans drawn up by Villa director Frederick Rinder that saw the capacity of Villa Park increased to 104,000. In June 1914, another phase of enhancements began at Villa Park to compete with improvements at other grounds around the country, including Everton's Goodison Park, where a new two-tiered stand had just been completed. The first stage of improvements saw the cycling track removed, new banking at the Holte Hotel End (Holte End), and a re-profiling of all the terracing to bring it closer to the newly squared-off pitch. Rinder turned to the renowned architect Archibald Leitch to design a new Villa Park. Their joint plans included large banked end stands at the Holte and Witton ends and the incorporation of the original Victorian Lower Grounds buildings, including the aquarium and the newly acquired bowling greens. The outbreak of the First World War severely hampered design and construction efforts.|$|E

25|$|Pit latrines {{are often}} {{relocated}} or re-built after some years (when the pit is full {{and if the}} pit is not emptied) and thus need more space than urine-diverting dry toilets for example and people are less willing to <b>invest</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> nice high-quality super-structure as {{it will have to}} be dismantled at some point.|$|E
