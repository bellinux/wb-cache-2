40|$|Osteomas are {{the most}} common benign bone tumors of {{paranasal}} sinuses. In general, they are small and asymptomatic. They may lead to local symptoms such as nasal obstruction, headache and facial pain when they become large, besides more severe signs and symptoms due to orbital and cranial expansion. The treatment in symptomatic and rapidly-growing cases is surgery. In treatment of paranasal sinus osteomas, endoscopic or open surgical techniques, which may be applied according to mass dimensions and localization, are available. Endoscopic <b>endonasal</b> <b>resection</b> is a safe method with successful results and low morbidity. It causes no cosmetic problems.

40|$|For several decades, the {{exclusive}} {{purpose in the}} management of anterior skull base malignancies has been to increase survival rates. Recently, given the improved prognosis achieved, more attention has been focused on quality of life (QOL) as well. Producing data on QOL in anterior skull base cancers is hampered by the rarity of the neoplasm and the lack of specific questionnaires. The {{purpose of this study was}} to assess health-related QOL in a large and homogeneous cohort of patients affected by anterior skull base cancers who had undergone endoscopic <b>endonasal</b> <b>resection.</b> The authors conducted a retrospective review of patients treated for sinonasal and skull base cancers via an endoscopic endonasal approach at two Italian tertiary care referral centers. All patients were asked to complete the Anterior Skull Base Surgery Questionnaire to evaluate their QOL before and 1 month and 1 year after surgical treatment. To assess which parameters affect QOL, the study population was divided into subgroups according to age, sex, stage of disease, surgical approach, and adjuvant therapy. One hundred fifty-three patients were enrolled in this study according to the adopted inclusion criteria. Overall QOL started at a score of 4. 68 for the preoperative period, sharply decreased as far as a score of 4. 03 during the 1 st postoperative month, and rose again to a score of 4. 59 over the course of 1 year after treatment, with a significant difference among the 3 values (p 60 years (difference of 0. 21 points between the preoperative and 1 -year period, p 0. 1) and T classification of disease at presentation (p > 0. 05).

40|$|AIM: To report our {{experience}} with endoscopic, endonasal management of sinonasal haemangiopericytoma. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Retrospective {{review of the}} medical records of 10 patients undergoing endoscopic, endonasal surgery for sinonasal haemangiopericytoma of the nose and paranasal sinuses, between 1997 and 2008. RESULTS: Five men and five women were included. Their mean age at surgery was 59 years. All patients underwent endoscopic, <b>endonasal</b> <b>resection</b> of their tumour. Major post-operative complications were encountered in only one patient (stroke). Local recurrence was diagnosed in only one patient (10 per cent), who subsequently underwent a combined resection (endoscopic and external) with orbital exenteration. CONCLUSIONS: Sinonasal haemangiopericytomas are rare tumours that are usually benign. The mainstay of treatment is wide surgical excision with free resection margins.

40|$|Background. Our {{aim was to}} {{evaluate}} the efficacy of a bimodal method of treatment consisting in endoscopic resection followed by radiotherapy in patients with olfactory neuroblastoma (ON). Methods. This is a retrospective review on 10 patients with ON treated at a tertiary referral center. All the patients were treated with <b>endonasal</b> endoscopic <b>resection,</b> and 1 refused postoperative radiotherapy. Results. No mortality was observed. Local tumor control was obtained in all the patients. Follow-up ranged from 15 to 79 months (median, 37 months). One patient developed a regional recurrence and for this was treated with bilateral, modified type III radical neck dissection plus radiotherapy on the neck. All patients regained a good quality of life after the treatment. Conclusions.

40|$|We {{report a}} case of a left fronto-temporo-parietal {{subdural}} haematoma that emerged as a complication of an <b>endonasal</b> endoscopic <b>resection</b> of a sinonasal adenocarcinoma of the left ethmoidal region. During the first surgical intervention, following oncological principles, the dura mater above the ethmoidal plate was removed and a skull base plasty was performed. In the post-operative phase a massive cerebrospinal fluid leak was observed and a revision duraplasty was performed the following day. Subsequently the patient was discharged on day 8 with no signs of CSF leakage. At the three month follow-up MR examination a subdural haematoma was observed and then treated by the neurosurgeon in a standard fashion. The collection was quite asymptomatic and discovered accidentally. We strongly advise the role of early post-op neuroimaging in every patient undergoing skull base procedures. We maintain that a massive CSF leak, that causes a significant reduction of intracranial pressure, should be managed as a surgical emergency, {{in order to reduce the}} risk of subdural haematoma...|$|R
40|$|Objective. Management of {{symptomatic}} osteomas {{involving the}} frontal sinus is challenging. Traditional external approaches {{have been used}} in the surgical management of these lesions. Recently, endonasal endoscopic surgery has become a valid alternative to the traditional external approach in selected cases. Method of study. Retrospective evaluation of the patients with symptomatic fronto-ethmoidal osteomas surgically managed in the last 10 years at a tertiary care facility. Results: Twenty-six osteomas involving the frontal sinus were treated surgically. In 11 cases a purely endoscopic approach was performed while in 13 patients a combined procedure was used. In two patients, an exclusively external procedure was performed. No osteoma recurrence has been observed yet (mean follow up: 40 +/- 31. 75 SD months).

40|$|Traditional {{approaches}} for the resection of tumors that involve the anterior cranial base used facial and scalp incisions, a craniotomy, and facial osteotomies. These approaches required frontal lobe retraction and sometimes resulted in cosmetic and functional deficits.

40|$|Background. Purely ectopic {{pituitary}} adenomas are exceedingly rare. Here {{we report}} on a patient that presented with an incidental clival mass {{thought to be a}} chordoma. <b>Endonasal</b> <b>resection,</b> tumor pathology, and endocrinology workup revealed a prolactinoma. Case Presentation. A 41 -year-old male presented with an incidental clival lesion presumed to be a chordoma. On MRI it involved the entire clivus, extended laterally to the petroclival junction, and invaded the cavernous sinuses bilaterally, encasing both internal carotid arteries, without direct extension into the sella. Intraoperatively, {{it was clear that the}} tumor originated from the clivus and that the sellar dura was completely intact. Frozen-section pathology was consistent with a pituitary adenoma. Immunostaining was positive for synaptophysin and prolactin with a low Ki- 67 index, suggestive of a prolactinoma. Additional immunohistochemical stains seen in chordomas (EMA, S 100, and Brachyury) and other metastatic tumors were negative. A postoperative endocrine workup revealed an elevated serum prolactin of 881. 3 [*]ng/mL (normal < 20). Conclusions. In conclusion, it is crucial to maintain an extensive differential diagnosis when evaluating a patient with a clival lesion. Ectopic clival pituitary adenomas, although rare, may warrant an endocrinological workup preoperatively as the majority may respond to medical treatment...|$|E
40|$|Here {{we present}} {{the case of}} a 60 -year-old woman with a rare sellar region {{atypical}} teratoid/rhabdoid tumor (AT/RT), complicated by lung metastasis and treated with neurosurgery, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy. The patient had recurrent headache associated with left cavernous sinus syndrome after a previous <b>endonasal</b> transsphenoidal <b>resection</b> for a presumptive pituitary macroadenoma. Pituitary magnetic resonance imaging showed a tumor regrowth in the original location with a haemorrhagic component involving the left cavernous sinus. A near complete transsphenoidal resection of the sellar mass was performed followed by 3 months of stereotactic radiotherapy. Because of a worsening of the general clinical conditions, respiratory failure, and asthenia, the patient underwent a contrast enhanced computer tomography of the whole body which showed the presence of lung metastasis. The histopathological diagnosis on samples from pituitary and lung tissues was AT/RT. The patient survived 30 months after diagnosis regardless chemotherapy. In the adult, the AT/RT should be considered as a possible rare, aggressive, and malignant neoplasm localized in the sella turcica...|$|R
40|$|Objectives. Hemangiopericytoma {{is a rare}} tumor entity {{deriving}} from pericytes. Less than 5 % of hemangiopericytoma occur in the nasal cavity and are characterised by a rather benign nature with low tendency of metastasis. However, as the recurrence rate in the literature ranges from 9. 5 % to 50 %—depending {{on the length of}} followup—a radical surgical resection is considered as the gold-standard treatment. Only a few years ago, a wide external approach, usually via lateral rhinotomy or Caldwell-Luc, was performed. Endoscopic techniques were regarded as appropriate for small low-vascularised tumors only. Methods. We present the case of a 64 -year-old patient with an extended sinonasal hemangiopericytoma, who was successfully treated by an endoscopic controlled <b>endonasal</b> tumor <b>resection</b> after embolisation with Onyx. Further, to support the new treatment option, we review the literature concerning all features of sinonasal hemangiopericytomas and their therapeutical management. Results/Conclusion.

40|$|Solitary extramedullary plasmacytomas are {{isolated}} plasma cell tumors of soft tissue that typically do not metastasize. They are rare and account for 4 % of all plasma cell tumors. To our knowledge, only 14 cases of solitary extramedullary plasmacytomas in the sphenoid sinus have been reported. A 32 -year-old man presented to our department with complaint of ocular {{pain in the}} right eyeball and diplopia. Physical and neurological examinations revealed intact and prompt direct and indirect light reflexes in both pupils and limitation of extraocular muscle movement seen with the lateral gaze of the right eyeball. Magnetic resonance imaging suggested the presence of mucocele or mycetoma, therefore surgical resection was performed with endoscopic endonasal transsphenoidal approach. Histopathology was consistent with plasmacytoma. Systemic work-up did not show any evidence of metastasis and the sphenoid sinus was the sole tumor site, and therefore the diagnosis of solitary extramedullary plasmacytoma was confirmed.

40|$|SummaryAimHemangiopericytomas (HP) {{are rare}} {{perivascular}} neoplasms with variable biological behaviour. The prognosis, by histology alone, is difficult. The clinical course {{of disease and}} the localization of the tumour are of importance. Sinonasal HP is usually of low malignant potential. Currently, a less invasive, endonasal, approach is chosen for resection of such tumours. One case of sinonasal HP treated by endonasal surgery is presented. CaseA 61 -year old man presented with nasal obstruction and stated that he had undergone endonasal surgery elsewhere twice before for “nasal polyps”, 19 and eight years previously. Anterior rhinoscopy revealed a polypoid lesion in the right nasal cavity. CT showed a mass of the right ethmoidal and sphenoidal sinus {{with no sign of}} bone destruction. We performed an endonasal total resection of the tumour. The histological diagnosis was of sinonasal HP. There was no local or remote metastasis. Histological reports of the earlier surgeries were compared and identified the same tumour. ConclusionsThe presented case shows a long-term benign course of recurrent sinonasal HP following <b>endonasal</b> <b>resection.</b> After more invasive approaches, such as lateral rhinotomy, local recurrence has been reported to appear within comparable periods of time. If the tumour is of limited extension, without infiltration of neighbouring structures, it can be removed via an endonasal approach...|$|E
40|$|AbstractObjectiveEsthesioneuroblastoma {{accounted}} for only 6 % of the malignant nasal cavity neoplasms (ENB) is a rare tumor which originates from the olfactory epithelium. ENB’s are locally agresive and can metastasize by lymphatic and hematogenous routes. A patient with the mass on the nasal dorsum was reported in this article. Case historyA 52 –year-old-man {{admitted to the hospital}} with a 3 months history of progressive nasal obstruction, epistaxis and mass on the nasal dorsum. On rhinoscopy, a polypoid mass was seen in the both nasal cavity and intranasal biopsy with local anesthesia was performed. Histopathologic diagnosis of the tumor was Kadish stage B esthesioneuroblastoma. Tumor was excised by using bilateral endoscopic <b>endonasal</b> <b>resection</b> and lateral rhinotomy approach and paranasal radiotherapy performed postoperatively. Ten months after surgery, neck metastasis was occured and patient was underwent neck dissection. Twenteeth months after initial treatment, distant metastasis was identified on the T 10 vertebra and following the cranial and spinal radiotherapy to the neck he was free of local recurrence at follow up 13 months after surgery. ConclusionIt has been known that the metastasis of the ENB to the spinal cord is an uncommon event, and it occurs often years after initial diagnosis. MRI scan is helpful for making the diagnosis, and surgery is the treatment of choice for obtaining diagnostic tissue and debulking the tumor. Radiotherapy is also a mainstay of postoperative treatment...|$|E
40|$|Objective To assess our {{clinical}} experience in treating midline intracranial pathology using minimally invasive surgical techniques. Design Retrospective chart review of patients undergoing endoscopic <b>endonasal</b> <b>resection</b> of clival chordomas. Setting Two tertiary referral centers in Australia and New Zealand. Main Outcome Measures Patients were assessed by intraoperative findings (macroscopic resection rate, tumor size, and operative complications) and clinical outcomes (residual disease, postoperative complications, recurrence rate, and mortality). Results Fourteen patients underwent endoscopic resection of clival chordomas (seven primary, seven revision) {{with a mean}} follow-up of 41. 45 months (3 to 104 months). Macroscopic resection rates were 71 % and 29 %, respectively. Mean operative time was 386 minutes. Overall cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leak rate was 3 / 14 (21 %) and, using the nasoseptal flap, it was 0 / 5 (0 %). Two patients developed late recurrence; one died of disease and one was treated with intensity modulated radiation therapy. Overall mortality was 2 / 14 (14 %). Conclusion Endoscopic resection of clival chordomas is a safe and viable alternative to the traditional open approach. The nasoseptal flap is an excellent method of obtaining a watertight skull base closure. Furthermore, this series highlighted {{the fact that the}} primary attempt at surgery offers the best chance to achieve a total resection.

40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{expanded}} endonasal {{approach of}} the cranio-cervical junction provides comfortable working space while avoiding some of the disadvantages of the transoral route. We report a purely <b>endonasal</b> endoscopic <b>resection</b> of the odontoid process for basilar invagination in a patient with a Chiari type I malformation, without posterior decompression or fusion. CASE REPORT: A 54 -year-old female patient presented with cranial nerve and brainstem deficits. CT and MRI showed a Chiari type I malformation and compression of the medulla by basilar invagination of the odontoid process. The tip of the latter was displaced up to the bulbo-pontine sulcus. The odontoid process was resected via the expanded endoscopic endonasal approach, without additional posterior decompression or fusion. The post-operative course was uneventful, including the absence of velopharyngeal insufficiency. Neurological deficits regressed rapidly. The preoperative cervical pain virtually disappeared. At 9 months follow-up, the patient had normal activity with minimal residual neurological deficits. Post-op dynamic radiography and CT showed stability of the cranio-cervical junction. CONCLUSION: Decompression of the bulbomedullary junction by purely endoscopic transnasal resection of the odontoid process is well tolerated and efficient. Immediate stabilization is not mandatory in all cases of congenital causes of basilar invagination. Peer reviewe...|$|R

40|$|Oral Poster Paper IITheme: Radiation Oncology in Neurosurgical PracticeINTRODUCTION: The endonasal {{endoscopic}} {{approach is}} a widely adopted, safe and effective technique in transsphenoidal pituitary surgery. Delayed post-operative epistaxis is an uncommon but recognized complication. MATERIAL AND METHOD: This is a report of two patients who underwent <b>endonasal</b> endoscopic <b>resections</b> of pituitary tumours. No bleeding was encountered initially, but both patients developed severe epistaxis in the early post-operative periods that required re-operations. The possible cause, surgical treatment and preventive measures were reviewed. RESULTS: Both patients received adrenaline injection of the nasal mucosa which would have caused vasoconstriction of the sphenopalantine artery during the initial operations. The author surmised that delayed haemorrhages may have occurred after the drug-effect had worn off. Re-operation was met with difficulties due to profuse bleeding and poor visibility. Control was achieved by blind coagulation of the arterial origin based on tactile tracing of anatomical landmarks, followed by precise coagulation of the bleeding branches. CONCLUSION: Delayed haemorrhages from the sphenopalantine artery is a potentially life-threatening complication of endoscopic pituitary surgery. The artery should be routinely and preemptively coagulated in the initial surgery to prevent this complication. Initial haemostasis under poor visibility {{can be achieved by}} following simple anatomical landmarks in order to regain surgical control. link_to_OA_fulltex...|$|R
40|$|Recent {{advances}} in endonasal endoscopy have facilitated the surgical {{access to the}} lateral skull base including areas such as Meckel 2 ̆ 7 s cave. This approach has been well documented, however, few studies have outlined transantral specific access to Meckel 2 ̆ 7 s. A transantral approach provides a direct pathway to this region obviating the need for extensive endonasal and transsphenoidal resection. Our aim {{in this study is}} to compare the anatomical perspectives obtained in endonasal and transantral approaches. We prepared 14 cadaveric specimens with intravascular injections of colored latex. Eight cadavers underwent endoscopic endonasal transpterygoid approaches to Meckel 2 ̆ 7 s cave. Six additional specimens underwent an endoscopic transantral approach to the same region. Photographic evidence was obtained for review. 30 CT scans were analyzed to measure comparative distances to Meckel 2 ̆ 7 s cave for both approaches. The endoscopic approaches provided a direct access to the anterior and inferior portions of Meckel 2 ̆ 7 s cave. However, the transantral approach required shorter instrumentation, and did not require clearing of the endonasal corridor. This approach gave an anterior view of Meckel 2 ̆ 7 s cave making posterior dissection more difficult. A transantral approach to Meckel 2 ̆ 7 s cave provides access similar to the endonasal approach with minimal invasiveness. Some of the morbidity associated with extensive <b>endonasal</b> <b>resection</b> could possibly be avoided. Better understanding of the complex skull base anatomy, from different perspectives, helps to improve current endoscopic skull base surgery and to develop new alternatives, consequently, leading to improvements in safety and efficacy...|$|E
40|$|Over {{the past}} decade surgery for sinonasal {{malignancies}} encroaching into the anterior skull base (ASB) has evolved from open craniofacial resection {{to the use of}} minimally invasive transnasal endoscopic approaches. Using these techniques, ASB reconstruction is most often performed in a multilayer fashion with autologous free grafts (fascia lata or iliotibial tract) which leads to the production of abundant nasal crusting in the postoperative months and discomfort for patients. In carefully selected cases, we propose harvesting a flap from the contralateral nasal septum based on the septal branches of the anterior and posterior ethmoidal arteries (Septal Flip Flap, SFF), which can be rotated to resurface the ASB defect. The exclusion criteria for using the SFF were as follows: cases where the tumour extended to both ethmoid complexes; cases where there was nasal septum or planum spheno-ethmoidalis involvement by the disease; cases of sinonasal malignant tumour with multifocal histology. In our tertiary care referral centre, skull base reconstruction using the SFF was performed in four patients; one was affected by ethmoidal teratocarcinosarcoma, one by persistence of sinonasal undifferentiated carcinoma after radio-chemotherapy, another by olfactory cleft esthesioneuroblastoma and the fourth by ethmoidal squamous cell carcinoma. Successful skull base reconstruction was obtained in all four cases without any intra- or post-operative complications. Post-operatively, nasal crusting was significantly reduced with faster healing of the surgical cavity. No recurrences of disease have been observed after a mean follow-up of 15 months. The SFF can be considered as a safe and effective technique for ASB reconstruction with high success rates similar to those obtained with other pedicled flaps. This flap also ensured a faster healing process with reduction of nasal crusting and improvement in {{the quality of life of}} patients in the postoperative period. This technique appears to be a safe and effective option for ASB reconstruction after <b>endonasal</b> <b>resection</b> of sinonasal malignancies in selected cases. Larger case series with a longer follow-up are needed to validate the preliminary results obtained with such an innovative and promising surgical technique...|$|E

40|$|Pneumosinus dilatans (PSD), first {{described}} by Meyes in 1898, is an abnormal dilatation {{of one or}} more of the paranasal sinuses without bony erosion. The term sinus pneumocele indicates the presence of bony erosion. Review of the literature from 1968 to 1992 revealed 24 cases of idiopathic PSD and 17 cases of pneumocele of various paranasal sinuses. PSD occurred most commonly in the frontal sinus. Males were more often affected than females. The average age for males ranged from 16. 5 for the maxillary sinus to 35. 5 years for the sphenoid sinus. Pneumoceles occurred most commonly in the maxillary sinus. The average age for males ranged from 29 years for the frontal sinus and 47 years for the ethmoid sinus. Two patients (1 pneumocele and 1 PSD) had a temporary loss of vision. We report the case of a 37 -year-old mountain climber who experienced temporary loss of vision in his left eye above 3000 m.

Of the patients with functioning adenomas, 87 % improved. 85 % of the patients with visual deficits related to optic nerve compression progressed over time. Most of the patients with complaints of headaches improved (76 %). Surgical complications occurred in 10 % of patients, which included with two carotid lesions, two cerebrospinal fluid leaks, and one death of a patient with a previous history of complications.

40|$|SummaryObjectivesThis study {{analysed}} {{the factors}} influencing {{the risk of}} recurrence following endoscopic repair of CSF leaks of the anterior and middle skull base after endonasal skull base tumour resection. Patients and methodsA retrospective review was conducted on 17 patients operated between May 2007 and December 2010 by <b>endonasal</b> endoscopic <b>resection</b> of anterior or middle skull base tumour who presented an intraoperative CSF leak. Epidemiological data (body mass index [BMI], age, gender) and type of leak (site, size) were studied. ResultsCSF leaks involved {{the roof of the}} ethmoid sinus (one patient), cribriform plate (three), posterolateral wall of the sphenoid sinus (six) or the sella turcica (seven). The CSF leak recurrence rate after the first endoscopic procedure was 29. 4 % (5 / 17). Failures were not influenced by gender, age, BMI or size of the leak. All recurrences involved the sella turcica or the lateral wall of the sphenoid sinus. The success rate after a second endoscopic procedure was 88. 2 %. ConclusionEndonasal endoscopic repair of anterior and middle skull base meningeal injuries after tumour resection is a minimally invasive and effective technique. The main challenge of this method consists of ensuring effective control of the postoperative defect after tumour resection in the sphenoidal region, as this region was the only potential risk factor for recurrence identified in this study...|$|R
40|$|HE transsphenoidal {{approach}} is a well-established method for the surgical removal of intrasellar patho-physiology. 24, 38 Lesions located in the suprasellar space, above the diaphragma sellae with no involvement of the sella turcica, have been traditionally approached through a craniotomy. 3, 8, 14, 36, 43, 45 Recently, several authors have described modifications of the microscope-based transsphenoidal approach that extend its reach past the sella into the suprasellar region. 9, 11, 23, 30 – 32, 34, 40, 46 Another recent modification to the transsphenoidal ap-proach has been {{the use of the}} endoscope for an endonasal mucosa-preserving approach that circumvents the need for the microscope and postoperative nasal packing. 4 – 6, 10, 17, 18, 20, 25, 27, 28, 42, 44, 47 Proponents of this method believe that despite the loss of stereoscopic vision, the field of view is better than that achieved with the microscope because the light source and lens are closer to the lesion. The feasibility of a purely endoscopic extended transsphenoidal approach to remove suprasellar lesions has been reported previously, but few cases have been described in detail. 12, 26 In fact, in a recent study of <b>endonasal</b> endoscopic <b>resections</b> of Rathke cleft cysts, the authors still recommended the transcranial ap-proach to remove cysts that are completely supradiaphrag-matic, without intrasellar extension. 17 For this reason we elected to present our early experience with a purely en-doscopic, endonasal extended transsphenoidal, transtuber-culum transplanum approach in 10 patients with entirely supradiaphragmatic lesions and a normal-sized sella...|$|R
40|$|Background: Sinonasal care after {{endoscopic}} tumor resection aims {{to manage}} crusting, edema, mucus, and a healing cavity. High-volume irrigations have proved beneficial in this setting. The addition of corticosteroid to the irrigation {{is used for}} chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) in modifying the postsurgical inflammatory response; however, its effect in endoscopic sinonasal tumor resection is unknown. Saline alone versus combination saline and corticosteroid irrigations in postoperative nasal care of sinonasal tumor patients was assessed. Methods: A retrospective cohort of patients postendoscopic <b>endonasal</b> tumor <b>resection</b> was assessed. Patients used 240 mL of saline or 240 mL of saline with 1 mg of betamethasone daily. Nasal symptom scores (NSSs) and the 22 -item Sino-Nasal Outcome test (SNOT- 22) was recorded 3 months postoperatively. An endoscopic score {{was made of the}} area undergoing secondary healing at 3 months by two blinded assessors. Results: Fifty-nine patients were assessed (aged 50. 1 ± 18. 26 years; 36 % female subjects). The groups were similar in number (saline n = 31), treatment, and surgical characteristics. The endoscopic scores did not differ between the groups at 3 months. NSS was lower in the saline group (1. 0 [interquartile range {IQR}, 3] versus 7. 0 [IQR, 9]; p = 0. 03) and, similarly, for SNOT- 22 (0. 24 [IQR, 1] versus 1. 09 [IQR, 1]; p = 0. 01) compared with the saline with steroid group. Conclusion: Although corticosteroid irrigations have become routine for managing inflammatory sinus disease at our center, their use after tumor surgery {{does not appear to be}} warranted. The inflammatory healing process after tumor surgery differs from CRS inflammation and may explain the observed findings. 3 page(s...|$|R
40|$|Objective: The aim of {{this study}} was to analyse the results of {{minimally}} invasive endoscopic unilateral transsphenoidal surgery for pituitary adenomas. Methods: A series of 83 patients presenting with a pituitary lesion was reviewed retrospectively. Surgical procedures were performed between February 2007 and December 2010. The extent of resection was evaluated on post-operative contrast-enhanced MRI. We also reviewed our complications and compared them with the literature. Results: Our series included 10 micro- and 73 macro-adenomas, with cavernous sinus invasion in 60. 3 %. Fifty-three per cent were non-secreting. Complete resection of the macro-adenomas was achieved in 22. 5 % of the cases. Complications were as follows: 2 deaths (2. 5 %), 2 sinusitis (2. 5 %), 5 CSF leaks (6. 2 %), 1 meningitis (1. 2 %), 16 post-operative anterior lobe insufficiency (19. 8 %) and 4 persistent diabetes insipidus (4. 9 %). Thirty-seven patients (44. 6 %) presented with a compression of optical pathways with an improvement of visual acuity in 94. 3 %. Conclusions: Purely endoscopic unilateral <b>endonasal</b> transsphenoidal adenoma <b>resection</b> is minimally invasive surgery leading to a good rate of gross total tumour resection and it is associated with a low complication rate.

40|$|Abstract Background Sinonasal {{inverted}} papilloma is a locally aggressive tumor {{arising from the}} Schneiderian membrane which lines the nasal cavity and paranasal sinuses. Aggressive surgical approaches, such as lateral rhinotomy, were used until recently for complete removal of the {{inverted papilloma}}. Currently, endoscopic resection is the gold standard {{in the treatment of}} inverted papilloma. However, there are situations that justify an open approach. For example there are studies that report a higher postoperative recurrence rate after <b>endonasal</b> endoscopic <b>resection,</b> particularly in the treatment of recurrent diseases. While endoscopic resection performed by an experienced surgeon is definitely a minimally invasive therapy, an open approach is not necessarily associated with functional and aesthetic disadvantages. This case report describes the treatment of inverted papilloma by an open approach. This has been described before but the new gold standard of endoscopic resection has {{to be taken into account}} before any treatment decision is made nowadays. Case presentation Contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging of the head and neck area was indicated in a 72 -year-old white German man who presented with suspected squamous cell carcinoma of his lower lip. Magnetic resonance imaging additionally revealed a 3 × 2 cm 2 polycyclic arranged mucosal thickening with cystic and solid contrast affine shares at the antral laterocaudal area of his right maxillary sinus, extending from his right lateral nasal wall to his maxillary sinus floor. He received antral polypectomy with medial maxillectomy via a unilateral LeFort I osteotomy approach. His pterygoid plate was preserved. A histological examination demonstrated a tumor composed of hyperplastic squamous epithelium protruding into the stroma (surface epithelial cells grew downward into the underlying supportive tissue), thus producing a grossly convoluted cerebriform appearance. Two weeks later, the patient regained a well-formed maxilla without any restrictions. He has remained disease-free for 25 months following the surgery and surveillance was continued in our tumor clinic. Conclusions Endoscopic resection of an inverted papilloma continues to be the gold standard. However, some cases require a radical approach. This does not necessarily increase patient morbidity...|$|R
40|$|Objectives: Endoscopic {{technology}} is allowing larger resections of the anterior and middle skull base with resultant dural defects. A pedicled nasal septal flap (NSF) {{based on the}} posterior nasal septal artery has recently been developed for closure of these defects. We describe our initial experience with the NSF for vascularized coverage of skull base defects. Design: Retrospective review. Setting: Tertiary care skull base center. Participants: Patients undergoing endoscopic harvest of vascularized pedicled flap for skull base reconstruction. Results: Twenty-eight patients had 32 NSFs raised over 14 months for benign (7) or malignant (21) lesions. Surgical defects (mean, 4. 95 cm 2) were intracranial (25) and intradural (20, average defect 1. 86 cm 2) in the anterior (10) and central skull base (6), infratemporal fossa (4), orbit (1), {{or a combination of}} sites (9). There were no cases of meningitis or cerebrospinal fluid leak (median follow-up, 8. 3 months). Two NSFs were injured intraoperatively and two necrosed postoperatively, both in patients with a prior history of radiation to the nasopharynx (p[*]=[*] 0. 013). Conclusions: Prior radiation is a risk factor for necrosis. The NSF is easily harvested endonasally, reliably covers a range of skull base defects, and should be considered the first line closure after expanded <b>endonasal</b> skull base <b>resections...</b>|$|R
40|$|Mixed {{pituitary}} adenoma/craniopharyngiomas {{are very}} rare tumors. Their pathogenesis {{is still unclear}} {{and it is not}} known whether they are collision tumors derived from independent stem cells or whether they originate from a single stem cell undergoing divergent differentiation. The latter hypothesis is supported by the close commixture between the two tumor components with transition areas that has been previously described. However, "hybrid" cells with both pituitary adenoma and craniopharyngioma features have never been described. In this paper we report a case of mixed pituitary adenoma/craniopharyngioma observed in a 75 -year-old woman presenting with diplopia and slight increase of serum prolactin, who underwent endoscopic <b>endonasal</b> trans-sphenoidal tumor <b>resection.</b> Histologically, the tumor was composed of a typical pituitary silent subtype 2 ACTH cell adenoma admixed with islands of adamantinomatous craniopharyngioma. Electron microscopy showed that, in addition to distinct silent subtype 2 ACTH and craniopharyngioma cells, there were "hybrid" cells, showing characteristics of both pituitary adenoma and craniopharyngioma, consisting of small dense secretory granules, bundles of cytoplasmic filaments, and desmosomes. This ultrastructural finding was also confirmed by the presence of cells showing nuclear p 40 expression and chromogranin A immunoreactivity. The close commixture between the two components and the ultrastructural and immunohistochemical findings demonstrate a common histogenesis of the two components and support the classification of the neoplasm as a mixed tumor. The patient completely recovered and, 10 months after surgery, head MR confirmed the complete resection of the lesion...|$|R
