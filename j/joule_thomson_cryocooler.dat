The SPICA payload features three instruments, one of which, SAFARI, is developed by a European based consortium. SPICA’s distinctive feature is to use an actively cooled telescope down to 4 K. In addition SPICA is a cryogen-free satellite and all the cooling will be provided by radiative cooling (L 2 orbit) down to 30 K and by mechanical coolers for lower temperatures.

This warm launch approach allows to suppress any large liquid cryogen tank and to use the mass saved to launch a large diameter telescope (3. 5 meters). This 4 K cooled telescope allows significantly reduced thermal radiation, offering superior sensitivity in the infrared region.

40|$|In {{support of}} the {{development}} of a zero gravity pressure control capability for liquid hydrogen, testing was conducted at the Marshall Space Flight Center using the Multipurpose Hydrogen Test Bed (MHTB) to evaluate the effects of helium pressurant on the performance of a spray bar thermodynamic vent system (TVS). Fourteen days of testing was performed in August - September 2005, with an ambient heat leak of about 70 - 80 watts and tank fill levels of 90 %, 50 %, and 25 %. The TVS successfully controlled the tank pressure within a +/- 3. 45 kPa (+/- 0. 5 psi) band with various helium concentration levels in the ullage. Relative to pressure control with an "all hydrogen" ullage, the helium presence resulted in 10 to 30 per cent longer pressure reduction durations, depending on the fill level, during the mixing/venting phase of the control cycle. Additionally, the automated control cycle was based on mixing alone for pressure reduction until the pressure versus time slope became positive, at which time the Joule-Thomson vent was opened. Testing was also conducted to evaluate thermodynamic venting without the mixer operating, first with liquid then with vapor at the recirculation line inlet. Although ullage stratification was present, the ullage pressure was successfully controlled without the mixer operating. Thus, if vapor surrounded the pump inlet in a reduced gravity situation, the ullage pressure can still be controlled by venting through the TVS <b>Joule</b> <b>Thomson</b> valve and heat exchanger. It was evident that the spray bar configuration, which extends almost {{the entire length of the}} tank, enabled significant thermal energy removal from the ullage even without the mixer operating.

40|$|AbstractIt is {{recognized}} {{that most of}} the available geological storage capacity for CO 2 is in saline aquifers. The best aquifers are likely to be in sedimentary basins (and in many cases near to fossil energy sources). However, unless the formations have been explored for hydrocarbon potential, it is likely that little data exists so significant work will be required to evaluate the realistic storage potential. Depleted gas fields offer more limited capacity but are better characterized, have seals that have successfully retained hydrocarbon gas for millions of years, and may offer a shorter route to practical implementation for early projects. Estimates indicate that depleted offshore gas fields in UK waters have the potential to store around 3. 8 billion tonnes of CO 2. This is a significant capacity and an inviting target particularly if existing infrastructure and wells can be reused. This paper explores the issues around injecting and storing CO 2 in highly depleted gas fields using a case study based on the characteristics of a Southern North Sea gas field. The study shows that assessing and managing the flow control aspects of CO 2 injection, particularly initially when the reservoirs are at very low pressure {{is going to be a}} major technical challenge. The challenges include a requirement for a high -tech flow control device at the base of the tubing to allow the dense phase CO 2 to be expanded in a controlled manner. Also the requirement for CO 2 -specific well flow performance software as conventional software, designed to model the flow of hydrocarbons, is not necessarily suffciently rigorous when modeling a complex fluid like CO 2, particularly the thermodynamics aspects.

However, the performance of these devices is still way below its competitor thermal and electrical systems.

Although the use of Silicon as a thermoelectric material greatly improved the performance of new thermoelectric devices over the metal based thermoelectric devices, {{it is still not}} close to the performance level of heat engines or refrigerators. With a limit on the material properties, these devices must be optimized based on all known effects that occur in the thermoelectric devices.

Most of the time, the design of thermoelectric generators and sensors is based on the steady state characteristics, which include only the governing thermoelectric effect (Seebeck effect) into the mathematical model.
