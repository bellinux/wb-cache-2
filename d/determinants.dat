5|$|Adding a {{multiple}} of any row to another row, or {{a multiple}} of any column to another column, {{does not change the}} determinant. Interchanging two rows or two columns affects the determinant by multiplying it by −1. Using these operations, any matrix can be transformed to a lower (or upper) triangular matrix, and for such matrices the determinant equals the product of the entries on the main diagonal; this provides a method to calculate the determinant of any matrix. Finally, the Laplace expansion expresses the determinant in terms of minors, that is, <b>determinants</b> of smaller matrices. This expansion can be used for a recursive definition of <b>determinants</b> (taking as starting case the determinant of a 1-by-1 matrix, which is its unique entry, or even the determinant of a 0-by-0 matrix, which is 1), that can be seen to be equivalent to the Leibniz formula. <b>Determinants</b> can be used to solve linear systems using Cramer's rule, where the division of the <b>determinants</b> of two related square matrices equates to the value of each of the system's variables.|$|E

5000|$|The <b>determinant</b> {{defines a}} mappingbetween {{the group of}} {{invertible}} n × n matrices with entries in R and the multiplicative group of units in R. Since it respects the multiplication in both groups, this map is a group homomorphism. Secondly, given a ring homomorphism f: R → S, there is a map GLn(R) → GLn(S) given by replacing all entries in R by their images under f. The <b>determinant</b> respects these maps, i.e., given a matrix A = (ai,j) with entries in R, the identityholds. For example, the <b>determinant</b> of the complex conjugate of a complex matrix (which is also the <b>determinant</b> of its conjugate transpose) is the complex conjugate of its <b>determinant,</b> and for integer matrices: the reduction modulo m of the <b>determinant</b> of such a matrix {{is equal to the}} <b>determinant</b> of the matrix reduced modulo m (the latter <b>determinant</b> being computed using modular arithmetic).

25|$|One major {{application}} of the matrix theory is calculation of <b>determinants,</b> a central concept in linear algebra. While <b>determinants</b> could be defined in a basis-free manner, they are usually introduced via a specific representation of the mapping; {{the value of the}} determinant does not depend on the specific basis. It turns out that a mapping has an inverse if and only if the determinant has an inverse (every non-zero real or complex number has an inverse). If the determinant is zero, then the nullspace is nontrivial. <b>Determinants</b> have other applications, including a systematic way of seeing if a set of vectors is linearly independent (we write the vectors as the columns of a matrix, and if the determinant of that matrix is zero, the vectors are linearly dependent). <b>Determinants</b> could also be used to solve systems of linear equations (see Cramer's rule), but in real applications, Gaussian elimination is a faster method.|$|E
