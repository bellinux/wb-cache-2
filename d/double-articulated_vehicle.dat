25|$|The Newark Light Rail {{system uses}} a new-model vehicle built by Kinki Sharyo of Japan. This vehicle, {{the same one}} used by the HBLR system, is a <b>double-articulated</b> <b>vehicle</b> with three {{sections}}. Each of the two end sections has an operator's cab at the far end, thus {{eliminating the need for}} the vehicle to turn itself around physically in order to reverse direction. Each end section also has seating for 16 passengers on an upper level, and seating for 13 passengers on the lower level, including one special fold-down seat next to an empty space that a passenger using a wheelchair may use. With these two sections, and a middle section that seats ten passengers (five on each side), the vehicle can comfortably accommodate 68 seated passengers and two wheelchairs. An additional 122 passengers could stand in the vehicle, if necessary. Vehicles can be coupled into two-unit sets. A contract to expand 10 of the 20 LRVs assigned to the Newark Light Rail system for the purpose of increasing passenger capacity was approved on July 9, 2014.|$|E
