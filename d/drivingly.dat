6000|$|Amerigo, meanwhile, after all, {{could clearly}} {{make the most}} of her having enjoined on him to wait--suggested it by the {{positive}} pomp of her dealings with the smashed cup; to wait, that is, till she should pronounce as Mrs. Assingham had promised for her. This delay, again, certainly tested her presence of mind--though that strain was not what presently made her speak. Keep her eyes, for the time, from her husband's as she might, she soon found herself much more <b>drivingly</b> conscious of the strain on his own wit. There was even a minute, when her back was turned to him, during which she knew once more the strangeness of her desire to spare him, a strangeness that had already, fifty times, brushed her, in the depth of her trouble, as with the wild wing of some bird of the air who might blindly have swooped for an instant into the shaft of a well, darkening there by his momentary flutter the far-off round of sky. It was extraordinary, this quality in the taste of her wrong which made her completed sense of it seem rather to soften than to harden and it was the more extraordinary the more she had to recognise it; for what it came to was that seeing herself finally sure, knowing everything, having the fact, in all its abomination, so utterly before her that {{there was nothing else to}} add--what it came to was that, merely by being WITH him there in silence, she felt, within her, the sudden split between conviction and action. They had begun to cease, on the spot, surprisingly, to be connected; conviction, that is, budged no inch, only planting its feet the more firmly in the soil--but action began to hover like some lighter and larger, but easier form, excited by its very power to keep above ground. It would be free, it would be independent, it would go in--wouldn't it?--for some prodigious and superior adventure of its own. What would condemn it, so to speak, to the responsibility of freedom--this glimmered on Maggie even now--was the possibility, richer with every lapsing moment, that her husband would have, on the whole question, a new need of her, a need which was in fact being born between them in these very seconds. It struck her truly as so new that he would have felt hitherto none to compare with it at all; would indeed, absolutely, by this circumstance, be REALLY needing her for the first one in their whole connection. No, he had used her, had even exceedingly enjoyed her, before this; but there had been no precedent for that character of a proved necessity to him which she was rapidly taking on. The immense advantage of this particular clue, moreover, was that she should have now to arrange, alter, to falsify nothing; should have to be but consistently simple and straight. She asked herself, with concentration, while her back was still presented, what would be the very ideal of that method; after which, the next instant, it had all come to her and she had turned round upon him for the application. [...] "Fanny Assingham broke it--knowing it had a crack and that it would go if she used sufficient force. She thought, when I had told her, that that would be the best thing to do with it--thought so from her own point of view. That hadn't been at all my idea, but she acted before I understood. I had, on the contrary," [...] she explained, [...] "put it here, in full view, exactly that you might see." ...|$|E

5000|$|The first {{movement}} is in sonata-allegro form, with an introductory Lento, which returns {{at the end}} in varied form as a coda. The slow movement begins with a twelve-tone row, the intervals of which are related to motives from the first movement. The main theme of the Adagio is also related to the intervals of this row, but is more diatonic in construction. The {{movement is}} in variation form, but the variations are continuous rather than sectional, and are begun in succession by the clarinet, divisi strings, and tuba. The finale is a rondo, and is the most diatonic of the three movements. As is usual with Pistonian finales, it is <b>drivingly</b> rhythmic [...] The impression of a strong [...] "American" [...] sound is produced in this movement by a spaciousness of melodies and textures. The main theme, in C major, spans more than two octaves in jagged fourths, and the secondary theme is marked by jaunty syncopations [...] These jazzlike figures are indebted to up-tempo Broadway cabaret songs. Piston's treatment of them are {{at the same time}} witty and dated. The three movements do not form as satisfactory a symphonic whole as is found in the Fourth and Sixth Symphonies [...]|$|E
40|$|Two input {{members and}} two {{concentric}} rotatable output members are interconnected by a planetary gear arrangement. The first input drives directly the first output. The second input engages a carrier having the planetary gears affixed thereto. Rotation {{of the carriage}} causes rotation of the central sun gear of the planetary gear system. The sun gear is journaled to the carriage and is <b>drivingly</b> connected to the second output through a direction reversing set of bevel gears. The first input drive member includes a ring gear <b>drivingly</b> connected to the planetary gears for driving the second output member {{in the same direction}} and by the same amount as the first output member. Motion of the first input results in equal motion of the two outputs while input motion of the second input results in movement of the second output relative to the first output.

40|$|Numerous {{incidents}} of fire, explosion, and ground contamination have occurred at various facilities {{over the last}} several years due to drum rupture on account of overpressurization. These incidents frequently are caused by an ignition source or a reaction between incompatible materials. The incidents may also occur simply as a result of climatic changes causing the drum to be over pressurized. A device for venting a container having a bung includes a saddle assembly securable to a container and having a support extending therefrom. A first arm is rotatably secured to the support, and the first arm extends in a first direction. A second arm has a first end portion <b>drivingly</b> engaged with the first arm, so that rotation of the first arm causes rotation of the second arm. A second end portion of the first arm is positionable proximate the bung of the container. A socket is operably associated and rotatable with the second end portion and is <b>drivingly</b> engageable with the bung, so that rotation of the socket causes corresponding rotation of the bung for thereby venting the container...|$|E

40|$|This {{invention}} {{relates to}} an apparatus for producing filament, fiber, ribbon or film from a molten material, comprising a preferably heat extracting crucible which contains {{a pool of}} molten material at a selected horizontal level in the pool. The crucible has an opening extending from above the free surface level to a bottom edge of the opening, the bottom edge being sufficiently below the free surface level so that the molten material cannot form and hold a meniscus by surface tension between the edge {{and the level of}} the free surface and further comprises a heat extracting substrate laterally disposed with respect to the crucible and which rotates about an axis of rotation. The substrate is positioned adjacent the edge of the opening which confines the molten material and prevents it from overflowing downwardly out of the crucible. The invention features rotating means which includes a first drive means for tiltably rotating the crucible about an axis of rotation which is coaxial with the axis of rotation of the substrate, so the crucible edge can be maintained a predetermined constant distance from the substrate. The distance chosen is suitable for depositing molten material on the substrate and the apparatus also has a second drive means which is <b>drivingly</b> connected to the substrate for continuously moving the surface of the substrate upwardly past the edge and a melt front formed at the interface of the molten material and the substrate surface...|$|E
