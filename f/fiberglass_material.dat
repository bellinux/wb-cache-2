5000|$|A further {{alternative}} {{that has been}} implemented at the laboratory stage is by {{the application of a}} high bias at the anode but by pickup of the signals from the cathode at floating ground, as shown in the [...] Concentric electrodes (E2, E3, E4) are made on a copper-coated fiberglass printed circuit board (PCB) and a copper wire (E1) is added {{at the center of the}} disk. The anode is made again from the same PCB with a conical hole (400 micrometres) to act as a pressure limiting aperture in the ESEM. The exposed <b>fiberglass</b> <b>material</b> inside the aperture cone together with its surface above are coated with silver paint in continuity with the copper material of the anode electrode (E0), which is held at high potential. The cathode electrodes are independently connected to ground amplifiers, which, in fact, can be biased with low voltage directly from the amplifier power supplies in the range of ±15 volts without any further coupling required. On account of the induction mechanism operating behind the GDD, this configuration is equivalent to the previous diagram, except for the inverted signal that is electronically restored. While electrode E0 is held at 250 V, meaningful imaging is done as shown by a [...] with composition of signals from various electrodes at two pressures of supplied air. All images show part of the central copper wire (E1), exposed fiber-glass (FG, middle), and copper (part of E2) with some silver paint used to attach the wire. The close resemblance of (a) with (b) at low pressure and (c) with (d) at high pressure is a manifestation of the principle of equivalence by induction. The purest SE image is (e) and the purest BSE is (h). Image (f) has prevailing SE characteristics, whilst (g) has a comparable contribution of both SE and BSE.

40|$|Abstract-The aim of {{this review}} paper is to {{represent}} a general study on the design, analysis of leaf spring. The suspension system in a vehicle significantly affects the behavior of vehicle, i. e. vibration characteristics including ride comfort, stability etc. Leaf springs are commonly used in the vehicle suspension system and are subjected to millions of varying stress cycles leading to fatigue failure. A lot of {{research has been done}} for improving the performance of leaf spring. Now the automobile industry has shown interest in the replacement of steel spring with composite leaf spring. In general, it is found that <b>fiberglass</b> <b>material</b> has better strength characteristic and lighter in weight as compare to steel for leaf spring. In this paper there is reviewed some papers on the design and analysis leaf spring performance and fatigue life prediction of leaf spring. There is also the analysis of failure in leaf spring. Also the analysis of leaf spring with ansys is done. The automakers can reduce product development cost and time while improving the safety, comfort, and durability of the vehicles they produce. The predictive capability of CAE tools has progressed to the point where much of the design verification is now done using computer simulation rather than physical prototype testing...|$|E
40|$|In many {{analyses}} of wind turbine blades, {{the effects of}} mean stress on the determination of damage in composite blades are either ignored completely or they are characterized inadequately. Mandell, et al [1] have recently presented an updated Goodman diagram for a <b>fiberglass</b> <b>material</b> that {{is typical of the}} materials used in wind turbine blades. Their formulation uses the MSU/DOE Fatigue Data Base [2] to develop a Goodman diagram with detailed information at thirteen R-values. Using these data, linear, bi-linear and full Goodman diagrams are constructed using mean and “ 95 / 95 ” fits to the data. The various Goodman diagrams are used to predict the failure stress for coupons tested using the WISPERX spectrum [3]. Three models are used in the analyses. The first is the linear Miner’s rule commonly used by the wind industry to predict failure (service lifetimes). The second is a nonlinear variation of Miner’s rule which computes a nonlinear Miner’s Sum based upon an exponential degradation parameter. The third is a generalized nonlinear residual strength model that also relies on an exponential degradation parameter. The results illustrate that Miner’s rule does not predict failure very well. When the mean Goodman diagram is used, the nonlinear models predict failures near the mean of the experimental data, and when the 95 / 95 Goodman diagram is used, they predict the lower bound of the measured data very well...|$|E
