40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} {{the design of a}} <b>Hall</b> <b>plate</b> {{magnetic}} field readout system, and it encompasses the design of both the sensing element and the subsequent preamplifier. The actual sensor is a <b>Hall</b> <b>plate</b> realized in a standard CMOS digital process, exploiting its N-Well diffusion.

The preamplifier is a current feedback instrumentation amplifier; it employs input transconductors in order to achieve a high CMRR and PSRR, and a class AB push-pull output stage, which is able to supply high output currents. Moreover, the amplifier is part of a nested-chopper architecture, which is merged with the spinning current technique, in order to reduce as much as possible the residual offset and flicker noise.

40|$|A {{nonlinear}} single-particle {{model is}} introduced, which captures the characteristic of {{systems in the}} quantum Hall regime. The model entails the magnetic Shrödinger equation with spatially variable magnetic flux density. The distribution of flux is prescribed via the postulates of the mesoscopic mechanics (MeM) introduced in my previous articles [cf. J. Phys. Chem. Solids, 65 (2004), 1507 - 1515; J. Geom. Phys., Vol. 55 / 1 (2005), 1 - 18]. The model is found to imply exact integer and fractional quantization of the Hall conductance. In fact, Hall resistance {{is found to be}} R_H = h/ 2 e^ 2 M/N at the filling factor value N/M. The assumed geometry of the <b>Hall</b> <b>plate</b> is rectangular. Special properties of the magnetic Shrödinger equation with the mesoscopic feedback loop allow us to demonstrate quantization of Hall resistance as a direct consequence of charge and flux quantization.

For a gyrator, the ratio between short-circuit input resistance and open-circuit input resistance is always greater then unity. The antireciprocity of the Hall transducer is a natural phenomenon and its results from investigation of transfer resistances. Is known that for a certain value of magnetic induction, in general, transfer resistances are not equal. In other words, Hall transducer is a passive non-reciprocal circuit. In certain circumstances, however, when <b>Hall</b> <b>plate</b> does have voltage zero, (constructively, electrodes are disposed on the same equipotential surface with zero inductance) transfer resistances are equal in value, but have opposite sign.

40|$|The Large Hadron Collider (LHC), a {{particle}} accelerator aimed at exploring deeper into matter than ever before, {{is currently being}} constructed at CERN. Beam optics of the LHC, requires stringent control of the field quality of about 8400 superconducting magnets, including 1232 main dipoles and 360 main quadrupoles to assure the correct machine operation. The measurement challenges are various: accuracy on the field strength measurement up to 50 ppm, harmonics in the ppm range, measurement equipment robustness, low measurement times to characterize fast field phenomena. New magnetic measurement systems, principally based on analog solutions, have been developed at CERN to achieve these goals. This work proposes the introduction of digital technologies to improve measurement performance of three systems, aimed at different measurement target and characterized by different accuracy levels. The high accuracy measurement systems, based on rotating coils, exhibit high performance in static magnetic field. With varying magnetic field the system accuracy gets worse, independently from coil speed, due to the limited resolution of the digital integrator currently used, and the restrictions of the standard analysis. A new integrator based on ADC conversion and numerical integration is proposed. The experimental concept validation by emulating the proposed approach on a PXI platform is detailed along with the improvements {{with respect to the}} old integrators. Two new analysis algorithms to reduce the errors in dynamic measurements are presented. The first combines quadrature detection and short time Fourier transform (STFT) of the acquired magnetic flux samples; the second approach is based on the extrapolation of the magnetic flux samples. Unlike other algorithms presented in the literature, both the proposals do not require the information about the magnet current and are able to work in real time so, can be easily implemented in firmware on DSP. The performance of the new proposals are assessed in simulation. As far as medium accuracy systems are concerned, at CERN was originally developed a probe to measure the sextupolar and decapolar field harmonics of the superconducting dipoles using a suitable Hall plates arrangement for the bucking of the main dipolar field, which is, 4 orders of magnitude higher than the measurement target. The output signals of each <b>Hall</b> <b>plate</b> belonging to the same measurement ring are mixed using analog cards. The resultant signal is proportional to the field harmonic to measure. A complete metrological characterization of this sensor was carried out, showing the limitation of a fully analog solution. The main problems found were the instability of the analog compensation cards and the impossibility to correct the non linearity effects beyond the first order. An automatic calibration procedure implemented in the new instrument software is presented to guarantee measurement repeatability. In alternative a digital bucking solution, namely the compensation of the main field after the sampling of each <b>hall</b> <b>plate</b> signal by means of numerical sum, is proposed. An implementation of this approach, based on 18 bit ADC converter, over-sampling and dithering techniques as well as compensation of the Hall plates non linearity in real time is analyzed. Finally, as far as the low accuracy measurement systems are concerned, the design of an instrument based on a rotating <b>Hall</b> <b>plate</b> to check the polarity of all LHC magnets is presented. Even if this architecture is characterized by low accuracy in the measurement of field strength and phase, the results are sufficient to identify main harmonic order, type and polarity with practically no errors, thanks to an accurate definition of the measurement algorithm. A complete metrological characterization of the prototype developed and a correction of all the systematic measurement errors was carried out. This instrument, integrated in a test bench developed ad hoc, is become the standard at CERN for the polarity test of all the magnets will compose the machine...|$|E
40|$|The LELA plane {{undulator}} {{installed on}} Adone is a 20 period normal conducting electromagnet; the wavelength is 11. 6 cm and {{the magnetic field}} can {{be as high as}} 5. 0 kG on axis. It is tunable over the entire field range. The measured field has an almost ideal cosine-like behaviour longitudinally; the large transverse dimension of the poles (34. 8 cm) ensures a large magnetic field flat top radially. The excellent field quality is confirmed by the measured spontaneous radiation spectral lines which exihit a purely homogeneous bradening. An other important feature is the possibility of rearranging the field pattern to produce for instance an Optical Klystron configuration by simply reversing the current flow in some of the coils. All the above advantages are obtained at the expense of a rather high power consumption at the normal operating point : 500 kW at B = 4. 5 kG.

The differential polysilicon CSHP enabled the magnetic device to not only increase the magnetosensitivity but also eliminate the offset voltage generated because of device mismatch and Lorentz force. Two MOSFETs generated two drain currents with a quadratic function of the differential Hall voltages at CSHP. A readout circuit—composed of a current-to-voltage converter, a low-pass filter, and a difference amplifier—was designed to amplify the current difference between two drains of MOSFETs. Measurements revealed that the electrostatic discharge (ESD) could be eliminated from the distance sensor by grounding it to earth; however, the sensor could be desensitized by ESD {{in the absence of}} grounding. The magnetic influence can be ignored if the magnetic body (human) stays far from the magnetic sensor, and the measuring system is grounded to earth by using the ESD wrist strap (Strap E-GND).
