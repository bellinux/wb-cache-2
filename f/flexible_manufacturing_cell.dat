40|$|The current {{trend in}} {{semiconductor}} manufacturing {{is characterized by}} expanding product variety, decreasing lead times from order to delivery, exacting standards of quality, and competitive prices. One possible means of achieving {{this is in the}} form of increased flexibility. Providing flexibility is typically an expensive proposition so, industrial engineers aim to provide more economic approaches to enable <b>flexible</b> <b>manufacturing</b> <b>cells</b> and related equipment to operate appropriately in an efficient manner. It is essential to characterize these tools in detail before the production plans are finalized. Using state-of-the-art computer simulation, a generic model of photolithography tools has been developed. The model examines the impact of changing product volumes, buffer size, product sequence and product-mix on performance criteria, e. g. throughput time. The high investment cost of <b>flexible</b> <b>manufacturing</b> <b>cells</b> justifies the use of computer simulation support to maintain high system performance and reduce risk by predicting the system behavior under any feasible production schedule.

40|$|Analysis of {{advanced}} manufacturing systems in any manufacturing industry requires {{certain level of}} knowledge about the system. <b>Flexible</b> <b>manufacturing</b> <b>cells,</b> in particular, are commonly used in most wafer fabrication to provide the ability to change product without requiring the construction of new manufacturing plant.

40|$|Product life-cycles are {{constantly}} shortening, {{and the amount}} of new product types increases, for example in the automotive industry. Growing demands on flexibility and ability to decrease time to market has made it increasingly important to find methods for fast and accurate development of control programs for <b>flexible</b> <b>manufacturing</b> <b>cells.</b> There are several means to achieve this goal. Information present in early steps of the development process, as well as already developed software, should be reused when possible. In addition, formal methods should be used to automatically generate the control functions. To enable information reuse and usage of formal methods, a suitable structure has to be defined for the control program. Also, the methods have to be adapted to industrial work procedures. This thesis presents a methodology for generation of control functions for <b>flexible</b> <b>manufacturing</b> <b>cells.</b> The control program is structured hierarchically and partitioned into two parts. The first part corresponds to hardware and basic cell functions that are essentially the same for different <b>manufacturing</b> <b>cells,</b> and the second part is the actual control function, i. e. the part of the control program that is specific to each cell. By structuring the control information similarly in a hierarchical way, models of the system can be produced and supervisor synthesis can be used to generate the high-level control function. Because of the hierarchical approach, the problem of state space explosion is alleviated. A method for presenting the control function in a simple and easy-to-read way has also been developed. This facilitates the use of the control function by the maintenance personnel handling the <b>manufacturing</b> <b>cell.</b> Furthermore, this thesis contains an approach to solve the restart problem in <b>flexible</b> <b>manufacturing</b> systems. When an error has been detected and solved, it is often a difficult and time-consuming task to resynchronize the controller and the cell, and restart production. Most often the entire restart must be handled manually. The method presented in this thesis analyzes the control function off-line, and synthesizes certain restart states in it, from which a restart is guaranteed to be safe. In contrast to earlier methods, the issues of not increasing the complexity of the cell more than necessary, as well as how to physically move the machines in the cell to the restart states in a safe way, are addressed...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: A <b>flexible</b> <b>manufacturing</b> <b>cell</b> (FMC) {{is defined}} as a highly {{automated}} manufacturing system. The design of these kinds of systems is characterized by massive alternatives of components positions and paths. While in practice there is always the attempt to minimize the cycle time, dealing with a lot of alternatives- in respect to components positioning and paths planning- is necessary. There are a lot of constraints and boundary limits of such systems too. For that reason, it is a very difficult task- sometimes it is impossible- to achieve an optimal configuration of FMC components positions and paths without using simulation and 3 D CAD-software. This paper introduces two different solutions for cycle time optimization based on a <b>flexible</b> <b>manufacturing</b> <b>cell</b> for handling cover parts.

40|$|Abstract—A {{method for}} {{automatic}} generation of non-blocking controllers that generate collision-free <b>flexible</b> <b>manufacturing</b> <b>cells</b> {{is presented in}} this paper. Today, industry demands on flexible production sometimes require significant changes in location, orientation and configuration of industrial robots and other moving devices, when new products are introduced.

Although the use of simulation software to facilitate these changes is gaining popularity, the coordination of collision-free <b>flexible</b> <b>manufacturing</b> systems is still at best a semi-manual trial-and-error procedure. To avoid this, a formal model of the operations in a manufacturing system is generated, and for each operation state a corresponding 3 D simulation shape is created. A collision-free system is then achieved by considering pairs of colliding shapes as forbidden states. The automatic generation also includes a synthesis procedure, where a non-blocking and controllable supervisor is generated based on guard generation. The guards are computed by binary decision diagrams, which means that complex systems can be handled, still generating comprehensible restrictions that are easily included in PLC-code. I...|$|R

40|$|We {{initiate}} {{a study of}} mathematical models for specifying (discrete) simulation-based control systems. It is desirable to specify simulation-based control systems using a model that is intuitive, succinct, expressive, and whose state space properties are relatively easy computationally.

The fuzzy set is then integrated into the AHP to determine the weights of the criteria. Finally, a fuzzy ARAS is used to calculate the weights of the alternatives.
