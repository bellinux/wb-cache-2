40|$|AbstractIntroductionPatients with {{incidental}} pT 2 ‐T 3 gallbladder cancer (IGC) after a cholecystectomy {{may benefit}} from a radical re‐resection although their optimal treatment strategy is not well defined. In this Unit, such patients undergo <b>delayed</b> <b>staging</b> at 3 months after a cholecystectomy to assess the evidence of a residual tumour, extra hepatic spread and the biological behaviour of the tumour. The {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate the outcome of patients who had <b>delayed</b> <b>staging</b> at 3 months after a cholecystectomy. MethodsFrom July 2003 to July 2011, 56 patients with T 2 ‐T 3 gallbladder cancer were referred to this Unit of which 49 were diagnosed incidentally on histology after a cholecystectomy. All 49 patients underwent <b>delayed</b> pre‐operative <b>staging</b> using multi‐detector computed tomography (MDCT) followed selectively by laparoscopy at 3 months after a cholecystectomy. Data were collected from a prospectively held database. The peri‐operative and long‐term outcomes of patients were analysed. SPSS software was used for statistical analysis. ResultsThere were 38 pT 2 and 11 pT 3 tumours. After <b>delayed</b> <b>staging,</b> 24 / 49 (49 %) patients underwent a radical resection, 24 / 49 (49 %) were found to be inoperable on pre‐operative assessment and 1 / 49 (2 %) patient underwent an exploratory laparotomy and were found to be unresectable. The overall median survival from referral was 20. 7 months (54. 8 months for the group who had a radical re‐resection versus 9. 7 months for the group who had unresectable disease, P < 0. 001). These results compare favourably with the reported outcome of fast‐track management for incidental pT 2 ‐T 3 gallbladder cancer from other major series in the literature. ConclusionDelayed staging in patients with incidental T 2 ‐T 3 gallbladder cancer after a cholecystectomy is a useful strategy to select patients who will benefit from a resection and avoid unnecessary major surgery...|$|R

30|$|Contemporary CMOS delay lines {{reveal a}} {{trade-off}} between delay range and resolution, thus several studies on enhancing {{both of these}} parameters for applications in circuit synchronization and clocking have been undertaken (Xanthopoulos 2009; Rahkonen and Kostamovaara 1993). This is achieved through a multi-stage architecture. For example, a wide <b>delay</b> <b>stage</b> is designed using a counter that counts clock periods to produce a long delay period with coarse delay increments. The fine <b>delay</b> <b>stage</b> {{is based on an}} interpolator circuit that subdivides and resolves the fractional parts of the clock period from the coarse <b>delay</b> <b>stage</b> into smaller and finer time windows. This allows finer delay steps within the coarsely delayed signal. Although it may seem interesting in concept, matching of the delay elements limits the resolution and the maximum length of the delay line (Rahkonen and Kostamovaara 1993; Xanthopoulos 2009; Kalisz 2004; Nutt 1968). It has been shown that an increase in delay line length to obtain longer delays will increase timing jitter of the output delayed signal by the square root of the delay line length (Klepacki et al. 2014; Nuyts et al. 2014; Henzler 2010 a).|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT Light-evoked {{membrane}} currents {{were recorded}} with suction electrodes {{from the outer}} segments of individual photoreceptors enzymatically dissociated from the skate retina. The intensity-response relation of dark-adapted cells closely followed a Michaelis function for which a half-saturating response was elicited by a flash intensity that produced about 36 photoisomerizations. Dim-light responses, {{as well as the}} early rising phase of the responses {{to a wide range of}} flash intensities, could be described by a reaction scheme that involved a series of four first-order <b>delay</b> <b>stages.</b> The number of <b>delay</b> <b>stages</b> required to model the rising phase of the photocurrents did not change in light adaptation. However, background illumination that reduced sensitivity by 1. 5 log units, or a bleaching exposure that resulted in a nearly equivalent desensitization, shortened significantly the time scale of the responses. In both instances there were two- to threefold increases in the rate constants of the transitional delays, and almost complete suppression of the tail current that characterized the response of the dark-adapted cell. These findings suggest that although light adaptation alters the gain and kinetics of the transduction mechanism, the nature of the intervening processes is the same in dark- and light-adapted photoreceptors. Moreover, the results show clearly that there is no need to postulate the existence of a second class of conelike rods to account for the remarkable ability of skate photoreceptors to respond to incremental stimuli presented on "saturating " background fields or after exposure to an intense bleaching light...|$|R
