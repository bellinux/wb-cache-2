50|$|The first boilers of {{this form}} had raised fireboxes that were {{considerably}} larger, particularly higher, than the boiler barrel. In the extreme case, this {{gave rise to the}} haycock boiler, where the firebox was raised into a vaulted dome. In most cases though, the firebox was merely larger by the width of the internal iron framing section. Around 1850, at the instigation of Crampton, the firebox adopted the flush-topped <b>firebox</b> <b>casing,</b> where it was of the same diameter as the boiler barrel and joined to it by riveted lap strips.|$|E

50|$|The first {{locomotive}} with {{a deliberate}} dome {{added to the}} boiler barrel was Stephenson's Rocket, although this was so small as to have little effect against priming. Many other locomotives built shortly after this date instead used either the 'haycock' boiler, where the <b>firebox</b> outer <b>casing</b> was raised high above {{the main part of}} the boiler, forming a steam dome, or Gooch's development of this where the semi-cylindrical firebox wrapper was raised above the boiler barrel.|$|R
