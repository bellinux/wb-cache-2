Powder X-ray diffraction, Raman spectroscopy and Transmission Electron Microscopy indicate thin crystals of high-quality. The proposed method is rapid, reproducible and environmentally friendly.

The MWCNT emitter showed excellent emission characteristics under vacuum pressure below 10 - 6 Torr. The MWCNT source vacuum gauge presented good measurement linearity from 10 - 7 to 1 Torr for air.

This chamber serves as a non-humidified incubator that is enclosed by a fluorinated ethylene propylene (FEP) membrane that is permeable to select gases (i.e. gases necessary for metabolism) but impermeable to water and microbes.

Because the fast destroyers typically used were not configured for cargo handling, many supplies were simply pushed into the water, <b>inside</b> <b>sealed</b> steel drums lashed together; the drums floated ashore or were picked up by barge.

40|$|Here {{we report}} direct {{observations}} of spatial movements of nanodroplets of Pb metal trapped <b>inside</b> <b>sealed</b> carbon nanocontainers. We find drastic {{changes in the}} mobility of the liquid droplets as the particle size increases from a few to a few ten nanometers. In open containers the droplet becomes immobile and readily evaporates to the vacuum environment. The particle mobility strongly depends on confinement, particle size, and wetting on the enclosed surface. The collisions between droplets increase mobility but the tendency is reversed if collisions lead to droplet coalescence. The dynamics of confined nanodroplets could provide {{new insights into the}} activity of nanostructures in spatially constrained geometries...|$|R

40|$|Chemical {{analyses}} of ancient organics absorbed into pottery jars {{from the early}} Neolithic village of Jiahu in Henan province in China have revealed that a mixed fermented beverage of rice, honey, and fruit (hawthorn fruit and/or grape) was being produced {{as early as the}} seventh millennium before Christ (B.

C., remarkably preserved as liquids <b>inside</b> <b>sealed</b> bronze vessels of the Shang and Western Zhou Dynasties.

50|$|This item is an {{inexpensive}} way to quantify relative humidity levels <b>inside</b> <b>sealed</b> packaging. They {{are available in}} many configurations and used in many applications, especially military and semiconductor. The most common humidity indicator cards change color from blue (less than indicated RH level) to pink (greater than indicated RH level). United States Military Specification Mil-I-8835A is the governing specification for a humidity indicator card. The humidity indicator card is also specified for use in J-STD-033 which is the standard for Handling, Packing, Shipping and Use of Moisture/Reflow Sensitive Surface Mount Devices, also known generically as semiconductors. This is a joint standard developed by the Joint Electron Device Engineering Council and IPC and is used in semiconductor packaging.|$|R

40|$|Capacitive micromachined {{ultrasonic}} transducers (CMUTs) {{are one of}} the appealing MEMS devices. Most studies treat CMUTs as rigid plates vibrating in open air, {{ignoring the}} mechanical boundary conditions for simplification and resulting in cumulative errors in coupled fields. This paper presents a new analytical model for the pull-in characteristics of the flat circular CMUT cell featuring sealed cavity. Utilizing the plate theory coupled with Boyle’s law, the paper establishes a strong relation between the pressures <b>inside</b> the <b>sealed</b> cavity and the pull-in characteristics for the first time. Not only did we point out that the existence of the pressure <b>inside</b> the <b>sealed</b> cavity cannot be omitted, but we also quantified the direct effect of the pressure ratios on the pull-in phenomenon. The pull-in voltages increase while the pull-in ratios decrease with the pressure ratios of the pressure <b>inside</b> the <b>sealed</b> cavity to the ambient pressure. The proposed calculation process delivers a good approximation of the pull-in voltages and displacements, which are consistent with COMSOL simulation results. Particularly, the percentage error of our calculation process is 6. 986 % for the worst case. Therefore, our proposed analytical model accurately and efficiently predicts the pull-in characteristics and this paper offers new perspectives and reference value in designing and modeling the CMUTs...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — The {{present study}} {{reports on the}} {{development}} of a model for maintaining constant ethanol concentrations over time in cell culture media. When neuroblastoma x glioma cells (NG 108 - 15) were grown in ethanol containing media under standard cultivation conditions in the incubator at 37 °C, a 90 % evaporation was observed after 24 hr. To counteract evaporation, the cell culture dishes were placed inside polystyrene boxes together with an open dish containing an appropriate amount of ethanol. By using such procedure, the decrease in ethanol concentration in the culture media was completely avoided. Cultivating cells in ethanol-free media <b>inside</b> <b>sealed</b> plastic boxes did not change their viability, growth rate, protein and phospholipid composition of the cells or the pH of the media, compared to cultures grown outside the boxes...|$|R
40|$|The {{safe storage}} of pure and impure {{plutonium}} oxide materials in sealed containers is a current Department of Energy (DOE) concern. Plutonium oxides sorb {{moisture from the}} atmosphere, and the subsequent radiolytic and/or chemical decomposition of the water has been thought to generate excessive hydrogen pressures <b>inside</b> <b>sealed</b> containers. Eleven sealed containers with ten grams each of plutonium oxide materials have been studied for up to four years. The sealed materials were representative materials from the DOE complex and contain less than 0. 5 weight percent water. The samples were kept at ambient conditions. We report the final gas analysis of the headspace gas of these containers using gas chromatography, mass spectrometry and Raman spectroscopy. The results show {{that none of the}} containers have pressurized significantly, and that hydrogen was not generated in significant quantities...|$|R

The intersection of a plan with such a surfaces is described by the dose rate contour curves. It is very common to assume that these surfaces have rotational symmetry around the longitudinal axis, and so, the contour curves have mirror symmetries. Here it is shown, by a computational simulation, that if the radioactive material <b>inside</b> de <b>sealed</b> vessel is not homogeneous, the uncertainty in dose rate measurements could achieve high values. This uncertainty value is exemplified in a iodine- 125 seed source used for brachytherapy purposes. dose measurement uncertainty if no quality control assure its uniformity.
