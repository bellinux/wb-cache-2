5|$|Alison {{remembers a}} time when Bruce took her and her {{brothers}} to New York City and stayed in a borrowed Greenwich Village apartment. After a long day, Small Alison, Christian and John settle into sleeping bags. Small Alison wakes up and catches Bruce sneaking out. Bruce sings a lullaby ("Pony Girl"). He reassures his daughter that he's just <b>going</b> <b>out</b> <b>for</b> a paper, but he leaves to go cruising. Medium Alison is angered by a noncommittal letter from Bruce, responding to her coming out. At a luncheonette with her father, Small Alison notices a butch delivery woman and feels an inexplicable kinship with her ("Ring of Keys").|$|E
5|$|After {{bringing}} on Carlos Tevez {{in place}} of Anderson at half time, Manchester United kicked off the second half in a different formation, with Tevez joining Ronaldo up front in a familiar 4–4–2. Both teams attempted to settle into their customary passing rhythms, but – unlike the first half – it was Barcelona who settled first; Manchester United's passes in their attacking third of the field failed to find their targets, and Iniesta eventually came away with the ball before flicking a pass through to Xavi, who played a through-ball to Henry on the left wing. The French forward turned Ferdinand inside-out, but his shot from a narrow angle was straight at Van der Sar and ended up <b>going</b> <b>out</b> <b>for</b> a throw-in. Xavi then again passed the ball out to the left flank, where Henry nonchalantly left it for the on-rushing Sylvinho; the Brazilian full-back whipped in a cross for Eto'o, but it was caught {{on the edge of}} the six-yard box by Van der Sar.|$|E
5|$|Stealing a Ride follows two children, Susie Gay and Johnnie Eddy, {{who are out}} tobogganing on sleds. The two see Susie's parents <b>going</b> <b>out</b> <b>for</b> a {{drive in}} a sleigh and ask to come along. The parents refuse and {{secretly}} two hitch their sleds behind the sleigh. When going up a hill, Susie loses her grip on her sled and Johnnie tries to save her from falling in vain. The two fall off and are unable to catch up the sleigh. The children wander {{into the woods and}} become lost. When Susie's parents discover the empty sleds they turn back and track down the children by the footprints they left in the snow {{with the aid of a}} dog. The parents find them asleep in the snow and bring them back home in the sleigh. The children are punished by spanking and then kissed by their parents for their actions.|$|E

25|$|United Arab Emirates, {{especially}} Dubai, Abu Dhabi, Ras Al Khaimah is {{a popular}} destination for medical tourism. The Dubai Health authority has been spearheading the Medical Tourism into UAE esp. Dubai. However, hospitals providing medical tourism are spread all over the 7 Emirates. UAE has the distinction of having {{the maximum number of}} JCI accredited hospitals (under various heads) https://www.jointcommissioninternational.org/about-jci/jci-accredited-organizations/?c=United%20Arab%20Emirates. UAE has both inbound medical tourist as well as people <b>going</b> <b>out</b> <b>for</b> medical treatment. The inbound tourism usually is from African countries like Nigeria, Kenya, Uganda, Rwanda etc. The outbound can be categorised into 2 segments - The local population (citizens of UAE) and the expats. The locals prefer to go to European destinations like U.K, Germany etc. The Expats prefer {{to go back to their}} home countries for treatment.|$|E
25|$|As a Test player, Wessels' most {{successful}} period {{came during the}} disastrous West Indian tour of Australia. After scoring only 13 and 0 in the first Test, Wessels {{was in danger of}} being dropped from the Australian side. However, due to the poor performance of almost all of Australia's batting in that match, he was retained for the second Test. He responded by <b>going</b> <b>out</b> <b>for</b> 0 after the second ball, and many people thought that his career was over. In the second innings, however, he top scored with 61, giving the selectors no option but to include him for the third Test. Batting up number 3, Wessels top scored again with 98 runs in the first innings and 70 in the second, in a match where the Australian batting was being taken apart by the West Indian bowlers.|$|E
25|$|Some smoking {{restrictions}} {{were introduced in}} German hotels, restaurants, and bars in 2008 and early 2009. The restaurant industry has claimed that some businesses in the states which restricted smoking in late 2007 (Lower Saxony, Baden-Württemberg, and Hessen) experienced reduced profits. The German Hotel and Restaurant Association (DEHOGA) claimed that the smoking ban deterred people from <b>going</b> <b>out</b> <b>for</b> a drink or meal, stating that 15% of establishments that adopted a ban in 2007 saw turnover fall by around 50%. However, {{a study by the}} University of Hamburg (Ahlfeldt and Maennig 2010) finds negative impacts on revenues, if any, only in the very short run. In the medium and long run, a recovery of revenues took place. These results suggest either, that the consumption in bars and restaurants is not affected by smoking bans in the long run, or, that negative revenue impacts by smokers are compensated by increasing revenues through non-smokers. Smoking is not permitted in any public transit or in or around railway stations except for the locations expressly indicated for smoking. Smoking on trains was banned completely by the Deutsche Bahn AG in 2007. Smoking has been restricted in airports and all Lufthansa planes since the late 1990s.|$|E

Besides Madonna, her dancers and her tour entourage, Åkerlund also shot her family, her working process and her day-to-day life. Locations shot included Madonna and her husband Guy Ritchie's local pub in Mayfair, London. There was also an appearance from filmmaker Michael Moore, her father Tony Ciccone and stepmother Joan Ciccone. In some scenes, Ritchie was shown missing some of Madonna's concerts and <b>going</b> <b>out</b> <b>for</b> drinks, which drove the singer to tears.

500|$|Before the book's publication, Heather Lauer was {{a public}} affairs {{consultant}} in Arizona. She hatched the idea {{to write a book}} about bacon after <b>going</b> <b>out</b> <b>for</b> cocktails with her two brothers in 2005. [...] Lauer explained to The Arizona Republic: [...] "I was out drinking with my brothers one night, and the topic of bacon came up. We had eaten bacon as kids, and bacon was a special thing on Sunday mornings. Somehow, the idea came up about how funny it would be to start a blog about bacon... I took it and ran with it." [...] She began the blog Bacon Unwrapped, at www.baconunwrapped.com, and a social networking site about bacon at baconnation.ning.com in 2005.|$|E
500|$|While {{writing the}} screenplay, Hirani and Joshi stayed {{together}} {{for more than}} four months. They developed scenes by <b>going</b> <b>out</b> <b>for</b> a walk and discussing the scene. They would not return home until they had created a scene that would make them laugh, or cry, or had some provocative thought. While there was a shortage of resources during the shooting of Munna Bhai M.B.B.S., the crew did not encounter a financial crisis during the filming of Lage Raho Munna Bhai, as the team managed to receive whatever was deemed necessary (including a Jimmy Jib, a specific kind of camera crane, just for a single crane shot). The film was shot on location in and around Mumbai, with Goa as a backdrop for the [...] "Aane Charaane" [...] song.|$|E

Ruth was [...] "unnerved" [...] when the silent phone calls began and she sent the children {{to stay with her}} mother. The intimidation ended after a barn at Brookfield was set alight and the arsonist was caught, following an anonymous tip off. In 2013, Ruth and David celebrated their 25th wedding anniversary and Finch hoped the couple would continue to make Brookfield a thriving business, while relaxing into semi-retirement. Finch commented, [...] "Any couple who after 25 years still love <b>going</b> <b>out</b> <b>for</b> meals together, having the occasional break away without the kids and the odd roll in a haystack are doing pretty well I reckon." [...] The following year, Ruth discovered that, at 45, she was expecting her fourth child. However, the pregnancy ended in a miscarriage.|$|E

500|$|The b-side of {{the single}} [...] "Zutto... Iyō yo" [...] was written by Matsu and {{produced}} by Hinata. Matsu decided {{to give it the}} theme of three girls <b>going</b> <b>out</b> <b>for</b> a drive. However, she commented that no matter how others looked at it, {{it seemed as if the}} song is about two girls. The song opens with an [...] "electro" [...] introduction and utilizes a warped guitar throughout. In addition to the two songs, the single also featured the original karaoke track to [...] "Ashita, Haru ga Kitara".

500|$|This {{brought the}} {{regiment}} into contact {{for the first}} time with someone it would later meet more seriously, Brigadier Bernard Law Montgomery (often referred to as [...] "Monty"), then commanding the 9th Infantry Brigade in Portsmouth. In 1937, the brigade was on an exercise in Wiltshire and RWY was attached to it for their two-week annual camp. The brigade major wrote that [...] " [...] was run like so much of the TA those days on rather feudal lines...when they heard they were going to have those tremendous exercises – three nights out at a time – they jibbed violently....Most of them had looked forward to exercises all day and then <b>going</b> <b>out</b> <b>for</b> a bit of jollity at night." [...] The upshot was that the regiment was banished to a distant part of the camp where their socialising would not be disturbed by the Regulars. However, apparently the Yeomanry were so intrigued by Monty's exercises that their Commanding Officer (CO) approached him, asking to be included in the last brigade exercise.|$|E

500|$|Tolle recalls <b>going</b> <b>out</b> <b>for</b> {{a walk in}} London {{the next}} morning, and finding that “everything was miraculous, deeply peaceful. Even the traffic." [...] The feeling continued, {{and he began to}} feel a strong {{underlying}} sense of peace in any situation. He stopped studying for his doctorate, and for a period of about two years after this he spent much of his time sitting, “in a state of deep bliss," [...] on park benches in Russell Square, Central London, [...] "watching the world go by.” He stayed with friends, in a Buddhist monastery, or otherwise slept rough on Hampstead Heath. His family thought him “irresponsible, even insane." [...] He changed his first name from Ulrich to Eckhart; by some reports this was in homage to the German philosopher and mystic, Meister Eckhart. A 2012 interview article states that he saw the name Eckhart on one of a pile of books in a dream, and knew he had written the book; soon after in real life he ran into a psychic friend who called him Eckhart out of nowhere, so he changed his name.|$|E
2500|$|In time, {{with the}} {{development}} of Buddhist doctrine, other interpretations were given, such as being an unconditioned state, a fire <b>going</b> <b>out</b> <b>for</b> lack of fuel, abandoning weaving (vana) together of life after life, and the elimination of desire.
