5|$|That the negotiations, {{acceptance}} of the assignment and agreements and understandings in respect thereof were within the competence of the President may not be doubted. Governmental power over external affairs is not distributed, but is vested exclusively in the national government. And in respect of what was <b>done</b> <b>here,</b> the Executive had authority to speak as the sole organ of that government. The assignment and the agreements in connection therewith did not, {{as in the case}} of treaties, as that term is used in the treaty making clause of the Constitution (article 2, 2), require the advice and consent of the Senate.|$|E

25|$|It is {{well known}} that the axiom of choice is {{equivalent}} to the ability to well-order every set.

25|$|The city {{is waiting}} to hear {{whether it will be}} {{selected}} by the Government of Ontario as the area for testing driverless cars on public roads.

Preliminary testing of driverless cars has been <b>done</b> <b>here</b> already, by the Waterloo's Centre for Automotive Research, affiliated with the University, but the decision as to where the multimillion-dollar technology grid will be installed has not yet been made by the Province. The city's free Wi-Fi network may be of value to IT industries and is an indicator of its serious interest in advanced technology.|$|E
25|$|Numerous {{indigenous}} peoples occupied Alaska {{for thousands of}} years before the arrival of European peoples to the area. Linguistic and DNA studies <b>done</b> <b>here</b> have provided evidence for the settlement of North America by way of the Bering land bridge. The Tlingit people developed a society with a matrilineal kinship system of property inheritance and descent in what is today Southeast Alaska, along with parts of British Columbia and the Yukon. Also in Southeast were the Haida, now well known for their unique arts. The Tsimshian people came to Alaska from British Columbia in 1887, when President Grover Cleveland, and later the U.S. Congress, granted them permission to settle on Annette Island and found the town of Metlakatla. All three of these peoples, as well as other {{indigenous peoples}} of the Pacific Northwest Coast, experienced smallpox outbreaks from the late 18th through the mid-19th century, with the most devastating epidemics occurring in the 1830s and 1860s, resulting in high fatalities and social disruption.|$|E

500|$|In a {{retrospective}} {{of the first}} season in Entertainment Weekly, [...] "Conduit" [...] was rated a B, with the episode being described as [...] "excellent for background" [...] for the series, though {{it was noted that}} Duchovny gave [...] "a performance that makes wood look lively". [...] Keith Phipps, writing for The A.V. Club, reviewed the episode positively, rating it a B+, feeling that the episode worked well to expand on the motivations of the two lead characters, noting that [...] "the work <b>done</b> <b>here</b> will pay off well later". The episode has been seen as laying the foundation for the recurrence of Fox Mulder's obsession with finding his missing sister, which would come {{to be one of the}} main plot threads of the series.|$|E

[...] Computer Gaming Worlds Charles Ardai found the game's use of traditional games [...] "downright baffling", given their presence in past compilations, as well as in [...] and the Dr. Brain series.

[...] The authors of the book I Can't Believe It's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood commented that [...] "The idea of Lisa being unpopular in the light of a new girl in the school hallways is not new (see [...] "Lisa's Rival") but it is <b>done</b> <b>here</b> with such class," [...] concluding of Homer's treatment that [...] "this is an episode which shows that even he can find interesting ways to do things."

500|$|Conor Behan of The Independent {{qualified}} {{the clip}} as being [...] "effortlessly sexy". Jon Dolan of Rolling Stone described the video {{for the song}} as the most NSFW from the album. Brent DiCrescenzo of Time Out referred to the clip for [...] "Partition" [...] as a classic MTV video. A more negative review came from The Verge Trent Wolbe who panned Nava's contribution to the album as uninteresting. The Daily Telegraph writer Sarah Crompton stated that the video looked suitable for a porn website and described its imagery as [...] "strip club dressed up as a Busby Berkeley musical". Crompton went on to call the message the video sent [...] "peculiar" [...] and added that the singer should try to become a better role model for young girls. Vivienne Pattison of Mediawatch-uk commented that such visuals showed that Beyoncé had [...] "sold out" [...] and undermined her position as a [...] "role model" [...] and previous [...] "powerful messages that empowered women and girls". In early March 2014, Bill O'Reilly criticized the video for [...] "Partition" [...] during his show The O'Reilly Factor broadcast on Fox News. He said that it represented glorification of sex {{in the back of}} a limousine and offered critique that teenage girls are influenced by the singer, adding, [...] "Why would she do it when she knows the devastation that unwanted pregnancies... and fractured families [...] I think Beyoncé, what she has <b>done</b> <b>here,</b> is inexplicable". In response to these claims, Rutger University's Kevin Allred argues that [...] "Beyonce isn’t sensationalizing her own body and putting it on display for viewers to gawk at. Rather, she performs the historical objectification of black female bodies and replays that objectification in order to point out that, stereotypically, black women have had few means of garnering attention beyond sexual performances. She goes so far as forcing the viewer to be complicit in this objectification by positioning them as the direct viewer of the show she is enacting." [...] The video was nominated in the category for Video of the Year at the 2014 BET Awards. At the 2014 MTV Video Music Awards it was nominated in the categories for Best Choreography and Best Female Video.|$|E
