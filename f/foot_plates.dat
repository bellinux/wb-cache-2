40|$|Background: In spastic {{cerebral}} palsy (SCP), a {{limited range of}} motion of the foot (ROM), limits gait and other activities. Assessment of this limitation of ROM and knowledge of active mechanisms is of crucial importance for clinical treatment. Methods. For a comparison between spastic {{cerebral palsy}} (SCP) children and typically developing children (TD), medial gastrocnemius muscle-tendon complex length was assessed using 3 -D ultrasound imaging techniques, while exerting externally standardized moments via a hand-held dynamometer. Exemplary X-ray imaging of ankle and foot was used to confirm possible TD-SCP differences in foot deformation. Results: SCP and TD {{did not differ in}} normalized level of excitation (EMG) of muscles studied. For given moments exerted in SCP, <b>foot</b> <b>plate</b> angles were all more towards plantar flexion than in TD. However, <b>foot</b> <b>plate</b> angle proved to be an invalid estimator of talocrural joint angle, since at equal <b>foot</b> <b>plate</b> angles, GM muscle-tendon complex was shorter in SCP (corresponding to an equivalent of 1 cm). A substantial difference remained even after normalizing for individual differences in tibia length. X-ray imaging of ankle and foot of one SCP child and two typically developed adults, confirmed that in SCP that of total footplate angle changes (0 - 4 Nm: 15 °), the contribution of foot deformation to changes in <b>foot</b> <b>plate</b> angle (8) were as big as the contribution of dorsal flexion at the talocrural joint (7 °). In typically developed individuals there were relatively smaller contributions (10 - 11 %) by foot deformation to changes in <b>foot</b> <b>plate</b> angle, indicating that the contribution of talocrural angle changes was most important. Using a new estimate for position at the talocrural joint (the difference between GM muscle-tendon complex length and tibia length, GM relative length) removed this effect, thus allowing more fair comparison of SCP and TD data. On the basis of analysis of <b>foot</b> <b>plate</b> angle and GM relative length as a function of externally applied moments, it is concluded that <b>foot</b> <b>plate</b> angle measurements underestimate angular changes at the talocrural joint when moving in dorsal flexion direction and overestimate them when moving in plantar flexion direction, with concomitant effects on triceps surae lengths. Conclusions: In SCP children diagnosed with decreased dorsal ROM of the ankle joint, the commonly used measure (i. e. range of <b>foot</b> <b>plate</b> angle), is not a good estimate of rotation at the talocrural joint. since a sizable part of the movement of the <b>foot</b> (or <b>foot</b> <b>plate)</b> derives from internal deformation of the foot. © 2013 Huijing et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd...|$|R

40|$|The {{group at}} Klinik Berlin/Charite University Hospital in Berlin, Germany, began studies to promote motor {{recovery}} after stroke {{in the early}} 1990 s. Following the introduction of treadmill training with partial body-weight support, the group designed an electromechanical gait trainer, GT I, based on movable <b>foot</b> <b>plates</b> that relieve therapist effort (e. g., when assisting {{the movement of the}} paretic limbs) and intensify patient gait training (GT). Preliminary results of a recent multicenter trial of 155 acute stroke patients showed that the GT I effectively promotes gait ability and competence in activities of daily living. The experimental group received 20 min of GT and 25 min of physiotherapy (PT) and the control group received 45 min of PT every day for 4 weeks. The laboratory's next step was the HapticWalker, a robotic walking simulator with freely programmable <b>foot</b> <b>plates</b> so that patients can, for example, additionally train for stair climbing and perturbations. The <b>foot</b> <b>plates</b> can be operated in full guidance or compliance control modes, thus reducing foot support according to the patient's learning success. For the severely affected upper limb, the laboratory's computerized arm trainer, called the Bi-Manu-Track, enables bilateral practice of forearm pronation/supination and wrist flexion/extension. Compared with electrical stimulation of the paretic wrist extensors, acute stroke patients with severe arm paresis (n = 44) had significantly more upper-limb muscle strength and control {{at the end of the}} 6 -week intervention period and at follow-up.

40|$|This study {{reports the}} first {{characterisation}} of the embryonic bat limb transcriptome, allowing {{the identification of}} novel candidate genes that were differentially expressed between the bat hand and foot plate. These genes may have played important roles {{in the evolution of}} the bat wing and hindlimb. The reproduction and development of an African bat species, Miniopterus natalensis, was characterised and three maternal features (mass, belly size and plasma progesterone levels) examined as potential predictors of embryonic stages of development. Belly palpitation was found to be a useful field method to distinguish between non-pregnancy, early development or late development in female bats. A microarray analysis between the hand and <b>foot</b> <b>plates</b> of CS 16 and CS 17 bat embryos, and the hand plates of E 13. 5 mouse embryos, revealed high correlation between the transcriptomes of the bat autopods and the mouse hand plate (r > 0. 88) and among all the bat autopods (r > 0. 98). However, ten genes were found to be differentially expressed in both the CS 16 and the CS 17 bat hand plate as compared to the mouse hand plate while only three genes were identified as being significantly differentially expressed between bat <b>foot</b> <b>plates</b> and mouse hand plates. A comparison between the bat hand and <b>foot</b> <b>plates</b> identified fifteen genes that were differentially expressed at the stage CS 17 stage and six at the stage CS 16. Closer examination of gene families involved in limb development revealed novel expression of genes in the retinoic acid (RA) pathway, and the Hoxd family. This included the apparent co- regulation of the 5 ' Hoxd genes (Hoxd 10, 11, 12 and 13). Of the genes characterised in bat limb development (Hoxd 13, Bmp 2, Fgf 8 and Prrxl), higher mRNA transcript levels in the CS 17 bat hand plate relative to the mouse hand plate was found for Hoxd 13 (FC = 2. 6) and Prrxl (FC = 1. 8). These differences were also found in a comparison to the CS 17 bat foot plate (Hoxd 13 : FC = 1. 4; Prrxl: FC = 1. 4). A potentially novel transcript of Meis 2, a gene important in specifYing the proximal-distal (P-D) axis of the limb, was noted for its high fold changes in the bat hand plate as compared the foot plate (CSI 7 : FC = 7. 0; CSI 6 : FC = 2. 2) and the mouse hand plate (FC = 13. 1) ...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Gait {{restoration}} is {{an integral}} part of rehabilitation of brain lesioned patients. Modern concepts favour a task-specific repetitive approach, i. e. who wants to regain walking has to walk, while tone-inhibiting and gait preparatory manoeuvres had dominated therapy before. Following the first mobilization out of the bed, the wheelchair-bound patient should have the possibility to practise complex gait cycles as soon as possible. Steps in this direction were treadmill training with partial body weight support and most recently gait machines enabling the repetitive training of even surface gait and even of stair climbing. Results With treadmill training harness-secured and partially relieved wheelchair-mobilised patients could practise up to 1000 steps per session for the first time. Controlled trials in stroke and SCI patients, however, failed to show a superior result when compared to walking exercise on the floor. Most likely explanation was the effort for the therapists, e. g. manually setting the paretic limbs during the swing phase resulting in a too little gait intensity. The next steps were gait machines, either consisting of a powered exoskeleton and a treadmill (Lokomat, AutoAmbulator) or an electromechanical solution with the harness secured patient placed on movable <b>foot</b> <b>plates</b> (Gait Trainer GT I). For the latter, a large multi-centre trial with 155 non-ambulatory stroke patients (DEGAS) revealed a superior gait ability and competence in basic activities of living in the experimental group. The HapticWalker continued the end effector concept of movable <b>foot</b> <b>plates,</b> now fully programmable and equipped with 6 DOF force sensors. This device for the first time enables training of arbitrary walking situations, hence not only the simulation of floor walking but also for example of stair climbing and perturbations. Conclusion Locomotor therapy is a fascinating new tool in rehabilitation, which is in line with modern principles of motor relearning promoting a task-specific repetitive approach. Sophisticated technical developments and positive randomized controlled trials form the basis of a growing acceptance worldwide to the benefits or our patients. </p...|$|E

40|$|The Notch {{signaling}} pathway is a conserved intercellular signaling mechanism that is essential for proper embryonic development in numerous metazoan organisms. We have examined the in vivo role of the Jagged 2 (Jag 2) gene, which encodes a ligand for the Notch family of transmembrane receptors, by making a targeted mutation that removes a domain of the Jagged 2 protein required for receptor interaction. Mice homozygous for this deletion die perinatally because of defects in craniofacial morphogenesis. The mutant homozygotes exhibit cleft palate and fusion of the tongue with the palatal shelves. The mutant mice also exhibit syndactyly (digit fusions) of the fore- and hindlimbs. The apical ectodermal ridge (AER) of the limb buds of the mutant homozygotes is hyperplastic, and we observe an expanded domain of Fgf 8 expression in the AER. In the <b>foot</b> <b>plates</b> of the mutant homozygotes, both Bmp 2 and Bmp 7 expression and apoptotic interdigital cell death are reduced. Mutant homozygotes also display defects in thymic development, exhibiting altered thymic morphology and impaired differentiation of γδ lineage T cells.

The {{height of}} the <b>foot</b> <b>plates</b> (stretchers) in rowing have been shown, both {{theoretically}} and experimentally, to significantly influence {{the effectiveness of the}} rowing stroke. However, the extent to which increasing this height can improve rowing performance, through musculo-skeletal adaptations, is not yet known. The aims of the present investigation were to determine the influence of a three week familiarisation period on rowing performance at a raised stretcher height. Nine male rowers performed a 3. 5 minute maximal intensity ergometer trial before and after familiarisation. Mean power per stroke significantly increases during the first, middle and last ten strokes of the trial, post-familiarisation. This increase in mean power per stroke was due to increases in both mean handle force and velocity. The results of the study suggested that a musculo-skeletal adaptation to this new stretcher position had occurred with familiarisation, leading to improved performance. Determination of an ideal stretcher height for maximum mechanical effectiveness was not possible here, as this would be specific to each individual rower, and must take into consideration the balance of the boat and the extra energy required to maintain balance as stretcher height is increased.

To enable wheelchair-dependent patients the repetitive practice of this task, a novel gait robot, G-EO-Systems (EO, Lat: I walk), based on the end-effector principle, has been designed. The trajectories of the <b>foot</b> <b>plates</b> are freely programmable enabling not only the practice of simulated floor walking but also stair {{climbing up}} and down. The article intended to compare lower limb muscle activation patterns of hemiparetic subjects during real floor walking and stairs climbing up, and during the corresponding simulated conditions on the machine, and secondly to demonstrate gait improvement on single case after training on the machine. Methods The muscle activation pattern of seven lower limb muscles of six hemiparetic patients during free and simulated walking on the floor and stair climbing was measured via dynamic electromyography. A non-ambulatory, sub-acute stroke patient additionally trained on the G-EO-Systems every workday for five weeks. Results The muscle activation patterns were comparable during the real and simulated conditions, both on the floor and during stair climbing up. Minor differences, concerning the real and simulated floor walking conditions, were a delayed (prolonged) onset (duration) of the thigh muscle activation on the machine across all subjects. Concerning stair climbing conditions, the shank muscle activation was more phasic and timely correct in selected patients on the device. The severely affected subject regained walking and stair climbing ability. Conclusions The G-EO-Systems is an interesting new option in gait rehabilitation after stroke. The lower limb muscle activation patterns were comparable, a training thus feasible, and the positive case report warrants further clinical studies. </p...|$|E
