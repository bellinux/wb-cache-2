5|$|An {{important}} role of EFS as a CAS-family member function is transmission of integrin-initiated signals from the extracellular matrix to downstream effectors, leading to reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton and changes in motility and invasion. The SH3 domain {{is a point of}} contact with polyproline sequences on focal adhesion kinase (FAK). or the related kinase PTK2B, also known as RAFTK/Pyk2/CAKβ. Typically, phosphorylation of the C-terminal region of CAS proteins by FAK or PTK2B creates a binding site for the SH2 domain of a SRC-family protein, which then hyper-phosphorylates the substrate domain, allowing the CAS protein to function as a scaffold for other proteins including CRK proteins and C3G, a <b>guanine</b> <b>nucleotide</b> exchange factor (GEF) for RAP1. PTP-PEST, a soluble protein tyrosine phosphatase that is ubiquitously expressed in mice both during embryonic development and in adult tissues, opposes FAK and PTK2B activity, as it dephosphorylates PTK2B, FAK and CAS family members, among other proteins. The PTP-PEST proline-rich sequence 332PPKPPR337 has been shown to interact directly with the SH3 domain of members of EFS and another CAS protein, NEDD9.|$|E

Stimulation and inhbition were induced by GTP and non-hydrolysable guanosine triphosphates. GDP and non-hydrolysable guanosine diphosphates were antagonists.

40|$|The binding of {{agonists}} and antagonists to R adenosine receptors of synaptosomal membranes from rat and bovine {{brain was}} studied. The effects of <b>guanine</b> <b>nucleotides</b> and temperature were analyzed {{with the aid}} of computerized curve fitting. Evidence is presented for two different states of the receptor: one of high and one of low affinity for agonists. Antagonists bind to both states with the same affinity. The two states are characterized by saturation, competition, and kinetic experiments with very similar results. <b>Guanine</b> <b>nucleotides</b> cause transition of the high- to the low-affinity state. The ratio of the KD values for the two affinity states is 90 - 150 in rat brain but only 10 in bovine brain. The proportions of the two affinity states are the same for all agonists tested; in the absence of exogenous <b>guanine</b> <b>nucleotides,</b> 75 % of the total receptor population is in the high-affinity state, whereas in the presence of <b>guanine</b> <b>nucleotides</b> only 5 % remain in the high-affinity state. Binding of antagonists to the receptor is enthalpy-driven whereas binding of the agonist (-) -N 6 -phenylisopropyladenosine to the high-affinity state of the receptor is entropy-driven. Binding of the agonist to the low-affinity state is enthalpy-driven and thus similar to the binding of antagonists. Our data indicate that <b>guanine</b> <b>nucleotides</b> convert the R adenosine receptor from a high- to a low-agonist affinity state and that agonist binding shows thermodynamic differences from antagonist binding only when it is to the high-affinity state of the receptor...|$|R

40|$|<b>Guanine</b> <b>nucleotides</b> are {{key players}} in {{mediating}} growth-cone signaling during neural development. The supply of cellular <b>guanine</b> <b>nucleotides</b> in animals can be achieved via the de novo synthesis and salvage pathways. The de novo synthesis of <b>guanine</b> <b>nucleotides</b> is required for lymphocyte proliferation in animals. Whether the de novo synthesis pathway is essential for any other cellular processes, however, remains unknown. In a search for genes required {{for the establishment of}} neuronal connectivity in the fly visual system, we identify the burgundy (bur) gene as an essential player in photoreceptor axon guidance. The bur gene encodes the only GMP synthetase in Drosophila that catalyzes the final reaction of de novo GMP synthesis. Loss of bur causes severe defects in axonal fasciculation, retinotopy, and growth-cone morphology, but does not affect photoreceptor differentiation or retinal patterning. Similar defects were observed when the raspberry (ras) gene, encoding for inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase catalyzing the IMP-to-XMP conversion in GMP de novo synthesis, was mutated. Our study thus provides the first in vivo evidence to support an essential and specific role for de novo synthesis of <b>guanine</b> <b>nucleotides</b> in axon guidance...|$|R

25|$|Upon {{activation}} by light, rhodopsin {{causes the}} exchange of GDP for GTP in the <b>guanine</b> <b>nucleotide</b> binding protein (G-protein) α-transducing activity polypeptide 2 (GNAT2). This causes {{the release of the}} activated α-subunit from the inhibitory β/γ-subunits. This α-subunit then activates a phosphodiesterase that catalyzes the conversion of cGMP to GMP, thereby reducing current through CNG3 channels. As this process is absolutely vital for proper color processing {{it is not surprising that}} mutations in GNAT2 lead to achromatopsia. The known mutations in this gene, table 3, all result in truncated proteins. Presumably, then, these proteins are non-functional and, consequently, rhodopsin that has been activated by light does not lead to altered cGMP levels or photoreceptor membrane hyperpolarization.|$|E
25|$|As is {{the case}} with GPCRs, {{proteins}} that bind GTP {{play a major role in}} signal transduction from the activated RTK into the cell. In this case, the G proteins are members of the Ras, Rho, and Raf families, referred to collectively as small G proteins. They act as molecular switches usually tethered to membranes by isoprenyl groups linked to their carboxyl ends. Upon activation, they assign proteins to specific membrane subdomains where they participate in signaling. Activated RTKs in turn activate small G proteins that activate <b>guanine</b> <b>nucleotide</b> exchange factors such as SOS1. Once activated, these exchange factors can activate more small G proteins, thus amplifying the receptor's initial signal. The mutation of certain RTK genes, as with that of GPCRs, can result in the expression of receptors that exist in a constitutively activated state; such mutated genes may act as oncogenes.|$|E
25|$|Importin {{proteins}} bind their cargo in the cytoplasm, {{after which}} {{they are able to}} interact with the nuclear pore complex and pass through its channel. Once inside the nucleus, interaction with Ran-GTP causes a conformational change in the importin that causes it to dissociate from its cargo. The resulting complex of importin and Ran-GTP then translocates to the cytoplasm, where a protein called Ran Binding Protein (RanBP) separates Ran-GTP from importin. Separation allows access to a GTPase activating protein (GAP) that binds Ran-GTP and induces the hydrolysis of GTP to GDP. The Ran-GDP produced from this process now binds the nuclear transport factor NUTF2 which returns it to the nucleoplasm. Now in the nucleus, the Ran-GDP interacts with a <b>guanine</b> <b>nucleotide</b> exchange factor (GEF) which replaces the GDP with GTP, resulting again in Ran-GTP, and beginning the cycle anew.|$|E

Soc. Trans. 14, 1135 – 1136]. We have now tested the specificity of various nucleotides in regulating PIC activity in the absence or presence of the hormone cholecystokinin (CCK- 8) in saponin-permeabilized [3 H]inositol-labelled Flow 9000 cells. We found that all nucleotides tested (i. e.

2500|$|The {{process of}} exchanging the bound {{nucleotide}} is facilitated by <b>guanine</b> <b>nucleotide</b> exchange factors (GEFs) and GTPase activating proteins (GAPs). As per its classification, Ras has an intrinsic GTPase activity, {{which means that}} the protein on its own will hydrolyze a bound GTP molecule into GDP. However this process is too slow for efficient function, and hence the GAP for Ras, RasGAP, may bind to and stabilize the catalytic machinery of Ras, supplying additional catalytic residues ("arginine finger") such that a water molecule is optimally positioned for nucleophilic attack on the gamma-phosphate of GTP. An inorganic phosphate is released and the Ras molecule is now bound to a GDP.

Upon receptor activation, the GEF domain, in turn, allosterically activates the G-protein by facilitating {{the exchange of}} a molecule of GDP for GTP at the G-protein's α-subunit. The cell maintains a 10:1 ratio of cytosolic GTP:GDP so exchange for GTP is ensured. At this point, the subunits of the G-protein dissociate from the receptor, as well as each other, to yield a Gα-GTP monomer and a tightly interacting Gβγ dimer, which are now free to modulate the activity of other intracellular proteins.

A variety of <b>guanine</b> <b>nucleotides</b> were examined {{with respect to}} their abilities to modulate this response. GTP, along with its analogues 5 '-guanylylimidodiphosphate (Gpp[NH]p) and guanosine- 5 '-O-[3 -thio]-triphosphate (GTP[[gamma]S]) decreased the Ca 2 + requirements for secretion of all three granule constituents by one third to one order of magnitude.
