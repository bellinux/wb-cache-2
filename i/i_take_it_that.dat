2500|$|Olivia {{restricted}} {{contact between}} the two after the trip. [...] Days before Pound was to leave for an extended stay in the US, Dorothy wrote him promising to abide by her mother's stricture and exhorting him to follow her lead: [...] "In case I do not see you alone on Wednesday, <b>I</b> <b>take</b> <b>it</b> <b>that</b> during your 'exile' you have been forbidden to write to me?.... if you have promised—don't break your word—don't write to me!" [...] Olivia allowed Dorothy to write a thank-you note when Pound's Canzoni were published—that he dedicated to Olivia and Dorothy—the only instance when she let Dorothy contact him directly. John Harwood, Olivia Sharkespear biographer, [...] writes that Dorothy's lack of resistance seems extreme, even by Edwardian standards; however, he speculates that Olivia's motives were to keep Dorothy's behaviour controlled, whereas Pound's behaviour was ignored.|$|E
60|$|TWISDEN. <b>I</b> <b>take</b> <b>it</b> <b>that</b> General Canynge won't say {{anything}} he's not compelled to say.|$|E
60|$|RANDALL. <b>I</b> <b>take</b> <b>it</b> <b>that</b> we may {{be quite}} frank. I mean about Lady Utterword.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>took</b> <b>it</b> <b>that</b> {{he wanted}} my {{opinion of the}} female poisoner who had just left us.|$|R
60|$|Her old {{face was}} full of trouble as she shook her head. <b>I</b> <b>took</b> <b>it</b> <b>that</b> she did not know.|$|R
60|$|I {{could not}} but feel that Art was keeping back something. But, as <b>I</b> <b>took</b> <b>it</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> {{was with a}} purpose, I said nothing.|$|R
6000|$|... "Lastly, as to yourself, <b>I</b> <b>take</b> <b>it</b> <b>that</b> {{nothing would}} induce you to fly with your Burgundian friends while your lady is in hiding in Paris?" ...|$|E
6000|$|ELIZABETH. Perhaps; {{but we have}} seamen. Count de Feria, <b>I</b> <b>take</b> <b>it</b> <b>that</b> the King hath {{spoken to}} you; But is Don Carlos such a goodly match? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{have seen}} {{very little of}} you, Maiyo," [...] he said, [...] "since your last visit to the Continent. <b>I</b> <b>take</b> <b>it</b> <b>that</b> your views are unchanged?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{noticed he}} did {{look at me}} pretty closely a number of times," [...] {{answered}} our hero. [...] "But <b>I</b> <b>took</b> <b>it</b> <b>that</b> he {{was only trying to}} size me up. You know some strangers have that habit." ...|$|R
60|$|I dined at {{the club}} and looked in at a show afterward, and it wasn't till fairly late that I {{got back to the}} flat. There were no signs of Motty, and <b>I</b> <b>took</b> <b>it</b> <b>that</b> he had gone to bed.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Would {{you be so}} kind as {{to explain}} it to me?' said Violet, in such serious {{distress}} that he answered with less trifling than usual, 'There is nothing to tell. I knew how it would be if I asked leave, so <b>I</b> <b>took</b> <b>it.</b> <b>That's</b> all.' ...|$|R
6000|$|<b>I</b> <b>take</b> <b>it</b> <b>that</b> {{the good}} of mankind means the attainment, by every man, of all the {{happiness}} which he can enjoy without diminishing the happiness of his fellow-men.[1] ...|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>take</b> <b>it</b> <b>that</b> the Farmer's Boy is poetry, {{not merely}} {{slightly}} poetized prose {{in the form}} of verse, although it is undoubtedly poetry of a very humble order.|$|E
6000|$|... "Now," [...] said Harding curtly, [...] "I'm {{going to}} give you my opinion. <b>I</b> <b>take</b> <b>it</b> <b>that</b> your uncle is a man who tries to do the square thing?" ...|$|E
40|$|Twits Messersmith on the Einstein incident; "as {{he himself}} [Einstein]has told us, {{everything}} is relative, and so <b>I</b> <b>took</b> <b>it</b> <b>that</b> you {{had only been}} relatively disagreeable and nasty to an extent which he only relatively deserved [...] . may it be a lesson to you never again to say things in Berlin {{when you are in}} Breslau. ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Sufficient, too," [...] said Psmith, [...] "quite sufficient, <b>I</b> <b>take</b> <b>it,</b> then, <b>that</b> {{he is now}} on the warpath, {{collecting}} a gang, so to speak." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Mannering," [...] he said, slowly, [...] "am <b>I</b> to <b>take</b> <b>it</b> <b>that</b> {{you have}} spoken your last word? I am to write my mission down a failure?" ...|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>take</b> <b>it</b> <b>that</b> {{the good}} of mankind means the attainment, by every man, of all the {{happiness}} which he can enjoy without diminishing the happiness of his fellow men.|$|E
6000|$|... "Then may <b>I</b> <b>take</b> <b>it</b> <b>that</b> Miss Kynaston's {{words have}} not--damaged {{me in your}} esteem?" [...] he went on, his voice quivering a little with {{suppressed}} anxiety. [...] "You do not--believe--that----" ...|$|E
6000|$|Mr. Caryll smiled fondly upon him. [...] "From your manner <b>I</b> <b>take</b> <b>it</b> <b>that</b> on {{your side}} you {{practice}} a more Christian virtue. It is plain that you forgive me the sequel." ...|$|E
60|$|I, too, {{went away}} {{somewhat}} bewildered, for much {{had happened to}} me that morning which I found it hard to understand. Why had the Augusta kissed me? <b>I</b> <b>took</b> <b>it</b> <b>that</b> this was some kind of imperial jest. <b>It</b> was known <b>that</b> I kept aloof from women, and she may have desired to see what I should do when an Augusta kissed me, and then to make a mock of me. I had heard that she had done as much with others.|$|R
6000|$|... "That," [...] he answered, [...] "I {{will leave}} to you. <b>I</b> <b>take</b> <b>it</b> then <b>that</b> {{you have no}} {{suspicion}} that your servant is any other than he professes to be?" ...|$|R
60|$|Once there {{appeared}} a strange optical effect. When he stood {{between me and}} the flame he did not obstruct it, for I could see its ghostly flicker all the same. This startled me, but as the effect was only momentary, <b>I</b> <b>took</b> <b>it</b> <b>that</b> my eyes deceived me straining through the darkness. Then for a time there were no blue flames, and we sped onwards through the gloom, with the howling of the wolves around us, as though they were following in a moving circle.|$|R
6000|$|... "Ah! <b>I</b> <b>take</b> <b>it</b> <b>that</b> being now in minor orders, {{you already}} possess the {{confidence}} of the Almighty. He will have confided to you His intention of changing the pattern of mankind." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Of course. <b>I</b> <b>take</b> <b>it</b> <b>that</b> {{that was}} why you came over here, because you {{realised}} how you were wasting your life and wanted a chance of making good in my office." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "How then?" [...] said Mr. Skimpole with an {{appearance}} of the utmost simplicity and candour. [...] "Just the same then! I should say, 'My esteemed Boythorn'--to make you the personification of our imaginary friend--'my esteemed Boythorn, you object to the mighty potentate? Very good. So do I. <b>I</b> <b>take</b> <b>it</b> <b>that</b> my business in the social system is to be agreeable; <b>I</b> <b>take</b> <b>it</b> <b>that</b> everybody's business in the social system is to be agreeable. It's a system of harmony, in short. Therefore if you object, I object. Now, excellent Boythorn, let us go to dinner!'" ...|$|E
60|$|There, {{out on the}} rain-beaten terrace, {{stood the}} white {{shrouded}} figure, more desolate-appearing than ever. Ghastly pale she looked, as before, but her eyes had an eager look which was new. <b>I</b> <b>took</b> <b>it</b> <b>that</b> she was attracted by the fire, which was by now well ablaze, and was throwing up jets of flame as the dry logs crackled. The leaping flames threw fitful light across the room, and every gleam threw the white-clad figure into prominence, showing the gleam of the black eyes, and fixing the stars that lay in them.|$|R
6000|$|... "Did I?" [...] she replied, in an {{incidental}} and forgetful way. [...] "I remember I entertained a great {{objection to}} your adversary, because <b>I</b> <b>took</b> <b>it</b> ill <b>that</b> {{he should be}} brought here to pester me with his company." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "There {{are three}} 'tall trees,'" [...] said he, [...] "about {{in the right}} line from Skeleton Island. 'Spy-glass Shoulder,' <b>I</b> <b>take</b> <b>it,</b> means <b>that</b> lower p'int there. It's child's-play to find the stuff now. I've half a mind to dine first." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Thank you, sir. <b>I</b> <b>take</b> <b>it</b> <b>that</b> what I say {{is not to}} pass beyond you--not to anyone. Not to Miss Trelawny herself, or even to Mr. Trelawny when {{he becomes}} well again." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I'll be very careful," [...] Walters {{said with}} a {{grateful}} look. [...] "May <b>I</b> <b>take</b> <b>it</b> <b>that</b> your consent {{is a sign that}} you'll try to forgive me for my share in the accident?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'My aunt {{has chosen}} to remain away, {{thinking}} that you might wish to see me privately. But <b>I</b> <b>take</b> <b>it</b> <b>that</b> there is nothing which she may not share. I have no secrets from her.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And am <b>I</b> to <b>take</b> <b>it</b> <b>that</b> you, {{knowing all}} {{as we know}} it who have {{followed}} the matter for years, wish to share in the experiment which we hope to make?" [...] His answer was direct and uncompromising: ...|$|R
6000|$|DANCY. [Slowly] That {{is a very}} {{expensive}} business, Lord St Erth, and I'm hard up. I must think it over. [He looks round from face to face] Am <b>I</b> to <b>take</b> <b>it</b> <b>that</b> there is a doubt in your minds, gentlemen? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "There {{are three}} 'tall trees'" [...] said he, [...] "about {{in the right}} line from Skeleton Island. 'Spy-glass shoulder,' <b>I</b> <b>take</b> <b>it,</b> means <b>that</b> lower p'int there. It's child's play to find the stuff now. I've half a mind to dine first." ...|$|R
