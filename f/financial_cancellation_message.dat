In large fan-out topologies, however, the scheme performs poorly; the scheme can actually end up sending more negative messages than the time warp protocol, many of them to destinations {{that would not have}} received negative messages if output queues were maintained. In this paper, we explore the issue whether maintaining a small amount of hint information about likely destinations, in place of the entire output queue, makes the scheme effective for large-fanout topologies.

The critical inci-dent technique (CIT) is a general methodology that uncovers usability problems by analyzing troubling user interactions. We adapt CIT to refactoring tools and show that alternate refactoring paths are indicators of the usability problems of refactoring tools. We define an alternate refactoring path as a sequence of user interactions that contains <b>cancellations,</b> reported <b>messages,</b> or repeated invocations of the refactoring tool. We evaluated our method on a large corpus of refactor-ing usage data, which we collected during a field study on 36 programmers over three months.

40|$|The 1964 Labour {{government}} {{inherited a}} substantial balance-of-payments deficit. In {{an effort to}} deal with the attendant economic crisis, the government sought to cancel a number of costly, high-prestige projects, including the Franco-British supersonic airliner Concorde. When the possible ramifications of this were considered, however, it was discovered that the agreement covering the aircraft was not commercial but carried the full force of an international treaty. The clear implication of this was that a withdrawing party could be subject to heavy <b>financial</b> penalties. <b>Cancellation,</b> therefore, it was argued, was likely to cost even more than continuing with the project would. The question remains as to how such a remarkable situation had come about. This article analyses the negotiations between Britain and France concerning Concorde, particularly in the early 1960 s, which eventually led to the signing of the treaty in 1962. It examines the political, technological, and economic imperatives which underpinned the negotiations and the relationships between the two governments and their respective aviation industries. It also considers the motives of both the British and French governments in the process, and concludes that in each case that the technological and political motives overrode economic considerations...|$|R
40|$|Simulation has {{traditionally}} been used for analyzing the behavior of complex real world problems. Even though only some features of the problems are considered, simulation time tends to become quite high even for common simulation problems. Parallel and distributed simulation is a viable technique for accelerating the simulations. The success of parallel simulation depends heavily on {{the combination of the}} simulation application, algorithm and message population in the simulation is sufficient, no additional delay is caused by this environment. In this thesis a conservative, parallel simulation algorithm is applied to the simulation of a cellular network application in a distributed workstation environment. This thesis presents a distributed simulation environment, Diworse, which is based on the use of networked workstations. The distributed environment is considered especially hard for conservative simulation algorithms due to the high cost of communication. In this thesis, however, the distributed environment is shown to be a viable alternative if the amount of communication is kept reasonable. Novel ideas of multiple message simulation and channel reduction enable efficient use of this environment for the simulation of a cellular network application. The distribution of the simulation is based on a modification of the well known Chandy-Misra deadlock avoidance algorithm with null messages. The basic Chandy Misra algorithm is modified by using the null <b>message</b> <b>cancellation</b> and multiple <b>message</b> simulation techniques. The modifications reduce the amount of null messages and the time required for their execution, thus reducing the simulation time required. The null <b>message</b> <b>cancellation</b> technique reduces the processing time of null messages as the arriving null message cancels other non processed null messages. The multiple message simulation forms groups of messages as it simulates several messages before it releases the new created messages. If the message population in the simulation is suffiecient, no additional delay is caused by this operation A new technique for considering the simulation application is also presented. The performance is improved by establishing a neighborhood for the simulation elements. The neighborhood concept is based on a channel reduction technique, where the properties of the application exclusively determine which connections are necessary when a certain accuracy for simulation results is required. Distributed simulation is also analyzed in order to find out the effect of the different elements in the implemented simulation environment. This analysis is performed by using critical path analysis. Critical path analysis allows determination of a lower bound for the simulation time. In this thesis critical times are computed for sequential and parallel traces. The analysis based on sequential traces reveals the parallel properties of the application whereas the analysis based on parallel traces reveals the properties of the environment and the distribution...|$|R

40|$|The {{international}} community recognises that increasing {{the provision of}} affordable housing {{is one of the}} major development challenges of the twenty-first century. This challenge is even more severe in developing economies with high population such as Nigeria, where the government has tried a variety of housing initiatives to help address the challenge but to relatively very little effect. One of the recent initiatives involves the use of Public Private Partnership (PPP). Unfortunately, the strategy used to date does not accurately reflect what is needed to stimulate and broaden housing provision (NHP, 2012). This thesis sought to understand this major policy issue by examining how an effective PPP approach could assist in increasing affordable housing delivery. The dearth of affordable housing is a national concern, with the federal government of Nigeria estimating that there is a deficit of 23 million houses in Nigeria (FGN, 2013). The aim of this study is to develop a PPP framework for the implementation of affordable housing delivery in Nigeria. To do this, the research develops a framework based on five components: capacity development, operating environment, project development, project financing and government commitment. The research also uses the Institutional Analysis and Development (IAD) Framework to analyse and initiate housing policy reform for PPP arrangement. The IAD Framework helps to understand key variables and the process to evaluate the effectiveness of using PPP as a mechanism for affordable housing delivery in Nigeria. The research was based upon in-depth literature review and primary data collection using semi-structured interviews with various practitioners in the public and private sectors using PPP for housing delivery in Nigeria. The research provides further evidence on constraints that are hindering the effectiveness of PPP on affordable housing delivery in Nigeria, including lack of regulation guarantee, poor financial projections, poor feasibility assessments, poor communication, inadequate <b>financial</b> resources, project <b>cancellation</b> and contract renegotiation etc. PPP needs to develop a clear statement of objectives for affordable housing delivery, well-communicated strategy, a clear institutional framework, independent oversight, sustainable financing mechanisms and allow flexibility for implementation in order to mitigate these constraints. In addition to providing the basis for more effective housing policy, the research develops a PPP model for affordable housing delivery. These findings could assist in developing effective tools to enhance the process, build appropriate institutions and legal system for a fairer and more transparent environment to facilitate the private sector involvement in affordable housing delivery in Nigeria...|$|R
40|$|Abstract {{submitted}} to ISEE 2012 Theme: The Political Economy of Green Development By Rikard Warlenius PhD Candidate Human Ecology Division Lund University, Sweden 2011. 11. 24 Calculating Climate Debt. A Comparison and a Proposal The notion of climate debt has invoked widespread {{interest in the}} last few years. First conceptualized in 1999 within the Millennium movement for (<b>financial)</b> debt <b>cancellation,</b> it was from the start a bottom-up approach, elaborated within the social and environmental movements rather than by states or academia. Demands to repay the climate debt were raised by hundreds of organizations, mainly from the global South, in 2009 and later also by states such as Bolivia and the 49 Least Developed Countries. Climate debt should be seen {{as a part of the}} wider ecological debt, a concept that was first introduced by Instituto de Ecología Politica before the Rio Earth Summit 20 years ago. Both concepts share the virtue of switching the commonly perceived positions of debtors and creditors in the world economy. While most other approaches to quantifying ecological and climate inequalities have been developed by researchers and have quite rigorous methodologies, climate debt is more of an 'open access' concept and lacks a unified way of defining, conceptualizing and calculating. One of the main goals of the research project Environmental Justice Organizations, Liabilities and Trade (Ejolt) is to empower Environmental Justice Organizations (EJOs) by transfer of scientific methodologies. Ecological debt, including climate debt, is identified as one of the key concepts. According to Ejoltʼs description, “[t]here is a demand from international EJOs and also from government officials for the instruction of the methodology of such calculations in terms that activists and citizens can understand” (Ejolt 2010). In an attempt to respond to this demand, this paper discusses and compares several efforts to quantify climate debt and similar concepts by activist-researchers (Simms 2009, Khor 2010), NGO campaigns (FOEI 2005, Jubilee Debt Campaign 2007, Third World Network 2009), UN bodies (UNDP 2007, WESS 2009) and scholars (Botzen et al 2008, Paredis et al 2008, Srinivasan et al 2008, Goeminne & Paredis 2010). A “new” method is proposed that is in line with the definition that has emerged from the climate justice movement, is accurate and user-friendly. The climate debt of a country is thus calculated as its actual emissions over time minus its fair per capita share of a “safe”, sustainable level of global emissions. The formula, CDC = ECP–(SW*T*PopC/PopW) is to be understood as CDC (climate debt of country C), ECP (C's total emissions during the time period T), SW (a sustainable level of global, annual CO 2 -emissions that is absorbed by the ecosystems without damaging their functions), T (the time period of choice), PopC (population of C at the end of P) and PopW (world population at the end of T). The method (hence referred to as RWa) is similar to “Model 1 ” of Paredis et al. (referred to as EP), which arguably is more historically correct but requires significantly more data and calculations. RWa has a model bias compared to EP that results in greater climate debt (or smaller climate claim) for countries whose population – as a rate of world population – is decreasing; i. e. generally developed countries. This bias can largely be obviated by a simple methodological innovation whereby the mean value of the population rates of the country in the beginning and end of the time period is used instead of the end value (RWb). Differing assumptions however cause greater result differences than the formal construction of the models. While Paredis et al. propose a level of global, annual emissions at 9 GtCO 2, I suggest that long-term sustainability requires a level of 3 GtCO 2. In Table 1, the climate debt for Guatemala and Sweden 1990 - 2000 resulting from the models EP 9 (with a sustainable level of 9 GtCO 2), RWa 9, RWb 9 and RWb 3 (3 GtCO 2) is reported. Note that the model bias of RWa 9 is largely obviated in RWb 9. Table 1. Sweden's and Guatemala's Climate Debt/Claim 1990 – 2000 according to four models (MtCO 2) EP 9 RWa 9 RWb 9 RWb 3 Guatemala - 111 - 135 - 118 8, 2 Sweden 481 489 481 583 The stronger ecological concern of RWb 3 increases the climate debt of both Sweden and Guatemala; actually turning the latter’s climate claim into a debt if only counting for the period 1990 - 2000. An advantage of the RW-model, however, is that the debt over longer periods of time can be calculated relatively easily. In the elaborated paper, methods will be compared, results for more countries and region will be shown, the historical and theoretical foundations of the concept further described, and assumptions discussed in depth. Finally, I will make some suggestions on how the climate debt can be repaid...|$|R
