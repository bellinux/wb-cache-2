40|$|The series DC machine {{operates}} as a series DC motor or as a series universal AC motor when fed from a DC or an AC supply respectively. Series DC motors {{have been used in}} many industrial applications which require a high starting torque and a considerably adjustable range of speeds. Series universal AC motors are used in fractional horsepower ratings in many domestic appliances. The series DC machine also generates DC voltage when driven by a prime mover and connected to a DC load where the machine has rising voltage characteristics such that with <b>increase</b> in load <b>its</b> <b>voltage</b> <b>is</b> also <b>increased</b> and therefore it is normally used as a booster. In this paper, the series DC generator is operated as a series universal AC generator through an excitation capacitor. The armature winding, field winding, excitation capacitor and the load are connected in series. The voltage building up process takes place due to residual magnetism and the machine is self-excited and at steady state operates in the saturation region. The machine runs at resonance meaning that the generated induced emf is in phase with the armature current. The frequency of this machine is not synchronized with speed. The theory of operation is explained and the transient and steady state analysis are predicted and experimentally investigated...|$|R

30|$|The {{lifetime}} of the lithium battery determines {{the life of}} the entire system. Based on the premise of not affecting the system work, reducing the charge-discharge cycles of the battery is very helpful. Experimental results show that the lithium battery can work for a long time when <b>its</b> <b>voltage</b> <b>is</b> between 3.7 – 3.9  V, but if the <b>voltage</b> <b>is</b> lower than the threshold, it drops rapidly with discharge going on. So the lithium battery should be charged at once when <b>its</b> <b>voltage</b> <b>is</b> under the threshold. Critically, if the battery <b>voltage</b> <b>is</b> lower than the danger boundary, it may be eternally damaged, so discharge should be stopped immediately, and the system has to do something to avoid this from happening [35].|$|R
