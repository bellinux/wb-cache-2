50|$|In the {{aftermath}} of World War Two, the communist regime came to power and Muslims, most from southern Albania were represented from early on within the communist leadership group such as leader Enver Hoxha 1908-1985), his deputy Mehmet Shehu (1913-1981) and others. Albanian society was still traditionally divided between four religious communities. In the Albanian census of 1945, Muslims were 72% of the population, 17.2% were Orthodox and 10% Catholic. The communist regime through Albanian Nationalism attempted to forge a national identity that transcended and eroded these religious and other differences {{with the aim of}} forming a unitary Albanian identity. Albanian communists viewed religion as a societal threat that undermined the cohesiveness of the nation. Within this context, religions like Islam were denounced as foreign and clergy such as Muslim muftis were criticised as being socially backward with the propensity to become agents of other states and undermine Albanian interests. The Bektashi order at a congress in May 1945 reaffirmed within their statutes its independence from the Sunni community in Albania. In 1949, a law was passed that required religious institutions to inculcate feelings of loyalty among their adherents to the Albanian communist party and that all religions had to have their headquarters in Albania. Akin to the Orthodox, the Bektashi's entered into agreements with the communist state without difficulties which defined what was considered acceptable activities of their religious clergy and the <b>declaration</b> <b>of</b> <b>participation</b> in communist propaganda campaigns. The communists during this time treated the Bektashi's somewhat differently as part of their clergy and adherents were casualties during fighting in World War Two while some Albanian communist elites had Bektashi heritage. Whereas of the Sunni Muslim clergy individuals such as Mustafa efendi Varoshi (mufti of Durrës), Hafez Ibrahim Dibra (former great mufti of Albania) and Xhemal Pazari (a prominent sheikh from Tiranë) were accused by the communists of collaborating with Axis occupying powers and imprisoned.|$|E
40|$|Introduction Down {{syndrome}} {{results in}} neuromotor impairment that affects selective motor control, compromising {{the acquisition of}} motor skills and functional independence. The aim of the proposed study is to evaluate and compare the effects of multiple-monopolar anodal transcranial direct current stimulation and sham stimulation over the primary motor cortex during upper limb motor training involving virtual reality on motor control, muscle activity, cerebral activity and functional independence. Methods and analysis A randomised, controlled, double-blind, clinical trial is proposed. The calculation of the sample size will be defined {{based on the results}} of a pilot study involving the same methods. The participants will be randomly allocated to two groups. Evaluations will be conducted before and after the intervention as well as 1 month after the end of the intervention process. At each evaluation, three-dimensional analysis of upper limb movement muscle activity will be measured using electromyography, cerebral activity will be measured using an electroencephalogram system and intellectual capacity will be assessed using the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children. Virtual reality training will be performed three times a week (one 20 min session per day) for a total of 10 sessions. During the protocol, transcranial stimulation will be administered concomitantly to upper limb motor training. The results will be analysed statistically, with a p valueâ 8 ̆ 9 ¤ 0. 05 considered indicative of statistical significance. Ethical aspects and publicity The present study received approval from the Institutional Review Board of Universidade Nove de Julho (Sao Paulo,Brazil) under process number 1. 540. 113 and is registered with the Brazilian Registry of Clinical Trials (NÂ° RBR 3 PHPXB).

40|$|The article {{analyzes}} the social-type activities of rural inhabitants {{on the local}} scale. The empirical basis for {{the analysis was provided}} by studies conducted in 1971 on a sample of 1, 514 married couples in nine rural administrative communes in different parts of Poland. The author distinguishes between the real activity (encompassed in three dimensions: active declaration of needs of the local aggregation, voluntary physical and financial assistance in accomplishing local goals, and membership in local organizations), and the potential activity (including also three dimensions: acceptance of general norms concerning active involvement in local affaire, <b>declaration</b> <b>of</b> <b>participation</b> in implementation of the planned investment programme and confidence in feasibility of this programme). A quantitative analysis of data allows the author to discuss the extent of common character of this phenomenon of activity in the above mentioned dimensions, its differentiation, and its correlation convergence with several cross-sections of the aggregation's structure (objective and those connected with awareness) as well as activity types (in the sense of systems built from combination of the above dimensions). As regards the real activity, it was revealed that, among others, it continued to be almost common in rural communities, and mainly in the form of contributions made for local aggregations and in formal participation while, on the other hand, it was more seldom taking the form of declaration of needs. Thus the type of activity consisting in local contributions and formal participation appears to be predominant here, while the exclusively declarative type does not exist. On the other hand, full activity (in all dimensions) seems to be more frequent than full passivity. This activity is most strongly differentiated by objective factors such as spatial variables, cultural participation, and socio-professional membership, while the importance of awereness factors (attitudes towards the village, locality, and authorities) in attitudes towards the village is smaller. Similarly such factors as belonging to a definite generation,educational background, and material situation play a smaller role. In turn, in the potential activity sphere, it was revealed, among others, that it encompasses bigger aggregations being expressed, first of all, in almost common acceptance of general norms, and mere seldom in readiness to participate personally in carrying out investment projects, and in confidence in feasibility of the local development programmes. Thus in practice the exclusively confidence-activity type or declaration-confidence type are absent while the full activity ins also more frequent here than the full passivity. Correlates of the potential activity raprese,nt a somewhat different system. It is also most strongly differentiated by spatial variables and socio-profcosional membership, and moreover it is differentiated by cultural participation on the local scale and some awareness factors like postulates concerning development of the locality, attitudes to the village, administrative rural communes, and local authorities. Similarly, material differentiation, educational background as well as participation in the mass culture appear to be insignificant. Finally, while comparing these two activity spheres there was diecovered a statistically highly significant convergence of all the six analyzed dimensions and generally smaller occurence of the potential than real activity. This last aspect is all the more important since the analyzed rural communes, encompassed by the government programme of model development, were given an exceptional chance, which although delusive in practice constituted e factor of psychological and organizational mobilization of local social forces during the examined period. Comparison of activity levels in particular dimensions and a system of its correlates allow to draw two conclusions^ Firstly, the real activity was largely forced and only seemingly voluntary. eecondly, the potential activity was weakened mainly through lack of people's confidence in feasibility of development programmes imposed from outside. And accordingly, ways to authentic social activation of villages do not lead through maximization of the potential activity Tformation of attitudes by means of ideological and propaganda manipulation and organizational extortion) but through change of objective conditions of the real activity or, in other words, through change of the really pursued policy in relation to the village and the agriculture.

The subject of the study was an analysis of the role of public benefit organizations in the context of resting youths in school. As a case study, we used the example of the "Our Szwedowo" Society, which has been organizing leisure activities for school children in northern Poland for many years. An analysis of the organizational activities of the company and the characteristics of tourist and leisure trips organized by them in the years 2012 - 2017 were analyzed. The results indicate that "Our Union" is an organization with a regional impact covering the central part of Poland.

40|$|According to the <b>Declaration</b> <b>of</b> Helsinki, <b>participation</b> <b>of</b> human {{subjects}} in medical research is only acceptable if subjects have given their consent. But in {{child abuse and}} neglect, many studies use a design in which subjects do not actively participate. Data in these studies are gathered from sources such as medical records or Child Protective Services. As long as such data are used anonymously, this does not interfere with individual privacy rights. However, some research is only possible when carried out with personally identifiable data, which could potentially be misused. In this paper, we discuss in which situations and under which conditions personal data of children {{may be used for}} a study without obtaining consent. In doing so, we make use of two recent studies, performed in our hospital, in which we encountered this issue. Both studies involved collecting personal data. After careful consideration, we decided not to ask informed consent; instead, we arranged for specific safeguards to protect the subject's and their parents' privacy as well as possible. Altogether, we conclude that our approach fits within the Dutch legal framework and seems a reasonable solution in situations in which individual privacy rights are at odds with the public interest of child abuse and neglect research. We argue that, although, in principle, data research is only acceptable after informed consent is obtained, the law should allow that, under specific circumstances and safeguards, this requirement is put aside to make research in the field of child abuse and neglect possible. • In principle, data research is only acceptable after informed consent is obtained. • In practice, this is not always feasible. • Under specific circumstances and safeguards, the informed consent requirement can be put asid...|$|R
40|$|Past Australian {{government}} policies have controlled, disenfranchised and infantilised Indigenous people, strongly contributing to their ongoing disadvantage and poverty. During Australia’s formal policy phase of self-determination, 1972 to 2004, Aboriginal people emphasised their fundamental desire {{to define and}} control their own priorities and destinies. This desire continues today, however the policy landscape is now more ambiguous than ever {{about the role of}} Aboriginal people in policy making. This thesis makes a case study of processes taking place when a remote NSW Aboriginal community asserted its right to participate in policy planning and decision-making. The research focused on negotiations between the Aboriginal community and government as a particular policy was implemented. The study aimed to investigate the extent to which Aboriginal people desire and pursue participation in policy making, and whether this is valued and enabled by governments. The methodology is informed by grounded theory and Indigenous research methodologies. Data was collected primarily via semi-structured interviews with Aboriginal community representatives and government officers over a three year period, along with policy analysis and observational data. Reciprocity and relationship building were vital to sustaining the researcher’s collaboration with the community over time. Now enshrined in the <b>Declaration</b> <b>of</b> Indigenous Rights, <b>participation</b> is an emerging concept and site of debate within the scholarship and practice of Indigenous policy making. This thesis makes a timely contribution to that scholarship by applying concepts <b>of</b> <b>participation</b> developed through four decades of practice, critique and theorising in the sphere of international development. Debates about what constitutes participation are salient to analysis of everyday negotiations between Aboriginal people and governments. The research reveals a strong drive and commitment from Aboriginal community representatives to participate as local decision-makers, and a range of imperatives that urge governments to strive to enable this. However structural and resource challenges undermined the level of Aboriginal involvement and quality <b>of</b> <b>participation</b> achieved. The study indicates that Aboriginal participation in policy decision-making may be essential to re-empower those affected by colonization, and enable Aboriginal agency in setting goals and aspirations to improve their own lives and livelihoods...|$|R
