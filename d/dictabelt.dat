25|$|In the March 2005 {{issue of}} Reader's Digest, it was {{reported}} that Carl Haber and Vitaliy Fadeyev were assigned with the task of digitally restoring <b>Dictabelt</b> 10 by Leslie Waffen from the National Archives. Their method consisted of using sensors to map the microscopic contours of the tracks of old sound recordings without having to play them using a stylus, which would further degrade the sound. <b>Dictabelt</b> 10 was worn from countless playings and cracked due to improper storage. By 2010 digital restoration of the <b>Dictabelt</b> seemed a more distant prospect, with both funding and final approval for the project unlikely to be secured in the near future.|$|E
25|$|In 1947, Dictaphone {{replaced}} wax cylinders {{with their}} <b>Dictabelt</b> technology, which cut a mechanical groove {{into a plastic}} belt instead of into a wax cylinder. This was later replaced by magnetic tape recording. However, cylinders for older style dictating machines continued to be available for some years, {{and it was not}} unusual to encounter cylinder dictating machines into the 1950s.|$|E
25|$|In 2003, ABC News aired {{the results}} of its {{investigation}} on a program called Peter Jennings Reporting: The Kennedy Assassination: Beyond Conspiracy. Based on computer diagrams and recreations done by Dale K. Myers, it concluded that the sound recordings on the <b>Dictabelt</b> could not have come from Dealey Plaza, and that Dallas Police Officer H.B. McLain was correct in his assertions {{that he had not}} yet entered Dealey Plaza {{at the time of the}} assassination.|$|E
50|$|<b>Dictabelts</b> {{were more}} {{convenient}} and provide better audio quality than the reusable wax cylinders they replaced. The belts can be folded for storage and will fit into an ordinary letter-size envelope. However, the plastic loses flexibility as it ages. If a belt is stored sharply folded {{for a long}} time, it will become permanently creased and unplayable without special treatment. <b>Dictabelts</b> were red until 1964, blue from 1964 to 1975, then purple until they were discontinued around 1980. Each has a capacity of about 15 minutes at the standard speed. At least one Dictaphone model featured a half-speed, low-fidelity 30-minute option.|$|R
25|$|In 2003, an {{independent}} researcher named Michael O'Dell reported {{that both the}} National Academy and Dr. Thomas had used incorrect timelines because they assumed the <b>Dictabelt</b> ran continuously. When corrected, these showed the impulses happened too late {{to be the real}} shots even with Thomas's alternative synchronization. In addition, he pointed out that the 95% or higher probability of a shot from the grassy knoll referred only to random noise (which all earlier research acknowledges), while the impulse could have been something else. He identifies it as speech, ignoring that the analysis that the impulse is from a shot is based on timing of echos.|$|E
25|$|Left {{unanswered}} by {{the professional}} analyses {{was the question}} of whose open microphone captured the sounds recorded on the <b>Dictabelt,</b> if not Officer H.B. McLain. Jim Bowles, a Dallas police dispatcher supervisor in November 1963, and later Dallas County Sheriff, believes it originated from a particular officer on a three-wheeled motorcycle stationed at the Dallas Trade Mart, the original destination of President Kennedy's motorcade, along the same freeway to Parkland Hospital, which would account {{for the sound of}} sirens rushing by. McLain himself believes that it was from a different officer on a three-wheeler near the Trade Mart, who was known for his whistling. When interviewed by author Vincent Bugliosi, the officer acknowledged that his microphone could have been stuck in the open position (he did not recall hearing any transmissions for several minutes), and could later have become unstuck after he followed the motorcade to Parkland Hospital.|$|E
2500|$|In December 1978, the House Select Committee on Assassinations (HSCA) had {{prepared}} {{a draft of}} its final report, concluding that Lee Harvey Oswald had acted as the lone assassin. However, after evidence from the <b>Dictabelt</b> recording was made available, the HSCA quickly reversed its conclusion and declared that a second gunman had fired the third of four shots heard. HSCA chef counsel G. Robert Blakey later said, [...] "If the acoustics come out that {{we made a mistake}} somewhere, I think that would end it." [...] Despite serious criticism of the scientific evidence and the HSCA's conclusions, speculation regarding the <b>Dictabelt</b> and the possibility of a second gunman persisted.|$|E
2500|$|According to Ramsey, noises on the <b>Dictabelt</b> were [...] "probably static". Louis Stokes, {{a member}} of the United States House of Representatives who chaired the HSCA, commented that the report [...] "raised new and serious {{questions}} about our conclusions that need to be resolved." ...|$|E
2500|$|Other audio {{discrepancies}} also exist. Crowd {{noise is}} not {{heard on the}} <b>Dictabelt</b> recording, despite the sounds generated from the many onlookers along Dallas's Main Street and in Dealey Plaza (crowd noises can be heard on at least ten channel-2 transmissions from the motorcade). Someone is heard whistling a tune about a minute after the assassination. [...] No one actually heard gunshots on the recording.|$|E
2500|$|The {{acoustical}} {{evidence has}} since been discredited. Officer H.B. McLain, from whose motorcycle radio the HSCA acoustic experts said the <b>Dictabelt</b> evidence came, has repeatedly stated {{that he was not}} yet in Dealey Plaza {{at the time of the}} assassination. McLain asked the Committee, [...] "‘If it was my radio on my motorcycle, why did it not record the revving up at high speed plus my siren when we immediately took off for Parkland Hospital?’” ...|$|E
2500|$|The adult {{magazine}} Gallery {{published a}} pull-out laminated cardboard recording (like {{those on the}} back of Cereal boxes) [...] of the <b>Dictabelt</b> recording in its July 1979 issue. An assassination researcher named Steve Barber listened to that recording repeatedly and heard the words [...] "Hold everything secure until the homicide and other investigators can get there" [...] {{at the point where the}} HSCA had concluded the assassination shots were recorded. However, those words were spoken by Sheriff Bill Decker about 90 seconds after the assassination, so the shots could not be when the HSCA claimed.|$|E
2500|$|The only {{evidence}} that HSCA {{had for a}} second shooter was the <b>Dictabelt</b> sound recording. [...] Four of the twelve HSCA members dissented to the HSCA's conclusion of conspiracy based on the acoustic findings, and a fifth thought a further study of the acoustic evidence was [...] "necessary". Dissenting {{members of the committee}} included Congressmen Samuel L. Devine, Robert W. Edgar, and Harold S. Sawyer. Responding to a question asking how he would handle the Committee's report if he were at the Justice Department, Sawyer replied: [...] "I'd file it in a circular file." ...|$|E
2500|$|Concerning the {{conclusions}} of [...] "probable conspiracy", four of the twelve committee members wrote dissenting opinions. In accordance with {{the recommendations of the}} HSCA, the <b>Dictabelt</b> recording and acoustic evidence of a second assassin was subsequently reexamined. In light of investigative reports from the FBI's Technical Services Division and a specially appointed National Academy of Sciences Committee determining that [...] "reliable acoustic data do not support a conclusion that there was a second gunman," [...] the Justice Department concluded [...] "that no persuasive evidence can be identified to support the theory of a conspiracy in ... the assassination of President Kennedy".|$|E
2500|$|Investigators {{compared}} [...] "impulse patterns" [...] (suspected gunshots {{and associated}} echos) on the <b>Dictabelt</b> to 1978 test recordings of Carcano rifles fired in Dealey Plaza from {{the sixth floor}} of the Texas School Book Depository and from a stockade fence on the grassy knoll forward {{and to the right}} of the location of the presidential limousine. On this basis, the acoustics firm of Bolt, Beranek and Newman concluded that impulse patterns 1, 2, and 4 were shots fired from the Depository, and that there was a 50% chance that impulse pattern 3 was a shot from the grassy knoll. Acoustics analysts Mark Weiss and Ernest Aschkenasy of Queens College reviewed the BBN data and concluded that [...] "with the probability of 95% or better, there was indeed a shot fired from the grassy knoll." ...|$|E
2500|$|The John F. Kennedy {{assassination}} <b>Dictabelt</b> recording was {{a recording}} from a motorcycle police officer's radio microphone {{stuck in the}} open position that became a key piece of evidence cited by the House Select Committee on Assassinations (HSCA) in their conclusion that there was a conspiracy behind the assassination of John F. Kennedy on November 22, 1963. Made on a common Dictaphone dictation machine that recorded sounds in grooves pressed into a thin vinyl-plastic belt, the recording gained prominence among Kennedy assassination conspiracy theorists from 1978, in which the HSCA used it to conclude that there was a [...] "high probability" [...] that Lee Harvey Oswald did not act alone and that the Kennedy assassination {{was the result of a}} conspiracy. Later scientific examination discredited this interpretation of the evidence.|$|E
2500|$|The Committee {{investigated}} until 1978, and in March 1979 {{issued its}} final report, concluding that President John F. Kennedy was probably assassinated {{as a result}} of a conspiracy. The chief reason for this conclusion was, according to the report's dissent, the subsequently discredited acoustic analysis of a police channel <b>dictabelt</b> recording. The Committee concluded that previous investigations into Oswald's responsibility were [...] "thorough and reliable" [...] but they did not adequately investigate the possibility of a conspiracy, and that Federal agencies performed with [...] "varying degrees of competency". Specifically, the FBI and CIA were found to be deficient in sharing information with other agencies and the Warren Commission. Instead of furnishing all information relevant to the investigation, the FBI and CIA only responded to specific requests and were still occasionally inadequate. Furthermore, the Secret Service did not properly analyze information it possessed prior to the assassination and was inadequately prepared to protect the President.|$|E
2500|$|In 1979, after {{a review}} of the {{evidence}} and of prior investigations, the United States House Select Committee on Assassinations (HSCA) largely concurred with the Warren Commission and was preparing to issue a finding that Oswald had acted alone in killing Kennedy. However, late in the Committee's proceedings a <b>dictabelt</b> recording was introduced, purportedly recording sounds heard in Dealey Plaza before, during and after the shots were fired. After an analysis by the firm Bolt, Beranek and Newman appeared to indicate more than three gunshots, the HSCA revised its findings to assert a [...] "high probability that two gunmen fired" [...] at Kennedy and that Kennedy [...] "was probably assassinated {{as the result of a}} conspiracy." [...] Although the Committee was [...] "unable to identify the other gunman or the extent of the conspiracy," [...] it made a number of further findings regarding the likelihood or unlikelihood that particular groups, named in the findings, were involved. Four of the twelve members of the HSCA dissented from this conclusion.|$|E
2500|$|The HSCA, {{using an}} amateur film {{shot of the}} motorcade, {{concluded}} that the recording originated from the motorcycle of police officer H. B. McLain, who later testified before the committee that his microphone was often stuck in the open position. However, McLain did not hear the actual recording until after his testimony, and upon hearing it he adamantly denied that the recording originated from his motorcycle. He said that the other sounds on the recording did not match his movements. Sirens are not heard on the recording until more than two minutes after what {{is supposed to be}} the sound of the shooting; however, McLain accompanied the motorcade to Parkland Hospital immediately after the shooting, with sirens blaring the entire time. When the sirens are heard on the <b>Dictabelt</b> recording, they rise and recede in pitch (the Doppler effect) and volume, as if passing by. McLain also said that the engine sound was clearly from a three-wheeled motorcycle, not the two-wheeler that he drove: [...] "There's no comparison to the two sounds." ...|$|E
2500|$|Dr. Barger, the HSCA's {{acoustics}} expert, {{when asked}} about this discovery and the NAS analysis, replied,Barber discovered a very weak spoken phrase on the DPD <b>Dictabelt</b> recording that is heard at {{about the time of}} the sound impulses we concluded were probably caused by the fourth shot. The NAS Committee has shown to our satisfaction that this phrase has the same origin as the same phrase heard also on the Audograph recording. The Audograph recording was originally made from the channel 2 radio. The common phrase is heard on channel 2 about a minute after the assassination would appear, from the context, to have taken place. Therefore, it would seem [...] [...] [...] that the sounds that we connected with gunfire were made about a minute after the assassination shots were fired. Upon reading the NAS report, we did a brief analysis of the Audograph dub that was made by the NAS Committee and loaned to us by them. We found some enigmatic features of this recording that occur at about the time that individuals react to the assassination. Therefore, we have doubt about the time synchronization of events on that recording, and so we doubt that the Barber hypothesis is proven. The NAS Committee did not examine the several items of evidence that corroborated our original findings, so that we still agree with the House Select Committee on Assassinations conclusion that our findings were corroborated ...|$|E

5000|$|The <b>Dictabelt,</b> {{in early}} years {{and much less}} {{commonly}} also called a Memobelt, is an analog audio recording medium commercially introduced by the American Dictaphone company in 1947. Having been intended for recording dictation and other speech for later transcription, it is a write-once-read-many medium consisting of a [...] thick transparent vinyl plastic belt 3.5 in wide and 12 in around. The belt is loaded onto a pair of metal cylinders, put under tension, then rotated like a tank tread. It is inscribed with an audio-signal-modulated helical groove by a stylus which is slowly moved across the rotating belt. Unlike the stylus of a record cutter, the <b>Dictabelt</b> stylus is blunt and in recording mode it simply impresses a groove into the plastic rather than engraving it and throwing off a thread of waste material.|$|E
