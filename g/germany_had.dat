5|$|On {{the eve of}} World War I {{there were}} no traditions of nationally commemorating mass {{casualties}} in war. France and <b>Germany</b> <b>had</b> been relatively recently involved in the Franco-Prussian War of 1870 to 1871. <b>Germany</b> <b>had</b> built a number of national war memorials commemorating their victory, usually focusing on celebrating their military leaders. In France, memorials to their losses were relatively common, but {{far from being a}} national response, and many towns and villages did not erect memorials at all. A new organisation, the Souvenir Français, was established in the 1880s to protect French war memorials and encourage young French people to engage in military activities; the organisation grew to have many contacts in local government by 1914.|$|E

The German team had been undefeated up to that point, but had started off slow in its games against the United States and China, winning these games by six-point margins, and seemed to play its best basketball only in the final minutes of a game. They defeated the Australians 44–58 in front of a crowd of over 12,000 at the North Greenwich Arena to win the gold medal, the first that <b>Germany</b> <b>had</b> won in women's wheelchair basketball in 28 years.

5|$|Operation Teardrop was a United States Navy {{operation}} of World War II conducted during April and May 1945 to sink German U-boats approaching the United States East Coast that {{were believed to}} be armed with V-1 flying bombs. <b>Germany</b> <b>had</b> threatened in propaganda to attack New York with V-1 flying bombs and V-2 missiles.

5|$|After {{these steps}} {{alleviated}} {{the most urgent}} needs, the Austro-Hungarian Navy had adopted the German Type UB II design for {{what became known as}} the Austro-Hungarian U-27 class in mid 1915, and had six of that class being built under license in Austria-Hungary by late 1916. In November 1916, <b>Germany</b> <b>had</b> inquired to find out if Austria-Hungary were interested in purchasing existing German submarines because Germany was having a hard time finding trained submarine crews. After protracted negotiations, which had stalled over the outflow of Austro-Hungarian gold reserves to Germany, an agreement to purchase two submarines—UB-43 and UB-47—was reached in June 1917.|$|E
5|$|Allied forces {{remained}} in occupation of San Marino {{for a short}} period following the German surrender.

The British government rejected this claim, arguing that as <b>Germany</b> <b>had</b> breached the Sammarinese neutrality before Allied troops had entered the country, it was not liable; it did, however, offer an ex gratia payment of £26,000 in regard to the June bombing, later increased to £80,000 (about 33.6 million lira).|$|E

5|$|Although it is {{not fully}} {{understood}} how it came to his attention, Rochdale Town Hall was admired by Adolf Hitler. It has been suggested a visit by Hitler in 1912–13 while staying with his half-brother Alois Hitler, Jr. in Liverpool, or military intelligence on Rochdale, or information from Nazi sympathiser William Joyce (who had lived in Oldham), brought the building to his attention.

5|$|At the {{beginning}} of World War I in 1914, Dr. Robert Heindl of <b>Germany</b> <b>had</b> noted that the 15,000 political prisoners at the penal colony could create an undesirable revolution and therefore their release in one stage, following capture of the island by a German ship by bombardment, was risky. He suggested that after due care and adequate security had {{been put in place}} the convicts of the penal colony could be shifted to the mainland in small boats.|$|E
