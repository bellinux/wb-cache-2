5000|$|Enamel {{paint is}} paint that air dries to a hard, usually glossy, finish, used for coating {{surfaces}} that are outdoors or otherwise subject to hard wear or variations in temperature; {{it should not}} be confused with decorated objects in [...] "painted enamel", where <b>vitreous</b> <b>enamel</b> is applied with brushes and fired in a kiln. The name is something of a misnomer, as in reality, most commercially available enamel paints are significantly softer than either <b>vitreous</b> <b>enamel</b> or stoved synthetic resins, and are totally different in composition; <b>vitreous</b> <b>enamel</b> is applied as a powder or paste and then fired at high temperature. There is no generally accepted definition or standard for use of the term enamel paint, and not all enamel-type paints may use it.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. <b>Vitreous</b> <b>enamel</b> is a glassy coating {{formed on}} a metal {{substrate}} by firing at temperatures above 800 °C. The quality of <b>vitreous</b> <b>enamel</b> coating depends on the pre-treatment of the steel substrate surface {{and the quality of}} enamel slip. The main aim {{of this study was to}} characterize the composition of the steel substrate surface after firing with double finish, to explain the effect of steel substrate surface pre-treatment (blasting, acid pickling) on forming the phase interface of the steel substrate – vitreous coating system, and on its final microhardness, fracture strength and the adhesive properties of the coating. To achieve these aims, the following experimental methods were used: Mössbauer spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, electron analyzer, and EDAX. Based on the chemical composition of the initial enamel slip and the firing technology, the metal- enamel system interface exhibited various ratios of layers of magnetite, hematite, nonstoichiometric wüstite, and crystals of faylite. The measuring results indicate that the quality and age of enamel slip influences the brittle fracture properties of <b>vitreous</b> <b>enamel</b> coating...|$|R

You’ve probably seen the stuff: tables, saucepans, jugs, kettles …and exterior murals with enamel’. Also, pubs complained that murals became worn and dirty; vitreous-enamel painting lasted indefinitely.|$|R

40|$|This work {{examines}} the rheological behaviour of aqueous highly diluted suspensions (1 mass-%) to identify additives that may improve {{the application of}} <b>vitreous</b> <b>enamel</b> coatings by electrophoretic deposition (EPD). Slurries for EPD were prepared by ball milling frit glass in water with suspending agents. The effect of different additives in the solids concentration range from 0. 2 to 2. 0 mass-% on the rheological properties of coating solutions was investigated using rotational rheometry and zeta potential measurements. Different sedimentation times were observed for the tested dispersant, binder and coagulator additives. Densicer, an organic-inorganic mix additive, showed the best properties in terms of suspension stability. The high zeta potential measured with this product confirms its potential suitability as a suspension additive for <b>vitreous</b> <b>enamel</b> coatings applied by EPD...|$|R
