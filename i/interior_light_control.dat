40|$|The {{adoption}} of an <b>interior</b> <b>lighting</b> <b>control</b> {{system could be}} an efficient solution {{to reduce the amount}} of the electrical energy used for the medium and large tertiary and commercial buildings. The adequate regulation of the control system is essential but not simple to identify. The system programmer must do it at the installation start-up of the system. Moreover, during the first period of the life cycle of the system a technical management to monitor and fine-tune the control is necessary. In the research, the <b>interior</b> <b>lighting</b> <b>control</b> system installed into a university classroom is discussed as a case study. The control system is equipped with illuminance sensors that detect the punctual level of illuminance in the area below. A campaign of measurements on the field and simulations by software were carried out with different lighting scenarios. Particular relevance was given to the start-up activity. It consists in the adjusting the modulation of the flux emitted by the lamps in order to guarantee, in every scenario, the minimum average value of illuminance required by standards...|$|R

40|$|There {{has been}} growing {{interest}} in vehicle <b>interior</b> <b>lighting</b> for both functional and esthetic purposes. Although {{a large body of}} research has developed over many years on nighttime driver vision and vehicle exterior lighting, there has traditionally been little research attention to <b>interior</b> <b>lighting.</b> This report includes a brief review of some of the research that has been done, and presents the results of a nighttime field study that was performed to contribute to the understanding of how vehicle <b>interior</b> <b>lighting</b> affects some basic aspects of driver vision. Participants in the study were asked to perform two tasks while seated in a stationary experimental car on a closed test road at night: (1) detecting pedestrians on the road ahead, and (2) rating the subjective brightness of a reflected veiling light on the windshield. The veiling light was varied in both luminance and color. The results indicated that pedestrian detection was closely related to photopic photometric measures, suggesting the pedestrian task was influenced primarily by cone photoreceptors, while the rating of subjective brightness appeared to show an influence of rod photoreceptors. These results have implications for how the photometry of vehicle <b>interior</b> <b>lighting</b> should be performed in order to give the best correlation with driver visual performance. Future research should further quantify the effects observed here and investigate changes in retinal adaptation associated with automotive <b>interior</b> <b>lighting...</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{perceived}} {{atmosphere in}} a space is {{to a large extent}} determined by the illumination of the space, which usually is a combination of artificial lighting and daylight naturally entering the room. In this study we investigated how the presence of daylight affects the perceived atmosphere of a light ambience both in a real illuminated space and in a visualization of the space. The perceptual accuracy of these visualizations has been demonstrated in previous studies for artificial <b>interior</b> <b>lighting,</b> but not yet for the contribution of daylight to the <b>interior</b> <b>lighting.</b> Our results showed only a relatively small effect of the contribution of daylight both on the perception of light and the perception of the atmosphere of an <b>interior</b> <b>light</b> ambience. Possibly, adaptation {{plays an important role in}} this finding. Further, we demonstrated that the perceptual accuracy of visualizations containing daylight was for the majority of the light and atmosphere perception attributes similar to visualizations showing only artificial <b>interior</b> <b>lighting.</b> © (2015) COPYRIGHT Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE).
