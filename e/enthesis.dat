5000|$|... "Enthesis" [...] {{is rooted}} in the Ancient Greek word, [...] "ἔνθεσις" [...] or [...] "énthesis," [...] meaning “putting in," [...] or [...] "insertion." [...] This refers {{to the role of the}} <b>enthesis</b> as the site of {{attachment}} of bones with tendons or ligaments. Relatedly, in muscle terminology, the insertion is the site of attachment at the end with predominant movement or action (opposite of the origin). Thus the words (<b>enthesis</b> and insertion muscle) are proximal in the semantic field, but insertion in reference to muscle can refer to any relevant aspect of the site (i.e., the attachment per se, the bone, the tendon, or the entire area), whereas <b>enthesis</b> refers to the attachment per se and to ligamentous attachments as well as tendinous ones.|$|E

Materials and methods: Fifty individuals from late-medieval San Pablo were studied. The sample consisted of high-definition 3 D models of 17 <b>entheses</b> from the first, second, and fifth hand rays. A new methodology was introduced for quantifying their areas. Precision was verified using intraobserved and interobserver tests. Both raw and relative entheseal size (ratio of entheseal size to total bone surface size) were calculated. Bivariate analyses assessed the effect of age-group on <b>entheses</b> {{as well as the}} correlations across <b>entheses</b> of muscles that act synergistically, bone length, and articular surface size. The morphometric patterns among hand <b>entheses</b> were explored using a multivariate analysis. Results: The methodology presented no significant error. Age-group variation does not seem to affect hand <b>entheses.</b> In relative size, only particular pairs presented significant association and the <b>entheses</b> involved were not correlated with bone length or articular surface size. The multivariate analysis demonstrated high sexual dimorphism in overall entheseal size as well as two morphometric trends among hand <b>entheses.</b> Discussion: The proposed methodology can set the basis for further morphological 3 D analysis of <b>entheses.</b> If biomechanical stress affects hand <b>entheses,</b> its impact would possibly be greater on their relative size.

40|$|Background: Enthesitis is {{considered}} a characteristic presentation of {{the second most common}} group of rheumatoid disorders, i. e. spondyloarthropathies (SpAs), particularly peripheral spondyloarthropathies. At the initial stages, enthesitis may be the only symptom of SpA, particularly in patients lacking the HLA-B 27 receptor. Material/Methods: In light of diagnostic difficulties with detecting enthesitis in clinical examinations and laboratory investigations, many studies point out the high specificity of imaging studies, and particularly ultrasonography. Results: A total of 20 % Achilles tendon <b>entheses,</b> 45 % plantar aponeurosis <b>entheses</b> and 89. 5 % of flexor digiti brevis tendon <b>entheses</b> were unremarkable. In the remaining cases, the presentation of pathological lesions was not specific to enthesitis and might more likely correspond to degeneration or microinjuries of the <b>entheses,</b> beside the most obvious cases of achillobursitis or Kager's fat pad inflammation.

40|$|The tendon-bone {{interface}} (<b>enthesis)</b> is {{a highly}} sophisticated biomaterial junction that allows stress transfer between mechanically dissimilar materials. The <b>enthesis</b> encounters very high mechanical demands and the regenerative capacity is very low resulting in high rupture recurrence rates after surgery. Tissue engineering offers the potential to recover the functional integrity of entheses. However, recent <b>enthesis</b> tissue engineering approaches have been limited {{by the lack of}} knowledge about the cells present at this interface. Here we investigated the cellular differentiation of <b>enthesis</b> cells and compared the cellular pattern of <b>enthesis</b> cells to tendon and cartilage cells in a next generation sequencing transcriptome study. We integrated the transcriptome data with proteome data of a previous study to identify biomarkers of <b>enthesis</b> cell differentiation.

30|$|Results of {{the present}} work corroborate the {{qualitative}} observation of Sasaki et al.

Since in this study some CF and, to a lesser extent, UF was found in this region, it is believed that the ACL femoral <b>enthesis</b> is more properly categorized as a fibrocartilaginous <b>enthesis</b> (Schlecht 2012).|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to examine factors related to the {{occurrence}} of <b>enthesis</b> pain by long-term longitudinal investigation and measurement in junior high school soccer players, while intervening for its prevention. The subjects were 107 male junior high school soccer club members. The presence or absence of <b>enthesis</b> pain, the height growth velocity, muscle tightness, and alignment were longitudinally investigated, and stretching was instructed periodically. The time of <b>enthesis</b> pain occurrence was consistent with phase II of the height growth velocity curve in many cases. On comparison between before and after the appearance/disappearance of <b>enthesis</b> pain, no association was noted between the muscle tightness and occurrence of <b>enthesis</b> pain. But, on comparison of changes with time in muscle tightness, the tightness of the right quadriceps significantly increased, being useful for the prediction of <b>enthesis</b> pain. A significant increase in the Q-angle was also noted when <b>enthesis</b> pain appeared. Furthermore, the tightness of the bilateral iliopsoas, hamstrings, hip adductors, and gastrocnemius had significantly improved on the final measurement, showing that instruction in stretching was effective.

40|$|The femoral <b>enthesis</b> of {{the human}} {{anterior}} cruciate ligament (ACL) {{is known to be}} more susceptible to injury than the tibial <b>enthesis.</b> To determine whether anatomic differences might help explain this difference, we quantified the microscopic appearance of both entheses in 15 unembalmed knee specimens using light microscopy, toluidine blue stain and image analysis. The amount of calcified fibrocartilage and uncalcified fibrocartilage, and the ligament entheseal attachment angle were then compared between the femoral and tibial entheses via linear mixed‐effects models. The results showed marked differences in anatomy between the two entheses. The femoral <b>enthesis</b> exhibited a 3. 9 ‐fold more acute ligament attachment angle than the tibial <b>enthesis</b> (p[*]<[*] 0. 001), a 43 % greater calcified fibrocartilage tissue area (p[*]<[*] 0. 001), and a 226 % greater uncalcified fibrocartilage depth (p[*]<[*] 0. 001), with the latter differences being particularly pronounced in the central region. We conclude that the ACL femoral <b>enthesis</b> has more fibrocartilage and a more acute ligament attachment angle than the tibial <b>enthesis,</b> which provides insight into why it is more vulnerable to failure. © 2015 Orthopaedic Research Society.

40|$|The suprascapular {{ligament}} converts the {{suprascapular notch}} into a foramen separating the vessels and nerve {{of the same}} name. It connects 2 regions of the same bone and does not cross any joint, and no mechanical function has yet been attributed to it. Nevertheless, variations in its thickness and length, and its tendency to ossify, suggest that the ligament responds to changes in mechanical load. This should {{be reflected in the}} composition of the extracellular matrix. The primary {{purpose of the present study}} is to demonstrate that the suprascapular ligament has fibrocartilaginous <b>entheses</b> (i. e. insertion sites), even though there is no obvious change in insertional angle that directly results from joint movement. Such a change is more typical of tendons or ligaments that cross highly mobile joints. The complete ligament (including both <b>entheses)</b> was removed from 7 cadavers shortly after death and fixed in 90 % methanol. Cryosections were immunolabelled with a panel of monoclonal antibodies against collagens (types I, II, III, VI), glycosaminoglycans (chondroitin 4 sulphate, chondroitin 6 sulphate, dermatan sulphate and keratan sulphates), proteoglycans (aggrecan and versican) and link protein. Both <b>entheses</b> were strongly fibrocartilaginous, and a moderately fibrocartilaginous matrix was also detected throughout the remainder of the ligament. The extracellular matrix of both <b>entheses</b> labelled strongly for type II collagen, aggrecan and link protein. The fibrocartilaginous character of the <b>entheses</b> suggests that the insertion sites of the ligament are subject to both compressive and tensile loading and are regions of stress concentration. This in turn probably reflects the complex shape of the scapula and the presence of a conspicuous indentation (the suprascapular notch) near the ligament. The loading patterns may reflect either the attachment of muscles and/or the forces transmitted to the suprascapular ligament from the neighbouring coracoclavicular ligament...|$|R

40|$|Healing of {{rotator cuff}} (RC) {{injuries}} with current suture or augmented scaffold techniques fails to regenerate the <b>enthesis</b> and instead forms a weaker fibrovascular scar that {{is prone to}} subsequent failure. Regeneration of the <b>enthesis</b> {{is the key to}} improving clinical outcomes for RC injuries. We hypothesized that the utilization of our tissue-engineered tendon to repair either an acute or a chronic full-thickness supraspinatus tear would regenerate a functional <b>enthesis</b> and return the biomechanics of the tendon back to that found in native tissue. Engineered tendons were fabricated from bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells utilizing our well-described fabrication technology. Forty-three rats underwent unilateral detachment of the supraspinatus tendon followed by acute (immediate) or chronic (4 weeks retracted) repair by using either our engineered tendon or a trans-osseous suture technique. Animals were sacrificed at 8 weeks. Biomechanical and histological analyses of the regenerated <b>enthesis</b> and tendon were performed. Statistical analysis was performed by using a one-way analysis of variance with significance set at p[*]<[*] 0. 05. Acute repairs using engineered tendon had improved <b>enthesis</b> structure and lower biomechanical failures compared with suture repairs. Chronic repairs with engineered tendon had a more native-like <b>enthesis</b> with increased fibrocartilage formation, reduced scar formation, and lower biomechanical failure compared with suture repair.

40|$|BACKGROUND: The <b>enthesis,</b> which {{attaches}} the tendon to the bone, naturally disappears with aging, thus limiting joint mobility. Surgery {{is frequently}} needed but the clinical outcome is often poor {{due to the}} decreased natural healing capacity of the elderly. This study explored {{the benefits of a}} treatment based on injecting chondrocyte and mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) in a new rat model of degenerative <b>enthesis</b> repair. METHODOLOGY: The Achilles' tendon was cut and the <b>enthesis</b> destroyed. The damage was repaired by classical surgery without cell injection (group G 1, n = 52) and with chondrocyte (group G 2, n = 51) or MSC injection (group G 3, n = 39). The healing rate was determined macroscopically 15, 30 and 45 days later. The production and organization of a new <b>enthesis</b> was assessed by histological scoring of collagen II immunostaining, glycoaminoglycan production and the presence of columnar chondrocytes. The biomechanical load required to rupture the bone-tendon junction was determined. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: The spontaneous healing rate in the G 1 control group was 40 %, close to those observed in humans. Cell injection significantly improved healing (69 %, p = 0. 0028 for G 2 and p = 0. 006 for G 3) and the load-to-failure after 45 days (p< 0. 05) over controls. A new <b>enthesis</b> was clearly produced in cell-injected G 2 and G 3 rats, but not in the controls. Only the MSC-injected G 3 rats had an organized <b>enthesis</b> with columnar chondrocytes as in a native <b>enthesis</b> 45 days after surgery. CONCLUSIONS: Cell therapy is an efficient procedure for reconstructing degenerative entheses. MSC treatment produced better organ regeneration than chondrocyte treatment.

It has even been applied to the diagnosis of sacroiliitis as a low tech alternative to MRI [61]. Orientating ultrasound assessment of major <b>entheses</b> has been suggested in suspected or established cases of inflammatory spondylarthropathies, either to support or refute the diagnosis or to help establish the disease burden [62 – 64]. D’Agostino et al. [64] assessed about 200 patients with an inflammatory spondyloarthropathy or rheumatoid arthritis and more than 60 controls.

Gene expression and protein levels of signaling molecules including collagen type I (Col I), Col II, Col X, Ihh, and PTHrP in the cytoplasm of fibrochondrocytes were detected. Ihh signal blocking group was set up using Ihh signaling pathway-specific blocking agent cyclopamine. PTHrP enhancement group was set up using PTHrP reagent.

However, the potential link between entheseal thickening characteristic of enthesopathy and the stress-dissipating properties of the intervening plantar fat pad have not been investigated. Purpose: This study was conducted to identify whether plantar fat pad mechanics explain variance in the thickness of the fascial <b>enthesis</b> in individuals with and without plantar enthesopathy. Study Design: Case-control study; Level of evidence, 3. Methods: The study population consisted of 9 patients with unilateral plantar enthesopathy and 9 asymptomatic, individually matched controls. The thickness of the <b>enthesis</b> of the symptomatic, asymptomatic, and a matched control limb was acquired using high-resolution ultrasound. The compressive strain of the plantar fat pad during walking was estimated from dynamic lateral radiographs acquired with a multifunction fluoroscopy unit. Peak compressive stress was simultaneously acquired via a pressure platform. Principal viscoelastic parameters were estimated from subsequent stress-strain curves. Results: The symptomatic fascial <b>enthesis</b> (6. 7 ± 2. 0 mm) was significantly thicker than the asymptomatic <b>enthesis</b> (4. 2 ± 0. 4 mm), which in turn was thicker than the <b>enthesis</b> (3. 3 ± 0. 4 mm) of control limbs (P <. 05). There was no significant difference in the mean thickness, peak stress, peak strain, or secant modulus of the plantar fat pad between limbs. However, the energy dissipated by the fat pad during loading and unloading was significantly lower in the symptomatic limb (0. 55 ± 0. 17) when compared with asymptomatic (0. 69 ± 0. 13) and control (0. 70 ± 0. 09) limbs (P <. 05). The sonographic thickness of the <b>enthesis</b> was correlated with the energy dissipation ratio of the plantar fat pad (r =. 72, P <. 05), but only in the symptomatic limb. Conclusion: The energy-dissipating properties of the plantar fat pad are associated with the sonograpic appearance of the <b>enthesis</b> in symptomatic limbs, providing a previously unidentified link between the mechanical behavior of the plantar fat pad and enthesopathy...|$|E

US has an increasing {{important role in the}} evaluation of PsA. In fact, power Doppler US is useful mainly for its ability to assess musculoskeletal (joints, tendons, <b>entheses)</b> and cutaneous (skin and nails) involvement, to monitor efficacy of therapy and to guide steroid injections at the level of inflamed joints, tendon sheaths and <b>entheses.</b> MRI allows direct visualization of inflammation in peripheral and axial joints, and peripheral and axial <b>entheses,</b> and has dramatically improved the possibilities for early diagnosis and objective monitoring of the disease process in PsA. MRI has allowed explaining the relationships among enthesitis, synovitis and osteitis in PsA, supporting a SpA pattern of inflammation where enthesitis is the primary target of inflammation. CT has little role in assessment of peripheral joints, but it may be useful in assessing elements of spine disease. CT accuracy is similar to MRI in assessment of erosions in sacroiliac joint involvement, but CT is not as effective in detecting synovial inflammation. Bone scintigraphy lacks specificity and is now supplanted with US and MRI techniques...|$|R
