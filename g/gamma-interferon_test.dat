40|$|Understanding {{the factors}} leading each {{stakeholder}} {{to participate in}} an experimental trial is a key element for improving trial set-up and for identifying selection bias in statistical analyses. An experimental protocol, validated by the European Commission, was developed in France to assess the ability of the <b>gamma-interferon</b> <b>test</b> in terms of accuracy to replace the second intradermal skin test in cases of suspected bovine tuberculosis. Implemented between 2013 and 2015, this experimental trial was based on voluntary participation. To determine and understand the motivation or reluctance of farmers to take part in this trial, we carried out a sociological survey in France. Our study was based on semi-structured interviews with the farmers and other stakeholders involved. The analysis of findings demonstrated that shortening the lock-up period during tuberculosis suspicion, following the use of a <b>gamma-interferon</b> <b>test,</b> was an important aim and a genuine challenge for the animal health stakeholders. However, some farmers did not wish to continue the trial because it could potentially have drastic consequences for them. Moreover, misunderstandings and confusion concerning the objectives and consequences of the trial led stakeholders to reject it forcefully. Based on our results, we offer some recommendations: clear and appropriate communication tools should be prepared to explain the protocol and its aims. In addition, these types of animal health trials should be designed with the stakeholders' interests in mind. This study provides a better understanding of farmer motivations and stakeholder influences on trial participation and outcomes. The findings can be used to help design trials so that they promote participation by farmers and by all animal health stakeholders in general...|$|E
40|$|A {{survey to}} {{determine}} the bovine tuberculosis status of buffalo herds north of the Olifants River in the Kruger National Park was conducted, using a new diagnostic approach. Diagnosis of Mycobacterium bovis infection was accomplished using the gamma-interferon assay technique in 608 adult buffaloes {{out of a total}} of 29 discreet herds. The animals were immobilized in groups of 10 - 15, bled, individually marked and then revived and released on site. As soon as test results were available (after 26 - 36 h), the same buffalo herd was relocated by tracking the frequency of a radio-collar previously fitted to one adult cow per group during the initial operation. Bovine reactors were identified, darted and euthanased from the helicopter. Necropsy and culture findings of all culled buffaloes showed excellent correlation with the results of the ante-mortem <b>gamma-interferon</b> <b>test.</b> The survey revealed that over and above the two positive herds that had been identified during a previous survey carried out in 1996, there were three additional, but previously unidentified, infected herds in the region north of the Olifants River.

40|$|As {{a result}} of years’ {{research}} of the many research groups around the world {{able to understand the}} reason why it will be impossible to create really effective vaccine for the prevention of tuberculosis infection in the near future. The main reason for the impossibility creating such vaccine is an intracellular nature of tuberculosis. In fact, TB is a pathology of the immune system. Mycobacterium tuberculosis persist within macrophages and thereby inhibit the process of phagocytosis completion and digesting the contents of phagosome. The destruction of the lysosomal membrane inside macrophages is blocked by changing the pH in lysosomes. For the presence of lytic activity for most lysosomal enzymes require need acidic environment. Mycobacteria are also getting into the lysosomes of macrophages start to rapidly hydrolysis for urea by urease to form ammonia. Wherein pH in the medium changes to alkaline, this inactivates enzymes and stabilizes lysosomal membrane. Thus mycobacterium prevent lysosome collapse at inactivated lysosomal enzymes and do not allow them to complete macrophage digestion phase by transition lysosomal to phagosomal stage. Stop phagocytolysis process leads to imbalance of the host immune system. Increasing the number of infected macrophages sensitized to Mycobacterium tuberculosis antigens, leading to constant hyperfunction of cellular immunity, particularly enhanced immune response to cell wall components of mycobacteria, induction high titers of interferon-gamma in response to a stimulus, a sharp jump IL- 2 titers and TNF-α, IFN-γ specific activation CD 8 + CTL. Need also focus attention on the main differences from the MBT and human BCG, that is well growth in the human body, persists along host life, but does not cause active TB (except in patients with HIV/AIDS). After MBT cell destruction in the environment gets some additional high allergenic antigens, such as 85 B, ESAT 6, Rv 2660 c, HyVaC 4 (Ag 85 B and TB 10. 4.). These antigens to provide high adhesion and allergenicity of human strains M. tuberculosis. Most allergens that cause obvious signs of active tuberculosis are the antigens ESAT 6 and CFP 10. Such protein antigens can be called endotoxins. Also to pathogenicity factors include cord-factor, it main component is a polysaccharide-mycolic complex from cell wall (Figure 2) containing ftiolic and mycolic acid - to ensure the stability of mycobacteria to lysosomal enzymes. Currently available diagnostic tools tuberculin preferably contain the above components of the cell wall and differences (from BCG) allergens ESAT 6 and CFP 10 []. Currently well established that the virulence of M. tuberculosis, mainly responsible genes encoding antigens ESAT- 6 and CFP 10. When comparing the genomic sequence of M. tuberculosis with attenuated M. bovis BCG was detected genomic deletion of the three sites in the vaccine strain (RD 1, RD 2, RD 3). BCG vaccine strain genome stripped areas in the RD 1, encoding mycobacterial antigens ESAT- 6 and CFP- 10 present in virulent strains of M. tuberculosis. Many researchers believe that mutations in genomic regions RD 1, encoding mycobacterial antigens ESAT- 6 and CFP- 10, occurred in the process of creating a BCG strain. It remains not examine the question of whether all strains of M. bovis other than BCG have antigens ESAT- 6 and CFP- 10, and whether they depend on the degree of virulence of the mycobacteria strains. About a third of the population is infected with the MBT. Tuberculosis statistics show that out of every 100 man infected MTB, only 10 appear open clinical forms. In the remaining patients, positive skin test and/or <b>gamma-interferon</b> <b>test,</b> clinical symptoms of tuberculosis never does occur, and no signs of sensitization other than to MBT antigens and presence ESAT 6 - antibodies in the blood. Thus, if the focus is not on the infection, but on the prevention of tuberculosis reactivation, can significantly reduce the number of cases with clinical manifestations. There have been recent publication comparing the immunity of patients with open clinical forms tuberculosis and without clinical symptoms, but ESAT 6 - test-positive. One of the rational ways for helps to MTB - infected macrophages is the simultaneous use of urease inhibitors and simultaneously use selective activators of antibacterial complete phagocytosis. For the latter group, some authors include also histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDAi). The use of such inhibitors in the latter case will mass increase number reading frames in the macrophages genome and leads to stormy expression phagocytosis activators, that blocked by MBT. These inhibitors include valproic acid and trichostatin. Research in this area only started, and the expectations are very high. Another activator phagocytosis with very similar action mechanisms is the vitamin D 3 - ergocalciferol. In a variety experiments shows that the soluble derivatives of vitamin D 3 inoculation to the culture of MBT - infected macrophages leads to the completion phagocytosis and complete digestion of the MBT. The disadvantage of this method is the need to maintain a concentration of vitamin D 3, which is quite toxic to the human body as a whole. Accordingly, a new form vitamin D 3 is to be administered directly to the places where many infected macrophages, i. e. as an aerosol through the lungs. Also pay attention to the fact that, earlier for purpose combating tuberculosis the urease inhibitors have not been used, although quite a lot of wellknown non-toxic compounds anti -urease activity. Thus, the most promising way to prevent tuberculosis reactivation in humans with positive test specimens and humans in remission following chemotherapy is to provide an aerosol preparation containing both urease inhibitor, activator phagocytosis vitamin D 3 and histone deacetylase inhibitor. The use of such aerosol once a week will greatly reduce the number of macrophages with incomplete phagocytosis and prevent the background to tuberculosis with clinical open forms. This disease, like tuberculosis, prevention is better than cure, especially with the emergence of M. tuberculosis multiresistant strains...|$|E
40|$|We {{constructed}} a stochastic bio-economic model {{to determine the}} optimal cost-efficient surveillance program for bovine tuberculosis. The surveillance programs differed in combinations {{of one or more}} detection methods and/or sampling frequency. Stochastic input variables in the epidemiological module described the dynamics of infection and the probability of detection. By means of an efficiency frontier, the trade-off between the expected cost and the epidemiological risk parameter relating to the outbreak size was evaluated. The surveillance scheme based on visual inspection of lesions on carcasses at slaughter was optimal given the current prevalence of the disease in the Netherlands if the objective was to minimise the expected costs. However, the efficient set also included two other schemes: slaughterhouse inspection in combination with <b>GAMMA-interferon</b> <b>testing</b> of blood samples and slaughterhouse inspection in combination with two-stage tuberculin testing. The choice ultimately will depend on the risk attitude of the decision-maker; a more-stringent surveillance scheme will be enforced if the expected outbreak size is to be constrained. In future scenarios, ELISA testing of bulk-tank milk in combination with the current slaughterhouse inspection procedure would outperform the surveillance scheme of solely slaughterhouse inspection if ELISA testing of bulk-tank milk becomes feasible...|$|R
40|$|Objective/Background: Bovine {{tuberculosis}} (BTb) {{is mainly}} {{a disease of}} cattle, although it continues to infect human populations across the world. Operation of a test and slaughter plan in Iran since 1981 has lowered the frequency of BTb from > 5 % to < 0. 14 % at the national scale. In 2015, unusual uncontrollable epidemics of BTb were detected in two cattle farms in municipal suburbs of Qazvin and Isfahan. These farms had a tuberculin-test-certified record of BTb-free status for the past 5 consecutive years, with no new cattle registered with {{either of the two}} herds during this time period. Routine tuberculination of the bovids in 2015 resulted in the detection of tuberculin-positive animals that were subsequently removed from the herds. Serial tuberculin tests improved the situation, as new reactors were found each time. The aim of this research is based on isolation and identification of Mycobacterium from infected animals in both farms. Methods: To investigate the situation, major mesenteric/mediastinal lymph nodes from the culled reactor animals along with specimens from bulk milk tanks, trapped rats living on the farms, and environmental specimens were collected and subjected to bacterial culture. Tuberculin-positive cattle were also subjected to paratuberculosis enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), ESAT- 6 ELISA, and <b>gamma-interferon</b> <b>tests.</b> Results: In bacterial culture, Mycobacterium bovis, Mycobacterium microti, and Mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis were isolated from collected specimens at both farms. Conclusion: There is circumstantial evidence supported by previous studies to expect a high frequency of M. avium subsp. paratuberculosis infection in Iranian cattle/sheep farms. This observation might explain the large skin reaction size seen at the avian tuberculin injection site in tested animals in these farms. Introduction of a third infection with M. microti, possibly by rodents visiting the farms, might have triggered immunological reactions that have ended the surge of BTb. If correct, we assume that a technical review of the Iranian test and slaughter scheme against BTb is required to address persisting cases of BTb in disease-free farms, as described here...|$|R
40|$|In {{light of}} the direct {{correlation}} between Mycobacterium bovis (M. bovis) infection in cattle and the disease in humans, control measures need {{to be applied to}} reduce the prevalence of tuberculosis in developing countries. To this effect, generation of epidemiological is of paramount importance. This study was undertaken on 243 heads of cattle using the comparative intradermal tuberculin <b>test</b> (CIT), <b>gamma-interferon</b> (IFN-) <b>test</b> and bacteriology. Twenty-two percent (n= 243) of the herd tested positive for M. bovis by CIT test. In addition, bacteriological culturing of the milk and nasal discharges reconfirmed 38 % (16 / 42) of the positively diagnosed subjects by the CIT test.

40|$|A {{study to}} {{determine}} and compare the sensitivities and specificities of the comparative cervical tuberculin (CCT) and <b>gamma-interferon</b> (IFN-gamma) <b>tests</b> for the diagnosis of bovine tuberculosis was conducted on 30 Zebu oxen. The results of the tests were compared {{with the presence of}} acid-fast bacilli found by bacteriological culturing and histopathological examinations. The sensitivity and specificity of CCT test were found to be 90. 9 percent and 100 percent, respectively. Those of the commercial IFN-gamma test were determined to be 95. 5 percent and 87. 7 percent, respectively. No {{significant differences were found between}} the sensitivities (Yates' corrected X 2 = 0. 32; p= 0. 57) or the specificities (Yates' corrected X 2 = 2. 54; p= 0. 11) of the two tests. Furthermore, a positive correlation (r= 0. 76) was recorded between the increase in skin thickness following injection of bovine purified protein derivative (PPD) and the optical density in the gamma-interferon assay with bovine PPD. On the other hand, the correlation (r= 0. 47) between the change in skin thickness following injection of avian PPD and the optical density in the gamma-interferon assay with avian PPD was relatively weak. On the basis of this preliminary investigation, it was concluded that the choice between the two tests depends on their cost and simplicity and on livestock management and time factors rather than on their respective diagnostic value...|$|R

40|$|A Mycobacterium avium {{subspecies}} paratuberculosis (MAP) {{vaccine that}} reduced {{the incidence of}} clinical disease or reduced fecal shedding of MAP would aid control of Johne's disease (JD). The objective {{of the present study}} was to evaluate the efficacy of four MAP vaccine combinations, including cell-wall competent (CWC) alum adjuvant, CWC-QS 21 adjuvant, cell-wall deficient (CWD) alum adjuvant and CWD-QS 21 adjuvant vaccines. Eighty baby goats were vaccinated at 1 and 4 weeks of age with one of these vaccines or a sham control vaccine consisting of alum adjuvant. Kids were challenged orally with approximately 6. 0 x 10 (9) organisms in four divided doses of 1. 5 x 10 (9) organisms using a goat isolate of MAP. Vaccinated challenged and challenged control groups had 10 and 6 kids per group, respectively. Half of the kids within each group were necropsied at either 6 or 9 months post-challenge. Gross and microscopic lesions and relative number of acid-fast bacilli were evaluated and scored at necropsy. Results indicated all challenged kids had some lesions compatible with JD suggesting none of the vaccines prevented infection. Three vaccines (CWC-alum, CWC-QS 21 and CWD-QS 21) reduced lesion scores by 46 - 51 % at 9 months. CWD-alum vaccine resulted in a more severe (+ 33. 5 %) lesion score than sham-vaccinated challenged control. Lesion scores were greater at 9 months than at 6 months post-challenge in the sham-vaccinated challenged group and CWD-alum vaccinated group, while lesion scores were generally stable with remaining vaccines. Mean fecal CFU/g were significantly different across time from challenge to 9 -month necropsy (p= 0. 043) and the CWC-QS 21 vaccine group had a marked reduction in fecal CFU/g at all time points post-challenge. A reduction in MAP CFU/g was also detected in necropsy tissues from kids given the CWC-alum, CWC-QS 21 and CWD-QS 21 vaccines, and increased CFU/g were detected in tissues from kids given the CWD-alum vaccine. Immunological tests evaluated included, humoral response evaluation by AGID, ELISA and Western blot, and cell mediated response by comparative PPD skin testing (M. avium, Old Johnin, M. bovis and Lot 2 Johnin PPD's), and production of MAP induced gamma-interferon. Vaccination also resulted in false-positive PPD skin test reactions for M. avium PPD, Old Johnin PPD and <b>gamma-interferon</b> <b>tests.</b> When a 2 -mm cutoff above normal skin thickness was used to define positive skin test reactions, false-positive reactions for M. bovis were detected in only 2 of 32 kids given a vaccine with QS 21 adjuvant.

40|$|Tuberculosis (TB) in goats (. Capra hircus) {{is due to}} {{infection}} {{with members of the}} Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex (MTC), mainly Mycobacterium bovis and Mycobacterium caprae. We report a comparative experimental infection of goats with M. bovis, M. caprae and M. tuberculosis strains. We hypothesized that goats experimentally infected with different members of the MTC would display different clinical pictures. Three groups of goats were challenged with either M. bovis SB 0134 (group 1, n=. 5), M. caprae SB 0157 (group 2, n=. 5) and M. tuberculosis SIT 58 (group 3, n= 4). The highest mean total lesion score was observed in M. bovis challenged goats (mean 15. 2, range 9 - 19), followed by those challenged with M. caprae (10. 8, 2 - 23). The lowest score was recorded in goats challenged with M. tuberculosis (3, 1 - 6). Culture results coincided with the lesion scores in yielding more positive pools (7 / 15) in M. bovis challenged goats. By contrast, only three pools were positive from goats challenged M. tuberculosis (3 / 12) and with M. caprae (3 / 15), respectively. Differences in the performance of the intradermal and <b>gamma-interferon</b> (IFN-γ) <b>tests</b> depending of the group were observed since all goats from group 1 were diagnosed using intradermal test and these goats reacted earlier to the IFN-γ assay in comparison to the other groups. This study confirmed that goats experimentally infected with different members of the MTC display different clinical pictures and this fact may have implications for MTC maintenance and bacterial shedding.
