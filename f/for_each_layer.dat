25|$|The oxide {{particles}} then agglomerate to form {{large particle}} chains, which subsequently deposit {{on the walls}} of the tube as soot. The deposition is due to the large difference in temperature between the gas core and the wall causing the gas to push the particles outwards (this is known as thermophoresis). The torch is then traversed up and down the length of the tube to deposit the material evenly. After the torch has reached the end of the tube, it is then brought back to the beginning of the tube and the deposited particles are then melted to form a solid layer. This process is repeated until a sufficient amount of material has been deposited. <b>For</b> <b>each</b> <b>layer</b> the composition can be modified by varying the gas composition, resulting in precise control of the finished fiber's optical properties.|$|E

30|$|As {{discussed}} in Ref. (Bazzi et al. 2016), community detection in multiplex networks involves several subtle challenges. However, the optimization of multiplex modularity, i.e., Eq. (5), {{can often be}} done using a modification of existing techniques for detecting communities in simple monoplex networks. Here we use a modification of the extremal optimization approach (Duch and Arenas 2005) summarized as follows. We begin by finding the community structures <b>for</b> <b>each</b> individual <b>layer</b> using extremal optimization. Next, we re-index the communities such that the Hamming distance between the communities <b>for</b> <b>each</b> pair of adjacent layers in minimized. (The Hamming distance between the communities of layers t and t+ 1 is simply the number of nodes for which s_i^(t) s_i^(t+ 1).) At this point the community structures <b>for</b> <b>each</b> isolated <b>layer</b> have been found and are best-matched, maximizing the first term on the right hand-side of Eq. (5). Finally, we sweep through each node in <b>each</b> <b>layer</b> in a random order, adjusting its membership to the community that locally optimizes Eq. (5). Here we perform a total of 100 such sweeps.|$|R
