5|$|In {{terms of}} renewal, Eliot {{believed}} that suffering {{was needed for}} all of society before new life could begin. The original Little Gidding community was built for living on monastic lines, but the community was damaged and dispersed by Puritan forces during the English Civil War in 1646. The church, {{the centre of the}} community, was restored in 1714 and again in 1853. The image of religious renewal is combined with the image of the London air-raids and the constant fighting and destruction within the world. This compound image is used to discuss the connection of holy places with the Holy Spirit, Pentecost, communion with the dead, and the repetition of history. The theme is also internal to Eliot's own poems; the image of the rose garden at the end Little Gidding <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>image</b> that begins Burnt Norton and the journey is made circular. Also, the depiction of time within the poem is similar to the way time operates within The Family Reunion.|$|E

25|$|Billon coins - There {{are around}} one hundred {{preserved}} coins of that type. On one side <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>image</b> of the Emperor and Saint Demetrius upright {{and holding a}} scepter with a star. On {{the other side is}} depicted Christ Pantocrator. These coins were probably minted in the Thessalonica mint. Their weight is between 3.00 and 3.08grams.|$|E

25|$|They are debased, cursed, anathematized forever by God and so {{can never}} repent and be forgiven; they are cheats and traitors; defiant and stubborn; they killed the prophets; they are liars who falsify scripture and take bribes; as infidels they are ritually unclean, a foul odor emanating from them – such <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>image</b> of the Jew in {{classical}} Islam, degraded and malevolent.|$|E
25|$|Below is a {{table of}} some of the most common SSTV modes and their differences. These modes share many properties, such as {{synchronization}} and/or frequencies and grey/color level correspondence. Their main difference <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>image</b> quality, which is proportional to the time taken to transfer the image and in the case of the AVT modes, related to synchronous data transmission methods and noise resistance conferred by the use of interlace.|$|E
25|$|The {{foundation}} for pottery painting <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>image</b> carrier, {{in other words}} the vase onto which an image is painted. Popular shapes alternated with passing fashions. Whereas many recurred after intervals, others were replaced over time. But they all had a common method of manufacture: after the vase was made, it was first dried before being painted. The workshops were {{under the control of}} the potters, who as owners of businesses had an elevated social position.|$|E

25|$|A {{plane mirror}} forms a virtual image {{positioned}} behind the mirror. Although {{the rays of}} light seem to come from behind the mirror, light from the source only exists {{in front of the}} mirror. The image in a plane mirror is not magnified (that <b>is,</b> <b>the</b> <b>image</b> is {{the same size as the}} object) and appears to be as far behind the mirror as the object is in front of the mirror.|$|E
25|$|Pigeon {{racing in}} Romania {{is one of}} Europe's hot spots in the sport. Many pigeon breeders join the National Federations every year, {{triggering}} more and more competitive challenges. Another aspect <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>image</b> that {{has changed in the}} last decade in regards of pigeon racing, since nowadays it stands for a fine art within the country, with symbolic prizes and bets. A high collaboration with pigeon fanciers from Belgium, the Netherlands and Germany is also observed.|$|E
25|$|In mathematics, {{representation}} {{is a very}} general relationship that expresses similarities between objects. Roughly speaking, a collection Y of mathematical objects {{may be said to}} represent another collection X of objects, provided that the properties and relationships existing among the representing objects yi conform in some consistent way to those existing among the corresponding represented objects xi. Somewhat more formally, for a set Π of properties and relations, a Π-representation of some structure X is a structure Y that <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>image</b> of X under a homomorphism that preserves Π. The label {{representation is}} sometimes also applied to the homomorphism itself.|$|E

25|$|The {{presence}} of radiologically opaque breast implants (either saline or silicone) might {{interfere with the}} radiographic sensitivity of the mammograph, that <b>is,</b> <b>the</b> <b>image</b> might not show any tumor(s) present. In which case, anEklund view mammogram is required to ascertain either the presence or {{the absence of a}} cancerous tumor, wherein the breast implant is manually displaced against the chest wall and the breast is pulled forward, so that the mammograph can visualize a greater volume of the internal tissues; Nonetheless, approximately one-third of the breast tissue remains inadequately visualized, resulting in an increased incidence of mammograms with false-negative results.|$|E
25|$|Atiyah and Singer's first {{published}} proof used K-theory rather than cobordism. If i is any inclusion of compact manifolds from X to Y, they defined a 'pushforward' operation i! on elliptic operators of X to elliptic operators of Y that preserves the index. By taking Y {{to be some}} sphere that X embeds in, this reduces the index theorem {{to the case of}} spheres. If Y is a sphere and X is some point embedded in Y, then any elliptic operator on Y <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>image</b> under i! of some elliptic operator on the point. This reduces the index theorem to the case of a point, where it is trivial.|$|E
25|$|For Hegel, {{the inner}} {{movement}} of reality {{is the process}} of God thinking, as manifested {{in the evolution of the}} universe of nature and thought; that is, Hegel argued that, when fully and properly understood, reality is being thought by God as manifested in a person's comprehension of this process in and through philosophy. Since human thought <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>image</b> and fulfillment of God's thought, God is not ineffable (so incomprehensible as to be unutterable) but can be understood by an analysis of thought and reality. Just as humans continually correct their concepts of reality through a dialectical process, so God himself becomes more fully manifested through the dialectical process of becoming.|$|E
