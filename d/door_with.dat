5|$|After Mary's death, Paul and Michael {{were sent}} to live with Jim's brother Joe, and his wife Joan, for two months, so as to let their father grieve in private. Jim {{depended}} heavily on his sisters, Jin and Millie, to help around the house. Jim later {{took part in the}} running of the household, as Cynthia Lennon remembered that when she and John Lennon used to visit Forthlin Road, Jim would often answer the <b>door</b> <b>with</b> his sleeves rolled up, a tea towel in his hand and an apron tied around his waist. When Paul later played at The Cavern during lunchtimes, Jim would drop off food there that Paul would later put in the oven at Forthlin Road. Ruth remembered that Jim was funny and musical with her, but also strict when she was young, and was insistent that she learned good table manners and etiquette when speaking to people.|$|E
5|$|Before {{pre-production}} began, songwriters Mike Stoller and Jerry Leiber {{were commissioned}} {{to integrate the}} film's soundtrack. In April, Leiber and Stoller were called for a meeting in New York City to show {{the progress of the}} repertoire. The writers, who had not produced any material, toured the city and were confronted in a hotel room by Jean Aberbach, who locked them into their hotel room by blocking the hotel room <b>door</b> <b>with</b> a sofa until they wrote the material. Presley recorded the soundtrack at Radio Recorders in Hollywood on April 30 and May 3, with an additional session at the MGM Soundstage on May 9. During post-production, the songs were dubbed into the films scenes, in which Presley mimed the lyrics.|$|E

5|$|More than 1,000 {{shots of}} Wolverine have visual effects in them, which {{required}} three effects supervisors and seventeen different companies {{to work on}} the film. The most prominent was Hydraulx, who had also worked in the X-Men trilogy and was responsible for the battle in Three Mile Island and Gambit's powers. Many elements were totally generated through computer-generated imagery, such as the adamantium injection machine, the scene with Gambit's plane and Wolverine tearing through a <b>door</b> <b>with</b> his newly enhanced claws. CG bone claws were also created for some scenes because the props did not look good in close-ups. Extensive usage of matte paintings was also made, with Matte World Digital creating five different mattes for the final scene of the film—a pullback depicting the destroyed Three Mile Island—and Gavin Hood handing company Hatch Productions pictures of favelas as reference for the Africa scenes.|$|E

5|$|The {{last of the}} Texians to die {{were the}} 11 men manning the two 12-pounder cannon in the chapel. A shot from the 18-pounder cannon {{destroyed}} the barricades {{at the front of}} the church, and Mexican soldiers entered the building after firing an initial musket volley. Dickinson's crew fired their cannon from the apse into the Mexican soldiers at the <b>door.</b> <b>With</b> no time to reload, the Texians, including Dickinson, Gregorio Esparza and James Bonham, grabbed rifles and fired before being bayoneted to death. Texian Robert Evans, the master of ordnance, had been tasked with keeping the gunpowder from falling into Mexican hands. Wounded, he crawled towards the powder magazine but was killed by a musket ball with his torch only inches from the powder. Had he succeeded, the blast would have destroyed the church and killed the women and children hiding in the sacristy.|$|E

Trapped in the labyrinth the man collapses out of exhaustion, and Arha has him chained up while debating {{what to do with}} him. After questioning him she learns that he has come to the Tombs looking for the long-lost half of the ring of Erreth-Akbe, a magical talisman, broken centuries before, necessary for peace in Earthsea. The other half had come into his possession by chance, and a dragon told him of its true nature. Arha is drawn to him as he tells her of the outside world, and keeps him prisoner in the tombs, bringing him food and water. However, Kossil learns of Ged's existence, forcing Arha to promise that Ged will be sacrificed to the Nameless Ones; however, she realizes that she cannot go through with the sacrifice. She instructs Manan to dig a false grave underground, while she herself takes Ged to hide in the treasury of the Tombs.|$|E
5|$|In 1985, Neighbours {{started out}} with three {{families}} created by Watson – the Ramsays, the Robinsons and the Clarkes. Watson said {{that he wanted to}} show three families living in a small street, who are friends. Max Ramsay (Francis Bell), his wife Maria (Dasha Blahova) and their sons Shane (Peter O'Brien) and Danny (David Clencie) lived at No.24 Ramsay Street. Single father, Jim Robinson (Alan Dale) lived next <b>door</b> <b>with</b> his children, Paul (Stefan Dennis), Julie (Vikki Blanche), Scott (Darius Perkins) and Lucy (Kylie Flinker). His mother-in-law, Helen Daniels (Anne Haddy) also lived with him. Bachelor Des Clarke (Paul Keane) invited Daphne Lawrence (Elaine Smith) to live at No. 28 with him and they were later married. The Robinsons and the Ramsays had a long history in the street and they were often involved in an ongoing rivalry. When Network Ten picked up the show and revamped it, they brought in new and younger actors including Kylie Minogue as Charlene Mitchell and Jason Donovan, who replaced Darius Perkins as Scott Robinson. Many families, including the Alessi, Bishop, Hancock, Hoyland, Rebecchi, Scully, Timmins and Willis families have moved {{in and out of the}} street over the years.|$|E
