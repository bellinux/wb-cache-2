40|$|The {{geochemical survey}} of stream {{sediment}} of Batu Melintang area was mainly focused at Tadoh River and its tributaries. The study area located at Batu Melintang, Kelantan, Malaysia 001 ° 44 ' 0 " E, 5 ° 45 ' 0 'N). It covered twenty five km² of area which include flat plain, mountain and alluvial plain. The objective of {{study is to}} study the geology of study area, geochemical characteristic of stream sediments and to determine the concentration and distribution of element and heavy metal concentration of stream sediment. The general geology of study area was determined by constructing lithology and structural map and the area shows mainly three type of lithology that are marble and limestone, granodiorite and sandstone. Twenty six samples of stream sediment were collected {{for the analysis of}} five type elements which are iron, zinc, manganese, lead and copper and analyzed using Atomic Absorption Spectroscopy. Generally the highest element concentration is iron with highest value of 1153 ppm, and the second highest element concentration is manganese which is 38. 39 ppm. The overall element concentration for zinc, copper and lead are low and ranging from lowest 0. 2 ppm- 2 ppm. The high concentration of iron element indicates that the area is mainly sediment hosted <b>iron</b> <b>bearing</b> <b>rock,</b> and the area might be contaminated due to human activities nearby the river. The high concentration of manganese also shows that bicarbonate ion is dissolved at marble and carbonate rocks...|$|E

40|$|Gavkhuni playa lake, located 130 km {{southeast}} of Isfahan, comprises of sand, mud and salt flats. This playa includes two environments as delta and playa lake. Sand dunes, 45 kilometers long, extend {{in the west}} of the playa. Rock fragments of andesite, dacite, tuff, granite, schist, gneiss, fossil bearing limestone, sandstone and also quartz and feldspar minerals form the alluvial and aeolian sediments. Heavy minerals including idocrase, tourmaline, biotite, wollastonite, magnetite, hematite, goethite and pyrite were also identified. Fesharak skarns located in northeast of the region are the sources of spinel, idocrase and wollastonite minerals. Silicate heavy minerals like hornblende, pyroxene, epidote, zircon, garnet, tourmaline, biotite and also magnetite are mainly originated from Urumieh-Dokhtar volcanic belt located in northeast of the area and different <b>iron</b> <b>bearing</b> <b>rocks</b> are the sources of pyrite, hematite and limonite.

50|$|The {{geological}} strata in Lincolnshire {{includes a}} number of <b>iron</b> <b>bearing</b> <b>rocks</b> including (downwards) the Claxby ironstone (Claxby, Lower Cretaceous period); the Lincoln ironstone; the Caythorpe ironstone (Caythorpe, Middle Lias period), below which is the 'Frodingham Ironstone' once mined at Scunthorpe. At Frodingham the ironstone existed in a bed up to 35 ft thick, covered by loose sand. The ore {{was found in the}} form of a calcareous hydrated oxide, with some oolitic nodules, much affected by water weathering; local variations within the ore bed included bands with iron content as high as 40%, down to 12%, with an average iron content of 25%, excluding spoil. The ironstone bed dipped slightly towards the east - the bed's proximity to the surface, its fair uniformity, and the general low value of the land on which it stood led to rapid development of open ore workings. The lime content of the ore rendered it self fluxing, but is high lime content and basic nature were problematic and led to the practice of using it in combination with silica containing ores (for slag formation). Iron produced from the bed including the fossiliferous lime contained over 1% phosphorus, similar to that from the Cleveland ironstone, as well as a few percent of manganese.|$|R
40|$|A {{magnetic}} study over a 95 m x 150 m {{area of the}} Hickory sandstone aquifer {{in central}} Texas was carried out as part of multitechnique geophysical investigation that included ground penetrating radar (GPR), electromagnetic (EM), seismic and seimoelectric. In geophysical exploration, the magnetic method can be utilized {{as an alternative to}} more expensive methods, such as seismic or {{it can be used to}} complement other methods. In this thesis, the magnetic method is applied to estimate the location of a previously mapped fault by Texas A&M geology students, and it is used to estimate the magnetic susceptibility contrast of the targeted fault. The main challenge of this study is imaging shallow faults using the geophysical magnetic method in a fractured aquifer with widely-scattered distribution of <b>iron</b> <b>bearing</b> <b>rocks</b> as in the case of the Hickory sandstone aquifer. A Geometric?G 858 Cesium vapor magnetometer was used to collect magnetic data. The data consisted of 19 north-south and 1 east-west lines acquired in October and November of 2012. Elementary data processing such as diurnal correction, regional correction, reduction to pole (RTP) filter, Euler deconvolution, forward modeling and inversion were employed to characterize the faulted zone. This faulted zone separates granite basement rocks from the Hickory sandstone. As a result, this study emphasizes that Euler deconvolution applied to RTP-filtered data increases the interpretability of geological and structural contacts. The results of the magnetic method have been compared to results of GPR, EM and seismoelectric methods. Understanding the magnetic mineralogy of rocks and their properties can improve the geological interpretation of magnetic surveys...|$|R

40|$|In {{addition}} to the chemistry, the degree of reduction of the <b>iron</b> <b>bearing</b> materials in the burden affects the characteristic temperature of the resulting primary slag in the cohesive zone of the Blast Furnace. Thus the location and extent of the cohesive zone which acts as a gas-distributor in the blast furnace are both influenced by the degree of reduction the <b>iron</b> <b>bearing</b> material undergo prior to their entry into the cohesive zone travelling through the granular zone. The present work is involved with sintering the iron-bearing materials, namely fluxed pellets and raw ore, to different degree of reduction and determination of the characteristic of these pre-reduced materials. The softening temperature of the fluxed pellet increases {{with the increase of}} the degree of reduction up to 65 % and then shows a reverse trend. In case of raw-ore the corresponding value is recorded to be 70 %. Thus the cohesive zone supposed to be lowered with the increase in reduction of the fluxed-pellets, up to 65 % reduction and similar trend is observed up to 70 % for raw-ores. Due to certain experimental ambiguity the flow characteristic the flow-temperature, the softening-flow interval and thus the extent of the cohesive zone, {{as a function of the}} reduction of the <b>iron</b> <b>bearing</b> materials, is so difficult to be as curtained very accurately and only a likely trend has been reported...|$|R
