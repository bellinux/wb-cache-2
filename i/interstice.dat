In distant {{effects of}} rich subject, wood, or rippled water, or broken clouds, much may {{be done by}} touches or {{crumbling}} dashes of rather dry color, with other colors afterwards put cunningly into the interstices. The more you practice this, when the subject evidently calls for it, the more your eye will enjoy the higher qualities of color. The process is, in fact, the carrying out {{of the principle of}} separate colors to the utmost possible refinement; using atoms of color in juxtaposition, instead of large spaces. And note, in filling up minute interstices of this kind, that if you want the color you fill them with to show brightly, it is better to put a rather positive point of it, with a little white left beside or round it in the <b>interstice,</b> than to put a pale tint of the color over the whole <b>interstice.</b> Yellow or orange will hardly show, if pale, in small spaces; but they show brightly in firm touches, however small, with white beside them.|$|E

The true merit, then, of wood execution, {{as regards}} this matter of cross-hatching, is first {{that there be}} no more {{crossing}} than necessary; secondly, that all the interstices be various, and rough.

In {{the second}} {{chapter of the}} first volume, it was noticed that the {{architect}} of Bourges Cathedral liked hawthorn, and that the porch of his cathedral was therefore decorated with a rich wreath of it; but another of the predilections of that architect was there unnoticed, namely, {{that he did not}} at all like grey hawthorn, but preferred it green, and he painted it green accordingly, as bright as he could. The color is still left in every sheltered <b>interstice</b> of the foliage. He had, in fact, hardly the choice of any other color; he might have gilded the thorns, by way of allegorizing human life, but if they were to be painted at all, they could hardly be painted any tiling but green, and green all over. People would have been apt to object to any pursuit of abstract harmonies of color, which might have induced him to paint his hawthorn blue.|$|E

It was his situation, by no fault of his own, that was fantastic, and he was only trying to be natural. He watched me put away the letter, and when it had disappeared gave a soft sigh of relief. The sigh was natural, and yet it set me thinking. His general recoil from an immediate responsibility imposed by others might be wholesome enough; but if there was an old grievance on one side, was there not possibly a new-born delusion on the other? It would be unkind to withhold a reflection that might serve as a warning; so I told him, abruptly, that I had been an undiscovered spectator, the night before, of his exploits at roulette.|$|E
6000|$|... § XXIV. These capitals, called barbarous by our architects, {{are without}} {{exception}} the most subtle pieces of composition in broad contour which I {{have ever met}} with in architecture. Their profile is given in the opposite Plate X. fig. 3, b; the inner line in the figure being that of the stone behind the lily, the outer that of the external network, taken through {{the side of the}} capital; while fig. 3, c is the outer profile at its angle; and the reader will easily understand that the passing of the one of these lines into the other is productive of the most exquisite and wonderful series of curvatures possible within such compass, no two views of the capital giving the same contour. Upon these profoundly studied outlines, as remarkable for their grace and complexity as the general mass of the capital is for solid strength and proportion to its necessary service, the braided work is wrought with more than usual care; perhaps, as suggested by the Marchese Selvatico, with some idea of imitating those [...] "nets of chequerwork and wreaths of chainwork" [...] on the chapiters of Solomon's temple, which are, I suppose, the first instances on record of an ornamentation of this kind thus applied. The braided work encloses on each of the four sides of the capital a flower whose form, derived from that of the lily, though as usual modified, in every instance of its occurrence, in some minor particulars, is generally seen as represented in fig. 11 of Plate VIII. It is never without the two square or oblong objects at the extremity of the tendrils issuing from its root, set like vessels to catch the dew from the points of its leaves; but I do not understand their meaning. The abacus of the capital has already been given at a, Plate XVI., Vol. I.; but no amount of illustrations or eulogium would be enough to make the reader understand the perfect beauty of the thing itself, as the sun steals from <b>interstice</b> to <b>interstice</b> of its marble veil, and touches with the white lustre of its rays at mid-day the pointed leaves of its thirsty lilies.|$|E
60|$|Secondly, Sharpness of Edge: The {{edges of}} {{the bars of the}} upper clouds which are turned to the wind, are often the sharpest which the sky shows; no outline {{whatever}} of any other kind of cloud, however marked and energetic, ever approaches the delicate decision of these edges. The outline of a black thunder-cloud is striking, from the great energy of the color or shade of the general mass; but as a line, it is soft and indistinct, compared with the edge of the cirrus, in a clear sky with a brisk breeze. On the other hand, the edge of the bar turned away from the wind is always soft, often imperceptible, melting into the blue <b>interstice</b> between it and its next neighbor. Commonly the sharper one edge is, the softer is the other, and the clouds look flat, and as if they slipped over each other like the scales of a fish. When both edges are soft, as is always the case when the sky is clear and windless, the cloud looks solid, round, and fleecy.|$|E
40|$|The {{effects of}} {{adsorbate}} on the adsorption in {{a bundle of}} carbon nanotubes are investigated to explore the preferential adsorption over various adsorption sites: inside the tube, in the cusp <b>interstices</b> and in the square <b>interstices</b> outside the tubes. This is carried Out with the Grand Canonical Monte Carlo simulation and the Simulation results are tested against the experimental results of bundles of single wall carbon nanotubes (SWCN). With regard to adsorbate, we choose argon and nitrogen to represent simple fluids and water to represent strong associating fluids with strong orientation interaction. The preferential adsorption of argon and nitrogen depends on the tube size. For tube size smaller than 10. 8 angstrom, adsorption inside the tube is preferred because the solid-fluid potential is greatest in the tube interiors. While for larger tubes adsorption occurs initially in the small Cusp <b>interstices</b> between the tubes, and as adsorption is progressed adsorption occurs inside the tube {{as well as the}} larger square <b>interstices.</b> At higher pressures capillary condensation occurs in the square <b>interstices.</b> For water, however, the adsorption mechanism is different. Its adsorption occurs dominantly inside the tube, irrespective of the tube size. This is due to the requirement of appropriate geometry to allow hydrogen bonding among water Molecules to occur. The small cusp <b>interstices</b> do not provide proper space for clusters of hydrogen bonded waters, while the larger square <b>interstices</b> are too large and hence the solid-fluid potential is not strong enough to induce adsorption unless the partial pressure is sufficiently high. Finally the model of these fluids and carbon nanotube is tested with the experimental data of a commercial SWCN, and the Simulation results are in agreement with the data. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc.

60|$|There are, however, two curious {{circumstances}} {{in the later}} traceries; the first, that they are universally considered by the builder (as the old Byzantines considered sculptured surfaces of stone) as material out of which a certain portion is to be cut, to fill his window.

In the Porta della Carta, in the Church of the Madonna dell'Orto, in the Casa Bernardo on the Grand Canal, in the old Church of the Misericordia, and wherever else there are rich traceries in Venice, it will always be found that a certain arrangement of quatrefoils and other figures has been planned as if it were to extend indefinitely into miles of arcade; and out of this colossal piece of marble lace, a piece {{in the shape of a}} window is cut, mercilessly and fearlessly: whatever fragments and odd shapes of <b>interstice,</b> remnants of this or that figure of the divided foliation, may occur at the edge of the window, it matters not; all are cut across, and shut in by the great outer archivolt.|$|E
