5|$|The earth may be personified as {{the goddess}} Bhudevi in Indian sculpture. Bhudevi is often shown {{as a small}} figure in the icon. She may be seated on or {{dangling}} from one of Varaha's tusks, or is seated {{on the corner of}} his folded elbow or his shoulder and supports herself against the tusk or the snout, as being lifted from the waters. In later Indian paintings, the whole earth or a part of it is depicted lifted up by Varaha's tusks. In Mahabalipuram, a rare portrayal shows an affectionate Varaha looking down to Bhudevi, who he carries in his arms. The earth may be portrayed as a globe, a flat stretch of mountainous land or an elaborate forest landscape with buildings, temples, humans, birds and animals. The defeated demon may be depicted trampled under Varaha's feet or being killed in combat by Varaha's gada. Nagas (snake gods) and their consorts Naginis (snake goddesses), residents of the underworld, may be depicted as swimming in the ocean with <b>hands</b> <b>folded</b> as a mark of devotion. Varaha may be also depicted standing on a snake or other minor creatures, denoting the cosmic waters.|$|E
25|$|Early Dynastic stone sculptures have mainly been {{recovered}} from excavated temples. They can be separated in two groups: three-dimensional prayer statues, and perforated bas-reliefs. The so-called Tell Asmar Hoard {{is a well-known}} example of Early Dynastic sculpture. It was recovered in a temple and consists of standing figures with their <b>hands</b> <b>folded</b> in prayer or holding a goblet for a libation ritual. Other statues feature seated figures, also in devotional postures. Male figures wear a plain or fringed dress, or kaunakes. The statues usually represent notables or rulers. They served as ex-votos and were placed in temples to pray {{on behalf of the}} spender. The Sumerian style clearly influenced neighbouring regions. Similar statues have {{been recovered}} from sites in Upper Mesopotamia, including Assur, Tell Chuera, and Mari. However, there were also statues that showed greater originality and had less stylistic characteristics in common with Sumerian sculpture.|$|E
25|$|A {{variety of}} body postures may be assumed, often with {{specific}} meaning (mainly respect or adoration) associated with them: standing; sitting; kneeling; prostrate on the floor; eyes opened; eyes closed; <b>hands</b> <b>folded</b> or clasped; hands upraised; holding hands with others; a laying on of hands and others. Prayers may be recited from memory, read {{from a book}} of prayers, or composed spontaneously as they are prayed. They may be said, chanted, or sung. They may be with musical accompaniment or not. There may {{be a time of}} outward silence while prayers are offered mentally. Often, there are prayers to fit specific occasions, such as the blessing of a meal, the birth or death of a loved one, other significant events {{in the life of a}} believer, or days of the year that have special religious significance. Details corresponding to specific traditions are outlined below.|$|E

500|$|The {{iconography}} of Sharabeshwaramurti (Shiva as Sharabha) is specifically defined in texts such as Khamikagama and Sritattvanidhi.

The top part of the body is shown as human but with the face of a lion with an ornamented crown; side tusks are also depicted giving an overall frightening sight.
