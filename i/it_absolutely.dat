Turner himself stated: “I do {{agree that it}} is a natural progression from Oceanic. <b>It</b> <b>absolutely</b> is an evolution and a step forward.” Sonically, compared with Oceanic, “the drums and vocals are submerged, the riffs intricately monolithic” and there is an increased prominence lent to electronics and synths; this led to it being characterised as “a little more polished”.|$|E

As a result, Air France's flights to Algiers had crews entirely made of people who volunteered for the route. Air France had asked government officials if <b>it</b> <b>absolutely</b> had to continue flying to Algeria; as of the time of the hijacking, there had been no replies. Bernard Delhemme was the captain of the flight. Jean-Paul Borderie was the copilot, and Alain Bossuat was the flight engineer.

500|$|After {{the first}} part of the ballet {{received}} two full orchestral rehearsals in March, Monteux and the company departed to perform in Monte Carlo. Rehearsals resumed when they returned; the unusually large number of rehearsals—seventeen solely orchestral and five with the dancers—were fit into the fortnight before the opening, after Stravinsky's arrival in Paris on 13 May. The music contained so many unusual note combinations that Monteux had to ask the musicians to stop interrupting when they thought they had found mistakes in the score, saying he would tell them if something was played incorrectly. According to Doris Monteux, [...] "The musicians thought <b>it</b> <b>absolutely</b> crazy". At one point—a climactic brass fortissimo—the orchestra broke into nervous laughter at the sound, causing Stravinsky to intervene angrily.|$|E

The studio then released an official trailer on June 8. Forbes said, [...] "20th Century Fox has cut together a pretty perfect trailer in that <b>it</b> <b>absolutely</b> makes the sale.

500|$|After Portland was {{incorporated}} in 1851, quickly growing into Oregon's largest city, Oregon City gradually lost its importance {{as the economic}} and political center of the Willamette Valley. Beginning in the 1850s, steamboats began to ply the Willamette, {{despite the fact that they}} could not pass Willamette Falls. As a result, navigation on the Willamette River was divided into two stretches: the [...] lower stretch from Portland to Oregon City—which allowed connection with the rest of the Columbia River system—and the upper reach, which encompassed most of the Willamette's length. Any boats whose owners found <b>it</b> <b>absolutely</b> necessary to get past the falls had to be portaged. This led to competition for business among steam portage companies. In 1873, the construction of the Willamette Falls Locks bypassed the falls and allowed easy navigation between the upper and lower river. Each lock chamber measured [...] long and [...] wide, and the canal was originally operated manually before it switched to electrical power. Today, the lock system is little used.|$|E
500|$|Both the Imperial Austrian Ambassador in London, Count Wratislaw, and the Duke of Marlborough {{realised}} {{the implications}} of the situation on the Danube. The Dutch, however, who clung to their troops for their country's protection, were against any adventurous military operation as far south as the Danube and would never willingly permit any major weakening of the forces in the Spanish Netherlands. Marlborough, realising the only way to ignore Dutch wishes was by the use of secrecy and guile, set out to deceive his Dutch allies by pretending to simply move his troops to the Moselle – a plan approved of by The Hague – but once there, he would slip the Dutch leash and link up with Austrian forces in southern Germany. [...] "My intentions", wrote the Duke from The Hague on 29 April to his governmental confidant, Sidney Godolphin, [...] "are to march with the English to Coblenz and declare that I intend to campaign on the Moselle. But when I come there, to write to the Dutch States that I think <b>it</b> <b>absolutely</b> necessary for the saving of the Empire to march with the troops under my command and to join with those that are in Germany ... in order to make measures with Prince Lewis of Baden for the speedy reduction of the Elector of Bavaria." ...|$|E

500|$|The Wilson {{murder is}} a [...] "red ball", a police case {{involving}} an innocent victim, widely known suspects {{or a combination}} of the two. Red ball cases tend to draw attention from the media, the public and high-ranking police brass, and often result in additional detectives being added to the case. Fontana thought these elements of the red ball case would help produce a strong season premiere and tension among the veteran characters who resent the meddling of the new detectives. Julie Martin, one of the show's writers and supervising producers, said [...] "Blood Ties" [...] marked a deliberate change in the series, focusing on darker story lines that are [...] "a little messier and unresolved" [...] and more interpersonal relationships: [...] "The show's been on for six seasons, and <b>it</b> <b>absolutely</b> has to change. We can't keep doing the same show." [...] Media outlets noted that [...] "Blood Ties" [...] included more action-oriented elements such as car chases and a chase sequence involving helicopters at an airport. Fontana denied allegations of tampering from NBC executives and said any such changes would have come from him: [...] "I don't want us to have a style every week that we feel we have to conform to. ...

500|$|Michael O'Sullivan of The Washington Post scored Deadpool three-and-a-half stars out of four, {{calling it}} a [...] "voraciously self-aware comedy" [...] and the first R-rated Marvel film [...] "with real teeth". O'Sullivan praised the film's {{attitude}} and tone, along with Reynolds for making Deadpool a likeable character, and the film's action scenes. TheWrap's Alonso Duralde said Deadpool [...] "shouldn’t work, but <b>it</b> <b>absolutely</b> does", feeling that it successfully balanced the comedy with superhero action, and that the chemistry between Reynolds and Baccarin gave enough weight to the plot to support the tone and violence. Calvin Wilson at the St. Louis Post-Dispatch also gave the film three-and-a-half stars out of four, and {{said that it was}} [...] "smart, sexy, and outrageous", but that it would not work without Reynolds. Peter Bradshaw gave the film four stars out of five for The Guardian, calling it [...] "neurotic and needy—and very entertaining", and comparing it to Kick-Ass and Kill Bill. He did feel that the film's villains were underused though. Writing for Uproxx, Drew McWeeny described it as [...] "the world’s most violent and vulgar Bugs Bunny cartoon", and praised the film's unconventional plot structure, its personal stakes, the difference in tone and storytelling from other superhero films, and the cast. Varietys Justin Chang said the film is [...] "terribly arch and juvenile [...] also startlingly effective", praising Reynolds' performance (and the film's willingness to hide his looks under prosthetics), the script, and director Miller for staying [...] "out of the way of his script and his star". Todd McCarthy at The Hollywood Reporter felt the film took a while to get going, [...] "but once it does, Deadpool drops trou to reveal itself as a really raunchy, very dirty and pretty funny goof on the entire superhero ethos".|$|E
500|$|The album {{opens with}} [...] "Army of Me", a song [...] "so menacing and inorganic-sounding" [...] that, {{according}} to The New York Times, it verges on industrial rock. It is an aggressive technopop song with elements of trip hop. Dedicated to the singer's younger brother, the song's lyrics are, according to Björk herself, [...] "about telling {{someone who is}} full of self-pity and doesn't have anything together to get a life and stand up"; as she sings: [...] "And if you complain once more/You'll meet an army of me!" [...] "Hyperballad", which incorporates a spectrum of electronic and orchestral styles, {{has been described as}} [...] "a love song penned by Aphex Twin". NME wrote that its music [...] "altered from gentle folktronica to drum and bass-tinted acid house"; an attempt to reflect the song's lyrics, which are about [...] "the art of not forgetting about yourself". In them, Björk describes living {{at the top of a}} mountain and going to a cliff at sunrise. She throws objects off the cliff while pondering her own suicide. The ritual allows her to exorcise darker thoughts and return to her partner. [...] "Hyperballad" [...] is followed by [...] "The Modern Things", a song that, in a magical realist tone, [...] "playfully posits the theory that technology has always existed, waiting in mountains for humans to catch up". Interview described it in 1995 as a [...] "spooky tune", noting [...] "the odd scratchings at the end" [...] of the track. In his 2000 book Jung and the Postmodern: The Interpretation of Realities, Christopher Hauke described this effect at the end as [...] "when a record player has reached the end of an analogue, vinyl record and the needle is stuck as the disc continues going round"; and considered this [...] "trick" [...] to be a case of postmodernism, serving as an example of [...] "the relationship between the present and past that pushes conceptualising even further by the inclusion of modern technology and its ambivalent relationship with previous forms." [...] In a startling shift in style, the big band track [...] "It's Oh So Quiet" [...] covers a German composition made famous by Betty Hutton. It has been described as [...] "a palate-cleanser during the course of the record". The last song recorded for Post, Björk has said she decided to include it, [...] "just to make <b>it</b> <b>absolutely</b> certain that the album would be as schizophrenic as possible, that every song would be a shock".|$|E
