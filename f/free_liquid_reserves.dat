40|$|House Concurrent Resolution 133 {{required}} the Federal Reserve {{to break with}} past secrecy by announcing proposed annual growth rates for 2 ̆ 7 monetary aggregates 2 ̆ 7 four times a year.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{explores the}} use of <b>free</b> <b>liquid</b> jets for high speed immunoassays. Fluorescence and surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) are employed for readout. A <b>free</b> <b>liquid</b> jet was first used to speed incubations in an assay for rabbit IgG with fluorescently-tagged anti-rabbit IgG as label. Theoretical underpinnings of this method are put forward to explain {{the basis for the}} dramatic reductions in sample and label incubation times through comparisons in surface accumulation. Immunoassay incubation by <b>free</b> <b>liquid</b> jet was extended to detect a simulant for biowarfare agents with SERS detection. The theoretical model of accumulation via quiet solution and <b>free</b> <b>liquid</b> jets is extended to account for the observations in sample capture and labeling efficiency therein. The SERS-based immunoassay with <b>free</b> <b>liquid</b> jet for sample delivery was also applied to detect porcine parvovirus (PPV), an analyte with larger size than those previously used. The successful capture of PPV through jet incubation led to a study of SERS label size and its effect on labeling by jet. Finally, extremely sensitive detection of pathogenic bacteria, E. coli O 157 :H 7, was demonstrated by <b>free</b> <b>liquid</b> jet. The low levels of detection achieved in this assay were attributed to an enhancement mechanism in the way of detection of protein shed from the cells. This was supported by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), used to image the immunoassay substrate surface...|$|R

40|$|We {{modify the}} {{compound}} Poisson surplus model for an insurer by including <b>liquid</b> <b>reserves</b> and {{interest on the}} surplus. When the surplus of an insurer is below a fixed level, the surplus is kept as <b>liquid</b> <b>reserves,</b> which do not earn interest. When the surplus attains the level, the excess of the surplus over the level will receive interest at a constant rate. If the level goes to infinity, the modified model is reduced to the classical compound Poisson risk model. If the level is set to zero, the modified model becomes the compound Poisson risk model with interest. We study ruin probability and other quantities related to ruin in the modified compound Poisson surplus model by the Gerber-Shiu function and discuss the impact of interest and <b>liquid</b> <b>reserves</b> on the ruin probability, the deficit at ruin, and other ruin quantities. First, we derive a system of integro-differential equations for the Gerber-Shiu function. By solving the system of equations, we obtain the general solution for the Gerber-Shiu function. Then, we give the exact solutions for the Gerber-Shiu function when the initial surplus {{is equal to the}} <b>liquid</b> <b>reserve</b> level or equal to zero. These solutions are the key to the exact solution for the Gerber-Shiu function in general cases. As applications, we derive the exact solution for the zero discounted Gerber-Shiu function when claim sizes are exponentially distributed and the exact solution for the ruin probability when claim sizes have Erlang(2) distributions. Finally, we use numerical examples to illustrate the impact of interest and <b>liquid</b> <b>reserves</b> on the ruin probability...|$|R

40|$|This {{paper is}} closed access until 18 th April 2018. Fluid flow {{profiles}} in <b>free</b> <b>liquid</b> films stabilised by anionic and cationic surfactants under an external electric field were investigated. Depthwise velocity fields were {{measured at the}} mid region of the <b>free</b> <b>liquid</b> film by confocal μ-PIV and corresponding numerical simulations were performed using Finite Element Method (FEM) to model the system. Depthwise change in velocity profiles was observed with electroosmotic flow dominating {{in the vicinity of}} the gas-liquid and solid-liquid interfaces while backpressure drives fluid in the opposite direction at the core of the film. It was also found that the direction of the flow at various sections of the films depends on the type of surfactant used, but flow features remained the same. Numerical simulations predicted the flow profiles with reasonable accuracy; however, asymmetry of the actual film geometry caused deviations at the top half of the computational domain. Overall, electroosmotic flow profiles within a <b>free</b> <b>liquid</b> film is similar to that of the closed-end solid microchannel. However, the flow direction and features of the velocity profiles can be changed by selecting various types of surfactants. The <b>free</b> <b>liquid</b> films thickness was selected to match dimensions of foam Plateau border. Hence these findings will be useful in developing a separation system based on foam electrokinetics...|$|R

Liquid metal jets (pulsed or continuous) are proposed as potential target candidates. Such a proposal poses two critical problems: penetration of a <b>free</b> <b>liquid</b> jet inside the required strong inhomogeneous magnetic field (20 T) and the fragmentation of liquid due to the intense sudden heating by the proton beam and the resultant magnetohydrodynamic instabilities.

Of these, nine samplers contained mixtures of <b>free</b> <b>liquid</b> and saltcake, two contained only liquid, {{and one was}} empty. The saltcake contents generally appeared wet. A summary of the major tasks performed in this work are as follows: (1) Individual saltcake segments were extruded from the samplers and separated into saltcake and <b>free</b> <b>liquid</b> portions.

30|$|In this paper, we {{consider}} a compound Poisson surplus model with constant dividend barrier and <b>liquid</b> <b>reserves</b> under absolute ruin. When the surplus is negative, the insurer {{is allowed to}} borrow money at a debit interest rate to continue the business; when the surplus is below a fixed level △, the surplus is kept as <b>liquid</b> <b>reserves,</b> which do not earn interest; when the surplus attains the level △, the excess of the surplus over the level receives interest at a constant rate; when the surplus reaches a higher level b, the excess of the surplus above b is all paid out as dividends to shareholders of the insurer. We first derive the integro-differential equations satisfied by the moment-generating function and moment of the discounted dividend payments until absolute ruin. Then, applying these results, we get explicit expressions of them for exponential claims and discuss {{the impact of the}} model parameters on the expected dividend payments by numerical examples.|$|R

40|$|The film rupture {{process that}} {{dictates}} merging of adjacent bubbles {{is particularly important}} in nucleate boiling heat transfer, bubbly two-phase flow in small tubes, and the mechanisms that dictate the Leidenfrost transition. To understand the mechanisms of bubble merging in nano-structured boiling surfaces and in nanotubes, {{it is useful to}} explore film stability and onset of rupture at the molecular level. This dissertation reports the results of such an investigation combining three strategies that includes a new formulation of capillarity theory for <b>free</b> <b>liquid</b> films, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations using similar interaction potentials and bubble merging experiments. Two forms of our molecular film capillarity theory are developed here: one for non-polar fluids based on a Lennard-Jones interaction potential, and a second specifically for water using a modified treatment of the SPC/E interaction potential that accounts for water dipole interactions. The capillarity theory provides theoretical relationships among parameters that govern film structure and thermophysical behavior, while the companion MD simulations allow more detailed molecular level exploration of the film thermophysics. Results obtained with theoretical models and MD simulation studies indicate that the wave instability and the lack of thermodynamics intrinsic stability can lead to rupture of the liquid film, as its thickness decreases below a critical value. It is further predicted that wave instability predominates as an onset of rupture mechanism for liquid films of macroscopic extent, but for <b>free</b> <b>liquid</b> films with nanoscale lateral extent (in, for example, nanostructured boiling surfaces), lack of core stability {{is more likely to be}} the mechanism. For electrolyte aqueous solutions, theoretical models and MD simulation studies suggest that dissolved salts tend to alter the surface tension at liquid vapor interfaces and affect the stability of the <b>free</b> <b>liquid</b> film between adjacent bubbles. Bubble merging experiments are designed and carried out for various electrolyte aqueous solutions. The interaction of pairs of bubbles injected into solution with different dissolved salt concentrations is studied experimentally to determine the probability of merging from statistics for ensembles of bubble pairs. The results of these experiments indicate that for some types of salts, very low dissolved salt concentrations can strongly reduce the tendency of adjacent bubbles to merge, implying that the presence of the dissolved salt in such cases strongly enhances the stability of the <b>free</b> <b>liquid</b> film between adjacent bubbles. The trends are compared to predictions of <b>free</b> <b>liquid</b> film stability by wave instability theory and MD simulations...|$|R

40|$|Making {{use of a}} {{structural}} model that allows for optimal liquidity management, we study the role that repos play in a bank׳s financing structure. In our model the bank׳s assets consist of illiquid loans and <b>liquid</b> <b>reserves</b> and are financed {{by a combination of}} repos, long-term debt, deposits and equity. Repos are a cheap source of funding, but they are subject to an exogenous rollover risk. We show that the use of repos inflicts two types of indirect (“shadow”) costs on the bank׳s shareholders: first, it induces the bank to maintain higher <b>liquid</b> <b>reserves</b> in order to alleviate the additional default risk; second, it adds to the cost of long-term debt financing. These shadow costs limit the bank׳s appetite for cheap but unstable repo funding. This effect is, however, weakened under poor returns on risky assets, access to deposit funding and the depositor preference rule. We also analyze the impact of a liquidity coverage ratio, payout restrictions and a leverage ratio on the bank׳s financing choices and show that all these tools are able to curb the bank׳s reliance on repos...|$|R
