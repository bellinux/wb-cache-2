2500|$|The {{reasons that}} CCS is {{expected}} to cause such power price increases are several. Firstly, the increased energy requirements of capturing and compressing [...] significantly raises the operating costs of CCS-equipped power plants. In addition, there are added investment and capital costs. The process would increase the <b>fuel</b> <b>requirement</b> of a plant with CCS by about 25% for a coal-fired plant, and about 15% for a gas-fired plant. The cost of this extra fuel, as well as storage and other system costs, are estimated to increase the costs of energy from a power plant with CCS by 30–60%, depending on the specific circumstances. Pre-commercial CCS demonstration projects {{are likely to be}} more expensive than mature CCS technology; the total additional costs of an early large-scale CCS demonstration project are estimated to be €0.5-1.1 billion per project over the project lifetime. Other applications are possible. In the belief that use of sequestered carbon could be harnessed to offset the cost of capture and storage, Walker Architects published the first [...] gas CAES application, proposing the use of sequestered [...] for Energy Storage on October 24, 2008. To date the feasibility of such potential offsets to the cost have not been examined.|$|E

50|$|ATS-6 was {{launched}} on May 30, 1974, by a Titan III-C launch vehicle. The spacecraft was inserted {{directly in the}} geosynchronous orbit. This reduced the on-board fuel requirements to less than 40 kg (for a total mass at launch of nearly 1400 kg). The highly accurate orbit insertion further lowered the amount of fuel required for final positioning to 9 kg. This enabled a life extension from the original 2 year to 5 years, even accounting for the premature failure of the electric propulsion subsystem (the station-keeping <b>fuel</b> <b>requirement</b> being around 1.6 kg/year).|$|E

50|$|Courtney led until lap 36, when he aquaplaned {{going into}} Turn 8 {{and hit the}} wall, {{damaging}} the car and forcing {{him to return to}} the pits for repairs. The safety car was deployed due to the worsening conditions, with McLaughlin leading Davison and Lowndes. As the conditions continued to deteriorate, and a marshal was affected by lightning, the race was suspended on lap 42, with all cars returning to the pit lane. With the majority of the field having not taken on the required 140 L of fuel, questions were raised on how this would affect the result if the race was not restarted. The rules stated that any car that had not fulfilled the <b>fuel</b> <b>requirement</b> would be given a time penalty following the race, but it was unclear {{as to whether or not}} this applied to a shortened race. The race restarted at 5:10 pm with five minutes of its allocated time remaining, and drivers who had not met the <b>fuel</b> <b>requirement,</b> with the exception of Coulthard and Pye, pitted to take on the remaining fuel. This left Percat to take victory, his first solo win in the series, having completed 48 laps, ahead of Coulthard, Pye, Caruso and Tander. However, Coulthard and Pye were immediately given a 30-second time penalty for not complying with the fuel regulations, dropping them to 14th and 15th places respectively.|$|E
