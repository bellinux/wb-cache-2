5|$|Of the {{globular}} clusters within the Milky Way, {{the majority are}} found in a halo around the galactic core, and the large majority {{are located in the}} celestial sky centered on the core. In 1918, this strongly asymmetrical distribution was used by Shapley to make a determination of the overall <b>dimensions</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> galaxy. By assuming a roughly spherical distribution of {{globular clusters}} around the galaxy's center, he used the positions of the clusters to estimate the position of the Sun relative to the galactic center. While his distance estimate was in significant error (although within the same order of magnitude as the currently accepted value), it did demonstrate that the <b>dimensions</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> galaxy were much greater than had been previously thought. His error was due to interstellar dust in the Milky Way, which absorbs and diminishes the amount of light from distant objects, such as globular clusters, that reaches the Earth, thus making them appear to be more distant than they are.|$|E

5|$|The Euclidean {{algorithm}} can be visualized {{in terms}} of the tiling analogy given above for the greatest common divisor. Assume that we wish to cover an a-by-b rectangle with square tiles exactly, where a is the larger of the two numbers. We first attempt to tile the rectangle using b-by-b square tiles; however, this leaves an r0-by-b residual rectangle untiled, where r0 < b. We then attempt to tile the residual rectangle with r0-by-r0 square tiles. This leaves a second residual rectangle r1-by-r0, which we attempt to tile using r1-by-r1 square tiles, and so on. The sequence ends when there is no residual rectangle, i.e., when the square tiles cover the previous residual rectangle exactly. The length of the sides of the smallest square tile is the GCD of the <b>dimensions</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> original rectangle. For example, the smallest square tile in the adjacent figure is 21-by-21 (shown in red), and 21 is the GCD of 1071 and 462, the <b>dimensions</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> original rectangle (shown in green).|$|E

40|$|A famous open problem {{asks whether}} <b>the</b> {{asymptotic}} <b>dimension</b> <b>of</b> a CAT(0) group is necessarily finite.

For CAT(0) groups, the latter quantity is also known to be finite, so one approach is to try proving a similar inequality. So far those efforts have failed. Motivated by these questions we work toward understanding the relationship between large scale <b>dimension</b> <b>of</b> CAT(0) groups and small scale <b>dimension</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> group's boundary by shifting attention to <b>the</b> linearly controlled <b>dimension</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> boundary.
