40|$|Congress {{has been}} aware that {{to serve the}} needs of the {{government}} and the nation it must evolve a highly developed foreign acquisitions program. The effective founding of the Library might be said to date from the placing with a London dealer in June 1800 of the first order for an initial shipment of books. The first <b>exchange</b> <b>of</b> <b>official</b> publications with a foreign country, France, took place in 1837. However, foreign documents did not begin to arrive at the Library in quantity until after 1867, when Congress passed a resolution authorizing the <b>exchange</b> <b>of</b> public documents. The previous year, the acquisition of the 40, 000 -volume Smithsonian Institution Library gave the Library of Congress an outstanding collection of foreign scientific publications. The Smithsonian exchange system provided for its continued growth and also served as the mechanism for the <b>exchange</b> <b>of</b> <b>official</b> publications. As might be expected, the emphasis {{in the development of the}} Library’s collections concerning foreign geographic areas was on Western Europe. However, by the end of the nineteenth century, the Library had also accumulated a considerable Chinese collection (exchange with China started in 1869), and its acquisition in 1907 of the private library of Gennadius Vasilievich Yudin placed it among the foremost institutions in the Russian field. Collections covering other areas of the world were gradually developed but it was not until the 1940 s that emphasis was placed on the prompt and comprehensive acquisition upon publication of all materials the Library might later require. The increased attention to publications from overseas is reflected in the “Canons of Selection ” by the then Librarian of Congress, Archibald Mac-Leish, which read: “The Library of Congress should possess, in some useful form, the material parts of the records of other societies, past and present, and should accumulate, in original or in copy, full and This chapter was prepared by various members of the Library of Congress staf...|$|R

50|$|As far as ancient {{literary}} {{sources are}} concerned, an extant continuous account of Trajan's reign does not exist. An {{account of the}} Dacian Wars, the Commentarii de bellis Dacicis, written by Trajan himself or a ghostwriter and modelled after Caesar's Commentarii de Bello Gallico, is lost {{with the exception of}} one sentence. Only fragments remain of the Getiká, a book by Trajan's personal physician Titos Statilios Kriton. The Parthiká, a 17-volume account of the Parthian Wars written by Arrian, has met a similar fate. Book68 in Cassius Dio's Roman History, which survives mostly as Byzantine abridgments and epitomes, is the main source for the political history of Trajan's rule. Besides this, Pliny the Younger's Panegyricus and Dio of Prusa's orations are the best surviving contemporary sources. Both are adulatory perorations, typical of the late Roman era, that describe an idealized monarch and an equally idealized view of Trajan's rule, and concern themselves more with ideology than with actual fact. The tenth volume of Pliny's letters contains his correspondence with Trajan, which deals with various aspects of imperial Roman government, but this correspondence is neither intimate nor candid: it is an <b>exchange</b> <b>of</b> <b>official</b> mail, in which Pliny's stance borders on the servile. It is certain that much of text of the letters that appear in this collection over Trajan's signature was written and/or edited by Trajan's Imperial secretary, his ab epistulis. Therefore, discussion of Trajan and his rule in modern historiography cannot avoid speculation, as well as recourse to non-literary sources such as archaeology and epigraphy.|$|R

Disgruntled with LPF, a group led by Club Athletico Paulistano left the traditional entity and decided to create a parallel league in the city of São Paulo, organized by the newly founded APEA (or APSA, according to the original spelling). The breaking point was the possibility of the LPF accepting the joining of clubs of popular origin - such as the Sport Club Corinthians Paulista - and the <b>exchange</b> <b>of</b> the <b>official</b> field <b>of</b> the championship - the league closed with an exclusive rent with the Germanic, owner of the Park of the Antarctica Paulista, {{to the detriment of the}} Velodrome of São Paulo, belonging to Paulistano.

40|$|President Clinton's North Korea policy {{showed a}} change from {{conflict}} early in his presidency to cooperation {{towards the end of}} his administration. Why did this happen? By using the diplomatic history method, two hypotheses can explain this change: the incorporation of the Democratic Peace Thesis into US foreign policy and Congress's leadership in the policy-making process. The Democratic Peace Thesis states that it is less likely for a democracy to go to war than a non-democracy; therefore, the world should have more democracies. The USA can incorporate the Democratic Peace Thesis into its foreign policy and push for these transitions to happen. North Korea is not a democracy and was also trying to become an aggressive nuclear power. Clinton started to incofPorate more of the monadic version of the Democratic Peace Thesis into his policies; a democratic country does not go to war because the norms and values of a democracy make it inherently more peaceful. It. would try to use engagement methods like eco,'!omic incentives and discussions with North Korea. The presidential documents leading, up to the Agreed Framework show how Clinton eventually embraced the monadic version of the Democratic Peace Thesis. After the Agreed Framework, the documents showed how Clinton fully incorporated the Democratic Peace Thesis into his North Korean policy. Many congressmen did not like that the Agreed Framework was to be the basis for the USA's North Korea policy. The congressional documents show that Congress was less willing to accept presidential policy. After the Agreed Framewor~, Congress limited funding to KEDO. It also reasserted itself in non-security matters such as drug tr. afficking, food aid, and MIAs. The documents show that Clinton acquiesced to CC?ngress and carried out an overhaul of America's policy towards North Korea. The subsequent Perry Report led to the final stage of Clinton's North Korea policy. With the support of Congress,Clinton continued to peacefully engage North Korea, and the USA reduced economic sanctions against the state. Bilateral <b>exchanges</b> <b>of</b> <b>officials</b> continued to decrease tensions, but the debacle of the 2000 US presidential election abruptly ended Clinton's foreign poJicy towards North Korea.

50|$|A {{major change}} in foreign {{military}} cooperation occurred when China began developing military contacts with West European nations and the United States in the late 1970s and the 1980s. This change reflected China's desire to counter Soviet influence, especially in Europe, {{as well as to}} develop relations with modern armed forces. China needed advanced hardware and technology and organizational, training, personnel, logistics, and doctrinal concepts for modernizing the PLA. Chinese military ties with West European countries were strongest with Britain, France, and Italy. Chinese military relations with the United States developed rapidly in the 1980s and included <b>exchanges</b> <b>of</b> high-level military <b>officials</b> and working-level delegations in training, logistics, and education. The United States sold some weapons to China for defensive purposes, but China was unlikely to purchase large amounts of American arms because of financial and political constraints (see Sino-American relations).|$|R

40|$|Graduation date: 2014 While {{discussing}} {{what types}} of campaign finance laws are and are not constitutional in his opinion in McCutcheon v. FEC, 572 U. S. ____ (2014), Chief Justice John Roberts stated that “those who govern should be the last people to help decide who should govern. ” His intent was to highlight how any regulations that are not narrowly tailored to prevent the act or appearance of quid pro quo corruption, the <b>exchange</b> <b>of</b> an <b>official</b> act for money, do not represent a sufficiently compelling interest to justify infringing on 1 st Amendment rights and thus are unconstitutional. But what if those who govern were deciding who should govern, not by enacting campaign finance restrictions on how individuals or PACs spend their funds, but through their own parties’ spending? The prototypical example of corruption {{is a member of}} Congress receiving funds and as a result making an official action that benefits the contributor. However, the opposite would also be considered corruption - members of Congress being rewarded after taking some sort of action. I will demonstrate that the way the two parties’ congressional campaign committees spend money is systematically driving who governs by favoring more ideologically extreme candidates. I will further argue that this could represent a compelling interest sufficient to enact further campaign finance restrictions...|$|R

Buttrey is dismissive of the brothel token idea, asserting [...] "there is no evidence for any of this" [...] (Buttrey 1973, p. 53). Currently, only Simonetta and Riva are supporters of the brothel token hypothesis, which is also popular with the media (see Duggan 2016); other scholars pursue alternate lines of enquiry (Buttrey; Campana; Duggan; Fishburn; etc.). Under Caracalla, an equestrian {{was sentenced to death}} for bringing a coin with the emperor's likeness into a brothel; he was spared only by the emperor's own death. There is no direct ancient evidence, however, to support the theory that spintriae were created as tokens for <b>exchange</b> in place <b>of</b> <b>official</b> coinage. Numismatist Theodore V. Buttrey suggests that they were used as game pieces. although Duggan (2015) notes there are no archaeological finds to confirm the spintriae were gaming pieces.

5000|$|Oceania is, to the People's Republic of China and the Republic of China (Taiwan), a {{stage for}} {{continuous}} diplomatic competition. Eight states in Oceania recognise the PRC, and six recognise the ROC.

In {{keeping with the}} [...] "One China Policy", {{it is not possible}} for any country to maintain official diplomatic relations with [...] "both Chinas", and this [...] "either/or" [...] factor has resulted in the PRC and the ROC actively courting diplomatic favours from small Pacific nations. In 2003, the People's Republic of China announced it intended to enhance its diplomatic ties with the Pacific Islands Forum, and increase the economic aid package it provided to that organisation. At the same time, PRC delegate Zhou Whenzhong added: [...] "The PIF should refrain from any <b>exchanges</b> <b>of</b> an <b>official</b> nature or dialogue partnership of any form with Taiwan". In 2006, Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao announced that the PRC would increase its economic cooperation with Pacific Island States. The PRC would provide more economic aid, abolish tariffs for exports from the Pacific's least developed countries, annul the debt of those countries, distribute free anti-malaria medicines, and provide training for two thousand Pacific Islander government officials and technical staff.
