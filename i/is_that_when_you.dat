500|$|... "Steve Burdick" [...] {{scored a}} Nielsen rating of 9.7, equating to {{approximately}} 9.5 million viewers, and a 17 share, meaning that 17% of all television {{sets in use}} during its time period were tuned to the episode. NBC reported losing $500,000 in advertising revenue. Speaking of this loss, then-NBC president Warren Littlefield said, at odds with NBC's earlier denial of possible revenue loss being a factor in its scheduling decision, [...] "There are few things in broadcasting that we know for sure, {{and one of those}} <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> do an episode of any series that deals with AIDS, {{there is going to be}} advertiser sensitivity to it. And if you choose to do it anyway, you better count on losing money." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "My {{thoughts}} are with Taiwanese students and other protesters expressing {{opposition to a}} proposed economic pact with China. The world is watching these courageous students. The message to President Ma <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> try to jam a trade agreement through, people will resist." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "I {{think the}} way the game is written <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> first start playing it, it is fun, and you make great accomplishments. And then the further you get into it, the higher level you get, the longer {{you have to stay}} on it to move onward, and then it isn't fun anymore. But by then you're addicted, and you can't leave it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I could {{swear to}} you in a police-court. What put the lid on it <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> cutting my wire--and an infernal liberty it was!--I saw that white tuft of yours {{sticking}} out from behind your mask." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, I {{think you}} would have had to do so somehow, my dear, but <b>that</b> <b>is</b> not the {{question}} now. My plan <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> had succeeded in doing this you should marry him and go home with him." ...|$|R

2500|$|Jones tirelessly {{defended the}} {{integrity}} of country music, telling Billboard in 2006, [...] "It's never been for love of money. [...] I thank God for it because it makes me a living. [...] But I sing because I love it, {{not because of the}} dollar signs." [...] Jones also {{went out of his way}} to promote younger country singers that he felt were as passionate about the music as he was. [...] "Everybody knows he's a great singer," [...] Alan Jackson stated in 1995, [...] "but what I like most about George <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> meet him, he is like some old guy that works down at the gas station...even though he's a legend!" ...|$|E
2500|$|Paisley {{was born}} on October 28, 1972, in Glen Dale, West Virginia. He is {{the only child of}} Douglas Edward [...] "Doug" [...] Paisley, who worked for the West Virginia Department of Transportation, and Sandra Jean [...] "Sandy" [...] (née Jarvis) Paisley, a teacher. He was raised in Glen Dale, West Virginia. He has stated that his love of country music stems from his {{maternal}} grandfather, Warren Jarvis, who gave him his first guitar, a Sears Danelectro Silvertone, and taught him how to play at eight years old. At ten, he performed {{for the first time in}} public by singing in his church. He later recalled that, [...] "Pretty soon, I was performing at every Christmas party and Mother's Day event. The neat thing about a small town <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> want to be an artist, by golly, they'll make you one." [...] At age 13, he wrote his first song, [...] "Born on Christmas Day", which later appeared on his album Brad Paisley Christmas. He had been taking lessons with local guitarist Clarence [...] "Hank" [...] Goddard. By 13, Goddard and Paisley formed a band called [...] "Brad Paisley and the C-Notes", with the addition of two of Paisley's adult friends.|$|E
2500|$|In 1997, {{one of the}} {{international}} alpine skiing classifiers was Mirre Kipfer. [...] She said [...] "Sometimes athletes try to cheat, to hide what they can really do. [...] They are athletes {{who want to be}} in a class [...] that is more advantageous to for them. [...] In testing and classification they don't show what they can really do. [...] They try to show that they are not able to do some movement, and that is why we have started functional testing." [...] She goes on to say [...] "The second problem <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> have a very good athlete who is very well trained in the sport, you don't want to punish that person for their good performance. [...] He or she might be an elite athlete doing a very good sport performance, and you might be tempted to say 'OK, he is doing so well he must be in another class.' We do try to get fewer classes so that we don't get, for example, 10 or 12 gold medals in alpine sports. [...] We try to review the classes, but you always have borderline classes and it is always difficult. [...] In winter the aim is to have three classes, like sitting, standing and blind: that is certainly the future that we are all looking to." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You needn't {{get into}} a rage," [...] he said. [...] "If I'm {{willing to put up}} with it, I suppose you needn't cry out. All I meant <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> tell me a thing is going to cost so much, I like to--well, in fact, I--like to know where I am." ...|$|R
2500|$|Esau was heartbroken by the {{deception}} and begged {{for his own}} blessing. Having made Jacob a ruler over his brothers, Isaac could only promise, [...] "By your sword you shall live, but your brother you shall serve; yet it shall <b>be</b> <b>that</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> aggrieved, you may cast off his yoke from upon your neck" [...] (27:39–40).|$|R
5000|$|And {{it shall}} <b>be</b> <b>that</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> {{multiply}} and become fruitful in the land, {{in those days}} - {{the word of the}} LORD - they will no longer say, 'The Ark of the Covenant of the LORD' and it will not come to mind; they will not mention it, and will not recall it, and it will not be used any more.|$|R
2500|$|The {{following}} figures {{provide a}} visual illustration {{of how the}} Fourier transform measures whether a frequency is present in a particular function. The depicted function [...] oscillates at 3Hz (if [...] measures seconds) and tends quickly to 0. (The second factor in this equation is an envelope function that shapes the continuous sinusoid into a short pulse. Its general form is a Gaussian function). This function was specially chosen {{to have a real}} Fourier transform that can easily be plotted. The first image contains its graph. In order to calculate [...] we must integrate [...] The second image shows the plot of the real and imaginary parts of this function. The real part of the integrand is almost always positive, because when [...] is negative, the real part of [...] is negative as well. Because they oscillate at the same rate, when [...] is positive, so is the real part of [...] The result <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> integrate the real part of the integrand you get a relatively large number (in this case [...] ). On the other hand, when you try to measure a frequency that is not present, as in the case when we look at , you see that both real and imaginary component of this function vary rapidly between positive and negative values, as plotted in the third image. Therefore, in this case, the integrand oscillates fast enough so that the integral is very small and the value for the Fourier transform for that frequency is nearly zero.|$|E
6000|$|... "Hard cases!" [...] said Harry presently. [...] "If I was sheriff I'd clean {{this hole}} right out. There are decent folks here, but {{the curious thing}} <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> let two or three toughs into a place they seem to get on top." ...|$|E
6000|$|Then the Water-midden looked {{long and}} gravely at {{him out of}} darkling eyes. She put out her hand and touched his. [...] "This shall be my sorrowful wish, little Mulgar: it <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> and your {{brothers}} come at last to the Kingdom of Assasimmon, and the Valleys of Tishnar, you will not forget me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... [Still quite lightly.] It <b>was</b> {{inevitable}} <b>that</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> ceased being Arthur's {{private secretary}} {{we should see}} less of one another.|$|R
6000|$|... "It <b>is</b> not <b>that.</b> <b>When</b> <b>you</b> ask me--to--to--love you, {{of course}} I {{know what you}} mean. Should I not speak the truth at once?" ...|$|R
5000|$|Chris Lintott commented that: [...] "One {{advantage}} <b>is</b> <b>that</b> {{you get to}} see {{parts of}} space <b>that</b> have never <b>been</b> seen before. These images were taken by a robotic telescope and processed automatically, so the odds <b>are</b> <b>that</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> log on, <b>that</b> first galaxy you see will <b>be</b> one <b>that</b> no human has seen before." [...] This was confirmed by Kevin Schawinski: [...] "Most of these galaxies have been photographed by a robotic telescope, and then processed by computer. So {{this is the first time}} they will have been seen by human eyes.".|$|R
6000|$|Foster {{wished he}} had been more tactful and thought his comrade's {{amusement}} might better have been restrained; but Lawrence resumed: [...] "It must have been annoying to leave the mill when you had much to do. The curious thing <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> set off from the Crossing with me you declared you were tired of working for dollars." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "If my {{wife does}} not get tired of you, I shall not," [...] Lord Peterborough said to Nora. [...] "The thing <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> do go we shall miss you so terribly." [...] In September, too, there {{happened}} another event which took Stanbury to Exeter, and all needful particulars as to that event shall be narrated in the next chapter.|$|E
6000|$|Mrs. Acton laughed. [...] "You needn't worry {{yourself}} on that point. We have all our little hobbies. My husband's is {{the acquisition of}} dollars {{and the opening of}} mines and mills. Mine is the amusing of my friends, or, rather, the permitting them to amuse themselves, which is why I had Bonavista built. I make only one stipulation--it <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> stay with us, you are amused." ...|$|E
5000|$|After {{only one}} {{series of the}} programme, Simon Woodroffe left the panel. Woodroffe stated that the reason behind his {{departure}} was [...] "The show became a battle of egos — not a forum for business innovation. The thing to remember <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> walk {{up the stairs to}} pitch, it’s not five people necessarily thinking 'How am I {{going to be able to}} make an investment here?', they’re also thinking: 'Am I going to be the star of this next little piece?'.

6000|$|... "You can't do it!" [...] he said, emphatically. [...] "One of {{the chief}} punishments of you men of ill-gotten wealth <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> do repent you find that you have lost {{the power to make}} {{reparation}} or restitution. I admire your good intentions, Dan, but you can't do anything. Those people were robbed of their precious pennies. It's too late to remedy the evil. You can't pay them back" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Of course," [...] Mrs. Kenton soothingly assented. [...] "And I don't {{say that}} she dreams of him in any such way. She can't help admiring his mind. But what I mean <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> see how he appreciates her, you can't help wishing he could know just how wise, and just how good she is. It did seem {{to me as if}} I would give almost {{anything}} to have him know what she had been through with that--rapscallion!" ...|$|E
6000|$|Then the Lady Vivien laughed {{very high}} and shrill. [...] "Sir," [...] quoth she, [...] "you are very brave for to {{undertake}} that adventure wherein so good a knight as Sir Sagramore failed so signally. Gladly will I direct you upon your way, {{and all that}} I ask in return <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> have sped in that adventure, you will also return hither as did Sir Sagramore, so that I may bestow a white mule upon you as I bestowed one to him." ...|$|E

60|$|Arthur, {{what could}} I do? His wife was there, and his mother. If you'd seen them.... I couldn't {{bear to look}} at their misery and do nothing. I said I <b>was</b> sure <b>that</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> knew all the facts you'd reprieve the man.|$|R
6000|$|... "There is this {{peculiarity}} about women," [...] {{continued his}} parent, [...] "which I beg you always to remember. It <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> {{think she is}} doing {{what you want and}} that she loves you, you are doing what she wants and really she only loves herself.

Do you understand?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'But {{you will}} take your papers with you.' She held them out to me as she spoke. 'The Prince has crossed the Rubicon now, and nothing can bring him back.

Well boiled, they might serve for greens; but as smoking material they are not worth the match with which you light them, especially not if the match be a German one.
