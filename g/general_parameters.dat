50|$|In <b>general,</b> <b>parameters</b> {{estimation}} {{techniques can}} be classified into: spectral based and parametric based methods. In the former, one forms some spectrum-like function of the parameter(s) of interest. The locations of the highest (separated) peaks of the function in question are recorded as the DOA estimates. Parametric techniques, on the other hand, require a simultaneous search for all parameters of interest. The basic advantage of using the parametric approach comparing to the spectral based approach is the accuracy, albeit {{at the expense of}} an increased computational complexity.|$|E
40|$|In this paper, a <b>general</b> <b>parameter</b> (GP) {{extension}} to polynomial and sinusoidal FIR predictors is proposed for extended sinusoidal and Rayleigh fading signal prediction. With a single adaptive <b>general</b> <b>parameter,</b> it is shown possible to extend prediction capabilities of polynomial and sinusoidal FIR predictors beyond polynomial input signals, or beyond the nominal design frequencies. This allows for more accurate prediction of input signals with unknown time varying statistics. The form of adaptation proposed {{can be regarded}} as the simplest possible adaptive filtering, and is shown to yield improved filtering performance at low computational cost. It is demonstrated that the proposed method provides for improved prediction of sinusoidal and Rayleigh distributed signals. Here, Rayleigh distributed signal models the received transmission power in a mobile communications system, and the sinusoid is a model of the power line frequency...|$|R

Optionally, for added realism, when buying units the rarity of the unit can be taken into account. This keeps the battles true to the time period, as players trying to use rarer units are penalized. Additionally, scenario designers often carefully research a battle to create accurate historical battles.|$|E
