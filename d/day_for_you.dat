5|$|The {{majority}} of the film's original score was composed by Raymond Wong and performed by the Hong Kong Chinese Orchestra. The score imitates traditional Chinese music used in 1940s swordplay films. One of Wong's works, Nothing Ventured, Nothing Gained, provides a stark contrast between the villainous Axe Gang and the peaceful neighbourhood of Pig Sty Alley, depicted by a Chinese folk song, Fisherman's Song of the East China Sea. Along with Wong's compositions and various traditional Chinese songs, classical compositions are featured in the score, including excerpts from Zigeunerweisen by Pablo de Sarasate and Sabre Dance by Aram Khachaturian. The song, Zhiyao Weini Huo Yitian (只要為你活一天; Only Want to Live One <b>Day</b> <b>for</b> <b>You),</b> is sung in the background by Eva Huang {{at the end of}} the film. Written by Liu Chia-chang (劉家昌) in the 1970s, it tells of a girl's memories of a loved one, and her desire to live for him again. Kung Fu Hustle was nominated for Best Original Film Score at the 24th Hong Kong Film Awards.|$|E

The song particularly resonates with its composer's widow, Olivia Harrison. [...] "George singing was always beguiling to me", she writes in her {{introduction to the}} posthumous edition of I, Me, Mine, [...] "and countless times I was his audience of one. Run of the Mill was a song I often asked him to play, the lyrics so wise, especially the reminder that, 'Tomorrow when you rise, another <b>day</b> <b>for</b> <b>you</b> to realise me' ('me' being God)..." [...] Speaking to Mojo magazine in December 2011, ten years after her husband's death, Olivia Harrison named it as the song that most reminded her of Harrison. Music critic Tim Riley calls it [...] "the best of the lot" [...] on All Things Must Pass.|$|E
