Prideaux contended that the office of postmaster and the carrying of letters were two distinct things, and that the 1652 resolution of Parliament referred to the former only; but eventually all previous grants were held to be set aside by that resolution, and in 1653 contracts were let for the <b>inland</b> and foreign <b>mails</b> to John Manley.|$|R

5000|$|He {{began working}} for the Post Office in 1819. In 1835 or 1836 he became a chief {{inspector}} of letter carriers. His exact title varied over the years because in the early 19th century there were three separate services with separate corps of letter-carriers: twopenny-post (for mail within London; renamed the London District Post Office in 1844); <b>inland</b> (for domestic <b>mail</b> outside London); and foreign (for overseas mail). [...] Although the foreign letter-carriers had been abolished by 1835, with their duties {{carried out by the}} other two services, the (by then renamed) General Post and London District letter-carriers remained separate until 1855, with separate chief inspectors.

Manley {{was given a}} monopoly on the postal service, which was effectively enforced by Protector Oliver Cromwell's government, {{and thanks to the}} improvements necessitated by the war Manley ran a much improved Post Office service. In July 1655 the Post Office was put under the direct government control of John Thurloe, a Secretary of State, and best known to history as Cromwell's spymaster general. Previous English governments had tried to prevent conspirators communicating, Thurloe preferred to deliver their post having surreptitiously read it. As the Protectorate claimed to govern all of Great Britain and Ireland under one unified government, on 9 June 1657 the Second Protectorate Parliament (which included Scottish and Irish MPs) passed the [...] "Act for settling the Postage in England, Scotland and Ireland" [...] that created one monopoly Post Office for the whole territory of the Commonwealth. The first Postmaster General was appointed in 1661, and a seal was first fixed to the mail.|$|R

Due to deregulations since the early 1990s some lines are run as public service obligations by private contractors. In addition to that there is an association of local bus companies called Bussgods which works as a courier for bulkier goods between bus stops and/or terminals. Unlike the British postbuses these vehicles are built on full-size coaches chassis with a box body and a tail lift in the rear end to accommodate heavier goods and even pallets sent along with the mail. This unusual truck/bus combination is nicknamed [...] "Skvader".|$|E
5000|$|The Star Route scandal {{involved}} a lucrative 19th century scheme whereby United States postal officials received bribes {{in exchange for}} awarding postal delivery contracts in southern and western areas. On March 3, 1845 Congress had created <b>inland</b> <b>mail</b> routes, eventually known as [...] "Star Routes", derived from the three [...] "* * *" [...] postal registry designation. After the American Civil War, these highly sought after routes increased due to rapid expansion in the West and South West regions of the United States. The potential for illicit profits made the Postal Service ripe for corruption and scandal due to defects in the Post Office laws and regulations. The way the swindle worked was that contractors would first make low [...] "straw" [...] bids for the routes, while other contractors in the ring would make exorbitantly high bids. Through a series of default bidding, the ring contractor would receive the contract route at an exorbitant high price. Profits from the excessively high contracts would be split between ring leaders. The ring consisted of a complex relationship between brokers, contractors, and appointed members of the Post Office. Millions of dollars were being depleted from the national treasury.|$|E

50|$|On 2 March 1792 {{the acting}} {{governor}} of the Cape, Johan Isaac Rhenius, opened a post office in a room next to the pantry at the Castle in Cape Town. This {{was the start of}} what became the South Africa Post Office (SAPO). By 1805 there was a regular <b>inland</b> <b>mail</b> service between Algoa Bay and False Bay in the Cape, using farmers on horseback. A mail wagon ran twice a week between Cape Town and the town of Stellenbosch. In 1806, Sir David Baird ruled that Khoi, enslaved indigenous people of the Cape, would be used to convey letters and small packages. A mail boat service was introduced between England and the Cape in 1815 and in 1848 the then Transvaal government appointed postmen to transport official mail. Prior to this development mail had been sent by special messenger, or by any available transport. The first stamp issued in South Africa was the Cape Triangular stamp introduced in 1853. The stamp has two values - the four pence blue and the one penny red. In 1860 the first postboxes were erected in the Cape and several railway lines were completed and used to transport mail. The first mail train was introduced in 1883.|$|E
