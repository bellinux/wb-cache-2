50|$|The <b>fixed</b> <b>blades</b> act as nozzles. The steam {{coming from}} the boiler is passed to the first ring of <b>fixed</b> <b>blades,</b> where it gets {{partially}} expanded. The pressure partially decreases and the velocity rises correspondingly. The velocity is absorbed by the following rings of moving blades until it reaches the next ring of <b>fixed</b> <b>blades</b> and the whole process is repeated once again.|$|R
5000|$|The {{enthalpy}} {{drop in the}} <b>fixed</b> <b>blades,</b> {{with the}} assumption that the velocity of steam entering the <b>fixed</b> <b>blades</b> is equal to the velocity of steam leaving the previously moving blades is given by: ...|$|R
50|$|From {{the above}} figure {{it can be}} seen that the steam, after exiting from the moving blades, enters into the <b>fixed</b> <b>blades.</b> The <b>fixed</b> <b>blades</b> {{redirect}} the steam into the next set of moving blades. Hence, steam loses its velocity in multiple stages rather than in a single stage.|$|R
500|$|Folk {{tradition}} {{has it that}} Bajo first left Piva for Drobnjaci, and eventually Drobnjaci for Morača. Bajo was originally engaged to Milica, daughter of a local knez Bogdan Papović from Kazanci. Bogdan was, however, pressured by the recently appointed Pasha of Gacko to hand his daughter to him. Pasha, originally Tepavčević, was taken through devshirme, islamized, educated and served in Constantinople and Travnik. They arranged for a meeting on which Milica was supposed to break the engagement, and choose Pasha instead of Bajo. Bajo, who prepared himself for a wedding, came to the meeting, and after questioning the girl about her choice, asked for his ring back. Milica handed it to him, at which moment Bajo killed her as well as Pasha {{and two of his}} bodyguards. Knez Bogdan took shelter in his house, which Bajo burned, together with a mosque Pasha erected not long ago, killing with his kinsmen and grooms all the Ottomans who served the Pasha in the process. This action caused him to abandon his tribe, losing all his wealth, and relocate to Drobnjaci, where he planned to lay low for a certain amount of time. There, he presented himself as Spasoje Sokolović, and found a job as an employee of Knez Tomić. [...] Since it was the mowing part of the year, Hasan-Aga Kopčić ordered all of the local knez's to send him their workforces to Bukovica. Bajo was among these people, and he broke his mowing blade [...] one day while working. Taking a break to fix it, he enraged the Agha, who started hiting him with a whip. Bajo then decapitated him with his <b>fixed</b> <b>blade,</b> took his horse and weapons and ran to Morača, which at the time was hajduk's nest and the most defiant of all the Montenegrin Highland tribes towards Ottomans. Bajo lived in Morača for several years, his exploits from this period (like the killing of Hafiz-bey, saving his sister Jela from Muslim maruders and protecting his cousin Sekula from wealthy and vain Pejović family) are preserved in collective memory of the population of North Montenegro. Morača was razed by the Ottomans sometime in the late 1640's, after which Bajo took shelter in Venetian controlled territories.|$|E

50|$|In {{the above}} figure {{there are two}} rings of moving blades {{separated}} by a single of ring of <b>fixed</b> <b>blades.</b> As discussed earlier the entire pressure drop occurs in the nozzle, {{and there are no}} subsequent pressure losses in any of the following stages. Velocity drop occurs in the moving blades and not in <b>fixed</b> <b>blades.</b>|$|R
50|$|It is a {{combination}} of the above two types of compounding. The total pressure drop of the steam is divided into a number of stages. Each stage consists of rings of <b>fixed</b> and moving <b>blades.</b> Each set of rings of moving blades is separated by a single ring of <b>fixed</b> <b>blades.</b> In each stage there is one ring of <b>fixed</b> <b>blades</b> and 3-4 rings of moving blades. Each stage acts as a velocity compounded impulse turbine.|$|R

50|$|The {{rings of}} moving blades are {{separated}} by rings of <b>fixed</b> <b>blades.</b> The moving blades are keyed to the turbine shaft and the <b>fixed</b> <b>blades</b> are <b>fixed</b> to the casing. The high pressure steam coming from the boiler is expanded in the nozzle first. The Nozzle converts the pressure energy of the steam into kinetic energy. It {{is interesting to note}} that the total enthalpy drop and hence the pressure drop occurs in the nozzle. Hence, the pressure thereafter remains constant.|$|R
2500|$|... is {{the rotor}} {{generated}} by bivector B. Simple rotations, {{that take place}} in a plane of rotation around a <b>fixed</b> <b>blade</b> of dimension [...] are generated by simple bivectors, while other bivectors generate more complex rotations which can be described in terms of the simple bivectors they are sums of, each related to a plane of rotation. All bivectors can be expressed as the sum of orthogonal and commutative simple bivectors, so rotations can always be decomposed into a set of commutative rotations about the planes associated with these bivectors. The group of the rotors in n dimensions is the spin group, Spin(n).|$|E

2500|$|Chris Reeve Knives {{was founded}} as a sole {{proprietorship}} in January 1984, with Chris Reeve making custom knives {{in the single}} garage attached {{to the house in}} which Reeve was living in Durban, South Africa. [...] In March 1989, Reeve and his partner Anne Reeve immigrated to the United States, and CRK commenced manufacturing in Boise, ID. [...] In July 1993, Chris Reeve Knives, sole proprietorship, became Reeve Incorporated, doing business as Chris Reeve Knives. [...] Reeve collaborated with Dick Barber of Crucible Materials Corporation to develop CPM S30V steel as a knifemaking steel in 2003. [...] Chris Reeve Knives has collaborated with William Harsey, Jr. on several <b>fixed</b> <b>blade</b> knife projects, and serves as the manufacturer of these knives.|$|E
2500|$|One of {{the first}} one handed devices was the {{automatic}} spring release, {{also known as a}} switchblade. An innovation to pocket knives made possible by the thumb-stud is the replaceable blade insert developed in 1999 by Steven Overholt (U.S. Patent no. 6,574,868), originally marketed by TigerSharp Technologies and as of 2007 by Clauss. Some systems are somewhat between assisted opening and the normal thumb stud. CRKT knives designed by Harold [...] "Kit" [...] Carson often incorporate a [...] "Carson Flipper", which is a small protrusion on the rear of the base of the blade such that it protrudes out the obverse side of the handle (when closed). By using an index finger and a very slight snapping of the wrist, the knife opens very quickly, appearing to operate like a spring assisted knife. When opened, the protrusion is between the base of the sharp blade and the user's index finger, preventing any accidental slipping of the hand onto the blade. Some designs feature a second [...] "Flipper" [...] {{on the opposite side of}} the blade, forming a small [...] "hilt guard" [...] such as a <b>fixed</b> <b>blade</b> knife has, which can prevent another blade from sliding up into the hilt in combat.|$|E

50|$|One can {{see from}} the formula that only a {{fraction}} of the enthalpy is converted into velocity in the <b>fixed</b> <b>blades.</b> Hence, velocity is very less as compared to the previous case.|$|R
50|$|For {{light-duty}} use, {{there are}} also less-expensive punch down tools with <b>fixed</b> <b>blades</b> and no impact mechanism. These low-cost tools are more time-consuming for making reliable connections, and can cause muscle fatigue when used for large numbers of connections.|$|R
