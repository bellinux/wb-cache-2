25|$|Elephants, {{have shown}} unusual {{behavior}} upon encountering {{the remains of}} another deceased elephant. They will often investigate it by touching and grabbing it with their trunks and have the whole herd stand around it {{for long periods of}} time until they must leave it behind. It is unknown whether they are mourning over it and showing sympathy, or are <b>just</b> <b>curious</b> and investigating the dead body. Elephants are thought to be able to discern relatives even from their remains. An episode of the acclaimed BBC Documentary Life on Earth shows this in detail - The elephants, upon finding a dead herd member, pause for several minutes at a time, and carefully touch and hold the dead creature's bones.|$|E
2500|$|The avant-garde {{nature of}} Akita's work made {{acceptance}} by mainstream and unprepared [...] audiences difficult. When he performed with Kiyoshi Mizutani in 1988 at the Jazz-on-Amur festival in Khabarovsk, the Far East of USSR, his improvised, experimental electroacoustic set was praised by fellow musicians {{as well as}} the festival's producer. The number of the - jazz-oriented (and - even <b>just</b> <b>curious)</b> - crowd, however, had been expecting a more traditional (and much-much more quiet) performance, and started walking out. Prior to his second performance at the festival — which was to be made to an even more conservative audience— Akita was asked to play [...] "more musically." [...] On that first stage, Merzbow used the finest example of [...] "classical analogue live noisemaiking technologies" [...] to display: untuned guitar, a drumset, various micro-objects, small springs centered in its shell baffles, large aluminium boxes with strings inside to be attacked with a fiddlestick, etc. along with multi- piezo-pickuping and close-miking techniques, live processing through vintage US fuzz, ring modulator etc. boxes, and quite vivid and spontaneous approach, backed by domestically supplied slide and light shows. These live recordings were post-processed/re-mixed and released as Live in Khabarovsk, CCCP (I'm Proud by Rank of the Workers) LP – and as the (once more re-mixed comparing to the LP) CD 26 of the Merzbox later on.|$|E
