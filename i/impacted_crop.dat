Over the past three decades, the country {{has gone through a}} series of natural calamities marked by droughts and flooding, which negatively <b>impacted</b> <b>crop</b> production and greatly increased concerns over food supply. This vulnerability of the country to climate change has led successive governments and policymakers to seek solutions through various initiatives. As a country whose economy and sociopolitical stability strongly depend on the primary sector – Burkina Faso is a regional powerhouse for cotton production and exports – Burkina Faso has indeed been proactive in tackling environment-related issues within its borders and across the region. These ongoing efforts are far from solving the entire problem, however. Serious material and financial limitations as well as technical and technological handicaps are still preventing the country from fully achieving its set goals...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{examines}} how ownership structure {{and climate change}} issues affect farmers in developing countries in three chapters. The first chapter surveys the theoretical and empirical literature on how ownership structure and industry competitiveness interact. The second chapter examines the role of sugar mill ownership and regulations on farmers in one region of India. The third chapter studies how climate change has affected agricultural yields over a 50 -year period in India, accounting for the role that farmer adaptations may play in mitigating these effects. This thesis finds substantial ownership effects on farmer outcomes, due ultimately to the unexpected ways in which regulatory restrictions affect the incentives of privately-owned firms. It does not find that climate change <b>impacted</b> <b>crop</b> yields {{during the period of}} study, perhaps due to farmer adaptations that mitigated any adverse climate effects...|$|E

The key findings of the analysis are: first, land use intensity has increased significantly over this period, mainly from the widespread adoption of a rice-based Green Revolution technology package beginning in the early 1960 s; second, contrary to expectation, crop diversity too has increased; third, although land productivity has increased significantly, declines in the productivity of fertilizers and pesticides raise doubts over sustaining agricultural growth; fourth, food availability has improved, with a reversal in the dietary energy imbalance in recent years despite a high population growth rate; and finally, the production environment has suffered with widespread soil nutrient depletion experienced in many agroecological regions. The policy implication points towards crop diversification as a desired strategy for agricultural growth to improve resource economy, productivity and efficiency in farming in Bangladesh. © 2010 The Author.

40|$|In {{order to}} assess the {{performance}} of water management procedures and irrigation systems used in the sugar industry in the Lowveld of Zimbabwe, a sugarcane yield and irrigation systems simulation model was developed. The model was used to predict how field derived ‘Irrigation Engineering Performance Indices ’ (IEPIs) of irrigation systems performance, such as the coefficient of uniformity, CU, <b>impacted</b> <b>crop</b> yields and water budgets. This enabled the impacts of the IEPIs on irrigation efficiency and water productivity to be determined in relation to soils, climate, irrigation system type and irrigation scheduling strategy. In this paper {{the development of the}} systems simulation model is described. Results of a verification study of the model showed an index of agreement, ‘d’, of 0. 96 between observed and simulated relative Estimated Recoverable Crystal (ERC) yields. This is very close to a value of 1. 0, which would indicate perfect agreement between observed and simulated relative ERC yields. The root mean squared error was 0. 056, indicating that on average the predicted relative yields were within 6 % of the observed relative yields. The model was prone to slight overestimation of yield declines caused by mild soil water stressing and slight underestimation of the yield declines caused by more severe soil water stressing. The correlation coefficient (Pearson’s r) of 0. 94, nevertheless indicated a very high degree of correspondence between the observed and simulated relative yields.

40|$|A crop can be {{represented}} as a biotechnical system in which components are either chosen (cultivar, management) or given (soil, climate) and whose combination generates highly variable stress patterns and yield responses. Here, we used modeling and simulation to predict the crop phenotypic plasticity resulting from the interaction of plant traits (G), climatic variability (E) and management actions (M). We designed two in silico experiments that compared existing and virtual sunflower cultivars (Helianthus annuus L.) in a target population of cropping environments by simulating a range of indicators of crop performance. Optimization methods were then used to search for GEM combinations that matched desired crop specifications. Computational experiments showed that the fit of particular cultivars in specific environments is gradually increasing {{with the knowledge of}} pedo-climatic conditions. At the regional scale, tuning the choice of cultivar <b>impacted</b> <b>crop</b> performance the same magnitude as the effect of yearly genetic progress made by breeding. When considering virtual genetic material, designed by recombining plant traits, cultivar choice had a greater positive impact on crop performance and stability. Results suggested that breeding for key traits conferring plant plasticity improved cultivar global adaptation capacity whereas increasing genetic diversity allowed to choose cultivars with distinctive traits that were more adapted to specific conditions. Consequently, breeding genetic material that is both plastic and diverse may improve yield stability of agricultural systems exposed to climatic variability. We argue that process-based modeling could help enhancing spatial management of cultivated genetic diversity and could be integrated in functional breeding approache...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Southeastern {{soils are}} {{characterized}} by low organic matter levels and consolidated soil layers that limit root growth. The low productive potential {{of many of these}} soils, coupled with recent poor crop prices and short-term droughts has placed many farmers in an untenable position. Soil-specific conservation systems can improve the profitability of Southeastern farms, mainly by increasing soil water storage and availability to crops during periods of short-term drought common in the region. Cropping and soil management systems are needed that increase soil quality and productive potential of these soils while decreasing inputs and increasing net returns. The objectives of this study were {{to examine the effects of}} non-inversion tillage operations and winter cover crops on soil moisture and crop productivity. Three conservation tillage systems (no-till, strip-till, and paratill) were evaluated in a cotton production system. The tillage was applied in the fall or the spring. Two winter cover crop systems, rye and no cover, were also compared. The cover crop was killed chemically before planting of cash crop and managed with a roller-crimper. Yield, soil moisture, leaf temperature, cover crop biomass, and cover crop chemical analysis data were collected. Results from the first two years of this study indicate that winter cover crops have negatively <b>impacted</b> <b>crop</b> yields, potentially due to Nitrogen availability in the soil. Spring tillage significantly increased cash crop yields. Fall tillage was not significantly different from no-till due to soil reconsolidation. As work continues on this study the results should indicate which tillage an...|$|E
40|$|Climate risk {{assessment}} in cropping is generally undertaken in a top-down approach using climate records while critical farmer experience {{is often not}} accounted for. In the present study, set in south India, farmer experience of climate risk is integrated in a bottom-up participatory approach with climate data analysis. Crop calendars are used as a boundary object to identify and rank climate and weather risks faced by smallhold farmers. A semi-structured survey was conducted with experienced farmers whose income is predominantly from farming. Interviews {{were based on a}} crop calendar to indicate the timing of key weather and climate risks. The simple definition of risk as consequence × likelihood was used to establish the impact on yield as consequence and chance of occurrence in a 10 -year period as likelihood. Farmers’ risk experience matches well with climate records and risk analysis. Farmers’ rankings of ‘good’ and ‘poor’ seasons also matched up well with their independently reported yield data. On average, a ‘good’ season yield was 1 · 5 – 1 · 65 times higher than a ‘poor’ season. The main risks for paddy rice were excess rains at harvesting and flowering and deficit rains at transplanting. For cotton, farmers identified excess rain at harvest, delayed rains at sowing and excess rain at flowering stages as events that <b>impacted</b> <b>crop</b> yield and quality. The {{risk assessment}} elicited from farmers complements climate analysis and provides some indication of thresholds for studies on climate change and seasonal forecasts.

40|$|Optimal {{crop yield}} can be {{achieved}} directly by optimizing farming practices to increase crop growth and indirectly by optimizing pest management to decrease pest pressure. The {{aim of this study}} was to quantify the indirect effect of farming practices on yield through a change of the weed pressure and, thereby, disentangle the effect of farming practices on yield and weeds. Between 2006 and 2012 in Burgundy, France, 152 winter wheat fields were surveyed for weeds and farmers were interviewed about their farming practices and yields. Data were analysed using partial least square path modelling (PLS-PM). A path model that related farming intensity (fallow management, sowing, chemical pest control and fertilization), crop productivity (yield), and weed pressure was designed and validated. It was then used to assess the relationships between the identified variables (beta path coefficients) and compare groups of fields varying in, the preceding crop, herbicide use and weed pressure in the field. Farming intensity had a positive effect on crop productivity (beta = 0. 32). Weed pressure negatively <b>impacted</b> <b>crop</b> productivity (beta = - 0. 12). Farming intensity decreased weed pressure and had a sufficiently negative effect on weeds (beta = - 0. 19) to counteract the negative impact of weeds on crop productivity. Therefore, the indirect effect of farming intensity on crop productivity through a change of weed pressure was positive and accounted for 7 % of the total (direct + indirect) effect of farming intensity on crop productivity. The indirect effect of farming intensity on crop productivity varied by preceding crop (3. 6 % and 23 % with a winter and spring/summer preceding crop, respectively) and herbicide use (14. 1 % and 2. 1 % when herbicide use was less and more than the regional reference, respectively) and weed pressure (0. 5 % and 2. 6 % when the total weed abundance after weeding was less and more than 2 individuals m(- 2), respectively). From the path model, we quantified the direct and indirect effects of farming intensity on crop productivity to show that effective weed management can sustain crop production in cropping systems with reduced herbicide use...|$|E

40|$|Across the world, soil {{organic carbon}} (SOC) is {{decreasing}} due {{to changes in}} land use such as the conversion of natural systems to food or bioenergy production systems. The losses of SOC have <b>impacted</b> <b>crop</b> productivity and other ecosystem services adversely. One of the grand challenges for society is to manage soil carbon stocks to optimize the mix of five essential services – provisioning of food, water and energy; maintaining biodiversity; and regulating climate. Scientific research has helped {{develop an understanding of}} the general SOC dynamics and characteristics; the influence of soil management on SOC; and management practices that can restore SOC and reduce or stop carbon losses from terrestrial ecosystems. As the uptake of these practices has been very limited, it is necessary to identify and overcome barriers to the adoption of practices that enhance SOC. Actions should focus on multiple ecosystem services to optimize efforts and the benefits of SOC. Given that depleting SOC degrades most soil services, we suggest that in the coming decades increases in SOC will concurrently benefit all five of the essential services. The aim of this chapter is to identify and evaluate wide-scale goals for maximizing the benefits of SOC on the five essential services, and to define the short-term steps towards achieving these goals. Stopping the losses of SOC in terrestrial ecosystems is identified as the overall priority. In moving towards the realization of multiple SOC benefits, we need to understand better the relationships between SOC and individual services. Interactions between services occur at multiple spatial scales, from farm through landscape to subnational, national and global scales. Coordinated national and international responses to SOC losses and degradation of the five essential services are needed to empower SOC actions at local levels that have benefits on the larger scales. We propose the creation of a global research programme to expand the scientific understanding of SOC and its contribution to the five essential services. This should address the challenges and uncertainties associated with the management of SOC for multiple benefits. This research programme must include a strong education and outreach component to address concerns to different communities outside academia. Peer Revie...|$|E
40|$|The {{potential}} {{harvest of}} corn stover as a feedstock for biofuels to meet government mandates has {{raised concerns about}} {{the environmental impacts of}} its removal from fields. Furthermore, in order to meet these mandates, larger quantities of stover will be required. As a result, increased attention has been placed on sustainable agronomic practices, such as cover crops. While cover crops may offer desirable benefits, adoption comes at a cost. The objective {{of this study was to}} determine the extent to which cover crop costs could be compensated by additional stover removal and additional agronomic benefits from the use of cover crops. ^ To meet the objective, we estimated cover crop costs and cover crop agronomic benefits and employ a series of benefit-cost analyses, using stochastic analysis in @RISK. Additionally we tested cover crops with stover removal for 24 Indiana farms in a linear programming model, PC-LP. Cover crop costs ranged from 33. 09 /acre to 69. 81 /acre, with variability being driven by differences in the seeding rate and seed cost. Agronomic benefits included reduced erosion, which was calculated using a newly created integrated modeling system. The mean estimated reduced soil erosion with a cover crop and no residue removal was 0. 32 tons/acre. A benefit-cost analysis of cover crop agronomic benefits indicated that from a private perspective (on-site) benefits ranged from 37. 01 /acre to 77. 73 /acre, and 39. 51 /acre to 80. 24 /acre from society 2 ̆ 7 s perspective. These benefits were highly influenced by added or scavenged nitrogen (N) from the cover crop; therefore eliminating added N and retesting the on-site case, benefits ranged from 30. 24 /acre to 54. 48 /acre. Benefit-cost analyses when considering the agronomic benefits of cover crops resulted in a range of a net loss of 4. 49 /acre to a net benefit of 35. 34 /acre for the private perspective, and a net loss of 2. 43 /acre to a net benefit of 37. 85 /acre for the societal perspective. Estimating the additional removable stover with a cover crop also utilized the newly created integrated modeling system. Results indicated, that on average, while holding soil erosion constant, an additional 2 tons/acre of stover could be removed. Accounting for cover crop costs and stover removal, a benefit-cost analysis suggested that at a farm-gate stover price of 60 /ton, net benefits ranged from a loss of 7. 09 /acre to a net benefit of 29. 63 /acre. At a farm-gate stover price of 80 /ton, net benefit ranged from 58. 53 /acre to 95. 24 /acre. Results from PC-LP indicated that cover crops, along with increased stover removal, <b>impacted</b> <b>crop</b> rotations, increased the total amount of stover harvested, and significantly increased farm profits. ...|$|E

Accounting for the endogeneity of insurance investment, this chapter uses a two-step instrumental variables approach {{to assess the impact of}} insurance on yield for two varieties of paddy. The assessment is based on secondary district level data and primary household survey data. The findings indicate that impact of insurance on yield is not homogeneous across crops. It is based on the flexibility of the crop’s input requirement structure. The second chapter explores the <b>impact</b> of <b>crop</b> insurance on the use of inputs such as seeds, fertilizers, pesticides, irrigation and labour for paddy varieties. This chapter is a significant addition to the existing small pool of literature on the <b>impacts</b> of <b>crop</b> insurance on a range of inputs.
