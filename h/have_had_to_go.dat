5|$|Schafer noted at {{the time}} of Grim Fandango {{original}} development, retention of code was not as rigorous as present day standards, and in some cases, Schafer believes the only copies of some files were unintentionally taken by employees when they had left LucasArts. As such, Schafer and his team have been going back through past employee records to try to trace down any of them and ask for any files they may have saved. In other cases, they have had difficulty in identifying elements on the low-resolution artwork of the original game, such as an emblem on one character's hat, and <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> looking for original concept art to figure out the design.|$|E
5|$|The {{writers of}} The Simpsons {{went on strike}} {{together}} with the Writers Guild of America {{at the end of}} 2007. The broadcasting of The Simpsons was not affected by the strike. Since {{it takes a long time}} to produce an episode of an animated show, the episodes are written up to a year in advance. So the strike would <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> on for a while for the show to have run out of new episodes. Production of season 20 was further delayed because of contract negotiations with the six main voice actors. The dispute was resolved, and the actors' salary was raised to $400,000 per episode. The delay in production has caused the planned 22 episodes to be shortened to 20.|$|E
25|$|Banks {{throughout}} Italy {{went through}} many {{changes in the}} late 1800s to early 1900s. One of the Milanese banks, the SBI, had many issues resolving its resources. It did not have support from foreign banks nor enough savings domestically. Other banks during this time in Italy, specifically during the 1907 international crisis, had high liquid assets and would <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> bankrupt without the help from Banca d'Italia. A group of industrialists and bankers from Milan transformed the banking institute Figli di Weil Schott e C. into the Società Bancaria Milanese.|$|E

Until 1990 Belizean bananas <b>had</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> through Puerto Cortés, Honduras, which added to overhead.

5000|$|Compared {{with the}} Zollverein, the UEBL <b>had</b> several {{advantages}} for Luxembourg. Belgium was only allowed to alter its customs tariffs or conclude trade treaties after {{consultation with the}} Luxembourgish government, whereas before 1918 Luxembourg <b>had</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> along with German decisions. Similarly, only Luxembourgish customs agents would operate in Luxembourg, while under the Zollverein Prussian officials <b>had</b> operated in Luxembourg.|$|R
500|$|In October 1998, New York State Attorney General Dennis Vacco filed {{a lawsuit}} {{charging}} {{the directors of the}} foundation behind New York's Apollo Theater, including foundation chair Rangel, with failing to collect more than $4 million owed it by a company controlled by Percy Sutton that produced the television program It's Showtime at the Apollo. [...] The suit sought the removal of Rangel; after months of indecision, Rangel stepped down as chair but remained on the board. [...] In October 1999, new Attorney General Eliot Spitzer dismissed the lawsuit and cleared Rangel and Sutton of any wrongdoing, saying that all monies properly owed had changed hands. [...] Rangel expressed bitterness over the year-long episode, saying [...] "I shouldn't <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> through this." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{earliest}} of Beorhtwulf's coins {{were issued}} in 841–842, {{and can be}} identified {{as the work of}} a Rochester die-cutter who also produced coins early in the reign of Æthelwulf of Wessex. [...] After ten years without any coinage, Beorhtwulf would <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> outside Mercia to find skilled die-cutters, and Rochester was the closest mint. [...] Hence the link to Rochester probably does not indicate that the coins were minted there; {{it is more likely that}} they were produced in London, which was under Mercian control. [...] Subsequent coins of Beorhtwulf's are very similar to Æthelwulf's. [...] One coin combines a portrait of Beorhtwulf on the reverse side with a design used by Æthelwulf on the obverse; this has been interpreted as indicating an alliance between the two kingdoms, but it is more likely to have been the work of a forger or an illiterate moneyer reusing the design of a coin of Æthelwulf's. [...] A different coinage appears later in the 840s, and was probably ended by the Viking attacks of 850–851. [...] There are also coins without portraits that are likely to have been produced at the very end of Beorhtwulf's reign.|$|E
2500|$|Kill Bill {{was planned}} and {{produced}} {{as a single}} film. After shooting ended and editing began, producer Harvey Weinstein, known for pressuring filmmakers to shorten their films, suggested that Tarantino split the film in two. The decision meant Tarantino {{did not have to}} cut scenes, such as the anime sequence. He told IGN: [...] "I'm talking about scenes that {{are some of the best}} scenes in the movie, but in this hurdling pace where you're trying to tell only one story, that would have been the stuff that would <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>go.</b> But to me, that's kind of what the movie was, are these little detours and these little grace notes."

500|$|There was {{speculation}} {{that the effects of}} the Steve Moore incident, which included assault charges and constant media coverage, were negatively affecting his play. While on the road, he was consistently heckled and booed by fans throughout the NHL. Näslund, a close friend of Bertuzzi's, later expressed sympathy for him, saying in a 2008 interview, [...] "It still bothers me what Todd <b>has</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> through...There's no question he was standing up for me...it all went too far." ...|$|R

2500|$|Jackson's remains are interred in the Holly Terrace {{section in}} the Great Mausoleum. The {{mausoleum}} is a secure facility that is not accessible {{to the general public}} or to the media, except on an extremely limited basis. The unmarked crypt, which is partially visible at the tinted entrance of the Holly Terrace mausoleum, is covered in flowers fans leave, which are placed by security guards outside the crypt. The family had considered burying Jackson at Neverland Ranch. However, some family members objected to the site, saying that the ranch had been tainted by the sexual abuse allegations. Also, the owners of the ranch would <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> through a permitting process with county and state government before establishing a cemetery at the site. In July 2010, security was increased at the mausoleum due to vandalism by fans leaving messages such as [...] "Keep the dream alive" [...] and [...] "Miss you sweet angel" [...] in permanent ink.|$|E
2500|$|Eventually, {{however, the}} massive profits of drugs proved irresistible. According to Kevin Weeks, Jimmy, Stevie and I weren't in the import {{business}} and weren't {{bringing in the}} marijuana or the cocaine. We were in the shakedown business. We didn't bring drugs in; we took money off the people who did. We never dealt with the street dealers, but rather with a dozen large-scale drug distributors all over the State who were bringing in the coke and marijuana and paying hundreds of thousands to Jimmy. The dealers {{on the street corner}} sold eight-balls, ...grams, and half grams to customers for their personal use. They were supplied by the mid level drug dealer who was selling them multiple ounces. In other words, the big importers gave it to the major distributors, who sold it to the middlemen, who then sold it to the street dealers. In order to get to Jimmy, Stevie, and me, someone would <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> through those four layers of insulation.|$|E

[...] Madden also reached the milestone of calling the Super Bowl on all of the [...] "Big Four" [...] broadcast networks when he appeared on the 2009 broadcast of Super Bowl XLIII. On October 13, 2008, NBC announced that Madden would not be traveling to the October 19 Sunday Night Football Tampa Bay Buccaneers–Seattle Seahawks game in Tampa, Florida, marking the end of Madden's 476-weekend streak of consecutive broadcast appearances. Madden, who travels by bus because of a fear of flying (see below), decided to take the week off because he had traveled from Jacksonville to San Diego, and would <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> back to Florida before returning to his Northern California home. Madden was replaced by Football Night in America studio analyst Cris Collinsworth for the game, and returned for the following telecast on November 2, 2008 in Indianapolis (until 2011 the NFL did not schedule Sunday night games for one week in October, as not to overlap with the World Series taking place roughly around the same time).|$|E

From 1735, Port Royal once more became the focus of the Admiralty's attention. New wharves and storehouses were built at this time, as well as housing for the officers of the Yard. Over the next thirty years, more facilities were added: cooperages, workshops, sawpits, and accommodation (including a canteen) for the crews of ships being careened there.
