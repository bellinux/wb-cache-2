5|$|Commentators noted McCotter's lack of name {{recognition}} hindered his chances for nomination. When included in Republican presidential preference polls, he regularly received {{less than one}} percent support. Following a last place finish in the Ames Straw Poll and the lack of any invitation to presidential debates, <b>he</b> <b>dropped</b> <b>his</b> candidacy on September 22, 2011, and endorsed Mitt Romney. Thereafter, McCotter reportedly wrote a television pilot, which was released to the media prior to his resignation from Congress in July 2012 amid a fraud investigation surrounding his congressional re-election campaign.|$|E

5|$|In 2006, Gomez {{suffered}} a controversial loss to Peter McDonagh when, {{in the middle}} of a round, <b>he</b> <b>dropped</b> <b>his</b> guard and walked out of the ring, later saying he had retired from boxing. He returned to the ring after a 15-month interval. On 21 June 2008, Gomez lost what was seen as possibly his last bout: a last chance saloon opportunity to resurrect his career against rising star and Olympic silver medallist Amir Khan. Although scoring a surprise knockdown against Khan early on, the fight ended with Gomez being stopped in five rounds.|$|E

5|$|He {{continued}} to dominate sumo in 2005, {{becoming the first}} wrestler ever to win all six honbasho (sumo tournaments) in the same year. The great yokozuna Taihō achieved the feat of six consecutive tournament victories twice, but never in a calendar year. Asashōryū lost only six bouts all year (0–1–0–2–2–1). One of those rare losses came on 11 September 2005, {{at the start of}} the Aki Basho when <b>he</b> <b>dropped</b> <b>his</b> first Shonichi (Day 1) bout during his tenure as yokozuna. On 26 November 2005, a visibly emotional Asashōryū wept after winning his eighty-third bout of the year, (surpassing Kitanoumi's record set in 1978) and clinching the tournament at the same time. The six championships of 2005 (including two more 15–0 wins in January and May) combined with his victory from the final tournament of 2004, meant Asashōryū became the first man in sumo history to win seven consecutive tournament championships.|$|E
5|$|John Mannen (Jack) Lansdale {{was born}} in Oakland, California on 11 June 1912, the son of John Lansdale Sr. and his wife May Hamilton née Mannen. After his sister Sally Mannen Lansdale {{was born in}} 1921 <b>he</b> <b>dropped</b> <b>his</b> middle name and was {{henceforth}} known as John Lansdale Jr. He was educated at San Jacinto High School, from which he graduated in 1929. He entered the Virginia Military Institute, graduating in 1933, and then Harvard Law School, from which he graduated in June 1936. He took {{a job with a}} law firm, Squire, Sanders and Dempsey (now Squire Patton Boggs), initially in Cleveland, Ohio and later in Washington, D.C. He married Metta Virginia Tomlinson in Trinity Episcopal Church in Houston, Texas on 17 June 1936. They had five daughters.|$|E
5|$|In January 2007, Asashōryū {{posted a}} 14–1 record, his fourth {{straight}} championship since returning from injury, {{and became the}} fifth man to win twenty career championships. In March, <b>he</b> <b>dropped</b> <b>his</b> first two bouts but then won thirteen in a row for a 13–2 score. However, this {{was not enough to}} win the title—he lost a playoff {{for the first time in}} his career, to fellow Mongolian Hakuhō. In May he turned in a below par 10–5 record, losing to all four ōzeki and maegashira Aminishiki (although he appeared to be carrying an injury). Hakuhō won this tournament as well and was promoted to yokozuna immediately afterwards. Asashōryū had been the sole yokozuna for a total of 21 tournaments since the retirement of Musashimaru in November 2003 – the longest period of time in sumo history. In July he lost to Aminishiki once again on the opening day but rallied to win the next fourteen bouts, taking his 21st title with a 14–1 record. He was suspended by the Sumo Association from the next two tournaments (see below).|$|E

5|$|When Pietro Cornaro died in 1388, Maria, {{unable to}} defend her possessions, sold them to Venice on 12 December in {{exchange}} for an annual subsidy of 700 ducats. Before the Venetians could arrive {{to take over the}} two towns, however, the Byzantine Despot of the Morea Theodore I Palaiologos, and his ally and father-in-law Nerio I Acciaioli seized them with the aid of an Ottoman army under Evrenos. Although the Venetians were quickly able to oust Nerio from Nauplia, Argos, Kiveri and Thermisi remained in Theodore's hands until 11 June 1394, when he ceded them to Venice. After Maria's death in 1393, her uncle Engelbert—who had originally received the lordship in 1356—claimed her inheritance, but when the Venetians provided the document of sale, and suggested that {{they would be willing to}} cede the castles if he could pay for their defence and reimburse Venice for the costs of their purchase and the ongoing siege of Argos, <b>he</b> <b>dropped</b> <b>his</b> claim. Argos remained in Venetian hands until conquered by the Ottomans at the outbreak of the First Ottoman–Venetian War in 1463, while of all Venetian territories in the Morea, Nauplia persisted longest in her possession, and was surrendered to the Ottomans in 1540 after the conclusion of the Third Ottoman–Venetian War.|$|E
5|$|The {{island is}} ruled {{over by a}} king. His name is Epatiana. He is a large, ignorant-looking boy of about 18 summers, {{and is one of}} the worst rowdies on the island, and there is no power to touch him. The first time we met him he was just landing from an {{excursion}} trip to the island of Rimatara, near by. And you need not be told that I was surprised when told that he was the king of the island; for instead of being dressed in a garb of rich apparel of some kind, with a crown about his head, as I had expected, he had nothing whatever on to indicate his supreme power. His costume was composed of a red breech-clout, a red woolen shirt and upon his bare head an old dried up wreath of faded flowers, such as is worn by all rowdies. When we spoke to him about his island, <b>he</b> <b>dropped</b> <b>his</b> head, as he sat upon the sand, and blushingly answered us. We told him who we were and where we were from, saluted him and left him with very different ideas formed about the king of Rurutu, than we had before meeting him. This was the first monarch of the kind I ever saw, and the first time we were ever under the reign of a king. The island is under the French protection, still it regulates and governs its own affairs, and the French have nothing to say in that respect. The king has judges under him, who make the laws and enforce them while he is in his childhood days.|$|E

25|$|In 2004, a year {{in which}} Kaiō was injury-free, he was runner-up in March, and then won the September tournament {{virtually}} unchallenged after two of his three ōzeki rivals dropped out injured and yokozuna Asashōryū could score only 9–6. He finished on 13–2, two wins ahead of rank-and-filers Tochinonada and Kyokushūzan. In the crucial following tournament in November, <b>he</b> <b>dropped</b> <b>his</b> opening bout to Kotomitsuki and then was surprisingly defeated by newcomer Hakuhō on Day 10 and sekiwake Miyabiyama on Day 12. Although he defeated Asashōryū on the final day to finish runner-up to the yokozuna with twelve wins, it was one win short of the thirteen deemed necessary by the Sumo Association for promotion. Kaiō was set another target of thirteen wins in the following January 2005 tournament, but pulled out with a shoulder injury on the 9th day. This proved to be his final attempt at yokozuna promotion. Due to his injuries he was kadoban (in danger of demotion from ōzeki) a total of thirteen times, a record second only to Chiyotaikai.|$|E
25|$|Prodrive Racing Australia {{carried their}} strong form into the Winton event. Chaz Mostert claimed the opening race, his {{first for the}} season, ahead of his {{teammate}} Mark Winterbottom, while Michael Caruso claimed Nissan Motorsport's first podium finish for the year. Winterbottom won the second race of the weekend, with Rick Kelly scoring another podium for Nissan Motorsport, while Mostert finished in third place after starting from pole. The Holden Racing Team endured a difficult race after James Courtney carried too much speed into the first corner and took his teammate Garth Tander out of the race. Lee Holdsworth, driving a customer Holden Racing Team car, also suffered damage in the incident. Mostert took his fourth consecutive pole position in qualifying for the third race, becoming the first driver to achieve the feat since Winterbottom in 2011.

25|$|From {{that time}} <b>he</b> <b>dropped</b> <b>his</b> first name {{and was always}} known as Stacy Waddy. After acting {{for a short period}} as curate to Bishop Stretch at Newcastle, New South Wales, he was given the {{difficult}} parish of Stockton, New South Wales {{on the other side of}} the harbour, then much overloaded with debt. Waddy tackled his task with enthusiasm, wrote his first book, a short one on confirmation, Come for Strength, published in London in 1904, and by the middle of the same year had succeeded in paying off the parish debts. His energy was boundless, as in this year he wrote various tracts, gave over 40 lantern lecture averaged over six services a Sunday in his own parish, travelling about 30 miles on his bicycle, became bishop's chaplain and secretary of the clerical society, and also managed to fit in some very successful cricket. In December 1903 at West Maitland against Plum Warner's English eleven which included such well-known bowlers as Hurst, Len Braund, Ted Arnold, Bernard Bosanquet and Fielder, he made 93 and 102. Had he accepted the suggestion that he should get a position in Sydney and play cricket, it is likely that he would have gained a place in the New South Wales eleven.|$|E
