5|$|A {{number of}} special paint <b>jobs</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> carried out. In the mid-1990s, SAS started {{a scheme to}} cover MD-80 in single colors {{overlaid}} with small, white aircraft silhouettes, but the project was abandoned after two aircraft. As SAS {{was one of the}} main sponsors of the 1994 Winter Olympics in Lillehammer, it painted one aircraft in a Lillehammer '94 scheme. Similarly a Copenhagen '96 scheme was pained for Copenhagen's term as the European Capital of Culture. Since 2002, SAS has painted selected aircraft in a Star Alliance livery. With the delivery of the A319 in 2006, one aircraft was delivered in a retro Viking scheme.|$|E
5|$|During a {{national}} recession from 2001 to 2003, the city lost 28,000 jobs. In response, a development initiative, Vision 2025, promised to incite {{economic growth and}} recreate lost jobs. Projects spurred by the initiative promised urban revitalization, infrastructure improvement, tourism development, riverfront retail development, and further diversification of the economy. As of 2007, employment levels have surpassed pre-recession heights and the city is in a significant economic development and investment surge. This economic improvement is also seen in Tulsa's housing trends which show an average of a 6% increase in rent in 2010. Since 2006, more than 28,000 <b>jobs</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> added to the city. The unemployment rate of Tulsa in August 2014 was 4.5%.|$|E

Government sources have estimated that over 40,000 <b>jobs</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> created with the set up of QIZs. Investment is currently valued at USD 85100 million and expected to grow to $180 to $200 million.

5|$|One of {{the largest}} {{employers}} is the centrally located supermarket, which as of January 2006 was considering further expansion. It {{is one of the}} major attractions to the town's shopping centre, however there are fears that its expansion could lead it to become too dominant, at the cost of smaller shops in the town. Apart from tourism and retail, many jobs are also provided in the manufacturing industry, mainly located in industrial estates on the outskirts of the town, which produce goods such as kitchen furniture and factory machinery. A high number of construction <b>jobs</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> created by redevelopment of the seafront, which is expected to continue with the proposed regeneration of the town centre. The elderly population of the town has led to many Health and Social Care jobs at local care homes and at the town's Queen Victoria Memorial Hospital. As of the 2001 census, 1.9% of the town's population resided in a medical or care establishment, compared with the national average of only 0.8%.|$|E

25|$|In 2012, Michigan {{became the}} nation's 24th right-to-work state. Prior to passage, Speaker Bolger {{was the sole}} {{legislative}} leader who supported right-to-work when other Michigan Republicans were lukewarm on the idea. The day Bolger was elected Speaker of the Michigan House of Representatives he stated that fellow Republicans should join him in reviewing the potential for right-to-work legislation. During Bolger's term as Speaker, right-to-work legislation was introduced and passed by the House on December 6, 2012. The legislation was eventually signed by Governor Rick Snyder on December 11, 2012.

25|$|Employment {{trends in}} Bogotá {{indicate}} that rates of unemployment have fallen while {{a growing number}} of citizens are looking for work. This paradox can largely be explained by ongoing urbanization into Bogotá, therefore poverty remains a substantial problem. <b>Jobs</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> created in some sectors, and women are gaining more opportunities for employment, but more progress is needed. Overall, poverty since 1970 has decreased; however, data collected and presented in 2006 by UN-HABITAT at the World Urban Forum in Vancouver, Canada reveal that 50% of the population still live in poverty and many of those live in slums. A separate UN-HABITAT report from 2003 describes three types of slums in Bogotá: inner-city, those lying on the perimeter, and squatter settlements. The total number of those living under these conditions is around 700,000. Additional data by UN-HABITAT shows that wealth is very unevenly distributed and that pockets of poverty exist in Bogotá that are poorer than the poorest regions of the country as a whole.|$|E

25|$|Trade {{liberalization}} may shift economic inequality from {{a global}} to a domestic scale. When rich countries trade with poor countries, the low-skilled {{workers in the}} rich countries may see reduced wages {{as a result of}} the competition, while low-skilled workers in the poor countries may see increased wages. Trade economist Paul Krugman estimates that trade liberalisation has had a measurable effect on the rising inequality in the United States. He attributes this trend to increased trade with poor countries and the fragmentation of the means of production, resulting in low skilled jobs becoming more tradeable. However, he concedes that the effect of trade on inequality in America is minor when compared to other causes, such as technological innovation, a view shared by other experts. Empirical economists Max Roser and Jesus Crespo-Cuaresma find support in the data that international trade is increasing income inequality. They empirically confirm the predictions of the Stolper–Samuelson theorem regarding the effects of international trade on the distribution of incomes. Lawrence Katz estimates that trade has only accounted for 5-15% of rising income inequality. Robert Lawrence argues that technological innovation and automation has meant that low-skilled <b>jobs</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> replaced by machine labor in wealthier nations, and that wealthier countries no longer have significant numbers of low-skilled manufacturing workers that could be affected by competition from poor countries.|$|E
