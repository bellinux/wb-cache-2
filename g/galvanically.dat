The network cable is required to be mains-rated, with 600 V isolation {{and at least a}} 1 mm cross-section, with a maximum drop of 2 volts along the cable (max 300 m).

50|$|In {{telecommunication}} {{and data}} storage, Manchester coding (also known as phase encoding, or PE) {{is a line}} code in which the encoding of each data bit is either low then high, or high then low, of equal time. It therefore has no DC bias, and is self-clocking, which means {{that it may be}} inductively or capacitively coupled, and that a clock signal can be recovered from the encoded data. As a result, electrical connections using a Manchester code are easily <b>galvanically</b> isolated using a network isolator—a simple one-to-one isolation transformer.|$|E
50|$|The main {{function}} of an opto-isolator is to block such high voltages and voltage transients, {{so that a}} surge {{in one part of}} the system will not disrupt or destroy the other parts. Historically, this function was delegated to isolation transformers, which use inductive coupling between <b>galvanically</b> isolated input and output sides. Transformers and opto-isolators are the only two classes of electronic devices that offer reinforced protection — they protect both the equipment and the human user operating this equipment. They contain a single physical isolation barrier, but provide protection equivalent to double isolation. Safety, testing and approval of opto-couplers are regulated by national and international standards: IEC 60747-5-2, EN (CENELEC) 60747-5-2, UL 1577, CSA Component Acceptance Notice #5, etc. Opto-isolator specifications published by manufacturers always follow at least one of these regulatory frameworks.|$|E

As the repeater <b>galvanically</b> isolates any two segments, a new power supply must be used {{on the far side of}} the repeater. A common misconception exists concerning the number of repeaters in a network. It has been stated that the maximum length of an AS-Interface network can be 300 m, created by using two repeaters. This is not the case. What matters is not how many repeaters are using but rather how many repeaters any data packet, originating at a Scanner or Gateway, has to cross before reaching the I/O node. Due to the tight timing constraints defined each packet can at most travel across two repeaters before reaching an AS-Interface node. This has the following consequences: ...|$|E
