A crosshead is essential in a double-acting diesel engine (see also: [...] battleships: 12 MAN double-acting 2-stroke 9-cylinder diesels).

The use of flame ignition within the complex slide mechanism extinguishes the flame at every ignition, which is re-ignited by the pilot. This seemingly complex system was quite successful and was used on several early stationary engines.|$|E

50|$|The 1864 Otto & Langen {{engine was}} a free piston {{atmospheric}} engine (the explosion of gas was {{used to create a}} vacuum and the power came from atmospheric pressure returning the piston).

5000|$|Over {{the next}} six years, he {{made a number of}} other {{improvements}} and modifications to the steam engine. A <b>double</b> <b>acting</b> <b>engine,</b> in which the steam acted alternately on {{the two sides of the}} piston was one. He described methods for working the steam [...] "expansively" [...] (i.e., using steam at pressures well above atmospheric). A compound engine, which connected two or more engines was described. Two more patents were granted for these in 1781 and 1782. Numerous other improvements that made for easier manufacture and installation were continually implemented. One of these included the use of the steam indicator which produced an informative plot of the pressure in the cylinder against its volume, which he kept as a trade secret. Another important invention, one which Watt was most proud of, was the parallel motion which was essential in double-acting engines as it produced the straight line motion required for the cylinder rod and pump, from the connected rocking beam, whose end moves in a circular arc. This was patented in 1784. A throttle valve to control the power of the engine, and a centrifugal governor, patented in 1788, to keep it from [...] "running away" [...] were very important. These improvements taken together produced an engine which was up to five times as efficient in its use of fuel as the Newcomen engine.|$|E

The single working space (SWS) model contains the detailed fluid dynamics. It has seven control volumes in which continuity, energy, and pressure loss effects are simulated.

The four working space (FWS) model was built to observe the behaviour of the whole engine. The drive dynamics and vehicle inertia effects are simulated. To reduce calculation time, only three volumes are used in each working space and the gas temperature are fixed (no energy equation). Comparison of the FWS model predicted power with experimental data shows reasonable agreement. Since all four working spaces are simulated, the unique capabilities of the model are exercised to look at working fluid supply transients, short circuit transients, and piston ring leakage effects...|$|R
