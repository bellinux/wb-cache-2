In the 1880s pioneering <b>fish</b> <b>farmer</b> Seth Green advocated the stocking of rainbow trout in streams where the brook trout population was beginning to thin {{as a result of the}} fishing pressure, as they could handle warmer water better.

40|$|The study {{assessed}} {{the adoption of}} improved aquaculture technologies among <b>fish</b> <b>farmers</b> in Lagos State, Nigeria. A total of 90 <b>fish</b> <b>farmers</b> were sampled through the multistage sampling technique. A validated and pretested interview schedule was used to obtain primary information from the <b>fish</b> <b>farmers.</b> Obtained {{data were analyzed using}} descriptive and inferential statistics. Results obtained revealed that more than half and about one-third of the <b>fish</b> <b>farmers</b> sourced credit facilities from cooperative societies and Esusu, respectively, while almost all sold their fishes as smoked fish. Higher proportions of the <b>fish</b> <b>farmers</b> were aware, tried and adopted most of the improved aquaculture technologies with some of the <b>fish</b> <b>farmers</b> also discontinuing most of the previously adopted technologies. The findings of the study also reported that the <b>fish</b> <b>farmers</b> had positive attitude towards the adoption of improved aquaculture technologies. Results of regression analysis revealed that secondary occupation of the <b>fish</b> <b>farmers</b> (β=− 0. 324, p< 0. 01), annual income level (β=− 0. 471, p< 0. 05), cost of pond construction (β= 0. 477, p< 0. 05) and total profit realized (β=− 0. 466, p< 0. 05) were significant predictors of the adoption of improved technologies by the <b>fish</b> <b>farmers</b> with an R 2 implying that 46. 0 % of the variability in the fish farmers’ adoption of improved aquaculture technologies is explained by the socio-economic and production characteristics of the <b>fish</b> <b>farmers.</b> The study concluded that the adoption of improved aquaculture technologies is dynamic and highly influenced by the socio-economic characteristics of the <b>fish</b> <b>farmers</b> which also change with time. It is therefore recommended that technologies that received low level of adoption or which discontinued after earlier adoption should be worked on so that the adoption of those technologies would translate to increased income level of <b>fish</b> <b>farmers,</b> reduced cost of pond construction and increased profit of the <b>fish</b> <b>farmers...</b>|$|R

40|$|Abstract: This paper {{focused on}} the extent of {{adoption}} of aquaculture technology introduced to <b>fish</b> <b>farmers</b> in Lagos State, Nigeria. Researchers have developed technology packages and disseminated it to the <b>fish</b> <b>farmers</b> through extension agents so as to improve aquaculture in Nigeria. The package included nine practices that <b>fish</b> <b>farmers</b> were expected to adopt. Data were collected from <b>fish</b> <b>farmers</b> through structured interview scheduled. Frequency counts and percentages were used as descriptive method of analyzing the data. Results showed that <b>fish</b> <b>farmers</b> adopted mainly three aquaculture technologies introduced by extension agents. These include pond fertilization (89. 8 %), water quality management (81. 9 %) and weed control (81. 9 %). Reasons for non-adoption of technologies include fund (99. 1 %), effect of the technology (60. 0 %), skill/manpower (59. 0 %). To increase the level of adoption of aquaculture technologies in Nigeria, it is necessary to provide <b>fish</b> <b>farmers</b> with credit facilities. Also, extension agents should be provided with motorcycles to enable them visit <b>fish</b> <b>farmers</b> more frequently to provide skill and encourage them to adopt technologies introduced to them...|$|R

A random sampling technique was adopted in selecting 120 <b>fish</b> <b>farmers</b> from <b>fish</b> <b>farmers</b> association of Nigeria Ilorin branch list. The data for the study were collected {{with the use of}} well structured questionnaire. The result showed the <b>fish</b> <b>farmers</b> were relatively technically efficient in their use of resources, with a mean technical inefficiency of 40 %. The result also showed that 73 % of the <b>fish</b> <b>farmers</b> exhibited increasing returns to scale. On the average; numbers of fingerlings, feeds and labour had slacks of 0. 0, 6. 5 and 0. 4 respectively. These imply that inputs could be decreased by those units and still produce the same level of output. Thus, the <b>fish</b> <b>farmers</b> are said to be inefficient in input usage by the said values. It was concluded that though average cost is expected to decrease as output increases there is still room for improvement in productivity of fish farms. With this high level of returns to scale in fish farming, it is recommended that this information should be spread to all the farmers in the study area and other surrounding communities...|$|R
