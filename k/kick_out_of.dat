5|$|The fourth match (which {{received}} a pre-match endorsement from Stephanie McMahon) featured Paige retaining her NXT Women's Championship over Emma. Paige managed to prevent Emma from applying her Emma Lock submission hold during the match and also withstood several other holds applied by Emma. When Paige attempted a superplex, Emma countered with a sitout powerbomb on Paige, {{but it was}} not enough to secure a win. A frustrated Emma slapped Paige, who retaliated with her signature Paige Turner. Yet, Emma became the first person to <b>kick</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the Paige Turner. Paige responded by applying the Paige Tapout submission hold, which was enough for the victory when Emma submitted. Paige embraced Emma after the match.|$|E
5|$|As {{in falls}} one and two, Guerrero and Hijo del Santo started out against each other. At one point, Guerrero applied Hijo del Santo's own {{submission}} hold, La de a Caballo (camel clutch), {{on him to}} mock his opponent, but {{was not able to}} make Hijo del Santo submit before Octagón saved his partner. Later in the fall, with the referee distracted, Barr was able to surprise Octagón and execute a kneeling reverse piledriver, a move that would have been an automatic disqualification in Lucha Libre. Moments later, Barr was able to pin Octagón to eliminate him from the match. In Lucha Libre, the piledriver is treated as a very dangerous move, something that was sold during this match by Octagón being taken from the arena on a stretcher during the closing moments of the third fall. Minutes later, Hijo del Santo was actually able to <b>kick</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the Superplex/Frog Splash combo by La Pareja del Terror. At one point, both Hijo del Santo and Guerrero were on the floor, which distracted the referee long enough for Blue Panther to enter the ring and perform a piledriver of his own on Barr in retaliation for what was done to Octagón. The move was not seen by the referee but allowed Hijo del Santo to pin Barr, leaving just Hijo del Santo and Guerrero still in the match. A minute or two later, Hijo del Santo was able to roll up Guerrero for the final pinfall and the victory for his team. Following their loss, both Guerrero and Barr visibly cried in the ring, selling the severeness of the loss as they cut off each other's hair with a pair of scissors. This was followed by an AAA official shaving off the rest of their hair with electric clippers backstage.|$|E
25|$|The main feud {{heading into}} Unforgiven was between Triple H and Goldberg over the World Heavyweight Championship. One month prior at SummerSlam, Triple H won an Elimination Chamber match {{to retain the}} World Heavyweight Championship by last {{eliminating}} Goldberg. After the match ended, Triple H, along with Evolution members Ric Flair and Randy Orton, handcuffed Goldberg to the Chamber and attacked him with a sledgehammer. The next night on Raw, Goldberg challenged Triple H to a match later that night. Triple H declined {{and said that they}} would face off at Unforgiven instead. Triple H then added the stipulation that if he won, Goldberg would have to retire from professional wrestling. On the September 1 episode of Raw, Goldberg, Shawn Michaels, and Maven defeated Evolution (Triple H, Randy Orton, and Ric Flair). Towards the end of the match, Orton attacked Goldberg from behind as he was preparing to spear Triple H. Goldberg was able to <b>kick</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the pinfall attempt and hit Orton with a Jackhammer for the win. The next week on Raw, Co-General Manager Steve Austin added the stipulation where if Triple H got himself counted out or intentionally disqualified, he would lose the World Heavyweight Championship.|$|E

25|$|The sixth {{match was}} a {{standard}} {{match for the}} NWA World Television Championship. Sting defended the title against The Great Muta. Sting started the ring by flying over the ropes onto Muta in the second ring. Muta's manager Gary Hart distracted Sting, allowing Muta to deliver a Judo Chop. Muta tried to deliver a Moonsault for the victory but Sting {{moved out of the}} way. Muta started dominating the match but Sting delivered a Clothesline to gain advantage. Sting dropkicked Muta down and the two continued to exchange momentum and moves. The match started to change when Muta tried to deliver a Red Mist to Sting but Sting moved out and the referee Nick Patrick was hit with it. Sting attacked Muta and tried to deliver a Stinger Splash but Muta avoided it and delivered a Moonsault. Tommy Young replaced Nick Patrick as the referee and entered the ring to count the pinfall for Muta but Sting kicked out at 2 and became the first wrestler to <b>kick</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> Moonsault. Muta tried to deliver a Spin Kick but Sting countered it and delivered him a Belly To Back Suplex to win the match and retain the title. However, controversy surrounded the match as both men had their shoulders up at two count. The referees argued over it and Muta stole the title belt.|$|E
500|$|Perry {{thoroughly}} enjoyed {{what he was}} doing, {{saying in}} a 1989 interview, [...] "I got a <b>kick</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> live television. The spontaneity was the fun of it." [...] Spontaneity {{and the ability to}} be himself came in handy for swimmer/actress Esther Williams' guest appearance of March 16, 1957. A wardrobe malfunction meant that viewers were seeing more of Esther than 1950s television considered to be in good taste; more live show mishaps followed. At the show's end, Williams was swimming in a pool specially constructed on the set for her appearance. Como simply said, [...] "Goodnight, folks," [...] and leaped, fully clothed, into the swimming pool.|$|E
500|$|Eventually, {{the team}} became {{competitive}} again under head coach Leo Cahill {{in the late}} 1960s. They scored a coup over the National Football League (NFL) with the signing of a young Joe Theismann (and other American stars) in 1971. The team also saw an attendance bounce, consistently selling out Exhibition Stadium. The Boatmen's best chance to end their Grey Cup drought came that year, when they faced the Calgary Stampeders in the 59th Grey Cup, {{the first to be}} played on artificial turf. In a defensive struggle at Vancouver's soggy Empire Stadium, a now infamous late fumble by Leon [...] "X-Ray" [...] McQuay and a possession changing <b>kick</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> bounds by Harry Abofs sealed a 14–11 Stampeder victory.|$|E

500|$|The Sci-Fi Dine-In has {{received}} mixed reviews. Jack Hayes of Nation's Restaurant News calls the Sci-Fi Dine-In [...] "wacky" [...] and [...] "on {{the cutting edge}} of sheer dining fun". In USA Todays list of the sixteen best restaurants in American amusement parks, the Sci-Fi Dine-In ranks fifteenth. Samuel Muston of The Independent writes that the Sci-Fi Dine-In is [...] "memorable in the best way". In the Evansville Courier & Press, Pete DiPrimio writes that the Sci-Fi Dine-In ranks among the most unusual of the restaurants at Disney's Hollywood Studios. In The Unofficial Guide to Walt Disney World 2015, Bob Sehlinger and Len Testa call the Sci-Fi Dine-In the most entertaining restaurant in Walt Disney World, writing that [...] "everyone gets a <b>kick</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> this unusual dining room".|$|E
500|$|Douglass {{was one of}} {{the final}} five players cut during {{training}} camp by the Bears at the beginning of September, but they re-signed him in late November when they put Jim McMahon on injured reserve. [...] He did not play much in 1986, but was described as a favorite of coach Mike Ditka by the Chicago Sun-Times. [...] Chicago Tribune writers noted that Ditka got a <b>kick</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> his big earring and fashion sense. [...] In the 1987–88 NFL playoffs, although had only one previous start in his two-year career, he started for the Bears in place of five-year veteran Mike Richardson at left cornerback against the Redskins in their January 10, 1988 Divisional playoff game. [...] The following season, when Shaun Gayle suffered a season-ending injury for the 1988 Bears, he took over the starting free safety assignment.|$|E
500|$|Bond 25 began {{development}} in early 2016; Mendes stated {{he would not}} be the film's director. In October 2016, Craig stated that he may indeed return for another film, saying, [...] "As far as I'm concerned, I've got the best job in the world. I'll keep doing it as long as I still get a <b>kick</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> it. If I were to stop doing it, I would miss it terribly." [...] Sony Pictures's contract to co-produce the series with MGM and Eon expired with the release of Spectre and the distribution rights to release Bond 25 in cinemas were put up for negotiation, with MGM and Eon only offering a one-film contract. In July 2017 it was announced that the film would be released on 8 November 2019. In August 2017 Craig confirmed that he would reprise his role as Bond.|$|E

500|$|In {{addition}} to Borland's visual appearance, the band has also used elaborate stage setups in their performances. Their Ladies Night in Cambodia club tour visually {{paid tribute to}} the film Apocalypse Now, with an elaborate stage setup which featured an empty Jeep, camouflage mesh and palm trees. During the band's tour with Primus, Limp Bizkit took inspiration from Primus' trademark self-deprecatory slogan [...] "Primus sucks": Durst, Borland, Rivers, Otto and Lethal took the stage with middle fingers raised. According to Borland, [...] "they finger us back—and {{you know what that}} means to us—that they love us. It's kind of like saying something is bad when you really mean good.

David Edelstein of New York Magazine wrote, [...] "It doesn't {{come close to the}} emotional heft of those two rare 2s that outclassed their ones: Superman II and Spider-Man 2. But Iron Man 2 hums along quite nicely". Roger Ebert gave it 3 stars out of 4, stating that [...] "Iron Man 2 is a polished, high-octane sequel, not as good as the original but building once again on a quirky performance by Robert Downey Jr". Frank Lovece of Film Journal International, a one-time Marvel Comics writer, said that, [...] "In a refreshing and unexpected turn, the sequel to Iron Man doesn't find a changed man. Inside the metal, imperfect humanity grows even more so, as thought-provoking questions of identity meet techno-fantasy made flesh." ...|$|E

Stephen Thomas Erlewine from AllMusic said that the decision to include [...] "Nature Boy" [...] in A New Day Has Come was inspired by the song's appearance in Baz Luhrmann's musical, Moulin Rouge! (2001). With Billboard, Dion expressed her feelings while recording the track: [...] "This is the one I had the most <b>kick</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> in the studio. I could hear the pedal of the piano and the touch of the keys while I was singing. We were following each other, this is the real thing. This was such my pleasure." [...] Initially strings and other instrumentation were added in post-production, but were later removed to maintain the simplicity of Cole's version.|$|E

500|$|Turner made a 26-yard {{field goal}} {{to break the}} tie and give the Jets a three-point lead with {{a little over a}} minute {{remaining}} in the game. Turner kicked the ball off to the Raiders' Smith, who took the <b>kick</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the end zone and to Oakland's own 22-yard line. Lamonica completed to Smith for an apparent touchdown, but the play was called back due to a penalty, causing New York cornerback Johnny Sample to say to Lamonica, [...] "Nice try, Lamonica. Better luck next year." [...] On first down, Smith caught a 20-yard reception from Lamonica, while a 15-yard penalty was assessed against the Jets when a player grabbed Smith's facemask, moving the ball to the Jets' 43-yard line. On the ensuing play, Lamonica threw another pass to Smith who outpaced Jets safety Mike D'Amato, who replaced the ejected Jim Hudson, for a 43-yard touchdown. Kicker George Blanda made the extra point attempt which gave the Raiders a 36–32 lead.|$|E
500|$|Sam McPherson of Zap2it {{said that}} he [...] "enjoyed 'A Christmas Carol' more than I have almost any other special that has aired since the series {{restarted}} in 2005", but thought that [...] "some parts were absolutely silly, and others were absolutely incoherent" [...] due to the frantic pace. While he considered Amy and Rory [...] "criminally underused", they were responsible for [...] "heavy laughs" [...] and left the Doctor to be the [...] "delight of the episode". The Daily Telegraph Chris Harvey was less enthusiastic about the episode, saying that it [...] "started nicely", but that [...] "by {{the time she was}} singing to the shark, I'd had enough," [...] while thinking that, [...] "It's not really for old curmudgeons like me, who got more of a <b>kick</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> Michael Gambon's miserly Kazran Sardick when he was sneering and snarling {{at the beginning of the}} episode than when he had been thoroughly heartwarmed by the end." ...|$|E
500|$|Due to {{the nature}} of Michael's film, Novak {{realized}} that scenes would have to be filmed {{as if they had been}} shot years prior to the episode.

Novak later elaborated on the continuity during an interview with The Office fansite OfficeTally. The scene featuring [...] "The Scarn" [...] would have been filmed after the corporate merger that occurred during the third season; this would explain Karen's willingness to deliver her lines, as she would be [...] "eager to fit in". Stanley's voiceover was recorded [...] "on a lunch break" [...] sometime after the fourth season episode [...] "Local Ad" [...] because he had [...] "got a big <b>kick</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> seeing himself" [...] in Michael's commercial. Helene's scenes were filmed sometime when Michael was dating her during the early part of the sixth season.|$|E

Between 1933 and 1941 Terry-Thomas appeared in 16films, as an uncredited extra in all but one; he later said that [...] "this work suited me down to the ground. It wasn't really like work to me.

Jason Bovberg of the DVD Talk wrote that the season release is [...] "recommended." [...] He said [...] "Let me state up front that I adore this show.

500|$|In {{subsequent}} {{sessions in}} May and November 1953, Sinatra and Riddle developed and refined their musical collaboration, with Sinatra providing specific guidance on the arrangements.

That same month, Sinatra and Doris Day released the single [...] "Young at Heart", which reached #2 and was awarded Song of the Year. In March, he recorded and released the single [...] "Three Coins in the Fountain", a [...] "powerful ballad" [...] that reached #4. Sinatra's second album with Riddle, Swing Easy!, which reflected his [...] "love for the jazz idiom" [...] according to Granata, was released on August 2 of that year and included [...] "Just One of Those Things", [...] "Taking a Chance on Love", [...] "Get Happy", and [...] "All of Me". Swing Easy! was named Album of the Year by Billboard, {{and he was also}} named [...] "Favorite Male Vocalist" [...] by Billboard, Down Beat, and Metronome that year. Sinatra came to consider Riddle [...] "the greatest arranger in the world", and Riddle, who considered Sinatra [...] "a perfectionist", offered equal praise of the singer, observing, [...] "It's not only that his intuitions as to tempi, phrasing, and even configuration are amazingly right, but his taste is so impeccable... there is still no one who can approach him." ...|$|E
