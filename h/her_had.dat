5|$|The actual Burnt Norton is a manor {{located near}} the village of Aston Subedge in Gloucestershire that Eliot visited with Emily Hale during 1934. The {{original}} Norton House was a mansion burned down in 1741 by its owner, Sir William Keyt, who died in the fire. Even though Eliot was married, {{he spent a lot of}} time with Hale and might possibly have become involved with <b>her</b> <b>had</b> he not been married. Even after their time at Burnt Norton, Eliot stayed in close correspondence with her and sent her many of his poems. The actual manor does not serve as an important location within the poem. Instead, it is the garden surrounding the manor that became the focus.|$|E
5|$|July 9, 1861 {{was a hot}} day, and Fanny {{was putting}} locks of her children's hair into an {{envelope}} and attempting to seal it with hot sealing wax while Longfellow took a nap. Her dress suddenly caught fire, though it is unclear exactly how; burning wax or a lighted candle may have fallen onto it. Longfellow was awakened from his nap and rushed to help her, throwing a rug over her, though it was too small. He stifled the flames with his body as best he could, but she was already badly burned. Over half a century later, Longfellow's youngest daughter Annie explained the story differently, claiming {{that there had been}} no candle or wax but that the fire had started from a self-lighting match that had fallen on the floor. Both accounts state that Fanny was taken to her room to recover and a doctor was called. She {{was in and out of}} consciousness throughout the night and was administered ether. She died shortly after 10:00 the next morning, July 10, after requesting a cup of coffee. Longfellow, in trying to save <b>her,</b> <b>had</b> burned himself badly enough so that he was unable to attend her funeral. His facial injuries led him to stop shaving, and he wore a beard from then on that became his trademark.|$|E
5|$|The {{silencer}} {{played a}} central role. It was deemed to {{have been on the}} rifle when it was fired, because of the blood found inside it. The prosecution said the blood had come from Sheila's head when the silencer was pointed at <b>her.</b> <b>Had</b> she discovered that she could not shoot herself with the silencer attached, the court heard, it would have been found next to her body; she had no reason to return it to the gun cupboard. That she had carried out the killings was further discounted because, it was argued, she had not recently expressed suicidal thoughts; the expert evidence was that she would not have harmed her children or father; she had no interest in or knowledge of guns; she lacked the strength to overcome her father; and there was no evidence on her clothes or body that she had moved around the crime scene or been involved in a struggle. In particular, her long fingernails had remained intact.|$|E

25|$|When the UK {{entered the}} First World War in 1914 the Admiralty requisitioned <b>her,</b> <b>had</b> her re-fitted as an armed {{merchant}} cruiser and commissioned her as HMS Viknor.

25|$|Franchise was in {{ordinary}} at Woolwich in 1815. She {{was put up}} for sale at Deptford in January of that year. Anyone wishing to purchase <b>her</b> <b>had</b> {{to put up a}} bond of two sureties, for Â£3000, not to sell or otherwise dispose of the ship. To regain their sureties the purchaser had to break her up within twelve months from the day of sale.|$|E

25|$|Coffey's opinion {{considered}} three issues: {{whether the}} district court had properly found Churchill's criticisms of Waters, Davis and cross-training did not touch on {{a matter of public}} concern, whether the appellants' failure to determine that before firing <b>her</b> <b>had</b> been a due process violation and whether they were entitled to qualified immunity from the suit since they argued there was no settled law on the subject. To resolve the first issue, he turned to the relevant case law on the subject.|$|E
25|$|He married Anne (or {{possibly}} Agnes), {{who died}} in 1620, and by <b>her</b> <b>had</b> five children, of whom only one, Elizabeth, survived them. He spent his entire adult life in Holborn, London, close to Barnards Inn, between Chancery Lane and Fetter Lane. It is thought that he resided in a tenement with garden belonging to Lord Burghley. After his death in February 1612 he was buried at St Andrews, Holborn on February 18, but the grave is unmarked.|$|E
25|$|On 10 April 2008, it was {{announced}} that attempts to refloat <b>her</b> <b>had</b> been abandoned and that she was to be scrapped in situ. The contract to dismantle her was awarded to Hancock's Contractors, of Heysham. The work was expected to take about 12 to 14 weeks. One {{of the reasons for the}} decision was that Riverdance had suffered further structural damage during the storms on 12 March. The damage included damaged propellors and engine, loss of a rudder, the bulwarks destroyed on her starboard side and a lifeboat destroyed.|$|E

25|$|On 30 August 2014 Collins {{resigned}} her Cabinet positions {{following the}} leak of another e-mail written by Slater in 2011 which suggested {{she had also}} attempted to undermine another public servant, Adam Feeley. Feeley was Director of the Serious Fraud Office (SFO) and Collins was the Minister responsible for the SFO at the time. Collins says she resigned because she believed the attacks on <b>her</b> <b>had</b> become a distraction for the National party {{leading up to the}} election. She called for an inquiry so she can clear her name.|$|E
25|$|Both Moore and Bonie {{had been}} having legal {{difficulties}} at the time. Three of Moore's four children, who lived with <b>her,</b> <b>had</b> {{been removed from the}} house earlier in the year and placed in foster care by the city's Administration for Children's Services (ACS). They had investigated and confirmed reports that the children had been neglected, missing school and staying at home by themselves during some of Moore's frequent absences. Moore did not have a job but was hoping to have at least her eldest child, her daughter Rashina, move back in later in the summer after the mother completed required programs.|$|E
25|$|After {{receiving}} {{a phone call}} from Knox, Romanelli arrived at the flat. Candace Dempsey writes that in rummaging around, looking for anything that might be missing, Romanelli inadvertently disturbed the crime scene. On discovering that the two phones Kercher typically carried with <b>her</b> <b>had</b> been found in a nearby garden, Romanelli became concerned and requested that the police force open the door to Kercher's bedroom, but the police declined. Instead, Romanelli's male friend forced the door open at around 1:15p.m., and the body of Kercher was found inside, lying on the floor, covered by a duvet.|$|E

25|$|At {{the time}} of Peter III's overthrow, other {{potential}} rival claimants to the throne existed: Ivan VI (1740â1764), in close confinement at SchlÃ¼sselburg, in Lake Ladoga, {{from the age of}} six months; and Yelizaveta Alekseyevna Tarakanova (1753â1775). Ivan VI was assassinated during an attempt to free him as part of a failed coup against Catherine: Catherine, like Empress Elizabeth before <b>her,</b> <b>had</b> given strict instructions that he was to be killed in the event of any such attempt. Ivan was thought to be insane because of his years of solitary confinement, so might have made a poor emperor, even as a figurehead.|$|E
25|$|HMS Flirt was {{launched}} in 1782 but was completed too late to see any significant service in the American War of Independence. She then {{spent most of the}} years of peace in British waters. She sailed to Jamaica in 1791, but was laid up in Deptford in November 1792, and did not return to service before being sold in 1795. Daniel Bennett purchased <b>her,</b> <b>had</b> her almost rebuilt, and then employed her as a whaler in the South seas Fisheries. A French privateer captured her in 1803 as Flirt was returning to Britain from a whaling voyage.|$|E
25|$|Asked {{about the}} {{more than a dozen}} {{abducted}} whites expected to be available for release, Matilda informed the Texians that she knew only about a Mrs. Webster and her two children (who, unknown to <b>her,</b> <b>had</b> just made their escape) and that the Comanche chiefs had decided to ransom them. The Texians believed this was against the conditions for the negotiations which they believed stated that all abducted whites had to be released before the council. The Comanche, of course, had a different view, since the chiefs and bands not in attendance were under no obligation to release anyone, as they had never agreed to anything.|$|E
