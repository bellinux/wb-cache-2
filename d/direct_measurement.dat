The model average distribution curve established by such an analysis departs significantly from that predicted by the (uncertain) extrapolation of results from meteor observations. A consequence of this difference is that the daily accretion of interplanetary particulate matter by the earth is now considered to be mainly dust particles of the <b>direct</b> <b>measurements</b> range of particle size. Almost all the available <b>direct</b> <b>measurements</b> obtained with microphone systems on rockets, satellites, and spacecraft fit directly on the distribution curve defined by Explorer VIII data.

5|$|The first <b>direct</b> <b>measurement</b> of the {{distance}} to a star (61 Cygni at 11.4 light-years) was made in 1838 by Friedrich Bessel using the parallax technique.

In 1834, Friedrich Bessel observed changes in the proper motion of the star Sirius and inferred a hidden companion. Edward Pickering discovered the first spectroscopic binary in 1899 when he observed the periodic splitting of the spectral lines of the star Mizar in a 104-day period. Detailed observations of many binary star systems were collected by astronomers such as Friedrich Georg Wilhelm von Struve and S. W.

The first {{solution to the problem of}} deriving an orbit of binary stars from telescope observations was made by Felix Savary in 1827.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{determination}} of rate parameters of gas-phase elementary reactions is usually based on <b>direct</b> <b>measurements.</b> The rate parameters obtained in many independent <b>direct</b> <b>measurements</b> are then used in reaction mechanisms, which are tested against {{the results of}} indirect experiments, like time-to-ignition or laminar flame velocitymeasurements. We suggest a new approach {{that takes into account}} both <b>direct</b> and indirect <b>measurements</b> and optimizes all influential rate parameters. First, the domain of feasibility of the Arrhenius parameters is determined from all of the available <b>direct</b> <b>measurements.</b> Thereafter, the optimal Arrhe-nius parameters are sought within this domain to reproduce the selected <b>direct</b> and indirect <b>measurements.</b> Other parameters of a complex mechanism (third-body efficiencies, enthalpies of formation, parameters of pressure dependence, etc.) can also be taken into account in a similar way. A new fitting algorithm and a new method for error calculation were developed to determine the optimal mean values and the covariance matrix of all parameters. The ap-proach is demonstrated on the calculation of Arrhenius parameters of reactions (R 1) : H+O 2 = OH + O and (R 2) : H + O 2 + M = HO 2 + M (low-pressure limit, M = N 2 or Ar).

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to compare the {{efficiency}} of conventional and digital panoramic images for localization of mental and mandibular foramens. Six dry edentulous human mandibles were used in the study. Conventional and digital panoramic images were obtained and the vertical and horizontal measurements were performed for localization of mental and mandibular foramens on the images. The correlations between radiographic (conventional and digital) and <b>direct</b> <b>measurements</b> were compared. A measurement error between the radiographic and <b>direct</b> <b>measurements</b> was determined at the level of 1 mm. The measurement errors were generally less in conventional panoramic radiography than digital one. There was statistically strong positive correlation between <b>direct</b> and radiographic <b>measurements.</b> Statistically significant difference was found between radiographic and <b>direct</b> <b>measurements</b> for bone height of mandible in ramus region. According to the results of this study, diagnostic performance of conventional and digital panoramic images seems to be equal for the localization of mental and mandibular foramens.

Any such direct detection is complicated by the extraordinarily small effect the waves would produce on a detector. The amplitude of a spherical wave will fall off as the inverse of the distance from the source (the 1/R term in the formulas for h above). Thus, even waves from extreme systems like merging binary black holes die out to very small amplitudes by the time they reach the Earth. Astrophysicists expect that some gravitational waves passing the Earth may be as large as h ≈ 10−20, but generally no bigger.|$|E

The proposed model is based on the introduction of a new conductivity parameter, , that is related to the coefficient of variation of the WRF. The model is calibrated on 20 soil samples and subsequently tested on an independent data set of 57 samples. The predictions show relatively high accuracy and reliability when compared to those derived from Mualem’s model...|$|R
