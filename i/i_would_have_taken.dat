At {{the end of the}} first fifteen minutes, after having given a simple idea of the human form to the block of clay, he produced by the action of his thumb a bust so living that <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>taken</b> it away with me to relieve the sculptor of any further work." ...|$|E

[...] "We didn't do any {{revisions}} or ask for any changes, like we were expecting to... It was a different approach than <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>taken,</b> and that's what was refreshing about it. That's why we wanted to get somebody else to do some vocals on the album."

5000|$|While Napoleon was exiled on St. Helena, he recollected that Phélippeaux had a {{tremendous}} impact on his life. “Without him, <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>taken</b> the Key to the Orient, <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> marched on Constantinople, <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> rebuilt the throne of the Orient.” Phélippeaux died not long after his victory in St. Jean d’Acre in 1799, either of exhaustion or the plague. Sir William Sidney Smith wrote of Phélippeaux’s death, “Col. Phélippeaux, the engineer, has fallen as a sacrifice for this service; want of rest and exposure to the sun having given him a fever of which he has died.” ...|$|R
6000|$|Horatia turned aside with a good-natured 'Poor child! {{she will}} soon wish herself back.' Lucilla, taking her last glance, sighed as she thought, 'My {{father did not}} like them. But for Honor, <b>I</b> <b>would</b> never <b>have</b> <b>taken</b> up with them.' ...|$|R

6000|$|... "I {{would set}} him up for a mark, if I had him," [...] said Jim. [...] "I wish I had been there when you found him; <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>taken</b> him away from you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No; {{they had}} to borrow money six years ago when Uncle Tom had his first spell of rheumatic fever. This spring {{it was clear that}} there was nothing for them but the poorhouse. They went three months ago and terrible hard they took it, {{especially}} Aunt Sally, I felt awful about it myself. Jonah and <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>took</b> them if we could, but we just couldn't--we've nothing but Jonah's wages and we have eight children and not a bit of spare room. I go over to see Aunt Sally as often as I can and take her some little thing, but I dunno's she wouldn't rather not see anybody than see them in the poorhouse." ...|$|R

60|$|This swift leaping {{to grasp}} an {{opportunity}} was characteristically American, and <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> gladly <b>taken</b> {{part in the}} play, but alas! my Grant history was still unfinished, and I had already overstayed my vacation limit. I should have returned at once, but my friend Babcock was expecting me to visit him, and this I did.|$|R
6000|$|My fortune was made. <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>taken</b> {{him up in}} a minute, but I couldn't stop an eclipse; {{the thing}} {{was out of the}} question. So I asked time to consider. The king said: ...|$|E
6000|$|... "If {{one of my}} guns {{had touched}} you, you {{would have gone to}} the bottom, all of you. <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>taken</b> the risk with my Government. By that time it would have been -" ...|$|E
60|$|There {{seemed to}} be no help for it, so I walked along with them. Had there been the {{slightest}} chance offered to escape <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>taken</b> it, but warned by experience, all six kept close watch over me.|$|E
6000|$|... "John," [...] said Jess, {{as soon as}} {{the door}} had closed, [...] "I am afraid of that man. If I had {{understood}} that he {{had anything to do with}} the pass <b>I</b> <b>would</b> not <b>have</b> <b>taken</b> it. <b>I</b> thought that the writing was familiar to me. Oh dear!

2500|$|No doubt, I am {{indebted to}} Abu Bakr {{more than to}} anybody else {{regarding}} both his companionship and his wealth.

"No, sir; father sent up a pound in a letter, only Nanny Brooks said I owed some {{to her for}} my victuals, and I {{have not}} much of it left, and bread comes dear, so when Toby brought me this bit of meat I was glad of it, sir, but <b>I</b> <b>would</b> not <b>have</b> <b>taken</b> it--" ...|$|R
6000|$|CUSINS. <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>taken</b> {{two hundred}} and fifty. How you can succeed in {{business}} when {{you are willing to}} pay all that money to a University don who is obviously not worth a junior clerk's wages!--well! What will Lazarus say? ...|$|E
6000|$|Thereupon {{she closed}} {{and locked the}} door and came back quite serious.

6000|$|... "That was Vernon's work--no Englishman new to {{the country}} could have slashed them off so cleanly. But look at this small spruce stump.
