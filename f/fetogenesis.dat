40|$|Development is {{considered}} to encompass {{all aspects of the}} mammalian life span from initial initial germ cell production through the complete life cycle to death of the organism. Thus, gamete production, fertilization, embryogenesis, implantation, <b>fetogenesis,</b> birth, peri- and postnatal maturation, and aging were all considered as stages of a development continuum relevant to problems of Space Biology. Deliberations thus far have been limited to stages of the development cycle from fertilization to early postnatal life. The deliberations are detailed...|$|E
40|$|The {{possible}} {{involvement of}} cytokines such as tumour necrosis factor-a (TNF-a), interleukin- 1 b (IL- 1 b) and interferon-g (IFN-g) that {{are suspected of}} causing pregnancy loss and miscarriage has been investigated in dams of mice subjected to hyperthermia. Thermal stress was induced by exposing mice dams at 40721 C for 4 h every day during the different phases of the gestation period whereas the normothermic animals were housed at 22721 C. The effect of maternal thermal stress was measured in pregnant mice at different phases of the gestation period namely, blastogenesis-implantation phase (days 0 – 5 postconceptionem [p. c. ]), organogenesis or embryogenesis phase (days 6 – 15 p. c.) and <b>fetogenesis</b> phase (days 16 – 20 p. c.). Uterine examination of dams subjected to hyperthermia on days 6 – 15 p. c. showed maximum reduction in live fetus number, gestational index and maximum pre- and postimplantation loss in comparison with dams housed in normothermic environment and dams exposed to thermal stress between days 0 – 5 and 16 – 20 p. c. Maximum resorption rate and number of non-viable fetuses were observed in dams exposed to hyperthermia during days 6 – 15 p. c. Elevated levels of TNF-a and IL- 1 b were observed in the amniotic fluid of dams subjected to hyperthermia during days 6 – 15 p. c. but IFN-g levels remained unaltered. Singl...|$|E
40|$|LIM and SH 3 Protein 1 (LASP- 1) was {{initially}} identified from a cDNA library of metastatic axillary lymph nodes (MLN) {{more than a}} decade ago. It was found to be overexpressed in human breast and ovarian cancer and became the first member of a newly defined LIM-protein subfamily of the nebulin group characterized by the combined presence of LIM and SH 3 domains. LASP 2, a novel LASP 1 -related gene was first identified and characterized in silico. Subsequently it proved to be a splice variant of the Nebulin gene and therefore was also termed LIM/nebulette. LASP- 1 and - 2 are highly conserved in their LIM, nebulin-like and SH 3 domains but differ significantly at their linker regions. Both proteins are ubiquitously expressed and involved in cytoskeletal architecture, especially in the organization of focal adhesions. Here we present the first systematic review to summarize all relevant data concerning their domain organization, expression profiles, regulating factors and function. We compile evidence that both, LASP- 1 and LASP- 2, are important during early embryo- and <b>fetogenesis</b> and are highly expressed in the central nervous system of the adult. However, only LASP- 1 seems to participate significantly in neuronal differentiation and plays an important functional role in migration and proliferation of certain cancer cells while the role of LASP- 2 is more structural. The increased expression of LASP- 1 in breast tumours correlates with high rates of nodal-metastasis and refers to a possible relevance as a prognostic marker...|$|E
40|$|It {{has been}} widely {{reported}} that prenatal exposure to ionizing radiation can interfere with embryonic and fetal development, depending on dose and gestational age in which exposure occurs. According to several studies on animal models, different well-defined stages during prenatal life can be distinguished in relation to teratogenic effects. During the preimplantation stage, elevated doses of radiation can result in abortion, while lower doses may produce genomic damage that is usually repaired. On the other hand, during the organogenesis stage in mice (embryonic day 6. 5 [E 6. 5] to E 13. 5), irradiation is associated with increased incidence of malformation and intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR). Later exposure is linked to brain damage. Doses used in animal studies are generally higher than those used for diagnostic procedures in humans. Usually, radiation exposure to diagnostic range (< 0. 05 Gy = 5 rads) is not {{associated with an increased}} risk of congenital anomalies. In human studies, elevated doses produce adverse outcomes, depending on stage of development, as in animal studies. Blastogenesis (up to two weeks) is associated with failure to implant or no significant health effects. An increased risk of malformation and growth retardation can be observed for two to seven weeks exposure (organogenesis stage), while exposure at later stages (<b>fetogenesis)</b> is mainly associated with brain damage. In this review we focus on the relevance of estimating the cumulative dose of radiation to the fetus and the gestational age in which exposure occurs, to provide appropriate counseling to pregnant women...|$|E
40|$|OBJETIVO: Avaliar os efeitos da ipriflavona durante a fetogênese, já que não foram encontrados estudos visando avaliar seu efeito durante este período. MÉTODOS: Foram utilizadas 60 ratas prenhes, distribuídas aleatoriamente em quatro grupos (n= 15). G-controle (1 mL de água destilada) e três grupos tratados com ipriflavona, via intragástrica, do 16 º ao 20 º dia pós-coito (PC) : G- 300 (300 mg/kg), G- 1500 (1. 500 mg/kg) e G- 3000 (3. 000 mg/kg). Os animais foram pesados e sacrificados no 21 º dia por exsanguinação total sob anestesia (xilazina (10 mg/kg) e quetamina (90 mg/kg) via intraperitoneal. Foi realizado hemograma completo e dosagens séricas de colesterol, triglicérides, AST, ALT, ureia, creatinina e glicose das ratas prenhes. Após laparotomia foram removidos e pesados fígado, rim, suprarrenais, baço e ovários; os fetos e placentas foram pesados obtendo-se o peso médio das ninhadas. Quatro fetos (dois machos e duas fêmeas) por mãe foram aleatoriamente designados para obter-se o comprimento e peso de cérebro, fígado, rins e pulmões. Para a análise estatística utilizou-se o teste ANOVA seguido do teste de Dunnet; para dados não homocedásticos e sem distribuição normal, foi usado o teste de Kruskal-Wallis, seguido de Mann-Whitney; as proporções foram analisadas pelo teste do &# 967;² (p PURPOSE: Evaluate {{the effects}} of {{ipriflavone}} during <b>fetogenesis,</b> since no {{studies have been conducted}} to assess its effect during this period. METHODS: 60 pregnant rats were divided randomly into four groups (n= 15). G-control (1 mL of distilled water) and three groups treated intragastrically with ipriflavone from the 16 th to the 20 th post coitus (PC) day: G- 300 (300 mg/kg), G- 1, 500 (1, 500 mg/kg) and G- 3, 000 (3, 000 mg/kg). The animals were weighed, anaesthetized intraperitoneally with xylazine and ketamine at doses of 180 mg/kg and 10 mg/kg, respectively, and sacrificed by total exsanguination on the 21 st day. A complete blood count was performed and serum cholesterol, triglycerides, AST, ALT, urea, creatinine, and glucose were determined in pregnant rats. After laparotomy, the liver, kidneys, adrenals, spleen and ovaries were removed and weighed; fetuses and placentas were also weighed to obtain the average weight of the litters. Four fetuses (two males and two females) were chosen at random for the determination of the length and weight of brain, liver, kidneys and lungs. Statistical analysis: ANOVA followed by Dunnett's test. For raw data without normal distribution and homoscedasticity, we used the Kruskal-Wallis test followed by the Mann-Whitney test. Proportions were analyzed by the &# 967;² test (p< 0. 05). RESULTS: Triglyceride levels (mg/dL) were: Control-G (138. 8 ± 21. 8), G- 300 (211. 2 ± 63. 9) G- 1, 500 (251. 5 ± 65. 2) G- 3, 000 (217. 7 ± 49. 6); p< 0. 05. The body weight of fetuses (g) was: G-Control (male 3. 3 ± 0. 3; female 3. 1 ± 0. 3), G- 300 (male 3. 4 ± 0. 2; female 3. 1 ± 0. 4), G- 1, 500 (male 3. 5 ± 0. 3; female 3. 2 ± 0. 3), G- 3, 000 (male 3. 4 ± 0. 5; female 3. 1 ± 0. 4). CONCLUSION: Ipriflavone did not cause maternal toxicity, but increased triglyceride levels and reduced hematocrit at higher doses. The body and organ weights of the fetuses did not change with dam treatment. There were no external malformations or fetal deaths...|$|E
