40|$|Natural rubber serum powder, {{which is}} {{by-product}} {{obtained in the}} production of latex rubber, has a strong growth-stimulating activity for Bifidobacterium bifidum JCM 1254. The retained fraction obtained by ultrafiltration (molecular weight cutoff 1000 ） showed a growth-stimulating activity in a dose-dependent manner on B_ assay medium with ammonium sulfate. One of the growth stimulators was purified from the retained fraction by acetone precipitation, solid-phase extraction with a hydrophobic pretreatment colum, and multi-stage reversed-phase HPLC. An increase of 53 -fold in the specific activity, and a recovery of 1. 3 % were obtained.

40|$|A field {{experiment}} in growing sweet basil {{was carried out}} in the period 2008 - 2010 in Fajsławice (Lublin region), on podzolic soil. The study evaluated the biometric traits of the plants, yield, the qualitative parameters of herbal raw material and weed infestation of the crop in dependence on growth simulators (Asahi SL, Bio-algeen, Titanit) and the forecrop (winter wheat or spring barley + white mustard cover crop). Plots without foliar application of the <b>growth</b> <b>stimulators</b> were the control treatment. Tillage, mineral NPK fertilization as well as mechanical and chemical weed control were typical for this plant species and consistent with the recommendations for herbal plant protection. A hypothesis was made that the application of <b>growth</b> <b>stimulators</b> would {{have a positive effect on}} basil productivity, raw material quality and weed infestation of the basil crop. It was also assumed that the phytosanitary and fertilizing effects of the cover crop would result in higher and qualitatively better yield compared to the cereal forecrop alone (winter wheat). The best quantitative parameters of sweet basil raw material and the highest reduction in air-dry weight of weeds in the crop were observed after the application of the <b>growth</b> <b>stimulators.</b> The forecrop - spring barley + a white mustard cover crop that is ploughed in - also had a beneficial effect on yield and weed infestation of the plant in question. The traditional crop protection method used in the basil crop, without the application of the <b>growth</b> <b>stimulators,</b> resulted in a lower plant height and a smaller number of shoots per plant. This caused higher weed infestation of the crop and a decrease in yield. The positive side of the non-application of <b>growth</b> <b>stimulators</b> was a better chemical composition of basil raw material.

It is found that the linear dimensions of potato and weight of rаw and dry matter of the whole plant increaseonly upon applying gibberellic acid. Other growth regulators have not changed the indexes significantly. The number of leaves per plant, weight of rаw and dry matter of leaves increased under the influence of gibberellic acid and 6 -benzylaminopurine, {{that was one of the}} main pre-requisites to strengthen the photosynthetic activity of plants.

Changes of phytometric and mezo-structure indexes of leaves and increase in the amount of chlorophyll under the influence of growth regulators contributed to intensification of photosynthetic activity of the leaf apparatus, and its consequence was the increase in net photosynthetic productivity and crop yields.

40|$|AbstractUsing a novel {{approach}} that detects changes in the conformation of ERα, we studied the efficacy of anti-estrogens to inactivate ERα under different experimental conditions. We show that phosphorylation of serine- 305 in the hinge region of ERα by protein kinase A (PKA) induced resistance to tamoxifen. Tamoxifen bound but then failed to induce the inactive conformation, invoking ERα-dependent transactivation instead. PKA activity thus induces a switch from antagonistic to agonistic effects of tamoxifen on ERα. In clinical samples, we found that downregulation of a negative regulator of PKA, PKA-RIα, was associated with tamoxifen resistance prior to treatment. Activation of PKA by downregulation of PKA-RIα converts tamoxifen from an ERα inhibitor into a <b>growth</b> <b>stimulator,</b> without any effect on ICI 182780 (Fulvestrant) ...|$|E

The function of TXNIP in vivo in carcinogenesis is not fully understood. Here, we show TXNIP to be downregulated in human bladder cancer according to grade and stage and also that loss of TXNIP expression facilitates bladder carcinogenesis using a mouse bladder cancer model. N-butyl-N-(4 -hydroxybutyl) nitrosamine (BBN) -induced bladder cancer was found in 100 % of Txnip knockout (KO) mice at week 8 of 0. 025 % BBN administration but in only 22 % of wild-type (WT) mice at the same point. Among <b>growth</b> <b>stimulators,</b> phospho-extracellular signal-regulated kinase (pERK) expression was stronger during bladder carcinogenesis in Txnip-KO mice than in WT mice. We then evaluated TXNIP's effects on ERK activation through various <b>growth</b> <b>stimulators</b> and their receptors. Overexpression of TXNIP in human bladder cancer cells attenuated pERK expression upon stimulation with stromal cell-derived factor- 1 (SDF- 1) but not with epidermal growth factor or insulin-like growth factor- 1. In Txnip-KO mice, immunohistochemical analysis showed enhanced expression of C-X-C chemokine receptor type 4 (CXCR 4), the receptor of SDF- 1, and of pERK in urothelial cells during BBN-induced bladder carcinogenesis. Finally, subcutaneous injection of CXCR 4 antagonist, TF 14016, attenuated pERK in urothelial cells and suppressed bladder carcinogenesis. These data indicate that TXNIP negatively regulates bladder carcinogenesis by attenuating SDF- 1 -CXCR 4 -induced ERK activation.
