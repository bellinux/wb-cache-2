5|$|On February 25, 2014, {{investigators}} {{revealed that}} <b>DNA</b> <b>evidence</b> identified Chandler as the murderer of Ivelisse Berrios-Beguerisse, who was raped and strangled {{to death in}} Coral Springs on November 27, 1990.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of Hodgson's appeal, Operation Iceberg {{was created by the}} Criminal Cases Review Commission (CCRC) with the aim of using <b>DNA</b> <b>evidence</b> in pre-1990 rape or murder cases. This led to the review of 240 other convictions. The CCRC also {{requested}} that the Crown Prosecution Service identify and review similar murder cases from the time before DNA testing was available. In September 2009, on the basis of <b>DNA</b> <b>evidence</b> from his exhumed body, police named David Lace as the likely killer. Lace, who was 17 {{at the time of the}} murder, had confessed to police in 1983 that he had raped and killed DeSimone, but officers refused to believe him. Lace committed suicide in December 1988.|$|E
5|$|In 2010, the FBI {{announced}} that some {{evidence from the}} original crime scene {{had been sent to}} the FBI's Laboratory in Quantico, Virginia for retesting with the hope of finding new <b>DNA</b> <b>evidence</b> to identify the culprits of the theft.|$|E

5000|$|Robert Golub {{was charged}} {{with the murder of}} Kelly and brought to trial in late 1989 after a bloody handprint {{matching}} Golub's was discovered. His brother John Golub was suspected of being involved in the murder, but was never formally charged. During the trial Golub's lawyer Salvatore Marinello raised questions over the police search, saying that it was an improper and unlawful search, as well as questioning the <b>DNA</b> <b>evidence's</b> accuracy. Marinello argued that the DNA testing was unreliable, and that the testing process performed on the blood samples might be in question. A supervisor for the testing facility Lifecodes Corporation stated that [...] "the tests on the blood samples were accurate, and asserted that the chances of the blood belonging to someone other than Robert Golub were 1 in 707 million." ...|$|R
5|$|Based on {{morphological}} evidence, British zoologist Reginald Pocock {{concluded the}} jaguar is most {{closely related to}} the leopard. However, <b>DNA</b> <b>evidence</b> is inconclusive and the position of the jaguar relative to the other species varies between studies. Fossils of extinct Panthera species, such as the European jaguar (Panthera gombaszoegensis) and the American lion (Panthera atrox), show characteristics of both the lion and the jaguar. Analysis of jaguar mitochondrial DNA has dated the species' lineage to between 280,000 and 510,000 years ago, later than suggested by fossil records.|$|E
5|$|Because DNA {{collects}} mutations over time, {{which are}} then inherited, it contains historical information, and, by comparing DNA sequences, geneticists can infer the evolutionary history of organisms, their phylogeny. This field of phylogenetics is a powerful tool in evolutionary biology. If DNA sequences within a species are compared, population geneticists can learn the history of particular populations. This {{can be used in}} studies ranging from ecological genetics to anthropology; For example, <b>DNA</b> <b>evidence</b> is being used to try to identify the Ten Lost Tribes of Israel.|$|E
5|$|Local wine-labeling {{regulations}} are slowly {{catching up with}} the <b>DNA</b> <b>evidence,</b> a process that has been slowed by trade disputes. The European Union recognized Zinfandel as a synonym for Primitivo in January 1999, meaning that Italian Primitivos can be labelled as Zinfandel in the United States and any other country that recognises EU labelling laws. Italian winemakers {{have taken advantage of}} these rules and shipped Primitivo wines to the United States labelled as Zinfandels, with the approval of the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau (TTB).|$|E

5|$|The {{stains on}} Van der Sloot's clothes matched Flores' blood type. Blood {{was also found}} on the floor, hallway, and {{mattress}} in the hotel room. Police stated that DNA tests would be conducted on the clothes, skin found under the victim's fingernails, and the previously recovered tennis racquet. Ricardo Flores stated in interviews that his daughter's body needed to be exhumed to gather the fingernail <b>DNA</b> <b>evidence,</b> and that her body had not been cremated for this reason.|$|E
5|$|Al-Qaeda {{confirmed}} the death on May 6 with posts made on militant websites, vowing to avenge the killing. Other Pakistani militant groups, including the Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan, vowed retaliation against the U.S. and against Pakistan for not preventing the operation. The raid {{was supported by}} over 90% of the American public, was welcomed by the United Nations, NATO, the European Union {{and a large number}} of governments, but was condemned by others, including two-thirds of the Pakistani public. Legal and ethical aspects of the killing, such as his not being taken alive despite being unarmed, were questioned by others, including Amnesty International. Also controversial was the decision not to release any photographic or <b>DNA</b> <b>evidence</b> of bin Laden's death to the public.|$|E
40|$|The {{ability of}} jurors and juries to {{comprehend}} and utilise scientific evidence in Australian criminal trials has been examined. From mock jury surveys relating to <b>DNA</b> profiling <b>evidence,</b> {{it was determined}} that most respondents were able to comprehend some basic and applied statistics, although their ability was in part related to their knowledge of English and their level of education. The point at which mock jurors were prepared to convict an accused {{solely on the basis of}} <b>DNA</b> profiling <b>evidence</b> was examined and found to be low compared with the strength of <b>DNA</b> profiling <b>evidence</b> commonly presented in Australian courts. Mock jurors also demonstrated the ability to process evidence that was presented in a Bayesian framework; commencing with prior odds, introducing new information and culminating in posterior odds. From a survey of Australian forensic scientists, including fraud investigators, it was found that most practitioners' concerns could be addressed by greater pre-trial consultation between experts and legal advocates. Improved knowledge within the legal profession concerning the jargon, principles, procedures, limitations and conclusions to be drawn from different scientific disciplines, prior to presenting this evidence in court, is recommended as the means by which complex evidence can be better adduced from expert witnesses and better presented to juries in criminal trials. Finally, from interviewing actual jurors in criminal trials in the Australian Capital Territory {{it was determined that}} where jurors' expectations of scientific <b>evidence,</b> particularly <b>DNA</b> profiling <b>evidence,</b> are not met, high levels of juror frustration and speculation may culminate in hung juries. The adversarial setting of criminal proceedings was also found to produce an environment in which jurors felt that information that would assist them in reaching a verdict was being deliberately withheld. The ability of the jury to ask questions and the allowed nature of those questions were also examined, with the resultant recommendation that juries be given more explicit information at the commencement of trials to inform them about their rights and obligations when asking questions...|$|R

5|$|Based on {{microsatellite}} <b>DNA</b> <b>evidence,</b> the sicklefin {{lemon shark}} {{is thought to}} have diverged from its sister species N. brevirostris 1014 million years ago, when the closure of the Tethys Sea separated lemon sharks in the Indian Ocean from those in the Atlantic. The ancestral lemon shark species may have been N. eurybathrodon, the fossilized teeth of which occur in both the United States and Pakistan. Morphological and molecular phylogenetic analyses suggest that Negaprion is grouped with the whitetip reef shark (Triaenodon) and the sliteye shark (Loxodon) in occupying an intermediate position on the carcharhinid evolutionary tree, between the most basal genera (Galeocerdo, Rhizoprionodon, and Scoliodon) and the most derived (Carcharhinus and Sphyrna).|$|E
5|$|In 1998 the Angiosperm Phylogeny Group {{published}} a phylogeny for flowering plants {{based on an}} analysis of DNA sequences from most families of flowering plants. As {{a result of this}} work, many questions, such as which families represent the earliest branches of angiosperms, have now been answered. Investigating how plant species are related to each other allows botanists to better understand the process of evolution in plants. Despite the study of model plants and increasing use of <b>DNA</b> <b>evidence,</b> there is ongoing work and discussion among taxonomists about how best to classify plants into various taxa. Technological developments such as computers and electron microscopes have greatly increased the level of detail studied and speed at which data can be analysed.|$|E
5|$|Law {{enforcement}} officers often receive inquiries and demands about their investigations that stem from unrealistic portrayals on television. In a 2010 survey of Canadian police officers, some were frustrated by these CSI-affected queries, though most {{saw them as}} opportunities {{to inform the public}} about real police work. New technologies and the increased public awareness of forensic science have stimulated new interest in solving cold cases and encouraged higher accountability among police investigators. However, the increased demand for forensic evidence can cause an unmanageable workload for forensic laboratories. Some crime labs process several thousand cases every year. Many law enforcement agencies have insufficient storage space for the increasing amount of physical evidence they collect. In some investigations, <b>DNA</b> <b>evidence</b> is not collected simply because there is not enough space to store it properly.|$|E
40|$|We have {{demonstrated}} that Leishmania spp. grown as promastigotes, {{are sensitive to the}} K+ channel inhibitors 4 -aminopyridine and glibenclamide. Their host cells, the macrophages, are not affected by similar concentrations of the drugs. We have also initiated the molecular characterization of the mechanisms involved in the development of drug resistance to glibenclamide by the parasite. Therefore, we have selected experimentally and begun to characterize the Venezuelan Leishmania (Leishmania) strain, NR resistant to glibenclamide [NR(Gr) ]. The analysis of genomic <b>DNA</b> <b>evidenced</b> the existence of a fragment which apparently is amplified in NR(Gr). The fragment recognized by the pgpA probe, related to the Leishmania P-glycoprotein family and which was originally isolated from L. tarentolae, showed a size polymorfism between the sensitive and the resistant strain. These results suggest that the development of resistance to glibenclamide in the strain NR(Gr) might be associated with the amplification of the ltpgpA or related gene(s...|$|R
