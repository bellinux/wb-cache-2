25|$|His own {{far left}} inclinations were by then {{contrasting}} with his civil service positions, which he maintained {{even as his}} daughter Ecaterina was becoming a persona non grata. In 1923, Arbore published a new installment of his memoirs, as În temnițele rusești ("In the Russian Dungeons"). In March 1924, he replaced Vasile Ghenzul as <b>editorial</b> <b>director</b> <b>of</b> Furnica ("The Ant"). The cooperativist and agrarian bimonthly was published in Bessarabia, and printed a Russian-language supplement. He was still {{a contributor to the}} central leftist press: in December 1926, Adevărul published his piece about the Serbian politician Nikola Pašić, defunct leader of the People's Radical Party. During this interval, Ecaterina tried to return to Romania. According to one interpretation, she was trying to hide her growing disillusionment with communism under the pretext that she needed {{to take care of her}} ailing father. The Romanian authorities did not allow her entry into the country, and she was forced back. Zamfir and his wife had earlier adopted Dumitru's young child, Zamfir Dumitru Arbore.|$|E

The website was first conceived by Chris Heldman under the idea of [...] "The Game Trust", a chosen group {{of some of the}} finest writers in the industry. He pitched the idea of creating a new gaming website to John Keefer at the E3 2007. Keefer, initially adamant, agreed with the stipulation of a [...] "separation of church and state" [...] in terms of being in the pocket of video game companies. The company was based in New York City, setting up office in October 2007. The site was in beta for six months before launching on October 26, 2008, with twenty employees, ranging from Entertainment Weekly to Wired. The website announced the same day that it raised $8.25 million in venture capital from J. P. Morgan's Constellation Ventures. In February 2009, Crispy Gamer signed a syndication deal with Tribune Media Services, McClatchy Tribune Information Services, and gamerDNA.|$|E
500|$|After five issues, {{the title}} was changed to Marvel Tales; at the same time, the number of stories advertised as [...] "passionate" [...] or {{containing}} [...] "sin-lost" [...] or [...] "lust-crazed" [...] characters sharply increased. Though some stories contained little to match the titillating blurbs, others did, with [...] "women entrapped, burned and otherwise maltreated, and whips cracking into use with uninventive frequency", according to sf historian Joseph Marchesani. The magazine ceased publication with the April 1941 issue, but in 1950 the Goodmans saw an opportunity to revive it when a new boom in science fiction magazines got under way. Erisman was still working for the Goodmans, and was listed as <b>editorial</b> <b>director</b> <b>of</b> the {{new version of the}} magazine, but much of the editorial work was done by Daniel Keyes, who was credited as [...] "Editorial Associate" [...] on the 1951 issues. The first issue of the new incarnation of Marvel Science Stories was dated November 1950. After two issues Erisman switched the magazine to a digest format, but the final issue, dated May 1952, was once again a pulp. The post-war issues contained stories by well-known writers, including Arthur C. Clarke, Isaac Asimov, Richard Matheson, William Tenn, Jack Vance, and Lester del Rey, but the stories were of only average quality. In Marchesani's opinion, Erisman and Keyes were able to improve on the material published in the pre-war Marvel Tales, but the field had grown more sophisticated since those days, and the writers who sold to Marvel Tales were now publishing their best work elsewhere.|$|E
500|$|Unorthodox Jukebox debuted {{at number}} {{two on the}} Billboard 200 with first-week sales of 192,000 copies (134,400 {{physical}} sales and 57,600 digital sales), topping the expectations of sales that were around 140,000-150,000 copies, earning Bruno Mars his highest peak on the chart. The next week, it sold 178,000 copies, dropping to the third position with an 8% sales decrease. The album secured a third consecutive week within the top five in America, withstanding a 38% sales drop to 110,000 copies. Three weeks after the debut, the record sold a total of 480,000 copies. On March 7, 2013, twelve weeks since its availability, the record reached the top spot of the Billboard 200 with 95,000 copies sold, mainly due to an Amazon MP3 sale pricing ($1.99 {{for a day and}} $3.99 {{for the rest of the}} week). The album sold 1,399,000 copies in the United States until January 2014, making it the fifth best-selling album of the year. In the week of February 5, 2014, following Mars' presence at the 56th Annual Grammy Awards and performance at the Super Bowl XLVIII halftime show, sales for the album increased by 180%, rebounding Unorthodox Jukebox back in the top ten. For the week ending February 12, 2014, the album climbed to the third position with sales of 81,000, up 92%, making a total of 123,000 units sold in both weeks. The album has been certified four times Platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) due to sales and streaming figures equivalent to four million copies. As of July 24, 2017, it has sold 2,574,000 [...] total copies in the United States. The record's success in 2013 was decisive to Mars being chosen as the headline performance on the half-time show of the Super Bowl XLVIII, and appearing on Billboard Artist of the Year by Billboard; according to Bill Werde, an <b>editorial</b> <b>director</b> <b>of</b> the magazine, the singer's songs that [...] "stuck around on multiple formats all year round" [...] played a key role. He was also the most-played artist at Pop Radio (Top 40), the third most played at Rhythmic stations and Hot Adult Contemporary station (HAC), as well as the fifth most-played at AC stations in 2013, according to Mediabase. In addition, Mars topped three of Billboard's 2013 year-end charts (Hot 100 Artist, Mainstream Top 40 and Hot Digital Songs).|$|E
