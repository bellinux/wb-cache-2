This paper updates an earlier study on direct and indirect assistance to {{home ownership}} in Australia, {{a country with a}} mature home ownership sector. It examines the changing pattern of deposit assistance provided to first homebuyers and the trends in indirect assistance provided through the tax system, with tenure neutrality taken as the preferred tax <b>expenditure</b> <b>benchmark.</b> It was motivated by a significant growth in real dwelling values and changes to the tax system since the mid- 1980 s that have resulted in increased tax concessions to owner-occupiers. Indirect assistance is shown to dominate direct assistance and is poorly targeted, with the greatest amount of assistance being provided to those households who need it least. On a per household basis, outright owners receive more than five times the amount received by those with a mortgage, with high-income outright owners receiving an estimated benefit of close to $ 9, 000 (€ 5, 400) per annum. Home purchasers in the bottom 80 per cent of the income distribution received less than $ 500 (€ 300) per household per year.

40|$|The {{sovereign}} debt crisis induced {{a wide array}} of new institutions to reinforce European economic governance. The budget of the European member states is now subject of the European semester, {{which is part of the}} preventive arm of the Stability and Growth Pact as codified by and backed-up by the so-called Six-Pack and Two-Pack and backed by the Fiscal Compact that enable the Commission to issue, inter alia, country-specific recommendations before the budget is submitted to national parliaments. The country-specific recommendations are not binding, but will be hard to ignore by the member states in the long run unless the economy recovers. In this paper we are going to look at the efforts of the European Union to reinforce European fiscal governance, i. e. the coordination of the budgetary policy of the member states. More precisely, we will address the progress of the member states towards their Medium-Term Budgetary Objective as measured by the structural balance and <b>Expenditure</b> <b>Benchmark</b> as well as the implementation of the Country-Specific Recommendations in the field of fiscal policy, which are further strengthened by the Fiscal Compact by which the member states – with the exception of the Czech Republic and the United Kingdom – commit themselves to fiscal discipline, coordination and governance. The paper is geared to the assessment the country-specific recommendations in terms of goal-attainment and effectiveness and aims, by such, to deliver a contribution to the body of knowledge on European economic governance and fiscal consolidation...|$|E

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{examines the}} relationship between inventory cost (IC) and transportation cost (TC). The association of the two has been recognized for over a hundred years; accordingly, managers and academics have believed that these costs have offsetting properties such that combinations of inventory and transportation expenditures can be altered to fit different strategic objectives. However, the behavior of this relationship in practice has not been tested. The essays of this dissertation examine this relationship through multiple theoretical lenses and with multiple data sets. Essay 1 examines aggregate IC and TC in the United States from 1960 - 2009. This period coincides with the recognition of total cost management and the ensuing practice of inventory and transportation tradeoff. Essay 1 provides new insight into the macroeconomic relationship of IC and TC by providing a model of their relationship. Examination reveals distinct differences before and after transportation deregulation in the United States. Essay 2 continues the investigation of {{the relationship between}} IC and TC, this time using firm-specific, panel data that spans a five-year period from 2006 - 2011. Inventory theory is used to identify variables and build a model that forecasts firm inventory. To this base model, TC is added. Findings support the research in Essay 1 by confirming that firms do show indication of balancing IC and TC. Essay 3 examines the use of transportation benchmarking information and how it affects firm performance. Based on information processing theory, the impact of transportation benchmarking information on a firm 2 ̆ 7 s ability to reduce transportation cost (TC) is examined. A variable is created that is the ratio of a firm 2 ̆ 7 s transportation expenditure to the total transportation <b>expenditure</b> in the <b>benchmarking</b> consortium. Panel data is used to test the impact of this ratio on a firm 2 ̆ 7 s ability to reduce transportation costs. Empirical analysis shows that transportation costs are convex in the ratio, and the results support the efficacy of transportation <b>expenditure</b> <b>benchmarking...</b>|$|R

In this study, we attempt to answer this question. Methods: We propose metrics to estimate domestic AIDS financing, using methods related to national prioritisation of health spending, disease burden, and economic growth. We apply these metrics to 12 countries in sub-Saharan Africa with a high prevalence of HIV/AIDS, generating scenarios of possible future domestic expenditure. We compare the results with total AIDS financing requirements to calculate {{the size of the}} resulting funding gaps and implications for donors. Findings: Nearly all 12 countries studied fall short of the proposed <b>expenditure</b> <b>benchmarks.</b> If they met these benchmarks fully, domestic spending on AIDS would increase by 2 · 5 times, from US$ 2 · 1 billion to $ 5 · 1 billion annually, covering 64 % of estimated future funding requirements and leaving a gap of around a third of the total $ 7 · 9 billion needed. Although upper-middle-income countries, such as Botswana, Namibia, and South Africa, would become financially self-reliant, lower-income countries, such as Mozambique and Ethiopia, would remain heavily dependent on donor funds. Interpretation: The proposed metrics could be useful to stimulate further analysis and discussion around domestic spending on AIDS and corresponding donor contributions, and to structure financial agreements between recipient country governments and donors. Coupled with improved resource tracking, such metrics could enhance transparency and accountability for efficient use of money and maximise the effect of available funding to prevent HIV infections and save lives.

40|$|In {{this study}} the {{distributional}} effect of housing subsidies in Flanders, the north region of Belgium, is analyzed. In addition, the mechanisms {{that lead to}} this distribution are clarified. The distributive impact is measured {{by means of the}} user cost concept and income quintiles. In order to calculate the level of subsidies the actual user cost is compared with a benchmark cost. Regarding tax <b>expenditure,</b> the <b>benchmark</b> is the generally accepted tax system. Concerning owner-occupiers the discussed subsidies are the mortgage tax relief, the reduced VAT rate for renovation, the reduced transfer tax rate and the imputed rent tax reduction. With regard to the rental sector, social housing and the housing allowance are the subsidy schemes at stake. The results show that the tax advantages are mainly received by the 40 per cent highest incomes. The reductions on property tax and transaction costs are to a lesser extent directed at higher incomes, since they include a condition of modest housing. The subsidies in the rental sector for the most part go to the two bottom income quintiles. Overall, the average owner-occupier receives four times more than the average tenant. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|This report lists 290 tax {{expenditures}} and, where possible, {{provides an}} estimate of the dollar value or order of magnitude of the benefit to taxpayers. Introduction A tax expenditure arises where the actual tax treatment of an activity or class of taxpayer differs from the benchmark tax treatment. 	Tax expenditures typically involve tax exemptions, deductions or offsets, concessional tax rates and deferrals of tax liability. 	 	A positive tax expenditure reduces tax payable relative to the benchmark. A negative tax expenditure increases tax payable relative to the benchmark. 	  Benchmarks represent a standard taxation treatment that applies to similar taxpayers or types of activity. 	 	Benchmarks may also incorporate structural elements of the tax system; for example, the progressive income tax rate scale for individual taxpayers. 	 Determining benchmarks involves judgment. Consequently, the choice of benchmark may be contentious and benchmarks may vary over time. The choice of benchmark should not be interpreted as indicating a view on how an activity or taxpayer ought to be taxed.   	To facilitate discussion and understanding of the impact of using different benchmarks, the 2013 TES included an illustrative case study which showed the differences in the estimates for superannuation tax expenditures if an <b>expenditure</b> tax <b>benchmark</b> was used rather than the usual income tax benchmark — see Appendix A, 2013 Tax Expenditures Statement. Although that exercise has not been repeated for this year’s TES, the conceptual points that were discussed in the 2013 TES remain.    ...|$|R
40|$|Background] End-of-life (EOL) care imposes heavy {{economic}} {{burdens on}} patients and health insurers. Little {{is known about}} the association between the types of EOL care and healthcare costs for cancer patients across various providers. [Objective] To explore the association of healthcare <b>expenditures</b> with <b>benchmarking</b> indicators of aggressive versus palliative care among terminally ill cancer patients, from the perspective of health insurers. [Design] Cross-sectional retrospective study using health insurance claims data. [Setting/participants] Cancer patients who had died in Kyoto prefecture, Japan, between April 2009 and May 2010. [Main outcome measure] Claims data were analyzed using multilevel generalized linear models to examine whether aggressive care and palliative care were associated with expenditures during the last 3 months of life, after adjusting for patient characteristics, hospital characteristics and other non-indicator procedures. [Results] We analyzed 3143 decedents from 54 hospitals. Median expenditure per patient during the last 3 months was US$ 13 030. Higher expenditures were associated with the aggressive care indicators of higher mortality at acute-care hospitals and use of chemotherapy in the last month of life, {{as well as with the}} palliative care indicators of increased hospice care and opioid use in the last 3 months of life. However, increased physician home care in the last 3 months was associated with lower expenditure. [Conclusions] Indicators of both aggressive and palliative EOL care were associated with higher healthcare expenditures. These results may support the coherent development of measures to optimize aggressive care and reduce the financial burdens of terminal cancer care...|$|R
