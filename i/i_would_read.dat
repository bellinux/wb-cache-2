25|$|Inevitably, I {{made up my}} mind to {{read the}} scripts of a foreign country. Around that time I went to the British Embassy, which was then still known as the Legation, and imposed myself on the Secretary Mr. (William George) Aston in his room. I was at the time {{occasionally}} babysitting Mr. Aston’s children. He had considerable understanding of Japanese literature. However Mr. Aston had brought into the Legation with him the scripts of various foreign plays. He had brought the complete works of Shakespeare though I doubted even though they were there that <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>read</b> them. So Mr. Aston, knowing the scripts of the various plays gave me readings, after all it was just the summary that I simply wanted to hear and as a consequence, based on that, I didn’t really end up appreciating the technique of playwriting.|$|E
2500|$|Mira's death left Baciu in near-complete {{isolation}} from the Romanian-speaking public. As he later noted: [...] "I literally {{have no one to}} whom <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>read</b> the things I write. There are at most ten Romanian speakers living in Honolulu and none of them, absolutely none, has ever been to a bookstore or a library to peek into, or to ask for, or to purchase a single book of poetry." [...] He honored her memory with a 1979 semi-autobiographical novel, eponymously titled Mira. A new volume of his memoirs saw print in Honolulu in 1980, as Praful de pe tobă ("The Dust on the Drum"). It was taped by Virgil Ierunca and serialized by Radio Free Europe (RFE), which broadcast clandestinely into Romania.|$|E
2500|$|In May 1996, Stuart {{received}} a message about a film role: [...] "A female voice {{said she was}} calling from Lightstorm Entertainment...about a movie to be shot on location, maybe Poland...about the Titanic, directed by James Cameron..." [...] The next afternoon, Cameron’s casting director, Mali Finn, came to Stuart’s house [...] "…with her assistant, Emily Schweber, who was carrying a video camera... Mali and I talked while Emily filmed us." [...] The next morning, Finn brought over James Cameron and his video camera. Stuart wrote, [...] "I was {{not the least bit}} nervous. I knew <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>read</b> Old Rose with the sympathy and tenderness that Cameron had intended…" [...] Five days after Stuart's eighty-sixth birthday, Finn phoned again and asked, “Gloria, {{how would you like to}} be Old Rose?” ...|$|E

2500|$|Edith Grossman, {{who wrote}} and {{published}} a highly acclaimed English {{translation of the}} novel in 2003, says that the book is mostly meant to move people into emotion using a systematic change of course, {{on the verge of}} both tragedy and comedy at the same time. Grossman has stated:The question is that Quixote has multiple interpretations [...] and how do I deal with that in my translation. I'm going to answer your question by avoiding it [...] so when I first started reading the Quixote I thought it was the most tragic book in the world, and <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>read</b> it and weep [...] As I grew older [...] my skin grew thicker [...] and so when I was working on the translation I was actually sitting at my computer and laughing out loud. This is done [...] as Cervantes did it [...] by never letting the reader rest. You are never certain that you truly got it. Because as soon as you think you understand something, Cervantes introduces something that contradicts your premise.|$|E
2500|$|In 1997, {{shortly after}} the Boston Globe {{disclosed}} that Bulger and Flemmi had been informants, Weeks met with retired agent John Connolly (later sentenced to 40 years in prison), who showed him a photocopy of Bulger's FBI informant file. In order to explain Bulger and Flemmi's status as informants, Connolly said, [...] "The Mafia was going against Jimmy and Stevie, so Jimmy and Stevie went against them." [...] According to Weeks, [...] "As I read over the files at the Top of the Hub that night, Connolly kept telling me that 90 percent of {{the information in the}} files came from Stevie. Certainly Jimmy hadn't been around the Mafia the way Stevie had. But, Connolly told me, he had to put Jimmy's name on the files to keep his file active. As long as Jimmy was an active informant, Connolly said, he could justify meeting with Jimmy and giving him valuable information. Even after he retired, Connolly still had friends in the FBI, and he and Jimmy kept meeting to let each other know what was going on. I listened to all that, but now I understood that even though he was retired, Connolly was still getting information, as well as money, from Jimmy. As I continued to read, I could see {{that a lot of the}} reports were not just against the Italians. There were more and more names of Polish and Irish guys, of people we had done business with, of friends of mine. Whenever I came across the name of someone I knew, <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>read</b> exactly what it said about that person. I would see, over and over again, that some of these people had been arrested for crimes that were mentioned in these reports. It didn't take long for me to realize that it had been bullshit when Connolly told me that the files hadn't been disseminated, that they had been for his own personal use. He had been an employee of the FBI. He hadn't worked for himself. If there was some investigation going on and his supervisor said, 'Let me take a look at that,' what was Connolly going to do? He had to give it up. And he obviously had. I thought about what Jimmy had always said, 'You can lie to your wife and to your girlfriends, but not to your friends. Not to anyone we're in business with.' Maybe Jimmy and Stevie hadn't lied to me. But they sure hadn't been telling me everything." ...|$|E

60|$|It {{was between}} ten and eleven o'clock when Mrs. Micawber rose {{to replace her}} cap in the whitey-brown paper parcel, and to put on her bonnet. Mr. Micawber took the {{opportunity}} of Traddles putting on his great-coat, to slip a letter into my hand, with a whispered request that <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>read</b> it at my leisure. I also took the opportunity of my holding a candle over the banisters to light them down, when Mr. Micawber was going first, leading Mrs. Micawber, and Traddles was following with the cap, to detain Traddles {{for a moment on}} the top of the stairs.|$|E

I saw that the face was colourless, and that the beautiful lips, out of which the words that had alarmed me more by their accents than their direct signification, were quivering {{in a way that}} their lovely mistress could not control. Tears, as large as heavy drops of rain, too, were trembling on the long silken eye-lashes, while the very attitude of the precious girl denoted hopelessness and grief! ...|$|E
6000|$|Edward laughed bitterly, {{and drew}} a paper from his breast.

60|$|Then comes another question. Do {{you wish}} to hear or read my {{comments}} before they are printed?

5000|$|Although each {{episode was}} a {{stand-alone}} story, episodes 2 and 3 shared a cast and linked plot.
