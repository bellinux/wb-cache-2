25|$|The <b>history</b> <b>of</b> <b>education</b> in this region, North West Territories, began officially in 1885 with Territorial Ordinance #5. North West Territorial Schools Districts or One Room School Houses {{replaced}} {{trading post}} schooling, missionary schools and private schooling of the past. Moose Jaw School District #1 was formally established December 5, 1884 {{under the new}} Board of Education. The 1944 School Act set out to establish larger consolidated schools {{and the formation of}} the schools and school districts presently in use. As with any Canadian province, the Saskatchewan Legislature has almost exclusive authority to make laws respecting education. Since 1905, the Legislature has used this capacity to continue the model of locally elected public and separate school boards which originated before 1905, as well as to create and/or regulate universities, colleges, technical institutions and other educational forms and institutions (public charter schools, private schools, home schooling). For historians and genealogists, previous school district records have been submitted to the Saskatchewan Provincial Archives Regina Branch.|$|E

The chief institutions of this kind in Spain are that at Valladolid and that in the Escorial.|$|E
