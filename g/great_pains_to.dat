5|$|How {{were such}} effects produced, {{and how did}} they look? The {{crocodile}} etc. obviously used the floor trap, but was it an illusionistically painted figure worked with sticks, or a man in a crocodile suit? There are no extant drawings or descriptions of machinery and sets for the Restoration theatre, although some documentation exists for court masques from {{the first half of the}} 17th century, notably the work of Inigo Jones and his pupil John Webb. One reason for the lack of information for the public theatres is that stage effects, and particularly machines, were trade secrets. Inventors of theatrical effects took <b>great</b> <b>pains</b> <b>to</b> hold on to their secrets, and the playhouses guarded their machine workings as zealously as a magician guards her or his tricks.|$|E
5|$|Avery Brundage had no {{children}} with either of his wives. During his first marriage, however, Brundage fathered two sons out of wedlock with his Finnish mistress, Lilian Dresden. His affair with Dresden was one of many. The children were born in 1951 and 1952, at precisely the time that Brundage was being considered for {{the presidency of the}} IOC. Though he privately acknowledged paternity, Brundage took <b>great</b> <b>pains</b> <b>to</b> conceal the existence of these children, concerned that the truth about his extra-marital relationships might damage his chances of election: he requested that his name be kept off the birth certificates. Brundage visited his two sons periodically in the 1950s, visits that tailed off to telephone calls in the 1960s and nothing in his final years. He did establish a trust fund for the boys' education and start in life, but after his death, unnamed in his will, they sued and won a small settlement of $62,500 each out of his $19 million estate.|$|E

25|$|But Richardson {{still felt}} the need to respond by writing a {{pamphlet}} called Answer to the Letter of a Very Reverend and Worthy Gentleman. In the pamphlet, he defends his characterizations and explains that he took <b>great</b> <b>pains</b> <b>to</b> avoid any glorification of scandalous behaviour, unlike the authors of many other novels that rely on characters of such low quality.|$|E

Marjory is {{independent}} and strong-willed, but is subdued somewhat by her love for Archibald. She is also intelligent and resourceful, and {{instead of being a}} passive victim, sets traps for her pursuers and leaves a trail of ciphers when she is captive to lead her friends to her.|$|E

25|$|Economist Bryan Caplan {{argues that}} many Austrians have not {{understood}} valid contributions of modern mainstream economics, {{causing them to}} overstate their differences with it. For example, Murray Rothbard stated that he objected {{to the use of}} cardinal utility in microeconomic theory. Caplan says that Rothbard did not understand the position he was attacking, because microeconomic theorists go to <b>great</b> <b>pains</b> <b>to</b> show that their results hold for any monotonic transformation of an ordinal utility function, and do not entail cardinal utility.|$|E
25|$|On {{the morning}} of 21 December, Ceaușescu {{addressed}} an assembly of approximately 100,000 people to condemn the uprising in Timișoara. Party officials took <b>great</b> <b>pains</b> <b>to</b> make it appear that Ceaușescu was still immensely popular. Several busloads of workers, under threat of being fired, arrived in Bucharest's Piața Palatului (Palace Square, now Piața Revoluției – Revolution Square) and were given red flags, banners and large pictures of Ceaușescu. They were augmented by bystanders who were rounded up on Calea Victoriei.|$|E
25|$|Because witness {{intimidation}} {{had been such}} an important issue during the initial trial, witness protection was a prominent feature in both trials. During both trial the Prosecution took <b>great</b> <b>pains</b> <b>to</b> protect the identity of witnesses called to testify. This often included, voice modification, pseudonyms, {{and in some cases}} witness relocation. During the retrial, the Court took the extraordinary measure of moving the entire court to an undisclosed secret location in order to secure the testimony of a protected witness. These efforts paid off.|$|E

Bowie had to change recording studios after one day when someone at the studio leaked the rumour that he was recording there. The studio he moved to (The Magic Shop) would run the studio with a skeleton crew of only one or two employees on days when Bowie was there. Columbia Records's UK PR firm learned of the project only {{a few days before the}} album was released.|$|E
25|$|Since {{the sixteenth}} century, {{it has been}} widely held that the Aztec Emperor Moctezuma II {{initially}} believed the landing of Hernán Cortés in 1519 to be Quetzalcoatl's return. This view has been questioned by ethno-historians who argue that the Quetzalcoatl-Cortés connection is not found in any document that was created independently of post-Conquest Spanish influence, {{and that there is}} little proof of a pre-Hispanic belief in Quetzalcoatl's return. Most documents expounding this theory are of entirely Spanish origin, such as Cortés's letters to Charles V of Spain, in which Cortés goes to <b>great</b> <b>pains</b> <b>to</b> present the naive gullibility of the Aztecs in general as a great aid in his conquest of Mexico.|$|E
25|$|When Yeo {{arrived at}} the Agency for Science, Technology and Research (A*STAR) in 2001, he found that fewer than 20% of PhD holders in A*STAR's institutes were Singaporean, and few among them were young scientists. Yeo {{immediately}} set up his boldest scholarship yet by setting up the A*STAR Graduate Academy to implement the plan to train up 1,000 PhD scholars that would eventually return to Singapore and undertake research in fields like information technology, engineering, molecular biology, biochemistry and medicine. One {{of the hallmarks of}} Yeo's personal style is the amount of personal attention he gives to his scholars. He takes <b>great</b> <b>pains</b> <b>to</b> remember personal details about their background and also closely tracks their academic performance. He regularly meets with them to buy them meals whenever he is near their overseas universities on his regular business trips abroad.|$|E

25|$|Watson's {{merger of}} {{diplomacy}} and business {{was not always}} lauded. During the 1930s, IBM's German subsidiary was its most profitable foreign operation, and a 2001 book by Edwin Black, IBM and the Holocaust, argues that Watson's pursuit of profit led him to personally approve and spearhead IBM's strategic technological relationship with Nazi Germany. In particular, critics point to the coveted Order of the German Eagle medal that Watson received at the Berlin ICC meeting in 1937, as evidence {{that he was being}} honored for the help that IBM's German subsidiary Dehomag (Deutsche Hollerith-Maschinen Gesellschaft mbH) and its punch card machines provided the Nazi regime, particularly in the tabulation of census data (i.e. location of Jews). Another study argues that Watson believed, perhaps naively, that the medal was in recognition of his years of labor on behalf of global commerce and international peace. Within a year of the Berlin congress though, where Watson's hopes had run high, he found himself strongly protesting the German policy toward the Jews. Because of his strong feelings about the issue, Watson wanted to return his German citation shortly after receiving it. When Secretary of State Hull advised him against that course of action, he gave up the idea until the spring of 1940. Then Hull refused advice, and Watson sent the medal back in June 1940. Dehomag's management disapproved of Watson's action and considered separating from IBM. This occurred when Germany declared war on the United States in December 1941, and the German shareholders took custody of the Dehomag operation. But during World War II, IBM subsidiaries in occupied Europe never stopped delivery of punch cards to Dehomag, and documents uncovered show that senior executives at IBM world headquarters in New York took <b>great</b> <b>pains</b> <b>to</b> maintain legal authority over Dehomag's operations and assets through the personal intervention of IBM managers in neutral Switzerland, directed via personal communications and private letters.|$|E

Conrad's input proved useful in making the scenes set in weightlessness as convincing as the budget would allow. Assistance was also received from an aerospace manufacturer, the McDonnell Douglas Corporation, who provided stock footage of astronauts training in a water tank and received an on-screen credit on the first episode [...] "An Instinct for Murder".|$|E

500|$|As it was {{intended}} to be Nimoy's last portrayal of Spock, the actor was adamant that his appearance be faithful to the original 1960s Fred Phillips and Charlie Schram design of the character. Mills consulted photos from the original television series as reference, and created five ear sculptings before Nimoy was satisfied. The result was tall ears with the tips pointing forward—considerably different from Richard Snell's swept-back look for The Voyage Home. The character of Valeris was designed to be more ivory-hued than Spock's yellow tone, with sleeker eyebrows and a severe haircut favored by Meyer. [...] "We went to <b>great</b> <b>pains</b> <b>to</b> establish {{that this is the way}} a Vulcan woman—a sexy Vulcan woman—would look," [...] said Mills.|$|E
500|$|Warhol had a {{positive}} view of ordinary culture and felt the abstract expressionists had taken <b>great</b> <b>pains</b> <b>to</b> ignore the splendor of modernity. The Campbell's Soup Can series, along with his other series, provided him {{with a chance to}} express his positive view of modern culture. However, his deadpan manner endeavored to be devoid of emotional and social commentary. The work was intended to be without personality or individual expression. Warhol's view is encapsulated in the Time magazine description of the 'Slice of Cake School,' that [...] "... a group of painters have come to the common conclusion that the most banal and even vulgar trappings of modern civilization can, when transposed to canvas, become Art." ...|$|E
500|$|After Holmes {{resigned}} his professorship at Dartmouth, {{he composed}} {{a series of}} three lectures dedicated to exposing medical fallacies, or [...] "quackeries".

He deemed homeopathy, the subject of his third lecture, [...] "the pretended science" [...] that was a [...] "mingled mass of perverse ingenuity, of tinsel erudition, of imbecile credulity, and of artful misrepresentation, too often mingled in practice". In 1842, he published the essay [...] "Homeopathy and Its Kindred Delusions" [...] in which he again denounced the practice.|$|E
