5|$|Overall, {{the crew}} {{successfully}} completed all fifty-four {{of the planned}} mission test objectives. While the INSAT deployment was a success, the satellite had problems unfolding its solar array once in <b>geostationary</b> <b>orbit,</b> and was not fully operational {{until the middle of}} September. Once functional, however, it provided satisfactory service for seven years, returning 36,000 images of Earth and broadcasting television to thousands of remote Indian villages. The Payload Flight Test Article evaluation found that the Canadarm remote manipulator system was capable of moving bulky masses with some accuracy, to a precision of 5cm and one degree of alignment.|$|E
25|$|An {{additional}} {{advantage is}} that considerably less launch energy is needed to place a spacecraft into a Molniya orbit than into a <b>geostationary</b> <b>orbit.</b> Disadvantages are that, {{as opposed to a}} spacecraft in a <b>geostationary</b> <b>orbit,</b> the ground station needs a steerable antenna to track the spacecraft and that the spacecraft will pass the Van Allen radiation belt four times per day.|$|E

50|$|The Apollo program used parking orbits, for all {{the reasons}} {{mentioned}} above except those that pertain to <b>geostationary</b> <b>orbits.</b>|$|R
25|$|The same orbits, with slight adjustments, {{were also}} used by some Soviet spy satellites, with the apogee point over the {{continental}} United States. Although <b>geostationary</b> <b>orbits</b> are useful for observing the continental United States, Soviet sensor technology sometimes required high-contrast observing angles which could only be achieved from higher latitudes. One such example is the US-K early-warning satellite which watches for US missile launches, although improvements in these systems have since allowed them to move these to <b>geostationary</b> <b>orbits.</b>|$|R

25|$|Sky Muster II (NBN-Co 1B) was {{launched}} on 5 October 2016, it will operate in <b>geostationary</b> <b>orbit</b> of 145° East.|$|E
25|$|Satellites Radiosat 1 through Radiosat 3 fly in {{geosynchronous}} (not geostationary) Tundra orbits. Like the <b>geostationary</b> <b>orbit,</b> {{the tundra}} orbit has {{a period of}} 23 hours, 56 minutes (one sidereal day). Unlike the <b>geostationary</b> <b>orbit,</b> the tundra orbit is elliptical, not circular, and is inclined {{with respect to the}} equator rather than orbiting directly over it. The eccentric orbit ensures that each satellite spends about 16 hours of each day high over the continental United States. At least one satellite is always visible, with another often visible as well. The orbit's high inclination places apogee just west of Hudson Bay in Canada, providing a much higher elevation angle for most of the country than is possible from a <b>geostationary</b> <b>orbit.</b> This reduces blockage from tall buildings in urban areas, allowing a much smaller terrestrial repeater network than does sister network XM, which uses geostationary orbits.|$|E
25|$|The main {{advantage}} of locating a space power station in <b>geostationary</b> <b>orbit</b> {{is that the}} antenna geometry stays constant, and so keeping the antennas lined up is simpler. Another advantage is that nearly continuous power transmission is immediately available {{as soon as the}} first space power station is placed in orbit; other space-based power stations have much longer start-up times before they are producing nearly continuous power. A collection of LEO (Low Earth Orbit) space power stations has been proposed as a precursor to GEO (<b>Geostationary</b> <b>Orbit)</b> space-based solar power.|$|E
30|$|The Chinese BeiDou Navigation Satellite System (abbreviated as BDS, {{referred}} to as COMPASS previously) is currently providing continuous positioning, navigation, and timing (PNT) services to most areas of the Asian-Pacific. As of June 2017, BDS consists of 14 satellites providing PNT services, three satellites in medium earth orbits (MEO), six satellites in inclined <b>geostationary</b> <b>orbits</b> (IGSO), and five satellites in <b>geostationary</b> <b>orbits</b> (GEO) (CSNO 2013, Li et al. 2015). These satellites are all transmitting triple-frequency signals centered at B 1 (1561.098  MHz), B 2 (1207.14  MHz), and B 3 (1268.52  MHz).|$|R

50|$|Two {{versions}} of the Japanese H-IIA space rocket would have used one or two LRBs {{to be able to}} carry extra cargo to higher <b>geostationary</b> <b>orbits,</b> but it was replaced by the H-IIB.|$|R
50|$|In this approach, {{the launch}} vehicle places the {{satellite}} into a supersynchronous elliptical <b>Geostationary</b> transfer orbit,an <b>orbit</b> with a somewhat larger apogee {{than the more}} typical <b>Geostationary</b> transfer <b>orbit</b> (GTO) typically utilized for communication satellites.|$|R
50|$|Satellites in <b>geostationary</b> <b>orbits</b> are {{far enough}} away from Earth that {{communication}} latency becomes significant — {{about a quarter of a}} second for a trip from one ground-based transmitter to the satellite and back to another ground-based transmitter; close to half a second for a round-trip communication from one Earth station to another and then back to the first.|$|R
25|$|On June 8, 2006, Space Systems/Loral {{announced}} that it was awarded a contract for the fifth Sirius spacecraft. The new spacecraft features a nine-meter unfurlable reflector. The first four Sirius spacecraft used more traditional parabolic reflectors. The new satellite has been designed for <b>geostationary</b> <b>orbit,</b> unlike the other satellites in the constellation; the different orbit has the stated purpose of allowing for more consistent reception for fixed location users (many subscribers have reported having to regularly reposition their antennas for optimal reception). Radiosat 5 (FM-5) is in a <b>geostationary</b> <b>orbit</b> at 96 degrees west. It was launched June 30, 2009, and announced to be in service as of September 9, 2009.|$|E
25|$|Higher orbits include medium Earth orbit (MEO), {{sometimes}} called {{intermediate circular orbit}} (ICO), and further above, <b>geostationary</b> <b>orbit</b> (GEO). Orbits higher than low orbit can lead to early failure of electronic components due to intense radiation and charge accumulation.|$|E
25|$|A {{geostationary}} satellite is {{of special interest}} in this context. Unlike other objects in the sky which rise and set, an object in a <b>geostationary</b> <b>orbit</b> appears motionless in the sky, apparently defying gravity. In fact, {{it is in a}} circular equatorial orbit with a period of one day.|$|E

5000|$|GOES - The GOES {{spacecraft}} are satellites in <b>geostationary</b> <b>orbits</b> {{around the}} Earth that have measured the soft X-ray flux from the Sun since the mid-1970s, following {{the use of}} similar instruments on the Solrad satellites. GOES X-ray observations are commonly used to classify flares, with A, B, C, M, and X representing different powers of ten - an X-class flare has a peak 1-8 Å flux above 0.0001 W/m2.|$|R
25|$|On October 14, 2010, the XM-5 {{satellite}} {{was launched}} aboard an International Launch Services (ILS) Proton vehicle.

25|$|Satellites {{are used}} for many purposes.

Space stations and human spacecraft in orbit are also satellites. Satellite orbits vary greatly, depending on {{the purpose of the}} satellite, and are classified in a number of ways.

25|$|The Geosynchronous Satellite Launch Vehicle, usually {{known by}} its {{abbreviation}} GSLV, is an expendable launch system developed to enable India to launch its INSAT-type satellites into <b>geostationary</b> <b>orbit</b> and to make India less dependent on foreign rockets.

25|$|The Augmented Satellite Launch Vehicle, usually {{known by}} its {{abbreviation}} ASLV was a 5-stage solid propellant rocket with the capability of placing a 150kg satellite into Low Earth Orbit. This project was started by the ISRO during the early 1980s to develop technologies needed for a payload to be placed into a <b>geostationary</b> <b>orbit.</b> Its design was based on Satellite Launch Vehicle. The first launch test was held in 1987, and after that 3 others followed in 1988, 1992 and 1994, out of which only 2 were successful, before it was decommissioned.|$|E
