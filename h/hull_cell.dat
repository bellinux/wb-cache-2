50|$|Since 1975 ion {{chromatography}} {{has been widely}} used in many branches of industry. The main beneficial advantages are reliability, very good accuracy and precision, high selectivity, high speed, high separation efficiency, and low cost of consumables. The most significant development related to {{ion chromatography}} are new sample preparation methods; improving the speed and selectivity of analytes separation; lowering of limits of detection and limits of quantification; extending the scope of applications; development of new standard methods; miniaturization and extending {{the scope of the}} analysis of a new group of substances. Allows for quantitative testing of electrolyte and proprietary additives of electroplating baths. It is an advancement of qualitative <b>hull</b> <b>cell</b> testing or less accurate UV testing. Ions, catalysts, brighteners and accelerators can be measured. Ion exchange chromatography has gradually become a widely known, universal technique for the detection of both anionic and cationic species. Applications for such purposes have been developed, or are under development, for a variety of fields of interest, and in particular, the pharmaceutical industry. The usage of ion exchange chromatography in pharmaceuticals has increased in recent years, and in 2006, a chapter on ion exchange chromatography was officially added to the United States Pharmacopia-National Formulary (USP-NF). Furthermore, in 2009 release of the USP-NF, the United States Pharmacopia made several analyses of ion chromatography available using two techniques: conductivity detection, as well as pulse amperometric detection. Majority of these applications are primarily used for measuring and analyzing residual limits in pharmaceuticals, including detecting the limits of oxalate, iodide, sulfate, sulfamate, phosphate, as well as various electrolytes including potassium, and sodium. In total, the 2009 edition of the USP-NF officially released twenty eight methods of detection for the analysis of active compounds, or components of active compounds, using either conductivity detection or pulse amperometric detection.|$|E

50|$|Welding is {{the most}} {{important}} factor in ship building and should be performed by qualified welders in order to protect the ship structure. It is achieved by heating the surfaces to the point of melting using oxy-acetylene, electric arc, or other means, and uniting them by pressing, hammering, etc. But in shipyards, there are times when the welder has to crawl into a confined space and weld. Welding can produce toxic fumes such as Nitric Oxide, Nitrogen Dioxide, Carbon Monoxide, Phosgene, Hydrogen Fluoride, Carbon Dioxide can also result in serious damage to human health or death if ventilation is not present. A case study was performed to see where would be most effective place to exhaust the <b>hull</b> <b>cells</b> on the bulkhead in between two spaces using an air horn versus air with an electric blower. They used welders who were employees of the shipyard and asked them to weld in a specific space. One that had shipyard dilution ventilation(DV) and the other had local exhaust ventilation(LEV) then recorded to see which typed of ventilation worked the best. In the results, they found that local exhaust ventilation reduced particulate concentrations but also the efficiency of either method depended on equipment maintenance and their own work practices because everyone has a different way of getting things done.|$|R

50|$|The zinc-cerium {{redox flow}} battery was first {{proposed}} by Clarke and co-workers in 2004, {{which has been}} the core technology of Plurion Inc. (UK). In 2008, Plurion Inc. suffered a liquidity crisis and was under liquidation in 2010. However, the information of the experimental conditions and charge-discharge performance described in the early patents of Plurion Inc. are limited. Since the 2010s, the electrochemical properties and the characterisation of a zinc-cerium redox flow battery have been identified by the researchers of Southampton and Strathclyde Universities. During charge/discharge cycles at 50 mA cm−2, the coulombic and voltage efficiencies of the zinc-cerium redox flow battery were reported to be 92 and 68%, respectively. In 2011, a membraneless (undivided) zinc-cerium system based on low acid concentration electrolyte using compressed pieces of carbon felt positive electrode was proposed. Discharge cell voltage and energy efficiency were reported to be approximately 2.1 V and 75%, respectively. With such undivided configuration (single electrolyte compartment), self-discharge was relatively slow at low concentrations of cerium and acid. Major installation of the zinc-cerium redox flow battery was the > 2 kW testing facility in Glenrothes, Scotland, installed by Plurion Inc. The use of mixed acid electrolytes for the positive half-cell has been investigated as a mean to increase the kinetics of the cerium redox reaction in State Key Laboratory of Rare Earth Resource Utilization and the Jiangxi University of Science and Technology, China. Platinum-iridium coatings have shown the best performance as positive electrodes for the battery, while being less expensive than platinum electrodes. Charge-discharge of the system has been preliminarily simulated. Research on mixed acids continues and {{it has been shown that}} low concentrations of hydrochloric acid can improve the electrochemical response of the cerium reaction, while nitric acid additions had negative results. Hierarchical porous carbon as the positive electrode has yielded better performance than carbon felt in laboratory scale experiments. The zinc electrodeposition on the negative electrode has been studied using a <b>Hull</b> <b>cell.</b> Carbon paper has also been studied as an alternative material for the positive electrode. Graphene oxide-graphite composites have shown some promise as a better catalytic electrode material for the reaction of cerium in the positive electrolyte. A similar cerium-lead RFB has been proposed. Indium-modified electrodes have been suggested as an alternative to conventional graphitised carbon as negative electrodes. The Zn-Ce system has introduced the use of this acid to other flow batteries as a better alternative to sulphuric acid. The relationship between cell potential and current density has been estimated for a Zn-Ce unit flow cell. This permitted to rationalise the contribution of the thermodynamic, kinetic and ohmic components of the battery voltage and to assess the effect of increasing inter-electrode gap.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: Two {{electroplating}} {{test cells}} {{have been proposed}} and tested to analyze the performance of plating solutions by studying the reaction distribution on the cathode during deposition of copper electrolyte. The first one is a modified Mohler cell composed of a rectangular electrolytic cell with forced electrolyte flow and two flat electrodes (an insulating separator is inserted between the cathode and anode). This screen modifies the electric field distribution, and leads to a non-uniform current distribution or deposit thickness on the cathode panel. The other is a rotating cylinder <b>Hull</b> <b>cell</b> consisting of an inner rotating cylinder electrode coaxial with a stationary outer insulating tube to produce a non-uniform current distribution {{along the length of}} a cylinder cathode.

30|$|Many {{studies had}} {{indicated}} that BR-related genes regulated grain size through altering cell expansion or cell proliferation, for example: D 2 (Fang et al. 2016) and D 11 (Wu et al. 2016 a) regulated grain size by promoting cell expansion; XIAO (Jiang et al. 2012), SMG 1 (Duan et al. 2014) and DSG 1 (Liu et al. 2015) regulated grain size by affecting cell proliferation through cell cycle genes. Our {{results indicated that}} 08 SG 2 /OsBAK 1 positively regulates the development of spikelet <b>hull</b> by affecting <b>cell</b> proliferation (Fig.  2 h, j), consistent with this notion, the expression levels of some cell-cycle related genes were down-regulated in the 08 sg 2 mutant (Fig.  2 k), and this result {{is consistent with the}} cytological mechanism in internodes in the OsBAK 1 overexpression plants (Li et al. 2009).

30|$|Hulls, {{main parts}} of grains, {{affected}} grain size and BRR {{which were the}} main factors affecting the actual grain yield (Yang, 2009; Song et al., 2007; Xing and Zhang, 2010; Luo et al., 2014; Song et al., 2015). GW 2, a major grain width and weight QTL, increased grain width and weight by enlarging hulls. The NIL (GW 2) <b>hull</b> showed more <b>cells</b> than that of FAZ 1, and resulted in a higher brown rice yield and BRR (Song et al., 2007). ABNORMAL FLOWER AND DWARF 1 (AFD 1) determined plant height, floral development and grain yield. The thicker hulls in the afd 1 mutant caused reduced brown rice yield {{than that of the}} wild type. But, no differences were observed in the brown rice size and weight between the wild type and afd 1 mutant when parts of both hulls were removed (Ren et al., 2015). Meantime, our data also showed that brown rice of CJ 06 was thicker than that of TN 1 and CSSL 1 - 2 (Additional file 1 : Figure S 2). These findings suggested that the rice hull and brown rice thickness may be involved in regulation of brown rice yield and BRR. In the study, paraffin sections and SEM analysis revealed that the TN 1 hulls had larger nonsilicified and silicified cells, and thicker layers. The results indicated that <b>cell</b> size and <b>hull</b> layers may be important factors affecting the BRR. It provides very valuable information for cloning and functional analysis of the qBRR- 10 gene. Moreover, three more traits were detected in the present study, i.e., one for brown grain length/width ratio (qGL/W- 6), and two for grain weight (qGW- 9 and qGW- 10). The QTL on chromosome 6 had significant impact on grain length/width ratio, which had not been reported before. Thus, these QTLs identified in this study are very useful for studying the BRR and grain weight. The identification of qBRR- 10, qGL/W- 6, qGW- 9, and qGW- 10 will receive much attention because of their importance on improving milling quality and rice yield.|$|R
40|$|Research Doctorate - Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) Almost daily {{the role}} number of roles that {{microglia}} {{have been identified}} as playing a role in expands. Once considered to only act as the macrophages of the central nervous system, microglia are now recognised to be ‘master-orchestraters’ of events as diverse as neurogenesis, synaptic pruning, synaptogenesis, vascular remodeling, extracellular matrix remodeling, vascular surveillance and many others. Perhaps {{one of the most interesting}} and enigmatic features of microglia is their capacity to engage in rapid and profound structural reorganization. This ability has thus fascinated many researchers, a phenomenon that is only continued to grow in response to recent real time imaging of the cells in action. Most of is known about microglial structure has come from static two-dimensional images. Detailed morphological characterization of these cells in two dimensions, while significantly less glamorous, than real time multiphoton imaging has nevertheless proven to be an extremely reliable vehicle for revealing and characterizing the fundamental properties of state changes of these cells. Under normal conditions microglia are recognised to exist in the brain with relatively small somas and a number of thin tapering branches radiating out from the cell body. Often, although not always, these branches split and often split again in what is frequently referred to as their secondary and tertiary branching structures. Following exposure to severe environmental disturbances, microglia are known to engage in profound structural reorganization. The specific form that this reorganization takes is somewhat interventions specific but in many cases it will involve marked somal enlargement and significant process simplification and shortening. These changes are ultimately considered to be relevant and informative because they are known to be linked with changes in the specific functions engaged in by microglia. Chapter 2 : At the outset of my studies there had been no quantitative studies to what represented ‘normal’ microglial morphology within uninjured prefrontal cortex (PFC). The PFC is well documented to play a critical role in mood disturbance and our research group has found evidence that chronic stress induces significant changes in microglial activity in this region. Accordingly, the major aim of Chapter Two was to systematically examine the morphology of microglia (identified by ionized calcium-binding adaptor molecule- 1 (Iba- 1) labelling). Here I undertook many hundreds of manual reconstructions across the five cortical layers of the rat PFC. The reconstruction analysis was used to determine the morphometric parameters including the convex <b>hull</b> area, <b>cell</b> body perimeter, total length, total volume, number of processes, number of branch points, and the complexity of cell. Our results revealed that microglial morphology was consistent across all layers by demonstrating as ramified microglia, while there was a variation in cell size. I additionally determined the density of microglia and found no difference in anterior-posterior direction of the PFC. These findings confirmed that microglia represent a relatively homogenous within the healthy PFC. Chapter 3 : Several previous studies have linked expression of the purine ionotropic receptor P 2 X 7, which is primarily found on microglia, with major depression. As chronic stress is recognised to be a significant risk factor in the emergence of major depression. I decided to identify if chronic restraint stress was involved in changes in the expression of P 2 X 7 within the hippocampus. In this study, I utilized an analysis technique recently developed by our group known as cumulative threshold spectra (CTS) to identify if stress altered P 2 X 7 at any of three different time points: acute stress (1 session), chronic stress (21 sessions) and a chronic stress with 7 days recovery time. The findings of this work suggested that exposure to acute or chronic stress significantly reduced the expression of P 2 X 7 receptor within the hippocampus and that levels remained suppressed in recovery period. In addition, the comparative analysis on normalised data showed that the level of the P 2 X 7 reduction was significantly greater in the chronic stress relative to the acute stress group. Furthermore, I found that P 2 X 7 expression rebounded to baseline in 7 days recovery time. Collectively, these results provide the first evidence that chronic restraint stress produces markedly a reduction of the P 2 X 7 receptor within the hippocampus. Chapter 4 : In Chapter Four, I investigated how chronic stress influences the roles of glial cells (microglia and astrocytes) as it related to disturbances of glutamatergic signaling. Using immunohistochemical analysis, the results showed that there was a reduction in glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), a marker of astrocytes, in the hippocampus after exposure to chronic stress, while the expression of Iba- 1 was increased. In addition, I examined how these changes were associated with glutamatergic signalling proteins following chronic stress. Specifically I assessed changes in the expression of the astrocyte specific glutamate transporters EAAT 1 and EAAT 2. The proteins were observed to have opposition changes after stress with a increase in EAAT 1 and a decrease in EAAT 2 expression. Further, I measured the expression of related proteins such as vesicular glutamate transporter (VGLUT 1), which was increased and AMPA and NMDA subunits (GluA 1, GluA 2, GluN 1, GluN 2 A, GluN 2 B). The AMPA and NMDA subunits showed a complex pattern of changes, however, when taken together with the changes in VLGUT 1 and EAATs 1 and 2 are strongly suggestive of dramatic shift in glutamatergic activity. Together, these findings suggest that chronic stress-induced structural remodelling of astrocytes and microglia may be driven by alterations in glutamatergic neurotransmission. Chapter 5 : Besides the roles of microglia in response to chronic stress-induced mood disorder, previous studies have demonstrated that microglia appear to be the most important cell involved in inflammatory related mood disturbances. The administration of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) is well-validated model of immune challenge producing microglial activation and sickness behaviours in rodents and humans. Recently, these behaviours have become the representative indicator of how peripheral disturbances in immune signalling can disturb quite complex behaviours. Therefore, I examined the alterations of microglial structure within the PFC following the administration of LPS (100 µg/kg/i. p.) in adult male rats. Immunohistochemistry was conducted to analyse the changes in Iba- 1, a specific microglial marker, in the infralimbic and prelimbic of the PFC using a cumulative threshold spectra (CTS) analysis and digital reconstructions. Our results indicated that the somal area of was significantly enlarged, while cell processes became slightly shortened after LPS injection. This data is the first to demonstrate significant microglial alterations within the PFC following LPS administration. Collectively, the experiments clearly outline the complex nature of the structural changes that microglia can undergo in response to routine, yet severe, environmental challenges...|$|R

A suitable bath is reported on the basis of <b>Hull</b> <b>cell</b> studies, plating experiments, determination of alloy plating efficiency and composition of the plated alloy. Effects of operating parameters on deposition characteristics and deposit properties are also reporte...|$|E
40|$|Pulsed {{electrolysis}} {{of copper}} has been systematically investigated by electrodepositing copper from a copper sulfate bath. Pulse duty cycles of 5 to 80 percent, at frequencies from 10 to 100 Hz with current densities ranging from 2. 5 to 7. 5 A/dm 2 were employed. The appearance of <b>Hull</b> <b>Cell</b> panels with both direct current and pulsed current was recorded. The influence of pulsed current on current efficiency, cathode potential, and {{properties of the}} deposit, such as hardness and porosity, were studied and {{compared with the same}} characteristics obtained with conventional d-c plating...|$|E
40|$|The {{thesis is}} about the {{dynamics}} of the electrochemical removal of metal. First different removal processes and their dynamics are presented. Some dynamics of the removal of cobalt and the removal of steel in ferric chloride are described. Especially the non linear dynamics of electropolishing are discussed. The variable potential during electropolishing was examined. Pattern formation is described. The formation of fronts in the so called <b>Hull</b> <b>Cell</b> was observed. And the new micro-electropolishing process is presented. This process is based on the use of pulsed current in combination with a micro cathode...|$|E
40|$|Standard {{experimental}} {{procedures were}} adopted for the <b>Hull</b> <b>cell,</b> polarization, throwing power and current efficiency measurements. Zinc deposits obtained under {{each set of}} plating conditions were observed under a metallurgical microscope at high resolution. The zinc deposits obtained under optimum plating conditions were used to measure physical properties (hardness, internal strength, adhesion and porosity) {{as well as for}} outdoor exposure testing by salt spray. Anthranilic acid and formaldehyde are found to be effective brighteners for acid zinc sulfate. Optimum conditions and the properties of the deposit are discussed...|$|E
40|$|Maximum {{corrosion}} resistance among iron group alloys {{has been observed}} for 50 Ni 50 Fe and 70 C 030 Ni binary alloys depending upon deposit composition and microstructure, which are controlled by solution composition and deposition variables. Renewed interest has been shown {{on the development of}} environment-friendly electroplating baths enabling one to apply chromium-nickel coatings. Chromium-nickel-iron alloy plating from non-toxic acetate based trivalent electrolyte, has been examined under different <b>Hull</b> <b>cell</b> current values. The resulting deposits were examined for their elemental content, micro hardness and their surface topography with 5 EM. This alloy contains chromium 3...|$|E
40|$|Citrate, {{tartrate}} and gluconate {{are examined}} for their influence as additives to 3 M NaOH electrolyte {{for use with}} zinc. Solubility, turbidity and conductivity measurements are presented. Electrochemical oxidation and redeposition of zinc in the medium is investigated using cyclic voltammetry. Products of electrochemical reaction are analysed by IR and Raman spectroscopy. Tartrate and gluconate appear to produce micelles in the zincate medium whereas citrate appears to stabilize a polymeric structure in solution. <b>Hull</b> <b>cell</b> patterns of electroplating of zinc from zincate in presence of additives and morphology of the coatings by SEM pictures are also discussed...|$|E
