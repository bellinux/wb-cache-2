40|$|The {{tope shark}} (<b>Galeorhinus</b> <b>galeus</b> Linnaeus, 1758) is a temperate, coastal hound shark {{found in the}} Atlantic and Indo-Pacific oceans. In this study, the {{population}} structure of <b>Galeorhinus</b> <b>galeus</b> was determined across the entire Southern Hemisphere, where the species is heavily targeted by commercial fisheries, as well as locally, along the South African coastline. Analysis was conducted on a total of 185 samples using 19 microsatellite markers and a 671 bp fragment of the NADH dehydrogenase subunit 2 (ND 2) gene. Across the Southern Hemisphere, three geographically distinct clades were recovered, including one from South America (Argentina, Chile), one from Africa (all the South African collections) and an Australia-New Zealand clade. Nuclear data revealed significant population subdivisions (FST = 0. 192 to 0. 376, p< 0. 05) indicating limited gene flow for tope sharks across ocean basins. Marked population connectivity was however evident across the Indian Ocean based on Bayesian clustering analysis. More locally in South Africa, F-statistics and multivariate analysis supported moderate to high gene flow across the Atlantic/Indian Ocean boundary (FST = 0. 035 to 0. 044, p< 0. 05), with exception of samples from Struisbaai and Port Elizabeth which differed significantly from the rest. Discriminant and Bayesian clustering analysis indicated admixture in all sampling populations, decreasing from west to east, corroborating possible restriction to gene flow across regional oceanographic barriers. Mitochondrial sequence data recovered seven haplotypes (h = 0. 216, π = 0. 001) for South Africa, with one major haplotype shared by 87 % of the individuals {{and at least one}} private haplotype for each sampling location except Port Elizabeth.

Because shark lactate concentration can exceed the upper detection limit of the portable analysers, which were designed for mammalian use, a method for dealing with values greater than the maximum detection limit was evaluated. Whole-blood diluted by 50 % with acidified saline solution, tap water and distilled water gave measured values of 55, 56 and 52 %, respectively, of the original values, allowing accurate estimation of concentrations exceeding the upper detection limit of the analyser.

40|$|Artisanal {{fisheries}} in Mexico account for approximately 40 % {{of the total}} national catch. In 2009, Baja California Sur (BCS) had the second largest catch of elasmobranchs on the Mexican Pacific coast. This paper characterizes and describes the artisanal elasmobranch fishery of Pacific coast of BCS from 2000 to 2010. Sixty artisanal camps were documented, of which 45 targeted elasmobranchs, using primarily gillnets and longlines. We identified 52 elasmobranch species. Gillnetting accounted for 73. 5 % of the fishing effort and most frequently captured Rhinobatos productus, Mustelus henlei and Myliobatis californica. Longline fishing accounted for 26. 5 % of effort, most frequently capturing Prionace glauca and Isurus oxyrinchus. The prevalence of juveniles of several species (e. g., Cephaloscyllium ventriosum, <b>Galeorhinus</b> <b>galeus,</b> Isurus oxyrinchus, and Myliobatis californica) within landings suggests that fishing effort may be opportunistically directed at breeding or nursery areas.

40|$|During 1994 – 96, an {{experimental}} longline fishery for tope shark (<b>Galeorhinus</b> <b>galeus)</b> {{was carried out}} in the Nuevo Gulf of northern Patagonia and, in the summers of 2000 – 2001 and 2002, three boats conducted an exploratory commercial fishery for this species, accompanied by a scientific monitoring program. This paper summarizes the results of these fishing trials, and provides information on the biology of tope shark. Catches were highest from February to April, when tope shark represented 36 % of the total fish caught, and elephant fish (Callorhynchus callorhynchus) and argentine hake (Merluccius hubbsi) accounted for 33 % and 23 %, respectively. Tope shark arriving in northern Patagonian waters during the summer are primarily mature males, immature and maturing females in their first and second non-gravid year. No gravid females were caught. These fish are part of the South-western Atlantic stock, which shows signs of over-exploitation, so we suggest that any longline fishery in Patagonia should remain on a small scale.

Counter-intuitively concentrating a fishery on a few year-classes of pups, juveniles or sub-adults proves to be a robust management strategy for elasmobranch fisheries as long as the means exist for protecting adults from fishing mortality.

40|$|The school shark (<b>Galeorhinus</b> <b>galeus)</b> {{resource}} off southern Australia is {{assessed by}} use of an assessment approach that takes account of the spatial structure of the population. The population dynamics model underlying the assessment considers the spatial {{as well as the}} age-specific characteristics of school shark. It allows for a series of fisheries (each based on a different gear type), explicitly models the pupping/recruitment process, and allows for multiple stocks. The values for the parameters of this model are determined by fitting it to catch-rate data and information from tagging studies. The point estimates of the pup production at the start of 1997 range from 12 % to 18 % of the pre-exploitation equilibrium size, depending on the specifications of the assessment. Allowing for spatial structure and incorporating tag release–recapture data lead to reduced uncertainty compared with earlier assessments. The status of the resource, as reflected by the ratio of present to virgin pup production and total (1 +) biomass, is sensitive to the assumed level of movement between the stocks in New Zealand and those in Australia, with lower values corresponding to higher levels of movement...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Globally, {{sharks are}} {{impacted}} {{by a wide}} range of human activities, resulting in many populations being depleted. Trophy large-sized sharks of the Argentinean coast, the sand-tiger Carcharias taurus, the copper Carcharhinus brachyurus and the sevengill shark Notorynchus cepedianus are under intense sport and artisanal fishing since the 50 's decade. However, the current and historical information for the assessment of its populations status is scarce. The aim of this work was to analyze the status of conservation of these species through the gathering of expert fishermen knowledge (FK) on semi-structured interviews. Abundance variation perception between {{the beginning and the end}} of fishermen careers revealed a critical status for the species study (means variation between - 77 and - 90 %). Furthermore, a best day's catch analysis reinforce this result in the case of the sand tiger shark.

40|$|In {{order to}} trace their feeding habits, stable carbon and {{nitrogen}} isotope ratios (d 15 N and d 13 C), {{as well as}} trace metal concentrations (Zn, Cd, Fe, Cu, Se and Hg) were analysed in the tissues of five commercial shark species from the Celtic Sea: the tope shark <b>Galeorhinus</b> <b>galeus,</b> the black-mouthed catshark Galeus melastomus, the starry smooth hound Mustelus asterias, the spiny dogfish Squalus acanthias and the lesser-spotted dogfish Scyliorhinus canicula. Our results were compared to previously described stomach contents and isotopic composition of potential preys. Isotopic ratio d 15 N suggested that tope sharks fed at a higher trophic level (16. 7 ‰ in the muscle) than the other species, reflecting its piscivorous diet. The lower values of spiny dogfish (11. 6 ‰ in the muscle) might be explained, amongst other things, by either its migratory behaviour or its preference for preys from lower trophic levels. Cd and Hg were correlated with isotopic ratios d 13 C and d 15 N, and were shown to be diet-related whereas Zn, Fe and Cu seemed much more linked to species-specific metabolism. Although this multidisciplinary approach is revealed as {{a useful tool for}} the study of shark ecology, the lack of known trophic fractionation suggests that isotopic data be compared to traditional diet analyses...|$|E

Results were compared to Department of Fisheries catch records compiled from fishers’ monthly catch returns. Discarded bycatch of several species was estimated by bootstrapping their observed catch rates. Dusky shark, Carcharhinus obscurus, gummy shark, Mustelus antarcticus, whiskery shark, Furgaleus macki, and Port Jackson shark, Heterodontus portusjacksoni, were identified as the main components of the fisheries’ catch, however, catches were found to vary regionally. School shark, <b>Galeorhinus</b> <b>galeus,</b> dogfish of the family Squalidae and the sandbar shark, Carcharhinus plumbeus, were regionally important in the south-east, mid-southern and west coast regions, respectively.

Estimating catches from research catch per unit effort data indicated that catches of secondary elasmobranch species may have been underreported in commercial fishing returns.

Gillnet mesh-size had major effects on catch composition and catch rate, whereas gillnet hanging ratio, hook-size, hook shank-length and hook-spacing had minor effects. The gillnets and longlines were much more effective at catching chondrichthyans than teleosts, and catches of species of cephalopoda, bivalvia, gastropoda, mammalia, aves and reptilia were negligible. Any reduction in the present legal minimum mesh-size of 6 inch the shark fishery would markedly increase by-catch.

School shark (<b>Galeorhinus</b> <b>galeus)</b> have suffered significant stock declines in Australia; however, recent stock assessments suggest the population may have stabilized {{and the protection of}} closed nursery areas has been identified as a key management strategy to rebuilding their numbers. Young-of-the-year (YOY) and juvenile G. galeus were acoustically tagged and monitored to determine ontogenetic differences in residency and seasonal use of an important protected nursery area (Shark Refuge Area or SRA) in southeastern Tasmania. Both YOY and juvenile G. galeus showed a distinct seasonal pattern of occurrence in the SRA with most departing the area during winter and only a small proportion of YOY (33 %) and no juveniles returning the following spring, suggesting areas outside the SRA may also be important during these early life-history stages. While these behaviors confirm SRAs continue to function as essential habitat during G. galeus early life history, evidence of YOY and juveniles emigrating from these areas within their first 1 - 2 years and the fact that few YOY return suggest that these areas may only afford protection for a more limited amount of time than previously thought.

As commercial landings data are usually not sufficient for the monitoring and assessment of elasmobranchs, fisheries-independent data, geostatistics and Geographic Information Systems were used to investigate the spatio-temporal patterns of sharks (6 species), skates (9 species) and stingray in the eastern English Channel. Temporal trends in relative abundance and distributions of total-length frequencies were investigated using data collected over 21 yr from an annual survey using a Grande Ouverture Verticale (GOV) trawl. Temporal trends in relative abundance were examined qualitatively {{in relation to the}} reported conservation status for the various species. Most individuals captured for 7 of the species were immature. The GOV trawl was more efficient at sampling demersal sharks than batoids (skates and rays), especially small-sized batoids.

The more abundant species displayed significantly larger patch diameters. Three shark species (Scyliorhinus canicula, S. stellaris and <b>Galeorhinus</b> <b>galeus)</b> were found to be spatially segregated by sex. The shark species tended to occur in the deeper waters of the area, while skates were found to be more coastal in their distribution.

In this paper we report information related to sharks by-catches in the Spanish Mediterranean swordfish longline fishery. The data {{used in this study}} were collected by observers on board of commercial vessels operating with surface long line from 1997 to 1999. In the Western Mediterranean Sea, swordfish fishing area extends from the Straits of Gibraltar to latitude 07 ºE; and from longitude 42 ºN to the limit of the Moroccan and Algerian territorial waters. The shark species caught during the study period were the blue shark, the shortfin mako, common thresher shark, Sphyrna zygaena and <b>Galeorhinus</b> <b>galeus.</b> The main species in the catches was the blue shark followed by the shortfin mako. The blue shark size composition shows a high importance of juveniles. Only a few specimens are mature ones and only one female was pregnant. The shortfin mako size composition shows a total dominance of juvenile specimens. These biological aspects and some other ones will be discussed in this report. Fisheries effects on shark population and shark life history are suggested as causes of commercial pelagic shark stock characteristics in the Spanish Mediterranean waters...|$|E
40|$|Tope shark (<b>Galeorhinus</b> <b>galeus)</b> and {{thornback ray}} (Raja clavata) {{are the two}} most {{captured}} elasmobranch species by the Azorean bottom longline fishery. In order to better understand the trophic dynamics of these species in the Azores, the diets of thornback ray and tope shark caught in this area during 1996 and 1997 were analyzed to describe feeding patterns and to investigate the effect of sex, size, and depth and area of capture on diet. Thornback rays fed mainly upon fishes and reptants, but also upon polychaetes, mysids, natant crustaceans, isopods, and cephalopods. In the Azores, this species preyed more heavily upon fish compared with the predation patterns described in other areas. Differences in the diet may be due to differences in the environments (e. g. in the Azores, seamounts and oceanic islands are the major topographic features, whereas in all other studies, continental shelves have been the major topographic feature). No differences were observed in the major prey consumed between the sexes or between size classes (49 − 60, 61 − 70, 71 − 80, and 81 − 93 cm TL). Our study indicates that rays inhabiting different depths and areas (coastal or offshore banks) prey upon different resources. This appears {{to be related to the}} relative abundance of prey with habitat. Tope sharks were found to prey almost exclusively upon teleost fish: small shoaling fish, mainly boarfish (Capros aper) and snipefish (Macroramphosus scolopax), were the most frequent prey. This study illustrates that thornback rays and tope sharks are top predators in waters off the Azores...|$|E
40|$|The {{demersal}} fish stocks in southern Brazil were assessed from landings and catchper-unit effort data trends between 1975 and 1994, available {{information on the}} life history patterns, and population dynamics {{of the most important}} species. The fishing gears, mostly otter and pair bottom trawls in the 1970 s, diversified towards double-rig trawls for fish and shrimp and bottom gill nets in the mid 1980 s, and bottom longlines in the upper slope in the early 1990 s. There were also some less successful attempts with traps for fish and crabs. The {{demersal fish}}eries are more intensive in winter when migratory species move northward, associated with the seasonal displacement of the western boundary of the Subtropical Convergence. Landings between 1975 and 1994 were mostly of sciaenid fishes (> 70 %) and elasmobranchs (10 %) and oscillated around 59 000 t. There was not a decrease in total landings but a shift from more to less exploited stocks. Since 1989, 4 % of the landings came from depleted stocks of Pagrus pagrus (L.), Netuma barba (Lacépède), Pogonias cromis (L.) and Rhinobatos horkelli (Muller & Henle); 37 % from overexploited stocks: Micropogonias furnieri (Desmarest), Paralichthys patagonicus Jordan, Squatina guggenheim Marini, and <b>Galeorhinus</b> <b>galeus</b> (L.); 24 % from heavily exploited stocks of Umbrina canosai Berg, and Macrodon ancylodon (Bloch & Schneider); and 35 % of Cynoscion guatucupa (Cuvier) and small stocks with unclear status. The demersal fisheries are virtually unmanaged and future landings are expected to decrease if fishing pressure remains high. Effective management will require the participation of all three countries in the region because most of the stocks fished in southern Brazil are shared with Uruguay and Argentina...|$|E
40|$|The school shark, <b>Galeorhinus</b> <b>galeus,</b> is {{commonly}} captured off the Maghreb shore along the Algerian and Tunisian coasts {{of the southern}} Mediterranean. Of 517 specimens collected during more than twenty years, the smallest adult male was 1225 mm total length (TL) and weighed 11 580 g, the largest adult male was 1580 mm and weighed 18 000 g, and the heaviest male was 1570 mm and weighed 19 900 g. All males above 1260 mm TL were adult. Adult females were 1400 - 1900 mm TL. The smallest pregnant female was 1400 mm TL and carried developing embryos. The largest female was 1990 mm TL and weighed 27 900 g. Females were generally heavier than males, {{but there was no}} significant difference between males and females in mass versus total length relationship. Two ovulation and two pupping seasons occurred in winter and in spring. Gestation was estimated at twelve months, with most females appearing to reproduce in alternate years. The diameter of the largest yolky oocytes ranged 43 - 47 mm (mean 44. 7 ± 1. 8) and the mass ranged 45 - 52 g (mean 47. 9 ± 2. 2). Both uteri were compartmentalized into chambers and a single embryo developed in each chamber. Length and weight at birth, based on near-term embryos, were estimated at 240 - 320 mm TL and 88 - 109 g. The chemical balance of development, based on the mean dry mass of the largest yolky oocytes and of near-term fetuses, was about 1, showing that G. galeus can be considered as an incipient histotrophic species. Ovarian fecundity was higher than uterine fecundity. Litter sizes ranged 8 - 41. Males generally outnumbered females, especially among free-swimming adult specimens...|$|E
40|$|Shark fins {{have become}} a highly valued {{commodity}} with the major Asian fin-trade centres supplied from global sources, including Chile. With growing concerns about the resilience of shark populations to heavy fishing pressure, {{there is a need}} for better information on shark landings to aid management efforts. In the widespread absence of shark landing records especially by species, monitoring the fin trade has been proposed as a way to assess species exploitation levels. Here, the first species assessment of the Chilean shark-fin trade was provided. The goals of this study were to (1) determine the species composition and relative species proportion of sharks utilized in the fin trade, (2) determine the relationship between fin trader market names and species and (3) assess trader accuracy in identifying shark fin species based on fin photographs. Fins were analysed from two different fin drying facilities (n = 654) (secaderos) and two fin-storage warehouses (n = 251). In contrast to official government landing records that only document four species in the landings, molecular species identification of the fins demonstrated that at least 10 pelagic shark species are present in the north-central Chilean shark fin trade: Alopias superciliosus, Alopias vulpinus,Carcharhinus obscurus, <b>Galeorhinus</b> <b>galeus,</b> Isurus oxyrinchus, Isurus paucus, Lamna nasus,Prionace glauca, Sphyrna lewini, Sphyrna zygaena. The species composition of the fins from the secaderos was P. glauca (83 · 9 %), I. oxyrinchus (13 · 6 %), L. nasus (1 · 7 %) and A. superciliosus(0 · 2 %). There was generally good agreement between market names and single shark species for the trade categories ‘Azulejo’, ‘Tiburon’, ‘Tintorera’, ‘Cola de zorro’ and ‘Martillo’. In contrast, the market category ‘Carcharhinus’ consisted of a mixture of at least five species. The molecular results also identified two species (S. lewini and I. paucus) not previously recorded in Chilean waters. The fin identification survey given to nine regional traders demonstrated that they were highly accurate in recognizing pictures of fins from P. glauca and I. oxyrinchus. The overall strong concordance between market categories and fins from single species and the trader accuracy in survey fin identification suggests that monitoring the Chilean fin trade by market names will provide a reasonably accurate picture of the volume of sharks landed by species...|$|E
40|$|Area {{closures}} {{have become}} increasingly popular {{in the management of}} marine resources and in helping to rebuild overexploited species, yet their effectiveness rely on a sound understanding of key animal behaviours such as movement and residency, which for many highly mobile species remains largely unknown. The nursery areas of school shark (<b>Galeorhinus</b> <b>galeus)</b> have been protected throughout southern Australia since the 1960 s in an effort to re-build severely overfished stocks. Only recently have there been signs of recovery in the population, however, a limited understanding of how and when G. galeus utilise protected nurseries makes it difficult to evaluate the role and effectiveness of these areas in current stock re-building and management strategies. Throughout this thesis, acoustic telemetry and stable isotope analysis together with more traditional catch rate surveys are used in a series of studies to address these limitations in our current understanding of G. galeus early life history, by examining the population dynamics and ecology of this overfished species and several other chondrichthyan species in a protected nursery area in southeast Tasmania. The first seasonal longline fishing surveys since the 1990 s revealed young-of-the-year (YOY) and juvenile G. galeus continue to occupy protected nursery areas during summer and autumn, {{as was the case in}} the 1990 s. However, longline catch rates indicated that abundances of YOY G. galeus may have increased or at least have remained stable since sampling in 1991 - 97, but are likely still below those of historic handline catches in 1947 - 52. A re-analysis of historic research survey data indicated that variations in YOY abundance in this nursery reflected modelled stock declines through the history of the fishery, suggesting that continued monitoring of YOY abundances may provide an alternative to fishery dependent tools for monitoring trends in overall stock recovery. Acoustic telemetry was used to better understand ontogenetic differences in site fidelity, habitat preferences and seasonal use of protected nursery areas by YOY and juvenile (1 +) G. galeus. Both age classes showed a distinct seasonal pattern of occurrence in the refuge area with most departing the area during winter and only some YOY returning the following spring. Whilst nursery areas continue to function and provide important habitat for the offspring of G. galeus, evidence of YOY and juveniles emigrating from these areas within their first 1 - 2 years and the fact that few YOY (33...|$|E
40|$|PublishedJournal ArticleThis is {{the final}} version of the article. Available from Wiley Open Access via the DOI in this record. Shark take, driven by vast demand for meat and fins, is increasing. We set out to gain {{insights}} into the impact of small-scale longline fisheries in Peru. Onboard observers were used to document catch from 145 longline fishing trips (1668 fishing days) originating from Ilo, southern Peru. Fishing effort is divided into two seasons: targeting dolphinfish (Coryphaena hippurus; December to February) and sharks (March to November). A total of 16, 610 sharks were observed caught, with 11, 166 identified to species level. Of these, 70. 6 % were blue sharks (Prionace glauca), 28. 4 % short-fin mako sharks (Isurus oxyrinchus), and 1 % were other species (including thresher (Alopias vulpinus), hammerhead (Sphyrna zygaena), porbeagle (Lamnus nasus), and other Carcharhinidae species (Carcharhinus brachyurus, Carcharhinus falciformis, <b>Galeorhinus</b> <b>galeus).</b> Mean ± SD catch per unit effort of 33. 6 ± 10. 9 sharks per 1000 hooks was calculated for the shark season and 1. 9 ± 3. 1 sharks per 1000 hooks were caught in the dolphinfish season. An average of 83. 7 % of sharks caught (74. 7 % blue sharks; 93. 3 % mako sharks) were deemed sexually immature and under the legal minimum landing size, which for species exhibiting k-selected life history traits can result in susceptibility to over exploitation. As these growing fisheries operate along the entire Peruvian coast and may catch millions of sharks per annum, we conclude that their continued expansion, along with ineffective legislative approaches resulting in removal of immature individuals, has the potential to threaten the sustainability of the fishery, its target species, and ecosystem. There is a need for additional monitoring and research to inform novel management strategies for sharks while maintaining fisher livelihoods.
