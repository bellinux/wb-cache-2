2500|$|According to a 2002 {{report by}} staff from the Yemeni Environment Protection Agency, there were 10 {{wastewater}} treatment plants in Yemen {{at the time in}} Sana’a, Taiz, Ibb, Hajaa, Aden, Amran, Al Hodaida, Dammar, Yarem, and Radaa. Most of the plants use the stabilization pond technology, a low-cost technology particularly suitable for a hot climate. Some use Imhoff tanks or the activated sludge procedure commonly used in many developed countries. While data on the quality of treated effluent are limited, those data that are available show that the <b>effluent</b> <b>of</b> at least two plants complies with the relatively lenient national standard of 150mg/l of Biological oxygen demand, a measure of organic pollution. However, none of the four analyzed plants complied with the standard for fecal coliform, a measure of biological contamination. Reuse of treated and untreated wastewater in agriculture is common in Yemen. Wastewater from hospitals and medical laboratories is discharged into the sewer system, but cannot be adequately treated in the existing municipal {{wastewater treatment plants}}. The largest wastewater treatment plant in the country, located in Sana'a, was completed in 2000, but it had to be upgraded between 2003 and 2005 due to [...] "deficiencies in its operation, unacceptable odor emissions, and inadequate management of the generated sludge".|$|E
