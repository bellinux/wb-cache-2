5|$|Alienation is {{a shooter}} and {{role-playing}} video game developed by Housemarque {{and published by}} Sony Interactive Entertainment. It was released in April 2016 for PlayStation 4. The game is an isometric twin-stick shooter in which one to four players defend themselves against an alien invasion on Earth through increasingly-difficult levels. Players can choose one of three character classes, <b>each</b> <b>with</b> <b>its</b> own abilities. Players can upgrade their weapons with collectables, known as upgrade cores.|$|E
5|$|At the {{outbreak}} of the French Revolution, much of modern-day Germany and Austria were part of the Holy Roman Empire which had become a loose federation of kingdoms, principalities, free cities, bishoprics and other fiefdoms, <b>each</b> <b>with</b> <b>its</b> own system of measurement, though in most cases such system were loosely derived from the Carolingian system instituted by Charlemagne a thousand years earlier.|$|E
5|$|Belgrade has {{a special}} {{administrative}} status within Serbia {{and it is one}} of five statistical regions of Serbia. Its metropolitan territory is divided into 17 municipalities, <b>each</b> <b>with</b> <b>its</b> own local council. City of Belgrade covers 3.6% of Serbia's territory, and around 24% of the country's population lives within its administrative limits. It is classified as a Beta- Global City.|$|E

5|$|In 2012, a Kickstarter {{campaign}} for OverClocked ReMix was funded at $153,633 {{for the creation}} of a multiple CD album of remixes of the music from Final Fantasy VI. Andrew Aversa directed the creation of the album, Balance and Ruin, which contains 74 tracks from 74 artists, <b>each</b> <b>with</b> <b>its</b> own unique style. The album is free and available at the OverClocked ReMix website.|$|E
5|$|Organized into {{separate}} departments, <b>each</b> <b>with</b> <b>its</b> own chief reviewer, the Analytical Review focused on politics, philosophy, natural history, and literature. To promote a disinterested air, its reviewers were anonymous, signing {{their work with}} pseudonymous initials. Nevertheless, the journal recruited several prominent writers, such as the poet William Cowper, the moralist William Enfield, the physician John Aikin and the polemicist Mary Wollstonecraft.|$|E

5|$|The SS {{transfer}} the Jews {{to one of}} two ghettos, <b>each</b> <b>with</b> <b>its</b> own council or Judenrat. Eliezer's house on a corner of Serpent Street was in the larger ghetto in the town centre, so his family was able to stay at home, though the windows on the non-ghetto side had to be boarded up.|$|E
5|$|The {{area around}} Lulworth Cove {{contains}} a fossil forest, and 71 different rock strata {{have been identified}} at Lyme Regis, <b>each</b> <b>with</b> <b>its</b> own species of ammonite. The fossil collector Mary Anning lived here and her major discoveries of marine reptiles and other fossils were made {{at a time when}} the study of palaeontology was just starting to develop. The Charmouth Heritage Coast Centre provides information on the heritage coast, and the whole length of the site can be visited via the South West Coast Path.|$|E
5|$|The city's {{appearance}} {{today is}} shaped by the key role it has played as a regional centre for centuries. Copenhagen has a multitude of districts, <b>each</b> <b>with</b> <b>its</b> distinctive character and representing its own period. Other distinctive features of Copenhagen include the abundance of water, its many parks, and the bicycle paths that line most streets.|$|E

5|$|After the {{successful}} {{invasion of the}} Sassanid Persian province of Iraq, Caliph Abu Bakr sent an expedition to invade the Levant (Roman Syria). The invasion was {{to be carried out}} by four corps, <b>each</b> <b>with</b> <b>its</b> own assigned targets. The Byzantines responded to this threat by concentrating their units at Ajnadyn (a place in Palestine, probably al-Lajjun) from different garrisons. This move tied down the Muslim troops at border regions, as with this large force at their rear, Muslim armies were no longer free to march to central or northern Syria.|$|E
5|$|An example {{may be a}} {{local school}} system in the United States. It {{receives}} {{a grant from the}} its local state government to support a new special education initiative, another grant from the federal government for a school lunch program, and an annuity to award teachers working on research projects. At periodic intervals, the school system needs to generate a report to the state about the special education program, a report to a federal agency about the school lunch program, and a report to another authority about the research program. Each of these programs has its own unique reporting requirements, so the school system needs a method to separately identify the related revenues and expenditures. This is done by establishing separate funds, <b>each</b> <b>with</b> <b>its</b> own chart of accounts.|$|E
5|$|Buildings {{from most}} of the {{architectural}} periods of the United Kingdom can be seen throughout Bristol. Parts of the fortified city and castle date back to the medieval era, as do some churches dating from the 12th century onwards. Outside the historical city centre there are several large Tudor mansions built for wealthy merchants. Almshouses and public houses of the same period survive, intermingled with areas of more recent development. Several Georgian-era squares were laid out for the enjoyment of the middle class. As the city grew, it merged with its surrounding villages, <b>each</b> <b>with</b> <b>its</b> own character and centre, often clustered around a parish church.|$|E

5|$|By {{agreement}} among the Allied nations, in March 1942 the Pacific theatre was divided into two separate commands, <b>each</b> <b>with</b> <b>its</b> own commander-in-chief. The South West Pacific Area, which included Australia, Indonesia, and the Philippines came under General Douglas MacArthur as supreme commander. Most of the remainder, known as the Pacific Ocean Areas, came under Admiral Chester W. Nimitz. There was no overall commander, and no authority capable of resolving competing claims for resources, setting priorities, or shifting resources from one command to the other. Such decisions {{had to be made}} on the basis of compromise, cooperation and consensus.|$|E
5|$|By the 11th century, the Muslim {{world had}} {{developed}} four major Sunni schools of Islamic jurisprudence (or fiqh), <b>each</b> <b>with</b> <b>its</b> own interpretations of Sharia: Hanbali, Maliki, Shafi and Hanafi. In Arabia, {{a preference for}} the Hanbali school was advocated by the Wahhabi movement, founded in the 18th century. Wahhabism, a strict form of Sunni Islam, {{was supported by the}} Saudi royal family (the Al Saud) and is now dominant in Saudi Arabia. From the 18th century, the Hanbali school therefore predominated in Nejd and central Arabia, the heartland of Wahhabi Islam. In the more cosmopolitan Hejaz, in the west of the peninsula, both the Hanafi and Shafi schools were followed.|$|E
5|$|By the 15th century English chivalric {{ideas of}} selfless {{service to the}} king had been corrupted. Armed forces were mostly raised through musters in {{individual}} estates; every able-bodied man had to respond to his lord's call to arms, and each noble had exclusive authority over his militia. Although a king could raise personal militia from his lands, he could only muster a significantly large army through {{the support of his}} nobles. Richard, like his predecessors, had to win over these men by granting gifts and maintaining cordial relationships. Powerful nobles could demand greater incentives to remain on the liege's side or else they might turn against him. Three groups, <b>each</b> <b>with</b> <b>its</b> own agenda, stood on Bosworth Field: Richard III and his Yorkist army; his challenger, Henry Tudor, who championed the Lancastrian cause; and the fence-sitting Stanleys.|$|E

5|$|Cerebrates are {{secondary}} {{agents in}} the Zerg Swarm, each of which commands an individual brood of Zerg that possesses a distinct tactical role within the hierarchy. Alongside the Overmind, the cerebrates are the only Zerg with full sapience, <b>each</b> <b>with</b> <b>its</b> own personality and methods, although they are genetically incapable of disobeying the Overmind. Cerebrates can be reincarnated by the Overmind upon death, though dark templar energies are capable of preventing this. The death of a cerebrate causes the Overmind to lose control of its respective brood, which will then run amok.|$|E
5|$|Georgian English {{landscape}} gardens, such as West Wycombe and Stowe, {{are arranged}} as a walk or series of walks {{that take the}} visitor through a range of locations, <b>each</b> <b>with</b> <b>its</b> own specific character and separate from the last. Planting and {{the shape of the}} landscape is used, alongside follies and man-made water features, to create pleasant vistas and set pieces centred on a building, straight avenue, serpentine walk, or viewpoint. In the later years of the 18th century, the 5,000acres (20km²) of grounds were extended to the east, towards the nearby town of High Wycombe, and Humphrey Repton completed the creation of the gardens, until they appeared much as they do today.|$|E
5|$|Helping Alisia in her quest are her pet monsters. These creatures {{fly around}} the heroine on their own, attacking her foes, and {{blocking}} enemy attacks from hitting her. There are four pets, <b>each</b> <b>with</b> <b>its</b> own type of attack. The Dragon Frye spits fireballs, and the Boomerang Lizard hurls boomerangs. The Thunder Raven emits a thunder blast that affects enemies across the screen, and the Ball O' Fire burns enemies on contact.
