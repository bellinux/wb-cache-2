25|$|There {{are three}} primary classifications of heat {{exchangers}} {{according to their}} flow arrangement. In parallel-flow heat exchangers, the two fluids enter the exchanger at the same end, and travel in {{parallel to one another}} to the other side. In counter-flow heat exchangers the fluids enter the exchanger from opposite ends. The counter current design is the most efficient, in that it can transfer the most heat from the <b>heat</b> (<b>transfer)</b> <b>medium</b> per unit mass {{due to the fact that}} the average temperature difference along any unit length is higher. See countercurrent exchange. In a cross-flow heat exchanger, the fluids travel roughly perpendicular to one another through the exchanger.|$|E

Although a ground heat exchanger requires a higher initial capital cost, the annual running costs are lower, because well-designed ground source heat pump systems operate more efficiently because they start with a warmer source temperature than the air in winter.|$|E

30|$|Natural {{convection}} in fluids {{has been}} a topic of interest for researchers like Nield and Bejan [1], Pop and Ingham [2], Ingham and Pop [3], Vafai [4, 5], Vadasz [6], due to its appearance in industry and machineries where <b>heat</b> <b>transfer</b> is encountered. In the present scenario where the focus has shifted from ordinary fluids to nanofluids {{to be used as}} <b>heat</b> <b>transfer</b> <b>mediums,</b> the phenomena needs to be critically studied for them [7]. Accordingly, natural convection has been studied in nanofluids by Buongiorno [8], Tzou [9, 10], Kim et al. [11 - 13], and based on these results in the current decade by Nield and Kuznetsov [14], Kuznetsov and Nield [15] for the Horton-Rogers-Lapwood Problem of onset of thermal instability in a porous medium saturated by a nanofluid, using Darcy and Brinkman models, respectively, and incorporating the effects of Brownian motion and thermophoresis of Nanoparticles. They found that the critical thermal Rayleigh number can be reduced or increased by a substantial amount, depending on whether the basic nanoparticle distribution is top-heavy or bottom-heavy, by the presence of the nanoparticles. Based on these conservation equations, some recent studies have been performed by Agarwal et al. [16, 17], Bhadauria and Agarwal [18, 19], Agarwal and Bhadauria [20], Rana and Agarwal [21], Agarwal [22]. For the case of a simple nanofluid layer, studies have been performed by Yadav et al.

40|$|Packed beds using air at {{atmospheric}} pressure as <b>heat</b> <b>transferring</b> <b>medium</b> {{are the most}} cost effective systems for sensible heat storage. The basic idea of the CellFlux concept is to apply this concept also for liquid and/or pressurized primary HTFs {{by the introduction of}} an intermediate working fluid cycle. A heat exchanger is used for transferring energy between the primary HTF and the intermediate air cycle which eventually transfers the energy to a packed bed. The CellFlux concept can be implemented by using standard components. Essential is the minimization of efficiency losses resulting from the circulation of the air as well as the <b>heat</b> <b>transfer</b> processes within the heat exchanger and the storage volume. Some example cost estimations for the heat exchanger are given. The feasibility of the CellFlux concept has been proven by a pilot scale test facility operated at a maximum temperature of 380 °C and 100 kW. A novel approach promising further cost reductions has been applied by realizing a horizontal flow direction. Results from the theoretical and experimental analysis of the CellFlux concept will be presented. Distinctive for the CellFlux concept is the flexibility regarding working fluid (thermal oil, molten salt, pressurized water, CO 2), temperature range (0 - 800 °C), power (kW-multi MW) and storage medium (rocks, clinker bricks, concrete). This allows a wide range of applications. An example for application in combined heat and power will be given...|$|R

Knowledge {{of the metal}} distribution is of prime importance concerning the application of pyrolysis product streams. Sorghum bicolor (L.)

Plants were grown in a greenhouse using perlite as substrate, half-strength Hoagland's solution as control (CTR) and the same solution supplemented {{with a mixture of}} Ni and Zn (CTM; 10 g m− 3 each).

S. bicolor delivered good shoot biomass with relatively moderate concentrations of Ni and Zn. Metal concentrations in the pyrolysis oils were below detection limits and almost all metals accumulated in the char. In fact, 99 % of Ni and 98 % of Zn were recovered in the char when a slow pyrolysis process was applied, while in flash pyrolysis conditions both metals were found back in the char and in the <b>heating</b> <b>transfer</b> <b>medium.</b> Furthermore, the percentages of char and oil were higher in slow pyrolysis compared to flash pyrolysis.
