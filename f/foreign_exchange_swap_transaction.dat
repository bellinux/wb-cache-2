50|$|A <b>foreign</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>swap</b> has {{two legs}} - a spot {{transaction}} and a forward transaction - that are executed simultaneously {{for the same}} quantity, and therefore offset each other. Forward <b>foreign</b> <b>exchange</b> transactions occur if both companies have a currency the other needs. It prevents negative <b>foreign</b> <b>exchange</b> risk for either party. <b>Foreign</b> <b>exchange</b> spot transactions are similar to forward <b>foreign</b> <b>exchange</b> transactions {{in terms of how}} they are agreed upon; however, they are planned for a specific date in the very near future, usually within the same week.|$|R
25|$|The {{most common}} type of forward <b>transaction</b> is the <b>foreign</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>swap.</b> In a <b>swap,</b> two parties <b>exchange</b> {{currencies}} for a certain length of time and agree to reverse the transaction at a later date.

Additional empirical tests support this hypothesis, although also point to contract risk. Moreover, official policies to alleviate funding liquidity strains, such as <b>foreign</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>swaps,</b> contributed to restoring arbitrage...|$|R

A brief survey of the literature and country experience is followed by {{an analysis of the}} objectives, timing, amount, degree of transparency, and choice of markets and counterparties in conducting intervention. The analysis highlights the difficulty of detecting exchange rate misalignments and disorderly markets, and argues in favor of parsimony in official intervention. Determining the timing and amount of intervention is a highly subjective excercise, and some degree of discretion is almost necessary, though policy rules may serve as "rules of thumb.

40|$|This paper {{draws on}} a unique data {{set on the}} nontraditional {{systemic}} liquidity easing measures recently undertaken by many emerging market economies. It offers an empirical analysis of the key determinants affecting the decision to undertake these measures over the period September 2008 -March 2009. The paper finds that economy size, access to international credit markets, CDS spreads, currency depreciation, and current account balances are among the key factors influencing the adoption of these measures. It provides a rationale for the differences in central bank policy responses, which reflect differences in economic structures rather than conflicting views on fundamental principles. The paper also provides a preliminary assessment {{of the effectiveness of}} these measures and points out that despite their positive impacts, they have not fully shielded the real economy from the recent financial meltdown.
