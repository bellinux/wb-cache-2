40|$|ELID-grinding of cermets {{has been}} carried out on a {{retrofitted}} Jung surface grinder with different cast iron-bonded (CIB) diamond wheels. In case of rough grinding, with a wheel of 46 µm abrasives, ELID-grinding is preferable compared to grinding with a conventional resin-bonded wheel or a CIB wheel without ELID. Resin-bonded wheels are characterized by low G-ratios and are prone to chattering effects. Metal-bonded wheels are very durable, and especially for avoiding glazing effects during longer grinding cycles, ELID-grinding is the best choice. The maximal MRR in ‘ELID-roughing’ on the used surface grinder is measured to be 1 mm³/s, leading to a roughness of about 0. 4 µm Ra. The ‘ELID-finishing’ steps are implemented on the same grinding machine, so the workpiece {{does not need to be}} dismounted. Several sets of experiments based on the Design of Experiments method show that lower axial feeds and higher duty ratios of the power supply improve the surface quality effectively. With the wheel of 10 µm grit size, chattering can be avoided by limiting the theoretical MRR to 0. 05 mm³/s. To obtain a final Sa roughness below 10 nm, the last <b>finishing</b> <b>wheel</b> should remove less than 0. 3 10 - 3 mm³/s. The total processing time of the finishing steps is less than 30 minutes for a workpiece area of 375 mm³. status: publishe...|$|E

50|$|Forged {{magnesium}} {{wheels are}} manufactured by mechanically deforming (forging) a prefabricated rod using a powerful forging press. Several somewhat different forging techniques exist, {{all of them}} comprising a multi-step process/operation. The resultant forging is subsequently machined (lathe-turned and milled) into the final shape of a wheel by removing excess metal from the forged blank. A forged magnesium wheel is 25 percent lighter than cast wheel. The main disadvantage of forged wheels is the high manufacturing cost. And due to the typically high costs of <b>finished</b> <b>wheels,</b> forged wheels are still rarely purchased by non-professional drivers for regular road use. But since forged wheels can be designed to be lighter than cast wheels for a given load, forged wheels do offer fuel economy and other distinct advantages. The forging process allows alignment of the metal fibers and optimization of the directional pattern arrangement along the spokes of a wheel. This, along with the smaller grain size, results in superior mechanical properties and performance characteristics that make forged magnesium wheels widely popular both for motor racing and with knowledgeable driving enthusiasts.|$|R

5000|$|Custom wheels come in many {{different}} finishes. The most common custom <b>wheel</b> <b>finishes</b> are Chrome, Polished and Painted. Chrome wheels consist of traditional chrome plating {{as well as the}} new process of PVD (Physical Vapor Deposition) Chrome.

40|$|Grinding and {{polishing}} are important {{steps in the}} production of decorative vitreous ceramic tiles. Different combinations of <b>finishing</b> <b>wheels</b> {{and polishing}} wheels are tested to optimize their selection. The results show that the surface glossiness depends not only on the surface quality before machining, but also on the characteristics of the ceramic tiles as well as the performance of grinding and polishing wheels. The performance of the polishing wheel is the key for a good final surface quality. The surface glossiness after finishing must be above 208 in order to get higher polishing quality because finishing will limit the maximum surface glossiness by polishing. The optimized combination of grinding and polishing wheels for all the steps will achieve shorter machining times and better surface quality. No obvious relationships are found between the hardness of ceramic tiles and surface quality or the wear of grinding wheels; therefore, the hardness of the ceramic tile cannot be used for evaluating its machinability...|$|R

40|$|A unique {{roll forming}} {{technology}} that permits complex axisymmetric components, such as automobile wheels and turbine disks, to be formed {{in a single}} forming operation, has been developed by two Russian Institute, the Institute of Technical Physics of the Russian Federal Nuclear Center and the Institute for Metals Superplasticity Problems. This process was used to fabricate automobile wheels from a Russian AVT alloy, a 6010 aluminum alloy equivalent. The process included steps of isothermal roll forming of preforms into wheels shapes, all at 430 C for the AVT alloy. The microstructure and mechanical properties were evaluated at various locations in the <b>finished</b> <b>wheels</b> by optical metallography and tensile testing at elevated temperatures. Tensile properties were obtained by stain-rate change tests and tensile tests to failure at high strain rates. Microstructure and mechanical propertied of the preforms and blanks were also evaluated. The results indicate that dynamically recovered microstructures were developed during the processing, which showed relatively high strain rate sensitivity and rendered sufficiently plasticity at the elevated temperature for wheel fabrication process...|$|R

40|$|In recent years, the {{environment}} {{has become one of}} the most important subject. Emulsion-based cooling fluids are used in grinding for a variety of reasons such as improving surface <b>finish,</b> <b>wheel</b> life, flushing away chips, reducing workpiece thermal deformation. Due to large fluid delivery an extensive amount of mist is generated during grinding process. The workers who breathe in this hazardous mist is having health hazard. There are two alternative for large cutting fluids. One is dry grinding and another is near dry grinding also known as minimum quantity lubrication. MQL grinding refers to the delivery of minute quantity of fluid via an aerosol to the grinding zone. The typical flow rate of grinding fluid for MQL fluid consumption is generally 20 - 100 ml/hour. Although numerous advantages were found for MQL grinding compared with the conventional technique and dry grinding. The cooling and lubrication performance of the grinding fluid is the key technical area for the success application of MQL grinding process. Nanofluid has emerged as a promising solution to this problem. Nanofluid is a new class of fluids engineered by dispersing nanometer-size solid particles into base fluids such as water, lubrication oils. The excellent properties of the nanofluid makes very attractive in cooling and lubricating application in manufacturing [...] This study provides a review of research in this field with focus on use of nanofluids in grinding applications...|$|R

40|$|The {{primary goal}} of this program {{is to develop a}} commercially viable {{enthalpy}} exchangers that exhibits performance comparable to state-of-the-art exchangers, meets flammability test standards, supports no biological growth, maintains mechanical integrity for a 10 year life (typical of competitive warrantees) and exhibits a total media raw material cost of approximately 1 / 5 of that of the competition. The first three program tasks were devoted to: (1) gathering background information on competitors and their methods of manufacturing; (2) establishing experimental and evaluation procedures for the program; (3) identifying potential desiccants, supports and binders to be tested; (4) preparing matrix combinations on a laboratory scale; (5) testing component combinations for equilibrium moisture uptakes at different relative humidities (isotherms) and dynamic moisture adsorption rates; (6) using media adsorption properties to models to predict exchanger performance; (7) estimating ease of manufacture and <b>finished</b> <b>wheel</b> costs; and (8) calculating raw material, wheel and cassette costs based on the best media formulations. Since the rotary enthalpy exchangers have high rotational speeds, uptake rate is at least as important as equilibrium moisture uptake. Therefore, a procedure and apparatus were developed to determine adsorption rate so that the Lewis number (the ratio of mass transfer resistance to heat transfer resistance) could be calculated. The calculated values for different media materials could then be used for performance model predictions. Based on the results achieved, three systems have been selected as enthalpy exchange media candidates for the next phase of work. All materials are expected to give at least the same level of sensible and latent performance as the competitive media...|$|R
