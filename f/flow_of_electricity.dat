Americans and Britons began showing interest in acupuncture in the early 19th century but interest waned by mid century. Western practitioners abandoned acupuncture's traditional beliefs in spiritual energy, pulse diagnosis, and the cycles of the moon, sun or the body's rhythm. Diagrams of the flow of spiritual energy, for example, conflicted with the West's own anatomical diagrams. It adopted a new set of ideas for acupuncture based on tapping needles into nerves. In Europe it was speculated that acupuncture may allow or prevent the <b>flow</b> <b>of</b> <b>electricity</b> in the body, as electrical pulses were found to make a frog's leg twitch after death.|$|E

During certain extreme space weather events solar wind can interfere with transmissions. Grids also have a predefined carrying capacity or load that cannot safely be exceeded.

40|$|The {{closure of}} Longannet in 2016 raised {{debate about the}} ability of Scotland to meet its peak demand for electricity. Given Scotland’s {{transmission}} links to the rest of Great Britain and the interconnection with Northern Ireland, how likely is it that the remaining generation fleet in Scotland can meet peak demand? The research we present in this report suggests that the answer in early 2017 is: extremely likely. However, between now and 2030 major changes are expected to the Scottish electricity system: Hunterston and Torness nuclear stations are both expected to close by 2030, there is no certainty over the long term future of Peterhead gas power station, the capacity of wind generation is expected to grow, {{and the size of the}} peak demand is also likely to grow. The result is that <b>flows</b> <b>of</b> <b>electricity</b> across the transmission network will be considerably more variable, from large exports when it is windy to large imports when it is calm. Towards the end of the 2020 s, at the latest, it is likely either new transmission links with the rest of Great Britain, or new generation capacity that is capable of being scheduled in advance will be required to ensure Scotland’s peak demand security-of-supply. Existing policy for planning the transmission network is based on a standard that was designed for a system where <b>flows</b> <b>of</b> <b>electricity</b> were more predictable and consistent than is the case today. This study analyses the level of transmission import capability and investigates the following question: What transmission import capability is required into Scotland in order to provide confidence that peak-demand for electricity can be met...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to quantitatively {{evaluate}} the impact on <b>electricity</b> prices <b>of</b> deregulation and free trade in the Nordic countries.

The major tool for our analysis <b>of</b> <b>electricity</b> trade and prices is a numerical multicountry electricity market model in which losses and bottlenecks in the transmission system are taken into account. Moreover both Cournot and perfect competition equilibria with and without free trade in electricity can be simulated. According to the simulation results there are significant differences between the Cournot and perfect competition equilibrium prices under autarky. When inter-country trade is allowed, however, the Cournot equilibrium prices are quite close to the equilibrium prices under perfect competition.

The technique is applied to a test case, demonstrating how a simple combined heat and power control scheme can support the integration of on-site wind power.
