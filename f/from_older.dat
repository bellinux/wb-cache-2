Although Brett-Surman regarded E. regalis and E. annectens as potentially representing males and females of the same species, all E. regalis specimens come <b>from</b> <b>older</b> formations than E. annectens specimens.|$|E

5|$|Baseball evolved <b>from</b> <b>older</b> bat-and-ball games {{already being}} played in England by the mid-18th century. This game was brought by {{immigrants}} to North America, where the modern version developed. By the late 19th century, baseball was {{widely recognized as}} the national sport of the United States. Baseball is currently popular in North America and parts of Central and South America, the Caribbean, and East Asia, particularly in Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan.|$|E
5|$|By 1908 {{there were}} calls for another Royal Commission into Western Australia's penal system. Truth {{newspaper}} repeatedly criticised Fremantle Prison between 1903 and 1910, {{with much of}} the blame placed on the comptroller general and superintendent. Allegations included that new offenders still were not separated <b>from</b> <b>older</b> ones, that regulations were systemically broken, and that prisoners were not paid for the work they did.|$|E

5000|$|Some {{compound}} words <b>from</b> <b>Old</b> English were reanalyzed in Middle or Modern English {{when one}} of the constituent words fell out of use. Examples include [...] <b>from</b> <b>Old</b> English [...] "bride-man". The word [...] "man" [...] <b>from</b> <b>Old</b> English [...] fell out of use during the sixteenth century and the compound was eventually reanalyzed with the Modern English word [...] "male servant". A similar reanalysis caused , <b>from</b> <b>Old</b> English sāmblind [...] "half-blind" [...] with a once-common prefix sām- [...] "semi-", to be respelled as though it is related to sand. The word island derives <b>from</b> <b>Old</b> English igland. The modern spelling with the letter s is the result of comparison with the synonym [...] <b>from</b> <b>Old</b> French and ultimately Latin insula, though the Old French and Old English words are not historically related. In a similar way, the spelling of [...] was likely affected by comparison with wood.|$|R

5|$|It was {{received}} positively by reviewers, with praise for its material for Dungeon Masters and its illustrations, but received criticism for its weak player-oriented content. The book {{was the second}} in the series of books about specific monster types, the first being Draconomicon. Similar books published since include Lords of Madness. Libris Mortis included content <b>from</b> <b>older</b> books, such as Tome and Blood and the Book of Vile Darkness, that had been reworked.|$|E
5|$|The Glen Yards {{project has}} been {{controversial}} due to local opposition to the project, environmental issues, {{and the cost of}} the project itself. The project, which has received approval from the provincial government, was, in 2003, expected to be complete by 2010. The new 'campus' has now been completed, and a massive effort of moving units <b>from</b> <b>older</b> hospitals, such Royal Victoria, Montreal Children's, and Montreal General, into the new McGill University Health Center is underway.|$|E

5|$|The {{introduction}} of the steam ship-of-the-line led to a building competition between France and Britain. Eight sister ships to Napoléon were built in France {{over a period of}} ten years, but the United Kingdom soon managed {{to take the lead in}} production. Altogether, France built ten new wooden steam battleships and converted 28 <b>from</b> <b>older</b> ships of the line, while the United Kingdom built 18 and converted 41.|$|E
5|$|The ten colossal heads from San Lorenzo {{originally}} formed two roughly {{parallel lines}} running north-south across the site. Although some were recovered from ravines, {{they were found}} close to their original placements and had been buried by local erosion. These heads, together {{with a number of}} monumental stone thrones, probably formed a processional route across the site, powerfully displaying its dynastic history. Two of the San Lorenzo heads had been re-carved <b>from</b> <b>older</b> thrones.|$|E
5|$|A primary {{theme of}} the defense was that the CPUSA sought to convert the US to {{socialism}} by education, not by force. The defense claimed {{that most of the}} prosecution's documentary evidence came <b>from</b> <b>older</b> texts that pre-dated the 1935 Seventh World Congress of the Comintern, after which the CPUSA rejected violence as a means of change. Starobin, p 207. The defense attempted to introduce documents into evidence which represented the CPUSA's advocacy of peace, claiming that these policies superseded the older texts that the prosecution had introduced which emphasized violence. Medina excluded most of the material proposed by the defense because it did not directly pertain to the specific documents the prosecution had produced. As a result, the defense complained that they were unable to portray the totality of their belief system to the jury.|$|E

5|$|All three {{consoles}} provide titles <b>from</b> <b>older</b> consoles for download; the Xbox 360 {{through the}} Xbox Originals service, the PlayStation 3 through the PlayStation Store, and the Wii through the Virtual Console. When purchased, {{the game is}} saved to console's internal memory or, optionally on the Wii, to an inserted SD/SDHC card. Initially the Xbox 360 also provided Xbox Live support for backwards compatible games, but the service has since been discontinued for original Xbox games. No more games {{will be added to}} the list of backwards compatible games for the Xbox 360. In response to the lack of backward compatibility for most PS3s, many popular games have been released for download as PlayStation 2 Classics and other popular series have been updated with gameplay/graphics as high-definition remasters for PlayStation consoles and have been released on Blu-ray Disc or are available for download on the PlayStation Network.|$|E
5|$|During dialogue, diction is {{dependent}} on the character's social background: Sumardjo writes that Marsiti speaks as a poor villager with little education would, and that Aij Tjeng's father and father-in-law use constructions and give advice only plausible if coming <b>from</b> <b>older</b> people. He finds only one character, the Columbia University-educated Bian Koen, to be unrealistic: Sumardjo criticises Bian Koen's emotionality, considering it unfitting of an individual with the character's education and life experiences. In other instances Kwee builds suspense by extended use of ellipses, a form which Sumardjo suggests was inspired by contemporary silat (traditional martial arts) stories.|$|E
5|$|Henry begins time {{traveling}} {{at the age}} of five, jumping forward and backward relative to his own timeline. When he leaves, where he goes, or how long his trips will last are all beyond his control. His destinations are tied to his subconscious—he most often travels to places and times related to his own history. Certain stimuli such as stress can trigger Henry's time traveling; he often goes jogging to keep calm and remain in the present. He searches out pharmaceuticals in the future that may be able to help control his time traveling. He also seeks the advice of a geneticist, Dr. Kendrick. Henry cannot take anything with him into the future or the past; he always arrives naked and then struggles to find clothing, shelter, and food. He amasses a number of survival skills including lock-picking, self-defense, and pickpocketing. Much of this he learns <b>from</b> <b>older</b> versions of himself.|$|E

5|$|Natural {{selection}} therefore {{explains why}} wheels are an unlikely {{solution to the}} problem of locomotion: a partially evolved wheel, missing one or more key components, would probably not impart an advantage to an organism. The exception to this is the flagellum, the only known example of a freely rotating propulsive system in biology; in the evolution of flagella, individual components were recruited <b>from</b> <b>older</b> structures, where they performed tasks unrelated to propulsion. The basal body that is now the rotary motor, for instance, might have evolved from a structure used by the bacterium to inject toxins into other cells. This recruitment of previously evolved structures to serve new functions is called exaptation.|$|E
5|$|The main Fur Army was now {{located in}} their capital of El Fasher and was {{estimated}} to consist of between 4,000 and 6,000 riflemen with adequate supplies of ammunition. Their equipment ranged <b>from</b> <b>older</b> muzzleloader weapons, such as Martini-Henry and Remington rifles and shotguns, to spears, shields and chain mail. They were supported by {{an unknown number of}} auxiliary troops armed only with spears. At the same time Dinar was concentrating his troops from other regions in the capital. Those in contact with the Anglo-Egyptian forces and some small number of reinforcements, were instead grouped at Burush and Kedada.|$|E
5|$|The most {{extensive}} {{study of the}} use and incidence of these terms is that undertaken by folklorists Iona and Peter Opie in the UK in their 1959 book, The Lore and Language of Schoolchildren, which mapped the use of truce terms across England, Wales and Scotland. The Opies considered it the most important word in a schoolchild's vocabulary and one for {{which there was no}} adult equivalent. There has been little recent research in the UK but such research as there has been indicates that truce terms, including some of those prevalent in the late 1950s, are still in general use. Studies conducted since the 1970s in English speaking cultures show that truce terms are also prevalent in Australia, New Zealand, South Africa and the United States with a number of terms deriving <b>from</b> <b>older</b> terms used in the UK, but many not.|$|E
