25|$|On 5 May 1998, a <b>flexible</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>hose</b> in the ship's {{engine room}} burst. The {{spraying}} fuel ignited {{when it came}} into contact with hot machinery, and the first-response extinguishers were unable to cope with the fire's intensity. It took two hours for the fire to be extinguished, and four sailors died from carbon monoxide poisoning. A Board of Inquiry reported in December that a different type of hose inappropriate for an engine-room environment was fitted, the civilian contractors that fitted the hose had not passed the configuration changes to the Lloyd's Register classification society as required, and that personnel aboard Westralia did not have the training and qualifications required for their responsibilities. Repairs and modifications were made to the ship, and she returned to operational service during 2000.|$|E
40|$|Unique {{and useful}} {{properties}} {{of the class of}} nonhydrocarbon, nonhalocarbon, nonsilicone polymers known as polyphosphazenes are discussed at length. These polymers, with molecular weights to 4 million (degree of polymerization 15, 000), can be fabricated as tubes, fibers, woven fabrics, flexible films, or plates, and many variants are stable to attack by water, bases, aqueous acids, jet fuels, oils, hydraulic fluids, gasoline, or other hydrocarbons. Rubbery polymers with these properties can be fashioned into <b>flexible</b> <b>hose,</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>hose,</b> gaskets, or O-rings. Since they do not provoke clotting reactions in blood, and reveal no carcinogenic effects to date, they are considered for internal prosthetic applications (replacement bone, temporary skin, heart valves), as biodegradable suturing material, as carriers for slow release of drugs, and as carriers for chemotherapeutic agents against cancers...|$|R
25|$|The hoses are {{color-coded}} {{for visual}} identification. The {{color of the}} hoses varies between countries. In the United States, the oxygen hose is green, and the <b>fuel</b> <b>hose</b> is red. In the UK and other countries, the oxygen hose is blue (black hoses may still be found on old equipment), and the acetylene (<b>fuel)</b> <b>hose</b> is red. If liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) fuel, such as propane, is used, the <b>fuel</b> <b>hose</b> should be orange, indicating that it is compatible with LPG. LPG will damage an incompatible hose, including most acetylene hoses.|$|R

40|$|Cooper Nuclear Station (CNS) {{returned}} {{one high}} pressure <b>fuel</b> <b>hose</b> to Engine Systems, Inc. (ESI) because CNS had found foreign material within the hose during receipt inspection. This <b>fuel</b> <b>hose</b> {{was one of}} four <b>fuel</b> <b>hoses</b> that had been supplied to CNS by ESI in October 2011. ESI performed an evaluation and found very small pieces of the elastomer tube internal to the hose. Apparently these pieces were introduced during assembly of the end fittings onto the hose during fabrication of the hose assembly. When installed, this <b>fuel</b> <b>hose</b> would be located after the engine fuel filter and before the fuel injection pumps. Foreign material within this hose could migrate to the fuel injection pumps. The entrance of foreign material could impact operability of one or more fuel injection pumps and therefore affect fuel delivery to one or more engine cylinders. This could impact the load carrying capability of the diesel engine or possibly cause complete engine shutdown. Either scenario has the potential to prevent the emergency diesel generator from performing its safety related function. These hoses were supplied only to CNS. 02 - 03 - 12; 03 : 43 PM; # 11 /...|$|R

50|$|Larrousse {{also made}} a deal with Benetton to use the team's 1993 gearbox in the LH94 chassis. Larrousse's {{association}} with Benetton was to prove controversial, however, as the former became involved {{in the aftermath of the}} latter's pit fire at the 1994 German Grand Prix, wherein Benetton's excuse for removing a filter in the <b>fuel</b> <b>hose</b> was attributed to communication between Larrousse and the fuel-equipment manufacturer, Intertechnique, which apparently authorised Larrousse to remove the filters in its own <b>fuel</b> <b>hoses.</b>|$|R
40|$|Biodiesel {{is one of}} {{the fast}} growing {{alternative}} fuels for diesel engines in the world with yearly consumption exceeds 300 million gallon. In 2000, the Hong Kong SAR Government has commissioned the University of Hong Kong to conduct a comprehensive evaluation on the performance of biodiesel on in-service diesel-powered vehicles in Hong Kong and to compare the results with those using ultra low sulphur diesel (50 ppm sulphur) currently used in Hong Kong. Three types of biodiesel fuels were tested with different biodiesel/ULSD blending ratios. The whole study comprised of two parts, namely, a chassis dynamometer exhaust emission test (NOx, CO and HC 1) and a diesel lug down test for each of the vehicle tested. The result of the test is positive and confirms the environmental benefit of using biodiesel fuel. However, a very slight increased in NOx concentration is reported. During the course of the study, some issues related to the durability and <b>fuel</b> <b>hoses</b> compatibility have been raised that may affect the road worthiness of vehicles. In order to assess the compatibility of the rubber <b>fuel</b> <b>hoses</b> with biodiesel, a <b>fuel</b> <b>hose</b> compatibility test was performed to study the characteristics of <b>fuel</b> <b>hoses</b> subjected to <b>fuels</b> with different biodiesel percentages and with different durations. Result of the test leads to some recommendations on the use of special <b>fuel</b> <b>hoses</b> for biodiesel <b>fuel.</b> A one-year durability test on three vehicles using biodiesel was carried out to observe the long term effect of biodiesel on vehicles. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

50|$|One of {{the most}} {{dramatic}} incidents affected Verstappen at the German Grand Prix. During his first scheduled pitstop during the race, fuel leaked onto the car after the <b>fuel</b> <b>hose</b> was disconnected. The car, with Verstappen in it, was engulfed in flames for several seconds. As was usual at the time, Verstappen had slightly opened the visor of his helmet for the pit stop, but apart from slight burns to his nose, he was uninjured.

5000|$|As {{soon as the}} car {{comes to}} a halt, the first step, taken while the fourth tire changer assumes his position, is for a {{mechanic}} to activate the car's built-in pneumatic jacks. A pressurized air hose is inserted into a receiving nozzle {{at the rear of}} the car, under the rear wing. Previously, this device was inserted on the side of the car, but for safety reasons, the location was moved in the 2000s. At the same instant, another crew member begins the refueling process. A <b>fueling</b> <b>hose</b> is inserted into a socket (called the [...] "buckeye"), allowing a gravity-fed hose to refill the car's fuel tank.
