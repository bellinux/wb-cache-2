25|$|In the {{scientific}} method, parsimony is an epistemological, metaphysical or heuristic preference, not an irrefutable principle of logic or a scientific result. As a logical principle, Occam's razor would demand that scientists accept the simplest possible theoretical explanation for existing data. However, science has shown repeatedly that future data often support more complex theories than do existing data. Science prefers the simplest explanation {{that is consistent}} with the data available at a given time, but the simplest explanation may be ruled out as new data become available. That <b>is,</b> <b>science</b> is open to the possibility that future experiments might support more complex theories than demanded by current data and is more interested in designing experiments to discriminate between competing theories than favoring one theory over another based merely on philosophical principles.|$|E

500|$|The {{premise of}} a {{biography}} for a tree was well received. The writing was called engaging, lyrical, and compelling. Robert Wiersema wrote, [...] "Tree <b>is</b> <b>science</b> writing at its finest. It's sweeping but focused, {{keenly aware of}} both the minutiae and the big picture. ...Although some of the concepts are complex, the writing is always accessible... Scientific matters are explained in layman's terms, and the text never bogs down or bottlenecks." [...] However, some reviewers found the language too technical. In the Montreal Gazette, Bronwyn Chester wrote that the scientific language [...] "dilut our feeling and concern for this tree through too much information". Robert Bateman's black and white illustrations, while skilled, were said to add little to the narrative.|$|E

[...] Writing for the Los Angeles Times, critic Andrew Hanson noted [...] "Wow. Fringe brings its first chapter to a close, and it really does feel like the end of a chapter.

2500|$|Smalley criticized Drexler's work on {{nanotechnology}} as naive, {{arguing that}} chemistry is extremely complicated, reactions {{are hard to}} control, and that a universal assembler <b>is</b> <b>science</b> fiction.

His two principal technical objections, which he had termed the “fat fingers problem" [...] and the [...] "sticky fingers problem”, argued against the feasibility of molecular assemblers being able to precisely select and place individual atoms. He also believed that Drexler’s speculations about apocalyptic dangers of molecular assemblers threaten the public support for development of nanotechnology.|$|E

2500|$|When Bishop's first novel, A Funeral for the Eyes of Fire, was {{published}} by Ballantine Books in 1975, critics Alexei and Cory Panshin wrote that the novel [...] "shows {{an interest in the}} anthropological comparable to Ursula K. Le Guin and a sense of the alien comparable to James Tiptree, Jr. [...] But it is an individual work, Bishop's own and no one else's. A Funeral for the Eyes of Fire is highly imperfect. [...] It is a pied mirror, everywhere reflecting brilliantly bright, everywhere cloudy. [...] It leads the eyes inward, and ultimately reveals nothing clearly. [...] Even so, it is the most impressive first novel so far seen in the Seventies." [...] They go on to declare that [...] "Bishop is one of the new and still rare breed [...] of [...] science fiction writer attempting to produce art without rejecting the pulp vigor that <b>is</b> <b>science</b> fiction's continuing strengths."

2500|$|Bishop's 1983 Locus Award-winning novella [...] "Her Habiline Husband" [...] {{forms the}} first third of Ancient of Days, {{published}} in 1985 by Arbor House. [...] It's {{the story of}} [...] "Adam", {{one of the last}} surviving Homo habilis who is discovered in contemporary Georgia. [...] In this thematic companion to his novel No Enemy But Time (with an almost inverse conceit), Bishop tackles issues of racial and cultural prejudice, and explores the question {{of what it means to}} be human. Locus reviewer Debbie Notkin writes [...] "This <b>is</b> <b>science</b> fiction so precise and so well-thought-out that it reads like history, although little history is so well-written, or cares so much about its characters." [...] Bernard Goodman of Fantasy Review believes that [...] "Bishop's theme of evil inherent in humanity echoes William Golding," [...] and that the novel [...] "in some ways…parallels Golding's Lord of the Flies." [...] Author Samuel R. Delany writes [...] "A wonder-filled novel of ideas—ideas that include questions of race, science, art, and spirituality, among many others. Bishop dramatizes each of these with a panache and a narrative energy that are a delight to read and dazzling to watch." [...] Ancient of Days was nominated for the Arthur C. Clarke Award in 1988.|$|E
2500|$|Several researchers, {{including}} Nobel Prize winner Dr. Richard Smalley (1943–2005), {{attacked the}} notion of universal assemblers, leading to a rebuttal from Drexler and colleagues, and eventually to an exchange of letters. Smalley argued that chemistry is extremely complicated, reactions are hard to control, and that a universal assembler <b>is</b> <b>science</b> fiction. Drexler and colleagues, however, noted that Drexler never proposed universal assemblers {{able to make a}}bsolutely anything, but instead proposed more limited assemblers able to make a very wide variety of things. They challenged the relevance of Smalley's arguments to the more specific proposals advanced in Nanosystems. [...] Also, Smalley argued that nearly all of modern chemistry involves reactions that take place in a solvent (usually water), because the small molecules of a solvent contribute many things, such as lowering binding energies for transition states. [...] Since nearly all known chemistry requires a solvent, Smalley felt that Drexler's proposal to use a high vacuum environment was not feasible. [...] However, Drexler addresses this in Nanosystems by showing mathematically that well designed catalysts can provide the effects of a solvent and can fundamentally be made even more efficient than a solvent/enzyme reaction could ever be. It is noteworthy that, contrary to Smalley's opinion that enzymes require water, [...] "Not only do enzymes work vigorously in anhydrous organic media, but in this unnatural milieu they acquire remarkable properties such as greatly enhanced stability, radically altered substrate and enantiomeric specificities, molecular memory, and the ability to catalyse unusual reactions." ...|$|E
2500|$|During {{the first}} decade of the 21st century, during the {{administration}} of JMU's fifth President Linwood H. Rose, the university continued to rapidly expand, not only through new construction east of Interstate 81, but also on the west side of campus. In early 2005, JMU purchased the Rockingham Memorial Hospital campus just north of the main JMU campus for over $40 million. The hospital has since moved to a new location, and JMU now occupies the former hospital site after having made substantial renovations to the previous hospital campus. Additionally in June 2005, the university expanded across South High Street by leasing the former Harrisonburg High School building from the City of Harrisonburg. In May 2006, the university purchased the property. The sale was approved in June 2005 for $17 million. The university named the old HHS building Memorial Hall. Recently completed projects include the Rose Library located on the east side of campus, which opened on August 11, 2008. The John C. Wells Planetarium, first opened in 1974, underwent a $1.5 million renovation in 2008. It is now a state-of-the-art hybrid planetarium, the only one of its kind in the world. The mission of the JMU Planetarium <b>is</b> <b>science</b> education and public outreach. As such, it offers free shows to the public every Saturday afternoon and hosts annual summer space camps in July. The [...] Forbes Center for the Performing Arts opened in June 2010, and serves as the home to JMU's School of Theatre and Dance.
