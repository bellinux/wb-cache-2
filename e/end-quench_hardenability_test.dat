40|$|The {{measurement}} of acoustic properties {{can be used}} for the nondestructive characterization of the microstructure of materials. We have measured the changes in longitudinal acoustic wave velocity and acoustic attenuation in steel specimens whose microstructure and properties differ widely because of differing compositions and heat treatment. The spatial variation of the relative acoustic velocity in standard Jominy <b>end-quench</b> <b>hardenability</b> <b>test</b> specimens was found to correlate very well with Rockwell C hardness scans, indicating a potentially practical method for measuring the hardening response of heat treated steel. Absolute velocity measurements on steel specimens were found to be subject to random scatter related to minor compositional variations; this limits the utility of absolute velocity measurements for microstructural NDE. Attenuation measurements have also been performed on steel samples with different microstructures. The measurement utilized broadband acoustic pulses corrected for transducer response, liquid buffer/solid specimen reflection, and diffraction effects. Attenuation coefficients were seen to be proportional to frequency squared for martensite and to the fourth power of frequency for pearlite. Higher attenuation was observed for pearlitic than for martensitic microstructures...|$|E

40|$|This article reviews {{some of the}} {{limitations}} of the standard cooling curve analysis and the Jominy <b>hardenability</b> <b>test</b> in extending the results to actual quenching in industrial setups and reports {{the development of a new}} portable tool—Reference QuenchProbe—for estimating cooling rates, hardness, and microstructure distributions in hardenable steel grades during immersion quenching, which can be used by the heat treater in the plant. The specimen is made of the same grade of steel as the quenched component with section thickness matching that of the component, which is a departure from standard laboratory tests. The test is carried out in the plant under actual conditions dispensing the need to correlate the standard cooling curve data and end quench <b>hardenability</b> <b>tests</b> done in the laboratory to industrial practice. To test the suite of mathematical models associated with the Reference QuenchProbe hardware and software, specimens of different grades of steels were instrumented with a single thermocouple near the surface of the specimen. Using the cooling data at the point of measurement, the cooling rates, microstructure, and hardness at other critical locations were computed. An enthalpy-based non-linear inverse heat conduction model was coupled with austenite decomposition models for handling the latent heat liberated during quenching. Several steels ranging from low carbon to medium alloy steels were both end-quenched by water and immersion quenched in several industrial quenchants. The computed hardness of end quenched and immersion quenched specimens were shown to be in good agreement with the measured values. The Reference QuenchProbe is thus shown to generate data needed for heat treatment process design including quenchant selection, which can be directly used in practice...|$|R
40|$|This study {{examined}} the effects of composition and initial microstructure on the physical, metallurgical, and mechanical properties of carburized SAE 8620 and PS- 18 steels. Testing was performed on 8620 and PS- 18 steels in the as-received and normalized conditions. <b>Hardenability</b> <b>testing</b> was conducted prior to additional heat treatments. Size and shape distortion, residual stress, retained austenite, and effective case depth measurements were obtained for specimens subjected to a carburizing heat treatment. Specimens subjected to a core thermal cycle heat treatment were tested to determine the tensile and Charpy impact properties of the core material of carburized components. Despite differences between the as-received and normalized materials prior to carburizing, testing revealed that normalizing did not {{have a significant effect on}} the properties of the carburized or core thermal cycle heat treated materials. PS- 18 had a higher hardenability, effective case depth, and ultimate tensile strength and a lowerCharpy impact toughness than 8620...|$|R
40|$|Demands {{placed on}} modern steels mean that higher {{strengths}} are being sought while alloy contents, particularly carbon, are decreased. These two conflicting requirements have forced steel designers to consider micro-alloying, heat treatment and precipitation strengthening to meet market demands. This study {{concentrated on the}} use of precipitation hardening by copper to maintain the strength of reduced carbon, quenched and tempered steels. Many studies have concentrated on copper proportions above 1 % in as rolled steels. It was the intent of this study to examine the effect of copper levels between 0 and 1 % {{in the development of a}} low carbon, 690 MPa yield strength quenched and tempered structural steel. The changes in hardness upon tempering, tensile testing, Charpy v-notch impact <b>testing,</b> Jominy <b>hardenability,</b> bead-on-plate weld <b>testing</b> and optical microscopy were used to evaluate the steels. Also covered was the development of empirical descriptions of the response of quenched and tempered steels to heat treatment. Both copper free and copper containing steels were used in the analysis. In studying the copper containing steels, precipitation hardening was observed in a steel containing 0. 4 % copper (nominal composition). It was shown that the strength and fracture toughness targets of military and commercial specifications can be met by the steels developed. As a result of copper based precipitation hardening, Jominy <b>hardenability</b> <b>tests</b> showed a <b>hardenability</b> much higher than would be predicted on the basis of carbon content and the volume fraction of martensite produced as a function of cooling rate. It was demonstrated that the weldability of the low carbon copper steels, as assessed by the bead on plate test, is superior to that of currently used alloys. Therefore, the aim of maintaining strength and increasing weldability by reducing carbon content was clearly achieved...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: Alloying {{elements}} in steels {{are used for}} a various reasons. One {{of the most important}} is the achievement of higher strength in required shapes and sizes. Often in very large sections of steels are used for production of the oil country tubular goods (OCTG). Therefore the hardenability of steels is an important property aim for the appropriate concentration of alloying elements needed to harden the section of steel for oil industry. In this study the hardenability, the cooling rates and microstructures of low alloy Cr-Mo and Mn-Mo steels were investigated. Design/methodology/approach: The cooling rate determines the amount of martensite structure. <b>Hardenability</b> <b>test</b> was carried out by Jominy method. During Jominy testing the temperature changes were monitored by means of CrNi-Ni thermocouples which are connected to eight-channel digital/analogues converter. Microstructure was determined using a scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Findings: The cooling rates in the temperature range between 1133 and 973 K at different distances from the quenched end of low alloy Cr-Mo and Mn-Mo steels were found. Also the hardness and microstructures against the distances from quenched end are determined. Research limitations/implications: It is known that carbon has a marked the effect on hardenability of steel, but its use at higher levels is limited because lower toughness and increased probability of distortion and cracking during heat treatment and welding. Addition of manganese at low alloy steels is very useful for improvement of their hardenability. Practical implications: Chemical composition of low alloy steels for oil industry is usually complex and defined in most cases by standard which give range of concentration of the important alloying elements (Cr, Mo, Mn, etc.) as well as the upper limits of impurity elements (S and P). Alloying {{elements in}}crease the cost of the steel and from these reason it is important to select only steels which required to ensure compliance with specifications. The economical way of increasing the hardenability of steels (at constant carbon content) is to increase the manganese content. Originality/value: Originality and high value of our research work based on development and application of a new grade of low alloy Mn-Mo steel for oil country tubular goods...|$|R

Design/methodology/approach: Metallography, electron microscopy, tensile <b>test,</b> hardness measurements, <b>hardenability</b> calculations, Charpy-V <b>tests</b> have been used. Findings: The thermo-mechanical treatment allows to obtain the fine-grained austenite structure during hot plastic deformation, and gives forged elements obtaining: yield point Rp 0, 2 over 690 MPa, UTS over 770 MPa, hardness 220 up to 250 HB and breaking energy KV over 180 J after high tempering. Research limitations/implications: It is predicted TEM investigations on structure of the forged elements after thermo-mechanical treatment. Practical implications: Investigations carried out showed full usability of micro-alloyed steels for producing forged machine parts with the high strength and cracking resistance, using the energy-saving thermo-mechanical treatment method.
