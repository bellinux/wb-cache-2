40|$|This {{first part}} of the study {{introduces}} an elementary concept of information. Our interest for newness, our curiosity in the new, will be considered as a main building block of information, and of reality itself. A typical definition of information (the reduction of uncertainty) needs to be fundamentally inverted: Information is a compositional activity, including the inconsistent, the paradox, the contradiction and the incoherent meaning. This study expands on the analysis of the composition of new structure (new macrophysical laws), and the analysis of the causality and causal state of such structures (“causally active symbols”). The classical, scientific-objective, passive understanding of information gives meaning to the fact that modern information technology does not by itself lead to an increase of human values. However, our social and moral stance is an informational one, and our informational, active conscious process holds the power to mediate and to enforce this process towards an enriched life. The indicator for such enrichment is given to us by information, and the knowledge about this process will feed us with energy to move towards an active spirit of ethics, and towards the information society. Part I of this study expands on <b>the</b> <b>fundament</b> <b>basis</b> and on our intrinsic responsibility to release the forces that are based on the active dimension of information. Those forces are required in order to reveal the so-called information society from its metaphorical character (Part II) ...|$|R

The following research methods were applied: literature review and two taxonomic methods i. e. cluster analysis and an object map, based on the matrix of distances. On <b>the</b> <b>basis</b> of <b>the</b> results, we propose {{a new approach to}} appoint a path of competitiveness growth for each Visegrad country. Statistical analyses in this article are performed using the statistical software Statistica v. 11. 0, SPSS v. 21. 0 and R v. 3. 1. 0. The analysis based on 12 competitiveness pillars of the Visegrad Countries indicates their high diversity of competitiveness level both in terms of their position in the ranking and <b>the</b> <b>fundaments</b> of competitiveness. However, the taxonomic cluster analysis conducted for 78 most competitive economies and based on unweighed values of 12 competitiveness pillars indicates that the Visegrad Group is the area with a relatively small differentiation in terms of competitiveness <b>fundaments.</b> <b>The</b> analysis shows that the strategy to increase competitiveness should not be significantly different for each Visegrad country...|$|R

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{focuses on}} predictability problems regarding the behaviour {{of the professional}} librarians in public-, school- and research libraries in specific crucial situations. The material was obtained by observations/participations (over 10 years) in the daily work in Swedish libraries by non-structured interviews and “free” discussions with librarians and library visitors. Over 200 interviews with 87 librarians and over 300 discussions with 261 library visitors are <b>the</b> <b>fundament</b> of <b>the</b> empirical <b>basis</b> of my study. These findings build up a theoretical basis (a heuristic model) grounded in ideas of deterministic chaos and complexity theory. Deterministic means, that the current state is the consequence of its preceding states, in my terms, the corporate memory in organizations. Chaotic means the sensitivity of initial condition. Deterministic chaos describes behaviour which satisfies the conditions of determinism but even shows the characteristics of chaos. The study shows that differences between the behaviour of the librarians and the predictions of the behaviour in crucial situations from the political leadership are essentially grounded in ·The history of Swedish libraries (deterministic rationality and self-rationality). ·The asymmetric information between librarians and politicians. ·Self-organization of librarians in the daily work. ·The “free” will of librarians in crucial situations grounded {{in the philosophy of}} Kant. The behaviour I could observe was studied in the following situations: ·The demand of a law, which secures the existence of public- and school libraries. ·The selection, development and installation of appropriate computer based information systems in public- school- and research libraries. ·The GÖK- and KUR-projects, which was {{based on the assumption that}} new ways to work with the daily patterns in libraries should open the library for more visitors, book loaners and information seekers. The issues discussed in this dissertation gave the following results: ·That the long time, in many cases even short time, unpredictability of librarian behaviour in for the library crucial situations is not only understandable – but also necessary for the development of the library. ·That the deterministic chaotic behaviour of the librarians is generated by self-rationality, asymmetric information, and self-organization. ·That the library is not a chaotic organization but a deterministic chaotic organization. Further I could see tendencies for the same behaviour in other professional, knowledge based Non Profit Organizations like schools, universities and hospitals...|$|R
