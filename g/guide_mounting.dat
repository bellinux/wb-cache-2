60|$|Rollo paid no {{attention}} to the clamor, but quietly surveyed the carriages which were standing in the street before him. The coachmen of some of them were on the sidewalk; those of others stood up in their carriages, shouting all the time to Rollo, and cracking their whips. Rollo at last selected the one which he thought would be best for the purpose, and went quietly to it. Partly by signs, and partly by disconnected words in Italian, he made a bargain with the man to take them to Sorrento and back; and then the carriage drove up to the sidewalk, and all the party got in.

40|$|A {{prototype}} {{drill guide}} {{was developed to}} improve the accuracy of surgical placement of fibular grafts {{for the treatment of}} femoral head necrosis. To document performance, two tantalum beads, one placed on the lateral femoral shaft and the other embedded in the superior portion of the head, were used to define the desired graft tract in a series of seven surrogate femurs. Two orthogonal x-rays of the drill <b>guide</b> <b>mounted</b> on each surrogate femur were taken both before and after drilling. After stylus digitization of each x-ray pair, a computer program calculated the achieved accuracy of the drill. The mean of the absolute error between the desired versus obtained position of the drill tip was 3. 68 mm (s. d. 1. 24 mm), and the random component of the error was 1. 98 mm (s. d. 0. 89 mm) ...|$|R

The receiver operates to at least the gap frequency of Niobium, approximately 680 GHz. Typical receiver noise temperatures from 565 - 690 GHz range from 160 K to 230 K with a best value of 185 K DSB at 648 GHz. With the mixer cooled from 4. 3 K to 2 K the measured receiver noise temperatures decreased by approximately 15 percent, giving roughly 180 K DSB from 660 to 680 GHz. The receiver has a full 1 GHz IF pass band and was successfully installed at the Caltech Submillimeter Observatory in Hawaii...|$|R

40|$|A novel {{prototype}} yarn traversing {{mechanism that}} includes three yarn <b>guides</b> <b>mounted</b> on an endless chain passing over six sprockets with {{an arrangement of}} relieving yarn from one guide to the other at traverse extremes to wind 762 mm (30 inches) long filter cartridges has been already developed by the author[1]. However, this mechanism is prone to greater mechanical wear and tear because of kind of mechanical movement required in its working. To overcome this drawback, the author continued efforts of improving the design and developed improved yarn traversing mechanism which is described in this paper. Key words: filter winder, springy deflectable arm, yarn transfer, yarn traversing guide Method of traversing with grooved cam and follower is used on commercial filter winders {{as well as other}} winding applications. Quick reversal of yarn guide at traverse extremes is necessary during cross winding, to eliminate formation of hard edges. Patent literature describes various methods of yarn traversing based on mechanical principles, where use of grooved cam is eliminated [2 - 10]. These traversing mechanisms mainly use elements lik...|$|R
