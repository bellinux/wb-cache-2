Three miles outside of Florence, under Fiesole--a darling location, and apparently a choice house, near Fiske.|$|E
60|$|The {{whole world}} is {{certainly}} heading for a great simplicity, not deliberately, but rather inevitably. It is not a mere fashion of false innocence, {{like that of the}} French aristocrats before the Revolution, who built an altar to Pan, and who taxed the peasantry for the enormous expenditure which is needed in order to live the simple life of peasants. The simplicity towards which the world is driving is the necessary outcome of all our systems and speculations and of our deep and continuous contemplation of things. For the universe is like everything in it; we <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>it</b> repeatedly and habitually before we see it. It is only when we have seen it for the hundredth time that we see it for the first time. The more consistently things are contemplated, the more they tend to unify themselves and therefore to simplify themselves. The simplification of anything is always sensational. Thus monotheism is the most sensational of things: it is as if we gazed long at a design full of disconnected objects, and, suddenly, with a stunning thrill, they came together into a huge and staring face.|$|E

60|$|We all see, then, {{that the}} problem {{presents}} extraordinary difficulty. How are you going {{in a case like}} the United Provinces, for example, to secure that adequate and substantial representation, which it is the interest and the desire of the Government for its own sake to secure. No fair-minded Moslem would deny in Eastern Bengal, any more than a fair-minded non-Moslem would deny it in the United Provinces, that there is no easy solution. You see, gentlemen, I do not despair of finding a fair-minded man in a controversy of this kind. From information that reaches me I do not at all despair of meeting fair-minded critics of both communities, in spite of the sharp antagonism that exists on many matters between them. But, whatever may be the case with Mahomedans and Hindus, there is one body of men who are bound to keep a fair mind, and that is the Government. The Government are bound, whatever you may do among yourselves, strictly, and I will even say sternly, to insist on overcoming all obstacles in a spirit of absolute equity. Now, what is the object of the Government? It is that the Legislative Councils should represent truly and effectively, with a reasonable approach to the balance of real social forces, the wishes and needs of the communities themselves. That is the object of the Government, and in face of a great problem of that kind, algebra, arithmetic, geometry, logic--none of these things will do your business for you. You <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>it</b> widely and away from those sciences, excellent in their place, but not of much service when you are solving awkward political riddles. I think if you allow some method of leaving to a local authority the power of adding to the number of representatives from the Mahomedan community, or the Hindu community, as the case may be, that might be a possible and prudent way of getting through this embarrassment. Let us all be clear of one thing, namely--and I thought of this when I heard one or two observations that fell from Mr. Ameer Ali--that no general proposition can be wisely based on the possession by either community, either of superior civil qualities or superior personal claims. If you begin to introduce that element, you perceive the perils to that peace and mutual goodwill which we hope to emerge by-and-by, though it may take longer than some think. I repeat that I see no harm {{from the point of view}} of a practical working compromise, in the principle that population, or numerical strength, should be the main factor in determining how many representatives should sit for this or the other community; but modifying influences may be both wisely and equitably taken into account in allotting the numbers of such representatives.|$|E

[...] The base of Harkness Tower, one of the university's most {{prominent}} structures and one of the tallest free-standing stone structures in the world, forms one corner of Branford's main courtyard.

40|$|Learning {{should be}} a {{continuous}} process in our lives. This means that we {{must take into account}} the non-formal and informal learning, as they allow us developing the learning process throughout life. To achieve this, we have to find spaces that encourage learning and sources of knowledge. Internet is, above all, a communication space, but, in addition to communication opportunities it offers, we <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>it</b> from the perspective of learning. Communication urges to share information, to share the productions, in short, to share and create knowledge. Communication has made the leap to virtual world and gives us the opportunity to use resources, sources of information, make contacts [...] . That shapes our PLE or Personal Learning Environment. Considering the great importance that has taken the Internet and new media, we can only emphasize its value and claim their place in formal education...|$|E
40|$|Objective” is a {{term that}} has a long and {{sometimes}} tumultuous history and {{a wide range of}} meanings. The sense in which I am interested here is the one that refers to ways of thinking, and especially the explicit criticism of an argument or judgment as not being “objective,” as exemplified in the following. You’re not being objective. You <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>it</b> objectively. Objectively, the best choice is… Being objective, I’d have to say… Implicit in these statements is an ideology that denigrates emotion and other communicative aspects in favour of an idealized sense of fact, data and truth. The underlying idea holds there is a way of thinking, deciding, arguing that is at best impervious and at least resistant to personal beliefs, attitudes and perspectives. However, there have been suggestions that such a view of the world is not tenable. Different perspectives including feminist, rhetorical, and pragma-dialectical, question the popular ideology and suggest that the kind of objectivity does not really exist. I will rely on Bem, Lakoff, Gilbert among others. I will conclude that the examples are not without meaning and the term can, when properly understood, be useful. An example using an editorial from the Toronto Globe 2 ̆ 6 Mail regarding baseball will illustrate the point of the essay...|$|E
