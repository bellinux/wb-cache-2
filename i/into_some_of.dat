5|$|By mid-2011, Arafiles {{had moved}} his {{practice}} to East Texas and was affiliated with Cozby Germany Hospital in Grand Saline. A hospital administrator there {{said that she}} had looked <b>into</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> the allegations against Arafiles that she found on the Internet but that no one had formally complained to her about the doctor. In November 2011, Arafiles entered a guilty plea on two counts of misuse of official information. Two other charges were dismissed and a pending indictment for aggravated perjury was dropped. Arafiles was forced to surrender his medical license, sentenced to 60 days in jail and five years of probation, and assessed a $5,000 fine.|$|E
5|$|Because he was {{painting}} fresco, the plaster was laid {{in a new}} section every day, called a giornata. At {{the beginning of each}} session, the edges would be scraped away and a new area laid down. The edges between giornate remain slightly visible; thus, they give a good idea of how the work progressed. It was customary for fresco painters to use a full-sized detailed drawing, a cartoon, to transfer a design onto a plaster surface—many frescoes show little holes made with a stiletto, outlining the figures. Here Michelangelo broke with convention; once confident the intonaco had been well applied, he drew directly onto the ceiling. His energetic sweeping outlines can be seen scraped <b>into</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> the surfaces, while on others a grid is evident, indicating that he enlarged directly onto the ceiling from a small drawing.|$|E

5|$|Burns {{that affect}} only the {{superficial}} skin layers {{are known as}} superficial or first-degree burns. They appear red without blisters and pain typically lasts around three days. When the injury extends <b>into</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> the underlying skin layer, it is a partial-thickness or second-degree burn. Blisters are frequently present and they are often very painful. Healing can require up to eight weeks and scarring may occur. In a full-thickness or third-degree burn, the injury extends to all layers of the skin. Often there is no pain and the burn area is stiff. Healing typically does not occur on its own. A fourth-degree burn additionally involves injury to deeper tissues, such as muscle, tendons, or bone. The burn is often black and frequently leads to loss of the burned part.|$|E

25|$|Cities arose and flourished, {{especially}} in Flanders and Brabant. As the cities grew in wealth and power, {{they started to}} buy certain privileges for themselves from the sovereign, including city rights, the right to self-government {{and the right to}} pass laws. In practice, this meant that the wealthiest cities became quasi-independent republics in their own right. Two of the most important cities were Brugge and Antwerp (in Flanders) which would later develop <b>into</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> the most important cities and ports in Europe.|$|E

25|$|Algebraic {{geometry}} {{occupies a}} central place in modern mathematics and has multiple conceptual connections with such diverse fields as complex analysis, topology and number theory. Initially {{a study of}} systems of polynomial equations in several variables, the subject of algebraic geometry starts where equation solving leaves off, and it becomes even more {{important to understand the}} intrinsic properties of the totality of solutions of a system of equations, than to find a specific solution; this leads <b>into</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> the deepest areas in all of mathematics, both conceptually and in terms of technique.|$|E

25|$|Some Cucuteni-Trypillia {{communities}} {{have been found}} that contain a special building located {{in the center of}} the settlement, which archaeologists have identified as sacred sanctuaries. Artifacts have been found inside these sanctuaries, some of them having been intentionally buried in the ground within the structure, that are clearly of a religious nature, and have provided insights <b>into</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> the beliefs, and perhaps some of the rituals and structure, of the members of this society. Additionally, artifacts of an apparent religious nature have also been found within many domestic Cucuteni-Trypillia homes.|$|E
25|$|Although studies {{carried out}} before the {{renovation}} work began showed most of the raft foundation was still in good condition, water from the adjacent Singapore River had seeped slowly <b>into</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> the foundation's cells over the years, flooding parts of the old basement. As a result, a new precast concrete platform was built over the cells, and waterproofing added. Pillars supporting the entire building now rest on the platform. The engineering team installed {{a new set of}} five drainage pumps to counteract the slow seepage of river water. As the building sits on solid rock foundation, no additional piling was required.|$|E
25|$|Around 1000 AD, due {{to several}} {{agricultural}} developments, the economy started to develop {{at a fast}} pace, and the higher productivity allowed workers to farm more land or to become tradesmen. Towns grew around monasteries and castles, and a mercantile middle class began to develop in these urban areas, especially in Flanders and later also Brabant. Wealthy cities started to buy certain privileges for themselves from the sovereign. In practice, this meant that Brugge and Antwerp became quasi-independent republics {{in their own right}} and would later develop <b>into</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> the most important cities and ports in Europe.|$|E
