40|$|Objective {{to assess}} {{accuracy}} of the age-based formula and length-based formula for predicting endotracheal tube (ET) size in children with failure to thrive, who underwent cardiac surgery. Methods We conducted a retrospective study of children aged 2 - 8 years, who underwent cardiac surgery at Chiang Mai University Hospital from March 1, 2008 to February 31, 2009. Children with failure to thrive, defi ned as being below the 3 rd percentile weight for their age on a national growth chart, and having oral intubation with uncuffed ET were identifi ed and reviewed. Tracheal tube size selections using the age-based formula (<b>internal</b> <b>diameter</b> (<b>mm)</b> = age in years + 16 divided by 4) {{as well as the}} length-based formula (the Broselow tape) were compared with the actual size of the ET used. Results Sixty children were enrolled in this study. The age-predicted ET size matched the actual size exactly in 37 children (61. 7 %; 95 % CI, 49 %- 72. 9 %). It underestimated the actual ET size in 10 cases (16. 7 %) and overestimated in 13 (21. 6 %). The length – predicted ET size matched the actual size exactly in 7 children (11. 7 %; 95 % CI, 5. 8 %- 22. 2 %), but it was underestimated in the remaining 53 (88. 3 %). Conclusion The age-based prediction of ET size can be applied to most children with failure to thrive and underlying heart diseases. In contrast, the length-based formula is an inaccurate means to predict ET size in these children. Chiang Mai Medical Journal 2010; 49 (2) : 49 - 52...|$|E

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfillment}} of the requirements for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. A nebulized flame ionization detector interfaced with LC was examined and {{found to be more}} versatile in applications than common LC detectors, such as UV, RID, ELSD and CAD. The technique can be used for both volatile and non-volatile analytes. It is compatible with gradient elution and can be used for the analysis of non chromophore-possessing analytes. The calibration plots of non-volatile analytes were linear in contrast to other aerosol-based detectors, such as ELSD and CAD. The technique was examined in three consecutive stages; optimization of the FID, testing the response patterns of analytes (volatile and non-volatile) and applications to the analysis of compounds of diverse functional groups. The optimum conditions for the operation of the FID were: hydrogen, 157 ml/min; nitrogen, 250 ml/min; air, 654 ml/min; spray chamber <b>internal</b> <b>diameter,</b> 40 <b>mm,</b> collector <b>internal</b> <b>diameter,</b> 4 <b>mm</b> and eluent (water), 1 ml/min.

30|$|Although most CHF {{experiments}} with nanofluids {{have been carried}} out under pool-boiling conditions, there have been a very limited number of CHF studies in forced convection condition. A group at MIT (USA) reported {{for the first time that}} nanofluids can significantly enhance the CHF under subcooled flow boiling conditions [37, 38]. They conducted subcooled flow boiling experiments in a stainless steel tube with an <b>internal</b> <b>diameter</b> of 8.7 <b>mm</b> at a pressure of 0.1 MPa for three different mass fluxes (1, 500, 2, 000, and 2, 500 kg/m 2 s).

40|$|Highly {{transparent}} {{vacuum chambers}} {{adapted to the}} requirements of the detectors have been installed in the four LEP experimental regions. The design of the chambers and their support systems is described together with the installation procedures for these long and fragile parts. The background in the defectors has been minimised by both a sophisticated mechanical design and special vacuum conditioning. The vacuum results achieved during LBP operation and the implications on the background are discussed. The mechanical design {{of a new generation of}} vacuum chambers due to be installed in early 1991 is also presented with its technical options, the use of new materials, and the reduced beam pipe di-mensions. General On the evening of 13 August, 1989, only one month after the first particle injection, physics runs started at LEP (Large Electron-Positron Ring) [I]. The first data were taken by the four large experimental set-ups: L 3, ALEPII, OPAL and DELPHI, and almost immt~dintcly, Z‘J sig-natures were detected in the control rooms. But bcf’ore they reach the surrounding detectors, the particles generated by collisions of primary beams must escape through the vncuum chamber. This vacuum chamber is the physical interface between the collider and the detectors and should therefore be designed according to their requirements: in particular, an optimised transparency to particles, associated with the ability to maintain an ultra-high vacuum, and to have good elcclrical conductivity and minimum high-frequency losses as well as perfect shielding of the detectors from the beam-induced noise. Moreover the present vacuum chambers exhibit a large <b>internal</b> <b>diameter</b> (156 <b>mm)</b> in order that no particle-generated synchrotron radiation hits their wall. Since the start-up of LEI’, knowledge 01 the machine buhaviour has improved. By using the collimators, it should be possible to reduce the <b>internal</b> <b>diameter</b> of the vacuum chamber and conscquenfly its wall thickness, and to leave space for new vertex detectors. In February 1990, the decision was taken to install such smaller vacuum chambers, with a reduced <b>internal</b> <b>diameter</b> (106 <b>mm),</b> by the end of this year...|$|R

The availability {{of this new}} composite material introduces new possibilities for constructing field instruments that are as strong as, or stronger than, equipment made from steel and other metals. One advantage is a significant weight reduction. A 10. 5 metre coring set in standard stainless and soft steel weighs around 16 kg, whereas the total weight of a similar CFC set is 5. 2 kg, giving a weight reduction of almost 70 %.
