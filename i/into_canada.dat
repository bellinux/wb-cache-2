5|$|Before the Interstate era, M-21 {{extended}} {{across the}} entire Lower Peninsula, from the junction with US31 in Holland near Lake Michigan east to the St. Clair River at Port Huron, and crossed <b>into</b> <b>Canada</b> where the Blue Water Bridge is currently located.|$|E
5|$|Seven {{rivers in}} this list cross or form {{international}} boundaries. Two—the Yukon and Columbia rivers—begin in Canada and {{flow into the}} United States. Three—the Milk and Saint Lawrence rivers and the Red River of the North—begin in the United States and flow <b>into</b> <b>Canada.</b> Of these, only the Milk River crosses the international border twice, leaving and then re-entering the United States. Two rivers, the Colorado and the Rio Grande, begin in the United States and flow into or form a border with Mexico. In addition, the drainage basins of the Mississippi and Missouri rivers extend <b>into</b> <b>Canada,</b> and the basin of the Gila River extends into Mexico.|$|E

5|$|The {{security}} perimeter even extended into {{the waters of}} Lake Ontario and included a Maritime Security Operation with numerous Police vessels and the Canadian Coast Guard Ship Griffon patrolling to discourage international demonstrators from unlawful entry <b>into</b> <b>Canada.</b>|$|E
5|$|Aboriginal genetic {{studies suggest}} that the first {{inhabitants}} of the Americas share a single ancestral population, one that developed in isolation, conjectured to be Beringia. The isolation of these peoples in Beringia might have lasted 10,000–20,000 years. Around 16,500 years ago, the glaciers began melting, allowing people to move south and east <b>into</b> <b>Canada</b> and beyond.|$|E
5|$|Coffin {{continued}} to farm {{after moving to}} Indiana and {{within a year of}} his arrival he opened the first dry-goods store in Newport. In later years Coffin credited the success of his business, which he expanded in the 1830s, with providing him the ability to become heavily involved in the costly enterprise of the Underground Railroad, a costly and risky enterprise that provided a network of stopover sites for fugitive slaves as they traveled north <b>into</b> <b>Canada.</b>|$|E

5|$|In France, the Blue Picardy was {{recognised}} as {{a separate}} breed in 1938, and there are about 1000 puppies born in France each year. The first person to import the Blue Picardy Spaniel <b>into</b> <b>Canada</b> was Ronald Meunier of Saint-Julien, Quebec, around 1987, and the breed was then recognised by the Canadian Kennel Club effective 1 June 1995. The breed is recognised by the American Rare Breed Association, which uses the same standard as the Fédération Cynologique Internationale.|$|E
5|$|Hours before Isabel made {{landfall}} on North Carolina, the National Hurricane Center {{issued a}} tropical storm warning {{for a portion of}} the southern Long Island coastline from the New Jersey/New York border to Moriches. About a day before the hurricane moved ashore, forecasters estimated the hurricane possessed a 10% chance of passing within 75miles (120km) of New York City. Other portions of southern New England were estimated to have similar probabilities, with the same forecast predicting a 3% chance for it passing within 75miles (120km) of Eastport, Maine. By about two days before Isabel struck land until several hours after it moved ashore, forecasters predicted the storm to pass over western New York as a transitioning tropical cyclone before passing <b>into</b> <b>Canada</b> as an extratropical cyclone.|$|E
5|$|Initially, {{the police}} focused their law {{enforcement}} efforts {{on dealing with}} the illegal consumption of alcohol, which was considered to promote violent behaviour among the First Nations. By the 1880s, however, the police also began to tackle horse theft. Horse stealing was common among the First Nations on the prairies: it formed part of intertribal competition and warfare, and the stolen horses enabled their hunting expeditions. In part the police crackdown was driven by the Department for Indian Affairs, who believed {{that the practice of}} horse theft was slowing the assimilation of the First Nations into broader Canadian society. The authorities were also concerned that if the First Nations were allowed to steal horses from across the border in the United States, it could provoke a military intervention <b>into</b> <b>Canada.</b>|$|E

5|$|Richards' {{addiction}} to heroin delayed {{his arrival in}} Toronto; the other members had already arrived, waiting for him, and sent him a telegram asking him where he was. On 24 February 1977, when Richards and his family flew in from London, they were temporarily detained by Canada Customs after Richards was found {{in possession of a}} burnt spoon and hash residue. Three days later, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, armed with an arrest warrant for Pallenberg, discovered 22 grams of heroin in Richards' room. Richards was charged with importing narcotics <b>into</b> <b>Canada,</b> an offence that carried a minimum seven-year sentence.|$|E
5|$|Seventeen {{hours after}} lifting off at sunrise in Japan, the men {{began to see}} the sun rise again over the Yukon—it was a very short day for them, and none had been able to sleep for the {{excitement}} of the trip, the stimulant benzedrine, and the penetrating cold. Crossing <b>into</b> <b>Canada,</b> the headwinds grew stronger still, and a load of hard rime ice and clear ice was visible on the wings. Though the B-29s had been delivered to the war front complete with deicing equipment, such gear had been removed months before to reduce weight and therefore increase combat range and speed. The ice load picked up in the night would have to be endured until it melted off at lower altitudes.|$|E
5|$|The Toronto Raptors are a Canadian {{professional}} basketball team based in Toronto, Ontario. The Raptors {{compete in the}} National Basketball Association (NBA), as a member club of the league's Eastern Conference Atlantic Division. The team was established in 1995, along with the Vancouver Grizzlies, {{as part of the}} NBA's expansion <b>into</b> <b>Canada.</b> When the Grizzlies relocated to Memphis, Tennessee to become the Memphis Grizzlies in 2001, the Raptors became the only Canadian-based team in the NBA. They originally played their home games at SkyDome, before moving eastward along Bremner Boulevard to the Air Canada Centre in 1999.|$|E

5|$|The {{history of}} the breed is {{uncertain}} prior to the mid-19th century with two theories being prevalent. Clumber Spaniels have been kept and bred by various British Monarchs, including Prince Albert, King Edward VII and King George V. They were introduced <b>into</b> <b>Canada</b> in 1844, and in 1884 {{became one of the}} first ten breeds recognised by the American Kennel Club. The breed can suffer from a variety of breed-specific ailments varying in severity from temporary lameness due to bone growth whilst young to hip dysplasia or spinal disc herniation.|$|E
5|$|Two {{days after}} Lincoln's assassination, on April 16, 1865, Hines was in Detroit, Michigan, {{when he was}} mistaken for John Wilkes Booth, {{who was then the}} subject of a massive manhunt. After finding himself in a fight, Hines jumped several fences and made his way to Detroit's wharf. He waited for a {{ferryboat}} to empty its passengers and then forced the captain at gunpoint to take him across the Detroit River to Canada. On arrival, Hines apologized to the captain and gave him five dollars. Hines' exploit led to the mistaken rumor that Booth had escaped <b>into</b> <b>Canada.</b>|$|E
5|$|At {{this point}} Tom Loker {{returns to the}} story. Loker has changed {{as the result of}} being healed by the Quakers. George, Eliza, and Harry have also {{obtained}} their freedom after crossing <b>into</b> <b>Canada.</b> In Louisiana, Uncle Tom almost succumbs to hopelessness as his faith in God is tested by the hardships of the plantation. However, he has two visions, one of Jesus and one of Eva, which renew his resolve to remain a faithful Christian, even unto death. He encourages Cassy to escape, which she does, taking Emmeline with her. When Tom refuses to tell Legree where Cassy and Emmeline have gone, Legree orders his overseers to kill Tom. As Tom is dying, he forgives the overseers who savagely beat him. Humbled by the character of the man they have killed, both men become Christians. Very shortly before Tom's death, George Shelby (Arthur Shelby's son) arrives to buy Tom's freedom but finds he is too late.|$|E

5|$|Cloud tops {{around the}} center warmed again early on September 15, and Isabel {{weakened}} to a Category 4 hurricane. Later that day, the inner core of deep convection began to deteriorate while the eye decayed in appearance. As a ridge to its northwest build southeastward, {{it resulted in}} Isabel decelerating as it turned to the north-northwest. Increasing vertical wind shear contributed in weakening the hurricane further, and Isabel weakened to a Category2 hurricane on September 16 while located 645miles (1035km) southeast of Cape Hatteras, North Carolina. Convection remained minimal, though outflow retained excellent organization, and Isabel remained a Category2 hurricane for twodays, until it made landfall between Cape Lookout and Ocracoke Island on September 18, with winds of 105mph (165km/h). It weakened after it made landfall, though due to its fast forward motion, Isabel remained a hurricane until it reached western Virginia, early on September 19. After passing through West Virginia as a tropical storm, Isabel became extratropical over Western Pennsylvania, near Pittsburgh. The system crossed Lake Erie <b>into</b> <b>Canada.</b> Early on September 20, the extratropial remnant of Isabel was absorbed by a larger extratropical storm, over the Cochrane District of Ontario.|$|E
5|$|During the 1840s, Indiana {{completed}} {{the removal of}} the Native American tribes. The majority of the Potawatomi voluntarily relocated to Kansas in 1838. Those who did not leave were forced to travel to Kansas in what came to be called the Potawatomi Trail of Death, leaving only the Pokagon Band of Potawatomi Indians in the Indiana area. The majority of the Miami tribe left in 1846, although many members of the tribe were permitted to remain in the state on lands they held privately {{under the terms of the}} 1818 Treaty of St. Mary's. The other tribes were also convinced to leave the state voluntarily through the payment of subsidies and land grants further west. The Shawnee migrated westward to settle in Missouri, and the Lenape migrated <b>into</b> <b>Canada.</b> The other minor tribes in the state, including the Wea, moved westward, mostly to Kansas.|$|E
5|$|Early on October26, a {{tropical}} depression {{formed in the}} central Gulf of Mexico, and intensified into Hurricane Juan while meandering northward. The storm had a large wind field and was somewhat subtropical in nature. Due to weak steering currents, Juan looped once offshore Louisiana and later looped again over the state, weakening into {{a tropical}} storm over land on October29. The storm turned eastward and later northeastward, striking just west of Pensacola, Florida late on October31. Juan turned to the north over land and became extratropical on November1 over Tennessee. After the remnants of Juan continued to the north <b>into</b> <b>Canada,</b> it spawned an occluded low in the Tennessee Valley. This low continued to the east through North Carolina, bringing moderate rainfall throughout the region, and saturating soils; overcast skies and the weak sunlight of early November prevented much of the rains from evaporating.|$|E
