Two kinds of motion blurring effects can be removed in the video, one is the blurring effect caused by hand shaking, {{the other is the}} blurring effect caused by a fast moving object. For the blurring caused by hand shaking, PSF is estimated by comparing the stable area in blurry frame and non-blurry frame, so the Richardson-Lucy algorithm can restore the blurry frame by non-blind deconvolution. We also propose {{a framework}} to <b>deblur</b> the motion blurring objects which move fast in the video.

50|$|In {{order to}} {{identify}} {{the size of the}} blur (needed to decode depth information) in the captured image, two approaches can be used: 1) <b>deblurring</b> the captured image with different blurs, or 2) learning some linear filters that identify the type of blur.|$|E
50|$|This is {{capture of}} {{optically}} coded images, followed by computational decoding to produce new images.Coded aperture imaging was mainly applied in astronomy or X-ray imaging {{to boost the}} image quality. Instead of a single pin-hole, a pinhole pattern is applied in imaging, and deconvolution is performed to recover the image. In coded exposure imaging, the on/off state of the shutter is coded to modify the kernel of motion blur. In this way motion <b>deblurring</b> becomes a well-conditioned problem. Similarly, in a lens based coded aperture, the aperture can be modified by inserting a broadband mask. Thus, out of focus <b>deblurring</b> becomes a well-conditioned problem. The coded aperture can also improve the quality in light field acquisition using Hadamard transform optics.|$|E

We propose {{a new approach}} for controlling exploration of static displays through near-peripheral stimuli, and report results of an evaluation of its effectiveness. 10 participants viewed full screen displays of 60 blurred pictures (Gaussian filtering). As soon as a fixation (first strategy) or a gaze sample (second strategy) was detected next to the current stimulus, the area surrounding it was <b>deblurred.</b> An image was totally <b>deblurred</b> when all stimuli had thus attracted the user's gaze. Stimuli are blinking <b>deblurred</b> circles (radius: 1 deg visual angle). They appear in predefined positions on the screen, one at a time. For each picture, successive stimulus positions on the screen reproduce observed gaze patterns. The current stimulus is visible only if the visual angle between its position {{on the screen and}} the position of the user's current fixation is superior to 8 deg (to avoid users noticing it) and inferior to 14 deg.

40|$|International audienceVideo {{camera is}} now {{commonly}} used and demand of capturing a single frame from video sequence is increasing. Since resolution of video camera is usually lower than digital camera and video data usually contains a many motion blur in the sequence, simple frame capture can produce only low quality image; image restoration technique is inevitably required. In this paper, we propose {{a method to}} restore a sharp and high-resolution image from a video sequence by motion <b>deblur</b> for each frame followed by super-resolution technique. Since the frame-rate of the video camera is high and variance of feature appearance in successive frames and motion of feature points are usually small, we can still estimate scene geometries from video data with blur. Therefore, by using such geometric information, we first apply motion <b>deblur</b> for each frame, and then, super-resolve the images from the <b>deblurred</b> image set. For better result, we also propose an adaptive super-resolution technique considering different defocus blur effects dependent on depth.

50|$|Spectral regularization is {{any of a}} {{class of}} regularization {{techniques}} used in machine learning to control the impact of noise and prevent overfitting. Spectral regularization {{can be used in}} a broad range of applications, from <b>deblurring</b> images to classifying emails into a spam folder and a non-spam folder.

50|$|The {{objective}} of image restoration techniques {{is to reduce}} noise and recover resolution loss. Image processing techniques are performed either in the image domain or the frequency domain. The most straightforward and a conventional technique for image restoration is deconvolution, which is performed in the frequency domain and after computing the Fourier transform of both the image and the PSF and undo the resolution loss caused by the blurring factors. This deconvolution technique, because of its direct inversion of the PSF which typically has poor matrix condition number, amplifies noise and creates an imperfect deblurred image. Also, conventionally the blurring process {{is assumed to be}} shift-invariant. Hence more sophisticated techniques, such as regularized <b>deblurring,</b> have been developed to offer robust recovery under different types of noises and blurring functions.|$|E

30|$|Stefan Harmeling et al. [17] are {{the first}} to propose a blind {{deconvolution}} algorithm for astronomical imaging working in online mode. Instead of minimizing the total overall cost function for all blurry images, they just minimized the cost function for one image at each time and the current <b>deblurred</b> image was used as the initial estimate for the next time recursively. Thus, the <b>deblurred</b> image was refined gradually along with the image capturing. Hirsch et al. [18] extended the online blind deconvolution algorithm by incorporating super-resolution. The different information contained in different LR images results from blurring with different blur kernels. Both online blind deconvolution (OBD) and its SR extension (OBDSR) get the HR image estimate by minimizing an auxiliary function rather than minimizing the cost function directly to avoid image overfitting, while sometimes the strategy failed, especially when the noise of LR images is large.|$|R
50|$|<b>Deblurring</b> is {{the process}} of {{removing}} blurring artifacts from images, such as blur caused by defocus aberration or motion blur. The blur is typically modeled as the convolution of a (sometimes space- or time-varying) point spread function with a hypothetical sharp input image, where both the sharp input image (which is to be recovered) and the point spread function are unknown. This is an example of an inverse problem. In almost all cases, there is insufficient information in the blurred image to uniquely determine a plausible original image, making it an ill-posed problem. In addition the blurred image contains additional noise which complicates the task of determining the original image. This is generally solved by the use of a regularization term to attempt to eliminate implausible solutions. This problem is analogous to echo removal in the signal processing domain. Nevertheless, when coherent beam is used for imaging, the point spread function can be modeled mathematically. As the figure on the right illustrates, by proper deconvolution of the point spread function and the image, the resolution can be enhanced several times.|$|E

40|$|Abstract This paper {{presents}} a novel Coprime Blurred Pair (CBP) model for visual data-hiding for security in camera surveillance. While most previous approaches {{have focused on}} completely encrypting the video stream, we introduce a spatial encryption scheme by blurring the image/video contents to create a CBP. Our goal is to obscure detail in public video streams by blur-ring while allowing behavior to be recognized and to quickly <b>deblur</b> the stream so that details are available if behavior is recognized as suspicious. We create a CBP by blurring the same latent image with two unknown kernels. The two kernels are coprime when mapped to bivariate polynomials in the z domain. To <b>deblur</b> the CBP we first use the coprime constraint to approximate the kernels and sample the bivariate CBP polynomials in one dimension on the unit circle. At each sample point, we factor the 1 D polynomial pair and compose the results into a 2 D kernel matrix. Finally, we compute the inverse Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) of the kernel matrices to recover the coprime kernels and then the la-tent video stream. It is therefore only possible to <b>deblur</b> the video stream if a user has access to both streams.

We show that replacing cross-correlation by multidimensional deconvolution (MDD) can deghost, demultiple, and <b>deblur</b> retrieved data. We derive and analyze MDD for perturbed and decomposed wavefields. An interferometric point spread function (PSF) is introduced that can be obtained directly from downhole data. Ghosts, multiples, and blurring effects that may populate the retrieved gathers can be locally diagnosed with the PSF. MDD of perturbed fields can remove ghosts and <b>deblur</b> retrieved data, but it leaves particular multiples in place.

40|$|Astronomical {{images taken}} by {{ground-based}} telescopes suffer degradation due to atmospheric turbulence. This degradation can be tackled by costly hardware-based approaches such as adaptive optics, or by sophisticated software-based {{methods such as}} lucky imaging, speckle imaging, or multi-frame deconvolution. Software-based methods process a sequence of images to reconstruct a <b>deblurred</b> high-quality image.

A novel algorithm is proposed in this paper to reduce geometric distortion as well as space-and-time-varying blur due to strong turbulence. By considering a suitable energy functional, our algorithm first obtains a sharp reference image and a subsampled image sequence containing sharp and mildly distorted image frames with respect to the reference image. The subsampled image sequence is then stabilized by applying the Robust Principal Component Analysis (RPCA) on the deformation fields between image frames and warping the image frames by a quasiconformal map associated with the low-rank part of the deformation matrix. After image frames are registered to the reference image, the low-rank part of them are <b>deblurred</b> via a blind deconvolution, and the <b>deblurred</b> frames are then fused with the enhanced sparse part.
