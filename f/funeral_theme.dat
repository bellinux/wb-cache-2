So yeah, we keep everything, but, man, it's a lot of music and ideas lying on the backups these days. I'm guessing 10 per cent of what we start ends up as something presentable. We feel like a lot of things are interesting for 30 seconds or so, but then what? We could probably sell riffs to rock bands, sell hundreds of riffs or piano themes or whatever, but our main problem is to tie elements together—to 'bring it home,' as they say. We are quite selective." ...|$|E

5000|$|Following {{the end of}} this introduction, a new {{theme in}} B-flat minor, is introduced. This section is titled Scène funèbre (funeral scene) and is solemn and deeply felt, to be played in a very {{sustained}} manner. The piece then becomes more agitated, with more syncopated rhythms and interplay between the violinist and orchestra. As the piece reaches its climax, the <b>funeral</b> <b>theme</b> returns, marked triple forte and this time played by the orchestra and violinist.|$|E

50|$|The second {{movement}} especially {{displays a}} great emotional range, from {{the misery of}} the <b>funeral</b> march <b>theme,</b> to the relative solace of happier, major-key episodes. The finale displays a similar emotional range, and is given a thematic importance then unheard of. In earlier symphonies, the finale was a quick and breezy conclusion; here, the finale is a lengthy set of variations and a fugue.|$|R
50|$|It {{is in this}} {{conclusion}} that Liszt reintroduces each theme from the piece, beginning with the <b>funeral</b> march <b>theme,</b> this time more powerful and emphatic. He then briefly reiterates parts of the A♭-major theme before bringing back the left-hand octave-driven warrior march. However, rather than allowing this theme's intensity to take control again, he limits its duration and ends the piece with a sudden drop into quiet, open staccatissimo chords.|$|R

50|$|In {{addition}} to {{focusing on the}} negotiated nature of social organization, dramaturgy emphasizes {{the manner in which}} the social order is expressed through social interaction, how social organization is enacted, featured and dramatized.

In the second movement, the combined tonality (melody and bass) of the Opus 35 theme's first four bars - E, B↓, B7(A)↑, E - appears in slightly altered form as the <b>funeral's</b> march's second <b>theme</b> (E, B↓, A↑, E) (mvt. II, mm. 17-20), followed by two sudden forte Bs that echo later elements of the theme. That same tonality then appears unaltered as the scherzo's main theme (mvt. III, mm. 93-100).|$|R
5000|$|Arcade Fire (known unofficially as Us Kids Know) is a self-titled {{extended}} play (EP) by the indie {{rock band}} Arcade Fire. The EP {{was recorded in}} Maine, United States, {{during the summer of}} 2002. Arcade Fire was remastered and repackaged for its 2005 re-release by Merge Records for fans after they had [...] "grown obsessed" [...] with the band's debut album, Funeral. It was initially released in 2003 by the band at their shows and website, and then re-released in 2005 by Merge. It received positive reviews from music critics, although some of them noted that it was inferior to their debut album <b>Funeral.</b> Lyrical <b>themes</b> of Arcade Fire consist of parents, suburbia, new love, dread, and drama. The EP's third track, [...] "No Cars Go", was re-recorded for Arcade Fire's second full-length album, Neon Bible. No Cars Go has been played at the majority of live shows since the EP release. Arcade Fire have also played other songs from the EP, live on every tour since. However it has become less frequent. On their most recent tour, for Reflektor, they notably performed Headlights Look Like Diamonds.|$|R
40|$|Title from PDF {{of title}} page, viewed on August 7, 2015 Dissertation advisor: James MobberleyVitaThesis (D. M. A.) [...] Conservatory of Music and Dance. University of Missouri [...] Kansas City, 2015 “Chamber Symphony” is a symphony for chamber {{orchestra}} (flute/piccolo, oboe/english horn, clarinet, bassoon, two horns in F, piano, and strings) and soprano. It is in a nesting doll structure. That is, there are increasingly smaller forms within the overall largest form; the single symphony form sits within a sonata form whose four sections are comprised of the stereotypical four symphony movements. The whole work gravitates around the tonic of D; starting there, moving through A, F-sharp, B-flat, back to D before finally resting on F. All of these structural elements {{are designed to}} emphasize, enhance, and relate to the text of Walt Whitman’s “O Me! O Life!” which is {{the central part of}} the symphony. At all of its levels “Chamber Symphony” is about memory. Walt Whitman’s text poses the question of what purpose there is in continuing on and committing to the fight to be the best possible version of yourself when the world will continue to give you unlimited reasons not to. For me personally, the last ten years of higher education have been a constant push to try to be the best while constantly having reminders that nothing will be easy. This reminder is the bases for that constant return of the <b>funeral</b> march <b>theme</b> and the barrage of split third chords throughout the work. Some of my favorite memories come from my time singing hymns at camp-fire vesper services during my times at church camp. The second movement serves to be the embodiment of these times and moments. Its hymn theme seeks to fight the funeral music throughout. Those were always the clearest and most peaceful times for me and easily some of the strongest. So, to me, those are the answer to Whitman’s question. It is because of those moments “that the powerful play goes on, and [I] may contribute a verse. ...|$|R
5000|$|The {{movement}} is in sonata form without a development and is characterised by its manipulation of modal expectations. It {{opens with a}} seven- bar C minor Introduction of soft chords in the strings, grouped into a 3+3+1 bar pattern which contrasts with the clear 4+4 grouping of the main <b>theme's</b> <b>funeral</b> march. The march tread of the {{movement is}} suggested beginning at bar 8 {{by a series of}} throbbing chords on beats two and four, pulsing in the string and drum accompaniment under the grave winds and brass melody. An unexpected welling of emotion is heard just before the March section closes at rehearsal 70, followed by a transitory passage featuring a [...] "sigh" [...] motive (rehearsal 70) in the woodwinds. This transition modulates to the second theme in F minor opens with a lyrical but subdued string episode at 71. Then, as if Elgar had lost his sense of restraint, we hear a build-up of dynamic, an increase in tempo, and more imaginative scoring leading to a triumphant F major climax in the brass, marked [...] "Nobilmente e semplice" [...] (rehearsal 76). The [...] "sigh" [...] figure is again heard in the closing thematic area at rehearsal 78, as if to recall earlier grief, slowly melting into the recapitulation of the C minor March theme at rehearsal 79.|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{documents}} mourners’ {{experiences of}} funerals in contemporary Britain, and considers {{the implications of}} these for an understanding of funerals’ social significance. It represents the first time that experiences of these people, who attend funerals but do not contribute to their planning, have been taken into account in an analysis of funerals in contemporary Britain. The data on which the thesis draws have been generated in collaboration with the Mass-Observation Project, a long-running, large-scale qualitative writing project based at the University of Sussex. Participants in the project are self-identified ‘ordinary people’ who were asked to write in detail about the most recent funeral they had been to, as well as the best and worst they had ever attended. These data were analysed thematically. The thesis argues that the three previously identified ‘authorities’ over death and dying of religion/tradition, professional/expert, and individual/self do not fully account for mourners’ experiences of funerals. By examining the ‘doing’ and ‘displaying’ of family at funerals, the thesis demonstrates that for mourners, the family constitutes a further authority over the <b>funeral.</b> Among other <b>themes,</b> the significance of speakers at the funeral and of mourners’ own authenticity are drawn on to then argue that Davies’ theorisation of funerals as ‘words against death’ needs to take account not only of what is done at funerals but who does it; that funerals are also ‘people and their relationships against death’...|$|R
