5|$|Inspired by the 1990s Ninja Gaiden {{series for}} the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES), the 2004 version was {{originally}} set in a re-imagined game world based on another Team Ninja creation, the <b>Dead</b> <b>or</b> <b>Alive</b> (DOA) series of fighting games. However, interviews with Tomonobu Itagaki indicate that the Xbox games are prequels to the NES series and that both possibly share a single continuity.|$|E
5|$|The band's {{music has}} also been {{featured}} in several video games, such as episodes of the <b>Dead</b> <b>or</b> <b>Alive</b> and Grand Theft Auto series, and some video games are centered on the band, like Quest for Fame and Revolution X.

Midgegooroo, Yagan and their group immediately moved from their territory north towards the Helena Valley. On 17 May, Midgegooroo was captured on the Helena River. After a brief, informal trial, he was executed by firing squad. Yagan remained at large for over two months.|$|E

Ayane has a threefold stake in this plot: she wants revenge for Raidou being changed into a monster, for Hayate being brainwashed {{in their attempt to}} realize Project Epsilon, and for the manipulation and death of Genra.

5|$|Before {{the launch}} of the Dreamcast in Japan, Sega {{announced}} the release of its New Arcade Operation Machine Idea (NAOMI) arcade board, which served as a cheaper alternative to the Sega Model 3. NAOMI shared the same technology as the Dreamcast—albeit with twice as much system, video, and audio memory and an 160 Mbyte flash ROM board in place of a GD-ROM drive—allowing nearly identical home conversions of arcade games. Games were ported from NAOMI to the Dreamcast by several leading Japanese arcade companies, including Capcom (Marvel vs. Capcom 2 and Project Justice), Tecmo (<b>Dead</b> <b>or</b> <b>Alive</b> 2), Treasure (Ikaruga), and Sega itself (F355 Challenge and Crazy Taxi).|$|E

Corral, Wyatt {{testified that he}} offered the US$3,600 in Wells Fargo reward money ($1,200 per robber) to Ike Clanton and Frank McLaury in return for {{information}} about the identities of the three robbers. Wyatt testified that he had other motives for his plan, as well; he hoped that arresting the murderers would boost his chances for election as Cochise County sheriff.

5|$|Ninja Gaiden {{is set in}} {{the game}} world of the <b>Dead</b> <b>or</b> <b>Alive</b> series. Located mainly in Japan and the fictional Vigoor Empire, the game draws on Heian period {{structures}} for its Japanese locales—a ninja fortress and village set in the mountains. In contrast the Vigoor Empire, with its capital city of Tairon, is a blend of architectural types from around the world. European-style buildings display Arabic lettering, and the monastery in Tairon exhibits Gothic influences with a vaulted hall, pointed arches, and large stained glass windows. A hidden underground level features statues with the heads of cats, walls covered with carvings, hieroglyphics, Aztec pyramid and a labyrinth. This mix of styles was the result of Itagaki's deliberate refusal to constrain the game's creative process.|$|E
5|$|Returning to Camp Victory {{in their}} Humvee, the team {{encounters}} five armed men in traditional Arab garb and casual attire standing near a Ford Excursion, {{which has a}} flat tire.

They have captured two prisoners featured on the most-wanted Iraqi playing cards. The group comes under fire; when the prisoners attempt to escape in the confusion, {{the leader of the}} mercenaries shoots them, as they are valuable <b>dead</b> <b>or</b> <b>alive.</b> Enemy snipers kill three of the mercenaries, including their leader.

5000|$|Benton {{began her}} career as a Fashion Designer, and moved into {{directing}} in 1982 as half of the directing duo Vaughan and Anthea (with Vaughan Arnell).

5|$|Subsistences online {{multiplayer}} component, titled Metal Gear Online, {{consists of}} five tournament-style game modes, {{each with a}} capacity of up to eight players. This mode pits players, each playing as a generic soldier {{against each other in}} deathmatch battles and variations of capture the flag, using stages, items, maneuvers, and units (such as the KGB, GRU or Ocelot Unit) from the main game. Depending on server settings, each round the highest-scoring player in each unit automatically assumes the role of one of the main characters (or Reiko Hinomoto from Rumble Roses), along with unique abilities and/or items. For example, the highest scoring player on the GRU team would assume the role of Major Raikov, leader of the GRU, next round. Konami's Metal Gear Online service for the PlayStation 2 closed in Japan on December 26, 2006, followed by in North America on April 2, 2007 and in Europe on October 30, 2007, although a fan community has revived it by emulating the servers. As noted above, the online mode, after one of the players unlocks an animal codename, also allowed for the player to play as either Reiko Hinomoto or Rowdy Reiko from Rumble Roses (depending if the player in question was of red team or blue team, respectively). According to Metal Gear series creator Hideo Kojima, he added the characters into the game as secret characters in part due to opportunity: Kojima had earlier been offered a deal with Rumble Roses producer Akari Uchida to make a crossover between Metal Gear and Rumble Roses. However, the Metal Gear development team at the time refused to work with them. Kojima eventually accepted the offer when trying to decide on secret characters for the online mode for Subsistence to tie up loose ends. He also admitted that he originally considered offering Tomonobu Itagaki, at the time the producer of the Tecmo fighting game series <b>Dead</b> <b>or</b> <b>Alive,</b> the opportunity of using one of his characters as a secret character.|$|E

25|$|The {{release of}} <b>Dead</b> <b>or</b> <b>Alive</b> 2 had greatly {{increased}} the series popularity, {{as well as}} Itagaki's. He had sought to create fighting games with details he felt were lacking in other games. In the later iterations, Itagaki has built {{the story of the}} games around themes of family - Kasumi and Ayane in <b>Dead</b> <b>or</b> <b>Alive</b> 3, and Helena in <b>Dead</b> <b>or</b> <b>Alive</b> 4. To date, the series has gone through four iterations with various enhanced editions. A fifth iteration has also been made in his absence.|$|E
