40|$|On-line gas chromatography-combustion-isotope ratio mass {{spectrometry}} (GC-C-IRMS) {{is commonly used}} to measure isotopic ratios at natural abundance {{as well as for}} tracer studies in nutritional and medical research. However, high-precision (13) C <b>isotopic</b> <b>enrichment</b> can also be measured by liquid chromatography-isotope ratio {{mass spectrometry}} (LC-IRMS). Indeed, LC-IRMS can be used, as shown by the new method reported here, to obtain a baseline separation and to measure (13) C <b>isotopic</b> <b>enrichment</b> of underivatised amino acids (Asp, Thr-Ser, Glu, Pro, Gly, Ala, Cys and Val). In case of Val, at natural abundance, the SD(delta(13) C) reported with this method was found to be below 1 per thousand. Another key feature of the new LC-IRMS method reported in this paper is the comparison of the LC-IRMS approach with the conventional GC-C-IRMS determination. To perform this comparative study, <b>isotopic</b> <b>enrichments</b> were measured from underivatised Val and its N(O, S) -ethoxycarbonyl ethyl ester derivative. Between 0. 0 and 1. 0 molar percent excess (MPE) (delta(13) C= - 12. 3 to 150. 8 per thousand), the calculated root-mean-square (rms) of SD was 0. 38 and 0. 46 per thousand and the calculated rms of accuracy was 0. 023 and 0. 005 MPE, respectively, for GC-C-IRMS and LC-IRMS. Both systems measured accurately low <b>isotopic</b> <b>enrichments</b> (0. 002 atom percent excess (APE)) with an SD (APE) of 0. 0004. To correlate the relative (delta(13) C) and absolute (atom%, APE and MPE) <b>isotopic</b> <b>enrichment</b> of Val measured by the GC-C-IRMS and LC-IRMS devices, mathematical equations showing the slope and intercept of the curves were established and validated with experimental data between 0. 0 to 2. 3 MPE. Finally, both GC-C-IRMS and LC-IRMS instruments were also used to assess <b>isotopic</b> <b>enrichment</b> of protein-bound (13) C-Val in tibial epiphysis in a tracer study performed in rats. <b>Isotopic</b> <b>enrichments</b> measured by LC-IRMS and GC-C-IRMS were not statistically different (p> 0. 05). The results of this work indicate that the LC-IRMS was successful for high-precision (13) C isotopic measurements in tracer studies giving (13) C <b>isotopic</b> <b>enrichment</b> similar to the GC-C-IRMS but without the step of GC derivatisation. Therefore, for clinical studies requiring high-precision isotopic measurement, the LC-IRMS is the method of choice to measure the isotopic rati...|$|R
40|$|During plant-transpiration, water {{molecules}} having the lighter stable isotopes of oxygen and hydrogen evaporate and diffuse {{at a faster}} rate through the stomata than molecules having the heavier isotopes, which cause <b>isotopic</b> <b>enrichment</b> of leaf water. Although previous models have assumed that leaf water is well-mixed and isotopically uniform, non-uniform stomatal closure, promoting different enrichments between cells, and different pools of water within leaves, due to morpho-physiological traits, might lead to inaccuracies in isotopic models predicting leaf water enrichment. We evaluate the role of leaf morpho-physiological traits on leaf water <b>isotopic</b> <b>enrichment</b> in woody species occurring in a coastal vegetation of Brazil known as restinga. Hydrogen and oxygen stable isotope values of soil, plant stem and leaf water and leaf traits were measured in six species from restinga vegetation during a drought and a wet period.

40|$|In archaeological studies, the <b>isotopic</b> <b>enrichment</b> {{values of}} carbon and {{nitrogen}} in bone collagen give {{a degree of}} information on dietary composition. The <b>isotopic</b> <b>enrichments</b> of individual amino acids from bone collagen and dietary protein {{have the potential to}} provide more precise information about the components of diet. A limited amount of work has been done on this, although the reliability of these studies is potentially limited by fractionation arising through hydrolysis of whole plant tissue (where reaction between amino acids and carbohydrates may occur) and, for certain amino acids, the use of derivatives (particularly trifluoroacetyl derivatives) for gas chromatography/isotope ratio mass spectrometry (GC/IRMS) analysis. The present study takes the approach of extracting the protein components of plant tissues before hydrolysis and using liquid chromatography/isotope ratio mass spectrometry (LC/IRMS), which does not require derivatisation, for measurement of the <b>isotopic</b> <b>enrichment</b> of the amino acids. The protocol developed offers a methodology for consistent measurement of the δ(13) C values of amino acids, allowing isotopic differences between the individual amino acids from different plant tissues to be identified.

Significant <b>isotopic</b> <b>enrichment</b> of glucan indicated that {{a large proportion of}} fixed carbon was initially sequestered into intracellular chrysolaminaran, and labeled carbon was also quickly used for production of the diatom PLFA 20 : 5 ω 3 and EPS.
