Overall, transactions in the mobile channel are more concentrated to <b>head</b> <b>products</b> compared to the PC channel sales, but the pattern is inconsistent across product categories. Transactions in product categories of high average price (e. g., computers) and low purchase frequency rate (e. g., health care products) are less concentrated to <b>head</b> <b>products</b> in the mobile channel than the PC channel.

40|$|The great mantle plume debate (GPD) {{has been}} going on for 15 years [1 - 7], {{centered}} on whether mantle plumes exist as a result of Earth’s cooling or whether their existence is purely required for convenience in explaining certain Earth phenomena [3]. Despite the mounting evidence that many of the so-called plumes may be localized melting anomalies, the debate is likely to continue. We recognize that the slow progress of the debate results from communication difficulties. Many debaters may not truly appreciate (1) what the mantle plume hypothesis actually is, and (2) none of the petrological, geochemical and geophysical methods widely used can actually provide smoking-gun evidence for or against mantle plume hypothesis. In this short paper, we clarify these issues, and elaborate a geologically effective approach to test the hypothesis. According to the mantle plume hypothesis, a thermal mantle plume must originate from the thermal boundary layer at the core-mantle boundary (CMB), and a large mantle plume head is required to carry the material from the deep mantle to the surface. The plume <b>head</b> <b>product</b> in ocean basins is the oceanic plateau, which is a lithospheric terrane that is large (1000 ’s km across), thick (> 200 km), shallow (2 - 4 km high above the surrounding seafloors), buoyant (1...|$|E
40|$|The study {{consisted}} of two experiments, Experiment 1, selection of seafood processing by-products as protein sources in aquatic animal diets and Experiment 2, substitution of fish meal by seafood processing by-products in seabass diets. In Experiment 1, tuna heads, tuna viscera and shrimp heads were processed as meal product and protein hydrolysate. Protein content and essential amino acid composition of tuna visceral meal and tuna visceral hydrolysate were higher (p< 0. 05) than those produced from tuna heads and shrimp heads. Tuna head meal gave maximum yield of 24. 60 % while tuna viscera gave the maximum yield of 20. 10 % for hydrolysate. In Experiment 2, three-factor factorial study {{consisted of}} types of by-products (tuna viscera and a mixture of tuna viscera and <b>head),</b> <b>product</b> types (meal and hydrolysate) and levels of substitution (0, 25, 50, 75 and 100 %) was carried out. Twenty diets were formulated and fed twice daily until satiation to seabasswith an average initial weight of 3. 25 - 3. 38 g/fish for 10 weeks. Each treatment was composed of 3 replicates in flow-through system with continuous aeration. The results showed {{that there was no}} interaction among types of by-products, product types and substitution levels on growth performance, feed intake, feed conversion ratio (FCR), productive protein value (PPV) and survival rate. However, the interaction between product types and substitution levels was statistically significant (p< 0. 05). Regardless of by-products, final weight, weight gain and specific growth rate (SGR) of fish fed meal products and protein hydrolysate at 0 and 25 % substitution was significantly higher than those at 50, 75 and 100 % substitution. Besides, seabass fed 25 % tuna visceral meal substitution diets had higher feed intake than those fed protein hydrolysate. Substitution at 100 % resulted in the poorest growth performance and the highest FCR. PPV of fish fed diets containing a mixture of tuna viscera and tuna head at 75 and 100 % substitution were significantly the lowest (p< 0. 05). The survival rate was not significantly different among treatments. The results of this study demonstrated that tuna viscera and a mixture of viscera and head can be used to substitute 25 % of fishmeal protein with good growth and feed utilization efficiency comparable to those fed fish meal based diets. Moreover, inclusion of tuna viscera at the stated level increases palatability of the diets...|$|E
