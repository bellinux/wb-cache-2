High-velocity layers are typically highly resistive, whereas sediments - porous and permeable - are typically much less resistive. While high-velocity layers are an acoustic barrier and make seismic ineffective, their electrical resistivity means the magnetic signal passes through almost unimpeded.

However, an important influence is also exerted by the active bottom/lateral aquifer hydraulically connected to the field (called “waterdrive” in reservoir engineering) that may undergo an extensive depressurization also after the field abandonment, thus contributing to enhance the overall land settlement. In the Northern Adriatic basin, Italy, is evaluated using a nonlinear finite element model of three representative gas reservoirs (Chioggia Mare, Dorotea, and Dosso degli Angeli) surrounded by important bottom/lateral aquifers in the interval depth between 1000 and 3300 m.

[...] Humboldt State University, Environmental Systems: Energy, Technology, and Policy, 2014 Hydraulic {{fracturing}} {{of underground}} oil- and <b>gas-bearing</b> <b>formations</b> {{is a well}} stimulation treatment (WST) process used to form fissures in rock formations to improve oil and gas recovery. California???s recent and most prominent bill to regulate hydraulic fracturing, Senate Bill 4 (SB 4), represents the state???s first bill to provide a comprehensive statutory framework for WST regulation in California. New advancements in horizontal drilling and complex chemical compositions have made WST more effective and economical, but, simultaneously, they have made {{oil and gas exploration}} and production more controversial due to potential for environmental and public health risks. SB 4 is commended for taking initiative to regulate WST activities; however, some stakeholders question the efficacy of SB 4 and have remaining concerns regarding hydraulic fracturing in California. In this thesis, I present a stakeholder and policy analysis of hydraulic fracturing in California to gain insight regarding diverse perspectives on the state???s current oil and gas developments. I developed and distributed a research survey to gauge stakeholders??? knowledge, attitudes, and perceptions of SB 4, as well as perceived benefits and concerns of hydraulic fracturing in California. According to the survey results, economic growth, including jobs, is the primary perceived benefit of hydraulic fracturing in California. The foremost concerns are water and air quality. Informed by stakeholder feedback and policy analysis, recommendations are proposed for appropriate policy measures and best practices. It is hoped that the potential influential factors and observations resulting in this thesis will serve as a foundation of inquiry for prospective WSTs...|$|R

The retrieved P wave and S wave velocity images as well as the deduced V p /V s images were interpreted by using experimental measurements of rock physical properties on CF samples to take into account steam/water phase transition mechanisms affecting P wave and S wave velocities. Also, modeling of petrophysical properties for site-relevant rocks constrains the role of overpressured fluids on velocity.

40|$|AbstractHydraulic {{fracturing}} (HF) {{technique has}} been extensively used for the exploitation of unconventional oil and gas reservoirs.

In this paper, the combined finite-discrete element method (FDEM) is adopted to numerically simulate HF and associated MS. Several post-processing tools, including frequency-magnitude distribution (b-value), fractal dimension (D-value), and seismic events clustering, are utilized to interpret numerical results. A non-parametric clustering algorithm designed specifically for FDEM is used to reduce the mesh dependency and extract more realistic seismic information. Simulation results indicated that at the local scale, the HF process tends to propagate following the rock mass discontinuities; while at the reservoir scale, it tends to develop in the direction parallel to the maximum in-situ stress...|$|R
40|$|The quality {{analysis}} of well-logging inversion results {{has always been}} an important part of formation evaluation. The precise calculation of hydrocarbon reserves requires the most possible accurate estimation of porosity, water saturation, and shale and rock-matrix volumes. The local inversion method conventionally used to predict the above model parameters depth-by-depth represents a marginally overdetermined inverse problem, which is rather sensitive to the uncertainty of observed data and limited in estimation accuracy. To reduce the harmful effect of data noise on the estimated model we suggest the interval inversion method, in which an increase of the overdetermination ratio allows a more accurate solution of the well-logging inverse problem. The interval inversion method inverts the data set of a longer depth-interval to predict the vertical distributions of petrophysical parameters in a joint inversion procedure. In formulating the forward problem, we extend the validity of probe response functions to a greater depth-interval assuming the petrophysical parameters depth-dependent, and then we expand the model parameters into series by using Legendre polynomials as basis functions for modeling inhomogeneous formations. We solve the inverse problem for much smaller number of expansion coefficients than data to derive the petrophysical parameters in a stable overdetermined inversion procedure. The added advantage of the interval inversion method is that the layer-thicknesses and suitably chosen zone parameters can be estimated automatically by the inversion procedure to refine the results of both inverse and forward modeling. We define depth-dependent model covariance and correlation matrices to compare the quality of the local and interval inversion results. A detailed study using well logs measured from a Hungarian <b>gas-bearing</b> unconsolidated <b>formation</b> demonstrates that the greatly overdetermined interval inversion procedure can be effectively used in reducing the estimation errors in shaly sand formations, which may refine significantly the results of reserve calculation...|$|R
40|$|Production of {{hydrocarbons}} from low-permeability shale reservoirs {{has become}} economically feasible {{thanks in part}} to advances in horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing. Together, these two techniques help to create a network of highly-permeable fractures, which act as fluid conduits from the reservoir to the wellbore. The efficacy of a fracturing treatment can best be determined through fracture conductivity analysis. Fracture conductivity is defined as the product of fracture permeability and fracture width, and describes both how much and how easily fluid can flow through fractures. It is therefore directly related to well performance. The goal of this work is to explore fracture conductivity of Marcellus shale samples fractured in both horizontal and vertical orientations. The Marcellus shale, located primarily in Pennsylvania, Ohio, West Virginia, New York, and Maryland, is the largest <b>gas-bearing</b> shale <b>formation</b> in North America, and its development has significant implications on regional economies, the northeast United States? energy infrastructure, and the availability of petrochemical plant feedstock. In this work, a series of experiments was conducted to determine the propped fracture conductivity of 23 different samples from Elimsport and Allenwood, Pennsylvania. Before conductivity measurements were taken, the pedigree of samples was verified through XRD analysis, elastic rock properties were measured and compared against literature values, and fracture surface contours were mapped and measured. Fracture conductivity of both horizontally and vertically-fracture samples was determined by measuring the pressure drop of nitrogen gas through a modified API conductivity cell. Results show that fracture conductivity varies as a function of fracture orientation only when anisotropy of the rock?s mechanical properties is pronounced. It is hypothesized that the anisotropy of Young?s Modulus and Poisson?s Ratio {{play a significant role in}} fracture mechanics, and therefore in the width of hydraulically-induced fractures. Ultimately, the experiments conducted as part of this work show that fracture conductivity trends are strongly tied to both proppant concentration and the rock?s mechanical properties...|$|R
40|$|The Gasbuggy site is in {{northern}} New Mexico in the San Juan Basin, Rio Arriba County (Figure 1 - 1). The Gasbuggy experiment {{was designed to}} evaluate the use of a nuclear detonation to enhance natural gas production from the Pictured Cliffs <b>Formation,</b> a tight, <b>gas-bearing</b> sandstone <b>formation.</b> The 29 -kiloton-yield nuclear device was placed in a 17. 5 -inch wellbore at 4, 240 feet (ft) below ground surface (bgs), approximately 40 ft below the Pictured Cliffs/Lewis shale contact, in an attempt to force the cavity/chimney formed by the detonation up into the Pictured Cliffs Sandstone. The test was conducted below the southwest quarter of Section 36, Township 29 North, Range 4 West, New Mexico Principal Meridian. The device was detonated on December 10, 1967, creating a 335 -ft-high chimney above the detonation point and a cavity 160 ft in diameter. The gas produced from GB-ER (the emplacement and reentry well) during the post-detonation production tests was radioactive and diluted, primarily by carbon dioxide. After 2 years, the energy content of the gas had recovered to 80 percent of the value of gas in conventionally developed wells in the area. There is currently no technology capable of remediating deep underground nuclear detonation cavities and chimneys. Consequently, the U. S. Department of Energy (DOE) must continue to manage the Gasbuggy site to ensure that no inadvertent intrusion into the residual contamination occurs. DOE has complete control over the 1 / 4 section (160 acres) containing the shot cavity, and no drilling is permitted on that property. However, oil and gas leases are on the surrounding land. Therefore, the most likely route of intrusion and potential exposure would be through contaminated natural gas or contaminated water migrating into a producing natural gas well outside the immediate vicinity of ground zero. The purpose of this report is to describe the current site conditions and evaluate the potential health risks posed by the most plausible contaminant exposure scenario, drilling of natural gas wells near the site. The results of this risk evaluation will guide DOE's future surveillance and monitoring activities in the area to ensure that site conditions are adequately protective of human health. This evaluation is not a comprehensive risk assessment for the site; it is intended to provide assurance that DOE's monitoring approach can detect the presence of site-related contamination at levels well below those that would pose an unacceptable risk to human health...|$|R
40|$|Tyt. z nagłówka. Bibliogr. s. 514. Permian Basin covers {{one of the}} world's largest <b>gas-bearing</b> clastic <b>formation</b> - Permian Rotliegend Group. Reservoirs are {{supplied}} by Carboniferous sources, lying directly beneath. Permian Rotliegend sandstones belong to the most important gas bearing formations in Poland. They were deposited in playa, fluvial and aeolian depositional systems (Kiersnowski et al. 2010). Both conventional and unconventional accumulations occur in those sediments. Some of unconventional accumulations occur in conditions of Basin-Centered Gas System (BCGS). Basin-Centered Gas Systems are unconventionals with the greatest economical potential in the world. They are gas saturated, abnormally pressured, a low-permeability reservoirs commonly showing lack of a down - dip water contact. Two types BCGS can be distinguished - direct and indirect. Differentiation results from the attributes of the system - type of organic matter, thermal maturity, sealing and the distance of hydrocarbons migration (Law 2002). Direct Basin-Centered Gas Systems may occur {{in the area of}} the Polish part of Permian Basin. The purpose of present studies was indicating Permian Rotliegend sandstones as a reservoir rocks for direct Basin-Centered Gas Accumulations, which are associated with BCGS, according to reflectance of vitrinite measurement and permeability. Analysis were performed on eight core samples located within the aeolian sediments of Eastern Erg (center of Polish part of Permian Basin) from the depth interval 3702 — 4200 m. Vitrinite reflectance measurement (Ro) were performed on polished pellets, under oil immersion with Zeiss Axioplan microscope in reflected white light. Mean reflectance values were calculated for all measurement. Permeability measurements were done on plug-type samples (cylindrical with diameter 25. 4 mm and length of between 20 - 40 mm. Plugs were drilled perpendicularly to the cylinder axis. In each sample organic matter was dominated by vitrinite. It could indicate humic organic matter typical for gas prone source rocks. The measured vitrinite reflectance values confirmed that organic matter reached the maturation stages of hydrocarbon generation, characteristic for the gas window phase (Ro > 2 %). Permeability results shown typical values for tight sandstones from BCGS, lower than 0. 1 mD. Performed studies on aeolian Rotliegend sandstones from Eastern Erg area confirmed the opportunity of Basin-Centered Gas Accumulations occurrence in those sediments. Humic type of organic matter and values of vitrinite reflectance corresponding to gas window phase are specific for BSGAs. Analyzed samples of aeolian Rotliegend sandstones are characterized by very low permeability, not exceeding 0. 1 mD and therefore capillary sealing of the accumulation. Carboniferous source rock located directly beneath reservoir rock, confirmed short distance of hydrocarbons migration. All mentioned factors allow classifying aeolian Rotliegend sandstones as a reservoir rock within Basin-Centered Gas System. Dostępny również w formie drukowanej.
