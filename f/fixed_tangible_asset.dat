40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{investigate}} the choices of Greek firms regarding the measurement of an item of a <b>fixed</b> <b>tangible</b> <b>asset</b> subsequent to its initial recognition, including impairment recognition, under IAS 16 and IAS 36 using a sample of Greek firms for the years 2005, 2007 and 2009. Results indicate that the cost model is more likely to be adopted by the more leveraged firms. In addition, it has been examined the compliance of the sample firms with disclosure requirements of IAS 16 and IAS 36. It appears that the disclosure compliance of the sample firms with the disclosure requirements of IAS 16 and 36 is influenced by firm's choice of valuation method for the measurement of an item of a <b>fixed</b> <b>tangible</b> <b>asset</b> subsequent to its initial recognition. It appears that the firms that adopt the revaluation method exhibit lower compliance rates...|$|E
40|$|We study, {{focusing}} {{on real estate}} and other fixed tangible assets, how the heterogeneous effects of real estate prices influence real estate investment behavior. Theoretically, expectations of declining real estate prices not only reduce overall fixed tangible investment through a collateral channel but also reduce real estate investment through intertemporal substitution of demand. By employing a unique dataset on firms’ land transactions and overall investment in Japan during the period 1997 through 2006, we examine these predictions to find the following. First, the entire <b>fixed</b> <b>tangible</b> <b>asset</b> investment is positively associated with {{the growth rate of}} land prices, which evidences the collateral channel. In contrast, land investment has no statistically significant relationships with land price growth. Second, a decomposition of land investment into land purchases and sales shows that land sales actually decrease when the growth rate of prices falls. Third, large firms and firms that acquired land during and shortly after the bubble period tend to reduce land sales. This is consistent with Geltner’s (2014) argument that potential sellers of land set their reservation prices at their purchase prices and are reluctant to sell land {{in the face of a}} persistent drop in its price. 基盤研究(S) = Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (S...|$|E

Since <b>tangible</b> <b>fixed</b> <b>assets</b> are the only assets {{that can be used}} as mortgage collateral in Spain, we relate those assets with the debts they may secure.
