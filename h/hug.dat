5|$|The {{third stage}} of the Hornet Upgrade Program sought to rectify {{airframe}} damage. <b>HUG</b> Phase 3.1 involved minor structural work to all aircraft as they passed through other phases of the program. The centre fuselages of the ten Hornets assessed as suffering {{the greatest amount of}} structural damage were replaced in <b>HUG</b> Phase 3.2. It was originally intended that all the RAAF's Hornets would receive new centre fuselages, but the scope of this phase of the program was reduced after {{it was found that the}} number of man-hours needed to upgrade each aircraft was much greater than originally estimated. The ten aircraft were upgraded at an L-3 Communications facility in Canada, and all were returned to service by June 2010.|$|E
5|$|At {{their last}} session, Kaira admits to Jug {{that she has}} grown to like him.

The two share a <b>hug</b> before Kaira leaves.|$|E

5|$|The long-running <b>HUG</b> process {{complicated}} the RAAF's management of its fleet of F/A-18s. At any one time, {{the capabilities of}} individual aircraft differed considerably depending on their upgrades. Accordingly, the long-standing arrangement where aircraft were almost permanently assigned to each squadron {{was replaced by a}} system where they were pooled. Attempts to allocate Hornets with similar levels of modifications from the common pool to each squadron were not successful.|$|E
5|$|The {{main event}} was between The Undertaker and Mark Henry.

Henry put Undertaker in the bear <b>hug</b> but Undertaker broke the hold. In the end, Undertaker delivered a Last Ride to Henry from the top rope. Undertaker then pinned Henry to win the match.|$|E

In the final scene of the series, with the camera on Brody, the Hollywood Hills backdrop is pulled away, while the camera pans back to reveal that the entire scene was filmed on a backlot.

5|$|Immediately {{upon the}} {{conclusion}} of the sketch, writer Michael O'Donoghue knew it was an instant success. He had been watching the Saturday Night Live performance from beside the set, off-camera. He felt that Belushi had performed his role as Captain Kirk perfectly. As soon as Belushi left the set, O'Donoghue went over to him and gave the actor a congratulatory <b>hug.</b> On reflection, after the live performance, O'Donoghue stated that Belushi had performed a perfect parody of Shatner as Kirk. Belushi felt it was one of his most satisfying performances.|$|E

5|$|Little Busters! was {{the first}} Key title to receive {{coverage}} in an entire issue of Dengeki G's Festival!, a special edition version of Dengeki G's Magazine which is published in irregular intervals each year by ASCII Media Works; the issue in question was the ninth, published on June 30, 2007. Along with a full 80 pages of information on Little Busters!, the magazine came bundled with a double-sided <b>hug</b> pillowcase, a small cell phone cleaner which could also attach to a cell phone, and a B5 size jigsaw puzzle. ASCII Media Works published the third volume of another special edition version of Dengeki G's Magazine named Dengeki G's Festival! Deluxe on June 30, 2008 which had a focus on Little Busters! Ecstasy. Along with again containing about eighty pages of information pertaining to the visual novel, the magazine also comes bundled with an ergonomic mousepad, a jigsaw puzzle, and a deck of playing cards. The third volume of another magazine in the Festival! line, Dengeki G's Festival! Comic, was sold on July 26, 2008 with Rin and Dorj on the cover, and the magazine came bundled with a <b>hug</b> pillowcase, a notepad, and a B2 size poster.|$|E

Kane chokeslamed Henry {{towards the end of}} the contest and {{attempted}} to pin Henry. Chavo Guerrero and Kenny Dykstra interfered, however, and attacked Kane. Kane fought back and chokeslammed Dykstra, but Henry locked Kane in a bear <b>hug.</b> The referee stopped the contest after Kane kayfabe passed out.|$|E
5000|$|Online {{interactions}} {{rely heavily}} on vision and hearing, so a substantial need exists for mediated social touch. Of the forms of physical contact, <b>hugging</b> is particularly emotionally charged; it conveys warmth, love, and affiliation. Recently, researchers have made several attempts to create a <b>hugging</b> device providing some sense of physical co-presence over a distance. HaptiHug’s key feature is that it physically reproduces the human-hug pattern, generating pressure simultaneously on each user’s chest and back. The idea to realistically reproduce <b>hugging</b> is in integration of active-haptic device HaptiHug and pseudo-haptic touch simulated by <b>hugging</b> animation. Thus, high immersion into the physical contact of partners while <b>hugging</b> is achieved.|$|R

5|$|Phase {{three is}} broken into two {{separate}} parts, phase 3.1 of the <b>HUG</b> project {{will see the}} fleet undergo a structural refurbishment program {{with a number of}} aircraft undergoing the replacement of centre barrels and adjacent structural components. In addition, phase 3.2 started with an Aging Aircraft Audit (AAA), ongoing R3 Deeper Maintenance (DM) and minor projects such as Night Vision Capability (NVC) will also be undertaken to ensure that the fleet can continue to perform its air defence tasks through to the Planned Withdrawal Date.|$|E
5|$|Principal {{photography}} {{began on}} April 25, 2011, in Albuquerque, New Mexico, with the working title Group <b>Hug.</b> In June 2011, stuntman Jeremy Fitzgerald injured his head while attempting a stunt involving a 30-foot fall from a building after {{getting hit by}} an arrow. A Marvel spokesperson later told TMZ.com that despite the injury, Fitzgerald recovered and continued working on set. The following month, secondary filming took place about an hour outside Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania in the Butler area. A chase sequence was also shot in Worthington, Pennsylvania at Creekside Mushroom Farms, the world's largest single-site mushroom farm, which provided 150 miles of abandoned limestone tunnels 300 feet below the ground for filming.|$|E

The upgrade project has been set up to elongate the time the Hornet's can run until 2018. The project is being conducted in three phases. This project was established to upgrade the F/A-18 fleet to combine enrichments that will allow the aircraft to more effectively perform its air defence tasks. The project is being conducted in three main phases, phase one has already concluded and phases two and three are currently in production.|$|E
