5|$|Baseball as a Second Language: Explaining the Game Americans Use to Explain Everything Else (self-published as an {{experiment}} in open access in 2011) discusses the many ways baseball concepts and imagery have made their way <b>into</b> <b>American</b> English. It was inspired by Lewis' experiences explaining baseball to international students.|$|E
5|$|During the {{presidency}} of Richard Nixon, a US government investigation was initiated <b>into</b> <b>American</b> involvement in the assassinations. Nixon was a political foe of Kennedy, having narrowly lost {{to him in the}} 1960 Presidential election. Nixon ordered an investigation under E. Howard Hunt into the murders, convinced Kennedy must have secretly ordered the killings but the inquiry was unable to find any such secret order.|$|E

5|$|Feminist {{theory can}} also be seen at play in Stowe's book, with the novel as a {{critique}} of the patriarchal nature of slavery. For Stowe, blood relations rather than paternalistic relations between masters and slaves formed the basis of families. Moreover, Stowe viewed national solidarity as an extension of a person's family, thus feelings of nationality stemmed from possessing a shared race. Consequently, she advocated African colonization for freed slaves and not amalgamation <b>into</b> <b>American</b> society.|$|E
5|$|Pike {{had planned}} for the Pawnees to guide him to the Comanches. However, upon his arrival at the village, he was {{informed}} that the two tribes were at war. When Pike expressed his intention of continuing inland toward {{the headwaters of the}} Arkansas, Sharitarish urged him to turn back: he had prevented the Spanish from going further <b>into</b> <b>American</b> territory, and would likewise resist an American movement toward Spanish land.|$|E
5|$|The Hog Island sheep is not {{commonly}} used in modern agriculture, largely because of its endangered status and because more modern breeds have been bred for other characteristics, including maximum size and fleece yield. It is nevertheless considered important to preserve because of the insight it may give <b>into</b> <b>American</b> history and the traits it has that modern sheep might lack such as its toughness, foraging skill, efficient use of food, and easy lambing.|$|E

5|$|The Jersey Shore attacks {{immediately}} entered <b>into</b> <b>American</b> popular culture, where sharks became caricatures in editorial cartoons representing danger.

5|$|The early 20th {{century was}} {{the era of the}} Great Migration of blacks from the Southern United States to the Northeast, Midwest and West. Du Bois wrote an {{editorial}} supporting the Great Migration, because he felt it would help blacks escape Southern racism, find economic opportunities, and assimilate <b>into</b> <b>American</b> society.|$|E
5|$|After their {{extraordinary}} early successes, {{beginning with}} Oklahoma! in 1943, Rodgers and Hammerstein had written two musicals in the 1950s {{that did not}} do well and sought a new hit to revive their fortunes. Lee's novel focuses on a father, Wang Chi-yang, a wealthy refugee from China, who clings to traditional values in San Francisco's Chinatown. Rodgers and Hammerstein shifted {{the focus of the}} musical to his son, Wang Ta, who is torn between his Chinese roots and assimilation <b>into</b> <b>American</b> culture. The team hired Gene Kelly to make his debut as a stage director with the musical and scoured the country for a suitable Asian – or at least, plausibly Asian-looking – cast. The musical, much more light-hearted than Lee's novel, was profitable on Broadway and was followed by a national tour.|$|E

5|$|Armenians from Lebanon, {{where they}} had {{effectively}} established an active community, are more politicized, while Turkish Armenians are mostly connected with the Armenian Apostolic Church. About 1/3 of all Turkish Armenians in America are self-employed. A group of Armenian Americans from Istanbul founded the Organization of Istanbul Armenians (OIA) in 1976, which claimed over 1,000 members in Southern California as of 2011. Iranian Armenians are known for fast integration <b>into</b> <b>American</b> society; for example, only 31% of Armenian Americans born in Iran claim not to speak English well.|$|E
5|$|Crawford led about 500 {{volunteer}} militiamen, {{mostly from}} Pennsylvania, deep <b>into</b> <b>American</b> Indian territory, {{with the intention}} of surprising the Indians. The Indians and their British allies from Detroit had already learned of the expedition, however, and gathered a force to oppose the Americans. After a day of indecisive fighting near the Sandusky towns, the Americans found themselves surrounded and attempted to retreat. The retreat turned into a rout, but most of the Americans managed to find their way back to Pennsylvania. About 70 Americans were killed; Indian and British losses were minimal.|$|E
5|$|Dalhousie University is {{a member}} of the U15, a group that {{represents}} 15 of Canada’s most research-intensive universities. Out of 50 universities in Canada, Research Infosource ranked Dalhousie University the 16th most research-intensive for 2011, with a sponsored research income of $125.147 million, averaging $124,500 per faculty member. In 2003 and 2004, The Scientist placed Dalhousie among the top five places in the world outside the United States for postdoctoral work and conducting scientific research. In 2007 Dalhousie topped the list of The Scientist’s “Best Places to Work in Academia”. The annual list divides research and academic institutions <b>into</b> <b>American</b> and international lists; Dalhousie University ranked first in the international category. According to a survey conducted by The Scientist, Dalhousie was the best non-commercial scientific institute in which to work in Canada.|$|E

5|$|In 1910, {{the family}} moved to a {{neighborhood}} on Figueroa Street where they were the only Chinese on their block, living alongside mostly Mexican and Eastern European families. The two hills separating their new home from Chinatown helped Wong to assimilate <b>into</b> <b>American</b> culture. She attended public school with her older sister at first, but then moved to a Presbyterian Chinese school when the girls became the target of racial taunts from other students. Classes were taught in English, but Wong attended a Chinese language school afternoons and on Saturdays.|$|E
5|$|That evening Kennedy held a {{televised}} {{press conference on}} the possibility of a domestic Peace Corps-like program to reduce racism in white suburbs. On April 8 Kennedy and his wife went, at the request of Coretta Scott King, to Atlanta to attend Martin Luther King Jr.'s funeral. That evening he held a meeting with his aides over how {{to get the attention of}} middle-class whites weary of the civil rights movement in order to relieve the racial tension in the country. Kennedy returned to Indiana and on April 10 delivered his third and final speech inspired by King's death. Moving past his previous calls for compassion and an end to violence, he admonished whites to accept and welcome blacks <b>into</b> <b>American</b> society. Throughout the rest of the month, Kennedy toned down his campaign rhetoric and fixed on a theme of unity and reconciliation.|$|E
5|$|The first trade dollars {{were struck}} in 1873, and the {{majority}} of the coins were sent to China. Eventually, bullion producers began converting large amounts of silver into trade dollars, causing the coins to make their way <b>into</b> <b>American</b> commercial channels. This caused frustration among those to whom they were given in payment, as the coins were largely maligned and traded for less than one dollar each. In response to their wide distribution in American commerce, the coins were officially demonetized in 1876, but continued to circulate. Production of business strikes ended in 1878, though the mintage of proof coins officially continued until 1883. The trade dollar was re-monetized when the Coinage Act of 1965 was signed into law.|$|E

5|$|The {{works were}} first adapted for the American English market by Golden Books, {{a branch of}} the Western Publishing Company in the 1950s. The albums were {{translated}} from French <b>into</b> <b>American</b> English with some artwork panels blanked except for the speech balloons. This was done to remove content considered to be inappropriate for children, such as drunkenness and free mixing of races. The albums were not popular and only six were published in mixed order. The edited albums later had their blanked areas redrawn by Hergé to be more acceptable, and they currently appear this way in published editions around the world.|$|E
5|$|While {{blacks were}} {{excluded}} from the AG until the 1960s, the denomination's work among Spanish-speaking people has a long history, first sanctioned explicitly in 1918. Hispanic outreach became independent of the Foreign Missions Department in 1929 when the first Latin American District was established. By the end of World War II, the AG's Latin American constituency formed the largest Protestant presence among Hispanics in the United States. The AG also focused on major European immigrant populations, but as later generations assimilated <b>into</b> <b>American</b> culture, these separate European segments were absorbed into the regular geographic districts.|$|E
5|$|Southwest of {{the city}} of Rexburg, the Snake {{receives}} from the right the Henrys Fork, sometimes called the North Fork of the Snake River. The confluence with the Henrys Fork takes the river southwards through downtown Idaho Falls, rounding the Fort Hall Indian Reservation and <b>into</b> <b>American</b> Falls Reservoir, receiving the Portneuf River. The Portneuf River Valley is an overflow channel that in the last glacial period carried floodwaters from pluvial Lake Bonneville into the Snake River Plain, carving out many topographic features and significantly altering the Snake River landscape. The Snake River resumes its journey westwards, then enters the Snake River Canyon of Idaho, where it drops over Shoshone Falls, a waterfall that marks the historical upriver limit of migrating salmon, and passing under the Perrine Bridge. Close to Twin Falls, the Snake approaches the southernmost point in its entire course, after which it starts to flow generally northwest.|$|E
