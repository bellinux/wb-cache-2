[...] The site added, [...] "This past season was almost a trial run for a McDreamy-less Grey's Anatomy. When Derek left for Washington D.C. to pursue his research, Meredith stayed behind and focused on her own career. She didn't chase him. Her priority were her children and the Grey Sloan Memorial Hospital. Meredith showed that she would never put aside her own dreams and aspirations for a man, and I believe that this won't change after Derek's death." ...|$|E

2500|$|Legio Maria {{developed}} gradually {{and eventually}} separated from mainstream Roman Catholicism in 1963. What is now Legio Maria started from the Catholic lay movement {{as far back}} as 1938-1940. Central to its formation are the local Luo myths about a mystery woman, min Omolo Ka-Nyunja, who walked Luo land during these years. A number of Legio Maria faithfuls believe that this woman was responsible for the mythical stories such as Nyamgondho Kombare in Gwassi, Homa Bay County, and Simbi Nyaima in Karachuonyo, Homa Bay County. According to Tobias Oloo, a Legio Maria Deacon and researcher, [...] "every religion has mythical elements and the Legio Maria movement's development relied massively on the crystallization of local myths with their beliefs." [...] Apart from the myths that probably preceded Legio Maria, Deacon Oloo affirms that the Fátima Visitation of Virgin Mary was a key ingredient to the formation of Legio Maria. [...] "As legios, we recognize the three Fatima mysteries. However, the most important for us is the third mystery which predicted the appearance of Our Lord in the 1960s. Though this mystery is controversial because the Roman Catholic did not reveal it for generations and what they eventually revealed is still contested by many Christians, we <b>have</b> <b>faith</b> <b>that</b> through the third mystery Mary promised the coming of Simeo Ondetto." ...|$|E

Maybe he heard someone say that cursing God was the unforgivable sin or that fornication was the unforgivable sin. [...] Kierkegaard wrote out of concern for his father's anxiety and others like him who believe that God shuts his door against them. He asks, “How does a person get to know that he is the greatest sinner?” Kierkegaard started in Either/Or with two characters known only as A and B, both were in search of a self, and he worked himself up to The Concept of Anxiety where he remarked; [...] "If a person does not first make clear to himself the meaning of “self,” it is of no use to say of sin that it is selfishness."

40|$|Reprinted in Philosophy of Religion: An Anthology, Wadsworth 2015, 6 th edition, eds Michael Rea and Louis Pojman. What is propositional faith? At a first approximation, {{we might}} answer {{that it is}} the {{psychological}} attitude picked out by standard uses of the English locution “S <b>has</b> <b>faith</b> <b>that</b> p,” where p takes declarative sentences as instances, as in “He <b>has</b> <b>faith</b> <b>that</b> they’ll win”. Although correct, this answer is not nearly as informative as we might like. Many people say that there is a more informative answer. They say that, at the very least, propositional faith requires propositional belief. More precisely, they say <b>that</b> <b>faith</b> <b>that</b> p requires belief that p or that it must be partly constituted by belief that p. This view is common enough; call it the Common View. I have two main aims in this paper: (i) to exhibit the falsity of the Common View and the paucity of reasons for it, and (ii) to sketch a more accurate and comprehensive account of what propositional faith is...|$|R

[...] "It is possible that in this wide-ranging game that you began my president did not play a crucial role, but what you did was not important to my president, but it was to me and the citizens of our country. And I <b>have</b> <b>faith</b> <b>that</b> when you planned this game you took into consideration the consequences", the ambassador told Assange. Assange stated that the plan [...] "was not completely honest, but we did consider that the final result would have justified our actions. We weren't expecting this outcome. The result {{was caused by the}} United States' intervention. We can only regret what happened." [...] Later, in an interview with Democracy Now!, Assange explained the story of the grounding of Morales' plane, saying that after the United States cancelled Snowden's passport, WikiLeaks thought about other strategies to take him to Latin America, and they considered private presidential jets of those countries which offered support. The appointed jet was that of Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro, but Assange stated that [...] "our code language that we used deliberately swapped the presidential jet that we were considering for the Bolivian jet [...] and in some of our communications, we deliberately spoke about that on open lines to lawyers in the United States. And we didn’t think much more of it. [...] We didn’t think this was anything more than just distracting." [...] Eventually, the plan was not pursued and, under Assange's advice, Snowden sought asylum in Russia.|$|E
