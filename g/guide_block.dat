50|$|The D-DIA {{is based}} on the similar DIA, which is a cubic-anvil apparatus. The D-DIA is a type of multi-anvil {{deformation}} apparatus that uses 6 cubically arranged anvils to provide independent pressurization and deformation of the sample. Four anvils of the cubic arrangement are oriented in the horizontal opposing at 90°, and the remaining two anvils are oriented in the vertical within two <b>guide</b> <b>blocks.</b> The back side of each horizontal anvil comprises two faces of a virtual octahedron. By the symmetry imposed from the advancing <b>guide</b> <b>blocks</b> and anvils, all axes of the virtual octahedron are then strained equally and thus provide hydrostatic pressure to the sample.In order to create a deviatoric stress, oil is pumped using two differential rams behind the top and bottom anvils located within the <b>guide</b> <b>blocks</b> allowing them to advance independent of the other four. By advancing just one anvil pair, a deviatoric stress is created thus altering the previously cubic stress field to one that is tetragonal. The induced flow is approximately axially-symmetric with respect to the cylindrical sample). By advancing an anvil pair pressure would begin to increase on the sample as deformation progresses, but the D-DIA has the capability of bleeding off oil from the main ram (which engages the <b>guide</b> <b>blocks)</b> while advancing the differential pumps, in order to maintain a constant sample pressure during deformation.|$|R

40|$|Introduction: Pain {{control is}} the most {{important}} issue in emergency department management of patients with femoral bone fractures. The present study aimed to compare the procedural features of ultrasonography and nerve stimulator <b>guided</b> femoral nerve <b>block</b> in this regard. Method: In this randomized clinical trial, patients with proximal femoral fractures presenting to emergency department were randomly divided into two groups of ultrasonography or nerve stimulator <b>guided</b> femoral <b>block</b> and compared regarding success rate, procedural time, block time, and need for rescue doses of morphine sulfate, using SPSS 20. Results: 50 patients were randomly divided into two groups of 25 (60 % male). The mean age of studied patients was 35. 14 ± 12. 95 years (19 – 69). The two groups were similar regarding age (p= 0. 788), sex (p = 0. 564), and initial pain severity (p = 0. 513). In 2 cases of nerve stimulator <b>guided</b> <b>block,</b> loss of pinprick sensation did not happen within 30 minutes of injection (success rate: 92 %; p = 0. 490). Ultrasonography <b>guided</b> nerve <b>block</b> cases had significantly lower procedural time (8. 06 ± 1. 92 vs 13. 60 ± 4. 56 minutes; p < 0. 001) and lower need for rescue doses of opioid (2. 68 ± 0. 74 vs 5. 28 ± 1. 88 minutes; p < 0. 001). Conclusion: Ultrasonography and nerve stimulator <b>guided</b> femoral <b>block</b> had the same success rate and block duration. However, the ultrasonography guided group had lower procedure time and lower need for rescue doses of morphine sulfate. Therefore, ultrasonography <b>guided</b> femoral <b>block</b> could be considered as an available, safe, rapid, and efficient method for pain management of femoral fracture in emergency department.  </p...|$|R

Summary of Literature Review: Facet joint syndrome was introduced in 1976, by Mooney V. It {{was considered to be}} one of the major causes of low back pain. Materials and Methods: Between October 2009 to March 2011, 98 cases were selected from the outpatients who complained of chronic lower back pain for more than 3 months. The patients had no surgery history and did not complain of neuromuscular symptoms, and they had more than three times outpatient care at least and could be followed up for 1 year. The patients were divided into three groups; first was the ultrasound <b>guided</b> facet <b>block</b> group (27 cases), second was the Fluoroscopy <b>guided</b> facet <b>block</b> group (39 cases) and third was the conservative group (32 cases). The clinical results were analyzed using Kim’s criteria and the Visual Analog Scale score, ODI score, Physician’s global assessment (subjective), Patient’s global assessment (Objective). Results: The VAS score was improved from an average of 7. 75 ± 1. 5 to 4. 47 ± 2. 4 in the ultrasound <b>guided</b> facet <b>block</b> group, and from 7. 81 ± 1. 4 to 4. 39 ± 2. 6 in the Fluoroscopy <b>guided</b> facet <b>block</b> group, and from 7. 87 ± 1. 3 to 6. 24 ± 2. 1 in the conservative group.

40|$|Block {{matching}} algorithms (BMAs) {{are often}} employed for motion estimation (ME) in video coding. Most conventional BMAs treat the ME problem as an optimization problem and employ certain search schemes {{to find a}} solution. Except the time-consuming full search algorithms (FS), other fast algorithms such as the three step search (TSS), searching on a reduced search range, cannot guarantee optimal solutions, i. e., search is often trapped at local minima; the ME results are thus usually unsatisfactory. Few of them makes use of the information inherent in the images explicitly. We propose a new ME algorithm which can reduce the search range while guaranteeing global optimality in most cases. Microblock visual patterns are designed to extract edge information to <b>guide</b> <b>block</b> matching: searching is only carried out at places where the real match most likely happens; that is where similar edge features present. The proposed algorithm obtains a speed about 7 - 8 {{times as fast as}} that of FS with same search range. The prediction quality is very close to that of FS and much better than that of TSS. It can produce MPEG- 1 or MPEG- 2 compatible motion vectors, and can be extended to model-based ME. It is suitable for parallel implementation too.

40|$|Past {{claims of}} the {{suitability}} of the MA- 8 multianvil press as a deformation apparatus may have been overstated. On the basis of measurements of final octahedron size and of <b>guide</b> <b>block</b> displacement {{as a function of}} time, using the 10 / 5, 14 / 8, and 18 / 11 assemblies (octahedron edge length in mm/truncation edge length in mm) with MgO octahedra and pyrophyllite gasketing, it appears that at run conditions of interest to most researchers there is no appreciable time-dependent creep of gaskets and octahedra. All inelastic deformation occurs at rather low pressures: below about 10 GPa for the 10 / 5, 7 GPa for the 14 / 8, and 6 GPa for the 18 / 11 assemblies, with substantial uncertainties in these pressures. Above these limits all deformation of the pressure medium is elastic. Pressure stepping as a means of increasing the inelastic deformation rate of a sample is probably ineffective. Displacement measured at the guide blocks, previously believed to indicate deformation of the gaskets and octahedron, appears now to be unrelated to creep of these components. The calibrations have not been exhaustive and there is considerable scatter in some of the size measurements, so the above conclusions are not unequivocal. The calibrations do not exclude the possibility of deformation of a few tens of microns after the attainment of high pressure. Efforts to impose permanent shape change to samples at high pressure and temperature simply by relying on long run durations must be viewed with skepticism. There may be possibilities for deformation in the multianvil apparatus if materials of contrasting elastic modulus are used to differentially load a sample during pressure stepping...|$|E
40|$|Little {{is known}} {{regarding}} the final needle tip location when various intensities of nerve stimulation {{are used to}} <b>guide</b> <b>block</b> needle insertion. Therefore, in control and hyperglycemic dogs, the authors examined whether lower-intensity stimulation results in injection closer to the sciatic nerve than higher-threshold stimulation. During anesthesia, the sciatic nerve was approached with an insulated nerve block needle emitting either 1 mA (high-current group, n = 9) or 0. 5 mA (low-current group, n = 9 in control dogs and n = 6 in hyperglycemic dogs). After positioning to obtain a distal motor response, the lowest current producing a response was identified, and ink (0. 5 ml) was injected. Frozen sections of the tissue revealed whether the ink was {{in contact with the}} epineurium of the nerve, distant to it, or within it. In control dogs, the patterns of distribution using high-threshold (final current 0. 99 +/- 0. 03 mA, mean +/- SD) and low-threshold (final current 0. 33 +/- 0. 08 mA) stimulation equally showed ink that was in contact with the epineurium or distant to it. One needle placement in the high-threshold group resulted in intraneural injection. In hyperglycemic dogs, all needle insertions used a low-threshold technique (n = 6, final threshold 0. 35 +/- 0. 08 mA), and all resulted in intraneural injections. In normal dogs, current stimulation levels in the range of 0. 33 - 1. 0 mA result in needle placement comparably close to the sciatic nerve but do not correlate with distance from the target nerve. In this experimental design, low-threshold electrical stimulation does not offer satisfactory protection against intraneural injection in the presence of hyperglycemi...|$|E

40|$|University of Minnesota Ph. D. dissertation. December 2016. Major: Chemical Engineering. Advisor: Frank Bates. 1 {{computer}} file (PDF); xiii, 187 pages. Block copolymers are macromolecules formed by covalently joining {{two or more}} distinct polymer blocks that may be thermodynamically incompatible. The incompatibility drives segregation of the individual blocks on the molecular scale (5 – 100 nm), producing extraordinarily varied and complex morphologies. This thesis describes the synthesis and phase behavior characterization of tetrablock terpolymers composed of poly(styrene) (S), poly(isoprene) (I), and poly(ethylene oxide) (O) {{with an emphasis on}} ABAC-type polymers. Motivated by SCFT calculations, investigation into the phase behavior of sphere-forming SIS′O tetrablocks led to the identification of multiple ordered structures upon varying the symmetry parameter τ = NS/(NS + NS′), where N is the block degree of polymerization. Complementary data from dynamic mechanical spectroscopy, small angle X-ray scattering, and transmission electron microscopy yielded evidence for nine different spherical phases: FCC, HCP, BCC, rhombohedral (tentative), liquid-like packing, dodecagonal quasicrystal, and Frank–Kasper σ and A 15, and simple hexagonal packing (HEXS). Close to the order-disorder transition, equilibrium morphologies are formed due to facile chain exchange between micelles. Transition to non-equilibrium behavior occurred several tens of degrees below the order-disorder transition where increased segregation strength between the O core and SIS′ corona arrests chain exchange between domains. Structure and thermodynamic stability of the HEXS phase were examined in greater detail and the phase was found to be especially stable in low-τ samples. Switching the block sequencing from SISO to ISIO led to an extinguishment in complex behavior as only BCC and hexagonally packed cylinders (HEXC) were identified as ordered phases. The decrease in morphological complexity was attributed to the formation of frustrated interfaces as the ISIO molecular architecture mandates contact between the most thermodynamically incompatible I and O blocks. Additionally, synthetic strategies capable of producing ABCA′-type tetrablocks with asymmetrically sized corona chains were developed. These results expand the monomer toolkit capable of producing new types of block polymers and provide a deeper glimpse into the fundamental principles that <b>guide</b> <b>block</b> polymer phase behavior...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: The {{practice}} of regional anaesthesia will be probably forever {{changed by the}} introduction of ultra-sonography into everyday clinical practice. The ability to now visualise directly the spread of local anaesthetic solution and its relationship with the nerve allows for immediate adjustments to needle position and/or local anaesthetic volume and spread resulting theoratically in improved block performance through faster onset, reduced local anaesthetic volumes and higher success rates. However, whether US <b>guided</b> <b>blocks</b> will ever replace neurostimulation techniques is debatable espe-cially when regional anaesthesia is performed by special-ists in the field. Key words: Ultrasound guidance; peripheral nerve blocks; epidural blocks. In recent years, the {{practice of}} regional anaes-thesia has been forever changed {{by the introduction of}} ultrasonography into everyday practice. The abi-lity of ultrasound (US) to visualise nerves as well as structures (vessels, pleura) to be avoided, has resul-ted in increased confidence for anaesthesiologists performing regional anaesthetic techniques. US <b>guided</b> nerve <b>blocks</b> provide real-time imaging of needle position and facilitate nerve location even when anatomical variations from traditional land-marks are present. The techniques traditionally used for regional anesthesia procedure guidance inclu-ded either subjective perceptions of arterial pulses or fascial “pops ” or more objectives aims as trans arterial approaches or nerve stimulation. The ability to now visualise directly the spread of local anaes-thetic solution and its relationship with the nerve allows for immediate adjustments to needle posi-tion and/or local anaesthetic volume and spread resulting theoratically in improved block perfor-mance through faster onset, reduced local anaesthe-tic volumes and higher success rates (1, 2, 3). The recent literature reflects the exponential evolution of ultrasound <b>guided</b> regional <b>blocks</b> from descrip-tive studies demonstrating its feasability to prospec-tive RCT comparing ultrasounds to other classical techniques of guidance. Regional anaesthetic tech-niques such as the supra-clavicular block, or sub-gluteal sciatic nerve approach that were considered high risk or challenging, may now be undertaken with the knowledge that needle position relative to other structures is known...|$|R
