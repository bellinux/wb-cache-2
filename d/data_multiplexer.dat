40|$|Historically, {{instrumentation}} analog tape based data recorders did {{not have}} a built- in <b>data</b> <b>multiplexer,</b> {{due to the nature of}} multiple track capability. Digital tape based recorders have been available with and without built- in data multiplexers. Recent solid-state data recorders, and in particular, the high capacity and the high data rate systems, have been assumed to include the solid-state media and multiplexer electronics within a single unit. This paper challenges the assumption of a single multiplexer/solid-state unit when a large amount of data and large number of input sources are to be recorded. This paper describes a distributed <b>data</b> <b>multiplexer</b> and recording system, acquiring data from high-speed avionics data busses (Optical Fibre Channel and 1394 B), PCM, wideband analog, video, and others.

40|$|Abstract — When a {{video is}} {{streamed}} over internet, {{different types of}} data e. g., moving images, audio, control signals etc are sent over the channel multiplexed into individual sub channels. Different bit rates lead to poor utilization of channel capacity. A novel technique to convert WAVE speech signals into BITMAP images and compress them using JPEG module is proposed here. This not only maximally utilizes the channel capacity by using the same channel for image and speech signals, it also minimizes computational resources and time by enabling the same processing tools {{to be used for}} both type of signals. Also, due to better compression rate of JPEG over MP 3, it facilitates faster transfer of extensive volumes of <b>data.</b> <b>Multiplexers</b> used to segregate the audio and image parts of videos can also be skipped in such a communication system. Results are shown to further prove that the compression ratio is better for the proposed technique as compared to speech signals compressed by conventional techniques.

40|$|Graduation date: 1969 An {{instruction}} set and programming examples are described for a Distributed Logic Memory computer organization. The computer {{is designed to}} take advantage of the economies of very large-scale circuit integration. In addition, the computer can grow in an orderly way. As it grows there is increased parallelism possible so that the amount of spare real time in a control application is not greatly reduced. Finally, such an organization should permit stored program control in relatively small applications where up to now control by a conventionally organized computer has been prohibitively expensive. The computer consists of a linear array of identical, small, sequential machines, or cells. The structure is similar to that of the Distributed Logic Memory originally proposed by C. Y. Lee. It was demonstrated by J. N. Sturman that the addition of sequential logic to each cell permits the memory to become a self-contained computing system. It is the purpose of this thesis to produce an application-oriented process control computer design based on the concepts of Lee and Sturman. It was found necessary to increase the length of the memory word in each cell. The ability to store instructions and data in cells is retained. Increasing the memory word length of each cell permits an expanded instruction repertoire. The low-ordered three bits of every memory word are arranged to identify a cell as one of eight possible types. A program instruction includes modifier bits which specify the types of cells on which the instruction is to operate. This facility enhances the efficiency of programs. The logic design of the cell is complete enough to permit estimating gate count per cell. An analysis of the sensitivity of gate count to changes in the {{instruction set}} is included. A program simulation of the Distributed Logic Memory computer assisted in its development and later permitted verification of programs written for the computer.

Currently our developed converter DMD (<b>Data</b> <b>Multiplexer</b> Demultiplexer) supports GraphML, UCINET, and Pajek formats besides our own data formats which are used for real-time analysis of CSCL (Computer Supported Collaborative Learning) activities. In the case of communication data our converters utilize conversation graphs reflecting aspects of speech act and conversational theory to produce directed graphs in the cases where one-mode person networks are desired.

40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages 73 - 75) This {{thesis is}} concerned with the application of microprogramming to the design and development of a data communications-oriented digital computer. The design philosophy is discussed, followed by a discussion of the computer architecture. Additional topics covered are a review of computer and micro programming history, and a typical system application for the computer that was designed and implemented for this thesis project. The modern digital computer has gone through many stages of development, evolving from a laboratory curiosity to an indispensable working tool in {{a relatively short period of}} time. The major stages of development can be defined by the active logic elements: vacuum tubes, discrete transistors, and integrated circuits. Along with these advances in hardware, significant changes have occurred in programming. The corresponding advances in software may be denoted as: machine languages and assemblers, high- level languages (example, FORTRAN) and monitors, and operating systems and multiprogramming. A recent trend in computer developments has been to make the computer control section programmable. Although the basic techniques of microprogramming have been known since the early 1950 ???s, they did not find widespread usage until the late 1960 ???s. The computer designed for this thesis project was designated the ADS- 900. It is micro programmable and uses a bus-oriented, multiple general register structure. A 256 x 48 bit, read only memory is used to control operations for executing an IBM System 360 / 370 - compatible instruction set. A two???s complement, 16 -bit, data word is used. A powerful flexible input/output structure is included that allows installation of up to eight direct memory access channels and multiple, direct program channel controlled device s. Each direct memory access channel has 16 sub channels, each capable of handling multiple devices. The ADS - 900 computer was successfully implemented and was used to control a data communications system.

40|$|This paper {{introduces}} a distributed data mining approach suited to grid computing environments {{based on a}} supervised learning classifier system. Different methods of merging data mining models generated at different distributed sites are explored. Centralized Data Mining (CDM) is a conventional method of data mining in distributed data. In CDM, data that is stored in distributed locations have to be collected and stored in a central repository before executing the data mining algorithm. CDM method is reliable; however it is expensive (computational, communicational and implementation costs are high). Alternatively, Distributed Data Mining (DDM) approach is economical but it has limitations in combining local models. In DDM, the data mining algorithm has to be executed at {{each one of the}} sites to induce a local model. Those induced local models are collected and combined to form a global data mining model. In this work six different tactics are used for constructing the global model in DDM: Generalized Classifier Method (GCM); Specific Classifier Method (SCM); Weighed Classifier Method (WCM); Majority Voting Method (MVM); Model Sampling Method (MSM); and Centralized Training Method (CTM). Preliminary experimental tests were conducted with two synthetic <b>data</b> sets (eleven <b>multiplexer</b> and monks 3) and a real world data set (intensive care medicine).

40|$|Feeding {{behavior}} and time spent eating contains valuable {{information that can}} be used for managing livestock, identifying sick animals, and determining genetic differences within a herd. Individual animal feeding behavior, in a commercial-sized pen, was recorded using radio-frequency identification (RFID) technology and a series of <b>multiplexers.</b> <b>Data</b> were collected on 960 pigs (mixed barrows, 406 and gilts, 600) over 4 grow-out periods. The animals entered the facility at 24. 6 ± 5. 4 kg (mean ± standard deviation) at approximately 65 days of age and exited the facility at 101. 4 ± 13. 8 kg (between 116 and 133 days later). Time spent at the feeder was analyzed for the effects of days on feed, sex, weight gain, and health effects. The amount of time spent at the feeder averaged 68. 8 min day‒ 1 pig‒ 1 over the grow-out period, and increased from the day the pigs enter the facility (24. 0 ± 1. 6 min day‒ 1 pig‒ 1; mean ± standard error) until plateauing at approximately 40 days later (76. 7 ± 2. 4 min day‒ 1 pig‒ 1; age ~ 105 days).

40|$|A multiplexer/demultiplexer {{system has}} been {{developed}} to enable the transmission, over a single channel, of four data streams generated {{by a variety of}} sources at different (including variable) bit rates. In the original intended application, replicas of this multiplexer/demultiplexer system would be incorporated into the spacecraft-to-ground communication systems of the space shuttles. The multiplexer of each system would be installed in the spacecraft, where it would acquire and process data from such sources as commercial digital camcorders, video tape recorders, and the spacecraft telemetry system. The demultiplexer of each system would be installed in a ground station. Purely terrestrial systems of similar design could be attractive for use in situations in which there are requirements to transmit multiple streams of high-quality video data and possibly other data over single channels. The figure is a block diagram of the multiplexer as configured to process data received via three fiber-optic channels like those of the International Space Station and one electrical-cable channel that conforms to the Institute of Electrical and Electronic Engineers (IEEE) 1394 standard. (This standard consists of specifications of a high-speed serial data interface, the physical layer of which includes a cable known in the art as "FireWire. " An IEEE 1394 interface can also transfer power between the components to which it is connected.) The fiber-optic channels carry packet and/or bit-stream signals that conform to the standards of the Consultative Committee for Space Data Systems (CCSDS). The IEEE 1394 interface accepts an isochronous signal like that from a digital camcorder or a video tape recorder. The processing of the four input data streams to combine them into one output stream is governed by a statistical multiplexing algorithm that features a flow-control capability and makes it possible to utilize the transmission channel with nearly 100 -percent efficiency. This algorithm allocates the available bandwidth of the transmission channel to the data streams according to a combination of data rates and preassigned priorities. Incoming data streams that demand too much bandwidth are blocked. Bandwidth not needed for a transmission of a given data stream is allocated to other streams as available. Priority is given to the IEEE 1394 stream. In addition to the four incoming <b>data</b> streams, the <b>multiplexer</b> transmits <b>data</b> on the status of the system. An operator can monitor and control the multiplexer via displays and controls on the multiplexer housing.
