50|$|Corbet Kynaston left debts {{amounting to}} between £70,000 & £80,000; suits were instituted by his creditors, and an Act of Parliament {{had to be}} {{obtained}} for selling his estates. An arrangement was entered into, by a deed dated December 20, 1748. Anna Maria Leighton and her husband Sir Charlton Leighton were to have the manor, house, and lands of Shelvock, and the furniture there, along with several <b>freehold</b> <b>tenements.</b> In 1757, Sir Charlton let Shelvock for his own life to Richard Madocks, yeoman, and as Madocks is described in the deed as of Shelvock, he was apparently already tenant of it before this time. In 1766, Sir Charlton gave up the property of Shelvock Manor and its grounds, as well as another farm, to his son Charlton Leighton.|$|R

His inscribed mural monument survives in Bovey Tracey Church. His origins are revealed by the will of his grandfather George Hunt (d.1768) of Northwick, signed 31 October 1766. He leaves all his <b>freehold</b> lands and <b>tenements</b> in the parishes of North Bovey and Throwleigh, immediately upon his own decease, to [...] "my grandson George Luxton, son of Thomas Luxton and Elizabeth his wife, my daughter, of Winkleigh, Esq.," [...] with remainders to [...] " [...] my granddaughter Elizabeth Luxton, sister of the said G. L.," [...] and [...] "my granddaughter Mary Luxton, younger sister of the said G. L." [...] He leaves Tarr Mill in S. T., immediately after his decease, to [...] "my grandson George Hunt Clapp, son of Robert Clapp and Mary his wife, my youngest daughter, of Ottery St. Mary, gent.," [...] with remainders to [...] " [...] my grandson Francis Hunt Clapp," [...] and others.|$|R
40|$|This study aims to put {{the medieval}} {{feoffment}} to uses into its broad historical context, portraying its origin as {{an outgrowth of the}} landholding "nobility's" desire to evade the burdens of post-Conquest Norman feudalism. Those burdens were, so far as they related to <b>freehold</b> lands and <b>tenements,</b> chiefly, the rule against devises, the prohibition (until 1290) of alienation by substitution, the incidents of tenure, and the prohibition of gifts of freehold into mortmain (usually to ecclesiastical institutions). The Church's involvement with the feoffment to uses occurred in various ways: Its theologians provided a Christianized epieikeia which the Chancellor appropriated to aid disappointed cestuis - who generally had no common-law rights in the freehold realty held to their use; its canonists enunciated theories of third party enjoyment-without- ownership of freehold realty especially suited {{to the needs of the}} Franciscan Friars Minor, who were also cestuis of feoffments to uses; it registered and had jurisdiction over administration of probate of wills, which often contained instructions to feoffees. There is, indeed, evidence that ecclesiastical courts were the first to enforce feoffees' obligations, and therefore to protect cestuis, relinquishing this jurisdiction as the Chancellors of England (nearly all of whom were high-ranking ecclesiastics), began to order specific performance of the "use's" purposes. This study. concludes, therefore, that ecclesiastical contributions to the development and enforcement of the feoffment to uses up to 1535 (the year of the Statute of Uses), were pervasive, if, from the standpoint of the institutional Church, largely indirect, and occurred on both theoretical and administrative planes...|$|R
