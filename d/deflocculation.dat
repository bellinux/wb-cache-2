50|$|The {{characteristics}} {{capable of}} supporting Type 1 pits were determined empirically by Lucey after examining the compositions of waters {{in which the}} pitting behaviour was known. They should be cold, less than 30°C, hard or moderately hard, 170 to 300 mg/l carbonate hardness, and organically pure. Organically pure waters usually originate from deep wells, or boreholes. Surface waters from rivers or lakes contain naturally occurring organic compounds that inhibit the formation of Type 1 pits, unless a <b>deflocculation</b> treatment {{has been carried out}} that removes organic material. Type 1 pitting is relatively uncommon in North America and this may be a result of the lower population density allowing a significant proportion of the potable water to be obtained from surface derived sources. In addition to being cold hard and organically pure, the water needs a specific chemistry. The effect of the water chemistry can be empirically determined though use of the Pitting Propensity Rating (PPR) a number that takes into account the sulfate, chloride, nitrate and sodium ion concentrations of the water as well as its acidity or pH.

40|$|The {{influence}} of the microbial activity {{on the strength of}} activated sludge flocs was studied in short term experiments (0 - 3 h). Increased floc strength was generally obtained when the aerobic microbial activity was stimulated by adding substrate. <b>Deflocculation</b> was observed when the aerobic microbial activity was inhibited by (i) anaerobic conditions, (ii) addition of the metabolic inhibitors azide and chloramphenicol and (iii) reduction of the temperature to 4 °C. Furthermore, addition of nitrate as electron acceptor under anaerobic conditions partly prevented <b>deflocculation</b> from taking place. These results strongly suggested that microorganisms using oxygen and/or nitrate as electron acceptors were important for maintaining the floc strength. The increase in turbidity under <b>deflocculation</b> was well correlated with the number of bacteria and concentration of protein, humic substances and carbohydrates in the supernatant. However, only approximately 1 - 2 % of the total amount of sludge deflocculated, so the <b>deflocculation</b> could be understood as an erosion of small particles from the larger flocs. The extent of <b>deflocculation</b> under anaerobic conditions could be enhanced by stimulation of the anaerobic biological activity. When anaerobic conditions prevailed, a microbial iron reduction immediately started with iron reduction rates of 4 - 150 mmol/gVS×h. Subsequently, a decrease in floc strength was observed which could also be observed when the iron-reducing bacterium Shewanella alga BrY was added to the activated sludge. Furthermore, the importance of Fe(III) for the floc strength was illustrated by removal of Fe(III) from the sludge matrix by adding sulphide, which resulted in strong <b>deflocculation.</b> Thus, the <b>deflocculation</b> observed could be either directly due to lack of aerobic microbial activity or indirectly due to change in the local physico-chemical conditions mediated by anaerobic microbial activity...|$|E

40|$|In a {{previous}} paper {{we have shown}} the added value of using LDS to monitor flocculation. It can supply, simultaneously, information on flocs size and structure and enlighten flocculation kinetics and mechanisms. In this paper, LDS is applied to study <b>deflocculation</b> and reflocculation processes of precipitated calcium carbonate (PCC) induced by cationic polyacrylamides, when different types of shear forces are applied. LDS can detect the influence of polymer characteristics and concentration {{as well as of}} the type of shearing, on flocs resistance and reflocculation degree, which depend on flocs structure and on the type of bonds between particles. As expected, flocs formed by bridging mechanism reflocculate with difficulty while flocs formed by patching reflocculate to a higher degree. Flocs resulting from reflocculation are more compact than the original ones, as assessed by the mass fractal dimension. Reflocculation is also lower when the flocs are submitted to superficial shearing than when they are submitted to sonication. Shearing induced by sonication is sufficient to break down the flocs in many fragments while the increase of pump speed only detaches particles by erosion, at the flocs surface, where bonds are weaker. Results prove that LDS is useful to monitor <b>deflocculation</b> and reflocculation processes and to predict floc resistance under different conditions. Moreover, the whole study demonstrates the benefit of using LDS for a complete evaluation of flocculants performance in the different stages of flocculation: aggregation, stabilization, <b>deflocculation</b> and reflocculation.

40|$|The {{quality of}} the {{effluent}} from activated sludge treatment plants is highly dependent on {{the efficiency of the}} solid-liquid separation process. The aim of this thesis was to study (i) the effects of dissolved oxygen (DO) concentration on effluent turbidity and flocculation, {{as well as on the}} settling properties of activated sludge, for both short term and long term scales, and (ii) the influence of aerobic microbial activity on the stability of activated sludge flocs. Relatively short periods of oxygen limitation (a few hours) caused increased turbidities of the effluent from both a pilot plant and a full scale plant. In addition, the adsorption of colloidal material onto the sludge flocs decreased under anaerobic conditions. The variations in activated sludge floc structure, size and size distribution were studied for DO concentrations of 0. 5 to 5 mg/l, and sludge ages of 1. 25 to 5 days, in pilot scale, completely mixed reactors. There was a trend towards larger flocs at higher DO concentrations. The size distribution by volume of flocs within the range of 10 - 1100 µm fitted well to log-normal distribution functions, while the size distribution by number of the small flocs (1 - 100 µm) in the supernatant after settling fitted best to power functions. Lower DO concentrations produced sludge with poorer settling properties and higher turbidities of the effluent than higher DO concentrations. Activated sludge deflocculated when it was subjected to anaerobic conditions and shear. The extent of <b>deflocculation</b> varied with the length of the anaerobic period. Activated sludge of a low sludge age deflocculated more than older sludge. To restore the deflocculated sludge, oxygen was added; thereafter, in less than an hour, most of the deflocculated matter was reflocculated. However, part of the deflocculated sludge did not reflocculate. The deflocculated material was composed mainly of bacteria and extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) attached to cells or floc fragments. Particles deflocculated under anaerobic conditions included more bacteria and protein than there were the composition of the total sludge.

Furthermore, it was found that between the first salt concentration (5 g L- 1) and 20 g L- 1 aggregates suffered a strong <b>deflocculation</b> phenomenon, leading to a heavy loss of aggregated biomass.

We show that our general model contains a lot of models that were previously considered in the literature. Assuming that floccula-tion and <b>deflocculation</b> dynamics are fast compared to the growth of the species, we construct a reduced chemostat-like model in which both the growth functions and the apparent dilution rate depend on the density of the species. We also show that such a model involving monotonic growth rates may exhibit bi-stability, while it may occur in the classical chemostat model, but when the growth rate is non monotonic...|$|E
