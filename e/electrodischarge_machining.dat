Owing to the outstanding advantages of pulse electrochemical machining, electrodischarge machining–pulse electrochemical machining combined technique is provided to improve the overall quality of electrodischarge machining-drilled holes. The influence of pulse electrochemical machining processing parameters {{on the surface}} roughness and the influence of the electrodischarge machining–pulse electrochemical machining method on the surface quality and accuracy of holes have been studied experimentally. The results indicate that the pulse electrochemical machining processing time for complete removal of the recast layer decreases with the increase in the pulse electrochemical machining current. The low pulse electrochemical machining current results in uneven dissolution of the recast layer, while the higher pulse electrochemical machining current induces relatively homogeneous dissolution. The surface roughness is reduced from 4. 277 to 0. 299 [*]µm, and the hole taper induced by top-down <b>electrodischarge</b> <b>machining</b> process was reduced from 1. 04 ° to 0. 17 ° after pulse electrochemical machining.

The proposed concurrent-engineering or mechatronic approach to the design of hybrid microsystems is illustrated by three case studies.

40|$|Purpose: This work {{is focused}} on {{determination}} of effects of grinding conditions on effectiveness of abrasive electrodischarge grinding (AEDG) process applied for removal of machining allowance and forming of surface geometrical texture (SGT). These results were compared with one obtained for conventional grinding.

40|$|The {{high-level}} {{goal of this}} multi-year {{effort was}} to facilitate the Advanced Combustion Engine goal of 20 % improvement (compared to 2009 baseline) of commercial engine efficiency by 2015. A sub-goal {{is to increase the}} reliability of diesel fuel injectors by investigating modelbased scenarios that cannot be achieved by empirical, trial and error methodologies alone. During this three-year project, ORNL developed the methodology to evaluate origins and to record the initiation and propagation of fatigue cracks emanating from holes that were <b>electrodischarge</b> <b>machined</b> (EDM), the method used to form spray holes in fuel injector tips. Both x-ray and neutron-based methods for measuring residual stress at four different research facilities were evaluated to determine which, if any, was most applicable to the fuel injector tip geometry. Owing to the shape and small volumes of material involved in the sack area, residual stress data could only be obtained in the walls of the nozzle a few millimeters back from the tip, and there was a hint of only a small compressive stress. This result was consistent with prior studies by Caterpillar. Residual stress studies were suspended after the second year, reserving the possibility of pursuing this in the future, if and when methodology suitable for injector sacks becomes available. The smooth specimen fatigue behavior of current fuel injector steel materials was evaluated and displayed a dual mode initiation behavior. At high stresses, cracks started at machining flaws in the surface; however, below a critical threshold stress of approximately 800 MPa, cracks initiated in the bulk microstructure, below the surface. This suggests that for the next generation for high-pressure fuel injector nozzles, it becomes increasingly important to control the machining and finishing processes, especially if the stress in the tip approaches or exceeds that threshold level. Fatigue tests were also conducted using EDM notches in the gage sections. Compared to the smooth specimens, EDM notching led to a severe reduction in total fatigue life. A reduction in fatigue life of nearly four orders of magnitude can occur at an EDM notch the approximate size of fuel injector spray holes. Consequently, the initiation and propagation behavior of cracks from small spray holes is relevant for generation of design quality data for the next generation diesel fuel injection devices. This is especially true since the current design methodologies usually rely on the less conservative smooth specimen fatigue testing results, and since different materials can have varying levels of notch fatigue resistance...|$|R

40|$|A rough {{hydrophobic}} surface when immersed in water {{can result in}} a ``Cassie'' state of wetting in which the water is in contact with both the solid surface and the entrapped air. The sustainability of the entrapped air on such surfaces is important for underwater applications such as reduction of flow resistance in microchannels and drag reduction of submerged bodies such as hydrofoils. We utilize an optical technique based oil total internal reflection of light at the water-air interface to quantify the spatial distribution of trapped air oil such a surface and its variation with immersion time. With this technique, we evaluate the sustainability of the Cassie state on {{hydrophobic surface}}s with four different kinds of textures. The textures studied are regular arrays of pillars, ridges, and holes that were created in silicon by a wet etching technique, and also a texture of random craters that was obtained through <b>electrodischarge</b> <b>machining</b> of aluminum. These surfaces were rendered hydrophobic with a self-assembled layer Of fluorooctyl trichlorosilane. Depending on the texture, {{the size and shape of}} the trapped air pockets were found to vary. However, irrespective of the texture, both the size and the number of air pockets were found to decrease with time gradually and eventually disappear, suggesting that the sustainability of the ``Cassie'' state is finite for all the microstructures Studied. This is possibly due to diffusion of air from the trapped air pockets into the water. The time scale for disappearance of air pockets was found to depend on the kind of microstructure and the hydrostatic pressure at the water-air interface. For the surface with a regular array of pillars, the air pockets were found to be in the form of a thin layer perched on top of the pillars with a large lateral extent compared to the spacing between pillars. For other surfaces studied, the air pockets are smaller and are of the same order as the characteristic length scale of the texture. Measurements for the surface with holes indicate that the time for air-pocket disappearance reduces as the hydrostatic pressure is increased...|$|E

The MRRincreases by either enhancing electrical discharge density or rising sparking frequency. Low TWRs can essentially be established by a combination of low current levels with prolonged pulse on-times or longer pulse on-times with smaller duty cycles. Less rough surfaces are achievable via a blend of either low current intensity with shorter pulse on-time or low current level with higher gap voltage. Finally, a multi-objective optimization technique based on the use of desirability function (DF) concept was then applied to the response equations tosimultaneously find optimal combinations of input parameters capable of producing the highest possible amount of MRR and lowest amounts of TWR and Ra within the considered input process domain. The obtained predicted optimal results were then interpreted and verified experimentally to compute confirmation errors. Thevalues of relative validation errors, all being found to be quite satisfactory (about 11 % at the worst case), proves the efficacy and reliability of suggested approach...|$|E
40|$|This study {{presents}} {{two techniques}} of structuration of type UV-LIGA (Lithographie, Galvanisierung und Abformung) {{based on the}} use of two thick photoresists which are a dry film resist called Riston® from DuPont and the new SU- 8 negative-working resist from IBM. The relating processes to the structuration of these photoresists and some applications are presented too. The minimal resolution of the Riston® films {{has been found to be}} 30 µm for lines and trenches, and 40 µm for isolated holes in a 50 µm-thick film. A technique for the structuration of multilevel superimposed cavities has been set up. The verticality of the sidewalls (85. 5 °deg. to 87. 5 °deg) has been measured on film thicknesses between 25 and 100 µm. The SU- 8 process has been studied and is presented. Some optical and mechanical properties have been analysed. We have determined a coefficient of light attenuation of 5. 18 [db/mm] at 365 nm, a coefficient of thermal expansion of 52 [ppm/°C] and a biaxial modulus of 5. 18 GPa. The verticality of the walls depends on the exposure energy and has been found to be higher than 89 °deg. Layers from 750 nm to 2 mm can be exposed in one time, which seems to be the state-of-the art for a UV-photoresist to our knowledge. A specific process for the electroforming in multi-level superimposed cavities has been developed. With an adequate dosage of a leveling agent (coumarin) in the electrolytic Watt bath of nickel, a change in the growth rate of the high and the low level of the mold has been demonstrated. This rate is harmonised to obtain a flat deposition on the top surface of the formed structure. The UV-LIGA techniques developed in this thesis have found applications in the field of the-micromechanics. A flexible gearwheel, whose teeth are bound to the center via three integrated spring, and a multilevel gear system are the main realizations obtained by electroforming. These two structures have been used in a mechanism with a special watch mechanism and in a microreducer based on an electrostatic rotary micromotor. We have experimented with success the plastic injection of a gear system having 1. 4 mm in height and 3 mm in diameter. Its mold has been electroformed on a master in SU- 8. Theses microparts have demonstrated their functionality and have been mounted in commercialy-available-low-cost watches. All the process step of the LIGA technique have been established. The main advantages of this fabrication method are a better control of the tolerances and an improvement of the rugosity (against the wire <b>electrodischarge</b> <b>machining</b> technology). This technique is also cheaper and easier to start than X-LIGA...|$|E
