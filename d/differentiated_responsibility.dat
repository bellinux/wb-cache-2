[...] Moreover the regressive impact of shifting part of the abatement burden southward conflicts with the UNFCCC principle of common but <b>differentiated</b> <b>responsibility</b> and respective capabilities, which explicitly acknowledges that developing countries have less ability to shoulder climate protection measures.|$|E
5000|$|Another key {{difference}} between the Paris Agreement and the Kyoto Protocol is their scopes. While the Kyoto Protocol differentiated between Annex-1 and non-Annex-1 countries, this bifurcation is blurred in the Paris Agreement, as all parties {{will be required to}} submit emissions reductions plans. While the Paris Agreement still emphasizes the principle of [...] "Common but <b>Differentiated</b> <b>Responsibility</b> and Respective Capabilities"—the acknowledgement that different nations have different capacities and duties to climate action—it does not provide a specific division between developed and developing nations.|$|E
50|$|In Neo-Calvinism, sphere {{sovereignty}} (Dutch: souvereiniteit in eigen kring), {{also known}} as <b>differentiated</b> <b>responsibility,</b> is the concept that each sphere (or sector) of life has its own distinct responsibilities and authority or competence, and stands equal to other spheres of life. Sphere sovereignty involves {{the idea of an}} all encompassing created order, designed and governed by God. This created order includes societal communities (such as those for purposes of education, worship, civil justice, agriculture, economy and labor, marriage and family, artistic expression, etc.), their historical development, and their abiding norms. The principle of sphere sovereignty seeks to affirm and respect creational boundaries, and historical differentiation.|$|E
50|$|In {{view of the}} {{different}} contributions to global environmental degradation, States have common but <b>differentiated</b> <b>responsibilities.</b> The developed countries acknowledge the responsibility that they bear in the international pursuit of sustainable development {{in view of the}} pressures their societies place on the global environment and of the technologies and financial resources they command.|$|R
50|$|Nationally Appropriate Mitigation Action (NAMA) {{refers to}} a set of {{policies}} and actions that countries undertake as part of a commitment to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The term recognizes that different countries may take different nationally appropriate action on the basis of equity and in accordance with common but <b>differentiated</b> <b>responsibilities</b> and respective capabilities. It also emphasizes financial assistance from developed countries to developing countries to reduce emissions.|$|R
5000|$|Other {{proposals}} offer a new {{mandate to}} “produce greater unity amongst {{social and environmental}} agencies, so {{that the concept of}} ‘environment for development’ becomes a reality. It needs to act as a platform for establishing standards and for other types of interaction with national and international organizations and the United Nations. The principles of cooperation and common but <b>differentiated</b> <b>responsibilities</b> should be reflected in the application of this revised mandate.” ...|$|R

They welcomed the decision to establish the SAARC Environment and Disaster Management Centre. The Leaders underlined the urgency for the global community to arrive at a Protocol, another legal instrument, or an agreed outcome with legal force applicable to all by the end of 2015, based on the principles of Common but <b>Differentiated</b> <b>Responsibility</b> (CBDR), Respective Capabilities and Equity under the UNFCCC.|$|E
50|$|India {{signed and}} {{ratified}} the Protocol in August 2002. Since India is exempted from {{the framework of}} the treaty, it is expected to gain from the protocol in terms of transfer of technology and related foreign investments. At the G8 meeting in June 2005, Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh pointed out that the per-capita emission rates of the developing countries are a tiny fraction of those in the developed world. Following the principle of common but <b>differentiated</b> <b>responsibility,</b> India maintains that the major responsibility of curbing emission rests with the developed countries, which have accumulated emissions {{over a long period of}} time. However, the U.S. and other Western nations assert that India, along with China, will account for most of the emissions in the coming decades, owing to their rapid industrialization and economic growth.|$|E
5000|$|One of {{the most}} {{characteristic}} features of populism is its invocation of a common, external threat or enemy. The homogenising, unifying effect of this invocation is what produces the mythical - but more importantly reactionary and invariably exclusionary - notion of [...] "the people" [...] that is so central to the populist gesture. Swyngedouw shows that in climate politics [...] "the people" [...] becomes a united [...] "humanity" [...] facing a common predicament, regardless of the <b>differentiated</b> <b>responsibility</b> for and capacity to respond to anthropogenic climate change. Following other scholars who have analysed the alarmist tone of climate discourse, Swyngedouw also underlines that the millenarian, apocalyptic imaginaries called forth by the latter create an external threat, while also giving way to an elite-led, almost crusade-like action (the latter being a further classic feature of populism). The environmental consensus therefore entails a populist dimension.|$|E
40|$|The report {{draws on}} 30 {{real-world}} examples from developing and developed countries that demonstrate how this "capabilities approach" can achieve ambitious low-carbon and adaptation goals while simultaneously enhancing access to decent livelihoods, healthy food, quality housing, physical safety and other capabilities for individuals, communities and nations. The report's emphasis on capabilities {{can also help}} advance discussions in the UN climate negotiations about the principle of "common but <b>differentiated</b> <b>responsibilities</b> and respective capabilities. ...|$|R

Under the {{framework}} of common but <b>differentiated</b> <b>responsibilities</b> established in the 1992 Rio Declaration, the so-called developed countries must assume and pay their historical ecological debt for having contributed the most to {{the deterioration of the}} Earth system. The payment of this ecological debt to developing countries and the sectors most affected among their own populations consists of the transfer financial resources from public sources and also the effective transfer of appropriate technologies required by developing countries.|$|R
40|$|The Principle of Common but <b>Differentiated</b> <b>Responsibilities</b> and its Reflection in International Environmental Law The {{purpose of}} my thesis is to analyse the {{inception}} {{and evolution of}} the principle of common but <b>differentiated</b> <b>responsibilities</b> (CBDR principle), to describe its character and its appearance within international environmental law. In spite of being significant phenomena, the CBDR principle as well as the differentiation in international law in general have not been dealt with by Czech scholars almost at all; that is the main reason for choosing the topic. This thesis can be understood as a limited attempt to improve the situation. The methods I used in this study are primarily the analytical, logical and historical method. The thesis consists of four chapters that are divided into sections. The more extensive sections are subdivided into subsections. Chapter One is concerned with differentiation in the international law in general. The chapter is subdivided into four parts. Part One examines reconcilability of the CBDR principle with the traditional principle of sovereign equality, a principle that international law is based on. Part Two deals with the New International Economic Order as a first notable effort to introduce complex differentiation into one area of international [...] ...|$|R
40|$|Common but <b>Differentiated</b> <b>responsibility</b> {{is one of}} the {{principles}} which has been adopted in the Kyoto Protocol. Common but <b>differentiated</b> <b>responsibility</b> requires us to recognize that because of historical circumstances, countries at different stages of development have different capacities, and consequently different levels of kind of responsibility for dealing with International environmental issues. Implicit in this dichotomization is the notion that developing countries lack sufficient technical expertise, regulatory and administrative efficacy, and economic capability to reduce green house gases. The Implementaion of common but <b>differentiated</b> <b>responsibility</b> principle under the Kyoto Protocol embodys in three flexible mechanisms. These mechanism include emission trading, joint implementation, and clean development mechanism. To maintain the broader participation from develop and developing countries the Implementaion of common but <b>differentiated</b> <b>responsibility</b> principle should be based on equity principle. However, without the participation of the United States to the Kyoto Protocol mechanisms cause the implementation of the protocol less effective because the United States is the biggest emitter in the world...|$|E

CBDR is a guiding principle of international cooperationand solidarity. The paper argues soft law character of this principle, therefore the CBDR does notrepresent a legal obligation, but it has provided the legal and philosophical basis for the existing legalobligations including the instruments designed to achieve various objectives through internationalenvironmental acts, facilitating the initial agreement in certain areas {{that are difficult to}} be accepted,being more flexible in making States to accept changes...|$|E
40|$|Nations’ {{impacts on}} the ocean and their impacts on climate change are linked, {{especially}} given the synergistic interactions among these {{impacts on the}} two largest global commons—the atmosphere and the ocean. This article argues that climate change mitigation law, as represented internationally by the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and its follow-on agreements, can better reflect nations’ broader Common but <b>Differentiated</b> <b>Responsibilities</b> (CBDR) by taking ocean impacts into account—in particular, contributions to ocean acidification and to marine fishing...|$|R

40|$|The UN Framework Convention on Climate Change {{implies that}} {{countries}} should shoulder costs and burdens {{of climate change}} in accordance with <b>differentiated</b> <b>responsibilities</b> and respective capabilities, {{but it does not}} indicate how these fairness parameters are to be quantified. In this OIES Paper, Benito Müller and Lavan Mahadeva provide a novel and distinctive methodology (‘Oxford Approach’) regarding quantifying the (economic) capability of countries as a contribution to assessments of fair cost/burden distributions, an issue of central importance in the upcoming international climate change debate...|$|R
40|$|The Principle of Common but Differentiated Responsibilities (hereinafter {{referred}} to as CBDR) {{is one of the}} most effective principles in the international environmental law legal regime. It entails two elements: common responsibility and <b>differentiated</b> <b>responsibility.</b> Common responsibility describes the shared obligations of two or more States towards the protection of a particular environmental resource. <b>Differentiated</b> <b>responsibility</b> entails the need to take into account the different circumstances, particularly each State’s contribution to the evolution of a particular problem and its ability to prevent, reduce and control the threat. CBDR in the climate regime incorporates perspectives on states’ historical contributions to global environmental degradation and incorporates fairness and justice elements to be taken into account when devising relevant legal commitments. The rationale for CBDR in the climate regime is that owing to the fact that industrial countries bear the overwhelming responsibility for historical GHG emissions they should bear the primary burden of averting climate change. Accordingly, under the climate regime, developed country parties are required to take up mitigation commitments and targets. While developing countries are exempted from such commitments. This study established that non-participation of developing countries in the climate mitigation effort on the basis of CBDR is the main challenge of CBDR in the climate regime. The thesis therefore makes a case for global participation in the climate mitigation effort...|$|E
40|$|It is no {{hyperbole}} to {{say that}} climate change {{is one of the}} most urgent crises all humans face together. Among the many ways that governments have attempted to curb carbon emissions, border tax adjustments (BTAs) have majorly aimed to restore the competitiveness of developed countries with more stringent carbon control policies. This article carefully examines the proposal under the tests of international environmental laws to evaluate the implications of BTAs in international legal system. The article argues that the imposition of BTAs will be inconsistent with set principles of the common but <b>differentiated</b> <b>responsibility</b> (CBDR), sustainable development and polluter pays and cause environmental injustice due to the adaptation and vulnerability of developing countries...|$|E
40|$|Brazil, {{together}} with other emerging powers, has repeatedly made headlines {{over the last few}} years as a serious player in international climate change negotiations. In December 2015 states will convene at the UN Climate Change Conference in Paris to agree on a new international climate treaty. What can we expect from Brazil at the upcoming climate summit? What can we expect from the negotiations on a new climate treaty in the context of the Durban Platform? This issue of the GIGA Focus discusses Brazil's potential role at the upcoming UN Climate Change Conference, analysing if Brazil's expected contributions can keep up with its ambitious rhetoric. Brazil's presently low emissions trajectory is a result of reduced deforestation rates. With greenhouse gas emissions from all other sources increasing, an ambitious contribution to global post- 2020 mitigation requires more stringent action. However, it is unlikely that Brazil will take ambitious measures in areas other than forestry. While Brazilian climate diplomacy puts a rhetorical premium on historical responsibility, its substantive contribution to the negotiation process is only moderately progressive. The proposal of "concentric Differentiation" offers a way to implement the principle of common but <b>differentiated</b> <b>responsibility</b> in line with current realities while allowing for the obligations of Annex I (mostly developed countries) and major non-Annex I parties (mostly developing countries) to converge in the long term. The present context of the international negotiations is generally favourable towards Brazilian participation. The main challenge will be to conclude a transparency regime which facilitates collective action by allowing for adequate international review of domestic policies. To that end, the principle of common but <b>differentiated</b> <b>responsibility</b> should be implemented under the Paris agreement in a manner which aligns with the convention's long-term objective...|$|E

50|$|Common But <b>Differentiated</b> <b>Responsibilities</b> (CBDR) was formalized in United Nations Framework of Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) of Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro, 1992. The CBDR {{principle}} is mentioned in UNFCCC article 3 paragraph 1.., and article 4 paragraph 1. It {{was the first}} international legal instrument to address climate change and the most comprehensive international attempt to address negative impacts to global environment. CBDR principle acknowledges all states have shared obligation to address environmental destruction but denies equal responsibility of all states with regard to environmental protection.|$|R
40|$|The Kyoto Protocol is an {{international}} agreement linked to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. The major feature of the Kyoto Protocol is that it sets binding targets for 37 industrialized countries and the European community for reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Recognizing that developed countries are principally responsible for the current high levels of GHG emissions in the atmosphere {{as a result of}} more than 150 years of industrial activity, the Protocol places a heavier burden on developed nations under the principle of "common but <b>differentiated</b> <b>responsibilities.</b> ...|$|R
40|$|The {{right to}} {{development}} is still largely viewed as aspirational {{and not as}} a ‘proper’ legal right. This chapter explores if and how a rights-based approach to development could ever be carried to its logical conclusion; by holding states accountable for violations of the right to development. In doing so, a distinction is made between the internal and external dimension of the right. The chapter demonstrates that finding state responsibility for breaches of the external dimension, which contains obligations of a state towards people outside of its jurisdiction and obligations to cooperate with other states, would require a great deal of adjustments to the present framework of applicable international rules. Finally, it explores what role the concepts of intergenerational equity and common but <b>differentiated</b> <b>responsibility</b> could play in supporting such adjustments...|$|E
40|$|Accounting rules {{used for}} {{compiling}} national greenhouse gas inventories {{play a significant}} role in constituting the global climate change regime's character. These rules have major political and policy implications. Production-based accounting and national production-based emissions targets contribute to the deadlock in climate negotiations by deflecting attention away from consumption patterns and by accentuating tensions among the climate regime's underlying norms. These dynamics contribute to inefficient domestic mitigation policies, conflict over the norm of "common but differentiated responsibility," weak international agreements, and continued political neglect of consumption as a driver of emissions. In contrast, consumption-based emissions accounting would shift attention from production to consumption. Consumption-based targets could potentially provide an alternative path by which <b>differentiated</b> <b>responsibility</b> could be implemented. Adoption of consumption-based inventories might also prompt reappraisal of underlying norms and opposing conceptions of justice among states. 21 page(s...|$|E
40|$|International {{shipping}} {{is responsible}} for about 2. 7 % of the global emissions of CO 2. In the absence of proper action, emissions from the maritime sector may grow by 150 % to 250 % by 2050, {{in comparison with the}} level of emissions in 2007. Against this backdrop, the International Maritime Organisation has introduced a mandatory Energy Efficiency Design Index (EEDI) for new ships and the Ship Energy Efficiency Management Plan (SEEMP) for all ships. Some Asian countries have voiced serious reservations about the newly adopted IMO regulations. They have suggested that imposing the same obligations on all countries, irrespective of their economic status, is a serious departure from the Principle of Common but <b>Differentiated</b> <b>Responsibility,</b> which has always been the cornerstone of international climate change law discourse.
