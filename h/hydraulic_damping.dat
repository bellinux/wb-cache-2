2500|$|Throughout {{the summer}} of 1950, as many as 200 men were {{involved}} in the final steps of completion of the 1950 Tacoma Narrows Bridge. [...] On July 24, workers from Roebling's Sons were involved in wrapping and caulking the suspender cable bands, and the railings on the sidewalks were being completed. By August 22, the road deck was taking shape, as workers continued concrete pours for the roadway. Painting began that week, as eleven men worked the paint crew sandblasting and painting the stiffening truss. The bridge received its first coat of [...] "Narrows Green" [...] paint - a grayish-green hue (its predecessor had been painted the same color a decade before). By September 30, workers installed the finishing touches on the toll plazas, including installing sheetrock and plumbing. The midspan and tower <b>hydraulic</b> <b>damping</b> mechanisms were also installed, and workers began removing the catwalks, tower buttresses, and other working platforms.|$|E
2500|$|The {{suspension}} also automatically accommodates differing payloads in the car- {{with four}} people and cargo {{on board the}} wheelbase increases by around 4cm (2in) as the suspension deflects, and the castor angle of the front wheels increases {{by as much as}} 8 degrees thus ensuring that ride quality, handling and road holding are almost unaffected by the additional weight. On early cars friction dampers (like a dry version of a multi-plate clutch design) were fitted at the mountings of the front and rear swinging arms to the cross-tubes. Because the rear brakes were outboard, they had extra tuned mass dampers to damp wheel bounce from the extra unsprung mass. Later models had tuned mass dampers ("batteurs") at the front (because the leading arm had more inertia and [...] "bump/thump" [...] than the trailing arm), with hydraulic telescopic dampers / shock absorbers front and rear. The uprated <b>hydraulic</b> <b>damping</b> obviated the need for the rear inertia dampers. It was designed to be a comfortable ride by matching the frequencies encountered in human bipedal motion.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{develops}} a modification to <b>hydraulic</b> <b>damper</b> to utilize its energy {{lose in the}} form of heat. During the working of actual <b>hydraulic</b> <b>damper,</b> when the suspension fluid is compressed inside the damper cylinder in order to absorb the vibration shocks,the frictional energy of the vehicle is dissipated as heat loss by the suspension fluid in order to minimise the effect of bumps and ridges in road. So in order to harness this power loss, we have developed an energy saving <b>hydraulic</b> <b>damper</b> by modifying the existing model of <b>hydraulic</b> <b>damper.</b> We create a separate flow path with rotating turbine parallel to the damping cylinder connecting the upper and lower end of damper. When the vehicle travels down from a bump, the coil spring compresses forcing the piston to push the suspension fluid upwards and this high pressure fluid travels through the flow path rotating the turbine which in turn runs the generator for power generation. A check valve is provided at the flow path end to prevent the fluid back flow. Thus the suspension fluid kinetic energy is converted into mechanical energy by means of the turbine...|$|R
50|$|With his son Anders, Fisker started {{designing}} a new machine in 1932 and in 1934 they demonstrated a new Nimbus motorcycle, the Type C. It retained the shaft drive, a completely redesigned ohv and ohc engine of 18 (later 22) hp, and a frame made from steel strips riveted together, which were shaped {{to go around}} the gas tank much like on the pressed steel frames on several other motorcycles of the period.

The active bearing is supplied with a flexible sleeve whose deformation can be changed during operation of the rotor.

Finite Element Method (FEM) and the Guyan condensation technique was utilised to create mathematical model of both, the rotor and the flexible sleeve. The hydrodynamic pressure distribution in the oil film, for the instantaneous position of the flexible sleeve and rotor, was approximated by Reynolds equation. The mathematical model of motion of a rotor system with the described active bearing developed in this paper allowed the influence of the introduced <b>hydraulic</b> <b>damper</b> on stability of the rotor-bearing system to be investigated.

5000|$|The Maicoletta had a {{tubular steel}} frame with pressed steel body panels. [...] Front {{suspension}} {{was with a}} telescopic fork with coil springs, <b>hydraulic</b> <b>damping,</b> and a steering damper. [...] Rear suspension was with a swingarm with dual coil springs and twin hydraulic dampers. [...] The wheels were 14 inches in diameter and had a width between 3.25 inches and 3.5 inches.

50|$|<b>Hydraulic</b> <b>damping</b> is provided, as {{the leaf}} springs are {{immersed}} in oil. Any {{movement of the}} spring plates must squeeze oil through the narrow gaps around them between the plates and the casing. As the springs have a high surface area, yet {{there is only a}} small gap between them and their housing, the damping factor can be high. Damping can be adjusted completely independent from the coupling's torsional stiffness. The oil used for damping is usually supplied by the engine lubrication system, through a drilling in the crankshaft. If this is unavailable, an oil-filled coupling can be used. This oil filling also aids lubrication and encourages a long service life.|$|E

The system was a joint development between Dayco (belt supplier) and Rover.The rear link belts do not incorporate any tensioning device.

40|$|An {{elastomer}} damper was designed, tested, {{and compared}} {{with the performance of}} a <b>hydraulic</b> <b>damper</b> for a power transmission shaft.

This permitted a direct comparison of damper effectiveness. The elastomer damper consistently performed better than the hydraulic mount and permitted stable operation of the power transmission shaft to speeds higher than obtained with the squeeze film damper. Tests were performed on shear specimens of Viton- 79, Buna-N, EPDM, and Neoprene to determine performance limitations imposed by strain, temperature, and frequency. Frequencies of between 110 Hz and 1100 Hz were surveyed with imposed strains between 0. 0005 and 0. 08 at temperatures of 32 C, 66 C, and 80 C.

50|$|Simply {{designed}} with single top and down tubes, the Venom's heavy brazed-lug frame (which had clear origins in bicycle manufacture) was well proven for its handling capability. At the rear {{was an unusual}} swinging arm design with two separate arms clamped to a cross-tube instead of the traditional welded-section rear fork. Although this was effective, {{it was difficult to}} set up the horizontal alignment. The rear shock absorbers were originally made by Woodhead Monroe, then replaced by Armstrong units and eventually Girling shocks. These could easily be adjusted to suit the rider's preference by moving them in special curved slots.

These used a belt coiled inside a device such that it freely wound in under the action of a coiled spring, but met friction when drawn out. Gabriel Snubbers were fitted to an 11.9HP Arrol-Johnston car which broke the 6 hour Class B record at Brooklands in late 1912, and the Automotor journal noted that this snubber might have a great future for racing due to its light weight and easy fitment.|$|E
50|$|An Arresting gear, or {{arrestor}} gear, is {{a mechanical}} system used to rapidly decelerate an aircraft as it lands. Arresting gear on aircraft carriers {{is an essential}} component of naval aviation, and it is most commonly used on CATOBAR and STOBAR aircraft carriers. Similar systems are also found at land-based airfields for expeditionary or emergency use. Typical systems consist of several steel wire ropes laid across the aircraft landing area, designed to be caught by an aircraft's tailhook. During a normal arrestment, the tailhook engages the wire and the aircraft's kinetic energy is transferred to <b>hydraulic</b> <b>damping</b> systems attached below the carrier deck. There are other related systems which use nets to catch aircraft wings or landing gear. These barricade and barrier systems are only used for emergency arrestments for aircraft without operable tailhooks.|$|E

40|$|In {{structural}} engineering, the {{damping device}} {{is the best}} way to equip the structure for resisting earthquakes. The newly developed displacement dependent semi-active <b>hydraulic</b> <b>damper</b> (DSHD) is a kind of <b>hydraulic</b> <b>damper</b> to reduce the structural response. The DSHD is a fixture connecting the brace and the structure. At a seismic loading, the DSHD is functioned to dissipate the energy at the transition of bracing from the tensile constraint to the compressive constraint or in reverse. When a structure suffers a large seismic excitation, the overflow function is triggered to prevent the failure of a bracing member. That is, at the stress in the linked brace reaching a certain value, it will start the opening of the overflow valve maintaining an aptotic pressure for confining the bracing deformation within the design value. This DSHD provides availability for resisting excessive vibration in the structural design. In this paper, the analysis modeling is set up for simulating the nonlinear behavior of DSHD. The performance of DSHD is investigated in the nonlinear analysis for seismic evaluation...|$|R

50|$|One of the {{earliest}} hydraulic dampers to go into production was the Telesco Shock Absorber, exhibited at the 1912 Olympia Motor Show and marketed by Polyrhoe Carburettors Ltd. This contained a spring inside the telescopic unit like the pure spring type 'shock absorbers' mentioned above, but also oil and an internal valve so that the oil damped in the rebound direction. The Telesco unit was fitted at the rear end of the leaf spring, {{in place of the}} rear spring to chassis mount, so that it formed part of the springing system, albeit a hydraulically damped part. This layout was presumably selected as it was easy to apply to existing vehicles, but it meant the <b>hydraulic</b> <b>damping</b> was not applied to the action of the main leaf spring, but only to the action of the auxiliary spring in the unit itself.|$|E

5000|$|Compression of a gas, {{for example}} {{pneumatic}} shock absorbers, which can act like springs {{as the air}} pressure is building to resist the force on it. Enclosed gas is compressible, so equipment is less subject to shock damage. This concept was first applied in series production on Citroën cars in 1954. Today, many shock absorbers are pressurized with compressed nitrogen, to reduce the tendency for the oil to cavitate under heavy use. This causes foaming which temporarily reduces the damping ability of the unit. In very heavy duty units used for racing or off-road use, there may even be a secondary cylinder connected to the shock absorber {{to act as a}} reservoir for the oil and pressurized gas. In aircraft landing gear, air shock absorbers may be combined with <b>hydraulic</b> <b>damping</b> to reduce bounce.

40|$|A {{prosthetic}} swing-phase {{control mechanism}} simulates {{the action of}} thigh musculature to aid in increased gait function. In this work, a <b>hydraulic</b> <b>damper</b> and a magnetorheological (MR) damper are designed as controllers with an objective of evaluating their performance in controlling swing-phase damping in an above-knee prosthesis. Parametric models are utilized to represent dynamic properties of the dampers. Based on the models, control parameters that govern damping force and displacement of the dampers are identified. Parameters of the dampers are determined through optimization that minimizes the error between the prosthesis knee angle trajectories and a desired knee angle trajectory for normal level ground walking from experimental data. Experimental data of thigh and hip motions are introduced as inputs into a dynamic system to determine sets of control parameters. Furthermore, input thigh motion is also deviated to evaluate robustness of the controllers in real application. Comparison of the desired knee angle trajectory {{with those of the}} knee angle trajectories obtained from control parameters is done with respect to maximum achievable knee flexion angle, duration of swing phase, shank velocity at the end of swing phase and mean angle difference.

40|$|In this dissertation, an {{analytical}} investigation on active, semi-active and passive vibration control mechanisms {{is presented in}} order to achieve improved shock and vibration isolation of mechanical systems, especially ground vehicle applications. A hybrid active vibration isolation system, incorporating an electro-magnetic force generator along with passive damping and spring elements, is mathematically modeled based on fundamental physical laws and taking into account the generator dynamics. Complete vibration isolation characteristics of the hybrid active control system are evaluated for various feedback variables and control schemes, using numerical simulations. Influence of the force generator dynamics on vibration isolation performance is illustrated through the simulation results. A concept of tunable pressure limiting modulation is proposed in <b>hydraulic</b> <b>damper</b> systems. A <b>hydraulic</b> orifice <b>damper</b> is modified by using the proposed tunable pressure limiting modulation to achieve variable damping in vibration isolation systems, without requiring any external energy source, sophisticated control devices and feedback instrumentation that are essential for active and semi-active isolators. The fluid flow equations are employed to develop the nonlinear mathematical model of the <b>hydraulic</b> <b>damper,</b> incorporating the fluid and mechanical compliance, and the dynamics of the pressure limiting mechanism. The computer simulation reveals that the shock and vibration isolation performance of the tunable pressure limited <b>hydraulic</b> <b>damper</b> systems is comparable to that of the semi-active 'on-off' vibration control systems. A generalized harmonic linearization technique, based on a principle of energy similarity of dynamic elements, is proposed to derive equivalent linear representations of both nonlinear damping and spring elements, in the frequency domain. An analysis of the nonlinear in-plane vehicle model, with air-springs, orifice damping and pressure limiting modulation due to tunable hydraulic shock absorbers, is carried out to establish the stochastic response to random road inputs in terms of power spectral density, and to illustrate the improved vehicle ride performance due to tunable shock absorbers. An interconnected hydro-pneumatic suspension with tunable pressure limiting mechanism is presented to achieve improved vehicle ride and handling performance. Analysis of a roll plane model of a vehicle employing the tunable interconnected suspension shows that the connections of fluid flow within the interconnected suspension provide an enhanced static roll stability; while the tunable pressure limiting modulation between the strut and the accumulator of each suspension unit offers an improved vehicle ride performanc...|$|R
