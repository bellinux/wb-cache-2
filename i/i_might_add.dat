The questions on the Mundt-Nixon bill, his views on the loyalty oath, and the problem of international communism were just what he was waiting for. Indeed, he was so skillful—and, <b>I</b> <b>might</b> <b>add,</b> cagey—that those who came indifferent were sold, and even many of those who came to heckle went away with doubts... If he is only a fraction as effective as he was here you have a formidable opponent on your hands.|$|E
500|$|Until {{asked to}} perform and {{interpret}} Joaquín Rodrigo's Concierto de Aranjuez in 1991, de Lucía was not proficient at reading musical notation. Biographer Pohren, however, {{at the time}} of writing his biography in 1992, said that he was still not proficient and had found a bizarre way of learning the piece, locking himself away. His performance with the orchestra under Edmon Colomer was highly acclaimed, a sensitive, atmospheric rendition that composer Rodrigo himself praised, describing it as [...] "pretty, exotic, inspired" ... <b>I</b> <b>might</b> <b>add</b> that Paco plays it {{with a great deal of}} feeling, far more than is normally heard. And that goes for the orchestra that backs him up." [...] In 1992, he performed live at the bullring at Seville Expo '92, and a year later on the Plaza Mayor in Madrid, playing [...] "La Barrosa". In 1995, he and Bryan Adams recorded the hit song and video Have You Ever Really Loved A Woman on the soundtrack for the American film Don Juan DeMarco.|$|E

2500|$|The salvage of Squalus was {{commanded}} by Rear Admiral Cyrus W. Cole, Commander of the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard, who supervised salvage officer Lieutenant Floyd A. Tusler from the Construction Corps. Tusler's {{plan was to}} lift the submarine in three stages {{to prevent it from}} rising too quickly, out of control, with one end up, in which case there would be a high likelihood of it sinking again. For 50 days, divers worked to pass cables underneath the submarine and attach pontoons for buoyancy. On 13 July 1939, the stern was raised successfully, but when the men attempted to free the bow from the hard blue clay, the vessel began to rise far too quickly, slipping its cables. Ascending vertically, the submarine broke the surface, and [...] of the bow reached into the air for not more than ten seconds before she sank once again {{all the way to the}} bottom. Momsen said of the mishap, [...] "pontoons were smashed, hoses cut and <b>I</b> <b>might</b> <b>add,</b> hearts were broken." [...] After 20 more days of preparation, with a radically redesigned pontoon and cable arrangement, the next lift was successful, as were two further operations. Squalus was towed into Portsmouth on 13 September, and decommissioned on 15 November. A total of 628 dives had been made in rescue and salvage operations.|$|E
2500|$|During the Cuban Missile Crisis in October 1962, Stevenson gave a {{presentation}} at an emergency {{session of the}} Security Council. In his presentation, which attracted national television coverage, he forcefully asked Soviet UN representative Valerian Zorin if his country was installing nuclear missiles in Cuba, and when Zorin appeared reluctant to reply, Stevenson punctuated with the demand [...] "Don't wait for the translation, answer 'yes' or 'no'!" [...] When Zorin replied that [...] "I am not in an American court of law, and therefore do not answer a question put {{to me in the}} manner of a prosecuting counsel...you will have your answer in due course", Stevenson retorted, [...] "I am prepared to wait for my answer until Hell freezes over." [...] Stevenson then showed photographs taken by a U-2 spy plane which proved the existence of nuclear missiles in Cuba, just after Zorin had implied they did not exist. Stevenson also attended several meetings of the EXCOMM at the White House during the Missile Crisis, where he boldly proposed to make an exchange with the Soviets: if they would remove their missiles from Cuba, the United States would agree to remove its obsolete Jupiter missiles from Turkey. However, he faced strong opposition from some other EXCOMM members, who regarded such an exchange as a sign of weakness. According to Kennedy adviser and Stevenson friend George W. Ball, who was present, these members [...] "intemperately upbraided Stevenson... outraged and shrill." [...] However, President Kennedy remarked [...] "You have to admire Adlai, he sticks to his position even when everyone is jumping on him", and Robert Kennedy wrote that [...] "Stevenson has since been criticized for the position he took at the meeting...although I disagreed strongly with his recommendations, I thought he was courageous to make them, and <b>I</b> <b>might</b> <b>add</b> that they made as much sense as some others considered during that period of time." [...] Stevenson remarked [...] "I know that most of those fellows will consider me a coward for the rest of my life for what I said today, but perhaps we need a coward in the room when we are talking about nuclear war." [...] In fact, the Kennedy Administration did remove the Jupiter-class MRBMs from Italy and Turkey some six months after the Cuban Missile Crisis ended, and there is evidence that President Kennedy privately agreed that, if the Soviets would remove their missiles from Cuba, he would remove the Jupiter missiles from Turkey and Italy at a later date. [...] The deal was kept a secret for many years, however, and Stevenson was thus given no credit for his original suggestion.|$|E

I go on, therefore, upon the second head, to give you some rules for your conduct and behaviour, in order to defend yourselves against the malice and cunning of false accusers.|$|R

Nor could I see how I was to live without her, life lacking a motive being incomprehensible: yet the fire of optimism in me, though died down to ashes, would not be extinguished. At moments it flared up into what almost amounted to a conviction that she could not resist my appeal. I had threatened to go to her, and more than once I started packing....|$|R
