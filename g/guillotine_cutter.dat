Tsubasa {{ultimately}} agrees, leaving her panties with Koyomi as a promise that they will reunite later. Nonetheless, <b>Guillotine</b> <b>Cutter</b> kidnaps Tsubasa, and Meme advises that Koyomi must [...] "forget about being human again" [...] in order to rescue her. Koyomi uses a power to transform his arms into tree roots to defeat <b>Guillotine</b> <b>Cutter</b> and save Tsubasa, but appears to have abandoned his wish to become human again.|$|E

50|$|Koyomi and Meme finally {{succeed at}} fully {{restoring}} Kiss-shot. Koyomi expects Kiss-Shot to then change {{him back to}} human. But before that, Kiss-shot and Koyomi spend an evening on a rooftop, where Kiss-shot reminisces about her previous minion, a Samurai who chose to commit suicide when Kiss-shot {{was not able to}} restore his humanity. Koyomi goes off to buy food, but when he returns he finds Kiss-shot eating the eviscerated corpse of <b>Guillotine</b> <b>Cutter.</b> He is horrified at the realization that Kiss-Shot will now hunt humans again, and that he himself will want to hunt as well.|$|E
50|$|The last of {{the most}} common type of cuts is the V-cut. V-cutters look like <b>guillotine</b> <b>cutters,</b> but cut a wedge into the cigar cap rather than {{completely}} removing it, creating a clean-looking gash. Good V-cutters penetrate deeper into the filler than straight cutters, and some smokers prefer them for thicker gauge cigars. However, cheap V-cutters can result in sloppy cuts too deep into the cigar, which result in an uneven burn.|$|R
50|$|Flock worker's lung can be {{prevented}} with engineering controls that protect workers from inhaling flock. Engineering controls to prevent inhalation of flock can include using <b>guillotine</b> <b>cutters</b> rather than rotary cutters, and ensuring that blades are sharp, since dull blades shear off more respirable particles. Flocking plants have also implemented medical surveillance programs for workers to diagnose cases at an earlier stage. Another technique for preventing flock worker's lung is cleaning the workplace with alternatives to compressed air {{in order to avoid}} resuspending particulates in the air.|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{investigate}} the effects of a pyroshock environment on the performance characteristics of a propellant used in pyrotechnic devices such as <b>guillotine</b> <b>cutters.</b> A heritage pressure cartridge assembly which uses a nitramine nitrocellulose propellant with a known performance baseline will be exposed to a near field pyroshock event. The pressure cartridge will then be fired in an ambient closed bomb firing to collect pressure time history. This data will be compared to the baseline data to evaluate the effects of the shock on the performance of the propellant...|$|R
5000|$|Early 1950's {{video tape}} {{recorders}} (VTR) were so expensive, {{and the quality}} degradation caused by copying was so great, that 2 inch Quadruplex videotape was edited by visualizing the recorded track with ferrofluid and cutting with a razor blade or <b>guillotine</b> <b>cutter</b> and splicing with video tape. The two pieces of tape to be joined were painted with a solution of extremely fine iron filings suspended in carbon tetrachloride, a toxic and carcinogenic compound. This [...] "developed" [...] the magnetic tracks, making them visible when viewed through a microscope {{so that they could}} be aligned in a splicer designed for this task.|$|E
5000|$|The {{show was}} {{recorded}} at NBC's Burbank facility using two-inch quadruplex videotape. Since computer-controlled online editing {{had not been}} invented at the time, post-production video editing of the montage was achieved by the error-prone method of visualizing the recorded track with ferrofluid and cutting it with a razor blade or <b>guillotine</b> <b>cutter</b> and splicing with video tape, {{in a manner similar}} to film editing. This had the incidental benefit of ensuring that the master tape would be preserved, since a spliced tape could not be recycled for further use. Laugh-In editor Arthur Schneider won an Emmy Award in 1968 for his pioneering use of the [...] "jump cut" [...] - the unique editing style in which a sudden cut from one shot to another was made without a fade-out.|$|E
5000|$|Originally, {{video was}} edited by {{visualizing}} the recorded track with ferrofluid and cutting {{it with a}} razor blade or <b>guillotine</b> <b>cutter</b> and splicing with video tape, {{in a manner similar}} to film editing. This was an arduous process and avoided where possible. When it was used, the two pieces of tape to be joined were painted with a solution of extremely fine iron filings suspended in carbon tetrachloride, a toxic and carcinogenic compound. This [...] "developed" [...] the magnetic tracks, making them visible when viewed through a microscope so that they could be aligned in a splicer designed for this task. The tracks had to be cut during a vertical retrace, without disturbing the odd-field/even-field ordering. The cut also had to be at the same angle that the video tracks were laid down on the tape. Since the video and audio read heads were several inches apart it was not possible to make a physical edit that would function correctly in both video and audio. The cut was made for video and a portion of audio then re-copied into the correct relationship, the same technique as for editing 16mm film with a combined magnetic audio track.|$|E

40|$|The overall {{purpose of}} this study is to {{investigate}} the effects of a pyroshock environment on the performance characteristics of a propellant used in pyrotechnic devices such as <b>guillotine</b> <b>cutters.</b> Near field pyroshock which is defined by acceleration amplitudes in excess of 10, 000 g at a frequency of greater than 10, 000 Hz is a highly transient environment that has a known potential to cause failure in both structural and electronic components. A heritage pressure cartridge assembly which uses a nitramine nitrocellulose propellant with a known performance baseline will be exposed to a near field pyroshock event. The pressure cartridge will then be fired in an ambient closed bomb firing to collect pressure time history. The two performance characteristics that will be evaluated are the pressure amplitude and time to peak pressure. This data will be compared to the base-lined ambient closed bomb data to evaluate the effects of the shock on the performance of the propellant. It is expected that the pyroshock environment will cause brittle failures of the propellant increasing the surface area of said propellant. This increase of surface area should result in increased combustion rate which should show as an increased pressure peak and decreased time to peak pressure in the pressure time data...|$|R
40|$|Vitreous {{specimens}} can {{be useful}} for diagnosis of intraocular infection, inflammation, and neoplasms. Concern has been raised that obtaining vitreous specimens through a <b>guillotine</b> <b>cutter</b> might result in suboptimal cytologic changes. To determine if aspiration yields better cytologic information than vitrectomy, the authors performed experimental vitreous biopsies on rabbit eyes with vitritis to compare specimens taken by aspiration or vitrectomy with cutting rates of 100, 300, 600 per minute. The specimens were processed by cytospin preparations and stained with Papanicolaou and May-Grünwald-Giemsa stain. There {{was no difference in}} the adequacy of the specimens. Cell loss or damage to cell morphologic features when obtaining specimens through aspiration or vitrectomy at different cutting rates could not be differentiated by a blinded cytologic evaluation. A theoretical model of shear stress on cells passing through a <b>guillotine</b> <b>cutter</b> was also developed. The experimental and theoretical data show that vitrectomy with a cutting rate as fast as 600 per minute yields an adequate specimen with a sufficient number of well preserved cells to make definite cytologic interpretations, and that vitreous aspiration is not necessary...|$|E

The colloidal gold conjugates were prepared {{according to the}} producer’s instruction and printed on conjugate pad at the proportion of 4  uL per test strip and dried at room temperature. Absorbent pad, nitrocellulose membrane, conjugate pad, and sample pad were pasted on the laminating card in order with proper overlapping distance. Eventually, the whole card was cut into final test strips of 4  mm in width with <b>guillotine</b> <b>cutter.</b>|$|E

After drying for 30 min, the wafer was blocked with PBS containing 1 % BSA (w/v). The SERS probes were printed on a glass fiber filter as conjugate pad and dried at room temperature. The absorbent pad, conjugate pad, and sample pad were cut into strips of 1 mm in width with a <b>guillotine</b> <b>cutter</b> and overlapped on the laminating card with the dried wafer {{as shown in}} Figure  1.|$|E
50|$|One {{method of}} cutting {{a stack of}} 500 to 1000 pages in one pass is {{accomplished}} with a <b>guillotine</b> paper <b>cutter.</b> This is a large steel table with a paper vise that screws down onto the stack and firmly secures it before cutting. The cut is accomplished with a large sharpened steel blade which moves straight down and cuts {{the entire length of}} each sheet all at once. A lever on the blade permits several hundred pounds of force to be applied to the blade for a quick one-pass cut.|$|R
50|$|An {{alternate}} {{method of}} unbinding books {{is to use}} a table saw. While this method is potentially dangerous and does not leave as smooth an edge as the <b>guillotine</b> paper <b>cutter</b> method, it is more readily available to the average person. The ideal method is to clamp the book between two thick boards using heavy machine screws to provide the clamping force. The entire wood and book package is fed through the table saw using the rip fence as a guide. A sharp fine carbide tooth blade is ideal for generating an acceptable cut. The quality of the cut depends on the blade, feed rate, type of paper, paper coating, and binding material.|$|R
50|$|The {{plant was}} of a very limited size, {{comprising}} two small platen printing machines, other subsidiary items such as a small paper <b>cutter</b> (<b>guillotine),</b> stapler, stitcher etc., also three or four cabinets of type of various fonts and sizes. The Plant was subsequently moved from Ndola to Chingola and opened for business in a corrugated-iron structure which had been a store room owned by Mr. B.I. Menashe, a prominent storekeeper in Chingola. They commenced with production of invoices, cards, small leaflets and other items however their range was limited {{by the size of}} the small platen printing machines. Shortly after opening they bought a Phoenix press which enabled them to print larger pieces and eventually a newspaper.|$|R
40|$|The {{evolution}} of a new machine is described, from an idea conceived in 1960 to a prototype operative in September 1964. The {{emphasis is on the}} decisions, methods, criteria, and results incorporated in the machine rather than on analytical aspects of the design. The primary criterion guiding the design was to provide a machine more economical for users to own. A description is given of the machine, PC 64, which is a new completely hydraulic 42 in. x 4 in. capacity production paper cutter of the guillotine type, weighing less than 3000 lbs. Introduction of the essentials of a <b>guillotine</b> <b>cutter</b> and analysis of a 1960 commercial machine are used to establish reference limits for the new machine. Results of cutting tests performed to determine the most advantageous cutting angle are included. Important new features of PC 64 include a single shear straightline motion knife drive powered by a single hydraulic cylinder, and a hydraulically driven and controlled backstop. Optional automatic control for the backstop is accomplished by means of notched program bars affording trimout cuts to. 015 in. It is shown that for any cutting angle selected, the height, width, and length of PC 64 cannot be reduced further. The machine is evaluated by comparison with commercial cutters marketed prior to and during the project. From the comparison it is concluded that features of PC 64 have commercial potential and that the primary criterion has been met. Photographic materials on pages 11, 48, 49, 162, 163 and 181 are essential and will not reproduce clearly on Xerox copies. Photographic copies should be ordered. </p...|$|E
40|$|Introduction and purpose: Industrial {{accidents}} are highly prevalent. Regarding this, identification {{of the risk}} factors of occupational accidents {{can be helpful in}} preventing the occurrence of this type of accidents. The aim {{of this study was to}} assess the risk factors in the incidence of occupational accidents and prioritize the severity of the identified risks in order to prevent their occurrence. Methods: The current study utilized failure mode effects analysis (FMEA) method to evaluate the potential risk factors. All the units of Educational Equipment Manufacturers Company, including 12 different workstations with 55 employees, were assessed; furthermore, failure modes and effects as well as the causes of the failure of each component were recorded. Subsequently, Risk Priority Number (RPN)  of each workstation was separately calculated and the crisis level of each risk was prioritized.  Results: According to the results of the study, a variety of 51 risk factors were identified among 12 different workstations at the factory. It was demonstrated that  4. 25 %, 9. 54 %, and 6. 19 % of these risk factors were within acceptable, unacceptable, and emergency level, respectively. The highest risk frequency was related to the electric shock caused by working on <b>guillotine,</b> <b>cutter,</b> bending machine, and drilling press. However, the crisis level of these risk factors were found to be average owing to the decrease in the occurrence of these risk factors which was the result of control measures.  Conclusion: This study revealed a direct relationship between RPN and the frequency of occupational accidents. Because of the high risks of the aforementioned machines, plant workers are highly prone to occupational accidents and injuries. Although FMEA method is a functional approach in determining the risks of occupational accidents, it is also recommended to use process hazard analysis in order to have a more precise and comprehensive assessment.  ...|$|E
