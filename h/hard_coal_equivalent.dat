40|$|Lignite {{is one of}} {{the three}} columns of Germany’s energy mix and has the {{potential}} to affect the entire national economy. It accounted for approximately 40 % of Germany’s primary energy production in 2007 equivalent to 180 million tons. Almost all of this fuelled conventional power plants while a small portion was converted to pulverised lignite or briquettes. In order to use lignite in the existing boiler systems efficiently, it is dried prior to combustion. This creates a higher gross calorific value and shifts the water molecules within the lignite matrix or vaporises them. To achieve a combustible product several processes are employed. The power plants in the Rhineland use either mill drying or the fluidised bed dryer with internal heat recovery. This thesis examines an alternative pre-combustion drying procedure which utilises microwaves at frequency of 2, 45 GHz. These heat the water in the lignite above the boiling point and generates, {{by the nature of the}} process, a volumetric drying instead of a convection heat transfer. Due to the excess energy in such a system, local overheating can occur that may lead to degradation of the carbon structure within the coal molecules. Taking this into consideration the volatile matter of each sample was surveyed. The microwave drying process was conducted in two steps. The first focussed on the fundamentals of the process while the second addressed the up-scaling feasibility. The initial research was carried out on a laboratory scale utilising a modified household microwave. The industrial up-scaling tests were conducted in an industrial microwave oven. The drying tests in the laboratory were accompanied by an ultimate analysis to check for any alteration in coal properties due to microwave radiation. The microwave was set to 900 W for a maximum of 7. 5 minutes at intervals of 30 seconds. Within 6. 6 minutes the moisture content of a 100 g sample dropped to the targeted 14 %. The ultimate analysis proved that the only hydrogen removed from the samples was that due to the evaporation of water, not from the carbon structure. Furthermore the volatile matter slightly decreased but this was not mirrored by a decrease in carbon content or calorific value. The experiments on a pilot plant scale confirmed the results from the laboratory and further experience was gained about the drying behaviour of lignite treated at 5 kW and 10 kW. As expected the process speeds up but without the loss of volatile matter from the coal. As well as a drying effect the microwaves change the porosity of the coal matrix that shows up as enlarged pore sizes and radii. The macro pores could be significantly enlarged by the radiation. The energy balance is considered to be a crucial criterion when assessing any drying technology. The general requirements for an industrial scale microwave drying plant were calculated using data gathered from an operating lignite fuelled power plant in the Rhineland. Employing this information the capital and operating costs of a microwave drying plant under variable conditions were deduced with reference to the energy balance and the laboratory data. The energy content of a <b>hard</b> <b>coal</b> <b>equivalent</b> served as the economic benchmark for the process. Real and idealised microwave lignite drying processes were compared to hard coal in order to evaluate their economical viability. The results showed that to derive an equal amount of energy the real microwave process costs 2. 39 times more than the hard coal alternative and the idealised one 2. 13 times more. Even if the investment cost were ignored the cost for supplying the same amount of <b>hard</b> <b>coal</b> <b>equivalent</b> would be 1, 84 times higher. The process becomes economically viable if the price for the <b>hard</b> <b>coal</b> <b>equivalent</b> exceeds 181 €/t and the price for installed microwave radiation is below 50 €/kW. Lignite fuelled power plants will come under increasing pressure because they have higher CO 2 emissions than hard coal plants. The cost of the necessary Carbon Emission Certificates worsens the economic case for the microwave drying process. Based on the work carried out in this thesis the conclusion is that the drying of lignite from the Rhenish Basin by microwave methods is not currently economical nor is it likely to be in the foreseeable future...|$|E

40|$|The {{efficiency}} of electricity generation in <b>hard</b> <b>coal</b> fired power plants varies considerably {{from country to}} country and over time. These differences occur both between developing and developed countries and between industrialised nations. The econometric analysis presented in this paper tests for the reasons of these discrepancies. In this examination abundance of <b>hard</b> <b>coal</b> and the price of <b>hard</b> <b>coal</b> are the two variables of our major interest. We assume that countries with an abundance of <b>hard</b> <b>coal</b> or relatively low costs of extraction show smaller degrees of efficiency than countries with poor deposits of this resource because the latter nations have a stronger dependency on efficient power plants than the former. Furthermore, higher prices should lead to more efficient electricity generation since production costs increase with growing <b>hard</b> <b>coal</b> prices. Our findings partially confirm these hypotheses and suggest that, among the chosen explanatory variables, <b>hard</b> <b>coal</b> abundance or the accessibility of <b>hard</b> <b>coal,</b> respectively, the <b>hard</b> <b>coal</b> price, the level of foreign direct investment inflows as well as the average power plant age are identified as principal drivers of power plant efficiency. From an environmental policy perspective we conclude that flexible policy instruments which internalise external effects caused by emissions as well as support for foreign investments are important means to foster energy efficiency.

50|$|This {{mining area}} covers {{parts of the}} cities Dresden (part Gittersee) and Freital. Mining for <b>hard</b> <b>coal</b> in the area is known to date from the 16th century. In 1949 Wismut studied {{radioactive}} anomalies {{in parts of the}} coal field and took over some mines. Mine ownership alternated several times between Wismut and the local <b>hard</b> <b>coal</b> mining company. In the early 1950s, when the coal field belonged to the <b>hard</b> <b>coal</b> mining company, two new main shafts in Dresden-Gittersee were sunk to depths of about 700 m and the mine was renamed 'Willi Agatz', after a leader of the East German communist party. In 1968 production of coal for energy production was eventually stopped and the mine was transferred a last time to SDAG Wismut. From that time on coal was only mined for its uranium content. The deposit was depleted in 1989 after producing about 3,700 tonnes of uranium since 1949 and 40 million tonnes of <b>hard</b> <b>coal</b> since the 16th century. It was the last Saxonian <b>hard</b> <b>coal</b> mine to be shut down. The uranium-bearing coal was milled at small local plants in Freital when Wismut first was active in the area in the 1950s. After 1968 the coal was milled at Crossen.|$|R

40|$|The master thesis {{represents}} {{the final step}} of the MSc Business and Management study program at Plymouth University, UK. The research report has been written {{as part of a}} four month internship at STEAG Energy Services GmbH, Germany. By performing the research within the organisation it was possible to obtain more detailed and profound information for achieving the initial research aim. The aim of the report is to examine a potential biomass co-firing in Germany and if this co-firing can be applied in a cost-effective way. This aim and particular the topic biomass co-firing has been chosen due to the current Energy Turnaround taking place on the German Energy market. Within this Energy Turnaround the government agreed on abandoning the nuclear power plants until 2020 and on the extensive construction of renewable energies. Thus the intention and the final goal of the Energy Turnaround is to become completely independent from conventional energy sources like nuclear, coal or gas power plants. For a company like STEAG which for many years focused on the energy production from <b>hard</b> <b>coal</b> power plants, this pathway of going green introduces challenging times. The {{reason for this is that}} the renewable energies profit besides a constant financial support, from a priority electricity feed-in into the German electricity grid. This means that the more expensive electricity, generated by conventional <b>hard</b> <b>coal</b> power plants, moves backwards in the merit order. Electricity from <b>hard</b> <b>coal</b> plants can thus only be marketed if the renewable energies, nuclear plants and lignite coal plants cannot meet the amount of demanded electricity. As a consequence of the shrinking demand from <b>hard</b> <b>coal</b> power plants, the full load operating hours of the still running power stations is declining which ultimately results in a profit setback for the power plant operator. The research provided information on how the development of decreasing full load operating hours in a <b>hard</b> <b>coal</b> power plant can be anticipated by subsidizing a share of the <b>hard</b> <b>coal</b> with biomass. While examining this option the analysis gave evidence for a missing profitability of biomass co-firing in a <b>hard</b> <b>coal</b> power plant. The result for this is the higher costs of biomass compared with the cost for <b>hard</b> <b>coal</b> including the CO 2 emission charges. However, the research revealed that a potential biomass co-firing will become cost-effective in the future as a result of the forecasted increasing CO 2 certificate and <b>hard</b> <b>coal</b> prices. Moreover, it can be commented that under the current renewable sources act (EEG) in Germany, not the renewable energy technologies are supported which are eventually the most efficient technologies. Photovoltaic receives as an outcome of the study a ten time’s higher specific support as it would be necessary for supporting a biomass co-firing. This implies that it would be more beneficial to substitute a biomass co-firing instead of for example photovoltaic. For this technology a support sum would even decline in the upcoming years because it is probable that the prices for <b>hard</b> <b>coal</b> and CO 2 certificates will increase...|$|R
