5|$|Another {{variation}} on the theme was produced later in the season. Like the BT46B, the BT46C removed the radiators <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> wing assembly leaving a clean aerodynamic wing and moving the centre of gravity further back again.

5|$|Due to {{the steep}} slope {{on which the}} {{building}} is situated, {{it had to be}} specially designed out of concrete to fit into its foundations correctly. <b>From</b> <b>the</b> <b>front,</b> the building appears to have only three floors. However, from the rear, all of its six floors can be seen. One part of the building's foundation was made of concrete piles, and the other as a continuous foundation. Usually, these two approaches do not mix well but Horodecki somehow succeeded in overcoming this technical problem.|$|E
