25|$|In {{the normal}} mode {{descriptions}} of Schumann resonances, the <b>fundamental</b> <b>mode</b> is a standing wave in the Earthâ€“ionosphere cavity with a wavelength {{equal to the}} circumference of the Earth. This lowest-frequency (and highest-intensity) mode of the Schumann resonance occurs at a frequency of approximately 7.83Hz, but this frequency can vary slightly {{from a variety of}} factors, such as solar-induced perturbations to the ionosphere, which compresses the upper wall of the closed cavity. The higher resonance modes are spaced at approximately 6.5Hz intervals, a characteristic attributed to the atmosphere's spherical geometry. The peaks exhibit a spectral width of approximately 20% on account of the damping of the respective modes in the dissipative cavity. The 8th partial lies at approximately 60Hz.|$|E

40|$|We {{experimentally}} {{study the}} transport prop- erties of dipolar and <b>fundamental</b> <b>modes</b> on one di- mensional (1 D) coupled waveguide arrays. By carefully modulating a wide optical beam, {{we are able}} to effec- tively excite dipolar or <b>fundamental</b> <b>modes</b> to study discrete diffraction (single-site excitation) and gaussian beam propagation (multi-site excitation plus a phase gradient). We observe that dipolar modes experience a larger spreading area due to an effective larger coupling constant, which is found to be more than two times larger than the one for <b>fundamental</b> <b>modes.</b> Addition- ally, we study the effect of non-diagonal disorder and find that while <b>fundamental</b> <b>modes</b> are already trapped on a weakly disorder array, dipoles are still able to prop- agate across the system.

40|$|AbstractThe {{present study}} is devoted to {{nonlinear}} (resonant) mode interactions {{in the wake of}} a medium height, cylindrical roughness element, which is placed in a laminar, airfoil boundary layer. The roughness element causes a considerable mean flow distortion in the near wake centerline region and two counter-rotating vortex pairs arise in the outer spanwise domain. In the streamwise evolution the mean flow stabilizes and a spanwise uniform flow is recovered in the far wake. Upstream of the roughness controlled, low-amplitude Tollmien-Schlichting (TS) wave modes are excited in the upper branch unstable region. The interference of the excited, 2 D <b>fundamental</b> <b>modes</b> with the roughness results in the excitation of oblique modes in a broad spanwise wave number range. Nonlinear interactions in-between the (oblique) <b>fundamental</b> <b>modes</b> in the destabilized near wake lead to the generation of primary, low-frequency modes at the difference frequencies of the <b>fundamental</b> <b>modes,</b> before the <b>fundamental</b> <b>modes</b> can recover linear stability characteristics in the far wake. In contrast, the primary, subharmonic-type modes experience a nonlinear growth, which is a result of frequency and spanwise wave number detuned resonant mode interactions with the 2 D <b>fundamental</b> <b>modes.</b> The resonant growth of the primary interaction modes initiates a symmetrization of the spectrum in the low-frequency, subharmonic range. That is, symmetric subharmonic-type (secondary) modes are resonantly amplified in the far wake. Therefore, although the <b>fundamental</b> <b>modes</b> recover linear stability characteristics with the stabilization of the mean flow, resonant mode interactions in the low-frequency, subharmonic range initiate the onset of boundary layer transition in the far wake of the medium height roughness element...|$|R
