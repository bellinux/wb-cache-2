40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} {{qualitative}} methodology {{for assessing the}} risk to linear facilities from proposed upslope <b>forestry</b> <b>developments</b> (timber harvesting and road construction). The methodology {{is based on the}} Forest Practices Code of British Columbia guidelines for carrying out terrain stability field assessments, but modified to explicitly assess risks to downslope linear facilities. Examples illustrate how the methodology was used as a tool for communication between Canadian National Railway and forest managers. The authors postulate that the methodology discussed in this paper is applicable to manage the potential risk from <b>forestry</b> <b>developments</b> to other linear facilities such as pipelines, transmission facilities, and roads...|$|R

25|$|Currently, the Honduran Corporation for <b>Forestry</b> <b>Development</b> {{with the}} help of the Honduran Public Safety Force polices the reserve, hoping to {{decrease}} the number of people who invade. Regardless of their efforts, refugees continue to enter. The reservation considered a plan to relocate refugees outside the reserve, creating both an increased buffer and reducing the stress within the reserve. This plan was met with political opposition.|$|E
25|$|The {{value and}} {{utility of the}} WFC rests also in the {{opportunity}} it offers to the world foresters and sectoral decisions-makers to analyse and expose their technical convictions and experiences, to discuss and exchange ideas and thinking, and to broaden their perspectives by sharing their common as well as diverse problems. This is particularly true today, as <b>forestry</b> <b>development</b> {{is becoming more and}} more a topic with international linkages and implications.|$|E

25|$|In the 1970s, India {{declared}} its long-term strategy for <b>forestry</b> <b>development</b> to compose of three major objectives: to reduce soil erosion and flooding; {{to supply the}} growing needs of the domestic wood products industries; and to supply {{the needs of the}} rural population for fuelwood, fodder, small timber, and miscellaneous forest produce. To achieve these objectives, the National Commission on Agriculture in 1976 recommended the reorganisation of state forestry departments and advocated the concept of social forestry. The commission itself worked on the first two objectives, emphasising traditional forestry and wildlife activities; in pursuit of the third objective, the commission recommended the establishment of a new kind of unit to develop community forests. Following the leads of Gujarat and Uttar Pradesh, a number of other states also established community-based forestry agencies that emphasized programmes on farm forestry, timber management, extension forestry, reforestation of degraded forests, and use of forests for recreational purposes.|$|E
25|$|The Congress {{believes}} that the Plan of Action formulated by the United Nations Conference on the Human Environment at Stockholm in 1972 will influence <b>forestry</b> <b>development</b> throughout {{the world in the}} years to come. Recognizing that in many countries declared forest policies are not in accord with new knowledge, new preoccupations and new aspirations, the Congress considers it is now urgent to redefine forest policies in view of these new circumstances. The Congress firmly {{believes that}}, whatever the political objectives, whatever the form of economic organization, whatever the present pattern of forest land tenure, governments are responsible for planning the continuous flow of the productive, protective and social goods and services from the forest, ensuring that the physical output and environmental benefits of the forests are available for the general welfare of their peoples now and for all time. Since we live in one world, and since the forest resources of the world are unevenly distributed, national policies and plans must take account of the international context.|$|E
