500|$|When {{asked if}} the 1995 thriller film Seven was an {{inspiration}} to Saw, Whannell said [...] "For me as the writer, definitely. I mean, Seven is just a very well constructed film, and if you're writing a thriller, it can't hurt to study it. In terms of the story though, James and I never really felt Seven was that close to our film. I <b>guess</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> stand back, you have two detectives chasing a psychopath, who uses vile methods to teach people lessons, and those points echo Seven. What we always liked about Saw, though, {{was the fact that}} the story is told from the point of view of two of the psychopath's victims, instead of the police chasing after him, as you so often see." [...] Entertainment Weekly Owen Gleiberman compared the plot to Seven saying, [...] "In a blatant imitation of Seven, Saw features a lunatic sadist whose ghoulish crimes are meant, in each case, to mirror the sins of his victims. The twist here is that the psycho doesn't do the killing." [...] Richard J. Leskosky of Champaign-Urbana's The News-Gazette said [...] "Saw wants to be taken as another Seven. Though it features perverse gross-out scenes and a villain with a superficially pedantic motive behind his crimes (his victims, if they survive, have learned to appreciate life more), it lacks the finesse and polish of the David Fincher film." ...|$|E
2500|$|Previewing Battletoads in Battlemaniacs, GamePro {{praised the}} series' [...] "cartoony, bizarre, radical style" [...] {{and how the}} [...] "gorgeous {{character}} sprites endow the 'Toads and their foes with personality and attitude," [...] noting [...] "the Dark Queen definitely has more hex appeal than ever." [...] Alex Langley of Arcade Sushi called the Dark Queen the [...] "breakdown character", noting that [...] "in a time where princesses and queens were there to be kidnapped, the Dark Queen turned the depiction of video game matriarchy on its head and boldly declared that shed be the one doing the kidnapping." [...] Complex noted that [...] "where the TMNT had April O'Neil to flirt with, the most bodacious chick in the Battletoads universe is ironically the final boss who wants them all dead." [...] According to Charmaine Williams of WhatCulture, actually [...] "the only thing [...] had going for it was the sexy Dark Queen. I <b>guess</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> think your show wont live to see a full season, might has well have a character with big boobs that lives in a penis shaped castle." [...] Rare Gamer included the Dark Queen in their lists of [...] "Top 5 Classic Rare Villains Who Just Didn't Know When To Quit" [...] and [...] "Top 5 Rare Femme Fatales (That Would Have Us Switching Sides)". Raze described her as [...] "one bitch who deserves to die" [...] and the original game's ending where the Battletoads [...] "simply just allow her to escape" [...] was included on the 2010 list of ten biggest ending letdowns in video game history by Danny Gallagher of SPIKE. Requesting an 'awesome remake" [...] of Battletoads, Brian Cullen of Maxim wrote that [...] "we would rain hot, repressed justice all over our consoles, just {{for a chance to}} hate-fight the foxy, infuriating Dark Queen;" [...] Sean Velasco, lead designer of 2012's Double Dragon remake Double Dragon Neon, said: [...] "I wanna high five Zitz and punch the Dark Queen in the gut!" [...] Alternatively, Gaming Nexus' Cyril Lachel stated: [...] "Forget reviving the Battletoads, all I want is a game based on the Dark Queen!" ...|$|E

500|$|Sheila Benson, {{writing for}} the Los Angeles Times, stated, [...] "Intelligent, complex and enthralling, Presumed Innocent ... {{is one of those}} rare films where all the players seem to be in a state of grace, where the working of the {{machinery}} never shows and after it's over, one runs and reruns its intricacies with a profound sense of satisfaction." [...] Peter Travers, writing for Rolling Stone, called the film [...] "a smart, passionate, steadily engrossing thriller". Janet Maslin of The New York Times praised Pakula's direction, writing, [...] "Pakula has directed an intense, enveloping, gratifyingly thorough screen adaptation of Mr. Turow's story." [...] Film critic Jonathan Rosenbaum wrote that film was [...] "a top-notch courtroom drama that will keep <b>you</b> <b>guessing</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> haven't read the book; even <b>if</b> <b>you</b> have, it is still a very well crafted story." [...] Variety magazine praised the performances, writing, [...] "Ford, in a very mature, subtle, lowkey performance, pulls off the difficult feat of making it impossible to be sure. Bedelia is wondrously controlled, and Scacchi, sans any hint of a European accent, is convincing and seductive." [...] Gene Siskel of the Chicago Tribune praised the supporting cast, writing, [...] "Raul Julia is excellent as Ford's sinister defense attorney. John Spencer, Joe Grifasi, Tom Mardirosian and Sab Shimono are each compelling as investigator, political lackey, prosecutor and coroner." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Huh!" [...] exclaimed Jenny Wren. [...] "I don't {{believe it}} was politeness at all.
