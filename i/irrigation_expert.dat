At present it would be almost impossible to describe {{such a thing as}} a typical engineer, to predicate any universally applicable characteristic of the engineer and mechanic. The black-faced, oily man one figures emerging from the engine-room serves well enough, until one recalls the sanitary engineer with his additions of crockery and plumbing, the electrical engineer with his little tests and wires, the mining engineer, the railway maker, the motor builder, and the <b>irrigation</b> <b>expert.</b> Even if we take some specific branch of all this huge mass of new employment the coming of mechanism has brought with it, we still find an undigested miscellany. Consider the rude levy that is engaged in supplying and repairing the world's new need of bicycles! Wheelwrights, watchmakers, blacksmiths, music-dealers, drapers, sewing-machine repairers, smart errand boys, ironmongers, individuals from all the older aspects of engineering, have been caught up by the new development, are all now, with a more or less inadequate knowledge and training, working in the new service. But is it likely that this will remain a rude levy? From all these varied people the world requires certain things, and a failure to obtain them involves, sooner or later, in this competitive creation, an individual replacement and a push towards the abyss. The very lowest of them must understand the machine they contribute to make and repair, and not only is it a fairly complex machine in itself, but it is found in several types and patterns, and so far it has altered, and promises still to alter, steadily, by improvements in this part and that. No limited stock-in-trade of knowledge, such as suffices for a joiner or an ostler, will serve. They must keep on mastering new points, new aspects, they must be intelligent and adaptable, they must get a grasp of that permanent something that lies behind the changing immediate practice. In other words, they will have to be educated rather than trained after the fashion of the old craftsman. Just now this body of irregulars is threatened by the coming of the motors. The motors promise new difficulties, new rewards, and new competition. It is an ill look-out for the cycle mechanic who is not prepared to tackle the new problems that will arise. For all this next century this particular body of mechanics will be picking up new recruits and eliminating the incompetent and the rule-of-thumb sage. Can it fail, as the years pass, to develop certain general characters, to become so far homogeneous as to be generally conscious of the need of a scientific education, at any rate in mechanical and chemical matters, and to possess, down to its very lowest ranks and orders, a common fund of intellectual training? ...|$|E

40|$|Summary This thesis {{documents}} my {{attempt to}} study masculinities among irrigation engineers and water professionals in Nepal. It {{is based on}} the recognition that more than two decades of mainstreaming gender in development research and policy have failed {{to come to grips with}} the masculine subject. In this thesis, it is hypothesized that there is something intrinsically masculine about the irrigation and water management profession, both in the West and in Nepal. This hypothesis is based on personal experience, being a male researcher myself and being trained as an irrigation professional in the Netherlands, and having travelled to India and Nepal to meet irrigation engineers and water professionals in an intercultural context. The hypothesis is also based on academic questioning of masculinities in irrigation. The aim of the thesis is to scrutinize a taken-for-granted association of men with organisational power, authority and expertise in irrigation. To facilitate investigations, two domains in the world of irrigation are conceptualized: the domain of the irrigation professional and the domain of <b>irrigation</b> <b>expert</b> knowledge. For each of these domains, a set of research questions has been formulated. First, how does one become an irrigation engineer in Nepal, employed in the Department of Irrigation, and what masculinities might be involved in becoming one; and second, how might masculinities be implicated in irrigation knowledge and water expert thinking. To answer the first question, this thesis analyses the institutions of engineering education, professional associations and regulatory bodies, and the Department of Irrigation. To answer the second question, this thesis analyses the use and presentation of irrigation data in policy making and it examines histories of <b>irrigation</b> <b>expert</b> thinking in Nepal. The conceptual backbone of the thesis is to see professional performance in irrigation as cultural performance, drawing inspiration from the work of Victor Turner in particular. In Chapter 1, I explain that he metaphor of performance can be read as technical performance and cultural performance, and is conceived in this thesis as two sides of the same coin, mutually constituting professional performance. In the process of research, I have come to see the concept of cultural performance as particularly apt for this thesis. It has enabled me to conceptualize linkages between the gender of engineers, professional cultures in irrigation and technical representations in irrigation knowledge, without having to exclude myself from the writing process. The latter is important in research on masculinities because identifications of masculinities and femininities are unavoidably interpretative, situated and partial. Chapter 2 presents historical contexts of irrigation development in Nepal, highlighting the main state interventions in the sector and some of the changes in professional practice in irrigation. It also presents a background on the education system and the civil service in Nepal from the 1950 s onwards, highlighting gendered aspects of these institutions and revealing that they have functioned as closed institutions of the high-class, upper-caste elite in Nepal. It also documents a history of women professionals in rural development in Nepal from the 1950 s onwards, in an attempt to understand why there are so few female irrigation engineers in the Department of Irrigation. In this account, I briefly re-visit the introduction of ‘social organisers’ in irrigation in the early 1990 s in an attempt to figure out why social organiser positions were not taken up by women professionals as community specialists. The analysis reveals that the position of women professionals, from the 1950 s onwards, has been defined in terms of their ‘feminine capacity’ to deal with ‘women’s issues’, marked by their non-involvement in broader issues of development. Chapter 3 presents feminist histories of the main institutions that constitute the roadway for becoming an irrigation engineer in Nepal. The first institution is engineering education, focussing on Nepal but also mentioning the places abroad (mainly in India) where Nepalese men (and some women) have gone for engineering education. The focus is mainly on diploma (overseer) and bachelor (engineer) level education in the disciplines of civil – and agricultural engineering. For these disciplines, I have collected gender and caste segregated enrolment data of students at engineering colleges in Nepal (going back to the 1980 s). A second set of institutions are the regulatory organisations for the engineering profession in Nepal and the professional associations that exist in relation to the field of engineering, water, agriculture and irrigation. It presents an analysis of about 40 professional associations and also discusses some of the incipient networks of women professionals in natural resources management. The third institution is the Department of Irrigation, describing its history from 1952 onwards (year of establishment) and presenting an analysis on who is employed in the organisation. The analysis of the institutions reveals that they mainly have been the world of men. Chapter 4 focusses on the informal milieu in the Department of Irrigation to understand how one becomes a ‘real’ irrigation engineer. The analysis {{is based on the}} assumption that getting an engineering degree, and becoming a member of an engineering association and securing employment in the civil service of the Department of Irrigation, does not automatically make a person a ‘real’ irrigation engineer. It is hypothesized that junior engineers need to participate in the informal milieu of the institutions, develop agency and acquire the desire, skills and perceptions that ‘fit’ a normative and gender authentic performance of a ‘real’ irrigation engineer. The development of agency and desire is conceptualized to occur through two distinct yet interrelated processes, which I call ‘self-normalization’ and ‘transitional performance’. The analysis reveals that the informal milieu of the Department of Irrigation is infiltrated with social stereotypes and cultural norms that prevail in (elite) society in Nepal, causing barriers, particularly for women, to perform as ‘real’ irrigation engineers. The analysis also identifies two periods in the lives of engineers that can be conceived as rites of passage for becoming an irrigation engineer: ‘the college’ and ‘the field’. It is suggested that participation in these rites of passage is a pre-requisite to become a ‘real’ irrigation engineer. Chapter 5 discusses the performance of women engineers and ‘other men’ in the Department of Irrigation. Other men are conceptualized as a broad category of men, from professionals with a disciplinary background other than engineering to men of ‘low caste’ and men with a particular ethnic background. The analysis focusses, however, mainly on the performance of ‘lady engineers’ as women engineers in the Department are known. Their marginalized position in the organisation is highly visible whereas subordinated positions of men in the Department are more difficult to detect. Apart from the presence of (male) Madhesi officers, class, caste and ethnic issues among men are difficult to understand ‘within’ the Department, because staff with a Dalit background, for instance, constitute only 2 % of staff in lower management positions in the organisation. The taboo for women to perform in the field is discussed in relation to the performance of the lady engineer. Also an overview is presented of the disadvantages that lady engineers tend to accumulate in the pursuit of a career in the Department. The analysis reveals that most women engineers come to face a career plateau in their life, causing them to accept office work that is considered of secondary importance, switch jobs or quit service altogether. Chapter 6 analyses the performativity of irrigation data and their use in policy making in Nepal. In the recognition that technical representations of reality help to enact professional credibility and claims of truths of irrigation engineers and water professionals, the focus is on understanding how irrigation data might support (and help to enact) professional performance in irrigation. It is analysed how irrigation data breathe life into particular representations of reality, reflecting and structuring a particular experience in <b>irrigation</b> <b>expert</b> thinking. It is suggested that the ‘show’ of irrigation data can also be considered a ‘cultural expression’ of authority, professional identities and masculinities in irrigation. This is not to say that women professionals in irrigation would use and construct irrigation data in a different way, but to point out that authority ‘sticks’ more easily to male engineers when they use irrigation data, than to female engineers when they use irrigation data. Chapter 7 presents a self-portrait of ‘our knowledges’ in irrigation. Speaking about ‘our knowledges’ in irrigation – something that is deeply contentious from a feminist perspective – is done as a way to acknowledge my subjectivation as an irrigation professional and to invite fellow members of knowledge and policy elites in development to participate in an exercise of self-discovery. I reconstruct a history of <b>irrigation</b> <b>expert</b> thinking in Nepal based on 60 years of state irrigation interventions in Chitwan District (1950 - 2010). It is an explorative study, rich in empirical material, also presenting a fresh look at irrigation practices in Chitwan before the 1950 s and re-constructing an account of how images of the Tennessee Valley Authority in America served to conceptualize multipurpose watershed management and new irrigation projects in Nepal. Through the use of photos, I also show how engineers have acted as negotiators of knowledge and masculinities in the act of building irrigation systems in Chitwan District. The investigation is based on the assumption that it is worthwhile to scrutinize our expert knowledges in irrigation because our performances and identities of ‘ourselves’ – as male and female engineers and professionals – are somehow implicated in it. Treating the historical account as a self-referential experience or self-portrait of professional performances in irrigation, I explore how masculinities have been associated with our expert knowledges. The analysis is also an account of professional performance and practices of masculinities that I have negotiated (and performed) myself, in the act of doing research in irrigation on masculinities. In the last chapter (general discussion and conclusions), I conclude that masculinities are deeply embedded in professional cultures in irrigation – not just in interactions between irrigation engineers and water professionals but also in our knowledges in irrigation. Professional performances and expert knowledges in irrigation are an enactment of ‘projectness’ – a particular experience of reality (in projects) which reflects and structures ‘our’ understandings of the world in a gendered way, and in which ‘we’ hardly have been able to date to accommodate feminist perspectives on irrigation and water management. I also point out that qualifying behaviour or practices of people as (partially) masculine or as an effect of masculinities is controversial among irrigation engineers and water professionals. Irrigation and water management historically is a field of applied engineering, and the argument that masculinities are implicated in professional identities and in <b>irrigation</b> <b>expert</b> knowledge, is disputed. Irrigation engineers and water professionals generally have internalized a conviction that science and engineering is rational and universal, and they propagate the view that engineering itself is disconnected from meanings of masculinity and femininity...|$|E

40|$|The way {{to higher}} yields is through irrigation, some experts say. Others claim {{it lies in}} more {{efficient}} rainfed agriculture. After all, irrigation is a thirsty consumer. As a general rule it takes 1000 litres of water to produce 1 kg of food. Water for plants is like fuel for transport: scarce and expensive. What matters is who owns it, who drives it, and who decides where to go. Everybody knows it. Irrigation, which comes {{in all shapes and}} sizes, can double farm output. Even low-input irrigation is more productive than high-input rainfed agriculture. Using irrigation, farmers can grow two or three crops annually; even in areas where it rains sufficiently, they irrigate to grow an extra crop, produce fruits and vegetables, or cultivate rice, the biggest water guzzler of all. Future increases in ACP food production may come largely from irrigated areas. Today they are small: 3. 5 % in central Africa and 8 % in southern Africa, compared with 37 % in all Asia. How much they will grow in ouput depends more on man than the weather. If you own a piece of land, an inexhaustible source of water, and the money and know-how to combine them, you are a well-blessed farmer. But access to all four is a problem for smallholder farmers, and more so for women than for men. The search for solutions Irrigation water mostly comes from common sources like rivers and lakes, which require some degree of regulation and an infrastructure to bring the water to the fields and to distribute it among users. In the past, parastatal irrigation bureaucracies were established throughout Africa to design and run both large- and small-scale irrigation systems. Many systems did not perform well in economic and social terms, due to poor operation and maintenance, unequal water distribution, and low water-use efficiencies arising from seepage and delivery of the wrong quantities at the wrong time. Furthermore, soil salinity linked to irrigation and drainage is a serious problem all across sub-Saharan Africa. Irrigation development was held back by the failure of governments to recognise traditional common property systems of water management. While family, land, and water rights are often determined and administered at village level, most irrigation schemes are managed by governments, which enforce rigid land and water regulations and may ignore the realities of social organisation in rural Africa. The search for solutions has come a long way, passing through several paradigms. During the 1950 s and 1960 s, there was a strong belief in technocratic innovations. After all, technically, anything is possible: automated distribution devices in canals, sprinkler or central pivot systems, drip or strip irrigation. But the human factor should not be forgotten. From the 1970 s onwards, the focus has shifted to user participation and the irrigation world has now realised the need to reform irrigation management if performance is to be improved. In a related development following cutbacks in public expenditure in the 1980 s, irrigation agencies have started to hand over operation and maintenance of the systems to water users. The debate continues, but it is now widely accepted that it is best to give those who actually use irrigation water the power to plan and manage their own supplies at local level using, of course, the most efficient and sustainable technologies available. Associations of water users are being set up everywhere to assume this responsibility, but they may not always be able to take over full managerial responsibilities immediately, nor do they have the required funds to operate and maintain their schemes. It might work for some, but it won t work for all Photo Holt Studios/Sunset People, or governments? Most African countries intend to improve and expand irrigation but lack both the means and concrete policies for implementation. Various ACP governments, like Jamaica, Zimbabwe, and Kenya, have launched transition periods with support and training programmes to prepare water users for the time when the government pulls out. But there are also many cases of irrigation communities who carry on business as usual or decide to develop their own schemes, with or without support. Dessalegn Rahmato, manager of the Forum for Social Studies in Ethiopia, has reported widely on local successful management systems in north Shoa, Wollo, and east Gojjam, which prove the ability of farmers to organise themselves and manage irrigation systems. Conrad Zawe, an <b>irrigation</b> <b>expert</b> from Zimbabwe, applauds the way farmers organise savings clubs to pay for electricity to operate irrigation pumps, a communication system like a communal phone or mailbag, or for contracting technicians for specialised jobs. As long as watering of crops is profitable, people and governments will always be keen to irrigate. 'Water limitations [] will force them to be more efficient', says Jean-Marc Faurès, water resource officer at FAO. 'There are regional and local problems and differences, which need regional and local solutions, but if the question is: do we have enough water to feed the world, the answer is yes.

Preliminary {{information}} on urban runoff from selected small watersheds in the Tucson area indicates that average annual runoff from the urbanized areas {{is more than}} four times as much as that of a comparable undeveloped desert area, and may be ten times as much in some individual years. The urban runoff contains relatively high concentrations of bacterial loading and dissolved organics; although it is not now known to be a seriously hazardous source of pollutants in ground water, urban runoff should be monitored with increasing urban growth, especially for content of organics, microorganisms, and trace metals. Additional study also should be given to the travel-time regime of runoff from the small tributary urban watershed to the major stream channels where recharge mainly occurs. Deep percolation from irrigation return flows was evaluated during a one -year study for the U. S. Geological Survey's "Southwest Alluvial Basin, Regional Aquifer System Assessment Program". Objectives of the study included (1) identifying sources of recharge information, (2) collecting and summarizing available recharge information, (3) identifying methods for interbasin transference of recharge values, (4) characterizing deep percolation models, and (5) itemizing methods for overcoming data gaps.
