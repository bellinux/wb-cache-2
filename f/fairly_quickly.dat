According to that system, the NNs are used to classify without consulting a domain expert; hence, this automation helped to detect both known and novel intrusions.

5|$|After {{attaining}} typhoon status, Paka strengthened <b>fairly</b> <b>quickly,</b> and by December 12 {{it reached}} sustained winds of 150km/h (90mph) for a ten-minute (10 min) duration, or 215km/h (135mph) over a one-minute (1 min) duration. Subsequently, it briefly weakened as its forward motion increased. However, Paka again re-intensified, and at 1200UTC on December 14 it attained the unofficial ranking of super typhoon status while over the open Pacific Ocean. At the same time, the JMA classified it with 10 min sustained winds of 175km/h (110mph). After reaching its initial peak intensity, Typhoon Paka began to weaken as it approached the southern Mariana Islands; the NEXRAD Doppler weather radar from Guam revealed {{the presence of}} a primary eyewall of 74km (46mi) in diameter, with a fragmented inner wall cloud of 19km (11mi) in diameter. Additionally, satellite imagery indicated an eyewall mesovortex within the eye of the typhoon. It slowed and began to re-intensify as it continued westward, and at 0530UTC on December 16 the northern portion of the outer eyewall of Paka passed over the island of Rota; 20minutes later, the southern portion of the inner wall cloud moved across northern Guam. As it tracked through the Rota Channel, the center of Paka passed about 8km (5mi) north of the northern tip of Guam, its closest approach to the island.|$|E
5|$|Once in the environment, {{neptunium}} generally oxidizes <b>fairly</b> <b>quickly,</b> {{usually to}} the +4 or +5 state. Regardless of its oxidation state, the element exhibits {{a much greater}} mobility than the other actinides, largely due to its ability to readily form aqueous solutions with various other elements. In one study comparing the diffusion rates of neptunium(V), plutonium(IV), and americium(III) in sandstone and limestone, neptunium penetrated more than ten times {{as well as the}} other elements. Np(V) will also react efficiently in pH levels greater than 5.5 if there are no carbonates present and in these conditions it has also been observed to readily bond with quartz. It has also been observed to bond well with goethite, ferric oxide colloids, and several clays including kaolinite and smectite. Np(V) does not bond as readily to soil particles in mildly acidic conditions as its fellow actinides americium and curium by nearly an order of magnitude. This behavior enables it to migrate rapidly through the soil while in solution without becoming fixed in place, contributing further to its mobility. Np(V) is also readily absorbed by concrete, which because of the element's radioactivity is a consideration that must be addressed when building nuclear waste storage facilities. When absorbed in concrete, it is reduced to Np(IV) in a relatively short period of time. Np(V) is also reduced by humic acid if it is present on the surface of goethite, hematite, and magnetite. Np(IV) is absorbed efficiently by tuff, granodiorite, and bentonite; although uptake by the latter is most pronounced in mildly acidic conditions. It also exhibits a strong tendency to bind to colloidal particulates, an effect that is enhanced when in soil with a high clay content. The behavior provides an additional aid in the element's observed high mobility.|$|E

40|$|The {{algorithms}} {{described in}} this thesis are designed to schedule cells in a very high-speed, parallel, input-queued crossbar switch. We present several novel scheduling algorithms that we have devised, each aims to match the set of inputs of an input-queued switch to the set of outputs more efficiently, <b>fairly</b> and <b>quickly</b> than existing techniques. In Chapter 2 we present the simplest and fastest of these algorithms: SLIP [...] - a parallel algorithm that uses rotating priority ("round-robin") arbitration. SLIP is simple: it is readily implemented in hardware and can operate at high speed. SLIP has high performance: for uniform i. i. d. Bernoulli arrivals, SLIP is stable for any admissible load, because the arbiters tend to desynchronize. We present analytical results to model this behavior. However, SLIP is not always stable and is not always monotonic: adding more traffic can actually make the algorithm operate more efficiently. We present an approximate analytical model of this behavior. SLIP prevents starvation: all contending inputs are eventually served. We present simulation results, indicating SLIP's performance. We argue that SLIP can be readily implemented for a 32 x 32 switch on a single chip. In Chapter 3 we present i-SLIP, an iterative algorithm that improves upon SLIP by converging on a maximal size match. The performance of i-SLIP improves with up to log 2 N iterations. We show that although it has a longer running time than SLIP, an i-SLIP scheduler is little more complex to implement. In Chapter 4 we describe maximum or maximal weight matching algorithms based on the occupancy of queues, or waiting times of cells. These algorithms are stabl [...] ...|$|R

However, the {{vertebrate}} fauna (169 bird and 31 mammal species) is less diverse than many tropical sites. At least 47 % of bird species and 29 % of mammal species are partially frugivorous. Using data on relative abundance, mass, and degree of frugivory for all frugivorous vertebrates at Crater, we generated a crude "index of importance " for each species. Using the fruit size and mass data from 400 plant species, we exclude fruits either too large or too heavy for each frugivore to disperse, yielding a "possible diet " for each species.

40|$|The world’s nations {{vary widely}} {{in the quality}} of their {{judicial}} systems. In some jurisdictions, the courts resolve commercial disputes <b>quickly,</b> <b>fairly,</b> and economically. In others, they are slow, inefficient, incompetent, biased, or corrupt. These differences are important not just for litigants, but for nations as a whole: effective courts are important for economic development. A natural implication is that countries with underperforming judiciaries should reform their courts. Yet reform is both difficult and slow. Another way to deal with a dysfunctional court system is for litigants from afflicted nations to have their commercial disputes adjudicated in the courts of other nations that have better-functioning judicial systems. We explore here the promise of such extraterritorial litigation and conclude that it is strong, particularly in light of a communications revolution that is making litigation at a distance increasingly feasible. While available data suggests that the volume of extraterritorial litigation is presently small, a set of basic legal reforms could eventually change that situation dramatically. To create incentives for adopting those reforms, it is essential to provide jurisdictions with a strong incentive to attract foreign litigants. The best way to achieve this is to allow jurisdictions to impose higher court fees in cases between foreign litigants that do not have substantial ties to the forum state. This may require an important adjustment in the legal culture. But only by abandoning formal equality in court fees is it likely that real global equality in access to judicial services can be accomplished...|$|R
40|$|The he {{financial}} crisis {{that began in}} 2007 is especially a crisis in debt markets. For example, the stock market peaked in October 2007 with the Dow Jones Industrial Average near 14, 000 and was still near 12, 000 in August 2008. While the Dow Jones eventually fell to 6, 600 by March 2009, most of that fall hap-pened in late 2008. However, problems in debt markets like the mortgage-backed securities market had been in full swing since August of 2007. A full understanding {{of what happened in}} the {{financial crisis}} requires inquiring into the plumbing of debt markets. Trades in debt markets are predominantly made by financial institutions—like banks, hedge funds, and insurance companies—rather than households. One key feature of markets in debt instruments is that whenever a trader wishes to make an investment, it must first raise money, either through a sale of existing financial assets or by borrowing funds from another party.

However with some further development and the technology moving forward I argue that these kinds of tools are the way of the future.
