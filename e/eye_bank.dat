40|$|While {{prevention}} {{is the most}} desirable way to control corneal blindness, once a cornea has lost its transparency, a corneal transplant, or graft, is a patient’s best chance to regain vision in the affected eye(s).

2500|$|Upon {{death or}} removal {{of an eye}} the cornea absorbs the aqueous humor, thickens, and becomes hazy. [...] Transparency can be {{restored}} by putting it in a warm, well-ventilated chamber at 31°C (88°F, the normal temperature), allowing the fluid to leave the cornea and become transparent. [...] The cornea takes in fluid from the aqueous humor and the small blood vessels of the limbus, but a pump ejects the fluid immediately upon entry. [...] When energy is deficient the pump may fail, or works too slowly to compensate, causing swelling. This could arise at death, but a dead eye can {{be placed in a}} warm chamber and the reservoirs of sugar and glycogen can keep the cornea transparent for at least 24 hours. [...] The endothelium controls this pumping action, and as discussed above, damage thereof is more serious, and is a cause of opaqueness and swelling. [...] When damage to the cornea occurs, such as in a viral infection, the collagen used to repair the process is not regularly arranged, leading to an opaque patch (leukoma). [...] When a cornea is needed for transplant, as from an <b>eye</b> <b>bank,</b> the best procedure is to remove the cornea from the eyeball, preventing the cornea from absorbing the aqueous humor.|$|E

A cost-minimization analysis comparing tissue-engineered constructs to donor tissue procured from <b>eye</b> <b>banks</b> for endothelial keratoplasty was performed. Both initial investment costs and recurring costs were considered in the analysis to arrive at a final tissue cost per transplant.

One-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed to simulate various possible scenarios, and to determine the robustness of the results.

40|$|Background. Keratoplasty done by {{experienced}} surgeon is {{the most}} successful transplantation of human tissue. Success rate is over 95 % in noncomplicated cases. Extremely important is follow up. Immediate and proper care can reduce damage to the transplanted tissue and prolong its live time. Endothelial cell density is decreasing with time and also with every rejection episode. After 10 years 35 % of grafts fail and patients have to be regrafted. Conclusions. In young patients the life expectancy is high. The expected lifetime of grafted corneas in PKP (penetrating keratoplasty) is shorter; therefore the DLK (deep lamelar keratoplasty) is surgical procedure of choice in these patients.

40|$|International audienceThe {{determination}} of endothelial cell density (ECD) {{is a crucial}} activity in <b>eye</b> <b>banks</b> {{for the assessment of}} corneal tissue quality. These cells are responsible for corneal transparency, and ECD correlates with graft survival. ECD is mainly assessed with a manual "naked-eye" procedure under a transmitted light microscope in Europe and using a specular microscope in the United States. Interbank and intrabank variability has been previously demonstrated. In order to facilitate training and continuing education of technicians and reliability assessment of eye banks' ECD determination, we use micro-optics technologies to fabricate test mosaics that exactly reproduce the image of human corneal endothelium. The description of the fabrication process is detailed, and comparisons are made between amplitude and phase mosaics...|$|R
