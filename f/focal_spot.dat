25|$|Spherical {{aberration}} {{occurs because}} spherical surfaces {{are not the}} ideal shape for a lens, but {{are by far the}} simplest shape to which glass can be ground and polished, and so are often used. Spherical aberration causes beams parallel to, but distant from, the lens axis to be focused in a slightly different place than beams close to the axis. This manifests itself as a blurring of the image. Lenses in which closer-to-ideal, non-spherical surfaces are used are called aspheric lenses. These were formerly complex to make and often extremely expensive, but advances in technology have greatly reduced the manufacturing cost for such lenses. Spherical aberration can be minimised by carefully choosing the surface curvatures for a particular application. For instance, a plano-convex lens, which is used to focus a collimated beam, produces a sharper <b>focal</b> <b>spot</b> when used with the convex side towards the beam source.|$|E
2500|$|The typical FCS setup {{consists}} of a laser line (wavelengths ranging typically from 405–633nm (cw), and from 690–1100nm (pulsed)), which is reflected into a microscope objective by a dichroic mirror. The laser beam is focused in the sample, which contains fluorescent particles (molecules) in such high dilution, {{that only a few}} are within the <b>focal</b> <b>spot</b> (usually 1–100 molecules in one fL). When the particles cross the focal volume, they fluoresce. This light is collected by the same objective and, because it is red-shifted with respect to the excitation light it passes the dichroic mirror reaching a detector, typically a photomultiplier tube, an avalanche photodiode detector or a superconducting nanowire single-photon detector. [...] The resulting electronic signal can be stored either directly as an intensity versus time trace to be analyzed at a later point, or computed to generate the autocorrelation directly (which requires special acquisition cards). The FCS curve by itself only represents a time-spectrum. Conclusions on physical phenomena have to be extracted from there with appropriate models. The parameters of interest are found after fitting the autocorrelation curve to modeled functional forms.|$|E

5000|$|STED (stimulated {{emission}} depletion microscopy) uses two laser pulses, the excitation pulse for excitation of the fluorophores {{to their}} fluorescent {{state and the}} STED pulse for the de-excitation of fluorophores by means of stimulated emission. In practice, the excitation laser pulse is first applied whereby a STED pulse soon follows (But STED without pulses using continuous wave lasers is also used). Furthermore, the STED pulse is modified {{in such a way}} that it features a zero-intensity spot, which coincides with the excitation <b>focal</b> <b>spot.</b> Due to the non-linear dependence of the stimulated emission rate on the intensity of the STED beam, all the fluorophores around the focal excitation spot will be in their off state (the ground state of the fluorophores). By scanning this <b>focal</b> <b>spot</b> one retrieves the image. The FWHM of the PSF of the excitation <b>focal</b> <b>spot</b> can theoretically be compressed to an arbitrary width by raising the intensity of the STED pulse, according to equation (...) [...]|$|E

Controlling light propagation through such media is therefore challenging. By using a feedback signal, the input wavefront of light can be shaped such that light gets focused through or even inside a scattering medium [Vellekoop et al., Opt. Express 36, 67 (2008) ].

40|$|In the {{experiments}} reported here, the filamentation of ultrashort laser pulses, due to non-optimal choice of focusing geometry and/or electron number density, has a severely deleterious effect on monoenergetic electron beam production in laser wakefield accelerators.

The break-up of the driving pulse results in shorter interaction lengths, compared with larger <b>focal</b> <b>spots,</b> and broad energy-spread electron beams, which are not useful for applications. Filamentation of the pulse occurs because the strongly dynamic focusing (small f-number) of the laser prevents pulse length compression before reaching its minimum spot-size, which results in non-spherical focusing gradients. © 2009 IOP Publishing Ltd...|$|R

50|$|Geometric unsharpness {{is caused}} by aspects of the {{geometry}} of the X-ray beam. Two principal factors play simultaneously: the apparent <b>focal</b> <b>spot</b> size and the ratio between object-film distance (OFD) and focus-film distance (FFD). Fine <b>focal</b> <b>spot</b> sizes will minimise geometric unsharpness, and therefore give more detailed images, but it is often impossible to employ them due to the tube loading necessary in the exposure. Keeping the ratio FFD:OFD high will minimise geometric unsharpness. This is most easily done by keeping the OFD to a minimum, i.e., keeping {{the part of the}} body being X-rayed as close to the detector as possible. If this is not possible however, then increasing FFD beyond the normal 100-110 cm will be necessary to keep the unsharpness level acceptable.|$|E
