40|$|This paper investigates a politician's {{choice for}} state or private control of banks, anticipating how this choice {{influences}} actions by citizens seeking exclusive access to finance. We show that when political accountability is low, politicians prefer control over lending and funneling via state banks. As state banks are less efficient, {{high levels of}} accountability induce private bank ownership. This transition occurs at intermediate levels of accountability when politicians allow private banks to be captured by {{a small group of}} entrepreneurs. These entrepreneurs lend to themselves <b>on</b> <b>preferential</b> <b>terms,</b> inducing a greater chance of bank failure. In an attempt to increase entrepreneurs' losses at default and hence reduce funneling as accountability increases, the politician leaves an increasing share of rents to entrepreneurs. As a result the likelihood of default decreases, but remains positive. Interestingly, the model implies that entry and financial stability are likely to be lowest for intermediate levels of political accountability. We provide suggestive empirical support on bank control and review existing evidence on entry and financial stability...|$|R

40|$|The {{financial}} crisis modified drastically and rapidly the European financial system's political economy, {{with the emergence}} of two competing narratives. First, government agencies are frequently described as being {{at the mercy of the}} financial sector, routinely hijacking political, regulatory and supervisory processes, a trend often referred to as "capture". But alternatively, governments are portrayed as subverting markets and abusing the financial system to their benefit, mainly to secure better financing conditions and allocate credit to the economy <b>on</b> <b>preferential</b> <b>terms,</b> referred to as "financial repression". We take a critical look at this debate in the European context. First, we argue that the relationship between governments and financial systems in Europe cannot be reduced to polar notions of "capture" and "repression", but that channels of pressure and influence between governments and their financial systems have frequently run both ways and fed from each other. Second, we put these issues into an historical perspective and show that the current reconfiguration of Europe's national financial systems is influenced by history but is not a return to past interventionist policies. We conclude by analysing the impact of the reform of the European financial architecture and the design of a European banking union on the configuration of national financial ecosystems...|$|R

40|$|The authors use a firm-level panel {{data set}} from Romania {{to examine whether}} the {{nationality}} of foreign investors affects the degree of vertical spillovers from foreign direct investment. Investors'country of origin may matter for spillovers to domestic producers in upstream sectors (supplying intermediate inputs) in two ways. First, the share of intermediate inputs sourced by multinationals from a host country {{is likely to increase}} with the distance between the host and the source economy. Second, the sourcing pattern is likely to be affected by preferential trade agreements that cover some but not other source economies. In this case, the Association Agreement signed between Romania and the European Union (EU) implies that inputs sourced from the EU are subject to a lower tariff than inputs sourced from America or Asia. Moreover, while for European investors intermediate inputs sourced from home country suppliers comply with the rules of origin and thus can be exported to the EU <b>on</b> <b>preferential</b> <b>terms,</b> this would not be the case for home country suppliers of American or Asian multinationals. Therefore, one would expect that American and Asian investors source more from Romania than EU investors and thus present greater potential for vertical spillovers. The empirical analysis produces evidence in support of the authors'hypothesis. They find a positive association between the presence of American and Asian companies in downstream sectors and the productivity of Romanian firms in the supplying industries. Further, the productivity of Romanian firms in the supplying sectors is negatively correlated with operations of European investors in downstream sectors. The differences between the effects associated with investors of different origin are statistically significant.

40|$|The Caribbean islands {{have long}} been {{associated}} with sun, sea and sand, i. e. a prime vacation destination. Indeed, tourism can be boasted as one of, if not the key economic- growth engines {{for many of the}} islands. Furthermore, {{it has been argued that}} it actually helps to keep the self-employed survive above the poverty line. If this is the case, then it is interesting to know what are the key components that capitalize on the opportunities that tourism provide, and transforms them into economic growth. The island of St. Lucia is a perfect example for such an investigation. In the 2005 Budget address made by the Prime Minister of St. Lucia, Dr. the Honourable Kenny Anthony, to Cabinet asserted that the Government was fully aware of the economic potential of the tourism sector, and as such, has made moves to develop incentives aimed at encouraging investments and on-going advancements within the industry. These moves included loans <b>on</b> <b>preferential</b> <b>terms</b> to entrepreneurs starting up businesses within the range of entertainment, accommodations and the restaurant business. Additionally, since the economy of St. Lucia has been long sustained by agriculture, Dr. Anthony made it a point to clarify that the tourism industry is positioned not to over-throw the agricultural industry, but rather to establish a symbiotic relationship. Indeed, while confirming that tourism holds the greatest potential for growth and development, the Government of St. Lucia has also agreed that unemployment is one of its greatest concerns. If this is the case, it becomes obvious that the tourism sector is the one which, consequently, has the greatest potential to help in reducing unemployment (as well as lifting many persons out of poverty). Noting this, the need for the analyses and discussion is surrounded by investigating ways in which the tourist industry can contribute to the growth of the St. Lucian economy...|$|R
40|$|The June 2003 Horticulture Fact Sheet {{contained}} {{a summary of}} the EU regime for cut flowers. Production of cut flowers and plants in the EU involves about 160, 00 hectares of land, some under glass and protective coverings. The sector is worth around € 16 billion per annum and is growing. Holland accounts for around 30 % of EU production and is a major trader. Germany accounts for 16 %, Italy 15 %, France 14 % and the UK 7 %. The EU regime for cut flowers and plants was established in 1968. It sets quality standards, minimum physical characteristics and marketing standards. There is no EU financial assistance to the sector, no aid to producers, no intervention buying, no price support and no export subsidies. The principal form of regulation is the tariff regime applied and the special safeguard measures allowed. Special arrangements are then negotiated within this framework. The EU is the major market for cut flowers and about 80 % of imports enter the market <b>on</b> <b>preferential</b> <b>terms.</b> Kenya is the main third-country supplier.

40|$|Most {{policy and}} {{research}} interest regarding rural credit markets {{revolves around the}} perception that poor households in developing countries lack access to credit, which {{is believed to have}} negative consequences for household welfare. An important feature of the rural credit market is that access to credit is easier for some groups than for others. The Vietnamese government supplied credit <b>on</b> <b>preferential</b> <b>terms,</b> particularly to rural households, through state-owned financial intermediaries. The share of the informal sector was thus considerably reduced from 78 % (1992 / 93) of all outstanding loans to 54 % (1997 / 98) in favor of the formal sector. However, there is evidence from other developing countries that credit constraints persist despite the expansion of rural finance. Hulme and Mosley (1996) state that there is increasing evidence that the poorest 20 % of the population are excluded from rural credit programs. Thus, even in Vietnam the question remains: did the Vietnamese government succeed in reaching the poor, or do groups of people exist who are still access-constrained? Quantitative (N= 260) and qualitative data collection took place between March 2000 and 2001. The quantitative data comprise cross-sectional household-level data from two different districts in Northern Vietnam. The poverty outreach of formal rural lenders was analyzed using Principal Component Analysis, while access to formal credit was investigated using a binary logit analysis. The poverty outreach of the formal lenders is quite satisfactory since about 50 % of all predominantly poor rural households have access to formal credit. However, the poorest households are seldom clients of formal lenders. Yet, it is not their extreme general poverty that determines their access to formal credit. The results indicate that only certain aspects of poverty, e. g. low quality of housing, have an important influence on access to formal credit in Vietnam. The poorest households simply have much less demand for formal credit. Offering new credit products would only slightly improve the credit coverage of poorer households. More promising would be a specialized pro-poor extension service to widen the scope of their investment ideas and possibilities, combined with general improvement of the infrastructure. All in all, the most appropriate tool to incorporate poorer households into the formal financial system would be mobilization of savings. Nevertheless, the number of access-constrained households is surprisingly low. One reason for the low number is the weakening or eradication of former access constraints. Some access barriers do still exist, e. g. towards ethnic minorities or female-led households. To reduce these access barriers, the actions to be taken should be catering to the specific needs and the circumstances of those households that lack access. Consumer/Household Economics,...|$|R
40|$|Includes bibliographyPopulation, natural {{resources}} and domestic market size have been the traditional components of the equation determining the wealth of nations, according to classical economists. The new lines of research opened up by endogenous growth theories {{and the results of}} comparative statistical studies into the factors determining this growth have reawakened interest in the relationships between scale effects, market size and the role of international trade in the economic growth of small economies. At a time of ever-increasing globalization, these economies are being confronted with a number of challenges and opportunities in relation to which their small economic size is generally regarded as a disadvantage. Diseconomies of scale increase their production costs, while their relatively undiversified exports mean they are extremely vulnerable to shocks of external origin. All these factors weigh all the more heavily in that trade {{has become one of the}} key factors in economic development, as is demonstrated by the sharp increase in imports and exports as a share of GDP since the second half of the 1980 s. The central role played by intraregional trade or the North American market as non-traditional export engines is heightening the importance of price competitiveness, and thus of subsidy or tax exemption programmes to ensure an outlet to these markets. For those small developing countries in the region that suffer relative disadvantages, success would therefore seem to depend <b>on</b> the <b>preferential</b> <b>terms</b> under which they do business with their main developed-world trading partners, namely North America and, for members of the ACP group (the developing countries of Africa, the Caribbean and the Pacific);, the European Union.
