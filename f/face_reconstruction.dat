This paper investigates thoroughly such cascaded regression based 3 D <b>face</b> <b>reconstruction</b> approaches from four perspectives {{that are not}} well studied yet: (i) The impact {{of the number of}} 2 D landmarks; (ii) the impact of the number of 3 D vertices; (iii) the way of using standalone automated landmark detection methods; and (iv) the convergence property. To answer these questions, a simplified cascaded regression based 3 D <b>face</b> <b>reconstruction</b> method is devised, which can be integrated with standalone automated landmark detection methods and reconstruct 3 D face shapes that have the same pose and expression as the input face images, rather than normalized pose and expression. Moreover, an effective training method is proposed by disturbing the automatically detected landmarks. Comprehensive evaluation experiments have been done with comparison to other 3 D <b>face</b> <b>reconstruction</b> methods. The results not only deepen the understanding of cascaded regression based 3 D <b>face</b> <b>reconstruction</b> approaches, but also prove the effectiveness of proposed method.

40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} novel face texture mapping {{framework}} for 3 D <b>face</b> <b>reconstruction</b> {{from a single}} frontal view or half-profile view facial image. <b>Face</b> <b>reconstruction</b> method that originates from the proposed framework, unlike most of the existing ones, is novel {{in the sense that}} it is not tightly coupled to a specific face model, and yet it simplifies the pose estimation problem which is pivotal to the success of <b>face</b> <b>reconstruction.</b> This paper details the proposed framework, and illustrates how it addresses the ill-posed pose estimation problem, of which the solution is optimal in the least square sense. With accurate pose estimation of face, precise texture mapping is thus made possible to allow photo realistic rendering of face images in the 3 D space. Experimental results demonstrates that reliable and photo realistic 3 D <b>face</b> <b>reconstruction</b> can be easily realized in our framework by utilizing a generic 3 D face model, standard Haar-like feature based detector and active appearance model.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a novel method for estimating the three-dimensional shape of faces, facilitating {{the possibility of}} enhanced face recognition. The method involves a combined use of photometric stereo and profile view information. It {{can be divided into}} three principal stages: (1) An initial estimate of the face is obtained using four-source high-speed photometric stereo. (2) The profile is determined from a side-view camera. (3) The facial shape estimation is iteratively refined using the profile until an energy functional is minimised. This final stage, which is the most important contribution of the paper, works by continually deforming the shape estimate so that its profile is exact. An energy is then calculated based on the difference between the raw images and synthetic images generated using the new shape estimate. The surface normals are then adjusted according to energy until convergence. Several real <b>face</b> <b>reconstructions</b> are presented and compared to ground truth. The results clearly demonstrate a significant improvement in accuracy compared to standard photometric stereo...|$|R

40|$|Monocular 3 D facial shape {{reconstruction}} from {{a single}} 2 D facial image has been an active research area due to its wide applications. Inspired {{by the success of}} deep neural networks (DNN), we propose a DNN-based approach for End-to-End 3 D <b>FAce</b> <b>Reconstruction</b> (UH-E 2 FAR) {{from a single}} 2 D image. Different from recent works that reconstruct and refine the 3 D face in an iterative manner using both an RGB image and an initial 3 D facial shape rendering, our DNN model is end-to-end, and thus the complicated 3 D rendering process can be avoided. Moreover, we integrate in the DNN architecture two components, namely a multi-task loss function and a fusion convolutional neural network (CNN) to improve facial expression reconstruction. With the multi-task loss function, 3 D <b>face</b> <b>reconstruction</b> is divided into neutral 3 D facial shape reconstruction and expressive 3 D facial shape reconstruction. The neutral 3 D facial shape is class-specific. Therefore, higher layer features are useful. In comparison, the expressive 3 D facial shape favors lower or intermediate layer features. With the fusion-CNN, features from different intermediate layers are fused and transformed for predicting the 3 D expressive facial shape. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate the superiority of our end-to-end framework in improving the accuracy of 3 D <b>face</b> <b>reconstruction.</b> Comment: Accepted to CVPR 1...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—T 3 D <b>face</b> <b>reconstruction</b> from {{a single}} 2 D image is mathematically ill-posed. However, to solve ill-posed {{problems}} {{in the area of}} computer vision, a variety of methods has been proposed; some of the solutions are to estimate latent information or to apply model based approaches. In this paper, we propose a novel method to reconstruct a 3 D face {{from a single}} 2 D face image based on pose estimation and a deformable model of 3 D face shape. For 3 D <b>face</b> <b>reconstruction</b> from a single 2 D face image, it is the first task to estimate the depth lost by 2 D projection of 3 D faces. Applying the EM algorithm to facial landmarks in a 2 D image, we propose a pose estimation algorithm to infer the pose parameters of rotation, scaling, and translation. After estimating the pose, much denser points are interpolated between the landmark points by a 3 D deformable model and barycentric coordinates. As opposed to previous literature, our method can locate facial feature points automatically in a 2 D facial image. Moreover, we also show that the proposed method for pose estimation can be successfully applied to 3 D <b>face</b> <b>reconstruction.</b> Experiments demonstrate that our approach can produce reliable results for reconstructing photorealistic 3 D faces.

40|$|Face {{alignment}} and 3 D <b>face</b> <b>reconstruction</b> {{are traditionally}} accomplished as separated tasks. By exploring the {{strong correlation between}} 2 D landmarks and 3 D shapes, in contrast, we propose a joint face alignment and 3 D <b>face</b> <b>reconstruction</b> method to simultaneously solve these two problems for 2 D face images of arbitrary poses and expressions. This method, based on a summation model of 3 D face shapes and cascaded regression in 2 D and 3 D face shape spaces, iteratively and alternately applies two cascaded regressors, one for updating 2 D landmarks {{and the other for}} 3 D face shape. The 3 D face shape and the landmarks are correlated via a 3 D-to- 2 D mapping matrix, which is updated in each iteration to refine the location and visibility of 2 D landmarks. Unlike existing methods, the proposed method can fully automatically generate both pose-and-expression-normalized (PEN) and expressive 3 D face shapes and localize both visible and invisible 2 D landmarks. Based on the PEN 3 D face shapes, we devise a method to enhance face recognition accuracy across poses and expressions. Extensive experiments show that the proposed method can achieve the state-of-the-art accuracy in both face alignment and 3 D <b>face</b> <b>reconstruction,</b> and benefit face recognition owing to its reconstructed PEN 3 D face shapes...|$|E

After an initial estimation of shape and low-frequency albedo, we compute a high-frequency partial texture map, without the shading component, of the visible face area. To extract the fine appearance details from this incomplete input, we introduce a multi-scale detail analysis technique based on mid-layer feature correlations extracted from a deep convolutional neural network. We demonstrate that fitting a convex combination of feature correlations from a high-resolution face database can yield a semantically plausible facial detail description of the entire face. A complete and photorealistic texture map can then be synthesized by iteratively optimizing for the reconstructed feature correlations. Using these high-resolution textures and a commercial rendering framework, we can produce high-fidelity 3 D renderings that are visually comparable to those obtained with state-of-the-art multi-view face capture systems.
