40|$|Abstract. In this study, we {{evaluate}} {{the use of}} height for biometric identification of residents, by mounting ultrasonic distance sensors above the doorways in a home. <b>Height</b> <b>sensors</b> are cheap, are convenient for the residents, are simple to install in an existing home, and {{are perceived to be}} less invasive than cameras or microphones. Height is typically only a weak biometric, but we show that it is well suited for identifying among a few residents in the home, and can potentially be improved by using the history of height measurements at multiple doorways in a tracking approach. We evaluate this approach using 20 people in a controlled laboratory environment and by installing in 3 natural, home environments. We combine these results with public anthropometric data sets that contain the heights of residents in 2077 elderly multi-resident homes to conclude that <b>height</b> <b>sensors</b> could potentially achieve at least 95 % identification accuracy in 95 % of elderly homes in the US. ...|$|R

50|$|The current {{westbound}} tunnel from Norfolk to Hampton is {{the original}} tunnel constructed in 1957 and has a lower clearance than the newer eastbound tube built in the 1970s—13 ft as opposed to 14 ft. Because of this, special over-height detectors have been installed near the Willoughby Spit end of the bridge.

40|$|AbstractCorn height {{measured}} manually {{has shown}} promising results {{in improving the}} relationship between active-optical (AO) sensor readings and crop yield. Manual measurement of corn height is not practical in US commercial corn production, so an alternative automatic method must be found in order to capture the benefit of including canopy height into in-season yield estimates and from there into in-season nitrogen (N) fertilizer applications. One existing alternative to measure canopy height is an acoustic <b>height</b> <b>sensor.</b> A commercial acoustic <b>height</b> <b>sensor</b> was utilized in these experiments at two corn growth stages (V 6 and V 12) along with AO sensors. Eight corn N rate sites in North Dakota, USA, were {{used to compare the}} acoustic <b>height</b> <b>sensor</b> as a practical alternative to manual height measurements as an additional parameter to increase the relationship between AO sensor readings and corn yield. Six N treatments, 0, 45, 90, 134, 179, and 224 kgha− 1, were applied before planting in a randomized complete block experimental design with four replications. Height measurement using the acoustic sensor provided an improved yield relationship compared to manual height at all locations. The level of improvement of the relationship between AO readings multiplied by acoustic sensor readings and yield was greater at V 6 growth stage compared to the V 12 growth stage. At V 12, corn height measured manually and with the acoustic sensor multiplied by AO readings provided similar improvement to the relationship with yield compared to relating AO readings alone with yield at most locations. The acoustic <b>height</b> <b>sensor</b> may be useful in increasing the usefulness of AO sensor corn yield prediction algorithms for use in on-the-go in-season N application to corn particularly if the sensor height is normalized within site before combining multiple locations...|$|E
40|$|Geometrical and {{chemical}} {{changes in the}} wear track can cause a drift in friction level. In this paper, chemical and geometrical surface changes in wear tracks are analyzed. For this, a setup with a confocal <b>height</b> <b>sensor</b> was developed to measure the local height changes on the wear track, combined with confocal Raman spectroscopy to determine the chemical changes at the surfaces. Pin-on-disc experiments were performed at room temperature and at elevated temperature (600 °C) to understand the material behavior between mild and severe wear regimes. The wear tracks developing between the two ceramics, alumina (Al 2 O 3) and zirconia (Y-TZP), were analyzed using these techniques. The results of confocal <b>height</b> <b>sensor</b> showed significantly more geometrical changes in surface roughness at 600 °C compared to the test conducted at room temperature. The developed roughness in the wear track was approximately 250 times larger at 600 °C due to the higher degradation of the mechanical properties of ceramic. Further, material transfer was observed for the test conducted at 600 °C using Raman Spectroscopy. Material transfer at room temperature is difficult to observe because surface changes are less evident in mild wear regimes. The {{results show that the}} changes in the micro-geometry of the surface and the chemical compositions of the surface influence the friction level and wear processes.

40|$|Measuring {{precipitation}} {{in mountain}} areas is a demanding task, but essential for hydrological and environmental themes. Especially in small Alpine catchments with short hydrological response, precipitation data with high temporal resolution {{are required for}} {{a better understanding of}} the hydrological cycle. Since most climate/meteorological stations are situated at the easily accessible bottom of valleys, and the few heated rain gauges installed at higher elevation sites are problematic in winter conditions, an accurate quantification of winter (snow) precipitation at high elevations remains difficult. However, there are an increasing number of micro-meteorological stations and snow <b>height</b> <b>sensors</b> at high elevation locations in Alpine catchments. To benefit from data of such stations, an improved approach to estimate solid and liquid precipitation (ESOLIP) is proposed. ESOLIP allows gathering hourly precipitation data throughout the year by using unheated rain gauge data, careful filtering of snow <b>height</b> <b>sensors</b> as well as standard meteorological data (air temperature, relative humidity, global shortwave radiation, wind speed). ESOLIP was validated at a well-equipped test site in Stubai Valley (Tyrol, Austria), comparing results to winter precipitation measured with a snow pillow and a heated rain gauge. The snow height filtering routine and indicators for possible precipitation were tested at a field site in Matsch Valley (South Tyrol, Italy). Results show a good match with measured data because variable snow density is taken into account, which is important when working with freshly fallen snow. Furthermore, the results show the need for accurate filtering of the noise of the snow height signal and they confirm the unreliability of heated rain gauges for estimating winter precipitation. The described improved precipitation estimate ESOLIP at sub-daily time resolution is helpful for precipitation analysis and for several hydrological applications like monitoring systems and rainfall-runoff models...|$|R

40|$|An {{automated}} {{visual inspection}} {{system has been}} developed for use with surface mount devices (SMDs) on {{a printed circuit board}} (PCB). The system is capable of inspecting minute solder joints of fine pitch components as small as 0. 3 mm pitch QFP leads. A solder joint is judged using a height image and an intensity image that are detected by a unique confocal <b>height</b> <b>sensor.</b> A solder joint is classified based on the extracted features of solder fillet shape and correlation between a lead and its pad position. Therefore, accurate recognition of these components from the images is extremely important for reliable inspection. However, the shape of a solder fillet varies greatly, depending on factors such as the soldering process, material of the lead and the solder itself. Furthermore, the <b>height</b> <b>sensor</b> sometimes detects erroneous height data, observed as spike noise caused by insufficient reflection light from the inclined specula surface of a solder fillet. The present authors developed a unique noise reduction algorithm that utilizes a model shape of a solder joint as well as a statistical edge detection algorithm based on highest probability to recognize a solder joint without influence of noise. Each component of a solder joint is recognized by a method customized for the type of it, in order to achieve reliable recognition of various shapes of solder joints. Evaluation of the system confirms that it realizes a 100 % defect detection rate and a very low false alarm rate (0. 16 %).

Issued also on microfiche from Lange Micrographics. The objective {{of this study was to}} develop a chemical application system that could measure plant size, determine the optimum chemical rate to apply and control that application. A plant <b>height</b> <b>sensor,</b> the MEPRT growth relationship software, and the Raven chemical injection system were successfully integrated into a real-time variable rate chemical application system. The <b>height</b> <b>sensor</b> was 45 % accurate in predicting plant heights within +/- 3. 8 cm two weeks after the pinhead square growth stage, but the heights were systematically overestimated by an average of 10. 4 cm at the first white flower growth stage. It could not be determined from the data where the offset originated, but the height trends down the rows were generally tracked. With the Raven application system, the actual carrier flow rate lagged the desired rates. It was later determined that instead of using a 1 -second update rate, a 3 -second update rate would allow the control system to reach the setpoint before a new desired rate was received. A cotton growth regulator (Pix) was applied at uniform and biomass-based variable rates in a replicated study that included two cotton fields. Plant mapping data was collected during the season. Plant heights were significantly shorter in areas that received Pix than areas that did not. The only parameter that showed a statistical difference at the ?=. 05 level was the number of open bolls in Field B, 83 days after emergence. The lack of water for the growing season likely contributed to the lack of significant differences in final yields harvested between the different treatments. Since the yield differences between the treatment and control sections were mostly negative, this translates into financial losses from Pix application for the 2000 growing season. Other advantages can be envisioned from the use of the real-time variable rate system for other chemical applications. The sensor could be used in insecticide applications of fast growing areas of the field, or for nitrogen application based on deficiencies in the plants. This study is only the beginning for numerous possibilities associated with real-time application systems...|$|E

The standard deviation of all laser returns from such a target decreases with lower flying altitude, as well as positional offsets computed tend to increase with flying altitude. The positional error along track is smaller than across track, probably due to different point spacing in these two directions. Target size and reflectance effects are assessed using wooden slats of different widths and colors. The effect of reflectance on target visibility is much larger than the effect of target size, which is in agreement to theoretical findings. Effective footprint size is attempted to be determined by slats with high reflectance forming a star.

A sample is mounted on a spindle that rotates at high speed. A nvCPD sensor detects work-function variations during movement above the sample surface.

A method of correcting road profiles based on the accelerometer and gyroscope data is proposed to eliminate the adverse impacts of vehicle vibration and attitudes change. Because the power spectral density (PSD) of gyro attitudes concentrates in the low frequency band, a method called frequency division is presented to divide the road profiles into two parts: high frequency part and low frequency part. The vibration error of road profiles is corrected by displacement data obtained through two times integration of measured acceleration data. After building the mathematical model between gyro attitudes and road profiles, the gyro attitudes signals are separated from low frequency road profile by the method of sliding block overlap based on correlation analysis. The accuracy and limitations of the system have been analyzed, and its validity has been verified by implementing the system on wheeled equipment for road profiles’ measuring of vehicle testing ground.
