Rather, he wanted to capture the isolation and boredom involved in the minutes and hours after finding a loved one has died, what he termed [...] "the black ashes <b>in</b> <b>your</b> <b>mouth</b> numbness of death". He did not intend to resolve any religious or existential questions about the end of life, but wanted to examine the process in which a person becomes a mere body. Whedon's mother, a teacher, also died of a cerebral aneurysm, and he drew on his own experiences, and those of friends and other writers, in constructing the episode. He tried to achieve an [...] "unlovely physicality" [...] in [...] "The Body" [...] to portray the upsetting minutiae involved in attempting to comprehend what is incomprehensible.|$|E
500|$|Bell {{said that}} at first Anna was written plainer and more general. [...] "In {{the first draft of}} the script she was written more, in my opinion, prissy. She was kind of {{specific}} and very girly," [...] which Bell didn't find appealing. She admitted that she had always {{wanted to be part of}} Disney animated feature, but she [...] "wanted to be a very specific type of princess", who [...] "was way more awkward than the normal princesses", not someone with too good postures or too well-spoken. As she was offered the role of Anna, she came up with a lot of suggestions for the directors. They were responsive and allowed the actress to mould the character the way she wanted, since they wanted the film to be truthful. Bell significantly made specific changes to Anna, including the infusion and incorporation of the actress' own personality to the character, [...] embodying a relatable heroine, which received full support from the directors. She called the scene where Anna first meets Hans is a [...] "typical Disney moment", as they come too close physically and find out that they both fall in love with each other. Bell wanted Anna's words to reflect what she herself would say in real life, which included some [...] "nonsensical rambling". [...] "I think I said, [...] "This is awkward. You're not awkward. Me, I'm awkward. You're gorgeous. Wait—what?" [...] Words just spill out of her mouth too quickly and she has to backtrack." [...] Bell continued. Or the whole scene where she wakes up in the beginning with saliva all over the face, Bell [...] "wanted her to also have hair in her mouth", which took inspiration from her own real life. [...] "Sometimes I wake up like that. Then you have hair <b>in</b> <b>your</b> <b>mouth,</b> and you start coughing. The animators totally got what I was trying to do. It's cool, and way more fun when stuff is realistic like that, instead of the perfection of waking up with mascara on." [...] Anna's snorting and tripping over also drew inspirations from Bell's real life. Bell's recording sessions were also videotaped to assist in animating the character, and animators took into considerations even subtle things like the actress' biting her lip a lot. According to director Jennifer Lee, Anna is a bit flawed.|$|E

Sefer Shel Beinonim analyzes the inner struggle of the individual and the path to resolution. Citing the biblical verse [...] "the matter is very near to you, <b>in</b> <b>your</b> <b>mouth,</b> your heart, to do", the philosophy is based on the notion that the human is not inherently evil; rather, every individual has an inner conflict that is characterized with two different inclinations, the good and the bad.|$|E

The king told the friend that this indicated how much the king loved him, for no one was acquainted with his daughter, yet she waited upon the friend. Similarly, God told Israel that it indicated how beloved Israel was to God, for no being in God’s palace was acquainted with the Torah, yet God entrusted it to Israel.

2500|$|Reading [...] "For this commandment that I command {{you this}} day [...] [...] [...] is very near to you, <b>in</b> <b>your</b> <b>mouth,</b> {{and in your}} heart," [...] a Midrash related the commandments to the human body.

[...] The law is an emollient for a wound, as [...] says, [...] "It shall be health to your navel."

[...] Another Midrash read [...] "For this commandment that I command you this day [...] [...] [...] is very near to you, in your mouth," [...] together with [...] "For they are life to those who find them," [...] to teach that the commandments are life for those who speak them aloud. The Midrash related that a disciple of Rabbi Eliezer ben Jacob used to run through all of his study in a single hour, and when once when he fell ill, he forgot all that he had learned, because he did not speak the words out loud. When, however, Rabbi Eliezer ben Jacob prayed for him, all his learning came back to him. Another Midrash read [...] together with [...] to teach that the commandments are life to those who tell them to others. Another Midrash read [...] together with [...] "For they are life to those who find them," [...] to teach that the commandments are life to those who carry out the commandments completely, for Deuteronomy repeatedly says, [...] "all the commandment" [...] ( [...] , kol ha-mitzvah), which the Midrash taught means until one completely carries out all the precepts.

[...] and they listened to him, for he was their leader. And had Judah called for Joseph's brothers to restore Joseph to their father, they would have listened to him then, as well. Thus because Judah began a precept (the good deed toward Joseph) and did not complete it, he buried his wife and two sons, as [...] reports, [...] "Shua's daughter, the wife of Judah, died," [...] and [...] further reports, [...] "Er and Onan died in the land of Canaan." ...|$|E
