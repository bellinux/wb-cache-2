25|$|At {{his first}} Harvard-Yale Game in 2005, Handsome Dan XVI was briefly stolen {{by a pair}} of Harvard undergraduates, in {{response}} to a Yale student stealing the Harvard flag and running across the field back to the Yale side with it. The two lured him into the Harvard student section of the Yale Bowl as <b>he</b> <b>chewed</b> a toy depicting a Harvard football player.

25|$|Philodendrons {{can contain}} {{as much as}} 0.7% of oxalates {{in the form of}} calcium oxalate {{crystals}} as raphides. The risk of death, if even possible, is extremely low if ingested by an average adult, although its consumption is generally considered unhealthy. In general, the calcium oxalate crystals have a very mild effect on humans, and large quantities have to be consumed for symptoms to even appear. Possible symptoms include increased salivation, a sensation of burning of the mouth, swelling of the tongue, stomatitis, dysphagia, an inability to speak, and edema. Cases of mild dermatitis due to contact with the leaves have also been reported, with symptoms including vesiculation and erythema. The chemical derivatives of alkenyl resorcinol are believed to be responsible for the dermatitis in some people. Contact with philodendron oils or fluids with the eyes have also been known to result in conjunctivitis. Fatal poisonings are extremely rare; one case of an infant eating small quantities of a philodendron resulting in hospitalization and death has been reported. This one case study, however, was found to be inconsistent with the findings from a second study. In this study, 127 cases of children ingesting philodendrons were studied, and they found only one child showed symptoms; a 10-month-old had minor upper lip swelling when <b>he</b> <b>chewed</b> on a philodendron leaf. The study also found the symptoms could subside without treatment and that previously reported cases of severe complications were exaggerated.|$|E
500|$|Alf Clausen, who {{has scored}} {{most of the}} Simpsons music, began {{his work on the}} show with this episode. The first segment, [...] "Bad Dream House", was written by John Swartzwelder and {{directed}} by Wes Archer. The voice of the house was provided by cast member Harry Shearer. Jay Kogen and Wallace Wolodarsky wrote the second segment, [...] "Hungry are the Damned", and Rich Moore directed it. Sam Simon wrote the third segment, [...] "The Raven", and David Silverman directed it. The segment was based on Edgar Allan Poe's 1845 narrative poem [...] "The Raven".
