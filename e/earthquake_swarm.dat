5|$|Even though {{earthquake}} swarms can be dangerous, {{scientists are}} able to model such events to analyze their structure. During the <b>earthquake</b> <b>swarm</b> in 2007, {{a group of scientists}} investigated the possibility that a volcanic eruption would occur. Five additional seismographs were placed in the earthquake zone, and scientists closely monitored the seismic activity. After additional data were gathered, scientists with the United States Geological Survey, the University of Washington, and other organizations, agreed that the Nazko earthquakes probably originated from movement of magma beneath the surface near Nazko Cone. However, because of the number and small size of the Nazko earthquakes, no volcanic eruption is likely. Other recent earthquakes in North America that have been attributed to magma but did not result in a volcanic eruption include the 2003 earthquakes under Lake Tahoe in the U.S. state of California and a 2004 <b>earthquake</b> <b>swarm</b> at Jordan Craters in the U.S. state of Oregon.|$|E

This was probably caused by magma movement near the surface, but there was no surface activity or eruption.|$|E
40|$|The {{spatial and}} {{temporal}} patterns and other characteristics of earthquakes in 34 <b>earthquake</b> <b>swarms</b> on the Mid-Atlantic Ridge were {{compared with those of}} well-studied <b>earthquake</b> <b>swarms</b> which accompany terrestrial volcanic eruptions, to test the assumption that the teleseismically observed <b>earthquake</b> <b>swarms</b> along mid-ocean ridges are indicators of volcanism. Improved resolution of these patterns for the mid-ocean ridge events was achieved by a multiple-event relocation technique. It was found that the teleseismically located <b>earthquake</b> <b>swarms</b> on the mid-ocean ridge system have few features in common with swarms directly associated with active magmatism in terrestrial volcanic rift zones such as Hawaii and Iceland. While the possibility that some of the mid-ocean <b>earthquake</b> <b>swarms</b> might be directly associated with a current episode of eruptive activity on the Mid-Atlantic Ridge cannot be excluded, none of the 34 swarms studied in this work was found to be a conspicuously attractive candidate for such a role...|$|R

5|$|No {{damage or}} {{casualties}} {{resulted from the}} Nazko earthquakes, which were {{too small to be}} felt by people, but local seismographs recorded them.

5|$|A recent calm period, {{with almost}} no {{earthquake}} or magmatic activity at Hualālai, has seen the growth of homes, businesses, and resorts on the mountain's flanks. The most recent major activity at the volcano was in 1929, when an intense <b>earthquake</b> <b>swarm</b> rocked Hualālai, most likely caused by magmatic action near the volcano's peak. Although it has been relatively placid in the recent past, Hualālai is still potentially active, {{and is expected to}} erupt again within the next 100years.|$|E
5|$|Because no seismographs {{were close}} enough to the Nazko swarm zone before the {{earthquakes}} began, employees of Natural Resources Canada placed seismographs in the area to monitor future earthquakes in the area more clearly. An infrasound station is also being established, which is able to measure sound waves that would normally go unnoticed by human hearing. These stations can detect volcanic eruptions and the release of gas at volcanic vents, and can be used in combination with other geophysical data to monitor fluid flow within volcanoes. Employees of Natural Resources Canada have also visited two communities that were adjacent to the 2007–2008 <b>earthquake</b> <b>swarm</b> to renew information about the Nazko swarm, collect samples, and examine some of the more poorly studied volcanic deposits in the Nazko region. The Natural Resources Canada employees also measured carbon dioxide levels during the <b>earthquake</b> <b>swarm.</b> Carbon dioxide is usually discharged at faults in volcanically active areas and can collect in soil and under snow. Because of this, carbon dioxide concentrations can provide information on volcanic activity in the subsurface. The Nazko swarm did not cause any discernible discharge of carbon dioxide, which is normal for non-eruptive events.|$|E

5|$|Before the Nazko <b>{{earthquake}}</b> <b>swarm</b> {{began in}} 2007, the Anahim hotspot {{was not known}} to be an earthquake zone. On October 10 of the following year, a swarm of earthquakes occurred. These earthquakes were normally no more than magnitude 1.0 on the Richter magnitude scale, {{but at least one}} earthquake was as strong as magnitude 3.9. Since the appearance of the Nazko swarm, Natural Resources Canada has expressed interest in the adjacent 7,200‑year‑old Nazko Cone.|$|E
5|$|The {{final two}} weeks of the <b>earthquake</b> <b>swarm</b> were {{observed}} by a quick response cruise launched in August 1996. The National Science Foundation funded an expedition by University of Hawaiʻi scientists, led by Frederick Duennebier, that began investigating the swarm and its origin in August 1996. The scientists' assessment laid the groundwork for many of the expeditions that followed. Follow-up expeditions to Lōʻihi took place, including a series of manned-submersible dives in August and September.|$|E
5|$|At {{least two}} episodes of {{earthquakes}} constitute the Nazko swarm. In the first seismic phase from October 9 to November 1, 2007, {{a total of}} 153 earthquakes took place. During the second seismic phase between September 25, 2007 and June 12, 2008, 4,428 earthquakes occurred. These two seismic episodes were cross-correlated by scientists to understand changes {{in the development of}} the <b>earthquake</b> <b>swarm.</b> Correlation coefficients were around 1.0 for the beginnings of the periods of activity, indicating almost identical situations, and then decayed to around 0.5, indicating a decrease in similarity between the later stages of the two events.|$|E
30|$|It is {{generally}} believed that <b>earthquake</b> <b>swarms</b> {{are caused by}} the migration of crustal fluid (e.g., Nur, 1974). <b>Earthquake</b> <b>swarms</b> sometimes occur in geothermal, or volcanic, areas, e.g., in the Long Valley Caldera of California (Savage and Cockerham, 1984) and the Yellowstone volcanic field of the western United States (Farrell et al., 2009). Hill (1977) proposed a model in which volcanic <b>earthquake</b> <b>swarms</b> are caused by faults arranged according to the local stress field, with magmatic/fluid intrusions in brittle rock. Sibson (1996) suggested a model of swarm activity in which earthquakes are triggered by fluid migration through a highly permeable structure. It is therefore important to investigate crack distribution related to the swarm to understand its occurrence in volcanic areas.|$|R

5|$|For {{three months}} in 1985, 3,000 minor {{earthquakes}} were detected in the northwestern section of the park, during what {{has been referred to}} as an <b>earthquake</b> <b>swarm,</b> and has been attributed to minor subsidence of the Yellowstone caldera. Beginning on April 30, 2007, 16 small earthquakes with magnitudes up to 2.7 occurred in the Yellowstone Caldera for several days. These swarms of earthquakes are common, and there have been 70 such swarms between 1983 and 2008. In December 2008, over 250 earthquakes were measured over a four-day span under Yellowstone Lake, the largest measuring a magnitude of 3.9. In January 2010, more than 250 earthquakes were detected over a two-day period. Seismic activity in Yellowstone National Park continues and is reported hourly by the Earthquake Hazards Program of the U.S. Geological Survey.|$|E
5|$|Lōʻihi Seamount's first {{depiction}} {{on a map}} was on Survey Chart 4115, a bathymetric {{rendering of}} part of Hawaiʻi compiled by the US Coast and Geodetic Survey in 1940. At the time, the seamount was non-notable, being one of many in the region. A large <b>earthquake</b> <b>swarm</b> first brought attention to it in 1952. That same year, geologist Gordon A. MacDonald hypothesized that the seamount was actually an active submarine shield volcano, similar to the two active Hawaiian volcanoes, Mauna Loa and Kīlauea. Macdonald's hypothesis placed the seamount as the newest volcano in the Hawaiian-Emperor seamount chain, created by the Hawaiʻi hotspot. However, because the earthquakes were oriented east–west (the direction of the volcanic fault) {{and there was no}} volcanic tremor in seismometers distant from the seamount, Macdonald attributed the earthquake to faulting rather than a volcanic eruption.|$|E
5|$|Mount St. Helens {{remained}} dormant {{from its}} last {{period of activity}} in the 1840s and 1850s until March 1980. Several small earthquakes, apparently beginning on March 15, indicated that magma may have begun moving below the volcano. On March 20, at 3:45p.m. Pacific Standard Time (all times will be in PST or PDT), a shallow magnitude 4.2 earthquake (the initial reading was 4.1), centered below the volcano's north flank, signaled the volcano's violent return from 123years of hibernation. A gradually building <b>earthquake</b> <b>swarm</b> saturated area seismographs and started to climax at about noon on March 25, reaching peak levels {{in the next two}} days, including an earthquake registering 5.1 on the Richter scale. A total of 174 shocks of magnitude2.6 or greater were recorded during those two days.|$|E

50|$|Examination of {{deposits}} have dated {{the four}} most recent eruptions to two temporal peaks, around 36,000 and 39,000 years ago. The area exhibits small localised <b>earthquake</b> <b>swarms,</b> bradyseism, and release {{of carbon dioxide}} and hydrogen sulfide into the atmosphere. The uplift and <b>earthquake</b> <b>swarms</b> have been interpreted as caused by a slowly growing spherical magma chamber 5-6 kilometres below the surface; some think that it may erupt again; if so, there is risk to Rome, which is only 25 to 30 km away.|$|R

5|$|The 2007–2008 Nazko <b>earthquake</b> <b>swarm</b> {{is one of}} {{numerous}} seismic events that have occurred near volcanoes in British Columbia. Volcanoes that have experienced volcanic earthquakes include Mount Meager (seventeen events), Mount Cayley (four events), Mount Garibaldi (three events), Silverthrone Caldera (two events), Castle Rock (two events), Hoodoo Mountain (eight events), Crow Lagoon (four events), The Volcano (five events), and the Mount Edziza volcanic complex (eight events). Seismic data suggest that these volcanoes still contain active magma chambers, indicating possible future eruptive activity. Although the available data do not allow a clear conclusion, these observations are indications that some of Canada's volcanoes may be active, with significant potential dangers. This seismic activity correlates both with some of Canada's most youthful volcanoes and with long-lived volcanoes {{with a history of}} significant explosive activity, such as Hoodoo Mountain and the Mount Edziza volcanic complex.|$|E

25|$|According to {{historical}} records, an earthquake of magnitude 7 occurred near Bhavnagar in February 1705. <b>Earthquake</b> <b>swarm</b> activity also occurred {{in and around}} Paliyad (60km north of Bhavnagar) during July–August 1938 for about two months, with four earthquakes of magnitude {{greater than or equal}} to 5 and a maximum magnitude of 6.0.|$|E
30|$|Long-term tilt records {{observed}} at each tilt station {{are shown in}} Fig.  2. The <b>earthquake</b> <b>swarms</b> on April 26, 2015 were accompanied by significant changes in tilt. The tilt changes recorded at KZY (northeast direction) and at KOM (northwest direction) {{were similar to those}} observed during the 2001 unrest of Hakone volcano (Itadera and Yoshida 2015) and can presumably be explained by a source model similar to that obtained from the tilt changes during the 2001 unrest (Daita et al. 2009). In the 2015 unrest, remarkable tilt changes were {{observed at}} KZR in mid-May; the timing of these changes coincided with the activation of <b>earthquake</b> <b>swarms</b> around KZR. Based on the seismicity close to other observation sites, Itadera and Yoshida (2015) concluded that such seismicity also coincided with the tilt changes at that station. The difference in the period of high seismicity around each station suggests that not a single but plural pressure sources are responsible for the tilt motion and <b>earthquake</b> <b>swarms.</b>|$|R
30|$|Previous {{studies have}} {{reported}} that crater lake water chemistry changes in response to volcanic activity (e.g., Giggenbach and Glover 1975; Rowe et al. 1992; Christenson 2000; Rouwet et al. 2014). Such changes may be correlated with phreatic eruptions and <b>earthquake</b> <b>swarms</b> and have also been identified at Yugama (Takano and Watanuki 1990; Ossaka et al. 1997; Ohba et al. 2008; Takano et al. 2008). For instance, the Mg/Cl ratio is a good indicator of microearthquake swarms beneath Yugama crater lake (Ohba et al. 2008). In 2014, microearthquakes accompanied by ground deformation were detected at Yugama crater lake. A Mg/Cl value of 0.006 was obtained by a drone on October 18, 2017 (Table  1), corresponding to values measured prior to the microearthquake swarms in 2014, meaning these <b>earthquake</b> <b>swarms</b> in 2014 were not accompanied {{by an increase in}} the Mg/Cl ratio of the lake water. This is similar to the case of the 1989 – 1992 <b>earthquake</b> <b>swarms</b> and was most likely caused by the invasion of groundwater through the breached sealed zone beneath Yugama crater lake (Ohba et al. 2008).|$|R
25|$|A nearly six-month {{period of}} {{relative}} quiet at the volcano ended on December 27, 2009, with renewed <b>earthquake</b> <b>swarms.</b> The AVO subsequently raised the alert level, and again {{warned of the}} possibility of a more vigorous eruption due to dome collapse.|$|R

2500|$|A {{series of}} {{earthquakes}} {{of less than}} magnitude 3.0 were recorded by seismographs in the Baezaeko River region [...] west of Nazko Cone in the Anahim Volcanic Belt on October 9, 2007. The cause of these earthquakes was magma intruding into rock [...] below the surface. Since then more than 1,000small earthquakes have been recorded. Because of {{the small size of}} the <b>earthquake</b> <b>swarms,</b> Natural Resources Canada has added more seismographs in the region for better location and depth accuracy. However, the size and number of the 2007 <b>earthquake</b> <b>swarms</b> indicate there is currently no threat of an eruption. Before magma could erupt in the area adjacent to Nazko Cone, it is expected the size and number of the earthquakes would rise considerably, presaging an eruption.|$|R

30|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to detect temporal changes in the velocity structure of Hakone volcano, where intense <b>earthquake</b> <b>swarms</b> have often occurred. Because various monitoring systems have been installed in and around the volcano, including a dense seismic observation network, geodetic observation networks such as the Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) operated by the Geospatial Information Authority of Japan (GSI), and tiltmeters, detailed information about <b>earthquake</b> <b>swarms</b> and deformation sources can be obtained from the dense seismic and geodetic data provided by these networks. In this study, the relationships between the temporal changes in the velocity structure and other observations, such as seismicity, crustal deformation, and strong ground motions accompanying the volcanic activity, were investigated in detail, and the main factor contributing to the velocity changes is discussed in this paper.|$|R
