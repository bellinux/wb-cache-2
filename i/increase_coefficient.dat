Radio?control system analysis is based usually on microscopic principle. Actual task is macroscopic {{point of view in}} radio?control problem. Problem statement. For radio control problem decision it is necessary to describe the dynamics of process in generalize form. It is possible in conditions when the principal method is macroscopic analysis. In this method it is actual the discount of task fulfillment probability and information quantity. It is necessary to find out the dependence between information quantity, relative error and dynamic characters of systems. Theoretical results. The regularities of task probability fulfillment in radio ? control problem were considered in dependence with control information quantity, information ability and relative error of radio?control system. Time of task fulfillment was determined for radio?control. The influence of speed <b>increase</b> <b>coefficient</b> of task fulfillment was determined.

The proposed regression wavelet analysis (RWA) uses multivariate regression {{to exploit the}} relationships among wavelettransformed components. It builds on our previous nonlinear schemes that estimate each coefficient from neighbor coefficients. Specifically, RWA performs a pyramidal estimation in the wavelet domain, thus reducing the statistical relations in the residuals and {{the energy of the}} representation compared to existing wavelet-based schemes. We propose three regression models to address the issues concerning estimation accuracy, component scalability, and computational complexity. Other suitable regression models could be devised for other goals. RWA is invertible, it allows a reversible integer implementation, and it does not expand the dynamic range. Experimental results over a wide range of sensors, such as AVIRIS, Hyperion, and Infrared Atmospheric Sounding Interferometer, suggest that RWA outperforms not only principal component analysis and wavelets but also the best and most recent coding standard in remote sensing, CCSDS- 123...|$|E

Owing {{to the limited}} accuracy of clinical examination, DCI diagnosis is often based on multimodal monitoring. We examined the value of cerebral microdialysis (CMD) in this setting. METHODS 20 comatose SAH participants underwent CMD monitoring-for hourly sampling of cerebral extracellular lactate/pyruvate ratio (LPR) and glucose-and brain perfusion CT (PCT). Patients were categorised as DCI when PCT (8 ± 3  days after SAH) showed cerebral hypoperfusion, defined as cerebral blood flow 5. 7  s. Clinicians were blinded to CMD data; {{for the purpose of}} the study, only patients who developed cerebral hypoperfusion in anterior and/or middle cerebral arteries were analysed.

The shape factor of skirts has high positive correlation with node number and negative correlation with static drape coefficient of circular fabrics.

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to explore the flux of usable energy and the {{coefficient}} of energy efficiency of an incinerator for medical waste combustion. The incineration facility incorporates a heat recovery system. The installation consists of a loading unit, a combustion chamber, a thermoreactor chamber, and a recovery boiler. The analysis was carried out in the Oncological Hospital in Bydgoszcz (Poland). The primary fuel was comprised of medical waste, with natural gas used as a secondary fuel. The study shows that one can obtain about 660 - 800 Â kW of usable energy from 100 Â kg of medical waste. This amount corresponds to 1000 - 1200 Â kg of saturated steam, assuming that the incinerator operates at a heat load above [phi]Â >Â  65 %. The average heat flux in additional fuel used for incinerating 100 Â kg of waste was 415 Â kW. The coefficient of energy efficiency was set within the range of 47 % and 62 % depending on the incinerator load. The tests revealed that the flux of usable energy and the coefficient of energy efficiency depend on the incinerator load. In the investigated range of the heat load, this dependence is significant. When the heat load of the incinerator increases, the flux of usable energy and the coefficient of energy efficiency also <b>increase.</b> <b>Coefficient</b> of energy efficiency Incinerator Medical wastes Usable energy flux...|$|E

In the proposed formula, the strength of cement-treated soil is given by volumetric solid content, strength <b>increase</b> <b>coefficient</b> due to cement, exponential parameter N representing {{the effect of the}} void structure of soil and cement content in respect to the solid material of soil. The formula was adapted to the results of laboratory strength tests of cement-treated soils made of six dredged marine clays with different levels of initial water content. The strengths estimated by the proposed formula agreed with the measured strengths fairly well, using the parameter N= 3. 5 – 4. 6. The formula was applied to the strength estimate of foam- and bead-treated soils made from dredged marine clay, using the parameter N= 2. 1 – 2. 5. The applicability of the proposed formula was examined with the results of strength tests carried out for the design of cement-treated soil for the construction of D runway at Tokyo’s Haneda Airport. Seven samples collected in the construction sites were mixed with different amounts of cement and the different levels of initial water content. On fitting the proposed formula to the results of all the data, the proposed formula estimates the measured strength well.
