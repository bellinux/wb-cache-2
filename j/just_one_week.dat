50|$|A massive {{setback for}} URE again was the {{collapse}} {{in the summer of}} 2004 of SBN - the Student Broadcast Network - as the sustaining service.

However, in July 2004, SBN's parent company Campus Media ceased its student radio operation at <b>just</b> <b>one</b> <b>weeks</b> notice. URE suffered badly from this cutback, both in loss of revenue, and from the loss of output on air that could not be supplied from automated computer playlists from the studios.|$|R

5|$|Tropical Depression Two was a {{short-lived}} tropical cyclone that impacted portions of Texas and Mexico during the highly active 2010 Atlantic hurricane season.

Upon entering the western Gulf of Mexico, the depression encountered a conducive environment for tropical cyclone development, and was designated Tropical Depression Two at 0600UTC on July8. Intensification into a tropical storm was initially anticipated by the National Hurricane Center (NHC), but due to its proximity to land, the depression failed to attain the status. It made landfall on South Padre Island, Texas before degenerating into a remnant low on July9, and dissipating the following day. Due to the system's weak intensity, there were no reports of damage inflicted by winds across Texas or Mexico, although the cyclone did bring minimal rainfall totals to northern Mexico, an area severely affected by Hurricane Alex <b>just</b> <b>one</b> <b>week</b> previous.|$|E
