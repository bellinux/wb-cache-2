5|$|Cutthroat {{competition}} {{was nothing to}} what was to follow. The 1890s were a tough time for the Romanian economy, and {{a rising tide of}} anti-Semitism made it an even tougher time for the Jews. One quarter of the Jewish population emigrated, with intellectuals particularly likely to leave, and those intellectuals who remained were more <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> <b>politics</b> than in theater: this was a period of social ferment, with Jewish socialists in Iaşi starting Der Veker (The Awakener).|$|E

5|$|Demosthenes grew <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> <b>politics</b> {{during his}} time as a logographer, and in 354BC he gave his first public {{political}} speeches. He went on to devote his most productive years to opposing Macedon's expansion. He idealized his city and strove throughout his life to restore Athens' supremacy and motivate his compatriots against Philip II of Macedon. He sought to preserve his city's freedom and to establish an alliance against Macedon, in an unsuccessful attempt to impede Philip's plans to expand his influence southward by conquering all the other Greek states.|$|E
5|$|Diefenbaker {{was born}} in southwestern Ontario {{in the small town}} of Neustadt, Ontario in 1895. In 1903, his family {{migrated}} west to the portion of the North-West Territories which would shortly thereafter become the province of Saskatchewan. He grew up in the province, and was <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> <b>politics</b> from a young age. After brief service in World War I, Diefenbaker became a noted criminal defence lawyer. He contested elections through the 1920s and 1930s with little success until he was finally elected to the House of Commons in 1940.|$|E
40|$|In this paper, the {{relationships}} between the HEXACO personality model and socio-political attitudes were investigated. It was hypothesized that the relationship between Honesty-Humility and Social Dominance Orientation (SDO) and that between Openness and Right Wing Authoritarianism (RWA) were moderated by <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> <b>politics.</b> Three hundred and forty-four individuals participated in the study. Results showed that Honesty-Humility affected SDO and Openness affected RWA more strongly among individuals with a higher level of <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> <b>politics.</b> Facet-level analyses revealed that Humility and Experiential Openness were uniquely connected to ideology. These effects were also moderated by <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> <b>politics.</b> (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R

5|$|Born in Warsaw and {{following}} in his father's footsteps, he became <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> <b>politics</b> {{at an early}} age and soon became involved in the military and the revolutionary affairs in Poland (the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth). Pulaski was one of the leading military commanders for the Bar Confederation and fought against Russian domination of the Commonwealth. When this uprising failed, he was driven into exile. Following a recommendation by Benjamin Franklin, Pulaski emigrated to North America to help in the cause of the American Revolutionary War. He distinguished himself throughout the revolution, most notably when he saved the life of George Washington. Pulaski became a general in the Continental Army, created the Pulaski Cavalry Legion and reformed the American cavalry as a whole. At the Battle of Savannah, while leading a daring charge against British forces, he was gravely wounded, and died shortly thereafter.|$|E
5|$|Born in {{the north}} of Norway to a fairly {{distinguished}} family, he soon became <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> <b>politics</b> and history. Starting his political career in the Liberal Party, he switched to the Labour Party {{around the turn of the}} 20th century. He represented that party in the Bærum municipal council for parts of the interwar period. He was never elected a member of Parliament, but served nonetheless as Norwegian Minister of Foreign Affairs from 1935 to 1941. In the latter capacity he sought to preserve Norway's neutrality in the Second World War, an action that garnered him political infamy. Growing discontentment with Koht's political decisions ultimately led to his exit from the cabinet. After the war, however, he returned to an academic career track and wrote major works in the 1950s and 1960s.|$|E
5|$|By then, Reitz had {{developed}} {{a keen interest in}} law, and he continued his studies at South African College, reading law with professor F.S. Watermeyer. The latter's death only months after Reitz started working with him, made Reitz decide to continue his studies in London, at the Inner Temple. It was a decision that needed deliberation, as his father was hoping for his son to return to the farm in due time, and the financial situation of the family was not strong. However, Reitz did go to London, and finished his studies successfully. He was called to the bar at Westminster on 11 June 1867. During his time in England Reitz became <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> <b>politics,</b> and regularly attended sessions of the House of Commons. Before returning to South Africa he made a tour of Europe.|$|E
40|$|Scholars {{have long}} deplored voters' lack of <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> <b>politics</b> and argued <b>in</b> favor of greater {{political}} engagement. We present a formal theory of elections where successful communication of campaign messages requires both effort by candidates and attention from voters. Voters' <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> <b>politics</b> affects their attention, and impacts {{the effectiveness of}} the electoral process as a screening and disciplining device. In line with existing theories, there exists a curse of the uninterested voter: When voters have little <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> <b>politics,</b> the electoral process performs poorly, and voters' attention to politics is low. Surprisingly, we uncover a curse of the interested voter, by which the same happens when voters have a strong <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> <b>politics.</b> Our results highlight the importance of distinguishing between voters' interest and attention, two notions often conflated in empirical studies. Moreover, policy interventions aimed at subsidizing the cost of acquiring political information can have unintended consequences...|$|R

5|$|From 1962-70, {{he worked}} as a {{technician}} at the Chester Beatty cancer research laboratory in Fulham, looking after animals used in experimentation. Most of the technicians were socialists, and Livingstone helped found a branch of the Association of Scientific, Technical and Managerial Staffs to fight redundancies imposed by company bosses. Livingstone's leftist views solidified upon the election of Labour Prime Minister Harold Wilson in 1964. With a friend from Chester Beatty, Livingstone toured West Africa in 1966, visiting Algeria, Niger, Nigeria, Lagos, Ghana and Togo. Interested in the region's wildlife, Livingstone rescued an infant ostrich from being eaten, donating it to Lagos children's zoo. Returning home, he took part in several protest marches {{as a part of the}} anti-Vietnam War movement, becoming increasingly <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> <b>politics</b> and briefly subscribing to the publication of a libertarian socialist group, Solidarity.|$|E
5|$|Gandhi {{focused his}} {{attention}} on Indians while in South Africa. He was not <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> <b>politics.</b> This changed after he was discriminated against and bullied, such as by being thrown out of a train coach because of his skin colour by a white train official. After several such incidents with Whites in South Africa, Gandhi's thinking and focus changed, he felt he must resist this and fight for rights. He entered politics by forming Natal Indian Congress. According to Ashwin Desai and Goolam Vahed, Gandhi's views on racism are contentious, in some cases distressing to those who admire him. Gandhi suffered persecution from the beginning in South Africa. Like with other coloured people, white officials denied him his rights, the press {{and those in the}} streets bullied and called him a parasite, semi-barbarous, canker, squalid coolie, yellow man, and other epithets. People would spit on him as an expression of racial hate.|$|E
5|$|The Glebe's {{profits were}} barely enough for Breckinridge's growing family. His legal career {{provided}} {{enough money for}} some comforts but required long hours and difficult work. Patrick Henry regularly represented clients opposite Breckinridge, and John Marshall both referred clients to him {{and asked him to}} represent his own clients in his absence. Though still <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> <b>politics,</b> Breckinridge refused to campaign for the people's support. He believed changes were needed to the Articles of Confederation and agreed with much of the proposed U.S. constitution, but he did not support equal representation of the states in the Senate nor the federal judiciary. Heeding the advice of his brother James and his friend, Archibald Stuart, he did not seek election as a delegate to Virginia's ratification convention.|$|E

5|$|Willis's {{family came}} to Kentucky from Ohio about 1889. After briefly {{working in the}} {{education}} and journalism fields, Willis read law with private tutors and {{was admitted to the}} bar in 1901. He became <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> <b>politics,</b> but his early races for office were unsuccessful with the exception of his four-year stint as city solicitor for Ashland, Kentucky. Finally in 1927, newly elected governor Flem D. Sampson appointed Willis to the Kentucky Court of Appealsthen the court of last resort in the state. Willis went on to win a full four-year term on the court in 1928, and distinguished himself by revising Thornton on the Law of Oil and Gas, a six-volume law reference. He was defeated for re-election to his seat in 1932 and returned to his law practice.|$|E
