5|$|Vanguards {{first task}} after {{completing}} her sea trial {{at the end}} of 1946 was, early the next year, to convey King George VI and his family on the first Royal Tour of South Africa by a reigning monarch. While refitting after her return, she was selected for another Royal Tour of Australia and New Zealand in 1948. This was cancelled due to King George's declining health and Vanguard briefly became flagship of the Mediterranean Fleet in early 1949. After her return home in mid-1949, she became flagship of the Home Fleet Training Squadron. Throughout her career, the battleship usually served as the flagship of any unit to which she was assigned. During the early 1950s, Vanguard was involved in a number of training exercises with NATO forces. In 1953 she participated in Queen Elizabeth II's Coronation Review. While she was refitting in 1955, the Admiralty announced that the ship was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>put</b> into reserve upon completion of the work. Vanguard was sold for scrap and was broken up beginning in 1960.|$|E

Thorne also said she was treated well by the cast, but upon starting, [...] "I was very aware of the fact that it's predominantly men, and I have no problem saying that as a small, dark woman I was terrified.

500|$|For many years, {{very little}} content {{from the game}} was ever {{released}} beyond screenshots that had been released to the media in promotion of the game prior to its cancellation. However, in 2006 {{a copy of a}} very early test engine was sold at auction to an anonymous collector who bought it for US$2500. An animated GIF image of the gameplay was initially released, and the disk image itself was leaked on July 17, 2007 after a fundraising project by the [...] "Assemblergames" [...] website community purchased the disc from the collector. [...] In 2006, Chris Senn opened the [...] "Sonic X-treme Compendium" [...] web site and began revealing large amounts of the game's development history to the public, including videos of early footage, a playable character named Tiara, and a large amount of previously unreleased concept music related to the title. He also was given permission by Hirokazu Yasuhara, the level designer {{for the majority of the}} original 16-bit Sonic titles, to post level designs that were <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>put</b> in the game. Senn, along with the community, announced intentions to recreate the game, but ultimately the project was canceled in January 2010.|$|E

50|$|Hewitt {{admitted}} that he was also influenced by The Running Man (1987). He said the film:Tries to deliver what its target demographic would want.

You know, <b>to</b> ask ‘Why <b>are</b> we actually at war?’ is one theme. Nobody seems <b>to</b> <b>be</b> actually talking about it. Are all these wars going on for the benefits of the countries or are they going on for the benefit of Google through YouTube and CNN and stations like that? Those are making a gazillion dollars. They’re the worst offender. We wanted to speculate on that but put it in the subtext that people also want some sort of stalk and chase thriller could get into it as well.Investment came from a number of sources including Screen Queensland and the Post Lounge, who did visual effects.|$|R

5000|$|In Episode II, Fett saw {{his father}} murdered by Mace Windu, however he's still {{got a long way}} to go before he becomes the {{battered}} bounty hunter we know so well. Aurra's an influence, and not much of a nurturing parental figure - so that plays a part, as well. She preys on his weakness, on his desire for a family. It's pretty dysfunctional, and it sheds an interesting light on both Aurra and Boba. Ultimately, though, Boba's always been a mystery. As much as we reveal, we're not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> take the mystery away from his fans. Not knowing all the answers about Boba is part of what makes him so cool. Dave Filoni, supervising director for The Clone Wars TV series IGN reviewer Eric Goldman rated the first episode 8.2/10 and the second 8.8/10, stating [...] "this was a very layered, exciting episode to end Season 2 on", though he did not appreciate Boba Fett's limited dialogue. Bryan Young, a writer for The Huffington Post and Examiner.com, also disliked Fett's responses at the end of the episode when confronting Mace Windu: [...] "He says something incredibly whiny." [...] Young does state, however, that [...] "overall, this pair of episodes was a satisfying conclusion to season two, which really upped the game in this series in terms of animation, storytelling and suspense." [...] GalacticBinder.com's reviewer Chris Smith wrote, [...] "Lucasfilm delivers another exciting episode to finish off a tremendous second season." [...] Adam Rosenberg writing in MTV Movies Blog discusses Boba Fett's return: [...] "He's <b>going</b> <b>to</b> have <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>put</b> through a lot more hell before he embraces his inner badass. I'll say though... he's off to a mighty good start with the dual blasters he wears on his belt. Sure, they're almost the size of his thighs, but hey... he's still just a kid." ...|$|R
