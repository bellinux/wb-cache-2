Duplicate samples of fecal homogenate, an appropriate standard, and a blank, each in acidic, aqueous alcohol,are extracted with petroleum ether. The extracts are analyzed by the spectrophotometric, acid-dichro-mate oxidation method. The procedure is much briefer and simpler than current gravimetric and titrimetric methods for fecal fat, and a comparative {{study suggests that}} the values obtained are of equal diagnostic value to those obtained by the popular Van de Kamer U. Biol. Chem. 177, 347 (1949) ] method for total fatty acids. Fecal samples from patients with various de-grees of steatorrhea gave results having a linear relationship between total lipidand total fatty acid <b>excretion</b> (<b>coefficient</b> of correlation, 0. 995;regression formula, total lipid = 1. 09 (totalfattyacid) + 3. 4). The slope of near unity indicates that the increased lipid excretion in steatorrhea is almost wholly accounted for by increased triglyceride and fatty acid excretion and that the unsaponifiablefraction remains relatively constant.

To determine the relevance of urinary iron excretion to clinical factors other than iron metabolism, 15 clinical parameters were evaluated. The serum creatinine level was positively and the serum albumin level was negatively correlated with urinary iron <b>excretion,</b> showing <b>coefficients</b> of r＝ 0. 97,－ 0. 86 respectively, and suggesting a relationship between urinary iron excretion and subclinical abnormalities of kidney function. In experimental studies, the relation of urinary iron excretion to the renal function was examined by administration of iron in various forms to rats. Only saccharated iron oxide was excreted; chondroitin sulfate Fe, Tf-Fe and ferric chloride were not excreted in the urine. Then, iron excretion was examined in iron deficient, iron overloaded and puromycin aminonucleoside (PA) -treated animals. Iron deficient rats did not show any change in urinary iron excretion compared to the controls. Urinary iron excretion was increased in iron overloaded rats, and was further increased in the PA-treated group. These findings suggest that the subclinical abnormality in kidney function leads to the increased urinary iron excretion as a possible factor in the pathogenesis of relapsisg iron deficiency...|$|R

40|$|Background: Hyperkalemia {{is one of}} {{the more}} serious {{complications}} of chronic kidney disease (CKD), and the cause of potassium retention is a reduction in urinary potassium excretion. However, few studies have examined the extent of the decrease of urinary potassium excretion in detail with respect to decreased renal function. Methods: Nine hundred eighty-nine patients with CKD (CKD stages G 1 and G 2 combined: 135; G 3 a: 107; G 3 b: 170; G 4 : 289; and G 5 : 288) were evaluated retrospectively. Values for urinary potassium excretion were compared between CKD stages, and the associations between urinary potassium excretion and clinical parameters, including diabetes mellitus status and use of renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system inhibitors, were analyzed using a multivariable linear regression analysis. Results: Urinary potassium excretion gradually decreased with worsening of CKD (G 5 : 24. 8  ±  0. 8  mEq/d, P <  0. 001 vs. earlier CKD stages). In contrast, the value of fractional excretion of potassium at CKD G 5 was significantly higher than that at the other stages (30. 63  ±  0. 93 %, P <  0. 001). Multivariable linear regression analysis revealed that urinary potassium excretion was independently associated with urinary sodium <b>excretion</b> (standardized <b>coefficient,</b> 0. 499), the estimated glomerular filtration rate (0. 281), and serum chloride concentration (– 0. 086). Conclusion: This study demonstrated that urinary potassium excretion decreased with reductions in renal function. Furthermore, urinary potassium excretion was mainly affected by urinary sodium excretion and estimated glomerular filtration rate in patients with CKD, whereas the presence of diabetes mellitus and use of renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system inhibitors were not associated with urinary potassium excretion in this study...|$|R
40|$|CONTEXT:Melatonin is {{involved}} in a variety of diseases, including cancer, insomnia, depression, dementia, hypertension, and diabetes; its secretion is influenced by environmental light. Although daylight exposure increases nocturnal melatonin secretion in a controlled laboratory setting, whether it increases nocturnal melatonin secretion in an uncontrolled daily life setting remains unclear. OBJECTIVE:We aimed to determine the association between daylight exposure in an uncontrolled daily life setting and urinary 6 -sulfatoxymelatonin excretion. DESIGN AND PARTICIPANTS:A cross-sectional study was conducted in 192 elderly individuals (mean age, 69. 9 yr). MEASURES:We measured ambulatory daylight exposure using a wrist light meter in two 48 -h sessions; furthermore, we measured overnight urinary 6 -sulfatoxymelatonin excretion, an index of melatonin secretion, on the second night of each session. RESULTS:The median duration of daylight exposure of at least 1000 lux was 72 min (interquartile range, 37 - 124). Univariate linear regression analysis showed marginal to significant associations between log-transformed urinary 6 -sulfatoxymelatonin excretion and age, current smoking status, benzodiazepine use, day length, log-transformed duration of daylight exposure of at least 1000 lux, and daytime physical activity. In a multivariate model, log-transformed duration of daylight exposure of at least 1000 lux was significantly associated with log-transformed urinary 6 -sulfatoxymelatonin <b>excretion</b> (regression <b>coefficient,</b> 0. 101; 95 % confidence interval, 0. 003 - 0. 199; P = 0. 043). Furthermore, an increase in the duration of daylight exposure of at least 1000 lux from 37 to 124 min (25 th to 75 th percentiles) was associated with a 13. 0 % increase in urinary 6 -sulfatoxymelatonin excretion (6. 8 to 7. 7 μg). CONCLUSIONS:Daylight exposure in an uncontrolled daily life setting is positively associated with urinary 6 -sulfatoxymelatonin excretion in the elderly. 博士（医学）・乙第 1308 号・平成 25 年 3 月 15 日Copyright © 2012 by The Endocrine Societ...|$|R
40|$|Abnormal urinary {{excretion}} of betaine {{has been}} demonstrated in patients with diabetes or metabolic syndrome. We aimed to identify the main predictors of excretion in cardiovascular patients and to make initial assessment of its feasibility as a risk marker of future diabetes development. We used data from 2396 patients participating in the Western Norway B-vitamin Intervention Trial, who delivered urine and blood samples at baseline, and in the majority at two visits during follow-up of median 39 months. Betaine in urine and plasma were measured by liquid-chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. The strongest determinants of urinary betaine excretion by multiple regression were diabetes mellitus, age and estimated glomerular filtration rate; all p, 0. 001. Patients with diabetes mellitus (n = 264) had a median excretion {{more than three times}} higher than those without. We found a distinct non-linear association between urinary betaine excretion and glycated hemoglobin, with a break-point at 6. 5 %, and glycated hemoglobin was the strongest determinant of betaine excretion in patients with diabetes mellitus. The discriminatory power for diabetes mellitus corresponded to an area under the curve by receiver-operating characteristics of 0. 82, and betaine <b>excretion</b> had a <b>coefficient</b> of reliability of 0. 73.

This {{article is}} {{published}} with open access at Springerlink. com Abstract Bioequivalence of rusovastatin in healthy human volunteers was done using saliva and plasma matrices {{in order to}} investigate the robustness of using saliva instead of plasma as a surrogate for bioequivalence of class III drugs according to the salivary excretion clas-sification system (SECS). Saliva and plasma samples were collected for 72 h after oral administration of rusovastatin 40 mg to 12 healthy humans. Saliva and plasma pharma-cokinetic parameters were calculated by non-compart-mental analysis. Analysis of variance, 90 % confidence intervals, and intra-subject and inter-subject variability values of pharmacokinetic parameters were calculated using Kinetica program V 5. Human effective intestinal permeability was also calculated by SimCYP program V 13. Rusovastatin falls into class III (high permeability/ low fraction unbound to plasma proteins) and hence was subjected to salivary <b>excretion.</b> A correlation <b>coefficient</b> of 0. 99 between saliva and plasma concentrations, and a sal-iva/plasma concentration ratio of 0. 175 were observed. The 90 % confidence limits of area under the curve (AUClast) and maximum concentration (Cmax) showed similar trends in both saliva and plasma. On the other hand, inter- and intra-subject variability values in saliva were higher than in plasma, leading {{to the need for}} a slightly higher number of subjects to be used in saliva studies. Non-invasive saliva sampling instead of the invasive plasma sampling method {{can be used as a}} surrogate for bioequivalence of SECS class III drugs when an adequate sample size is used. ...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT This {{research}} {{aimed to}} evaluate enzyme supplementation in diets with different nutritional levels for pigs in their feces excretion and anaerobic digestion. Fifty four gilts {{were placed on}} diets formulated to achieve 100 or 95 or 90 % of a pig's nutrient requirements, {{with the addition of}} an enzyme complex containing amylase, &# 946;-glucanase, cellulase, pectinase, xylanase, protease and phytase (diets 100 E, 95 E and 90 E) or without the enzymes (diets 100, 95 and 90). The trial was divided into three periods (1, 1 - 2 and 1 - 3) based on the animal weight. The enzyme complex reduced (p < 0. 05) excretions per period and per unit of weight gain (residue coefficients) of organic matter (OM) in Period 1, of N, Ca, Zn and Na in Period 1 - 2, and of Na <b>excretions</b> and residue <b>coefficients</b> in Period 1 - 3. Animals fed diet 95 E had lower excretions (p < 0. 05) of dry (DM), organic and mineral matters, N, Ca, Fe, Mn and Cu, and lower residue coefficients (p < 0. 05) of DM, OM, P, Fe, Mn and Cu compared with the animals fed diet 95, in Period 1 - 3. Numerically, the enzyme complex improved biogas and methane production potentials in anaerobic digestion of the feces.

This {{study was conducted to}} compare 2 analytical methodologies (colorimetry and also high-performance liquid chromatography with a refractive index detector) in order to calculate the phytase efficiency by utilizing the results from the methodology that was shown to be the most appropriate. One hundred and twenty broilers were distributed in a (4 + 1) × 2 factorial arrangement, corresponding to 4 diets that were equally deficient in P supplemented with increasing levels of phytase (0, 750, 1, 500, and 2, 250 units of phytase activity – FTU – per kg of feed) plus 1 positive control diet without phytase, supplied to male and female birds. The result indicated that the colorimetric methodology with an extraction ratio of 1 : 20 (mass of sample in g:volume of the solvent extractor in mL) was shown to be the most adequate. There was no interaction between the phytase level and the sex of the broilers (p> 0. 05).

40|$|Background: Pancreatic enzyme {{replacement}} therapy (PERT) improves nutritional status and growth {{in patients with}} cystic fibrosis (CF) with pancreatic insufficiency (PI). The current recommendation for infants and young children, who {{are not able to}} swallow the whole capsule, is to open the capsule and mix the beads in a spoon with some applesauce; however, the efficacy and safety data of this approach are currently lacking. The aim {{of this study was to}} assess the efficacy, palatability (ease of swallowing), and safety of 4 dose levels of pancrelipase microtablets (Pancrease MT) in infants and young children with CF-related PI. Patients and Methods: This study was a phase II randomized, investigator-blinded, parallel-group pilot study in DNA-proven infants with CF and PI. The study design included a run-in period (days 1 - 5) and an experimental period (days 6 - 11). Pancrelipase microtablets (2 -mm, enteric coated) were provided orally. Sixteen subjects, 6 to 30 months of age, were provided 500 U lipase/kg/meal for 5 days (baseline period). Subsequently, subjects were randomly assigned to 1 of 4 treatment groups (each n = 4), receiving 500, 1000, 1500, or 2000 U (Ph. EUR) of lipase/kg/meal, respectively, for 5 days (experimental period). The primary endpoint was medication efficacy assessed by the 72 -hour fecal fat <b>excretion,</b> expressed as <b>coefficient</b> of fecal fat absorption (CFA), and (13) C mixed triglyceride breath test. Secondary endpoints were safety and palatability. Results: Overall compliance, defined as used study medication, was 89 % to 99 % for the entire study. None of the 4 dose regimens significantly influenced the CFA, relative to the baseline period (median range 83 %- 93 %). During the run-in period the median cumulative % (13) C was 11 (range - 8 to 59). After randomization the median cumulative % (13) C was 18 (range 14 - 23) in the 500 -U, 14 (range - 1 to 17) in the 1000 -U, 10 (range 10 - 27) in the 1500 -U, and 3 (range 1 - 49) in the 2000 -U groups. Palatability was scored fair to good by the parents in each of the treatment groups. Gastrointestinal symptoms were reported in some patients, including common adverse events reported in clinical trials involving pancreatic enzyme therapy. No serious or other adverse events were reported. Conclusion: Treatment with Pancrease MT at a dosage of 500 U lipase/kg/meal resulted in a CFA of approximately 89 % in pediatric subjects ages 6 to 30 months with PI resulting from CF. Pancrease MT doses were well tolerated and mean palatability was scored as fair to good. Present results do not indicate that a dosage higher than 500 U (Ph.
