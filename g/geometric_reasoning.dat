25|$|Sir Isaac Newton had {{published}} his Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica in 1687 {{in which he}} gave a derivation of Kepler's laws, which describe {{the motion of the}} planets, from his laws of motion and his law of universal gravitation. However, though Newton had privately developed the methods of calculus, all his published work used cumbersome <b>geometric</b> <b>reasoning,</b> unsuitable to account for the more subtle higher-order effects of interactions between the planets. Newton himself had doubted the possibility of a mathematical solution to the whole, even concluding that periodic divine intervention was necessary to guarantee the stability of the Solar System. Dispensing with the hypothesis of divine intervention would be a major activity of Laplace's scientific life. It is now generally regarded that Laplace's methods on their own, though vital {{to the development of the}} theory, are not sufficiently precise to demonstrate the stability of the Solar System, and indeed, the Solar System is understood to be chaotic, although it happens to be fairly stable.|$|E

40|$|Fluid {{intelligence}} {{is the ability}} to think flexibly and to understand abstract relations. People with high fluid intelligence (hi-fluIQ) perform better in analogical reasoning tasks than people with average fluid intelligence (ave-fluIQ). Although previous neuroimaging studies reported involvement of parietal and frontal brain regions in <b>geometric</b> analogical <b>reasoning</b> (which is a prototypical task for fluid intelligence), however, neuroimaging findings on <b>geometric</b> analogical <b>reasoning</b> in hi-fluIQ are sparse. Furthermore, evidence on the relation between brain activation and intelligence while solving cognitive tasks is contradictory. The present study was designed to elucidate the cerebral correlates of <b>geometric</b> analogical <b>reasoning</b> in a sample of hi-fluIQ and ave-fluIQ high school students. We employed a <b>geometric</b> analogical <b>reasoning</b> task with graded levels of task difficulty and confirmed the involvement of the parieto-frontal network in solving this task. In addition to characterizing the brain regions involved in <b>geometric</b> analogical <b>reasoning</b> in hi-fluIQ and ave-fluIQ, we found that blood oxygenation level dependency (BOLD) signal changes were greater for hi-fluIQ than for ave-fluIQ in parietal brain regions. However, ave-fluIQ showed greater BOLD signal changes in the anterior cingulate cortex and medial frontal gyrus than hi-fluIQ. Thus, we showed that a similar network of brain regions is involved in <b>geometric</b> analogical <b>reasoning</b> in both groups. Interestingly, the relation between brain activation and {{intelligence is}} not mono-directional, but rather, it is specific for each brain region. The negative brain activation–intelligence relationship in frontal brain regions in hi-fluIQ goes along with a better behavioral performance and reflects a lower demand for executive monitoring compared to ave-fluIQ individuals. In conclusion, our data indicate that flexibly modulating the extent of regional cerebral activity is characteristic for fluid intelligence...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. A child, {{or young}} human-like robot of the future, needs {{to develop an}} information-processing architecture, forms of representation, and {{mechanisms}} to support perceiving, manipulating, and thinking about the world, especially perceiving and thinking about actual and possible structures and processes in a 3 -D environment. The mechanisms for extending those representations and mechanisms, are also the core mechanisms required for developing mathematical competences, especially <b>geometric</b> and topological <b>reasoning</b> competences. Understanding both the natural processes and the requirements for future human-like robots requires AI designers to develop new forms of representation and mechanisms for <b>geometric</b> and topological <b>reasoning</b> to explain a child’s (or robot’s) development of understanding of affordances, and the proto-affordances that underlie them. A suitable multi-functional self-extending architecture will enable those competences to be developed. Within such a machine, human-like mathematical learning will be possible. It is argued that this can support Kant’s philosophy of mathematics, as against Humean philosophies. It also exposes serious limitations in studies of mathematical development by psychologists.

Both are driven by the same stroke capture mechanism. The mesh modelling system interprets a sketch by reference to a topological template. Hidden parts are generated using the template and assumptions of symmetry and axis-alignment. This tool is more useful for capturing curved shapes which conform to a template topology. The B-rep modelling system makes hypotheses about hidden topology and object geometry based on an estimation of the frontal geometry.
