40|$|Addition to dairy yoghurt of minced cooked beef {{was carried}} out {{as a way to}} provide {{additional}} health benefits to probiotic yoghurt. The study aimed to fortify yoghurt with high nutritional quality protein from meat. This novel health food will suit the majority of the population, particularly geriatric people, since foods such as yoghurt enriched with proteins would be suitable to deliver their specific nutritional requirements. The objectives of this study were to develop a new protein-rich yoghurt and determine its microbiological, physicochemical and sensory properties. The main phase was the preparation of yoghurts, with added beef meat (5 %, 7 %, and 9 %) such that the total solids content (around 20 %) remained constant, and was followed by homogenisation. Yoghurt containing <b>homogenised</b> <b>meat</b> (HMY), yoghurt containing unhomogenised meat (UHMY) and control plain yoghurt were produced. The yoghurt mixtures were heated at 85 °C for 30 minutes followed by inoculation and incubation at 42 °C for 5 hours after which they were stored for 21 days at 4 °C. The results showed that the production of acidity and microbial counts were not affected by the meat addition during a 21 day storage period at 4 °C, compared to the control. The microbiological counts of total lactic acid bacteria after 1 day of storage in meat-fortified yoghurts (around 30 × 10 E 7 cfu/g) were not significantly different from numbers in the control yoghurt. However, the counts showed significant loss of viability during the period of storage, although the final viable numbers in the yoghurts were high enough (> 10 E 7 cfu/g) for the products to be designated probiotic. Fortifying the yoghurt with meat did not stimulate the growth of contaminating coliforms, Salmonella and Listeria. The fat content decreased while the protein content increased significantly (P< 0. 05) with increased addition of meat. The fat content of yoghurts ranged between 2. 2 % (Control) and 1. 41 % (9 % meat addition), hence the yoghurts can be considered as low- fat products. Apparent viscosity and water holding capacity (WHC) decreased significantly (P< 0. 05) with the addition of meat. The control had the highest viscosity and WHC values followed by 5 % meat yoghurts. Colour was different for yoghurts containing different added meat and also in terms of homogenisation. The addition of meat changed the colour of yoghurts particularly in those containing higher meat content that had been homogenised. They were darker with a redder colour. Sensory results revealed that samples fortified with 5 % meat received the second highest scores for flavour after that of the control. Meat addition resulted in significant decrease (P< 0. 05) in the overall flavour quality. Meat addition improved the odour of yoghurts but decreased significantly (P< 0. 05) the overall scores for appearance and texture. Results showed that addition of 5 % meat could be used to produce a meat-added yoghurt without significant adverse effects on the microbial, physicochemical or sensory properties. As expected, 9 % meat yoghurt had the highest protein content (9. 98 %) compared to the control (6. 1 %). Further studies are needed {{to improve the quality of}} meat yoghurts in terms of apparent viscosity, whey separation, and colour and also enhance the overall flavour...|$|E
40|$|This thesis aims to {{investigate}} the relationship between increased protein dosage intake and selected haematological and biochemical markers. An experiment was designed using the Wistar laboratory rats of the male gander and similar age (born within +/- 5 days). These specimens were then divides into 3 groups with 10 specimens each. The age of the specimens {{at the beginning of}} the experiment was around 62 days. The first group was fed the standard corny mixture ad libitum, while the second group received 6 grams of the standard corny mixture and 10 grams of beef meat per day (thus reflecting the same amount of nitrous compounds as for the first group) and the last (third) group was fed ad libitum with <b>homogenised</b> beef <b>meat.</b> Before the diet was imposed on the three groups, blood samples were collected from all specimen from the lateral tail vein; after the diet was completed, blood samples were collected by in vivo heart puncture. All blood samples were subjected to haematological (using EDTA blood) and biochemical (using blood plasma) analysis. Overall, the following markers were measured: amount of erythrocytes, haematocrit level, haemoglobin level and Mean Corpuscular Volume (MCV) for the haematological analysis and triacylglycerol level, cholesterol level, amount of urea, amount of magnesium and the amount of iron for the biochemical analysis. Dietary induced significant changes were observed for the following markers: number of erythrocytes, levels of haemoglobin and MCV from the haematological analysis and cholesterol levels, amount of magnesium and amount of iron from the biochemical analysis; therefore showing that altered diet can have affect haematological and biochemical blood markers...|$|R
40|$|Consumption of {{the green}} flesh kiwifruit (Actinidia deliciosa, Hayward variety) is known to relieve {{constipation}} and provide relief from symptoms of digestive dysfunction, but the effect is poorly researched and a credible explanation and mechanism has not been documented. This body of work aimed to increase {{the understanding of the}} effects of kiwifruit on the digestion process. 	There is some evidence that the mechanism {{may be due to the}} proteolytic properties of actinidin, a unique protease in kiwifruit. Actinidin has a wide pH-dependent reactivity between pH 2. 5 - 6 with an optimum at pH 3. 0 - 3. 5; equivalent to low acid conditions more associated with hypochlorhydria than the pH range of 1. 5 - 2. 5 normally associated with efficient gastric hydrolysis of protein. It was hypothesised that in vitro and in vivo the digestion of protein would be facilitated by the presence of the kiwifruit protease, particularly when pH exceeded normal fasting gastric pH. A sequence of studies to measure the effects of lyophilised kiwifruit (KFI), rich in actinidin, on the digestion of protein was undertaken to test this hypothesis. 	Initially, proof of principle of the kiwifruit enzyme activity in vitro was investigated. Then, the practicality and reliability of a stable isotope technique to measure the rate of gastric protein-digestion in vivo was tested in three studies that compared the effect on gastric emptying dynamics of a protein meal with and without the protease. In vitro, <b>homogenised</b> freeze-dried <b>meat</b> powder (the protein) was incubated with a series of dilutions of hydrochloric acid (pH 1. 3 - 6. 4), pepsin (0 - 1. 2 % w/w) and KFI (0 - 0. 8 % w/w). Simulated gastric digestion involved incubation at 37 ºC for 60 minutes, after which the pH was adjusted to 6. 4, and simulated duodenal incubation continued for a further 120 minutes. The degree of protein hydrolysis was determined using the Kjeldahl technique. The addition of KFI to the gastric milieu was associated with an increase in the proportion of protein substrate hydrolysed, but only when the concentration of pepsin was sub-optimal for efficient protein hydrolysis and pH of the digestate was elevated above normal fasting gastric pH of > 2. 5 but 6. 0, this step required a method of measuring the change in the extent of hydrolysis of protein as a result of its passage through the stomach only. A literature review highlighted many of the problems associated with measuring in vivo factors likely to influence gastric protein-digestion efficiency, including fasting gastric pH, pepsin concentrations and post-prandial gastric re-acidification capacity. The complexity of measuring any of these factors, combined with limited resources, led to testing the feasibility of measuring an individual's gastric protein-digestion efficiency through an adaptation of the carbon- 13 octanoic acid breath test (13 C-OABT), as a proxy for protein digestion efficiency. 	In the first study, eleven healthy participants aged 58 – 80 agreed to consume, on two separate occasions one week apart, a three egg white, one yolk omelette with 100 mg of 13 C labelled octanoic acid with and without the addition of 2. 160 g of KFI (the treatment) taken in capsule form. On each occasion, two expired breath samples were collected from each participant before they commenced the meal and nine more postprandial over three hours. The rate of appearance of 13 CO 2 on the breath, an accepted measure of gastric emptying, is expressed as Tlag (time to maximum rate of detection of isotope on the breath) and T 1 / 2 (time at which 50 % of the isotope is retained in the stomach). The difference in these parameters between the two test meals was hypothesised to reflect the change in gastric protein-digestion efficiency due to the effect of KFI. Recruitment of participants was not difficult and the procedure was well tolerated. Based on the findings of the in vitro study, the hypothesis tested was that for participants with normal digestion, treatment would have little or no effect on the rate of protein hydrolysis and would therefore record little or no change in the rate of gastric emptying between control and treatment; whereas protein digestion, for participants with diminished gastric acidification, would be enhanced by the treatment and this would reflect in a one-way change in the dynamics of gastric emptying. 	Of the eleven participants, gastric emptying parameters increased for seven and decreased for four. The inter-individual variability bought into question the reliability of the test method and the measures were repeated four months later with six participants from the first study. Variation in repeat measures in the control condition Tlag and T 1 / 2 did not exceed 13 % and with the addition of KFI to the meal variation was slightly more at 20 – 24 %. Again the pattern of some participants exhibiting accelerated gastric emptying and some recording delayed gastric emptying as a result of treatment, was observed. 	A third and final in vivo study undertaken in China, employed a non-dispersive infrared spectrometer to measure isotope ratios, as opposed to the isotope ratio mass spectrometer used in the two earlier studies. It was hypothesised that neither the participant's ethnicity nor the equipment used to measure gastric emptying would significantly alter the measures when compared to studies in New Zealand. Parameters measured in the twelve volunteers were closely aligned to those of the first study and measures of differences of Tlag and T 1 / 2 with and without treatment were combined (n = 22) into a small meta-analysis. Treatment with KFI increased Tlag by 7 minutes (95 % CI [0, 19], p = 0. 060) and T 1 / 2 by 10 minutes (95 % CI [0, 14], p = 0. 027). However for the 16 / 22 participants not consuming proton pump inhibitors (PPIs), the effect was more marked: Tlag was increased by 14 % or 11 minutes (95 % CI [4, 18], p = 0. 050) and T 1 / 2 was increased by 10 % or 13 minutes (95 % CI [4, 23] p = 0. 027) = 0. 050) and T 1 / 2 was increased by 10 % or 13 minutes (95 % CI [4, 23] p = 0. 027). Multiple regression showed that the percentage increase in Tlag with KFI treatment was positively predicted by body weight and negatively predicted by consumption of PPIs. 	Despite trial design shortcomings, the combination of three small in vivo studies, involving 58 individual meals and the collection and analysis of 580 breath samples, indicated KFI had a significant and delaying effect on gastric emptying times (Tlag and T 1 / 2). This may indicate that for the majority of participants in these studies, KFI improved gastric digestion efficiency, as peptide products of protein hydrolysis are known to delay gastric emptying. As a result it was hypothesised that the inter-individual variability in response to treatment reflected the underlying gastric protein-digestion efficiency of the individual trial participants, but this hypothesis should be tested in future studies. 	While the novel test method employed in this study requires considerable further research to confirm the validity of the findings, what has emerged from this body of work is evidence that the protease content of the fruit is the likely active ingredient; that the stomach is the likely site of activity and that the effect is likely to be associated with existing gastric protein digestion inefficiency due to sub-optimal peptic hydrolysis...|$|R
