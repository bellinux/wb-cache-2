25|$|The {{dropping}} of McCosker angered Ian Chappell and {{his teammates}} and I copped the brunt of it. I {{may have been an}} unassuming guy at the time, but I was rudely awakened to the facts of life at test level – thanks, or rather no thanks to Chappell {{and the rest of the}} team. I was not exactly welcomed with open arms into the team. In fact, <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>lucky</b> to discover my locker in the Australian dressing rooms. To top it off, Chappell figured that if I was selected to replace McCosker, that's exactly what I would do... at Number 3. I suppose you could say it was an honour to bat ahead of Ian and Greg Chappell in a test. But I have no doubts that certain members of that team wanted me to fail and therefore prove that the selectors had erred. Normally, a new batsman could expect to be cradled into the side and be 'hidden' down the order until he gets the feel of the test atmosphere. There was no such deal for me. I was thrown into the deep end, to sink or swim, and that will live in my memory forever. While I am captain of a team, no batsman will be given the shoddy treatment I received on my test debut.|$|E

Callie starts a new relationship with Penny Blake and leaves to go to New York {{with her in the}} twelfth-season finale. Shonda Rhimes spoke on Ramirez's abrupt departure, saying, [...] "This one was different because it wasn’t a big planned thing. I had a different plan going and when Sara came in and said, ‘I really need to take this break,’ <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>lucky</b> that we’d shot {{the end of the season}} with her going to New York.” ...|$|E

[...] "It's {{the best team}} I have seen in my long career as a coach. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>lucky</b> in having under me a team whose members possessed much natural ability and who played the game intelligently. I {{have never seen a}} team that, as a whole, was so fast in the composite." [...] For many years, it was considered [...] "the greatest football team the South had ever produced".

500|$|The {{top three}} drivers {{appeared}} on the podium to collect their trophies and at a later press conference. Häkkinen was delighted with his victory: [...] "This was an incredible win. It {{was a very difficult}} and unusual situation including my spin which of course was not planned. The kerbs here are very slippery and once you go over one there is not much you can do. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>lucky</b> to keep going and I was able to chase Michael. But the car got better and better." [...] The driver added that he wanted to review his overtaking manoeuvre to see if Michael Schumacher performed an illegal move. Schumacher said that despite improvements to his car, he was unable to match Häkkinen's overall pace. He added that he experienced no problems running off-line to cool his tyres, and was happy to run behind backmarkers for straight-line speed assistance during the race's closing stages.|$|E
500|$|In {{the last}} years of her life, Vulović lived on a pension of €300 per month in her {{dilapidated}} Belgrade apartment. [...] "I don't know know what to say when people say <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>lucky...</b> life is so hard today," [...] she remarked. Vulović said she was [...] "tired" [...] of discussing her fall. She only occasionally granted interviews and declined numerous requests, most notably from Oprah Winfrey and the BBC. Vulović's deteriorating health prevented her from taking part in annual commemorations at Srbská Kamenice, which she had previously attended for many years. In December 2016, Vulović's friends became concerned for her well-being after she abruptly stopped answering her telephone. On 23 December, locksmiths discovered Vulović's lifeless body in her apartment after forcing open the door. Vulović's friends said that she had struggled with heart ailments in the years leading up to her death. She was buried in Belgrade's New Cemetery on 27 December.|$|E
500|$|Thomas O'Leary, the {{wireless}} operator for ML 446, recalled {{the ferocity of}} incoming German fire, stating"One commando was remarking how pretty the tracer fire, red and green, was. A moment later one blew {{the back of his}} head out. I was down below with my tin hat because by now the bullets were going through (the boat) and out the other side. If I wanted to get about I had to crawl on my hands and knees and <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>lucky</b> nothing came through at my level. We couldn't get in (to the objective) and all over a sudden the wounded started coming down. By then all our guns had jammed and most of the other ships were on fire."ML 177, the launch that had successfully taken off some of the crew from Campbeltown, was sunk on her way out of the estuary. [...] ML 269, another torpedo-armed boat, had the unenviable task of moving up and down the river at high speed to draw German fire away from the landings. Soon after passing Campbeltown it was hit and its steering damaged. It took ten minutes to repair the steering. They turned and started in the other direction, opening fire on an armed trawler in passing. Return fire from the trawler set their engine on fire.|$|E
