40|$|Abstract This {{study was}} {{grounded}} on the students’ hobby in reading comics. The {{result of the}} literature study showed that comic used as media in learning Physics was very effective as learning media and attractive to be read. One of the supporting factors of this success in improving the students’ multiple intelligences was the integration of art and craft activities in the science learning process. Moreover, the theory of multiple intelligences accomodated students with various way of learning thinking. The developed training model in this study consisted of five stages that were orientation, presentation, structured excersice, guided excersice and individual excersice. In each Science class, the learning process was always started with the elicitation of students’ prior knowledge. Then each student got one comic to be read. After the reading session, the teacher asked them about {{the contents of the}} comics either classically or individually. In the next step the students were invited to observe the <b>demonstration</b> <b>done</b> <b>by</b> the teacher only if the instruments or materials were not safe for them, (e. g hot water). Nevertheless, if they were safe enough for the students, they were allowed to do the experiment by themselves. Students’ worksheets (LKS) were done by the students in group to develop their interpersonal and verbal-linguistic intelligences. Based on observation during experiments and drawing activities, the students’ visual-spatial intelligences were developed. Every learning process was always ended with knowledge test individually which would be discussed later. The study concluded that: 1) the training model improved PGSD students’ skills in developing comic as teaching media, 2) comics are proven to improve the elementary school students’ motivation in learning science, 3) comic enhanced elementary school students’ understanding in science knowledge which was indicated by the achievement of the students’ test score (85 point grade). Comic also developed elementary school students’ multiple intelligences in the aspects of verbal-linguistic, logical-mathematic, visual-spatial, naturalist, and interpersonal. It is recommended that comic should be developed as teaching media especially in elementary school. Comis can be used as one alternative of learning medias that can motivate students to learn something as well as improving their reading hobby.

The proposed camera is featured with simple and lightweight design, easy portability, low cost, high resolution and sensitivity, and minimal image interference or distortion to the original field distribution. The imaging capability of the proposed camera was characterized in both near field and far field ranges. The experimental and simulated near field images both reveal that the camera produces qualitatively accurate images with negligible distortion to the original field distribution. The far field <b>demonstration</b> was <b>done</b> <b>by</b> coupling the designed camera with a microwave convex lens.

40|$|Virtualized cloud {{infrastructures}} {{are very}} popular as they allow resource mutualization and therefore cost reduction. For cloud providers, minimizing {{the number of}} used resources {{is one of the}} main services that such environments must ensure. Cloud customers are also concerned with the minimization of used resources in the cloud since they want to reduce their invoice. Thus, resource management in the cloud should be considered by the cloud provider at the virtualization level and by the cloud customers at the application level. Many research works investigate resource management strategies in these two levels. Most of them study virtual machine consolidation (according to the virtualized infrastructure utilization rate) at the virtualized level and dynamic application sizing (according to its workload) at the application level. However, these strategies are studied separately. In this article, we show that virtual machine consolidation and dynamic application sizing are complementary. We show the efficiency of the combination of these two strategies, in reducing resource usage and keeping an application’s Quality of Service. Our <b>demonstration</b> is <b>done</b> <b>by</b> comparing the evaluation of three resource management strategies (implemented at the virtualization level only, at the application level only, or complementary at both levels) in a private cloud infrastructure, hosting typical JEE web applications (evaluated with the RUBiS benchmark) ...|$|R
40|$|The {{conflict}} between classical and quantum physics {{can be identified}} {{through a series of}} yes-no tests on quantum systems, without it being necessary that these systems be in special quantum states. Kochen-Specker (KS) sets of yes-no tests have this property and provide a quantum-versus-classical advantage that is free of the initialization problem that affects some quantum computers. Here, we report the first experimental implementation of a complete KS set that consists of 18 yes-no tests on four-dimensional quantum systems and show how to use the KS set to obtain a state-independent quantum advantage. We first demonstrate the unique power of this KS set for solving a task while avoiding the problem of state initialization. Such a <b>demonstration</b> is <b>done</b> <b>by</b> showing that, for 28 different quantum states encoded in the orbital-angular-momentum and polarization degrees of freedom of single photons, the KS set provides an impossible-to-beat solution. In a second experiment, we generate maximally contextual quantum correlations by performing compatible sequential measurements of the polarization and path of single photons. In this case, state independence is demonstrated for 15 different initial states. Maximum contextuality and state independence follow {{from the fact that the}} sequences of measurements project any initial quantum state onto one of the KS set’s eigenstates. Our results show that KS sets can be used for quantum-information processing and quantum computation and pave the way for future developments...|$|R
40|$|This article aims to {{question}} the anti-individualist stance in Carl Schmitt’s concept of the political by uncovering the historical bias of Schmitt’s anti-individualism, seen here {{as one of the}} main driving forces behind his argument. For Schmitt, the political can take place only when a collectivity is able to declare war to another collectivity on the basis of feeling existentially threatened by the latter. As such, Schmitt’s framework implies the inescapable possibility of war, as the condition which makes possible the political. Acknowledging the previous criticisms of Schmitt raised by John Rawls and Iris Marion Young, this article takes a different path by pointing to certain historically tacit assumptions in 1927 Germany which Schmitt took for granted, but which are not suitable for a contemporary political theory. The <b>demonstration</b> is <b>done</b> first <b>by</b> showing how the structure of interruption functions in the works of Schmitt, then showing how he conceives of the individual as a possible interruption of the political in history, and then placing this structure of interruption in the historical context of Schmitt’s writing. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|The {{dynamics}} of fixed wing planes are well understood within the conventional flight envelope. The situation {{is different in}} the case of aerobatic maneuvers with a large angle of attack, such as perching and vertical hover. In such maneuvers the airflows around the plane are unpredictable making it difficult to create accurate dynamic models, which would normally be needed for the design of conventional controllers. Yet human RC pilots are able to fly these maneuvers with fixed wing planes. Apprenticeship learning provides a promising {{solution to the problem of}} automating highly aerobatic maneuvers. It allows the maneuver to be learned from <b>demonstration</b> flights <b>done</b> <b>by</b> a human RC pilot rather than relying on an accurate dynamics model. The focus of this thesis is on a specific issue in apprenticeship learning, namely how to infer the trajectory the pilot intended to fly from a set of suboptimal demonstration trajectories. Such a trajectory can be used as a target trajectory for an autonomous controller. A trajectory learning algorithm that has shown promising results in automation of aerobatic helicopter flight is applied to a fixed wing UAV platform. The algorithm is tested on two different maneuvers; A straight line of level flight, and a vertical hover maneuver. In the case of both maneuvers the algorithm learned the intended trajectory without prior knowledge about the trajectory. In order to collect training data for the trajectory learning task, an appropriate platform and data acquisition system are needed. This thesis therefore also presents the development of a fixed wing UAV platform for research on automation of aerobatic flight...|$|R
