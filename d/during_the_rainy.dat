5|$|Bangui is the {{transport}} {{hub of the}} Central African Republic. As of 1999, eight roads connected the city to other main towns in the country, Cameroon, Chad and South Sudan; of these, only the toll roads are paved. <b>During</b> <b>the</b> <b>rainy</b> season from July to October, some roads are impassable. The road network in the city emanates from the Palace de la Republique.|$|E
30|$|The {{reproductive}} {{activity of}} D. melanostictus is seasonal and {{is related to}} the rainfall regime. Ovarian follicles begin vitellogenesis at the end of <b>the</b> little <b>rainy</b> season and reach their maximal diameter from May to July, months when <b>the</b> little <b>rainy</b> season abruptly ceases. Oviposition takes place <b>during</b> <b>the</b> auxiliary <b>rainy</b> season, and egg development occurs <b>during</b> <b>the</b> auxiliary <b>rainy</b> season and <b>the</b> first main <b>rainy</b> season of <b>the</b> year. Seasonality in female reproductive activity seems to be common in anurans from Bach Ma National Park. In fact, it was suggested that in tropical anuran species living in areas of pronounced difference between the little and main rainy seasons, oviposition is concentrated at the end of <b>the</b> little <b>rainy</b> season, and hatching occurs <b>during</b> <b>the</b> auxiliary <b>rainy</b> season and early in <b>the</b> main <b>rainy</b> season (Ngo et al. 2009).|$|R

5|$|The Pacific coast {{features}} a humid subtropical climate that experiences milder winters with occasional snowfall and hot, humid summers {{because of the}} southeast seasonal wind. The Ryukyu Islands have a subtropical climate, with warm winters and hot summers. Precipitation is very heavy, especially <b>during</b> <b>the</b> <b>rainy</b> season.|$|E
5|$|Maraba's coffee {{plants are}} the Bourbon {{variety of the}} Coffea arabica species and are grown on fertile {{volcanic}} soils on high-altitude hills. The fruit is handpicked, mostly <b>during</b> <b>the</b> <b>rainy</b> season between March and May, and brought to a washing station in Maraba, where the coffee beans are extracted and dried. At several stages, the beans are sorted according to quality. The farmers receive credits based on the amount {{and quality of the}} beans they provide.|$|E
5|$|Ominously, PAVN and the Pathet Lao did not {{withdraw}} to North Vietnam <b>during</b> <b>the</b> <b>rainy</b> season. Previously during the conflict, air mobility by STOL aircraft into the Lima Sites had provided the Hmong with {{an advantage over}} the road-bound PAVN and Pathet Lao forces. This advantage was {{now going to be}} overcome by road improvement and the prepositioning of supplies which allowed the communists to maintain year-round use of their lines of communication.|$|E
50|$|Sexual {{maturity}} {{in males}} is reached at 5 years and between 4 and 5 years for females of the Ugandan red colobus. The Gestation period is 5 to 6 months with females having their first infant between 4 and 5 years old. There is no distinct breeding season with infants being born all year round, however <b>during</b> <b>the</b> <b>rainier</b> months a peak in births {{is seen to}} coincide with the flush of new leaves for food.|$|R
50|$|A major {{geographic}} {{feature of}} the region is the Nugaal Valley, a large shallow drainage basin fed by the Nugal and Dheer seasonal rivers <b>during</b> <b>the</b> April-June <b>rainy</b> season.|$|R
50|$|M. pusillus {{females are}} sexually {{receptive}} year round, however, mating and lactation {{have been most}} frequently been observed <b>during</b> <b>the</b> periods when fruit is most accessible. This is <b>during</b> <b>the</b> two <b>rainy</b> seasons <b>during</b> <b>the</b> year. <b>The</b> <b>rainy</b> season <b>during</b> <b>the</b> spring is from March to May and in the fall from September to November. The selection of this time frame for gestation and lactation allows the female the best opportunity for satisfying her nutritional needs {{during a time of}} increased metabolic rate. Morphological differences in the males allow them to emit high pitched sounds to attract a mate.|$|R
5|$|An even {{checkerboard}} plot model {{dominates the}} green landscape <b>during</b> <b>the</b> <b>rainy</b> season, which becomes more austere after harvest. The rice fields differ {{only in terms}} of soil type and location. Where mangroves are populous, such as in Carabane, the rice paddy fields between them must be protected from the channels of saltwater which overflow during high tide. Rice farmers must therefore build levees, dig ditches, and create ponds. The fish and shrimp which subsequently become trapped are harvested {{at the end of the}} rainy season, when the basins are emptied. The plots of land which were safeguarded from flooding are then cleared and ploughed. Several years of drainage are required to desalinate the soil.|$|E
5|$|At {{the age of}} thirty, Mahavira {{abandoned}} the comforts of royal life and left his home and family to live an ascetic life {{in the pursuit of}} spiritual awakening. He undertook severe austerities of fasting and bodily mortifications, meditated under the Ashoka tree, and discarded his clothes. There is a graphic description of his hardships and humiliation in the Acharanga Sutra. According to the Kalpa Sūtra, Mahavira spent the first forty-two monsoons of his life at Astikagrama, Champapuri, Prstichampa, Vaishali, Vanijagrama, Nalanda, Mithila, Bhadrika, Alabhika, Panitabhumi, Shravasti, and Pawapuri. He is said to have lived in Rajagriha <b>during</b> <b>the</b> <b>rainy</b> season of the forty-first year of his ascetic life. This is traditionally dated to have been in 491BC.|$|E
5|$|Common elands are herbivores that browse during drier {{winter months}} but have also adapted to grazing <b>during</b> <b>the</b> <b>rainy</b> season when grasses are more common. They require a high-protein diet of {{succulent}} leaves from flowering plants but will consume lower quality plant material if available including forbs, trees, shrubs, grasses, seeds and tubers. The eland can conserve water by increasing its body temperature. Grasses the eland eats include Setaria and Themeda and fruits from Securinega and Strychnos. Large antelope can survive on lower quality food {{in times of}} little rain. Elands feed during the night in hot weather and sleep for long periods during the day.|$|E
50|$|All {{the rivers}} in the Lotsane basin are dry {{throughout}} the year, experiencing ephemeral flow <b>during</b> <b>the</b> summer <b>rainy</b> season. People in nearby areas collect water {{stored in the}} sandy riverbed.|$|R
50|$|Active {{mostly at}} night, it breeds <b>during</b> <b>the</b> summer <b>rainy</b> season, moving {{upstream}} in rivers after water has receded, with migrations at irregular intervals. Females carry 10,000-70,000 eggs at a time.|$|R
50|$|The annual {{rainfall}} is {{less than}} 750 mm, all falling <b>during</b> <b>the</b> short <b>rainy</b> season, and <b>the</b> area receives no rainfall <b>during</b> <b>the</b> months of November to April. Temperatures can exceed 40 C <b>during</b> <b>the</b> hotter months.|$|R
5|$|<b>During</b> <b>the</b> <b>rainy</b> {{night of}} 2 January 1968, six men {{dressed in black}} uniforms were seen outside the {{defensive}} wire of the main base by members of a listening post. After failing {{to respond to a}} challenge, they were fired upon and five were killed outright while the sixth, although wounded, escaped. This event prompted Cushman to reinforce Lownds {{with the rest of the}} 2nd Battalion, 26th Marines. This marked the first time that all three battalions of the 26th Marine Regiment had operated together in combat since the invasion of Iwo Jima during the Second World War. To cover a defilade near the Rao Quan River, four companies from 2/26 were immediately sent out to occupy Hill 558, with another manning Hill 861A.|$|E
5|$|In {{their design}} of the reductions, the Jesuits were {{inspired}} by “ideal cities“ as outlined in works such as Utopia and Arcadia, written respectively by the 16th-century English philosophers Thomas More and Philip Sidney. The Jesuits had specific criteria for building sites: locations with plenty of wood for construction; sufficient water for the population; good soil for agriculture; and safety from flooding <b>during</b> <b>the</b> <b>rainy</b> season. Although most of the missions in the Chiquitania were relocated at least once {{during the time of}} the Jesuits, four of ten towns remained at their original sites. Wood and adobe were the main materials used in the construction of the settlements.|$|E
5|$|Key {{protein sources}} include birds and tenrecs. Mikea adults and {{children}} of both sexes use clubs to kill the small tenrec (tambotrika, 0.4 kilograms), which is widespread year round, and the larger one (tandraka, 2-3 kilograms), which is mainly caught <b>during</b> <b>the</b> <b>rainy</b> season. To a lesser extent they also hunt or trap two to three species of lemur, feral cats, occasional wild boars, turtles and rodents using blowguns, spears and dogs, and use a hook and line to catch fish in saline inland lakes. Some Mikea raise animals for food or sale at market, including goats, chickens and guinea fowl; tree nuts also provide additional protein.|$|E
50|$|The annual {{precipitation}} average 15 in per rainfall year (July 1 to June 30) within a 20-year period between 1982 and 2002. Most of <b>the</b> precipitation occurs <b>during</b> <b>the</b> November-April <b>rainy</b> season.|$|R
50|$|Keren's {{climate is}} {{semi-desert}} hot during summer and cold <b>during</b> winter. <b>The</b> <b>rainy</b> season extends from mid-June to mid-September. From October to February, the town experiences the cool winter season. The climate heats up from March to June, though the nights are pleasant.|$|R
50|$|Boreal digging frogs breed <b>during</b> <b>the</b> annual <b>rainy</b> season, around June and July. After <b>the</b> <b>rainy</b> {{season is}} over they dig burrows underground, {{emerging}} only at night to feed. The eggs are laid in batches of 15-20 in monsoonal pools, with the tadpoles maturing within 30 days, much faster than most other frogs in this area.|$|R
5|$|Springbok mate year-round, though {{females are}} more likely to enter oestrus <b>during</b> <b>the</b> <b>rainy</b> season, when food is more plentiful. Females are able to {{conceive}} at as early as six to seven months, whereas males do not attain sexual maturity until two years; rut lasts 5 to 21 days. When a female approaches a rutting male, the male holds his head and tail at level with the ground, lowers his horns, and makes a loud grunting noise to attract her. The male then urinates and sniffs the female's perineum. If the female is receptive, she urinates, as well, and the male makes a flehmen gesture, and taps his leg till the female leaves or permits him to mate. Copulation consists of a single pelvic thrust.|$|E
5|$|The arid {{conditions}} of the spiny forest, which receives less than 600 millimeters of rainfall each year, largely shape Mikea economic activities. Nearly everything they consume is scavenged from the forest, and the average Mikea needs two hours or less to collect adequate food for the day. Their main source of food is tubers, particularly {{during the dry season}} when few other foods may be reliably available. Adults and children of both genders work to dig up using a metal-tipped digging stick (antsoro) and a digging bowl (kipao). The starchy ovy tuber is roasted or boiled before eating, while the Mikea eat the watery babo (or baboho) raw for hydration or use its water for boiling other foods; the tavolo tuber is dried and ground to make a flour that is sold at village markets. They also gather forest fruits, melons and honey, with the latter a particularly important source of income for the Mikea <b>during</b> <b>the</b> <b>rainy</b> season. To obtain water <b>during</b> <b>the</b> <b>rainy</b> season the Mikea capture rain run-off from the rooftops of their houses using hollowed-out logs or transport water on foot or zebu-drawn wagon from the villages, while during the cool dry season the Mikea consume their store of water-engorged babo tubers and drink water from natural or man-made wells when possible.|$|E
5|$|The {{northern}} part of the commune is hilly but relatively favorable to agriculture, while the southern part is flat and characterized by sand dunes. Sixteen caves are found within the area. The earth is mainly composed of stony rocks, sandy loam soils, and clay loam soils in the beds of wadis in the area. The soils in the hills have pockets of alluvium and sandy loam suitable for crop development, particularly on the hillsides and {{at the foot of the}} hills. Clay loam soils are found in the bowls and beds of wadis, which although suitable for farming are susceptible to gully and water erosion <b>during</b> <b>the</b> <b>rainy</b> season.|$|E
30|$|Extremely low mean NDVI value {{ranged from}} 0.23 to 0.27 was {{observed}} in the lowland area than mid and highlands. NDVI coverage <b>during</b> <b>the</b> main <b>rainy</b> season decreased by 3 – 4 % in all districts of the study area, while LST shows a significant increase by 0.52 – 1.08  °C. VHI and rainfall value was significantly decreased <b>during</b> <b>the</b> main <b>rainy</b> season. Agricultural drought responded positively to seasonal rainfall (R 2 [*]=[*] 0.357 to R 2 [*]=[*] 0.651) at p[*]<[*] 0.01 and p[*]<[*] 0.05 significance level. This relationship revealed that when rainfall increases, VHI also tends to increase. As a result, the event of agricultural drought diminished.|$|R
5000|$|Porto {{features}} a warm-summer mediterranean climate Csb in the Köppen climate classification. As a result, its climate shares many characteristics with the coastal south: warm, dry summers and mild, rainy winters. Cool and rainy days can, occasionally, interrupt the dry season. These occasional summer rainy periods may last {{a few days}} and are characterised by showers and cool temperatures of around [...] in the afternoon. The annual precipitation is high and concentrated in the winter months, making Porto one of the wettest major cities of Europe. However, long periods with mild temperatures and sunny days are frequent even <b>during</b> <b>the</b> <b>rainiest</b> months.|$|R
5000|$|The average {{temperature}} of these islands is about [...] during daytime and slightly warmer during night-time due to cold weather associated with rain showers <b>during</b> daytime. <b>The</b> <b>rainy</b> season is from September through November. The island {{is covered with}} scrub, grasses and some stands of Casuarina trees.|$|R
5|$|The {{rocks are}} home to over 70 species of animals and 340 species of plants, which {{includes}} over 200 species of wildflowers. Vernal pools atop the plateaus fill <b>during</b> <b>the</b> <b>rainy</b> season in winter and spring because the andesite is impermeable. The dwarf woolly meadowfoam, a species of wildflower, grows around these pools, and is endemic to the rocks. The pools are also {{one of only a}} few places where the federally threatened species of fairy shrimp, Branchinecta lynchi, can be found. To protect these and other threatened species, the Bureau of Land Management has listed the rocks as an Area of Critical Environmental Concern since 1984.|$|E
5|$|Each year, some East African {{populations of}} blue {{wildebeest}} have a long-distance migration, seemingly timed {{to coincide with}} the annual pattern of rainfall and grass growth. The timing of their migrations in both the rainy and dry seasons can vary considerably (by months) from year to year. At the end of the wet season (May or June in East Africa), wildebeest migrate to dry-season areas in response to a lack of surface (drinking) water. When the rainy season begins again (months later), animals quickly move back to their wet-season ranges. Factors suspected to affect migration include food abundance, surface water availability, predators, and phosphorus content in grasses. Phosphorus is a crucial element for all life forms, particularly for lactating female bovids. As a result, <b>during</b> <b>the</b> <b>rainy</b> season, wildebeest select grazing areas that contain particularly high phosphorus levels. One study found, in addition to phosphorus, wildebeest select ranges containing grass with relatively high nitrogen content.|$|E
5|$|Even {{though the}} Viet Cong {{had won a}} clear victory over the regular units of the South Vietnamese army, they did not get away with light casualties. After the battle, a {{combined}} total of 126 Viet Cong bodies were recovered within the Special Forces compound and the district headquarters, and several hundred more were strewn all over the battlefield. Indeed, individual Viet Cong soldiers usually spare no efforts to evacuate their dead or wounded comrades; but as military operations were conducted <b>during</b> <b>the</b> <b>rainy</b> season, the Viet Cong struggled to evacuate all their casualties from the battlefield as conditions on the main roads deteriorated. Despite the minor setbacks, the Đồng Xoài campaign marked the rapid maturity of the Viet Cong 9th Division as a fighting force. For their efforts during the battle, the Viet Cong 272nd Regiment received the title of 'Đồng Xoài Regiment' to mark their achievements.|$|E

500|$|The {{average daily}} {{traveling}} distance for ruffed lemurs varies between , averaging [...] per day. Activity patterns {{within the community}} range vary by gender and season. Males generally stay within a core area all year, whereas females only confine themselves to a core area <b>during</b> <b>the</b> cold wet season, then expand their range throughout <b>the</b> community range <b>during</b> <b>the</b> hot, <b>rainy</b> season. Females expand their traveling range slightly after giving birth, still staying within the core area, but gradually range further in December when they begin stashing their infants with other community members while they look for food. Females range <b>the</b> furthest later <b>during</b> <b>the</b> hot, <b>rainy</b> season. Both activity level and reproductive activity can be summarized in the following table.|$|R
