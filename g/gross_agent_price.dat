40|$|By {{employing}} dynamic pricing, the act {{of changing}} prices over time within a marketplace, sellers {{have the potential to}} increase their revenue by selling goods to buyers "at the right time, at the right <b>price.</b> " Software <b>agents</b> have been used in electronic commerce systems to assist buyers, but there is limited use of selling agents in today's markets. As dynamic pricing systems become necessary as a competitive maneuver and as market mechanisms become large scale and more complex, there is a growing need for <b>pricing</b> <b>agents</b> to be used to automate dynamic pricing, which challenges sellers to improve their understanding of what are the best <b>agent</b> <b>pricing</b> strategies for their marketplaces. This thesis addresses these issues by presenting the Learning Curve Simulator, a market simulator designed for analyzing <b>agent</b> <b>pricing</b> strategies for a market in which a seller has a finite time horizon to sell its inventory. Through an analysis of several pricing strategies using the simulator, I demonstrate how the Learning Curve Simulator {{can be used as a}} tool for understanding the relevant factors in determining an effective dynamic pricing strategy. This simulation-based approach to dynamic pricing demonstrates a technique which can lead to the implementation of dynamic pricing strategies in real world markets. by Joan Morris. Thesis (S. M.)

This paper extends the class of models that support the habits explanation in order to account for heterogeneity in earnings, wealth, habits and consumption. I find that habit formation increases the equity premium. However, contrary to the earlier results in the literature, the habit hypothesis does not imply a price for risk {{much higher than the}} one implied by models with intertemporally separable preferences. The main reasons for this are general equilibrium ones. First, with just two assets available, households can smooth out consumption fluctuations very well. Therefore, the higher utility losses of uncertainty imposed by habits will not command a high price of risk because households manage to avoid this risk. Second, the composition of the set of <b>agents</b> <b>pricing</b> the assets is sensitive to changes in the model.

Intrafirm conflicts are captured by a principal-agent framework with firms employing more than one agent and implementing a tournament incentive scheme. The principals offer premium incentives in the sense of revenue shares to which agents react by proposing a sales price. Introducing such intrafirm conflicts results in higher prices and lower effort levels. Increasing the number of agents lowers the optimal surplus share of the agents as well as the individual effort and the sales prices.

40|$|Markets are {{important}} coordination mechanisms for multiagent systems, and market clearing {{has become a}} key application area of AI algorithms. We study optimal clearing in the ubiquitous setting where there are multiple indistinguishable units for sale. The sellers and buyers express their bids via supply/demand curves. Discriminatory pricing leads to greater profit for the party who runs the market than nondiscriminatory pricing. We show that this comes {{at the cost of}} computation complexity. For piecewise linear curves we present a fast polynomial-time algorithm for nondiscriminatory clearing, and show that discriminatory clearing is complete (even in a very special case). We then show that in the more restricted setting of linear curves, even discriminatory markets can be cleared fast in polynomial time. Our derivations also uncover the elegant fact that to obtain the optimal discriminatory solution, each buyer's (seller's) price is incremented (decremented) equally from that <b>agent's</b> <b>price</b> in the quantity-unconstrained solution...|$|R
