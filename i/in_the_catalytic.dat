25|$|The primase used in {{this process}} differs {{significantly}} between bacteria and archaea/eukaryotes. Bacteria use a primase belonging to the DnaG protein superfamily which contains a catalytic domain of the TOPRIM fold type. The TOPRIM fold contains an α/β core with four conserved strands in a Rossmann-like topology.

25|$|Using {{sequence}} {{similarity to}} infer homology has several limitations. There is no minimum level of sequence similarity guaranteed to produce identical structures. Over {{long periods of}} evolution, related proteins may show no detectable sequence similarity to one another. Sequences with many insertions and deletions can also sometimes be difficult to align and so identify the homologous sequence regions. In the PA clan of proteases, for example, not a single residue is conserved through the superfamily, not even those <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>catalytic</b> triad. Conversely, the individual families {{that make up a}} superfamily are defined {{on the basis of their}} sequence alignment, for example the C04 protease family within the PA clan.|$|E
25|$|While {{studying}} {{the effect of}} biodiesel on a D.P.F. {{it was found that}} though the presence of sodium and potassium carbonates aided <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>catalytic</b> conversion of ash, as the diesel particulates are catalyzed, they may congregate inside the D.P.F. and so interfere with the clearances of the filter. This may cause the filter to clog and interfere with the regeneration process. In a study on the impact of E.G.R. rates with blends of jathropa biodiesel it was shown that there was a decrease in fuel efficiency and torque output due to the use of biodiesel on a diesel engine designed with an E.G.R. system. It was found that CO and CO2 emissions increased with an increase in exhaust gas recirculation but NOx levels decreased. The opacity level of the jathropa blends was in an acceptable range, where traditional diesel was out of acceptable standards. It was shown that a decrease in Nox emissions could be obtained with an E.G.R. system. This study showed an advantage over traditional diesel within a certain operating range of the E.G.R. system.|$|E

25|$|The {{mechanism}} for MMP-3 is {{a variation on}} a larger theme seen in all matrix metalloproteinases. In the active site, a water molecule is coordinated to a glutamate residue (Glu202) {{and one of the}} zinc ions present <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>catalytic</b> domain. First, the coordinated water molecule performs a nucleophilic attack on the peptide substrate's scissile carbon while the glutamate simultaneously abstracts a proton from the water molecule. The abstracted proton is then removed from the glutamate by the nitrogen of the scissile amide. This forms a tetrahedral gem-diolate intermediate that is coordinated to the zinc atom. In order for the amide product to be released from the active site, the scissile amide must abstract a second proton from the coordinated water molecule. Alternatively, it has been shown for thermolysin (another metalloproteinase) that the amide product can be released in its neutral (R-NH2) form. The carboxylate product is released after a water molecule attacks the zinc ion and displaces the carboxylate product. The release of the carboxylate product is thought to be the rate-limiting step in the reaction.|$|E
500|$|The Negishi {{coupling}} is also {{an important}} reaction for the formation of new carbon-carbon bonds between unsaturated carbon atoms in alkenes, arenes and alkynes. The catalysts are nickel and palladium.

500|$|The {{preparation}} of stable carbenes free from metal cations has been keenly sought to allow further {{study of the}} carbene species in isolation from these metals. Separating a carbene from a carbene-metal complex can be problematic due to {{the stability of the}} complex. Accordingly, it is preferable to make the carbene free from these metals in the first place.

40|$|SummarySignal {{transduction}} in cell {{growth and}} proliferation involves regulation of kinases through long-range allostery between remote protein regions. Molecular dynamics free energy calculations {{are used to}} clarify the coupling between <b>the</b> <b>catalytic</b> domain of Src kinase Hck and its N-terminal end connecting to the regulatory SH 2 and SH 3 modules. The N-terminal end is stable <b>in</b> <b>the</b> orientation required for the regulatory modules to remain properly bound only <b>in</b> <b>the</b> inactive <b>catalytic</b> domain. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> active <b>catalytic</b> domain, <b>the</b> N-terminal end prefers a different conformation consistent with dissociation of the regulatory modules. The free energy surface shows that the N-terminal end acts as a reversible two-state conformational switch coupling <b>the</b> <b>catalytic</b> domain to <b>the</b> regulatory modules. Structural analogy with insulin receptor kinase and c-Src suggests that such reversible conformational switching in a critical hinge region could be a common mechanism in long-range allosteric regulation of protein kinase activity...|$|R

500|$|The {{majority}} of human Kinesin-5 inhibitors are selective, because they bind to a drug ‘hot spot’, composed of residues from the α2 and α3 helices and a flexible L5 loop {{on the surface}} of the motor domain. [...] This L5 loop has high sequence variability amongst the Kinesin-5 orthologs and other kinesins within the superfamily. [...] The L5 loop in human Kinesin-5 closes around the inhibitor and is open in the absence of inhibitor. [...] These structural changes are correlated with other changes <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>catalytic</b> active site. Other sites of inhibitor binding have been identified in the human Kinesin-5 motor domain. For inhibitors that bind to the L5 pocket, the mechanism of inhibition is that they slow ADP release from the catalytic active site and inhibit ATP-dependent directional motion. [...] However, a previously unknown diffusive motion by Kinesin-5 along microtubules was uncovered when monastrol inhibited the motor domain.|$|E
500|$|Kinesin-5, {{like all}} motor proteins, breaks down ATP into ADP and {{inorganic}} phosphate, using a water molecule, and converts the chemical energy to force and motion along microtubules. [...] Kinetic experiments reveal rates of how fast intermediate steps in catalysis occur {{and the most}} extensive set of studies on Kinesin-5 kinetics {{has been on the}} human protein. [...] X-ray crystallography, cryo-electron microscopy, and real-time infrared spectroscopy have been used to measure the structure of Kinesin-5 in the different catalytic intermediate states. [...] Changes in the secondary structure, or conformational switching, is required to convert and amplify biochemical changes <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>catalytic</b> active site into larger movements necessary for cellular motion. [...] For example, the first step of ATP hydrolysis, which is the attack of the terminal phosphate of ATP by a water molecule, had not been observed by x-ray crystallography in any kinesin protein, until recently in Kinesin-5. [...] This crystal structure showed that there was not one, but rather two, water molecules and they are in close association with each other. [...] A two-water catalytic model was proposed and confirmed by an alternate method to track Kinesin-5 catalysis in real-time and in a kinesin protein in a different subfamily. [...] Two-water catalytic models also are proposed in a divergent motor protein, myosin, and observed experimentally in one of its crystal structures.|$|E
