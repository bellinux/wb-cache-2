Yet he {{understood}} what was said. <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> celebration held in Pakistan on his seventieth birthday. He kept staring at me. He had risen above praise. As I rose to leave he pressed my hand to express his feelings {{as if he wanted to}} thank everyone who had said kind words about him. Dr. Abdus Salam had deep love for Pakistan in spite of the fact that he was treated unfairly and indifferently by his own country. It became more and more difficult for him to come to Pakistan and this hurt him deeply. Now he has returned home finally, to rest in peace for ever in the soil that he loved so much. May be in the years to come we will rise above our prejudice and own him and give him, after his death, what we could not when he was alive. We Pakistanis may choose to ignore Dr. Salam, but the world at large will always remember him." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "It was Monsieur Haussmann who {{impressed}} me the most. It {{was a strange}} thing, but it was less his talents and his remarkable intelligence that appealed to me, but the defects in his character. I had {{in front of me}} one of the most extraordinary men of our time; big, strong, vigorous, energetic, {{and at the same time}} clever and devious, with a spirit full of resources. [...] This audacious man wasn't afraid to show who he was.... He told me all of his accomplishments during his administrative career, leaving out nothing; he could have talked for six hours without a break, since it was his favourite subject, himself. I wasn't at all displeased.... It seemed to me that he was exactly the man I needed to fight against the ideas and prejudices of a whole school of economics, against devious people and skeptics coming from the Stock Market, against those who were not very scrupulous about their methods; he was just the man. [...] Whereas a gentleman of the most elevated spirit, cleverness, with the most straight and noble character, would inevitably fail, this vigorous athlete... full of audacity and skill, capable of opposing expedients with better expedients, traps with more clever traps, would certainly succeed. <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> Paris works and offered to put him in charge." ...|$|E
60|$|Certainly he had, {{he assured}} me. <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> date {{and his head}} and {{shoulders}} disappeared into a cupboard. In a few minutes he withdrew them and called out sharply for his assistant.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>about</b> Mr. Medwin and the mumps. Jimmy seemed interested.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>about</b> Robinson, to {{encourage}} him, {{and the story}} made a great impression.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes. And when <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>about</b> your owning Prime Minister he got {{savage and}} {{declared}} that was the very reason why I shouldn't go." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "'They're {{drawing the}} tendrils of the octopus around Black Bill,' says I. And then <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> deputy sheriff, and how I'd {{described}} {{him to the}} deputy, and what the deputy said about the matter.|$|E
6000|$|... "So I spun him {{a regular}} yarn {{about the place}} and the people. <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> captain's wife, and she being an English woman, and how she was taken, which indeed was the way {{of most of the}} women there.|$|E
60|$|I {{called off}} the practice, {{somewhat}} worried about Rube's showing, and undecided {{whether or not}} to try him in the game that day. So I went to Radbourne, who had quietly watched Rube while on the field. Raddy was an old pitcher and had seen the rise of a hundred stars. <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> game at Rickettsville and what I thought of Rube, and frankly asked his opinion.|$|E
60|$|Jack's face, when <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>about</b> it, was so woebegone that I felt {{a stab of}} remorse, even in {{the heyday}} of my delight.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>about</b> Perry then, and Dian the Beautiful, and how my {{duty was}} to them first. Afterward I should return and visit him--if I could ever find his island.|$|R
6000|$|... "I meant {{his visit}} to the Farquhar {{homestead}} when <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>about</b> Lucy; but I'll try to answer you. For one reason, I wanted to make amends for my previous--rashness." ...|$|R
6000|$|... “He {{was getting}} {{known as a}} man who would have to be {{reckoned}} with; but he was short of money and was ready for a shot at anything that promised a few dollars. Clay never shirked a risk, but I believe he was honestly glad to see me, and in a moment of expansion <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> Snowy Creek mine and the gold that would be waiting for me when I could return.” ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{wanted a}} partner, so Andy and me {{agreed to go}} out together. <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> {{situation}} in Fisher Hill and how finances was low {{on account of the}} local mixture of politics and jalap. Andy had just got in on the train that morning. He was pretty low himself, and was going to canvass the whole town for a few dollars to build a new battleship by popular subscription at Eureka Springs. So we went out and sat on the porch and talked it over.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, he {{will see}} you," [...] said the soldier {{who had taken}} her message to the Wizard, [...] "although he does not like to have people ask to see him. Indeed, at first he was angry and said I should send you back where you came from. Then he asked me what you looked like, and when I {{mentioned}} your silver shoes {{he was very much}} interested. At last <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> mark upon your forehead, and he decided he would admit you to his presence." ...|$|E
60|$|When Steele and I {{were about}} to {{separate}} I remembered a party {{that was to be}} given by Miss Sampson, and <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>about</b> it. He shook his head sadly, almost doubtfully.|$|R
6000|$|... "Let {{me begin}} with what I hate most to remember, and so be the sooner done with it--let {{me begin with}} the paltry string of falsehoods which <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>about</b> my family troubles.|$|R
60|$|I {{remember}} that Perry {{was very much}} excited when <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>about</b> this Dead World, for he {{seemed to think that}} it explained the hitherto inexplicable phenomena of nutation and the precession of the equinoxes.|$|R
6000|$|... "The {{manager of}} your office had telegraphed down here,to {{know if you}} come on the boat," [...] said George, {{as soon as the}} boys gave him an {{opportunity}} to speak, [...] " [...] an' to pay your fare back if you was here. So when I told our manager, he knew all about it. Then when <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> other feller, he said folks in New York had been telegraphing all around the country for a boy by the name of Edward Hawley. Now you'd better come up to the office, an' everything'll be all right." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "After Baxter and I had {{finished}} our business <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> cot, for if we carried out Anita's plan {{it would be}} necessary for him to know where we were. Then, putting on waterproof coats, we rode over to the place which had excited my wife's desire to become a cotter. We found the house small but in good order, with four rooms and an adjunct at one end. There were vines growing over it, and at the side of it a garden--a garden with an irregular hedge around two sides; it was a poor sort of a garden, mostly weeds, I thought, as I glanced at it. The stream of water was a pretty little brook, and Baxter, who rode to the head of it, said he thought it could be made much better.|$|E
60|$|We entered, and I {{put before}} him my notions--such {{of them as}} I felt he would approve. We were some time about the business, and when we looked at our watches young Bute's last train to town had gone. There still {{remained}} much to talk about, and I suggested he should return {{with me to the}} cottage and take his luck. I could sleep with Dick and he could have my room. <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> cow, but he said he was a practised sleeper and would be delighted, if I could lend him a night-shirt, and if I thought Miss Robina would not be put out. I assured him {{that it would be a}} good thing for Robina; the unexpected guest would be a useful lesson to her in housekeeping. Besides, as I pointed out to him, it didn't really matter even if Robina were put out.|$|E
5000|$|... "It was all {{happening}} while I was on Bora Bora making The Hurricane," [...] said James. [...] "I {{spent a lot}} of {{time fishing}} with Tim Zinnemann, who was producing the picture. We became good friends and <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>about</b> Long Riders.|$|R
6000|$|... "If you'll {{come with}} me. He wants you too, you know. <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>about</b> you. He {{gave me his}} card," [...] Strether pursued, [...] "and his name's rather funny. It's John Little Bilham, and he says his two {{surnames}} are, {{on account of his}} being small, inevitably used together." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't know," [...] Jake {{answered}} thoughtfully. [...] "At first, I thought Kenwardine great, and I {{like him}} now. He certainly has charm and you can't believe much against him when he's with you; but it's somehow different at a distance. Still, {{he knew nothing}} about the attacks on you. I saw that when <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>about</b> them." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That came {{in right}} {{naturally}} when <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> trap, {{and that it}} must be set on the Roxbury shore. I simply asked him what boat Job Lord used when he made an excursion among the rebels on General Gage's business, and he at once pointed out a craft that lay alongside the wharf, saying it was the property of Master Lord. Well, that seemed to work in very reasonably, and I told him I reckoned I would bring it down along shore because it was necessary that what we did be kept secret even from those who served the king. He quite agreed with me, so the boat is within five minutes' walk of this house, and our friend, the sergeant, stands ready to help us leave town, because of the pass we have, at any time that may best suit our pleasure. Now do you think I went out to satisfy a whim, Luke Wright?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes; I see {{we never}} {{wanted to go back}} there to live, any of us, and I went up to pass the papers and close the thing out. Well, I did have an offer for it from a feller that wanted to open a boa'din'-house there and get the {{advantage}} of Jeff's improvements, and I couldn't seem to make up my mind till I'd looked the ground over. Fust off, you know, I thought I'd sell to the other feller, because I could see in a minute what a thorn it 'd be in Jeff's flesh. But, dumn it all! When I met the comical devil I couldn't seem to want to pester him. Why, here, thinks I, if we've made an escape from him--and I guess we have, about the biggest escape--what have I got ag'in' him, anyway? I'd ought to feel good to him; and I guess that's the way I did feel, come to boil it down. He's got a way with him, you know, when you're with him, that makes you like him. He may have a knife in your ribs the whole while, but so long's he don't turn it, you don't seem to know it, and you can't help likin' him. Why, I hadn't been with Jeff five minutes before I made up my mind to sell to him. <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> other offer--felt bound to do it--and he was all on fire. 'I want that place, Mr. Whitwell,' s'd he. 'Name your price.' Well, I wa'n't goin' to take an advantage of the feller, and I guess he see it. 'You've offered me three thousand,' s'd I, 'n' I don't want to be no ways mean about it. Five thousand buys the place.' 'It's mine,' s'd he; just like that. I guess he see he had a gentleman to deal with, and we didn't say a word more. Don't you think I done right to sell to him? I couldn't 'a' got more'n thirty-five hundred out the other feller, to save me, and before Jeff begun his improvements I couldn't 'a' realized a thousand dollars on the prop'ty." ...|$|E
5000|$|After {{the release}} of the debut album First and Last and Always in March 1985 band leader Andrew Eldritch {{intended}} to record an ABBA cover as a single. and tried to hire Jim Steinman as a producer: [...] "Originally I called him up in 1985 when the band had [...] "Gimme Gimme Gimme" [...] in the set, and <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> song and that our version of it had to be absolutely stupid. He agreed with me but he was busy at the time. Then the band broke up." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> all <b>about</b> {{it and how}} {{her first}} entreaties had {{referred}} to his forgiveness.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>about</b> my guide, for I {{was proud}} of what I had done, and my vanity for once got the heels of my prudence. At {{the mention of the}} five shillings he cried out so loud that I made up my mind I should say nothing of the other two, and was glad he could not see my blushes.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{stood up}} for you, and <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>about</b> Edith's runaway, and then he said, fair and square, that he didn't believe you stopped the horse. He said he guessed my sister pulled him up herself, and that then you came along and grabbed him and took all the credit. He said he thought you were that sort of a fellow.|$|R
5000|$|When {{the player}} begins the game, {{they see a}} {{coastline}} in Forget-Me-Not valley. Takakura, {{an old man who}} used to be the player's father's best friend, is speaking (or thinking) to their father, stating: [...] "He wasn't unhappy. But he didn't seem to have a direction in life. One day, I went to see him. <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> farm you left to him. Your son didn't seem to know much about farming, but he was willing to give it a try. So I brought him to Forget-Me-Not-Valley.". The player is then seen walking down the village with Takakura, and he explains how he and the player's father owned the farm. Soon, two dogs will appear the player chooses one to keep. Takakura agrees to show the player around the valley and introduce them to the villagers, including the eligible bachelorettes: Celia, Nami, and Muffy.|$|E

6000|$|... "Well, sir, all I {{could think}} of to do was {{to go out and get}} in the buggy. The horse turned round and took me back to the hotel. I hitched him and went in to see Andy.
