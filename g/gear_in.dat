5|$|Prior to the {{broadcast}} of Series 15 of Top <b>Gear</b> <b>in</b> 2010, the cast of Jeremy Clarkson, Richard Hammond and James May were spotted and recorded driving along the A303 {{in what appeared to}} be house cars. The video was recorded and put on YouTube.|$|E
5|$|The episode {{received}} {{very positive}} reviews from critics upon its release. Critics had often noted {{similarities between the}} episode and Top <b>Gear</b> <b>in</b> their reviews. It attracted nearly two million viewers in its first weekend of release and was eventually made available to non-Amazon Prime members for free viewing from 23 to 26 December 2016.|$|E
5|$|Designs were {{submitted}} {{in response to}} the Navy's specifications by Vought-Sikorsky and Curtiss-Wright. The Vought design, designated Model 403 by the company, was similar to the company's OS2U Kingfisher, which was then under development to replace the SOC aboard U.S. Navy battleships, but had its monoplane wing moved higher on the fuselage than that of the Kingfisher, and differed in the attachment method used by its single-float landing <b>gear.</b> <b>In</b> addition, the radial engine of the OS2U was replaced by an inline Ranger V-770 in a squared-off cowling.|$|E

5|$|O'Brien was {{commissioned}} into the United States Navy on 22 May 1915 {{under the command}} of Lieutenant Commander C. E. Courtney, after which she conducted her shakedown cruise between Newport, Rhode Island, and Hampton Roads, Virginia. In fleet exercises off New York in November, O'Brien collided with the destroyer , in a minor incident that carried away part of Draytons topmast and wireless <b>gear.</b> <b>In</b> December, she was assigned to the 5th Division, Torpedo Flotilla, Atlantic Fleet. From early 1916-spring of 1917, she operated with the Fleet along the East Coast and in Cuban waters.|$|E
5|$|Plutarch {{mentions}} that the Athenians saw the phantom of King Theseus, the mythical hero of Athens, leading {{the army in}} full battle <b>gear</b> <b>in</b> the charge against the Persians, and indeed he was depicted in the mural of the Stoa Poikile fighting for the Athenians, along with the twelve Olympian gods and other heroes. Pausanias also tells us that: They say too that there chanced {{to be present in}} the battle a man of rustic appearance and dress. Having slaughtered many of the foreigners with a plough he was seen no more after the engagement. When the Athenians made enquiries at the oracle, the god merely ordered them to honor Echetlaeus ("he of the Plough-tail") as a hero.|$|E
5|$|The Admiralty {{predicted}} that all Majestic-class carriers would require upgrades to their aircraft lifts and arrester <b>gear</b> <b>in</b> the early 1950s, {{to operate the}} faster and heavier carrier aircraft under development. Originally, the RAN wanted to upgrade Sydney to the same or similar standard as sister ship , after the second carrier was delivered. The installation of an angled flight deck and mirror landing aid, would have allowed Sydney to operate modern jet aircraft. However, financial and manpower restrictions led to the cancellation of this program.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results of a detailed two-dimensional analysis of the torsional stiffness of several pairs of spur <b>gears</b> <b>in</b> mesh using finite element methods. The model on which this research is based allows the generation of pairs of spur <b>gears</b> <b>in</b> contact with several different parameters and includes an adaptive meshing algorithm for the contact zones. The FEA results from the various model settings are used to develop a common formula for the combined torsional stiffness of spur <b>gears</b> <b>in</b> mesh. The torsional mesh stiffness of <b>gears</b> <b>in</b> mesh consists of three main components which are the body, teeth and contact stiffnesses. The introduced formula uses these three parts to determine the stiffness {{for a wide range of}} gear and gear ratio combinations...|$|R

5|$|The front {{landing gear}} is offset to the aircraft's right to allow {{placement}} of the 30mm cannon with its firing barrel along the centerline of the aircraft. During ground taxi, the offset front landing gear causes the A-10 to have dissimilar turning radii. Turning to the right on the ground takes less distance than turning left. The wheels of the main landing gear partially protrude from their nacelles when retracted, making gear-up belly landings easier to control and less damaging. All landing gears are hinged toward the aircraft's rear; if hydraulic power is lost, a combination of gravity and aerodynamic drag can open and lock the <b>gear</b> <b>in</b> place.|$|E
5|$|The {{game was}} {{released}} in November 1993 in both North America and Europe. An 8-bit version was released for the Game <b>Gear</b> <b>in</b> the same year and the Master System in the following year. Dr. Robotnik's Mean Bean Machine has also appeared in retrospective compilations, such as the Sonic Mega Collection for the Nintendo GameCube in 2002, Sonic Mega Collection Plus for the PlayStation 2 and Xbox in 2004; which also contains the Game Gear version, and Sega Mega Drive Ultimate Collection (known as Sonic's Ultimate Genesis Collection in North America) for PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 in 2009. In 2006, Sega released the game on the Wii's Virtual Console. In 2010, it was released on Microsoft Windows via Steam.|$|E
5|$|Wonder Boy III: The Dragon's Trap is a {{platforming}} and action-adventure {{video game}} developed by Westone {{as part of}} Sega's Wonder Boy series. It was published by Sega and released for the Sega Master System in 1989 and for the Game <b>Gear</b> <b>in</b> 1992 as Wonder Boy: The Dragon's Trap. It was ported by Hudson Soft in 1991(1990 in North America) and was released for the TurboGrafx-16/PC Engine under the name Dragon's Curse. It was also ported in 1993 by Brazilian company Tec Toy under the title Turma da Mônica em o Resgate, with the game retooled to include characters from Brazilian comic book series Monica's Gang (Turma da Mônica). A remake developed by Lizardcube and published by DotEmu, titled , was released in April 2017.|$|E

5000|$|L/1 and 2 <b>gears</b> <b>in</b> a full automatic: The MMT {{does not}} provide L/1 and 2 <b>gears</b> as <b>in</b> a full automatic. One action of the MMT system is that it detects the {{gradient}} of the slope that the car is situated in. On a down-sloping incline and if the brake pedal is depressed, it automatically selects a lower gear to produce engine brake, which has the equivalent effect of L and 2 <b>gears</b> <b>in</b> a full automatic. L and 2 can also be substituted with E1 and E2 (not available in Aygo) or M1 and M2 <b>gears</b> <b>in</b> a MMT car. To select E1 or E2, put the gear to E, and use + and - pedal flaps {{on the steering wheel}} to override the computer selection. E will change to E1/E2/E3/E4/E5/E6, depending on the gear selected. Downshift to E1 or E2 as appropriate to simulate L and 2 <b>gears</b> <b>in</b> a full automatic. To select M1 or M2, put the gear to M, and use M- gear to downshift the gear to M1 or M2.|$|R

5|$|As {{the crew}} {{attempted}} {{to extend the}} gear for landing, they encountered difficulties, since hydraulic power to the landing <b>gear</b> <b>in</b> that aircraft was normally supplied by the two right side engines, now shut down. The crew initially selected runway 33 for landing, then decided on runway 02, and when they realized they were too high for landing on runway 02, they decided to climb and go around for runway 33 again. While climbing on the two operating engines, with asymmetric thrust, the number one engine (outboard on left side) failed due to over-boosting, leading to a rapid loss of airspeed and eventual stall. The aircraft crashed into trees, and a fire broke out which engulfed the entire aircraft in flames and smoke. The captain and flight engineer were able to escape, but all others were trapped inside the wreckage and were overcome by carbon monoxide poisoning before they could exit, as later autopsies would reveal.|$|E
5|$|In {{the same}} year, Charles and Ames {{established}} the Holt Brothers Company in San Francisco. The company sold hardwood, lumber, and wagon and carriage materials, primarily manufacturing wagon axles, wheels, and frames. W.Harrison Holt and Ames both temporarily returned around 1871 to New Hampshire – where both were married – {{to manage the}} eastern business. The brothers built a factory in Concord, New Hampshire, to manufacture wagon wheels, wheel components, bodies and running <b>gear.</b> <b>In</b> 1872, at age 23, Benjamin was given an interest in his father's business, and he assumed more responsibility for the company's operations. W.Harrison Holt moved to Tiffin, Ohio, to manage the company's lumber business there, where he remained until the early 1880s. Their mother died in 1875, and their father died eight years later in 1883. After his father's death, Benjamin Holt left New Hampshire in 1883 to help Charles build the business in California.|$|E

5|$|Stocks off {{the eastern}} United States are {{severely}} overfished; a 2006 stock assessment {{survey by the}} U.S. National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) showed that its population had dropped to 1520% of 1970s levels. In 1997, the dusky shark {{was identified as a}} Species of Concern by the NMFS, meaning that it warranted conservation concern but there was insufficient information for listing on the U.S. Endangered Species Act (ESA). Commercial and recreational retention of dusky sharks was prohibited in 1998, but this has been of limited effectiveness due to high bycatch mortality on multi-species <b>gear.</b> <b>In</b> addition, some 2,000 dusky sharks were caught by recreational fishers in 2003 despite the ban. In 2005, North Carolina implemented a time/area closure to reduce the impact of recreational fishing. To aid conservation efforts, molecular techniques using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) have been developed that can identify whether marketed shark parts (e.g. fins) are from prohibited species like the dusky shark, versus similar allowed species such as the sandbar shark.|$|E
5|$|Tagliani ran {{in sixth}} gear after his team {{ordered him to}} {{conserve}} fuel {{and was unable to}} generate enough heat into his tires to challenge Andretti on the restarts. On lap 87, Fittipaldi tried an overtaking manoevure on Junqueira around the outside of turn three which resulted in Fittipaldi and Junqueira making contact and both drivers slid into the outside tire barrier. Andretti's lead of 7.4 seconds was reduced to nothing when the eleventh (and final) caution was displayed on the next lap to allow course officials to extract Fittipaldi's and Junquiera's cars from the track. Racing resumed on lap 90 with Andretti retaining the first position and pulled away {{from the rest of the}} field. Fernández's radio had malfunctioned and was in another <b>gear</b> <b>in</b> an attempt to save fuel which allowed Tagliani to pass him for second. However, Tagliani was unable to close the gap to Andretti because of the presence of Junqueira's lapped car which cost him more than two seconds. He drove on the track's dirty side on the backstraight and his tires were cleaned in the next five turns on the track.|$|E
5|$|The 3rd Birthday is a third-person {{role-playing}} shooter. The player controls series protagonist Aya Brea through rendered-to-scale {{environments in}} from a third person perspective. The game plays out {{as a series of}} missions, between which Aya rests at the Counter Twisted Investigation headquarters, which acts as the game's main hub. In the hub, Aya can receive briefings for missions, view additional documents, buy and customize new weapons. She also has the option to transport back there should she die during a mission. The game can be saved both at the hub and in safe zones within missions. At the end of each mission, Aya is given a grade based on performance, enemies killed, and the number of times she died.

5|$|The Jaguar is an {{orthodox}} single-seat, swept-wing, twin-engine monoplane design, with tall tricycle-type retractable landing <b>gear.</b> <b>In</b> its original configuration, {{it had a}} maximum take-off weight in the 15 tonne class; and could manage a combat radius on internal fuel alone of , giving the Jaguar a greater operational range than competitor aircraft such as the Mikoyan MiG-27. The aircraft had hardpoints fitted for an external weapons load of up to 10,000lb (4,500kg), typical weapons fitted included the MATRA LR.F2 rocket pod, BAP 100-mm bombs, MATRA AS37 anti-radar missiles, AIM-9 Sidewinder missiles, and Rockeye cluster bombs. The RAF's Jaguars gained several new weapons during the Gulf War, including CRV7 high-velocity rockets and American CBU-87 cluster bombs. Finally, the Jaguar was equipped with either a pair of French DEFA cannons, or alternatively British Aden cannons.|$|E
5|$|The climactic {{underwater}} {{battle was}} shot at Clifton Pier and was choreographed by Hollywood expert Ricou Browning, who had worked on Creature From the Black Lagoon in 1954 and other films. He {{was responsible for the}} staging of the cave sequence and the battle scenes beneath the Disco Volante and called in his specialist team of divers who posed as those engaged in the onslaught. Voit provided much of the underwater <b>gear</b> <b>in</b> exchange for product placement and film tie-in merchandise. Lamar Boren, an underwater photographer, was hired to shoot all of the sequences. United States Air Force Lieutenant Colonel Charles Russhon, who had already established Eon productions' rapports with the local authorities in Turkey for From Russia with Love (1963) and at Fort Knox for Goldfinger (1964), supplied the experimental rocket fuel used to destroy the Disco Volante. Russhon, using his position, was also able {{to gain access to the}} United States Navy's Fulton surface-to-air recovery system, used to lift Bond and Domino from the water at the end of the film. Filming ceased in May 1965, and the final scene shot was the physical fight on the bridge of the Disco Volante.|$|E
