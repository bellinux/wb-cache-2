5|$|Robert Wood, the {{engineer}} who {{signed off on}} {{the engineer}}ing report declaring the mall structurally sound just {{a few weeks before the}} roof collapse, was charged with two counts of criminal negligence causing death and one count of criminal negligence causing bodily harm. According to the inquiry, Wood had previously indicated in conversation that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>aware</b> <b>that</b> the roof was at risk of caving in, but altered his final report at Nazarian's request so that the structural issues did not jeopardize the building's refinancing. His trial began in September 2016.|$|E
5|$|The {{character}} was conceived by Edward Stratemeyer, {{founder of the}} Stratemeyer Syndicate. Stratemeyer had created the Hardy Boys series in 1926 (although the first volumes were not published until 1927), which {{had been such a}} success that he decided on a similar series for girls, featuring an amateur girl detective as the heroine. While Stratemeyer believed that a woman's place was in the home, <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>aware</b> <b>that</b> the Hardy Boys books were popular with girl readers and wished to capitalize on girls' interest in mysteries by offering a strong female heroine.|$|E
5|$|Estimates of {{the number}} of Serbs killed on 11–13 May vary. Historians Jozo Tomasevich and Ivo Goldstein put the number at 260. Historians Sabrina P. Ramet and Marko Attila Hoare {{estimate}} that about 300 Serbs were massacred while historian Davide Rodogno puts the number at 417 killed. On 14 May, the Archbishop of Zagreb, Aloysius Stepinac, sent a letter of protest to Pavelić after receiving news of the killings. He failed to condemn the atrocity publicly. The next day, Pavelić visited Rome and was granted a private audience with Pope Pius XII, who offered de facto recognition of the NDH on behalf of the Holy See. Although <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>aware</b> <b>that</b> Pavelić was a totalitarian dictator, {{there is no evidence that}} he had knowledge of the first Glina massacre at the time.|$|E

5|$|In {{the early}} 1980s, Morrissey {{developed}} a filmmaking craft at the Rathbone Theatre Workshop, a Youth Opportunities Programme that taught school-leavers skills for a year. With the workshop, Morrissey shot short silent films on Super 8, {{where he was}} taught by Bert Byron, who introduced him to US Independent and foreign films for the first time. Although the scheme paid £23.50 a week and took young people off unemployment benefits, Morrissey reflected in 2009 {{that many of the}} participants were just used as lackeys. After his acting career escalated, he started directing because <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>aware</b> <b>that,</b> as an actor, he was coming into a project quite late into development and then leaving before post-production, and he wanted to see a film through to the end. Morrissey has said that he prefers to keep acting and directing separate, and would not direct anything he is acting in.|$|E
5|$|As they left, {{thousands}} of National Guardsmen {{who had heard}} the news were assembling at the Place de Grève. The Marquis de Lafayette, in Paris as their commander-in-chief, discovered to his dismay that his soldiers were largely {{in favor of the}} march and were being egged on by agitators to join in. Even though he was one of France's greatest war heroes, Lafayette could not dissuade his troops and they began threatening to desert. Rather than see them leave as another anarchic mob, the Parisian municipal government told Lafayette to guide their movements; they also instructed him to request that the king return voluntarily to Paris to satisfy the people. Sending a swift horseman forward to warn Versailles, Lafayette contemplated the near mutiny of his men: <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>aware</b> <b>that</b> many of them had openly promised to kill him if he did not lead or get out of the way. At four o'clock in the afternoon, fifteen thousand guards with several thousand more civilian latecomers set off for Versailles. Lafayette reluctantly took his place at the head of their column, hoping to protect the king and public order.|$|E

5|$|Banks {{was born}} in Sheffield, West Riding of Yorkshire, and {{brought up in the}} working-class area of Tinsley. The family later moved to the village of Catcliffe after his father set up a (then-illegal) betting shop. This brought greater {{prosperity}} but also misery; one day Banks's disabled brother was mugged for the shop's daily takings, and died of his injuries some weeks later. Banks left school in December 1952 and took up employment as a bagger with a local coal merchant, which helped to build up his upper body strength. He spent a season playing for amateur side Millspaugh F.C. after their regular goalkeeper failed to turn up for a match; the club's trainer spotted Banks amongst the spectators and invited him to play in goal as <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>aware</b> <b>that</b> Banks had previously played for Sheffield Schoolboys. His performances there earned him a game in the Yorkshire League for Rawmarsh Welfare, however a 12–2 defeat to Stocksbridge Works on his debut was followed by a 3–1 home defeat, and he was dropped by Rawmarsh and returned to Millspaugh. Still aged 15, he then switched jobs to become a hod carrier.|$|E

25|$|In these interviews, Morton {{claimed to}} have been born in 1885. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>aware</b> <b>that</b> if he had been born in 1890, he would have been {{slightly}} too young to make a good case for being the inventor of jazz. He {{said in an interview that}} Buddy Bolden played ragtime but not jazz, a view not accepted by Bolden's other New Orleans contemporaries. The contradictions may stem from different definitions of the terms ragtime and jazz. These interviews, released in different forms over the years, were released on an eight-CD boxed set in 2005, The Complete Library of Congress Recordings. The collection won two Grammy Awards. The same year, Morton was honored with the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award.|$|E

25|$|His {{account of}} the Rus is an {{important}} early source {{for the study of}} Russian history. Again, while he may have read such earlier Arabic authors as ibn Khurradad, ibn al-Faqih, ibn Rusta and ibn Fadlan, al-Mas‘udi presented most of his material based on his personal observations and contacts made while traveling. He informed the Arabic reader that the Rus were more than just a few traders. They were a diverse and varied collection of peoples. He noted their independent attitude, the absence of a strong central authority among them and their paganism. He was very well informed on Rus trade with the Byzantines and on the competence of the Rus in sailing merchant vessels and warships. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>aware</b> <b>that</b> the Black Sea and the Caspian Sea are two separate bodies of water.|$|E
25|$|After having {{resigned}} as Prime Minister of France, he left politics. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>aware</b> <b>that</b> {{the link between}} himself and public life was broken forever, and he never made the slightest attempt to renew it.

His two daughters, who married two descendants of the illustrious Dutch family of De Witt, so congenial in faith and manners to the Huguenots of France, kept his house. One of his sons-in-law farmed the estate. And here Guizot devoted his later years with undiminished energy to literary labour, which was in fact his chief means of subsistence. Proud, independent, simple and contented he remained to the last; and these years of retirement were perhaps the happiest and most serene portion of his life.|$|E
25|$|Mussolini {{had sought}} to delay a major war in Europe until at least 1942, but Germany invaded Poland on 1 September 1939.

On 10 June 1940—with the Fall of France imminent—Italy officially entered the war on the side of Germany, though <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>aware</b> <b>that</b> Italy did not have the military capacity and resources to carry out a long war with the British Empire. Mussolini believed that after the imminent French armistice, Italy could gain territorial concessions from France and then he could concentrate his forces on a major offensive in North Africa, where British and Commonwealth forces were outnumbered by Italian forces. However, the UK government refused to accept proposals for a peace that would involve accepting Axis victories in Eastern and Western Europe, plans for an invasion of the UK did not proceed and the war continued. In the summer of 1941, Mussolini sent Italian forces to participate in the invasion of the Soviet Union and war with the United States followed in December.|$|E

25|$|For his self-defence, Socrates first {{eliminates}} {{any claim}} {{that he is a}} wise man. He says that Chaerephon, reputed to be impetuous, went to the Oracle of Delphi and asked her, the Pythia, to tell him of anyone who was wiser than Socrates. The Pythia answered to Chaerephon that there was no man wiser. On learning of that oracular pronouncement, Socrates says he was astounded, because, on the one hand, it is against the nature of the Oracle to lie, but, on the other hand, he knew he was not wise. Therefore, Socrates sought to find someone wiser than himself, so that he could take that person as evidence to the Oracle at Delphi. Hence why Socrates minutely queried everyone who appeared to be a wise person. In that vein, he tested the minds of politicians, poets, and scholars, for wisdom; although he occasionally found genius, Socrates found no one who possessed wisdom; yet, each man was thought wise by the people, and each man thought himself wise; therefore, he (Socrates) was the better man, because <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>aware</b> <b>that</b> he was not wise.|$|E
25|$|The Bastarnae first {{appear in}} the {{historical}} record in 179 BC, when they crossed the Danube in massive force. They did so {{at the invitation of}} their long-time ally, king Philip V of Macedon, a direct descendant of Antigonus, one of the Diadochi, the generals of Alexander the Great who had shared out his empire after his death in 323 BC. The Macedonian king had suffered a disastrous defeat {{at the hands of the}} Romans in the Second Macedonian War (200-197 BC), which had reduced him from a powerful Hellenistic monarch to the status of a petty client-king with a much-reduced territory and a tiny army. After nearly 20 years of slavish adherence to the Roman Senate's dictats, Philip had been goaded beyond endurance by the incessant and devastating raiding of the Dardani, a warlike Thraco-Illyrian tribe on his northern border, which his treaty-limited army was too small to counter effectively. Counting on the Bastarnae, with whom he had forged friendly relations in earlier times, he plotted a strategy to deal with the Dardani and then to regain his lost territories in Greece and his political independence. First, he would unleash the Bastarnae against the Dardani. After the latter had been crushed, Philip planned to settle Bastarnae families in Dardania (southern Kosovo/Skopje region), to ensure that the region was permanently subdued. In a second phase, Philip aimed to launch the Bastarnae on an invasion of Italy via the Adriatic coast. Although <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>aware</b> <b>that</b> the Bastarnae were hardly likely to achieve the same success as Hannibal some 40 years earlier, and would most likely end up cut to pieces by the Romans, Philip hoped that the Romans would be distracted long enough to allow him to reoccupy his former possessions in Greece.|$|E
