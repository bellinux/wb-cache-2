5|$|By {{the time}} the AirTrain case appeal was decided in October 2000, two-thirds of the system's viaduct {{structures}} had been constructed already. The system was ready for its first test trains by December 2000. The state spent $75 million to renovate the Howard Beach station, which brought it into ADA compliance and facilitated passengers' transfers {{to and from the}} AirTrain. The new Howard Beach station was completed in May 2001. The Port Authority also contributed $100 million toward the renovation of the Jamaica LIRR station, with the State of New York paying {{for the rest of the}} $387 million project. The purpose of this renovation was, in part, to facilitate AirTrain connections. The renovation of the Jamaica station started in May 2001 upon the completion of the Howard Beach station. By this time, the system's guideway rails were complete and the <b>guideways</b> were being constructed. The first two AirTrain cars were delivered in March 2001 and were undergoing testing at the AirTrain maintenance facility near Lefferts Boulevard. The <b>guideways</b> were completed in August 2001. However, a parking structure, proposed near the Jamaica terminal as part of a long-term plan to redevelop downtown Jamaica, was largely unfunded by 2002, the year the AirTrain was originally supposed to open.|$|E
25|$|<b>Guideways</b> {{were made}} of {{concrete}} and based on highway construction techniques. The varying topography of the airport resulted in both aerial and ground level <b>guideways</b> winding their way over and under public roadways. As the guideway entered the semicircular terminals or remote parking areas, it remained at ground/ramp level and under the terminal building. At these terminal areas the guideway branched out to serve various stations, bypass tracks and vehicle storage sidings. Additional bypass <b>guideways</b> were constructed as the airport expanded. At several locations along the guideway tug sidings were located near the airport service road, allowing a disabled vehicle {{to be removed from}} the guideway and towed to the maintenance facility.|$|E
25|$|Vehicle weight {{influences}} {{the size and}} cost of a system's <b>guideways,</b> which are in turn {{a major part of}} the capital cost of the system. Larger vehicles are more expensive to produce, require larger and more expensive <b>guideways,</b> and use more energy to start and stop. If vehicles are too large, point-to-point routing also becomes more expensive. Against this, smaller vehicles have more surface area per passenger (thus have higher total air resistance which dominates the energy cost of keeping vehicles moving at speed), and larger motors are generally more efficient than smaller ones.|$|E
25|$|Personal {{rapid transit}} (PRT), also called {{personal}} automated transport (PAT), {{is a public}} transportation concept that offers on-demand, non-stop transportation, using small, independent vehicles on a network of specially built <b>guideways.</b>|$|E
25|$|The low {{weight of}} PRT's small {{vehicles}} allows smaller <b>guideways</b> and support structures than mass transit systems like light rail. The smaller structures translate into lower construction costs, smaller easements, and less visually obtrusive infrastructure.|$|E
25|$|The trains on the LRT {{system are}} fitted with rubber tyres, rather than steel wheels, on specially-constructed <b>guideways</b> from which its power is also sourced. All cars are fully {{automated}} and driverless, and are controlled from their respective depots.|$|E
25|$|Another {{option is}} the use of {{alternative}} fuel composition in conventional fossil fuel-based vehicles, making them function partially on renewable energy sources. Other approaches include personal rapid transit, a public transportation concept that offers automated, on-demand, non-stop transportation on a network of specially built <b>guideways.</b>|$|E
25|$|Personal {{rapid transit}} (PRT), also {{referred}} to as podcars, is a public transport mode featuring small automated vehicles operating on a network of specially built <b>guideways.</b> PRT is a type of automated guideway transit (AGT), a class of system which also includes larger vehicles all the way to small subway systems.|$|E
25|$|If {{safety or}} access {{considerations}} require {{the addition of}} walkways, ladders, platforms or other emergency/disabled access to or egress from PRT <b>guideways,</b> {{the size of the}} guideway may be increased. This may impact the feasibility of a PRT system, though the degree of impact would depend on both the PRT design and the municipality.|$|E
25|$|LTV's (Vought) Airtrans was an {{automated}} people mover system that operated at Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport between 1974 and 2005. The adaptable people mover was utilized for several separate systems: the Airport Train, Employee Train, American Airlines TrAAin and utility service. All systems utilized the same <b>guideways</b> and vehicle base but served different stations to create various routes.|$|E
25|$|PRT {{vehicles}} are sized for individual or small group travel, typically carrying {{no more than}} three to six passengers per vehicle. <b>Guideways</b> are arranged in a network topology, with all stations located on sidings, and with frequent merge/diverge points. This allows for nonstop, point-to-point travel, bypassing all intermediate stations. The point-to-point service has been compared to a taxi or a horizontal lift (elevator).|$|E
25|$|Computer control {{eliminates}} errors {{from human}} drivers, so PRT designs {{in a controlled}} environment should be much safer than private motoring on roads. Most designs enclose the running gear in the guideway to prevent derailments. Grade-separated <b>guideways</b> would prevent conflict with pedestrians or manually controlled vehicles. Other public transit safety engineering approaches, such as redundancy and self-diagnosis of critical systems, are also included in designs.|$|E
25|$|After 30 {{years of}} service the system's 1970s {{technology}} was no longer adequate for the expanding airport's needs, and in 2005 it {{was replaced by the}} current Skylink system. While most of the system was auctioned and sold for scrap, some <b>guideways</b> and stations (some of which are still open to the public) remain. Airtrans moved nearly 5 million people in its first year of operation; by the end of its life it had served over 250 million passengers.|$|E
25|$|The above {{discussion}} compares line or corridor {{capacity and}} may therefore not be relevant for a networked PRT system, where several parallel lines (or parallel {{components of a}} grid) carry traffic. In addition, Muller estimated that while PRT may need more than one guideway to match the capacity of a conventional system, the capital cost of the multiple <b>guideways</b> may still be {{less than that of}} the single guideway conventional system. Thus comparisons of line capacity should also consider the cost per line.|$|E
25|$|In 1992, a dark ride {{attraction}} {{known as}} Phantom Theater {{was added to}} the park's lineup. It utilized an Omnimover system to transport riders through specially-themed rooms resembling a behind-the-scenes tour of a haunted theater. Previously, the building housed the Enchanted Voyage (1972–1983) and Smurf's Enchanted Voyage (1984–1991), both Old Mill dark rides that used unaccompanied boats floating along water-filled <b>guideways.</b> After a couple theme changes in 2003 and 2010, Phantom Theater became known as Boo Blasters on Boo Hill.|$|E
25|$|The {{concept of}} having rail lines which could bring people from {{door to door}} without {{requiring}} the use of road-based buses was much favoured by the government transport planners, especially with the increased emphasis on a rail-based public transport network. For intra town travel, LRTs were favoured over buses because trains run on dedicated elevated <b>guideways,</b> bypassing any traffic congestion and traffic lights on the roads, and do not add to road traffic. Train arrival and departure times are also almost guaranteed this way. It is also cleaner as the trains are electrically powered, and therefore lessens the effects of air pollution.|$|E
25|$|Around {{the same}} time, Edward Haltom was {{studying}} monorail systems. Haltom {{noticed that the}} time to start and stop a conventional large monorail train, {{like those of the}} Wuppertal Schwebebahn, meant that a single line could only support between 20 and 40 vehicles an hour. In order to get reasonable passenger movements on such a system, the trains had to be large enough to carry hundreds of passengers (see headway for a general discussion). This, in turn, demanded large <b>guideways</b> that could support the weight of these large vehicles, driving up capital costs {{to the point where he}} considered them unattractive.|$|E
25|$|There is {{some debate}} over the best type of guideway. Proposals include beams similar to monorails, bridge-like trusses {{supporting}} internal tracks, and cables embedded in a roadway. Most designs put the vehicle {{on top of the}} track, which reduces visual intrusion and cost as well as easing ground-level installation. An overhead track is necessarily higher, but may also be narrower. Most designs use the guideway to distribute power and data communications, including to the vehicles. The Morgantown PRT failed its cost targets because of its steam-heated track, so most proposals plan to resist snow and ice in ways that should be less expensive. Masdar's system has been limited because it attempted to dedicate ground-level to PRT <b>guideways.</b> This led to unrealistically expensive buildings and roads.|$|E
25|$|As the {{original}} lifetime {{of the vehicles}} approached, DFW started studying replacing the system. As LTV had long exited the transit business, and no other companies offered similar AGT systems that could be adapted to the existing network, an entirely new system was needed and eventually won by the Bombardier Innovia APM 200. Since the system required entirely new <b>guideways,</b> the Airtrans system {{would have to be}} kept operational while the new system was installed. A mid-life upgrade process, mostly guideway improvements, was implemented in 1998. Passenger operations started to wind down in 2003, replaced by a shuttle bus service. Employee Train operations ended on 9 May 2005, followed by TrAAin on 20 May. The new Skylink service opened the next day.|$|E
25|$|In 1976 Vought {{was awarded}} a $7 million {{contract}} by the Urban Mass Transit Administration to study modifications needed to produce a version of Airtrans suitable for mass transit applications. Changes were aimed primarily at increasing the speed from 17 to 30mph, along with changes to reduce capital costs of implementing systems. Vought used one of the production cargo vehicles as an instrumented testbed, running it on the existing DFW <b>guideways</b> at increased speeds, and used the information collected to determine what changes {{would need to be}} made to provide this performance in an operational setting. Several changes were needed; the power collection arms that pressed against the wires on the track side had to be modified to a design originally considered for the DFW system, the steering had to be upgraded in order to switch quickly enough, and to improve energy use, the new vehicles also featured regenerative braking. A non-mechanical steering system reading a ferrous stripe {{in the center of the}} guideway was also tried, but abandoned as not necessary for speeds up to 30mph.|$|E
500|$|The {{system is}} mostly {{elevated}}. The elevated portions were built with precast single and dual guideways; the underground sections using cut-and-cover, and the at-grade sections using concrete ties and ballast trackbeds. The single <b>guideways</b> are [...] wide and the double <b>guideways</b> are [...] wide. Columns support the precast concrete elevated sections at intervals {{of no more}} than [...] The system has seven electrical substations to ensure {{that in the case of}} power outages at one substation, trains could still operate. The elevated structures were designed for resistance to minor seismic events, utilizing seismic isolation bearings and soundproof barriers to protect from small earthquakes as well as prevent noise pollution. The AirTrain uses steel tracks that are continuously welded across all joints except at the terminals; the elevated <b>guideways</b> are also continuously joined. Double crossovers are used at Jamaica and Howard Beach to terminate trains. There are also crossover switches north and south of Federal Circle, counterclockwise from Terminal 8, and clockwise from Terminal 1. In case of an emergency, a control tower would run the train to the next stop, where passengers would be able to disembark, as there are no emergency exits between stations.|$|E
500|$|The total {{route length}} {{of the system is}} , with the terminal-area loop being [...] The system {{consists}} of [...] of single-track <b>guideways</b> and [...] of double-track <b>guideways.</b> The tracks are set at a gauge of [...] This enables possible future conversion to LIRR or subway use, or a possible connection to LIRR or subway tracks for a one-trip ride into Manhattan. However, the current rolling stock are not qualified to use either LIRR or subway tracks due to the AirTrain rolling stock's inadequate structural strength and differing method of propulsion. In particular, the linear induction motor system that propels the AirTrain vehicles cannot be used on LIRR and subway tracks because these are manually propelled by electric motors. If a one-seat ride is ever implemented, a hybrid-use vehicle would be needed to operate on both subway/LIRR and AirTrain tracks.|$|E
2500|$|Vukan R. Vuchic, {{professor}} of Transportation Engineering at the University of Pennsylvania and {{a proponent of}} traditional forms of transit, has stated his belief {{that the combination of}} small vehicles and expensive guideway makes it highly impractical in both cities (not enough capacity) and suburbs (guideway too expensive). According to Vuchic: [...] "...the PRT concept combines two mutually incompatible elements of these two systems: very small vehicles with complicated <b>guideways</b> and stations. Thus, in central cities, where heavy travel volumes could justify investment in <b>guideways,</b> vehicles would be far too small to meet the demand. In suburbs, where small vehicles would be ideal, the extensive infrastructure would be economically unfeasible and environmentally unacceptable." ...|$|E
2500|$|This report {{dismissed}} {{the use of}} local arterials for line-haul purposes, due {{to the cost of}} aerial or tunnel <b>guideways.</b> [...] "A guideway extending from El Cajon easterly (parallel to I-8) to the vicinity of I-5/Santa Fe Railroad, then southerly through Centre City to San Ysidro parallel to I-5 and SD" [...] was recommended as the first increment. As planning intensified, Phase II of the [...] "Guideway Planning Project" [...] was under way, with efforts initially focusing on the El Cajon Line with the higher ridership potential. [...] However, nature intervened.|$|E
2500|$|Skylink {{replaced}} the original Airtrans system (part {{of which was}} later operated as American Airlines' TrAAin System), a state-of-the-art people mover {{at the time of}} the airport's opening. It served the airport for 31 years from 1974–2005 and transported a quarter of a billion passengers between DFW's four terminals and employee facilities, logging a total of [...] on its fleet. Over time, its top speed of [...] and uni-directional guideway made it impractical for connecting passenger transfers. The system was decommissioned soon after Skylink opened as a modern replacement; the old <b>guideways</b> were left in place throughout the airport.|$|E
2500|$|SkyTrain is the {{metropolitan}} rail system of Greater Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. SkyTrain has [...] of track and uses fully automated trains on grade-separated tracks running on underground and elevated <b>guideways,</b> allowing SkyTrain to hold consistently high on-time reliability. The name, SkyTrain, was coined {{for the system}} during Expo 86 because the first line (Expo) principally runs on elevated guideway outside of Downtown Vancouver, providing panoramic views of {{the metropolitan}} area. SkyTrain has the world's longest cable-supported transit-only bridge, known as SkyBridge, to cross the Fraser River. With {{the opening of the}} Evergreen Extension on December 2, 2016, SkyTrain is now the longest rapid transit system in Canada, and the longest fully automated driverless system in the world.|$|E
2500|$|Airtrans was {{operated}} over {{a number}} of fixed routes throughout the airport. Each route could be modified using different stations, <b>guideways</b> and vehicle configurations. Conversion of the system to offer point-to-point service like a true group rapid transit system was considered but not implemented, although all stations contained bypass tracks or vehicles could proceed through lower-demand stations without stopping. The flexibility of the system resulted in routes that changed often to serve different airline and passenger needs. While initially planned for [...] "origin and destination" [...] traffic, the system was modified to move connecting passengers (although never very effectively due to its uni-directional operation). The initial service specifications allowed for a maximum inter-terminal trip of 20 minutes, and 30 minutes to remote parking.|$|E
2500|$|Haltom {{turned his}} {{attention}} to developing a system that could operate with shorter timings, thereby allowing the individual cars to be smaller while preserving the same overall route capacity. Smaller cars would mean less weight at any given point, which meant smaller and less expensive <b>guideways.</b> To eliminate the backup at stations, the system used [...] "offline" [...] stations that allowed the mainline traffic to bypass the stopped vehicles. He designed the Monocab system using six-passenger cars suspended on wheels from an overhead guideway. Like most suspended systems, it suffered from the problem of difficult switching arrangements. Since the car rode on a rail, switching from one path to another required the rail to be moved, a slow process that limited the possible headways.|$|E
2500|$|A Japanese {{consortium}} {{led by the}} Central Japan Railway Company (JR Central) {{has been}} researching new high-speed rail systems based on magnetic levitation since the 1970s. Although the trains and <b>guideways</b> are technologically ready and over 100,000people have ridden them, high costs remains as barriers. Pre-series L0 series trains on the Yamanashi Test Line have reached speeds of [...] (crewed), making them the fastest trains in the world. The Yamanashi test track is to {{be incorporated into the}} eventual Tokyo – Osaka maglev route, called the Chuo Shinkansen. There has been preliminary approval for the Nagoya - Tokyo section with planned completion in 2027. The route is to be privately financed through bond sales by JR Central, but the intermediate stations will be financed by local governments. Construction of extensions to the Yamanashi test track is ongoing, and final routing of the line is being litigated. The Nagoya - Osaka section is projected to be completed in 2045, but no firm planning is underway. JR Central expects at least 8 years between the completion of the Tokyo section and the start of construction of the Osaka to rebuild its financial position. The federal government is exploring options to accelerate the project.|$|E
5000|$|Each line {{consists}} of two <b>guideways</b> that carry a three-car train each. The trains simply shuttle {{back and forth between}} the terminal and their respective airsides.

50|$|Ford Research {{proposed}} a dual-mode system called PRISM. It would use public <b>guideways</b> with privately purchased but certified dual-mode vehicles. The vehicles would weigh less than 600 kg. Most energy use occurs on highways, so small, elevated <b>guideways</b> would inductively power highway use and recharge batteries for off-guideway use. Central computers could do routing.|$|E
50|$|The work {{to create}} the guiedway took over a year to {{complete}} The combination of bus-only <b>guideways,</b> dedicated bus lanes, modern bus stops and shelters, and a fleet of modern, low floor buses specially adapted {{to run in the}} <b>guideways,</b> will mean passengers can enjoy more reliable services, improved surroundings, better ride quality and quicker journey times.|$|E

50|$|One {{problem with}} all {{elevated}} transportation system structures in general, {{is that the}} <b>guideways</b> (highways or transit) are widely {{considered to be an}} eyesore. In order {{to reduce the size of}} the <b>guideways,</b> Cabinentaxi took the uncommon approach of optionally allowing its cars to run on the top or bottom of a single track. The cars could not be switched from top to bottom, however. If this option was used, the <b>guideways</b> were supported on pillars that attached to the track from the side, rather than directly below. Cabinentaxi's guideway is noticeably smaller and thinner than conventional elevated systems, like the Vancouver SkyTrain. The track is approximately six feet wide, slightly smaller than a row of parking spots on the side of a city street.|$|E
