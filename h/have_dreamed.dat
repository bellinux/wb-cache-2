Now, at last, I {{can tell you that}} we are going on the voyage which all submariners <b>have</b> <b>dreamed</b> of ever since they possessed the means of doing so. We have the ship and we have the crew. We’re going around the world, nonstop. And we’re going to do it entirely submerged.|$|E
25|$|The {{building}} of a canal was an old idea. Numerous and sometimes utopian projects were devised to build a canal between the Atlantic Ocean and the Mediterranean Sea. Leaders such as Augustus, Nero, Charlemagne, François I, Charles IX and Henry IV <b>have</b> <b>dreamed</b> of it {{as it is a}} true political and economic issue. King François I brought Leonardo da Vinci to France in 1516 and commissioned a survey of a route from the Garonne at Toulouse to the Aude at Carcassonne.|$|E
25|$|Thus Gregory VII, as a {{politician}} wanting to achieve some result, was driven in practice to adopt a different standpoint. He acknowledged {{the existence of the}} state as a dispensation of Providence, described the coexistence of church and state as a divine ordinance, and emphasized the necessity of union between the sacerdotium and the imperium. But at no period would he <b>have</b> <b>dreamed</b> of putting the two powers on an equal footing; the superiority of church to state was to him a fact which admitted of no discussion and which he had never doubted.|$|E

500|$|Petar ruled {{at peace}} with the Bulgars, though he was {{probably}} not happy with his subordinate position, and may <b>have</b> <b>dreamed</b> of reasserting his independence.

500|$|Midway {{through the}} first part with its {{rattling}} drums and 'cacophonous' effects a genuine panic broke out. Around {{a quarter of the}} audience rushed for the exits with confusion and anger written over their faces, and those who remained tried to hiss down the 'spectacle', while the conductor Georg Schnéevoigt drove the orchestra to extremes of volume. This whole intermezzo underlined the humoristic-burlesque element in the symphony {{in such a way that}} Carl Nielsen could certainly never <b>have</b> <b>dreamed</b> of. His representation of modern life with its confusion, brutality and struggle, all the uncontrolled shouts of pain and ignorance—and behind it all the side drum's harsh rhythm as the only disciplining force—as the public fled, made a touch of almost diabolic humour.|$|E

500|$|Despite {{differences}} over {{the quality of}} the film, critics were in agreement that the film had drawn attention to von Stauffenberg's cause. It was applauded [...] "both as a history lesson and as a film". Tobias Kniebe of the Süddeutsche Zeitung described the film as [...] "maybe not the masterpiece we might <b>have</b> <b>dreamed</b> of ... but not much less", a sentiment shared by many German critics. The public-service German television channel ZDF called Valkyrie [...] "neither scandalously bad nor the event of the century.... Neither is it the action thriller we feared, but it is a well-made and serious film." [...] The newspaper Kölner Stadt-Anzeiger reported that any fear that the [...] "myth of the German resistance would be put through a Hollywood filter {{has turned out to be}} wrong and prejudicial".|$|E
500|$|UGO Networks writer Jon Lachonis stated, [...] "If {{you were}} on the fence before, [...] will drag you kicking and {{screaming}} into the dark world of Fringe science wielding bogeymen. [...] "In Which we Meet Mr. Jones" [...] is what Fringe promised it would be from the beginning, a suspense driven procedural that probes deep into our technological phobias. With this new formulation of Fringe, we get the challenge of a sophisticated crime drama mixed with sad sack characters that tempt the everyman into the game, while blowing us away with a level of wordplay and pseudo science that CSI or Alias could only <b>have</b> <b>dreamed</b> of." [...] The A.V. Club's Noel Murray enjoyed the episode, giving it a B+, while Television Without Pity gave the episode a B-.|$|E
500|$|In {{addition}} to his cartooning, Davenport is remembered for playing {{a key role in}} bringing some of the earliest desertbred or asil Arabian horses to America. [...] A longtime admirer of horses, Davenport stated in 1905, [...] "I <b>have</b> <b>dreamed</b> of Arabian horses all my life." [...] He had been captivated by the beauty of the Arabians brought to the Chicago Columbian Exposition in 1893. Upon learning that these horses had remained in America and had been sold at auction, he sought them out, finding most of the surviving animals in 1898 in the hands of millionaire fertilizer magnate Peter Bradley of Hingham, Massachusetts. [...] Davenport bought some Arabian horses outright between 1898 and 1905, paying $8,500 for one stallion, but he later partnered with Bradley in the horse business. Among his purchases, he managed to gather {{all but one of the}} surviving horses that had been a part of the Chicago Exhibition.|$|E

In her review of the episode Tainted Obligation she wrote [...] "I felt for Meredith, but after Lexie's heartfelt begging and pleading, I was happy that Mere finally grows up and casts her selfishness aside. Three seasons ago Meredith would never <b>have</b> <b>dreamed</b> of putting Lexie first, and I was proud of her for giving up part of her liver—her offer to get to know her dad was an even bigger milestone." [...] Reviewing {{the first part of the}} eighth season, TV Fanatic lauded the character and wrote: [...] "this season belongs to Meredith Grey. She is the heart and soul of the show and has been outstanding. This is a character that used to be so dark and twisty and has now grown into a more mature woman. Ellen Pompeo has been at the top of her game this season." ...|$|E

Cinema Blend Amanda Krill found Yang [...] "babyish" [...] and [...] "whiny".|$|E
500|$|In 2008, he portrayed Pontius Pilate in The Passion, a BBC/HBO {{adaptation}} of the {{last week in the}} life of Jesus. He had originally rejected the script due to other filming commitments, but accepted the role after his agent told him to re-read it before making a final decision. He was pleased to learn that the serial was being produced by Nigel Stafford-Clark, whose Bleak House adaptation he had enjoyed, and that he would be appearing with his Jekyll co-star Denis Lawson. Contrary to previous portrayals of Pilate, Nesbitt played the biblical figure as [...] "nice", and—as when playing Jack Parlabane—used his own accent. The serial was broadcast in the UK during Easter week 2008. Shortly after filming The Passion, he filmed the part of journalist Max Raban in the Carnival Films thriller Midnight Man, which was shown on ITV in May 2008. It won him a joint nomination (along with the 2007 series of Murphy's Law) for the ITV3 Crime Thriller Award for Best Actor. At the end of the year, he had a starring role in the low-budget independent film Blessed. The writer and director Mark Aldridge scripted the character of Peter with Nesbitt in mind to play him. The film had a limited release throughout 2008 and 2009 before the BBC screened it on television in 2010. Nesbitt said, [...] "The role of Peter is what I <b>have</b> <b>dreamed</b> about playing, you wait your whole life for an opportunity like this and when it comes you have to grab it." ...|$|E

2500|$|Ironically, it was Ry Cooder who {{underlined}} {{the obvious}} proximity between Harrison's slide sound and Indian phrasing.
