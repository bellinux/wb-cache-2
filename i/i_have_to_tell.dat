25|$|If {{the reader}} has also {{received}} {{the benefit of}} the Vedas, the access to which by means of the Upanishads is in my eyes the greatest privilege which this still young century (1818) may claim before all previous centuries, if then the reader, I say, has received his initiation in primeval Indian wisdom, and received it with an open heart, he will be prepared in the very best way for hearing what <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> him. It will not sound to him strange, as to many others, much less disagreeable; for I might, if it did not sound conceited, contend that every one of the detached statements which constitute the Upanishads, may be deduced as a necessary result from the fundamental thoughts which I have to enunciate, though those deductions themselves are by no means to be found there.|$|E

500|$|Upon {{viewing the}} {{performance}} of the Jamaican bobsleigh team at the 1988 Winter Olympics in Calgary, Alberta, Canada, Guèye decided to return to the Olympics once again. He maintained that he had a hard time explaining the sport to his fellow countrymen, saying [...] "I have to tell the people what snow is, what skis are, <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> them what big mountains are. They don't have any reference on these things." [...] Joining Guèye at the 1992 Winter Olympics in Albertville, France, and becoming the second Senegalese athlete to compete at a Winter Games, was ski instructor Alphonse Gomis, who resides in Tignes, near Albertville. As at the 1984 Winter Games, Guèye was Senegal's flagbearer during the Parade of Nations in the opening ceremony. No support staff were sent with the skiers, so that when Guèye injured his back, a doctor from the American team treated him.|$|E
500|$|Regarding {{his looks}} in the film, Ram Charan said, [...] "Personality wise there isn’t really much {{difference}} to Kalabhairava but <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> you minor changes like the shape of my mustache, a slight voice modulation, the background scale, the atmosphere and even the ‘Chandrabindu’ worked wonders on screen and gave a totally different look and feel and I {{felt like it was}} an altogether different side of me. When I was told of the characterization of ‘Kalabhairava’, I had an impression of a young, passionate soldier and naturally it had to have a great body and an authoritative voice. So, we also worked on it. We actually went to Rajasthan and observed the local culture and their way of dressing, we researched a lot about their costumes, history and great personalities 400 years ago and planned it accordingly." [...] Ram Charan sported a long hairdo for both of his characters in the film.|$|E

[...] <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> you, I love Charlie Sheen, I loved working {{with him when he}} was sober, but he was, he's full of shit. He has been full of shit, you know, he has serious addiction. You know, his addiction is obviously serious, drugs, and, but, Trump is just addicted to feeling important. You know, and I think if anybody is under the delusion that he cares about, uh, uh, anybody in America besides himself, they are, they are stoned and need to rethink their priorities, 'cause he's, you know, 'cause it's just ridiculous that's he's gotten as far as he has." ...|$|E

500|$|The NSC meeting then heard Phillips' bleak {{prognosis}} of {{the situation}} in the Mekong Delta. He claimed that the Strategic Hamlet Program was a shambles in the delta, stating that they were [...] "being chewed to pieces by the Viet Cong". When it was noted that Phillips had recently witnessed a battle in the delta, Kennedy asked Phillips for his assessment. Phillips replied: [...] "Well, I don't like to contradict General Krulak, but <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> you, Mr. President, that we're not winning the war, particularly in the delta. The troops are paralysed, they're in the barracks, and this is what is actually going on in one province that's right next to Saigon." [...] Phillips asserted that removing Nhu {{was the only way to}} improve the situation. Phillips asserted that the only means of removing Nhu was to bring in Colonel Edward Lansdale, the CIA operative who had consolidated Diệm's position a decade earlier, a proposal that Kennedy dismissed. Phillips recommended three measures: ...|$|E
500|$|The Eiland-Hall {{response}} brief cited {{a clip of}} Beck interviewing United States Congressman Keith Ellison, a Muslim from Minnesota. Beck had stated to U.S. Representative Ellison, [...] "No {{offense and}} I know Muslims, I like Muslims, I've been to mosques, I really don't think Islam is a religion of evil. I think it's being hijacked, quite frankly. With that being said, you are a Democrat. You are saying let's cut and run. And <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> you, I have been nervous about this interview because what I feel like saying is, sir, {{prove to me that}} you are not working with our enemies. And I know you’re not. I’m not accusing you of being an enemy. But that’s the way I feel, and I think a lot of Americans will feel that way." [...] It was argued that this was an example of Beck's interview style in which he challenged his guests to prove a negative. Randazza concluded Beck's rhetorical style was similar to Gottfried's, simply devoid of comedic intent.|$|E

Film producer William Castle {{took an interest}} in adapting Breakthrough for a movie, but the project was never realized. Breakthrough has certain parallels with David Williams' Second Sight (Simon and Schuster, 1977), coincidentally written the same year and later adapted for the TV movie, The Two Worlds of Jennie Logan (1979). Williams has commented, [...] "As the author of Second Sight, <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> you that until I read this Wikipedia page in 2004, I had never heard of Ken Grimwood or his novel Breakthrough." ...|$|E

After suspending his campaign, the former Maryland governor gave a speech, saying - [...] "Tonight, <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> you that I am suspending this Presidential bid.

2500|$|In October 2002, it was {{announced}} that Bradley Bell had decided to kill off Taylor, and Tylo would depart the role after twelve years. In a statement on her website, she wrote: [...] "It is with great sadness <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> you that Brad has decided to kill off the character Taylor. He feels the character is too good and has too much integrity to take her down other pathsin a word, played out." [...] The actress confessed that she was unhappy with her character's direction {{at the time of her}} exit, saying: [...] "I really felt like Taylor had lost the wind from her sails and was going nowhere." [...] Tylo said that [...] "It just seemed like everything had to do with whether or not there was a woman after her husband" [...] and that she was [...] "done with it", revealing that her unhappiness with the writing began when the character of Morgan appeared on the show. Furthermore, both Tylo and Bell agreed that Taylor was at a [...] "brick wall", but Bell was [...] "afraid to go beyond that" [...] and have the character go [...] "off the deep end", in fear of destroying her integrity. However, Tylo believed that [...] "in reality that's what she needed – to be more human. But she just got boring instead". Taylor is gunned down by Sheila Carter (Kimberlin Brown) and appears to die in hospital a few days later due to her injuries. Tylo eventually returned to the soap, with Taylor revealed to be alive in 2005.|$|E
2500|$|Through Chrétien had {{supported}} Martin in {{his plans for}} cuts, he did not allow Martin {{to go as far}} as he would have liked with cutting various social programs and to devolve spending powers to the provinces as a way of cutting federal government expenditure. As a [...] "hard federalist", Chrétien fiercely objected to what he saw as the [...] "soft federalist" [...] Martin's attempts to weaken the power of the federal government under the guise of cutting the deficit. One senior Liberal later recalled about the Chrétien-Martin debate about reforming Old Age Security that: [...] "Martin had been told [...] "no" [...] by the prime minister three times and still he persisted...his insubordination was unprecedented. It got the point where Chrétien had to draw {{a line in the sand}} and say [...] "I'm the prime minister and you're the finance minister and I'm saying no!"". Much of the Liberal caucus was deeply unhappy with the 1995 budget, arguing that this was not what they had been elected for in 1993, only to be informed by the Prime Minister that there was no alternative. Chrétien himself expressed his unhappiness with his budget in a radio interview with Peter Gzowski in March 1995, saying about the budget: [...] "It is not our pleasure sir, <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> you that. I've been around a long time. It's no pleasure at all. I'm not doctrinaire, a right-winger. I'm a Liberal, and I feel like a Liberal, and it is painful. But it is needed".|$|E

2500|$|The police dashcam video {{shows that}} 40 seconds elapsed between when Yanez first {{started talking to}} Castile through the car window and when Yanez began {{shooting}} at him. According to the dashcam, after Yanez asked for Castile's driver's license and proof of insurance, Castile gave him his proof of insurance card, which Yanez appeared to glance at and tuck in his outer pocket. Castile then calmly informed Yanez: [...] "Sir, <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> you that I do have a firearm on me." [...] Quoting the Star Tribune description of the next 13 seconds of the audio/video: Before Castile completed the sentence, Yanez interrupted and calmly replied, “OK,” and placed his right hand on the holster of his own holstered weapon. Yanez said, “Okay, don't reach for it, then ... don't pull it out.” Castile responded, “I'm not pulling it out,” and Reynolds also said, “He's not pulling it out.” Yanez repeated, raising his voice, “Don't pull it out!" [...] as he quickly pulled his own gun {{with his right hand}} and reached inside the driver's window with his left hand. Reynolds screamed, [...] "No!" [...] Yanez removed his left arm from the car and fired seven shots in the direction of Castile in rapid succession. [...] Reynolds yelled, “You just killed my boyfriend!” [...] Castile moaned and said, “I wasn't reaching for it." [...] Reynolds loudly said, “He wasn't reaching for it.” Before she completed her sentence, Yanez again screamed, “Don't pull it out!” Reynolds responded, “He wasn't.” Yanez yelled, “Don't move!
