5|$|A {{number of}} new rooms {{were added to the}} house as part of the 1895 work. A billiard room and ballroom were added <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>rear</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> house, and several ornate {{bathrooms}} were added on the second and third floors.|$|E
5|$|Another major {{difference}} between Tarbosaurus and its North American relatives was its more rigid mandible (lower jaw). While many theropods, including North American tyrannosaurids, had some degree of flexibility between the bones <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>rear</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> mandible and the dentary in the front, Tarbosaurus had a locking mechanism formed from a ridge {{on the surface of}} the angular, which articulated with a square process on the rear of the dentary.|$|E
5|$|The {{majority}} of the crew lived on the single gun deck of the Warrior; these crewmen slept in hammocks slung from the sides and deck beams, with up to 18 men between each pair of guns. The officers berthed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>rear</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ship in small individual cabins; the wardroom was also the officers' mess. The captain had two spacious, well-furnished cabins.|$|E

5|$|Around noon, Wallace {{began the}} journey along the Shunpike, a route {{familiar}} to his men. A member of Grant's staff, William R. Rowley, found Wallace between 2 and 2:30p.m. on the Shunpike, after Grant wondered where Wallace was {{and why he}} had not arrived on the battlefield, while the main Union force was being slowly pressed backward. Rowley told Wallace that the Union army had retreated, Sherman was no longer fighting at Shiloh Church, and the battle line had moved northeast toward Pittsburg Landing. If Wallace continued in the same direction, he would have found himself <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>rear</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> advancing Confederate troops.|$|E
5|$|Beginning in 1937, {{there was}} an effort to equip many tanks with a second machine gun <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>rear</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> turret and an {{anti-aircraft}} machine gun on top of it, as well as the addition of two searchlights above the gun for night gunnery, a new VKU-3 command system, and a TPU-3 intercom. Some tanks had a vertically stabilised TOP-1 gun telescopic sight. Ammunition stowage for the main gun was improved from 122 rounds to 147. In 1938, the cylindrical turret was replaced with a conical turret, with the same 45mm model 1934 gun. Some T-26s mod. 1938/1939, equipped with radio set, had a PTK commander's panoramic sight.|$|E
5|$|Kasuga and Nisshin {{participated in}} the Battle of the Yellow Sea on 10 August, but only played a minor role as they were <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>rear</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Japanese battleline. During the battle, the ship's {{executive}} officer was Kantarō Suzuki, later Prime Minister of Japan. Kasuga was not significantly damaged, although she was hit three times with 11 crewmen wounded. Kasuga fired 33 ten-inch shells along with {{an unknown number of}} eight-inch shells during the battle. After the battle the sisters returned to Pigeon Bay where they engaged the Russian fortifications.|$|E

5|$|On {{the central}} front, the ROK III Corps defended the 38th {{parallel}} north of Gapyeong (Kapyong) and Chuncheon. Composed of the ROK 2nd, 5th, 7th and 8th Infantry Divisions, the ROK III Corps placed the ROK 2nd Infantry Division on the corps' left flank {{in the hills}} north of Gapyeong, while the ROK 5th Infantry Division defended the corps' center at Chuncheon. The winter conditions created great difficulties for the South Korean defenders, with the heavy snow hindering construction and icy roads limiting food and ammunition resupply. North Korean guerrillas were also active in the region, and caused serious disruption <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>rear</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ROK III Corps.|$|E
5|$|The 1,380-kW (1,850-hp) Shvetsov ASh-82 {{radial engine}} was {{proposed}} {{as a replacement}} to alleviate the shortage of engines and this modification went into production in late 1942. The exhaust arrangements of the ASh-82 were not compatible with the gun turrets <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>rear</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> engine nacelles and the guns were removed, reducing the aircraft's defensive capability. At the end of 1943, the nose turret was deleted {{in favor of a}} manually operated ShKAS machine gun in a more streamlined nose. This version of the aircraft proved to have much the same range as the diesel-engined versions, but reliability was greatly improved. Production of the Pe-8s totaled 93.|$|E

5|$|The Hunter is a {{conventional}} swept wing all-metal monoplane. The fuselage is of monocoque construction, with a removable rear section for engine maintenance. The engine is fed through triangular air intakes in the wing roots {{and has a}} single jetpipe <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>rear</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> fuselage. The mid-mounted wings have a leading edge sweep of 35° and slight anhedral, the tailplanes and fin are also swept. The Hunter's aerodynamic qualities were increasingly infringed upon by modifications in later production models, such as the addition of external containers to collect spent gun cartridges, underwing fuel tanks to increase range, leading edge extensions to resolve pitch control difficulties, and a large ventral air brake.|$|E
5|$|The L191 (also {{formerly}} {{called the}} SS191) is a tracer cartridge designed for easier bullet spotting in dim light. Combustible chemicals packed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>rear</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> L191 projectile create a light trail visible up to 200m (219yd). The L191 has been manufactured {{with red and}} red-on-black tips. The performance and trajectory of the L191 {{is identical to the}} SS190. For this reason, it is also classified by the ATF as armor-piercing handgun ammunition, and its sale is currently restricted by FN to military and law enforcement customers.|$|E
5|$|The XF6U {{was a small}} {{aircraft}} with tricycle {{landing gear}} and with straight wings and tail surfaces. The wings were short enough {{that they did not}} need to fold. In order to fit more aircraft into crowded hangars, the nose gear could be retracted and the aircraft's weight would rest on a small wheel attached by the ground crew. This raised the tail up so that it could overlap the nose of the aircraft behind it, allowing more aircraft to fit into available hangar space. The turbojet engine was mounted <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>rear</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> fuselage and was fed by ducts in each wing root.|$|E

5|$|They {{participated in}} the Battle of the Yellow Sea on 10 August, but only played a minor role as they were {{generally}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>rear</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Japanese battleline. For the brief amount of time when Tōgō reversed course, Nisshin was {{at the head of}} the battleline and was hit three times during the battle, losing 14 crewmen killed and 25 wounded. After the battle the sisters returned to Pigeon Bay where they engaged the Russian fortifications.|$|E
5|$|Till {{arrived in}} Money, Mississippi, on August 21, 1955. On August 24, he and cousin Curtis Jones skipped church where his great-uncle Mose Wright was preaching and joined some local boys {{as they went}} to Bryant's Grocery and Meat Market to buy candy. The {{teenagers}} were children of sharecroppers and had been picking cotton all day. The market mostly served the local sharecropper population and was owned by a white couple, 24-year-old Roy Bryant and his 21-year-old wife Carolyn. Carolyn {{was alone in the}} store that day; her sister-in-law was <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>rear</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> store watching children. Jones left Till with the other boys while Jones played checkers across the street.|$|E
5|$|Although heavily outnumbered, the 27th Brigade {{held their}} {{positions}} into the afternoon before the Australians were finally withdrawn to positions <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>rear</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> brigade, {{with both sides}} having suffered heavy casualties. The Chinese then {{turned their attention to}} the Canadians on Hill 677, but during a fierce night battle they were unable to dislodge them. The fighting helped blunt the Chinese offensive and the actions of the Australians and Canadians at Kapyong were important in assisting to prevent a breakthrough on the United Nations Command central front, and ultimately the capture of Seoul. The two battalions bore the brunt of the assault and stopped an entire Chinese division during the hard fought defensive battle. The next day the Chinese withdrew back up the valley, in order to regroup. Today, the battle is {{regarded as one of the}} most famous actions fought by the Australian and Canadian armies in Korea.|$|E

5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the battle the ROK III Corps was located to the east of the US 24th Infantry Division of the US IX Corps, defending the 38th parallel to the north of Gapyeong (Kapyong) and Chuncheon. Composed of four divisions, the ROK III Corps placed its ROK 2nd Infantry Division on the corps' left flank at the hills north of Gapyeong, while the ROK 5th Infantry Division defended the corps' center at Chuncheon. The cold winter created great difficulties for the South Korean defenders, with the heavy snow hindering construction and icy roads limiting food and ammunition supplies.

5|$|<b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>rear</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> main {{entrance}} hall {{is a series}} of six dioramas illustrating communications and the press throughout Indonesian history. The first diorama shows various forms of communication and news-sharing in pre-colonial Indonesia. The second diorama shows the press in the colonial period, including the first newspaper in the Indies under the Dutch East India Company, Memories der Nouvelles (1615); the first printed newspaper in the Indies, the Bataviasche Nouvelles (1744), and the first Javanese newspaper in the Indies, Bromartani (1855). The third diorama depicts the press during the Japanese occupation, whereas the fourth depicts the press during the National Revolution– including the formation of the PWI. The fifth diorama shows the state of the press during the New Order under President Suharto, a time of great press censorship. The final diorama depicts the press after the beginning of Reformasi in 1998, in which greater freedom of the press has been granted.|$|E
5|$|Nellie Kehoe was {{discharged}} from Lansing's St. Lawrence Hospital on May 16, {{and her husband}} murdered her some time between her release and the bombings two days later.

Piled around the cart were silverware and a metal cash box. Ashes of several bank notes could be seen through a slit in the cash box. Kehoe had placed and wired homemade pyrotol firebombs in the house and all the buildings of the farm. The burned remains of his two horses were found tied in their enclosures with their legs wired together to prevent their rescue during the fire.|$|E
