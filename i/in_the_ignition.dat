25|$|The {{ignition}} coil's {{high voltage}} output {{is connected to the}} rotor that sits on top of the distributor shaft. Surrounding the rotor is the distributor cap. The arrangement sequentially directs the output of the secondary winding to the appropriate spark plugs. The high voltage from the coil's secondary (typically 20,000 to 50,000 volts) causes a spark to form across the gap of the spark plug that in turn ignites the compressed air-fuel mixture within the engine. It is the creation of this spark which consumes the energy that was stored <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>ignition</b> coil’s magnetic field.|$|E

25|$|<b>The</b> <b>ignition</b> coil {{consists}} of two transformer windings — the primary and secondary. These windings share a common magnetic core. An alternating current <b>in</b> <b>the</b> primary induces an alternating magnetic field <b>in</b> <b>the</b> core and hence an alternating current <b>in</b> <b>the</b> secondary. <b>The</b> <b>ignition</b> coil's secondary has more turns than the primary. This is a step-up transformer, which produces a high voltage from the secondary winding.|$|R

25|$|As {{the engine}} {{crankshaft}} turns, it also turns the distributor shaft at half the speed. In a four-stroke engine, the crankshaft turns twice for the ignition cycle. A multi-lobed cam {{is attached to}} the distributor shaft; there is one lobe for each engine cylinder. A spring-loaded rubbing block follows the lobed portions of the cam contour and controls the opening and closing of points. During most of the cycle, the rubbing block keeps the points closed to allow a current to build <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>ignition</b> coil's primary winding. As a piston reaches the top of the engine's compression cycle, the cam's lobe is high enough to cause the breaker points to open. Opening the points causes the current through the primary coil to stop. Without the steady current through the primary, the magnetic field generated in the coil immediately collapses. This high rate of change of magnetic flux induces a high voltage in the coil's secondary windings that ultimately causes the spark plug's gap to arc and ignite the fuel.|$|E

This was effected by pushing the key further <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>ignition</b> switch than normal, whether intentionally or not. One result of this was that the KR200's sequential, positive-stop transmission provided the car with the same four gear ratios available in reverse as in forward movement.|$|E
2500|$|During {{the flight}} the {{loosened}} nut caused increasingly excessive valve clearance eventually allowing collision of the valve {{head with the}} rising piston fracturing the valve stem, which then allowed the inlet valve to drop open, resulting <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>ignition</b> by the spark plug of the pressurised fuel/air mixture within the inlet manifold and, eventually, the pumping of the ignited fuel outboard of the rocker cover and along {{the outside of the}} engine, leading to an extensive fire in the engine nacelle. Due to the fire [...] originating in the induction system, where the supercharged fuel/air mixture was at higher pressure than atmospheric, the heart of the fire was much hotter burning and intense than would be the case in a simple fuel fire.|$|E
40|$|A prior {{paper has}} {{presented}} a novel {{design of a}} heavy duty truck engine fuelled with H 2. <b>In</b> this design, <b>the</b> customary in-cylinder Diesel injector and glow plug are replaced with a main chamber fuel injector and a jet <b>ignition</b> pre-chamber. <b>The</b> jet <b>ignition</b> pre-chamber is a small volume that {{is connected to the}} in-cylinder through calibrated orifices accommodating another fuel injector and a glow or a spark plug that controls the start of combustion. This design permits to operate <b>the</b> engine <b>in</b> four different modes: traditional compression ignition (CI), diffusion, Diesel-like (M 1); mixed gasoline/Diesel-like (M 2); traditional spark ignition (SI), premixed, gasoline-like (M 3); premixed, homogeneous charge compression ignition HCCI-like (M 4). <b>In</b> <b>the</b> mode diffusion with jet ignition (M 1), an injection occurs <b>in</b> <b>the</b> jet <b>ignition</b> pre-chamber before <b>the</b> main chamber fuel is injected and the engine operates therefore mostly Diesel-like. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> mode mixed diffusion/premixed Diesel/gasoline-like (M 2) an injection occurs <b>in</b> <b>the</b> jet <b>ignition</b> pre-chamber after only part of the main chamber fuel is injected and mixed with air. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> mode premixed with jet ignition (M 3), an injection occurs <b>in</b> <b>the</b> jet <b>ignition</b> pre-chamber after <b>the</b> main chamber fuel is injected and mixed with air and the engine operates gasoline-like.

2500|$|One {{week after}} the {{attempted}} assault on Antonucci, on July 29, 1975, another of Gacy's employees, 17-year-old John Butkovitch, disappeared. The day before his disappearance, Butkovitch had threatened Gacy over two weeks' outstanding back pay. Gacy later admitted to luring Butkovitch to his home while his wife and stepchildren were visiting his sister in Arkansas, ostensibly to settle the issue of Butkovitch's overdue wages. Gacy conned the youth into allowing his wrists to be cuffed behind his back, at which point Gacy strangled him to death and buried his body under the concrete floor of his garage. Gacy later admitted to having [...] "sat on the kid's chest for a while" [...] before killing him. Butkovitch's Dodge sedan was found abandoned {{in a parking lot}} with the youth's wallet inside and the keys still <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>ignition.</b> Butkovitch's father called Gacy, who claimed he was happy to help search for the youth but was sorry Butkovitch had [...] "run away". Gacy was questioned about Butkovitch's disappearance and admitted that the youth and two friends had arrived at his apartment demanding Butkovitch's overdue pay, but claimed all three youths had left after a compromise had been reached. Over the following three years, Butkovitch's parents called police more than 100 times, urging them to investigate Gacy further.|$|E
2500|$|Jones' binge {{drinking}} {{and use of}} amphetamines on the road caught up to him in 1967 {{and he had to}} be admitted into a neurological hospital to seek treatment for his drinking. [...] Jones would go to extreme lengths for a drink if the thirst was on him. [...] Perhaps the most famous drinking story concerning Jones occurred while he was married to his second wife Shirley Corley. [...] Jones recalled Shirley making it physically impossible for him to travel to Beaumont, located 8 miles away, to buy liquor. Because Jones would not walk that far, she would hide the keys to each of their cars they owned before leaving. She did not, however, hide the keys to the lawn mower. [...] Upset, Jones walked to the window and looked out over his property. [...] He later described his thoughts in his memoir: [...] "There, gleaming in the glow, was that ten-horsepower rotary engine under a seat. A key glistening <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>ignition.</b> I imagine the top speed for that old mower was five miles per hour. It might have taken {{an hour and a half}} or more for me to get to the liquor store, but get there I did." [...] Years later Jones comically mocked the incident by making a cameo in the video for [...] "All My Rowdy Friends Are Coming Over Tonight" [...] by Hank Williams Jr.. He also parodied the episode in the 1993 video for [...] "One More Last Chance" [...] by Vince Gill and in his own music video for the single [...] "Honky Tonk Song" [...] in 1996. Curiously, in her 1979 autobiography Stand By Your Man, Tammy Wynette claims the incident occurred while she was married to Jones, maintaining that she woke up at one o'clock in the morning to find her husband gone: [...] "I got into the car and drove to the nearest bar 10 miles away. When I pulled into the parking lot there sat our rider-mower right by the entrance. He'd driven that mower right down a main highway. [...] He looked up and saw me and said, ‘Well, fellas, here she is now. My little wife, I told you she'd come after me.’" ...|$|E
