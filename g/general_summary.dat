30|$|This survey {{mainly focused}} on {{differences}} in adoption of teleradiology and recommendations of different national societies regarding insourcing and outsourcing of services.

Also, various levels of service, from exam justification to interpretation and reporting may be provided offsite, although it is the remote interpretation and reporting that are most often provided via teleradiology.

40|$|Intended {{to examine}} equity in values {{education}} {{in public school}} curricula, this comprehensive report is organized into two major sections.

Part 2 of section 1 reports on how religion and traditional values are currently portrayed in a large and representative sample of the nation's textbooks. Four appendices, making up approximately half of the report, provide tables showing the 60 social studies books in the sample listed by publisher, grade, and title, followed by <b>general</b> <b>summaries</b> of major sections and emphases for each text.

60|$|<b>General</b> <b>Summary</b> and Concluding Remarks on the Salts of Ammonia.--We {{have now}} {{seen that the}} nine [page 168] salts of ammonia which were tried, all cause the {{inflection}} of the tentacles, and often of the blade of the leaf. As far as can be ascertained from the superficial trials with the last six salts, the citrate is the least powerful, and the phosphate certainly by far the most. The tartrate and chloride are remarkable from the short duration of their action. The relative efficiency of the carbonate, nitrate, and phosphate, {{is shown in the}} following table by the smallest amount which suffices to cause the inflection of the tentacles.|$|E

40|$|<b>General</b> <b>summaries</b> on the load-unload and force-release methods {{indicate}} that the two methods are efficient for different-charactered quasi-static failures; therefore, {{it is important to}} choose the right one for different applications. Then we take, as an example, the case where the release of the ruptured element's internal force is infinitely slower than the relaxation of the lattice system and analyze why the force-release method works better than the load-unload method in this particular case. Different trial deformation fields are used by them to track the next equilibrium state. Force-release method ensures that the deformation throughout the whole failure process coincides exactly with the controlled-displacement boundary conditions and we utilize the 'left modulus' concept to prove that this method satisfies the energetic evolution in the force-displacement diagram; both of which are not satisfied by the load-unload method. To illustrate that the force-release method is not just another form of the load-unload method, a tensile test on a specifically designed system is analyzed to further compare the above two methods, showing that their predicted sequences of elemental failures can be different. In closing, we simulate the uniaxial tensile test on a beam lattice system by the load-unload and force-release methods and exploit the details of the resulting fracture processes. © The Author(s), 2011...|$|R
60|$|For {{not giving}} you a <b>general</b> <b>summary</b> of news, you must pardon me; {{it is not in}} my power to do so. I am now the most miserable man living.

To remain as I am is impossible; I must die or be better, it appears to me. The matter you speak of on my account you may attend to as you say, unless you shall hear of my condition forbidding it. I say this because I fear I shall be unable to attend to any business here, and a change of scene might help me. If I could be myself, I would rather remain at home with Judge Logan.

60|$|Summary of the Results with Phosphate of Ammonia.--The glands of the disc, when {{excited by}} a half-minim drop (.0296 ml.), {{containing}} 1/3840 of a grain (.0169 mg.) of this salt, transmit a motor impulse to the exterior tentacles, {{causing them to}} bend inwards. A minute drop, containing 1/153600 of a grain (.000423 mg.), if held {{for a few seconds}} in contact with a gland, causes the tentacle bearing this gland to be inflected. If a leaf is left immersed for a few hours, and sometimes for a shorter time, in a solution so weak that each gland can absorb only the 1/9760000 of a grain (.00000328 mg.), this is enough to excite the tentacle into movement, so that it becomes closely inflected, as does sometimes the blade. In the <b>general</b> <b>summary</b> to this chapter a few remarks will be added, showing that the efficiency of such extremely minute doses is not so incredible as it must at first appear.|$|E
6000|$|My friends, must I assert, then, what surely all men know, {{though all}} men {{seem to have}} {{forgotten}} it, That in the learned professions as in the unlearned, and in human things throughout, in every place and in every time, the true function of intellect is not that of talking, but of understanding and discerning {{with a view to}} performing! An intellect may easily talk too much, and perform too little. Gradually, if it get into the noxious habit of talk, there will less and less performance come of it, talk being so delightfully handy in comparison with work; and at last there will no work, or thought of work, be got from it at all.
