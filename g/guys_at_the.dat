[...] "What's more cynical than forming an ideological news network like Fox and calling it 'fair and balanced'? What we do, I almost think, is adorable in its idealism." [...] Stewart has said {{that he does not}} take any joy in the failings of American government, despite the comedic fodder they provide. [...] "We're not the <b>guys</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> craps table betting against the line," [...] he said on Larry King Live.

500|$|The medal's {{order of}} {{precedence}} was criticized by the Veterans of Foreign Wars. The commander of this organization, John Hamilton, explained, [...] "It {{is very important to}} properly recognize all who faithfully serve and excel, but this new medal – no matter how well intended – could quickly deteriorate into a morale issue. Medals that can only be earned in direct combat must mean more than medals awarded in the rear." [...] The Military Order of the Purple Heart joined in condemnation, stating [...] "To rank what is basically an award for meritorious service higher than any award for heroism is degrading and insulting to every American Combat Soldier, Airman, Sailor or Marine who risks his or her life and endures the daily rigors of combat in a hostile environment. The Military Order of the Purple Heart strongly urges the newly appointed Secretary of Defense and the Joint Chiefs of Staff to either reconsider the precedence of the Distinguished Warfare Medal or develop another way to recognize the achievements of those whose indirect actions contribute greatly to the accomplishment of the mission without diminishing the sacrifice of life and limb by those who confront the enemy firsthand on the battlefield." [...] The Association of the United States Navy also expressed criticism of the medal's placement, stating [...] "While AUSN supports the medal itself, as well as the achievements and importance of the cyber warfare community, the concern lies with the ranking of the medal." [...] Doug Sterner, military medals expert and curator of the Military Times Hall of Valor, expressed confusion, saying, [...] "I understand the need to recognize the <b>guys</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> console who are doing some pretty important things. But to see it ranking above the Bronze Star (with) V?" [...] Nick McDowell, a member of the Orders and Medals Society of America said that an alternative to adding a new medal could be adding a new ribbon device to an existing medal, and said that [...] "The problem is that we're adding another non-valor personal decoration into a system that is already crowded with non-valor personal decorations." ...|$|E
