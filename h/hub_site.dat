Yet they face several challenges in providing services for an ever-increasing number of actors and institutions interested in climate information and adaptation. This study evaluates how the Alaska Center for Climate Assessment and Policy (ACCAP) innovated its boundary spanning role to improve outcomes by partnering with other boundary organizations through its ongoing climate webinar series. We utilize {{the concept of}} boundary chains to investigate outcomes associated with different extended network connections. Our evaluation {{is based on the}} analysis three datasets, including interviews (2013) and two web-based questionnaires (2010 and 2013 – 2015). Findings from the evaluation reveal several ways that remote engagement via the ACCAP webinar series facilitates learning, decision application, and cross-level network building, and overcomes barriers associated with large geographic distances between communities. In an organic evolution and innovation of the climate webinar series, ACCAP partnered with other boundary organizations to establish satellite <b>hub</b> <b>sites</b> to facilitate in-person gatherings at remote locations, thereby increasing the number and diversity of participants served and supporting local networking within organizations, agencies, and communities. Leveraging complementary resources through the satellite <b>hub</b> <b>sites</b> provided mutual benefits for ACCAP and partnering boundary organizations.

40|$|There are {{a number}} of {{contexts}} in transport network design where cost savings arise from providing a dedicated transmission system between two nonadjacent nodes. This occurs when terminating demands at intermediate en-route cross-connecting and grooming nodes costs more than the alternative of providing a dedicated system. Today, "express routes" are justified on a case-bycase basis, usually where large demands flow between major centres or to / from <b>hubbing</b> <b>sites</b> where traffic can be aggregated to warrant an express system. Smaller flows are routed through each flexibility point en-route and remultiplexed with other demands on successive fiber links, to keep the fiber system fill as high as possible. We provide a means to find further express system opportunities through a systematic search for suitable combinations of smaller co-routed demands that, as a group, can economically warrant express treatment over some portion of their routes. These demands need not share common end nodes or hubs; rather, they happen to travel as a group over some sequence of spans on which an express system might be cost-effective. The search problem is to detect and form associations of maximally coherent subgroups of demands that yield the best economic payback through creation of an en-route or "partial" express system. There is no explicit grooming to effect such aggregations and the methods apply without any <b>hubbing</b> <b>site</b> to aggregate traffic. Results show that significant economic benefits can be obtained by post-processing an existing or planned design to search for these partial express system opportunities. 1...|$|R

40|$|Background: The {{purpose of}} this study was to present our {{evaluation}} of a new speech pathology telepractice service supporting the swallowing and communication management of patients with head and neck cancer. Methods: A multicenter randomized controlled trial was conducted within a large public cancer service. Referrals from speech pathologists at 3 regional sites (spoke sites) were managed by a specialist clinician from a cancer center (<b>hub</b> <b>site)</b> either via standard care (phone/email support/appointments at the <b>hub</b> <b>site)</b> or a newly established telepractice service (online consultation between the <b>hub</b> <b>site</b> and spoke site). Results: Eighty-two referrals (39 for standard care and 43 for telepractice care) were managed. Service efficiency favoring the telepractice model was reported with a significant reduction in the number (p =. 004) and duration (p =. 024) of contact events required to manage the referrals. Higher consumer and clinician satisfaction was also reported for the telepractice service. Conclusion: A speech pathology telepractice service benefits both the patient and health provider through higher service efficiency and treatment satisfaction. No Full Tex...|$|E

40|$|Previous {{studies of}} the elite {{political}} blogosphere have sought to distinguish a population of “A-list ” blogs by culling the top 100 rankings from multiple sources.

The index combines four measures of authority to produce comparative rankings of the elite blogs.

40|$|Models are {{presented}} for the optimal location of hubs in airline networks, which {{take into consideration}} the congestion e,ects. Hubs, which are typically the most congested airports, are modeled as M=D=c queuing systems. A formula is derived for the probability of a number of customers in the system, which is later used to propose a capacity constraint. This constraint limits the probability of more than b airplanes in queue, to be smaller than or equal to a given value. Due to the computational complexity of the formulation, the model is solved using a heuristic based on tabu search. Computational experience is presented together with an example using a data set available in the literature. Scope and purpose In order to take advantage of economies of scale, most major airlines have selected some airports as transshipment points (hubs). As hubs become congested, the usual <b>hub</b> <b>siting</b> techniques fail in 4 nding their best locations. We propose new methods for locating congested hubs and allocating runways to hub airports...|$|R
