500|$|Although the {{division}} of labour inherent in prescriptive technologies is usually associated with the industrial revolution, Franklin points out that such production methods have been used since ancient times. Chinese bronze casting before 1200 BC for example, required a tightly controlled and closely supervised production process {{as well as a}} strict division of labour. Franklin writes that when she studied Chinese bronze casting as a metallurgist, [...] "the extraordinary social meaning of prescriptive technologies <b>dawned</b> <b>on</b> <b>me.</b> I began to understand what they meant, not just in terms of casting bronze but in terms of discipline and planning, of organization and command." ...|$|E
500|$|Higgins {{started writing}} tracks for her second album {{as soon as}} she had {{finished}} recording The Sound of White, which was released in 2004. She said, [...] "I started quite early because I knew there would a lot of pressure for the second album and I didn't want to write songs under anyone's stopwatch." [...] "100 Round the Bends" [...] was written while she was still recording the first album. During 2006, Higgins spent six months living in Broome, Western Australia, away from the distractions of the entertainment industry. Here she was able to relax and focus on creating new material for her next album. The landscape around Broome inspired the lyrics for [...] "Going North". She said, [...] "It was the first place I'd ever felt honestly connected with my country, with the physical land of my country". The lyrics for [...] "Steer" [...] were inspired when Higgins looked up at the night sky on a Broome beach: [...] "It <b>dawned</b> <b>on</b> <b>me</b> how small we are, how short life is ... I felt so liberated to have finally figured that out." ...|$|E
500|$|As the 1970s began, the New Left faded away, {{and many}} {{movements}} arose in its wake– {{among them the}} feminist, men's liberation, spiritual, human potential, ecology, appropriate technology, intentional community, and holistic health movements. [...] After graduating from the University of British Columbia in 1972, Satin immersed himself in all these movements, either directly or {{as a reporter for}} Canada's underground press. [...] He also took up residence in a free-love commune. [...] "One fierce winter's day", he says,"... it <b>dawned</b> <b>on</b> <b>me</b> that the ideas and energies from the various 'fringe' movements [...] beginning to generate a coherent new politics. [...] But I looked in vain for the people and groups that were expressing that new politics (instead of merely bits and pieces of it)". [...] Satin set out to write a book that would express the new politics in all its dimensions. [...] He wrote, designed, typeset, and printed the first edition of New Age Politics himself, in 1976. [...] A 240-page edition was published by Vancouver's Whitecap Books in 1978, and a 349-page edition by Dell Publishing Company in New York in 1979. It is now widely regarded as the [...] "first", [...] "most ambitious", or [...] "most adequate" [...] attempt to offer a systemic overview of the new post-socialist politics arising {{in the wake of the}} New Left. [...] Some academics say it offers a new ideology.|$|E

2500|$|Her {{professional}} tennis career, however, {{was going}} nowhere. [...] "When I looked around me, I saw that white tennis players, {{some of whom}} I had thrashed on the court, were picking up offers and invitations," [...] she wrote. [...] "Suddenly it <b>dawned</b> <b>on</b> <b>me</b> that my triumphs had not destroyed the racial barriers once and for all, as I had—perhaps naively—hoped. Or if I did destroy them, they had been erected behind me again." ...|$|E
2500|$|In August 1933, Italian {{journalist}} Francesco Gasparini submitted what he {{said was}} the first news article on the Loch Ness Monster. In 1959, he reported sighting a [...] "strange fish" [...] and fabricated eyewitness accounts: [...] "I had the inspiration to get hold of the item about the strange fish. The idea of the monster had never <b>dawned</b> <b>on</b> <b>me,</b> but then I noted that the strange fish would not yield a long article, and I decided to promote the imaginary being to the rank of monster without further ado." ...|$|E

I was here in 1996 during Operation Grapes of Wrath. I was four at the time and I had no concept that it was war," [...] Keynes told a reporter. [...] "I remember when the gravity of the situation <b>dawned</b> <b>on</b> <b>me.</b> It was during the 2006 July war, I was 14 then… but it didn't really shake my view of Lebanon as effectively a second home, a place where I come to and I have family."

2500|$|Of {{the various}} films that have {{attracted}} nominations {{in all four}} acting categories, Sunset Boulevard {{is one of only}} three not to win in any category, the others being My Man Godfrey (1936) and American Hustle (2013). Its eleven Oscar nominations were exceeded only by the fourteen received by All About Eve, which won six awards, including Best Picture and Best Director. Many critics predicted that the Best Actress award would be given to Gloria Swanson or Bette Davis for All About Eve and were surprised that the recipient was newcomer Judy Holliday for Born Yesterday. Swanson recalled the press's reaction following Holliday's win: [...] "It slowly <b>dawned</b> <b>on</b> <b>me</b> that they were asking for a larger-than-life scene, or better still, a mad scene. More accurately, they were trying to flush out Norma Desmond." ...|$|E
2500|$|Herzog's {{first choice}} {{for the role of}} Aguirre was actor Klaus Kinski. The two had met many years earlier when the then-struggling young actor rented a room in Herzog’s family apartment, and Kinski’s often terrifying and {{deranged}} antics during the three months he lived there left a lasting impression on the director. Years later, Herzog remembered the volatile actor and knew that he was the only possible man who could play the mad Aguirre, and he sent Kinski a copy of the screenplay. [...] "Between three and four in the morning, the phone rang," [...] Herzog recalled. [...] "It took me {{at least a couple of}} minutes before I realized that it was Kinski who was the source of this inarticulate screaming. And after an hour of this, it <b>dawned</b> <b>on</b> <b>me</b> that he found it the most fascinating screenplay and wanted to be Aguirre." ...|$|E

I have confessed it freely on the platform. Even during my first few months in the council what may be called the old {{political}} practices seemed natural to me.

[...] And now {{consciously}} her face was called up, infinitely sweet and more impelling for the deliberate memory. Flash of brown skin, smooth and clear; level gaze of dark, wide eyes, steady, bold, unseeing; red curved lips, sad and sweet; her strong, clean, fine face rose before Jean, eager and wistful one moment, softened by dreamy musing thought, and the next stormily passionate, full of hate, full of longing, but the more mysterious and beautiful.|$|R

Determined to resist, and in deep trouble, he moves all over the place looking for support but finding that there is nobody who will help him; each has a reason of his own for not getting involved. In the end, he must meet his chosen fate all by himself, his town's doors and windows firmly locked against him. It is a story that still happens everywhere, every day.|$|R

Agonizing with pain, I was completely at a loss what to do. About three meters away from me were parts of the plane. They were still burning. Meanwhile, I heard the distant howling of a dog. It was only then that I felt hopeful of being rescued. Thinking that there were probably people living not far away from where I lay moaning with pain, I made an effort to shout. I noticed that my voice echoed in the nearby mountains.After that, I began shouting, [...] "Mr. President! Mr. President! Mr. President!" [...] When no answer came, I shouted for Pablo Bautista, the reporter of the Liwayway magazine. [...] "Pabling! Pabling!" [...] Still no answer. It began to <b>dawn</b> <b>on</b> <b>me</b> that there was no other survivor except me.|$|R
