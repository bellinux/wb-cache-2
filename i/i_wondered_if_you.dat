This, for an American type, was an old one, he was sure; and the process of parting between the guest and her hostess had an ancient elaboration. Count Otto waited a little; then he turned away and walked up to Pandora Day, whose group of interlocutors had now been re-enforced by a gentleman who had held an important place in the cabinet of the late occupant of the presidential chair. He had asked Mrs. Bonnycastle if she were [...] "all alone"; but there was nothing in her present situation to show her for solitary. She wasn't sufficiently alone for our friend's taste; but he was impatient and he hoped she'd give him a few words to himself. She recognised him without a moment's hesitation and with the sweetest smile, a smile matching to a shade the tone in which she said: [...] "I was watching you. <b>I</b> <b>wondered</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> weren't going to speak to me." ...|$|E

40|$|RITCHIE: I've {{been doing}} these {{interviews}} in a biographical, chronological framework, beginning with people's backgrounds, their family life, where they grew up, the schools they went to, {{and what they}} did before they came to the Senate. <b>I</b> <b>wondered</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> could {{tell me a little bit}} about your parents, who they were {{and what they did}}? VALEO: Yes, my father came as an immigrant around the turn of the century, at the age of sixteen. He worked as a shoemaker, or shoe repairer, and then in a shoe factory; eventually became a foreman of the factory. My mother was born on Hester Street, on the Lower East Side, also of immigrants who had arrived a few years earlier. Her family grew up in Brooklyn. They moved there at a rather early date because there was a large shoe factory there called Wickett and Gardens. Her father, something of an entrepreneur, had opened a series of small businesses, starting with a barbershop, and then a bar, and a grocery store, things of that sort. She went to work at the age of nine in the factory. She had only three years of schooling. My father had perhaps five. Both recognized the value of education and were insistent that I get it. So that's where it began...|$|E
