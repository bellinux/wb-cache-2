This has also led to the rapid development and consolidation of women’s and equality machineries–state feminism–and well-established policies devoted to promoting gender equality over the last three decades, both at national and regional governmental levels. This article aims to present a consolidated policy area which has enough elements to survive and to keep on developing, although in an increasingly fragmented manner, among regions, despite the ongoing economic crisis and the conservative political turn. Based on theories of state feminism and discursive politics, this article analyzes four important elements for understanding this claim and the evolution of national and regional Spanish gender policies and institutions during the last three decades: women’s machinery, the relations between that machinery and women’s and feminist movements, the policy discourses present in gender equality policies, and the policy instruments used by those machineries and policies...|$|E

40|$|The {{project has}} {{investigated}} {{the level of}} representation, and transparency in the Danish political system, and the influence these two concepts have had on {{the legitimacy of the}} Danish democracy. This has been investigated on two parallel levels; the change of government in 2011 and the implementation of the Danish Public Information Act 2013. These consequences of these two events are then put into context of voting patterns and social strata, to analyse the changes in the political system from a more sociological angle. The project starts by analysing how the new Danish Public Information Act (2013) has influenced the transparency of the political system. The changes that occurred with the implementation of the act created a huge uproar from the Danish population, and was heavily criticised by experts. The project attempts to implement the change in transparency to an analysis of the legitimacy of the Danish political system. The project concludes on the basis of experts on media as well as the political system, that the Danish Public Information Act (2013) have had a negative influence on the legitimacy of the Danish political system. The project then investigates the level of representation in Denmark by discussing the big choices made in the two <b>governmental</b> <b>periods</b> (2001 - 2011 and 2011 - 2014). Furthermore, an analysis of the laws implemented with and without the opposition’s consent in both periods has been done to discuss the public critique of the left wing government (2011 - 14), that they only implement laws big broad conciliations. It is shown that this is not an abnormality but the regular way of policy-making, which is seen in the results that the right wing government (2001 - 11) has implemented 71 % of their laws as broad conciliations and 29 % without the opposition’s consent and the the left wing government implemented 79 % of their laws as broad conciliations and only 21 % of the laws without the opposition. This shows that only the left wing government implement 8 % more of their laws as broad conciliations than the right wing government. In the last chapter an analysis focused on the representation based on demographics is completed. This analysis shows that there is a proportional connection between the level of income and education and the level of participation. Furthermore, the sociological consequences of this was discussed with by including sociologists view on this. Especially Bourdieu’s three capitals, social, economic and cultural, has been implemented on the ability to influence the political system. The project shows that there has come new barriers to entry in the Danish political system, and furthermore, that the ability to penetrate these has become more dependent on one’s level of different capitals. The project argues that the level of social capital is directly influenced by one’s cultural and economic capital. Furthermore, that the level of cultural and economic capital has a direct influence on one’s will to participate in the democracy is argued and visualised after the analysis of information from the Danish parliament and other scholars pre-analysed empirical data. The project concludes that the Danish democratic political system, relative to other nations, is very transparent, legitimate and has a high level of representation in many aspects of the system, however, the increasing barriers to entry and the continuously increase of elitism creates a change of power from being equally divided between the population to be, to a higher degree, a question on one’s level of education and income that determines how much influence a citizen has on the Danish system.

The Balkans has proved to be no exception. As early as the 16 th century, corruption began to be tolerated and widely accepted within the region. The corruption problem was greatly exacerbated following the disintegration of communism and the successive civil wars that plagued Yugoslavia throughout the 1990 s. During this <b>period,</b> <b>governmental</b> officials forged strong, unhealthy relationships with criminal elements. These close ties between organized crime and governmental officials have continued unabated until the present day and help form the basis of a pervasive culture of corruption in the region. This high level of corruption in the Balkans is problematic since both the EU and NATO have continued to expand eastward since the breakup of the Soviet Union in the early 1990 s.

As an imbalance social-exchange relationship, in terms of patron-client relationship, second side (client) much highly depends upon the first side (patron). This had been experienced in Madurese social history during the native <b>governmental</b> <b>period</b> of time. The government was classified into two major classes; ruler class (patron) and farmer class (client). The former is fully in authority to take control either economic or politic potencies, however, the later transacts labors to the first side. Both side is connected by a bribe (upeti) systems—percaton, apanage and daleman. In current progress this relationship becomes more acquaintance, it covers economic and politic relationship. The success of Trunojoyo, the king of Sumenep 2 ̆ 7 s inherit, against the Mataram domination had been supported by Madurese people that had previously tightened to the system.

40|$|The {{title of}} this {{dissertation}} is “The representation of government programmes in inauguration speeches of Estonian Prime Ministers 1992 - 2007 “. Its main objectives are, on the one hand, {{to focus on the}} values and goals shared in the inauguration speeches of Estonian Prime Ministers and, on the other, the reproduction of the official values through the legitimatization of the government. The theoretical standpoint of the thesis stems from diverse views of what political culture is, the shape and description of political discourse, changing values, ideology and good governance. The central concepts of the thesis are political culture, critical discourse analysis, legitimacy of the power, consolidation of values and their change over transformation processes. The analytical material of the thesis is composed of inauguration speeches of Prime Ministers of the Estonian Republic from regaining independence (1991) up to 2007. The analysed speeches were chosen according to whether the speech was given to introduce government programmes after the elections of the Riigikogu (Parliament) or after having reformed the government coalition, bringing a new coalition with new government partners. Shared values in Estonia connected to the changes in the society are researched through different public opinion surveys. Accordingly, these surveys have not focused on governmental self-defining discourses and indications to political culture from the viewpoint of reflecting, shaping and changing values through political discourse. Methodologically speaking, the present thesis combines discourse analysis with some aspects of content analysis. Discourse and content analysis of the inauguration speeches of Estonian Prime Ministers provides an overview of the main semantic features portrayed in the introduction of the government, its values and goals in the <b>governmental</b> <b>period.</b> Furthermore, it highlights the changes through the overall discourse and in speeches separately. The method also helped to take into account and to describe the context of the speakers and speeches and provide examples of the values and their changes accordingly. The initial hypothesis was tested and confirmed throughout the thesis. In addition to legitimizing the government, define it by its developments, and presenting the governmental program, social values and goals are shared and up to date challenges and goals are specified. The main subjects of self-defining of the government are related to state-building purposes, and provide a perfect chance for presenting the values oriented to the preserving the nation, language, national culture and also economic changes and other developments in the state and society. Starting from 1992, all the speeches of the Prime Ministers in the Riigikogu reflect mainly target values. Right after regaining independence, the target values were bound to statebuilding processes, establishing the governmental structures and legal system, and guaranteeing the stability of the state. On the one hand, the target values related to statebuilding and state security were concerned with the development of the nationhood, its needed abilities, reforms, political stability, preserving and developing the nation state, population growth, national security, legal system, etc. The target values related to economical development had to do with international competitiveness of the Estonian economy, low tax burden, competent labour force and knowledge-based economy. Finally, the values expressing political culture and developments of the society were also expressed in the speeches. The abovementioned target values expressed in most of the speeches of Prime Ministers are noticeably supplemented in the beginning of early 2000 ths after the state and independence were secured, especially after Estonia joined the European Union and NATO. These changes added the values bound to personal space of society members of Estonia (self-realization, happiness, toleration, creativity, freedom) to the discourse introducing the government. The range of values bound to political and societal developments as dignity, appreciating older generation and improving public health were also added into the new discursive practices. The social groups addressed to by the Prime Ministers’ discourse are quite stable during the covered period of analysis. Special attention in the speeches is mostly paid to (young) families, pensioners, unemployed people, rural people, pedagogues and entrepreneurs. This attention to these groups might be understood through the values and expectations bound to them in the speech: improving their material state or mentioning the expectations for these improvements, defining the group as important for the development and improvement of Estonia, and achieving specific development goals (knowledge-based economy, foreign investments etc). Eventually it is possible to say that the values expressed to legitimate the Estonian governments by the Prime Ministers during 1992 - 2007 reflect rapid changes in the development of Estonia. Along the abovementioned changes, the definition of the state goals has moved from state-building to its preservation and the improvement of Estonia’s international relevance. The values offered to the inhabitants have changed from maintaining their life-standard and handling everyday life towards attempting higher life standards and activeness in innovative economics, but also to increase Estonia’s population, and preserve its culture and nation-state. To a certain extent, in addition to the new values from the beginning of 2000 ths it is possible to identify values that may be considered as postmodern (selfrealization, public health, keeping nature and environment etc). Seen political culture in connection with shared values in the society and discourse, the conclusions of the thesis assure that political culture of Estonia is developing with the statehood. The appearance of terminal values legitimizing the government and offered to the public in the discourse of Estonian Prime Ministers {{may be one of the}} first signs of the change in shared values of the Estonian society. But how will these first indications, introduced during rapid economical growth times in Estonia, develop? This might be the subject for further research, following government discourses and broader public discourses in Estonia. The constant references to the potential loss of Estonian culture, language and the essence of the „Estonianness“ in the discourse of Estonian Prime Ministers seem to indicate that the discourse is used as a tool for political mobilzation. A prognosis as a result of this analysis is that similar references will continue to be used in future speeches in order to quarrantee the national unity, citizens’ political priorities and exclusive interest to Estonian affairs rather than European and global issues (social, environmetal, economical etc) ...|$|E

Due to SEZ region managed to obtain stable dynamics of growth of gross regional product, installments to consolidated regional budget, and reduce the number of companies failing to pay wages in time.

40|$|Since 2005, the Thai {{government}} has, as {{a matter}} of policy, been seeking to increase production of biodiesel from oil palms. As a result, the number of oil palm plantations in the Northeast region has been growing, particularly in Nong Khai province. Nong Khai is a relatively remote, predominantly agricultural area and is the field site for this research. However, oil palm production is a complex and hotly contested issue both globally and in Thailand and it has ardent critics and supporters. For example, expanding oil palm production could, on the one hand, contribute to deforestation and a range of social problems that threaten traditional livelihoods, whilst on the other hand it could offer a source of renewable energy, alleviate poverty, and lead to a higher standard of living for farmers. The ultimate {{purpose of this study is}} to understand the changeover to oil palm production, specifically in the Thai context, through the development and application of a distinctive analytical approach. This approach is a synthesis of: the eight elements of farmers’ decision-making (Ohlmer et al., 1998), the IDS Knowledge, Technology, and Society (KNOTS) team’s framework on policy processes (Keeley and Scoones, 1999; 2001; 2003; KNOTS, 2006). This analytical approach is used to investigate factors influencing farmers’ decisions to take up oil palm cultivation, and the rationale behind the government’s oil palm policy and how it is implemented in the Northeast Thailand. Approximately nine months were spent carrying out the research in three selected villages in Nong Khai province, using qualitative methods including semi-structured interviews, purposive sampling and snowballing techniques. The results show that economic security is an important factor for farmers in deciding to change over to oil palm cultivation. However, it has emerged that what farmers really want is to achieve a comfortable lifestyle and to live in the same locality as their children, which implies urban to rural migration. Other critical factors are characteristic of oil palm cultivation, such as long life-span and short harvesting <b>period,</b> <b>governmental</b> projects supporting oil palm production, the roles of inspirational local leaders and large-scale oil palm producers, the price of oil palm fruits, the links between farmers and local buyers, and the experiences of oil palm growers in the southern region of Thailand, as well as the low productivity and high production costs involved in rice cultivation, and the success of rubber plantations. The findings also suggest that the oil palm policy processes in Nong Khai province do not have policy space for farmers to participate in the networks, or to design the oil palm policy that directly affects them. The policy was made in top-down in which the government only transferred oil palm knowledge through seminars and trainings. There were also issues concerning inequality amongst farmers and how that affects participation in the oil palm projects. Indeed, the OPPSP favours rich farmers, as they need a significant amount of capital to prepare for and maintain oil palm crops. Implementation of a ‘farmer-first’ approach is recommended in order to push the policy forward to serve resource-poor farmers properly. New behaviours and attitudes must be encouraged in most of the professionals encountered in this research...|$|R
