25|$|At the camp, counselors Ned, Jack, Bill, Marcie, Brenda, and Alice, {{along with}} the owner Steve Christy, {{refurbish}} the cabins and facilities. As a thunderstorm approaches, Steve leaves the campground to stock supplies. Soon after, Ned sees someone walk {{into one of the}} cabins, and follows. As Jack and Marcie have sex in one of the cabin's bunk beds, they are unaware of Ned's body directly above them, his throat slit. Soon after, Jack is killed when his throat is pierced by an arrow from beneath the bed, and the killer murders Marcie by slamming an axe <b>into</b> <b>her</b> <b>face.</b> Brenda hears a child's voice calling for help and ventures outside her cabin to the archery range, only for the range lights to turn on as she is attacked off-screen. Eventually, Steve returns to the camp and is killed.|$|E
25|$|This {{season of}} Big Brother Australia {{proved to be}} highly controversial. Big Brother – Adults Only ended its run early after {{politicians}} warned Network Ten that its screening of the show could harm its push for media reforms. An alleged sexual assault during which John (real name Michael Bric) held down Camilla Severi on her bed while Ashley (Michael Cox) pushed his crotch <b>into</b> <b>her</b> <b>face</b> in the house on 1 July 2006 resulted in the ejection of the pair from the show. The incident sparked calls for the series to be investigated for possible breaches of broadcasting laws, and calls for the cancellation of the series by several commentators and politicians, including then Australian Prime Minister John Howard and opposition leader Kim Beazley. The incident {{and in particular the}} Prime Minister's comments, were reported internationally, running on CNN and the BBC and in various other international publications.|$|E
500|$|The agents ask Kobold {{for help}} finding the {{remaining}} perpetrator. When speaking to Kobold, he suddenly {{speaks in a}} strange backward whispering and erupts in convulsions. Reyes hears the word [...] "medicus," [...] meaning [...] "physician." [...] After putting Kobold {{in the custody of}} another guard named Custer, Doggett and Reyes race to Sampson's home and find her dead, with a dozen hypodermic needles jammed <b>into</b> <b>her</b> <b>face.</b> During a one-on-one confrontation, Kobold taunts Doggett about his personal life before vomiting all over him.

500|$|During {{the bridge}} of the song, the {{contestant}} is then visible at a hospital where a plastic surgeon injects botox <b>into</b> <b>her</b> <b>face.</b> In the scene, Beyoncé is pictured in a white straight jacket. She is then shown in another segment, being spray tanned in a bikini. At the end of the music video, Beyoncé loses the contest to a woman with albinism after which she happily congratulates her. The last scene depicts the singer looking happy and smiling with little make-up on her face. The final 30 seconds of the clip are intercepted into footage of Beyoncé, as a child, winning an award for Female Pop Vocalist on a television show. She appears onstage saying: [...] "I {{would like to thank the}} judges for picking me, my parents who I love. I love you Houston".|$|E
500|$|Fellini was {{a notorious}} perfectionist, {{and this could}} be trying for his cast. At an American Film Institute student seminar, Quinn spoke of Fellini's intransigence over {{selecting}} a box in which Zampanò carries his cigarette butts, scrutinizing over 500 boxes before finding just the right one: [...] "As for me, any of the boxes would have been satisfactory to carry the butts in, but not Federico". Quinn also recalled being particularly proud of a certain scene in which his performance had earned applause from onlookers on the set, only to receive {{a phone call from}} Fellini late that night informing him {{that they would have to}} re-do the entire sequence because Quinn had been too good: [...] "You see, you're supposed to be a bad, a terrible actor, but the people watching applauded you. They should have laughed at you. So in the morning we do it again." [...] As for Masina, Fellini insisted that she re-create the thin-lipped smile he had seen in her childhood photographs. He cut her hair by putting a bowl on her head and shearing off anything that wasn't covered up, afterwards plastering what remained with soap to give it a [...] "spiky, untidy look", then [...] "flicked talc <b>into</b> <b>her</b> <b>face</b> to give it the pallor of a kabuki performer." [...] He made her wear a World War I surplus cloak that was so frayed its collar cut into her neck. She complained: [...] "You're so nice and sweet to the others in the cast. Why are you so hard on me?" ...|$|E
500|$|Supervising {{animator}} Glen Keane designed Rapunzel {{under the}} tutelage of veteran animator Ollie Johnston, one of Disney's Nine Old Men. Johnston advised Keane to attempt to capture what Rapunzel is thinking as opposed to simply animating what the character is doing after reviewing one of his early pencil tests. Keane compared receiving this advice to receiving a [...] "slap that I never forgot, so when I was drawing over people's work, I really tried to get into the head of the thinking of the character". Co-director Byron Howard was inspired by the appearance of Ariel from Disney's The Little Mermaid (1989), a character who was also animated by Keane. Howard elaborated that [...] "Ariel was the first character that I ever thought there was a soul behind her eyes ... We hoped to do that with Rapunzel to find some sort of soul and depth that people could relate to". Meanwhile, Keane observed that Ariel and Rapunzel also share [...] "irrepressible" [...] spirits while encountering barriers that prevent them from pursuing their dreams. Keane was inspired by a book about the idea of feminine beauty; the book cited [...] "strangeness" [...] as [...] "the key to beauty ... in a woman's face." [...] Taking this into consideration, Keane maintained a sense of asymmetry while drawing Rapunzel, incorporating <b>into</b> <b>her</b> <b>face</b> several subtle imperfections, specifically her bucked teeth. The character was also drawn with freckles, making her the first Disney princess to have this feature. Keane designed Rapunzel with large eyes in order to convey her [...] "irrepressible quality", a trait her also discovered in Mandy Moore's voice. The animators created nine different versions of Rapunzel before finally settling on a design with which they were satisfied. Although Moore has observed some physical similairites between the character and herself, she maintains that Rapunzel's appearance was developed long before she became involved with the project, dismissing any similarities as [...] "coincidental".|$|E

2500|$|In {{order to}} make the film more {{accessible}} to American audiences, AIP trimmed over three minutes' worth of violence and [...] "objectionable" [...] content. Sequences excised or shortened included the burning [...] "S" [...] branded into Asa's flesh, the blood spewing from the mask after it was hammered <b>into</b> <b>her</b> <b>face,</b> the moist eyeball impalement of Kruvajan, and the flesh peeling off Vajda's face as he burned to death in the fireplace. In the original version of the film, Asa and Javuto were brother and sister; in the AIP version, Javuto became Asa's servant. In addition, some dialogue was [...] "softened," [...] including Asa's line, [...] "You, too, can find the joy and happiness of Hades!" [...] AIP modified it to [...] "You, too, can find the joy and happiness of hating!" ...|$|E
2500|$|All {{occupants}} of the ground floor were seriously injured. In the first-floor corridor, some occupants decided to {{lie down on the}} ground to show that they offered no resistance. Nonetheless, police beat them and kicked them when they arrived. Soon, there were police officers on all four floors of the building, kicking and battering prone occupants. In one corridor, police ordered a group of young men and women to kneel, so that they could batter them around the head and shoulders more easily. Here, Daniel Albrecht, a 21-year-old cello student from Berlin, had his head beaten so badly that he needed surgery to stop bleeding in his brain. The police also used humiliation to cow the {{occupants of}} the school. An officer who stood spread-legged in front of a kneeling and injured woman, grabbed his groin and thrust it <b>into</b> <b>her</b> <b>face.</b> Another who paused amid the beatings and took a knife to cut off hair from his victims, including Nicola Doherty; the constant shouting of insults; the officer who asked a group if they were OK and who reacted to the one who said [...] "No" [...] by handing out an extra beating.|$|E
