500|$|The son of {{pharmacist}} Walter Pierce and {{his wife}} Julia, Billy Pierce grew up in Highland Park, Michigan, and showed his first interest in baseball at age ten. He recalled: [...] "I refused to have my tonsils removed. My folks offered me a major league baseball and a good glove if I'd have the operation. I took the payola. It really was a thrill to throw around that 'league' ball." [...] After starting out as a first baseman, he switched to pitching to emulate his hero, Detroit Tigers star Tommy Bridges, who like Pierce had a slight build. He attended Highland Park Community High School where his teammates included future major league pitcher Ted Gray, and pitched six shutouts as a junior in 1944, earning the nickname [...] "Mr. Zero". He was the starting and winning pitcher in an East-West All-American Boys' Game sponsored by Esquire magazine, held on August 7, 1944 at the Polo Grounds in New York, with Connie Mack managing Pierce's East All-Stars; one reporter wrote, [...] "His fast ball was amazing {{when one considers that}} he only weighs 140 pounds. In civilian attire he seemed very slender." [...] The West team included catcher and future Hall of Fame center fielder Richie Ashburn, who was hitless in two at bats against Pierce. The game was held as a benefit for World War II community memorials, and two days prior to the event the participating players were guests of Babe Ruth on his weekly radio program. Pierce was voted the game's outstanding player, winning a four-year scholarship to the college of his choice. Detroit Free Press sports editor Dale Stafford, who chaperoned him to New York, later told a fellow writer, [...] "I never saw such a clean-living youngster. On our trip to New York for the East-West game, Billy kept a diary. One morning I found it open to this entry: 'Here it is ten o'clock and Mr. Stafford still hasn't gone to bed.'" [...] Pierce downplayed the experience of pitching in a major league stadium, stating, [...] "I was not nervous at the Polo Grounds, as I've pitched several games in Briggs Stadium back home. I've worked out there with the Tigers, and they, the Red Sox and the Phillies have been <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> <b>me.</b> But my folks and I decided that I'd make up my mind about playing pro ball after I graduated from high school." [...] After considering studying medicine at the University of Michigan, he signed with his hometown Tigers for a bonus of $15,000.|$|E
2500|$|This {{attention}} from the U.S. again brought Tani {{to the attention of}} the domestic Japanese media. At the time, Tani wrote, [...] "the fact that people are still <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> <b>me</b> - after almost 20 years away from the screen - fills me with buoyancy and surprise. It embarrasses me, too." [...] In this retrospective atmosphere, Tani was finally persuaded to return to film in 2000 to appear in Hideo Nakata's documentary on director Masaru Konuma entitled Sadistic and Masochistic.|$|E
2500|$|During {{the late}} 1990s Tani's work enjoyed a renewed surge of interest. Wife to be Sacrificed was {{released}} theatrically in the U.S. in 1998, playing in San Francisco, Los Angeles and New York City. In {{preparation for this}} event, Tani was interviewed by the U.S. publication, Asian Cult Cinema for its April, 1998 issue. Surprised by this attention from the U.S., Tani commented [...] "I didn't think U.S. movie fans were <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> <b>me</b> or my movies. I thought Americans ignored my films because of the SM theme, since these movies {{give the impression of}} being abusive toward women. Regardless of the filmmaker's intent - the intellectual or artistic merit - I thought Americans viewed these productions as politically incorrect." ...|$|E
60|$|BROADBENT. I did really. I {{wish you}} had taken half as much <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> <b>me.</b>|$|R
60|$|It's {{very kind}} of you to take an <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> <b>me.</b> My {{headache}} has passed off.|$|R
60|$|There {{was only}} one way to take with him. I appealed to his <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> Rachel, and his <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> <b>me.</b>|$|R
2500|$|Producer Lee Joon-ik {{revealed}} {{the story of}} how he chose Lee for The King and the Clown by just seeing him do handstands, saying, [...] "Just because of handstands, Lee Joon-gi became the person he is today." [...] After the film, Lee became [...] "an icon" [...] of the South Korean [...] "pretty boy" [...] trend. Lee has since tried to downplay this kkonminam image, saying that his character Gong-gil in the film felt like a foot chain for him so he wanted to escape from it: [...] "After my performance in The King and the Clown, I found myself at the forefront of this ‘pretty boy’ trend, whether or not that was my intention. Suddenly, people were <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> <b>me,</b> and there was all this praise and criticism all at the same time. Everything was just so overwhelming. I felt like I was floating on air." ...|$|E
60|$|There's a good deal. I {{really had}} no idea the world was so <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> <b>me.</b>|$|E
60|$|GERALD. But I've a queer {{feeling that}} you have a {{permanent}} occasion to be <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> <b>me.</b> I only half like it.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes! yes! Certainly!" [...] {{cried the}} elderly gentleman. [...] "But--er--why should {{these young men}} take such an <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> <b>me,</b> a stranger?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'It is strange,' she said, frowning, 'that {{you should}} still press an {{undesired}} <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> <b>me</b> and my acquaintances, <b>in</b> <b>me</b> and my affairs, Mr Clennam. I don't {{know what you}} mean.' ...|$|R
6000|$|He.--You {{have always}} taken some <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> <b>me,</b> because I am a [...] bon diable, whom you rather despise at bottom, but who diverts [...] you.|$|R
60|$|THE GIRL. Wreford thought it'd {{comfort him}} to know you were <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> <b>me.</b> 'E's so 'ot-headed I'm sure somethin'll come to 'im.|$|E
60|$|P. S. Father said I {{had better}} write {{because you would}} be more <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> <b>me,</b> just now, than {{in the rest of}} the family.|$|E
60|$|RIDGEON [with a self-assured {{shake of}} the head] I've {{a pretty good}} flair {{for that sort of}} thing. I know when a woman is <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> <b>me.</b> She is.|$|E
500|$|... "The {{programme}} sparked an <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> <b>me,</b> <b>in</b> {{the same}} way it has in so many tens of thousands of children down the years, igniting a passion that lasts a lifetime." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Well, yes, I {{suppose you}} would. You {{must have taken}} a deeper <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> <b>me</b> than <b>in</b> the others, since you married me. I hadn't thought of that.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Here is no priest, Signore, and I carry {{a weight}} past bearing. The only {{man who has}} shown <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> <b>me,</b> for three long and dreadful years, is gone!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "How comes it," [...] he said, [...] "that {{you are so}} much <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> <b>me?</b> I {{remember}} seeing you two years ago, but have no recollection of having done you any service." ...|$|E
6000|$|After {{a proper}} {{interval}} I volunteered some valuable {{data concerning the}} mosquitoes and flies I had encountered on my recent trip into the wilderness of British Columbia. He became <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> <b>me.</b> [...] "Oh! You've been to the Klondike!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, that is strange," [...] she declared. [...] "You are {{upsetting}} {{one of my}} pet theories. All the men whom I {{have ever}} known have been more curious than women. Are you <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> <b>me,</b> by any chance, Sir Julien?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{fear that}} it would be idle, madame. Yet your <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> <b>me</b> is very flattering, and I thank you. It is unfortunate for me that I am so headstrong." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Of course, Ruthven," [...] Frank said, [...] "I {{would not}} put your father to such trouble. He is {{very kind to}} have taken so much <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> <b>me,</b> only I hate--" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Your {{knowledge}} of my movements," [...] he declared, [...] "is very flattering. It suggests an <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> <b>me,</b> I admit, but I {{have yet to}} be convinced that that <b>interest</b> is <b>in</b> any way personal." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I can't {{be made to}} {{feel the}} more obliged by your exaggerating the case," [...] he said. [...] "I am {{sensible}} {{that you have been}} <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> <b>me,</b> and I say I am much obliged to you. What more would you have?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{wonder what}} he thinks of me, really? He must have felt <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> <b>me,</b> else he would not have sent me my necklace. I {{wonder what he}} thinks of my marriage? What notions has he to make him so grave about things? Why is he come to Diplow?" ...|$|E
60|$|He {{was lying}} almost at full length in the chair, {{his eyes fixed}} in dreamy {{abstraction}} upon the ceiling. As I came towards him, he drew at the cigarette between his fingers, glanced at me, looked away again, and expelled another mouthful of smoke. He was not <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> <b>me.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... 'These rascals, the post-nati, get {{the better}} of us of the old school at every turn,' said Mr. Pleydell. 'But she must convey and make over her <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> <b>me</b> to Lucy.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "DEAR MISS GARTH--I {{have just}} written, {{with a heavy}} heart, to my uncle, and I think I owe it to your kind <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> <b>me</b> not to omit writing next to you.|$|R
6000|$|... "To all thy severe {{opinions}} of sobriety and dignity of conduct, wouldst thou but feel sufficient <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> <b>me</b> {{to let me}} know that my acts can give thee either pain or pleasure." ...|$|R
6000|$|When {{they were}} gone she said to Kennicott, [...] "Your friends have the manners of a barroom. They expect me to wait on them like a servant. They're not so much <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> <b>me</b> as {{they would be in}} a waiter, because they don't have to tip me. Unfortunately! Well, good night." ...|$|E
60|$|In {{the whole}} of the {{metropolis}} there was but one person whom I considered a friend. That was Mr. Ira Mason, who had his law offices in the same building with Stillwell, Grinder & Co. I had done a number of errands for this gentleman, and in return he had become <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> <b>me.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "Now, then," [...] said I to myself, proudly {{gazing at}} these lines, [...] "this {{is only a}} small thing, but the girl who would write it, and who would expect me to read it, must be <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> <b>me.</b> She {{believes}} that I would not fail to come here again; therefore she believes in me. That is a great point." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Not now," [...] {{said the}} Ork. [...] "I {{appreciate}} your <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> <b>me,</b> which I fully deserve; but I only fly when I am going somewhere, and if I got started I might not stop." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Of a gentleman,' said Lizzie. '--I {{hardly know}} how to tell you--of a gentleman far above me and my way of life, who broke father's death to me, and has shown an <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> <b>me</b> since.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well," [...] he said, [...] "since plain {{speaking}} seems admissible, you {{are probably}} aware that Laura Waynefleet has nothing beyond a kindly <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> <b>me.</b> She is, I needn't point out, a remarkably sensible young lady." ...|$|R
