5|$|The {{situation}} was {{made worse by}} the fact that Icesave was operating as a branch of Landsbanki, rather than as a legally independent subsidiary.

The UK Financial Services Authority (FSA) was aware of the risk, and was considering imposing special liquidity requirements on Icelandic deposit-taking banks in the weeks before the crisis. However the plan – which was never implemented – would have forced the Icelandic banks to cut interest rates or stop taking new deposits, and might even have sparked the sort of bank run it was designed to prevent. The <b>Guernsey</b> authorities were also planning on bringing in restrictions on foreign banks operating as branches and on transfers of funds between <b>Guernsey</b> subsidiaries and parent banks ("parental upstreaming"). Landsbanki operated in <b>Guernsey</b> through a legally independent subsidiary.|$|E
