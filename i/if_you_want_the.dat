500|$|The {{album was}} {{supposed}} to be released in late 2007, but Carey spoke about reason the album got delayed: [...] "You can't really put records out in December <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>the</b> whole world {{to have a chance to}} actually hear it, [...] my fans all over the world are very important to me", adding that she also wants to put out a pair of singles before the album drops. In a separate interview, she elaborated further: [...] "This happened to me with The Emancipation of Mimi, I started writing more songs, I was like okay let me get these done, then I wrote four more songs and you know how it goes, so now I'm like 22 songs in and clearly I have to cut some of those down". It was then reported that the album will be released in February 2008. However, the release was later pushed back yet again to April 2008.|$|E
500|$|Idol was keen {{to share}} his ideas {{regarding}} the future of Cyberculture {{and its impact on}} the music industry, and was noted for his enthusiastic speculation in the future of computers throughout the promotion of the album. [...] "You're using very sort of extreme and raw ideas, but with very high level technology... it's probably whats going to be happeningor in fact, it is what is happening nowbecause that's how we made this album, Cyberpunk." [...] Some of the predictions Idol made for the future of the internet, computers, and musicians, was that it would allow for cheap and efficient recording from home; that musicians could record their music and send it to producers and fellow band members from great distances, perhaps while on tour; and that musicians would be able to directly communicate with their fans and critics. Idol also hoped that the rapid ability to do whatever he desired with the production would allow raw forms of rock music to remain relevant after the Grunge movement swept America in the early 90s. [...] " [...] can do anything... <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>the</b> music backwards, it can be backwards in a snap. This is in a way my sort of answer to grunge. I know there's a way of using this modern technology to bring a lot of rawness back." ...|$|E
