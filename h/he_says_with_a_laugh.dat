[...] "She had the painting hanging in her Chelsea studio, and I found myself returning {{to it when}} I went in to see her new work. It's called 'Toxic Walk in the Park.' I don't know what the figures are doing, what they're walking away from, or towards. I do know that they're outfitted for a tough journey, and they're together, maybe {{walking out of the}} frame entirely." [...] <b>He</b> <b>says,</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>laugh,</b> [...] "For better or worse, I can relate." ...|$|E
5000|$|... "I really don't miss it," [...] {{he says of}} {{his brief}} Hollywood heyday. [...] "I've got my own company. I live in a great area. I have great kids. I surf every other day. I've got it all as far as I'm concerned." [...] Still, he hasn't quite shaken the acting bug. According to People, Hewitt learned of an {{industry}} ad asking if anyone knew where he was. Some filmmakers, it turned out, thought he would be perfect for a lead role in a movie about drugged-out gay prostitutes in West Hollywood. [...] "It wasn't for me", <b>he</b> <b>says</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>laugh.</b> [...] "I politely declined." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Toby," [...] <b>he</b> <b>says,</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> quiet smile, [...] "the {{little man}} will now walk three times round the Cairawan, and retire behind the curtain." ...|$|R

6000|$|The guide's face brightens; he {{has beaten}} the true {{state of the}} case into our stupid heads at last! [...] "That's just what I mean!" [...] <b>he</b> <b>says,</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> air of {{infinite}} relief.|$|R
6000|$|Pen {{kissed her}} Ladyship's. [...] "I {{have been to}} Tunbridge," [...] <b>he</b> <b>says,</b> [...] "and seen Miss Amory; and find on my arrival that--that a villain has transplanted me in her affections," [...] <b>he</b> <b>says</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> tragedy air.|$|R
5000|$|... "I am {{a master}} {{craftsman}} {{as far as}} making sweets are concerned, and I am {{an expert on the}} traditions and norms of sweet-making," [...] <b>he</b> <b>says</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> twinkle in his eye, and no hint of modesty.|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{see what}} I am come to, Pen," [...] <b>he</b> <b>says</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> heartbroken voice, trying, with hands {{all of a}} tremble, to tie the hat on the boy's head. He laughs bitterly at the ill success of his endeavours. [...] "Oh, you silly papa!" [...] laughs Tommy, too.|$|R
5000|$|In the 1967 stop-motion film Mad Monster Party, Baron von Frankenstein tests his new potion on a raven, {{and lets}} it fly until it lands {{on a tree}} branch.

6000|$|... "I can't think why {{you keep}} it up," [...] he remarks, and then almost wearily tells me the facts about my Utopian self. They are a little {{difficult}} to understand. <b>He</b> <b>says</b> I {{am one of the}} samurai, which sounds Japanese, [...] "but you will be degraded," [...] <b>he</b> <b>says,</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> gesture almost of despair. He describes my position in this world in phrases that convey very little.|$|R
6000|$|Mr. Jasper, {{with his}} hand to his chin, and <b>with</b> <b>an</b> {{expression}} of musing benevolence on his face, has attentively watched every animated look and gesture attending the delivery of these words. He remains in that attitude after they, are spoken, as if in a kind of fascination attendant on his strong interest in the youthful spirit that he loves so well. Then <b>he</b> <b>says</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> quiet smile: ...|$|R
5000|$|... 'The {{idea is to}} put {{a record}} out next year', <b>he</b> <b>says.</b> 'We {{actually}} get on really well at the moment because we don't spend time in the studio together', <b>he</b> <b>says</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> wry grin. 'Me and Tricky wrote some new tracks in Paris last year, which haven't seen {{the light of day}} yet - but that was fun. They should be on the next album.' Robert Del Naja, Metro, 23 May 2013 ...|$|R
50|$|A narrow pathway {{goes down}} from the road, {{by the side of}} his shop, {{to the point where the}} river gets split into seven. On the banks, there are about 20 sacks of sand piled up. The local people have {{collected}} it for their own use, not for selling, a passerby informs you. Tourists do come, in a small way, but only during weekends, when they want to chill out, <b>he</b> <b>says</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> mischievous smile.|$|R
5000|$|At {{the end of}} the story, Number 6 and Alice Drake have {{returned}} to London. 6 is clean-shaven and tidily dressed. Alice asks 6 who Number 1 was. 6 asks in reply, [...] "Does the presence of Number 2 require the existence of Number 1?" [...] He assures her that the secrets the Village sought from him are safe. [...] "None of us would be here if they weren't," [...] <b>he</b> <b>says</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> confident smile.|$|R
6000|$|... "It's no good, old man," [...] <b>he</b> <b>says,</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> sickly smile, {{so full of}} pathos that it is {{impossible}} to find it in one's heart to feel anything but pity for him. [...] "I can't help it. I have given way to this sort of thing too long. It is too late to reform now. You go on and get a drink somewhere; I'll join you again in a few minutes. Don't worry about me; it's no good." ...|$|R

6000|$|He waggles <b>a</b> {{negation}} <b>with</b> his head. He would intimate {{his position}} is too responsible a one for jesting, {{and both of}} us in our several ways enjoy the pleasure we poor humans have in meeting with intellectual inferiority. [...] "The Standing Committee of Identification," [...] <b>he</b> <b>says,</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> eye on a memorandum, [...] "has remitted your case to the Research Professor of Anthropology in the University of London, and {{they want you to}} go there, if you will, and talk to him." ...|$|R
60|$|It was {{perfectly}} delightful to behold with what enthusiasm Mr. Peggotty became inspired {{when he thought}} of his little favourite. He stands before me again, his bluff hairy face irradiating <b>with</b> <b>a</b> joyful love and pride, for which I can find no description. His honest eyes fire up, and sparkle, as if their depths were stirred by something bright. His broad chest heaves with pleasure. His strong loose hands clench themselves, in his earnestness; and he emphasizes what <b>he</b> <b>says</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> right arm that shows, in my pigmy view, like a sledge-hammer.|$|R
6000|$|As {{the first}} guests began to go, Mr. Fletcher's friend beckoned to him; and <b>he</b> rose, <b>saying</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> accent of regret which changed {{to one of}} entreaty, as he put his question: ...|$|R
6000|$|He {{would look}} round surprised.'Me?' <b>he</b> would <b>say,</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> smile. By {{this time the}} collegian would be up with him, and he would paternally add,'What have you forgotten? What can I do for you?' ...|$|R
40|$|When {{someone who}} has been astonishingly successful, whether in {{building}} an immense fortune or in some other form of activity, tells us the 2 ̆ 2 secret 2 ̆ 2 of his success, we may do well to take what <b>he</b> <b>says</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> grain of salt. It is not that he does not mean to tell the truth; no doubt he does. He may, however, have been guided by a sure instinct for the right thing to do, without really under standing why. When he attempts to explain it, his guess may be quite mistaken...|$|R
6000|$|To {{avoid the}} {{appearance}} of priggishness, which he dreads with some reason, he {{even went so far}} as to procure a herb tobacco, which he smokes with the help of frequent sulphur matches. This he recommends to us strongly. [...] "Won't you try it?" [...] <b>he</b> <b>says,</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> winning smile. [...] "Just once." [...] And he is the only man I ever met who drinks that facetious fluid, non-alcoholic beer. Once he proposed to wean me upon that from my distinctive vice, which led indeed to our first rupture. [...] "I find it delicious," [...] he said in pathetic surprise.|$|R
6000|$|Tommy took no new partner, however, for {{distrust}} {{had entered}} in, and poisoned {{the peace of}} his once confiding soul. Ned offered to join him, but <b>he</b> declined, <b>saying,</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> sense of justice that did him honor, ...|$|R
6000|$|The doctor {{pulled his}} arm {{over his eyes}} and sat down again. Presently <b>he</b> was <b>saying</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> long face: [...] "I came here to {{denounce}} the cause of your unhappiness, and I begin to see it is myself." ...|$|R

60|$|<b>He</b> <b>says</b> this <b>with</b> <b>a</b> savage air, and {{a spring}} or start at her. Quite unmoved she retouches and replenishes the {{contents}} of the bowl with her little spatula. Seeing her intent upon the occupation, he sinks into his former attitude.|$|R
6000|$|... "Not willingly, Cynthia. Oh, not willingly," [...] he began. Then of {{a sudden}} he checked his tongue, and asked himself what <b>he</b> was <b>saying.</b> <b>With</b> <b>a</b> half-laugh and a courtier manner, he continued, [...] "Of two evils, madam, we must choose the lesser one." ...|$|R
6000|$|Mr. Barnes Newcome {{presently}} arrived, looking particularly {{smart and}} lively, <b>with</b> <b>a</b> large flower in his button-hole, and {{leaning on the}} arm of a friend. [...] "How do you do, Pendennis?" [...] <b>he</b> <b>says,</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> peculiarly dandified air. [...] "Did you dine here? You look as if you dined here" [...] (and Barnes, certainly, as if he had dined elsewhere). [...] "I was only asked to the cold soiree. Who did you have for dinner? You had my mamma and the Baughtons, and my uncle and aunt, I know, for they are down below in the library, waiting for the carriage: he is asleep, and she is as sulky as a bear." ...|$|R
5000|$|José Jalapeño on a Stick - A giant sombrero wearing jalapeño pepper {{on a stick}} (or [...] "steek" [...] as <b>he</b> <b>says</b> it <b>with</b> <b>a</b> {{stressed}} Latin accent). Peanut is mean to José, frequently mocking José's {{being on}} a stick, and his accent.|$|R
5000|$|Pete visits Joe {{in prison}} and {{suggests}} giving back at least the stolen portion of {{the money in the}} hope of a lighter sentence. Joe explains that he's <b>an</b> old man <b>with</b> no family and now, no friends. [...] "I'm a prisoner, in prison or out." [...] Now, he no longer has to cook or clean for himself, eats three square meals a day, and is being treated like a king by his fellow inmates, who will soon start asking where he hid the money. He tells Pete to enjoy his [...] "inheritance", and not to worry about him. [...] "Besides," [...] <b>he</b> <b>says,</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> wink, [...] "no tinhorn joint like this could ever hold me!" ...|$|R

5000|$|Wikipedia {{is like an}} old and {{eccentric}} uncle.He {{can be a lot}} of fun—over {{the years}} he's seen a lot, and he can tell a great story. He's also no dummy; he's accumulated a lot of information and has some strong opinions about what he's gathered. You can learn quite a bit from him. But take everything <b>he</b> <b>says</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> grain of salt. A lot of the things he thinks he knows for sure aren't quite right, or are taken out of context. And {{when it comes down to}} it, sometimes he believes things that are a little bit, well, nuts.If it ever matters to you whether something he said is real or fictional, it's crucial to check it out <b>with</b> <b>a</b> more reliable source.|$|R

6000|$|He {{frequently}} {{made use}} of the expression [...] "in the three kingdoms," [...] which sometimes preceded a statement that his grandmother was descended from Richard III., while his grandfather {{came down from the}} Cornish giants, one of whom, <b>he</b> would <b>say</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> disparaging smile, had once thrown a cow over a wall.|$|R
