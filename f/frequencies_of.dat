5|$|Another {{brute force}} {{approach}} is to match up the frequency distribution of the letters. By graphing the <b>frequencies</b> <b>of</b> letters in the ciphertext, and by knowing the expected distribution of those letters in the original language of the plaintext, a human can easily spot {{the value of the}} shift by looking at the displacement of particular features of the graph. This is known as frequency analysis. For example, in the English language the plaintext <b>frequencies</b> <b>of</b> the letters E, T, (usually most frequent), and Q, Z (typically least frequent) are particularly distinctive. Computers can also do this by measuring how well the actual frequency distribution matches up with the expected distribution; for example, the chi-squared statistic can be used.|$|E

5|$|A pulse with {{different}} group and phase velocities (which occurs if the phase velocity {{is not the}} same for all the <b>frequencies</b> <b>of</b> the pulse) smears out over time, a process known as dispersion. Certain materials have an exceptionally low (or even zero) group velocity for light waves, a phenomenon called slow light, which has been confirmed in various experiments.|$|E
5|$|From a Neo-Darwinian perspective, {{evolution}} {{occurs when}} there are changes in the <b>frequencies</b> <b>of</b> alleles within a population of interbreeding organisms. For example, the allele for black colour in a population of moths becoming more common. Mechanisms {{that can lead to}} changes in allele frequencies include natural selection, genetic drift, genetic hitchhiking, mutation and gene flow.|$|E
5|$|In {{telecommunication}} networks, heterodyning {{is used to}} move <b>frequencies</b> <b>of</b> {{individual signals}} to different channels which may share a single physical transmission line. This is called frequency division multiplexing (FDM). For example, a coaxial cable used by a cable television system can carry 500 television channels {{at the same time}} because each one is given a different frequency, so they don't interfere with one another. Continuous wave (CW) doppler radar detectors are basically heterodyne detection devices that compare transmitted and reflected beams.|$|E
40|$|A {{method for}} calculating a {{property}} of a fluid includes inducing motion in a conduit {{such that the}} conduit oscillates in a first mode of vibration and a second mode of vibration. The first mode of vibration has a corresponding first <b>frequency</b> <b>of</b> vibration and the second mode of vibration has a corresponding second <b>frequency</b> <b>of</b> vibration. The conduit contains a fluid. The first <b>frequency</b> <b>of</b> vibration is determined, and the second <b>frequency</b> <b>of</b> vibration is determined.

50|$|In the {{original}} Tversky and Kahneman (1973) research, three major {{factors that are}} discussed are the <b>frequency</b> <b>of</b> repetition, <b>frequency</b> <b>of</b> co-occurrence, and illusory correlation. The use <b>of</b> <b>frequency</b> <b>of</b> repetition aids in the retrieval of relevant instances. The idea behind this phenomenon, {{is that the more}} an instance is repeated within a category or list, the stronger the link between the two instances becomes. Individuals then use the strong association between the instances to determine the <b>frequency</b> <b>of</b> an instance. Consequently, the association between the category or list and the specific instance, often influences <b>frequency</b> judgements. <b>Frequency</b> <b>of</b> co-occurrence strongly relates to <b>Frequency</b> <b>of</b> repetition, such that the more an item-pair is repeated, the stronger the association between the two items becomes, leading to a bias when estimating <b>frequency</b> <b>of</b> co-occurrence. Due to the phenomena <b>of</b> <b>frequency</b> <b>of</b> co-occurrence, Illusory correlations also often play a big role.|$|R
5|$|Natural {{selection}} {{will only}} cause evolution {{if there is}} enough genetic variation in a population. Before the discovery of Mendelian genetics, one common hypothesis was blending inheritance. But with blending inheritance, genetic variance would be rapidly lost, making evolution by natural selection implausible. The Hardy–Weinberg principle provides the solution to how variation is maintained in a population with Mendelian inheritance. The <b>frequencies</b> <b>of</b> alleles (variations in a gene) will remain constant {{in the absence of}} selection, mutation, migration and genetic drift.|$|E

5|$|Optical {{heterodyne}} detection {{is an essential}} technique used in high-accuracy measurements of the <b>frequencies</b> <b>of</b> optical sources, {{as well as in}} the stabilization of their frequencies. Until a relatively few years ago, lengthy frequency chains were needed to connect the microwave frequency of a cesium or other atomic time source to optical frequencies. At each step of the chain, a frequency multiplier would be used to produce a harmonic of the frequency of that step, which would be compared by {{heterodyne detection}} with the next step (the output of a microwave source, far infrared laser, infrared laser, or visible laser). Each measurement of a single spectral line required several years of effort in the construction of a custom frequency chain. Currently, optical frequency combs have provided a much simpler method of measuring optical frequencies. If a mode-locked laser is modulated to form a train of pulses, its spectrum is seen to consist of the carrier frequency surrounded by a closely spaced comb of optical sideband frequencies with a spacing equal to the pulse repetition frequency (Fig.16). The pulse repetition frequency is locked to that of the frequency standard, and the <b>frequencies</b> <b>of</b> the comb elements at the red end of the spectrum are doubled and heterodyned with the <b>frequencies</b> <b>of</b> the comb elements at the blue end of the spectrum, thus allowing the comb to serve as its own reference. In this manner, locking of the frequency comb output to an atomic standard can be performed in a single step. To measure an unknown frequency, the frequency comb output is dispersed into a spectrum. The unknown frequency is overlapped with the appropriate spectral segment of the comb and the frequency of the resultant heterodyne beats is measured.|$|E

5|$|The {{results of}} {{statistical}} analysis will be strongly affected by any errors {{in identifying the}} inventory of glyphs, {{as well as by}} divergence from a purely syllabic representation, such as a glyph for reduplication. There are also large differences in the <b>frequencies</b> <b>of</b> individual syllables among the Rapanui texts, which makes any direct identification problematic.

5|$|The {{study of}} {{vibrations}} in bikes includes its causes, such as engine balance, wheel balance, ground surface, and aerodynamics; its transmission and absorption; {{and its effects}} on the bike, the rider, and safety. An important factor in any vibration analysis is a comparison of the natural <b>frequencies</b> <b>of</b> the system with the possible driving <b>frequencies</b> <b>of</b> the vibration sources. A close match means mechanical resonance that can result in large amplitudes. A challenge in vibration damping is to create compliance in certain directions (vertically) without sacrificing frame rigidity needed for power transmission and handling (torsionally). Another issue with vibration for the bike is the possibility of failure due to material fatigue Effects of vibration on riders include discomfort, loss of efficiency, Hand-Arm Vibration Syndrome, a secondary form Raynaud's disease, and whole body vibration. Vibrating instruments may be inaccurate or difficult to read.|$|E
5|$|There are {{numerous}} applications of matrices, both {{in mathematics and}} other sciences. Some of them merely {{take advantage of the}} compact representation of a set of numbers in a matrix.

5|$|While natural {{selection}} has a direction, guiding evolution towards heritable adaptations {{to the current}} environment, genetic drift has no direction and is guided only by the mathematics of chance. As a result, drift acts upon the genotypic frequencies within a population without regard to their phenotypic effects. In contrast, selection favors the spread of alleles whose phenotypic effects increase survival and/or reproduction of their carriers, lowers the <b>frequencies</b> <b>of</b> alleles that cause unfavorable traits, and ignores those that are neutral.|$|E
5|$|As the 100,000-year {{periodicity}} only {{dominates the}} climate of the past million years, there is insufficient information to separate the component <b>frequencies</b> <b>of</b> eccentricity using spectral analysis, making the reliable detection of significant longer-term trends more difficult, although the spectral analysis of much longer palaeoclimate records, such as the Lisiecki and Raymo stack of marine cores and James Zachos' composite isotopic record, helps to put the last million years in longer term context. Hence {{there is still no}} clear proof of the mechanism responsible for the 100ka periodicity—but there are several credible hypotheses.|$|E

Early sejms have seen mostly majority voting, but beginning in the 17th century, unanimous voting became more common, and 32 sejms were vetoed with the infamous liberum veto, particularly {{in the first half}} of the 18th century. This vetoing procedure has been credited with significantly paralyzing the Commonwealth governance.|$|E

5|$|Jupiter is a {{powerful}} source of radio waves in the spectral region stretching from several kilohertz to tens of megahertz. Radio waves with <b>frequencies</b> <b>of</b> less than about 0.3MHz (and thus wavelengths longer than 1km) are called the Jovian kilometric radiation or KOM. Those with frequencies in the interval of 0.3–3MHz (with wavelengths of 100–1000m) are called the hectometric radiation or HOM, while emissions in the range 3–40MHz (with wavelengths of 10–100m) {{are referred to as}} the decametric radiation or DAM. The latter radiation was the first to be observed from Earth, and its approximately 10-hour periodicity helped to identify it as originating from Jupiter. The strongest part of decametric emission, which is related to Io and to the Io–Jupiter current system, is called Io-DAM.|$|E
5|$|The comb-line filter {{is similar}} to the {{interdigital}} filter in that it lends itself to mechanical assembly in a metal case without dielectric support. In the case of the comb-line, all the lines are short-circuited at the same end rather than alternate ends.

5|$|The fixed {{reed and}} fairly uniform {{diameter}} of the clarinet give the instrument an acoustical behavior approximating that of a cylindrical stopped pipe.

Adjusting {{the angle of the}} bore taper controls the <b>frequencies</b> <b>of</b> the overblown notes (harmonics). Changing the mouthpiece's tip opening and the length of the reed changes aspects of the harmonic timbre or voice of the clarinet because this changes the speed of reed vibrations.
