5|$|Carbon is ordinarily {{classified}} as a nonmetal but has some metallic properties and is occasionally {{classified as}} a metalloid. Hexagonal graphitic carbon (graphite) is the most thermodynamically stable allotrope of carbon under ambient conditions. It has a lustrous appearance and is a fairly good electrical conductor. Graphite has a layered structure. Each layer comprises carbon atoms bonded to three other carbon atoms in a honeycomb lattice arrangement. The layers are stacked together and held loosely by van der Waals forces and <b>delocalized</b> valence electrons.|$|E
5|$|Cerium has a {{variable}} electronic structure. The {{energy of the}} 4f electron is nearly {{the same as that}} of the outer 5d and 6s electrons that are <b>delocalized</b> in the metallic state, and only a small amount of energy is required to change the relative occupancy of these electronic levels. This gives rise to dual valence states. For example, a volume change of about 10% occurs when cerium is subjected to high pressures or low temperatures. It appears that the valence changes from about 3 to 4 when it is cooled or compressed.|$|E
5|$|Metals make {{relatively}} good conductors of heat, primarily because the <b>delocalized</b> electrons {{are free to}} transport thermal energy between atoms. However, unlike electrical conductivity, the thermal conductivity of a metal is nearly independent of temperature. This is expressed mathematically by the Wiedemann–Franz law, which states that the ratio of thermal conductivity to the electrical conductivity {{is proportional to the}} temperature. The thermal disorder in the metallic lattice increases the electrical resistivity of the material, producing a temperature dependence for electric current.|$|E
50|$|Certain substituents {{are better}} at {{stabilizing}} radical centers than others. This {{is influenced by the}} substituent's ability to <b>delocalize</b> the radical ion in the transition state structure. <b>Delocalizing</b> the radical ion stabilizes the transition state structure. As a result, the energy of activation decreases, enhancing the rate of the overall reaction. According to the captodative effect, the rate of a reaction is the greatest when both the EDG and EWG are able to <b>delocalize</b> the radical ion in the transition state structure.|$|R
40|$|We investigate, both {{analytically}} and numerically, {{the conditions}} for the occurrence of the <b>delocalizing</b> transition phenomenon of one-dimensional localized modes of several nonlinear continuous periodic and discrete systems of the nonlinear Schrodinger type. We show that either non-existence of solitons in the small amplitude limit or the loss of stability along existence branches can lead to <b>delocalizing</b> transitions, which occur following different scenarios. Examples of <b>delocalizing</b> transitions of both types are provided for a class of equations which describe single component and binary mixtures of Bose-Einstein condensates trapped in linear and nonlinear optical lattices...|$|R
40|$|It {{is shown}} that inhomogeneous {{nonlinear}} interactions in a Bose-Einstein condensate loaded in an optical lattice {{can result in}} <b>delocalizing</b> transition in one dimension, what sharply contrasts to the known behavior of discrete and periodic systems with homogeneous nonlinearity. The transition can be originated either by decreasing the amplitude of the linear periodic potential or by the change of the mean value of the periodic nonlinearity. The dynamics of the <b>delocalizing</b> transition is studied...|$|R
5|$|Silver is an {{extremely}} soft, ductile and malleable transition metal, though it is slightly less malleable than gold. Silver crystallizes in a face-centered cubic lattice with bulk coordination number 12, where only the single 5s electron is <b>delocalized,</b> similarly to copper and gold. Unlike metals with incomplete d-shells, metallic bonds in silver are lacking a covalent character and are relatively weak. This observation explains the low hardness and high ductility of single crystals of silver.|$|E
5|$|At a given temperature, each {{material}} has an electrical conductivity that determines {{the value of}} electric current when an electric potential is applied. Examples of good conductors include metals such as copper and gold, whereas glass and Teflon are poor conductors. In any dielectric material, the electrons remain bound to their respective atoms and the material behaves as an insulator. Most semiconductors have a variable level of conductivity that lies between the extremes of conduction and insulation. On the other hand, metals have an electronic band structure containing partially filled electronic bands. The presence of such bands allows electrons in metals to behave {{as if they were}} free or <b>delocalized</b> electrons. These electrons are not associated with specific atoms, so when an electric field is applied, they are free to move like a gas (called Fermi gas) through the material much like free electrons.|$|E
5|$|In the {{periodic}} table, {{some of the}} elements adjacent to the commonly recognised metalloids, although usually classified as either metals or nonmetals, are occasionally referred to as near-metalloids or noted for their metalloidal character. To {{the left of the}} metal–nonmetal dividing line, such elements include gallium, tin and bismuth. They show unusual packing structures, marked covalent chemistry (molecular or polymeric), and amphoterism. To the right of the dividing line are carbon, phosphorus, selenium and iodine. They exhibit metallic lustre, semiconducting properties and bonding or valence bands with <b>delocalized</b> character. This applies to their most thermodynamically stable forms under ambient conditions: carbon as graphite; phosphorus as black phosphorus; and selenium as grey selenium.|$|E
5000|$|... every atom in {{the ring}} {{must be able to}} {{participate}} in <b>delocalizing</b> the electrons by having a p-orbital or an unshared pair of electrons.|$|R
40|$|We {{consider}} {{the motion of}} a discrete random surface interacting by exclusion with a random wall. Two cases are considered: rarefied walls and walls of random height. The dynamics is given by the serial harness process. In the first case, we prove that the process <b>delocalizes</b> iff {{the mean number of}} visits to the set of sites where the wall is present by a random walk is infinite. When the surface <b>delocalizes,</b> bounds on its average speed are obtained. In the case of walls of random height, we study the effect of the distribution of the wall heights on the repulsion speed...|$|R
50|$|In general, cyanide is an {{electronegative}} substituent. Thus, for example, cyanide-substituted carboxylic acids tend to {{be stronger}} than the parents. The cyanide group can also stabilize anions by <b>delocalizing</b> negative charge as revealed by resonance structures.|$|R
5|$|Lead's lighter carbon group {{congeners}} form stable or metastable allotropes {{with the}} tetrahedrally coordinated and covalently bonded diamond cubic structure. The energy levels of their outer s- and p-orbitals are {{close enough to}} allow mixing into four hybrid sp3 orbitals. In lead, the inert pair effect increases the separation between its s- and p-orbitals, and the gap cannot be overcome by the energy that would be released by extra bonds following hybridization. Rather than having a diamond cubic structure, lead forms metallic bonds in which only the p-electrons are <b>delocalized</b> and shared between the Pb2+ ions. Lead consequently has a face-centered cubic structure like the similarly sized divalent metals calcium and strontium.|$|E
5|$|Plutonium is {{an element}} in which the 5f {{electrons}} are the transition border between <b>delocalized</b> and localized; it is therefore {{considered one of the}} most complex elements. The anomalous behavior of plutonium is caused by its electronic structure. The energy difference between the 6d and 5f subshells is very low. The size of the 5f shell is just enough to allow the electrons to form bonds within the lattice, on the very boundary between localized and bonding behavior. The proximity of energy levels leads to multiple low-energy electron configurations with near equal energy levels. This leads to competing 5fn7s2 and 5fn−16d17s2 configurations, which causes the complexity of its chemical behavior. The highly directional nature of 5f orbitals is responsible for directional covalent bonds in molecules and complexes of plutonium.|$|E
5|$|The {{structural}} {{chemistry of}} boron {{is dominated by}} its small atomic size, and relatively high ionization energy. With only three valence electrons per boron atom, simple covalent bonding cannot fulfil the octet rule. Metallic bonding is the usual result among the heavier congenors of boron but this generally requires low ionization energies. Instead, because of its small size and high ionization energies, the basic structural unit of boron (and nearly all of its allotropes) is the icosahedral B12 cluster. Of the 36 electrons associated with 12 boron atoms, 26 reside in 13 <b>delocalized</b> molecular orbitals; the other 10 electrons are used to form two- and three-centre covalent bonds between icosahedra. The same motif can be seen, as are deltahedral variants or fragments, in metal borides and hydride derivatives, and in some halides.|$|E
2500|$|Researchers {{have been}} able to {{increase}} the reactivity of fullerenes by attaching active groups to their surfaces. Buckminsterfullerene does not exhibit [...] "superaromaticity": that is, the electrons in the hexagonal rings do not <b>delocalize</b> over the whole molecule.|$|R
40|$|Combined nanoindentation and XTEM {{investigations}} {{were carried}} out on TiC/a-C nanocomposite coatings. The most striking findings related to the deformation and toughening mechanisms are: firstly, multiple shear bands <b>delocalizing</b> shear deformation and secondly nanoparticles flow and reordering in the a-C matrix...|$|R
2500|$|Just {{after the}} first {{measurements}} on the quantum Hall effect in 1980, physicists wondered how the strongly localized electrons in the disordered potential were able to <b>delocalize</b> at their phase transitions. At that time, the field theory of Anderson localization didn't yet include a topological angle and hence it predicted that: [...] "for any given amount of disorder, all states in two dimensions are localized". A result that was irreconcilable with the observations on delocalization. Without knowing {{the solution to this}} problem, physicists resorted to a semi-classical picture of localized electrons that, given a certain energy, were able to percolate through the disorder. [...] This percolation mechanism was what assumed to <b>delocalize</b> the electrons ...|$|R
5|$|Indium is a silvery-white, highly ductile post-transition metal with {{a bright}} luster. It is so soft (Mohs {{hardness}} 1.2) that like sodium, it can be cut with a knife. It also leaves a visible line on paper. It {{is a member of}} group 13 on the periodic table and its properties are mostly intermediate between its vertical neighbours gallium and thallium. Like tin, a high-pitched cry is heard when indium is bent – a crackling sound due to crystal twinning. Like gallium, indium is able to wet glass. Like both, indium has a low melting point, 156.60°C (313.88°F); higher than its lighter homologue, gallium, but lower than its heavier homologue, thallium, and lower than tin. The boiling point is 2072°C (3762°F), higher than that of thallium, but lower than gallium, conversely to the general trend of melting points, but similarly to the trends down the other post-transition metal groups because of the weakness of the metallic bonding with few electrons <b>delocalized.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{melting point}} of iron is {{experimentally}} well defined for pressures less than 50GPa. For greater pressures, studies put the γ-ε-liquid triple point at pressures that differ by tens of gigapascals and 1000K in the melting point. Generally speaking, molecular dynamics computer simulations of iron melting and shock wave experiments suggest higher melting points {{and a much}} steeper slope of the melting curve than static experiments carried out in diamond anvil cells. The melting and boiling points of iron, along with its enthalpy of atomization, are {{lower than those of}} the earlier 3d elements from scandium to chromium, showing the lessened contribution of the 3d electrons to metallic bonding as they are attracted more and more into the inert core by the nucleus; however, they are higher than the values for the previous element manganese because that element has a half-filled 3d subshell and consequently its d-electrons are not easily <b>delocalized.</b> This same trend appears for ruthenium but not osmium.|$|E
5|$|Lawrencium is {{the final}} member of the {{actinide}} series and is sometimes {{considered to be a}} group 3 element, along with scandium, yttrium, and lutetium, as its filled f-shell is expected to make it resemble the 7th-period transition metals. In the periodic table, it is located {{to the right of the}} actinide nobelium, to the left of the 6d transition metal rutherfordium, and under the lanthanide lutetium with which it shares many physical and chemical properties. Lawrencium is expected to be a solid under normal conditions and assume a hexagonal close-packed crystal structure (c/a=1.58), similar to its lighter congener lutetium, though this is not yet known experimentally. The enthalpy of sublimation of lawrencium is estimated to be 352kJ·mol−1, close to the value of lutetium and strongly suggesting that metallic lawrencium is trivalent with the 7s and 6d electrons <b>delocalized,</b> a prediction also supported by a systematic extrapolation of the values of heat of vaporization, bulk modulus, and atomic volume of neighboring elements to lawrencium. Specifically, lawrencium is expected to be a trivalent, silvery metal, easily oxidized by air, steam, and acids, and having an atomic volume similar to that of lutetium and a trivalent metallic radius of 171pm. It is expected to be a rather heavy metal with a density of around 15.6 to 16.6g·cm−3. It is also predicted to have a melting point of around 1900K (1627°C), not far from the value for lutetium (1925K).|$|E
40|$|We discuss {{localized}} {{ground states}} of the periodic Gross-Pitaevskii equation (GPE) {{in the framework of}} a quantum linear Schrodinger equation with effective potential determined in self-consistent manner. We show that depending on the interaction among the atoms being attractive or repulsive, bound {{states of the}} linear self-consistent problem are formed in the forbidden zones of the linear spectrum below or above the energy bands. These bound states correspond to exact solitons of the GPE equation. The implication of these results on <b>delocalizing</b> transitions of multidimensional solitons of the GPE is also discussed. In particular we show that the <b>delocalizing</b> transition corresponds to the threshold for the existence of a single bound state in the effective potential...|$|R

50|$|The π orbitals of an alkene can {{stabilize}} {{a transition}} state {{by helping to}} <b>delocalize</b> the positive charge of the carbocation. For instance the unsaturated tosylate will react more quickly (1011 times faster for aqueous solvolysis) with a nucleophile than the saturated tosylate.|$|R
5|$|The valence {{electrons}} of moscovium fall into three subshells: 7s (two electrons), 7p1/2 (two electrons), and 7p3/2 (one electron). The first {{two of these}} are relativistically stabilized and hence behave as inert pairs, while the last is relativistically destabilized and can easily participate in chemistry. (The 6d electrons are not destabilized enough to participate chemically, although this may still be possible in the two previous elements nihonium and flerovium.) Thus, the +1 oxidation state should be favored, like Tl+, and consistent with this the first ionization potential of moscovium should be around 5.58eV, continuing the trend towards lower ionization potentials down the pnictogens. Moscovium and nihonium both have one electron outside a quasi-closed shell configuration that can be <b>delocalized</b> in the metallic state: thus they should have similar melting and boiling points (both melting around 400°C and boiling around 1100°C) due {{to the strength of}} their metallic bonds being similar. Additionally, the predicted ionization potential, ionic radius (1.5Å for Mc+; 1.0Å for Mc3+), and polarizability of Mc+ are expected to be more similar to Tl+ than its true congener Bi3+. Moscovium should be a dense metal due to its high atomic weight, with a density around 13.5g/cm3. The electron of the hydrogen-like moscovium atom (oxidized so that it only has one electron, Mc114+) is expected to move so fast that it has a mass 1.82 times that of a stationary electron, due to relativistic effects. For comparison, the figures for hydrogen-like bismuth and antimony are expected to be 1.25 and 1.077 respectively.|$|E
25|$|Metallic solids {{are bound}} by a high density of shared, <b>delocalized</b> electrons. Although weakly bound {{molecular}} components are incompatible with strong metallic bonding, low densities of shared, <b>delocalized</b> electrons can impart varying degrees of metallic bonding and conductivity overlaid on discrete, covalently bonded molecular units, especially in reduced-dimensional systems. Examples include charge transfer complexes.|$|E
25|$|The {{electronic}} {{state for}} a trihydrogen cation with an electron <b>delocalized</b> around it is a Rydberg state.|$|E
50|$|Common for {{molecules}} used in {{molecular electronics}} {{is that the}} structures contain many alternating double and single bonds (see also Conjugated system).

50|$|The {{intermediate}} of {{the above}} reaction is the di-anion and the stereoelectronic effect that stabilizes this intermediate over {{the other one is}} the fact that the anionic charge at the para position could <b>delocalize</b> to the oxygen atom via orbital interaction: π(benzene) → σ*(O-CH3).|$|R
25|$|A spherical {{fullerene}} of n carbon atoms has n pi-bonding electrons, free to <b>delocalize.</b> These {{should try}} to <b>delocalize</b> over the whole molecule. The quantum mechanics of such an arrangement should be like one shell only of the well-known quantum mechanical structure of a single atom, with a stable filled shell for n = 2, 8, 18, 32, 50, 72, 98, 128, etc.; i.e. twice a perfect square number; but this series does not include 60. This 2(N+1)2 rule (with N integer) for spherical aromaticity is the three-dimensional analogue of Hückel's rule. The 10+ cation would satisfy this rule, and should be aromatic. This {{has been shown to}} be the case using quantum chemical modelling, which showed the existence of strong diamagnetic sphere currents in the cation.|$|R
25|$|This {{property}} can {{be found}} in quantum dots, certain lanthanides and certain organic molecules with <b>delocalized</b> electrons.|$|E
25|$|The effect always {{competes with}} a {{diamagnetic}} response of opposite sign due {{to all the}} core electrons of the atoms. Stronger forms of magnetism usually require localized rather than itinerant electrons. However, in some cases a band structure can result {{in which there are}} two <b>delocalized</b> sub-bands with states of opposite spins that have different energies. If one subband is preferentially filled over the other, one can have itinerant ferromagnetic order. This situation usually only occurs in relatively narrow (d-)bands, which are poorly <b>delocalized.</b>|$|E
25|$|Salts of the croconate anion and its {{derivatives}} are {{of interest}} in supramolecular chemistry research because of their potential for π-stacking effects, where the <b>delocalized</b> electrons of two stacked croconate anions interact.|$|E
50|$|The Cieplak effect {{relies on}} the {{stabilizing}} interaction of mixing full and empty orbitals to <b>delocalize</b> electrons, known as hyperconjugation. When the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) of one system and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) of another system have comparable energies and spatial overlap, the electrons can <b>delocalize</b> and sink into a lower energy level. Often, the HOMO of a system is a full σ (bonding) orbital and the LUMO is an empty σ* (antibonding) orbital. This mixing is a stabilizing interaction and has been widely used to explain such phenomena as the anomeric effect. A common requirement of hyperconjugation is that the bonds donating and accepting electron density are antiperiplanar to each other, to allow for maximum orbital overlap.|$|R
