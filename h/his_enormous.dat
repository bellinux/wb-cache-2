5|$|In April 1827, the American naturalist {{and bird}} painter John James Audubon came to Britain {{to find a}} {{suitable}} printer for <b>his</b> <b>enormous</b> Birds of America. Bewick, still lively at age 74, showed him the woodcut he was working on, a dog afraid of tree stumps that seem in the dark to be devilish figures, and gave Audubon {{a copy of his}} Quadrupeds for his children.|$|E
5|$|Mendelssohn was a {{fine and}} {{enthusiastic}} artist in pencil and watercolour, a skill which he used throughout his life for his own amusement {{and that of his}} friends. <b>His</b> <b>enormous</b> correspondence shows that he could also be a witty writer in German and English– sometimes accompanied by humorous sketches and cartoons in the text.|$|E
5|$|Their {{painting}} demonstrates, {{more than}} any other figures on the ceiling, Michelangelo's mastery of anatomy and foreshortening and <b>his</b> <b>enormous</b> powers of invention. In their reflection of classical antiquity they resonate with Pope Julius' aspirations to lead Italy towards a new 'age of gold'; at the same time, they staked Michelangelo's claim to greatness. However, a number of critics were angered by their presence and nudity, including Pope Adrian VI who wanted the ceiling stripped.|$|E
60|$|He {{had a huge}} {{head and}} {{wrinkled}} brow--eyebrows that met, squinting eyes, a flat broad nose, and a great gash of a mouth from which two huge tusks stuck out. His skin was hairy, <b>his</b> arms <b>enormous,</b> <b>his</b> legs like sword blades, and his feet as flat as ducks'. In short, {{he was the most}} hideous and laughable object in the world.|$|R
60|$|Miss Haldin's clear {{eyes looked}} {{straight}} at <b>his</b> soft <b>enormous</b> face; I received the impression that behind these dark spectacles of his he could be as impudent as he chose.|$|R
6000|$|... "Ah, Monsieur l'Abbe!" [...] said La Rose, who was {{arranging}} <b>his</b> master's <b>enormous</b> Court periwig, [...] "you are, helas! wrong. Monsieur le Comte {{will not}} be angry at my saying that I wish the accusation were true." ...|$|R
5|$|The banker Charles Rothschild devoted much of {{his time}} to entomology, {{creating}} a large collection of fleas now in the Rothschild Collection at the Natural History Museum, London. He discovered and named the plague vector flea, Xenopsylla cheopis, also known as the oriental rat flea, in 1903. Using what was probably the world's most complete collection of fleas of about 260,000 specimens (representing some 73% of the 2,587 species and subspecies so far described), he described around 500 species and subspecies of Siphonaptera. He was followed in this interest by his daughter Miriam Rothschild, who helped to catalogue <b>his</b> <b>enormous</b> collection of the insects in seven volumes.|$|E
5|$|From 1514 to 1529, Thomas Wolsey (1473–1530), a {{cardinal}} {{of the established}} Church, oversaw {{domestic and foreign policy}} for the young king from his position as Lord Chancellor. Wolsey centralised the national government and extended the jurisdiction of the conciliar courts, particularly the Star Chamber. The Star Chamber's overall structure remained unchanged, but Wolsey used it to provide for much-needed reform of the criminal law. The power of the court itself did not outlive Wolsey, however, since no serious administrative reform was undertaken and its role was eventually devolved to the localities. Wolsey helped fill the gap left by Henry's declining participation in government (particularly in comparison to his father) but did so mostly by imposing himself in the King's place. His use of these courts to pursue personal grievances, and particularly to treat delinquents as if mere examples of a whole class worthy of punishment, angered the rich, who were annoyed as well by <b>his</b> <b>enormous</b> wealth and ostentatious living. Following Wolsey's downfall, Henry took full control of his government, although at court numerous complex factions continued to try to ruin and destroy each other.|$|E
25|$|De Rothschild {{also used}} <b>his</b> <b>enormous</b> wealth for philanthropic works {{and became a}} leader of the French Jewish community. His {{contributions}} to France, along with those of his offspring, can be found in many fields, including medicine and the arts.|$|E

25|$|To some, Carnegie {{represents}} {{the idea of}} the American dream. He was an immigrant from Scotland who came to America and became successful. He is not only known for his successes but <b>his</b> <b>enormous</b> amounts of philanthropist works, not only to charities but also to promote democracy and independence to colonized countries.|$|E
25|$|He had the {{greatest}} military potential of the 14th century with <b>his</b> <b>enormous</b> armies (often over 100,000 men). Meanwhile, Poland's attention was turned eastwards, as the union with Lithuania created an enormous entity in the region. The union, and the conversion of Lithuania, also {{marked the end of}} paganism in Europe.|$|E
25|$|Dian Wei (died 197) was a {{military}} officer serving under the warlord Cao Cao in the late Eastern Han dynasty. Famed for <b>his</b> <b>enormous</b> strength, Dian Wei excelled at wielding a pair of jis (a halberd-like weapon), each of which was said to weigh 40 jin. He was killed in action at the Battle of Wancheng while covering Cao Cao's escape from Zhang Xiu's forces.|$|E
60|$|He {{was not an}} {{especially}} popular man in his district, and he knew it. Physically he was big and stout, with a florid face and small eyes that blinked continually. His head was bald, his hands fat and red and <b>his</b> feet <b>enormous.</b>|$|R
6000|$|But {{the fears}} of both the {{children}} were dispelled {{when they tried to}} get in at the door and were met with the smiling skeleton himself, who said, as he threw the canvas aside as far as if he were admitting <b>his</b> own <b>enormous</b> Lilly: ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Ve is 'appy ov de same," [...] replied Henri, swaggering {{up in the}} joviality of his heart, and {{seizing the}} trader's hand in <b>his</b> own <b>enormous</b> fist. [...] "Shall ve go to york an' slay dem all at vonce, or von at a time?" ...|$|R
25|$|In 1901 he {{published}} a book Physical Culture and Self-Defense (Philadelphia: D. Biddle). In 1902, he and Jeffries had a rematch, once again with the World Heavyweight Champion at stake. Fitzsimmons battered Jeffries, who suffered horrible punishment. With his nose and cheek bones broken, most would have sympathized with Jeffries had he quit, but he kept going until <b>his</b> <b>enormous</b> strength and youth wore down Bob and he knocked him out cold in round eight.|$|E
25|$|In private life, Bezborodko was {{a typical}} Catherinian, corrupt, licentious, conscienceless and self-seeking. But he was {{infinitely}} generous and affectionate, and spent <b>his</b> <b>enormous</b> fortune liberally. His banquets were magnificent, his collections of pictures and statues unique in Europe. He was the best friend of his innumerable poor relatives, and the Maecenas of all the struggling authors of his day. Sycophantic he might have been, but he was neither ungrateful nor vindictive. His patriotism is as indisputable as his genius.|$|E
25|$|Quite {{apart from}} his own achievements, Milstein acted as a guide and {{inspiration}} to many in the antibody field as well as devoting himself to assisting science and scientists in less developed countries. It is also worth mentioning, {{that even though the}} Nobel Prize would have made him a wealthy man, Milstein did not patent <b>his</b> <b>enormous</b> discovery since he believed that it was mankind's intellectual property. According to his beliefs, his work did not have any economic interest, only scientific.|$|E
50|$|Soon {{after he}} casts <b>his</b> spear, <b>enormous</b> twin serpents slither {{out of the}} sea and attack Laocoön's sons. When Laocoön tries to help them, he too is viciously slain. The Trojans assume the horse has been offered at Minerva's (Athena's) {{prompting}} and interpret Laocoön's death as a sign of her displeasure.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, I don't know--I {{guess we}} are all solid here," [...] this gentleman replied, looking round him with a slow, {{deliberate}} smile, which made <b>his</b> mouth <b>enormous,</b> developed two wrinkles, {{as long as the}} wings of a bat, on either side of it, and showed a set of big, even, carnivorous teeth.|$|R
5|$|The {{illustrations}} are, {{according to}} the Preface, made from Wallace's own sketches, photographs, or specimens. Wallace thanks Walter and Henry Woodbury for some photographs of scenery and native people. He acknowledges William Wilson Saunders and Mr Pascoe for horned flies and very rare longhorn beetles: all the rest were from <b>his</b> own <b>enormous</b> collection.|$|R

25|$|Berry {{was granted}} a pension by Parliament, and devoted the {{remainder}} of his life to supporting the cause of Australian Federation. In 1897 he was elected a Victorian delegate to the Constitutional Convention which drafted the Australian Constitution, mainly because of the support of The Age. At 75, however, he was too frail to contribute much except his prestige as one of the country's liberal heroes. He retired to the seaside with <b>his</b> <b>enormous</b> family, and died at St Kilda in 1904. He was given a state funeral and eulogised by Prime Minister Alfred Deakin.|$|E
25|$|Bo Diddley {{was honored}} by the Mississippi Blues Commission with a Mississippi Blues Trail {{historic}} marker placed in McComb, his birthplace, in recognition of <b>his</b> <b>enormous</b> contribution {{to the development of}} the blues in Mississippi. On June 5, 2009, the city of Gainesville, Florida, officially renamed and dedicated its downtown plaza the Bo Diddley Community Plaza. The plaza was the site of a benefit concert at which Bo Diddley performed to raise awareness about the plight of the homeless in Alachua County and to raise money for local charities, including the Red Cross.|$|E

50|$|In {{his last}} decade, Bryant shifted from writing his own poetry to a blank verse {{translation}} of Homer's works. He assiduously {{worked on the}} Iliad and The Odyssey from 1871 to 1874. He is also remembered {{as one of the}} principal authorities on homeopathy and as a hymnist for the Unitarian Church, both legacies of <b>his</b> father's <b>enormous</b> influence on him.|$|R
25|$|In 1919, Strasser and {{his brother}} joined the right-wing Freikorps led by Franz Ritter von Epp. The aim of the group was to {{suppress}} Communism in Bavaria. He established and commanded the Sturmbataillon Niederbayern ("Storm Battalion Lower Bavaria"), with the young Heinrich Himmler employed as his adjutant. Strasser was well known for <b>his</b> <b>enormous</b> stature, commanding personality, and his boundless organizational energy. By March 1920, Strasser's Freikorps was ready {{to participate in the}} failed Kapp Putsch, whereas his brother Otto had turned {{to the left of the}} political spectrum and helped combat this right-wing coup d'état.|$|E
25|$|Taz is {{generally}} {{portrayed as a}} ferocious, albeit dim-witted, omnivore with a notoriously short temper and little patience. Though he can be very devious, he is also sweet at times. <b>His</b> <b>enormous</b> appetite seems to know no bounds, as he will eat anything in his path. He {{is best known for}} his speech consisting mostly of grunts, growls, and rasps (in his earlier appearances, he does speak English with primitive grammar) as well as his ability to spin like a vortex and bite through nearly anything. Taz does have one weakness: he can be calmed by almost any music. While in this calm state, he can be easily dealt with.|$|E
25|$|Hamilton {{originally}} matured {{his ideas}} before putting pen to paper. The discoveries, papers, and treatises previously mentioned {{might well have}} formed the whole work {{of a long and}} laborious life. But not to speak of <b>his</b> <b>enormous</b> collection of books, full to overflowing with new and original matter, which have been handed over to Trinity College, Dublin, the previous mentioned works barely form the greater portion of what Hamilton has published. Hamilton developed the variational principle, which was reformulated later by Carl Gustav Jacob Jacobi. He also introduced the icosian game or Hamilton's puzzle which can be solved using the concept of a Hamiltonian path.|$|E
50|$|An {{important}} {{document of}} him at his best is an Italian language performance of Wagner's Lohengrin from Naples, broadcast on November 20, 1954. The cast includes Renata Tebaldi and is conducted by Gabriele Santini. It is currently on CD on the Hardy label. He was very highly thought of both for his musicianship and <b>his</b> reportedly <b>enormous</b> voice, of magnificent quality.|$|R
60|$|Ray {{was smoking}} <b>his</b> {{customary}} <b>enormous</b> pipe, which he deliberately emptied as Lady Angela and I approached. The {{sight of him}} and the significance of his wounds reduced me {{to a state of}} astonishment which could find no outlet in words. I simply stood and stared at him. Lady Angela, however, after her first exclamation of surprise, went up and greeted him.|$|R
