These cars were assembled by Hurst Performance and featured items such as lightweight Chemcor side glass, fiberglass front fenders, hood scoop, lightweight seats, sound <b>deadener,</b> and other street equipment such as rear seats omitted.

40|$|The noise, {{vibration}} and harshness (NVH) {{performance of}} passenger vehicles strongly {{depends on the}} fluid-structure interaction between {{the air in the}} vehicle cavity and the sheet metal structure of the vehicle. Most of the noise and vibration problems related to this interaction come from resonance peaks of the sheet metal, which are excited by external forces (road, engine, and wind). A reduction in these resonance peaks can be achieved by applying bitumen damping layers, also called <b>deadeners,</b> in the sheet metal. The problem is where these <b>deadeners</b> shall be fixed, which is usually done in a trial-and-error basis. In this work, one proposes the use of embedded sensitivity to locate the <b>deadeners</b> in the sheet metal of the vehicle, more specifically in the vehicle roof. Experimental frequency response functions (FRFs) of the roof are obtained and the data are processed by adopting the embedded sensitivity method, thus obtaining the sensitivity of the resonance peaks on the local increase in damping due to the <b>deadeners.</b> As a result, by examining the sensitivity functions, one can find the optimum location of the <b>deadeners</b> that maximize their effect in reducing the resonance peaks of interest. After locating the <b>deadeners</b> in the optimum positions, it was possible to verify a strong reduction in resonance peaks of the vehicle roof, thus showing the efficiency of the procedure. The main advantage of this procedure is that it only requires FRF measurements of the vehicle in its original state not needing any previous modification of the vehicle structure to find the sensitivity functions.

40|$|Mechanical {{systems can}} present {{undesirable}} resonance peaks in frequency ranges of interest. In {{order to reduce}} these peaks, the engineer has to change the structure, {{but the problem is}} where the changes must be introduced in the structure. Usually, the techniques for solving this problem involve the determination of sensitivity functions. However, considering experimental set-ups, the determination of sensitivity functions depends on a systematic modification of the original structure and respective response measurements, which is a costly and time consuming procedure. In these cases, the embedded sensitivity approach can be very helpful. In this work, one proposes the use of embedded sensitivity to calculate the sensitivity functions, aiming at locating <b>deadeners</b> in the sheet metal of a vehicle roof. After locating the <b>deadeners</b> in the optimum positions, it was possible to verify a strong reduction in resonance peaks of the vehicle roof, thus showing the efficiency of the procedure. The main advantage of this procedure is that it only requires FRF measurements of the vehicle in its original state, not needing any previous modification of the vehicle structure to find the sensitivity functions.

5000|$|The 1993 Cobra R was {{the first}} of three Cobra R models produced, and it was an {{extremely}} exclusive vehicle. As the [...] "R" [...] designation in its name stood for [...] "Race", the car did not have a radio, speakers, wiring and antenna, air conditioner, foglights, sound <b>deadener,</b> rear seat, rear safety belts, rear carpeting, and roll-up cargo cover, among other items. There were no power options; the car had power steering, roll-up windows, manual door locks, and manual-adjustable mirrors. Also, manually-adjustable Opal Gray cloth bucket seats from the Mustang LX were lighter than the GT/Cobra sport seats, and a piece of thin gray carpeting secured by Velcro covered the bare hatch and rear seat area. The deletion of all this equipment shed some 450 pounds, but it was somewhat offset by the necessary addition of heavy-duty hardware to enable the car to handle the rigors of competition.|$|E
50|$|To keep weight low, {{fiberglass}} fenders and hood were used. The hood {{featured a}} functional hood scoop and four hood pins for full lift off {{removal of the}} hood. Lightweight acid dipped steel doors with thin side window glass were used. The doors lacked a window mechanism and to slide the windows, a strap {{was attached to the}} bottom of the glass. To keep glass up, the strap latched to the inside of the door. The interior included only two bucket seats from a Dodge van. Center console, heater, sound <b>deadeners,</b> side view mirrors, radio, carpeting, and even arm rests were deleted to save weight.|$|R
40|$|Employing the 2001 National Household Survey of Drug Abuse, I used cluster {{analysis}} to examine adolescent {{drug use and}} its relationship to three types of criminal and deviant behavior: self-report crime, criminal arrests, and criminal versatility. I compared the cluster substance use groups to traditional substance use measures found throughout the literature. Using Ward 2 ̆ 7 s clustering method, analysis demonstrated that adolescents cluster into five distinct and mutually exclusive groups: abstainers, dabblers, benders, <b>deadeners,</b> and heavyweights. Significant differences were found among the clusters when regressed on age, gender, income subsidies, and race and when used as predictors of the three measures of crime. The substance use clusters method compared favorably to traditional substance use measures, which failed to distinguish among the cluster groups and did not show the distinct non-linear correlation of gender and substance use. ...|$|R

Although scarcely an epistemologist or metaphysician, Vladimir has moments of lucidity in regard to their situation: Vladimir: Was I sleeping, while the others suffered? Am I sleeping now? Tomorrow, when I wake, or think I do, what shall I say of today? That with Estragon my friend, at this place, until the fall of night, I waited for Godot? That Pozzo passed, with his carrier, and that he spoke to us? Probably. But in all that what truth will there be? (Estragon, having struggled with his boots in vain, is dozing off again. Vladimir looks at him.) He’ll know nothing. He’ll tell me about the blows he received and I’ll give him a carrot. (Pause) Astride of a grave and a difficult birth.
