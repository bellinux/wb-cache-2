5|$|Gunfights {{are a major}} {{gameplay}} mechanic in Red Dead Redemption. The {{player can}} take cover, target a specific person or animal, blindfire, and free aim. Individual body parts can also be targeted, {{in order to take}} targets down non-lethally. When the player shoots an enemy, the game engine uniquely creates the AI reactions and movements depending on where they were hit. The player character can choose from period-accurate weapons including revolvers, pistols, lever or bolt-action rifles, shotguns, sniper rifles, knives, explosives, lassos, mounted Gatling guns, and cannons. Duels utilize a gunslinger gameplay mechanic known as <b>Dead</b> <b>Eye.</b> <b>Dead</b> <b>Eye</b> is a targeting system that is used in a bullet time-like manner, allowing the player to slow down time to place a precise shot or paint in multiple shots. When the targeting sequence ends, Marston automatically fires to all marked locations in extremely quick succession.|$|E
5|$|After {{studying}} {{architecture and}} then drama, Cartier {{began his career}} as a screenwriter and then film director in Berlin, working for UFA Studios. After a brief spell in the United States he moved to the United Kingdom in 1935. Initially failing to gain a foothold in the British film industry, he began working for BBC Television in the lae 1930s (among other productions he was involved in the making of Rehearsal for a Drama, BBC 1939). The outbreak of war, however, meant that his contract was terminated; his television play The <b>Dead</b> <b>Eye</b> was stopped in the production stage. After the war, he occasionally worked for British films before he was again hired by the BBC in 1952. He soon became one of the public service broadcaster's leading directors and went on to produce and direct over 120 productions in the next 24 years, ending his television career with the play Loyalties in 1976.|$|E
5|$|Critics {{reported}} that players rarely {{need to use}} Undead Nightmare new weapons. Whitehead (Eurogamer) said that Marston's firearms are mostly indistinguishable apart from the blunderbuss, which is only useful when the player is overrun by zombies. GameSpot added that the game's combat is repetitive and less fun in the expansion, as zombies barely pose a threat. The zombies, without guns, cover, horses, lack the complexities of cowboys and, apart {{from some of the}} special zombie types, are only a threat at short distances. The reviewer found little variation between weapons when firing at close range, which is more effective than aiming at a distance. The fun of the new guns quickly faded for the critic, who found little incentive to use traditional gunfight strategies. Whitehead (Eurogamer) too noted that the base game relied on its use of cover during gunfights, which the expansion jettisons altogether. Thus the player is forced into the technique of backtracking and turning to use the time-slowing <b>Dead</b> <b>Eye</b> mode to clear zombies with headshots. The reviewer also found the controls clumsy and often tripped on piles of zombie bodies or became stuck in doorways. While the idea of zombie animals scared Whitehead, he was both relieved and disappointed to find that bears and cougars, like the humans, died with a single bullet.|$|E

5|$|The {{game was}} envisioned {{to improve the}} core {{mechanics}} of Red Dead Revolver (2004), to which Redemption is a spiritual successor, by scaling {{it up to the}} standard of other Rockstar games. The fundamental goal for the game was to maintain the shooting mechanic and expand on other game features; like Revolver, the game's weapons were inspired by real weaponry. Carson explained that the team attempted to achieve realism with every feature of the game, including the horses, lassos, animal ecosystem, and the open world. To assure that the horse movements were as realistic as possible, the team motion captured a stunt horse, recording all movement. This created various problems; a gesture used by the stunt rider to communicate with the production team while on the horse was also the same command that made the horse rear. Furthermore, creating the horse's skeletal and muscular systems also presented a problem, and took several years to overcome. In the early stages of development, Rockstar decided which elements from Red Dead Revolver could be carried over; beyond the <b>Dead</b> <b>Eye</b> feature and the Western setting, very few other features remained. While Revolver represented many myths and iconic images of the American frontier, in Redemption the team tried to represent the reality of the time period. The tone of Redemption was aimed to be a combination of the primitive Wild West and early 20th century America; with the latter, America was developing into a modern and contemporary society, which the team tried to portray. In addition, while they felt that Revolver was constrained by its level-based structure, the team saw potential in creating a game similar to that of Rockstar's Grand Theft Auto series, in terms of quality, scope and detail.|$|E

25|$|Bill Krohn {{has noted}} that Bass's 48 story board panels for the scene {{introduced}} all the key aspects of the final shower murder scene â€“ most notably, {{the fact that the}} attacker appears as a silhouette, close-ups of a slashing knife, the shower curtain torn down, a shot of the shower head from below, Marion's desperate outstretched arm, and the famous shot of the transition from the drain hole of the bathtub to Marion Crane's <b>dead</b> <b>eye.</b> Krohn notes that this final transition is highly reminiscent of Bass's iris titles for Vertigo. Krohn also concludes that Bass did not literally direct the shower scene, proving Hitchcock's presence on the set throughout the shooting of that scene.|$|E
500|$|In the story, SpongeBuck SquarePants takes a {{train to}} a town named <b>Dead</b> <b>Eye</b> Gulch.

There he meets William Krabs (Mr. Krabs' ancestor), Hopalong Tentacles (Squidward's ancestor, a parody of Hopalong Cassidy) and Polene Puff (Mrs. Puff's ancestor). Later, Pecos Patrick Star (Patrick's ancestor, a parody of Pecos Bill), arrives and warns {{everybody}} that the town's villain, <b>Dead</b> <b>Eye</b> Plankton, will arrive and sing a song called [...] "Dead Eye". <b>Dead</b> <b>Eye</b> Plankton then arrives and challenges SpongeBuck to a duel at high noon. SpongeBuck gets kicked away to a desert, where he meets Pecos Patrick Star. Pecos Patrick tells SpongeBuck that he must smack <b>Dead</b> <b>Eye</b> Plankton several times to defeat him. When they get back into town, SpongeBuck meets <b>Dead</b> <b>Eye</b> Plankton and the two proceed to have a western duel. SpongeBuck then accidentally steps on <b>Dead</b> <b>Eye,</b> defeating him. The next scene shows William Krabs profiting by having the people of <b>Dead</b> <b>Eye</b> Gulch step on <b>Dead</b> <b>Eye</b> Plankton in exchange for one dollar.

500|$|The expansion's zombie {{enemies are}} {{similar to that of}} other games. [...] "Walker" [...] zombies are slow from afar but run when they near the character. Fat zombies attempt to knock the player-character down and others spew green venom. Marston has new weapons, {{including}} holy water, bait for the undead, and a blunderbuss that uses zombie parts as ammunition. The player can use a combination of these skills to defeat hordes of reanimated humans, who stop only once their heads explode. For example, Marston can bait a group to an area to set off a bomb, use the time-slowing <b>Dead</b> <b>Eye</b> mode to shoot each in the head, or eliminate enemies from a roof because zombies cannot climb. Other non-playable characters who contract the infection turn into the undead in real-time and are likely to attack the player.|$|E
500|$|Rockstar found a {{match in}} the Red Dead Redemption {{universe}} for their long-standing aim {{to create a}} zombie game. In lieu of making a new intellectual property for such a game, Rockstar instead wanted players to see how a zombie outbreak affected a world already familiar to them. The company thought that this would make the zombie trope more interesting. Rockstar also saw similar [...] "cinematic heritage" [...] between the Western and zombie horror genres. The team used the analogy of a 1970s film set to explain their ambitionsâ€”that Undead Nightmare in the Red Dead Redemption universe would feel like its characters filming a [...] "serious, revisionist Western" [...] by day and a [...] "somewhat insane horror movie" [...] with the same cast and set by night. Following its experience with Grand Theft Auto IV downloadable content packs, Rockstar wanted its add-on packs to be a separate story with possible overlaps rather than {{a continuation of the}} main story. Rockstar vice president of creative Dan Houser described several reasons for not using the Grand Theft Auto universe for the zombie release: (1) that Red Dead shooting mechanics, including its slow-motion <b>Dead</b> <b>Eye</b> feature, were a better fit for zombie headshots, (2) that zombies were a better fit for the Great Plains landscape, more reminiscent of a 1970s horror film, and (3) that John Marston was a better fit for hunting zombies than the protagonists of Grand Theft Auto games.|$|E

500|$|From the {{beginning}} of development, the sound development team wished to achieve authenticity in the game's sounds. After the art department sent artwork to the sound department, the latter were inspired to achieve realism, researching all sounds that were {{to be used in}} the game. Throughout development, sound editors often presented ideas, which would then be effortlessly achieved by the audio programmers. In the three main areas of the game world, there are unique ambiences; these are broken down into smaller sounds, such as bugs and animals, which are further refined to reflect the weather and time. The sound department was given specific instructions for the tone of game locations; for example, Thieves' Landing was to feel [...] "creepy" [...] and [...] "off-putting". The sounds of the game's weapons were also intricately developed; in order to feel as realistic as possible, each weapon has a variety of similar firing sounds. The development of the game's Foley began with a week-long session, where two Foley artists from Los Angeles were sent to record thousands of sounds relating to the game's setting. The sound department also spent time on specific gameplay elements; <b>Dead</b> <b>Eye</b> was meant to sound [...] "organic" [...] as opposed to [...] "sci-fi or electronic", while animalsâ€”a feature that the team found challengingâ€”was to immerse players in the experience. For the final sound mix, audio director Jeffrey Whitcher and lead sound designer Matthew Smith worked together to balance and blend the three main aspects of the soundtrack: dialogue, sound effects, and music. Smith coded systems to blend the three aspects, in order to keep the mix [...] "dynamic".|$|E
2500|$|Upon {{death or}} removal {{of an eye}} the cornea absorbs the aqueous humor, thickens, and becomes hazy. [...] Transparency can be {{restored}} by putting it in a warm, well-ventilated chamber at 31Â°C (88Â°F, the normal temperature), allowing the fluid to leave the cornea and become transparent. [...] The cornea takes in fluid from the aqueous humor and the small blood vessels of the limbus, but a pump ejects the fluid immediately upon entry. [...] When energy is deficient the pump may fail, or works too slowly to compensate, causing swelling. This could arise at death, but a <b>dead</b> <b>eye</b> can {{be placed in a}} warm chamber and the reservoirs of sugar and glycogen can keep the cornea transparent for at least 24 hours. [...] The endothelium controls this pumping action, and as discussed above, damage thereof is more serious, and is a cause of opaqueness and swelling. [...] When damage to the cornea occurs, such as in a viral infection, the collagen used to repair the process is not regularly arranged, leading to an opaque patch (leukoma). [...] When a cornea is needed for transplant, as from an eye bank, the best procedure is to remove the cornea from the eyeball, preventing the cornea from absorbing the aqueous humor.|$|E
