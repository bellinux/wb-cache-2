The return was due largely to the post-Stalin era warming in international relations. A renewed interest in scientific and cultural exchanges was spearheaded by Nikita Khrushchev and President Eisenhower, who had encouraged people-to-people contacts {{in his efforts to}} “wage peace.” The initial official exchanges were in the sciences and the arts.

40|$|Based on an ethnographic {{study of}} the {{interaction}} of two groups of management academics and practitioners in an executive master’s program, the research articulates a process perspective on how academics and practitioners <b>exchange</b> <b>expert</b> knowledge across boundaries. Findings suggest that academics and practitioners can resourcefully deal with knowledge exchanges that are pervaded by relational insecurity, thanks {{to a set of}} relational strategies that are used sequentially, according to trial and error logics. The four strategies that we identified connect, albeit to different extents, what goes on inside the classroom (in situ) with what goes on outside the classroom, in academics’ and practitioners’ day-to-day relations (ex-situ). We show that each strategy led to a different type of knowledge exchange and that the first two strategies –that were intentional- had less impact on new knowledge creation than the two strategies that emerged spontaneously from interaction. Our findings challenge orthodox understandings about the existence of a management theory - managerial practice gap and points out the importance of seeing theoretical and managerial expertise in practice as socially entangled rather than community-specific. We also show that business schools {{play an important role in}} facilitating academic-practitioner boundary work. By triggering insecurities, conflicts and reparatory negotiation processes, business schools settings allow for repeated contaminations between knowledge deriving from theorizing and practising...|$|E

In 1986 he secured the signature of a scientific and technical partnership between the laboratory of the French Museums Service (Direction des Musées de France) and the PTS. During this period the French Scientific Police became aware of the value of <b>exchanging</b> <b>expert</b> knowledge with the largest French research laboratories, major universities, Écoles and foreign crime-detection laboratories, including the BKA. Among the fields that required analysis and involvement {{on the part of the}} scientific police: forged documents and counterfeit currency, as well as authentication of terrorist tracts and anonymous letters.

40|$|This article {{discusses}} xenotransplantation (XTP: {{the surgical}} use of nonhuman tissues, organs, and cells for human transplantation) and examines {{the way its}} scientific promot-ers have defended their technology against potentially damaging public representations. The authors explore the criteria used to legitimate {{the selection of the}} pig as the best spe-cies from which to “harvest ” transplant tissues in the future. The authors ’ analysis shows that scientists and medical practitioners routinely switch between scientific and cultural repertoires.

These discourses map onto similarities and differences between animal donors and human hosts. Finally, the case is used to comment on a number of related approaches where the dynamics of medi-cal and scientific authority are discussed. Xenotransplantation (XTP) promises the routine transfer of organs and tissues from animals into humans. But it has yet to find a firm footing in the wider clinical economies of established organ replacement. This objective has been made all the more difficult for promoters of the technology since conventional transplantation itself {{has been the subject of}} considerable criti-cism and widespread skepticism in both popular and specialist discourse (Fox and Swazey 1992; Calnan and Williams 1992; Snowdon 1991). The prospect of extending the “donor pool ” to transgenic animals has engendered acrimonious debate and is likely to exacerbate such problems by increasing medical dependence on animal bodies, already a source of deep controvers...|$|E
40|$|Current {{radical changes}} in the Police service internationally and in England and Wales are being driven by {{movements}} to adopt an Evidence-Based Practice (EBP) approach to policing. However this poses a challenge as early adopters have experienced resistance to EBP, a relatively unknown, and more importantly misunderstood approach for policing (Sherman, 2015). This resistance {{is not limited to}} police with international research highlighting implementation issues for evidence based medicine (Altman, 1996; Fairhurst & Dowrick, 1996; Murphy and Adams, 2005), evidence based management (Adams & Sasse, 1999; Rousseau, 2012), and evidence based teaching (Beista, 2007, Perry & Smart, 2007; Adams & Clough, 2015). One reason is the lack of training in EBP, which is coupled with recent concerns over the general quality of training and level of professionalism within UK police organisation (Davies et al, 1996). There have been international initiatives aimed at increasing learning around evidence based practice (Rousseau, 2012; Hall and Roussel, 2014). Some UK police forces have adopted approaches from other domains to counteract these problems (e. g. champions, enquiry visits). Mapping clear pathways that link training, experience and evidence-based practice is crucial to developing the capacity for an evidence-based workforce. This paper presents evidence from recent research that used evidence cafes and practitioner cafes connected to online resources as a route to increase understanding and awareness of evidence based practice amongst frontline police officers. Evidence cafes are coordinated by a knowledge <b>exchange</b> <b>expert</b> with an academic and a police practitioner who facilitate the translation of research into practice. This paper presents evidence of the benefit and limitations of these events. Analytics and learning analytics of events’ online resources also provide insights into these approaches and identify triggers for increased engagement across a wide geographical context...|$|E
