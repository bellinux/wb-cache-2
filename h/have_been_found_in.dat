5|$|Features {{necessary}} for defending a territory {{such as the}} horns and broad-based skull of the modern black wildebeest, <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>found</b> <b>in</b> their fossil ancestors. The earliest known fossil remains are in sedimentary rock in Cornelia in the Orange Free State and date back about eight hundred thousand years. Fossils have also been reported from the Vaal River deposits, though {{it is unclear whether}} or not they are as ancient as those found in Cornelia. Horns of the black wildebeest <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>found</b> <b>in</b> sand dunes near Hermanus in South Africa. This is far beyond the recorded range of the species and it has been suggested that these animals may have migrated to that region from the Karoo.|$|E
5|$|Few dinosaur remains <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>found</b> <b>in</b> Scandinavia. The {{mainland}} {{of western}} Denmark is an unlikely region to find dinosaur remains, since the Mesozoic sediments there are marine Maastrichtian chalk. Fossils of non-dinosaurian marine animals, including mosasaurs and plesiosaurs, <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>found</b> <b>in</b> these deposits. Mesozoic deposits in Scania, Sweden, are much richer in fossils, {{including those of}} dinosaurs. The Danish island of Bornholm in the Baltic Sea {{was part of the}} same land mass as Scania (the Scandinavian-Russian continent), and has a similar geology. The southwestern part of the island is the only place in Denmark which has yielded dinosaur remains.|$|E

Fossils from France show that the Sylvia genus dates back at least 20million years.|$|E
5|$|Fossils from {{terrestrial}} dinosaurs also <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>found</b> <b>in</b> the Niobrara Chalk, {{suggesting that}} animals {{who died on}} shore must have been washed out to sea (one specimen of a hadrosaur {{appears to have been}} scavenged by a shark).|$|E

5|$|Many coins <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>found</b> <b>in</b> {{northern}} Ethiopia and Eritrea, {{the central}} region of Aksum, though Aksumite coins {{are reported to}} <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>found</b> <b>in</b> Arato and Lalibela. Many coins have been also found further afield. Numerous hoards of coins (always gold save one silver coin) <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>found</b> <b>in</b> Southern Arabia, much more than in Aksum itself, attesting perhaps to an Aksumite presence {{in parts of the}} region (perhaps supporting the use of titles claiming control over parts of South Arabia from GDRT's time). The hoards may be the remnants of hoards left in Kaleb's time (perhaps used to pay soldiers), when it was under an Aksumite governor. Outside of the Horn of Africa and Arabian Peninsula, coins have been found as far as Israel, Meroe, Egypt, and India. Silver and copper coins are mainly found in Aksum, though some can be traced to Palestinian pilgrim centers.|$|E
