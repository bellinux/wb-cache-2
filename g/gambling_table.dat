25|$|The UK {{endured a}} notably long, cold winter in 1962–63. This may have {{increased}} demand for winter cruises. In December 1963 Crockfords of Mayfair installed a <b>gambling</b> <b>table</b> on Andes. It {{was used for the}} first time on the 1963–64 Christmas and New Year cruise. Her 1964 Winter Cruise covered 20,570 miles and included visits to Madras, Bombay and the Far East.|$|E
500|$|Whilst {{composing}} his letter, Bond {{encounters a}} beautiful, suicidal {{young woman named}} Contessa Teresa [...] "Tracy" [...] di Vicenzo first {{on the road and}} subsequently at the <b>gambling</b> <b>table,</b> where he saves her from a coup de deshonneur by paying the gambling debt she is unable to cover. The following day Bond follows her and interrupts her attempted suicide, but they are captured by professional henchmen. They are taken to the offices of Marc-Ange Draco, head of the Unione Corse, the biggest European crime syndicate. Tracy is the daughter and only child of Draco who believes the only way to save his daughter from further suicide attempts is for Bond to marry her. To facilitate this, he offers Bond a dowry of £1 million (£ million in [...] pounds); Bond refuses the offer, but agrees to continue romancing Tracy while her mental health improves.|$|E

5000|$|Acting upon Acting Governor Murphy's recommendation, {{the session}} decided {{to publish the}} [...] "lost laws" [...] from the {{previous}} session. They then eliminated the territorial offices of Commissioner of Immigration and Territorial Geologist. A new tax of US$30/month was imposed upon <b>gambling</b> <b>tables.</b> Additionally <b>gambling</b> <b>tables</b> were banned from any fair ground, fiesta, park, or race track. The ban had {{the added benefit of}} effectively fulfilling Murphy's request to halt the territory's fiestas. The legislature also established the secret ballot during territorial elections.|$|R

500|$|Animals {{are shown}} {{punishing}} humans, subjecting them to nightmarish torments that may symbolise the seven deadly sins, matching the torment to the sin. Sitting on {{an object that}} may be a toilet or a throne, the panel's centerpiece is a gigantic bird-headed monster feasting on human corpses, which he excretes through a cavity below him, into the transparent chamber pot on which he sits. The monster is sometimes referred to as the [...] "Prince of Hell", a name derived from the cauldron he wears on his head, perhaps representing a debased crown. To his feet a female has her face reflected on the buttocks of a demon. Further to the left, next to a hare-headed demon, a group of naked persons around a toppled <b>gambling</b> <b>table</b> are being massacred with swords and knives. Other brutal violence is shown by a knight torn down and eaten up by a pack of wolves {{to the right of the}} tree-man.|$|E
2500|$|In Sweden, {{the salon}} {{developed}} during the late 17th century and flourished until the late 19th century. During the 1680s and 1690s, the salon of countess Magdalena Stenbock became a meeting where foreign ambassadors in Stockholm came to make contacts, and her <b>gambling</b> <b>table</b> {{was described as a}} center of Swedish foreign policy.|$|E
2500|$|A {{stopping}} time {{with respect to}} a sequence of random variables X1,X2,X3,... is a random variable τ with the property that for each t, the occurrence or non-occurrence of the event τ = t depends only on the values of X1,X2,X3,...,Xt. The intuition behind the definition is that at any particular time t, {{you can look at the}} sequence so far and tell if it is time to stop. [...] An example in real life might be the time at which a gambler leaves the <b>gambling</b> <b>table,</b> which might be a function of his previous winnings (for example, he might leave only when he goes broke), but he can't choose to go or stay based on the outcome of games that haven't been played yet.|$|E

60|$|This was {{the last}} blow to Hale's ideal crusade. Here he was--an honest, respectable citizen--engaged as simple {{accessory}} to a lawless vendetta originating at a <b>gambling</b> <b>table!</b> When the first shock was over that grim philosophy which is the reaction of all imaginative and sensitive natures came to his aid. He felt better; oddly enough he began to be conscious that he was thinking and acting like his companions. With this feeling a vague sympathy, before absent, faintly showed itself in their actions.

6000|$|... 240. And {{there are}} simply no words for the mixed absurdity and wickedness of the present popular demand for art, as shown by its supply in our thoroughfares. Abroad, in the shops of the Rue de Rivoli, {{brightest}} and most central of Parisian streets, the putrescent remnant {{of what was once}} Catholicism promotes its poor gilded pedlars' ware of nativity and crucifixion into such honorable corners as it can find among the more costly and studious illuminations of the brothel: and although, in Pall Mall, and the Strand, the large-margined Landseer,--Stanfield,--or Turner-proofs, in a few stately windows, still represent, uncared-for by the people, or inaccessible to them, the power of an English school now wholly perished,--these are too surely superseded, in the windows that stop the crowd, by the thrilling attraction with which Doré, Gérome, and Tadema have invested the <b>gambling</b> <b>table,</b> the dueling ground, and the arena; or by the more material and almost tangible truth with which the apothecary-artist stereographs the stripped actress, and the railway mound.|$|E

Whither, it is needless to say--to Hamburg perhaps, or to Ems, or the richer tables of Homburg. How he flourished for a while with ambiguous success; how he talked to the young English tourists of what he had done when in Parliament, especially for the rights of married women; how he poked his 'Honourable' card in every one's way, and lugged Lord Gaberlunzie into all conversations; how his face became pimply and his wardrobe seedy; and how at last his wretched life will ooze out from him in some dark corner, like the filthy juice of a decayed fungus which makes hideous the hidden wall on which it bursts, all this is unnecessary more particularly to describe. He is probably still living, and those who desire his acquaintance will find him creeping round some <b>gambling</b> <b>table,</b> and trying to look as though he had in his pocket ample means to secure those hoards of money which men are so listlessly raking about. From our view he has now vanished.|$|E

60|$|Back at the farm-house, Daylight mounted {{and rode}} on {{away from the}} ranch and into the wilder canons and steeper steeps beyond. Nothing could satisfy his holiday spirit now but the ascent of Sonoma Mountain. And here on the crest, three hours afterward, he emerged, tired and sweaty, {{garments}} torn and face and hands scratched, but with sparkling eyes and an unwonted zestfulness of expression. He felt the illicit pleasure of a schoolboy playing truant. The big <b>gambling</b> <b>table</b> of San Francisco seemed very far away. But {{there was more than}} illicit pleasure in his mood. It was as though he were going through a sort of cleansing bath. No room here for all the sordidness, meanness, and viciousness that filled the dirty pool of city existence. Without pondering in detail upon the matter at all, his sensations were of purification and uplift. Had he been asked to state how he felt, he would merely have said that he was having a good time; for he was unaware in his self-consciousness of the potent charm of nature that was percolating through his city-rotted body and brain--potent, in that he came of an abysmal past of wilderness dwellers, while he was himself coated with but the thinnest rind of crowded civilization.|$|E
60|$|Early in October Fred went to Limerick, {{and from}} thence with a {{detached}} troop of his regiment {{he was sent}} to the cavalry barracks at Ennis, the assize town of the neighbouring County Clare. This was at first held to be a misfortune by him, as Limerick is in all respects a better town than Ennis, and in County Limerick the hunting is far from being bad, whereas Clare is hardly a country for a Nimrod. But a young man, with money at command, need not regard distances; and the Limerick balls and the Limerick coverts were found to be equally within reach. From Ennis also he could attend some of the Galway meets,--and then with no other superior than a captain hardly older than himself to interfere with his movements, he could indulge in that wild district the spirit of adventure which was strong within him. When young men are anxious to indulge the spirit of adventure, they generally do so by falling in love with young women of whom their fathers and mothers would not approve. In these days a spirit of adventure hardly goes further than this, unless it take a young man to a German <b>gambling</b> <b>table.</b>|$|E
60|$|It was Sunday night; but not {{the less}} were the gamblers {{assembled}} in the card-room at about eleven. Dolly Longestaffe was there, and with him the two lords, and Sir Felix, and Miles Grendall of course, and, I regret to say, a much better man than any of them, Paul Montague. Sir Felix had doubted much as to the propriety of joining the party. What {{was the use of}} playing with a man who seemed by general consent to be liberated from any obligation to pay? But then if he did not play with him, where should he find another <b>gambling</b> <b>table?</b> They began with whist, but soon laid that aside and devoted themselves to loo. The least respected man in that confraternity was Grendall, and yet it was in compliance with the persistency of his suggestion that they gave up the nobler game. 'Let's stick to whist; I like cutting out,' said Grasslough. 'It's much more jolly having nothing to do now and then; one can always bet,' said Dolly shortly afterwards. 'I hate loo,' said Sir Felix in answer to a third application. 'I like whist best,' said Nidderdale, 'but I'll play anything anybody likes,--pitch and toss if you please.' But Miles Grendall had his way, and loo was the game.|$|E
