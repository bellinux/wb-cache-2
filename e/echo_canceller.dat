50|$|Rapid {{advances}} {{in the implementation of}} digital signal processing allowed <b>echo</b> <b>cancellers</b> to be made smaller and more cost-effective. In the 1990s, <b>echo</b> <b>cancellers</b> were implemented within voice switches for the first time (in the Northern Telecom DMS-250) rather than as standalone devices. The integration of echo cancellation directly into the switch meant that <b>echo</b> <b>cancellers</b> could be reliably turned on or off on a call-by-call basis, removing the need for separate trunk groups for voice and data calls. Today's telephony technology often employs <b>echo</b> <b>cancellers</b> in small or handheld communications devices via a software voice engine, which provides cancellation of either acoustic echo or the residual echo introduced by a far-end PSTN gateway system; such systems typically cancel echo reflections with up to 64 milliseconds delay.|$|R
40|$|This paper aims at double-talk {{detection}} for acoustic <b>echo</b> <b>cancellers</b> enabling {{transmission of}} speech signals in stereo. Double-talk detectors {{are affected by}} the same known non-uniqueness problem as <b>echo</b> <b>cancellers.</b> However, <b>echo</b> <b>cancellers</b> are usually adapted using NLMS-like iterative algorithms. Double-talk detectors being based on pseudo-coherence employ traditional spectral estimation techniques, which involve the use of temporal windows. These windows cause a bias of the coherence between the loudspeaker channels: this bias causes the magnitude squared coherence to be smaller than one. Therefore, the non-uniqueness problem known for <b>echo</b> <b>cancellers</b> does not exist for the mentioned type of double-talk detectors. However, the correlation between the loudspeaker channels provoke a strong bias of the inherent estimation of the echo paths. Consequently, we propose a method to decrease the influence of inter-channel correlations on the reliability of the double-talk detector. 1...|$|R

50|$|The {{concept of}} an <b>echo</b> <b>canceller</b> is to {{synthesize}} {{an estimate of the}} echo from the talker's signal, and subtract that synthesis from the return path instead of switching attenuation into/out of the path. This technique requires adaptive signal processing to generate a signal accurate enough to effectively cancel the echo, where the echo can differ from the original due to various kinds of degradation along the way.|$|E

40|$|In this contribution, we {{introduce}} a novel framework for combining approaches for acoustic echo cancellation and beamforming. Classical schemes of combination incorporate the simple concatenation of both subsystems. However, if the <b>echo</b> <b>cancellers</b> come first, they cannot exploit the noise reduction {{capabilities of the}} beamformer. In the other setup, a time-variant beamformer can heavily disturb the succeeding <b>echo</b> <b>canceller’s</b> convergence. The new approach establishes a possibility to smoothly switch between two possible target functions: the mean squared errors at the beamformer’s inputs and its output, respectively. Thus, one combined system benefits from advantages of both classical schemes. The paper contains a theoretical analysis of possible solutions for preceding <b>echo</b> <b>cancellers,</b> which are adapted using the beamformer output. The appropriate modification of the normalized least mean squares algorithm is derivated, too. 1...|$|R

The function of H, the hybrid transformer, is to route incoming speech {{from the far}} end xk to the local telephone and route speech from the telephone to the far end. However, the hybrid is never perfect, so its output dk contains both the desired speech from the local telephone plus filtered speech from the far end. The <b>echo</b> <b>canceller</b> is the adaptive filter fk, which attempts to minimize the error signal εk by filtering the incoming far end speech into a replica yk of the far end speech that leaks through the hybrid. Once the adaption is complete, the error signal consists mostly of speech from the local telephone.|$|E
50|$|The primary {{challenge}} for an <b>echo</b> <b>canceller</b> is determining {{the nature of}} the filtering to be applied to the far-end signal such that it resembles the resultant near-end signal. The filter is essentially a model of speaker, microphone and the room's acoustical attributes. Echo cancellers must be adaptive because the characteristics of the near-end's speaker and microphone are generally not known in advance. The acoustical attributes of the near-end's room are also not generally known in advance, and may change (e.g., if the microphone is moved relative to the speaker, or if individuals walk around the room causing changes in the acoustic reflections). By using the far-end signal as the stimulus, modern systems use an adaptive filter and can 'converge' from nothing to 55 dB of cancellation in around 200 ms.|$|E
5000|$|These {{methods are}} {{commonly}} called acoustic echo suppression (AES) and acoustic echo cancellation (AEC), and more rarely line echo cancellation (LEC). In some cases, these terms are more precise, {{as there are}} various types and causes of echo with unique characteristics, including acoustic echo (sounds from a loudspeaker being reflected and recorded by a microphone, which can vary substantially over time) and line echo (electrical impulses caused by, e.g., coupling between the sending and receiving wires, impedance mismatches, electrical reflections, etc., which varies much less than acoustic echo). In practice, however, the same techniques are used to treat all types of echo, so an acoustic <b>echo</b> <b>canceller</b> can cancel line echo as well as acoustic echo.

50|$|Tellabs traces {{its roots}} {{to a meeting}} in 1975 over a kitchen table in {{suburban}} Chicago. According to company founder Michael Birck, a group of six men with backgrounds in electrical engineering and sales drank coffee and brainstormed ideas for a new telecom company. They aimed to build a company that offered customers products and services that met their specific needs. After raising $110,000 in capital, they incorporated as Tellabs {{in the spring of}} 1975; the name combined the idea of telephones and laboratories. The start-up only had a one-man research department, a second-hand soldering iron picked up for $25, and an outdated oscilloscope. In a matter of months, Tellabs began making echo suppressors, which suppress annoying echoes on phone calls. During this time, the founding partners drew no salaries. The company went public in July 1980, ending the year with sales of $43.7 million. In September 1981, Tellabs introduced the industry's first <b>echo</b> <b>canceller,</b> an advance over the original echo suppressors that synthesized an echo and electronically subtracted it. By 1990, Tellabs had grown to 2,000 employees at 25 locations globally and sales of $211 million.|$|E
40|$|Typical sparse echo cancellers employ {{adaptive}} filtering algorithms that, update {{only a small}} number of filter coefficients that, produce the actual echo. Usually, these algorithms provide increased convergence speed at the cost of an increase in computational complexity for locating these significant filter coefficients. Recently, a coupled <b>echo</b> <b>canceller</b> was proposed that uses two short adaptive filters in tandem. The first adaptive filter operates in the partial Haar domain and is solely used to estimate the location of the channel's dispersive region. A short time-domain filter is then centred around this estimate to cancel echo. Using two short filters instead of one long filter not only reduces computational complexity, while substantially increasing the convergence speed of the <b>echo</b> <b>canceller.</b> The focus of this thesis is twofold. First, it analyzes the partial Haar <b>echo</b> <b>canceller</b> and attempts to clarify some issues with its implementation.
