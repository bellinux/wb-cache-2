There are also needles, rings, razors, decorative discs, fragments of wrought lead, pieces of swords, lance points and arrowheads.

50|$|Mechanical <b>deburring</b> is a <b>deburring</b> {{process that}} either {{mechanically}} grinds a burr off of metal or rolls {{the edge of}} dangerous slit or sheared metal burrs into itself.

50|$|Cryogenic {{deburring}} is a {{cryogenic process}} used to remove burrs and flash from plastic and die cast workpieces. The process works by tumbling and/or abrasively blasting the workpieces at cryogenic temperature levels. The low temperatures (approximately -195 C) are achieved using liquid nitrogen, liquid carbon dioxide, or dry ice. This low temperature brings the material below its embrittlement temperature, which causes the flash or burrs {{to be easily}} removed via tumbling or media blasting. This process {{has been around since}} the 1960s to deflash plastic and rubber. Common materials that are typically cryogenically <b>deburred</b> with blast media include PEEK, nylon, Teflon, Delrin, polypropylene, polycarbonate, acetal, PTFE, PET, HDPE, PVC, ABS and many others.|$|E
5000|$|Because {{they operate}} at low {{pressure}} {{and rely on}} gravity to move fluids (and entrained solids), drain-waste-vent systems use fittings whose interior surfaces are as smooth as possible. The fittings may be [...] "belled" [...] (expanded slightly in diameter) or otherwise shaped to accommodate the insertion of pipe or tubing without forming a sharp interior ridge that might catch debris or accumulate material, and cause a clog or blockage. Freshly cut ends of pipe segments are carefully <b>deburred</b> to remove projecting slivers of material which may snag debris (such as hair or fibers) which can build up to cause blockages.

40|$|Although <b>deburring</b> {{technology}} {{is used in}} precision manufacturing and high-quality machining, <b>deburring</b> is still considered a difficult problem. Precision parts require care to achieve precise dimensions and surface quality and in subsequent finishing operations. <b>Deburring</b> and edge finishing typically receive little attention from designers and manufacturing engineers. Due to <b>deburring</b> difficulties, it can {{account for more than}} 30 % of the total production cost when components are small. Efficient and effective <b>deburring</b> of miniature and/or precision components is very difficult. Therefore, this work applies a highly efficient and fully automatic novel electrochemical system that uses a rotating barrel. The effects of the main factors, such as barrel rotational speed, electrical current density, electrolyte temperature and process time, are investigated. Finally, optimal conditions are identified by applying the design of experiment to the required edge quality. The burrs on brass gears are dissolved and removed properly and the radius of the fillet of the gears after <b>deburring</b> has a small standard deviation of 5. 9 μm within only 5 minutes when using the proposed system of a rotational barrel with electrochemical <b>deburring.</b> This electrochemical system is an effective and efficient system to remove burrs from miniature metal parts...|$|R
25|$|<b>Deburring</b> and finishing: These {{compounds}} {{are mainly}} designed {{to suspend the}} small particles created when <b>deburring</b> and abrading parts. They {{are also designed to}} keep workpieces clean and inhibit corrosion.|$|R
50|$|However, {{the same}} {{properties}} {{that make it}} a good solvent for oils also make it a good solvent of undesired things left behind during the manufacturing of a unit. Some of which are: dust, dirt, residue from soldering, small bits of metal from cutting, and oxidized metal from the tubing. The residues collected can clog the system filters and cause excessive wear or damage to critical components such as the vanes or valves. This aspect makes it more important to check that components are machined properly, <b>deburred,</b> and cleaned. Another problem with these oils {{is that they are}} hygroscopic in nature, which means they can absorb moisture from the atmosphere. Hence, technicians working with units that have to be opened, should leave the unit open for as little time as required.|$|E
50|$|Remedial {{measures}} for impingement attack include {{modifications to the}} system to reduce the average water velocity, e.g. by using larger diameter tubes or, if appropriate, to lower the pump speed, and/or to redesign {{the part of the}} installation concerned to eliminate the cause of local turbulence, e.g. by using slow or swept bends and tee fittings rather than elbows and square tees. It is important to minimise the possibility of any local turbulence occurring by ensuring that the ends of tubes cut with a tube cutter are <b>deburred</b> and that the tubes are inserted fully to the stops in the fitting before the joints are made, as referred to earlier in this section. In some cases, where the above approaches are not possible, the length of copper tube affected can sometimes be replaced by materials more resistant to corrosion-erosion, e.g. 90/10 copper-nickel (BS Designation CN102) using appropriate fittings, or stainless steel to BS 4127:1994.|$|E
50|$|It {{is unusual}} for the general water {{velocity}} in a system to be so high that impingement attack occurs throughout {{the whole of the}} copper pipework. More commonly, the velocity is just sufficiently low for satisfactory protective films to be formed and to remain in position on most of the system, with impingement damage more likely to occur where there is an abrupt change in the direction of water flow giving rise to a high degree of turbulence, such as at tee pieces and elbow fittings. It is not generally realised how great an effect small obstructions can have on the flow pattern of water in a pipe-work system {{and the extent to which}} they can induce turbulence and cause corrosion-erosion. For example, it is most important, as far as possible, to ensure that copper tubes cut with a tube cutter are <b>deburred</b> before making the joint. Also a gap between the tube end and the stop in the fitting, due to the tube not having been cut to the correct length and fully inserted into the socket of the fitting, can also induce turbulence in the water stream.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Remained burrs on {{edges of}} the parts after metal cutting {{operations}} may cause many problems in the production process and {{in the quality of}} products, therefore the burrs must be completely removed.

The authors have carried out many investigations regarding the magnetic abrasive <b>deburring</b> of small, blanked sheet metal parts, furthermore the machine <b>deburring</b> of large-sized metal workpieces by carbide-reinforced cylindrical brushes.

In addition to the extent of the edge radius generated, the variation in the diameters at the entry and exit side of the specimen were also investigated. The extent of the edge radius generated was affected significantly by the parameter stand-off-distance and the variations in the diameters were affected by the nozzle diameter.

40|$|Abstract. In {{sheet metal}} {{processes}} the burrs cannot be completely eliminated {{during the process}} but can be minimized by optimization of the process parameters. Hence the <b>deburring</b> often becomes an essential secondary operation. Most of the <b>deburring</b> operations are hand-made and therefore several manufacturers tend to eliminate these tedious and labor-intensive operations due to time and cost issues. Moreover, clamping problems can arise which, together with the <b>deburring</b> forces, can induce dimension alterations and local deformations, particularly for thin sheets. Barrel finishing is an old technique commonly used to improve the surface roughness of complicated parts, but can find interesting applications also in the <b>deburring.</b> Aim of this work is to present an experimental investigation on the <b>deburring</b> of sheet metal performed by barreling. A technological model has been developed {{in order to assess}} the height of the burr {{as a function of the}} initial burr and of the working time...|$|R
25|$|Compounds {{are added}} to mass {{finishing}} processes to assist in <b>deburring,</b> burnishing, cutting, cleaning, descaling, and inhibiting corrosion. They may be liquids or dry powders.

40|$|Some {{aspects of}} {{automatic}} <b>deburring</b> by a robot are considered.

However, in practice, a robot may be in free unconstrained motion before it comes {{in contact with the}} environment. In order to control the <b>deburring</b> operation without switching controllers for the unconstrained and constrained motions respectively, an additional controller is proposed, and a control strategy is used so that these three controllers for the robot are automatically switched. This ensures that the robot is stable during the whole process of <b>deburring.</b> A numerical example of a <b>deburring</b> process with a two degrees-of-freedom robot is presented for illustration...|$|R
40|$|In the Cleaning and Deburring Workstation, two robots {{cooperate}} {{to accomplish}} deburring, buffing, cleaning, and handling of machined metal parts. A technique {{has been developed}} which uses part geometry data to generate robot paths automatically. Using a graphics interface, an operator specifies how a part is to be gripped, fixtured, <b>deburred,</b> buffed, and cleaned.

40|$|AbstractSelective Laser Deburring (SLD) is an {{innovative}} edge-refinement process being {{developed at the}} Laser Zentrum Nord (LZN) in Hamburg. It offers a wear-free processing of defined radii and bevels at the edges {{as well as the}} possibility to deburr several materials with the same laser source. Sheet metal parts of various applications need to be post-processed to remove sharp edges and burrs remaining from the initial production process. Thus, SLD will provide an extended degree of automation {{for the next generation of}} manufacturing facilities. This paper investigates the dependence between the deburring result and the temperature field in- and post-process. In order to achieve this, the surface temperature near to the <b>deburred</b> edge is monitored with IR-thermography.

40|$|This work {{describes}} a control method for the stable accommodation of contact forces! when the robot {{interacts with the}} environment. In robotic deburring, for example, the robot endpoint is constrained by the the part to be <b>deburred</b> (7, 8). After defming unstructured models (input-output relationships) for both the robotic and environment subsystems, we combine them to obtain a general, nonlinear stability condition for the total system. This prescribes a finite sensitivity (a mapping from forces to displacements) for the robot and the environment. It also states that decreasing the sensitivity of either subsystem reduces the stability range; as both subsystems approach zero sensitivity, stability cannot be guaranteed. We then focus on the robot's rigid body dynamics and an infinitely stiff environment (structured models) to obtain a specific stability condition {{in terms of the}} Jacobian and the robot's tracking controller. This condition has been verified via simulation of and experimentation with the Minnesota direct drive robot. 1...|$|E
40|$|Burrs {{have been}} defined as {{undesirable}} projections of material beyond {{the edge of a}} workpiece during machining. Burrs are created around the edge of workpiece due to plasticity during mechanical manufacturing process. Recently, because of miniaturization and increased precision of the machined parts, the size of burrs has been also reduced and <b>deburring</b> became even more difficult. Generally, burrs have been removed by method of physics and chemistry. There are a few publications in the area of applying ultrasonics to <b>deburring.</b> When ultrasonic vibration propagates in the liquid medium, a large number of bubbles are formed. These bubbles generate an extremely strong force, which removes burrs. The object {{of this study is to}} analyze the effects of ultrasonic vibration, medium and the type of abrasive in <b>deburring</b> process. In this paper, we have examined such parameters of ultrasonic vibration as power, the distance between the ultrasonic horn and workpiece, <b>deburring</b> elapsed time, and the type of abrasive.

40|$|Abstract. The {{purpose of}} this study is to develop a {{non-contact}} <b>deburring</b> method and optimize its operation parameters. A <b>deburring</b> method using enhanced ultrasonic cavitation without abrasives is proposed and its work conditions were optimized. In additional, aging changes on the microhardness and surface roughness of specimens were studied experimentally in the process. The aging microhardness went through two stages. In the first stage, the work hardening characteristic of aluminum induced the increase in microhardness of specimen. After the microhardness reached an extreme, it went down. The surface roughness increased with treatment time. These time-dependent changes indicated that parts should be treated discontinuously during the ultrasonic <b>deburring</b> process to avoid being eroded by cavitation bubbles. <b>Deburring</b> experiments indicated that the burrs can be effectively removed by these enhanced cavitation bubbles...|$|R
