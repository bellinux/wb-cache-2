5|$|Full focus shifted onto The Missing Link when {{development}} {{ended on}} Human Revolution, {{with the main}} game's staff bringing their experience to bear upon the DLC when building its environments. The story was designed {{so that it would}} not spoil the events of the main narrative, but instead be a self-contained experience that would provide more context to the setting. The game's title referred to both its status as filling a narrative gap, and an in-game plot element. The DLC was developed as a stand-alone experience, accessible through the main menu independent of the player's place within the main game. This was due to technical problems related to the <b>improvement</b> <b>work</b> at transitioning {{from one to the other}} at its chronological point: the higher detail and polish would have made the experience jarring for players.|$|E
5|$|Highway {{construction}} in the mid-1930s further altered the park. The first of these proposals was the Grand Concourse Extension, later the Mosholu Parkway Extension, which was already being paved in 1934, when Robert Moses became Parks Commissioner. Moses immediately started planning for the Henry Hudson Parkway, which was originally envisioned {{as an extension of}} Riverside Drive. As proposed, the parkway would have only skirted the park's northwest corner in order to connect with the Saw Mill River Parkway in Westchester. However, due to that plan's high cost, the route was amended and the Henry Hudson Parkway became an extension of the West Side Elevated Highway, cutting straight through the park to intersect with the Saw Mill River Parkway. Unlike the Concourse extension, the Henry Hudson Parkway was minimally opposed by the community, as it was widely seen as an <b>improvement.</b> <b>Work</b> on the parkway began in 1935.|$|E

Thus, during this period of time, the SIT made <b>improvement</b> <b>works</b> to the existing developments in Singapore; and constructed new roads and open spaces.|$|R

25|$|The N8 was {{improved}} {{at various}} times during the 1970s through to {{the early years of}} the 21st century. Improvement projects carried out on the road during the 1970s, 1980s and 1990s involved periodic widening, resurfacing and the replacement of signposts. The first major <b>improvement</b> <b>work</b> carried out on the N8, post designation, involved the construction of a 4km single carriageway bypass south-west of Cahir in County Tipperary. This opened to traffic in 1991, and remained the N8 until the M8 motorway was completed through South Tipperary on 25 July 2008.|$|E

25|$|Wolverhampton {{gained the}} {{beginnings}} of modern local government in 1777, when the Wolverhampton Improvement Act was passed by Parliament. This allowed {{for the establishment of}} 125 Town Commissioners who undertook a variety of local <b>improvement</b> <b>work</b> such as punishing bear baiting, improving drainage, widening streets {{and by the end of}} the century street lighting had been provided at every street corner and over the doorway of every inn, and water supply had been improved by the sinking of ten new wells and the provision of a great water tank in the market place. Policing had been improved with the appointment of ten watchmen and attempts were also made to regulate the markets and inspect hazardous food.|$|E
25|$|As {{demand is}} rising for {{efficient}} global shipping of goods, the canal is positioned to {{be a significant}} feature of world shipping for the foreseeable future. However, changes in shipping patterns —particularly the increasing numbers of larger-than-Panamax ships— necessitated changes to the canal for it to retain a significant market share. In 2006 it was anticipated that by 2011, 37% of the world's container ships would be too large for the present canal, and hence a failure to expand would result in a significant loss of market share. The maximum sustainable capacity of the original canal, given some relatively minor <b>improvement</b> <b>work,</b> was estimated at 340 million PC/UMS tons per year; it was anticipated that this capacity would be reached between 2009 and 2012. Close to 50% of transiting vessels were already using the full width of the locks.|$|E
500|$|As {{with its}} Bognor Regis and Minehead counterparts, the Skegness resort {{underwent}} further <b>improvement</b> <b>work</b> in 1998 {{with the construction}} of the Skyline Pavilion. This tented structure is described by tourism writer Bruce Prideaux as a [...] "Baby Millennium Dome" [...] even though it pre-dated the dome. The Pavilion contains entertainment facilities such as stages, bars, restaurants, shops and amusements. [...] The improvement programme also included the construction of 1,045 brand new accommodation units, making it the largest timber-frame construction project in Europe that year. At the same time, the company dropped its use of the possessive apostrophe, changing from Butlin's to Butlins; after the refurbishment the resort was renamed as Butlins Resort Skegness, as it remains to date.|$|E

500|$|A {{feasibility}} study and further design {{work for a}} new station at Ebbw Vale Town was commissioned by the Welsh Assembly Government. The station on the former Corus steelworks site, which closed in 2002, is a mile north of the line's initial terminus, Ebbw Vale Parkway, and was forecast to cost £6.5million. It was opened on 17 May 2015. Network Rail will be carrying out further track <b>improvement</b> <b>work</b> in 2016-17 (to double the line between Aberbeeg & Crosskeys, as mentioned above and raise the line speed) and hopes to complete the project in 2018. [...] This will allow {{the introduction of a}} regular service to Newport and [...] in addition to the current one to and from Cardiff.|$|E
500|$|Though {{the need}} to improve this section of road was {{recognised}} in 1926, funding was limited. Only part of the required <b>improvement</b> <b>work</b> was undertaken, and included rerouting the highway along Lockyer Road, resuming several town lots, and resurfacing the road, at a cost of ₤8000. In March 1934, torrential rain caused widespread flooding in the Wheatbelt, affecting Northam, Toodyay, York, Beverley, and surrounding areas. Rail services were disrupted, and main roads were cut off at many points, including at Clackline. Some cars managed to bypass the flooded road by driving along the railway line, but such practice was described by the Royal Automobile Club as [...] "highly dangerous" [...] and [...] "against the railway regulations". The Main Roads Department had been considering completing the remaining improvements in November 1933, but the flooding made the situation more urgent. It prompted Albert Hawke, MLA for Northam, to write to the Commissioner for Main Roads, E. W. Tindale, urging that the Clackline works commence, especially since works at nearby Northam had almost been finished.|$|E
500|$|Continuing land {{reclamation}} {{and control of}} the Parrett was a long-running cycle of neglect followed by <b>improvement.</b> <b>Work</b> was carried out on the upper River Parrett basin in the Middle Ages by Glastonbury Abbey. Abbot Michael's survey of 1234 showed [...] of meadow recovered around the [...] "island" [...] of Sowy; from the accounts in the Abbey's rent books, this had increased to [...] by 1240. Flooding of adjacent moor land was partially addressed in the 13th century by building a number of embankment walls to contain the Parrett. These included Southlake Wall, Burrow Wall and Lake Wall. The River Tone was also diverted by the Abbot of Athelney and other land owners into a new embanked channel, joining the Parrett upstream from its original confluence. After the dissolution of the monasteries in the 16th century, much of the former abbey lands came {{under the control of the}} Crown, particularly King's Sedgemoor, which had been wholly owned by Glastonbury Abbey, with Henry VI's Courts of Sewers made responsible for maintaining existing drainage and various Commissions made responsible for land improvements. Further reclamation work was carried out over the next 500years. In 1597, [...] of land were recovered near the Parrett estuary; a few years later [...] near Pawlett were recovered by means of embankments; three further reclamations, totalling , were undertaken downstream of Bridgwater by 1660. Kings James I, Charles I, and Charles II continued to improve King's Sedgemoor.|$|E

60|$|In a small way, {{other men}} were {{following}} his lead, {{buying and selling}} land and profiting by the <b>improvement</b> <b>work</b> he was doing. But {{this was to be}} expected, and the small fortunes they were making at his expense did not irritate him. There was an exception, however. One Simon Dolliver, with money to go in with, and with cunning and courage to back it up, bade fair to become a several times millionaire at Daylight's expense. Dolliver, too, pyramided, playing quickly and accurately, and keeping his money turning over and over.

His fiercest fight was with the operating expenses, and this was a fight that never ended. There was never any let-up in his turning the thumb-screws of extended credit and economy. From the big wholesale suppliers down through the salary list to office stationery and postage stamps, he kept the thumb-screws turning. When his superintendents and heads of departments performed prodigies of cutting down, he patted them on the back and demanded more. When they threw down their hands in despair, he showed them how more could be accomplished.|$|E
