25|$|There {{is also a}} {{link between}} the hopping action and breathing: as the feet leave the ground, air is {{expelled}} from the lungs; bringing the feet forward ready for landing refills the lungs, providing further energy efficiency. Studies of kangaroos and wallabies have demonstrated, beyond the minimum energy expenditure required to hop at all, increased speed requires very little extra effort (much less than the same speed increase in, say, a horse, dog or human), and the <b>extra</b> <b>energy</b> <b>is</b> required to carry extra weight. For kangaroos, the key benefit of hopping is not speed to escape predators—the top speed of a kangaroo is no higher than that of a similarly sized quadruped, and the Australian native predators are in any case less fearsome than those of other countries—but economy: in an infertile country with highly variable weather patterns, the ability of a kangaroo to travel long distances at moderately high speed in search of food sources is crucial to survival.|$|E
25|$|In any semiconductor, {{the band}} gap means that only photons with {{that amount of}} energy, or more, will {{contribute}} to producing a current. In the case of silicon, the majority of visible light from red to violet has sufficient energy to make this happen. Unfortunately higher energy photons, those at the blue and violet end of the spectrum, have more than enough energy to cross the band gap; although some of this <b>extra</b> <b>energy</b> <b>is</b> transferred into the electrons, the majority of it is wasted as heat. Another issue is {{that in order to}} have a reasonable chance of capturing a photon, the n-type layer has to be fairly thick. This also increases the chance that a freshly ejected electron will meet up with a previously created hole in the material before reaching the p-n junction. These effects produce an upper limit on the efficiency of silicon solar cells, currently around 12 to 15% for common modules and up to 25% for the best laboratory cells (33.16% is the theoretical maximum efficiency for single band gap solar cells, see Shockley–Queisser limit.).|$|E

The main question that arises on the origin of this inequality between the surface degrees of freedom and the bulk degrees of freedom. We answer this question in M-theory. In our model, first M 0 -branes are compactified on one circle and then N D 0 -branes are created. Then, N D 0 -branes join to each other, grow and form a D 5 -brane. Next, D 5 - brane is compactified on two circle and our universe-D 3 -brane, two D 1 -brane and some <b>extra</b> <b>energies</b> <b>are</b> produced. After that, one of the D 1 -branes, which is more close to the universe-brane, gives its energy into it, leads to an increase of the difference between the number of degrees of freedom and the occurring inflation era. With the disappearance of this D 1 -brane, the number of degrees of freedom of boundary surface and bulk region becomes equal and inflation ends. At this stage, <b>extra</b> <b>energies</b> that <b>are</b> produced due to the compactification cause to an expansion of universe and deceleration epoch. Finally, another D 1 -brane, dissolves in our universe-brane, leads to an inequality between degrees of freedom and gives rise to a new phase of acceleration.

40|$|The {{interplay between}} spin and charge in solids is {{currently}} {{among the most}} discussed topics in condensed matter physics. Such interplay gives rise to magneto-electric coupling, which {{in the case of}} solids was named magneto-electric effect, as predicted by Curie on the basis of symmetry considerations. This effect enables the manipulation of magnetization using electrical field or, conversely, the manipulation of electrical polarization by magnetic field. The latter is known as the magnetocapacitance effect. Here, we show that non-equilibrium spin accumulation can induce tunnel magnetocapacitance through the formation of a tiny charge dipole. This dipole can effectively give rise to an additional serial capacitance, which represents an <b>extra</b> charging <b>energy</b> that the tunneling electrons would encounter.
