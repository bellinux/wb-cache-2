50|$|<b>Francevillite</b> is a uranyl-group {{vanadate}} mineral in the tyuyamunite series. Its {{chemical formula}} is (Ba,Pb)(UO2)2V2O8·5(H2O). <b>Francevillite</b> is a strongly radioactive mineral. It is typically orange, yellow or brownish yellow. It forms a series with curienite.|$|E
50|$|<b>Francevillite</b> {{occurs in}} the {{oxidized}} zone of a lead-bearing uranium-vanadium deposits. <b>Francevillite</b> was first described in 1957 for an occurrence in its type locality of the idle Mounana uranium mine, near Franceville, Haut-Ogooué, Gabon and was named for the city.|$|E

50|$|At its type {{locality}} it {{is associated}} with curienite (a closely related uranyl vanadate), chevetite (a lead vanadate), and mounanaite (another lead vanadate). At other localities, <b>francevillite</b> {{is associated with}} duttonite, vanuralite, mottramite, carnotite, dewindtite, torbernite, uranopilite, johannite and kasolite.|$|E
5000|$|Haut-Ogooué {{is one of}} Gabon's nine provinces. It {{is named}} after the Ogooué River. It covers an area of 36,547 km². The provincial capital is Franceville. One of its primary {{industries}} is mining, with manganese, gold and uranium being found in the region. The uranium-bearing mineral <b>Francevillite</b> {{takes its name from}} the primary city. It is the historical home of three cultures, the Obamba, Ndzabi and Téké. Like many regions in Africa, more traditional uses of the land have given way to rural migration to the larger cities. [...] In August 2006, its soccer club won the Gabon Independence Cup. http://www.panapress.com/newslatf.asp?code=eng001452&dte=17/08/2006 ...|$|E
40|$|Raman {{spectroscopy}} {{has been}} used to study a selection of uranyl vanadate minerals including carnotite, curienite, <b>francevillite,</b> tyuyamunite and metatyuyamunite. The minerals are characterised by an intense band in the 800 to 824 cm- 1 region, assigned to the ν 1 symmetric stretching vibrations of the (UO 2) 2 + units. A second intense band is observed in the 965 to 985 cm- 1 range and is attributed to the ν 1 (VO 3) symmetric stretching vibrations in the (V 2 O 8) units. This band is split with a second component observed at around 963 cm- 1. A band of very low intensity is observed around 948 cm- 1 and is assigned to the ν 3 antisymmetric stretching vibrations of the (VO 3) units. Bands in the range 608 - 655 cm- 1 may be attributed to molecular water librational modes or the stretching modes ￮(V 2 O 2) units. Bands in the range 573 - 583 cm- 1 may be connected with the ￮ (U-Oequatorial) vibrations or ￮ (V 2 O 2) units. Bands located in the range 467 - 539 cm- 1 may be also attributed to the ￮ (U-Oequatorial) units vibrations. The bending modes of the (VO 3) units are observed in the 463 to 480 cm- 1 range – there may be some coincidence with ￮ (U-Oequatorial). The bending modes of the (V 2 O 2) in the (V 2 O 8) units are located in a series of bands around 407, 365 and 347 cm- 1 (ν 2). Two intense bands are observed in the 304 to 312 cm- 1 range and 241 to 264 cm- 1 range and are assigned to the doubly degenerate ν 2 modes of the (UO 2) 2 + units. The study of the vibrational spectroscopy of uranyl vanadates is complicated by the overlap of bands from the (VO 3) and (UO 2) 2 + units. Raman spectroscopy has proven most useful in assigning bands to these two units since Raman bands are sharp and well separated as compared with infrared bands. The uranyl vanadate minerals are often found as crystals on a host matrix and Raman spectroscopy enables their in-situ characterisation without sample preparation...|$|E
