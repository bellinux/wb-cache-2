40|$|Reverberation is {{a problem}} for active sonar {{operating}} in shallow waters, reducing detection probabilities and introducing false alarms. Within the European Defence Agency project Rumble- 2, a demonstrator system has been developed for ”through the sensor” measurement of the bottom parameters needed to predict active sonar detection performance. An operational low-frequency active sonar is used along with a real-time inversion method. The demonstrator is a self-contained unit that reads sonar data without interfering with the on-going sonar operation. Several sea trials have been performed demonstrating its good performance. The inversion results are consistent with ground truth. Moreover, similar results are obtained for trials in the same area with quite different environmental conditions. The demonstrator tool is based on several simplifying assumptions, such as range independence and a <b>homogeneous</b> half-space <b>bottom.</b> Off-line studies, made with a sediment layer, show that the effects of a range dependent bathymetry are small in the survey area.

40|$|The {{backscattering}} {{of sound}} by inhomogeneities {{of the ocean}} sediment may provide a remarkable effect on underwater acoustic wave propagation. It may {{also be used as}} a means of remotely estimating complicated sediment properties. In this paper, a theoretical model of acoustic waves backscattered from an inhomogeneous sediment is formulated based on the Born approximation. The model not only contains the formal <b>homogeneous</b> <b>bottom</b> case but is also extended to the more realistic stratified bottom case. A complex wavenumber, in which an attenuation coefficient is introduced, reveals significant changes of the penetration depth within the sediment. The model predicts that for the stratified bottom, the backscattering strength is rapidly oscillating and decreases sharply at small grazing angles owing to the refraction of the waves caused by the sound velocity gradient. In order {{to reduce the number of}} independent variables, Biot's theory is applied to relate three-dimensional density fluctuations to sound speed fluctuations through porosity. A transverse-isotropic model is also developed to access the three-dimensional sound speed fluctuation spectrum. Geoacoustic surface and cross-hole tomographic data acquired from different sites characterizing sandy and silty bottoms are used to obtain three-dimensional sediment volume inhomogeneities. Backscattering strengths are evaluated for those bottom cases. The results agree with intuition and other published data...|$|E
40|$|An {{overflow}} {{of magnitude}} 0. 25 Sv (Sv 106 m 3 s 1) has been predicted {{to enter the}} Makarov Basin (part of the Canadian Basin in the Arctic Ocean) from the Eurasian Basin via a deep gap in the dividing Lomonosov ridge. The authors argue that this overflow does not ventilate the deep Makarov Basin (below 2400 m) where the water is too warm and salty to be compatible with such a large cold fresh inflow. However, complete isolation of the <b>homogeneous</b> <b>bottom</b> layer of the Makarov Basin must be ruled out because changes there {{are too small to}} arise from more than {{a small fraction of the}} measured geothermal heat flux into the basin. A small cold fresh inflow of about 0. 01 Sv from the Amundsen Basin seems to be required. This could occur if the gap in the dividing Lomonosov Ridge is shallower than previously thought. It could also occur if there is active mixing and dilution of the predicted overflow in the gap, leaving only a small fraction to descend into the deep Makarov Basin. Hydraulic theory and hydrographic observations are used to rule out any significant flow of dense water from the Makarov Basin into the deep Canada Basin, confirming previous hypotheses of isolation of the deep water in the Canada Basin. 1...|$|E

40|$|Abstract—This paper {{presents}} inversion {{results of}} the 2006 Shallow Water Experiment (SW 06) data measured on a vertical line array. A low-frequency (100 – 900 Hz) chirp source was towed along two tracks (circle, straight line) at 30 -m depth. For the inversions, a three-step optimization scheme {{is applied to the}} data using very fast simulated reannealing (VFSR). The objective function is defined by the energy of the backpropagated signal from the array to the source. At each step, water-column sound-speed profile (SSP), experimental geometry, and geoacoustic parameters are inverted successively. An environmental model is employed consisting of a linear segmented SSP in the water column, a sediment layer, and a half-space. The geometric parameter inversion results show good agreement with in situ measurements. Finally, the estimated geoacoustic parameters show that the experimental site near the vertical line array (VLA) is fairly <b>homogeneous</b> in <b>bottom</b> properties consisting of a 21 -m-thick sediment layer with sound speed of around 1600 m/s over a hard basement whose sound speed is approximately 1750 m/s.

40|$|We discuss {{here the}} {{evolution}} of vorticity and potential vorticity (PV) for a bottom current crossing a marine channel in shallow-water approximation, focusing {{on the effect of}} friction and mixing. The purpose of this research is indeed to investigate the role of friction and vertical entrainment on vorticity and PV spatial evolution in channels or straits when along-channel morphology variations are significant. To pursue this investigation, we pose the vorticity and PV equations for a <b>homogeneous</b> <b>bottom</b> water vein and we calculate these two quantities as an integral form. Our theoretical findings are considered in the context of in situ hydrographic data related to the Eastern Mediterranean Deep Water (EMDW), i. e., a dense, bottom water vein that flows northwestward, along the Sicily Channel (Mediterranean Sea). Indeed, the narrow sill of this channel implies that friction and entrainment need to be considered. Small tidal effects in the Sicily Channel allow for a steady theoretical approach. We argue that bottom current vorticity is prone to significant sign changes and oscillations due to topographic effects when, in particular, the current flows over the sill of a channel. These vorticity variations are, however, modulated by frictional effects due to seafloor roughness and morphology. Such behavior is also reflected in the PV spatial evolution, which shows an abrupt peak around the sill region. Our diagnoses on vorticity and PV allow us to obtain general insights about the effect of mixing and friction on the pathway and internal structure of bottom-trapped currents flowing through channels and straits, and to discuss spatial variability of the frictional coefficient. Our approach significantly differs from other PV-constant approaches previously used in studying the dynamics of bottom currents flowing through rotating channels...|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} pH on the {{precipitation}} of soy protein between pH 4 and 6. 8 was investigated. Precipitation between pH 5. 7 and 6. 8 gave a binary liquid-liquid separation in which a protein-rich secondary liquid phase containing between 20 - 30 wt % protein of 80 - 99 % purity in glycinin formed as droplets of 1 - 10 mu m. The droplets could be coalesced upon centrifugation to form a <b>homogeneous</b> <b>bottom</b> liquid layer. The high-protein concentration phase was stable (did not precipitate or crystallize) for up to several months when stored at 4 degrees C. Stable high-protein liquid phases have not previously been reported. In the pH region for which liquid-liquid separation occurred (pH 6. 15 to 5. 35), the droplet-size distribution was controlled by nucleation and growth. No drop breakage, and little or no drop coalescence was observed. Mixer speed and geometry {{did not have a}} large effect {{on the size of the}} protein-rich droplets in suspension. Nucleation occurred in two separate bursts at pH 6. 15 and pH 5. 85, followed by growth of the new nuclei as pH was decreased. Thus, the drop-size distribution was monomodal between 6. 15 and 5. 85, and bimodal between pH 5. 85 and 5. 35. At pH 5. 6 and below, protein precipitated as amorphous material which intertwined with and bound primary particles into aggregates. These agglomerates grew with decreasing pH, particularly below pH 5. 35, as more protein precipitated with amorphous material acting as a binder. The addition of NaCl prevented the liquid-liquid separation at higher pH. Instead solid precipitates of a different morphology were formed at low-pH only.

40|$|Remote sensing {{has been}} used to map river {{bathymetry}} for several decades. Non-contact methods are necessary in several cases: inaccessible rivers, large-scale depth mapping, very shallow rivers. The remote sensing techniques used for river bathymetry are reviewed. Frequently, these techniques have been developed for marine environment and have then been transposed to riverine environments. These techniques can be divided into two types: active remote sensing, such as ground penetrating radar and bathymetric lidar; or passive remote sensing, such as through-water photogrammetry and radiometric models. This last technique which consists of finding a logarithmic relationship between river depth and image values appears to be the most used. Fewer references exist for the other techniques, but lidar is an emerging technique. For each depth measurement method, we detail the physical principles and then a review of the results obtained in the field. This review shows a lack of data for very shallow rivers, where a very high spatial resolution is needed. Moreover, the cost related to aerial image acquisition is often huge. Hence we propose an application of two techniques, radiometric models and through-water photogrammetry, with very high-resolution passive optical imagery, light platforms, and off-the-shelf cameras.

University of Alaska Fairbanks, 1976 The {{examination}} of hydrographic data obtained in Bristol Bay 1969 - 1970 allowed oceanographic conditions {{in this region}} to be described for shorter time periods (several weeks) than previous studies (several months).

During late spring, a steep thermocline developed in the offshore regions and was present throughout summer, while the salinity structure remained vertically <b>homogeneous.</b> Salinity and <b>bottom</b> temperature contours tended to follow isobaths and indicated a cyclonic circulation in the bay. Summer surface temperature distributions are characterized by regions of cold water.

40|$|In {{this study}} {{the focus is}} on {{modelling}} turbulence anisotropy in open channel flows with the SWASH model. Turbulence anisotropy significantly influences the flow features of: channel flows with heterogeneous roughness conditions, curved open channel flows, compound channel flows with different floodplain depths, etc. The SWASH model is a non-hydrostatic wave-flow model, mainly used to predict the transformation of surface waves from offshore to the beach. For this study, adaptations were made to this SWASH model, in order to model turbulence anisotropy. Two different modelling approaches were used: RANS modelling and Large Eddy Simulation (LES). The SWASH model is extended with a non-linear k-? closure to the RANS equations, since the standard linear closure does not take turbulence anisotropy into account. A 3 D subgrid model is implemented to perform LES. The performance of the LES code and the RANS model with the non-linear k-? closure is tested on two flow geometries: an open channel flow with <b>homogeneous</b> <b>bottom</b> roughness conditions and an open channel flow with parallel smooth to rough bed sections. Results of the RANS computations, for both horizontal homogeneous and non-homogeneous open channel flow, show good agreement with laboratory measurements of Muller and Studerus [13], Nezu and Rodi [17] and Wang and Cheng [32]. Although there is a number of closure constants involved with the non-linear k-? model, additional tuning of these coefficients was not necessary for this study: both the homogeneous and non-homogenous test case were simulated successfully using the standard values proposed by Speziale [25]. With its low computational costs and robustness, the non-linear k-? model appears to be a useful extension to the SWASH wave-flow model. LES results for horizontal uniform flow are validated with DNS data of Moser, Kim and Mansour [12]. Especially near the bed the LES results deviate from the DNS data. The mean velocity, as well as the transverse and vertical turbulence intensities, is seriously underestimated. The deviation from the DNS data is related to the use of non- periodic boundary conditions, the coarse grid resolution, the size of the computational domain and the amount of numerical dissipation that is involved. Since it is the bottom region where secondary currents are generated, the use of the present LES code for problems involving heterogeneous roughness is not appropriate.

40|$|In this paper, {{we explore}} the hydrographic {{structure}} and heat {{budget in the}} deep Canada Basin by using data measured with McLane-Moored-Profilers (MMP), bottom pressure recorders (BPR), and conductivity-temperature-depth (CTD) profilers. Upward from the bottom, a <b>homogeneous</b> <b>bottom</b> layer and its overlaying double diffusive convection (DDC) steps are well identified at Mooring A (75 degrees N, 150 degrees W). We find that the deep water is in weak diapycnal mixing because the effective diffusivity of the bottom layer is approximate to 1. 8 x 10 - 5 m 2 s- 1, while {{that of the other}} steps is approximate to 10 - 6 m 2 s- 1. The vertical heat flux through the DDC steps is evaluated by using different methods. We find that the heat flux (0. 1 - 11 mWm- 2) is much smaller than geothermal heating (approximate to 50 mWm- 2). This suggests that the stack of DDC steps acts as a thermal barrier in the deep basin. Moreover, the temporal distributions of temperature and salinity differences across the interface are exponential, whereas those of heat flux and effective diffusivity are found to be approximately lognormal. Both are the result of strong intermittency. Between 2003 and 2011, temperature fluctuations close to the sea floor were distributed asymmetrically and skewed toward positive values, which provide a direct observation that geothermal heating was transferred into the ocean. Both BPR and CTD data suggest that geothermal heating and not the warming of the upper ocean is the dominant mechanism responsible for the warming of deep water. As the DDC steps prevent vertical heat transfer, geothermal heating is unlikely to {{have a significant effect on}} the middle and upper Arctic Ocean.

40|$|An {{analytical}} {{expression for}} higher-order reflectances from a shallow-water <b>homogeneous</b> ocean <b>bottom</b> modeled as an egg-carton surface is presented. Roughness of this ideal surface is expressed as the amplitude-to-length ratio of its basic sinusoidal function. Any real surface {{that can be}} approximated by an egg-carton function will effectively have a comparable roughness metric. Incidence and reflection directions are considered in full azimuthal variation. The detector is located just below the water surface so that only in-water reflections are considered {{and there are no}} air-water transmission effects. Furthermore, this setup allows for an understanding of reflections that occur in media with any index of refraction or absorption coefficient. Fixing the detector footprint but adjusting its field-of-view enables the observation of the same bottom surface area as the depth varies while keeping the roughness and the number of waveforms viewed constant. First-order reflectance decreases as the roughness increases, as was shown in the two-dimensional case. This is true as the roughness varies, regardless of the bottom reference level chosen. Focusing effects are expected from (but are not limited to) second-order reflectance and are due to parts of the bottom whose angles maximize both incoming light and the reflections toward the detector. Along a plane about the vertical axis, the roughness ratio for a fixed-length waveform that returns the highest reflectance can be found. In three dimensions, this phenomenon is complicated by reflections from all hemispherical directions. Shadowing and obscuration behave similarly as in the two-dimensional case although shadowed areas will have an increased potential to reflect light from other directions (than the plane defined by the source incidence and the vertical directions). This is expected to cause higher order reflections to increase as the roughness increases. Cornell University Graduate School ONR Ocean Optics and Biolog...|$|R

High-resolution (sampled at 10 s interval) temperature data from moored sensors revealed intense internal wave activity. The maximum value of Brunt-Vaisala frequency, which is the maximum frequency limit of internal waves in the thermocline, suggests that the upper frequency limit of the internal wave, which can be generated during this period, is 23 cph (2. 6 min). High and low frequency waves caused variations of ~ 3 oC and ~ 5 oC respectively in the temperature field. But the low frequency internal waves were found to contain maximum energy compared to the high frequency waves.
