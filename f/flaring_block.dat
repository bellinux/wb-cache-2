The group's {{traditional}} colours are blue and white, which are also the colours of all the Budućnost sports clubs. For FK Budućnost Podgorica home games, Varvari occupy the northern stand (Sjever) of the Podgorica city stadium. They also have a reserved stand at the Morača Sports Center, as supporters of KK Buducnost basketball club.The focal point for the group during the late 1990s was the basketball club, which started investing heavily while the football club toiled in {{the lower half of}} the table.Since foundation years, Varvari gained a reputation of violent group, and in the recent history they made a few biggest accidents on the football matches. At First League 2004-05 game Budućnost - Partizan Belgrade, <b>flares,</b> <b>blocks,</b> construction materials and similar objects were thrown from the North stand to the pitch and match was abbandoned for 15 minutes. Year later, game Budućnost - Crvena Zvezda Belgrade was suspended for two hours after home supporters (Varvari) throwed tear gases on the pitch and, after that, attacked visitors' ultras. On the spring 2006, there was a crowd violence on the local rivals game Budućnost - Zeta. In the Montenegrin First League, numerous matches of FK Budućnost were suspended due to crowd violence or crowd-invasion to the pitch. During the last seasons, there was an escalation of violence on Montenegrin Derby games.They are the best organised and largest fan group in Montenegro. According to many fan magazines from the Balkan they are the only fans in Montenegro who are on the level of the largest fan groups from ex-Yugoslavia.|$|R

40|$|We jointly {{analyze the}} gamma-ray burst (GRB) data {{observed}} with BAT and XRT {{on board the}} Swift mission to present a global view on the internal energy dissipation processes in GRBs, including precursors, prompt gamma-ray emission, extended soft gamma-ray emission, and late X-ray <b>flares.</b> The Bayesian <b>block</b> method is utilized to analyze the BAT lightcurves to identify various emission episodes. Our results suggest that these emission components likely share a same physical origin, which is repeated activation of the GRB central engine. What we observe in the gamma-ray band may be the tip-of-iceberg of more extended underlying activities. The precursor emission, which is detected in about 10...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—Cuticular {{hydrocarbons}} {{appear to}} play a role in ant nestmate recognition, but few studies have tested this hypothesis experimentally with purified hydrocarbon extracts. We exposed captive colonies of the harvester ant Pogonomyrmex barbatus to small glass blocks coated with whole cuticular lipid extracts and the purified hydrocarbon portion of extracts from nestmate and nonnestmate workers. As an estimate of agonistic behavior, we measured the proportion of ants in contact with <b>blocks</b> that <b>flared</b> their mandibles. <b>Blocks</b> coated with cuticular extracts from nonnestmates were contacted by more workers in one of two experiments and elicited higher levels of aggression in both experiments than blocks bearing extracts from nestmates. The cuticular hydrocarbon fraction of extracts alone was sufficient to elicit agonistic behavior toward nonnestmates. The results demonstrate that harvester ants can perceive differences in cuticular hydrocarbon composition, and can use those differences in nestmate recognition.

40|$|Power {{spectral}} {{analyses of}} the time series of solar proton events {{during the past three}} solar cycles reveal a periodicity around 154 days. This feature is prominent in all of the cycles combined, cycles 19 and 21 individually, but is only weak in cycle 20. These results are consistent with the presence of similar periodicities between 152 and 155 days in the occurrence rate of major solar <b>flares,</b> the sunspot <b>blocking</b> function (Ps), the 10. 7 cm radio flux (F 10. 7), and the sunspot number (Rz). This suggests that the circa 154 -days periodicity may be a fundamental characteristic of the sun. Periods around 50 - 52 days are also found in the combined data set and in the three individual cycles, in general agreement with the detection of this periodicity in major flares in cycle 19, and in Ps, F 10. 7, and Rz in cycle 21. The cause of the 155 day period remains unknown. The spectra contain lines (or show power at frequencies) consistent with a model in which the periodicity is caused by differential rotation of active zones and a model in which it is related to beat frequencies between solar oscillations, as proposed by Wolff (1974, 1983) ...|$|R
30|$|In {{relation}} to absorption of the layers on ionograms, {{we know that}} the solar radiation X-ray with wavelengths between 2 and 8 Å is responsible for the ionization of all the atmospheric constituents, while the EUV with wavelengths ranging from 1027 to 1118  Å is responsible for the ionization of the minor constituents present at the D region heights. Therefore, an extra amount of solar radiation could have increased the D region density leading to an increase in its opacity to shorter wavelength electromagnetic signals propagating upward (Abdu 1966; Abdu et al. 1967, 1973). In this case, the lower frequencies of the digisonde would be blocked. Therefore, the disappearance of the Es layers and E and F regions could be a response of the D region density to sudden X-ray and/or EUV solar radiation. We have no measurement of the D region density or of the opacity to prove that it was directly affected by the solar flares during these events. However, based on the short time period between the solar event observation and the observed effect in the fbEs, it seems plausible to assume that an X-ray additional ionization flux imposed on the ionosphere due to the solar <b>flares</b> would have <b>blocked</b> the lower frequencies of the digisonde. Also, our results agree with that reported by Sripathi et al. (2013) showing the sudden disappearance of echoes of the ionograms during the flare event, indicating absorption of radio signals in the D region.|$|R
40|$|Objectives: To {{investigate}} the relative contribution of nitric oxide (NO) to the vascular and neural mechanisms underlying the ACh-induced vasodilatation in human skin. Methods: ACh {{was delivered to}} {{the skin of the}} forearm of 28 healthy volunteers using intradermal microdialysis. Subsequent changes in tissue levels of NO and histamine were measured in the dialysate outflow and the associated changes in skin blood flux followed with the use of scanning laser Doppler imaging. Results: ACh caused a dose-dependent increase in skin blood flux measured directly above the probe, associated with a twofold increase in dialysate NO. L-NAME (5 mM) delivered simultaneously via the dialysis probe totally blocked the increase in dialysate NO but only partially attenuated (? 30 %) the ACh-induced increase in blood flux. At concentrations? 6. 25 mM, ACh also induced a widespread flare response, up to 40 mm in width, accompanied by the sensation of itch. The <b>flare</b> was not <b>blocked</b> by L-NAME or the H 1 receptor antagonist levocetirizine, but was reduced by C-fiber blockade. Dialysate histamine levels remained unchanged at all times. Conclusions: These experiments offer further insight into the use of dialysis as an experimental technique in the skin. They provide direct evidence that the skin microvascular response to ACh is only partially mediated by NO. Further they suggest that ACh at higher concentrations can induce an axon-reflex-mediated response that is independent of NO release at the site of dermal provocation or of local histamine release...|$|R
40|$|We {{address the}} highly debated issue of {{constraining}} the gamma-ray emission region in blazars from cross-correlation analysis using discrete correlation function between radio and gamma-ray light curves. The {{significance of the}} correlations is evaluated using two different approaches: simulating light curves and mixed source correlations. The cross-correlation analysis yielded 26 sources with significant correlations. In most of the sources, the gamma-ray peaks lead the radio with time lags in the range + 20 and + 690 days, whereas in sources 1633 + 382 and 3 C 345 we find the radio emission to lead the gamma rays by - 15 and - 40 days, respectively. Apart from the individual source study, we stacked the correlations of all sources and also those based on sub-samples. The time lag from the stacked correlation is + 80 days for the whole sample and the distance travelled by the emission region corresponds to 7 pc. We also compared the start times of activity in radio and gamma rays of the correlated <b>flares</b> using Bayesian <b>block</b> representation. This shows {{that most of the}} flares at both wavebands start at almost the same time, implying a co-spatial origin of the activity. The correlated sources show more flares and are brighter in both bands than the uncorrelated ones. Comment: 15 pages, 8 figures and 4 tables. Published in MNRAS.
