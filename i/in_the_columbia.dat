5|$|Adjacent to the Columbia Slough basin are the {{watersheds}} of the Sandy River to the east, Johnson Creek to {{the south}}, the Willamette {{to the south}} and west, and the Columbia to the north.

5|$|After her Navy service {{ended in}} 1919, she was {{returned}} to her original owners, who, at least once, chartered her to another shipping company. In May 1922, Iowan rammed and sank the Furness-Prince Line steamer Welsh Prince <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Columbia</b> River near Astoria, Oregon, killing seven men in the process. In June 1941, Iowan ran aground on a reef near Point Conception, California, and suffered $500,000 in damages while buffeted by waves on the reef. She was freed from the reef after two weeks, towed to Los Angeles, and repaired.|$|E

5|$|In 1910, {{the city}} {{installed}} a large boulder on the southeast {{portion of the}} grounds. The Oregon Railway and Navigation Company had found the 15,000-year-old boulder in 1897 and moved it to Portland. The ten ton Wallula Stone was discovered <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Columbia</b> River Gorge, and was covered with petroglyphs. It was returned to the Umatilla tribe of Native Americans in Eastern Oregon in 1996. The old elevators inside were replaced again in 1946, and in 1948 a runaway truck destroyed part of the stone railing on the Fifth Avenue side, which was then fixed.|$|E

5|$|Solomon Taylor {{ordered the}} group of locals not to fire. It is unclear which group fired first, but three shots were heard, one of which hit Lieutenant Robinson. When the deserters fled the scene the Lincoln Midnight Riders chased them {{approximately}} a quarter mile before turning back.

5|$|The Columbia Gorge AVA {{is found}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Columbia</b> Gorge. This region {{straddles}} the Columbia River, and thus lies in both Oregon and Washington; {{it is made}} up of Hood River and Wasco counties in Oregon, and Skamania and Klickitat counties in Washington. The region lies to the east of the summits of nearby Mount Hood and Mount Adams, situated in their rain shadows; thus, the region is significantly drier than the Willamette Valley. It also exhibits significant differences in elevation due to gorge geography, and strong winds common in the area also play a factor in the region's climate. This allows a wide variety of grapes to be grown <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Columbia</b> Gorge. The region has nearly 40 vineyards, growing a wide variety of grapes, including Syrah, Pinot noir, Chardonnay, Gewürztraminer, Zinfandel, Cabernet Sauvignon, Pinot gris, Riesling, and Sangiovese.|$|E

5|$|The {{floodplain}} of Johnson Creek is {{a remnant}} of large glacial floods known as the Missoula Floods that deposited thick sediments between 18,000 and 13,000years ago <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Columbia</b> River Basin, including much of the Willamette Valley. Underlying the sediments are substantial thicknesses of basalt lavas from the Columbia River Basalt Group. The lava, exposed mainly in the uplands, has been folded and faulted to form a series of sub-basins, including the Johnson Creek watershed.|$|E
5|$|Also in 1994, United States Secretary of the Interior Bruce Babbitt first {{proposed}} {{the removal of}} several Pacific Northwest dams because of their impact on salmon spawning. The Northwest Power Planning Council approved a plan that provided more water for fish and less for electricity, irrigation, and transportation. Environmental advocates have called {{for the removal of}} certain dams <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Columbia</b> system in the years since. Of the 227major dams <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Columbia</b> River drainage basin, the four Washington dams on the lower Snake River are often identified for removal, for example in an ongoing lawsuit concerning a Bush administration plan for salmon recovery. These dams and reservoirs limit the recovery of upriver salmon runs to Idaho's Salmon and Clearwater rivers. Historically, the Snake produced over 1.5million spring and summer Chinook salmon, a number that has dwindled to several thousand in recent years. Idaho Power Company's Hells Canyon dams have no fish ladders (and do not pass juvenile salmon downstream), and thus allow no steelhead or salmon to migrate above Hells Canyon. In 2007, the destruction of the Marmot Dam on the Sandy River was the first dam removal in the system. Other Columbia Basin dams that have been removed include Condit Dam on Washington's White Salmon River, and the Milltown Dam on the Clark Fork in Montana.|$|E
5|$|In 1792, Lieutenant William Broughton, a British explorer, led {{the first}} trip by non-natives as far up the Columbia River as {{the mouth of}} the Sandy River. He and his men camped on Sauvie Island, which lies between the Willamette and Columbia rivers {{directly}} opposite {{the mouth of the}} slough. Broughton encountered many Chinookans while exploring and mapping geographic features including Hayden Island and other islands <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Columbia</b> just north of the slough. When Lewis and Clark visited the area in 1806, the Clackamas tribe consisted of about 1,800people living in 11villages. The explorers estimated that 800people of the Multnomah tribe of Chinookans lived in five villages on Sauvie Island.|$|E

5|$|In the interim, {{rather than}} await a decision, Ferrari {{continued}} her studies. Between 1921 and 1923 she visited many clinics in Europe, including facilities in Austria, Belgium, England, France, Germany and Italy. She {{assisted in the}} clinic of Marie Curie in Paris as well as <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Columbia</b> Hospital for Women and Lying-In Asylum in Washington, DC. The Faculty of Medicine of Paris awarded her the first diploma ever given to a woman for studies in urinary tract monitoring. In 1924, she designed a vaginoscope, which was much easier to sterilize and was more adaptable to multiple specula than previous models. The device significantly improved services which were available to women in Brazil, and was featured in the articles of the Journal of Gynecology and Obstetrics of Rio de Janeiro. The innovation won the Grand Prize at the 1924 Congreso Hispano Lusitano Americano de Ciencias Médicas held in Seville, Spain.|$|E
5|$|Iowan resumed cargo {{service with}} American-Hawaiian after her return from World War I service. Though {{the company had}} {{abandoned}} its original Hawaiian sugar routes by this time, Iowan continued inter-coastal service through the Panama Canal.	For {{a time in the}} early 1920s, Iowan was chartered to the United American Line. In May 1922, the Associated Press reported that Iowan, sailing under the United American banner, was loading wheat, flour, and lumber at Tacoma, Washington, for England and European ports. Later that same month, on 29 May, Iowan rammed and sank the Furness-Prince Line cargo ship Welsh Prince <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Columbia</b> River near Astoria, Oregon. Seven men aboard Welsh Prince were killed and three were injured in the crash and subsequent fire.|$|E
5|$|Marshall {{was elected}} to Phi Beta Kappa during his final year at college. He {{graduated}} in June 1873, receiving the top grade in fourteen of his thirty-six courses {{in a class of}} twenty-one students. As a result of his libel case, he had become increasingly interested in law and began seeking someone to teach him. At that time, the only way to become a lawyer in Indiana was to apprentice under a member of the Indiana bar association. His great-uncle Woodson Marshall began to help him, but the younger Marshall soon moved to Columbia City, Indiana, to live with his parents. Marshall read law <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Columbia</b> City law office of Walter Olds, a future member of the Indiana Supreme Court, {{for more than a year}} and was admitted to the Indiana bar on April 26, 1875.|$|E
