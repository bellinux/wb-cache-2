5|$|Rwanda's {{legal system}} is {{largely based on}} German and Belgian civil law systems and {{customary}} law. The judiciary is independent of the executive branch, although the President and the Senate {{are involved in the}} appointment of Supreme Court judges. Human Rights Watch have praised the Rwandan government for progress made in the delivery of justice including the abolition of the death penalty, but also allege interference in the judicial system by members of the government, such as the politically motivated appointment of judges, misuse of prosecutorial power, and pressure on judges to make particular decisions. The constitution provides for two types of courts: ordinary and specialised. Ordinary courts are the Supreme Court, the High Court, and regional courts, while specialised courts are military courts and a system of commercial courts created in 2011 to expedite commercial litigations. Between 2004 and 2012, a system of <b>Gacaca</b> courts was in operation. <b>Gacaca,</b> a Rwandan traditional court operated by villages and communities, was revived to expedite the trials of genocide suspects. The court succeeded in clearing the backlog of genocide cases, but was criticised by human rights groups as not meeting legal fair standard.|$|E
5|$|In 1999, 220 coffee growers {{formed an}} {{association}} in the Maraba district (part {{of the former}} Butare Province) to tackle this problem. Many of these farmers had lost family members during the 1994 genocide, while others had husbands in prison, accused of participating in the killings and due to face trial in the traditional <b>gacaca</b> courts. They named the association Abahuzamugambi, a Kinyarwanda word for people who work together to achieve a goal. The farmers hoped that by forming the association, they would increase revenue by selling directly to exporters in Kigali instead of through an intermediary transport company. They divided their profits and used them to buy tools, fertilisers and seeds to increase yields.|$|E
5|$|The Tutsi RPF {{restarted}} their offensive, {{and took}} control of the country methodically, gaining control of the whole country by mid-July. The international response to the genocide was limited, with major powers reluctant to strengthen the already overstretched UN peacekeeping force. When the RPF took over, approximately two million Hutu fled to neighbouring countries, in particular Zaïre, fearing reprisals; additionally, the RPF-led army was a key belligerent in the First and Second Congo Wars. Within Rwanda, a period of reconciliation and justice began, with the establishment of the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda (ICTR) and the reintroduction of <b>Gacaca,</b> a traditional village court system. Since 2000 Rwanda's economy, tourist numbers, and Human Development Index have grown rapidly; between 2006 and 2011 the poverty rate reduced from 57% to 45%, while life expectancy rose from 46.6 years in 2000 to 59.7 years in 2015.|$|E
25|$|The {{categorization}} of <b>Gacaca</b> courts in Rwanda {{is based on}} the concept of a cell and a sector. A cell is equivalent to a small community while a sector is equivalent to a small group of cells making up a village. Within these two categories, there were 9013 cells and 1545 sectors, with over 12,103 <b>Gacaca</b> courts established nationwide. Presiding over the <b>Gacaca</b> meetings are judges known as inyangamugayo. These judges are elected to serve on a nine-person council. During the <b>Gacaca</b> process, there were two phases which took place. Starting between 2005-2006, information was taken from those who were accused from all <b>Gacaca</b> cells. The approximate number of those who were accused was 850,000 with about 50,000 of those being deceased.|$|E
25|$|Throughout the years, the <b>Gacaca</b> {{court system}} {{went through a}} series of modifications. It is {{estimated}} that the <b>Gacaca</b> court system has tried over one million cases to date.|$|E
25|$|Hutu Rwandan genocidal {{leaders are}} on trial at the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda, in the Rwandan National Court system, and, most recently, through the {{informal}} <b>Gacaca</b> programme. Recent reports highlight {{a number of}} reprisal killings of survivors for giving evidence at <b>Gacaca.</b> These <b>Gacaca</b> trials are overseen by the government established National Unity and Reconciliation Commission. <b>Gacaca</b> is a traditional adjudication mechanism at the umudugudu (village) level, whereby {{members of the community}} elect elders to serve as judges, and the entire community is present for the case. This system was modified to try lower-level génocidaires, those who had killed or stolen but did not organize massacres. Prisoners, dressed in pink, stand trial before members of their community. Judges accord sentences, which vary widely, from returning to prison, to paying back the cost of goods stolen, to working in the fields of families of victims. <b>Gacaca</b> officially concluded in June 2012. For many, <b>gacaca</b> has been a vehicle for closure, and prisoners' testimonies have helped many families locate victims. <b>Gacaca</b> takes place once a week in the morning in every village across Rwanda, and is compulsory.|$|E
25|$|Given {{that there}} were {{insufficient}} resources to organise first-world courts, the <b>Gacaca</b> system had to be preferred over the only alternative to the <b>Gacaca</b> system for local communities {{which might have been}} revenge.|$|E
25|$|The government's {{decision}} to exclude {{crimes committed by}} soldiers of the current ruling party, the RPF, from <b>Gacaca</b> courts' jurisdiction has left victims of their crimes still waiting for justice, Human Rights Watch said. Soldiers of the RPF, which ended the genocide in July 1994 {{and went on to}} form the current government, killed {{tens of thousands of people}} between April and December 1994. In 2004, the <b>Gacaca</b> law was amended to exclude such crimes, and the government worked to ensure that these crimes were not discussed in <b>Gacaca.</b>|$|E
25|$|The name <b>Gacaca</b> {{is derived}} from the Kinyarwanda word umucaca meaning “a plant so soft to sit on that people prefer to gather on it”. Originally, <b>Gacaca</b> gatherings were meant to restore order and harmony within {{communities}} by acknowledging wrongs and having justice restored to those who were victims.|$|E

25|$|In response, Rwanda {{implemented}} the <b>Gacaca</b> court system, which necessarily evolved {{to fit the}} scenario from its prior form of traditional cultural communal law enforcement procedures. The <b>Gacaca</b> courts are a method of transitional justice and are designed to promote communal healing and rebuilding {{in the wake of}} the Rwandan Genocide. Rwanda has especially focused on community rebuilding placing justice in the hands of trusted citizens. However, the system has come under criticism from a number of sources, including the Survivors Fund, which represents survivors of the genocide, due to the danger that it poses to survivors and there have been a number of reports on survivors being targeted for giving evidence at the courts. However, the Rwandan government maintains the success of <b>Gacaca</b> Courts citing their present success as a country.|$|E
25|$|On 14 December 2009, RTLM {{announcer}} Valérie Bemeriki {{was convicted}} by a <b>gacaca</b> court in Rwanda {{and sentenced to}} life imprisonment {{for her role in}} inciting genocidal acts.|$|E
25|$|The {{spontaneous}} {{emergence of}} the <b>Gacaca</b> activities and the gradual support for <b>Gacaca</b> by the authorities was clearly motivated {{by the fact that}} the ordinary justice system was virtually non-existent after the genocide. The <b>Gacaca</b> had to do what it did before—relieve the pressure on the ordinary courts. These were now not working slowly, as they did before, but not working at all. Once they started to work, they were quickly overloaded with the cases of genocide suspects who were filling the prisons. This new form of justice was bold, but not unprecedented: This becomes evident when one considers the emerging numbers of Truth and Reconciliation Commissions (TRC) as, for example, that in South Africa. The slogan of the South African TRC “Revealing is Healing” and its argument that truth-telling serves as a “therapeutic function” underline this assumption. The TRC format was suggested to the Rwandan government, but ultimately they chose to pursue mass justice through Gacaca; a system where their country had roots and familiarity.|$|E
25|$|However, a February 2009 {{report by}} {{eighteen}} <b>Gacaca</b> court judges {{said that at}} least 64,000 refugees had been killed. Many {{of the victims were}} buried alive. Red Cross workers and local clergy were reportedly complicit in the killing.|$|E
25|$|Rwanda’s {{experiment}} in mass community-based justice {{has been a}} mixed success. Many Rwandans agree that it has shed light on what happened in their local communities during the 100 days of genocide in 1994, even {{if not all of}} the truth was revealed. They say it helped some families find murdered relatives’ bodies which they could finally bury with some dignity. It has also ensured that tens of thousands of perpetrators were brought to justice. Some Rwandans say that it has helped set in motion reconciliation within their communities. The majority of praise for <b>Gacaca</b> has come from Rwanda's government and the Rwandan citizens who have direct experience with the system. Naturally this is a biased source, however {{it is important to note}} that it is those most affected by the Rwandan genocide who are offering praise, citing a sense of closure, acceptance, and forgiveness following <b>Gacaca</b> trials. The <b>Gacaca</b> trials also served to promote reconciliation by providing a means for victims to learn the truth about the death of their family members and relatives. They also gave perpetrators the opportunity to confess their crimes, show remorse and ask for forgiveness in front of their community.|$|E
25|$|A {{traditional}} local {{justice system}} called <b>Gacaca</b> predominated {{in much of}} the region as an institution for resolving conflict, rendering justice and reconciliation. The Tutsi king was the ultimate judge and arbiter for those cases that reached him. Despite the traditional nature of the system, harmony and cohesion had been established among Rwandans and within the kingdom since the beginning of Rwanda.|$|E
25|$|Ruling {{over these}} {{lineages}} were kings (mwami). Within Rwanda, kings ruled over many different sections of Rwanda. The king, within Rwandan society, embodied power, justice, and knowledge {{and was the}} mediator of any major dispute within their region. However, before disputes {{were brought to the}} kings, they were heard locally by wise men as what is referred to as <b>Gacaca.</b>|$|E
25|$|However, {{with the}} {{colonization}} of Rwanda {{and the arrival}} of western systems of law, Rwandan society soon began to change as a whole. With this implementation and usage of western legal systems, Rwandans began to go to courts to deal with their disputes. In turn, kings and wisemen soon began to lose their legitimacy within Rwandan society. And with this loss of legitimacy, <b>Gacaca</b> courts began to dwindle down in numbers.|$|E
25|$|Following {{several days}} of talks with Congolese {{government}} representatives, the FDLR announced on 31 March 2005 that they were abandoning their armed struggle and returning to Rwanda as a political party. The talks held in Rome, Italy were mediated by Sant'Egidio. The Rwandan government stated that any returning genocidaires would face justice, most probably through the <b>gacaca</b> court system. It was stated that {{if all of the}} FDLR commanders, who are believed to control about 10,000 militants, disarmed and returned, a key source of cross-border tensions would be removed.|$|E
25|$|There are criticisms and {{controversy}} surrounding {{the decision to}} implement <b>Gacaca</b> courts. Human rights groups worry about the fairness since trials are held without lawyers which {{means that there is}} less protection for defendants than in conventional courts. In addition conventional trials have seen false accusations and intimidation of witnesses on both sides; issues of revenge have been raised as a concern. The acquittal rate has been 20 percent which suggests a large number of trials were not well-founded. Also because the trials are based on witnesses' testimonies, the length of time between the crime and trial heightens the risk that the witnesses' memories will be unreliable.|$|E
25|$|Rwanda {{continues}} {{to struggle with}} the aftermath of genocide and large-scale forced migration. The International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda (ICTR) and community <b>gacaca</b> courts exist to punish those who planned and carried out the genocide, but the scale of violence forced the Rwandan people into an occasionally uneasy coexistence. The Rwandan government has been generally credited with encouraging economic development and national reconciliation, though {{it has also been}} criticized for oppression of its critics. The crisis had a massive impact on the ecology of the region. The forests of Virunga National Park, home to the endangered mountain gorilla, were badly damaged by the demands for firewood and charcoal made by the refugees. Two years after the arrival of the refugees 105km2 of the park's forest had been affected, of which 63km2 had been razed.|$|E
25|$|The {{government}} began the long-awaited genocide trials, which had an uncertain {{start at the}} end of 1996 and inched forward in 1997. It was not until 1996 that courts finally began trials for genocide cases with the enactment of Organic Law N° 08/96 of 30 on August 30, 1996. This law initiated the prosecution of genocide crimes committed during the genocide and of crimes against humanity from October 1990. This law established the regular domestic courts as the core mechanism for responding to genocide until it was amended in 2001 to include the <b>Gacaca</b> courts. The Organic Law established four categories for those involved in the genocide, specifying the limits of punishment for members of each category. The first category was reserved those who were “planners, organizers, instigators, supervisors and leaders” of the genocide and any who used positions of state authority to promote the genocide. This category also applied to murderers who distinguished themselves {{on the basis of their}} zeal or cruelty, or who engaged in sexual torture. Members of this first category were eligible for the death sentence.|$|E
500|$|Shortly {{after taking}} power, the Rwandan {{government}} began prosecuting crimes committed during the genocide. The International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda, operating under a United Nations mandate, {{was set up}} in Arusha to judge the most senior leaders responsible for the genocide. In addition, the Rwandan government determined to prosecute all suspected perpetrators, including the many ordinary citizens who had taken part in the killings, in order to end the [...] "culture of impunity" [...] that it blamed for the genocide. Between 1994 and 2000, 120,000 suspects were arrested. The prisons were overcrowded and the courts could not process all the cases. By 2006 only 10,000 of those arrested had been tried. The government introduced <b>Gacaca,</b> a village court system based on traditional Rwandan justice. The <b>Gacaca</b> process allowed for faster processing of cases, but lacked many safeguards and principles of international criminal law.|$|E
500|$|Paul Kagame {{took over}} the {{presidency}} from Pasteur Bizimungu in 2000, and began a large-scale national development drive, launching a programme to develop Rwanda as a middle income country by 2020. The country began developing strongly on key indicators, including the human development index, health care and education. Annual growth between 2004 and 2010 averaged [...] per year, the poverty rate reduced from 57% to 45% between 2006 and 2011, and life expectancy rose from 46.6 years in 2000 to 59.7 years in 2015. A period of reconciliation and justice began, {{with the establishment of}} the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda (ICTR) and the reintroduction of <b>Gacaca,</b> a traditional village court system.|$|E
2500|$|In {{response}} to the overwhelming number of potentially culpable individuals and {{the slow pace of}} the traditional judicial system, the government of Rwanda passed Organic Law N° 40/2000 in 2001. This law established <b>Gacaca</b> Courts at all administrative levels of Rwanda and in Kigali. It was mainly created to lessen the burden on normal courts and provide assistance in the justice system to run trials for those already in prison. The least severe cases, according to the terms of Organic Law N° 08/96 of 30, would be handled by these <b>Gacaca</b> Courts. With this law, the government began implementing a participatory justice system, known as <b>Gacaca,</b> in order to address the enormous backlog of cases. The <b>Gacaca</b> court system traditionally dealt with conflicts within communities, but it was adapted to deal with genocide crimes. The following are the objectives of the <b>Gacaca</b> courts: ...|$|E
2500|$|... "One of {{the serious}} {{shortcomings}} of <b>gacaca</b> has been its failure to provide justice to all victims of serious crimes committed in 1994", Bekele said. [...] "By removing RPF crimes from their jurisdiction, the government limited {{the potential of the}} <b>gacaca</b> courts to foster long-term reconciliation in Rwanda." ...|$|E
2500|$|To {{deal with}} this problem, <b>Gacaca</b> courts were installed, the goal of which was to: ...|$|E
2500|$|... "The {{biggest problem}} with <b>gacaca</b> is the crimes we can't discuss. We're told that certain crimes, those killings by the RPF, cannot be {{discussed}} in <b>gacaca</b> even though the families need to talk. We're told to be quiet on these matters. It's a big problem. It's not justice." [...] Said a relative of a victim of crimes by soldiers of the current ruling party.|$|E
2500|$|The <b>Gacaca</b> {{court system}} faced many controversies and challenges; they {{were accused of}} being puppets of the RPF-dominated government. The judges (known as Inyangamugayo, which means [...] "those who detest dishonesty" [...] in Kinyarwanda) who preside over the {{genocide}} trials were elected by the public. After election, the judges received training, but there was concern that the training was not adequate for serious legal questions or complex proceedings. Furthermore, many judges resigned after facing accusations of participating in the genocide; 27.1% of them were so accused. There was also a lack of defense counsel and protections for the accused, who were {{denied the right to}} appeal to ordinary courts. Most trials were open to the public, but there were issues with witness intimidation. The <b>Gacaca</b> courts did not try those responsible for massacres of Hutu civilians committed by members of the RPF, which controlled the <b>Gacaca</b> Court system.|$|E
2500|$|The casual {{format of}} <b>Gacaca</b> {{has led to}} many legal criticisms of the format which include the following: no right to a lawyer, no right to be presumed {{innocent}} until proven otherwise, no right to be informed of charges being brought against you, no right to case/defense preparation time, no {{right to be present}} at one's own trial, no right to confront witnesses, no right against self incrimination, no right against double jeopardy, no right against arbitrary arrest and detention, and furthermore, there is vast evidence of corruption among officials. [...] "You have to give money. <b>Gacaca</b> judges are not paid so they make arrangements to get money from those who are accused," [...] said a man accused of genocide who said he had paid a bribe to <b>Gacaca</b> judges. The lack of legal representation is, in the majority, a result of the genocide itself wherein {{the vast majority of people}} of such professions were casualties. This brings, perhaps, the biggest issue of Gacaca: the lack of legal representation. <b>Gacaca</b> functions using [...] "people of integrity" [...] as judges, lawyers, and the jury. Not only are some of these people perpetrators themselves, but the lack of financial compensation for the position and the lack of training make them susceptible to bribery and to leading unfair trials.|$|E
2500|$|... {{official}} {{site for}} the documentary film series that includes My Neighbor My Killer (Official Selection at Cannes Film Festival), <b>Gacaca</b> Living Together in Rwanda?, In Rwanda We Say... The family that does not speak dies and The Notebooks of Memory by Emmy winner Anne Aghion ...|$|E
2500|$|Senior Human Rights Watch adviser Alison Des Forges {{said the}} lack of legal {{representation}} was a serious concern. [...] "The authorities' view {{is that this is}} a quasi-customary kind of procedure, and there never used to be lawyers, so there's no need for lawyers now. The problem with that is that little is the same except for the name. In this system, there is considerable weight given to the official side. The office of the prosecutor provides considerable assistance to the bench [...] in terms of making its determination, so you no longer have a level playing field." [...] There may, however, be no alternative to the <b>Gacaca</b> trials, she added. [...] "Obviously the problem of delivering justice after the genocide is an overwhelming problem. <b>Gacaca</b> may not be ideal but there is at this point no alternative.... The official explanation I think is that people did not speak openly until the <b>Gacaca</b> process and now many more accusations are surfacing. Also, the concession program, which requires the naming of all those who participated along with the accused , has led to a multiplication of names. [...] "How many of these are well-founded, what is the credibility of the evidence, these are very serious concerns." ...|$|E
2500|$|Because Gacaca's {{original}} purpose {{was not to}} handle crimes {{at the level of}} severity as those committed during the genocide, the punishments associated with determination of guilt often do not fit the crime and require further proximity and intimacy between the perpetrator and victim. Despite its restorative nature, <b>Gacaca</b> is a legal process and with this in mind punishment constitutes a major element of the <b>Gacaca</b> courts. Perpetrators found guilty are sentenced to some form of punishment, {{but it is important to}} note that this rarely takes the form of a jail sentence and instead demands tasks such as the rebuilding of victims’ homes, working in their fields or other variations of community service. Thus, despite Gacaca’s clear punitive and legal elements, in many ways the nature of punishment remains within a restorative framework of repairing the harm done through practical measures.|$|E
