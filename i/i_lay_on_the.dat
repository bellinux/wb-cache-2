2500|$|I {{was brought}} {{straight}} to the blocks. Cell 17, D wing H1 or 2. I was stripped and beaten. The screws who knew me said, 'We are the bosses now. There are no OCs here'. A screw said to me, 'What size {{are you in the}} waist and what size are you for shoes?' I asked him 'What for?' and he told me 'For a uniform'. I said, 'You have got to be joking'. I {{was the only one in}} the H-Blocks. They dragged me into the cell. Davy Long [...] wanted me to compromise. He suggested I wore my own shoes and trousers if I wore a prison shirt. I just laughed. He locked the door. <b>I</b> <b>lay</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> floor all night without mattress, blankets or anything else. The heat was reasonable in all fairness and I slept.|$|E
60|$|Zenobia soon {{saw this}} truth, and gibed me about it, one evening, as Hollingsworth and <b>I</b> <b>lay</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> grass, {{after a hard}} day's work.|$|E
60|$|Toward night I got {{with some}} {{difficulty}} into my house, where <b>I</b> <b>lay</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> ground, as I had {{to do for a}} fortnight, till a bed was prepared for me out of six hundred beds of the ordinary measure.|$|E
50|$|During the {{fighting}} of World War <b>I,</b> Stegna <b>lay</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> {{front line of}} battle from the spring of 1915 to July 1915, {{and much of the}} village was destroyed. Postwar inhabitants rebuilt the village, and, a census taken post-war, in 1921, counted 28 homes and 156 inhabitants, including three Jews.|$|R
60|$|I did {{not hear}} {{anything}} about it for some time afterwards: I remember them coming in at the gate, {{and the sight of}} Polly's face, and the next thing that I recollect, was that <b>I</b> was <b>laying</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> sofa, with Polly crying softly over me, and Dr. Whitmore standing beside me.|$|R
6000|$|Q. But {{is it not}} {{the best}} way, if one can, to mend first?--A. This is just as if a sick man should say, Is it not best {{for me to be}} well before I go to the physician; or as if a wounded man should say, When I am cured <b>I</b> will <b>lay</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> plaster.[14] ...|$|R
60|$|I {{could not}} but acquiesce, for I was dog tired, {{and could not}} have sat up had I tried. So, on her {{renewing}} her promise to call me if she should want anything, <b>I</b> <b>lay</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> sofa, and forgot all about everything.|$|E
6000|$|... "Ah, Colonel!" [...] said Holmes, {{arranging}} his rumpled collar. [...] "'Journeys end in lovers' meetings,' {{as the old}} play says. I don't think I {{have had}} the pleasure of seeing you since you favoured me with those attentions as <b>I</b> <b>lay</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> ledge above the Reichenbach Fall." ...|$|E
60|$|I went in {{the parlor}} and lit the lamp, and {{gradually}} the fury subsided and the ridiculous features of the thing began to suggest themselves. So <b>I</b> <b>lay</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> sofa, with note-book and pencil, and transferred the adventure to our big room in the hotel at Heilbronn, and got it on paper a good deal to my satisfaction.|$|E
5000|$|Filming {{took place}} in Alberta, Canada. The cast and crew had to ride the {{snowmobile}} to the set for two miles every day. Milano commented in a 1997 interview: [...] "We had our costumes padded with heat packs, but it got so cold that <b>I</b> would <b>lay</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> dog (Newman) to keep warm." [...] Shooting completed on May 26, 1996.|$|R
6000|$|Not a word will he disclose, [...] Not {{a word of}} all he knows. [...] <b>I</b> must <b>lay</b> him <b>on</b> <b>the</b> shelf, [...] And make up {{the tale}} myself.|$|R
6000|$|... [Footnote 1: <b>I</b> <b>lay</b> stress here <b>on</b> <b>the</b> 'practical' signification of [...] "Species." [...] Whether a {{physiological}} test between species exist or not, {{it is hardly}} ever applicable by the practical naturalist.] ...|$|R
6000|$|There <b>I</b> <b>lay</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> hard {{stones of}} the quay, feeling very much {{inclined}} to laugh, but looking, no doubt, very blue and ghastly. [...] "He's gone, poor chap!" [...] said some one. [...] "Send for a doctor." [...] "Run, run to Markham." [...] "Quite dead." [...] "Turn him upside down." [...] "Feel his pulse." [...] "Slap him on the back." ...|$|E
60|$|Two {{days after}} that <b>I</b> <b>lay</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> drawing-room sofa in Hoboy Crescent. Mr and Mrs McTougall had gone out. So had the children, the forenoon being fine. Edith had {{remained}} at home, for reasons which {{she did not see}} fit to divulge. She sat beside me with one of her hands in mine. It was all arranged between us by that time.|$|E
60|$|One morning, as <b>I</b> <b>lay</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> mats in {{the house}} plunged in melancholy reverie, and {{regardless}} of everything around me, Toby, who had left me about an hour, returned in haste, and with great glee told me to cheer up and be of good heart, for he believed, from {{what was going on}} among the natives, that there were boats approaching the bay.|$|E
60|$|My ganglions {{were still}} {{vibrating}} as I ran {{the car into}} the stables of Brinkley Court, {{and it was a}} much shaken Bertram who tottered up to his room to change into something loose. Having donned flannels, <b>I</b> <b>lay</b> down <b>on</b> <b>the</b> bed for a bit, and I suppose I must have dozed off, for the next thing I remember is finding Jeeves at my side.|$|R
6000|$|... "But when I {{come out}} of my faint <b>I</b> was <b>laying</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> floor in a drug-store {{saturated}} with aromatic spirits of ammonia. If I'd known that was Reddy Burns, I'd have got down in the gutter and crawled past him instead of handing him one like I did. Why, if I'd ever been in a ring and seen him climbing over the ropes, I'd have been all to the sal-volatile.|$|R
60|$|About {{eleven o'clock}} that night, <b>I</b> <b>lay</b> <b>on</b> one of <b>the</b> lockers {{of the main}} cabin, in a wakeful mood. Nicholas <b>lay</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> other locker, in that {{profound}} slumber which is so characteristic of healthy youth. His regular breathing was the only sound I heard, except the soft footfall of our skipper, as he slowly paced the deck.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{liked them}} the more, {{because it was}} just like her last reading with us, and like that letter. Well, then I {{wondered}} as <b>I</b> <b>lay</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> grass at Groveswood, whether she would have thought it best for me to be reinstated, and I found out that I should have been rather afraid of what you might say when she had talked it over with you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Sir," [...] said Gentleman Jones, {{smoothing}} {{down his}} wristbands again, and addressing me blandly as <b>I</b> <b>lay</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> floor, [...] "I have the honor {{to inform you}} that you have now received your first lesson in politeness. Always be civil to those who are civil to you. The little matter of the caricature we will settle on a future occasion. I wish you good-evening." ...|$|E
6000|$|Thank Heaven, yes! The {{man turned}} and heard me. I {{could see him}} start and look sharply in the {{direction}} where <b>I</b> <b>lay</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> ledge. By the movement of his face I felt sure he observed me. He saw me and jumped back. He recognized the deadly peril in which I lay. [...] "Help! help!" [...] I shouted with terrific energy. [...] "Quick! quick! a rope! The fire is almost upon me!" ...|$|E
60|$|I am rather short-sighted, but {{science has}} its resources. Two {{or three days}} after my {{encounter}} with this very shy sportsman, I went again to Loch Nan. But this time I took with me a strong field-glass. As I neared {{the crest of the}} low heathery slope immediately above the loch, whence the water first comes into view, <b>I</b> <b>lay</b> down <b>on</b> <b>the</b> ground and crawled like a deer-stalker to the skyline.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes. They sprang upon {{me in an}} instant; but <b>I</b> <b>lay</b> flat <b>on</b> <b>the</b> ground, so I wouldn't get my legs {{broken by}} the great weight of the beasts, and {{when they tried to}} bite me I laughed at them and jeered them until they were frantic with rage, for they nearly broke their teeth on my hard glass. So, after a time, they {{discovered}} they could not hurt me, and went away. It was great fun." ...|$|R
60|$|As dusk fell, {{and while}} the geese flew low gabbling confidentially, and the ducks whistled by {{overhead}} in swift unerring flight, Charles and <b>I</b> <b>lay</b> down <b>on</b> <b>the</b> hay beside the horses, feeling ourselves to be, in some way, partners with God in this new world. I went to sleep hearing the horses munching their grain in the neighboring stalls, entirely contented with my day and confident of the morrow. All questions were answered, all doubts stilled.|$|R
60|$|For {{a day or}} two, <b>I</b> <b>lay</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> sofa, or on the floor,--anywhere, {{according}} as I {{happened to}} sink down,--with a heavy head and aching limbs, and no purpose, and no power. Then there came, one night which appeared of great duration, and which teemed with anxiety and horror; and when in the morning I tried to sit up in my bed and think of it, I found I could not do so.|$|E
6000|$|Next morning, as <b>I</b> <b>lay</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> {{sofa in the}} verandah, humming and idling, with Kea still {{stitching}} away at {{the very}} last touches on her wedding garments beside me, I saw by a sudden glitter in my mirror that Frank was anxious to heliograph me a message. Pulling the cord that moved my looking-glass, I flashed back [...] "Well?" [...] Frank answered by signal, [...] "Big ship off Hilo. Gunboat apparently. Flying British colours. A party is landing." ...|$|E
6000|$|Wrapped in dreams, <b>I</b> <b>lay</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> {{night in}} {{question}} tranquilly sleeping, [...] but gradually roused to {{a perception that}} discordant sounds disturbed [...] the serenity of my slumber. Loth to stir, I still dozed on, the [...] sounds, however, becoming, as it seemed, more determined to make [...] themselves heard; and I awoke to the consciousness that they proceeded [...] from a belt of adjacent jungle, and resembled the noise that would be [...] produced by some person felling timber.|$|E
60|$|I {{gazed at}} Kalaua in the blankest astonishment. Could it really be he who had stood so stolidly {{by in the}} feather mask and devoted my head with awful rites to the nether gods while <b>I</b> <b>lay</b> {{helpless}} <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Floor of the Hawaiians? My confidence in his identity began distinctly to waver. After all, I hadn't seen the features of that grim heathen priest while <b>I</b> <b>lay</b> at the bottom. Perhaps I was mistaken. He was Kea's uncle. For Kea's sake, I ardently hoped so.|$|R
40|$|<b>I</b> <b>lay</b> down <b>on</b> <b>the</b> {{beach and}} looked dreamily away {{to where the}} deep blue of the sky blended to meet the blue-green of the ocean. The sun shone brightly <b>on</b> <b>the</b> golden sand about me while the brightly colored sea shells came and went with the ocean waves. The whole shore seemed secluded, but by noon it would be jammed with people bathing or basking in the sun. The shore would be a mass of red, yellow, blue, orange, green, and purple umbrella...|$|R
60|$|Another of {{the ladies}} tried a similar couch; but as boxes of equal height could not be found, her {{position}} was not enviable. The third lady preferred an uneasy posture among the ribs and cordage of the boat, and <b>I</b> <b>lay</b> down <b>on</b> <b>the</b> paving-stones of the quay, having found from experience that, {{in the matter of}} beds, flatness is the most indispensable of qualities, while hardness is not so awful as one might suppose. Where my comrade the collegian went to I know not.|$|R
60|$|Long {{after the}} camp {{had gone to}} bed, <b>I</b> <b>lay</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> pine-needles above the brook, {{shielded}} from the wind by {{a break in the}} slope, and thought of the strange happenings of that day. Presently the waning moon climbed reluctantly from the waters, and the stream became mottled, black and white, the trees tall blurs. The lake rose and fell with a mighty rhythm, and the little brook hurried madly over the stones to join it. One thought chased another from my brain.|$|E
60|$|That was {{the fairy}} tale of my childhood. Far into the night <b>I</b> <b>lay</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> dewy grass {{listening}} to Mr. Boone's talk. It did not at first flow in a steady stream, for {{he was not a}} garrulous man, but my father's questions presently fired his enthusiasm. I recall but little of it, being so small a lad, but I crept closer and closer until I could touch this superior being who had been beyond the Wall. Marco Polo was no greater wonder to the Venetians than Boone to me.|$|E
6000|$|... "I was {{scarcely}} in my senses, the yells and shots ringing dimly in my ears, when I saw an Indian before me, busied {{over the body}} of the Frenchman I had just shot, but glancing towards me as <b>I</b> <b>lay</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> ground bleeding. He first rifled the Frenchman, tearing open his coat, and feeling in his pockets: he then scalped him, and with his bleeding knife in his mouth advanced towards me. I saw him coming as through a film, as in a dream--I was powerless to move, or to resist him.|$|E
60|$|As soon, however, as the {{sun came}} out, <b>I</b> <b>lay</b> down <b>on</b> <b>the</b> top of that rock to dry myself. The comfort of the {{sunshine}} is a thing I cannot tell. It set me thinking hopefully of my deliverance, of which I had begun to despair; and I scanned {{the sea and the}} Ross with a fresh interest. <b>On</b> <b>the</b> south of my rock, a part of the island jutted out and hid the open ocean, so that a boat could thus come quite near me upon that side, and I be none the wiser.|$|R
6000|$|... "The {{night that}} I passed {{in it was}} an uncomfortable night. I got in late and was shown to my room <b>on</b> <b>the</b> ground floor by an apologetic night-clerk with a tallow candle, which he considerately left with me. I was worn out by two days and a night of hard railway travel and had not entirely {{recovered}} from a gunshot wound in the head, received in an altercation. Rather than look for better quarters <b>I</b> <b>lay</b> down <b>on</b> <b>the</b> mattress without removing my clothing and fell asleep.|$|R
60|$|We {{had hoped}} {{during the course}} of that day to procure assistance, but we were unsuccessful. We passed a number of fishermen's huts, but none of the men would consent to embark with us. At last, late that night, we reached a small farm about two-thirds of the way up the fjord, where we succeeded in {{procuring}} another large boat with a crew of five men. Here, also, we obtained a cup of coffee; and while we were awaiting the arrival of <b>the</b> boat <b>I</b> <b>lay</b> down <b>on</b> <b>the</b> pier and had a short nap.|$|R
