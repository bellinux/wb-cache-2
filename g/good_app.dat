At the time, the testing was limited to a [...] "small number of users in Australia and Thailand", with the ad format being swipe-based carousel ads. In July, the company {{announced that}} they were expanding the testing to a global audience. Stan Chudnovsky, head of Messenger, told VentureBeat that [...] "We’ll start slow ... When the average user can be sure to see them we truly don’t know because we’re just going to be very data-driven and user feedback-driven on making that decision". Facebook told TechCrunch that the advertisements' placement in the inbox depends on factors such as thread count, phone screen size, and pixel density. In a TechCrunch editorial by Devin Coldewey, he described the ads as [...] "huge" [...] in the space they occupy, [...] "intolerable" [...] in the way they appear in the user interface, and [...] "irrelevant" [...] {{due to the lack of}} context.

40|$|In the Google Play store, an {{introduction}} page {{is associated with}} every mobile application (app) for users to acquire its details, including screenshots, description, reviews, etc. However, it remains a challenge to identify what items influence users most when downloading an app. To explore users' perspective, we conduct a survey to inquire about this question. The results of survey suggest that the participants pay most attention to the app description which gives users a quick overview of the app. Although there exist some guidelines about {{how to write a}} <b>good</b> <b>app</b> description to attract more downloads, it is hard to define a high quality app description. Meanwhile, there is no tool to evaluate the quality of app description. In this paper, we employ the method of crowdsourcing to extract the attributes that affect the app descriptions' quality. First, we download some app descriptions from Google Play, then invite some participants to rate their quality with the score from one (very poor) to five (very good). The participants are also requested to explain every score's reasons. By analyzing the reasons, we extract the attributes that the participants consider important during evaluating the quality of app descriptions. Finally, we train the supervised learning models on a sample of 100 app descriptions. In our experiments, the support vector machine model obtains up to 62 % accuracy. In addition, we find that the permission, the number of paragraphs and the average number of words in one feature play key roles in defining a <b>good</b> <b>app</b> description.

40|$|Abstract—Smartphone {{privacy and}} {{security}} work has focused mostly on malicious apps. We {{take a different}} angle by ques-tioning whether <b>good</b> <b>apps</b> suffer {{from a lack of}} judgment and interact with “bad ” websites. We use the term bad websites to refer to entities that engage in dangerous or annoying activities that range from distributing malware, to phishing and overly aggressive ad spamming. The focus of our work is this relatively neglected aspect of security: “Whom does an app talk to? ” In this paper, we design and implement AURA, a framework for identifying the hosts that an app talks to and evaluating the risks this communication entails. AURA makes use of both static and dynamic analysis. We studied 13, 500 popular free Android apps that connect to 254, 022 URLs and 1, 260 malicious Android apps that connect to 19, 510 URLs. Our main contribution is showing that <b>good</b> <b>apps</b> pose security risks as they contact at least one website that: (a) distributes malware (8. 8 % of apps), (b) are in a blacklist (15 % of apps) based on the classification by VirusTotal and Web of Trust. Our work can raise awareness that even <b>good</b> <b>apps</b> need to be carefully evaluated, especially as people become more concerned about smartphone security and privacy. I...|$|R

40|$|The study aims to {{investigate}} what the iPad in SFI education {{means for the}} individual {{when it comes to}} becoming literate from having been illiterate. The focus of the study is on reading and writing in combination with individual motivation and opinions on iPad as a teaching tool. The study is based on interviews of three illiterate participants of sfi. The interviews give an idea of the individuals´ attitudes to the iPad and whether they think they learn to read and write with the iPad. The study also discusses what the participants think they cannot learn with the iPad. The study also includes two interviews with teachers, which aims to broaden and nuance pictures of how the iPad works in the classroom. Even the teachers' perceptions of the iPad as a teaching tool are examined. In addition, classroom observations are made to further ensure the participants' opinions, thoughts and work with the iPad. The results show that all three participants believe that they learn to read and write more quickly with the iPad than without. All three have great motivation to use the iPad, but have different endurance of how long they can work with it. All three consider, however, iPad as only a tool and highlight communication with the teacher as more important, because then they can ask, be given explanations and know why they make certain errors. The teachers have different approaches and different perceptions of students' use, and also what they themselves use the iPad for. However, they believe the iPad to be a good teaching tool that allows for individualization. The observations confirmed what the participants expressed. The study gives reason to argue for many benefits in term of iPad in the classroom. A <b>good</b> <b>app</b> promotes learning and the special needs of an illiterate, both in terms of letters, words, pictures and symbols. Even good pronunciation is promoted by the use of iPad as critical information can be given repeatedly, an indefinite number of times any time during use...|$|E
40|$|Background: Gamification {{techniques}} are showing promise in promoting healthy behaviours and delivering health promotion advice, however, {{their use in}} Mobile-Health is relatively new. Gamification involves using ‘gaming’ elements such as badges, leader boards, health-related challenges, rewards, ability to ‘level up’ and use of avatars to motivate and engage people to change health behavior. Gamification techniques may also overlap with validated health behaviour change techniques (BCTs), however, few apps appear to apply the techniques systematically or to define the BCTs they include. Aim: We aimed a) to assess the number apps that incorporate gamification to modify health behaviors, b) to examine the BCT repertoire and combinations used in these apps c) to consider associations with user satisfaction. Methods: English-language health apps that contain gamification techniques were identified through a systematic search of the official Apple and Google Play store and the NHS health apps library. Top rated free and paid Medical, Health & Wellness, Health & Fitness apps as defined by Apple and Google Play stores were searched. Apps were coded for BCTs according to the Michie et al. taxonomy. The taxonomy comprises 16 categories and 93 individual BCTs. BCT coding was conducted by two trained researchers (EE, JL) who scored independently and then cross-checked for discrepancies. BCT numbers, user ratings and app pricing were compared. We explored the association between number of BCTs per app, user and NHS libraries’ ratings and price. We also investigated, which of the 16 BCT categories and the individual 93 BCTs and their combinations were most commonly used. Results: 1, 680 Medical, Health & Wellness or Health & Fitness Apps were reviewed and seventy containing gamification techniques were identified. The mean number of BCTs used was 12. 5 (range 1 - 24). There was no correlation between number of BCTs, customer ratings, NHS library app rating or pricing. Commonly used BCT categories were: feedback & monitoring, reward & threat, goals & planning and comparison of behaviour. Commonly used individual BCTs were: self-monitoring of behaviour, non-specific reward, social support unspecified and non-specific incentive. Common combinations of BCTs were a) goal setting, self-monitoring and focus on past success b) goal setting, self-monitoring, non-specific reward and non-specific incentive. Only four apps {{were included in the}} NHS library. Conclusion: Our systematic review of smartphone health apps from two major providers suggests that gamification in Mobile-Health is relatively underused and there was wide variation in the use of BCTs. Whilst our data suggest that app designers are making some use of BCTs, as all apps contained at least one technique, many health apps underutilize them thus limiting the potential to modify health behaviour. In addition, {{there appears to be no}} correlation between what users rate as a <b>good</b> <b>app</b> (a possible proxy for the app having health benefits), and the app’s content and potential ability to modify health behaviour. We suggest that app designers should work collaboratively with public health practitioners, health psychologists and with users to ensure that apps incorporate appropriate BCTs together with gamification in order to modify health behavior more effectively, to enhance user retention and to increase user enjoyment/ratings. Further research and clinical evaluation is needed for health care apps to evaluate their effectiveness in modifying actual health behavior and clinical outcomes. There is also a need for regulation of Health Care apps to ensure patients are given access to apps, which are safe and have proven benefit to health. Greater use of gamification and behavior change techniques could provide a potentially cost effective platform for health behaviour change and health promotion and have enormous Public Health impact...|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study has been to examine how {{teachers}} use and reflect on digital tools in mathematics education and what opportunities and obstacles they feel they come across when it comes to using the digital tools at their disposal. To answer this I asked myself the following questions: How do teachers use digital tools in mathematics education? In what ways do the teachers reflect upon the use of digital tools in mathematics education? What kind of opportunities and obstacles do the teachers come across when using digital tools in mathematics education? The study is based on a qualitative method with five classroom observations and five interviews with the class teachers. My study are based on Glover, Miller, Aviers and Doors idea of different concept of interactivity and Glover and Millers idea of different attitudes towards technology. My conclusion is that all teachers are using digital tools to some form of drill training in mathematics. All teachers except teacher 2 also use digital tools to immerse in mathematics. Teacher 4 use digital tools to develop students' mathematical communication. Something that all teachers see as a possibility with the digital tools is an easy way to individualize teaching. Further, teachers 3, 4 and 5 believes that <b>good</b> <b>apps</b> enable students, teachers and parents to take part of the student's progression in an easy way. All teachers, except teacher 3 believe that technical problems that can occur and are an obstacle {{when it comes to the}} use of digital tools in mathematics education. Teachers 2 and 5 also believe that access, or rather lack of access, to digital tools can be an obstacle in teaching mathematics. Teacher 1, 2 and 5 also addresses the aspect of time as an obstacle when using digital tools, both the time it takes to find apps or to start a computer. Something that all teachers agree upon is that to have all mathematics teaching based on digital tools wouldn’t be suitable because it can be difficult to get access to a pupils’ knowledge that way. The best, according to the teachers in this study, would be to complement mathematics teaching with other teaching methods as well. Despite their different views on the opportunities and obstacles, and reflections on digital tools all teachers are positive about using digital tools in mathematics education, although many of the teachers point out technical shortages which in most cases is due to insufficient IT-education...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{the present}} study was to find out what qualities {{teachers}} look for in apps for reading development, what qualities researchers think an app should possess, and whether the apps that teachers use have these qualities. To achieve this purpose, teachers in grades 1 – 3 were asked to complete a questionnaire and three educational apps were analysed with the aid of questions based on Sjödén’s (2015) dissertation “What makes good educational software?” The questions were used to study the contexts representation, interaction and social positioning. The results of the study showed that the three most desirable qualities in an educational app are that it should motivate pupils, that it should be linked to the learning goals, and that it should give pupils an opportunity to work independently. The analysis showed that the three most frequently used apps had the qualities that the teachers considered most significant and also the qualities that research has found essential in an educational app. The apps mostly elicited positive responses to the analysis questions, but there were defects in the concretizing potential of the apps, and none of them enabled social interaction through the assumption of character roles. The conclusions show that, despite the qualities of the apps, the teacher is indispensable in the teaching of reading with apps, and to choose a <b>good</b> educational <b>app</b> teachers should use the analysis in the study as a foundation but also integrate their own experience of teaching. ...|$|R
50|$|Battery {{consumption}} of the phones is a factor that {{must be taken into}} account when deploying beacon enabled apps. A recent report has shown thatolder phones tend to draw more battery in the vicinity of iBeacons, while the newer phones can be more efficient in the same environment. In addition to the time spent by the phone scanning, number of scans and number of beacons in the vicinity are also significant factors for battery drain, as pointed out by the Aislelabs report. In a follow up report, Aislelabs found a drastic improvement in battery consumption for iPhone5S, iPhone 5C versus the older model iPhone 4S.At 10 surrounding iBeacons, iPhone 4S can consume up to 11% of battery per hour whereas iPhone5S consumes a little less than 5% battery per hour.

This study addresses the present gap in the literature regarding the acceptance of mobile shopping applications for fashion <b>goods</b> (m-shopping fashion <b>apps),</b> by investigating the factors that affect users’ behavioral intention to use m-shopping fashion apps in Sweden. The {{purpose of this study is}} to identify the factors that affect the behavioral intention to use m-shopping fashion apps from a consumer perspective, where the consumers are the users of m-shopping fashion apps. The research model was proposed thought a literature review and incorporated the trust factor into the Consumer Acceptance and Use of Information Technology model (UTAUT 2) of Venkatesh, Thong and Xu (2012), as one of the in total eight proposed predictors of users’ behavioral intention to use mobile shopping fashion apps. A questionnaire was conducted to collect primary data and the study sample consisted of 110 respondents. Multiple linear regressions was applied to test the proposed hypotheses. The results reveal that Performance Expectancy, Habit, Facilitating Conditions and Hedonic Motivation affect the users’ behavioral intention to use m-shopping fashion apps. On a different note, Effort Expectancy, Social Influence, Price Value and Trust do not significantly affect the behavioral intention to use m- shopping fashion apps. These findings provide several managerial implications, namely  the ways in which behavioral intention to use m-shopping fashion apps is needed to be taken into consideration in order to increase mobile shopping fashion apps’ usage.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Given {{the global}} {{prevalence}} of insufficient physical activity (PA), effective interventions that attenuate age-related decline in PA levels are needed. Mobile phone interventions that positively affect health (mHealth) show promise; however, {{their impact on}} PA levels and fitness in young people is unclear and {{little is known about}} what makes a <b>good</b> mHealth <b>app.</b> OBJECTIVE: The aim was {{to determine the effects of}} two commercially available smartphone apps (Zombies, Run and Get Running) on cardiorespiratory fitness and PA levels in insufficiently active healthy young people. A second aim was to identify the features of the app design that may contribute to improved fitness and PA levels. METHODS: Apps for IMproving FITness (AIMFIT) was a 3 -arm, parallel, randomized controlled trial conducted in Auckland, New Zealand. Participants were recruited through advertisements in electronic mailing lists, local newspapers, flyers posted in community locations, and presentations at schools. Eligible young people aged 14 - 17 years were allocated at random to 1 of 3 conditions: (1) use of an immersive app (Zombies, Run), (2) use of a nonimmersive app (Get Running), or (3) usual behavior (control). Both smartphone apps consisted of a fully automated 8 -week training program designed to improve fitness and ability to run 5 km; however, the immersive app featured a game-themed design and narrative. Intention-to-treat analysis was performed using data collected face-to-face at baseline and 8 weeks, and all regression models were adjusted for baseline outcome value and gender. The primary outcome was cardiorespiratory fitness, objectively assessed as time to complete the 1 -mile run/walk test at 8 weeks. Secondary outcomes were PA levels (accelerometry and self-reported), enjoyment, psychological need satisfaction, self-efficacy, and acceptability and usability of the apps. RESULTS: A total of 51 participants were randomized to the immersive app intervention (n= 17), nonimmersive app intervention (n= 16), or the control group (n= 18). The mean age of participants was 15. 7 (SD 1. 2) years; participants were mostly NZ Europeans (61 %, 31 / 51) and 57 % (29 / 51) were female. Overall retention rate was 96 % (49 / 51). There was no significant intervention effect on the primary outcome using either of the apps. Compared to the control, time to complete the fitness test was - 28. 4 seconds shorter (95 % CI - 66. 5 to 9. 82, P=. 20) for the immersive app group and - 24. 7 seconds (95 % CI - 63. 5 to 14. 2, P=. 32) for the nonimmersive app group. No significant intervention effects were found for secondary outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: Although apps have the ability to increase reach at a low cost, our pragmatic approach using readily available commercial apps as a stand-alone instrument did not have a significant effect on fitness. However, interest in future use of PA apps is promising and highlights a potentially important role of these tools in a multifaceted approach to increase fitness, promote PA, and consequently reduce the adverse health outcomes associated with insufficient activity...|$|R
