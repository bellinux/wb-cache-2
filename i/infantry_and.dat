5|$|Appian {{claims that}} Lucullus had {{embarked}} from Rome {{with only a}} single legion; upon entering Anatolia to make war against Mithridates, he added four more legions to his army. The overall size of this force consisted of 30,000 <b>infantry</b> <b>and</b> 1,600 cavalry. Following Mithridates' retreat to Armenia, Appian estimates Lucullus' invading force to be only two legions and 500 horsemen, although it is highly improbable {{that he would have}} undertaken the invasion of Armenia with such a small army. Historian Adrian Sherwin-White places the size of Lucullus' force to 12,000 seasoned legionaries (composed of three legions), and 4,000 provincial cavalry and light infantry. The Roman army was further bolstered by several thousand allied Gallic, Thracian, and Bithynian <b>infantry</b> <b>and</b> cavalry.|$|E

5000|$|In the game, Russia {{starts out}} with 36 <b>infantries</b> <b>and</b> 13 artilleries after setup to {{represent}} the inferiority of its soldiers, Germany has 63 <b>infantries</b> <b>and</b> 23 artilleries, and Austria-Hungary begins with 48 <b>infantries</b> <b>and</b> 12 artilleries.

However, in actuality, in 1914, Russia had 5,971,000 soldiers, Germany had 4,500,000, and Austria-Hungary had 3,000,000. [...] In the game, if the respective sides were allocated proportional numbers of soldiers as to real life, Russia would be at a disadvantage against the Central Powers and ruin {{the balance of the}} game for the two sides. The game had to be playable and fun, and as a result was made to be more balanced that the situation was in history.|$|R

In the afternoon, Napoleon personally ordered the house to be shelled to set it on fire, resulting in the destruction of all but the chapel. Du Plat's brigade of the King's German Legion was brought forward to defend the hollow way, which they had to do without senior officers. Eventually they were relieved by the 71st Highlanders, a British infantry regiment.

The Peshwa headquarters was in Pune, which was the southernmost location amongst the other Maratha powers. Holkar had the second largest cavalry, amounting to 20,000, and an infantry force of 8,000. His guns totaled to 107 guns. Shinde and Bhonsle had similar numbers of cavalry and infantry, with each having 15,000 and 16,000 cavalry, respectively. Shinde had 16,000 <b>infantry</b> <b>and</b> Bhonsle, 18,000. Shinde had the larger share of guns amounting to 140 whereas Bhonsle had 85.

5|$|His opponents {{learned from}} Napoleon's innovations. The {{increased}} importance of artillery after 1807 stemmed from his {{creation of a}} highly mobile artillery force, the growth in artillery numbers, and changes in artillery practices. As {{a result of these}} factors, Napoleon, rather than relying on infantry to wear away the enemy's defenses, now could use massed artillery as a spearhead to pound a break in the enemy's line that was then exploited by supporting <b>infantry</b> <b>and</b> cavalry. McConachy rejects the alternative theory that growing reliance on artillery by the French army beginning in 1807 was an outgrowth of the declining quality of the French <b>infantry</b> <b>and,</b> later, France's inferiority in cavalry numbers. Weapons and other kinds of military technology remained static through the Revolutionary and Napoleonic eras, but 18th-century operational mobility underwent change.|$|E
