50|$|The {{land for}} Bartram Trail High School was {{purchased}} in January 1999 and was constructed by Arcadis. The Bartram Trail High School campus takes up {{one hundred and}} twenty acres of land and the school building takes up 190000 sq ft. The school building is a two-story octagon with an open-air courtyard in the center. The cafeteria and media center are located within the main building, while the gymnasium and auditorium with a stage are attached on the south and north sides, respectively. The outside of the campus has walkways, student, faculty and visitor parking, a parent <b>drop-off</b> <b>section,</b> a bus loop, a football and track stadium, a baseball and softball field, tennis courts, general-use play fields, a stormwater treatment facility, water and sewer utilities and a wetland mitigation area.|$|E
30|$|The {{previous}} studies are mainly focused on build and <b>drop-off</b> wellbore <b>sections</b> in the vertical inclination plane. However, previous bucking models {{may not be}} applicable for three-dimensional wellbores of which both the inclination and azimuth angles change simultaneously in complex-structure wells. Therefore, a tubular string buckling model for arbitrary wellbores is needed.|$|R
50|$|Cycling There {{are many}} cycles routes in the Lochgilphead area to cater for every level, from the Crinan Canal Towpath to the {{purpose-built}} Fire Tower Mountain Bike Trail,with a long, hard forestry climb linking {{on to some}} fantastic single track which includes berms, jumps, <b>drop-offs</b> and a <b>section</b> of north shore (raised wooden platform).|$|R
50|$|The Jiankou section {{has never}} been {{restored}} since its construction, with some sections having fallen into disrepair. This, along with its location along a mountain ridge bordered by jagged cliffs and steep <b>drop-offs,</b> makes this <b>section</b> potentially dangerous to climb, {{while at the same}} time a popular place for adventurous and experienced hikers and photographers. The section is more easily reached from villages like Xizhazi (西栅子) and Jiushuikeng (旧水坑) at the north side of the wall, locally known as Hou Jiankou (后箭扣), than from the south, called Qian Jiankou (前箭扣). The climb from the north goes up just over 100 meters in about a one kilometer hike, whereas from the south the climb is about 450 meters up over a horizontal distance of also one kilometer.|$|R
40|$|Past {{earthquakes}} {{have demonstrated}} the vulnerability of deck bridges, which {{are the most common}} type in elevated roads. Especially over-loading of piers and <b>drop-off</b> of <b>sections</b> are a continuing concern. Seismic Control concepts, when correctly understood and applied, can provide the necessary physical force limits and reduced displacements even under loading beyond the design limit. The concept of choice here is the Hysteretic Device System since deck bridges usually provide a natural seismic link between piers and deck. To study the performance and robustness of this concept, shaking table tests were performed at IZIIS, Skopje during the NATO-SfP project ISUbridge on a model deck bridge using controllable friction devices UHYDE-fbr to simulate the behavior of different passive devices including device failure. The tests showed that a stiff-ductile device in the link not only protects the piers from over-load, but also provides superior performance compared to viscous or soft base-isolation devices. Failure of such a device further reduced the demand on the piers but did not lead to excessive deck displacements or damage, thus confirming considerable seismic robustness for the HDS concept. This corroborates observations on the Bolu viaduct during the Kocaeli event. Unfortunately, HDS is often confused with Base- Isolation, which leads to the application of BI-devices, like LRBs and thus a reduction in performance and robustness. This is even more true for viscous devices, which are favored today...|$|R
