40|$|A {{method to}} semiquantify urinary {{oligosaccharides}} from patients suffering from oligosaccharidurias is presented. 1 -Phenyl- 3 -methyl- 5 -pyrazolone {{has been used}} to derivatize urinary oligosaccharides prior to analysis by electrospray ionization-tandem mass spectrometry (ESI-MS/MS). Disease-specific oligosaccharides were identified for several oligosaccharidurias, including GM 1 gangliosidosis, GM 2 gangliosidosis, sialic acid storage disease, sialidase/neuraminidase deficiency, galactosialidosis, I-cell disease, fucosidosis, Pompe and <b>Gaucher</b> <b>diseases,</b> and alpha-mannosidosis. The oligosaccharides were referenced against the internal standard, methyl lactose, to produce ratios for comparison with control samples. Elevations in specific urinary oligosaccharides were indicative of lysosomal disease and the defective catabolic enzyme. This method has been adapted to enable assay of large sample numbers and could readily be extended to other oligosaccharidurias and to monitor oligosaccharide levels in patients receiving treatment. It also has immediate potential for incorporation into a newborn screening program...|$|R
40|$|Lysosomes are acidic {{cytoplasmic organelles}} that {{are present in}} all {{nucleated}} mammalian cells and {{are involved in a}} variety of cellular processes including repair of the plasma membrane, defense against pathogens, cholesterol homeostasis, bone remodeling, metabolism, apoptosis and cell signaling. Defects in lysosomal enzyme activity have been associated with a variety of neurological diseases including Parkinson's Disease, Lysosomal Storage Diseases, Alzheimer's disease and Huntington's disease. Fluorogenic lysosomal staining probes were synthesized for labeling lysosomes and other acidic organelles in a live-cell format and were shown to be capable of monitoring lysosomal metabolic activity. The new targeted substrates were prepared from fluorescent dyes having a low pKa value for optimum fluorescence at the lower physiological pH found in lysosomes. They were modified to contain targeting groups to direct their accumulation in lysosomes as well as enzyme-cleavable functions for monitoring specific enzyme activities using a live-cell staining format. Application to the staining of cells derived from blood and skin samples of patients with Metachromatic Leukodystrophy, Krabbe and <b>Gaucher</b> <b>Diseases</b> as well as healthy human fibroblast and leukocyte control cells exhibited localization to the lysosome when compared with known lysosomal stain LysoTracker® Red DND- 99 as well as with anti-LAMP 1 Antibody staining. When cell metabolism was inhibited with chloroquine, staining with an esterase substrate was reduced, demonstrating that the substrates can be used to measure cell metabolism. When applied to diseased cells, the intensity of staining was reflective of lysosomal enzyme levels found in diseased cells. Substrates specific to the enzyme deficiencies in <b>Gaucher</b> or Krabbe <b>disease</b> patient cell lines exhibited reduced staining compared to that in non-diseased cells. The new lysosome-targeted fluorogenic substrates should be useful for research, diagnostics and monitoring the effect of secondary therapeutic agents on lysosomal enzyme activity in drug development for the lysosomal storage disorders and allied diseases...|$|R
40|$|<b>Gaucher</b> s <b>disease</b> is an {{autosomal}} recessive lysosomal storage disease {{characterized by the}} specific deficiency of glucocerebrosidase that leads to accumulation of insoluble glucocerebroside in the reticuloendothelial system, particularly the bone marrow, liver, spleen and lymph nodes. Direct scintigraphic visualization of lipid deposits in <b>Gaucher</b> s <b>disease</b> has recently been described, based {{on the use of}} the lipid-soluble xenon- 133. We report here {{on the use of the}} lipophilic cationic complex technetium- 99 m sestamibi (99 mTc-MIBI), employed as an indicator of increased cellular density and metabolic activity, to evaluate Gaucher cell infiltrates in the bone marrow; 99 mTc-hexametazime (99 mTc-HMPAO) was also employed, as a pure indicator of lipidic infiltration in the bone marrow. A 67 -year-old patient with known type 1 <b>Gaucher</b> s <b>disease</b> presented with a painful left hip and knee and difficulty in gait subsequent to traumatic fracture of the left femoral neck that had required implant of a fixation screw-plaque. Bone scan with 99 mTc-methylene diphosphonate revealed reduced uptake at the distal metaphyseal-epiphyseal femoral region. In addition, whole-body maps and spot-view acquisitions of the thighs and legs were recorded at both 30 min and 2. 5 h after the injection of 99 mTc-MIBI: the scintigraphic pattern clearly showed increased uptake at several sites involved by Gaucher deposits in the bone marrow (both knees, with variable intensity in different areas), matching the bone changes detected by conventional x-ray. The target to non-target ratios slowly decreased with time, from an average value of 2. 25 in the early scan to an average value of 2 in the delayed scan. The lipid-soluble agent 99 mTc-HMPAO exhibited a superimposable scintigraphic pattern of accumulation at the involved sites, though with lower target to non-target ratios (1. 27 - 1. 48). The results obtained in this patient suggest a potential role of 99 mTc-MIBI in the scintigraphic evaluation of Gaucher s lipid deposits in the bone marrow. If the results are confirmed in other patients, this radiopharmaceutical would offer clear advantages over 133 Xe because of its wider availability and greater practicality (i. v. administration of 99 mTc-MIBI versus inhalation of 133 Xe, and use of a single gamma camera instead of two as with 133 Xe) ...|$|R

30|$|In 2009, US$ 884 {{million was}} spent on {{specialised}} drugs, which is four times the amount (US$ 198 million) spent in 2003 (Valadares 2009). In 2013, US$ 1.61 billion was spent, and in 2014, preliminary data were provided by the Brazilian Ministry of Health showing US$ 1.5 billion {{for the purchase of}} SM (Brazil Ministry Health, 2014). Therefore, to reduce high costs associated with imported pharmaceutical products, the Brazilian government released the Technological Innovation Law, which stimulates the development of new biotechnological companies for the production of national biopharmaceuticals (Brazil Ministry Health 2008; de Castro 2014). The Technological Innovation Law is part of a strategic plan to strengthen the pharmaceutical industry, due the increased demand for health public services and consumption (medicines, diagnostics kits, vaccines, etc.). The strategy aimed to replace the imported drugs that were causing {{a significant impact on the}} economy and encourage scientific training and public–private partnerships (Victora et al. 2011; Silveira 2012; Reddy 2013; Sundfeld and Souza 2013). In 2012, 34 public–private partnerships were developed to produce several molecules with therapeutic activity, such as anti-retroviral and anti-asthmatic drugs and drugs used to treat rheumatoid arthritis and Crohn and <b>Gaucher</b> <b>diseases,</b> among others (Paiva 2012). In 2013, 63 public-private partnerships were developed, resulting in the production of 63 drugs, vaccines and rapid diagnostic tests, involving 16 public and 41 private laboratories, with an estimated US$ 2.8 billion per year in budget savings (Oliveira 2013). Alongside Brazil, other countries, such as South Korea and India, also used national biosimilar production as an alternative to increase the access of high-cost biopharmaceuticals to the population (IMS 2011) through similar biotechnology. Furthermore, the large accumulation of expired patents related to biopharmaceutical products led to the development of a second generation of drugs: biosimilars (Niederwieser and Schmitz 2010; Utzig et al. 2010). The substitution of classic drugs with biosimilars depends on the criteria established by each country (Rosenberg et al. 2010).|$|R

2500|$|In {{patients}} with a clinical suspicion for Tay–Sachs disease, with any age of onset, the initial testing involves an enzyme assay to measure the activity of hexosaminidase in serum, fibroblasts, or leukocytes. [...] Total hexosaminidase enzyme activity is decreased in individuals with Tay-Sachs as is the percentage of hexosaminidase A. [...] After confirmation of decreased enzyme activity in an individual, confirmation by molecular analysis can be pursued.

40|$|Lysosomal storage {{diseases}} (LSDs) are a {{group of}} genetic disorders due to defects in any aspect of lysosomal biology. During the past two decades, different approaches have been introduced {{for the treatment of}} these conditions. Among them, enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) represented a major advance and is used successfully in the treatment of some of these disorders. However, ERT has limitations such as insufficient biodistribution of recombinant enzymes and high costs. An emerging strategy for the treatment of LSDs is pharmacological chaperone therapy (PCT), based on the use of chaperone molecules that assist the folding of mutated enzymes and improve their stability and lysosomal trafficking. After proof-of-concept studies, PCT is now being translated into clinical applications for Fabry, <b>Gaucher</b> and Pompe <b>disease.</b> This approach, however, can only be applied to patients carrying chaperone-responsive mutations. The recent demonstration of a synergistic effect of chaperones and ERT expands the applications of PCT and prompts a re-evaluation of their therapeutic use and potential. This review discusses the strengths and drawbacks of the potential therapies available for LSDs and proposes that future research should be directed towards the development of treatment protocols based on the combination of different therapies to improve the clinical outcome of LSD patients...|$|R
40|$|Objective: Intravenous enzyme {{replacement}} therapy (ERT) with recombinant alpha-L-iduronidase may ameliorate the non-neurological symptoms {{in patients with}} mucopolysaccharidosis type I (MPS I).

Setting: This two-centre study included 17 ERT-treated MPS I patients between 1 and 35 years of age. A patient was allowed to transfer to home treatment after a minimum period of 6 months of in-hospital administration of ERT and after a self- or home nurse-supported home setting was arranged. Results: Thirteen out of 17 patients transferred to home treatment with a median time to transfer of 13 months (range 7 - 40 months). Two patients preferred to continue ERT in the hospital, whereas for two other patients the transfer to home was hampered for practical reasons. All patients who received ERT at home were assisted by either a relative or a nurse. In total over 1000 home infusions were performed and no serious complications were observed. Two infusion-associated reactions were observed, both within the first 3 months of in-hospital administration of ERT.

40|$|Lysosomes are organelles ubiquitously {{distributed}} in most eukaryotic cells. They are spherical particles with {{a diameter of}} 0. 5 – 1. 5 microns. The pH in them is low (~pH 5. 0) and they contain many acid hydrolases that take part in protein degradation in the cell. Lysosomes also contain lipases, polysaccharidases, and nucleases. Deficiencies {{in some of these}} enzymes lead to specific lysosomal storage diseases, 1, 2 such as Tay Sachs, <b>Gaucher,</b> and Hunter <b>diseases.</b> Lysosomes also contribute to maintaining cellular homeostasis and thus, malfunctions in this organelle will have a direct impact on cell behavior and fate. 3 Lysosomes may also be involved in other cellular processes such as Albinism 4 and aging. 5, 6 The Lysosome Isolation Kit provides a procedure for isolating an enriched lysosomal fraction from animal tissues and cultured cells by differential centrifugation followed by density gradient centrifugation and/or calcium precipitation. The presence of lysosomes can be determined by measuring the acid phosphatase activity with the Acid Phosphatase Assay Kit (Catalog Number CS 0740) or the b-N-Acetylglucosaminidase activity with the b-N-Acetylglucosaminidase Assay Kit (Catalog Number CS 0780).

40|$|The {{critical}} {{relevance of}} the lysosomal compartment for normal cellular function can be proved by numbering the clinical phenotypes that arise in lysosomal storage disorders (LSDs), a group of around 70 different monogenic autosomal or X-linked syndromes, caused by specific lysosomal enzyme deficiencies: all LSDs are characterized by progressive accumulation of heterogeneous biologic materials in the lysosomes of {{various parts of the}} body such as viscera, skeleton, skin, heart, and central nervous system. At least a fraction of LSDs has been associated with mixed abnormalities involving the immune system, while some patients with LSDs may result more prone to autoimmune phenomena. A large production of proinflammatory cytokines has been observed in <b>Gaucher</b> and Fabry <b>diseases,</b> and wide different autoantibody production has been also reported in both. Many immune-mediated reactions are crucial to the pathogenesis of different inflammatory signs in mucopolysaccharidoses, and subverted heparan sulphate catabolism might dysregulate cellular homeostasis in the brain of these patients. Furthermore, an inappropriate activation of microglia is implicated in the neurodegenerative foci of Niemann-Pick disease, in which abnormal signalling pathways are activated by impaired sphingolipid metabolism. In addition, not the simple impaired catabolism of gangliosides per se, but also the production of anti-ganglioside autoantibodies contributes to the neurological disease of gangliosidoses. Even if the exact relationship between the modification of lysosomal activities and modulation of the immune system remains obscure, there is emerging evidence of different impaired immunity responses in a variety of LSDs: in this review we investigate and summarize the immune abnormalities and/or clinical data about immune system irregularities which have been described in a subset of LSDs...|$|R
