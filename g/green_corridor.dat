5|$|The Ashford <b>Green</b> <b>Corridor</b> is {{a linear}} park {{alongside}} {{the two main}} rivers through the town, which is protected from development by lying on the main flood plain. Most of the area covered by the park {{has been marked by}} Ashford Borough Council as a nature reserve. This area includes Victoria Park, which lies to the immediate south of the town centre and the railway. It includes an ornate fountain first shown at the 2nd International Exhibition in London in 1862, and presented to the park by George Harper on 24 July 1912. The Coningbrook Lakes Country Park opened on a former quarry site to the northeast of town in 2015.|$|E

25|$|Between Eastleigh and Southampton, {{the brook}} and its {{immediate}} surrounds form a <b>green</b> <b>corridor</b> which is reportedly home to roe deer, lizards, kingfishers, wasp spiders and slowworms.

40|$|This thesis {{focuses on}} {{analyzing}} {{the role that}} <b>green</b> <b>corridors</b> have {{in the structure of}} urban areas in fragmented cities. The pathology we observe is found in the relationship between built zones and lineal elements. The dual interpretation of <b>green</b> <b>corridors</b> (articulation/segregation of urban fragments) causes physical disconnection and visual discontinuity between adjacent urban fragments. Due to this, the following question emerges: if urban continuity is {{one of the keys to}} achieve a certain level of urbanity, in which way can segregation, triggered by <b>green</b> <b>corridors,</b> be reversed and converted into an element of urban articulation? The analysis is based on an observation of one of the paradigmatic examples of the fragmented urban structure, the city of Minsk, Belarus, which was completely destroyed after World War II and rebuilt according to Soviet Urban Planning ideologies. Conforming to the new general plan, a new urban model was established, which illustrates the functioning of the fragmented urban structure and the duality of continuous green elements...|$|R

2500|$|Many {{of these}} {{recommendations}} helped {{to shape the}} policy agenda of the Dellums administration. The task forces recommended a land use policy which would emphasize zoning for job-creating business. This policy was adopted in 2007, and the city is being zoned.

[...] The task forces recommended {{a focus on the}} green economy, and the Mayor, along with a variety of community organizations created the Green Jobs Corps, an office of sustainability and the East Bay <b>Green</b> <b>Corridor.</b> [...] The Mayor reports that approximately two-thirds of the recommendations had been implemented as of the end of 2009. [...] The Task Forces and the Inauguration itself, which included hundreds of the city's least affluent residents, were considered examples of grassroots democracy.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe paper {{presents}} tendency {{analysis for}} advanced technologies. Advanced technologies â€“ {{is an area}} having different acceptability and local adaptation levels in different countries, thus it is particularly important {{to be acquainted with}} its application possibilities and techniques. Contributing to a more efficient use of existing transport infrastructure, AT becomes a powerful tool in improving mobility conditions and optimizing transport activities. The importance of advanced technologies application in different modes of transport is examined. The functionality of advanced technologies application in different modes of transport is indicated and all elements of the transport system are taken into account. Relational database structures are provided; aspects of information and communications, multi-stage transport chains are distinguished. The optimal functionality of road transport and port interaction is particularly important in freight transportation by <b>green</b> transport <b>corridors</b> where transport modes are combined and activities are coordinated. The carried-out analysis of advanced technologies application possibilities in freight transportation by <b>green</b> transport <b>corridors</b> indicated that issues must be explored and solutions are to be suggested. On the basis of these solutions, it is possible to make the efficient use of freight delivery (exportation) by road transport to (from) the seaport. For this purpose, efficiency analysis model of road transport and port interaction while developing freight transportation by <b>green</b> <b>corridors</b> is suggested. The developed model provides an opportunity to evaluate how efficiently road transport is employed in the <b>green</b> <b>corridors,</b> where cargo is transported to/from the seaport...|$|R
